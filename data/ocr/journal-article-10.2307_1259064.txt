Pp. 279 (with end-paper maps). 75s. (Paper-back, I Is.) THIS work has been compiled with the explicit purpose of informing those who wish to study the religion of Melanesia, to work with it as administrators, or to change it as missionaries. It is a collection of nine modern probing studies of geographically related regions, introduced by a general study of religion. Magico-religious beliefs and practices are shown to be an integral part of the indigenous cultures, and, despite their number and diversity of character, are largely based on ancestor and spirit worship. Belief in a supreme being has not been observed, the main emphasis consisting in respect for and attempts to propitiate a number of spirit ancestors, some existing from the remote past, some recently remembered. While these beings may be given location in certain material objects, more generally attitudes towards the universe are anthropomorphic. While these super- natural beings are approached according to patterns of sacrifice, atone- ment and intercession, the feeling towards them is scarcely proper 'worship'. Generally mourning rites play a significant part in the people's lives, 70</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS while placation of the ancestors' ghosts is often important in the rules governing agriculture, hunting, fishing, etc. And while there are numer- ous myths and legends closely bound up with prevailing superstitions and beliefs in magic, their continuance is less due to magicology than because tradition has given them a validity. Usually no clear distinction is made between the 'natural' and the 'supernatural', so that magical and religious acts are thought of as quite practical ways of coping with certain aspects of physical reality, and sickness and misfortune are often ascribed to sorcery and the breaking of taboos. The value of this symposium is that it lays especial emphasis on the observation and analysis of the 'contact' situation, and it shows to what extent the differing secular-socio-cultural systems of the Highland and the Seaboard peoples depend on the degree of pressure from the Western world. In the Highland areas, not penetrated until 1930 and only administered from 1945, the societies have stayed peaceful and tolerant, with the old order left more or less intact; with respect for the remote dead, and often elaborate pantheons; with legislation levelled only at those magico-religious practices which are deemed repugnant to the principles of mortality and humanity. The smaller groups of the Seaboard, lacking cohesion, were forced by the early immigrant Europeans, notably the missionaries, to accept an alien way of life, and the old patterns of leadership, generally sustained and reinforced by acknowledged mastery of religious secrets, were destroyed. Among these peoples, too, the economic aspect of religion, that involving placation, bargaining, and coercion, has had important consequences, in that the sense of strain, brought about by the failure of the new beliefs (those of Christianity) to bring wealth like that of the whiteman, has lead to the increase of sorcery, both as a medium for expressing enmity and as an excuse for initiating warfare. It has also brought about a resurgence of the society with its organization and ideology deliberately modernized to solve the problems created by the European rule, in the 'cargo cults', new rituals evolved in the belief that careful enactment of systematic religious ritual would provide the people with the whiteman's goods. This was natural since Christianity had been interpreted as a series of systematically interrelated ideas about the new world order. For it was often felt that the missionaries had been withholding the central secret or religious formula, the key to posses- sion of this occult knowledge. The Highland attitude towards Christianity has been simpler-- either total rejection, or its assimilation to the traditional cult of the dead. Within these broad divisions there are many local ones, so that some peoples are quite receptive to the work of the Christian missions, 7'</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS although there is always the strongest tendency for the ancestral magico-religious beliefs and practices to persist in nominally Christian communities. While this is a difficult book to read - since the peoples are many and their religious observances by no means similar or of a local pattern - it is of the new school of objective analysis, free from the biases of missionary or 'noble savage' mis-interpretations, and well aware that so much of the ethos has been strengthened as a result of civilization's contact with the primitive society. This is natural, since for Melanesian man religion has always been a form of magic, and, seen against a background of man's relations with his fellows, his environ- ment and his created spirits, it is a practical concern for immediate results, a 'technology rather than a spiritual force for human salvation'. For those not familiar with the area, or aware from personal experi- ence of the complexities of the thought of primitive man, the work may serve as corrective to a blind acceptance of attitudes to 'religion' gleaned from Tylor or Frazer or even the later Malinowski. Certainly the beliefs discussed here rather support the thesis of Goode, that religion and magic are the two ideal poles of a continuum, the one social and collective, the other individual and isolative. These territories, largely Australian administered, are fortunate in the time of their exploitation and contact with the West, and in the analysis of the traditional religion, in that in neither sphere would either the blunders or false assumptions of the nineteenth century seem likely to be repeated. The collection is a notably objective anthology of well thought-out reports based on recent fieldwork. Since Melanesia presents perhaps the last social crucible of the clash of the West and a truly primitive complex of societies, it has much to offer the student of comparative religion and the folklorist, both of whom may well feel compelled to reanalyse the convenient simplifications which they have always accepted as the norm.
