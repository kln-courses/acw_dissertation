<plain_text><page sequence="1">ENTERING YESTERDAY By WALTER A. SEDELOW, Jr. A either end there was a master, and to a side ten boys. I tried to make my behavior toward them consonant with "rule of law"? a canon of correct behavior as explicit as possible, uniformly applied, and internally consistent?and, further, to ensure its observance I employed a felicific calculus. Yet, looking down the table, it seemed, sometimes, as if the outward proprieties were more fully observed there. Why? After all the other master was erratic when I was consistent?sometimes a boy was punished for no apparent cause and sometimes for lesser trifles there was no punishment and no reprimand. There they knew less well what was expected of them, and less well that unpleasantness followed indecorum. How, then, did he seem to have more control than I did? Possibly my impression is at fault?perhaps he had less control than I think. Or, perhaps my scale of rewards and punishments didn't go high enough. And that may be true. But to go to greater lengths certainly meant more effort than he employed, for an effect that well might have been not considerably different. How, then, did it happen that he seemed to exercise more control than I? To them my system was clear and know able. His was not. The generalization : What you can't control, you pro pitiate. What you understand and can count on, you can plan to control. You know the framework of its operation, and you can act outside it, or within it and against it, in the latter case with your own pain and pleas ure calculations. What you don't understand, can't count on, you can't control, and if its impingement upon you seems inescapable, what can you do besides magic, besides propitiation? Against you it has an ally in your own generalized anxiety?it has reached the ego and unconscious, and you wonder, now and then consciously, when it is going to strike. This state can be intolerable, so you observe it as closely as you can, you try to read it?but not knowing its principle of operation your efforts to please have to be based on its similarities to something else, your self image perhaps. But your propitiatory relationship is nonetheless magi cal?trying to control what you don't understand through similarities of accident. How much easier it is to deal with what you do understand? in all the areas your understanding lets you know it doesn't touch, you can ignore it, and, within the pale, you can always decide whether the game is worth the candle, since game and candle both have a personal price, clearly tagged in known amounts of pleasure and pain. And, too, ?here the essential ego is touched less closely?no vector is added for the pattern of the personality's internal pressure system, only some new external constants, possibly of minor magnitude, and certainly occasional in contingency. 467</page><page sequence="2">468 AMERICAN SCIENTIST Reflecting on this experience was a beginning of wisdom in compre hending the psychological correlates of behavior in rites of sacrifice? whether in ancient Peru or in Shakespeare's bogus Rome?and it was, perhaps, a comprehension as much through the participation of the emo tions as through the operations of the intellect. So it is that one enters yesterday. * * * There are factors common to the psychological experience of a Roman soldier east of the Mediterranean taking up one of the mystery religions? Mithraism, Christianity, Isisism?and an Italian humanist of the early decades of the Renaissance taking up Greek and enthusiastically ex amining newly discovered antique manuscripts. In the tense and con fused household of Victoria Lincoln's Out from Eden, where mutual personal isolation was great enough that only habit and technicality excuse our calling it a family, an adolescent derived immense pleasure from reading the exact one-meaning statements which describe a locus of points, such as a parabola. Lydgate in the provincial town of Middle march, worn and beaten by each day's petty concerns?personal finances and the mutual ill-wills of the inhabitants?wished he might return to his researches into elemental histology. Push these human situations up to a higher abstractness and one comes to a level of generality which shows a meaning common to all of them: Frustrated enough by the unmalleableness of the external human world in satisfying him, the individual may be impelled toward occupa tion with a system of ideas, a system of ideas where the variability of the external world is overmatched in the stasis of the axiomatic basis of the idea system, and where the unpredictability of the external world is overmatched in the lucidity of the ideas. Thus, the frustration of the one is met by the ease and the satisfaction of the other. Recourse to the pleasures of this fraction of the life of the mind is to be distinguished from simpler wish fulfillment by greater sublimation?more radical displacement?and by greater relational activity in the consciousness, resulting in greater idea complexity than in, say, the simple erotic day dream. And in this ease and satisfaction provided by relating idea to idea?by contrast with relating idea to object (science) or object to ob ject (art), or person to person (human relations)?we tap one of the sources of appeal for those elaborated dialectical systems in which a great variety of idea-detail is logically related to one or another of a few simple propositions, as in the systems of Hegel and Marx. The pleasures of symbolic logic, the schoolboy's Euclid, and the higher mathematics are highly analogous. One notices, too, idea systems of persons who cannot escape from the</page><page sequence="3">ENTERING YESTERDAY 469 inevitable reality of their human surroundings and yet, desirous of such an escape, avoid considering particular humans as such by losing them, ideationally, in entities above or below human scale, in entities with a marked freedom from anything anthropomorphic or even corporeal. Kurt Lewin, for example, analysed personalities vectorially and Sorokin was able to fill a long chapter of Contemporary Sociological Theories with descriptions of the Mechanistic School?those who, including Pareto, explained the social in the terms of the physical or chemical or me chanical or mathematical. It is perhaps no wonder that Korzybski consid ered it a matter of general psychotherapy to clear up the contradictory and confusing connotations of abstract verbal symbols so that they might be maneuvered with less friction and more fluidity. And this may give us a clew to a part of the explanation for "bureaucratese," with its high incidence of abstract nouns lacking obvious referents in reality; anyone who knows the extreme frustrations of interpersonal action within a bureaucracy can see how desirable it must be for those within it writing rules and regulations for its conduct, to escape into a mode of discourse where there is a minimizing of vividness in designating de tails of behavior. In that way of writing the likely frustrations and complications of such interaction are glossed over in abstraction. We are told that those Roman soldiers on garrison duty in the East brought back to Rome the mystery religions and that the lower classes there absorbed them because both groups were obliged to live on in a world where they had known nothing but despair in their contest with external reality and had nothing but despair to look forward to as the outcome of the continuation of that contest in the future. Historians of the Renaissance have in recent decades engaged in monographic conflict over the modal social and economic status of the early generation of Humanists in Italy; perhaps the vigour of the escape of some of those Humanists into Greek and ancient Greece argues, for them at least, in favor of the contention that they were in ways a rather underprivileged group, getting out of the Christian world to a degree for the same reason their ancestors had gotten into it?for the release from reality that goes with the mind's frolic in an ideal playground. What suggested to me the entrance by empathy into this particular congeries of comparable yesterdays? After years of rather limited, selec tive contact with human beings, a tour of military duty resulted in a far higher, and more intense, rate of social interaction. Returning to my quarters one afternoon, a technical manual's description of the abstractly characterizable patterns of global wind movements seemed for its own sake a thing of particular delight. * * *</page><page sequence="4">470 AMERICAN SCIENTIST Budd Schulberg's biography of Washington is probably better than Freeman's. Descriptive accuracy, thing representation, is to be sure a possible criterion of a biography's quality?"How much tobacco did that coach cost?"?but persona fidelity is another. Without wishing to beat the drums too hard for Charles Maurras and Lytton Strachey, isn't it appropriate to ask if, in effect, George Washington didn't write Robert Frost's poem, Provide, provide? Why else did he believe the boy Jackie Custis his superior? May we not say that this is all over again the mind of Stephen Hero during breakfast in the tower with Buck Mulligan? For generations, Frost's has been a common young man's question?the answer perhaps prefiguring by thirty years a nation's politics. "Do you want to be Laf ayette or Lord Eldon, Priestley or Burke, Julian Blumberg or Sammy Glick?" * * * The table had no ends precisely, nor was it round, its ellipticality sym bolizing the compromise of the conference-seminar between professorial pronouncement and the total free exchange of views by all, graduate students and professor alike. But the professor sat at what there was of an end. Vico on history had been the topic. We were supposed to have read in the Fisch and Bergin translation. Someone, of course, had pointed out Vico's influence on Joyce. And then we got to Vico's suggestion that the historian must enter imaginatively the world of the past. But how? There were, to be sure, various tricks, such as studying etymologies and mastering the pattern of cycles, but if these were necessary devices they were not sufficient devices, and, anyway, how could you be sure you un derstood any yesterday by using them. Well, indeed one can't finally prove the validity of such percepts, but one does think to have gained entrance to a yesterday when one sees correspondences between it, other yesterdays, and one's own immediate present?which happens through their common dimension in the constancy of psychic mechanisms.</page></plain_text>
