<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANTITHETICAL ESSAYS IN LITERARY CRITICISM AND LIBERAL EDUCATION, by Hazard Adams. Tallahassee: Florida State Uni versity Press, 1990. 292 pp. $29.95 cloth, $19.95 paper. In this new collection of essays, written and published over the last ten years, Professor Adams advances a theory of criticism that would free us from the impasse (as he describes it) of poststruc turalist critique while at the same time rescuing the activity of criticism itself. Adams's strategy, in the theoretical and pedagogical essays, consists of positing an alternative to the binary system of negation based on Blake's notion of the contrary and Yeats's notion of the antithetical, an alternative that is "always oppositional" (173) and never dialectical. (One regrets that Adams does not cite Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard or Samuel Weber, to 312</page><page sequence="2">name only a few writers who have worked with the philosophical and/or literary implications of an opposition that moves beyond the limits of binary logic.) In the essays on literature, Adams's primary concern is to constitute the literary text as "a potentiality for conver sation" (58): "A text so constituted-and such a constitution is al ways temporary - comes into contrariety with other cultural objects, sometimes as a restraint, sometimes as liberation, always as an antitheticality" (58), In the end, one cannot help but think that the "temporary" critical constitution of the text is less an antithetical alternative to poststructuralist methods than a theoretical compro mise with them. The critical constitution of Joyce's texts seems principally to in volve the analysis of narrative structures. For example, in "Byron, Yeats, and Joyce: Heroism and Technic," Adams advances the thesis that Joyce, in Ulysses, displaces the "heroic center" from the levels of story and narration to the "larger circumferential act of arranging" (84). While to some extent Adams is merely recycling David Hay man's original concept of the arranger, there is the added notion that the arranger "has been all along a more mature Stephen Dedalus" (89). This assertion is elaborated on in the next essay "Critical Constitution of the Literary Text: The Example of Ulysses/' Here we find a complex theory of narrative consisting of "a schema of eleven perspectives" (90) which permit the critical constitution of the liter ary text. The first six perspectives (our notion of an author, historical authors, authority/arranger, narrators and foci of narration, the fictive story, the characters) constitute a set of concentric circles with the "inferred story" at the center and "authority anti-authority, and [the] authoritively projected reader" at the periphery (109). Adams suggests that Stephen is a version of the arranger who "begins to dominate narration and even the acts of the heroes, heroines, and protagonists... to such an extent that arranging seems to be the act of a character working from some greater, more inclusive circum ference" (93). By displacing the mechanism of the arranger to a circumference outside that of traditional narration (with its anthropomorphic nar rator) Adams would appear to dehumanize it. But then he suggests that the arranger (which is always referred to as "he") "has become in some way the hero of the text at a greater circumference, perhaps a Ulysses-figure himself" (94). Adams tries to locate textual authority in an arranger that behaves like a character but that cannot be reduced to one; the attempt to create a region of authoritative manipulation of textual effects in an arranger that is neither char acter, narrator nor author is unsatisfactory if only because the ar 313</page><page sequence="3">ranger bears the marks of all three. Ultimately, it is up to the reader (whose various manifestations make up the last five perspectives) "to constitute the relation of authority to arranger to narration to heroes" (107). Joyce and his narrator, it would appear, are off the hook. I must say that I am taken by Adams's conclusion that the arranger "disappears into arrangement only, which is but the cycle of eternal return" (109), but I am puzzled by his insistence on retaining an anthropomorphic vocabulary Perhaps it is not puzzlement at all, but disappointment: for as it happens, the arranger as hero turns out to be the old-fashioned narrator writ large. For Adams, the Joycean arranger usurps the traditional narrator's job, "gradually calling attention to himself and his medium," "accumulating techniques in various chapters which he tends now to appropriate at w?T (103). I admire Adams's insights into Joyce's narrative technique, but I fi nally wonder if the idea of the arranger is really necessary to make his point. It seems to me that the circumference of arrangement serves no purpose but to mediate between authority (which never seems to adhere to author, narrative, or character, an evasion that itself de serves critical scrutiny) and narration. Isn't it possible that the ar ranger is merely a critical construct designed to compensate for a loss of faith in the master narratives of social and cultural power that lie behind specific literary narratives? In the end, it might be better to talk about a narrator that interrogates the authority which it both represents and legitimizes, one that is critical of its own tendencies toward hegemonic control. This approach would bring to antitheti cality and critical constitution the element of critique they appear to lack. I think Adams is finally more persuasive when he talks about Finnegans Wake. In "'Mpsulumply Wroghtlf\ ALP in Finnegans Wake" he describes ALP as a kind of muse of historical poetry employing Vico and Hayden White to produce a very suggestive (though un developed) tropological reading of the Wake's "productive maternal principle" (164). In "Yeats, Joyce and Criticism Today" he argues that the Wake and Yeats's A Vision dramatize the problematic of interpreta tion. The emblem of this problematic is the triangular representa tion that Shem makes of ALP to keep her "from disappearing into the beyond that the sphere symbolizes" (145). Metaphors are em ployed in order to fix meaning, Adams argues, but the metaphoric fixation is to be understood ironically not dogmatically. Thus the polysemy of the Wake can be contained (though not destroyed) by synecdochic or typological interpretation. 314</page><page sequence="4">Adams contends that contemporary theories of language lack the "antithetical logic" that prevents the Wake from collapsing into a Babylonian anarchy. The idea that the Wake anticipates the principles of dissemination and diff?rance now associated with Jacques Derrida and deconstruction is hardly new, but Adams's analysis of the Wake as an "antithetical book with ethical potentiality" (157), permits a position that can at least plausibly counter the deconstructionists. The Wake, though it is only "on the way" to being about the external world, offers the possibility of an ethic of interpretation that would remind us that we are "a part of what we seek to understand and by synecdoche are constituted as our understanding" (157). For Adams, the Wake is finally a text of secular morality that, ultimately, leads to a secular redemption. It is perhaps this emphasis on moral ity and ethics that constitutes Adams's most interesting, if prob lematic, insight into Joyce's texts.
