<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Nusayri-cAlawi Religion: An Enquiry into its Theology and Liturgy. By Meir M. Bar-Asher and Aryeh Kofsky. (Jerusalem Studies in Religion and Culture Vol. 1). Pp. 244. Leiden/Boston/Koln: Brill, 2002. EUR 60.00. Studies on obscure religious cults and practices are not innovations within academic pub lishing; indeed, in the past, publishers have made it a virtue to chum out the most out landish, obscure (even obscurantist) and antiquarian of inquiries. But the present work under review is a historiographical contribution to a little understood religious doctrine and practice within the broad parameters of Tslam'. The blurb at the back of the cover gives us the primary justification for an interest in the Nusayri-C AlawT community: the simple fact that the rulers of Syria for the past few decades, within this religious diverse society, have been drawn from this small religious community based just north of the Lebanon mountains. Political significance draws attention and 'knowing thy enemy' is a critical maxim of international relations. Yet little, it is claimed, is known about their reli gious beliefs and practices, a result as much of sectarian suspicion of outsiders as of the polemics of opponents wishing to define the cAlawis as heretics.</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 83 Indeed little has been written on the topic before, whether within the rubric of 'extreme Shicism' or 'syncretic religion' in the Near East. Some anthropological studies exist, usually focusing on the folk practices of Turkish Alevis. These studies, as well as previous and present interest, cannot be divorced from political interests. The origins of academic interest in the 0 AlawTs began with French orientalism in the 19th century through the French encounter with their (later) colonial subjects in Lebanon and Syria. There is little need to rehearse arguments about colonial practice but it is clear that colonisers, whether French or British, established modes of 'knowl edge-gathering', sought to define their subjects and reify their beliefs, and perpetuat ed 'communalism' to enhance, justify and sustain their political control. While early French orientalists sought to locate the cAlawi community within remains of syn cretic and heterodox Syrian Christianity, later scholarship, notably the work of Heinz Halm, Henry Corbin and Matti Moosa, has suggested that the origins of the cAlawI community and their theology ought to be investigated within the historical dynamic of extremist SfrTism, the ghuldt. Bar-Asher and Kofsky are sympathetic to the latter point of view, whilst conceding aspects of syncreticism with Christianity (although, having conceded or made this point, they make little attempt to substantiate it), and they do make some significant general points about the cAlawT religion. First, it is (or at least historically was and insofar as we know is) a Religion of the Book, a learned theology that is steeped in the core texts of extremist ShTism, texts that possess thick qur'anicity. By this I mean that these texts are replete with quotations and allusions to the Qur'an and that the inter-textuality of these works depends to a large extent upon the Qur'anic text, specifically those verses that are central to ShTcism, whether 'main stream', esoteric or extremist. Second, at the heart of the cAlawi religion is a gnostic doctrine about the nature of reality and its unfolding. True meaning is not quite appar ent and the ?AlawI texts themselves reveal an extensive use of the hermeneutic of ta3wil, of esoteric interpretation and explication that reveals a metaphysical doctrine and truth and has a soteriological and transformative function upon the initiate to whom these secrets are revealed. Third, the cAlawi religion is a complete theology that not only defines its creed for the community within, but also provides a polemic that differentiates their faith from other confessions, ShIcI or non-ShicI, Muslim or non-Muslim. The work is divided into eight chapters, six of which discuss cAlawi theology by analysing important texts in manuscript, and two of which consider liturgy by describing the cAlawI calendar and one 19th century cAlawi catechism. The book comes across as an attempt to publish disparate articles around a central theme with out being a full-fledged monograph; as the authors admit themselves, about half of the work has appeared before in the form of articles on the specific texts.</page><page sequence="3">84 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Chapter One is a study of a 13th century dispute (mund^ara) between two rival parties ofc Alawis on the central theme of the ghuldt, namely the deification ofc Ali b. Abi Talib and the doctrine of the cAlawi 'trinity' of Muhammad, cAli and Salman. The authors makes an important plea for us to disaggregate our notion of this 'heresy' and recognise that even within marginality and in varying contexts, plurality of opinions and a con stant struggle for affirming one's creed exists. The polemic dispute is seen through the eyes of Yusuf al-Nashshabi, a native of Aleppo. In the text, one notices such standard features of heretication and ostracism of his opponents: he laments their moral laxity, he attacks their ignorance which is a reflection of the commonly held view that truth wanes and decreases over time, he describes them as astray from the true path and as deviants seeking material pleasure and wealth. These are familiar themes to anyone who has studied the processes of heretication in medieval Islam (and indeed in other Near Eastern faiths). Two other charges that Nashshabi makes against his opponents are sig nificant within a ShicI and ghuldt context: first, that his opponents have divulged secrets to the uninitiated multitude, and secondly, that they are colluding with corrupt (and of course non-cAlawi) governors. The authors note the messianic reference in the text of the impending advent of the Mahdi, but we are given no indication of the role of such a redeemer in the c Alawi religion, since the role of the Twelfth Imam is rather ambiva lent. On the issue of the divinity of CAH, Nashshabi condemns those who stress the anthropomorphic and totally human and incarnate aspects of CA1I the God, whilst for him, the divine is a more abstract reality who is manifest over time continuously in suc cessive cycles. The analogy with Jesus is drawn and rejected. As with most (if not all) Muslim confessions, the polemicist claims that his doctrine, which he associates with the early cAlawi theologian Khasibi, is the true monotheistic doctrine and all who oppose it are 'associators'. Of particular interest is the polemical information given about rival cAlawi sectaries, and the authors ably make interesting comparisons with intra-Christian polemics on the nature of Christ. But what is required is a comparative framework that discusses the ghuldt context, which is only mentioned and not investi gated. What is also noteworthy about Nashshabi's transcendent theology of God/cAli is the use of quotations from those Qur'anic verses that stress the transcendence and utter alterity of the divine, verses that are always adduced as evidence by those claiming to be 'true monotheists'. Two other important themes in the text are the insistence upon the possibility of mystical union with the divine and the theory of emanation that accounts for the coming into being of the c Alawi trinity and the cosmos. Clearly, there is much common ground in this single text that would allow for fruitful comparative study locating these cAlawi doctrines within the wider context of Islamic thought. Unfortunately, the authors do not provide it. Chapter Two is a substantial analysis of the theology of a medievalc Alawi text, Kitdb al-Usus. The authors consider this work to be indicative of some aspect of Christian</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 85 borrowing through its use of Christian theological terminology and its extended com parison between Christology and the mystery of the divinity. The cosmological account of creation, the role of the divine and the creation of the spiritual and physical realms are reminiscent of other gnostic forms of Muslim theological expression. The world is divided into the light of belief and the darkness of unbelief, and the divine places veils between itself and humanity. The fall of Adam may be redeemed through the gnostic's quest for the truth and return to the primordial state. As with other forms of Shicism, homologies are discerned between angelology and cosmology, between the cosmic hierarchy and the spiritual hierarchy. On the thorny question of theodicy, the doctrine of metempsychosis is offered as a solution, as is a modification of the Christian doctrine of original sin. The numerous quotations (often apocryphal) from Jesus are noteworthy. The authors conclude that this treatise suggests a close affinity between the c Alawi religion and forms of Christianity. Certainly the doctrine of origi nal sin is peculiar in a Muslim context. However, much of the language and terminol ogy has resonances in other ShTi, especially Ismacili, traditions, and the language of esotericism and gnosticism is common in a wider Muslim theological composition. Chapter Three, which follows, continues with the theme of gnosticism and apophasis and focuses on ideas about the ascent of the gnostic, taking as his paradigm the night journey of the Prophet Muhammad. What is significant about these themes is not only the thick qur'anicity of the texts but also the interesting points of comparison with Sufi accounts of the mystic's journey modelled upon the Prophet's micrdj. The very fact that the c Alawi commentary of Abu cAbd Allah al-Husayn al-Sa?igh on Q. 17:1 considers the prophetic model and relates it to the gnostic quest to know the divinity, stresses the self-fashioning of the c Alawi thinker who is consciously locating himself within a Muslim intellectual world. Chapter Four then provides a translation and an edition of this text. Chapter Five is a translation and edition of an exchange between the master al Husayn al-Khasibi and the disciple al-Husayn al-Sa?igh on the nature of the two high er hypostases of the trinity, namely the macnd and the ism (sometimes associated with the historical Imam). Like Chapter Two, Three and Four, it was previously published in article form. To the question, which one of the macnd and the ism should the wor shipper address, the Qur'anic answer is provided that stresses that God's are the Most Beautiful Names and one may address Him by any of them. Chapter Six finally brings us to liturgy and provides a useful description of the religious calendar of the cAlawis based upon the book on festivals of Abu SacId Maymun al-Tabarani (d. 1034) and the work of Adhani, the 19th century c Alawi apostate. Most of these festivals are common to other Muslims such as the fast of Ramadan and its concluding festival or to other Shicis such as cId al-Ghadir that</page><page sequence="5">86 Journal of Qur'anic Studies commemorates the designation ofc All by the Prophet as his successor. AdhanI men tions a variety of festivals that seem to be of a Christian provenance. The authors do not discuss these in detail, but it would seem that, given the expectations of French orientalists in the 19th century, Adham's stress upon the Christian aspects of c Alawi belief and practice only corroborated and reassured them in their conclusions. What is particular to the understanding of the festivals is an antinomian and esoteric spirit. The days of Ramadan are interpreted as representing members of the spiritual hierar chy. Husayn was not martyred at Karbala but rather, his outward form was bestowed upon a supporter who was killed, consonant with Muslim Christology of the Passion. It becomes clear that, while the c Alawi liturgical calendar closely mirrors the Ithnacashari Shlci and emphasises the role of the holy family of the Prophet, mean ings and significances shift. Chapter Seven, returning to theology, is a short Druze polemic against the c Alawis. Common polemical themes emerge: the opponent is morally lax, often sexually licen tious while the speaker is pure and of highest probity; the opponent has incorrect belief and is an 'associator' while the speaker is a pure monotheist. This treatise again reveals the complete theological system of the c Alawis in competition with others and shows the common Muslim cultural and theological symbols evoked in the debate. The final Chapter Eight is a translation and edition of a 19th century cAlawi cate chism. The form and terminology suggests strong Christian influence, and given the Syrian/Lebanese provenance that should not surprise us. But the authors insist that the theological context is consonant with earlier theological expressions: whilst much of the text seems rather obscure and many of the names are difficult to identify, the cen tral themes of the divinity of cAli, the spiritual hierarchy, the Gnostic doctrine and quest for the divinity, and the liturgy of the 'Mass' and the 'Wine ceremony' (also evoked in an earlier Khattabi text studied by Corbin and Strothmann) are recognis able within the context of the work. Again given the context in which the text was acquired, it seems likely that the Christian language was a deliberate means to con vey an understanding of the faith to the French outsiders. Whether the c Alawis them selves used that language is not so clear. One would expect a gnostic tradition to make a clear distinction between internal meaning and truth and external language. On the whole, the volume is well produced and typographical errors are at a mini mum. The Arabic editions, despite a few small errors, are also well produced. However, an introduction that adequately locates c Alawi theology and liturgy into its historical context, especially within the ghuldt ShTcI and wider Muslim milieu is a major lacuna. How did the c Alawi authors draw upon the wider ShicI literary her itage? How did their use of Qur'anic and other 'proof-texts' differ from ShTT usage? Exactly who were these importantc Alawi figures such as Abu c Abd Allah al-Husayn</page><page sequence="6">Book Reviews 87 al-Khasibi, Yusuf al-Nashshabl and Abu c Abd Allah al-Husayn al-Sa?igh? What rela tion is there between the literary and theological composition of the c Alawis and the early ShicI ghuldt such as Abu'l-Khattab and al-Mufaddal b. cUmar al-Jucfi? What were the historical circumstances which led to the interactions and debates with other Muslims, ShIcIs and Druze? What accounts for an increasingly Christian tone and practice, according to the later texts, ofcAlawi theology and liturgy? A further chapter that would elucidate the spiritual hierarchy of the trinity, the abwdb and the aytdm, that would note the different uses of these terms in other Shlci hierar chies, would also be useful. The commonly held idea that the c Alawis regard the Twelve Imams of the Ithnacashari tradition as manifestations of the Godhea.d/macnd/c All is mentioned but not systematically analysed. Another draw back is the lack of a concluding chapter that attempts to tie together the strands of ?AlawT theory and practice. No real explanation is given for the use of the term 0 Alawi religion. It is perhaps unfair to expect Bar-Asher and Kofsky to have written a book that explains ghuldt theology and practice in detail and locates the c Alawi religion within it since that is not what they set out to do, nor have they really set themselves the task of writing an exhaustive study. However, the work as it stands is too much of a series of essays without a strong cohesive line of argument linking them and lacking both a proper contextual, historical and intellectual introduction and conclusion. The methodology of Bar-Asher and Kofsky is also questionable. While they demon strate adequately through a textual analysis the extremist ShTci context of the theology and liturgy of the c Alawis, the claim that this analysis may somehow render a normative picture of current cAlawT theology and liturgy is wholly misleading. How can a historical text define and contain the beliefs and practices of a contempo rary believer? How do the c Alawis themselves make sense of the texts that Bar-Asher and Kofsky have studied? The haqdJiq of these texts must surely elude these uniniti ated academics (as it does others who attempt to make sense of other texts of closed religious communities and their interpretive practices). The authors argue that since the conclusions of their texts tally with the 'revelations' of the c Alawi apostate Sulayman al-Adhani, their findings still hold true for c Alawi theology and practice in the 20th century. But they have little corroborating evidence beyond this single polemic. One might object that the 'sectarian and secretive' nature of the c Alawis may render any study of cAlawT theology and liturgy as it is understood and practised internally quite elusive. If Sunn! and ShIcT polemics against c Alawi theology and liturgy which places that community beyond the pale of Islam is questionable, then the orientalist presentation of c Alawi theology and liturgy through an analysis of historical</page><page sequence="7">88 Journal of Qur'anic Studies manuscripts located in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris seems equally problematic - the politics of studying Islam and its sectaries cannot be divorced from the mythi cal 'objective quest for knowledge'.
