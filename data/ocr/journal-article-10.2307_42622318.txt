DONNAN University of California, Los Angeles Moche Ceramic Portraits Moche portrait head bottle Art Institute of Chicago One of lization individuals of the was great the in achievements production three-dimensional of of true Moche portraits ceramic civi- lization was the production of true portraits of individuals in three-dimensional ceramic sculpture. These were made as functional ceramic vessels that could contain liquid. Moche portrait vessels are well known and widely appreciated today, but the nature of their production and distribution, and the ways in which they functioned in Moche society are not well understood. Moreover, there is little knowledge of who was por- trayed in the portraits, and why. This study provides insights recently gained from a sys- tematic analysis of a large sample of Moche ceramic portraits in museums and private collections throughout the world. 1 Geographic and Temporal Distribution of Moche Portraits Although portraiture is often considered a hallmark of Moche civilization, its produc- tion was very limited, both geographically and temporally. Moche portrait vessels were made only in the southern Moche region - south of the Pampa de Paiján (fig. i). Within this region, most have been found in the Chi- cama, Moche, and Virú valleys, and this is probably where they were produced. A few have been found in the Santa Valley (Larco Hoyle 1939: fig. 192), and it is possible that some were actually produced there. To date, there have been no documented examples of portrait vessels from the Nepeña, Casma, or Huarmey valleys, and it is unlikely that any were produced there. There have been no documented examples of ceramic portraits in the northern Moche region, north of the Pampa de Paiján, which includes the valleys from Jequetepeque in the south to Piura in the north. It should be noted, however, that our current perception of the distribution of Moche portraiture is based on limited archaeological evidence. Less than half of the valleys occupied by the Moche have been systematically surveyed for Moche habitation and burial sites, and very few Moche sites have been excavated. Never- theless, based on the information available today, it appears that the production of Moche ceramic portraits occurred in only three of the fifteen river valleys occupied by the Moche, and that the overall distribution of ceramic portraits only included these valleys and one or two neighboring valleys to the south. The time period in which Moche portraits were produced was also very limited. Ceramic vessels in the form of human heads were made by Moche potters during the early phases of Moche civilization, but these were generic depictions of human heads, with no attempt to render facial features accurately in order to portray specific individuals (figs. 2, 3).2 Nearly all of the truly lifelike Moche por- traits were made during Phases III and IV (figs. 4, 5). The potters of these phases excelled at rendering facial features accurately, and did 127</page><page sequence="3">i .

Given the florescence of true portraiture in Phases III and IV, it is curious that it did not continue into Phase V. Yet the Moche sud- denly stopped producing true portraits at the end of Phase IV, and during Phase V only stan- dard, generic human head representations were made (figs. 6, 7). During Phases I and II, the predominant subjects of Moche art were supernatural fig- ures and activities. This began to shift during 128 DONNAN</page><page sequence="4">2. Head bottle, Phase I Museo de Arqueología, Antropología e Historia, Universidad Nacional de Trujillo 3. Head bottle, Phase III Linden-Museum Stuttgart, Staat- liches Museum für Völkerkunde Phase III to a greater emphasis on human fig- ures and activities. This emphasis peaked during Phase IV at the same time that real- istic human portraits were produced. The art of Phases III and IV focused heavily on the activities of high-status adult males - deer hunting, ritual running, combat, and the bleeding, parading, and sacrifice of prisoners were among the most frequently depicted activities (Donnan and McClelland 1999). At the end of Phase IV the predominant focus of Moche art suddenly returned to supernatural figures and activities - and at the same time the production of portraiture ended. This strongly implies that Moche portraiture was closely linked to the frequent portrayal of high-status males in Moche art during Phases III and IV. The cause of the sudden shift in Moche art between Phase IV and Phase V is not clear, but it is interesting that it correlates with other indications of a severe disruption of Moche culture. At this time the Moche sud- denly abandoned major settlements that had been occupied for centuries, and they estab- lished new centers of power. It has been pro- posed that a severe and prolonged drought occurring between a.d. 562 and 594 played a major role in the disruption (Shimada 1994,- Shimada et. al. 1991). Whatever the cause, it is clear that Moche portaiture was not immune to the turbulent upheaval within the Moche world that marks the transition be- tween Phases IV and V. Multiple Portraits of Individuals Portrait head vessels were made in molds, thus facilitating the production of multiples. The molds were made of fired clay and con- sisted of two pieces. One formed the front half of the head, while the other formed the back half (Donnan 1992). To produce a portrait ves- sel, the two halves were lined with moist clay and joined together. An opening at either the bottom or top of the mold allowed the potter to reach inside to bond and smooth the seam between the front and back. The opening was then closed. Next, the two halves of the mold were removed and the seams on the exterior were smoothed. Figure 8 illustrates the front half of the mold that was used to create the portrait head bottle shown in Figure 9. It would have produced a finished portrait donnan 129</page><page sequence="5">4- Portrait head bottle, Phase IV Art Institute of Chicago 5 .

Portrait head bottle, made in the mold illustrated in Figure 8 Art Institute of Chicago except for the areas of the ear lobes, which were left rough and unfinished. The potter would have added ear ornaments or, as in the case of the impression in Figure 9, simply por- trayed the individual with a lock of hair in front of the ear. If the portrait vessel was to have a stirrup spout or jar neck, these parts were made separately and added subsequently. In collections today it is possible to identi- fy multiple portraits of the same individual, some of which appear to have been produced in the same mold. It is very difficult, however, to find two portraits of the same individual that are identical. The potters frequently added or removed ornaments, or altered the headdress. They also painted the sculpted portraits of the same individual in different ways, generally by altering the face paint and design or the degree of elaboration of the head cloths. Individuals Portrayed at Different Ages In some instances it is possible to identify portraits that show the same individual at different ages.3 The best example of this is the person illustrated in Figure 10, of whom more than forty-five portraits exist today. Key to his identification are distinctive facial scars. The most diagnostic of these is an irregular scar on the left side of his upper lip (fig. 11), a feature that is clearly indicated in nearly all portraits of him.4 The three portraits illus- trated in Figures 12-14 exhibit this scar, and thus are of the same individual. One of the por- traits shows him as an adolescent, at perhaps ten years of age (fig. 12). Another shows him somewhat older, at around fifteen years of age (fig. 13), and the third portrays him as a young man, perhaps in his early twenties (fig. 14). Most of his portraits, however, show him as an adult, at about thirty years of age (fig. 10). As the youngest portrait of this individual is at about age ten, his status was probably inherited rather than achieved: it is unlikely that he would have done anything at such a young age to earn a position of importance in Moche society. It is much more likely that he was part of an elite family, and as such was ascribed high status in his youth. Only later, as he matured into adulthood, would he assume important roles.

Full-figure portrait jar Museo Nacional de Antropología, Arqueología e Historia, Lima Activities Portrayed in Sculpture In addition to portrait head vessels, there are portraits that portray the individual's full fig- ure, either seated or standing. In some cases, the same person is portrayed in both portrait head and full-figure vessels. Since full-figure representations sometimes show the indi- vidual wearing distinctive garments and hold- ing objects, they can provide valuable infor- mation about the roles or activities in which that individual participated. As with portrait head vessels, full-figure portraits were made in molds. Generally one half of the mold produced the front of the fig- ure, and the other produced the back. In some instances, however, two molds were employed - one to produce the front and back of the body, and the other to produce the front and back of the head. The head was then attached to the body. Figure 15 illustrates a portrait head of an individual who can easily be recognized by his large bushy mustache, round goatee, and tuft of hair projecting forward over the center of his forehead. He usually wears disk ear ornaments that are suspended with wire loops from his earlobes. Figure 16 illustrates the same individual in a full-figure portrait, dressed as a warrior and holding a club and shield. Another full-figure portrait shows him at what must have been a somewhat later time, as a captive who had been defeated in combat (fig. 17). Here he is seminude, with his hands tied behind his back and a rope around his neck. Another full-figure portrait (fig. 18) shows him as a fully nude captive, with his hands tied behind his back and a rope around his neck. The two portraits of him as a captive imply that he was ultimately sacri- ficed at a ceremony where his throat was cut and his blood was consumed by attendant 134 DONNAN</page><page sequence="10">17- Full-figure portrait jar Museum of Man, San Diego, California 1 8.

Figure 19 shows another individual for whom we have both portrait head and full- figure portraits. Perhaps his most recognizable characteristic is his unusually long pointed nose (fig. 20). He also has a narrow face and lenticular eyes. His ear ornaments are usually square, with warclubs around the periphery. Some full-figure portraits show him holding a cloth in his lap containing a round bowl, and a spatula in one hand above the bowl (fig. 2 1 ).5 In another full-figure portrait his body is implied by the globular shape of the vessel chamber, and his arms and hands are depicted in fine-line painting (fig. 22). He holds a cup in his right hand, while his left hand is shown with the index finger extended. Another full- figure portrait shows him as a nude captive with a rope around his neck (fig. 23). His elaborate head cloth and characteristic ear ornaments have been removed, and a lock of hair hangs down in front of each ear. A portrait head bottle (fig. 24) also depicts this individual without his head cloth and ear ornaments - presumably as a captive who has been defeated in combat and is about to be sacrificed. Circular depressions in his ear lobes clearly indicate large perforations where the ear ornaments were inserted, and a lock of hair hangs down in front of each ear. This is uncommon in portrait head repre- sentations - the individual's head is usually wrapped in a head cloth or wearing a head- dress, and if the ears are seen, they are with ear ornaments. In 1994, a large portrait jar was excavated in a tomb at the site of Moche, in the urban sector near the Huaca de La Luna (figs. 25,26). It portrays the same individual illustrated in Figure 9. In this instance, however, he appears to be shown as a captive. His head cloth has been removed and a lock of hair hangs down in front of each ear. Circular depressions in his ear lobes clearly indicate large perfora- tions for the insertion of ear ornaments. The ridge around the upper part of the jar chamber is probably meant to indicate a rope around his neck. It is interesting to consider why high- status individuals who were portrayed in por- trait head vessels were subsequently shown as nude or seminude captives with ropes around their necks and hands tied behind their backs. One might suggest that these individuals were captured by an enemy group during a military engagement, and artists of that group subsequently commemorated their capture by producing portraits of them as prisoners. The difficulty with this explana- tion is that the production of portraiture appears to have been limited to the Chicama, Moche, and Virú valleys, which were unified at least as early as Phase III. Portraits were not produced in peripheral regions that may have been engaged in warfare with these valleys during Phase IV. Moreover, the large portrait jar was found in a pottery-making com- munity at Moche, and was almost certainly produced at that site. All evidence strongly suggests that the portraits of individuals as prisoners were produced by the same potters that made the other portraits of them - not by a foreign group. It is more likely that the combat in which the individuals engaged was not military, but ceremonial, and took place within the three donnan 137</page><page sequence="13">26. Detail of portrait jar, Figure 25 valleys where the portraits are known to have been produced. The ceremonial rather than militaristic nature of Moche combat has been proposed by various scholars (Alva and Don- nan 1993; Donnan 1978; Hocquenghem 1987,- Topic and Topic 1997). Capture and sacrifice of some of the participants would have been the predictable outcome of involvement in this activity. The Moche appear to have been using portraiture as a means of commemorat- ing the capture and sacrifice of specific indi- viduals whose role, status, and appearance were well known in Moche society. As we can now demonstrate that Moche portraits were made of individuals at different stages in their lives, scholars should make every effort to locate all representations of particular people. Not only will this provide fascinating insights into the life histories of specific Moche individuals, but it also will help us to understand further the production, distribution, and function of portraiture in Moche society. 138 DONNAN</page><page sequence="14">NOTES I would like to thank Donna McClelland for her help in developing the Moche Archive at the University of California, Los Angeles, Smiley Karst for her assistance in organizing the sample of portraits that the archive contains, and José Armas for allowing me to photograph and publish the portrait jar that he excavated at Moche (figs. 25, 26). Support for this research has come from the the Harry and Yvonne Lenart Foundation, the Elbridge and Evelyn Stuart Foundation, the Committee on Research of the Academic Senate at the University of California, Los Angeles, and from the University of California President's Research Fellowships in the Humanities. i . This study is based on photographs taken by the author of Moche art in museums and private collec- tions during the past three decades. The photographs, now numbering more than 160,000, are kept in the Moche Archive at the University of California, Los Angeles. 2. Ceramic vessels in the form of human heads date back to the Formative period (c. 1500 b.c.), and continued to occur in most of the ceramic styles that preceded the Moche. 3. Both Rafael Larco (1939: 136) and Alan Sawyer (1966: 37-38) stated that this was the case, but neither provided illustrations to document it. 4. Also seen in many of his portraits are two short parallel scars above his right lip, and/or a short scar on the left side of his lower lip. 5 . Similar containers with spatulas are portrayed in Moche art in the laps of various human and anthropomorphic creatures who are depicted as warriors. The spatulas appear to be used to transfer the contents of the bowl to the mouth of the seated figure, but unfortunately we do not know what the bowl contains (Donnan 1996: 1 40-1 41).
