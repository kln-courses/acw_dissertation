<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis* von David Lorton On the west wall of Hypostyle Hall M of the Temple of Hibis, in the middle register to the right of the doorway to Hypostyle Hall B, there are two pieces of hymnic material that evidently comprised part of the beginning of the daily cult ritual of the temple. One of these, which is the focus of concern here, is an elaborate invocation to the god to awaken (figure l)1. The invocation, loosely related to the hymns calling upon Amun-Re of Karnak to awaken in the surviving papyrus copy of his daily cult ritual2, is elaborate in two ways: in the series of ten "mysterious Great Names" by which the god is invoked, and in the visual organization of the text. The organization is as follows. Three horizontal lies of text identify the ritual and contain its opening words. Just below the left end of these introductory lines, there is a vertical line of text: rsti htpti rs.k m htp rs Imn m cnh m htp rs "Awaken! Be in peace! May you awaken in peace! May Amun awaken in life and in peace! May X awaken ..." When this discussion was substantially completed, in response to an inquiry, Dr. Claude Traunecker most kindly sent me pages from his as yet unpublished "Les Cryptes du temple d'Opet a Karnak", These de l'EPHE, containing his translation of lines 10 to 12 of the hymn treated here, along with some related material. His generosity has allowed me the gratification of acknowledging his priority in regard to some of the suggestions offered here. Other scholars are thanked in the discussion to follow. Here, it is a pleasure to note the thorough ness and collegiality of their responses to my inquiries. 1 Publications: H. Brugsch-Bey, Reise nach der groBen Oase el Khargeh, Leipzig, 1878, PI.

To the right of this vertical line are ten horizontal lines, each containing a description of the god, followed by m rnfn plus a name, and in some cases a further epithet. Each of these lines constitutes a subject (indicated by X above) of the verb rs at the end of the vertical line. These horizontal lines are of unequal length, and at the right end of some of the shorter lines there are single hieroglyphs, spelling out m htp (written htpy, and with a book-roll determinative) "in peace". To help define the ten lines devoted to the invocations, and to complement the vertical line to the left, the initial m is written at the end of the first of these lines, and the book-roll determinative appears at the end of the tenth. The overall invocation was thus repeated ten times, beginning with the</page><page sequence="3">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 16.1 refrain in the left-hand vertical column, its last sentence being "May X awaken in peace3!" Darius' text at Hibis is more or less paralleled by an earlier, somewhat poorly pre served text in the edifice of Taharqa at Karnak (figure 2a)4. There, the opening and closing portions of the invocations are written in horizontal lines5 above and below the ten vertical lines containing the individual invocations. Most of what appears in the introductory lines in the Hibis text also occurs on the wall bearing the Karnak version (figure 2a-b, 11. 1-12), but the formulations are not entirely identical, and there are nine additional lines preceding the invocations. Unfortunately, so much is lost that little connected sense can be made of what remains. It was stated that the Karnak text "more or less" parallels that at Hibis not only because of the additional material just noted, but also because of evident differences in the contents of the invocation lines, with most of these now unfortunately in lacuna. In Goyon's line 20, there is an obscure word or expression in place of the ki-nswt cnh of line 10 (in the line numbering employed here) of the Hibis text, while in Goyon's line 23, the now lost word or words at the beginning of the line do not have a parallel in line 13 of the Hibis version. In the latter, the invocation lines are of varying lengths, which are determined by a combination of their content and the orthographies chosen by 3 For a discussion of the organization of the text, based on the parallel version of Taharqa (see the next note), see M. Smith, in: JEA 74, 1988, 285. Brugsch, Reise, and Scharff, Sonnenlieder, took the invocation lines as a single, continuous text. 4 R.A. Parker et al., The Edifice of Taharqa by the Sacred Lake of Karnak, Providence and London, 1979, PI. 27 (hereafter cited as Edifice of Taharqa); there, a translation by J.-Cl. Goyon is provided on pp. 71-73. So much of the Taharqa version is lost that Goyon produced what is essentially a rendering of the version at Hibis, and it can be added to the translations cited in n. 1 above. A different, but similarly organized set of invocations is to be found on the facade of the sanctuary of the temple of Horus at Edfu; see A.M. Blackman and H.W. Fairman, in: Misc. Gregoriana, 401 410. 5 In the top line, if one assumes that the Old Perfective ending .ti is written with the pestle sign (it is written .tw in the Hibis version), and if one assumes a flat m beneath a it-basket before htp, there is just enough room to read rsti htpti rs.k m in the now lost first half of the line. In the second half, the phrase m htp, which is inserted after m cnh in the Hibis version, does not appear. In the bottom line, m htp appears at the beginning and rs.k Ittp [...] (this does not appear in the Hibis version) is added near the end. From a consideration of symmetry, the words are likely to have been continued to the end of the line, and on the strength of the later parallels at Edfu (see the preceding note) it is proposed here to read htp[ti\, restoring, after the htp sign, a t (bread loaf), a p (stool), and a ti pestle. Unfortunately, in the drawings in the publication, it is not always possible to tell what is a blank spot and what is a lacuna, a problem noted by Smith in the review cited in n. 3 above. Thus, it is not certain whether anything originally appeared in the middle of the line.</page><page sequence="4">162 D.

Lorton SAK 21 the scribe. In Taharqa's version at Karnak, though the ends of six of the ten lines are in lacuna, there is reason to think that the lines were all intended to fill the available space: this much is suggested by the fact that in the bottom portions of Goyon's lines 19 and 20, where the ends of the lines are preserved, extra space has been added between the signs to make the text reach the very ends of the lines. In Goyon's line 18, the end of the preserved material corresponds to the end of the corresponding line 8 of the Hibis version, which is itself one of the two longest lines of that version. In the Karnak version, however, this material occupies only two-thirds of the available space, with the remainder of the line perversely in lacuna. Surely, this entire space was not originally left blank, a supposition that is supported by the fact that in the top part of the line, certain signs are abnormally small, which was likely to have been occasioned by a concern that all the intended material would fit the line. (This oddity, along with the extra spaces between the signs at the ends of Goyon's lines 19 and 20, give the im pression that the text of the invocation lines was poorly prepared by the artisan(s) responsible for its execution, or perhaps even carved directly on the stone with no prior drawing of the signs. In published drawing, lines 1 to 11 appear to be better in quality. These are to the right of a doorway, while the lines under discussion here are to its left, and different artisans might well have been at work.) At the ends of Goyon's lines 15 and 23, there is also room for more material than appears in the Hibis version. In the Taharqa version, nearly one-third of the way down all the invocation lines, there begins a substantial lacuna. The text resumes below the break in Goyon's lines 15 through 23, while the remainders of the first and last invocation lines (Goyon's lines 14 and 24) are lost in their entirety. The signs in this text are not of uniform size, but there is an overall similarity in the size of most of the tall signs that allows for the definition of a "square" for the purposes of this discussion, and the gap running through lines 15 to 23 can be defined as about 4.75 squares. As it happens, the words m rnfn would have occupied the bottom of this gap, except for line 15, where only m rnf would have appeared. In Goyon's line 2, the word rn is determined by a cartouche (as it always is in the Hibis version, though a seated god is also added). If we assume this orthography of rn in the invocation lines as well, and if we assume that the word m was written with an owl-sign, signs preserved in the text suggest that the phrase would have occupied 2.25 squares in the break. The orthography of m rnf n is identical in all the lines at Hibis, but there is no guarantee that this was so in the Taharqa parallel. This problem, along with the other uncertainties alluded to, might make a consideration of what was in this troublesome lacuna seem unproductive, but this is not really so. The ability to determine that the end of the gap in each line (except for line 15) contained a phrase that could have occupied as much as 2.25 squares makes it possible to raise the question of whether the content of the Hibis version could have appeared in what remains. The</page><page sequence="7">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 165 answer, as will be noted in the commentary, is overall in the affirmative. Thus, the quantity (the number of words, not their orthography) of the contents was overall the same in both versions. The variant phrase in Goyon's line 20, noted above, warns that we cannot simply assume that the content was identical, though there is some good chance that it was. The point of all this is to correct a misimpression that could arise from a casual inspection of the Taharqa version and to suggest that the gap running through the invocation lines most likely does not mask significant differences in content that could help account for the fact that die lines of this version were of (evidently) equal length while those of the Hibis version were of quite unequal length. The decision to fill (Taharqua version) or not to fill (Hibis version) die available space in each line was itself an essential arbitrary or aesthetic one. If the lines of the Taharqa version were indeed of equal length, this was not, on the whole, achieved by the addition or deletion of material in the sections of the lines now comprising the large gap, but rather by the other factors already noted: (1) additional textual material in the Taharqa version, at the ends of lines 15, 18 and 23, and at the beginning of line 23, (2) some variability in the size of the signs, and (3) variable space between signs. It was noted above that the first sign of the vertical line reading m htp in the Hibis version occurs at the right end of the first invocation line (here, line 5). In the drawing of the text in Davies' publication, a portion of the left upper corner of the text is separated from the main body of the text by a break, and the surviving parts of the signs r and s of the word rs that begins the left-hand vertical line appear opposite the second (here, line 6) of the invocation lines. Notwithstanding the clue provided by the m at the end of line 5, Assmann, presumably misled by the position of the word rs, connected line 5 with the introductory lines just above it, and rendered the text with only nine invocations6. This is nevertheless understandable, given that he did not have the publication of the edifice of Taharqa at his disposal to verify the physical organization of the text. Barucq and Daumas refer to the latter publication, yet their understanding of the Hibis text at this point is the same as Assmann's7. Even a consideration of the drawing in the Hibis publication must arouse suspicion as to the location of the "fragment". Placed where it is, there is not enough room in the lacuna below it for the full writing of the word rs that appears in its two subsequent occurrences in the vertical line, much less for the .tw (for the Old Perfective ending .ti) that had to have accompanied it. There was indeed an error in the preparation of the 6 AHG, 288. 7 Hymnes et prieres, 310.</page><page sequence="8">166 D.

In line 2, the odd-looking trace at the top of the fragment perfectly suits the water flowing from a pot in a writing of wcb "to be pure; pure; wr?-priest" like that which occurs later in the same line, while the traces in the main body of the text are clearly of the three ripples of water that serve as the determinative of the word. There is a gap between the two restored signs, in point of fact precisely the space needed for a b. Cruz-Uribe has proposed the restoration of kbh here9. While I know of no exact parallel for the statement here, related textual material fails to support kbh and speaks rather in favor of wcb. In the opening utterances of the Berlin Amun ritual, the ritualist makes repeated assurances that he is pure (wcb)10, while a text passage at Kom Ombo similar to the one here states that the divine ritual is performed by wcb c3 m hrwf m wcbf m S "the great wr6-priest in his day when he purifies (himself) in the (sacred) 8 The temple has been collapsing on its foundations; see E.

Davies' photographs from which the drawing was made show the section to the left of the break in the wall lower than the righthand section by a distance nearly equal to the height of one horizontal line of text. When the drawing was prepared, the position of all the elements except the "fragment" of inscription was adjusted to reflect the original appearance of the wall, a circumstance that misled subsequent translators. (Inexplicably, the "fragment" does not appear in Brugsch's hand-copy.) I wish to thank Dr. James P. Allen of the Metropolitan Museum of Art for providing me with a copy of Davies' photograph of the wall area containing this text. Cruz-Uribe, who collated Davies' drawings, signalled the error; see HTP I, 120. 9 Loc.cit. 10 Moret, Rituel du culte, 9-37.</page><page sequence="9">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 167 water11." In line 3, the lacuna is just the right size to accommodate the remainder of hft and rnf, given the size of what is preserved of the signs of these words. At the beginning of the vertical line at the left (here numbered line 4), the new placement of the fragment allows for the full writing of the verb rs, though this leaves only enough room for a writing of the Old Perfective ending .tw with a coil of rope for w, rather than with a quail chick, as in btp.tw just below. At the left end of the first horizontal invocation line (here numbered line 5), something appears that might seem to be a hieroglyph. The shape of what is drawn, together with a willingness to see the evident falcon sign as an aleph vulture (and a willingness to ignore the implication of the stroke after the bird sign) is perhaps what led Goyon to render the beginning of the line as "[he whom those who are in the nomes see(?)]12." The initial signs of these lines are not in exact alignment, and I would take the curved mark in the drawing to represent a break in the wall surface. Cruz-Uribe's rendering of the beginning of the line13 shows that in his collation of the text, he did not see a hieroglyph here. It is only the beginning of line 1 that cannot be restored with the help of the new placement of the fragment. Though Brugsch reproduced the word Scw(t)u where the first preserved word is shown partly in lacuna in Davies' publication, the lack of the feminine ending t is suspicious (though hardly decisive), and it is difficult to arrive at a suitable restoration containing this word at the beginning of the line. With some reserve, because Brugsch might have seen a sign that had disappeared by the time Davies photographed the wall, I would propose to restore nt-c "ritual", which leads to the suggestion that the first word of the line was sSm "conducting". The word would just suit the available space, whether as shown in figure 3 (after a writing in line 32 on the same wall), or whether written with an owl m with walking legs above and behind it15. 11 De Morgan et al., Kom Ombos I, 39, no 36. A parallel text reads wcb ci m hrwfm-ht ir(t) cbwfm ? wcb "the great wr&amp;-priest in his day after the making of his purification in the pure water"; see ibid., 165, no. 210a. On these passages, see also B. Gessler-Lohr, Die heiligen Seen agyptischer Tempel, HAB 21, 306-307. On the ritual bathing of priests, see S. Schott, Die Reinigung Pharaohs, NAWG 1957/3, 80-84. 12 Edifice of Taharqa, 71. 13 HTP I, 120. 14 Reise, PI. XV. It is perhaps this reading which inspired the rendering "[Li]vre secret" of Barucq and Daumas, Hymnes et prieres, 309, as well as Cruz-Uribe's "[Bo]ok of the secrets," HTP I 120. 15 For nt-c "ritual," see Faulkner, CD, 152 and J.-Cl.

Lorton SAK 21 The misplaced "fragment"; unavailability until relatively recently of the Taharqa version, which supplies some helpful readings; evident errors in the text that have gone unrecognized; and the contentual difficulties inherent in Egyptian religious texts have caused problems in the translations to date, thus warranting a fresh attempt at this time. In the translation and commentary that follow, the focus will be on attempting to establish, to the extent possible, the sense of the text; differences with previous translators will not be much belabored. The commentary will be supplemented by a discussion of the organization of the invocations, as well as additional structural questions.

Commentary a) In lines 5 through 12, there are blank spaces at the ends of many of the lines, because each invocation is accorded a separate line, and the invocations are of different lengths. That phenomenon cannot explain the long blank space at the end of line 1, which is part of a continous statement running through line 2 and approximately half of line 3. There is also the problem of the failure of the text to provide an indication of the speaker. These problems can be resolved by proposing a lacuna in the papyrus Vorlage large enough that the artisan felt unable to restore its contents. There is no reason to think that such an artisan would have had a great deal of specifically religious knowledge, aside from what he might have happened to remember from working on previous projects, and in Hibis' remote location, there could easily have been no source of information. Thus, I would suggest that he calculated the approximate space needed to accommodate the lost material, and that he left the space blank with the intention that it would be filled in later, an intention that of course was never fulfilled. From the beginning of the Berlin Amun ritual, we know that the officiant of the daily cult ritual was called the wcb c3 imy hrwf "the great wrfe-priest who is in his day"; see Moret, Rituel du culte, 7. Cf. also the parallels at Kom Ombo cited in n. 11 above.

Lorton SAK 21 Horus and Thoth are associated in the texts of the purification and advancing toward the naos that open the Berlin Amun ritual; see Moret, op.cit., 16 and 21. They are also associated at the beginning of the ritual at Edfu; see M. Alliot, Le Culte d'Horus a Edfou I, BE 20/1, 140-142 and 144 (hereafter cited as Culte d'Horus). Particularly if we are to restore wcb c3 imy hrwf at the end of line 1, what we have here contradicts the assertion by H.R. Nelson (apud A. Gardiner, in: JEA 36, 1950, 8) that scenes of the "baptism of Pharaoh" by Horus and Thoth (and sometimes also Seth and Dwn-Cnwy) are unrelated to the daily temple service. It can easily be imagined that especially elaborate purification ceremonies were performed when the king himself presided over a cult celebration, but it would seem that the quotidian purifications of the officiating priest were conceived of as being of the same or a similar nature. b) I.e., Amun of Karnak. c) For hft "according to", see Wb. Ill, 274.10-12. "Great names" ist written rnfwrw.fi as though the first word were singular. In the Taharqa parallel, the plural rnwf is followed by what would seem to be three words. These are mostly in lacuna, though ci[w] was evidently the second word. d) The reading htip "hidden" is confirmed by the Taharqa version, as noted by Barucq and Daumas, Hymnes et pridres, 310, n. d). Msw, with its divine determinative, has been rendered "children" in previous translations, which yields no real sense in context. The word is surely msw(t) "forms", which is attested elsewhere, as here, in parallelism or association with hprw\ see Wb. II, 141.14. On this sense of msw(t), cf. a passage from the temple of Ramesses II at Abydos, where it is said that the ennead are depicted m mswt.sn kmi(wt).n Ptfr m shvt nt Dhwty r dt.sn "in their forms which Ptah had created from the writings of Thoth concerning their bodies" (P. Boylan, Thoth: The Hermes of Egypt, Chicago, 1987 (reprint ed.), 90). (On dt "body, embodiment, likeness," see E.A.E. Reymond, in: Fs Daumas II, 555; for a cult statue as the dt "body" of a deity, cf. also Urk. IV, 99.12.) The phrase is evidently inspired by imn rn.f r msw.f of the daily cult ritual, where in the Berlin Amun ritual at least, imn could be taken as a pun on the divine name; see Moret, Rituel du culte, 132. This occurs in one of the hymns invoking Amun to awaken, and in its context, it is not really possible to judge whether msw means "children" or "forms", though I suspect the latter. Interestingly, in the related material from Edfu, Horus of Edfu is called upon to awaken under several descriptive phrases serving as epithets, one of them being imn(w) rn.fi r nrtw s?t3(w) sSmf r rhyt "whose name is hidden from the gods, whose image is (kept) secret from the 'commoners' "; see Black</page><page sequence="13">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 171 man and Fairman, in: Misc. Gregoriana, 402, fig. 2, 1. 15. Again, the limited context is ambiguous. Ntrw could easily refer to cult statues (see W. Spiegelberg, in: ZAS 65, 1930, 119-121 and H. Goedicke; in: JARCE 8, 1969-1970, 69, with n. 3), and the passage thus might have the same implication as what is suggested here for the Hibis text. While statements to the effect that the solar creator god is unknowable by men, and even by gods, do indeed occur in religious texts, the context in all three instances cited here is a cultic one in which the statue is being addressed, and a statement regarding the relationship between the god himself and his cult image would be rather more in order. e) That these are the first of the words to be spoken is confirmed by the Taharqa parallel, which inserts dd-mdw before them. This and the following clause correspond to wn ciwy pt sS ciwy ti ... wn ciwy pt psd Psdt Iryr st.sn "the double doors of heaven are opened, the double doors of earth are unclosed ... when the double doors of heaven are opened, the Ennead shine in their place(s)" in the "utterance of revealing the face" that follows each of the two openings of the double doors of the naos in the Berlin Amun ritual; see Moret, Rituel du culte, 49 and 113. In this hymn, however, the verb is sS; see Cruz-Uribe, HTP I, 120, n. 650. Hr-si ti has been understood as here by all except Scharff (Sonnenlieder, 88), who translated hr-si impressionistically as "uber" rather than "auf. The sentences in the daily cult ritual mythologize the opening of the doors of the naos as the opening of "doors" through which the solar creator god passes at daybreak16. As worded, the reference here is to "the double doors of heaven" specifically as the naos doors in the temple, thus "upon earth". For ciwy (n) pt with this meaning in temple context, see J. Cerny, in: JEA 34, 1948, 120. (Here, it is uncertain whether hr-si ti is adverbial, or whether it is adjectival, modifying ciwy n pt. The wording ciwy n pt hr-si ti recalls ptf tp ti "his heaven on earth" in reference to the sacred area of Karnak; see J.-M. Kruchten, Les Annales des pretres de Karnak (XXI-XXIPes dynasties) et autres textes contemporains relatifs k l'initiation des pretres d'Amon, OLA 32, 76, n.

I agree after a fashion, but it seems quite possible that it is participation in the daily cult that is described by this phrase, and I would prefer a differently nuanced interpretation so as to avoid a potential misimpression based on more contemporary conceptions of spirituality. Given the equation of the restricted area of a temple with heaven, and given the equation of the doors of a naos containing</page><page sequence="14">172 D. Lorton SAK 21 0 Cruz-Uribe, who has collated the text, has corrected the three plural strokes in Davies' publication into three raZ-signs; see HTP I, 120, n. 651. This was also the reading of Brugsch, Reise, PI. XV. 8) Especially given the cult context, and considering the related psd Psdt lir st.sn "The Ennead shine in their place(s)" of the Berlin Amun ritual (see n. e above), hprw here should be a reference to cult statues; for this usage, see Wb. Ill, 266.4. I would interpret the second line of the inscription, then, as referring to the time of sunrise, when the sun emerged from the "double doors" of heaven and when the doors of the temples and of the naoi within them were opended and the sunlight illumined the cult statues, regenerating the waking divine essences in them; see R.B. Finnestad, Image of the World and Symbol of the Creator, Studies in Oriental Religions 10, 111-113. It is just after the doors are opened that the prinzipal god of the temple is called upon to awaken, along with the other deities, in the Berlin Amun ritual. The thought, then, bridges the end of the introductory description and the opening of the words to be spoken. It is in this cultic context that one must understand what is meant by "all his mysterious (Stiw) great names" and their specification as "hidden from his forms". The names in question are surely the ten in the invocation lines that follow, and these are certainly not "secret" or "confidential"18. The word rn refers not only to a "name" as a label, but also to the, or an, essential "quality"; see A. Piankoff, Litany of Re, 3-6. In each of the invocations, a descriptive element is followed by m rn.fi n "in his name of plus a divine name, and I would take the rn of rn wr in both its senses, referring to the qualitative and labeling aspects of these "names". I would therefore suggest that the Sti nature of these names/qualities, which were "hidden" from the statues during the sun's absence at night, lay in their "mysterious" power to effect the regeneration of the cult statues at daybreak. a cult statue with the doors of heaven, straightforward cult activity certainly entailed an experience of the divine presence, but it is difficult to say whether or not it necessarily entailed the experience described by Kruchten. One aspect of the issue is that of the phenomenon of the "parallel universes" of human cult activity and the divine realm raised by B.M. Bryan, in: BiOr 46, 1989, 580-582. In the minds of the priestly participants, an actual merging of the two realms might have been restricted to occasions of playing a divine role, perhaps especially when this involved wearing a mask; on the last, see A. Wolinski, DE 6, 1986, 47-53 and Archaeology 40/1, January/February 1987, 22-29. 18 On the range of meanings of St3 and sSti in religious and secular contexts, see H. Altenmuller, in: LA II, 510-513, s.v. "Geheimnis" and J. Baines, in JARCE 27, 1990, 1-23.</page><page sequence="15">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 173 If my interpretation of a difficult passage in the Instruction for Merikare is correct, it contains the earliest reference to the problematic of the relationship between a god and a cult statue - the statue both is and is not the deity - and describes it as something akin to an illusion; see DE 26, 1993, 13-23. h) In Davies' publication, the line begins with a curved mark that I take to be a small break in the stone; see the introductory remarks above. Next, the drawing shows a vulture and a stroke determinative. The rendering here reflects this reading; for i "bird", see Wolf, Kunst, 395 and A. Gardiner, in: JEA 34, 1948, 1219. I would, however, hazard the suggestion that there is an error here, either an ancient or a modern one, and that we should understand a falcon plus stroke determinative, as in line 2 above and lines 10 and 12 below, and thus a reference to Horus. Imyw-spiwt, so far as I know, has no parallel. In context, it ought to refer to either humans or deities, and I agree with Barucq and Daumas (Hymnes et prieres, 71, n. e) and Cruz-Uribe (HTP I, 120, n. 652) in understanding the latter. For support, Cruz-Uribe refers to spityw "those of the nomes", Wb. IV, 99.12, attested in reference to deities in the Pyramid Texts. Perhaps a better parallel is ntrw spiwt "the gods of the nomes". According to Wb. IV, 98.17, this expression occurs in the Ptolemaic period, but it is in fact much earlier; see CT VII, 464e. On the Rosetta Stone, ntrw spiwt in line 7 of the hieroglyphic text is rendered by hoi alloi theoi "the other gods" in line 40 of the Greek; this is the evident significance of imyw spiwt here. 0 Ki cic Nwn also seems to be a unique expression. Goyon takes ki here as indicating "chief, master", and cic Nwn as "designation of Thebes as a place of creation"; see Edifice of Taharqa, 71, n. 23. The location of cic Nwn is not confined to Thebes, however (see E. Drioton, in: ASAE 41, 1941, 28), and since the hymn is addressed to Amun-Re of Karnak and Hibis, it might be the case that Hibis was also thought to be the site of the outpouring of creation. cic is a term for a "source" or "outpouring," whether of water (see H. Kees, in: ZAS 57, 1922, 114) or of semen (see J. Borghouts, The Magical Texts of Papyrus Leiden I 348, OMRO 51, 99, n. 174 and R. Ritner, in: JARCE 27, 1990, 33, with n. 28). It is thus at least possible that the image here combines "bull" and "outpouring, ejaculation" to stress the creative force as sexual in nature, for which cf. already Pyr. 1248. 19 The meaning is proposed on the basis of a single occurrence on the stela Louvre C 14, line 10. Some scholars have preferred to emend here; see the translations collected by W. Barta, Das Selbstbezeugnis eines agyptischen Kunstlers, MAS 22, 80-82.</page><page sequence="16">174 D. Lorton SAK 21 In the Taharqa parallel, the determinative of sti plus tiwy is followed by the ki (bull) sign and the initial c of cic. The remainder of the line is lost; in the portion corres ponding to the 4.75-square lacuna of the following lines, there is room for the remainder of cic plus Nwn m rnf n, especially if Nwn was written as in Goyon's line 18, but without the /mv-sign as determinative. Notwithstanding the unique expressions in this line and uncertainties as to their precise nuances, the overall meaning seems clear. As the sun-god Re, Amun is declared to be preeminent over the other gods, and the creator. j) cnh-mswt (Wb. I, 195.4) is a relatively rare expression in late texts. A. Gutbub cites examples that seem to refer to the birth of a god; see Textes fondamentaux de la th^ologie de Kom Ombo I, BdE 27/1, 239, n. f (hereafter cited as Textes fonda mentaux). There are passages, however, that show it to be an alternative expression for wfrm-rnp "to become young again", used of the sun and the moon (Wb. I, 341.8-9)20: Hr Bhdty wbn cnh-msw(t) hpr sSp (var. psd) m st-brwyf ir hd m w3w3w n itnfshd t3wy tp dw3(y)t sfiy Spsy wbn m hr(t) Bhdt "Horus of Edfu, who shines, living of births, who becomes light (var.

VIII, 25, no. 29b). In the latter passage, the first two epithets are obviously solar in reference, while the remainder is lunar, reflecting attested juxtapositions of the synchretisms Khonsu-Re and Khonsu-Thoth; see H. Bonnet, RARG, 142, s.v. "Chons". The reference is clearly to the lunar cycle, which could be the case in the Hibis passage under consideration here, though it also could refer to the fresh appearance of the moon each evening, as shown by the occurrence of whm-mswt cited in n. 20, and by the use of the verb msi in one of the accompanying addresses to the bas of Amun, "you are his disk in the night, who shines when he is born (ms.tw.fi)" (Hibis III, PI. XXXI, line 33). The choice must . remain uncertain, though the underlying reference to periodic (whether daily or monthly) renewal is clear. See also M. Smith, in: JEA 74, 1988, 285. 20 Wb. I, 341.3-7 does not list such a meaning for whm-mswt, but cf. wnn ... ich hrd hr whm mswt rnpi n rc nb "(As) the boy moon repeats births, rejuvenated every day", Medinet Habu V, PI. 255, left. 21 I take st-brw(y) to be a compound formation of the type listed in Faulkner, CD, 206-207.</page><page sequence="17">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 175 Hnt is rendered here as a preposition, though the writing might stand for the nisbe hnt(y). (The Taharqa version has, less correctly, hntt.) Comparison with two passages in the accompanying addresses to the bas of Amun helps to justifiy the rendering "in" (cf. Wb. Ill, 303.18-20): "Amun, ba who is in (imy) his right eye, namely his disk in heaven every day, forever, as you pass everlastingly, rising and setting; you are Amun, you are Atum, you are Osiris in (m-hit) his left eye as the regulator of Thoth, you are his disk in the night" (Hibis III, PL XXXI, 11. 32-33) and "Amun, ba who is in (imy) his left eye, Yah in the night and ruler of the stars in order to divide seasons, months and years as he comes living everlastingly, rising and setting" (ibid. 11. 36-37). In these references to the solar and lunar eyes, hnt and m-hit clearly function as variants of imy22. k) Or, "who loves everyone". I} In Davies' publication, there is a narrow vertical lacuna after rnf that could, to judge by its size and shape, be filled by ci "great". But Dr. Cruz-Uribe, who has collated the text, reports that the drawing in the publication is in error here (personal communication dated 28 February, 1993). This line is the only one to employ an adjective modifying the noun rn in the expression m rnf n. Something special must be intended, and an easy solution presents itself. The expression ntr ibw hityw "god of minds and hearts" is surely a reference to Thoth as god of wisdom and knowledge (see, e.g., D. Kurth, in: LA VI, 506, s.v. "Thot"). The text appears, then, to be playing on the syncretism icli-Dhwty (see RARG, 355-356, s.v. "Joh") and thus making a scarcely-veiled allusion (though it is unclear what the motive for doing this might be) to the god Thoth. The suggestion makes sense in context, because the mention of Re in the preceding line ought to be paralleled by a reference to another important god, and not the relatively minor deity Yah. For convenience, ibw hityw has been rendered as "minds and hearts" according to the Old and Middle Kingdom meanings of these terms; see A. Piankoff, Le "Coeur" dans les textes egyptiens, Paris, 1930, 1-13 and B. long, in: Fs Daumas II, 484-485. However, Piankoff notes that the distinction between ib as the mind and hity as the physical organ was not maintained with absolute rigor even in those periods, and while the distinction is undoubtedly intended here, the correct interpretation could easily be the other way around. 22 Helping to assure the interpretation is the first part of the legend accompanying the second ba of Amun in the north crypt of the temple of Opet, "Amun, ba in (m) his left eye." Again, I am in debt to Dr. Traunecker for communicating this to me.</page><page sequence="18">176 D. Lorton SAK 21 The underlying nuance of mnh seems to have no single equivalent in modern western languages, and ad hoc renderings in context can seem uncomfortably vague. J.P. Allen's suggestion that the basic meaning is "functional" (Genesis in Egypt, Yale Egyptological Studies 2, 89, n. to 1. 19) could be correct, and it is particularly apt in the present con text, which stresses the common name of the moon. Rn mnh here might be intended as something of a variant, in divine context, of rn nfir (Wb. II, 428.6-13); cf: also rn wr in line 2 above. In the Taharqa parallel, in the 4.75-square lacuna, there seems to be adequate room for writings of mr hr nb m rn.fi At the end of the line, there is a lacuna of two squares below the phonetic signs of hity; it is possible that there was a fuller writing of the word than in the Hibis text. m) 7S?.f tiw is the only one of the descriptions here to employ a sdmf form, along the lines of the name 7w.s-ci.s. The reading is secure from the Taharqa variant, in which tiw is spelled out and the drawing shows a mostly preserved ./just above the word. This rules out the possibility of an emendation to *i??(w) &lt;n&gt;fw, tempting though that might otherwise be. The usual rendering of ?Jvf as "to spit" (Wb. I, 135.14-15) seems unsuitable in the context of winds or air, which ought rather to be exhaled. It is possible, then, that the Egyptian word refers to both spitting and exhaling, and Assmann's rendering "aushusten" (AHG, 289) has been followed here. In the Taharqa parallel, the first three squares are mostly in lacuna. The published drawing shows traces of a reed leaf in the top middle and most of an/just below the lacuna. The intervening space is barely enough for a writing of the remainder of iSS, though this is clearly the word that appeared here. n) While the expression srk htyt is a common one (see Wb. IV, 202.6-12), srk m kbbt occurs in line 13 below, and kbbt could thus be the reading of the ideogram here. Because of lacunae, the Taharqa version affords no information as to the reading in either line. 0) For other occurrences of mn(w) m ht nb, see Goyon, Edifice of Taharqa, 71, n. 27. The participle of the expression forms a pun on the name Imn, as noted by Barucq and Daumas (Hymnes et pri&amp;res, 311), perhaps expressing the belief that his substance (here, specifically air) is immanent or latent in his creation. The expression occurs, however, even when the word swh "air" appears in place of "Amun"; see the passages collected by K. Sethe, Amun, 90-116. Thus, notwithstanding the ability to create a pun in the present context, the epithet and the idea behind it had a life of their own.</page><page sequence="19">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 177 In the Taharqa parallel, the published drawing shows a small circle and the top of a vertical stroke just above the 4.75-square lacuna; these might be the top of the signs of the preposition hr. There is ample room in the lacuna for writings of hr srk htyt m rnf n. In the immediately following Imn mn(w) m ht nb, the first two words are given abbre viated writings. The oval shown in the drawing is for the oval with a ripple of water as a writing of Imn; see Wb. I, 84. The next sign, drawn to look something like the di sign, must be for the mortar-and-pestle sign, serving as ideogram for mn; see Wb. II, 60. p) Parallels to expressions in this line occur in the accompanying addresses to the bas of Amun: "You are Amun, you are Shu, you are higher than all the gods, you are the Holy-of-forms as the four winds of the sky, one says, when they emerge from the mouth of his majesty, the ba of Shu who directs the winds as the (divine) bark crosses the sky every day, living in lifting of Shu as far as the circuit of the sky" (Hibis III, PI. XXXI, 11. 37-39) and "Amun, b3 of Shu, who traverses in the uplifted (i.e., the sky), separating the sky from the earth, as he endures in everything, the living one from whom one lives, forever" (ibid., 11. 43-44). For "ba of Shu" as the air and similar formulations indicating elements, see C. de Wit, Le Role et le sens du lion, 2d ed. (1979), 204. In the Taharqa parallel, there is a lacuna of just over two squares at the end of the line. It is likely that something further was written there, especially in light of the abbreviated writings of Imn and mn(w) above that help to create this space. One possibility is ntrt nbt; cf. the occurrence of the expression along with ntr nb in Goyon's line 10. q) Goyon interprets hcw "flesh" as "incarnation"; see Edifice of Taharqa, 71, with n. 28. Hcw can occur in contexts describing the emergence of things from a god's body (Wb. HI, 38.18), and one could see a chthonic reference here; cf. a passage in a "spell for becoming barley" in the Coffin Texts: N pn bit tw n cnh prt m Wsir rdt hr sprw n(y)w Wsir "This N. is the grain-wisp of life which comes forth from Osiris, which grows upon the ribs of Osiris ..." (CT IV, 6 c-e). The compound expression hcw-ntr, however, is attested in reference to water (Wb. Ill, 39.5), and a passage from the hymn to Amun of P. Leiden I 350 would support such an interpretation here, which also seems called for by the mention of bch and Nwn-wr in the line itself: mtwtfht n cnh rdwfNpi "the plant of life is his semen, Nep(er)i is his efflux"; see J. Zandee, De Hymnen aan Amon van Papyrus Leiden I 350, PI. V, 11. 24-25. r) Ht n cnh is an image for plant life serving as food, especially grain; see Wb. Ill, 342.3-4, and cf. the texts cited in the previous note.</page><page sequence="20">178 D. Lorton SAK 21 In the Taharqa parallel, the first three squares of the line are mostly in lacuna. There is an cnh sign at the top left; presumably, it was preceded by three flesh signs, thus producing a direct genitive hcw-cnh, rather than the indirect genitive /*rw n cnh of the Hibis version. Just below the lacuna is what could be the bottom of an cnh sign; the drawing seems to show traces on either side of it, but these might just be random marks of wear. Between, there does not seem to be enough space for the remainder of the phrase kmi(w) ht n cnh of the Hibis version, even if the tall signs were made quite small, as are those just below the lacuna. It is possible that the Taharqa version substituted ir(w) "who made" for kmi(w), or that there was no participle. s) In the Taharqa version, the head-and-neck sign serving as a determinative for words like htyt and kbbt (see lines 7 and 13 of the present text) is inserted as an ideogram before the participle bch(w). Goyon took the sign as an ideogram for the verb cm "to swallow, to know" and rendered "who knows what overflows the Two Lands"; see Edifice of Taharqa, 71. I agree with his reading, but not with his interpretation. The Speos Artemidos inscription of Hatshepsut supplies an interesting metaphorical use of cm: liwt-ntr n nbt Ksy witi rfih cm.n t3 hm.s ?ps(y) "The temple of the mistress of Cusae was fallen into ruin, the earth having swallowed up her august shrine" (Urk. IV, 386.4 5). This image applied to sand seems equally applicable in the present context to the effects of the Nile inundation, and I would thus propose to render "swallower who floods the Two Lands". Considering the reference to Nwn-wr at the end of the line, bch surely refers to the inundation; cf. Wb. I, 448.11 and 449.11-13. For the association of Neperi and Hapy as personifications of grain and the inundation in another late text, see J. Baines, Fecundity Figures (1985), 113. Returning to the Taharqa parallel, Npri, cm and bch are all written with curiously small signs. f) To the sentiments "enduring in everything" and "without whom there is no life" in lines 7 and 8 here should be compared the following passages from later texts: swh n cnh m find iht nbt lirf mwt.sn "the breath of life in the nose of everything (or, "everyone"); (if) he is distant, they die"23 (de Morgan et al., Kom Ombos I, 87, no. 107, 11. 2-3; cf.

Goyon et al., in: JARCE 20, 1983, 54, text I). These passages show that the concept of the essence of the creator permeating the cosmos and the concept of the divine essence permeating the cult statue were so much alike that they could be expressed in the same terms. Since the text discussed here was a part of the daily cult ritual and was addressed to the statue, this double meaning could well apply here. In the Taharqa parallel, the lacuna of 4.75 squares is enough to contain a writing of m-hmf, but there is not enough additional room for both m-Snw tiwy and m rnf n. Perhaps the simple preposition m "in" took the place of the compound proposition of the Hibis version. u) On Nwn-wr and for examples of Amun identified with him, see Sethe, Amun, 70 and 74. The appellation is used especially of the inundation; see Wb. II, 215.14. In Brugsch's copy of the inscription, his line 6 contains most of what is numbered as line 8 here, followed by the divine name from line 9 as numbered here, so that most of the latter line is omitted in both his copy and his translation. The error was corrected already by Scharff, Sonnenlieder, 88, with the help of a copy made by G. Roeder. This is one of the longest lines in the Hibis version, completely filling its space. In the Taharqa parallel, in view of what was stated in the three previous notes in regard to less full writings and small hieroglyphs at the beginning of the line, it is remarkable that after the material to this point the line contains seven further squares, most unfortunately, all in lacuna. Obviously there was more text, and the writings near the top of the line were chosen to help accommodate it. What happened at Hibis is difficult to say. The additional text might simply have been absent from its version. Alternatively, if it was hopelessly in lacuna in the artisan's Vorlage, orthographies were selected for the remainder to fill out the line. v) In the Taharqa version of the text, b3 is written with a jabiru bird, while in the Hibis version, it is written with a ram. These signs can alternate in the writing system (see Wb. I, 411 and 414), and as Goyon points out, since the nighttime sun is both the ba of Re and a ram-headed figure, either sense yields an appropriate understanding; see Edifice of Taharqa, 72, with n. 32. As stated in the previous note, Brugsch did not copy or translate the first part of this line. Cruz-Uribe renders the opening words as "The ba who is in them, its mhnt (sic) serpent" (HIP I, 121), the sense of which eludes me. While the other translators do not discuss the writing imyw, it is clear from their renderings that they take it as an error for</page><page sequence="22">180 D. Lorton SAK 21 the singular imy, with which I concur. The addition of plural strokes might have been inspired by a variant (or erroneous) writing imw for imy; cf. G. Nagel, in: BIFAO 29, 1929, 19. If the plural form was intended to have a meaning, it would likely have been "ba of those in the Mehen (or Mehnet)", referring to the enemies of the sun god imprisoned in the coils of the "Umringlerschlange"; see R. Ritner, in: JNES 43, 1984, 219-220 and P.A. Piccione, in: JARCE 27, 1990, 44. This is apparently an inferior sense, however, for there is no evident reason for referring to the sun god as their ba or their ram. In the Taharqa parallel, the word ba is followed by a lacuna of one and one-half squares, below which is what seems to be most of an elaborate Mhn-sign. This is insufficient room for both imy and the consonantal signs of Mhn: either m stood in the place of imy, or - perhaps more likely, since imy-Mhn(t)fwdiS a standard expression - the name Mhn was written with the Mhnsign serving as an ideogram. While it is evidently the masculine Mhn-serpent that appears in the Taharqa parallel, the Hibis version reflects a variant tradition in which the serpent was taken to be feminine. This phenomenon, attested since the New Kingdom, has received some comment, but there does not seem to be agreement as to what it represents. A. Gardiner (pHier. BM (Gardiner) I, 30, n. 6) and S. Sauneron (in: BIFAO 53, 1953, 74, n. 28) take the "Umringlerschlange" to be feminine in gender, without comment on the development from a masculine form. Hornung (Amduat II, 130) notes the development of a feminine form but offers no explanation. B.H. Strieker (De grote zeeslang, MVEOL 10, 7-8) explains the phenomenon as an identification of the Af/m-serpent of the heavenly ocean with the mhnt-umeus wrapped around the brow of the king. The passage that elicited Gardiner's comment proceeds to identify the mhnt with the uraeus on the brow of Re, and also with the goddesses Renenutet and Iusaas; the first of these identifications perhaps is intended to call to mind the uraeus that, starting in the New Kingdom, is sometimes carefully depicted in two-dimensional representations completely encircling the sun disk on the head of Re; cf. e.g., V. Ions, Egyptian Mythology (1968), 43, 49, 65 and 108. In the papyrus studied by Nagel (op.cit., PI. I), a vignette labelled Rc imy mhntf shows the falconheaded sun god seated, while "floating" above him and partly enveloping him with its tail is a uraeus that is practically an enlarged hieroglyph. (In the label, only a uraeus appears as an ideogram, but the wording of the phrase suggests the reading m\}nt, and I concur with Nagel's interpretation.) These two examples suggest less a simple identification, as Strieker would have it, than that the image of the mhnt-umeus was multivalent, while otherwise, the "Umringlerschlange" could be thought of as either masculine or feminine in gender. The form of the word in the present text must be called into question, however. It is *mhnhwt, a curious conflation of mhnyt (Wb. II, 129.4-6) and mnhyt (Wb. II, 84.3-9),</page><page sequence="23">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 181 both words for "uraeus". Perhaps just by accident, the writing also reflects the older spelling of mnhyt as mnhwt in die Coffin Texts, on which see D. Meeks, in: LA IV, 48, s.v. "Menhit." (By coincidence, a writing that looks like *mhnh is listed Wb. II, 129, but in this case the \x seems rather to be a phonetic complement of the mh-sign.) The same writing, though not in reference to the female incarnation of the Af/w-serpent, occurs on the south end of the same west wall as the present text (Hibis III, PI. XXXII, 11. 8-9) and on the adjacent south wall of the room (ibid., PI. XXXIII, 11. 29-30). I doubt that *mhnftwt has an independent status as yet another lexeme for "uraeus", and I suspect that it is an error caused by the end of the word Mhn or mhn(y)t being in lacuna in the hieratic Vorlage of the text, prompting, as it happens, an incorrect attempt at a restoration. Since there is some reason to think that as the work of decoration proceeded around this room, the west wall was decorated before the south wall (see note aj below), I would propose that an erroneous restoration in the present text led to a hypercorrection of the other two occurrences of the word. w) The image of the two iht-eyes, determined with two wdit eyes, could well allude to the two uraei of the solar god; cf. H. Bonnet, RARG, 846, s.v. "Uraus" and K. Martin, LA VI, 865, s.v. "Uraus". The same imagery is turned to a different purpose in the hymn on the south wall of the room: "ba (written with the jabiru bird) who shines from his two wdit-eyss, miraculous of sacred forms (hpm&gt;), who is not known, luminous of forms (irw), who reveals himself through his two iht-eyes, without his mystery being known" (Hibis III, PI. XXXIII, 11. 7-8). As in line 3 of the present text, the reference is to light as the medium effecting the mysterious relationship between the god or his ba(s) and his cult statues. In the Taharqa parallel, the writings of this phrase seem designed to save space. The hieroglyphs comprising the verb psd are rather squeezed together; further, the verb is written with a d rather than a d, and the determinative is a simple sun sign with no rays. Also saving space, the ribs sign is used for m, rather than the owl that is more common in this text, and instead of ihty.fy there is irtf "his eye", itself written with a pupil and a t next to it and a simple eye sign below as determinative. The single eye could also be an allusion to a uraeus; see Bonnet, RARG, 735, s.v. "Sonnenauge". x) The wording suggests the iconography of the "aura" indicated by the brazier hiero glyphs arched over the "pantheistic Bes" figures on a magical papyrus in Brooklyn, one of whom is named Re-Kheperi-Atum; see S. Sauneron, Le Papyrus magique illustre de Brooklyn (1970), frontispiece and figs. 2-3. While the demon is an avatar of Re, the iconography is not common with the sun god himself. However, for an instance of braziers surrounding the nighttime Osiris/Re (who is, of course, the figure invoked in</page><page sequence="24">182 D. Lorton SAK 21 this line) on a papyrus of Dyn. XXI date, see E. Hornung, Idea into Image (1992), 109. This phrase and the two preceding all play on the same idea, for the Mehen, the uraeus, and the eye(s) of Re were all the sources of, or representative of, the fiery blast that surrounded the nighttime sun; see R. Ritner, in: JARCE 27, 1990, 34-39. This is in fact confirmed by an allusion in the accompanying addresses to the has of Amun, where the small lacuna can be filled in with the help of the parallel version in Edifice of Taharqa, PI. 28A, 11. 8-9: Snfnb m nbi m [tk3] n irty.fiy) shid.nf Sn nptm ^wty.fiy) "... his entire circumference being ablaze with the flame of his two eyes when he has lit the circuit of the heaven with his two plumes" (another clear allusion in context to the two eyes; see also Moret, Rituel du culte, 47); see Hibis III, PI. XXXI, 11. 23-24. In the Taharqa version, though tk3 is written as a singular, the indirect genitive is written with a nw pot, which also appears in the Hibis version. As it happens the possibility of filling in the lacuna was missed by Cruz-Uribe, HTP I, 122. On the nuance of m ti "in the earth", which sometimes alludes to the netherworld and thus to the nighttime journey of the sun, see now J.G. Griffiths, in: JEA 74, 1988, 277 278. In the Taharqa parallel, phr sw tk3.fi m ti m rnf n could only have been accommodated in the 4.75-square lacuna with the help of abbreviated writings and small hieroglyphs. It is also possible that the phrase m ti was omitted. Complicating matters is a vertical narrow sign in the published drawing just above the lacuna. A xerox of a contact print of the Oriental Institute photograph of the wall area, kindly sent along to me by Dr. John A. Larson, clearly shows that the crack in the wall running vertically through the top of this line is rather wider than what is indicated by the hatching in the drawing; in short, what appears in the drawing would seem to be the left portion of the p of phr. y) For comment on the varied applications of the appellation Rs-wdi, see B. van de Walle, in: ZAS 98, 1972, 140-149. Van de Walle notes occasional applications of the epithet to Amun, including the present passage, and to the solar deity; see ibid., 144 145. However, since the reference here is to the nighttime form of the amalgamated Osiris/Re, the allusion here is principally Osirian. In the Taharqa parallel, there is ample room for a divine determinative in the lacuna following Rs-wdi. z) As noted by Cruz-Uribe, the light in the present context is the light of dawn; see HTP I, 121. For the word in reference to the brilliant, dazzling, or even blinding light of the sun, see J.P. Allen, Genesis in Egypt. 82, note to 1. 32. Given the Osirian connection here, cf. also Wb. IV, 283, 12.</page><page sequence="25">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 183 Since sSp is connected here with the course of the sun, it is worth noting a much earlier occurrence, in the Instruction for Merikare: irf sSp n-ib.sn skddf r mii st "he made the light for their (humankind's) sake, and he sails in order to see them"; see A. Volten, Zwei altagyptische politische Schriften, AnAe 4, 74. I take sSp in this passage as well to be the light of dawn, and since the lines to follow have to do with terrestrial concerns (see the discussion below), the use of the term to establish a relationship between the solar creator god and the human realm is the same in both passages. SSp occurs once in the accompanying addresses to the bas of Amun, here as a verb: "This means that his existence is that he rises and sets every day, while he is in heaven, lighting (sSp) the Two Lands for her (i.e., heaven's) son, the leader of the living (this is either Horus, who is mentioned in the preceding sentence, or the king), may he live forever"; see Hibis III, PI. XXXI, 11. 30-32. Here, the reference of sSp is not to the light of dawn, as it seems to be in the passages just considered (and see the next paragraph), but to daylight in general. Images from this and the following line are brought together in a rather earlier text, from the tomb of Paheri at el-Kab: tki cnh pr(w) m Nwn [r] sSp n hnmmt "living flame who emerges from Nun [to] make light for the /wmmf-people"; see Urk. IV, 111.11. Sethe notes (ibid., n. a) that the lacuna could be restored as ir (presumably as a participle); the examples cited above support both possibilities. Interestingly, while tki refers to the glow that surrounds the nighttime sun in this line at Hibis, in this passage from the tomb of Paheri, as in the passage cited above from the address to one of the bas of Amun, the reference is to the daylight. In notes v, w and x above, it was noted that space-saving devices were adopted in the upper portion of the line in the Taharqa version. It is curious, then, that the final signs of the line are spaced quite widely apart to bring the text to the bottom of the line. aa) The word bi is written with a jabiru bird, stroke determinative and seated god in the Hibis text. In the Taharqa version, it is written with a ram, below which is a tall sign, the top of which is in lacuna and the bottom of which is a single, centered vertical line. A ntr sign of the same height as the one occurring later in the line would fit in the available space. The expression Hr bi diw seems unparalleled, and it has received various imaginative interpretations. In view of the name "living royal ka" later in this line, it occurred to me to suggest that the "five bas" or "five manifestations" are the fivefold royal titulary, and I was gratified to learn that I had been anticipated in this by CI. Traunecker in his thesis, "Les Cryptes du Temple d'Opet". The constituent elements of the titulary seem to express aspects of the king's divinity; cf. H. Frankfort, Kingship and the Gods (1948),</page><page sequence="26">184 D. Lorton SAK 21 46-47 and J. von Beckerath, Handbuch der agyptischen Kftnigsnamen, MAS 20, 1-33, esp. p. 1. ab) cnhy occurs as an epithet of the solar god and other deities, including Horus (Wb. I, 201.5-8); in the context of this line, the associations are both Horian and solar. In the Taharqa parallel, there is only an cnh sign, which could be understood as a nominally used participle. Except for Brugsch, who employed the word "emporsteigen" in his rendering, the previous translators have all taken cnh(w) m Nwn as "who lives in Nun". It seems more likely that we have here a variant of the pr(w) m Nwn "who emerges from Nun" in the tomb of Paheiy (see note z above and cf. Wb. I, 519.2) and wbn(w) m Nwn "who shines forth/rises from Nun", for examples of which see the accompanying addresses to the bas of Amun (Hibis III, P. XXXI, 11. 20-21; partly in lacuna, see Enchoria 7, 1977, 123 for the restoration) and C. de Wit, in: CdE 36, 1961, 58. ("Comes alive" does not imply a verb of motion; the expression is similar in meaning to French "s'animer" and German "sich beleben".) These verbal images recall the iconography of sunrise as an emergence from Nun in the Book of Gates; see, e.g., Hornung, Idea into Image, 107-108. Both the verbal and the visual images seem rooted in the idea that each sunrise reenacts the moment of creation; see, e.g., Frankfort, Kingship and the Gods, 154. When the reference is to Amun-Re as solar creator god, however, they might also allude indirectly to the decade festival, when Amun, in his form of the ithyphallic Amun of Luxor, visited the deities of the primeval chaos at Djeme (see also below). As noted by Cruz-Uribe, HTP I, 121, n. 666, there is some room in the lacuna before the phrase m rn.fi n; this could have been a determinative, or perhaps the phrase rc nb. There was likely some further word or words, given the fact that in the Taharqa parallel, in the 4.75-square lacuna following the nw-pots of Nwn, there seems to be too much space for a pt sign, plus one or even two determinatives (the latter not very likely, given the writing of Nwn in Goyon's line 18), followed by m rn.fn. ac) According to Cruz-Uribe, loc.cit., his collation of the text revealed that rn.f is not entirely in lacuna, as shown in Davies' publication. ad) Like Rs-wdi (see note y above), the notion of "living royal ka" seems to have taken on something of a life of its own. An inscription of Horemhab connects the concept ki nswt with Ptah-Tatenen and Ptah-Nun-wer (P. Barquet, in: ASAE 51, 1951, 212), and in the Graeco-Roman period, ki-nswt cnh could designate Shu and Khonsu-Shu (Gutbub, Textes fondamentaux, 287 and 339-340). But in view of the connection made here with people (designated hnmmt), the reference would seem to be specifically royal; see now the study on the royal ka by L. Bell, in: JNES 44, 1985, 251-294. I thus understand the</page><page sequence="27">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 185 point to be that the source of the king's divinity is here listed as one of the ten names or qualities of the solar creator god. Some of the concepts in a passage at Kom Ombo identifying Haroeris with the living royal ka would thus be applicable to the royal context here: ntr pfy ci r ntrw ntf ki-nswt cnh smsw Rc mswt nfr n Nb-r-dr "that god, greater than the (other) gods, he is the living royal ka, the eldest son of Re, the goodly image (mswt, see note d above) of the All-lord"; see de Morgan et al., Kom Ombos I, 87, no. 107, 1. 2. The Taharqa parallel is quite different from the Hibis text at this point, for it shows what seems to be a throw-stick, followed by an eye and a star. Goyon describes the writing as "very strange" and takes the end of the line to be "incomprehensible"; see Edifice of Taharqa, 72, n. 36. The drastically abbreviated writing of mn(w) "enduring" three lines earlier in the Taharqa text suggests that we might have here an abbreviated writing of tnw ir(w) "distinguished/uplifted of form (or "forms"), for which see Wb. V, 375.18. If this is the reading, the royal reference is missing, but the expression is appropriate to the context of a hymn recited at sunrise; the epithet is in fact so applied in a hymn to the rising sun in the Book of the Dead of Hunefer (see Tb (Naville) I, P. XVI, 1. 13). Because of the inexplicable star determinative in the Taharqa text, however, this interpretation must remain uncertain. If either text is likely to be corrupt at this point, for once it seems to be Taharqa's, particularly since the ki sign of ki-nswt is preserved on the head of the sixth ba of Amun in Edifice of Taharqa, PI. 29a. On the connection between Amun's names in this hymn and the bas of Amun, see the discussion below. In note z above, it was noted that concepts occurring together in a brief passage in the tomb of Paheri are distributed between lines 9 (tki and sSp) and 10 (pr(w)/cnh(w) m Nwn and hnmmt) of the present text. I would suggest, on the basis of this observation, that the statements made in the two lines are intended to form a linkage between the last of the first five invocation lines and the first of the second five, articulating as they do a clear conceptual transition from the Osirian nighttime sun to the light of dawn to the emergence of the sun on behalf of humankind. This impression is confirmed by a passage in the accompanying addresses to the bas of Amun: "... he having brightened the circuit of the sky with his plumes, great of his success and of his 'custom'24, he having been lasting and enduring, without his perishing, in the millions and millions of eternity, traversing the sky and circling the Netherworld in the course of the day, 24 Nt-C seems to occur in reference to the course of a heavenly body; see M. Smith, in: Enchoria 7, 1977, 133, note c to line 10. I agree with Smith in understanding wr mcr.f as forming one ex pression, but I cannot follow him in taking nt-cf as the subject of the following pi.n.f in anti cipatory emphasis, for nt-cought to be feminine in gender, while the suffix pronoun ./is masculine.</page><page sequence="28">186 D. Lorton SAK 21 desirous that Osiris alight25 as ruler of Igeret, renewing his body repeatedly in (hnt, see note j above) his 'palace', that the heart of the god's mother might be gladdened for his (i.e. Osiris) son Horus: this means that he rises and sets every day, while he is in heaven, lighting (sSp) the Two Lands for her son, the leader of the living, may he live forever"; Hibis III, PI. XXXI, 11. 24-32. In this passage, with its stress on the course of the sun, the same points are made as in lines 9 and 10 of the present text, showing that these two are conceptually linked: as Osiris (Rs-wdi of line 9), the nighttime sun is re newed, and he appears in the sky at dawn (sip in both cases, see note z above) as Horus (Hr-bi-diw of line 10). ae) The Hibis version has hnt \iwt-cit, while the Taharqa version has hr-hit \ywt-cit. It is unclear in either case whether we are to understand "before" or "in"; cf. note j above. In the Taharqa text, the nearly two-square lacuna between rw and lir-hit is more than adequate for a writing of cnh-hr. It is uncertain what, if any, abstruse meaning the latter might convey. The occurrence here seems unrelated to the male or female serpent deity of that name attested once at Hibis and twice in the Amduat, on which see Cruz-Uribe, HTP I, 104 with n. 505. In context, the expression might simply express the liveliness of the face in the act of spitting. The hwt-cit "Great House" is specified as m Iwnw "in Heliopolis" in the hymnic material on the south wall of this room at Hibis; see Hibis III, PI. XXXIII, 1. 31, and cf. Wb. Ill, 4.3. ISS(w) miiw nb has been understood as "who spits out all lions" by all the previous translators, except for Brugsch, who rendered iSS(w) interpretively as "der SchOpfer" 25 Smith (ibid., 121) renders "alighting (upon) Osiris". This might seem the more expected image, referring to the ba of Re joining his "flesh" in the form of Osiris, but the Hibis and Demotic versions of the text (the Taharqa version is in lacuna at this point) are in agreement in not inserting a preposition far after shn. In the last analysis, there seems to be no reason why the result of the sun god's joining his body could not be imaged as Osiris alighting. In any event, the image recalls one in the ninth hour of the Amduat, where it is said of twelve goddesses, irt.sn pw irt stsw Wsir shn b3 $t3 m mdw.sn "What they do is to perform the uplifting of Osiris, as the mysterious ba alights through their words" (Hornung, Amduat I, 157). Interestingly, the relationship between Re and Osiris here is expressed with the same imagery as that describing the relationship between the ba of a deity and his or her cult statue in later, Ptolemaic temple texts; for examples, see Morenz, Religion, 159-160; L. Zabkar, A Study of the Ba Concept in Ancient Egyptian Texts, SAOC 34, 39-41 (hereafter cited as Ba Concept), and J. Assmann, Agypten - Theologie und Frommigkeit einer fruhen Hochkultur, 1984, 50-54. Beginning with the New Kingdom, it is also stated that the ba of the deceased alights (expressed by hni and fatp) upon the corpse; see the examples in Zabkar, op.cit, 133. This last is also attested iconographically, in vignettes of chapter 89 of the Book of the Dead; see Tb (Naville) I, PI. CI.</page><page sequence="29">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 187 (Reise, 49), and Assmann who, evidently understanding miiw nb symbolically, rendered "alle Wildtiere" (AHG, 289; cf. also his "alle Raubtiere", Liturgische Lieder, 79). Since each invocation line describes a quality of the god and then names it, there is, naturally enough, a connected sense in each line, as is clear from those discussed thus far. No such sense is evident here, and the image of a lion spitting out lions is, so far as I can tell, both unparalleled and unsusceptible of any interpretation that would yield the expected sense in the line. It might be productive, then, to consider the possibility of an error in the text. In the hymnic material on the south wall of this room, there occurs the statement, iSLk m Sw tfn.k m Tfnwt r kmi n.k Psdt m Sic hpr ntk Rw tiw.k Rwty "You coughed up Shu, you spat out Teftiut, in order to create the ennead for yourself at the beginning of existence. You are the Lion, the Two Lions are your fledglings", Hibis III, PL XXXIII, 11. 26-27. (The passage has some contentual similarity to Pyr. 447 a-b.) On tiwy (here written as a plural) and rwty in reference to Shu and Tefhut, see Wb. II, 403.10 and V 340.17; on tiwy, see also Gutbub, Textes fondamentaux I, 222, n. e. If the word following i?i(w) were mostly or entirely in lacuna in the Vorlage used by the artisan who carved this wall at Hibis, the miiw nb could easily have been a well-intentioned restoration on the part of a man who, as an artisan, would have had limited religious knowledge. It is clear from the passage just cited that the first part of the line ought to refer to Atum spitting out Shu and Tefhut, and either rwty or tiwy (or tiw, as on the south wall) must have been in the original. If the word was rwty, the word must have been entirely lost. It seems more likely that it was tiwylt_3w, with most but not all of the word lost, for the top of a ti sign, if that were all that was preserved, could have been mistaken for a mi sign, as shown in figure 5. (Since the Vorlage could have been at least as old as the reign of Taharqa, the examples in figures 5 and 6 are taken from the "Takelothis" column of MOller, Palaographie III). As it happens, in the accompanying addresses to the ten bas of Amun, there appears the phrase wdc phty.fr miiw nb shm "his strength is more distinctive (?) than (that of) any powerful lion" (Hibis III, PI. XXXI, 1. 39). There is a good chance that what I take to be an incorrect restoration in the present line was inspired by this occurrence of the phrase miiw nb. In the Taharqa parallel, what corresponds to the problem spot just discussed is, unfortunately, in the 4.75-square lacuna. After 1iwt-ci3t, there is a reed leaf, followed by the lacuna. There is sufficient room for a writing of iSS, followed by some word; there does not seem, however, to be enough room for two words, which lends some support to the proposal that there is an error in the Hibis version. Fig. 5. T3 &gt; m3.</page><page sequence="30">188 D. Lorton SAK 21 af) In the Hibis version, both words bi are written with the ram sign, while in the Taharqa parallel, the first of the two words is written with the jabiru bird and the second with a ram. The writing in the Taharqa version suggests an ancient interpretation "ba of (sacred) rams", if only as ajeux de mots; such an understanding does not contribute to the expected connected sense of the line, however, and the writing at Hibis suggests that the reader was intended to understand both words to have the same meaning, either "ba of bas" or "ram of rams". The first alternative is viable: as will be discussed below, these names are the names of the ten bas of Amun, and it is possible that the expression asserts that Amun himself is the ultimate ba underlying these forms of manifestation. Bi biw, understood by scholars as "ram of Rams", is a relatively rare expression, but it is securely attested in reference to the sun god in various phases of his course. It occurs in a reference to the nighttime sun as he is about to rise in the magical papyrus of London and Leiden, recto 27.6 (see pMag.LL I, 158-159)26. It is attested in regard to the rising sun in a passage at Edfu: bi-biw ci Sfyt nb hrw tw3(w) snty hr-tp cwy.sn "Ram-of rams, great of awe, lord of humankind, whom the Two Sisters raise upon their arms" (Edfou IV 384, 1. 6)27. It is also attested in parallelism with Atum in reference to the setting sun in a solar hymn attested from Dyn. XIX to the Ptolemaic period: ind hr.k iiti m Itm hprti m kmi(w) ntrw ind hr.k iiti m bi-biw bi dsr imy Imntt "Hail to you, you having come as Atum, you having come into being as the one who created the gods; hail to you, you having come as the Ram-of-rams, the sacred ram who is in the West" (see H.M. Stewart, in: Bulletin of the Institue of Archaeology, University of London 6, 1966, 68-70). From these examples, it is clear that in this line at Hibis, the "Ram-of rams", here the rising sun who is being invoked, is identified with the creator god Atum. In the alternate interpretation mentioned above, Atum would be identified as the ultimate source of all bas; this is the less satisfactory explanation, however, for it does not speak 26 Ph. Derchain, however, expressed the opinion that this writing is for the name Bebon; see RdE 9, 1952, 46-47. 27 The choice of the word Sfyt "awe," regularly written with a ram's head as determinative or (as here) ideogram, is an obvious visual pun. The mention of the "Two Sisters," Isis and Nephthys, refers to the iconography of the two goddesses lifting the sun god out of the netherworld at sunrise; see, e.g., The Epigraphic Survey, Medinet Habu VI, OIP 84, PI. 420B and A. Piankoff, Egyptian Religious Texts and Representations I, BS 40/1, PI. 149. It is also, however, a reference to the pylon of the temple, as is made especially clear in the following passage: difsw m Gbt imytw ifaty.siy) m cpy wr n ktm(t) wtsf s(w) r fart far cwy snty n Bfadt "he presents himself from the sky goddess, from between her thighs, as the great Winged Beetle of gold, he lifts himself to the sky on the arms of the Two Sisters of Edfu" (Edfou IV 2-3, 1. 11). Here, since the rising sun is said to lift himself, it is clear that snty n Bfadt is intended as a metaphor to be understood as "the pylon of the temple of Edfu".</page><page sequence="31">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 189 to sunrise, which is the most immediate concern of the hymn. It is certainly possible that the mention or depiction of a ram in connection with the sun god is always intended to call also to mind the notion of ba, cf. the remarks of Barucq and Daumas, Hymnes et prieres, 312, n. n, and Goyon, Edifice of Taharqa, 72, n. 38. The ram-headed figure of the nighttime sun is familiar, and there are also such depictions of the daytime sun; see the examples in K. MySliwiec, Studien zum Gott Atum I, HAB 5, 52-61. ag) The poorly carved ideograms at the end of the line caused misunderstandings on the part of Brugsch, Scharff, and Assmann. The words cwt and mnmnt are written out in the Taharqa version. There, the lacuna of two squares between the phonetic signs of cwt and the final mn of mnmnt provides ample space for the determinative of the first word plus the initial mn of the second. At the end of the line, the lacuna below the t of mnmnt is enough for plural strokes at the bottom of the line, as well as for the same generous space that precedes them in the preceding line. The excitement of the world of nature at sunrise is a familiar theme from New Kingdom solar hymns. In the Great Hymn to the Aton, it is stated that at sunrise, cwt hr tbhn hr rdwy &lt;.sn&gt; "the (small) cattle leap upon &lt;their&gt; legs"; see M. Sandman, Texts from Akhenaten, 94.7-8. Since rdwy is written as a dual, the passage could well mean that the animals rear up on their hind legs in imitation of the stance of adoring humans (for what can be said of serpents in this regard, see note aj below). Cf. also the several references to Amun-Re's beneficence towards cattle in P. Boulaq 17, 1.2 (mnmnt; E. Gr6baut, Hymne &amp; Ammon-Ra, 3), 1.6 (cwt; ibid., 5), 1.7 (mnmnt; ibid.), 5.7 (cwt; ibid., 15), 6.4 (mnmnt, here determined with five different animal signs; ibid., 17), 7.3 (cwt; ibid., 19), 8.2 (cwt; ibid., 21), and 8.3 (cwt; ibid.). ah) The rendering "Horus-gods" is that of Cruz-Uribe, HTP I, 121, which is similar in spirit to all previous renderings except that of Assmann (see below). The only inter pretation offered to date is that of Barucq and Daumas: "Amon est appel6 'faucons1, au pluriel, parce qu'il equivaut a lui seul a une plurality. Les dieux sont ses creatures; il est done les dieux, il vit dans les dieux comme le dit la suite de l'hymne ...", see Hymnes et pridres, 312, n. o. Unfortunately, the correctness of the pantheistic statement to which they allude has to be questioned (see note ai), so that the evident connected sense they propose seems not to exist. Though it is admittedly not necessarily an obstacle (cf. imyw-spiwt in line 5 and Hr bi diw in line 10), the evident uniqueness of the formu lation also suggests questioning either the interpretation on the writing. Cruz-Uribe (loc.cit, n. 670) cites Wb. Ill, 123.10-11 in support of his rendering, but this can mislead. Wb. Ill, 123.11 lists the well-attested expression Hr-Hrw, which can be written with four falcons. In the Belegstellen to Wb. Ill, 123.10, only two occurrences are listed</page><page sequence="32">190 D. Lorton SAK 21 of a writing with three falcons, one of which is the present instance. The other is line 24 of the Qubban stela of Ramesses II (= Kitchen, Ram. Inscr. II, 357.12), where mention is made of "the Horuses, the lords of Nubia". This vastly different context provides no certain indication of the correct understanding here. It is logically possible that one is to read "Horus of the Two Horuses", though the meaning would be obscure. The reference could then be to a deity with two falcon heads, such as Montu-Re (see Quaegebeur, Religion und Philosophie im alten Agypten (1991), 266, fig. 12), or - to mention an occurrence at Hibis itself - to the winged crocodile with two falcon heads identified as "Horus who is in Sumenu" (Hibis III, PI. XX, bottom right). Suggestions along these lines do not seem plausible, however, because the references that open these invocation lines are otherwise to important deities or to divine principles and not to more minor local cult manifestations or iconographies. Given the difficulty posed by the reading, Assmann's proposal to understand here the well-attested "Falke der Falken" mentioned above is tempting; see Liturgische Lieder, 80 and AHG, 29028. If this is correct, the writing at Hibis could have resulted from a lacuna at some point in the transmission of the text, or simply from an accidental omission of a sign. Unfortunately, the possibility of verifying the reading with the help of the Taharqa parallel is obviated by a lacuna near the top of the line. Most of a falcon is well preserved, followed by a lacuna, which is followed by the legs and tail of (presumably) a falcon. In the drawing, a falcon is shown in the second square, with square brackets around it, which I infer to mean that the sign is entirely restored, possibly on the strength of the Hibis version. It is of course possible that two falcons were originally in this square, though there can be no certainty. Profs. Edward F. Wente and Janet H. Johnson most kindly checked a contact print of Oriental Institute photo graph 8363, and they report they could make out nothing above the legs of the bottommost falcon (personal communication from Dr. John C. Larson, dated 29 July, 1993). I can make out nothing here on my xerox copy of the print (see n. x above), which is evidently overall darker than the print. As implied by the translations of Cruz-Uribe and Assmann cited above, there is uncertainty as to whether the ideogram of the falcon is to be read Hr "Horus," bik "falcon," or even ntr "god"; see the discussions of Goyon, Edifice of Taharqa, 72, n. 39 and J.G. Griffiths, in: JEA 75, 1989, 282. The choice seems open, especially when the 28 In the brief list of occurrences of the expression outside Edfu in Liturgische Lieder, 80, n. 7, the reference to "Hibis 32, 11" should be corrected to "Hibis 31, 11," i.e., a reference to the present instance. The reference to "P. Leiden I 344 vso. 6, 10" (i.e., to the Admonitions of an Egyptian Sage) is also incorrect. On Hr Hrw at Edfu, reference can now be added to S. Cauville, Essai sur la theologie du temple d'Horus a Edfou, Vol. I, BdE 102/1, 44, 78, 83, and 221.</page><page sequence="33">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 191 writing is a simple falcon, rather than a falcon with a flagellum (both writings occur; see Griffiths, loc.cit.). The simple falcon occurs consistently in both versions of the hymn, and I have chosen to understand it as "Horus" in all its occurrences. However we are to understand the opening of the line, the epithet sib-Zwt "dappled of plumage", an epithet of the winged sun disk and of Hours of Edfu (to the extent there is a distinction to be made between these) and a few other falcon gods (see Wb. IV, 17.14-18.1) assures that the reference is to a solar god imaged as a falcon, i.e., to the rising sun being invoked by the hymn. This makes for a clear connection with the name Horakhty later in the line. Indeed, the epithet is attested for Horakhty himself (see the Belegstellen to Wb. IV, 17.14), and its choice here might have been specifically intended to underline the identification. In the event that the correct understanding of the beginning of the line is indeed Hr Hrw, i.e., a mistaken writing for four falcons, the following passage from the temple of Edfu is a pertinent parallel, for it occurs in reference to the rising sun and invokes the theology of cult statues, as is also done in line 3 of the present text: bi iib(t) (i)fdfr Nwt shd stywfm s?d pr Hr Hrw far.nfr fart smi miwtf m sch $psy "The Eastern Ba, as he races (up) to heaven, his beams make light in the window! As Horus of Horuses goes out, having distanced (himself) to the sky, may his rays unite with (his) august 'body' (i.e., his cult statue)!" (Edfou I, 573 574). al) Previous translators have understood the phrase as cnh(w) m ntrw and rendered "who lives in (or "as") the gods," except for Assmann, AHG, 290, who offered "Lebendigster unter den GOttern". I find the latter less plausible than a reference to Egypt's pantheistic religious system, which I take to be what the artisan intended to be understood. I suspect, however, that this intent does not represent what was originally in the text. The word read ntrw is written with a falcon on a standard, followed by plural strokes. But elsewhere in the lengthy hymns in this room, ntrw is written with three flagpoles, or a flagpole and plural strokes, or a flagpole and seated god and plural strokes. Even as a determinative, the falcon on a standard occurs only three times; see Hibis III, PI. XXXI, line 21 and PI. XXXII, lines 1 and 8. The falcon on a standard is thus far more likely to be a determinative than an ideogram for ntr, and it would seem that at some point in the textual transmission, perhaps in the papyrus Vorlage at Hibis, the word was so badly in lacuna that a restoration could not be made and the determinative was allowed to stand alone as a word, on the grounds that "who lives in/as the gods" was meaningful in and of itself. Some measure of support for this suggestion is afforded by the Taharqa parallel, where, perversely enough, the 4.75-square lacuna begins immediately after cnh(w) m. It is unfortunate that the word is lost, but even if we assume a writing of m rnfn thai</page><page sequence="34">192 D. Lorton SAK 21 occupied 2.25 squares (see the introductory discussion above), too much room is left for a writing of ntrw. Of the three writings of ntrw preserved in the lengthy introductory material to this version of the text, the word is twice written with three flagpoles arranged horizontally, thus occupying one square (both are in Goyon's line 8), and once with two flagpoles written horizontally and one below, thus occupying two squares (Goyon's line 4). The latter would be possible here only if we imagined the last .75 square of the lacuna to be occupied by a seated god determinative plus vertical plural strokes. But while the seated male deity does in fact accompany the flagpole in the singular of the word ntr in this version of the text, the preserved writings of the plural do not support such a restoration here. Without the help of the Taharqa parallel, it is not possible to determine the presumedly missing word. aj) For Horakhty as the rising sun, see H. Altenmuller, in: Hommages a Francis Daumas I, 10-13. On his connections with the east, see also C. Kuentz, in: BIFAO 17, 1920, 173-176 and H. Junker, SB AW 1942/7, 23-24. Cf. also the beginning of the well-known hymns of Suti and Hor, "Adoration of Amun, when he rises as Horakhty"; see I.E.S. Edwards, Hieroglyphic Texts from Egyptian Stelae, etc. VII, 24 and PI. XXI. There has been some puzzlement as to the understanding of the last word of the line, which is written ideographically. Most recently, Cruz-Uribe, who has collated the text, has established that the sign "would suggest we have a recumbent figure beginning to arise"; see HTP I, 121, with n. 671. The form of the sign is curious, but the reading sdr is now secure from the Taharqa parallel, where the consonantal signs are preserved, while the end of word is in lacuna. This last is unfortunate, because the "sleepers" need to be identified. Obvious possibilities are the dead (for the concept of "Todesschlaf, see Wb. II, 266.8 on nmc and Wb IV, 391.20-21 and 392.9 on sdr), the living essences of deities in their cult statues at night, and living humans at night29. It would seem that otherwise in the text, except for references to the rising sun, the concerns of the individual invocation lines do not repeat themselves, a point raised by Traunecker in commenting on the problem of this word in his thesis, "Les Cryptes du temple d'Opet k Karnak". Since the cult statues 29 Barucq and Daumas locate "the recumbent ones" ("les gisants") in the sky, referring to Wb. IV, 392.8; see Hymnes et prieres, 312, n. p. Their choice seems arbitrary, and the Belegstellen cite only two instances, Pyr. 126 and 1011. Both of these are obscure; in context, they could easily refer to the deceased (see the very next Wb. entry). I also would not follow Cruz-Uribe's suggestion that the reference is Osirian (HTP I, 233), both for the reason given in the text (Osiris is dealt with in line 9), and because the word is in the plural.</page><page sequence="35">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 193 seem to be referred to in line 5 by imyw-spiwt, people (fanmmt) in line 10, and the dead in line 14, all these possibilities are otherwise accounted for. Moreover, if one considers the references at the ends of the lines beginning with line 10 - (living) people, small and large cattle, the uncertain reference here, crocodiles, and finally the deceased - the logical choice for what is mentioned at the end of line 12 would be some sort of animal. Wb. IV, 392.10 lists a plural noun sdrw, determined with the sdr determinative plus a serpent, which it defines as "die Schlangen". The Belegstellen list only one occurrence, in a hymn to the rising sun in the Book of the Dead of Nakhtamun. There, in a description of joy at the sun's rising, it is stated, chc n.k sdrw hr sd.sn "the 'sleeping ones' stand up on their tails for you"; see Tb (Naville) I, PL XVII, 1. 10. As it happens there is another occurrence of the word in this very room at Hibis, in the hymnic material on the south wall. Just before a long lacuna, the text reads, scfrc.n.k sdrw hr gs.sn "after you have raised 'those who sleep' on their sides", or perhaps, "after you have raised the 'sleeping ones' (from) upon their sides"; see Hibis III, PL XXXIII, line 16. As in the present instance, the passage just cited does not write out the word, but rather uses the determinative of sdr (rather than the odd variant that occurs here) as an ideogram, followed by a serpent as a determinative. From their wording, the two attestations are conceptually related, and they do not support the superficial translation offered by the Wb. Rather, because of the association of what appears to be a participle of the verb sdr "to sleep" with the verb chc or its causative schc, the term seems to serve as a poetic image comparing serpents, because they have no legs and thus lie on the ground, to "sleepers", an image that is all the more apt in contexts referring to sunrise. The image is attested only twice, to the best of my knowledge, but at sufficiently separate periods as to suggest that it was a common one, perhaps at the "popular" or "folk" level rather than in the high religion. It can at least be suggested that the image underlies the word chcw "serpent", Wb. I, 222.12-15. At the temple of Dendera, Chassinat's room G is the "House of the Serpent", also known as the "House of Uniter of-the-Two-Lands". Its images (see Dendara II, Pis. CXLIV and CL) and its inscriptions make it clear that it is devoted to a form of the rising solar god. In two of the building inscriptions, the room is referred to as ihtfwrt far-si Gb "his great horizon upon earth" and iht n hmftp ti "the horizon of his 'majesty' (lit. "his body", a reference to his cult image(s); see J. Spiegel, in: ZAS 75, 1939, 112-121) on earth"; see Dendara II, 174.4 and 18-19, and cf. the similarly-worded ciwy n pt hr-s3 ti "double doors of heaven upon earth" in line 3 of the present inscription. Elsewhere in the building inscriptions, the god is called psd(w) m nb "he who shines as gold" (Wb. I, 557.3) and wbn(w) m nhb "he who shines forth/rises from the lotus" (Wb. I, 293.8), both well-established solar images, the latter recalling Nefertem; see Dendara II, 172.5 and 173.3. He is otherwise described as hcwf phr(w)ldbn(w) m rSw(t) "his body enveloped in joy"; see ibid., 172.13. The</page><page sequence="36">194 D. Lorton SAK 21 word rSwt is determined with a lotus; this is common in the Graeco-Roman period (Wb. II, 454; and already at Hibis, see HTP I, 221), but the mention of "his body", together with the iconography of the room, suggest a visual pun with the additional, implied meaning "his body enveloped in a lotus". Two of the cult images depicted are divine barks each bearing a lotus from which a serpent arises, standing on its tail. Three other objects are Itrt (Wb. I, 147) - like entities, each evidently being lifted into an upright position by a large male figure with the assistance of a smaller hh figure (so identified in the text) with a disk on his head and/or a ^-pillar. The bottom of each itrt is embedded in a lotus, so that again the serpents are emerging from the lotuses. Returning to the barks, the inscription accompanying one of them states, wnn Hr Smi-tiwy si-ti n iht (?) cbc(w) m-hnw nhb m-hnw mc&lt;nd&gt;t ki Ssp 4 cndt nhb m nb "Horus Uniter-of-the Two-Lands, the serpent of the soil (?), is standing in the lotus in the day-bark; height, 4 palms, the day-bark and the lotus (being) of gold"; see Dendara II, 184.6-8. The other bark is accompanied by an inscription that is identically worded, except for an m of predication before Si-ti; see ibid., 193.6-830. This is very odd iconography, and though the god is nowhere called sdr(w), I would venture to suggest that the images are inspired by the "folk" (if it is that) image reflected in the two passages just cited, making of the rising sun the divine prototype of the serpents who rise up on their tails to greet him at dawn. In the Taharqa parallel, the cloth bolt s and the dr basket are followed by a lacuna of five squares; horizontally arranged plural strokes are shown in the drawing at the bottom of the column. One and a half squares below sdr, the drawing shows a restoration from traces of a reed leaf at the right of the column. If one hypothesizes a double reed leaf, one might imagine an unusual writing *sdryw; in the square and a quarter between the reed leaf(s) and the plural strokes, there might have been a quail chick for the plural ending, or a serpent determinative. Since this is by far the shortest line of the Hibis version, and since the writings of the Taharqa version seem to have been chosen to make the vertical lines of its invocations of equal length (see the introductory discussion above), the awkwardness of such a writing would not be an absolute bar to the possibility. More troubling to the suggestion is that the space between the dr basket and the reed leaf is too great for only the phonetic complement r, if it appeared, and it is here that there is likely to have been a serpent determinative, even if the word was further extended by a double reed leaf and plural strokes. The reed leaf could well be the first sign of a separate word that ended the line, or if there indeed was a longer writing sdryw, the line might have ended with the word nbw "all". 30 On the iconography of the room, see also S. Morenz and J. Schubert, Der Gott auf der Blume, 1954, 37-42.</page><page sequence="37">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 195 I would suggest that the end of the line, following the curious ideogram of sdr, was badly in lacuna in the Vorlage used by the artisan at Hibis, and that he added a seated male deity and plural strokes in the hope of supplying some sense, perhaps indeed a reference to cult statues, or perhaps a reference to the deceased, under the influence of line 14. There was evidently some further word, whether a longer or a shorter one, in the Taharqa version, and it is possible that this, too, was in the lacuna at Hibis. With two references to the rising sun, and the established connection between serpents standing on their tails and sunrise, the connected sense of the line is clear enough, even though there is evidently a word missing (see note ai). At this point, it has been possible to suggest two corrections to resolve difficulties in the Hibis version of the text on the basis of the lengthy hymnic material in the middle register of the south wall of this room (see also note ae above). There arises an obvious question: if this could be done here, why did the artisan at Hibis not do the same? Laziness on his part could be posited, but while it is not impossible, too quick an acceptance of this proposal might be gratuitously impertinent. It is also necessary to consider the possibility that, at the time this west wall was being decorated, the south wall was still blank. If the papyrus originals of this wall had not yet been unrolled (assuming they had been delivered at this point), there would not have been much incentive to open them, given that there was no advance guarantee that they would provide any solutions to the problems of the text at hand. J. Baines has studied the decoration of the Hall of Barques in the temple of Seti I at Abydos and reported that the decoration of the room began with the wall of the entrance to the room (i.e., the east wall) and proceeded around the room to the north, the west, and the south walls; see in: JEA 75, 1989, 25. The overall process of decoration, as elaborated in Baines' study, was an especially complex one, but if the proposals offered here are correct, it is likely that the west wall of this room was carved before the south wall, and there is thus a good chance that the order in which the walls of the room were decorated was the same here as in the Hall of Barques. I do not, however, know whether this is a coincidence, or whether this represents a standard procedure. In any event, it was for this reason that it was proposed above (note v) that it was the *mhnhwt in line 9 of this text that caused the presumed hypercorrection of mhn(y)t in its occurrences on the southern end of this wall and on the south wall, though admittedly, if the papyrus originals of the wall sections on both sides of the doorway of the west wall were unrolled at more or less the same time, it could arguably have been a problem in the original of the middle register of the south end of the west wall that affected the other two occurrences. ak) For ck m "to enter into", see Wb. I, 230.10-15. Brugsch for some reason did not translate ck, and he rendered the first part of the line as "... in der Erde, der Freund des</page><page sequence="38">196 D. Lorton SAK 21 Scorpiones in [seinem] LCche" (Reise, 49); the renderings of Scharff (Sonnenlieder, 89) and Assmann (AHG, 290) are along essentially the same lines. Barucq and Daumas introduced the improved rendering "celui qui entre sur terre, qui desire faire p6n6trer l'air dans les gorges" (Hymnes et prieres, 313), and this was followed by Goyon (Edifice of Taharqa, 72), while Cruz-Uribe (HTP I, 121) preferred to follow the older understanding, referring his translation to Assmann's. There is a parallel to mr(w) as it is used here in a passage in the accompanying addresses to the bas of Amun already cited (note ad above), mr(w) shn Wsir "desiring/desirous that Osiris alight". I would take the form to be a participle, rather than the Old Perfective, as suggested by Smith, in: Enchoria 7, 1977, 135. There, Smith notes that the Demotic parallel has n mr, "through desire of. An abbreviated writing of n mrwt "for the sake of could be posited in the present instance, but the word is in fact an evident error, inspired in part by a poorly preserved hieratic sign, and quite possibly in part by the accompanying passage just cited. In the Taharqa parallel, the consonantal sign k appears where the walking legs determinative of ck might have been expected, and the determinative is missing (I wish to thank Dr. Larson for verifying the reading of the sign from the contact print at the Oriental Institute; personal communication dated 3 August 1993). There is too much room at the top of the column for just the forearm sign for the c of % This suggests that some short word not in the Hibis version began the line; this was presumably a noun, followed by ck(w) "who enters". The next words are m nt "into the water", followed by the consonantal signs of srk and a small lacuna, and then the 4.75-square lacuna. Since the word mr(w) does not appear, the word srk must here be a conjugated form rather than an infinitive, as at Hibis, and it would have been followed directly by its subject (presumably kbbwt) rather than by the m of the Hibis version. There is ample room for the determinative or determinatives of srk, plus kbbwt m rnf n. Barucq and Daumas noted the Taharqa variant, rendering, "qui entre comme flot (l'inondation)"; see Hymnes et prieres, 312, n. q. Goyon rendered "who enters the inundation"; see Edifice of Taharqa, 72. There are occurrences referring to the solar creator god emerging from nt, including If.k m nt m swfat imnt Imnt m-ht.k "you rise from the water as the hidden egg, Amaunet accompanying you" in the hymnic material on the south wall of the room (Hibis III, PL XXXIII, line 23) and Imn piwty tiwy piwty n ntrw ir(w) piw n Pfy hp(rw) piwty r ntrw nb pr(w) m nt mdh(w) m thn shkr(w) m cit nb(t) ?ps(yt) "Amun, the primeval one of the Two Lands, the primeval one of the gods, who is (or, "who made"?) the primevalness of That-one (i.e., Seth), who came into being more primeval than all the gods, who emerged from the water crowned with fayence and adorned with all (kinds of) precious stones" (C. de Wit, Temple d'Opet I, 112-113, 11. 11-12; I owe this reference to Dr. Traunecker). Interestingly, these two passages, at</page><page sequence="39">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 197 least, do not seem to refer to sunrise but rather to the original moment of creation when the creator god first emerged from the waters of chaos. Additionally, the verb here is ck "to enter", and not one like Jfi or pri, as in these examples. A formulation along the lines of "who enters (i.e., who enters into Egypt or into the sky) from the water" seems less attractive than an understanding along the lines of those of Barucq and Daumas or Goyon, which contributes meaningfully to the sense of the line. Hornung has suggested that the term nt refers specifically to a water surface; see Amduat II, 170, n. 7. The idea receives support from a passage at Edfu, in which Horus says to the king, di.i snd.k n imyw-mw Snc.i n.k brynt "I place fear of you in (n for m) those who are in the water (determined with a hippopotamus), I repel for you the one on the nt"; see Edfou IV, 214.6. I suspect that the second clause also refers to hippopotami and that the singular hry is a mistake for the plural; in any event, it is clear from these parallel statements that one is in a body of water (mw) but on a water survace (nt). The notion of "penetrating the surface of the water" to assure the ability of aquatic animals to breathe is eminently suitable to the context of the line. It should be clear enough that while the wording of the Hibis version provides an adequate sense, the wording is awkward, and the sense is inferior to what is in the Taharqa parallel. Once again, I am led to suggest that what appears at Hibis is the result of an error caused by a lacuna, quite possibly one in the papyrus Vorlage at Hibis. Figure 6 shows how a writing of nt, rather badly in lacuna, could have resulted in an erroneous interpretation ti mr. The water determinative as shown in the drawing could not really be restored as mr, because the middle line would have been shared by the mr hoe and the top of the r, but I suspect that the artisan felt convinced of the reading ti and then allowed what he saw to guide his imagination, perhaps - as mentioned just above - under the additional influence of the mr(w) "desirous" in the accompanying addresses to the bas of Amun. As stated in note ae above, the sign forms in figures 5 and 6 are taken from the "Takelothis" column of Miller, Palaographie III because the Vorlage could have been at least as old as the reign of Taharqa; the next column is Saite in date. The examples in the Palaographie are only intended as a representative sample, nor was the creation of the papyrus affected by the proposed lacuna ncessarily as old as the reign of Taharqa. If the top two lines of the water determinative were connected by a ligature at the right and if the left end of the sign was lost, and all the more so Fig. 6. M &gt; t3 mr.</page><page sequence="40">198 D. Lorton SAK 21 of the accompanying illustration, is only to propose a plausible mechanism for the occurrence of the error. Less clear is the reason for the m after srk in the Hibis version, for "desirous that throats breathe" would have been meaningful in and of itself. aI) The signs of m rnf n are partly in lacuna. The bird sign, also partly in lacuna, that follows has been taken as a jabiru bird by most of the translators and rendered as a singular despite the plural strokes after the word. The exceptions are Brugsch, who did not attempt a rendering (Reise, 49), and Assmann, who rendered the end of the line as "'GEB', Gott der Fische und der Krokodile" (AHG, 290), perhaps under the influence of his understanding of mr(w) srk m kbbwt as "den die Skorpione lieben in der Erde". The understanding of a singular noun ba is confirmed by the Taharqa parallel; note also the mistaken plural imyw in line 9 of the present text. The expression imyw mw is determined by a crocodile in both the Hibis and the Taharqa versions. The word can be determined by both a fish and a crocodile (see Wb. I, 74.7) and thus mean "aquatic animals" more generally; in one instance in the temple of Edfu, its determinative shows it to be a reference to hippopotami (see the previous note). Though the Hibis and Taharqa versions both have only the crocodile determinative, the expression must have been intended to be understood with its wider sense, for crocodiles (and hippopotami) breathe air, while the ability of fish to breathe is clearly what this line is about; cf. the remarks of Barucq and Daumas, Hymnes et prieres, 313, n. s. Brugsch's hand copy shows a consonantal sign fa in the writing of mhw, while the drawing in the Davies publication does not. Cruz-Uribe seems to have found no error in his collation of the latter publication (see HTP I, 121), so Brugsch was evidently in error. The word is determined by a crocodile here; the end of the line is in lacuna in the Taharqa parallel. There, there is a five-square lacuna, while the Hibis version, whose signs are of differing sizes, can be said to write the word with four "squares". It is perhaps more likely that the Taharqa version had a fuller writing of ntr mhw than that it had an additional word. In light of the evidently metaphorical use of sdrw "sleepers" for serpents (see note aj above), one might question whether this is really a separate word for crocodiles, as it is listed in Wb. II, 122.20, as opposed to a special application of a participle of the verb mhi "to swim" (Wb. II, 121 (bottom) - 122.11; the noun mhw, ibid. 13-14, seems also not really to be a separate word). The word mhw appears in the Magical Papyrus Harris, evidently in reference to a crocodile but determined by water signs; this led O. Lange to understand it as "the swimming one", and he plausibly took the usage there as euphemistic; see Der magische Papyrus Harris, Det Kgl. Danske Videnskabernes Selskab, Historisk-filologiske Meddelelser XIV, 2, 13. Something of this sort seems already to have been the understanding of Brugsch, who rendered it "der</page><page sequence="41">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 199 Taucher in den Fluthen"; see Reise, 49. In commenting on imyw-mw in this line, Goyon referred to it as an "expression of supremacy over aquatic creatures"; see Edifice of Taharqa, 72, n. 42. The expression was explained differently above, but the observation seems particularly apt in regard to mhw. In Goyon's note, he also suggests that the allusion is to Amun of Luxor in his manifestation as a crocodile. This is a slip; in the principal source he cites (Sethe, Amun, 117), the crocodile is said to be a form of Montu. In the labels of the depictions of the ten bas of Amun, which were most kindly put at my disposal by Dr. Traunecker, the ninth ba is explicitly referred to as Shedty, the god of Crocodilopolis in the Fayum. I suspect this is a secondary, variant interpretation (see also below); I think it unlikely that someone at Thebes or Hibis would have seen in the generalized wording of the invocation hymn a reference to a specific, non-local crocodile god. am) In the Hibis text, a lacuna affects the first word of the line. The top of the cnh sign is preserved, while the drawing shows most of a narrow n and bits of the h; cf. the narrowest writing of cnh in line 10 above. While Brugsch's hand copy is not entirely reliable, it is worth noting that the wall surface might have been less damaged in his day, for he seems to have made out more of the cnh sign and the h (which is evidently placed a little too high in his drawing), though he does not confirm the n; see Reise, PI. XV. In this kind of drawing, however, it is difficult to tell how much is faithful reproduction of traces and how much is interpretation. On the rendering of cnh as "who comes alive", see note ab above. The word is followed by a fairly well preserved owl m, a hpr sign, and a writing pwy determined by walking legs. In the Taharqa parallel, virtually all of an cnh sign appears at the top in the drawing, followed by a lacuna of roughly one and a third squares, under which is a relatively flat oval sign, followed by a p and a wing. A ribs m and a hpr sign might have been in the lacuna if the signs were somewhat small; alternatively, there might have been only a hpr, thus, "who comes to life, the beetle". On the basis of the drawing, Goyon rendered "living on earth (Edifice of Taharqa, 72), clearly assuming there was only a preposition in the lacuna. Cruz-Uribe rendered, "He who lives in the land", referring to the Edifice of Taharqa citation just mentioned and also to a use of the beetle sign to write ti elsewhere at Hibis; see HTP I, 121, with n. 675. Taking account of the pwy of the Hibis version, Goyon took the p and wing to be a "sportive writing" of pit "to fly"; see Edifice of Taharqa, 73, n. 44. The drawing in Edifice of Taharqa, however, is evidently misleading. I suspected that what appears there as an oval might actually be a forearm, worn at both ends, and Dr. Larson and Profs. Wente and Johnson, after studying the contact print, have reported that the forearm indeed could occur here, since they were able to make out a more well defined vertical trace at the left of the sign than the light</page><page sequence="42">200 D. Lorton SAK 21 stippling in the drawing would make it seem (personal communication, dated 29 July 1993). In the Taharqa version, then, there seems to have been a participle of the verb cpi "to fly" (Wb. I, 179.17-21). Pwy is an attested writing of pi "to fly" in the Ramesside period (see Wb. I, 494); it is at least possible, however, that its occurrence in the Hibis version is the result of a textual corruption somewhere along the line in the transmission of the text, for the verb cpi is more apporpriate to the image. The image evoked verbally here as "the beetle who flies" is, of course, the winged beetle cpy (Wb. I, 179.22), a form of the sun who is here being invoked at dawn. cpy is also mentioned (the name is written ideographically) just below this text, in the accompanying addresses to the bas of Amun; see Hibis III, PL XXXI, line 19. It is also possible, if not probable, that the mention of hpr is intended to call to mind HprrlHpri, the name that identifies the sun with the hpr mode of being that characterizes the created cosmos; see Allen, Genesis in Egypt, 10. R sts(w) bbw was rendered by Brugsch as "um zu rufen zur Auferstehung Millionen [von Todten ...]" (Reise, 49), an understanding that accords with the reference to the deceased at the end of the line. However, he did not see, or at least he did not record, the cnh sign that follows the word fafaw. Scharff rendered, "um die Millionen hochzu heben" (Sonnenlieder, 89), an understanding that was followed by Barucq and Daumas (Hymnes et prieres, 313) and Cruz-Uribe (HTP I, 121). Only Assmann understood the phrase to mean "zum Luftraum", which is surely the correct understanding, for it completes the reference to the rising sun as the winged beetle flying up to the sky. On the image of a single hh-goA or a plurality of #/*-gods lifting up the sky, see Sethe, Amun, 94-95. The more common image of the sky as sts(w) &amp;w "the lifting of Shu" occurs in the accompanying addresses to the bas of Amun; see Hibis III, PL XXXI, line 39. In the Taharqa parallel, an oval appears after stsy, followed by a ribs m, and the remainder of the line is lost. Inspection of the contact print of the photograph led Dr. Larson to suggest that the oval is an error for the strong arm sign serving as a determinative of stsy (personal communication, dated 29 July 1993); see Wb. IV, 361. The inspection of the photograph also verified the m, so the Taharqa version clearly had some variant expression here. an) After cnh, some short phrase, plus m rn.fn, plus the beginning of the name Nhb-k3(w) are in lacuna. Cruz-Uribe's collation confirms the reading krsw for the sign partly in lacuna near the lend of the line; see HTP I, 121, n. 676. There is an easy connection to be made between the rising sun and the funerary references in the latter part of the line, which have to do with the deceased in the cemeteries. Sources from the New Kingdom on attest to a relationship between the light</page><page sequence="43">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 201 of the rising sun and the tomb, and even more specifically to the ?a-statue and the body of the deceased; see J. Assmann, in: JEA 65, 1979, 57 and 62-63, n. (h). In the hymn, each invocation line describes a quality of the god and then gives it a name. Each line must therefore have its own connected sense, and in the commentary, an attempt has been made to discover that sense and how the various epithets and turns of phrase relate to it. Qualities of the solar creator god are being invoked, and it has been seen that the various references in the lines are either to the rising sun or sunrise, or to the special concerns of the individual line. It remains to discuss what can be discerned regarding the structure of the invocations as a whole, beginning at the level of the individual line. To date, the only scholars who have attempted this in print are Assmann31 and Goyon32. Assmann has discerned a tripartite structure, which he labels "Anrede"," 'in seinem Namen,'" and "Gott der ...33." The third category does not appear in each line, and I would therefore argue that it has no status as a category of the formal structure of each line, though it could be seen as a subcategory in those lines in which it occurs. This can also be demonstrated from the evidence. The Magical Papyrus Harris contains quite similar material, though formulated in the second person, and it is provided with verse points. There, each statement has two verse points, one before the phrase m rn.k pwy n and one at the end of the line34. Thus, the evidence suggests that we take each invocation line in the present text as something akin to a "thought couplet"35 comprised of a description and a name. The number of invocation lines is an even one, and the references to the sun and the moon in lines 5 and 6 raises the possibility that the lines might form five pairs. A 31 AHG, 578-579. 32 Edifice of Taharqa, 85. 33 In his chart, the fourth column, headed "Leben", refers to a separate contentual issue that will be discussed below. 34 Lange, Der magische Papyrus Harris, 19-22. This material could conceivably comprise the invoca tion lines of a text like that considered here, but the text as given in the papyrus does not contain a refrain line corresponding to line 4 (and 15) of the present text. (It is just possible that the preceding material, ibid., 17-19, serves as an introduction to these lines; but if it is a refrain, its length and content bespeak a cultic context rather different from that of the text studied here.) Its second-person formulations seem more in accordance with our own logic than the third-person invocations of the present text, but ancient logic in such matters was different from our own; see D. Sweeney, in: Fs Lichtheim II, 943-979. 35 For this concept, see especially J.L. Foster, in: JNES 34, 1975, 1-29 and Thought Couplets and Clause Sequences in a Literary Text: The Maxims of Ptah-Hotep, SSEA Publications 5, 8-34.</page><page sequence="44">202 D. Lorton SAK 21 glance at the content of the text, however, shows that they do not. If anything, with their mention of various kinds of animals, lines 11-13 could be said to form a triplet. Assmann has noted that every other line of the invocations contains an expression with the word "life"; the fourth column of his chart shows that he recognizes it in the lines numbered here as 6, 8, 10, 12, and 1436. This, however, is not correct. Line 11 contains the expression cnh-\xr "alive of face," and would thus have to be taken into account as an occurrence. Further, because of the misplacement of the text "fragment" in Davies' publication, Assmann did not realize that line 5, which contains the phrase cnh(w) dt "who lives forever", was one of the invocations. Thus, the pattern does not exist. Visually, the alternation of groups of three short lines and two long lines is a salient feature of the Hibis version. Given the rather different appearance of the Taharqa version at Karnak, it is unclear whether this was an accidental result of the orthographies employed, or whether the effect was intentional at Hibis. I suspect the latter was the case, but again, a perusal of the content of the lines does not reveal any meaningful organization of thought within each of these four groups. If intentional, then, this arrangement would seem to have resulted from aesthetic rather than contentual motives. If, however, one considers the lines as two groups of five, some organization begins to emerge. There seems to be no special coherence or pattern in what is said in the earlier parts of the lines, but the names and die additional qualifications ("god of ...", where these occur) do indeed constitute a pattern. This idea receives some formal support from the fact that "god of..." appears in each of the last five lines, where the god is brought into a relationship with various kinds of terrestrial beings (this includes the deceased, considered as residing in their tombs). In the preceding group of five lines, the phrase "god of ..." appears only in line 6, where it serves the special purpose of making an allusion to the god Thoth; see note 1 in the commentary. That we have here two groups of lines was already apprehended by Goyon, whose comments should be quoted in full here: These appelations unambiguously define the god as a demiurge, at the same time the origin and the symbol of the cosmos, concentrating in himself all the creative features of the great divinities of Egypt. In his astral aspect, he is Re, the sun, and he is also the moon. He is the air (Amun who lives in everything, the vital breath), he is the world of water (Nun), he is the earth and the symbol of the death and resurrection of nature (Rs-wdi) in its cosmic aspect. As a demiurge, he is the source of life, the god 36 AHG, 578.</page><page sequence="45">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 203 of terrestrial animals, of creatures of the air and of the water, of amphibians and reptiles37. Further explication occurs in his accompanying footnote: The following equivalences are certain: nswt-ki (sic) cnh = life; Bi biw = animals; Hr-ihty = birds; Bi imy.w-mw = water creatures; Nfab-ki.w =reptiles38. While I would agree with Goyon's basic perception regarding two groups of lines, the presentation is otherwise not without problems. The terms "astral" and "demiurge" are not happy choices. "Astral" refers to the stars, which are not mentioned in the text; an expression such as "realm of the gods" or "cosmic forces" would better describe the concern of the first five invocation lines. "Demiurge" is misleading, for it is normally used in the Platonic or gnostic sense of a creator god who is the subordinate of (Platonic) or inferior to (gnostic) the supreme deity: Amun-Re is certainly the creator, but he is most assuredly also the supreme god. What has just been noted is likely the result of too literal a translation of Goyon's manuscript for the Edifice of Taharqa publication; the terms are used differently in French and English. I also do not agree with the equivalences made in the footnote. In his text, Goyon makes special note of various sorts of creatures singled out for mention in the second half of these lines; in line 10, the emphasis is surely on humans, designated fanmmt, and not on the notion of life (see also above on Assmann's observation that concern with "life" is pervasive in the text and scarcely confined to this line). In line 11, the expression bi-biw appears to refer to the rising sun (see note af in the commentary above), and the real emphasis seems to be on the final words cwt mnmnt, which continue the enumeration of kinds of terrestrial beings. In line 12, I doubt that the deity Horakhty would be invoked simply as a metaphor for birds; his mention seems rather to be connected with the divine imagery in the first part of the line, and again the stress is on the last word, which I take to be a reference to serpents (see note aj in the commentary). In line 13, I agree that the reference is to aquatic creatures (see note al in the commentary). Finally, in line 14, if the sdrw "sleeping ones" of line 12 are indeed serpents, we would not expect to see a reference to them again here. Though a serpent in form, Neheb-kau was a funerary god, and again the real emphasis is on the mention of the deceased at the end of the line. In sum, Goyon attempted to find the significance of the last five lines in his imaginative interpretations of the names of the god, whereas the real focus seems to be on the enumeration of beings that follow the words "god of in each of these lines. 37 Edifice of Taharqa, 85. 38 Ibid., n. 55. In the pages kindly sent by Dr. Traunecker from his thesis "Les Cryptes du temple d'Opet a Karnak," there is some agreement with these interpretations, though they are not the same in all cases.</page><page sequence="46">204 D. Lorton SAK 21 But again, I think that Goyon was basically right in his distinction of two groups of lines. The first five invocation lines call upon the god in various cosmic aspects, while the next five invoke him in connection with terrestrial concerns. Indeed, the last five lines seem to comprise, after their own fashion, a "Naturlehre"39. It was noted above that although the sun and the moon (lines 5 and 6) are a natural pair, this coupling of complementary entities does not set the pattern for the remainder of the text. But if we think of the ten invocation lines as comprising two groups of five, some sense of organization begins to emerge. While each line expresses a different concern, there is an obvious relationship between Re in line 5 and Res-udja in line 9, where it is clear from the imagery that the reference is to Osiris as the nighttime aspect of Re. Thus, the group of five lines begins and ends with solar references. Once that connection is recognized, it is easy to see that it is paralleled in the second half of the text with references to living humans in line 10 and the deceased in line 14. Again, thinking of two groups of five lines, one can see that their respective first and last lines are conceptually related. The list of cosmic references begins with Re, and the enumeration of terrestrial concerns contains a royal reference; there is, of course, a relationship beetween the solar god and the divine aspect of the king expressed by the phrase "living royal ka"40. This connection between the solar god as head of the pantheon and the king as ruler on earth has something of a parallel in the lines that close the two groups, where there are references to Osiris, who rules the netherworld (line 9), and to the deceased in the cemeteries (line 14). In short, each group of five invocations forms its own closure, created by its first and last lines, and the two are construed in parallelism to one another. Finally, what was stated in note z of the commentary should be noted again here. In making the sunlight at dawn, the solar creator god manifests himself to his creation in this world, and the latter is clearly the concern of the second group of invocation lines. It is likely, then, that it is by intent that the very last words of the first group of lines are ir(w) sSp, "who makes the light", i.e., the light of dawn, thus creating a bridge between the two groups of lines. Thus far, the focus has been on the first and last lines of the groups. It is indeed interesting to note the patterns they form, and it is only natural to wonder whether there are further relationships within and between the two groups of lines. Almost 39 On the concept "Naturlehre", see, e.g., J. Assmann, in: SAK 8, 1980, 24-25. The concern with the sustenance of animal life by air and plant life by water in the first parts of lines 7 and 8 constitutes a Naturlehre element there as well, and they admittedly relate to terrestrial concerns. These references do not, however, seem to be a part of any larger pattern within the text. 40 See the study by Bell cited in note ad of the commentary.</page><page sequence="47">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 205 surprisingly, there do not seem to be any that add up to a meaningful pattern. The pairing of sun and moon in lines 4 and 5 is not paralleled by a pair in lines 10 and 11. Such concerns as do appear in both groups are asymetrically located: the verb tSS "to spit/cough up" in line 7 (the third line of the first group) and line 11 (the second line of the second group); srk "to breathe, breath" in line 7 (the third line of the first group) and line 13 (the fourth line of the second group); and Nun in line 8 (the fourth line of the first group) and line 10 (the first line of the second group). (Nun also occurs in the phrase "Outpouring of Nun" in line 5.) Since two groups of five invocations are recognized here, it might be useful to return to the expression "great names" in line 3 of the text. Given that these are "names" of Amun-Re, they could easily be qualified as "great"41. But rn-wr is also a term for the fivefold royal titulary42. It is just possible, then, that the employment of the expression intentionally calls attention to the names as two groups of five. The first element of the royal titulary is the Horus name; Horus is in fact named at the beginning of line 10 (the first line of the second group, with its royal reference, and its own possible reference to the royal titulary; see note aa in the commentary), and the case for this suggestion would be stronger if a reference to Horus indeed appeared at the beginning of line 5 (the first line of the first group). But there is in fact a problem there (see note h in the commentary), so the point must remain uncertain. Even if it were to turn out that the reference in line 5 was indeed to Horus, it seems it would not be possible to press the point any further, for the various references in the remaining lines of each group do not appear in any way to recall the other elements of the royal titulary. Still, it is possible to suggest, though with due reservation, that the two groups of five names were regarded as constituting, on a symbolic level, two "titularies". It would be worthwhile to conclude by considering larger structural connections. The first one has to do with the hymn considered here and its relationship to the material just below and to the right of it that, visually, so obviously accompanies it. In the edifice of Taharqa, where the parallel to the hymn studied above appears on the west wall of room F, the accompanying parallel material occupies the south and north walls of the room43. There, though much is lost, just enough remains to show that ten figures were depicted, five on each wall, all facing towards the east wall. The material on these three walls is thus conceptually and cultically related (see below); unfortunately, so very 41 Cf. Wb. II, 427.22. 42 Wb. II, 427.20. 43 Edifice of Taharqa, Pis. 28-29. For earlier publications of part of this material, see Prisse, Monu ments, PI. XXXIV and Leclant, Mon. Thebains, PI. XXXIV.</page><page sequence="48">206 D. Lorton SAK 21 little of the decoration of the east wall survives that its significance and the connection of its content to that of the other three must remain obscure44. Arranged in front of and above each of the figures is the accompanying textual material; clear dividing lines (as well as the content of the material) show that the parallel material at Hibis, which has heretofore always been rendered as a single text, is actually a series of discrete addresses to the entities, all of which were originally depicted in Taharqa's edifice, though not at Hibis. From what is preserved of the iconography in the edifice of Taharqa, and from the wording of most of the accompanying labels at Opet, it is clear that this set of ten figures had a parallel in the as yet unpublished north crypt of the Ptolemaic period temple of Opet at Karnak45. The labels there identify the figures as ten bas of Amun, and there is so much correspondence between the content of the labels that name the figures and the verbal material of the invocation hymn studied here that it is clear that the "names" with which the hymn addresses the god are in fact the names of the ten bas46. The labels in the temple of Opet do not, however, entirely correspond to the wording in the temple of Hibis and the edifice of Taharqa. I am particularly suspicious of the iconography and label of the fifth ba of Opet, which corresponds to the name in line 9 of the invocation hymn. The hymn stresses the nighttime sun surrounded by his flaming nimbus, while the figure and its label at Opet stress fire and do not mention the god. In this regard, it is especially unfortunate that the iconography and the accompanying text of this figure in the edifice of Taharqa have been almost completely lost. Just enough survives to make it clear that the figure is female, as at Opet. What little remains of the text includes the words hpr.s m bs(w) "she becomes flame", which might seem suggestive, but the very next line contains dif"he gives (or "causes")", while the end of the last preserved line reads m thhw "in exultation"47, which looks like a reference to the coming sunrise (see note z of the commentary); thus, while the preserved evidence is 44 Ibid, PI. 30. 45 A drawing of the figures themselves, without their accompanying labels, has been published by CI. Traunecker, Les Dieux de l'Egypte, 1992, 97, fig. 8. They are mentioned by Baines, Fecundity Figures, 130-131. The labels are discussed, with translation and commentary accompanied by a translation of and commentary on the invocation hymn by Dr. Traunecker in his thesis, "Les Cryptes du temple d'Opet a Karnak". 46 Goyon thought that Amun had ten names and ten bas, and that he probably had ten kas as well; see Edifice of Taharqa, 85. Based only on what is preserved at Hibis, I had suspected that the names were in fact the names of the bas, and I was gratified to learn that Dr. Traunecker, with the evidence from the Opet crypt at his disposal, not only anticipated my suggestion but is in a position to demonstrate it. 47 See Edifice of Taharqa, PI. 28 and 73, with n. 5.</page><page sequence="49">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 207 ambiguous, there is some reason to think that the god was indeed the focus of the address. Goyon had the Opet material at his disposal, and his interpretation of the hymn, which was noted above, was inspired in part by the hymn itself and in part by the Opet labels. Since the labels are material being prepared for publication by Dr. Traunecker, it would be inappropriate for me to discuss them at length here. Rather, I shall simply note that I have a strong impression that the Opet parallel represents a (secondary?) variant understanding of the ten bas of Amun-Re: if this is indeed the case, then it cannot really be used to interpret the hymn. It is for this reason that in the preceding commentary and discussion, the suggested interpretations were centered on the preserved copies of the hymn itself and on its evident internal organization. Just enough survives in the edifice of Taharqa to provide a fair amount of help in identifying the ends of the addresses preserved at Hibis. While the very last words of the address to the first ba have not survived there, it is clear from what is preserved in the Taharqa parallel that the end of the address at Hibis is s$m(w) cnhw cnh(w) dt "the leader of the living, may he live forever"48; part of the word dt appears just below the lacuna at Hibis. By combining what is preserved in the edifice of Taharqa with what is preserved at the temple of Hibis, where the last words of the address happen to be in lacuna, it can be determined that the end of the address to the second ba is [nn] ib cnh(w) dt "[without] ceasing, living forever"49. So much of the end of the address to the third ba and that of the beginning of the address to the fourth is lost in the Taharqa parallel that it is essentially impossible to determine the precise dividing point between them at Hibis. Since the two addresses were of equal length in the Taharqa version, it is likely to have fallen midway between the beginning of the address to the third ba (in line 36) and the end of the address to the fourth ba (line 44), i.e., somewhere in line 40 of the Hibis text. There might be some problematic in this, for the address to the first ba begins, "you are Amun, you are Atum", and those to the second and third bas begin with "(oh) ba of Amun", while no corresponding material is to be found in line 40 at Hibis, or in lines 39 or 41. It is not possible to tell, however, whether this is really a problem, for the beginnings of the addresses to the fourth through the tenth bas are lost in the edifice of Taharqa: perhaps what occurs at the beginnings of the first three addresses does not really constitute a pattern or patterns for the rest. The same could be true of the phrase cnhw dt that ends the first two addresses, and which also does not appear in lines 39-41, a point confirmed by the end of the fourth address, and by the 48 Hibis III, P. XXXI, line 22. 49 Ibid., line 36. For the restoration nn, see Goyon, Edifice of Taharqa, 75, n. 38. In the Demotic parallel, we find the odd variant m sp ir rc nb cnh dt "in a time (?), every day, living forever"; see Enchoria 7, 1977, 121 and 127, line 30.</page><page sequence="50">208 D. Lorton SAK 21 preserved ends of some of the others in the edifice of Taharqa. At Hibis, evidently for lack of available wall space, only the first four addresses appear. In the two versions, the final words of the fourth address are not identical. The Taharqa version ends with the somewhat enigmatic ihtf m ch wnnf cnh(w) dt "his horizon, in the palace of his existence, living forever", while the Hibis version reads, cnh(w) cnh(w).tw im.fdt "living one, from whom one lives, forever"50. The intertextual relationships among the addresses to the bas, and between them and the invocation hymn, must have been complex. For instance, cpy, the winged beetle who is verbally imaged in line 14 of the invocation hymn, i.e., the line naming the tenth ba, is mentioned in the address to the first be?1, suggesting that intentional symmetries could be at work in the textual material, among other possible relationships. The address to the second ba, who is the moon, begins with "(oh) ba of Amun, who is in his right eye"52, i.e., a reference to the sun, who is in fact the first ba (line 5 of the invocation hymn). In the same vein, though the third ba is named "ba of Shu" (line 7 of the invocation hymn), the address to him begins, "(oh) ba of Amun, who is in his left eye, the moon (icb) in the sky"53, i.e., a reference to the second ba. Other instances could be cited, but it is not necessary to belabor the matter. What is clear is that it is indeed unfortunate that we do not have a fully preserved version of the addresses to the ten bas, for the ability to explore the full extent and nature of these interrelationships would in all likelihood have been rewarding. What remains puzzling, in what we have, is the address to the fourth ba, the inundation (cf. line 8 of the invocation hymn): though a reference to the Nile flood does indeed occur in line 40 of the Hibis text (the Taharqa version is poorly preserved at this point), the address seems peculiarly preoccupied with air, which is the third ba. There are other attestations of multiple bas and "names" (and kas, as well) of the solar creator god. For instance, the king offers to four bas at Medinet Habu54, thus bringing back at least to Dyn. XX the practice of following the word ba by its name, as in the Opet material noted above. There is also a "litany of the twelve names of Re" 50 See Edifice of Taharqa, PI. 28B, line 45 and Hibis III, PI. XXXI, line 44. With this, it is also clear that the Demotic parallel published in Enchoria 7, 1977, 115-149 contains a complete version of the addresses to the first two bas of Amun-Re. What can be established with the help of the Taharqa version was recognized by J. Osing in his review of Edifice of Taharqa. Somehow, though, he erred and reported that the Hibis version contained the addresses to the first three bas of the god and the Demotic version the address to the first ba; see Or. 53, 1984, 446-467. 51 See Hibis III, PI.

See also n. 60 below. Some seem to have small faith in the understanding of Middle Egyptian grammar in the Ptolemaic period, but in my readings of texts from Edfu and Denderah, I find the grammar to be not unlike that of the Middle Egyptian of Dyn. XVIII. Additionally, excessive distrust of the grammar can lead to undisciplined readings of the texts. Consequently, I prefer to understand the grammar of the texts as Middle Egyptian wherever possible, and here, I take the negative constructions as nn "without" plus infinitive; see Gardiner, EG3 ? 307. 59 On s?ti "form", see Wb. IV, 299.14, where, by the position of the entry, it is clearly taken as deriv ed from the root sSti having to do with hiddenness or mysteriousness. 60 On the problem of the referent of .sn, see also n. 58 above. For this extended passage to make any sense at all, it must be drtywy wrwy, i.e., Horakhty and Horus of Edfu, the two aforementioned forms of the sun god who "emerges" on the eastern horizon every morning. Cf. also note ab in the commentary above. 61 N for m, perhaps because of a dissimilation caused by the initial labial ofthe following word bi. 62 A participle is required here, and I take the three striding jackals as a sportive writing of ii(w) "who comes (back)." 63 Edfou IV, 384.15-16. What follows, along with a similar passage, Edfou VII, 116, top, 2-4, are of considerable theological significance. To the best of my knowledge, they have never been translated and discussed, perhaps because of the unusual nature of their content.</page><page sequence="52">210 D. Lorton SAK 21 is not entirely clear here that the "names" in this passage are those of die seven bas - the one-square lacuna near the beginning of the passage adds to the unclarity, as does the problem of interpretation noted in n. 56 - the overall context, as well as the evidence of the invocation hymn, suggest that they are. In regard to the evidence of the context itself, note also that the " 'names' of his bas1' are immediately defined as "the mysterious forms of the majesty ..." of the god. In the introductory discussion, it was noted that the invocation hymn was a part of the daily cult ritual. From the physical juxtaposition of the addresses to the bas to the hymn in both the edifice of Taharqa and the temple of Hibis, as well as from the close contentual relationship between the hymn and the addresses, it is clear that the latter were also a part of the cult ritual in these temples. Given the length of the total, one might indeed wonder whether all this material was recited daily, or whether it was recited only on special festival occasions, such as the decade festivals (cf. the discussion below). The relative speed with which the material was recited, cantillated or sung might be a pertinent factor, but it represents an unknown and indeed an unknowable, while ordinary considerations of reverence suggest a relatively measured pace. It is perhaps worth noting that the five hymns invoking Amun-Re to awaken in P. Berlin 3055 are themselves, collectively, of some length, but unfortunately, the same uncertainty arises as to whether all of them were recited on a daily basis64. Performatively, there are three logical possibilities for the joint recital of the hymn and the addresses. One, of course, is the performance of the hymn, followed by that of the addresses. Alternatively, the recital of each invocation line (enclosed in the refrain) might have been followed by the address to the corresponding ba. The third alternative has to do with the possibility just noted that the addresses to the bas might have been recited only on festival days; if this was the case, then the invocation hymn was recited on a daily basis, while for special days, the first two alternatives come into play as subalternatives. There are no adequate grounds for choosing one or another of the first two alternatives or the subalternatives of the third. But conceptually tempting as the idea might be of the intercalation of the hymn's individual invocation lines with the addresses, some real weight must be accorded to the visual distinctness of the hymn in both temples: in the edifice of Taharqa, the hymn occupies a wall of its own, flanked by the two walls depicting the bas with their addresses, while in the temple of Hibis, the hymn occupies a distinctive "box" of its own. 64 See Moret, Rituel du culte, 121-138. The same question as to whether it was recited in its entirety on a daily basis has been raised, but left unresolved, in regard to the similar material at Edfu; see H.W. Fairman, in: BRL 37, 1954, 179.</page><page sequence="53">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 211 In the course of the commentary on the invocation hymn, references were made not only to the text of the accompanying addresses to the ten bas of Amun, but also to the hymnic material in the middle register of the same wall, to the left of the doorway, and to the hymnic material in the middle register of the adjoining south wall: the lesson of the addresses to the bas suggests that it is prudent to employ the expression "hymnic material", for these lengthy inscriptions might also be comprised of shorter texts, run in together. From the fact of these connections, as well as from even a casual perusal of these materials, it is clear that their contents, too, are related to those of the hymn and the addresses. This might seem a trivial observation of the obvious, given that the texts are all in the same temple, and even in the same room. The significance, however, lies in the fact that this is a substantial amount of material, and that with it at our disposal, we have a considerable portion of the theology of the temple. Further, the fact that the invocation hymn is addressed to the "names/qualities" of Amun-Re of Thebes ("lord of the thrones of the Two Lands") and Hibis suggests that Darius built the temple as an outpost of Theban religion65, and with the parallel version of some of the Hibis material in the earlier edifice of Taharqa we indeed have confirmation that Hibis was a satellite of a Late Period Theban cult and theology that can be traced back to the "Ethiopian" dynasty, a good century and a half earlier. And, it is a theology well worth further, careful study, for taking the characteristic Egyptian multiplicity of approaches almost to an extreme, the thinkers who devised it mixed Enneadal and Ogdoadal concerns to such a degree that it would require a considerable effort to work out their theological stance66. There are, however, obstacles that stand in the way of complete success in such an undertaking. In addition to lacunae in the texts, we know from the edifice of Taharqa that we are missing most of the lengthy introduction to the invocation hymn, as well as the addresses to six of the ten bas of the god. This is enough to show that while what was put on the available wall space was material considered to be important, it was evidently a part of a larger body, of undeterminable size, of textual material whose ritual 65 It is, of course, more than just that, as shown by the depictions in the sanctuary, and to some extent elsewhere in the temple; see Cruz-Uribe, Archaeology 42/5, September/October 1989, 51-52. But, as Cruz-Uribe's observations otherwise affirm, it was the great Theban god Amun-Re who was supreme at Hibis. 66 An excellent beginning was made by Sethe, Amun, who made considerable use of the Hibis material in his study. He was, however, limited to Brugsch's incomplete and imperfect "Reise", and his work reflects the methods and intellectual concerns of an earlier generation. It can only be hoped that the editio princeps represented by Davies, Hibis III and Cruz-Uribe, HTP I, will serve as an invitation to further study of this fascinating material.</page><page sequence="54">212 D. Lorton SAK 21 (as opposed to monumental) form would have been, for the most part, on papyrus67. Still, this is not a cause for undue pessimism: as the commentary offered here demonstrates, in attempting to understand these materials, there is a great deal of help to be had from the interreferential character of the preserved texts themselves, as well as from other sources, especially New Kingdom hymns and the temples of the Ptolemaic period. A curious circumstance regarding the hymnic materials, and especially the invocation hymn and the addresses, is their location. On the principle of "Wandrelief und Raum funktion", what is found on the walls of a room should relate to the cultic function of that room; it can also happen that such material is "displaced" to the/an adjacent room, where it will be found on the wall with the doorway leading into the room in question68. The daily cult ritual was typically performed in the sanctuary, and in the case of the similar invocation material from Edfu mentioned in the introductory discussion (see n. 4), it is carved on the fa9ade of the sanctuary. At Hibis, however, where the sanctuary is approached through a series of three hypostyle halls, the invocation hymn and addresses are carved on the far wall of the second hypostyle hall, to the right of the doorway leading to the third hall, so that the texts are at least a full room away from where one would expect to find them. While the location of the parallel material in the edifice of Taharqa shows that the ritual could be performed in other places, this is nevertheless a special case (see below). While it would not be possible to disprove a suggestion that the location of these texts shows that the cult ritual was performed in the third hypostyle hall or even the second, if not daily then on the occasion of special festivals, I suspect this would be too rigorous an application of the idea of "Wandrelief und Raumfunktion". Hibis exhibits an unusual decorative scheme, in that the walls of the sanctuary are covered with a multitude of representations of cult statues of deities of various locales in Egypt, while the third hypostyle hall just before it is given over to material having to do with offerings. Thus, I would suggest that it was the decision making process regarding the decoration of these rooms that resulted in the displacement of the invocation hymn and the addresses (and perhaps the other hymnic materials as well), given the desire to include them, to their actual location. Turning to the Edifice of Taharqa, the invocation hymn and addresses to the bas of the god preserved to us do not occur in connection with the sanctuary. In fact, the superstructure of the building is nearly entirely destroyed, though surviving fragments 67 For a review of temple libraries and their contents, see G. Burkard, in: Bibliothek Forschung und Praxis 4, 1980, 79-115. 68 See D. Arnold, Wandrelief, 105 and 127-128.</page><page sequence="55">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 213 of an architrave inscription from the forecourt69 inform us that the building was erected for "Re-Harakhty (who is) upon the temple of the domain of Amun"70, evidently here syncretized with, or a form of, Amun-Re. There, at the back (i.e., the west end) of the building, a staircase (A) leads to a small area (room B); turning right, one enters another small room (C), and then, turning left, one enters a series of three rooms (D, E, F) that run from west to east. The invocation hymn is on the west wall of room F, while the bas and the addresses to them are on the south and north walls. I am in agreement with the basic interpretation of the purpose of the underground chambers by Goyon and Parker71, that it entailed a nocturnal journey during which the rites of Djeme, i.e., Medinet Habu on the opposite side of the Nile, burial place of Amun Kematef and the deities of the Ogdoad, were celebrated in room E. I do, however, have some points of disagreement and clarification to offer, including some remarks on the place of the invocation hymn and addresses in the larger structure of the chambers and their ritual purpose. First, Goyon is of the opinion that Amun of the temple of Luxor, upon returning from Medinet Habu, stopped off, on his journey back to the temple of Luxor, at the temple of Karnak for a reenactment of the rites of Djeme in the edifice of Taharqa72. He views the addresses to the bas as constituting a rite additional and complementary to those at Djeme, one "celebrating both the reunion of Amun the demiurge with the elements of his creative power (his ten bas) and his rebirth as Re"73. On account of the relatively small size of the underground chambers, he feels that the rites were in fact carried out in the superstructure of the edifice74. I find these interpretations dubious. As already made clear, the invocation and addresses are simply a variant of part of the daily cult ritual, and it is difficult to imagine why Amun of Luxor would celebrate the repetition of the decade festival (the rites of Djeme, celebrated every ten days) in a temple not his own, only to celebrate the 69 Goyon mistakenly thought, from the mention of wsht-hibyt in the inscription, that this was a designation of the temple itself; see Edifice of Taharqa, 81. On wsht-hbyt "forecourt", see Arnold, Wandrelief, 106-115 and P. Spencer, The Egyptian Temple: A Lexicographical Study, 1984, 80-85, with 97, n. 215 on the edifice of Taharqa. 70 See Edifice of Taharqa, 21, fig. 10. Goyon thought the building was dedicated to Amun-^r-f (ibid., 85), but see now M. Smith, in: JEA 74, 1988, 287. 71 Goyon, Edifice of Taharqa, 80-84; Parker, ibid., p. x. 72 Ibid., 82. 73 Ibid., 82. 74 Ibid., 83, n. 39.</page><page sequence="56">214 D. Lorton SAK 21 cult ritual there75. It seems far more logical to think that the divine celebrant of the ritual was the deity to whom the edifice was dedicated, Re-Horakhty, a form of the solar creator god (ultimately, at Karnak, Amun), who in the course of the ritual of Djeme itself assumed the form of the ithyphallic "Amun-^r-r ("raised of arm"), Primeval One of the Two Lands"76. It can be suggested, at least, that the solar form of the god was due to the nocturnal celebration of the rite (see below) in the edifice of Taharqa, so that the god would emerge at daybreak in the form of Re-Horakhty, the rising sun (see note aj in the commentary above). Some confirmation of this lies in the representation over the doorway in the west wall of room E, i.e., marking the path of the reemergence, of a lotus with a falcon, in place of the anthropomorphic Nefertem, standing upon it, along with the label "[...] raised of arm; placing on earth (dit r ti, probably referring to the return of the statue to the surface of the earth)," below which is the inscription, "coming (from?) Djeme, to/for which the one who is in his eye (i.e., the sun) rushed, and whose (i.e., Djeme's) name is Maat"77; this reference to the divine principle of cosmic order is probably a better explanation of the feather in front of the falcon than is a reference to the west (i.e., the netherworld) in which the cult image technically still is. All this - the falcon on the lotus and the inscription - are supported by arms reminiscent of the arms of Nun in the twelfth hour of the Book of Gates (see note ab in the commentary on the iconographic image of the expression pr(w) m Nwn "who emerges from Nun"). Further, as the reemergence continues, the god enters room D, where he is greeted as the rising sun by the king and a group of baboons; the accompanying text mentions Akhty and Re-Horakhty78. 75 Mention is also made of the possible celebration of the "Uniting with the Sun Disk" ritual, ibid., 83 (Goyon) and x (Parker), where Goyon's "perhaps" becomes Parker's "no doubt." The rite just mentioned is one celebrated in the Ptolemaic period (and perhaps earlier, but our evidence is Ptolemaic in date) at New Year's and certain other festival occasions (see Alliot, Culte d'Horus I, 303-433), but we have no confirmation that it was celebrated in connection with the decade festival. 76 See Edifice of Taharqa, PI. 22, line 30 and PI. 24, line 26; on this form ofAmun as the creator god, see the bibliography provided ibid., 59, n. 53. On dsr "raised", see A. Ember, in: ZAS 51, 1913, 120. 77 See Edifice of Taharqa, PI. 22, figure above doorway with 11. 31-32. See ibid., 54 on some of the philological problems in this material, though I differ in overall interpretation of what this all signifies. At the very least, m.s cannot possibly be "his name", as Goyon renders it, for the possessive suffix pronoun .s is feminine. On the iconography of the falcon on the lotus, see Morenz and Schubert, Der Gott auf der Blume, 42-43 and PI. II, Abb. 8. 78 Edifice of Taharqa, PI. 18, 11. 24 and 28. The text, which Goyon identifies as a "complete version of chap. 15B of the Book of the Dead" (ibid., 38, n. 15), is the text studied by J. Assmann, Sonnenpriester. To the list of versions of the text assembled by Assmann in his study, Goyon adds</page><page sequence="57">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 215 If this much can be granted, then it would be easiest to think of the ritual at the edifice of Taharqa as replicating, on the east bank of Thebes and in the Karnak temple complex, the rites of the decade festival of Djeme on the west bank, whose divine celebrant was Amun of Luxor temple; and with that, I would suggest that the ritual was celebrated during the latter's absence, i.e., contemporaneously with his presence at Medinet Habu, thus making the events there especially valid for the city of Thebes and for Karnak itself. I do indeed feel that the chambers make most sense if understood as actually used in the performance of the ritual, and Goyon's reservations regarding the size of the rooms are not in accordance with the preserved evidence. Room E, where the rites of Djeme were reenacted, measures about 3.5 meters by 2.5 meters, which is not terribly small79. Further, in the two scenes from the rites represented in the room, a total of ten human figures are shown80, a number not inconsistent with the size of the room. There were not, however, really this many celebrants in the scenes. As Goyon himself points out81, in the scene on Plate 26 of the publication, where four pairs of officiants are shown, each pair elevating a representation of a deity, the female of each pair is always the God's Wife, while the title of the male officiant changes in three cases (the title of the fourth male officiant is lost). Thus, the evidence attests only to a presence of a maximum of seven people in the room in the two scenes. However, in the scene depicted on Plate 25, one of the celebrants is again the God's Wife, while the other is the king, and thus probably, in reality, the chief officiating priest. Thus the maximum number of different people depicted is six. Nor is there any compelling reason to think that the four priests shown in the rite on Plate 26 were in the room during the performance of the rite shown on Plate 25. For that matter, since the God's Wife elevates four divine figures in succession in the scene on Plate 26, each time with the assistance of a different priest, there is no compelling reason even to think that all four priests were in the room at the same time. None of the above is really meant to suggest there were only two people present in the room at any given time, and indeed, no attention was paid in the foregoing to the likely presence of at least a few assistants to move the paraphernalia of the rites in and out of the room. Rather, the observations were made to point out the importance of an empirical approach to the evidence, and to those on the sarcophagus lids of Aspalta and Anlamani; see Edifice of Taharqa, Pis. 31-33 and 38, n. 15 (Goyon erroneously identifies the tomb of Tjanefer (TT 158) as TT 148 in both the text and the plates). 79 Ibid., PI. 1. 80 Ibid., Pis. 25 and 26. 81 Ibid., 65.</page><page sequence="58">216 D. Lorton SAK 21 counter Goyon's evident unspoken assumption that if a rite was being celebrated, throngs must have been present, if only of priests. Further, if we are indeed to think that the ritual here was an east bank replication of the rites concurrently celebrated at Medinet Habu on the west bank, it might easily have been staged on a smaller scale than the latter. Since Goyon employs the expressions "the nocturnal voyage was finished" and then "solemn appearance of the god in the light of day"82, he seems to be thinking of events that occurred at night. If so, I concur, for the evidence speaks in favor of it. Both the setting sun and the rising sun are greeted83, which strongly suggests a night-long sojourn in these underground chambers, as does the presence of the first hour of the Book of the Night84. Further, the positioning of rooms D to F entails a movement from west to east through the chambers, a likely allusion to the journey of the nighttime sun. The decoration, however, does not on the whole emphasize the nighttime, Osirian form of Re (except for the Litany of Re on the walls of the staircase)85; rather, the emphasis is on the setting and the rising of the sun, and in room E, on the nocturnal replication of the rites of Djeme. The nocturnal nature of the celebration is clear not only from the considerations already raised, but from the location of room E, as well: it can be entered only after the greeting of the setting sun in room D, and upon leaving it, one encounters the greeting of the rising sun, also recorded in room D. The purpose of the rites of Djeme was some sort of reunion with the deities of the Ogdoad, who constituted, in Hermopolitan belief, the primeval chaos. It is thus no coincidence that we find a reference, on the west wall of room E, to the "cavern of Nun on the west bank of heaven, [in She-who-]faces-her-lord"86, i.e., to the west bank of Thebes and in all likelihood Medinet Habu itself87. It is also on this wall that we find the evident representation noted above of the iconography of the anus of Nun lifting the rising sun in the form of a falcon on a lotus88. With all this, the location of the invocation hymn and addresses to the bas of Amun Re in room F becomes clear. This is the easternmost of the series of rooms D to F, and thus, it is the room closest to the sunrise. While sunlight could not have penetrated 82 Ibid., 83. 83 E.g., ibid., Pis. 17-21 84 Ibid., PI. 19. 85 Ibid., Pis. 11 and 14-15. 86 Ibid., PI. 22, 11. 20-21. 87 See ibid., 53, n. 78. 88 On the blending, or syncretism, of Nefertem and Re, evidently at work here, see, e.g., H. Bonnet, RARG, 509.</page><page sequence="59">1994 The Invocation Hymn at the Temple of Hibis 217 through to this room, as it could to the sanctuary (assuming there was one) of the structure above89, it follows from what has been noted to this point that the daily cult ritual was begun in this room at the time of sunrise. The bas of the god face east on both walls, as though poised to enter the divine statue. It is uncertain, however, what is meant by the fact that the invocation hymn is carved on the west wall of the room, since it would seem logical for it to be located on the east wall. It might have been "displaced" to the west wall because of the importance of the now almost entirely lost scene on the east wall, but this is an explanation of ignotum per ignotius. Perhaps it should be noted in this regard that in the more usual situation of the superstructure of a temple oriented towards the sunrise, the statue of the deity in the sanctuary faced the east, while the officiant, in addressing the deity, faced west. Further, though it is not clear what value this observation might have, it should be noted that the parallel at Hibis, as well as the similar material at Edfu, were carved on walls that, like the one in room F of the edifice of Taharqa, would have been seen by someone facing west. In any event, the statue(s) involved in these underground rites would have needed the sunlight in order to be imbued with the bas. What is preserved of the daily cult ritual in room F only tells us of the ritual to the point of the invocation to the god to awaken and the addresses to the bas. While it cannot be proved, it seems likely that the cult statue of the god was brought out of the underground chambers at this point, via the staircase, and that the remainder of the cult ritual, and any further rituals that might have been relevant to the occasion of the decade festival, were celebrated in the superstructure of the monument. 89 The edifice has a southeast orientation, i.e., towards the sunrise; see Edifice of Taharqa, PL 1.</page></plain_text>
