<plain_text><page sequence="1">Speaking with Difficulty: Feminism and Antiracism in Britain after 9\îî Pnyamvada Gopal A few years ago, an undergraduate came to see me about his final year dissertation. One of very few young British Asian men reading English at Cambridge University, he was immersed in our postcolo nial literature option, telling me how compelling and challenging this journey back to where his family "had come from" had been. But he now wanted to change his dissertation topic to write about the image of the railway platform in literature from India. Alarmed by the late timing of this change, I asked him why he no longer wanted to work on his chosen area of study, Muslim women's writing in North India during the nationalist movement. After some hesitation, he said that he hadn't yet been able to find what he had been looking for. He had conceived of his dissertation, he said, as a riposte to the discourse of Muslim women as oppressed and passive; he had hoped to write about how, for instance, many Muslim women choose to wear a headscarf or veil as a way of asserting agency. "I've been read ing a lot," he told me, "but I don't think I've found the right texts yet. Should I keep looking?" I told him that while he was unlikely to find the "headscarf" as such a salient concern in the writing of this period—although there were compelling engagements with issues of seclusion and veiling—he should persist with the reading and try to unravel the complexities of the ways in which Muslim women writ Femimst Studies 39, no. 1. © 2013 by Feminist Studies, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">Pnyamvada Gopal 99 ers in colonial India were grappling with gender, culture, commu nity, and nation. Interestingly, his idea about working on railway platforms had itself come from "Dilli ki Sair" (A Tour of Delhi), a short story by the socialist feminist doctor Rashid Jahan, which is about the travails of coming out of seclusion for a woman whose husband leaves her by herself at Delhi's railway station. Ensconced in her burqa as she keenly observes the unfamiliar world around her, she finds solace and protection inside it and refuses, in the final instance, to undertake the "tour of Delhi" that her benevolent spouse wishes to take her on. The story is very much about the ways in which a Muslim woman asserts her agency, paradoxically, through her refusal of male-spon sored emancipation in the form of coming out into public spaces. Yet the text is also curiously inhospitable to readings that would make a simple correlation between recuperating the veil and female agency. "Dilli ki Sair" ends not on a celebratory note but one of intractability. If male-sponsored emancipation is problematic, so too is the hostile gendering of public spaces; the burqa provides a tool with which to negotiate a specific space and its challenges, but it is by no means a definitive symbol of female choice or resistance. In a tranche of literary texts written by Muslim women in the first half of the twentieth century, from Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain's Padmarag and Sultana's Dream to works by Razia Sajjad Zaheer, Attia Hos sain, Ismat Chughtai, and the aforementioned Rashid Jahan, ques tions of agency have a complicated and changing bearing on the practice of everyday life.1 Although in "Dilli ki Sair," the protagonist chooses to wear her burqa and return to the space of the domestic in defiance of male authority, in some stories women speak of their anger at seclusion and confinement, and in others still, women emanci pated from the confines of the domestic critique the gendered politics of the public, not necessarily the sphere of freedom in and of itself. "Mera ek Safar" (A Journey), a later story by Rashid Jahan, calls on women not to be satisfied with emergence into the public sphere but to participate in reshaping its politics, not only of gender, but also of class, caste, and community.2 Women in these works make his tory in circumstances not of their own choosing but, in turn, reflex ively mold some of those circumstances. Agency is not limited within these texts to a voluntarist, sometimes strained "reading against the</page><page sequence="3">loo Priyamvada Go-pal grain" or "appropriation" of gendered cultural practices or markers of identity; it is often seen as part of an ongoing process of negotiation. Yet it is not hard to understand my student's impulse to write against a different grain; he is a young man from a minority religious and ethnic community, studying in a formally secular but nonethe less Anglican institution laden with the weight of Anglo-Saxon high culture that so heavily underpins constructions of "Britishness." He lives in early twenty-first-century Britain, where the hard-won gains of the antiracist struggles of the late twentieth century are being viti ated, not only by the crude polemics of the British National Party or the English Defence League but also by the brittleness of official or "town hall" multiculturalism that, in the language of globalized high finance, defines communities as "stakeholders" in the nation of Brit ain.3 Whether through the bile spread by resurgent racist groups or the apparently more thoughtful criticism of left-wing columnists such as Polly Toynbee and Nick Cohen, British Muslim communities — like those in other European countries and in the United States — have been under unprecedented scrutiny, as much for the violence undertaken by a few of their members, as for their alleged parochial ism, oppression of women, and religious literalism.4 Under this accu satory gaze, young British Muslim males are offered the straitjacket of a dyadic choice: are you a terrorist sympathizer/potential terror ist or will you demonstrate your loyalties to Britannia and work, per haps, for the intelligence services — diligently recruiting "the right kind" of young Muslim man from elite universities—to keep watch on British neighborhoods and communities? Finding a nuanced posi tion from which to speak outside and against these oppositions has become increasingly difficult, not least for those members of minor ity ethnic and religious communities who are concerned with issues of gender and sexuality. Since the 2001 attacks on New York's World Trade Center and the subsequent invasion of Afghanistan, British multiculturalism has been increasingly shaped by seemingly contradictory imperatives. On the one hand, as Arun Kundnani puts it: "The state has sought, increas ingly, to manage the rise in politicized religious identity through an updated version of the colonial-style strategies it had deployed in the name of multiculturalism since the 1980s—with the appointed</page><page sequence="4">Priyamvada Gopal ioi community leaders now being defined by 'faith' as well as by ethnic ity."5 A pantheon of "community leaders" and "representative orga nizations," wielding quite extraordinary influence and power, has become prominent in recent years. At the same time, traditional right-wing critics of cultural diversity "have found new allies from the centre and left of the political spectrum."6 The post-9/11 liberal "dilemma" is routinely posed as one of tolerating difference while yet maintaining the values of the (European) Enlightenment. While some commentators, such as Jonathan Freedland, argue that some cultural differences are irreconcilable—"Hard-headed liberalism means hard choices"—others advocate strategies by which minor ities can be brought into the mainstream of Britishness through a kind of managed assimilation. It is in this context that we must read the several iconic controversies around gender, culture, and identity that have emerged in Britain over recent years. Below, I discuss two such controversies in some detail and examine their ramifications for similar debates elsewhere. In February 2010, Gita Sahgal, head of the Gender Unit at Amnesty International's London offices, gave an interview to the Sunday Times in which she claimed that the human rights organization was undermin ing its own record as a champion of gender equality through a high profile partnership with a man she described as the "most famous supporter" of the Taliban in Britain and a self-professed adherent of orthodox and extreme Salafi Islam (derived from the Salaf—the earli est, "original" Muslims).7 She was referring to Moazzam Begg, who had been unlawfully detained until 2005 in the US military deten tion camps at Guantanamo Bay and who had, upon his release, set up Cage Prisoners, an organization that campaigns for the rights of Muslim prisoners detained in the name of the "War on Terror." In response to Sahgal's claims—which she had apparently raised inter nally before going public—Amnesty International countered that their association with Begg was based not on shared ideology but on their mutual advocacy of "detainees' rights to due process.. .within the same framework of universal human rights standards that we are promoting."8 Sahgal, who was suspended following the publication of the Sunday Times article, insisted that she was not questioning Begg's right to due process or freedom to express his views but, rather, the</page><page sequence="5">102 Priyamvada Copal official association of a human rights organization with an individual whose past affiliation with misogynist ideologies and "systematic dis crimination" undermined the necessary universality of the human rights framework.9 If Sahgal was backed by well-known figures such as the Egyp tian writer Nawal El Saadawi and the Pakistani campaigner Asma Jah angir, as well as organizations such as Women Living under Muslim Laws, Women against Fundamentalism, and the well-known British antiracist women's rights group the Southall Black Sisters, she was also criticized on the left for feeding into Islamophobia and illib eral opposition to multiculturalism and for smearing a Muslim man with stereotypical (and, it was argued, unfounded) charges of adher ence to misogynist ideologies.10 Her insistence on what she termed "human rights for all" was seen as somewhat tendentious; less univer sal than "an endorsement of Western liberalism as being a superior set of values which if necessary must be allowed to overrule the rights of others."11 There is certainly a debate to be had about Sahgal's deci sion to go public in a forum such as the Sunday Times, vastly more sus ceptible to kneejerk anti-Muslim attitudes among its readership than less right-wing broadsheets. It is also possible to query the degree to which Begg's adherence to a Salafist brand of Islam would necessarily entail a rejection of women's rights; certainly, Sahgal's suggestion that she herself felt "profoundly unsafe" when interacting with Begg was overplayed and gratuitous. And arguably, such gestures do indeed risk contributing to what Victoria Brittain calls "the current climate of intolerance and Islamophobia in Britain."12 However, the critiques of Sahgal's position that were swiftly issued by Brittain and others, such as the high-profile Muslim convert Yvonne Ridley, with similar claims to feminist and antiracist interests, in fact, raise broader and more vexing issues, not least the argument that any evocation of issues of misogyny or gendered oppression within besieged minority communities inevitably plays into the wrong hands.13 Rupal Oza, for instance, echoes other bloggers and online discussants when she argues that in the context of "virulent anti-Muslim events," Sah gal's claims inevitably fed into Islamophobia. Moreover, she insists, Sahgal and others exploit a problematic "authenticity" whereby some feminists are able to get away with anti-Muslim critiques because of their own "anti-imperialist political positions, Muslim ancestry, and</page><page sequence="6">Priyamvada Gopal 103 anticolonial pasts."14 The question of whether anticolonial or ethnic credentials can serve to mask or displace other ideological leanings and communal hostilities speaks, in part, to a necessary vigilance. It is, of course, perfectly possible to be racist in the name of feminism or misogynist while laying claim to antiracism. In a controversial recent essay in a special "sex issue" of Foreign Policy magazine, Mona Eltahawy, for instance, positions herself as a Muslim insider even as she deploys insidious "common sense" totalizing oppositions between Arab and Western, authoritarianism and liberalism, and repression and desire: "Name me an Arab country, and I'll recite a litany of abuses fueled by a toxic mix of culture and religion that few... disentangle lest they blaspheme or olfend."15 Reprising the familiar notion that Western liberalism respects individual expressions of desire (simplistically con flated with female agency) while Islamic societies repress it, Eltahawy's argument appears to be that no matter what they accomplish in terms of social or economic justice, the uprisings in the Arab world will mean little for women without the moderating influence of Western liberalism. What is elided in Eltahawy's piece and its "generic battle of the sexes spiced with a dose of Islam and culture," as Sherene Sei kaly and Maya Mikdashi point out, is the fact that many Arab women are already part of a feminist conversation, putting pressure on their national revolutions to become spaces "of gender equality and liber ation." 16 Similarly, Adele Wilde-Blavatsky's recent and controversial claim—"To be anti-racist is to be feminist: the hoodie and the hijab are not equals"—rather than exploring the intersections between racism and misogyny that were invoked in discussions of the murder of Iraqi-American, Shaima Alawadi,17 chooses to heap condemna tion on the hijab itself as uniquely oppressive, unfree (as opposed to, say, breast implants), and somehow responsible for inciting murder ous hatred.18 While Wilde-Blavatsky correctly points out that some Muslim women, too, have articulated critiques of the burqa and the hijab (not the same thing), what she denounces as "the tired main stream debate on anti-racism" functions as little more than a subter fuge for eliding the politics of race and reasserting instead the rele vance of a tired Western liberal-individualist feminism. But once we've left behind these invidious oppositions and the aggressive assertions of Eurocentrism in the sanctimonious guise of battling cultural relativism, it becomes necessary to ask whether</page><page sequence="7">io4 Priyamvada Gopal some critiques of forms of religiously oriented misogyny in minority communities, precisely when articulated by those with long antico lonialist and antiracist track records, do not also differ—while never theless fraught with danger—from those opportunist uses of fem inism made, for instance, by the Bush administration in justifying the invasion of Afghanistan. After all, the assertion of the rights of Afghan women is not made exclusively within a Western-identified paradigm: the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghani stan was able to insist on such rights while mounting a fierce critique of NATO and US militarism. While background and politics should not protect individuals from ideological critique, it is necessary for feminists to address the question that emerged during the Sahgal Amnesty affair: should an atmosphere saturated with Islamophobia act as a deterrent to a feminist critique of right-wing Islamism more generally! In this time and during this battle, should antiracism or anti anti-Islamism trump feminism? Such questions usually occasion a reprise of set-piece arguments about the tortured relationship of Western liberalism and an ostensi bly relativist multiculturalism with "woman" once again situated as the site and object of contestation. Debates take place around versions of the question posed by Susan Okin's well-known essay "Is Multicul turalism Bad for Women?": "What should be done when the claims of minority cultures or religions clash with the norm of gender equality that is at least formally endorsed by liberal states (however much they continue to violate it in their practices)?"19 One standard response calls for respect for minority sensibilities and to not arro gantly impose Western values and reasoning on non-Western com munities. This is the somewhat paternalist line taken by some such as Germaine Greer: "For people who don't have much else, self-esteem is crucial," she wrote, defending those denizens of the nonfictional London neighborhood Brick Lane who had protested the filming of Monica Ali's eponymous novel.20 The other response, as argued by Jonathan Freedland, is that multiculturalism brings liberalism to its limits and that both principles "while noble, keep colliding."21 Or as Jonathan Heawood, another white male commentator, argued in the wake of the Brick Lane controversy: "This cultural miscegenation may upset some middle-aged shopkeepers, but surely we'd all like to</page><page sequence="8">Priyamvada Gopal 105 see more skating in saris."22 (Such edgy mobility in Asian clothing presumably being possible only in Britain.) What though of women for whom such sartorial and kinetic innovations derive from a longer, more complex history of engaging both with their own communities and with other cultures in ways that are reducible neither to the bestowal of rights by liberal individ ualism nor to contorted "readings" of subaltern agency? When gender equality and the agency of women more broadly are deemed to be of Western provenance—albeit available for bestowal on, or appropri ation by, less advanced societies—the concomitant elision of other histories of resistance and self-assertion undermines the necessarily global provenance of gender equality and women's rights.23 Equally counterproductively, to assert Western proprietorship of this domain is to empower patriarchal forces within minority communities for whom this notion then becomes a handy currency for asserting their own difference. The tendency on all sides, then, is to regard "the West as the sole bearer of enlightened progress ... not as one partic ular expression of universal values, but as the only possible expres sion for all time."24 It is a cooptation of equality that has profound — and profoundly dangerous—implications for women and those who find themselves outside the sphere of consensus within minority communities. One consequence of the persistence of the operative binary between progressive West and regressive non-West is that the practice of antiracist feminism continues to pose real challenges; a constant nego tiation of dead ends and false oppositions erected by both the right and sections of the left, the latter often in stubborn reaction to the former, reprising what Frantz Fanon would have called the "tragic lie of the colonial situation" whereby the two sides "refuse to pay tribute" to the same value at the same moment in time.23 This poses particu lar difficulties for feminists who affiliate with British ethnic minor ity communities and who seek, within a longer tradition of women's resistance and activism, to effect change within them. The Sahgal Amnesty International debacle is just one prominent recent instance of the impasse of seeming irreconcilability in which antiracism, fem inism, and antiracist feminism find themselves in today. Even if one agrees with Sahgal on the necessity of upholding the universality of</page><page sequence="9">io6 Priyamvada Gopal gender equality, her critique of Begg certainly fell squarely into the waiting hands of the British right and self-proclaimed Eurocentric "muscular" liberals such as Nick Cohen and Christopher Hitchens, both of whom were quick to accuse the left of hypocrisy and double standards.26 A warranted fear of such misappropriation has undoubtedly acted as a deterrent to what used to be known as antiracist feminism. Whatever the merits or demerits of Sahgal's position vis-à-vis Begg specifically—whether she was, for instance, correct to insist that Begg's prior allegiances to the Taliban and stated commitment to a hardliner brand of Salafist Islam should be taken into account, a question on which it is not unreasonable to disagree—the contro versy spoke to an uncomfortable question that persists for antiracist feminists. That question, emphatically, is not either "Is multicultur alism bad for women:" or "Is feminism bad for multiculturalisme" but rather: "How do feminists speak and act in a conflictual context that is increasingly overdetermined by the global 'War on Terror' and the rise of specific kinds of bigotry?" In the wake of the controversy over Sahgal's remarks, the Southall Black Sisters, no slouches in the anti imperialism or antiracism departments, issued a statement argu ing that human rights violations both by states and nonstate actors should be treated on par: "We believe that Amnesty International's stance is being rightly questioned by organisations like ours who struggle to ensure that the debate on the War on Terror and religious fundamentalism is not reduced to the logic of 'either you are with us or you are against us.'"27 Is it still possible to enact a serious femi nist engagement with community, culture, and cultural practice in minority communities? Is it still legitimate, as the Southall Black Sis ters put it, to challenge "anti-democratic religious right forces in all religions"?28 With this question in mind, I now turn to another con troversial British cultural document and the quandary it generated, not for definitive answers but for intimations of alternatives. In December 2004, the Birmingham Repertory Theatre evacu ated the building and canceled its planned staging of Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti's play Behzti (Dishonor).29 A four hundred-strong crowd, claim ing to represent the injured sensibilities of the British Sikh commu nity, attempted to storm the building on December 20, damaged prop erty, and threatened further violence—including the playwright's</page><page sequence="10">Priyamvada Gcpal 107 death — during the play's opening night. The protest had been orga nized by the Council of Sikh Gurdwaras in Birmingham, although other organizations, including the Sikh Secretariat and the Sikh Fed eration, also jockeyed for visibility. Tellingly, the protests and subse quent closure of the play was backed by religious leaders from other faith communities and their leaders, including the Bishop of Bir mingham. The Sikh Human Rights Group, apparently inverting colonial discourse, called on "the arts and media establishment [to] become a little more civilized," claiming that it was possible "to be contentious and critical without being offensive."30 At the heart of the apparent offense to sensibilities was the depiction of a rape that takes place in an office within a gurdwara—a Sikh temple—as well as references to the bisexual proclivities of a male community leader. The play had not won points among the champions of so-called Sikh human rights for its suggestion that people, and women in particu lar, were vulnerable to abuse under the aegis of community. The pro test also became part of a familiar opposition, firmly in place since the furor surrounding Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses in 1984, of the opposition between "free speech" and "respect for minorities," which maps neatly on to the discursive dyad between Western liberalism and non-Western autarchy. A disclaimer is necessary here: Behzti is unlikely to feature on any list of great British plays. Moreover, in the context of what Gurharpal Singh has described as the voyeuristic mainstream "penchant for tit illating tales" of ethnic minority life, it is necessary to exercise critical caution toward a less-than-outstanding work that exposes black and Asian communities to this gaze, whether politely relativist or cen soriously Eurocentric.31 Behzti, it should be made clear, suffers from uneven style, inconsistent switching of registers, and at the end, a cramming together of events that would startle even a hard-core afi cionado of Bombay's action films and family melodramas, long used to suspending disbelief. In the last few scenes alone, we are given a confession to a homosexual love affair between married men, a rape, grievous assault, and a probable murder. This is in addition to the two suicides we already know about. Nevertheless, Behzti is interesting and, at times, compelling as drama. Although it emerges as an account of profound and painful rifts within a Sikh community, it is also the story of a difficult and yet intimate relationship between a mother</page><page sequence="11">io8 Priyamvada Gopal and daughter: Balbir, a cantankerous and incontinent widow, con fined to her wheelchair, and her daughter Min, or Maninder, who is in her late thirties and described by her mother as a "fat virgin become infertile." They have fallen on hard times after the death of Min's father and now live in a public housing high-rise in inner city Birmingham rather than in the suburbs where the Sikh community largely resides. Balbir's part-time caregiver, provided by the National Health Service, is Elvis, a young black man in love with Min, who, it turns out, privately returns the affection. Balbir, an avowed beef eating atheist, on the other hand, evinces a racist distrust of him (a reminder of the persistence of the chromatic hierarchies of British Asian racism). When the curtain rises, all three are making preparations for a visit to the gurdwara, the temple, the two women for the first time in years and for Elvis, the first time ever. A guilt-stricken Balbir hopes to persuade the manager, Mr. Sandhu, to arrange a match for Min, whose life, she worries, is being wasted on her care. At the gurdwara, a series of encounters—awkward, funny, and emotionally difficult— with Balbir's alienated women friends takes place. When Min finally meets Mr. Sandhu in his office, he confesses that many years ago he had had a relationship with her father who, fearing discovery, had committed suicide. Mr. Sandhu then — somewhat inexplicably, it would seem, at first glance—sexually assaults her. We learn that he is a depressive with a long history of sexually abusing vulnerable young people who come to him, both women and men. When Balbir finds out, she takes—it is suggested—a bloody revenge using a kirpan, or Sikh dagger, one of five emblems of the faith. The representatives of the Sikh community who had been invited to preview the play claimed that they directed their criticism not at its undoubtedly contentious subject matter, but at the fact that a rape is shown taking place in a sacred space, the gurdwara. In fact, the sexual assault — only the beginning of which is actually staged — takes place in an office setting rather than in the sanctum sanctorum. The distinction between sacrilege and criticism drawn by these self appointed representatives, combined with the assertion that Sikhs "do not mind criticism of their religion or exposure of hypocrisy," needs to be read within an ongoing and largely successful effort by many Muslims, Hindus, and Sikhs in Britain to unhook themselves</page><page sequence="12">Pnyamvada Gopal 109 from the secular umbrella category of "British Asian."32 Hindus and Sikhs also like to claim that both their work ethic and their general peacefulness distinguish them from Muslims. At the same time, it is argued, Hindus and Sikhs must also have the right that Muslims apparently already have—to protest the overstepping of the bound aries of the sacred. Aware that such claims are liable to the charge that Sikhism itself came into being as a dissident, critical, and rational ist break from mainstream Hinduism's exclusions and hierarchies as well as Islamic proselytization, Jasdev Singh Rai of the Sikh Human Rights Group argues that the problem with the play is not its critique of community but "the deliberate, sensational and offensive use of religious icons." Some aspects of religion have to be kept sacrosanct and beyond the reach of reason and criticism, he writes, invoking, not without effect, Derrida and Foucault on "the subjectivity of ratio nalism" and "the limits of language" to support his case. The sacred, for Rai, is determined by structural equivalences between different kinds of icons: Mohammed for Muslims, the cow for Hindus, the body of Christ for Christians, and the Guru Granth Sahib for Sikhs — along with the gurdwara where it resides. Finally, community itself is mapped onto this notion of the sacred, explicated as "those whose hopes and culture are orientated around the subjective inscrutability of sacred icons."33 How has "community" come to take on this seemingly ineluc table association with faith in ways that render both so thoroughly intransigent? Through the late 1990s into the new millennium, under the aegis of then-Prime Minister Tony Blair, the folding of "faith" into "community" to create "faith-based community" as inalienable terms, constitutive of each other, has evinced the logic of capital. A series of terms have been folded into each other such that commu nities emerge as fully fledged, anthropomorphic subjects possessed of a single sensibility underpinned by a set of determinate beliefs and spokespeople. They are constituted by faith, itself irreducible, and each possessed of a singular sensibility. As a consequence of this irre ducibility, some things have to be treated as sacred (i.e., beyond lan guage and discursive engagement), and therefore, in circular fash ion, community constitutively exceeds analysis. Ironically, in this figuring of community as always already subaltern, what gets writ ten out are precisely the small voices, the fractures, the margins, and</page><page sequence="13">no Pnyamvada Gopal the contestations. As the community emerges as both person and icon, it puts itself beyond reformulation, reconstitution, and revision, although as an entity, it can enter into civil and political transactions. It is this standoff between community, figured as a powerful icon—"setting up holy texts, rendering debate impertinent, mobi lizing group anger against reprobates"—and its actual multiple frac tured constituents, that Behzti dramatizes.34 In a move that will be familiar to students of subcontinental heterodoxies and vernacular spiritual movements, rather than surrendering or attacking the reli gious ground, Behzti insistently reclaims it in the name of the shifting and heterodox margins of community. The text repeatedly invokes passages and aphorisms from the Guru Granth Sahib, the religious text of Sikhism, itself a collection of discourses by Sikh gurus. Maninder, her mother, and even Elvis appear to long for the comfort of devo tional ritual and worship: "I love it. I love all that... hmmmm ... it's getting me all going." Maninder murmurs joyfully.35 The longing for an unmediated relationship with the spiritual underpins insurgent faiths—"I'm going to wish Guru Nanak a happy birthday and that's all"—in which community comprises horizontal relationships of reciprocity rather than hierarchy. Bhatti's foreword, published before the play was staged, begins with an invocation of Sikh religiosity as an absolute: "Truth is every thing in Sikhism, the truth of action, the truth of an individual, God's truth."36 It is a truth she claims and deploys against "the mythology of the Sikh diaspora... breeding affluence through hard work and aspiration," in the process writing out "those who are not beacons of multiculturalism, who live with fear and without hope and who thrive through their own versions of anti-social behaviour."37 (In the British context, this is a pointed reference to Anti Social Behav iour Orders, which provide for a range of behaviors—from begging and loitering to drunkenness and playing loud music—to be named, shamed, and brought under the purview of the justice system). The narrative of the Sikh community as an egalitarian refuge for the weak is invoked against the official narrative of the community as affluent and powerful, where "those who err from the norm are condemned and marginalized, regardless of right or wrong, so that the com munity will survive."38 Although it invokes dissident truth-telling as fundamental to Sikhism and therefore as legitimate grounds for</page><page sequence="14">Priyamvada Gopal in critiquing a community, much of the play's power derives not from its climactic violence but from what it says—through the sadness and loss that mark the lives of the characters, including the perpetrator, Mr. Sandhu—about the community's power to quietly marginalize, neglect, and cover up. Communities can fail their members in the name of preserv ing their identity and wholeness, but communitas—the spirit of com munity—remains an aspiration honored in the egalitarian Sikh idea of sern, or service: "Like when you wash up and clean in here, you're doing it for everyone."39 When Balbir encounters her former, younger cronies at the gurdwara, they are shocked to see her in a wheelchair and abashed at not having been in touch: Teetee: (Uneasy) Bhanji, you know we are thinking about you and remembering you every day of our lives. Balbir: Sisters... you do not have to explain. Polly: (Sad) But always God is keeping us so damn well busy. Balbir: You do not have to explain! Teetee: I am pushing the tea trolley around the hospital. Polly: I am packaging the airport food. Teetee: And then God calls us here. Polly: To do his never-ending work.40 If capital has interrupted the narrative of community, it is also the case that community, facing the pressures of migration and the glo balization of cheap labor, has reduced itself to the lowest common denominator, to marriages and other festive occasions "with all the relevant traditions in place," in the character Teetee's words. Even openness and inclusivity as a Sikh spiritual value has ossified into what Mr. Sandhu asserts is an appropriately "integrationalist attitude... in brackets, for example, going down to the pub" to distinguish them selves from other immigrant (read "Muslim") communities.41 As some scholars have noted, the communalized religious-identity politics that underpins (rather than conflicts with) liberal multiculturalism</page><page sequence="15">in Priyamvada Gopal in Britain elides a far richer and more cosmopolitan actual history of Asian communities in Britain; including self-consciously secu lar and shared battles for labor rights and economic justice, Asian women's organizing and campaigns for civic standing, legal rights, immigration rights, fair policing, and criminal justice. It is this his torical amnesia that accounts for the fact that those who had orga nized so energetically against Bhatti's "insult" to the Sikh commu nity in speaking about rape and sexual abuse were largely silent just six months later when Gate Gourmet workers—overwhelmingly Asian (95 percent), and specifically Sikh (75 percent), women—who prepare in-flight meals for British Airways took collective action in the summer of 2005 and again in early 2006 against unfair labor prac tices that included mass sackings—a practice that arguably consti tutes gross insult to person and to community. Although the support of local gurdwaras was manifest in the form of food and drink for picketing workers, the normally outspoken community leaders were not as vocally supportive in relation to actions against poor wages and conditions, privatization, and casualization.42 Within the impov erished conceptions of cultural identity that now afflict the politics of multiculturalism, external markers—the hijab, beards, hindis (fore head decoration)—replace the humane egalitarianism of communitas: "Faith transformed into public display and exhibition, the latter sub stituting for a genuine consideration of the ethics and morality about how different Asians are to live with, rather than against each other."43 Behzti is also a profoundly literary project, speaking of the shifting complexities and paradoxes of existence and interaction within both families and communities; "all that is anonymous and quiet, raging, despairing, human, inhumane, absurd, and comical."44 It is this liter ary and feminist sense of the messiness and tensions of lived existence within minority communities that gets elided and flattened in making the case for absolute difference or for a parochial and paternalist uni versalism. In calling for empathy-in-difference to be restored to our understanding of community, in recognizing the overlap between Sikh chants and black Christian spirituals, the play states the case for recognizing human commonalities across communities and accept ing difference within communities. In emphasizing the ways in which language, food, music, clothing, faith, rituals, and indeed, institutions matter, it suggests that both empathy and commonality are necessarily</page><page sequence="16">Pnyamvada Go-pal 113 articulated through the particulars of cultural practice. But each must necessarily and usefully transform the other. As I suggested earlier, embedded within Indian feminisms are various histories of reflexive engagement not just with cultural prac tice or the practice of culture, but with culture as practice. The latter figuration points to positions beyond the false oppositions of liber alism and authoritarianism, or communitarianism and selfhood. When culture is conceptualized in terms of relations between selves or between selves and society, which carry within them the recur rent possibility of negotiation and transformation, it becomes possi ble to imagine change without ceding the terrain of belonging and shared history. Behzti belongs to those traditions insofar as it is preoc cupied with the ways in which both desires and relationships are in a process of continuous evolution, leaving open spaces of interroga tion and change. Faith, in Behzti, takes the form precisely of the quest for human(e) connection—both Min and Balbir come to the gurd wara profoundly aware of their loneliness and seeking spiritual solace, human interaction, and the possibility that things will not always be as they are. The other characters too are marked by their sense of loss, including the abusive and powerful head of the gurdwara, Mr. Sandhu, who mourns his dead male lover, Min's father: "I wanted to be a man, not a son or a brother or a husband Whatever things look like, there is always another story."45 From the giant, or priest— in this case a reluctant spiritual guide struggling with his own drug addled brain — comes sudden words of insight via the holy book the Guru Granth Sahib and an event that is iconic of black Britain: Flave you ever been to the Notting Hill Carnival?... If you don't get stuck behind a float and manage to avoid the knife-wielding girl gangs and ladies with sequined bikini bottoms, it is possible to find the spirit of the Guru's unique illumination. ... MIN and ELVIS look mystified. GIANIJASWANT takes a paratha lying on the side and munches on it. In the company of saints and holy people No more is there a feeling of "us" and "them" No one an enemy, none a stranger</page><page sequence="17">ii4 Priyamvada Gopal I get along with all.46 A footnote tells us that these are Guru Arjan's words from the holy Guru Granth Sahib47 As a lens to make visible its constitutive heterogeneity and dyna mism, feminism is not incompatible with either antiracism or minor ity cultural practice but constitutive of them. As such, it is a vitally regenerative means of rescuing both from the arid minimalism of certain kinds of identity politics and the assault they face from a parochial liberalism masquerading as the only acceptable source of universal values. Insofar as it calls upon both self and community to undertake critique and to acknowledge the complex texture of human existence, it cannot make "community" sacrosanct even as it draws on and contributes to its resources. While leaving open a space for faith and for religiosity as human activities, feminism cannot and should not allow these to become the sole determinant of community. Fem inist critique cannot be withheld or modulated in an atmosphere of racism or majoritarianism; at the same time, majority communities have to also be held accountable to the ethos of transformation and reciprocity. This understanding of antiracist feminism is akin to and compatible with the critical humanism to which the late Edward Said underscored his affiliation in his last years, rejecting the claim that humanism was simply and only "totalizing and essentializing" and asserting that it is possible to "fashion a different kind of human ism ... schooled in its abuses by the experience of Eurocentrism and empire," such that it is possible, and one might argue, necessary, to be "critical of humanism in the name of humanism."48 Said's view of cul ture is shared, I think, by that strand of Indian feminism that I evoked at the beginning of this essay. Both right-wing votaries of the clash of civilizations as well as more progressively inclined critics of human ism miss out, Said argues, on what has long been characteristic of all cultures, namely "that there is a strong streak of radical antiauthori tarian dissent in them."49 To suppress that dissent in the name of fighting imperialism is reactive, dangerous, and ironically, itself a position deriving from the crude typologies of colonialism. Monolithic forms of cultural asser tion are as much products of colonialism as a style of resistance to it, mirroring rather than countering the monocultural separatisms that it put in play. Political representation on the terrain of liberal</page><page sequence="18">Priyamvada Gopal 115 multiculturalism in Britain insists on the production of singular cul tural identities, whereas, in fact, we need to find a way to bring the heterodox back into cultural and democratic practice. The debate has become so polarized that the left itself is in danger of abdicat ing the terrain of reflexivity and of rehearsing a form of paternal ism that reinforces the notion that only the West can survive change, innovation, modernity, self-criticism, and reinvention, while minor ity groups—led by self-appointed patriarchal caricatures—seem to be acquiescing in this notion, suggesting that they "must adhere to known cultural patterns" or "uncritically codified certainties."50 The well-known Muslim commentator Ziauddin Sardar speaks elo quently of the need for Muslims themselves to "confront the rhetoric of puritanism that dominates the British Muslim community."51 Yet this project of demonstrating "the perversion of puritanism" neces sitates conditions where it is possible to discuss openly "the humane message of Islam without being overshadowed, misunderstood, mis represented or doubted."52 The absence of these conditions is, Sardar correctly insists, "a failure of Britain as much as of British Muslims."53 It is a similar tradition of heterodoxy in culture—and religion — invoked in Behzti by its attempt to rethink Sikh community and iden tity in the crucible of the globalized "War on Terror" and in a deeply vitiated welfare state. Similar traditions, as Amitav Ghosh reminds us, have also "always formed the hidden and subversive counter-image of the orthodox religions of the Middle East."54 Such recuperations are important not only in the context of power relations within commu nities but also in relation to the entrenched notion that debate, dis sent, and scrutiny are inherently Western traditions; indeed, there can be no greater Eurocentrism than to concede the ground of reason, critique, and self-transformation to the West. Feminists and antira cists must continue to insist on speaking from a place of difficulty even when the dominant rhetoric is that of siege and defense as much on the left as on the right. We abdicate this task at our peril.</page><page sequence="19">ii6 Priyamvada Gopal Notes I would like to thank Kavita Daiya, Ania Loomba, Ritty Lukose, Dan Mosh enburg, Simona Sawhney, Timothy Brennan, and Keya Ganguly for invit ing me to present versions of this essay at their institutions, as well as audi ences at the University of California-Berkeley, the University of Pennsylvania, George Mason University, the University of Minnesota, and the University of Cambridge for useful critical feedback.

In March 2012, an Iraqi-American woman, Shaima Alawadi, was found beaten to death in her home; it was reported that her daughter had found a racist note near the body suggesting that she had been killed for being a Muslim. Since Alawadi's death took place shortly after a young Afri can American man, Trayvon Martin, had been shot to death by a white vigilante, some commentators suggested that there was a connection: the latter killed for wearing a hooded sweater and Alawadi for wearing a headscarf.
