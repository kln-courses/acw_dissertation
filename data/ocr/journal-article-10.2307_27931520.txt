<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Sa?pem Tomb The Scarabs By Peter M. Fischer and Othmar Keel Introduction The village of Sahem is situated in northern Jordan. It lies 22 km north-west of Irbid and 5.5 km south of the Yarm?k River and the Syrian border, overlooking Lake Tiberias and the south-eastern Golan Heights (see Fig. 1). The coordinates of the centre of the village are approx. 233.500 north and 223.000 east according to the Palestine Grid Coordinate System (see map No. 3155.11 NW). The village covers an area of 31 km2. Sahem has approximately 8.000 inhabitants. Sabem is in an agricultural area with a number of natural springs. There are ancient remains in the Sahem area at fjfirbet el-Hosn, ed-D?r, fjfirbet el-'Esse and S?n?be which point to an expansive occupation during over what was obviously a long period (none of the sites has been properly investigated). These names are transcriptions of the names used by the local population, which it has been impossible to confirm from published sources. In June 1992, during the construction of an elementary school for girls east of the main road in the southern part of the village, a tomb was exposed when a caterpillar caused its roof to collapse. The building activities were suspended by the local police, and rescue excavation started on 25 June and lasted until 15 July 1992 under the supervision of I.A. Melhem from the Irbid Department of Antiquities. H. Ta'?n?, former curator of the Irbid Archaeological Museum, assisted in the processing of the material. He has been a member of the Swedish Jordan Expedition's team since 1989. The Swedish Jordan Expedition, directed by the co author P. M. Fischer from the University of G?teborg, has been excavating regularly at Tell Abii fjaraz in the northern Jordan Valley since that year1. The material from the Sahem Tomb is in many respects related to finds from Tell Ab? fjaraz. Thanks to the generosity of S. Tell, former Director General of the Department of Antiquities, the tomb material was offered to Fischer in order to ensure publication2. The tomb gifts include 78 ceramic vessels: eleven bowls, four chalices, two kraters, two amphoriskoi, fourteen jugs, four juglets, five pilgrim flasks, twenty-one alabastra, and fifteen lamps. Other objects are six beads, seven buttons, and one female stone figurine, and three clay figurines (two females and one bull). Metal objects include eleven of copper alloy (daggers, knives and arrowheads, and a bowl), and one earring of gold, together with many corroded objects of mainly silver and copper alloy which can possibly be restored and preserved. The hoard also includes four scarabs, one of them with a gold setting mounted on a bronze ring, and one gold setting without a scarab. 1 Fischer 1991, 67-104; 1992a, 84-90; 1992b, 42-47; 1993a, 477f.; 1993b, 279-305; 1994a, 127-145; 1994b, 534-537. 2 A catalogue of the entire tomb material is forthcoming in ADPV; special studies of the different find groups by Fischer in preparation.

Fischer and Othmar Keel The Tomb The area of excavation, measuring 7.5 m x 7.5 m, was divided into four squares of equal size and labelled A-D from south-west to south-east (Fig. 2). The L-shaped tomb covers an area of ca. 34.5 m2 and was cut into quite soft rock. It is very probable that the tomb was entered from the south. The south-west part of the tomb in Square A, ca. 4 m x 4 m in area, was separated from the remainder of the tomb by a partly destroyed wall built of flint stones. The wall is about 2.4 m long, leaving a 0.6 m wide entrance to the north part of the tomb. The wall no doubt served as a support for the roof. A semi-circular pit cut in the rock was found in Square B. This semi-circle was broken by another cut about 0.2 m deeper to the north. Hundreds of flint flakes were discovered in the east part of Square and in C. The burials (in Squares and C) were covered by blocks of stone, approximately 0.2-0.3 m large and very likely belonging to the collapsed roof. A 0.4-0.7 m thick layer of red soil mixed with small stones was found covering the entire tomb below the layer of flint deposits. The only scanty skeletal remains were located in Square C. The scattered bones had almost disintegrated. It was therefore not possible to estimate the number of individuals or to make any osteological investigations other than a rough estimation of some of the individuals' ages from the degree of the attrition of some molars. Two bone samples were sent to the Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, Oxford, for 14-C analysis. The samples were found to contain insufficient collagen to be dated (R. A. Housley, Senior Archaeologist at the Research Laboratory for Archaeology and the History of Art, Oxford University). Given that bones from warmer parts of the world frequently lost most of their protein, the fact that neither of them had enough collagen is not very unusual or surprising. The objects from Square A were discovered directly on bedrock, whereas the tomb goods from and C were found intermingled with red soil and stones. The majority of the tomb-goods including the scarabs, metal weapons, jewelry and figurines come from and C. The Scarabs The numbers refer to the Irbid Museum registration numbers. The dimensions are given in cms. 4658 (Fig. 3 a; Pis. 11 . ). Scarab with gold setting, mounted on bronze ring with silver wire A. Materials and dimensions Scarab: frit (Egyptian Blue); length 2.1, width 1.5, height 0.9 (all drawings are 2:1). Setting: gold alloy; length 2.4; width 1.8; height 0.5. Wire: silver alloy; diameter ca. 0.1. Ring: bronze; max. outer diameter 3.0, max. thickness 0.4; measures taken before restora tion. The ring with gold-mounted scarabs is usually also made of gold. It happens, however, that the two components are made of different materials3. Thus, the ring of a Middle Bronze 3 See the silver ring from Tell el-'Aggul in Rowe 1936, 35, Nr. 135. The identification of the materials by Rowe is not correct. Cf. the colour photograph in Ziffer 1990, 74, Fig. 81 ; the silver ring from ZDPV111 (1995)2</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 1. The localization of Sakem. ZDPV 1 (1995)2</page><page sequence="4">138 Peter M. Fischer and Othmar Keel Age scarab with a gold-mount from Tell el-Agg?l is of silver. More common are different metals for the different elements in the Late Bronze Age: A scarab from Beth Shemesh has a mount of gold and a ring of silver, the other scarabs from the southern Tell el-F?r'a have gold mounts and bronze rings. B. Iconography The base shows on a vertical axis two antithetical-standing anthropomorphic figures. Since the soft material is very worn they are not easily recognizable. Nevertheless, the figure on the left can be identified with a reasonable degree of certainty as Pharaoh wearing the blue crown with uraeus. His "left" carries the /^'-scepter, his "right" is lowered. He is dressed in a combination of a short skirt with stiff projecting trapezoidal front and a long overskirt. More difficult to identify than the figure to the left is the one to the right. The head seems to be that of an animal, probably an ibis with its very long sickle-shaped bill. The ibis-headed anthropomorphic figure is one of the forms of Thot, the inventor of hieroglyphs and writing and the patron of the scribal profession. On his head is the lunar crescent and disc4. Thot is related to the moon as the god of the calendar and time-reckoning. He holds notched palm ribs (rnp.t) symbolizing many years of rule. The scene is known from monumental art as part of the coronation ceremonies5. Sometimes the ideogramm for Sed-festival (hb-sd) is hang ing from the extremity of the palm-rib6. This may have been the case on the Sahem scarab, but the surface is too worn to be sure. A very close parallel to the Sahem scarab can be seen on an oval plaque engraved on both sides, which comes from the ex-collection of F. S. Matouk, now at the Biblical Institute of the University of Fribourg (Figs. 3b.c)7. Instead of holding the /?g,'-sceptre the Pharaoh is grasping the palm-ribs with his "left" hand. Above the palm-ribs is the sun disc with two uraei (Fig. 3 b). The other side of the plaque shows the Pharaoh in exactly the same attitude as on the Sahem scarab but facing this time instead of Thot a cartouche with the prenomen of Ramses II wsr-ml't-r' and the stereotype epithet stp-n-r( (Fig. 3 c). Although oval plaques are typical for the 18th Dynasty this one belongs doubtless to the reign of Ramses II. Scenes from the coronation ritual on scarabs are extremely rare. They almost exclusively occur on items from the time of Thutmosis III and Ramses II8. The Sahem scarab most probably belongs to the reign of the latter. 4659 (Fig. 4a; Pis. 12 A.B). Scarab A.

Fischer and Othmar Keel The pronotum and the elytra (wing-cases) of this scarab show deep depressions which were once filled with pigment (paste, frit or glass), now missing9. Petrie excavated a scarab with the same characteristics on Tell el-Agg?l (Fig. 4 b)10. The lunate head of the type Al and the side type e6 are both typical for scarabs of the 12th or early 13th Dynasty11. The decoration of the base is not against this dating12. Macalister found another example of this group of scarabs at Gezer (Fig. 4c)13. As well, both the "hour-glass" head B2 and the side type e9 are typical for the 12th Dynasty (cf. note 11). The same is true of the sml-tl.wj, the sign of union between the two Lands, on the base14. A scarab of the same bone-coloured composition and with almost the same dimensions (1.9 x 1.4 x 0.9 cm) as the Sahem scarab is in the Matouk collection, now at the Biblical Institute of the University of Fribourg (M. 4444 = Fig. 4d)15. The head is of type D5, the side of e6 (cf. note 11). These characteristics, as well as the symmetric design on the base, fit perfectly well into the second part of the 12th or the early 13th Dynasty. A very summarily published scarab from Tel N?g?l? (Tell en-Nag?le) in the northern Negev (Fig. 4 e)16 has as the one from Gezer a B2 type head. The side is - as the one of the two following examples - unfortunately unpublished. Neither dimensions nor material are indicated. The ibex or goat (capridae) on the base is drawn in broad outline only. Capridae are already found in the Montet Jar at the beginning of the 12th Dynasty17. The rather coarse drawing suggests a not too early date, but probably still in the 13th Dynasty. A scarab in the University College, London (Fig. 4f)18, belongs certainly to the same group as the scarabs of Figs. 4b-e. Since one-third of the back is missing, the type of the head is not clearly identifiable and the side is not published. The dimensions of the base (1.85 x 0.9 cm), however, and its decoration fit very well the group of scarabs represented by the items of Figs. 4a-d. In a New York auction catalogue of 1991, there is an additional piece with the charac teristic recesses (Fig. 4g)19. Its head (B2, see note 11) and the symmetrical arrangement of hieroglyphs on the base indicate a date in the 13th Dynasty. The depression in the pronotum is larger than in the five above mentioned examples from Sahem, Tell el-'Aggul, Tell Gezer (Tel Gezer), the Tel N?g?l?, and the Matouk and the University College collections. 9 For the technique of fillings in relief-art cf. Wildung 1982; an unpublished Middle Bronze Age scarab in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge (Inventory Nr. E 452. 1939) has preserved the filling; the round element in the pronotum is red, the ones of the elytra are blue. 10 Petrie 1934, Pl. VII, 193 (drawing), Pl.

The Scarabs 141 The larger depressions also occur on a scarab in the Matouk collection (M. 4375 = Fig. 4h)20. In contrast to the previously mentioned examples, this one has preserved its filling of dark blue glass. The head of the beetle is replaced by a now very worn human head. This type of human-headed scarabs started in the 13th or at the latest in the 15th Dynasty21 and is again to be found in the 19th Dynasty, particularly during the reign of Ramses II22. They differ from the otherwise similar scarabs of the 15th Dynasty by the rich decoration of their back. In this respect M. 4375 = Fig. 4h is close to the 15th Dynasty examples. The problem is the base. The gods (Amun, Ptah, Thot as cynocephalus ape etc.) and the way they are rep resented do not occur before the 19th Dynasty and the organisation into three registers is typical of Phoenician scarabs and scaraboids of the 9th and 8th centuries23. Consequently, this scarab has probably to be considered as an archaising product of Phoenician provenance. The Sahem scarab, instead, is certainly a product of the Middle Bronze Age, probably of the late 12th or early 13th Dynasty. The head type A4 and the side type e9 (cf. note 11) point to this date. Rope borders are "confined to the years ca. 1900-1800 B.C."24, but the framing motif on this scarab should be classified rather with Tufnells "barred" strand, a device found until the end of the Middle Bronze Age. B. Iconography On the base, a series of hieroglyphs are engraved: from top to bottom, the symbol of life ('??), the scarab (feprr) and the collar of beads nb.w "gold" flanked by symmetrically arranged sw.t "rush"-signs on w^-signs and two symbols of life25. 4660 (Fig. 5a; Pis. 12 CD). Scarab with broken silver wire in one end A. Materials and dimensions Scarab: composition, yellowish-white (bone-coloured), reddish-brown glaze well pre served in all depressions; length 1.6, width 1.1, height 0.7. Wire: silver alloy; diameter ca. 0.1. The shape of the scarab agrees well with an early 18th Dynasty date (ca. 1550-1400 B. C.), established mainly by the decoration of the scarab. The rounded head, the well proportioned pronotum and elytra and the clearly shown legs of the beetle are all typical of the early 18th Dynasty. B. Iconography The falcon with outspread wings and outspread claws was quite a popular motif in the Levant during the Middle Bronze Age (for example, in Byblos). However, the wings of the falcon were not as much recurved and in an almost vertical position as on the Sahem scarab, but rather in a more horizontal one26. Very much recurved and elevated above their heads are 20 The base is published in Matouk 1977, 373 Nr. 32. The scarab is made of steatite; the dimensions are 1.7 x 1.3 x 0.8 cm. 21 Tufnell 1984,1 33, Pl. LXII, 3460 and Pl.

ZDPV111 (1995)2</page><page sequence="8">142 Peter M. Fischer and Othmar Keel the wings on the falcons of three golden falcon-earrings from Tell el-Aggul27. Negbi dates them to the very beginning of the 18th Dynasty, between 1550 and 1480 B.C.28. The recurving of the wings may in this case be due to the formal needs of an earring. Still, the same recurving can be found with falcons flying full face on scarabs of the early 18th Dynasty, for example, on one with the prenomen of Thutmosis I ('l-lgpr-ki-r' = Fig. 5 b)29. Each one of the outstretched claws of the falcon holds a bound prisoner and beneath the falcon is a nb-s'ign. On a scarab from the foundation deposits of Hatshepsut's temple at D?r el-Bahri, the body and the head of the falcon are replaced by a cartouche with the prenomen of the queen, m&gt;(t-k;-r00. The nb is replaced by the collar of beads nb.w "gold". Another scarab with the falcon above a collar of beads which ends in falcon-heads was found in Koptos31. The catouche with the prenomen of Thutmosis III mn-Jgpr-r* forms the body of the falcon on two scarabs in the British Museum and on one in the Louvre32. The three scarabs are contemporaneous with the king whose prenomen they carry33. A falcon with outspread wings and claws and a cartouche of Thutmosis III above its head is shown on a scarab auctioned by Sotheby's in 199334. In the same lot was a scarab with decoration very similar to the one on the Sahem scarab. The falcon is holding a sw^-cartouche in each of his claws and a w?-sign is beneath it. Only the hprr "scarab" between the outspread wings is absent from the Sahem scarab35. From an iconographical viewpoint, the most exact parallel to the Sahem scarab was found at the other end of the sphere of Egyptian influence, in an early New Kingdom cemetery in Sudanese An?ba36. A still simpler version than the one from Sahem is to be seen on two scarabs in the Cairo Museum where even the nb-sign is missing37. Newberry assigns both these scarabs to the early 18th Dynasty38. For other reasons, this dating has been confirmed by two scarabs with exactly the same motif found in an early 18th Dynasty context in Sudanese Fadrus39. The falcon with outspread wings and claws was a representation of the allembracing domination of the sky-god Horus. On earth, his reign was present in and through the king whose name in the cartouche replaces the body of the falcon on many examples. The motif is very typical for the early 18th Dynasty, which corresponds more or less to the Late Bronze Age I and II A (ca. 1550-1300 B.C.). Outstanding examples of the motif were found in the form of pendants and collars in the tomb of Tutankhamon40. It does not seem that the motif outlasted the 18th Dynasty, at least not on a significant scale. As with other motifs of the 18th Dynasty, for example the king in the sun-boat41, it became popular again in the glyptic of the 9th and 8th centuries in the Levant42. The motif survived into the Persian period43. 27 Petrie/Mackay/Murray 1952, 9 and Pl. 6. 28 Negbi 1970,25-36. 29 Newberry 1907 a, PI. 6,100 = Hayes 1959, Fig. 41 in the centre. 30 Hayes 1959, 87 Fig. 48 second row from above, fourth scarab from the left. 31 Petrie 1896, PI. 25, 77. 32 Hall 1913, No. 813-814; Newberry 1906, PL 28, 17. 33 Jaeger 1982, 41 ?72. 149 ??1115f. 34 Sotheby's 1993, 128 Lot 328. 35 The scarab above the falcon can also be seen on another scarab (cf.

Scarab Material and dimensions Carnelian; length 1.1, width 0.9, height 0.6. Scarabs of carnelian are very rare in Palestine before the 19th Dynasty. Five examples, all of them plain, were found in Middle Bronze Age tombs in Jericho44, in Beth Shean45, and in Lachish46. The squarish shape and the very schematic engraving of the elytra and the pronotum on Sahem 4661 are typical of the 19th Dynasty when carnelian became popular, both for unengraved and engraved scarabs. However, from the two sites of southern Tell el Fdr'a and from Megiddo six examples of unengraved carnelian scarabs are known47. 4662 (Fig. 7; PL 13). Deformed gold setting for scarab (missing), traces of composition, parts of silver wire preserved Materials and dimensions (reconstructed) Scarab: traces of composition, yellowish-white (bone-coloured). Setting: gold alloy; length 1.7, width 1.0, height 0.5. Wire: silver alloy; diameter approximately 0.1. Discussion and summary The absence of clearly recognizable burial layers makes the division of the material into different periods problematic, given the fact that the tomb is likely to have been used over a long period. However, efforts were made to date the different vessels on the basis of stylistic features and parallels from sites which are fairly well-dated. The risk in this method is obvious and has been raised by several authors48: pottery from different periods can end up in the same context, and the life span varies depending on their provenance. In the case of the Sahem tomb, however, a typological analysis and study of ceramic technology, together with the dates given by the scarabs afford the only possibility of making a differentiation between the ages of the various items. The preliminary analysis of the pottery shapes and wares seems to indicate that the tomb was in use during Late Bronze Age I and II A-B49. The most recent material seems to belong to the transitional Late Bronze Age II B/Iron Age I. The majority of the vessels should be dated within the Late Bronze Age II and probably in the later part. One (4659) of the four scarabs from the Sahem tomb seems to be of much earlier date (late 12th-early 13th Dynasty or end of Middle Bronze Age IIA - beginning of Middle Bronze Age II B) than the other material found together with it, particularly the pottery. A second one (4660) is most probably of the same date as the earliest ceramic evidence, i.e. of the early 18th Dynasty or the Late Bronze Age I. The two remaining scarabs (4658 and 4661) belong 44 KiRKBRiDE 1965, Fig. 284, 2; 300, 5.16. 45 Oren 1973, 94 Nr. 1. 46 RowE 1936, Nr. 427. 47 Rowe 1936, No. 657, 803, 809, 828; Loud 1948, PL 158, 167; 159, 208.

A more ancient scarab in a later tomb is nothing extraordinary. As amulets, heirlooms, and objects of far reaching trade, scarabs and other stampseals outlasted generations and even once they were buried along with the dead they could become the object of tomb-robbery and be used again. Addition: A further scarab was found during the conversation of the corroded jewelry. It was too late discovered to be included in this article. The dimensions are: length 1.1; width 0.8; heigth 0.6. It is of rock crystal and obviously a hedgehog scaraboid (Keel 1995, 71 f ? 153-146 and 142 ? 362-364). Preliminary date: later part of the Middle Bronze Age - Late Bronze Age.
