<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Metaphoric Parallelist Approach to the Sociology of Theistic Beliefs: Theme, Variations and Implications* J. Alan Winter Connecticut College Works representing what is called the metaphoric parallelist approach to the sociology of theistic beliefs are reviewed. All the works contend that theistic assertions are metaphorical representations of social facts, that is, that there is a parallel between the characteristics attributed to gods and real properties of the social world. The works discussed differ as to which assertions about gods are examined and which social facts they are said to represent. The possibility of a mutually facilitative relationship between sociological inquiry and theistic discourse, based upon metaphorical parallelism, is discussed. Such a relationship is possible since metaphorical parallelism implies that there is much sociology in theistic discourse, albeit metaphorically stated, and that there are at least some concepts relevant to theistic discourse in sociology, even if disguised and transformed. One of the central problems for the sociology of religion is, to use Durkheim's (1965:20) phrase, "the old problem of the origins of religion." Of course, the search for the very first beginnings of religion has largely been "resolutely discarded," as Durkheim (1965:20) himself urged. Sociologists have, instead, followed his (1965:20) suggestion and sought "the ever present causes upon which the most essential forms of religious thought and practice depend." The search for such ever-present causes has generally moved along the two paths blazed by Durkheim in his classic, The Elementary Forms of Religious Life. The first, and by far the more common path, is taken by those who ask, "What functions does religion serve?" The second, less common path, is taken by those who ask, "To what do religious symbols refer?" Those who follow the first path search for the ever-present causes of religious thought and practices in the consequences they have for their adherents. Those who follow the second path search for truth-value of religious symbols as representa- tions of man's environment and experiences. The development of the sociology of religion along the first path has been aptly summarized by Parsons (1944), O'Dea (1966) and Schneider *Revision of a paper delivered at the meetings of the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, New York, October 23, 1970. Thanks are due Ivan Strenski and Ernest Wallwork for critical comments of an early draft of this paper. 212</page><page sequence="2">METAPHORIC PARALLELIST APPROACH TO SOCIOLOGY OF THEISTIC BELIEFS 213 (1970). Hence, it will not be reviewed here. This paper will, however, summarize the progress of Durkheim (1965), Swanson (1964; 1967), Marx and Engels (1964) and Simmel (1957) along the second path. Specifically, it will examine progress towards the identification of the "true" (societal) referents of one class of religious statements, viz., those about a god or gods.' All of the approaches to be examined here agree that the naturalistic referents of theistic discourses are social facts.2 Specifically, all agree that theistic assertions are metaphorical representations of social facts, i.e., that there is a parallel between the characteristics attributed to the gods and those attributed to the real properties of the social world. Thus, I call the approach to the sociology of theism discussed herein the metaphorical parallelist approach.3 The four representatives of the approach discussed in this paper differ as to which assertions about gods are examined and as to which social facts are seen as their referents. The Elementary Forms of Religious Life (Durkheim, 1965) provides the most general, albeit not the first, of the four metaphorical parallelist statements on the social referents of theistic discourse and is the first 'Progress along the "second path" has not been restricted to examination of statements about god or gods. Durkheim (1965), for example, discusses belief in a soul and in an afterlife; Swanson (1964) examines the roots of belief in ancestral spirits, reincarnation, the soul, witchcraft and mana as well as beliefs specifically involving a god or gods. However, discussion of studies of statements other than those pertaining to a god or gods is beyond the scope of this paper. It is also beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the work of non-sociologists who, like Freud (1955, 1960, 1964) and Feuerbach (1957), contend that the "true" referents of statements about gods are the objects of given psychological processes. 2The term "theism" is used throughout this paper in its more general sense, that is, to refer to beliefs about any god or gods, rather than in its more specific sense as a belief in one God as the creator and ruler of the universe. The term "theology" has not been used since it refers not only to beliefs about the attributes of a god or god per se, but to the study of other religious issues, such as sin and salvation (See The American College Dictionary, 1966:1255, 1256). 3The term "metaphorical parallelism" is coined here and used in place of the term "social involvement approach" coined by Swanson (1971: 178) for two reasons: 1) the new term refers very clearly and unambiguously to the central thesis of the approach in question; 2) reference to "social involvement" could well be misleading because of the ambiguity of the term "social." For example, the term "social involvement" could be interpreted as referring to involvement in such social groups as voluntary associations, an involvement not directly nor generally of interest to the approach in question. Bellah's (1970:248-250) use of the term "symbolic reductionism" to refer to the Durkheimian and Marxian positions discussed here is avoided since, as noted below, I do not think the positions in question need be reductionistic, although they may be. A metaphoric parallelist need not reject the claim that theistic symbols, in particular, and religion, in general, is a reality sui generis. All the metaphorical parallelist need claim is that just as sui generis sociological phenomena are not completely independent of psychological processes, neither are sui generis theistic symbols completely independent of social pro- cesses. To argue that two sets of phenomena are interdependent is clearly not to argue that one need be reducible to the other.</page><page sequence="3">214 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS work considered here.4 Swanson's The Birth of the Gods (1964) and his Religion and Regime (1967) are considered next, as they represent a con- scious attempt to refine Durkheim's original formulations. The paper then turns to Marx and Engel's On Religion (1964) and Simmel's article, "A Contribution to the Sociology of Religion" (1957). These latter works represent alternative developments of the parallelist's basic thesis. The Marxian variation, as expected, reflects a concern with the pivotal nature of economic institutions, while Simmel's reflects his concern with sociation and social forms. Finally, the paper discusses the possibility of a mutually facilitative relationship between sociological inquiry and theistic discourse. It will be suggested first that sociological insights which could serve as heuristic devices may be found in the metaphors of theistic discourse. Second, it will be suggested that sociological inquiry may help sharpen the clarity of concepts and distinctions within theistic discourse insofar as such discourse is a metaphorically expressed sociology. The Metaphorical Parallelist Approach: Theme and Variation The Durkheimian Theme. In the Elementary Forms of Religious Life, Durkheim describes the social facts which he believes are the true referents of three basic theistic statements: 1) "God is transcendent over man;"1 2) "God is immanent in man;" and 3) "God occupies a world fundamentally different from that which man occupies." The key to Durkheim's views on the specific referents to each of these three statements lies in his (1965:237) general proposition that a god stands in the same relationship to his worshippers as a society does to its members. That is, each of the three relationships between the gods and man just cited is said to refer to a similar or parallel relationship between society and man. In short, Durkheim (1965:257) suggests that theism is basically . . . a system of ideas with which the individuals represent to themselves the society of which they are members, and the obscure but intimate relations which they have with it ... Though metaphorical and symbolic, this representation is not unfaithful. Specifically, Durkheim (1965:236-237) argues that the belief in a god's transcendence is a metaphoric representation or symbolic parallel of the moral authority and superiority of society over its individual members. That is, belief in a god's transcendence represents man's experience with 4It should be noted that in his later works, Durkheim did not directly address himself to the development of what I have called the metaphorical parallelist approach. Indeed, even in The Elementary Forms, he was perhaps more interested in the functions of theism as an integrating factor in society than in the development of the metaphoric parallelist's interests in its symbolic nature. Moreover, the typical summary of Durkheim's sociology of religion moves quickly from noting that he held, as a metaphorical parallelist, that "god" was a symbolic expression of society to emphasizing the role of such a symbol in the processes of social integration (Cf. Parsons, 1944; and more recently, Greeley, 1972:32-34). In any case, the focus of this paper is on the metaphoric parallelist approach taken in one of Durkheim's works and not on the corpus of Durkheim's work.</page><page sequence="4">METAPHORIC PARALLELIST APPROACH TO SOCIOLOGY OF THEISTIC BELIEFS 215 the control that society has over his actions, over his thoughts, and even over his desires, and has convinced him (and correctly so, in Durkheim's view) that there is an entity which is transcendent over him. If man errs, it is only in believing that that entity is a god rather than society. However, society is more than a source of authority and control over men. It is the source of their distinctly human qualities. "A man is a man only because he is civilized" (Durkheim, 1965:243). Society is the source of his language, his instruments or tools and his knowledge. Moreover, there are occasions, Durkheim asserts (1965:240) in which the "strengthening and vivifying action of society is especially apparent." Durkheim regards some of these occasions as exceptional, such as the collective effervescence of a French Revolution. However, he also cites less exceptional cases as the times when one experiences a sense of satisfac- tion and confidence as a result of having performed his moral duty. Such exceptional and unexceptional occasions, coupled with man's depen- dence on the methods and traditions provided by society and learned by him, indicate that the "collective force is not entirely outside of us; . . . this force must also penetrate us and organize itself from within us; it thus becomes an integral part of our being and by that fact this is elevated and magnified" (Durkheim, 1965: 240). That is, the force which is called "god" or "society" is not only outside and above man, it is within him; "god" is immanent within man. Finally, Durkheim explains why the being that is thought to be both transcendent and immanent is also thought to occupy a world fundamen- tally different from that of which man is a part. The Durkheimian explana- tion is that man occupies the world of simple visual objects and that his relationship to such objects is unlike that which he has with society. Two specific differences are said to exist. Men do not respect simple visible objects and they do not "raise us outside ourselves" (Durkheim, 1965:243). Since society is respected and it does raise us outside ourselves, Durkheim (1965:243) concludes, we get the impression that we are in relations with two distinct sorts of reality and that a sharply drawn line of demarcation separates them from each other; on the one hand, is the world of the profane things, on the other that of sacred things. Man occupies the former, and the gods, the latter, a fundamentally differ- ent world. Swanson's Development of Metaphoric Parallelism. Swanson (1964) accepts Durkheim's basic tenet that theistic assertions are metaphorical represen- tations or symbols of social facts, and advances the Durkheimian formula- tions by describing the specific components of society which he holds to be the referents of theistic beliefs. Swanson uses three properties commonly attributed to gods to aid in identifying the social facts to which theistic assertions refer. He notes</page><page sequence="5">216 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS that gods are said to: 1) have life spans greater than that of humans; 2) to be orderly and predictable individuals, not diffuse conditions; and 3) to have distinct purposes. Their greater life span suggests to Swanson that gods represent groups rather than individuals, since social facts about the former persist for relatively long periods, while those about individuals do not. The fact that gods are seen as individuals with an identity rather than as diffuse conditions indicates to Swanson that they symbolize par- ticular groups rather than groups in general. Moreover, the distinctive nature of the purposes of each god suggests that each represents a group with distinctive purposes. One class of groups with distinctive purposes is that which has sovereignty over some particular sphere of life. Swanson (1964:18-21) suggests, insofar as a group has sovereignty, it may provide the model for conceptions of the deity. Swanson makes it clear, however, that sovereign groups per se are not the model for gods. Gods are, instead, modeled on the social arrangements which constitute sovereignty. He calls these arrangements "constitutional structures." "These constitutional structures are," Swanson (1964:27) claims, "what men often conceptualize as personified and supernatural beings." Constitutional structures are the social arrangements which "define those affairs with which [an] organization may legitimately con- cern itself . . and 'state' the proper procedures for making and executing decisions" (Swanson, 1964:23). Thus, "god," in Swanson's (1964:190) view, is a metaphoric representation or symbol which parallels not the total society as Durkheim argues, but the "structures by which goals are chosen, and rewards and responsibilities allocated," the structures by which decisions are made in the areas of legitimate concern to the society's sovereign groups. That is, "god" is a metaphorical representation of the structure of the political regime. The properties attributed to the gods have their parallels in the structure of the regime. In The Birth of the Gods, differences in theistic beliefs from one primitive society to another are shown to be related to differences in the structure of their respective political regimes. Particular theistic doctrines are regarded as metaphorical or symbolic representations of basic facts of the political life of the society. For example, the presence (or absence) of monotheism is related to the presence (or absence) of a political or decision-making structure for which it is a reasonable metaphoric or symbolic representation. Monotheism, by Swanson's definition (1964:56), is a belief in a single deity or "high god" who is "considered ultimately responsible for all events, whether as history's creator, its director, or both." Swanson goes on to argue (1964:92), If we search for the conditions which correspond to the idea of a high god, and if we assume that these conditions will involve the actions of sovereign groups, then we seek situations in which such groups bring unity to the world's diversity.</page><page sequence="6">METAPHORIC PARALLELIST APPROACH TO SOCIOLOGY OF THEISTIC BELIEFS 217 He contends (1964:63) that such a situation, i.e., one in which a sovereign group brings unity to the world's diversity, exists when the ultimate sovereign group to which the individual gives allegiance has two or more other groups subordinate to it. The subordinate groups must themselves be sovereign groups with distinctive purposes of their own (Swanson, 1964:64), for then the superordinate group can clearly be seen as modify- ing them and bringing them together in some fashion. In a later work, Swanson (1967:22) notes that the requisite conditions exist where a council of elders from several villages ... coordinate(s) decisions affecting all of those villages, and in every village a local council may develop policies affecting several organized clans of which each village is composed. Under these conditions, one over- arching source of decision and purpose provides unity among groups diverse in pur- pose. And under such conditions, people will come to believe that there is a single spirit or deity who is "considered ultimately responsible for all events." That is, they will develop a monotheism which is a metaphoric representation of the structure of the political regime which governs them. They will come to believe in a single god with such attributes as the ability to serve as "the over-arching source of decisions and purpose," and to "provide unity among groups diverse in purpose," attributes which have their parallels in the political structure of their real world. In his later work, Religion and Regime, Swanson (1967) seeks to identify the variations in political structure which account for the presence or absence in the countries of Reformation Europe of the belief that a high god (monotheistic deity) is immanent in history and in his creations, controlling and directing them. Following the line of reasoning established in his earlier work (1964), he begins by noting "in explaining a high god's characteristics, one should look at some properties of central gov- ernment" (1967:23). He continues (1967:28), If such [high) gods represent experiences with the unifying activities that central govern- ments exercise over groups subordinate to them, then whether an actively governing high god will be judged immanent should depend on whether the actions of such a government are believed to embody only that government's purposes.... Government, he adds (1967:30), will not be seen as embodying only its own purposes when "the exercise of government is not, in principle, separated from the influence of special interests [for then] the common purpose, that is, the regime's own distinctive purpose, is difficult to separate from the special." That is, God is not seen as immanent, control- ling and directing his creations, in those countries where the political structure does not protect the regime from the influence of special inter- ests. Such protection is lacking where "men or groups participate legitimately in a regime not solely as its officers or agents but also in</page><page sequence="7">218 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS their status as . .. promoters of legitimate special interests that exist inde- pendently of the common interest. . ." (Swanson, 1967:42). Where the purposes of the regime and the purposes of the special interests co-mingle, there may be one authority that is ultimately responsible to create unity out of diversity, but it will not control and direct that diversity. If such is the case, a belief in a high (monotheistic) god who is not immanent in history and in his creations is a reasonable metaphoric representation of the basic political structure of the regime. Such a belief posits that while there is an authority which is ultimately responsible for creating unity out of diversity, it does not direct or control all the diverse beings in his creation. Lesser authorities, such as man, may often go their own way, following their own special interests. The Marxian Variation. The Marxian view, like Swanson's, and unlike Durkheim's, argues that the true referents of theistic discourse are specific components of society rather than society as a whole. However, while for Swanson that component is the political realm, in the Marxian view, it is the economic. The Marxian alternative also introduces an evolutionary scheme not present in either Swanson's or Durkheim's version of parallel- ist thought.5 Specifically, the Marxian argument seeks to explain why bourgeois society sees God as an alien, inexplicable and dominating factor. The explanation offered begins by positing a three-stage process of evolution which culminates in monotheism. In the first stage, religion reflects the mysterious non-social forces of nature. That is, "All religion . . . is nothing but the fantastic reflection in men's minds of those external forces which control their daily life, a reflection in which the terrestrial forces assume the form of supernatural forces. . ." (Marx and Engels, 1964:147). However, in the second stage, religion comes to reflect social as well as non-social forces. That is, as "social forces begin to be active . .. do- minating [men]; with the same apparent natural necessity as the forces of nature themselves (t)he fantastic figures, which at first only reflected the mysterious forces of nature, at this point acquire social attributes, be- come representatives of the forces of history" (Marx and Engels, 1964:147). Finally, in the first stage, monotheism replaces polytheism as the sym- bolic representation of the alien forces which dominate man. Moreover, In this convenient, handy and universally adaptable [monotheistic) form, religion can continue to exist as the immediate, that is, sentimental form of men's relation to the alien natural and social forces which dominate them (1964:148). 5As Wallwork (1972) observes, Durkheim did develop an evolutionary scheme in the course of his career. However, this development is not part of his version of the parallelist position, and hence, is not pertinent to this paper. 6The quotes cited herein are from Frederick Engels, "Anti-Duehring," in Marx and Engels (1964). Thus, it is necessary to speak of the "Marxian argument" rather than of "Marx's argument."</page><page sequence="8">METAPHORIC PARALLELIST APPROACH TO SOCIOLOGY OF THEISTIC BELIEFS 219 To explain why bourgeois society sees its monotheistic God as an alien, inexplicable and dominating force, the Marxian now needs only to identify the forces which dominate it. Bourgeois theism can then be shown to attribute to God the properties of the alien forces which dominate it. The Marxian, of course, claims that the forces which dominate man in bourgeois society are "the economic conditions created by themselves, by the means of production which they themselves have produced, as if by an alien force" (italics added, 1964:148). The parallel between the alien, inexplicable and dominating monotheistic God of the bourgeois Protestants on the one hand, and the nature of their economic order, on the other hand, is clear: It is still true that man proposes and God (that is, the alien domination of the capitalist mode of production) disposes. . . [only when society) by taking possession of all means of production and using them on a planned basis has freed itself and all its members from the bondage in which they are now held by these means of production. . . when therefore man no longer merely proposes, but also disposes-only then will the last alien force which is still reflected in religion vanish; and with it will also vanish the religious reflection itself, for the simple reason that then there will be nothing left to reflect (parentheses in original, 1964:148-149). In sum, the Marxian position is that God, as conceived by the bourgeois, is a metaphoric representation of the basic characteristics of the economic order; the alien, inexplicable domination of the capitalistic system over bourgeois society. Simmel's Variation. Simmel's (1957) formulations, like the Marxian, con- tain an evolutionary scheme. However, in contrast to the Marxian and Swansonian positions, Simmel's does not find parallels for attributes of gods in any specific component of society; rather such parallels are found with social relationships in general. ". . . religious ideas could never" claims Simmel (1957:336), "have obtained their influence upon men if they had not been the formulas or embodiments of previously existing relations for which consciousness has not yet found a more appropriate expression . . ." The relationships Simmel speaks of are clearly social rela- tionships, for, he says (1957:339), "religion, whatever else it may be, consists of forms of social relationships which, separated from their empir- ical content, become independent and have substances of their own attributed to them." In other words, Simmel contends that the develop- ment of religious thought passes through three stages. First, men experi- ence some form of social relationship. Its attributes are then abstracted and labeled; they become "formulae" standing for the attributes in ques- tion. However, having been abstracted, they are "separated from their empirical content" and become concepts in the minds of men. Finally, the abstractions are reified and said to be the real attributes of a real being. That is, they "have substances of their own attributed to them." Simmel's approach is illustrated by his explanation of the origin of</page><page sequence="9">220 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS the assertion that God is a being in whom one can "believe." He begins by observing (1957:336), "When I say, 'I believe in God,'. . . (i)t means not only that I accept the existence of God, even though it may not be fully demonstrable, but it implies also a certain subjective relation to him. . ." He goes on to note that the relationship between a believer and his god just described has its analogy in much of human interaction. "We do not," he asserts (1957:336-337), base our mutual relations by any means upon what we conclusively know about each other. Rather, our feelings and suggestions express themselves in certain representa- tions which can be described only as matters of faith . .. which we illustrate when we 'believe in someone.' In short, Simmel begins his explanation of the origins of a belief in God by describing forms of social relationships in which men experience other people who have a similar "believability." He then goes on to argue that the social relationships involved are first abstracted or conceptualized and then "separated from their empirical content," and finally reified. Specifically, he claims, "In faith in a deity the highest development of faith has become incorporate, so to speak, has been relieved of its connec- tion with its social counterpart." Thus, the three-step process of experi- ence with relationships based on faith, the representation of such relations in abstractions, and the attribution of substance to those abstractions is completed and men assert they believe in God. The formula or embodi- ment of a previously existing social relationship has found an appropriate expression which is a metaphoric representation that symbolizes attributes which have their parallels in the social world. Implications for the Relationship Between Sociological and Theological Inquiry The central theme of the metaphorical parallelist approach to the sociology of theism is that the terms and assertions of theistic discourse are symbolic representations of man's experiences in and with social pro- cesses. In a sense, then, sociological inquiry and theistic discourse are seen as having a common referent-social facts. That is, metaphorical parallelism implies that there is much sociology in theistic discourse, albeit metaphorically stated, and that there are at least some concepts relevant to theistic discourse in sociology, even if disguised and transformed. Of course, this is not necessarily to claim that theistic discourse is nothing more than sociology in metaphorical form, i.e., that theistic discourse can be reduced to sociology. While admittedly there are reductionistic tendencies within the metaphorical parallelist approach, reductionism remains an option, not a requirement for a metaphorical parallelism.7 7For discussion of reductionist and non-reductionist tendencies in Durkheim's treatment of theism, see Wallwork (1972:62-64 and especially 185).</page><page sequence="10">METAPHORIC PARALLELIST APPROACH TO SOCIOLOGY OF THEISTIC BELIEFS 221 The metaphorical parallelist need claim only that when men seek to describe and discuss the qualities of a supernatural deity, metaphorical representations of human experiences in and with social processes are among the symbols which serve, unconsciously or otherwise, as catalysts or analogues in their groping attempts to describe the nature of their God or gods. Such a claim respects the basic sui generis nature of both theistic symbols and social processes, while allowing discussion of their possible relatedness. In any case, metaphorical parallelism implies that sociological inquiry and theistic discourse may be mutually facilitative.8 First, the approach suggests that the metaphorically expressed sociological insights in theistic discourse could prove a valuable source of heuristic propositions for empirical or theoretical investigations in sociology. Second, it suggests that sociological inquiry may yield concepts and insights which may be used to sharpen the clarity of concepts used and distinctions made within theistic discourse. Since the author is not a theologian but a sociologist interested in the development of his discipline, the ensuing discussion of how theistic discourse might benefit from sociology will be brief and even more general than the prior discussion of how sociology might make use of such discourse. "Decoding" the Sociological Insights in Theistic Discourse. If, as Durkheim (1965:257) implies, theism is a metaphorical and not unfaithful represen- tation of social facts, then a sociologist who can infer what the referents of theistic metaphors are, will have uncovered a body of propositions about man's social experience. Unfortunately, not enough is yet known, as Swanson (1971:178) reminds us, "about the main variations in the contents of beliefs, and in the nature of social relationships to draw these inferences with . . . certainty." Nevertheless, the propositions which are inferred may serve as heuristic devices to guide empirical or theoretical study which could advance sociological knowledge. Furthermore, while the specifics may be lacking, three general steps in the process of inference can be identified. The first step is obviously to select a theistic assertion of interest. Unfor- tunately, there are no rules, at present, to guide the selection of a theistic assertion to focus upon. Moreover, it should be noted that in a religiously pluralistic society such as the United States where religious consciousness is closely related to ethnic, regional and socioeconomic status differences, inferences from the theistic assertions of one group may reveal proposi- 8It is perhaps worth noting that while this paper suggests that a mutually facilitative relationship between sociological and theistic discourse is possible on the basis of the metaphorical parallelist approach to the sociology of theistic discourse, it is still possible, as Shepherd (1972) contends, that the use of a functionalist approach would inhibit a reconciliation between sociological and theistic discourse.</page><page sequence="11">222 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS tions which pertain only to their experiences. In other words, the proposi- tions inferred from the theistic assertions of a given group may not apply to the society as a whole nor to the experiences of those who do not assert the doctrine under study. Once a theistic assertion is selected for study, the "decoding" or interpre- tation of its sociological content can begin. First, the social facts which are originally stated metaphorically as references to a deity, must be "unmasked" and presented in more straight-forward sociological terms. Then, the parallels between the characteristics attributed to the deity and social phenomena must be identified. Thus, the second step in the process of "decoding" is to interpret the term "god," and the third, to interpret or "decode" the characteristics attributed to him. Obviously, the specific aspect of social life to which a theistic assertion is said to refer will vary depending upon which version of the metaphorical parallelist approach is taken. For example, if the assertion in question is, "God heeds the prayers of all men," the Durkheimian version would "decode" or interpret it as representing some aspects of man's relationship to society as a whole or to some general or universal social fact. Similarly, if Simmel's version is employed, the inferred or "decoded" proposition would involve social psychological or micro-sociological factors, inasmuch as the social relationships to which Simmel believes theistic discourse refers are mainly face-to-face or primary relations. However, if either the Marxian or Swansonian version were used, the inferred or "decoded" proposition would not refer to society in general or even to social relation- ships in general, but rather to specific institutions. For the Marxian, the reference would be to economic institutions; for the Swansonian, to the political, since the Marxian and Swansonian versions hold that theistic discourse primarily represents experiences with economic or polit- ical structures respectively. In any case, however one "decodes" or interprets the term "God" in the assertion in question, the next step would be to define or describe the characteristic attributed to God and seek its parallel in whatever social fact "God" metaphorically represents. Obviously, there will be much dispute here as well. Nothing approaching a definitive statement is likely within the foreseeable future. However, for purposes of illustration, the phrase "heeds the prayers of all men," will be interpreted or "decoded" as referring to a relationship in which successful (since "heeded") influ- ence attempts ("prayers") can be made by any subordinate (i.e., "all men"). The term "subordinate" is used since prayer is here regarded as a supplica- tion to a superior rather than the request of an equal or an order from a superordinate. Now, by combining the last two steps, i.e., the "decoding" of the refer- ence to a deity and to one of his attributes: 1) the Durkheimian interpreta- tion would contend that the assertion "God heeds the prayers of all</page><page sequence="12">METAPHORIC PARALLELIST APPROACH TO SOCIOLOGY OF THEISTIC BELIEFS 223 men," indicates that despite the external and constraining nature of society, men do exert some influence, however small, on the course of social processes, i.e.,society is influenced to an extent by the wishes of its members. 2) Simmel would interpret the statement as referring to the inevitable mutuality of all social relationships, even those involving domination or isolation, however one-sided they appear to the non- sociological eye. 3) A Marxian would "decode" the doctrine as saying, "The basic economic structures of the society in question are open to the influence of all those participating in it." In other words, that the class struggle, while persisting, has somehow been muted, and all men, ruler and ruled, bourgeoisie and proletariat, now exert some meaningful influence on the processes of economic decision-making. 4) A Swansonian would offer a similar "decoding," with the term "political" substituted for "economic." Thus, for the Marxian, the theistic doctrine "God heeds the prayers of all men," could be seen as a metaphorical representation or parallel to an incomplete socialist or communist economy; for the Swansonian, the doctrine would similarly refer to a limited democracy. Unfortunately, given the "present state of the art," there is no generally accepted procedure for deciding which of the versions just offered is accurate, if indeed, any is. There is no agreed upon logic or set of rules of interpretation. Thus, the results of attempts to "decode" theistic asser- tions will, as Swanson (1971:180) recognizes, "vary with the predilections of the analyst who works within the approach." Lacking any specific rules of interpretation, the only basis for deciding whose interpretation to accept and whose to reject are the general standards of scholarship and logic applicable to all analyses. However, a giant step towards specify- ing the desired rules of interpretation would be made if and when empiri- cal investigation supports one rather than another of the parallelists. For example, if studies support Swanson's implication that the content of theistic discourse varies with differences in the political processes it metaphorically represents, rather than the Marxian implication that it varies with differences in economic processes, then decoding would seek to uncover "hidden" or "coded" references to political rather than economic processes. In other words, if and when empirical studies show that the content of theistic discourse varies with differences in one set of social facts rather than another, decoding could be directed at uncover- ing references to that set of facts rather than to another. However, until such time as the requisite findings are reported, it can be expected that most sociologists, given a scientist's preference for rigor, will not be tempted to engage in the subtle process of decoding suggested here. They will, instead, prefer to derive the models and hypotheses which guide their work in a more orthodox manner from standard sociological sources. Still, those concerned with creating a closer and more cooperative relationship between sociology and theology will be tempted to "decode"</page><page sequence="13">224 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS theistic discourse in the manner suggested here. In other words, while sociology per se certainly can advance without such decoding, the relation- ship between sociology and theology might not. Other Views on the Use of Theological Discourse. The suggestion that propositions rooted in theological positions may be of use to social science is not entirely new. Kolb (1961), addressing sociologists, and Chein (1962) and Spilka (1970), addressing psychologists, have each suggested that a theologically based doctrine of man which views man as an active, responsible actor rather than as an environmentally determined reactor provides a more viable description of man than the doctrines then preval- ent in their own respective disciplines. Kolb (1961:5) suggests ". . . an image of man rooted in one of the strands of theJudeo-Christian tradition may be better suited to the ordering of sociological data than those models currently [19611 in use." However, the use of theology made by Kolb (1961), by Chein (1962) and by Spilka (1970) differs from that suggested by metaphorical parallelism. They make use of relatively straight-forward statements or models about man. Such statements or models, while rooted in the discipline of theology rather than in that of the social sciences, can readily be regarded as making truth claims similar to those of social scientists, whatever the intentions of their original authors. That is, the claim that man is an active responsible actor can be regarded, whether originally intended to be or not, as no more or less a straight-forward empirical assertion than that in any social scientific model rooted in the traditions of its own discipline. However, the theological assertions whose use is suggested here are metaphorical, not straight-forward, statements about social processes. Moreover, since they are overtly about super- natural (not natural) phenomena they cannot readily be regarded as making truth claims similar to those of social science. The assertions discussed here must be "decoded" or interpreted before they can be used in sociological inquiry. A given theological doctrine of man may be adapted to sociological inquiry without the subtle process of "decoding" or interpretation needed to make similar use of a doctrine about God. The position of metaphorical parallelism about the relationship between theistic discourse and sociological inquiry is also similar to that of "symbolic realism" proposed by Bellah (1970:237-257). Both posi- tions envision the possibility of a mutual facilitation between aspects of religious discourse and sociological inquiry. However, while symbolic real- ism focuses upon possible links between noncognitive religious symbols and sociological inquiry (Bellah, 1970:252-254), metaphorical parallelism calls attention to the cognitive symbols of theistic beliefs. Possible Foci of "Decoding." This paper has suggested that propositions of heuristic value to sociology may be discovered by "decoding" or inter- preting cognitive symbols within theistic discourse. Such "decoding" or interpretation may be of especial value if it has one or another of two</page><page sequence="14">METAPHORIC PARALLELIST APPROACH TO SOCIOLOGY OF THEISTIC BELIEFS 225 foci. First, it may focus upon the more general or universal aspects of theistic discourse across societies. Second, it may focus upon key shifts in theistic beliefs within a given society. A focus on the more general or universal aspects of theistic discourse may be of especial value to sociology since, if metaphorical parallelism is empirically correct, such aspects should reflect more general or universal aspects of human social experience. Thus, a determination of what are the referents of the metaphors used in theistic discourse could reveal some propositions about basic social processes. Something of this use of theistic discourse is suggested by Swanson's concluding remarks in The Birth of the Gods (1964:190-193). Swanson states that one of the more persistent themes in theistic dis- course is the notion that some deity acts upon the members of a society, shaping their conduct and giving meaning to the roles they play in society. As noted above, Swanson contends that this persistent theme metaphori- cally represents the social arrangements or constitutional structures which constitute sovereignty. However, since sovereignty is a pervasive aspect of all social organizations, examination of theistic discourse may prove relevant not only to the study of total societies, but to that of less inclusive social organizations as well. Two related hypotheses are suggested. First, it may be hypothesized that the members of a given social organiza- tion experience and formulate their experiences with the total structure of that social organization and not merely those aspects of it with which they are personally in touch. For example, students and faculty may experience a "college" as a totality and formulate their experiences with it, even though they are personally in touch with only a few courses or a single department. While their statements about the "college as a whole" may be inaccurate, they will, nevertheless, be able to offer intellig- ible remarks about it. The hypothesis offered here is consistent with the ability of theists to formulate a view representing, according to metaphorical parallelists, aspects of their total society and of their relation- ship to it. A second and related hypothesis is that participants in a given social organization will come to perceive their organization as having a life of its own, i.e.,as containing a persistent "corporate personality, much as a society's members come to represent their society metaphorically by referring to the personality of a god. Moreover, like a god, the 6corporate personality" would be regarded as somewhat independent of and different from the members of the organization, yet able to act on them in a predictable manner. Thus Swanson notes (1964:191): Although one rarely talks in supernatural terms when describing large scale organization, small, persisting groups, communities or crowds .. (we) do speak of the 'spirit' of such groups, of their 'character' . . . of the hold which they have on their members, of the deep involvement which people develop in connection with such organizations, and of the 'sacred' quality of these relationships.</page><page sequence="15">226 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS Obviously, the two hypotheses just offered will not revolutionize sociology. However, they may help make it possible to explore in direct and concrete terms the interactions of such political matters as sovereignty and constitutional structures with man's attempts to formulate his experi- ences with such matters. Knowing the sources of such formulations, sociologists can begin to study why some features are more evident in some social organizations than in others. Such study could facilitate advances in both political sociology and the sociology of knowledge. If they do, then propositions derived from a focus on the more general aspects of theistic discourse across societies would have facilitated the development of sociology. In a similar manner, a focus upon key shifts in theistic beliefs in a given society may also yield propositions of value to sociological study of that society. If metaphorical parallelism is empirically correct, key shifts in theistic beliefs should reflect shifts in the social structures which are metaphorically represented in such beliefs, e.g., the total society for a Durkheimian; political structures for a Swansonian; economic struc- tures for a Marxian; and primary relations for a follower of Simmel. For example, if the Marxian approach is taken, a shift from the bourgeois, Protestant belief that God is a dominating and alien force would suggest a parallel shift in the economic conditions which such a belief reflects. Indeed, such a shift is taking place within Protestant theology. For example, the so-called process theology based in the work of Alfred North Whitehead holds, as summarized by Livingston (1971:486), that "God is not omnipotent in the traditional theistic sense. His relations to the world are persuasive, not coercive." Moreover, as Cobb (1971:135) notes, summarizing Whitehead, "God is really concerned about the world in all its details and even suffers with us in our suffering. What we are and do really makes a difference to God." Thus within process theology God is seen not as dominating man, but as persuading him; God is not an alien figure, but one who cares about man. In other words, ... in Reformation Protestantism, men were identified as God's creatures or depen- dents, or servants or worshippers. The most dignified role allotted them was as God's images or as children in his household. . . . new trends in [Protestantism] ... make another role the chief one, namely, the role of man as equally dependent with God in a common task (Swanson, 1968:825). There is then a growing focus on a new relationship in which, as the secular theologian Cox (1966:231) puts it, "contemporary man could meet God as a 'You.' " Furthermore, the concept of an I-You relationship reflects, a new type of interhuman relationship ... one that is just as human as I-Thou, but qualitatively different... It describes very well the rewarding relationship one has with a fellow team member, with whom one has worked on a research project. . . It</page><page sequence="16">METAPHORIC PARALLELIST APPROACH TO SOCIOLOGY OF THEISTIC BELIEFS 227 derives from work that is done together by two persons for whom the work is their mutuality (Cox, 1966:230). In other words, contemporary theistic discourse may be shifting from a view of God as a dominating, alien force to one which stresses the development of an I-You relationship between man and God, the relationship of co-workers or team members on a mutual task or project. Moreover, as the old entrepreneurial, bourgeois economy is superseded by the corporate economy of organization men (Whyte, 1957) in the technostructure of the new industrial state (Galbraith, 1967), ours is an economy run by team members working together on projects. That is, the economic conditions of contemporary society are more accurately represented by views which stress the development of I-You relationships than by one which stresses the workings of a dominating, alien force.9 The shift in theistic discourse from a focus on a view of God as an alien force to one which sees God and man in an I-You relationship may, as a metaphorical parallelist would suggest, reflect the shift in basic economic conditions. Moreover, a sociologist who was sensitive to the shift in the content of theistic discourse would have a clue that an analog- ous shift was taking place in the social structures of which such discourse is a metaphoric representation. Obviously, sociologists could become aware of the shifts in question from studying sources other than theistic discourse. Nevertheless, it remains possible that an ability to interpret or "decode" key shifts in the theistic discourse of a given society would facilitate the advances of sociological understanding of that society by signaling important institutional change.10 In sum, either from a focus upon the more general or universal aspects of theistic discourse across societies or from a focus upon key shifts in theistic beliefs within a given society, discourse about the properties of a god or gods, if properly "decoded" or interpreted, may yield proposi- tions which could serve as heuristic devices to guide the advance of sociology. Sociology and the Facilitation of Theistic Discourse. If metaphorical parallel- ism is correct, sociological concepts may be of use in advancing theological inquiry. That is, appropriate sociological concepts may be "re-coded" into relevant theistic terms. After all, the metaphorical parallelists claim both sociology and theistic assertions have a common referent-social facts. Thus, for example, sociological inquiry may provide insights into the nature of human relationships which could be used to help develop modern theology. Such insights will be particularly helpful in the present day since, as Hardy (1970:257) observes, 9For further discussion of the theological import of the development of corporate or managerial capitalism see Oppen (1969). '0For a similar conclusion reached on different grounds see Glock (1972:6 et passim).</page><page sequence="17">228 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS An astonishing amount of modern theology is built around the so-called 'I-Thou' relationship and similar conceptions of human relationships. But almost never do those who use human relationships as an ultimate reference (or analogy) for their theology, say what they are. 'God is love,' they say, but they do not say what 'love' is. Obviously, sociological inquiry into the nature of human relationships in general and of love, in particular, could provide some insights, albeit not definitive statements, which theologians could use the better to specify what is being said in a theistic discourse built upon conceptions of human relationships and the assertion that "God is love." Such a use of sociology would involve the development of what Berger (1969:7 1) has called "in- ductive faith;" that is, "A religious process of thought that begins with facts of human experience....' However, unlike the inductive faith which Berger describes, a theology based on metaphorical parallelism would not look for "signals of transcendence" (Berger, 1969:65), but "for signals of immanence." That is, the inductive faith suggested by metaphorical parallelism would not seek signs of a reality beyond the natural, but would seek signs of the reality within natural, social processes upon which to base its faith. The theism suggested by metaphorical parallelism could, for example, seek to deepen its comprehension of purposive forces and moral orders through the study of sociology's understanding of these phenomena. For, if metaphorical parallelism is correct, before all else, theism can be a system of ideas or symbols with which individuals represent to themselves the purposive and normative elements which are constitu- tive of the society of which they are members, and the intimate relations they have with these elements. A theism suggested by metaphorical paral- lelism would replace the anthropomorphic or "psychomorphic" analogies so long a part of Western theology with "socio-morphic" analogies such as those proposed by Buber and more recently used by Cox. In other words, metaphorical parallelism suggests that theistic discourse be based, to paraphrase Simmel (1957:339) on referents to inter-individual or social forms of life rather than to individual characteristics. A theistic discourse based on the tenet that God is better described in social relational terms than as an individual, while metaphorical and symbolic in character, need not be unfaithful to man.
