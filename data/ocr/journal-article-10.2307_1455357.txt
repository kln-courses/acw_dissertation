<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW, LXXXIV, Nos. 2-3 (October, 1993-January, 1994) 249-252 ON A NEW FRAGMENT OF THE DAMASCUS COVENANT MENAHEM KISTER, Hebrew University of Jerusalem A fragment of the Damascus Covenant from Cave 4 at Qumran deals with those who have sinned. One who has sinned unintentionally must an- nounce his transgression to "the priest appointed over the many," and he must willingly accept the punishment imposed on him by the priest as an expiation, which is regarded as a substitute for sacrifices in the defiled temple of Jerusalem (according to the sect's opinion). One who "rejects these judgments" (or: "punishments," Hebrew o)uown), on the other hand, is expelled from the sect in a speech by "the priest appointed over the many." The first procedure is an unexpected reminiscence of the Christian confession: the sinner must tell a person of superior religious authority about his sin, and the penitent willingly takes upon himself the penance instructed by the person of authority. This procedure expiates the sin as would a sacrifice.' It may well be that we have here only a parallel phe- nomenon, with no historical connection between the two procedures; this remains for experts in the development of early Christian dogma to decide.2 At Qumran, this procedure highlights the sect's entrenched hierar- chical structure, in which even forgiveness for unintentional transgressions is granted only by a person of authority.3 1 See also CD 17:19, n4vwn -rtv -rY tY' yV ' 1pn VOWn w W.] ivx OD -il Vwn) 'M nmun nn],,e o 5XIW pnxw M.

Lea, A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences (Philadel- phia, 1896), pp. 217-218 (and more generally pp. 168-217). 3 As evidence that penance substitutes for sacrifices in the defiled temple, Joel 2:13 is cited as a proof text: "rnn 5'r o:D)= wij5 , "Rend your hearts rather than your garments." See J. M. Baumgarten, "A 'Scriptural' Citation in 4Q Fragments of the Damascus Document," JJS 43 (1992): 95-98. Perhaps the proof was drawn from Joel 2:13-14, since Joel 2:14 reads: 'n5 im nmn nlDlfn rinx vxvmn onnr nw. p )n =z)n5x.

The Targum fits strikingly the whole context of the Damascus Covenant fragment (the</page><page sequence="2">250 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW The speech of the priest when expelling a member from the Sect be- gins, according to Baumgarten's reading and translation:4 51:;-1 t'v'n 5rz1:) I-1 )IN &lt;nx 11-1:1 lnR 1 s)M 3,VI On--1 5 ornv 1;3l 13-T) o;zrmnowo5 wzn[.] -11nm) -I 1WNDO- nVI'VI The priest appointed over the many shall speak and say: "Blessed are you, In )Ix of everything, in your hands is everything, who makes ev- erything. You have established nations according to their families. Baumgarten explains the words In )Ix as a substitute for the tetragrammaton, and in light of the "clear parallel" to mSuk 4.5 (x) nrin irni t)x), he argues: "Both of these are variants resulting from the ancient practice of disguising the divine name by blending it with the invocative xix." As another, less preferable possibility, he suggests that )Ix is derived from the root pix, meaning 'strength,' in the same way that -rJi is used as a divine epithet of God in Rabbinic literature. These suggestions raise difficult problems. How are we to interpret the Hebrew phrase 5;1n In nx? The word xx is not at all appropriate to the syntax and the context of the phrase, and in terms of morphology, )Ix can be hardly derived from xx. To understand it as "power" is also syntacti- cally untenable, since the translation would have to be "Power (of) YHWH of everything, and in his hands . . . " or "He is power everything [sic!]", both translations being impossible. In addition there is a lexical difficulty: lpx as a divine epithet is unattested elsewhere, as is the use of x)x as anything but an invocative. Furthermore, the spelling with the ini- tial/medial form of nun is puzzling. Indeed, other editors of the text read here In nx rather than In 31x.5 Materially, as I am informed by E. Qimron, one who has sinned unintentionally, and then "knows that he has sins"). Repentance is considered in both compositions as a substitute for sacrifices (as long as the temple is defiled, according to CD, or after its destruction, according to the Targum). Citing the beginning of a biblical verse, when the reference is to the entire verse or more, is most common in rabbinic midrash. The pseudo-biblical citation orm) nrin n'ix i5' omv[-I] ? S'x 5 nl'x ("I will get me to the end of heaven, and will not [=so as not to] smell the savor of your sweet odours"), discussed by Baumgarten in the article cited above, seems to be an anthropomorphic rhetorical formulation: God finds the scent of sacrifices so undesirable that he goes to the furthest reaches of the heavens to avoid smelling it. Thus, it seems unlikely to me that any connection is to be made between the words omwi ns;p here and the identical phrase in Deut 30:4, as Baumgarten hypothesizes.

Yet I think that the reading 52n in nx (i.e., "You are all") rather than 5xil rI1 )IN is textually much more preferable. A statement that "God is all" sounds pantheistic and certainly seems strange in a document from Qumran. A similar phrase, however, is to be found in Ben Sira 43:27 (the conclusion of God's wonders in nature): 5fx xWJ 13X ?YI H Iv i) x n5xD -tY Even more things like these (we might say) and we shall not attain the end And the conclusion of the matter is: He is all. So most translators tend to understand the verse, beginning with the Greek translation. Commentators did express surprise at this description of God in Ben Sira: "The whole context shows that the words must not be inter- preted in a pantheistic sense, though, taken alone, they might be so inter- preted. What Ben Sira meant is that God is manifest in all his works."6 While the language of this verse as it appears in Ben Sira is a bit cryptic, the Qumran fragment in question and the verse in Ben Sira can be seen to shed light on each other. We may conclude that it was acceptable during the Second Temple period to say of God "He is all" without pantheistic intent.7 The intent rather was to offer the highest praise to God's sover- eignty and presence in the universe.8 6 G. H. Box and W. 0. E. Oesterley, "Sirach," in R. H. Charles, ed., Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament (Oxford, 1913) 1:478. 7 The expression "He is all" is common in some Greek sources, especially in Stoic writings (where it has a pantheistic meaning); cf. E. Norden, Agnostos Theos, (Leipzig, 1913), pp. 240-250. Cf. E. E. Urbach, The Sages: Their Concepts and Be- liefs (Jerusalem, 1975) 2:716, n. 38 [=Hebrew, p. 62, n. 38]. 8 Needless to say, according to this reading there is no connection between the Damascus Covenant and vri )x in mishnah Sukkah.</page></plain_text>
