Depart- ment of Anthropology, National Commission of the Academy of Sci- ences, Havana 1964 Despite - or maybe because of - Fidel Castro, good and well printed archaeological publications are com- ing out of Cuba. The present one is a monograph on Antillean stone axes or celts, studied and described in considerable detail and illus- trated with photographic plates of many typical plain celts, and draw- ings of various kinds of axes. In reaching his conclusions the author, who published his first work on West Indian stone axes in 1938, studied 646 plain celts from Cuba and Santo Domingo. Antillean stone axes fall into three types: petaloid, rectangular and flat notched or grooved; the first two would generally be con- sidered as celts. Rectangular celts are of an early period, and rare in the Greater Antilles; the flat axes are also earlier and of irregular distribution. The typical ax of the later periods was the petaloid celt, to which the author gives greater attention. The nature, purpose or use, ma- terial, shape and dimensions, dis- tribution and many other details regarding the three types of axes are discussed, as well as such mat- ters as the relation between burins and the petaloid celt with its sharp point. The length-width and width- thickness proportions of all the petaloid celts were studied and the results shown in three tables or charts. An apparently full bibliography is a welcome professional touch, as is the full information on the eighty-three unusual stone speci- mens shown in the plates, including plain and anthropomorphic celts and axes, and monolithic axes.
