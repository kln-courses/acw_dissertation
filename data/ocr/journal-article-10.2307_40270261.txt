For these thinkers, the doctrine represents a form of agency that does violence to various forms of alterity. While broadly supportive of their fundamental philosophical and ethico-political views, especially about the primordiality of alterity, I differ from them in that I argue that creation ex nihilo articulates the very structure of the alterity they are concerned with. The essay proceeds through a reading of Derrida's representation of the doctrine and a "deconstruction" of his view by means of a reading of Augustine and Anselm. Keywords Derrida, Jacques • Creation ex nihilo • Deconstruction • Augustine • Anselm • Caputo, John • Keller, Catherine Introduction There has been much written recently in the area that some call the continental phi- losophy of religion challenging the foundational Abrahamic doctrine of creation ex nihilo. This challenge has been posed most profoundly by those associated with decon- struction, such as John Caputo, Catherine Keller and, of course, Jacques Derrida. In large part, this interest has been sparked by what has been perceived to be the impli- cations in Euro- American culture, at both the individual and the collective levels, of the Abrahamic idea of God's omnipotence. Divine omnipotence is said - with some M.

Keller, for instance, uncovers a "cluster of signifiers" linked to the doctrines of divine omnip- otence and creation ex nihilo, which include those "of masculine supremacy, of female abjection and of unilateral domination" (Keller 2003, p. 53). 1 Similarly, Caputo, who draws much inspiration from both Derrida and Keller, argues that the doctrines bear the mark of an "idealizing, epistemological, and psychoanalytic fantasy," nurturing the dream for divine violence on one's enemies and breeding a resignation in the face of human suffering (Caputo 2006, pp. 78-80). With such understandings of the doc- trines, it is not surprising that many thinkers have urgently sought a way to conceive of a notion of divinity that is not omnipotent, and therefore a notion of agency that is not that described in the doctrine of creation ex nihilo. While I am sympathetic with the concerns these authors raise about the potential dangers of particular understandings of creation ex nihilo, and while I am especially sympathetic to the more general deconstructive thesis about the irreducibility of differ- ence, I shall in the following paper challenge the deconstruction of creation ex nihilo initiated by Derrida and developed further by Keller and Caputo. This is not to say that I shall simply make the case for abandoning deconstruction in a reversion back to a pre-deconstructive conception of creation ex nihilo. Rather, I shall attempt to show that Derrida's understanding of creation ex nihilo is unsatisfactory because it fails to appreciate how a rigorous conception of creation ex nihilo is already in itself decon- structive. Recognizing this link between creation ex nihilo and deconstruction allows a further insight into the natures of both deconstruction and agency. For if the doctrine of creation ex nihilo describes an agency which is already in itself deconstructive, then deconstruction does not simply operate outside a domain of agency but would rather operate within the domain of a particular conception of agency, specifically that artic- ulated in the doctrine of creation ex nihilo. Deconstruction could then be conceived as agential and creative, while creation could be seen to be deconstructive. To defend these claims, I shall proceed, first, by discussing the links between Derrida's conception of invention and creation ex nihilo, and by then highlighting the deconstructive elements already contained in the articulation of creation ex nihilo by Augustine and Anselm. 1 I am grateful to one of the reviewers for raising the question of a possible non sequitur here. However, I do not think Keller actually commits one. She is not arguing that, because masculine supremacy and female abjection is bad in human beings, it is therefore bad in God, which is a non sequitur. She is arguing that the conception of God as masculine, powerful, supreme, and domineering has encouraged the conception of human relations and human agency in those terms (which 15 bad), while, conversely, the conception of God in those anthropomorphic terms is based on, or conceived in, the image of a conception of human agency and human relations that is masculinist, hierarchical, and domineering (which is bad for numerous reasons).

With one exception, which I shall con- sider shortly, his usual approach is to present it as the paradigm of what he calls a "logocentric" subjective agency and then to re-conceive the genesis and structure of experience through a deconstructive framework. The depiction of creation as logo- centric is especially evident in his early work, where Derrida was concerned to show how the Western tradition privileged whatever was identified with the interiority of the subject (self-presence, consciousness, reason, voice) over anything that was cor- respondingly deemed external (absence, body or unconsciousness, myth or emotion, writing). Nowhere were these deadly sins more evident than in the doctrine of crea- tion ex nihilo, a text about which Derrida never actually provided a reading, perhaps suggesting that he took the meaning of the doctrine to be obvious. At any rate, accord- ing to him, the omnipotent God who creates ex nihilo is a being whose autonomous, unconditional agency makes it a singular One, self-present to and so self-identical with itself, causally and chronologically prior to the creation and creatures it creates which are thus external to itself, and thus superior to them as they are inferior to it. Drawing a link between this theology and logocentricism, he writes in Of Grammatology that, The epoch of logos. . .debases writing considered as. . .a fall into the exteriority of meaning.... The difference between signified and signifier [i.e., writing - the exterior] belongs in a profound and implicit way to the totality of the great epoch covered by the history of metaphysics, and in a more explicit and more systematically articulated way to the narrower epoch of Christian creationism and infinitism where these appropriate the resources of Greek conceptuality. (Derrida 1974, p. 13; emphasis added) In place of logocentric creationism, Derrida provides throughout his oeuvre an alter- nate account of the origin of experience and meaning - what he says in the much later "Sauf le nom" is in fact a "reconception of the current concept of creation" (Derrida 1995, p. 73) - by shifting attention away from the power and autonomy of the subject to the force and play of alterity within a text or context, a conception summarized in his well-known early notion of dijférance} The link between Derrida's own conception of experience and meaning and the traditional concept of creation is taken up most directly by him in his analysis of the concept of invention in "Psyche: Inventions of the Other" and in his various analyses of the related concepts of the event and the gift. He enlists the concept of invention because the Latin word inventio economically captures the two sides of the struc- ture he wants to articulate. On one side, there are inventions two conventional Latin meanings of (I) finding or discovering within the already existent, and (2) devising out of the already existent. These two related meanings are bound to the well-known Greco-Roman axiom that nothing comes from nothing, which was, in the early his- tory of the doctrine of creation ex nihilo, often cited by Greek and Roman authors in 2 See Derrida (1982). A still very good philosophical discussion of dijférance can be found in Gasché (1986), Chap. 9. â Springer</page><page sequence="4">18 Int J Philos Relig (2009) 66: 15-32 opposition to Jewish and Christian proclamations about creation. Indeed, it was in this encounter that the now classic distinction between invention and creation first came to be articulated and which Derrida retrieves for his analysis. Explaining the Latin meaning of invention, Derrida writes that the invention either "[1] discovers for the first time, it unveils what was already found there, or [2] produces what, as tekhnè, was not already found there but is still not created, in the strong sense of the word, is only put together, starting with a stock of existing and available elements, in a given configuration" (Derrida 1989, p. 43; emphasis added). Summarizing the difference between invention and creation, he writes that "invention does not create an existence or a world as a set of existents, it does not have the theological meaning of a veritable creation of existence ex nihilo" (Ibid., p. 43). Invention uses what is already available in the world, and so is undertaken within the already existent world, whereas crea- tion, acting out of nothing, would claim to bring into existence the very world within which inventions would take place. Creation, in other words, claims to escape the play of differences that, according to Derrida, constitute any context, whereas invention does not. That an invention comes to be within a context, however, does not mean for Derrida that it is simply reducible to it. An invention that simply and purely repeated what was already in the world would not, in fact, invent anything new but would instead be conventional or what Derrida calls an "invention of the same" (Derrida 1989, pp. 55- 56). It is here that Derrida uncovers in inventions etymology a third, non-conventional meaning: in-coming. A true invention or event, Derrida argues, must bring something new into its context, something other than what existed already, and so an invention is an incoming of the other. Derrida stipulates, however, that for the other to be truly other its coming cannot be pre-determined, conditioned, or calculated on the basis of what already exists, since then it would not really be other. The other, and therefore the invention, must "break with conventions" (Ibid., p. 41). As breaking with con- ventions, with what is, the other's coming, in a quasi-causa sui, is conditioned upon nothing other than itself, even if, as Derrida argues throughout the late Rogues, it is not therein wholly in possession of itself, not wholly sovereign.3 It is here where we will be able to discern a certain proximity between Derridean invention and the doctrine of creation ex nihilo. The proximity is evident when Derrida writes in Given Time about the gift and the event, which are related to invention, that The gift, like the event, as event, must remain unforeseeable, but remain so without keeping itself. ... [A] gift or event that would be foreseeable, necessary, conditioned, programmed, expected, counted on would not be lived as either a gift or as an event. . . . That is why the condition common to the gift and the event is a certain unconditionality. ...The gift and the event obey nothing.... In any case, if the gift or the event, if the event of the gift must remain unexplainable by a system of efficient causes, it is the effect of nothing.... (Derrida 1991, pp. 122-23; emphasis added) 3 See Caputo (2003). ^ Springer</page><page sequence="5">Int J Philos Relig (2009) 66: 15-32 19 There are many, many other passages throughout Derrida's corpus that could be cited here that would all reinforce the idea presented in this passage that the other comes out of nothing, from as early as 1963s "Force and Signification" to as late as the 1994 "Villanova Roundtable."4 When Derrida's reconception of experience is framed this way - which, I underscore, is not far from Derrida's own way of framing it - Derridean invention begins to bear a certain resemblance to creation ex nihilo. So that you do not think I exaggerate this resemblance, however, I shall turn now to Derrida's sole clearly favourable presentation of creation ex nihilo as further justification for this interpretation. In an earlier essay, entitled "What I Would Have Said...," written in response to a 1983 conference session entitled "Creation and Changing Society," Derrida brings together, almost indistinguishably close, his notion of the event or invention, on the one hand, and creation ex nihilo, on the other. Reacting to the dearth of attention paid at the conference to the theological heritage of the concept of creation, Derrida rightfully insists that, even without simply adopting a religious standpoint, one must consider the theological meanings of creation, of which Derrida specifies two. First, as the theological dimension of creation would make evident, "whether or not one retains its expressly theological value," every notion of creation should "make secondary, or minoritize, anything that is merely transformation or technological implementation, indeed production, anything that is not pure creation, and thus all the conditions (socio- economic, institutional, techno-scientific, etc.), indeed the supporting structures - the most novel as well as the most ancient - of so-called creation" (Derrida 2002a, p. 60). Recalling the theology of creation without necessarily subscribing to it, creation must be distinguished from the mere innovation that transpires within the contexts of industrial capitalist culture, in which products are produced calculatively on the basis of socio-economic, institutional, and techno-scientific conditions. Following this first consequence, Derrida adds that, secondly, "what one wants to call creation would not be programmed" and that "what seems to spring up ex nihilo, naturally, with genius - the rupture, the unforeseeable, surprise, irruption, mutation, in short, the future, the coming of the future in its most unruly aspect - ought to remove the said creation from any program" and should not be "representable" (Ibid., pp. 60-61). Without under- estimating the importance of the dissociation of the theological meaning of creation from modern notions of creation, creation ex nihilo has here for Derrida, although he does not say so, virtually the same structure as what he elsewhere calls the event or invention. That which is created ex nihilo, he says, is that which is, unforeseeably and without anticipation, rule or program, to come, and which, as un-representable, cannot be made present, just as is the case of the event. Despite what he will say only 6 years later in "Psyche," here Derrida configures creation ex nihilo and invention as very close indeed. If we turn back to "Psyche," we can see that Derrida himself would appear to reg- ister and then suppress this proximity between his conception of invention {not the Greco-Roman conception) and the conception of creation presented in the theological doctrine. It occurs appropriately in a footnote - and thus below the threshold of the 4 See the following: "Force and Signification" in Derrida ( 1 978a), p. 8 ; "Cogito and the History of Madness" in Derrida (1978a), p. 56; Derrida (1978b), p. 29; Derrida (1995), p. 99; Derrida (1997), p. 27. £) Springer</page><page sequence="6">20 Int J Philos Relig (2009) 66: 15-32 text proper - appended to a paragraph about why invention is not creation, in support of which Derrida cites Kant's treatment of invention and creativity in his Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View. When Derrida proceeds to comment on the citation, he strangely misreads it, reading it in support of his own pro-invention/anti-creation position even though the passage actually identifies invention and creation. Here, at length, is the passage from Kant that Derrida cites: Invention (erfinden) is quite different from discovery (entdecken). When we say that someone discovered a thing, we mean that it already existed beforehand: it was just not well-known - for example, America [existed but was not known] before Columbus. But when someone invents a thing - gunpowder, for exam- ple - that thing was not known at all before the artist who made it. Both of these [discovery and invention] can be meritorious. But we can find something we were not looking for (as the alchemists discovered phosphor), and there is no merit at all in such discovery. - Talent for inventing things is called genius. But we apply this term only to artists (KUnstler), and so to people who know how to make things, not to those who merely have experiential and scientific knowledge of many things. Moreover, we do not apply it to mere imitators: we reserve it for artists who are disposed to produce their works originally, and finally, for them only when their work is exemplary - that is, when it serves as a model (Beispiel) (exemplar) to be imitated. So a man's genius is "the exemplary originality of his talent" ( die musterhafte Originalitât seines Talents) (with respect to this or that kind of artistic work [Kunstproducten]). We also call a mind with this ability a genius, in which case the term refers not merely to a person's natural talent (Naturegabe) but also to the person himself. A man who is a genius in many fields is a vast genius (like Leonardo de Vinci)" (Derrida 1989, n. 14, 63; emphasis Derrida's).5 We should observe, first of all, that where, for the Romans, invention means dis- covery, for the modern Kant, invention is precisely not discovery. In his hurried gloss of this passage, Derrida fails to take note of this fact and its role in the rest of passage. Instead, he begins by declaring that the artist who can create is not the inventor who cannot create: he writes that, "the word 'creator' here does not designate someone who produces an existence ex nihilo; it is not the inventor who can do that [i.e. produce an existence ex nihilo], as we have stressed, but rather the artist (Kunstler)" (ibid.). Yet, in the above passage, Kant clearly calls the inventor an artist: "when someone invents a thing... that thing was not known at all before the artist who made it" (emphasis added). The inventor here is an artist, which is also why the word "genius," defined by Kant above as a "talent for inventing things," is applicable, Kant says, only to the artist. While Kant does immediately after this association of inventor and artist distinguish the genius from the scientist who merely knows things (here one would have to recall Kant's very specific sense of knowledge as merely theoretical and not practical or imaginative), Derrida hastily assumes that this means that the inventor is a scientist and not an artist. In fact, as we learn more explicitly from the Critique of Judgement, 5 For the reference in Kant, see Kant (2006), Sect. 57, pp. 1 19-120. £) Springer</page><page sequence="7">Int J Philos Relig (2009) 66:15-32 21 to which Derrida has devoted several works, the scientist is a discoverer, from which, I noted, Kant above distinguished invention.6 Kant, as in his reference to Leonardo, the paradigmatic Renaissance man well-known as both inventor and artist, does not make Derrida's assumption that the inventor is a scientist and not an artist. Therefore, given that, for Kant, the inventor is the artist who makes what was "not known at all before" - that is, what did not exist at all before, since, if it existed before but was merely unknown, Kant would call that discovery - then for Kant the inventor-artist does have something of the creator ex nihilo about him or her. Why does Derrida misread Kant here? No one can say for sure, of course, but it would seem at the very least that Derrida hears something in Kant's analysis of inven- tion that resonates with his own. More specifically, I would say that Derrida finds in Kant a kindred conception of invention, kindred because, like his own, Kant's con- ception of invention is not simply a finding within or a devising out of the already existent, but is the invention of something that did not exist before. Kant's conception of invention is a conception of creation re-baptised under a secular name. This sec- ular name is more palatable to Derrida and allows him to maintain his advocacy of invention even while actually defending a conception of creation. What the whole analysis in this section reveals is that Derrida tacitly recognizes that the Roman conception of inventio, bound to the axiom that nothing comes from noth- ing, is not consistent with his deconstructive understanding of the genesis and structure of experience, in which the other - precisely as other, as not part of the sameness of what is - comes from nothing. In fact, his deconstruction of the meaning of inventio appeals to and relies on a structure which he himself (somewhat) recognizes is part of the doctrine of creation ex nihilo, but from which he still, ultimately, wants to distance himself. This desire stems, as we said, from what he perceives to be the denial of difference in the doctrine's emphasis on God's singularity and omnipotence. We must now determine whether Derrida and other practitioners of deconstruction need to be worried about this denial in the first place. The auto-deconstruction of creation ex nihilo in Augustine and Anselm If in his own articulation of his own deconstructive position Derrida has ended up very close to, if not in full support of, the doctrine from which he is attempting to distance himself, then it would seem likely that the doctrine of creation ex nihilo possesses something deconstructive about it. Caputo perceives such a link when he acknowl- edges that, even though in his judgment "[a]bsolute omnipotence is a religious and metaphysical fantasy," it nevertheless "contains and displaces a powerful core truth, which is that by 'God' we mean the possibility of the impossible." The latter phrase is a kind of code or shibboleth for both Caputo and Derrida that signifies a "faith in the transformability of things, in the most improbable and impossible things, so that life is never closed in, the future never closed off, the horizon never finite and confining" (Caputo 2006, pp. 87-88). Catherine Keller, too, who describes her project in Face of the Deep as making a "deconstructive movement" and incorporating "deconstructive 6 See Kant (1987), Sect. 47 on why Newton is a discoverer but not an artist. £} Springer</page><page sequence="8">22 Int J Philos Relig (2009) 66:15-32 strategies," still recognizes something of value in the doctrine (Keller 2003, p. 6 and 161). For, as she explains, even though the doctrine problematically "decorporeal- izes" God and so "nihilates" matter from creativity, it nevertheless ends up affirm- ing materiality, in contrast to certain Greco-Roman and Gnostic cosmologies (Ibid., p. 50). What Keller is referring to here is the fact that in the early emerging "orthodox" Christian cosmologies matter was fundamentally understood to be good because God created it (as Augustine explicitly argues), whereas in the ancient traditions stemming from Socrates matter was typically disparaged. What is the relationship, then, between the various aspects of creation ex nihilo perceived positively by Derrida, Caputo, and Keller and the doctrine itself? Can the positive aspects simply be extracted from the doctrine and still be functional and mean- ingful? For instance, can we dream with Derrida of the coming of a radical other if this other's coming is not ex nihilo? Can we dream with Caputo about impossible transformations of the status quo without the transformative force being reducible to nothing in the status quo and therefore coming out of nothing in general? And can we dream with Keller of "distinguishing] the matter-affirming intention of the ex nihilo from," what she perceives to be, "its own matter-nihilating dualism" (Ibid., p. 50)? In order to answer these questions I want to consider the analyses of the doctrine by Augustine and Anselm, who together provide what I think is the most rigorous analysis of the doctrine and in doing so in fact thematize what we can identify as deconstructive theses and a deconstructive logic. By way of introduction to their analysis, however, let me first address Keller's objections, as my response to her will lead in nicely to a discussion of Augustine and Anselm. As was indicated above, in her deconstruction of creation ex nihilo Keller wants to preserve from the doctrine its ultimate affirmation of materiality, while rejecting its decorporealization of God and agency. To do so, she enlists the help of the Gnostic cosmology of the Valentinians,7 which while ultimately disparaging materiality, nev- ertheless conceives some of its divinities in relationship to materiality, something she very much supports. In adopting this strategy, however, Keller has landed in a very peculiar position, for she has now recognized - even if she does not self-consciously formulate the problem this way - that creation ex nihilo conceives God's activity as irreducible to materiality but ends up affirming it, while Valentinianism establishes a continuity between divinity and materiality but ends up devaluing it. Given the nearly perfect inversion of these two positions, one cannot help but wonder whether there is not a connection between their respective conceptions of divinity and their respective valuations of materiality. One cannot help but wonder, that is, whether the doctrine of creation ex nihilo does not affirm matter precisely because it understands God's agency as acting ex nihilo?8 7 One must tread carefully when discussing "the Gnostics," mostly because it is not clear who or what is being referred to; on this point, see King (2003). For a description of the Valentinian cosmology as it relates to the question of creation, see May (1994), pp. 85-1 17. 8 Caputo, too, inspired here by Keller, takes up the affirmation of matter in distinction to Gnostic traditions of denigrating it, except that he does not address that creation ex nihilo affirms matter. See Caputo (2006), pp. 80-81. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="9">Int J Philos Relig (2009) 66: 15-32 23 To answer this question, let us first ask what is involved in affirming something. In an affirmation, a force of affirmation affirms - firms up, bolsters, or ratifies - some- thing other (let us call it an "affirmée")- As such, an affirmation includes two distinct but interconnected moments. First, the force of affirmation and the affirmée must be distinct from or other than one another, since the force of affirmation, as a ratification, must add to the affirmée and so must come to the affirmée from beyond it. Indeed, to put it in a Derridean manner, a ratification is a countersignature, the saying of a second and distinct "yes" to a prior "yes." If the force of affirmation belonged already to the affirmée, as in an atomistic act of egoistic self-congratulation, then there would be no affirmation; there would be, instead, an entrenchment of self. The force of affirmation, therefore, must be irreducible to the affirmée. Second, the affirmation must be decisively directed at the affirmée: it must deci- sively affirm precisely this or precisely that. If the "affirmation" comes to the affirmée as an accident or by-product, and thus as the result of some other unknown cause, then it is not an affirmation. The only true source of affirmation, therefore, is affirmation itself, which is to say it has no source (no cause). An affirmation comes out of nothing other than affirmation; prior to it, nothing can explain it. As Derrida says in agreement, "nothing precedes the 'yes'" (Derrida 1997, p. 27). The Valentinian cosmology violates both of these stipulations. In it, there is no radical separation between divinity and matter, and matter is produced precisely as a by-product. If, on the other hand, matter is affirmed by the doctrine of creation ex nihilo - which it is, since God intentionally makes a material creation - then that is precisely because God's affirmation of matter, and thus God's agency itself, cannot be continuous with it. There must be a break or a gap between God and that which God creates, which is to say that God's agency must be independent of and uncon- ditioned by that which it affirms (even if, as I will argue momentarily, it is precisely this unconditionally and independence which binds God from the beginning to the material creature). It is this break, gap, independence and unconditionality which the ex nihilo thematizes. The affirmation of materiality, therefore, cannot be separated, as Keller hopes to do, from the irreducibility of God's agency without sacrificing the affirmation itself.9 Either God acts ex nihilo and thereby affirms matter, or God does not act ex nihilo and thereby cannot affirm matter. Now, if God's agency is irreducible to materiality, as I have argued here, this con- clusion does not mean that God is, as in the metaphysical fantasy identified by Caputo, somehow divorced from the material world. It is true that in many of the major the- orists of the doctrine, from Irenaeus to Aquinas, God is often conceived as a first cause divorced from the material world. But if one listens closely to the best anal- yses of the doctrine, one can hear in them a logic which undermines - and, in fact, 9 Since both Keller and Caputo appeal to the biblical book of Genesis to warrant their deconstructions of the theological doctrine, it may be worthwhile here to appeal to the remarkable analysis of the body and materiality in the Bible undertaken by Elaine Scarry. Consistent with my claims about the God of creation ex nihilo, Scarry argues about the God of the Bible that it is represented as a pure, immaterial voice, but one whose agency "seeks its confirmation in a visible change in the realm of matter" (Scarry 1985, p. 193). £) Springer</page><page sequence="10">24 Int J Philos Relig (2009) 66: 1 5-32 deconstructs - such a conception.10 This deconstruction, I contend, is not the betrayal of the doctrine or even of orthodoxy, but its true expression. If what I am suggesting has not been expressed in the theological heritage, it is not because the logic of the concept of the ex nihilo does not warrant it, in my judgment, but because theologians and philosophers have failed to own up to it. Let us listen in, then, on the analyses of Augustine and Anselm. Augustine's numerous analyses of creation ex nihilo all anchor themselves in a discussion of space and time. Because God is asserted to have made all of heaven and earth, which represent for Augustine all spatio-material reality, God is understood by Augustine to have made space itself. But if God makes space itself, then, as Augustine writes, "the way, God, in which you made heaven and earth was not that you made them either in heaven or on earth.... There was nowhere for it to be made before it was brought into existence" (Augustine 1991, XI.v.7). If there was no space prior to creation, then not only was space not made in space, but it was also not made spa- tially, that is, in accordance with what he identifies as the logic of succession which governs space. This inference, however, raises a difficult problem which Augustine is not fully ready to own up to, for if God creates space and therefore the logic of spatial succession, then God cannot exist simply outside of space, since "outside" is itself a spatial relationship. So, then, where is God? Before venturing an answer to this question, let us first consider Augustine's anal- ysis of time, which he analyses according to the same logic. After acknowledging that creation ex nihilo would stipulate that "You [God] have made time itself," Augustine correctly infers that "Time could not elapse before you [God] made time" (Augustine 1991, XI.xiii.15).11 If time did not elapse before God made time, then it was not elapsing during it either, and if God thus does not create according to time, then God's relationship to time cannot be accounted for by means of it. If God does not have a temporal relationship to time, then God is not simply before time, since "before" is a temporal concept. As Augustine himself concludes, "It is not in time that you [God] precede times [sic]" (Augustine 1991, XI.xiii.15). Just as God is not outside space, so he is not before time. Given these two axioms of creation ex nihilo - that God is not outside space and that God is not before time - where does this leave God? To answer this question we must temporarily depart from Augustine, who does not quite own up to the implication of his own analysis here, and turn instead to his great reader, Anselm, who does appear willing to follow the logic through to its end. In the Monologion Anselm discovers what he calls there the "contradictory language - but ineluctable logic" of God's rela- tionship to time and space within creation ex nihilo (Anselm of Canterbury 1998, Sect. 10 Keller herself recognizes that in Irenaeus' polemic against the Valentinians he undertakes "something very like a deconstruction," specifying that he "deconstructs a certain neo-platonic idealism" present in the Gnostics (Keller 2003, p. 51). 1 1 Here I think Caputo's claim that God does not create time but exists in time like the rest of us is too simple (Caputo 2006, p. 85, 87), for I'm not sure that the rest of us simply exist in time either. As Caputo knows, a long tradition of thinking about time, including Augustine, Kant, Husserl, Heidegger, Levinas, and even Derrida, have noted that we are not simply in time construed as a metaphysics of presence. It may be that God is in time and out of time in precisely the same way in which we are - or perhaps, if one prefers, in an exemplary way. £} Springer</page><page sequence="11">Int J Philos Relig (2009) 66: 15-32 25 22). After explaining, as Augustine did, that time and space operate according to the law of non-contradiction, he explains that what is enclosed within its logic cannot exist "as a whole in more than one place simultaneously. But," he goes on, "as for what the long arm of space and time law does not encircle," namely, God, "this is neither condemned to the multiplicity of having parts, nor prohibited from being present as a whole in more than one place and time simultaneously" (Ibid.). Because God is not reducible to the logic of time and space, and so is not confined to being before time and outside space, God is actually not prohibited from being in time and space. On the contrary, God is, according to Anselm, "in every place and time" (Ibid.). However, recognizing that the creator of time and space cannot be reducible to them, lest one fall into pantheism, he reasons that God is not in space and time the way a space and a time are: the meaning of "in," he says with precision, "is different in each case" (Ibid.). For spatial and temporal things, "in" signifies that they operate, to put it in Heidegge- rian terms, according to a metaphysics of presence. In the case of God, however, "in" refers to the fact that God has a relationship to every time and place, without being reducible to them. He writes, "if ordinary usage allowed it, it would seem to be more appropriate to say that the supreme essence [God] is with rather than in a place and time. ('In' having more of a sense of 'being contained by' than 'with')" (Ibid.). Par- adoxically, then, the very logic of God's irreducibility to time and space requires that God be with time and space. The end result of the logic of creation ex nihilo, therefore, is that the creator is with creation. What are the implications of this logic for thinking about the creator's relationship to human creatures? Returning again to Augustine, we find that more than God simply being with time and space, the implications of Augustine's analysis is that God's crea- tures are actually with God. The problem is raised dramatically in Bk. XII of the City of God when Augustine is attempting to think through the vexed question of whether God has always been Lord. Since the concept of Lord is dialectically bound to a ser- vant, it would seem that if God has always been Lord, then he must always have had a creature under his dominion who would thus be co-eternal with him - a thesis which Augustine understandably believes would contradict the basic tenets of the doctrine. His solution, about which he admits he does not feel confident,12 is actually to deny that God has been Lord for eternity, asserting instead that he only becomes Lord with the creation of time. But God is granted the title Lord precisely because he is the sole creator, and creativity, Augustine recognizes, cannot be denied to God's eternity the way Lordship can, since it is part of his very essence. The problem now emerges that, if God is thus always creator, must he not always have had a creature? Augustine is too astute not to recognize the problem, which is why in the final Book of the City of God he struggles, ultimately without success, to find a way to maintain creativity as part of God's essence without this suggesting that there is a co-eternal creature. His solution is to argue that, before creation, in God's tunelessly eternal will, he merely "prepares" (prae-parare, make ready in advance) events that will only later, in time, "come to pass." The problem with this solution, of course, is that it is itself clearly being conceived according to linear, chronological time 12 See Augustine (1993), XII.15. 4y Springer</page><page sequence="12">26 Int J Philos Relig (2009) 66: 15-32 (prior preparation, later creation), which Augustine's analysis of the creation of time ex nihilo has already shown us is inconsistent with the logic of the doctrine. God can- not prepare his creation before actually making it, because then he is already within time and did not make the latter. Augustine's attempt to maintain God alone without his creatures thus fails. What his failure helps to illuminate for us, however, is the startling dichotomy that God must either create ex nihilo, in which case his existence cannot be separated from a creature's, or exist alone prior to creation, in which case he cannot create ex nihilo. It cannot be both ways: God cannot both create ex nihilo and exist alone before creation.13 It is here that the deconstructive dimensions of the doctrine begin to emerge. For if the God who creates ex nihilo is a God who is thereby bound to his or her creature, then this God is in some way dependent on and conditioned by that creature. Meister Eckhart discerned something like this point in the God-creature relationship when he wrote, in a sentence quoted affirmatively by the early Derrida, that "God becomes God when creation says God."14 Just as this claim simultaneously maintains both that God's being God is dependent on the activity of the creature and that the creature is nevertheless still a creature of that same God, so in my claiming that God is dependent on and conditioned by the creature I am in no way denying my earlier claim that the ex nihilo articulates God's independence and unconditionality. On the contrary, we see here that God can be independent and unconditioned only with a creature, a creature who is thus a condition of its own creator's independence and unconditionality.15 Unconditioning We can better understand what is meant by this paradox in which the creature is a con- dition of its unconditioned creator if we clarify what is meant by claiming that God is unconditioned in the first place. To be unconditioned does not mean uncaused in the manner of Aquinas' First Cause, based as the latter is on Aristotle's unmoved mover. A cause, even one that is asserted to be uncaused, is still causal and therefore operates according to the logic of succession (which is why Aquinas' and Aristotle's arguments are unconvincing). The analyses of Augustine and Anselm above showed us that the God who creates ex nihilo cannot be located within such a logic. That means that not only is God not caused, but that God cannot be a cause either, and if God cannot be a cause, then what God creates is necessarily not an effect. The relationship between creator and creature in the doctrine, therefore, is not that of cause to effect. Because the relationship between creator and creature is non-causal, we are not confined to thinking of the direction of influence between creator and creature as uni- directional, as going from the former to the latter. So in what way can the creature be a condition of the creator? In some way the answer is quite simple and already anticipated in what we found in Augustine and Anselm. In order for God to be an 13 C.f.

Because causes are causes only in relation to an effect, then if God is not a cause but still must have a relationship to another - which, as a creator of another, God must - then God can only not be a cause in relation to a being who is not an effect. The creator must be in relationship to another, but another who must not be an effect, who must not simply follow from or be derived from the creator. As such, there is something about the nature of this other - the human creature - that enables God to be an unconditioned creator. Without this creature that is not an effect, God would be a cause rather than a creator and therefore would be merely a conditioned condition. But because this creature is not an effect, its existence is not simply attributable to the creator, at least not in a causal manner. The creature, therefore, must have some independence of its own, some unconditionality. Yet, in describing the creator as the creator of the creature, we are clearly claiming in some way that something about its existence is attributable to the creator. In what way, then, is the creature and its unconditionality dependent on the creator and its uncondition- ality? And how does this help further illuminate how the creator is dependent on the creature? Because God is not a cause, we must not understand God's unconditioned actions to produce conditioned effects, if by conditioned we mean caused or determined. On the contrary, because the creature is "conditioned" by the unconditioned - by something which is not properly determining even if it is intending - it follows that the creature, too, is unconditioned. Even more precisely we can say that, if the unconditioned cre- ator creates the creature, then this claim can only mean that the creator unconditions the creature, renders the creature unconditioned. Creating is an unconditioning. As created, which is to say as unconditioned, the creature's actions are unmoored from the chain of conditioned and conditioning conditions, broken free from the determin- ism which accompanies that system of thinking. In short, as created, the creature is rendered free. Here we see that creation ex nihilo is a way to conceive the world as grounded in freedom. This point was recognized by Kant more clearly than anyone. For Kant, creation is a matter of accounting for the origin not of the phenomenal world, an account of which would end in antinomy, but of the noumenal world of practice, freedom, and ethics. He writes in the Critique of Practical Reason that, If existence in time is merely a sensible mode of presentation belonging to thinking beings in the world, and consequently does not concern them as things in themselves, the creation of these beings is a creation of things in themselves, because the concept of creation does not belong to the sensible mode of conceiv- ing of existence or causality but can be referred only to noumena. Consequently, if I say of beings in the world of sense that they are created, I regard them only as noumena. Just as it would therefore be contradictory to say God is the creator of appearances, it is also a contradiction to say that He, as the creator, is the cause of actions in the world of sense, as these are appearances; yet at the same time He is the cause of the existence of the acting beings (as noumena). (Kant 1993, Bk. I, Chap. 3, p. 107) It is precisely this association of creation with freedom, and in Kant's case with the autonomy of the subject that goes with them, that prompts Derrida and Caputo to accompany their deconstructions of creation with an attempt to conceive of what â Springer</page><page sequence="14">28 Int J Philos Relig (2009) 66: 15-32 they call an unconditional! ty without autonomy and sovereignty. "Autonomy," Caputo writes, "means answering only to a law {nomos) that you give yourself {autos), which is the only way to be 'rational' for Kant, which means not to allow your reason to be overwhelmed by an alien power. That model," he goes on, "is the secularized cousin of a theological image of God Almighty, the brightest light, the most autonomous agent, and the most serene and sovereign freedom of all" (Caputo 2003, p. 10). 16 The almighty God who creates out of nothing and the autonomous free agent are, in Derrida's and Caputo's estimation, both closed circles that deny the in-coming of any alterity. But is the model of unconditionality that we have uncovered in the doctrine of creation ex nihilo so easily reducible to this representation? It seems to me that in referring to the creature as unconditioned we could develop a link to the concept of autonomy, but the autonomy conceived thereby would clearly be one that comes from the other (God) and so be conceptually indissociable from it. For the creation-claim says, in effect, that the other makes one autonomous, autonomizes the self, and therefore that one cannot be autonomous alone or autonomously. Indeed, in his discussion of the fall of Adam and Eve, Augustine explicitly argues, using proto- Kantian language, that a good or bad will can exist "only in a nature created out of nothing."17 Were we simply derived from, and so reducible to, nature and causality, our actions would not be free, and therefore any good or bad action "we" commit- ted would not be attributable to us. Our freedom and responsibility requires that we conceive our actions as not wholly conditioned by natural causality. God, and the ex nihilo by which he breaks from natural causality, is our break from natural causal- ity; God is our unconditionality. The importance of the other here, however, does not de-legitimate the reference to our autonomy or unconditionality, as Derrida, Caputo, and Keller might try to argue. It is best to say what I said earlier: God unconditions us, makes us unconditioned. This formulation captures how, in being created by God, we become - in one sense - the cause of our own actions (causa sui),18 but - in another sense - are such only in relation to the alterity of God. Some practitioners of deconstruction will no doubt find the link being forged here between alterity and autonomy within creation ex nihilo to be problematic. It may help to allay their worries, however, if we call upon the authority of Levinas, who is often a source of inspiration for both Derrida and Caputo. Indeed, it is noteworthy that in their respective deconstructions of creation Derrida and Caputo are both silent about Levinas' numerous and regular references to the doctrine.19 In fact, in Totality and Infinity creation ex nihilo represents for Levinas the preeminent way to articulate the 16 For Derrida's discussion of unconditionality without sovereignty, see, "The University Without Condi- tion" in Derrida (2002b), as well as Derrida (2005a), pp. 41-42 and 44. 17 Augustine 1993, Bk. XIV, Chap. 11, p. 457, my emphasis; see also Bk. XIV, Chap. 13. 18 One should not construe this reference to causa sui as falling back into causality. When Descartes intro- duces the concept of the causa sui to describe God in his Replies to the Objections to the Meditations, he explains that the concept of the causa sui completely disrupts the logic of efficient causality. See the "First Set of Replies," AT 108-1 1 1, in Descartes (1984), pp. 78-80. 19 Caputo makes references to Levinas throughout The Weakness of God, but never to his claims about creation ex nihilo. £} Springer</page><page sequence="15">Int J Philos Relig (2009) 66: 15-32 29 simultaneous independence and dependence of the ego in relation to the wholly other. He writes there that the idea of creation ex nihilo expresses a multiplicity not united into totality; the creature is an existence which indeed does depend on an other, but not as a part that is separated from it [and so can be unified with it to form a whole or totality]. Creation ex nihilo breaks with system, posits a being outside of every system, that is, there where its freedom is possible. Creation leaves to the creature a trace of dependence, but it is an unparalleled dependence: the dependent being draws from this exceptional dependence, from this relationship, its very independence, its exteriority to the system. (Levinas 1969, pp. 104-105)20 Because in creation the creature is created out of nothing in a system by an other who is not part of a system, the creature is independent of any system. Its independence from systems is thus dependent on a relation with an other. It is their relationship, in other words, which is outside of any system and without totalitization - a relation that Levinas simply calls ethics or religion. Adapting some of Levinas' other (Kantian) language, albeit in a way he may not fully approve, we can thus say that creation ex nihilo describes what we can call a heteronomy of autonomy or a dependency of independence. Thus, there is, at the very heart of the doctrine of creation ex nihilo, a paradoxical relationship between creator and creature, what Keller calls a "reciprocity of influ- ence" between the creator and creature, or what Caputo describes as the necessity of a human countersignature to God's affirmative creativity (except that Keller and Caputo find these relations only outside the doctrine).21 This paradoxical bond between creator and creature means that each can only be unconditioned in relation to the other, which means, further, that each of them is a "condition" or, more accurately, an uncon- ditioning of the other's unconditionally.22 This point about the mutual implication of creator and creature has been well-summarized by Derrida's friend, Jean-Luc Nancy, in his recent project, which he calls a "deconstruction of Christianity." Part of that pro- ject involves a deconstruction of creation ex nihilo. However, unlike Derrida, Caputo, and Keller, Nancy sees the doctrine, as I do, as articulating the deconstructive notion of primordial alterity and thus sees the doctrine as auto-deconstructing. I give the last word of this section to him: The concept of the "creation of the world" represents the origin as originally shared, spaced between us and between all beings. This, in turn, contributes to rendering the concept of the [sole] "author" of the world untenable. In fact, one could show how the motif of creation is one of those that leads directly to the death of God understood as author, first cause, and supreme being. Further, if 20 The role of dependency in the independence of agents has been explored in ways different from Levinas, but in ways broadly consistent with the conception being developed in the present essay, by Maclntyre (1999), and by MacMurray (1999). 21 Keller (2003), p. 181; Caputo (2006), pp. 91-93. 22 I have explored this concept of unconditioning in the context of a discussion of Derrida and Kierkegaard in Cauchi (forthcoming 2008/9). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="16">30 Int J Philos Relig (2009) 66: 1 5-32 one looks at metaphysics carefully, there is not a God who simply and easily conforms to the idea of a producer. . . . The distinctive characteristic of the concept of creation is not that it posits a crea- tor, but that, on the contrary, it renders the "creator" indistinct from its "creation." (Nancy 2000, p. 15)23 The creation of deconstruction The deconstructions of creation ex nihilo undertaken by Derrida, Keller, and Caputo have all been motivated by an interpretation of the doctrine which sees it as situat- ing a supercause outside of and prior to the world and the beings that inhabit it. In place of this view, each of them has argued in different ways for seeing alterity at the foundation of existence and thus for a vision of existence that is not monolithic but endlessly adaptable and therefore open to a future. This constitutional openness of being is, moreover, essential for their ethico-political concerns, which is why, as especially Derrida and Caputo argue, deconstruction is ultimately an ethico-political undertaking and also why deconstruction has been a driving force in the resurgence of interest in political theology. While I endorse this deconstructive understanding of existence, I have argued here that it is precisely creation ex nihilo which provides a thematization of the concept of agency that undergirds that vision. It is creation ex nihilo, in contradistinction to the cosmologies which originate in the Greco-Roman and Gnostic traditions, that understands the existence of the world as grounded in the irreducible difference and relationship between creator and creature and therefore in the irreducible difference and relationships among creatures (since the doctrine implies that we are all created ex nihilo). Because it is the very logic of the doctrine that leads, as Nancy argues, to the deconstruction of the misreadings of the doctrine, then it cannot simply be asserted that deconstruction deconstructs the doctrine of creation ex nihilo. Deconstruction does not unidirectionally undermine creation ex nihilo. It would be more accurate to say that the doctrine of creation ex nihilo, rigorously conceived, is itself already deconstructive. For this reason, we might even speak not only of a deconstruction of creation but also of a creation of deconstruction. There is no doubt that, regardless of the radical implications we have found in the most "orthodox" of thinkers (Augustine and Anselm), many proponents of the doctrine of creation ex nihilo (Aquinas, for instance, or creationists, but also libertarians wor- ried about determinism) conceive God on the model of causality, and so understand Him (and it is usually a Him in these cases) to be a kind of singular superpower. To such an understanding, the deconstructions of Derrida, Keller, and Caputo doubtlessly serve as valuable correctives and, even more valuably, as profound explorations of the meaning of creation. But it would be wrong, I think, to see such deconstructions as deconstructing the agency described in the doctrine itself. That, as I have tried to show, is itself already deconstructive. 23 See also Nancy's book devoted to creation, Nancy 2007a.
