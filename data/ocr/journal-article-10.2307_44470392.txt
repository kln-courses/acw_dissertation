Airframe structural responses, seat/floor reaction loads, and the interactive effects of secondary impacts between multiple cabin seat rows were investigated. The scope and conduct of the test are presented together with some preliminary analyses of the test results. DURING THE PAST DECADE a major emphasis had been placed in the development of analytical and test methodologies pertaining to the crash dynamics discipline (1). Several full-scale transport airplane section and complete airframe impact tests were conducted during this period to provide an understanding of the impact response characteristics of the structures and to provide input validation data for the various crash dynamic analytical techniques undergoing development. These full-scale impact test programs also provided empirical data which could be used to develop crash dynamic design standards for the airframe and internal cabin equipment items on large airplanes certificated under Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 25 (2). Most of the full-scale impact tests conducted in the 1980 's have involved an assessment of the vertical impact conditions. These tests supported the justification of new proposed design standards and extended the understanding of the crash impact phenomenon. Nevertheless, full-scale airframe impact data which emphasized longitudinal impacts were sparse and were limited to low energy transfer conditions, as experienced during the FAA/NASA Controlled Impact Demonstration (CID) (3) (4) . High energy transfer impact test data for test conditions which approached the airframe protective shell strength was found only to exist for the fuselage structure, seats, and cabin compon- ents on small FAR Part 23 airplanes (5) (6) (7) (8). In addition to the more recent CID program, the transport airplane full-scale impact test data base contains the test results of two older generation transport airplanes (9) (10). As summarized in table 1, these test programs did not achieve the impact velocity change or peak acceleration levels of sufficient magnitude to support investigating the ultimate strength of the airframe shell, particularly the cabin floor and its interface with the cabin seats. Therefore, the transport airplane full-scale longitudinal impact test program was devised to further investigate the airframe and seat/cabin floor strength and response char- acteristics at a higher impact level and one that approached the airframe protective shell's ultimate strength.

Objectives of the subject test were to determine the interaction between a transport airplane fuselage, floor structure, and multiple cabin/occupant restraint systems under longitudinal impact conditions considered potentially survivable; to provide baseline response data that could be used to support current crash dynamics design standards and future research on metal and composite structures; and to investigate the feasibility of conducting high energy longitudinal impact tests with large full-scale test specimens. A 10-foot-long airframe section was prepared for longitudinal impact testing at peak accelerations (and velocity changes) of 9 g's (26-ft/sec) and 14 g's (40-f t/sec) . Per table 2, these peak accelerations repre- sented low energy (checkout) and high energy (test) impact conditions. The impact levels were selected on the basis of a concerted structural analysis of the airframe section design; the static test of a similar airframe section (12); and a series of dynamic seat tests (13). The longitudinal impact airframe section was fully loaded to include a full complement of cabin seats and dummy occupants. Structural response data were obtained during the impact from instru- mentation installed on the fuselage struc- ture, seats, and dummies. A complete description of the test program can be found in reference 14. TABLE 2. TEST CONDITIONS Longitudinal Tests Plonnod Actnal Low Energy Log's @ 26 ft/sec. 7.4 g's @ 22 ft/sec.

FACILITY AND TEST METHOD HYGE DESCRIPTION - The test was conducted at the Transportation Research Center of Ohio's Impact Simulator Facility which features a 24-inch-diameter , HYGE Shock Tester, figure 1. The HYGE principle, as applied to safety testing, simulates the deceleration conditions of an impact but in reverse. With the HYGE system, the test vehicle and occupants (dummies) are initially at zero velocity. This situation simulates the constant velocity condition prior to an actual crash. The programmed, rapid acceleration of the HYGE thrust column accelerates the sled with attached test article (s) and produces an impulse similar to that generated from the rapid decelera- tion of a moving vehicle during an impact. The system can generate a gross thrust of 750,000 pounds which is capable of accelerating a pay load of 10,000 pounds to 71 mph and attaining a peak acceleration of 44 g's. Peak accelerations of 100 g's and velocities of 100 mph can be attained with lighter payloads. The system is pneumatically operated and develops its thrust through differential gas pressure acting on the two faces of a thrust piston in a closed cylinder. Acceleration is governed by a metering pin which projects through an internal orifice in the closed cylinder. The contour of the pin meters the flow of gas through the orifice, regulating the acceleration and making the utilized thrust precisely repeat- able. By varying the volumes and pressures in the chambers of the cylinder, the pulse amplitude and duration generated by a meter- ing pin can be modified. FIGURE 1. HYGE ACTUATOR TEST FIXTURE - A test fixture was designed and fabricated to attach the fuse- lage section to the test sled. The critical constraints were to keep the weight to a minimum and not alter the floor /fuselage shell interface load path or affect the structural integrity of the airframe. Figure 2 illustrates the method of attaching the test specimen to the test fixture and the test fixture to the test sled. The fuselage attachment design was based on separating the reacting loads into horizontal and vertical components; the horizontal loads resulting from the longi- tudinal acceleration, and the vertical loads resulting from the test specimen weight and 1.929</page><page sequence="3">the overturning moment generated by the longitudinal acceleration. FIGURE 2. TEST FIXTURE TEST SLED - The test specimen was attached to the test fixture and the test sled which was abutted to the HYGE cylinder. The sled was instrumented with accelerome- ters mounted to the center nose to measure acceleration in the longitudinal direction. The sled velocity was obtained by integration of the sled acceleration pulse. DATA ACQUISITION - The data acquisition system has the capacity of simultaneously acquiring and recording, on magnetic tape, 56 data channels from sensors requiring signal conditioning. Each data channel met the class filter requirements of SAE Recommended Practice, J211b. Each sensor was connected, via umbili- cal cable, to a signal conditioner located in the control room. The signal conditioners supply excitation voltage, amplification, filtering, and remote controlled insertion of the shunt calibration resistor. The outputs of the signal conditioners were multiplexed and recorded on tape recorders. The analog signals were recorded, unfiltered, on 1-inch magnetic tape at 60 inches per second. Immediately preceding each test, all data channels were checked. After proper balancing of each channel, shunt calibration resistors were inserted, electronically, for each sensor and recorded on the magnetic tapes. During the test event, selected data channels were recorded on an oscillograph to provide real-time verification of the test data. TEST SPECIMEN The airframe test specimen was a 10- foot section cut from the aft fuselage of a narrow body transport airplane. As shown in figure 3, the section structure, character- ized by a tapered lower fuselage shell, was /TRIPLE PASSENGER (TYPICAL) SEAT (TYPICAL) 1 I - I m 8' -3 Nn * n ni A 1 I 8' -3 * SEAT E SEAT C »EAT A 12»-5- CABIN FLOOR , REF ļ 13'-9" REF "¡J.

AIRFRAME TEST SECTION/FLOOR PLAN 1.930</page><page sequence="4">881377 separated from the fuselage shell just forward of the rear galley between body stations (BS) 1120 and 1240. The section was configured with three rows of two triple passenger seats each secured to the floor with standard track fittings. These seats were selectively strengthened and were positioned fore and aft to accommodate a representative floor load condition (34-inch pitch) and to assure that the middle row of seats would maximize their loading of the floor beam at BS 1180. Each triple seat contained three anthropomorphic dummies weighing approximately 165 pounds each. The dummies were restrained by standard aircraft seat belts. To account for the test specimen's loss of structural continuity, the test section floor structure was modified, as illustrated in figure 4. This modification consisted of reinforcing the end floor beams by adding beams at BS 1120 and 1240, and increasing the shear strength by doubling the number of fasteners around the periphery of each outboard floor panel. Each of the six seats was structurally modified to absorb, without failure, the higher expected impact loads. Illustrated in figure 5, these modifications involved the installation of reinforcement gussets at both fore and aft leg locations. In addition, the seat spreader tubes were filled with epoxy to prevent collapse resulting from the occupant seat belt loads. Verification of the performance associated with these seat modifications was accomplished through separate dynamic impact sled tests conducted at the FAA Civil Aeromedicaly Institute (CAMI) (13). These tests were also used to calibrate the output from strain gages installed on the six seat leg structural members with the load cells which interfaced with each seat leg and the CAMI test fixture (15). The bare airframe section excluding the onboard equipment, i.e., seats, dummies, etc., weighed 1,900 pounds. The total weight of the test section with seats and dummies was 5,498 pounds. INSTRUMENTATION AIRFRAME - The airframe section and seat installations were instrumented with accelerometers, strain gages, load cells and displacement transducers, as identified in table 3. TABLE 3.

Reference 14 provides a full description of all sensors with exact X, Y, and Z position coordinates. As shown in figure 6, the majority of instrumentation was concentrated at BS 1180 with sensor installed at the floor beam, track, and fuselage frame locations. Accelerometers were mounted on the two inboard seat tracks just forward of BS 1180, and one inboard seat track at both BS 1120 and 1240 per figure 7. In addition, accelerometers were also installed at three above floor frame locations at BS 1180. Also, the floor beam at BS 1180 included four cap mounted strain gage bridges and four string potentiometers at each seat track intersection location as shown in figures 8 and 9. Calibration of the floor beam at BS 1180 was accomplished subsequent to completion of the two longitudinal impact tests. The calibration involved statically loading the floor beam at each track intersection and measuring the load, deflection, and corresponding strain gage reading at each gage location. SEATS - Seat instrumentation included triaxial accelerometers placed at the aft cross tube of both center row seats. Pelvic installed accelerometers and seat belt load cells also were provided for each mid positioned dummy at the two center row seats. In addition, each of the six seats contained axial strain gage bridges installed at the leg(s) and diagonal structure(s) as illustrated in figure 10. These gages were calibrated during the sled tests performed previously at CAMI (13). The calibration sled tests subjected each seat with anthropomorphic dummies to a low energy peak acceleration of 9 gfs (26-ft/sec velocity change). The seat strain gage data were recorded together with the forces measured with load cells located at each seat leg-track attachment point. Using the seat strain gage responses measured during the airframe section longitudinal impact tests, the floor reaction forces could be determined with the CAMI calibration data. PHOTOGRAPHIC COVERAGE High-speed, motion picture cameras were employed to provide slow motion (1,000 fps) coverage of each test. Three onboard and five off board high-speed cameras and a real-time video tape system were used to provide side, oblique, frontal and rear views as shown on figure 11. The onboard and off board camera system served different purposes. The onboard cameras were strategically placed to document local structural failures should they occur. One onboard camera was located to view the seat leg structures and their attachments to the floor structure. Two onboard cameras were located under the floor to view the instrumented floor beam at BS 1180. These onboard cameras could be used to define the sequence of events and be readily correlated with the instrumentation data if any structural failures occurred within their fields of view. 1.932</page><page sequence="6">881377 FUSELAGE FRAME / ' /' V / ' ' _ / SSII») ļ' ' .WIRE CRACK DETECTOR 881240 1 ļ - - FLOOR BEAM FLOOR STRUCTURE - ' ļ ' I ^ - SEAT TRACK i ' j' / A ACCELEROMETER (TRIAX) ' J N ^ ■ ACCELEROMETER (LONG) ' / # STRAIN GAGE ' / O STRING POTENTIOMETER FIGURE 6.

AIRFRAME CRACK DETECTION SYSTEM As mentioned in the introduction, an objective of this test was to subject the fuselage test specimen to an impact pulse that would impart dynamic loads approaching the ultimate strength of the basic airframe structure. Structural analysis and supportive static tests of the airframe for the impact condition provided a level of confidence that the airframe and seat installations could successfully react to the test loads without structural failure. In order to address the potential of structural failure and to provide an additional aid in the analyses and understanding of a test result where structural failure might occur, an airframe crack detection system was added to the test specimen. The crack detection system was simply five independent closed electrical loops created by bonding a 40-gage copper enamel coated microwire along selected areas of the airframe. Any structural cracking or failure which might have occurred in an area where the microwire was installed would break the microwire and disrupt the electrical signal. One microwire circuit was installed on each of the four seat floor tracks and one was installed along the upper and lower caps of the instrumented floor beam at BS 1180. A loss of signal in either of these microwire circuits would indicate the time and sequence of structural failures should they occur. These data could be potentially useful in analyses of the test results. 1.934</page><page sequence="8">881377 TEST RESULTS OVERVIEW - The airframe test section was longitudinally impact tested at both low and high energy impact conditions. The first test involved subjecting the airframe and contents to a 7.4 g's peak acceleration (22.4 ft/sec velocity change). This test was conducted primarily to check the test setup and verify that the seat strain gage readings were within the data range recorded during the CAMI calibration tests at a comparable impact level. No visual evidence of any deformation of the floor or seats was observed following this test. For the high energy impact condition, the airframe and its contents were then subjected to 14.2 gfs peak acceleration (36.2 ft/sec velocity change). Again, no visible evidence of deformation occurred to the seats which was comparable to that observed for like testing of those seat models at CAMI and is discussed in the post- test observations section of this paper. Table 4 summarizes the peak longitudinal accelerations, maximum seat belt loads and seat track deflections on the starboard side of the airframe for the high energy impact condition. TABLE 4.

The electrical voltage deviation occurred early during the onset of the acceleration pulse while a post-test visual inspection of the starboard inboard seat track found no evidence of cracking or structural failure. POST-TEST OBSERVATIONS SEATS (GENERAL) - The six modified seat and dummy test specimens remained intact and totally restrained during the 14.2 g's peak acceleration (36.2 ft/sec velocity change) impact test. Post-test observation of each triple seat revealed no visible deformation of the basic leg and diagonal support structures while some structural deformation (as depicted in figure 12) was noticed at each fore and aft cross tubes, primarily at the window side locations. Minor buckling was also observed at each of the seat frame spreader tubes and forward of the respective seat belt retention ring attachment area. These noted seat deformations were consistent with deformations observed during testing of the same seat model at a comparable impact level at the FAA's CAMI facility. FIGURE 12. POST-TEST CONDITION 02 FRONT CROSS TUBE DEFORMATION - SEAT A (SEAT CUSHION REMOVED) Both the first and second row seats also experienced variable damage at the rear side of each seat back, as shown in figure 13. This damage was caused by the head and/or knee strike from each of the aft positioned dummies. A complete description of the post-test condition of each seat may be found in reference 14. SEAT TRACKS - The seat tracks were measured for vertical deformation after the removal of all test articles. Only minor deformation was noted which may be attributed to the test. These data are contained in table 5. BS 1120 and 1240 were used as reference points for each measured track location.

The actual longitudinal acceleration imparted to the sled by the Impact Simulator is depicted in figure 14, while the maximum numeric values are summarized in table 4. The resultant longitudinal cabin floor acceleration level experienced at the starboard inboard seat track accelerometer , located just aft of the rear leg of Seat D, is shown in figure 15. Comparison of these acceleration time histories revealed no significant attenuation or magnification of the sled acceleration pulse when compared to the measured airframe acceleration pulse. This observation was consistent for all the airframe longitudinal accelerometers whether they were located along the cabin floor or the upper airframe shell structure. The peak acceleration levels measured on the two center seats were also consistent with the peak magnitudes experienced by the sled and airframe floor and shell. The seat frame acceleration pulse shape differed somewhat from the triangular shaped input pulse, however, the seat acceleration pulse shape is not unlike those obtained from dynamic testing of the same seat model at the CAMI sled test facility. The pulse shape differences can be attributed to the seat/dummy interaction between adjacent seat rows, the lag in the dummy response, and the manner in which the dummy loads the seat itself. Figure 16 depicts the seat acceleration pulse measured on the seat frame structure of Seat D. SEAT/FLOOR REACTIONS One of the prime objectives of the transport aircraft fuselage section longitudinal impact test was to determine the seat/floor reactions with calibrated seat leg structures. The seat model used in this test program was by design asymmetrical with respect to the location of the occupants and the seat legs support structure which resulted in the seat pan structure being cantilevered somewhat towards the sidewall or outboard side of the aircraft. Due to this dissymmetry, the outboard seat legs are more highly loaded than the inboard seat legs. The data reviewed herein reflects the more highly loaded outboard seat leg floor reactions. Preliminary seat /floor reactions have been determined and are summarized in table 5. Time history data plots for all the recorded data can be found in reference 14. The data presented herein are preliminary results which are still under review and verification. These data are presented to provide some insight into the type and quality of data that might be available when the analyses of the test results are complete. Some of the early impact test results of the 14.2 g's peak acceleration (36.2 ft/sec velocity change) is as follows. 1.936</page><page sequence="10">881377 20 J 1- : 15 - 10 - &lt;0 .......... o» . 5 - • z ........

The seat models tested at both facilities were identical. The test impact pulses, while both triangular shaped, differed somewhat with the Seat D sled pulse represented by 14.2 g's peak acceleration (36.2 ft/sec velocity change) and the CAMI sled impact pulse represented by 13 g's peak acceleration (40.6 ft/sec velocity change). The first peak load shown in these time history data correspond to those maximum values found in table 6. The phase difference seen in the data plots is believed, in part, due to a slight difference between the zero time reference and the acceleration pulse onset used at the separate test facilities.

The forward legs' floor reactions data for Seat D and the CAMI tests are depicted in figures 17 and 18. A comparison between the first peak (maximum) loads is noted. The CAMI seat test data include a second peak load which is believed to have resulted from the anthropomorphic dummy's upper torso rotational motion. This motion was arrested by impact of the dummy's upper torso with its legs and the seat forward crossmember. In the case of the subject test, the rotational motion of the dummy in Seat D was arrested by secondary impact with the seat back of the just forward Seat B and thus a second peak forward leg load did not occur. The aft leg floor reactions data for Seat D and the CAMI tests are shown in figures 19 and 20. Seat D aft leg floor reactions were determined using both the forward leg axial load bridges (gages #01 and //04) and the aft leg diagonal strut axial load bridges (gages //02 and //05) . The calibration data indicated that both of these gage locations could be correlated with the vertical component of the aft leg load cells on the calibration fixture and thus could provide an independent determination of the aft leg vertical floor reactions. The range of the aft leg diagonal strut gages is believed to be valid only to the first peak load. This is because of the nonlinearity of subsequent output signal. FORWARD LEG LOADS - A comparison of the vertical seat/floor reaction load vs time for five of the onboard seats, up to the first load peak, is shown in figure 21. These data generally reflect the expected trends with respect to curve shape and load 1.938</page><page sequence="12">881377 1000| : (/) ........... m .......... _i o ^-îooo- v... w-'"-'' J 3-2000 - ' ' / / ' . yr ^ -3000 - vV / ' I ^ -4000 - Q ...........

DATA COMPARISON - SEAT OUTBD FWD LEG LOADS GAGE #01 AND GAGE #04 magnitude and, in some cases, correspond with the CAMI sled test data. For example, the two center row seats (Seat C and Seat D) and the front row seat (Seat A) data traces are comparable with each other and with the CAMI sled test data. Seat A does, in fact, show a forward seat leg floor reaction somewhat greater than that of the other seat rows. Such a reaction would be expected for a front row seat and is based on the position that front row seats must react to the loading from its occupants along with some secondary impact loading from the occupants seated in the next rearward seat row. There are also some apparent deviations from the expected trends which have not yet been resolved. The two aft seats' forward leg reaction data traces differ with respect to the corresponding data for the other seat rows and with respect to each other, as illustrated in figure 22, which depicts the total data range. These differing data characteristics may be realistic and reflect the complex load interaction between adjacent seat rows and dummies or may reflect an instrumentation fault. Completion of the data analyses and verification may offer rationale to explain these questionable test results. AFT LEG LOADS - A comparison of the outboard aft leg first peak load data traces are shown in figure 23. These data compare well with respect to each other and expected trends. These data, shown in figure 23, reflect some views that seat/floor sections differ somewhat between aft /mid /forward row seats due to seat/dummy interaction between these adjacent seat rows. A complete review of all data traces for both tests is in process and will be published when complete. PROJECTED TASKS This paper presents an overview of the transport aircraft longitudinal impact test program addressing the test specimen, instrumentation, and the data requirements along with a view of some preliminary test results. The recorded data traces at the time this paper was prepared had not yet been fully analyzed. The results of the data reduction and evaluation for both impact test conditions will be published when completed. It is Intended that the publication will discuss the seat calibration coefficients, all of the seat/floor reactions, and analyses of the floor beam strain gage and displacement data, considering both response and strength. 1.941</page><page sequence="15">1000 J : in o u m o u - ' / W ... . ^ - 1000 - - ' f ' *' y* &lt;-2000 - V ' x'l -y' g -3000 - ' • ; j v i -4000 - ' / ..."

The use of that test facility can expand the envelope of potential test specimens and impact conditions that experimenters might readily investigate. The fuselage, floor and seat restraint system of large transport airplanes are capable of absorbing high dynamic impact loads in excess of current inertial load criteria. Impact response data have been successfully recorded for both seat and airframe structures where that data can be used to assess the response and strength characteristics of those structures. Preliminary data reduction appear promising, in that measured load magnitudes and impact response data traces are, in most cases, comparable to like seat sled test results. Baseline response data have been obtained which should further expand the understanding of the impact characteristics of large scale airframe structures and their respective internal cabin furnishings subjected to severe, but survivable, longitudinal impact conditions. Those data will also provide a new base for study programs that would further investigate both impact response and strength characteristics for both metallic and composite material airframes and their internal cabin furnishings .
