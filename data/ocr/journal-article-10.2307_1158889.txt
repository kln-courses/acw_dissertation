Pp. 388, bibl., ill., cartes. F. 68. THIS splendidly produced volume continues the Lebeuf exploration of the Sao civilization of Cameroon, Nigeria, and Chad. This time the dimension is not historical but contemporary, the researches comprising an ethnographic study of the Kotoko, direct heirs of the ancient empire. The 50,000 Kotoko live in cities, along the banks of the Chari and Logone, which are studded amongst the larger, dispersed population of' Arabs '. The cities, their symbols, rites, and myths, are the major concern of Mme Lebeuf, who supplements direct observation with archaeology in order to present the complex picture of Kotoko symbolism. Each of the cities has a myth which describes its foundation and despite variations in the subject matter the myths share important elements. The founders of the cities come in pairs, a fisherman and a hunter, a younger and an older brother; the site is discovered by a sign; there is an animal mediator between the earth and men; the settlement involves the sacrifice of the founder or his children. Mythical elements are the symbolic representations found in Kotoko thought; they are society's attempt to order the relations between individuals, once the notion of territory has replaced kinship bonds, as well as being an attempt to define an individual's position in the universe. The city is an image of the world and Kotoko society. They are walled, dual structures, divided into northern and southern sections which correspond to groups of pairs. The structural oppositions, which are complementary, have been extracted from the original, mythical act of settlement. North is associated with right, maleness, strength, water, active- ness, white; south is associated with passiveness, hunting, black. North is the day and the hot season, south is the night and the rainy season. The city is also anthropomorphic-a man on his back, head to the east, arms and legs spread out, with the guti (a monumental mound) as its penis. The second part of the book deals with the sacred prince. He is the moon, governing indirectly from semi-seclusion, through his councillors who are the stars in the firmament. There are fourteen cities and fourteen princes, three of whom are in a specially privileged position in relation to the others. Like the Mossi, Jukun, and Benin king the Kotoko prince is hedged in by taboos and royal etiquette. His comings and goings are associated with the calendar, he ritually opens the seasons, he may never see a river. During his enthronement he is twice secluded. The first time he hides in the gloom with his ancestors, sleeping close to the earth, a creature of the west, the night, and death. The second time he is dressed in splendid clothes, laid out high on a bed, a creature of the east, the day, the heaven, and life. Les principautes Kotoko is not a book for the historian or the functionalist anthro- pologist. It is ethnography in the Griaule tradition. Mme Lebeuf criticizes historical con- jectures which have been bandied about in the Chad region, particularly the indiscriminate unitary theories involving Berbers, Hamites, and Yemenites. She herself has decided that no theory of the peopling of the region will be acceptable and offers no hypotheses as to the mutual relations between Kanuri, Hausa, Kanem, Bornu and the Kotoko-Sao. Nor does she attempt a comparison of Kotoko divine kingship with other West African or Sudanese material. For this reason she has consciously dropped such loaded terms as ' emir ',' vassal ', 'feudal' from this study. The fascination of the book lies in the formal assessment of the</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS OF BOOKS symbols of kingship, the role of myth and ritual in the growth and structure of a city, and the complementary oppositions which can be found in the culture of kingship and settlement. ROBERT BRAIN L'Ancien Royaume du Congo, des origines a la fin du XIXe siecle. By W. G. L. RANDLES. Paris, The Hague: Mouton, 1968. Pp. 275, ill., maps. F 37. THE documentary materials for the history of the Kongo kingdom are probably as rich as any that exist for a comparable region in pre-colonial Africa. Yet, the last major attempt to synthesize the various sources was that of Alexander Ihle, Das Alte Kdnigreich Kongo, Leipzig, 1929. Although a fine scholarly work, this has now become somewhat dated owing to the publication in the past forty years of numerous documents, principally from Portuguese and Italian archives. These include, in particular, the volumes of Brasio, Felner, Cuvelier, and Jadin. Thus, Mr. Randles's book is timely. It is divided into three main sections. The first discusses the origins of the kingdom and analyses the political institutions before their decline in the face of European missionary and slave-trading activities. Also included in this section is a short account of indigenous economic and social achievements before the slave-trade impact. Here, little is added to the more detailed and more anthropologically orientated work of Georges Balandier, La Vie Quotidienne au Royaume du Congo du XVIe au XVIIIe siecle, Paris, I965. The frequent comparisons which Mr. Randles makes with other African states is useful, however. The second part of the book is a factual 40-page survey of Kongo-European contacts between 1483-1900. The last section's chapters are organized according to some of the most significant themes and topics of Kongo history; for example, the changes wrought by the European presence, the development of trade and trade routes, the rise of breakaway states such as Sonyo and the kingdoms of the Loango Coast, and the Portuguese expansion in Angola. While congratulating the author on the competence with which he handles his materials, one shares with him a certain disappointment that no greater insights have been achieved. He ends by stating: 'Au debut de cette recherche, nous avions nourri l'espoir de voir se former, a partir de l'enorme somme de documentation portugaise et italienne sur le sujet, une image claire du passe congolais. II nous apparait toujours indispensable de la depouiller attentivement, mais nous avons acquis la conviction que seule l'archeologie est susceptible de faire surgir la realite essentielle de ce passe ' (p. 233). Not only does the archaeology of the region need close attention; another attempt to collect oral traditions would surely prove fruitful, as would further research in the archives of Portugal, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands. There must still be a wealth of unpublished documents to investigate. Further- more, given the important sources which have been used, the author has perhaps been limited in his interpretations by the framework within which he has chosen to present his material. If sections two and three had been combined, for example, and the whole presented in terms of chronological development, the history might have flowed along more easily. Further insights into the relationships of political, economic, and social change might have been possible and new dimensions achieved. There is clearly still plenty of room for future work on Kongo history, which will always remain of prime importance not only for those interested in internal developments, but also for all who are concerned with the history of Kongo's neighbours. These were much affected by the changing situation in the Kongo kingdom itself. The book is well presented, with beautifully reproduced pictures and maps from con- temporary sources.
