<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews of Books RATIONALIST- WITHIN REASON Bottle in the Sea BY ALBERT GUERARD Harvard University Press, Cambridge $3.50 ALBERT guerard's choice of title for this sum- ming up of his beliefs is explained in the lines with which the book closes, lines which pic- ture a shipwrecked mariner throwing his mes- sage-bearing bottle into the sea, saluting "Les jours de l'avenir qui pour lui sont venus." But the truth of the matter is that this particular Bottle in the Sea is thrown not from the deck of a sinking ship, but from the firm shore of sanity, to those who are in danger of being swamped by the frothing waves of fear and confusion that menace the little boats of our days. Opposite the title-page have been placed the words of II Timothy 1:7 - "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind." Fear, to Guérard, is our great enemy: Fear we must acknowledge and measure and combat: but we should never yield to fear; and we should scorn those who seek to impose their will through fear. Fear of course is not purely physical: physical cowardice is the most excusable of all. Fear of poverty; fear of isola- tion; fear of not standing well with the many fine Literature Demands Tine Printing . . . LET THE ^JJoLiie oļ Service" Fill your publication requirements E. J. STORM PRINTING CO. 2230 San Jacinto Riverside 1938 DALLAS, TEXAS - ■ ■ - or with the successful few: when these fears paralyze thought and warp action, they be- come deadly sins. Cowardice means slavery, and the moral life demands freedom. Franklin Roosevelt was right when he insisted upon freedom from fear. That freedom is not merely one of four, it is the ultimate citadel, and its name is self-respect. We should be ready to face want, rather than submit to fear; and nothing can abridge our freedom of thought, except our own fear. The God-given soundness of mind through which we may escape the plague of fear and obey what Guérard calls "the first and simplest commandment . . . 'Act in such a way that , thou shalt not have to despise thyself' " ap- pears to him in the shape of ff reasonableness , i.e., balance, moderation, sympathy, practical sense; even, in homeopathic doses at any rate, a wholesome respect for custom and public opinion." When he defines himself as "a ration- alist - within reason," it is this reasonableness that he has in mind, as against the narrowness of rigid and ruthless reasoning. And it is this same steady reasonableness, this insistence on looking straight at the great dilemmas of man- kind without fear and equally without fanat- icism, that gives Guérarďs book its extraordi- nary quiet strength. Bottle in the Sea is divided into three parts: "Thought," "Dream," and "Faith." The first deals historically with Descartes and the En- lightenment, and philosophically with a plea for a refusal to follow nonrational forces blindly and for an increase in reliance on con- sciousness, or intelligence: "Awareness, clear- eyed and stout-hearted, combating chaos: such is the goal, not of science merely, from mathe- matics to psychology, but of morality and re- ligion as well." Speaking of Descartes's Dis- course on Method as the most signal victory in France's campaign for the dignity of discip- line, the author adds, "and for us today the xii autumn 1954</page><page sequence="2">same kind of mental effort, earnest, sustained, clear-eyed, is again the path of salvation." Nor need we be too pessimistic as to the time re- quired for the success of this effort. Says Guérard: Once Crèvecoeur hailed "the American" as a New Man, and he was not wholly wrong. There may be a new humanity struggling to be born under our very eyes. I fully accept "the inevitability of gradualness" but the fall into a chasm, the soaring of a jet plane, the course of a cannon ball, are as "gradual" as the progress of a snail: no intermediate step can be skipped. There is no scientific reason for accepting the snail's pace as the norm. In Part II the theme of increased conscious- ness is carried into the field of art. For us as human beings, Guérard says, common sense is not enough. "A Bellamy Utopia is no Heavenly City." Nor is power over nature enough, nor the exploration of the human mind, nor the advancement of worthy causes. "The perfect life on the human plane, free from disease, want, conflict, without fear, without anguish, would be that of a contented cow. And it is not enough" Here art, existing for its own sake and not in the service of anything else, offers "the renascence of wonder: either a dream world, or a magic light transforming drab reality." It offers to free us from the dou- ble tyranny of "the worship of meanness and greed and the enforcement of conformity." For over twenty years, Guérard conducted at Stanford a seminar on the Doctrine of Art for Art's Sake. From what he calls "our long symposium on the nature of art" emerged this definition: "Art is the quest of pleasure through the conscious expression of emotion." And Guérard concludes that ffArt then is that which enhances our consciousness " As science leads to the threshold of art, so art leads to the threshold of religion, but can go no farther. "In order to understand religion in its austere purity," says Guérard, "we must examine and allow the fullest claims of art - and then leave them resolutely behind. We must above all purge religion from everything that is not belief, but mere suspension of dis- belief, everything that is valid only on the artistic plane." In Part III, then, the author proceeds to the consideration of the most profound questions of religion. It is here that the orthodox of many creeds will, at some point or other, part company with him; for he does not give un- questioning assent to any orthodoxy. Yet if they are willing to match his lucent honesty, those who disagree with him on such grounds may very well be brought to admit that on these very points he is more, not less, religious than they. When he rejects "the god of the philosophers, the x = oc annihilating thought, purpose, action," and warns of the dangers of anthropomorphism and tribalism inherent in the concept of the Fighting God, it is because "My guide must be more of a living force than the God of the Philosophers; more of a mystery than the God of Abraham." "I want," he says, "a God who gives meaning to my life, a Living God." When he protests that the metaphysicians and theologians have built a "house of words" while "there are pressing soluble problems, war and want, disease and madness, that are loftily ignored or too often turned over to the huck- ster and the hack," he continues: I have just spoken like a utilitarian, an empiri- cist, a contemner of pure thought, eager only for usable truths that will promote the wel- fare of mankind. My words, if so interpreted, were but a travesty of my mind. I am not sat- isfied with the practical plane. I do not admit for a moment that our world of sense and senses is the whole of the universe, or even gives a true picture of the minute part of the cosmos that immediately surrounds us. I accept the possibility of miracles, not as scientific facts previously unobserved, not as mere coinci- dences, but as a definite and deliberate inter- continued on page 366 x¿y autumn 1954</page><page sequence="3">Reviews of Books CONTINUED FROM PAGE XIV ference of another plane of existence with our own. I am ready to see the heavens roll up like a scroll. I accept even a miracle greater than any suspension or alteration of material law: the mystic experience, a force beyond our hu- man ken singling out one of us, and speaking to him secrets which human tongue can not utter. My quarrel with theologians and meta- physicians is that they are not mystics: they are logicians. They are using the instruments of reason, effective and almost infallible in their proper sphere, in a domain that reason cannot reach. When he examines critically the three wit- nesses of Christianity - the Church, the Bible, and the personality of Jesus - he concludes with the pure teaching of Christ about the kingdom of God: "If we seek the kingdom within ourselves, by communing with the Christ spirit in us, we shall also inevitably build it among ourselves." His deepest objection to all the creeds is not their credulity, but "their inveterate , their irremediable materialism" Against materialism of every kind he has set his face. Guérard's first book, Trench Prophets of Yesterday , closed with Renan's words, "What shall they live by, who come after us?" Now, at the close of the message set afloat in his Bottle in the Sea , he offers his answer to this challenge. His criterion is: "Act in harmony with the sense of the universe. That there is such a sense must be accepted on faith; it is the very essence of faith." And how is this sense revealed to us? Says Guérard: 3 66 autumn 1954</page><page sequence="4">The compass turns to the magnetic North; Descartes believed that good sense, imparted to all men, enabled us to discern the truth; innumerable teachers, Rousseau and Kant the most explicit, hold that such a moral compass exists, and is called conscience. Broadly, I agree with them; the moral law in our hearts, the categorical imperative, is our sole inspiration. If the term be used symbolically, not dogmat- ically, I should be glad to call it the voice of God within us. Conscience, however, is encrusted with his- torical and social elements. "In order to be- come reliable, conscience should be stripped of all prejudices of race, caste, party, nation, or sect." This stripping is a delicate process - and what is the knowledge that is left when the layers have been peeled away? Here again we encounter the mystic: Like Descartes's good sense, like the aesthetic response, mysticism is universal. Every man, at some moment of his existence, be it ever so humble, or, far worse, be it ever so hectic, has felt its irresistible power. . . . A common man may never have known ec- stasy, and yet have his share of the mystic sense. Ecstasy is but a paroxysm: the mystic sense pervading the whole of existence is what I call faith: congruency with the unutterable, oneness with the sense of life. There is more faith diffused through the whole of mankind than in the rare and magnificent flashes of the professed mystics. Seers, poets, and con- querors are portents: we are awed by their unique power. But spiritual life is not made up of portents: it is an obscure and constant endeavor. We must set ourselves to listen to the "still small voice." But before it can reach us, we must "purify our sense of duty." Guérard tells us, "This is what I mean ... by good will and the critical spirit . Goodness is futile without will ; good will itself, i.e., will at the service of the good, may be blind and harmful if not checked by clear thinking and dispassionate inquiry." At the head of this final section of Bottle in the Sea stands the definition: "Faith is the Hope that Charity is not vain." The book ends with St. Paul's mighty hymn to Charity in the thirteenth chapter of his First Epistle to the Corinthians. Have Faith and Charity, and have no fear - this is the word of a civilized man to our fearful time that has almost for- gotten Charity in St. Paul's august meaning. Bottle in the Sea contains wisdom to cool our panic and set us to steering again a course away from shipwreck. Margaret L. Hartley</page></plain_text>
