<plain_text><page sequence="1">Comparative Ethnie Church Architecture by Richard Wolniewicz This essay briefly explores part of the American ethnic cultural land scape and compares the church architecture of several ethnic groups. Some may ask what is the cultural landscape, why should historians be interested in it, and how does a better comprehension of it help to understand history, be it Polish-American or otherwise? The cultural landscape is the visible imprint humans have left on the earth. It includes the things people have bu?t as well as the way they have influenced the natural environment Providing an adequate description of the cultural landscape is one of the cultural geographer's goals. These goals, however, include not only the description of humanity's visible imprint, but a fuller understanding of people and their cultures. The ultimate concern of a cultural geographer studying the religious landscape is not the church building, its shape, placement, or decoration, but a deeper appreciation of the values these ele ments reveal about the people who built them. The rich and beautiful diver sity of symbolism, decoration, and the structuring of space found in American churches reflect the values and patterns of thought of the people who worship within their walls. The buildings are shaped by, and are shapers of, people's world view and their conceptions of the deity.1 ^i-Fu Tuan, Topophilia (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1974), p. 4; W. T.

Change within ethnic groups and religions is another of the themes that runs throughout this essay, whether they are American "mainline" Protestant or east European groups. Religious views and symbols continue to be used as long as they "work" for the denomina tion's members. The symbols change when a group's cultural stance changes. In this short, comparative study of ethnic church architecture, the change in some symbols is readily apparent, while other groups' symbols exhibit remarkable persistence. As a comparative study, this article notes similarities and differences to paint a backdrop of several mainline American Protestant churches against which churches of east European origin are jux taposed. America's religious diversity was manifest long before it became an independent nation. Philosopher and theologian Michael Novak, comment ing on this diversity, has contended that Americans of north and west European descent emphasize individuality and reason in their religious life.2 Novak characterized the Nordic consciousness as orderly, clean, pure, en lightened, progressive, masterful, restrained, cool, and aloof. Their God is envisioned as a clean, rational, aloof and distant God, a monitor-in-the-sky observing our actions. Wayne Elzey and Catherine Albanese also used many of the same adjectives to describe the Nordic consciousness.3 Descendants of immigrants from eastern and southern Europe view their God in more pagan and immediate terms; as a presence in the fields, forests, mountains, and streams.4 They love the earth; their God dwells in it. Their ceremonies tend to be more passionate and appeal to the senses much more than those of most Nordic worshipers. The word pagan here does not imply ancient Druid spirituality or its manifestation of very recent years. It has more of the flavor Dennis Kolinski described in his article on rural Wisconsin's Polish shrines and crosses: "That traditional Slavic conscious ness saw the realm of the sacred in the whole world around us. The sacred permeated the entire landscape, finding expression in a multitude of sites."5 beliefs are structured, however arbitrary the links may seem from an objective standpoint. 2Michael Novak, The Rise of the Unmeltable Ethnics (New York: MacMillan Publishing Co., 1973), ch. 3, esp. pp.122-23. 3See Wayne Elzey's delightful article "The Most Unforgettable Magazine I've Ever Read: Religion and Social Hygiene in The Reader's Digest," Journal of Popular Culture^ Vol. 10 (Summer 1976), pp. 181-90.

Additionally, the Latin pagus means rural district or remote from the city, not godless. Early Christianity had a strongly urban character and those christianized last were those farthest from the city. The modern words peasant and pagan derive from pagus.</page><page sequence="3">Comparative Ethnie Church Architecture 55 St. Constantine (Picture 1), a Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in Minneapolis, provides an impressive example that Novak's contentions find visible support in American church architecture. The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Rite is one of several rites that are in union with the Western (Latin) Rite, but retain Eastern Orthodox liturgical style and other disci plines. This church's architectural style reminds us that Christianity reached many Slavs by way of the Orthodox East The building with its dome rest ing on a square base is literally a microcosm, a small universe. The dome represents the heavenly vault and heavenly perfection, the square base signi fies earthly perfection. Massive weight-bearing walls and small windows tell more about these people's conception of what a church should look like than about the state of modern or even medieval architectural technology. Early "Byzantine architecture prior to the tenth century has been character ized as extremely introverted.' The interior space covered by the dome and the elaboration of that space with sacred pictures and icons was paramount? least significant was the building's external appearance. Early Byzantium used stone and masonry extensively, preferring wide-spreading central voids with low hemispherical domes and barrel vaults, thus affording a maximum area for sacred pictures and decorations."6 The placement of an icon of Christ in the dome or behind the altar symbolizes the congregation's addressing of their Divine Savior. Icons themselves are abstract means of disclosing the divine. Elongated faces, exaggerated features, the nimbus about the head emphasize Christ's divinity rather than His humanity. The Ukrainian inscription around the icon is from St. John's Gospel, "I am the Way, the Truth and the Life. No one comes to the Father, except through Me."7 The genius of John's Gospel was that as he wrote he not only translated Aramaic words into Greek words as Matthew, Mark, and Luke had done, but also reinterpreted Jewish thought forms into concepts familiar to the Greeks. He substituted the Greek Platonic spatial scheme of two worlds, the "real" and the "unreal," which occur simultaneously, for the Jewish temporal view of two ages, the pre 6Walter Daschko, 'Tserkvy: A Survey of Ukrainian-Canadian Church Architecture in Ontario, Its Major Roots and Trends," Polyphony: The Bulletin of the Multicultural History Society of Ontario, Vol. 10 (1988), pp. 191-92.

Early Christianity was known simply as The Way.</page><page sequence="4">56 Polish American Studies s. s e a 1 U c C '3 O S 03 u o C Z3 C O U 1 o E</page><page sequence="5">Comparative Ethnie Church Architecture 57 sent, imperfect age, and the perfect age to come, which occur consecutively.8 The Jews called this second age the Kingdom of God. In John's Gospel, Jesus is not the usher of the new age, but the bridge, the Way, by which man reaches God's eternal world.9 The iconostasis or icon screen (Picture 2) symbolizes this Platonic spa tial theme. It holds the icons, partially shields the sanctuary behind it, lend ing a sense of mystery, some say magic, to the Divine Liturgy, and reminds the congregation of the unapproachability of God, except through the media tion of Christ. It symbolically divides the church into "real" and "unreal" worlds. This scene of Holy Saturday devotions communicates something essen tial about the character of the people. An earthly, sensual appeal is immedi ately evident. A rich polychrome of color satiates your sense of sight. Numerous flowers exude fragrances to stimulate your sense of smell. The shroud beneath the cross depicts the wounds of Christ, which the faithful kneel and kiss bringing their tactile senses into play. Passion lies close to the surface. They gain a fuller appreciation of the moment by fully employ ing all of their senses. The white walls in this picture characterized an unfinished phase of the final decoration. Ukrainian church walls typically have a rather luxuriant character. The same scene a few years later revealed that nearly every square inch of wall had been covered by decoration. After the decoration was com pleted two images of an enthroned Christ behind the altar portrayed a com mon theme in Eastern churches. A scene in a nearby Polish Roman Catholic parish (Picture 3) is simi lar in some ways to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic church. Heavy walls rooted firmly in the earth, numerous flowers, brightly colored banners, fig ures in the round, and the social drama of the Stations of the Cross attest to a sensual appeal. Christ is near. God is present. To the Catholic more than the Protestant, the church is literally a house of God. The sensuous, pagan nature of scenes like this and the one from the Ukrainian church makes many Protestants uneasy and, in their eyes, Catholics and Orthodox "less religious." Some Protestants, such as Presbyterians and Methodists, 8Colin L. J. Proudman, Top Secret (Cincinnati: Forward Movement Publications, 1973), ch. 8. 9John did much to save the early Church from extinction by removing this temporal emphasis and changing its message from "Prepare now for the new age Christ brings" to "the Church offers you a living relationship with God through Christ." This redefinition relieved the Church of its embarrassment caused by the non-occurrence of Christ's second coming. It also proved that its message could be reinterpreted thus changing Christianity from an ethnic to a universalizing religion.</page><page sequence="6">58 Polish American Studies C/5 1 GO O c O O &lt;?

An older Polish Roman Catholic church</page><page sequence="8">60 Polish American Studies describe such scenes as "fussy" or "busy," although Episcopalians might find them less so.10 Even in newer Polish churches (Picture 4) some old symbols remain intact although obviously other changes had occurred in decoration. The crucifix in Roman churches is a powerful symbol for Catholics. Ask a Catholic priest to explain its meaning and he will tell you it represents the passion, death, and resurrection of Christ. The emphasis is on passion, suf fering, and immediacy as well as a look forward to the resurrection. Erik Erikson stated that "values do not persist unless they work eco nomically, psychologically, and spiritually."11 What have American Catholics seen in the crucifix? How has it worked for them? Until re cently, the American Catholic Church has been an immigrant church and immigrants have usually started at the bottom of the economic ladder.12 Catholics saw themselves on the cross. Their own difficult lives, which they felt powerless to influence, echoed the self-sacrifice of Christ. Several writers, in addition to Novak, have made this suggestion. Thaddeus Radzilowski suggested that a people look primarily to the period of history that most closely accords with their present situation. The Partition Era is a powerful image to Poles in America, even to the third generation?a period in which poet Adam Mickiewicz described Poland as the "Crucified Christ of Nations" suffering for the world's sins.13 As the Catholic Church emerges from its immigrant past, Catholics rise in socioeconomic status. So the scene of the Suffering Servant may no longer suffice for the ascending suburban szlachta.14 An upwardly mobile Christ (Picture 5) has already replaced a suffering one in some parishes. More than a few progressive Catholics now view the subservient humility 10To be sure, some Protestants would find such Catholic and Orthodox scenes less fussy and busy than other Protestants. Presbyterian and Methodist churches tend to be less ornate than Episcopalian ones. A parishioner of St. Michael's Episcopal Church in Colorado Springs, which had just dedicated a new building in 1996, said of the new sanctuary that she did not care for: "It is so plain and non-descript that it might as well be the First Presbyterian downtown." Novak used the words fussy and busy in The Rise of the Unmeltable Ethnics, but church members commonly use them, too. Seemingly as twin confirmation of two of Novak's statements (1) that these terms are in common usage, and (2) that ethnicity is a matter of cultural transmission rather than genetics, a member of the Presbyterian church described later in this article used the very same words as Novak (fussy and busy) to describe Catholic churches. This individual had a Polish-American mother, but was raised Presbyterian. 11 Erik Erikson, Childhood and Society (New York: W. W. Norton and Co., 1950), p. 121, quoted in Anthony Netting, "Images and Ideas in Russian Peasant Art," Slavic Review, Vol. 35 (March, 1976), p. 50. 12Some would argue that with the influx of Hispanic immigrants, the American Catholic Church may retain the flavor of an immigrant church. 13Thaddeus Radzialowski, "View from a Polish Ghetto: Some Observations on the First One Hundred Years in Detroit," Ethnicity, Vol. 1, No. 2 (July, 1974), p. 130. 14Szlachta is the Polish equivalent of gentry or nobility.</page><page sequence="9">Comparative Ethnie Church Architecture 61 G C 22 o E &lt;+ O 3 1 I 1 S</page><page sequence="10">62 Polish American Studies o 75 .g cd U c a S o C3 -O .O 3 C/3 3 o E</page><page sequence="11">Comparative Ethnie Church Architecture 63 the old symbol suggests, as one PAHA member described it years ago, as a "desperate humility" that no longer portrays their middle-class status. The replacement of old symbols was not always welcome. A Time magazine article in 1976 related that many Catholics did not want to forsake the old symbol of the suffering Christ.15 In his 1994 article, Kolinski noted that a resurgence of shrine building in Central Wisconsin during the 1970s was a reflection of dissatisfaction with the late twentieth-century trends in the American Catholic Church, which, he stated, led to the unconscionable gutting of many beautiful old churches. Protestants tend to be more objective than Catholics, but, in turn, Western Catholicism has a more rational approach, a less mysterious attrac tion than the Eastern Rites. St. John's Byzantine Rite parish is a Carpatho Rusyn church that has clung to some of its Orthodox ways, but has given up others under pressure from the American Catholic bishops. Westernizing pressures occurred during the late 1920s and caused many other Uniate parishes to convert to Orthodoxy. Christ sits on a throne behind the altar (Picture 6), as in other churches of Eastern tradition, but the iconostasis has been shunted off to the side from its place in front of the altar. Although the congregation sets up a temporary tomb and shroud at Easter, similar to what is done in the Ukrainian Greek Catholic parish, the Stations of the Cross, a legacy of Western Christendom, not Eastern, hang on the walls. Statuary is not the characteristic art form of Eastern Rite tradition. Yet, in the narthex stands a larger-than-life size crucifix. The Carpatho-Rusyn priest explained that the people here were a small minority within the Catholic Church, which itself is a minority in American society. To com bat feelings of isolation, they had adopted Western trappings. "We have another statue," he said as he opened die door to a nearby broom closet to expose a statue of the Virgin under a dust-laden plastic cover. "She has been in there a number of years now." This priest was trying to revive some of the Eastern traditions. On the bulletin board was a plan for the replacement of the iconostasis to its central position along with pleas for donations. Asked how the fund drive was going, he answered, "Not as well as I had hoped. The people have grown more objective, more Western, in their out look. They do not want mystery in their religion anymore. They want to see everything." If any Orthodox Church in America could be expected to retain the orig inal display and functioning of the iconostasis, it would be St. Michael's Cathedral in Sitka, Alaska. After all, St. Michael's is one of the prime sites of Russian Orthodoxy in North America in a former Russian colony. Yet, the iconostasis was down-played somewhat even there. In 1993,1 asked the attendant in the Cathedral if the screen were the iconostasis and without another word he immediately asserted that it was kept open during the entire service. This unexpected jump from a simple question to a defen 15"U.S. Catholicism: A Church Divided," Time, Vol. 107 (May 24, 1976), p. 55.</page><page sequence="12">64 Polish American Studies C/5 a o 1 E S % a 2 c C CQ ? +-? o E</page><page sequence="13">Comparative Ethnie Church Architecture 65 sive answer showed some underlying sensitivity about the iconostasis. It appeared that the same move toward a more objective, less mysterious pos ture was evident even in Alaska. Obviously, the Roman Catholic bishops could not be the cause for the same cultural drift to more rational, less mys terious feelings among these Russian Orthodox folk. It seems that time and immersion in a different cultural surrounding produced the same result as the pressures of the Catholic bishops. In several denominations considered to be among the "mainline" Protestant denominations there is a very different emphasis. Sallman's pic ture, Head of Christ, for example, is more likely to hang in Protestant churches and homes than Catholic ones. It portrays a serene, fair-haired, scrubbed and tubbed, un-Jewish Jesus whose blue eyes are cast heavenward toward his Father, a Father who peers back with His all-seeing eye at His Son and all mortals through a hole in our dollar. Most Protestant ministers of America's mainline churches say the cross represents the resurrection, the victory. An empty cross signals a living, not a suffering Christ If a body is shown at all, it is usually a risen one as in the Christus Rex, a crucifix common to many denominations, but espe cially popular among Episcopalians. An absent Christ or a dressed up one equate to a progressive one, for the resurrection is more up-to-date than the crucifixion.16 Protestant churches, such as this Presbyterian one in a well-to-do Minneapolis suburb, mirror these values (Picture 7). Decoration is simple and severe. Only one floral arrangement adorns the table on festive occa sions like Thanksgiving Day. Presbyterians refer to the table as a table and not as an altar. An altar is a place where a sacrifice occurs. Suffering and sacrifice are definitely not the Presbyterian conception of a communion ser vice. In this church the main sensual attraction is to sight and light, the phe nomenon stimulating that sense. Sight, of all our senses, is the most ob jective. Seeing is believing. Sight greatly enlarges man's perception of the world. Distant objects can only be seen. Seen objects tend to be considered distant. The commodious space within this impressive building is well lit by large windows. A large, plain cross with a m?ndala, the symbol of per fection, hangs above the table and is enlightened from on high by some heavenly radiance.17 The huge rafters and plain orderliness of the brick com 16Kolinski, "Shrines and Crosses in Rural Central Wisconsin," p. 44. 17The large cross showing a body, which appears behind or above many Catholic altars, is a product of the Counter Reformation. Protestants preserved the spirit of earlier Christians, who had considerable reluctance to depict the crucifixion of Christ as the event was regarded by early Christians from the side of Easter day rather that Good Friday.

Davies, ed., The New Westminster Dictionary of Liturgy and Worship (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1986), p. 201.</page><page sequence="14">66 Polish American Studies plement the size of the room to provide a felling of strength, well-being, confidence and depth; not unlike that of a bank.18 Interior shutters (Picture 7) echo colonial times when they could be quickly closed should an enemy attack occur.19 The words of the traditional Thanksgiving song, "Bless This House," suggest that they had architec turally replicated those lines. "Bless these walls so firm and stout, keeping want and trouble out.... Bless these windows shining bright, letting in God's heavenly light.... Bless the folk who dwell therein, keep them pure and free from sin." Not all Protestant churches project such a light image. At times, new surroundings reflect age old attitudes from eastern Europe as they do in the beautiful Holy Emmanuel Lutheran church in Bloomington, Minnesota, which is a contemporary blend of east European humility and Lutheran pi ety. This congregation, affiliated with the conservative and fundamentalist Missouri Synod, traces its roots to Slovak Lutherans who lived in Minneapolis' Bohemian Flats before the turn of the last century (near the present University of Minnesota campus). They later moved southward along the Mississippi River. In 1967, they were ready to build a new church and told their architect that they were a simple, humble people and wanted something appropriate. At about the same time they were celebrating their seventy-fifth an niversary as a congregation. Their anniversary album depicts their pastor in front of a crucifix. A passage from the album's introduction divulges their frame of mind and expresses fairly intense and weighty words for a celebra tion. "This anniversary is not only an occasion of gratitude and great joy, but also a time for serious soul-searching and sincere repentance. We ac knowledge that we have been unworthy servants, poor stewards of God. We have not used the God-given talents, time and treasures entrusted to our management to advance God's kingdom and His glory to the extent that far greater progress could have been made. In our anniversary celebration, in all humbleness of heart, we confess our numerous sins, repent of them, and beg God's forgiveness." A heavy atmosphere pervades the church's interior (Picture 8), one suited for a people to whom, as Mencken might have said, "Beelzebub is a real as Babe Ruth." Three stylized but massive crosses stand in rough boul ders and contrast sharply against a white wall, which was constructed, and is illuminated during services, to focus attention at the center. Although no corpse hangs on them, the crosses appear capable of performing their de signed function. Both the doors of the church and the rugs are purple, the penitential color. Clearly the emphasis is not only on the resurrection, but also on redemption. A child raised in this church might have a different 18Tuan, Topophilia, p. 11. 19Interior shutters, common on many colonial churches, served a defensive purpose. They could be quickly closed during an attack by Indians, those who worshipped "the Other of the earth." See, Albanese, 'Technological Religion," p. 14.</page><page sequence="15">Comparative Ethnie Church Architecture 67 o o c c c -o 1 o E</page><page sequence="16">68 Polish American Studies o g S 3 &gt; o oo 1 o E</page><page sequence="17">Comparative Ethnie Church Architecture 69 concept of the deity than one raised in the previously described Presbyterian church. A goodly number of Episcopal churches, with Norman towers (Picture 9) appear to have been lifted bodily out of the English countryside and de posited on their present foundations. They were built by British-stock who increasingly identified with England in the face of waves of "foreign" immi grants. The lovely Gothic interior is essentially one of ordered simplicity (Picture 10). The pastor explained that the church was built at a time when religion was a very personal phenomenon. Stout stone walls and heavy wooden vaults lent an air of strength and confidence to personal, inner feel ings. He continued that in those times people left their thoughts of others at the threshold of the church. Did Novak say that Nordic worshipers tended to be less passionate and more restrained than Americans of Eastern and Southern European heritage? A Good Friday service here featured seven Episcopalian priests each giving a sermon on one of Christ's seven sayings while on the cross. Three of them began by declaring "I'm not here to make you feel bad." Their words were somewhat of a let down for one who was raised Catholic, and who knew that experiencing the Passion of Holy Week heightened the joy of the Resurrection at Easter. In the Episcopal Church, as in other American churches, the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s were a time of new social awareness and change. To many conservative Episcopalians, the world had been turned upside down. New liturgies were used, women became priests, neighbors had to be greeted at the Passing of the Peace, bright banners decorated the formerly austere interiors of churches. Some congregation members then described the walls that used to exude strength and confidence as dark, foreboding, and naked. The chapel adjoining this church illustrates the theme of change. It displays an architectural genius for simplicity and elegance that is a hall mark of many Protestant churches. The altar rail has a modern "carpentered" look.20 Over the altar hangs a colorful felt banner, the modern icon. These banners are icons because they serve the same functions. They add color, decorate, and instruct in a visual way something essential about the nature of the deity. The written message is "the spirit of the Lord filleth the world." Through an effective juxtaposition of receding (blue) and advancing (orange and red) colors, the flame appears to expand to fill the room ampli fying and, perhaps, obviating the need for the words. The interiors of many Protestant churches illustrate the same tendency toward simplicity (Picture 11). The importance of the Word and its procla mation through the Bible find spatial expression in the central placement of the pulpit of this Methodist church. The interior structure is essentially that of an auditorium. The small table's position beneath the pulpit is appropri ate for the relative importance in these people's mind of the Sacrament and the Word. The most dramatic moment of the service, referred to as the Call to Prayer by this congregation, is signaled by the lowering of the main ^Carpentered space in architectural parlance is space dominated by sharp, often rectilinear, angles.</page><page sequence="18">70 Polish American Studies o 00 &lt;D C C S o a C ON 1 E</page><page sequence="19">Comparative Ethnie Church Architecture 71 2 "o S O 'B 73 ex o cu w o E</page><page sequence="20">72 Polish American Studies S3 T3 O S S o C 6 o E</page><page sequence="21">Comparative Ethnie Church Architecture 73 lights as the light shining down on the pulpit intensifies. People bow their heads away from the Other in the sky. Grace flows in kilowatts; the air is electric with it. As a further expression of this spatial arrangement reflecting the relative importance of the Word and Sacrament, in some Methodist churches, such as Denver's First United Methodist Church, and many Baptist churches, the table disappears completely and a pulpit stands alone in the front center of the church. These churches are described as pulpit-centric by their denomi nations. Modes of architecture, decoration, and spatial arrangement are indicative of more than differences of line and color. They reflect basic differences in the value systems of the believers. After comparing ethnic churches, one might conclude that man's image of man and man's image of God have much in common and are at times difficult to differentiate. If one believes that God is anthropomorphic, created in the human image, that he or she is humanity's noblest creation and accrues those values humans holds dear, then it is reasonable that the variety of God merely reflects the variety of humanity. On the other hand, if one believes that God created man, it may seem reasonable to think, as Novak has suggested, that God has infinite facets and an infinite variety of people are needed to reflect that infinity. Perhaps no reasonable answer to this question exists. Religion, after all, is not a test of reason. It is a test of faith.</page></plain_text>
