O'Connor, Michael Rutter, Celia Beckett, Lisa Keaveney, Jana M. Kreppner, and the English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team' The current study extends previous research on a sample of children adopted into the United Kingdom follow- ing severe early deprivation and a comparison sample of nondeprived, within-country, early adoptees. We as- sessed 165 children adopted from Romania and 52 U.K. adoptees at age 6 years. Longitudinal data (at age 4 and 6 years) were available on 111 Romanian adoptees placed into U.K. homes before 24 months of age and on all U.K. adoptees. Results indicated that there was considerable catch-up among late-placed Romanian chil- dren from entry into the United Kingdom to age 6, but as a group they exhibited lower cognitive scores and general developmental impairment compared with earlier adopted Romanian children. In addition, the resil- ience suggested at the assessment at age 4 years was maintained longitudinally, but there was no further evi- dence of catch-up or recovery. INTRODUCTION The deleterious impact of severe early deprivation on psychological development is documented in several studies (e.g., Rutter, 1972/1981). Research findings suggest that deficits in cognitive, social, physical, and medical well-being are increasingly likely and more severe with prolonged exposure to deprivation (Ames, 1997; Rutter et al., 1998). Equally important, many of these same studies also indicate that substantial re- covery from delay is possible, at least in the short- term, following removal from the depriving environ- ment (Ames, 1997; Benoit, Jocelyn, Moddemann, &amp; Embree, 1996; Lien, Meyer, &amp; Winick, 1977; Rutter et al., 1998). However, findings reported to date have not laid to rest controversy regarding the effects of early experiences on later adjustment, including ques- tions concerning sensitive periods in development, the limits of resilience following adversity, the mech- anisms by which early experiences confer risk, and the role of psychosocial interventions in promoting catch-up or advances in cognitive skills (Bornstein, 1989; Clarke &amp; Clarke, 1976; Nelson &amp; Bloom, 1997). The opportunity to extend previous research on early experiences and later adjustment was provided in a "natural experiment" that compares the develop- ment of children who experienced early global severe privation and were later adopted into the United Kingdom, with the development of a sample of non- deprived within-country adoptees. The current study focuses on three central questions: 1) Is cognitive catch-up apparent even after very prolonged depri- vation? 2) Is duration of early privation or length of time in the adoptive home environment the key factor mediating cognitive deficits?, and 3) Are previously reported short-term patterns of catch-up and deficit maintained longitudinally? Resilience Following Early Extreme Adversity In previous analyses from this study, Rutter et al. (1998) found considerable resilience of cognitive skills and physical development to early environ- mental deprivation. Most children who had been adopted into families in the United Kingdom follow- ing severe global privation for up to 24 months exhib- ited cognitive scores within the normal range at age 4 years. Nevertheless, there was a dose-response con- nection between duration of deprivation and cogni- tive score at age 4 years. More specifically, children whose experiences of deprivation were limited to the first 6 months of life had cognitive scores that were lower than, but not statistically different from, early- placed, nondeprived adoptees. Children exposed to longer periods of deprivation exhibited increasingly lower cognitive scores, suggesting that deprivation was the factor mediating cognitive delay and that complete "recovery" had not (yet) taken place. The degree of physical catch-up among Romanian adoptees from the time of entry to age 4 years was equally impressive in absolute terms, although there remained relative differences between the U.K., early- and late-placed Romanian adoptees (Rutter et al., 1998). Findings from the assessment at age 4 years documenting catch-up and delay following removal from a depriving environment are broadly in line ? 2000 by the Society for Research in Child Development, Inc.

Findings from the assessment at age 4 years raised a number of questions about the degree of, and devel- opmental sensitivity to, catch-up following early ad- versity. Some of these issues are taken up in the cur- rent study. Questions Framing the Current Study What are the effects of prolonged deprivation on catch- up and delay? The inclusion of an additional group of late-placed (24 to 42 months of age) adoptees from Ro- mania in the assessment at age 6 years offered a chance to examine the impact of relatively brief compared to prolonged deprivation on cognitive and physical de- velopment. Two somewhat separate issues are relevant here. First, it was possible to examine the catch-up of the late-placed Romanian adoptees by comparing their development at entry into the United Kingdom with their development at age 6 years. Marked gains in de- velopment were observed in children whose experi- ences of deprivation were less than 24 months (Rutter et al., 1998), and parallel studies provide equally com- pelling evidence of robust short-term catch-up (Ames, 1997; Benoit et al., 1996; Lien et al., 1977). Numerous authors have drawn attention to children's enduring capacity for resilience, but few have suggested that there might be any limits on resilience. The 48 children who were adopted from Romanian orphanages after more than 2 years of severe and global privation pro- vide a unique and powerful test of resilience. Second, the group of adoptees who entered the United Kingdom after 2 years allowed us to examine further the nature of the association between depriva- tion and development. Specifically, we were able to test a linear, dose-response hypothesis about depriva- tion and cognitive development against an alternative hypothesis that included a sensitive period of devel- opment (e.g., Bornstein, 1989). If there were a sensitive period governing environmental input in cognitive development, then a nonlinear association between deprivation and cognitive and physical development would be found and the degree of impairment would likely be especially marked in this late-placed group compared with other Romanian groups. The reciprocal question is whether there would be considerable recovery in this late-placed group. That is, if there were little recovery following removal from deprivation, then the cognitive competence of this late-placed group would resemble that of children who remain in institutions, namely, profound and fairly global impairment (Kaler &amp; Freeman, 1994). Lit- tle previous research is available to suggest strong hy- potheses, but it is noteworthy that a parallel Cana- dian study of Romanian adoptees reported that 12 children adopted after 2 years (and assessed after 4/2 years to up to 9 years of age) had an average IQ of 69 (Ames, 1997). Despite the impaired average cognitive score in this late-placed group, however, there was considerable variation, indicating that some children did catch-up despite long-standing deprivation. Be- cause of the large sample, wide spread in degree of deprivation, and the fact that all children were as- sessed at the same age, the current study provides a rigorous test of the nature of the association between early deprivation and later development. Does duration of early privation or length of time in the adoptive home mediate cognitive deficit? In addition to cross-sectional analyses at age 6 years, the current study also includes longitudinal analyses of children seen at 4 and 6 years of age. The longitudinal data provide leverage in addressing two significant and somewhat related limitations of the age 4 cross-sec- tional analyses. First, it was not possible to determine whether duration of exposure to deprivation or time in the adoptive home explained cognitive catch-up and deficit. That is, the two variables were perfectly nega- tively correlated in the age 4 cross-sectional analyses. Second, it was not possible to determine whether the generally positive findings were prematurely opti- mistic or would hold up in the longer term. When considered jointly, the above two issues lead to a number of competing expectations regarding the age 6 findings. In the first instance, it may be that the pattern of catch-up and delay apparent at 4 years is maintained at 6 years. This hypothesis is predicated on the assumption that early privation is the key fac- tor explaining long-term cognitive deficit and that damage resulting from early privation is not modifi- able by later experiences, that is, there is no further catch-up. A competing hypothesis is that time in the adoptive home is the factor explaining patterns of catch-up and deficit. If this were the case, then deficits between the later adopted children and the early- adopted and nondeprived comparison group at age 4 years would be reduced at age 6 years, that is, there would be further and differential catch-up. This alter- native hypothesis is predicated on the assumption that the time window for catch-up for the later adopted children was insufficient at the age 4 assessment and that cognitive gain is equally likely at any point throughout the first years of life.</page><page sequence="3">378 Child Development A third possibility also exists, namely, that cognitive differences between the institutionalized and noninsti- tutionalized children, however slight or moderate, may be exacerbated following the stress of the school transition and the rapid cognitive advances and rate of learning that ordinarily accompany schooling (Cahan &amp; Cohen, 1989; Morrison, Smith, &amp; Dow-Ehrensberger, 1995). In other words, it may be that the optimistic picture suggested by the age 4 assessment was pre- mature. If this were the case, duration of deprivation would exert a stronger negative effect on cognitive skills at the latter assessment and a mean decrease over time would be found in the standardized cogni- tive scores of the Romanian adoptees. To date there is very little information on the long- term sequelae and the rate of catch-up of cognitive skills following severe deprivation (e.g., whether the rate of recovery is constant or modified over develop- ment). As a result, although the longitudinal design provides an opportunity to test multiple competing hypotheses, it is difficult to predict which of several disparate results would be obtained. Some degree of catch-up would be expected given the principle that there is malleability of neurobiological development, but this position needs to be weighed against the rec- ognition that brain development is partly condi- tional on experiences (Purves &amp; Lichtman, 1985). The degree of catch-up following deprivation therefore depends on the experience-dependent as contrasted with the experience-expectant nature of brain growth underlying cognitive development (Greenough &amp; Black, 1992) or, alternatively, on the extent to which early mental development is canalized (McCall, 1981; Wachs, 1996). There are, of course, clinical and case studies of chil- dren exposed to extreme deprivation for prolonged pe- riods of time (e.g., Skuse, 1984), but these reports have unknown generalizability. Similarly, long-term studies of children raised in institutions are rare (e.g., Clarke, Clarke, &amp; Reiman, 1958) and the early experience of formerly institutionalized children in longitudinal studies is not always characterized by extreme depri- vation (e.g., Hodges &amp; Tizard, 1989). Two parallel lon- gitudinal studies of Romanian children adopted into Canada are worth considering. For example, Ames (1997) reported that the rate of development in a small subset of Romanian adoptees assessed longitu- dinally was twice the normal expected rate according to the Gesell developmental quotient. Similarly, Benoit et al. (1996), also using the Gesell scale, re- ported that there was substantial gain in develop- mental quotient in the Romanian adoptees they stud- ied. Although the continuing progress suggested by both studies is noteworthy, in neither study was the sample sufficiently large to determine whether catch- up was associated with early deprivation or experi- ences in the adoptive home, or if the rate of catch-up was modified by age. In addition, it is not clear if the findings based on clinic-referred children would ex- tend to other samples. Despite the exploratory nature of the study, several features of the research design permit a strong test of the above competing hypotheses about the effects of early deprivation on long-term development. For ex- ample, (1) Children in the Romanian sample entered an institution at a very early age, long before develop- mental delay would have been detectable; (2) chil- dren were adopted and placed in the United King- dom at the time of the fall of the Ceausescu regime, so, the possibility can be ruled out that older children were not adopted younger because they were devel- oping less well; (3) children were chosen for the study based on a random, stratified sampling design; and (4) there was no association between the age at which children were adopted and the characteristics of the adoptive family (see below). METHOD Sample The Romanian sample was drawn from the 324 children adopted into U.K. families between Febru- ary 1990 and September 1992 who were processed through the Department of Health and/or the Home Office. A stratified random sampling design was used. The final sample included 22 children placed between 0 and 3 months, 36 placed between 4 and 6 months, 23 placed between 6 and 12 months, 20 placed between 13 and 18 months, and 16 placed between 19 and 24 months (51% male). These children were as- sessed at ages 4 and 6 years and are hereafter referred to as the longitudinal sample. The total sample of adoptees on whom age 4 data are available is actually 111 because there were 6 children whose official records indicated that they entered the United King- dom after 24 months when, in fact, they actually en- tered before 24 months (based on information ob- tained from parental interview). A second group of Romanian adoptees who en- tered the United Kingdom between 24 and 42 months of age were assessed at age 6 years only; these chil- dren were too old at the start of the study to be as- sessed at 4 years of age. This latter group, hereafter re- ferred to as the late-placed adoptees, included 26 children placed between 24 and 30 months, 16 placed between 31 and 36 months, and 6 placed between 37 and 42 months (65% female). That the numbers drop</page><page sequence="4">O'Connor et al. 379 in the older groups reflects the fact that there were fewer older children available to enter the study. As a result, the current sampling frame approximates a stratified sampling design given the population from which the sample was drawn. Because the number of children who entered the United Kingdom after 2 years of age was compara- tively small, all families with late-placed children were approached and asked to participate. Overall, 81% of the parents of Romanian adoptees who were approached agreed to participate. Our random sam- pling selection procedure is a particular strength not found in previous studies and has the obvious advan- tage of neither over- nor underestimating the adjust- ment problems of children who entered the country. The within-country adoptees, hereafter referred to as the U.K. sample or U.K. adoptees, consisted of 52 children (64% male) who were placed into adoptive families between 0 and 6 months of age. These chil- dren were assessed at 4 and 6 years of age. Intracoun- try adoptees were obtained through adoption agen- cies and social services departments. It was not possible to determine the rate of participation among the intracountry adoptees because a name was pro- vided to the project by the adoption agency only after the family consented to participate. Available infor- mation suggests that approximately 50% of the fami- lies who were contacted agreed to participate. Families of U.K. and Romanian adoptees were generally middle-class and slightly better educated than the general U.K. population, but did not differ in these respects from one another. Differences that did exist between parents adopting from the United King- dom and Romania were attributable to adoption pol- icy in the United Kingdom. For example, because age differences between adoptive parents and children influence placement decisions, parents of U.K. adop- tees (all of whom adopted infants) are significantly younger than parents of Romanian adoptees. For fa- thers, mean ages at the age 6 assessment were 42 and 44 years, respectively, t(205) = -2.76, p &lt; .01; for mothers, the mean ages were 40 and 42 years, respec- tively, t(214) = -1.98, p &lt; .05. In addition, a greater proportion of families of Romanian adoptees had bi- ological children prior to the adoption, 33% versus 2% X2(1, n = 217) = 28, p &lt; .01; and they were less likely to have adopted prior to the adoption included in this study, 4% versus 48% in the Romanian and U.K. adoptee families, respectively, X2(1, n = 217) = 54, p &lt; .01. These differences highlight the preference given to prospective intracountry adoptive parents who do not have children, and the fact that infertility was not the primary motive among many parents of Romanian adoptees. These demographic variables were not associated with cognitive adjustment and were therefore eliminated from further consideration. Among the families with Romanian adoptees, no association between family characteristics and child's age at entry into the United Kingdom was found, nor was there evidence that children who entered the United Kingdom relatively young were any different from those who entered later in terms of age placed in an institution (most were institutionalized in the first weeks of life) or physical condition at entry (most children were severely malnourished; Rutter et al., 1998). The vast majority of Romanian children (144/ 165, 87%) were adopted from institutions; however, the small number of children who were adopted from family settings prior to being adopted into the United Kingdom also experienced very significant neglect. Information on the quality of care in the institutions and other settings is limited mostly to anecdotal re- ports, including eyewitness accounts by adoptive parents and research team members. Without excep- tion, children adopted from Romania experienced very gross global deprivation, as reflected in their conditions at entry into the United Kingdom (Rutter et al., 1998) and reports on children who remained in institutions (Kaler &amp; Freeman, 1994). In the current sample, for example, weight, height, and head cir- cumference were all approximately 2 SDs below aver- age. Furthermore, the mean score on the Denver de- velopmental scales at entry into the United Kingdom was 63, indicating mild mental retardation, and 59% had a developmental quotient below 50 (Rutter et al., 1998). Finally, information on why children were placed in institutions was not systematically available. It is rea- sonable to infer, however, that severe economic adver- sity played a major role because of (1) austere eco- nomic conditions that were very widely experienced in the country; (2) the fact that most children entered the institution in the first weeks of life, long before any developmental deficits could be detected; (3) available anecdotal evidence; and (4) the remarkable re- covery that was found in most children despite severe deprivation (Rutter et al., 1998; see Results). In any event, given the very early age at which children en- tered institutions (85% entered within the first month of life), it is clear that children were not placed in institu- tions because of developmental delay or handicap. Procedures Families were visited around the time of the child's fourth (for the longitudinal sample) and sixth birth- days. The home visits consisted of an intensive inter- view with the primary caregiver (in almost all cases</page><page sequence="5">380 Child Development the mother), a set of behavioral and family relation- ship questionnaires and, in a separate visit, an exten- sive assessment of the child using standard cognitive and developmental measures and observations. The developmental assessment was carried out in the home by two research assistants who had been trained in cognitive and developmental assessments. For the Romanian adoptees only, information on condition at entry into the United Kingdom was available from medical records (for anthropomorphic data) and ret- rospective parental account (for developmental level) that was collected at the age 4 visit. Measures Anthropomorphic development was based on weight and head circumference measured by the research as- sistants at the age 4 and age 6 assessments. In addi- tion, for the Romanian adoptees, weight at entry was available from physical examinations undertaken when the child entered the United Kingdom. For a subset of children whose weight at entry was not available (n = 11), data were based on a medical exam performed when they were leaving Romania (see Rutter et al., 1998). Anthropomorphic data are pre- sented in SD units (Boyce &amp; Cole, 1993, based on Buckler, 1990); for example, -1.5 indicates a score 1.5 deviations below average. Available data indicate that there are not major variations in anthropormor- phic data in relation to the groups covered in the sam- ple (see Ulijaszek, 1994). Cognitive development was assessed at age 4 and age 6 years using McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (McCarthy, 1972), a widely used measure of intellec- tual functioning. The McCarthy scales at age 6 years have four subscales-verbal, quantitative, percep- tual, and memory-and a total score, Global Cogni- tive Index (GCI). All analyses below are based on the GCI because correlations between duration of depri- vation and the separate subscales were very similar, ranging from r(152) = -.27 for perceptual abilities to r(152) = -.43 for quantitative abilities, and the sub- scales were highly intercorrelated, from r(200) = .49 for verbal and perceptual to r(200) = .84 for memory and quantitative. A subset of children did not attain a basal score in the GCI; the Merrill-Palmer Scale was admin- istered to these children and a GCI score was provided based on the Merrill-Palmer Scale results (see Results). The scores on tests standardized several decades ago may be inflated because of secular changes in IQ scores over time (Flynn, 1987). This issue, the implications of which are addressed in the Discussion section, is par- ticularly relevant in this study because of our interest in relative and absolute scores. Developmental assessment was based on parental re- port on the Revised Denver Prescreening Develop- mental Questionnaire (Frankenburg, van Doornick, Liddell, &amp; Dick, 1986). This measure was collected at the age 4 and age 6 year visits. Data were also avail- able on the Romanian children at the time of entry into the United Kingdom based on retrospective pa- rental report provided at the age 4 visit. The Denver scale includes items covering personal-social, fine motor, language, and gross motor behavior. Previous analyses performed on this sample demonstrated the validity of the retrospective and concurrent Denver scales (Rutter et al., 1998). History of institutionalization was scored as present if the child spent at least 2 weeks in an institution or similar setting. Total number of months spent in the institution was also available but was essentially identical to the age at entry into the United Kingdom r(144) = .94. Three further measures were included as control variables for analyses of cognitive scores. The pres- ence of behavioral problems, which may have influ- enced performance at age 4 or age 6 years, was based on parent reports on a widely used index of behavior problems in preschool children (Elander &amp; Rutter, 1996). In addition, given that children had varied school experiences and that these changed between age 4 and age 6 years, two items were in- cluded from the parent interview: frequency of school attendance and whether the child attended a private or public school. RESULTS Preliminary Analyses Four Romanian children in the longitudinal sam- ple did not attain a basal score for the GCI at the age 4 assessment. These children were subsequently as- sessed using the Merrill-Palmer Scale and found to exhibit moderate mental impairment; they were there- fore assigned scores at random between 40 and 50 (corresponding to approximately 4 SDs below the mean) for analyses involving the GCI. The realloca- tion strategy was adopted so that cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses included low scorers and be- cause follow-up assessment indicated that all four children received at least a basal score at age 6 (range 57-69). Five children in the late-placed sample did not attain a GCI basal score at the age 6 assessment. They, too, were assigned scores at random between 40 and 50 for analyses involving the GCI. Denver scores at entry into the United Kingdom were impossibly out of range in many cases (e.g.,</page><page sequence="6">O'Connor et al. 381 scores of 0), reflecting extreme developmental delay and difficulty in discriminating among very impaired children. As with the GCI data, however, follow-up data (at age 4 or age 6 years, where available) indi- cated that all children achieved a score within the mildly impaired to above average range. In order not to exclude very low Denver scores at entry and to avoid analyses of unrealistic scores, children who re- ceived a score of lower than 4 SDs below the mean were allocated a score corresponding to 4-5 SDs be- low the mean. In addition, the Denver scale includes normative data by which a standardized score is com- puted only up to 6 years, 3 months. Because of this 6,3 ceiling, a continuous measure of Denver scores at 6 years was not available (e.g., children assessed at 6,3 could achieve a maximum score of 100, and so on); therefore, analyses involving the 6-year data are con- ducted only in terms of the presence of an impair- ment (defined as a score &lt;70). Analyses based on duration of deprivation are based on a continuous measure of age at entry into the United Kingdom as well as on categorical groups: 0- to &lt;6-month U.K., 0- to &lt;6-month Romanian, 6- to &lt;24-month Romanian, and (where available) 24- to 42-month Romanian. The categorical variable was used because it allowed for a direct test of early depri- vation (U.K. compared with 0- to &lt;6-month Romanian adoptees) and duration of deprivation (the three Roma- nian adoptee groups). The group distinction also re- sults in sufficiently large groups; however, the categor- ical distinction is not meant to imply a threshold effect, and this is made clear in the accompanying correla- tional analyses. Analyses based on the continuous mea- sure of age at entry (i.e., duration of deprivation) are re- stricted to the Romanian adoptees because this variable is not informative for the within-country adoptees, as all U.K. adoptees were placed before 6 months of age. As detailed elsewhere (Rutter et al., 1998), most children were in a very poor physical and psycholog- ical state at entry into the United Kingdom. Critical to the comparisons among the three Romanian groups (0- to &lt;6-months, 6- to &lt;24-months, and 24- to 42- months) is the finding that all three groups were equally delayed. Thus, there were no mean differ- ences in weight or Denver scores at entry into the United Kingdom, and most children in all groups ex- perienced institutional care very soon after birth and remained there until they entered the United King- dom. The equivalent and very delayed state of chil- dren at entry into the United Kingdom-regardless of age at entry-suggests that there were not likely to be differences in the quality (as distinct from quantity or duration) of preadoption experiences that might explain results at age 6 years. Preliminary analyses further indicated that there were neither main effects of gender nor interactions be- tween gender and deprivation in predicting GCI. Boys and girls were therefore combined in all analyses. The main results are presented in two sections. First, cognitive and developmental variables at age 6 years are presented for the late-placed adoptees. Analyses focus on the degree of catch-up from entry into the United Kingdom to the assessment at age 6 years, differences across all children at age 6 years in cognitive and developmental outcomes as a function of duration of deprivation, and the risk factors that mediate cognitive delay at age 6 years. Second, find- ings are presented for the cognitive and developmen- tal variables for the longitudinal sample. Analyses focus on whether duration of deprivation or time spent in the adoptive home environment explains in- dividual differences in GCI, and whether early depri- vation continues to exert long-lasting effects on cog- nitive competence. Development at Six Years of Age Catch-up following adoption among the late-placed Ro- manian adoptees. Upon entry into the United King- dom, the late-placed (24 to 42-month) Romanian adoptees were severely malnourished; the average weight was 2.69 (SD = 3.2) standard deviations be- low age norm. As a group, the developmental status as assessed by parental reports on the Denver scale was in the retarded range (M = 45.7, SD = 25.4). Al- though there was considerable variability in this late- placed group, it is striking that more than 90% had. impaired Denver scores (70 or below) and only slightly more than 10% were at or above expected weight for age. At age 6 years, after living in the adoptive home for between 30 and 48 months, there was very marked evidence of catch-up. The average weight had in- creased to .85 (SD = .98) standard deviations below age level, a significant increase, t(37) = -3.99, p &lt; .001. Too few data on head circumference at entry were available to estimate catch-up directly, but it is evident from the mean score at age 6 years of 2.06 (SD = 1.1) standard deviations below age norm that most children were still well behind and had not caught up at the level of body weight. Change over time in Denver scores also suggested considerable catch-up, as only 18% had Denver scores less than 70 (compared with more than 90% at entry). Differences at age six years according to age at entry: Anthropomorphic and developmental status.

In relative terms, there were moderate mean dif- ferences between the 24- to 42-month and 6- to &lt;24- month groups in weight and head circumference, but moderate to large differences between the late-placed children and the 0- to &lt;6-month Romanian and U.K. adoptees (Table 1). In addition, only in the late-placed group was there a substantial percentage of children whose Denver score was 70 or lower. Differences between the 0- to &lt;6-month and 6- to &lt;24-month Romanian adoptees at age 6 years were modest, and significant only for head circumference (Table 1). Similarly, only for head circumference was the difference between the U.K. adoptees and the early-adopted (0- to &lt;6-month) Romanian group sig- nificant, p &lt; .05. Despite these relative differences, the absolute values indicate Romanian children adopted before 24 months of age were impaired only in head growth. Differences at age six years according to age at entry: Cognitive data. Analyses of the cognitive scores at age 6 years indicated that the U.K. and 0- to &lt;6-month Romanian adoptees groups did not differ from one another and both scored significantly higher, on aver- age, than the 6- to &lt;24-month and 24- to 42-month Romanian adoptees; in addition, the 6- to &lt;24-month and 24- to 42-month Romanian adoptees were signif- icantly different from one another, F(3, 203) = 20.10, p &lt; .001 (Figure 1). The absolute values suggest that even the late-placed Romanian adoptees exhibited, as a group, normal (low-average) cognitive adjustment. However, interpretation of absolute scores depends on a population mean of 100 (see Discussion). The correlation between duration of deprivation and GCI at age 6 years among the Romanian adop- tees was r(157) = -.48, p &lt; .001. A scattergram, dis- played in Figure 2, illustrates both the linear associa- tion and the variation in cognitive scores for each age at entry. There is no statistical evidence of a nonlinear association in Figure 2. That is, once a linear age term was included, no significant increase in prediction was obtained in a regression analysis from nonlinear terms (e.g., quadratic, exponential). Equally impor- tant, there is considerable variability across the range of scores on the x-axis (i.e., age of entry). The correla- tion illustrated in Figure 2 is almost identical to that found when only the longitudinal sample is consid- ered, r(111) = -.49, and this, moreover, closely re- sembles the pattern found at age 4 years (Rutter et al., 1998). Correlation analyses also indicated a modest but linear association between deprivation and weight and head circumference at age 6 years, rs = -.38 and -.34, respectively, ps &lt; .01; within the lon- gitudinal sample the correlations were rs = -.22 and -.19, ps &lt; .05. Predictors of GCI at age six years. Regression analy- ses examined what indices of early risk mediate indi- vidual differences in GCI at age 6 years for the Roma- nian sample. The three variables available at entry, age, Denver score, and weight, were entered in a si- multaneous regression analysis (because of high per- centage of missing data, head circumference was not included in the regression). Age at entry into the United Kingdom was the strongest predictor of GCI at age 6 years, p = -.37, p &lt; .001. Denver score at en- try, 1 = .23, p &lt; .01, and weight at entry, P = .16, p &lt; .05, also made significant independent contributions. The model explained 31% of the variance in GCI scores, p &lt; .001. A similar pattern was obtained when</page><page sequence="8">O'Connor et al. 383 130 U sR 120 O 100 90 S90 80 N= 50 56 55 46 U.K. 0-&lt;6 ROM 6-&lt;24 ROM 24-42 ROM Figure 1 Global Cognitive Index (GCI) at 6 years of age as a function of group (age at entry).

These results suggest that the inclusion of the late- placed group does not alter the functional relation among mediating variables. The similarity between the age 4 and age 6 results (see Rutter et al., 1998) sug- gests that the three sources of risk continue to exert influence, and that the impact of these mediators has changed little in the ensuing two years.

However, the nonsignificant association be- tween GCI and institutional history is accounted for by the small number of noninstitutionally reared chil- dren rather than the insignificance of a history of in- stitutionalization. This is clearly illustrated when GCI at age 6 years is examined separately for the three Ro- manian groups (0- to &lt;6-months, 6- to &lt;24-months, 24- to 42-months) as a function of institution history. The means (SD, N) for the children who did not expe- rience institutional care were virtually identical across the three groups: M = 112, SD = 20, n = 12; M = 117, SD = 18, n = 6;M = 114, SD = 8, n = 3, for the 0- to &lt;6-month, 6- to &lt;24-month, and 24- to 42- month groups, respectively. In contrast, mean differ- ences were marked among those who experienced in- stitutional care: M = 114, SD = 18, n = 46; M = 97, SD = 18, n = 53; and M = 88, SD = 24, n = 45, for the 0- to &lt;6-month, 6- to &lt;24-month, 24- to 42-month groups, respectively. Longitudinal Analyses Longitudinal change and stability of anthropomorphic data and developmental status from age four to age six years. The following set of analyses was carried out on the longitudinal sample, that is, U.K. (0- to &lt;6- month) and 6- to &lt;24-month Romanian adoptees. Re- peated measures analyses in which age at assessment is the within-subjects factor and group is the between- subjects factor provide a direct test of longitudinal change and catch-up from age 4 to age 6 years. Weight, head circumference, and cognitive score at 4 and 6 years of age for the longitudinal sample are given in Table 2. Repeated measures analyses for weight indi- cated that there was a significant effect of group, F(2, 148) = 3.12, p &lt; .05, and age at assessment, F(1, 148) = 6.69, p &lt; .05; the interaction was not significant, F(2, 148) = 2.18. Follow-up analyses of the group effect revealed a significant difference between the U.K. sample and the two Romanian groups. As the abso- lute values illustrate, however, the two Romanian groups were not below their expected weight for age. Follow-up analyses of the age at assessment effect in- dicated a decrease over time. Although the interac- tion was not significant, it is apparent from the means in Table 2 that the decrease is accounted for by the U.K. and 6- to &lt;24-month Romanian adoptees (a change from .45 to .30 and .06 to -.12, respectively). Repeated measures analyses for head circumfer- ence indicated only a significant group effect: for group, F(2, 136) = 12.89, p &lt; .001; for age at assess- ment, F(1, 136) = .74; and for interaction, F(2, 136) = .79. Follow-up analyses of the group effect indicated that the U.K. group was significantly greater than the two Romanian groups, and that the two Romanian groups did not differ from one another. For head cir- cumference, the relative differences are buttressed by the absolute delay in growth: both Romanian groups were more than one SD below age norm. The above mean changes must be considered in the context of markedly stable individual differences for weight, r(157) = .86, p &lt; .001 and for Romanian groups only, r(108) = .85, p &lt; .001 and head circum- ference, r(143) = .88, p &lt; .001 and for Romanian groups only, r(95) = .88, p &lt; .001. Change over time in the Denver scores using the repeated measures approach could not be assessed because, as noted earlier, Denver scores at age 6 years were not continuous. Furthermore, because very few children exhibited impaired development at age 4 years (n = 4), it was not possible to empirically exam- ine change over time based on the presence or absence of delay. In other words, the catch-up (defined as mov- Table 2 Longitudinal Change in Physical Development and Cognitive Scores from Age Four Years to Age Six Years Based on Repeated Measures Analyses Age 4 Years Age 6 Years ROM ROM ROM ROM 0 to &lt;6 6 to &lt;24 0 to &lt;6 6 to &lt;24 U.K. months months U.K. months months Weight .45 (.80) .01 (.90) .06 (.97) .30 (.91) .02 (.98) -.12 (.93) Head circumference -.46 (.84) -1.1 (.97) -1.5 (1.0) -.55 (.79) -1.2 (1.0) -1.5 (.93) Global Cognitive Index 110 (15) 106 (18) 92 (19) 117 (18) 113 (18) 101 (18) Note: See text for repeated measures analyses results.

Longitudinal change and stability of cognitive data at age four and age six years. GCI scores for the longitu- dinal sample at 4 and 6 years of age are given in Table 2. Repeated measures analyses of variance indicated a significant effect of group, F(2, 150) = 14.89, p &lt; .001, and age at assessment, F(1, 150) = 54.90, p &lt; .001; the interaction was not significant, F(2, 150) = .48. Follow- up analyses indicated that the group effect was attrib- utable to the U.K. and 0- to &lt;6-month Romanian groups scoring significantly higher than the 6- to &lt;24-month Romanian group. The age at assessment effect is explained by an overall increase in GCI from age 4 to age 6 years for all groups. The absence of a significant interaction indicates that the gain over time in GCI was equal across all three groups; that is, there was no evidence of further catch-up in cognitive scores among the later entering adoptees. As noted above, the interpretation of the absolute GCI scores depends on a population mean of 100. The dose-response association between duration of deprivation at age 6 years, the fact that this correla- tion is sustained between age 4 and age 6 years, and the repeated measures analyses all indicate that early privation was the key factor in explaining cognitive scores. In particular, it is striking that there was no mean difference in the increase over time between U.K. and 6- to &lt;24-month Romanian adoptees de- spite the fact that children in the latter group spent less time in the adoptive home, experienced global severe privation for up to 24 months of age, and were more likely to have a low initial GCI score at the assessment at age 4 years. The pattern of find- ings provides very strong evidence that although time spent in the adoptive home was obviously crit- ical in providing normative experiences for devel- opment, it was not causally related to cognitive catch-up beyond a period of 2 years. We were able to directly contrast the effects of duration of privation with time spent in the adoptive home by comparing GCI scores among children who vary in duration of privation but are matched for time in the adoptive home (see Appendix). Analyses of cognitive gain from age four to age six years. The modest gain in GCI observed for the sam- ple as a whole is notable. The increase in GCI from age 4 to 6 years (i.e., GCI at 6 years - GCI at 4 years) was correlated with lower scores at 4 years r(159) = -.32, p &lt; .001; within the Romanian sample only, r(109) = -.36, p &lt; .001. Marked gains in GCI from age 4 to age 6 years were most apparent among but not re- stricted to children scoring in the low- to below-average range. Within the Romanian sample, children who scored below 80 increased by an average of 18.7 points whereas a significantly smaller average in- crease was observed among those in the average (80- 120; 7.0-point increase) or superior (&gt;120; 4.5-point increase) ranges. Further analyses indicated that the gain was greatest in the verbal subscale (a mean of 6 points) and smaller in the other subscales (a gain of 1-3 points). With the exception of (lower) age 4 score, no predictors of change-including behavioral prob- lems or school experience-were identified. Furthermore, a difference score of cognitive ability (GCI at 6 years - GCI at 4 years) did not correlate with age at entry r(109) = .09. The finding that there was a robust association between lower scores at age 4 years and increase in scores from age 4 to 6 years, and yet no association between age at entry and in- crease in score (despite the strong within-wave asso- ciation between age at entry and GCI) provides addi- tional evidence that time spent in the adoptive home beyond 2 years is not a predictor of cognitive gain. Finally, the means analyses of cognitive ability should be considered in light of the very high stabil- ity. The correlation between age 4 and age 6 GCI was r(159) = .78 in the total sample, p &lt; .001, and r(109) = .82 for the Romanian subsample, p &lt; .001. A conse- quence of the very high stability from age 4 to age 6 years was that there were no predictors of change over time in individual differences in GCI. DISCUSSION The adoption by U.K. parents of children reared in grossly depriving conditions in Romania was a hu- manitarian response that was subsequently met by concerns about the long-term prognosis of these chil- dren. The larger collaborative project of which the current study is a part seeks to address the emerging policy and clinical implications of this unique social- historical event and, in addition, to capitalize on this "natural experiment" to examine basic questions con- cerning risk and resilience in development and the causal role of early experience on later outcomes. Results of assessment at age 6 years underscore the remarkable resilience of development to early insult and reinforce conclusions made in an earlier paper (Rutter et al., 1998). Counterbalancing this remark- able resilience is the identification of possible long- term difficulties for some children. Where "recovery" was apparent at age 4 years, it was maintained at age 6 years, but lower scores-and in some cases deficits- were also maintained. Longitudinal analyses pro- vided two additional related insights not discernible</page><page sequence="11">386 Child Development at the previous assessment. First, although the move into the adoptive home was clearly the most impor- tant factor in the cognitive gain, duration of privation was a more important predictor of individual differ- ences in outcome than was time in the adoptive home beyond a period of approximately 2 years. Second, there was little evidence that, once deprived, children continue to gain in cognitive level with a longer pe- riod in the adoptive home-again, past a period of approximately 2 years. Following a discussion of the study limitations, the implications of this complex set of findings are explored below. Interpretations of the findings must be viewed from the standpoint of the study's limitations. Per- haps the most important limitation was that we were unable to explain the substantial individual differ- ences in cognitive scores at age 6 years or the modest variation in catch-up. It is certainly possible that, for instance, antenatal care and genetic influences, among other factors, might play some role. However, al- though variation in these factors may explain vari- ability of individual differences in scores at age 6 years, they would not likely mediate the association between deprivation and cognitive adjustment (un- less, of course, antenatal care and genetic influences were correlated with age at entry into the United King- dom, an unlikely possibility but one we were unable to test). In particular, risks such as very poor antenatal care would result in uniformly depressed cognitive scores across the whole sample. An alternative expla- nation is that the findings do not correctly specify the association between deprivation and catch-up and delay to the extent that early biological risk and poor caregiving environment interact in shaping later de- velopment (e.g., Sameroff &amp; Chandler, 1975). We were unable to directly test this hypothesis. A further limitation is that we had limited ability to discern which types (and possible interactive effects among types) of deprivation explained impairments in cognitive and physical development, nor were we able to identify what the biological underpinnings of the obtained differences were. Some hints are avail- able from a subsample of cases in this study reported by Castle et al. (1998). They reported that quality of care could explain some of the variation in cognitive scores at age 6 years. Similarly, Ames (1997) found that exposure to toys, being a favorite among care staff, and the child's cleanliness were associated with post-placement cognitive scores. Outcomes in Late-Placed Adoptees The lower scores of the late-placed children (24- to 42-months) at age 6 years notwithstanding, available evidence indicated that there was considerable catch- up in this group (although the timing of the catch-up cannot be determined). Weight, Denver score, and general cognitive ability average scores were in the normal range; average head circumference still sug- gested significant delay. Attention should also be directed to the individual variability in the age 6 out- comes. To date, we have been unable to identify pos- sible compensatory influences in the postadoption environment and have only limited insight into as- pects of the preadoptive environment (e.g., the con- trast between institutionalized and family-reared chil- dren) that explain individual differences in outcome. Deprivation Mediates Cognitive Adjustment and Physical Development The current analyses clarify the previous report by Rutter et al. (1998) and related research on insti- tutionalized children in suggesting that early priva- tion rather than time spent in the adoptive home en- vironment beyond a period of approximately 2 years was the key causal factor explaining cognitive and general physical development. This conclusion de- rives from several related analyses. First, correla- tional analyses revealed a dose-response association between duration of deprivation and lower cogni- tive scores at age 6 years. The linear pattern was ob- tained across a wide range of risk exposure, from 0 to 42 months of deprivation. Second, the effect of deprivation in the early months of life on later devel- opment is suggested by the longitudinal analyses. Means and correlational analyses indicated that not only do the effects of deprivation on development continue to influence adjustment at age 6 years, but the strength of the association actually increases (al- beit trivially) from 4 to 6 years of age. Third, there was no differential catch-up for the later-placed (i.e., 6- to &lt;24-month) adoptees compared to the early- placed (0- to &lt;6-months) adoptees between 4 and 6 years of age, a pattern that would be expected if the home environment continued to exert influence be- yond the time period that (relatively) immediately followed adoption. Moreover, subsequent analyses that directly contrasted duration of privation and duration of time in the adoptive home past 2 years indicated the substantial influence of the former and minimal effect of the latter (results are included in the Appendix). However, these findings are not nec- essarily inconsistent with the possibility that there may be gains in a subset of children, perhaps espe- cially low-scoring children (who have farther to catch up), after the initial approximately 2-year pe- riod. A further follow-up assessment is necessary to</page><page sequence="12">O'Connor et al. 387 examine this possibility. Taken together, these analy- ses indicate that duration of deprivation is the key causal factor explaining differences between groups. Regression analyses provided some insight into the nature of the deprivation. Consistent with the 4- year results (Rutter et al., 1998), age at entry was by far the strongest predictor of individual differences in cognitive competence at age 6 years. Above the effects of duration of deprivation, additional long-term pre- diction was found from weight at entry (an index of nutritional status) and Denver score at entry (an in- dex of general development). The long-term predic- tion of weight and Denver score at entry, despite the marked and relatively rapid gains and eventual nearly complete recovery at age 6 years, further strengthens the causal claim that can be made about the role of early experience on later adjustment. The current analyses provide perhaps the strongest evidence to date that early deprivation compromises long-term development. Nevertheless, the finding that deprivation is associated with impairment is, on its own, unlikely to surprise most readers. Instead, what is novel about the set of findings presented here is that the remarkable degree of catch-up identified at the ear- lier assessment is maintained over time and that signif- icant catch-up, but not complete recovery, is possible even after prolonged exposure to deprivation. Relative and absolute differences in catch-up, impair- ment, and delay. A corollary of the failure to find sig- nificant further catch-up from age 4 to 6 years is that recovery is not complete-although the pattern of ab- solute and relative differences in scores varies by measure and age at entry into the United Kingdom. Absolute delay or impairment (i.e., below average scores) at age 6 years was found for weight in the late- placed adoptees and head circumference in all Roma- nian adoptees. The degree of long-term deficit in physical development contrasts with apparent com- plete recovery reported in other studies (e.g., Lien et al., 1977). It remains to be seen whether absolute and relative differences in, for example, head circumfer- ence have significant implications for later develop- ment. At least at age 6 years, absolute deficits in head circumference were not always accompanied by defi- cits in cognitive ability (e.g., the 0- to &lt;6-month Ro- manian adoptees had a significantly smaller head cir- cumference compared with the U.K. adoptees, but the two groups had equivalent cognitive scores). Further- more, although the absolute rate of recovery differed for head circumference and weight, both physical measures are similarly correlated with age 6 cognitive ability, r(156) = .32 and .27, respectively, and they are moderately correlated with one another, r(156) = .58. Relative and absolute deficits in cognitive ability were also observed in the late-placed (24- to 42-month) Romanian adoptees. Although the interpretation of the relative differences may be comparatively straight- forward, interpretation of the absolute scores is more complicated. The population mean of tests standard- ized many years ago (as in the case of the McCarthy Scales; McCarthy, 1972) is no longer 100 (cf. Flynn, 1987), and this is reflected in a number of studies using the McCarthy Scales (see Murray, Hipwell, Hooper, Stein, &amp; Cooper, 1996). If this is the case, then the "true" ability of the latter group of adoptees might not be in the average range. Similar caution in interpreting the absolute scores would also need to be extended to the other groups. A final comment about the cognitive data concerns the gain over time. The gain is noteworthy, but not un- precedented. Gains over specific assessments have been reported in subsamples of children, although it is less common to observe mean change for the entire sample (e.g., Moffitt, Caspi, Harkness, &amp; Silva, 1993). The implications and interpretations of this finding in the current sample are not obvious. The gain in overall GCI was unrelated to available data on schooling or be- havior problems, and was significantly associated only with lower initial scores. There was anecdotal evidence that some children were initially (i.e., at age 4 years) very reserved on expressive language tests, and may not have performed at ability; this is consistent with the particularly large increase on the verbal subscale. Few studies have comparable data on similarly aged chil- dren, so it is not possible to determine how common in- creases of this magnitude are. Test-retest (McCarthy, 1972) results over one month in a similarly aged sample indicated a mean increase of 10 points, but the rele- vance for long-term mean increase is uncertain. It is possible that services received by initially de- layed children in the current sample explain the catch-up, but it was not possible to test this hypothe- sis directly with the data available. Support for the in- tervention explanation is found in the articles by Ames (1997) and Benoit et al. (1996); both studies found that cognitive gains were pronounced among those exhib- iting significant early delay, that is, those referred to a child development clinic, following intervention (see also Burchinal, Campbell, Bryant, Wasik, &amp; Ramey, 1997). Finally, mean increase in GCI could also reflect qualities in the adoptive home environment across all families, which were above average based on limited available evidence (e.g., parental education). Context of the Current Findings It is important to place the current set of findings in a larger theoretical and research context, but it is not</page><page sequence="13">388 Child Development altogether clear what context is most relevant. For ex- ample, what predictions could be made from early privation are not clear from the existing normative re- search findings on infant cognition and memory (Hartshorn &amp; Rovee-Collier, 1997) and the confluence of behavioral and neurological changes in the first months of life (Herschkowitz, Kagan, &amp; Zilles, 1997). In contrast, strong statements about the importance of parent-infant interactions in the first months and years of life for later cognitive competence have been suggested (Murray, Fiora-Cowley, Hooper, &amp; Cooper, 1996; Tamis-LeMonda &amp; Bornstein, 1989). The marked catch-up observed in most children appears to be at odds with the above emphasis on early experi- ences (although we cannot rule out that early individ- ual differences in experience predict later outcomes even in this very deprived group). There is then the accumulation of neuroscience data that increasingly emphasizes experience-dependent processes in brain development on the one hand and the resilience of young brains to adverse environmen- tal input (or experience-expectant processes) on the other (Greenough &amp; Black, 1992; Huttenlocher, 1994; Nelson &amp; Bloom, 1997; Purves &amp; Lichtman, 1985). This line of research would suggest both resilience and im- pairment, although it is not easy to discern what de- gree of delay and catch-up would have been expected from this model. Furthermore, superordinate to spe- cific findings on, for example, cognitive recovery fol- lowing malnutrition (Strupp &amp; Levitsky, 1983; see also Pollitt, Gorman, Engle, Martorell, &amp; Rivera, 1993), the decreased sensitivity of higher order cognitive struc- tures compared with sensory areas to early experi- ences (Waters, Klintsova, &amp; Foster, 1997), or the long- term effects of stress on the brain (O'Brien, 1997) is the notion of canalization (McCall, 1981; Wachs, 1996; Waddington, 1940). Canalization refers to a relatively strong developmental (biological) predisposition or self-righting tendency that protects against early envi- ronmental insult. The findings are broadly in line with the canalization hypothesis that the human infant has built-in buffers against early adversity but that this "protection" decreases with development. Clearly, fur- ther information at the level of brain function and pro- cessing in our sample would be very valuable. Set alongside the above expectations and explana- tions are findings from intervention studies indicat- ing the remedial effects of earlier, more intense, and maintained interventions for cognitive competence (Ramey &amp; Ramey, 1998). There is no intervention that is more intense and sustained than adoption, but it is unclear whether there are parallels between patterns of change among children exposed to severe priva- tion and those from "normal" high risk settings. The difficulty of synthesizing the current findings with extant research arises from the relative absence of direct parallels and is further compounded by un- certainty over whether the patterns of catch-up and deficit will continue. Persistent deficits in cognitive and physical development observed between 21/2 to 5 years after removal from the depriving condition do not necessarily suggest permanent impairment. The current set of findings suggest that further substantial catch-up in absolute or relative terms may be unlikely, but it remains to be seen how the risks identified and the implicated underlying mechanisms continue to in- fluence subsequent developmental challenges. What is clear is that further follow-up is needed, not only to examine the trajectory of cognitive skills and general developmental progress, but also to ex- amine the intersection of cognitive, social, and emo- tional development in the formation of peer relations and academic achievement, as well as ongoing family relations. It is not possible to predict scholastic attain- ment from existing cognitive results because of, for example, the need to consider the contributions of be- havioral adjustment and peer relations. Subsequent transitions, such as school entry, may bring about op- portunities for developmental progress or, alterna- tively, maladjustment.

APPENDIX By combining the age 4 GCI scores from a subsample of children who were seen at age 4 years with the age 6 GCI scores of the children seen only at age 6 years, it is possible to differentiate time in adoptive home from duration of</page><page sequence="14">O'Connor et al. 389 deprivation. That is, at the time of the 4-year assessment, those children who were assessed at age 4 years spent be- tween 0 to 24 months in the institution and between 24 and 48 months in the adoptive home. Those children who were seen only at age 6 years (i.e., those who entered the United Kingdom at or after 24 months of age) spent between 24 and 42 months in the institution and between 30 and 48 months in the adoptive home. We then selected those children who were seen at 4 years who entered the United Kingdom be- tween 0 and 18 months of age (and had lived in the adop- tive home for between 30 and 48 months) and contrasted their GCI scores with the scores of children who were seen only at age 6 years. The two groups are similar in the range of months in the adoptive home (30 to 48 months) but differ in the range of months of exposure to deprivation (0 to 18 as compared with 24 to 42 months). However, the mean rise in GCI from age 4 to age 6 years in all children complicates and confounds a direct compar- ison between the two groups mentioned above (because the above comparison depends on comparable mean scores). Accordingly, regression analyses were used to statistically equate the mean GCI scores at age 4 and age 6 years, in ef- fect creating estimated age 6 scores for the late-entering adoptees using the U.K. comparison group as the standard. The assumption underlying this method is that the mean increase over time is an artifact because it was observed in all groups-including the comparison group. The resulting mean comparisons therefore contrast duration of institu- tional care while controlling for the length of time in the adoptive home. The analyses were carried out only for those adoptees who had experienced institutional care. The mean GCI score for those adoptees whose experi- ences of deprivation were limited to 0 to 18 months and who experienced the adoptive home environment for 21/2 to 4 years was 100 (SD = 18.1, 95% confidence interval: 96.1- 104.0; n = 83). In contrast, the mean GCI score for those adoptees whose experiences of deprivation ranged from 24 to 42 months and who experienced the adoptive home en- vironment for 21/2 to 4 years was 73.6 (SD = 46, 95% confi- dence interval: 59.6-87.6; n = 43). Thus, although the groups were comparable in terms of time spent in the adop- tive home, the difference in exposure to deprivation was as- sociated with a 26-point difference in GCI.
