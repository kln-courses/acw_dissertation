<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS* BYVIDYA DEHEJIA ALTHOUGH IT IS AXIOMATIC AMONG LITERARYCRrTICS THAT A work may contain multiple layers of meaning, many historians of art, particularly of early Buddhist art, seem curiously reluctant to accept a comparable conflation of meanings. Yet if Asvaghosa, writing his Buddhacharita around A.D. 100, could make habitual use of words in two or more meanings,' and if Aryasura could constantly use ilesa or double enten- dre in his fourth-centuryJatakamWla,2 parallel skills were undoubtedly known to the artist producing visual narratives in the media of stone and paint. This essay advocates the need to recognize, accept, and even admire the multiplicity of meanings apparent in early Buddhist sculpture and painting, in which the artist reminded the viewer of the manifold religious interpretations that may be suggested by any single emblem. Scholars have insisted too much upon sin- gular and exclusive explanations of early Buddhist reliefs, from the totally aniconic interpretation of the early 1900s3 to the somewhat restrictive site-oriented interpretation of this last decade.4 There are two critical and complementary prereq- uisites for the accurate interpretation of early Bud- dhist art. The first is an awareness of the multiple meanings conveyed by the major Buddhist emblems of the tree, the pillar, and the stu2pa. The emblem is a picture that represents something different from itself. The tree, pillar, and stiipa may in fact be inter- preted in three distinct and equally valid ways in different contexts and in varying visual compositions. In their first aspect, emblems may be read as aniconic presentations of the Buddha. The term "aniconic" carries the dictionary meaning of "symbolizing with- out aiming at resemblance," and "aniconism" is de- fined as "worship or veneration of an object that represents a god without being an image of him."5 This essay will show that a variety of emblems, includ- ing footprints, a seat or throne, a parasol, and a pillar of radiance, were frequently used, singly or in combi- nation, to represent the person of the Buddha in a narrative art that was primarily concerned with the biography of the Buddha. To deny the validity of this concern of the ancient artists, devotees, monks, and nuns' is to misread the overall message of the monu- ments. In their second aspect, the emblems of the tree, pillar, and stiipa, seen in relief sculptures, may *Editor's note:The Ars Orientalis Editorial Board has invited Susan Huntington of Ohio State University to respond to this article. Her rejoinder will appear in volume 22. represent sacred spots, or firthas, and the devotions performed there. Thus, the bodhi tree may be intend- ed to represent Bodh Gaya, site of the enlightenment; the wheel-crowned pillar may represent Sarnath, site of the first sermon; and the stuspa may represent one of the sacred relic mounds built at a variety of sites. In their third aspect, these same emblems of tree, pillar, and stiupa are to be viewed as attributes of the faith; thus the tree is intended to recall the divine wisdom of the Buddha, while the pillar suggests his sacred doctrine. The exact interpretation of the emblems depends on their visual context. In one panel, the tree shelter- ing a seat may be an emblem that portrays the pres- ence of the Buddha himself; the sacredpipaltree may indicate the enlightenment of the Buddha, while a mango tree may indicate his presence at Sravasti. In another panel, the tree with a seat beneath it may stand for a hallowed pilgrimage site; the sacred pipal tree may indicate Bodh Gaya, site of the enlighten- ment. In yet other panels, the pipal tree is intended to recall the essence of the enlightenment-the su- preme wisdom of the Buddha. Clearly, not every depiction of symbols should be read as an aniconic portrayal of the Buddha, but it is equally invalid to deny the existence of an aniconic phase and to main- tain that scenes with symbols should be interpreted either as sacred firthas or as pageantry reenactments of events from the life of the Buddha. The second crucial prerequisite for interpreting the emblems is to acknowledge their multilayered significance. The nonfigural emblem, in narrative presentations, makes simultaneous reference both to the presence of the Buddha and to the truths that his life manifested. Equally, a relief may be read both as an event in the life of the Buddha and as the holy site at which that event occurred. It must be emphasized that the artists working at the early Buddhist sites frequently seem to have intended a conflation of meanings. When the primary intention was to depict an event from the Buddha's biography, the artist often included a reference to the site as a firtha. For instance, the Bharhut scenes of the Buddha's enlight- enment on the Prasenajit pillar, considered below, include a shrine around the bodhi tree that was not built until two centuries after the historical moment of the enlightenment. While the prime intention of this panel was to depict the historical event, the artist's portrayal of the shrine also suggests the holy site. In fact, as explained below, parallel instances of</page><page sequence="2">46 VIDYk DEHEJIA *;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ...... . __~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1 _-_Z-V _ _ -~~~~~~~~~1 . FG .Vsit o ngPaea#ofKsltoS7nButtoHor teBdh,hrut :~~~Cuts mrcnIsitt fIda tde AI) such depictions exist in non-Buddhist contexts too. It is probable that neither the artist nor the early Indian worshipper at Bharhut found anything incongruous in such conflations. Panels with the reverse emphasis also occur: When a wheel is portrayed to suggest primarily the site of the first sermon, it is also surely intended to remind the viewer of the Buddha who preached that sermon at the site. In a similar manner, the attribute and the aniconic portrayal are con- flated: a wheel, intended to indicate the wisdom of the Buddha, also serves to remind the viewer of the Buddha whose wisdom it exemplifies. Through its capacity for multiple reference, the emblem suggests the simultaneity of events that occur at separate times. Significantly, a double layer of meaning appears to inform the greater number of narrative reliefs at Bharhut, Sanchi, and other early Buddhist sites. One such instance of multilayered meaning may be seen on the Prasenajitpillar at Bharhut, in a panel that uses</page><page sequence="3">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS 47 the synoptic mode7 to depict the visit of King Prasena- jit to the shrine he built in honor of the Buddha (fig. 1). It is important to understand that the panel does not depict Sarnath, the site of the first sermon.8 To the lower right is a barrel-roofed gateway from which emerge horse and riders who represent the monarch and his entourage; they are repeated to the lower left as they ride on towards the shrine. On the roof of the gateway is the inscribed identifying label "King Pasenaji of Kosala," which may not be ignored; it suggests the actual historical event in which the monarch visited the Buddha at Prasenajit's capital of gravasti and listened to his sermon. A large barrel-vaulted shrine housing a garlanded wheel surmounted by a garland- ed parasol occupies the larger part of the panel; the two flanking figures probably represent the circum- ambulating monarch rather than two separate wor- shippers. The circumambulation of the shrine build- ing itself is suggested by the placement, on either side, of figures riding horses and elephants. The shrine roof carries the words "Bhagavato dhammacha- ko," or 'Wheel of doctrine of the Holy One,"9 suggest- ing that the intention is to portray the wheel as an object of worship in the shrine erected by King Pra- senajit and to recall the sermon given there rather than to indicate the actual presence of the Buddha. However, the conflation of meanings is inevitable and surely intentional. The shrine was built by King Prasenajit at the spotwhere the Buddha had preached to him; undoubtedly, the artist intended that the relief should also recall that event. As a nonfigural emblem, the wheel emphasizes the Law and also refers to the Buddha as the Giver of that Law. Most early Buddhist visual narratives contain this double layer of meaning. As soon as we accept the validity of such a system, with its accent on the fluidity of mean- ings, and cease to insist upon a single explanation to be applied in every instance, aniconism ceases to be such a vexed problem. It may be advisable first to correct certain miscon- ceptions that have arisen around the problem of aniconism so that we may clearly distinguish the "baby" from the "bath water." Certainly, the oversim- plistic assumption of a HTnayana phase which pro- duced aniconic art, followed by a Mahayana phase which introduced the anthropomorphic icon, must be abandoned. The basic split of early Buddhism into the Sarvastivadin (Hinayana) and the Mahasamghika (from which all Mahayana schools probably devel- oped) occurred prior to the time of Aioka, and the two systems coexisted from an early date. Evidence of such coexistence at around the turn of the Christian era is provided by the inscriptions of Rajuvala (ca. A.D. 1-15) and godasa (ca. A.D. 10-25). Their Kharosthi record on the Mathura lion capital refers to the dedication of a Sarvastivadin stiupa and monastery for the monks of the four directions and to the gift of a vihara to the Sarvastivadins as dhammadana; it con- cludes with a mention of achirya Budhi, "who had knowledge to teach the foremost Mahasamghikas the truth."10 In addition, it is today accepted that Hinayana schools were actively involved in the worship of the Buddha image; in fact, it has been demonstrated that some of the earliest images were Hinayana dedica- tions.11 One such is the ten-foot-tall gravasti image of the Buddha, which, together with its monumen- tal umbrella and shaft, was dedicated in the year 3 of Kanishka by the monk Bala, who was well versed in the Tripitakas. The image was set up in the hall known as Kosambakuti "for possession of the Sarvastivadin Teachers." Hinayana and Mahayana schools12 coexisted for centuries, and both were inter- ested in images; it would be quite incorrect to associ- ate the one with aniconism and the other with the anthropomorphic icon. The differences between them lay in other and more complex realms. The pageantry theory proposed as an alternative to aniconism is riddled with complications; in particu- lar, there is little evidence, if any, that Buddhism had a tradition akin to that of the Christian passion plays, in which events from a sacred biographywere staged.'3 The suggestion that the great departure of the Bud- dha (fig. 2), portrayed on the central architrave %7~~~Z FIG. 2.

In visual terms, if aniconism did not exist, what could possibly have led the artist to avoid portraying upon the horse the human actor who played the part of the Buddha? Why would he have resorted to the extraor- dinary device of portraying a parasol hovering at an appropriate height above empty space over the horse? Equally problematic is the effect of the pag- eantry interpretation on the concept of the expres- sion of Buddhist religious sentiment. It does a disser- vice to the notion of the religious devotion of the many hundreds of monks, nuns, and lay worshippers who contributed towards the decoration of the Sanchi stupa (no less than 631 donative records) to suggest that they would build the immense stone structure and then decorate it merely with pictures of a pag- eant! Surely it was unnecessary to depict the enact- ment of an event when the artist could easily circum- vent that middle step and depict the event itself. The whole purpose of going to a stiipa was indeed to experience the presence of the Buddha through proximitywith his enshrined relic. The inscription on the Bajaur relic casket, dated in the reign of the Indo- Greek King Menander (ca. 140-110 B.C.), speaks of the bodily relics of gakyamuni as praina-samada, or "endowed with life."'5 Recent study of the inscription at the main stuipa at Nagarjunakonda suggests that both monks and lay worshippers considered the es- sence of the Buddha, perhaps even his living pres- ence, to be actually contained within the relic.16 However, the presence of the relic does not thereby preclude the need for stories from the life; in fact, reliving the historic life through viewing narrative sculptures recounting those events would enrich the experience of going to a stiupa. Equally, it is not valid to assume that the prevailing religion during this early period emphasized the perfection of virtues narrated in thejatakas, thereby obviating the need for life scenes. The proposition that the early art of India was not primarily concerned with the biography of the Buddhal7 is difficult to sustain. On the contrary, scenes from the Buddha biography took pride of place in the decorative scheme of the first extensively decorated stiipa at Bharhut. Life scenes were carved primarily on the prominent entrance pillars of the Bharhut railing, where they would be readily seen by those who visited the site. Not a single biographical scene exists on the smaller spaces created by the meandering lotus stem along the Bharhut coping, several feet above eye level, where only]jataka tales are placed. The half dozen or so portrayals of tithas at Bharhut are all to be found sculpted upon the cross- bars of the railing."8 The interpretation of the emblem, with its inherent fluidity of meanings, will be considered under its three valid categories-first as an aniconic presenta- tion of the Buddha, next as a sacred site, and finally as an attribute. Relief panels from Bharhut, Sanchi, Amaravati, and the Gandharan region will illustrate the discussion, although this brief analysis makes no attempt to present a chronological development. The necessary independent treatment of each site will be found in my book-length study of Buddhist visual narratives. The Aniconic Presence A number of panels at Bharhut, some with inscrip- tions of vital importance, provide incontrovertible evidence that the artist is depicting not the site of a great event but rather incidents from the sacred biography in which the Buddha is portrayed in ani- conic form. One such is the story of the Serpent King Erapata, told through the mode of synoptic narrative in three distinct episodes on the central panel of the outer face of the Prasenajit pillar (fig. 3). To the rear of the panel, Erapata emerges from the waters of a river in purely reptilian form with his daughter upon his hood; beside them, also half submerged, is the young brahmin who provides the answer to Erapata's question. The second scene, in the right foreground, depicts Erapata in human form with a snake hood above his head, accompanied by his two queens as they emerge from the waters to go in search of the Buddha. The identifying label "Erapato Nagaraja" is inscribed directly below the serpent king, along the vertical pillar of the band of railing that encloses the scene. Of crucial importance to the interpretation of aniconism is the final episode, which occupies the left third of the panel: Erapata, with hands joined in adoration, kneels in front of a seat beneath a garland- ed tree. To ensure that the viewer is aware of the significance of the seat and garlanded tree as the emblematic presence of the Buddha, the words "Era- palo Nagar7aja Bhagavato Vadate," or "Serpent King Erapata adores the Holy One," are inscribed intru- sively into the visual field, just behind the kneeling figure. It seems difficult to read this inscribed piece of visual narrative as anything other than an instance of the aniconic depiction of the Buddha. A second panel that provides undeniable evidence of aniconism is the visit of King Ajatashatru to the Buddha (fig. 4), narrated in aset of four scenes on the lowest panel of face one of the Ajatashatru pillar. To the lower left, the monarch and his queens ride upon</page><page sequence="5">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS 49 I , I ,, 1,,1 FIG. 3. Sto of Seopent King Erapata, Bharhut.

The third scene, occupying the left rear of the panel, depicts the king and his queens standing with hands joined in adoration while a hanging lamp places the incident in the nighttime hours.19 The final scene to the right rear is crucial to the issue under discussion; it depicts Ajatashatru kneeling before footprints, throne, and parasol. To ensure that the viewer correctly identifies the footprints, throne, and parasol as the Buddha, the artist added the label "Ajatasatu Bhagavato vamdate," or "Ajatashatru bows to the Blessed One," which is inscribed sideways along the pilaster enclosing the panel to the right. It is difficult to misconstrue the artist's intention. Three interrelated panels pertaining to the en- lightenment (fig. 5) on the inner face of the Prasena- jit pillar at Bharhut provide a third instance of ani- conism, in which inscriptional evidence (all of nine epigraphs) confirms the interpretation. The upper- most panel depicts the bodhi tree surrounded by a shrine upon whose roof are inscribed the words "Bhagavato sakamunino bodho," to be interpreted as "enlightenment of the Holy One gakyamuni."20 The throne, which is surmounted by tniratna emblems and stands beneath the bodhi tree encircled by a hypaethral shrine, represents, in this instance, the presence of the enlightened Buddha. The inclusion of a pillar or shrine that was built after the event represented in the relief need not invalidate this identification. First, a double layer of meaning ap- pears to be intended. By including in a scene of the enlightenment the shrine around the tree that was built some time after the event, the artist surely intended that the viewer also recall the sacred site of the bodhi tree at Gaya. Secondly, there are other instances in which artists included later structures in scenes of a life event. In one of these a sixteenth- century artist painted events from the life of the seventh-century Tamil saint Sambandar around the temple tank at Madurai.21 The sacred sites visited by Sambandar in seventh-century Tamilna4u consisted merely of hallowed lingas standing out in the open air beneath trees; the temples that enshrine them were built three hundred years later under Chola rule. The sixteenth-century artist, however, quite happily por- trayed Sambandar visiting temples that never existed during the life portrayed. Temples had become the hallmark of the sites; it probably never occurred to him, nor to the Bharhut artist, that such a portrayal might be considered anachronistic. On the panel immediately below, four sets of gods,</page><page sequence="7">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS 51 separated by the compositional device of a tree, arrive to praise the enlightened Buddha-an event that occurred simultaneouslywith the enlightenment. Confirming the identification are the inscriptions, which identify the gods thus: "in the northern quar- ter, the three [classes of] Savaganisisas," "in the east- ern quarter, the Sudhavasa gods," and "in the south- ern quarter, the six thousand Kamavacharas." There does not appear to be an inscription in the damaged portion of the panel to identify the gods of the western direction, among whom winged figures and nagas are clearly evident. To the far left, disconsolate- ly drawing pictures on the ground with a stick, is the figure of Mara, whom certain texts22 place at the event. Connecting the two panels on a visual level is an elephant-crowned column that rises from the lower into the upper level. The lowest panel, depicting a group of female musicians and four dancing figures, also portrays an event simultaneous with the enlightenment; it repre- sents the heavenly nymphs who in the tradition re- ferred to above23 arrive to honor the enlightened Buddha. The five inscriptions on this panel substan- tiate the identification of the scene. The names Sub- hadra apsara, Padmavati apsara, and Alambusa apsara are inscribed immediately beside three of the danc- ing figures; lack of space apparently required the name of the fourth, Migrakesi apsara, to be engraved along the pilaster that flanks the panel to the right. As a further aid to identification, the sculptor added the caption "music of the gods enlivened by mimic dance," engraving it sideways along the fourth and fifth bands of the railing (from the left) that served as a lower border for the scene. The three panels on this face of the Prasenajit panel thus represent simulta- neous events; they pertain to the enlightenment of the Buddha, as proclaimed by the inscription in the topmost panel, in which the Buddha's presence is indicated by aniconic emblems. Read thus, the pres- ence of the gods of the four directions and of the heavenly apsaras becomes meaningful. A Bharhut medallion that uses the monoscenic mode to tell the tale of Mucalinda naga, who shel- tered the Buddha from a torrential rain storm in the sixth week24 after his enlightenment, provides fur- ther evidence of aniconism (fig. 6). The Buddha's biography recounts that, oblivious to everything around him, the Buddha sat in deep contemplation under a tree, while Mucalinda coiled himself to form a seat for the Buddha, with his multiheaded hood serving as a parasol above the Buddha's head. Mu- calinda, portrayed in purely reptilian form beneath a tree, occupies the larger part of the medallion as he envelops the Buddha, represented by a seat and a pair e - - z !

This seems to be another clear instance of aniconism. The only way to suggest that the medallion represents the spot where the Buddha was sheltered by Mu- calindawould be to propose that the spotwas marked in later days by the image of a serpent enveloping a seat and footprints. But the fact that the serpent image was portrayed sheltering a seat and footprints rather than an anthropomorphic image of the Bud- dha in itself constitutes evidence of a one-time ani- conic tradition. The exact time and place of an event are certainly key indicators of the depiction of episodes from the Buddha's life; firthaproponents maintain that these elements are always explicitly indicated in iconic life scenes but generally absent in aniconic renderings, which are hence, presumably, to be understood as sacred sites.25 It is an interesting exercise to compare two scenes depicting the enlightenment of the Bud- dha-an iconic version from Gandhara (fig. 7) and the aniconic rendering (fig. 8) from Sanchi's west gateway (south pillar, inner face, top panel). The Gandharan panel portrays the Buddha seated in the earth-touching gesture beneath the ptpal tree; the Sanchi panel depicts a seat beneath the tree. Mara's demon armies-some purely animal, others human- ized butwith animal heads-are placed on either side of the Buddha in the Gandharan panel; at Sanchi, the demon armies, animal and humanized, are placed to the right of the Buddha. The Gandharan panel por- trays Mara and his warriors in the foreground, first attempting to confront the Buddha and then having abandoned the attempt; Mara is portrayed once more to the far left, sitting disconsolately in defeat. At Sanchi, the artist chose to portray defeated Mara accompanied by his three daughters, bowing before the Buddha. The Sanchi panel also portrays the gods,</page><page sequence="9">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS 53 e~~~~~~~~ FIG. 8. The Enlightenment, Sinchi west gateway. After Fergusson, Tree and Serpenlt Worship. with their hands raised in a gesture of wonder as they marvel at the events. (The foreground of the Saknchi panel contains an additional detail that precedes the events of the enlightenment; referring to the earlier penance of the Buddha, it portrays three gods hover- ing anxiously over the weakened Buddha.) If place and time are key clues indicating a life scene, both elements occur in the aniconic portrayal at Sanchi. Recent excavations in the Gandharan region, where the anthropomorphic Buddha image appears in great numbers, have yielded a few instances of aniconism. A significant panel from Butkara, now in the museum at Swat, portrays the SaInkissa descent of the Buddha from the heavens (fig. 9). A central ladder displays a pair of footprints upon its lowest rung, while flanking ladders carry standing figures of the gods Indra and Brahma. Kneeling at the foot of the central ladder is the figure of nun Utpala, whom several traditions, including the accounts of Chinese pilgrims Faxian and Xuanxang, view as the first to greet the Buddha upon his descent to earth. Those who deny the exist- ence of aniconism would see the ladders as the actual set of stairs set up at the pilgrimage site of Sankissa, whose one-time existence is attested in the memoirs of the Chinese pilgrims. This, however, conveniently ignores the footprints-depicted both here and on a similar scene from Bharhut26-which suggest that for one reason or another the artist avoided presenting the bodily image of the Buddha.27 Even if the panel represents not the actual event but the pilgrimage site of Sankissa, the portrayal of footprints in place of the bodily image can only suggest a tradition of ani- conism that persisted into early Gandharan art. In this context, one must further query why a Mathura relief of the descent at Sankissa, which portrays an anthropomorphic Buddha on the central ladder flanked by Indra and Brahma on the side ladders, is unhesitatingly accepted as a life scene. After all, Xuanxang's account of the site of Sankissa speaks of an image atop the steps. Why is it suddenly assumed that "depictions of events of the life of the Buddha, as opposed to the pi.thas, became commonplace"2 at the precise stage when the iconic replaces the aniconic? It is instructive, in this context, to consider the many Gandharan representations of the first sermon in which a seated anthropomorphic image of the Buddhareaches out a hand to turn awheel that either t s- *Mo i S ;yt FIG. 9.

The Pali or Sanskrit term for the first sermon helps explain this imagery; the event was known as dharma-chakra-pravartana, or "turning the wheel of the law," which is literally the action of the Buddha. Such panels may also be understood as the anthropomorphic Buddha giving his sanction to the earlier homage paid to the wheel-topped pillar. In several instances, Gandharan sculptors portrayed a standing Buddha figure touching a pillar topped with the triratna, or three jewels-the Buddha, the Dham- ma or doctrine, and the Sanigha or monastic commu- nity (fig. 11). Once again, the Buddha figure is appar- ently giving his sanction to this pivotal emblem of the Buddhist faith. Those who believe in the primacy of emblems may suggest that the anthropomorphic fig- ure derives its validity from the earlier established emblem! The problem of aniconism takes on an engrossing twist in the Amaravati carvings, produced largely at a time when the anthropomorphic Buddha image had been introduced into the art of the northern centers of Gandhara and Mathura. While artists at Bharhut and Sanchi portrayed simple and often single em- blems, those at Amaravati made use of a series of emblems in combination to build up an "emblematic body" for the Buddha. One instance of this system is an Amaravad medallion portraying child Rahula be- ing presented to the Buddha (fig. 12). The footprints, cushioned throne, pillar of radiance, and crowning triratna may indeed be read visually to suggest the feet, limbs, torso, and head of the seated Buddha. The set of emblems stacked visually one above the other suggests a body for the Buddha, albeit an emblematic one. Equally persuasive as examples of this system are Amaravati portrayals of the standing Buddha as an emblematic body. One such, on a now lost railing pillar that narrated a set of incidents from the story of the conversion of the KaAyapas, may be examined in its context from an early drawing pub- lished by Fergusson (fig. 13). The fluted right seg- ment, depicting a group of monks (the converted Kagyapas) following the Buddha to Rajagriha, indi- cates the Buddha's presence by a pair of footprints upon a lotus, a pillar of radiance, and a crowning triratna emblem. Such depictions are not "manifesta- tions of regional pf.thas, the local heritage of which is now lost."29 The emblems are not flanked by worship- pers, lay or otherwise; rather, the manner in which the monks are placed behind the emblems clearly indicates the presence of the walking Buddha, whom the monks are following. Two such standing images, Ii FIG. 13. Buddha azs an "Emblematic Body, 'Amarrivati.

It is intriguing to note that even at the third/fourth-century site of Nagarjunakor,ja, artists produced at least one such emblematic standing Buddha body, which may be seen in a fragmentary piece preserved in the site museum. Sacred Sites Sacred sites, or firthas, and their place in the rite of pilgrimage, are crucial within the Indic religious tradition. The Buddha himself underscored their relevance for both the laity and the monastic commu- nity. A well-known passage from the Mah&amp;parinibbana Sutta states that on his deathbed, when asked by Ananda what the monks should do after his death when they were no longer able to receive his audience or wait upon him, the Buddha replied: There are four places, Ananda, which the believing man should visit with feelings of reverence and awe. Which are the four? The place . . . at which . . . the Tathigata was born ... The place ... at which ... the Tathagata attained to the supreme and perfect insight ... The place ... at which ... the kingdom of righteousness was set on foot by the Tathagata . . . The place ... atwhich . .. the Tathagata passed finallyawayin that utter passing away which leaves nothing whatever to remain behind." The importance of pilgrimage to the sacred spots of Buddhism is undeniable. However, it is questionable whether, in the early Buddhist ethos, pilgrimage to firthas ever took priority over the life of the Buddha and, equally, whether artistic depictions of pilgrim- age sites took precedence over portrayals of events from the life of the Buddha. The imperial pilgrimage of Emperor Asoka (ca. 273-232 B.C.) to thirty-two sacred spots associated with the life of the Buddha, commencing with the birthplace at Lumbini grove and ending with the parinirvana site at Kusinagara, is the archetypal pil- grimage. Importantly, however, Asoka's pilgrimage emphasized the physical form in which the Buddha had lived the life that was being experienced, not merely the sanctity acquired by the site of an event. At Lumbini, the emperor asks a tree spirit who had witnessed the birth- to describe the glory of the in- fant's form: You witnessed his birth and saw his body adorned with the marksl You gazed upon his large lotus-like eyesl You heard in this wood the first delightful words of the leader of mankind! Tell me, goddess, what was it like-the magnificent moment of the Blessed One's birth?31 At Gaya, the emperor requests Serpent King Kalika, who encountered the Buddha immediately prior to his enlightenment, to recount his bodily splendor: You saw my peerless Master his complexion like blazing gold and his face like the autumn moon. Recount for me some of the Buddha's qualities, tell me what it was like- the splendor of the Sugata.32 Their eyewitness accounts, which send Moka into an ecstacy of devotion, stress the person of the Buddha and his charismatic qualities.33 Even in a pilgrimage cycle, the emphasis is on the desire to experience the Buddha himself in all his glory. It is difficult to sustain the argument that early Buddhist artists and ., ,.._,....E E . E F Fi ,, _ _ ,, _ _ _ . , . L FIG. 14. Visit ofEmpmr rAloha to the Bodhi Tree at Gaya, Sanchi.

Courtesy AIIS. devotees were not primarily concerned with the biog- raphy of the Buddha. Artists at Sanchi chose to depict on their monu- ment two momentous events in the life of King Asoka. Perhaps not surprisingly, both revolve around visits to sacred sites-the incident of the bodhi tree and the encounter with the nagas at the Ramagrama stuipa-although neither episode was part of Asoka's Buddhist pilgrimage. There is universal agreement that the lowest architrave of the east gateway at Sanchi (outer face) depicts the pilgrimage of Asoka to the bodhi tree (fig. 14). In order to revive the dying tree, which had been subjected to a curse by his jealous chief queen Tishyarakshita, Asoka is said to have ordered a thousandjars offragrantwater to be poured over its roots. The architrave portrays Moka and his queen to one side and courtiers with jars of water on the other. It is noteworthy that the tree is portrayed surrounded by an elaborate shrine while textual sourc- es, including the Asokavadana, merely speak of build- ing a platform from which the tree could be wa- tered.M4 Those who consider time and place of the utmost importance in the interpretation of a scene might note this instance of a sacred site where the artistwas unconcerned that the shrine did not exist at the moment of this famous pilgrimage. The second Asokan episode at Sanchi, as everyone agrees, is the emperor's visit to the Ramagrama stupa, portrayed on the central architrave (outer face) of the south gate- way. To one side of the stiupa is Asoka in his chariot, while to the other side stand the hosts of nagas, the serpent beings who have been worshipping the stiupa and who dissuaded Asoka from removing the relics in order to redistribute them among the many stuipas he was building throughout his empire. In a certain number of reliefs at Bharhut and Sanchi, the stiupa and pillar represent memorials erected at sacred sites of pilgrimage and clearly do not indicate the presence of the Buddha. One such instance is the worship of a stupa on the west pillar of the north gateway at Sanchi (fig. 15). Here, certainly, is no portrayal of the great decease of the Buddha, which occurred at Kusinara. Instead a group of north- erners dressed in tunics, cloaks, and boots-some</page><page sequence="14">58 VID'k DEHEJIA FIG. 16. Site of Sa-rnW&amp;th Sinchi south gateway. Courtesy AIIS. wearing peaked caps and others with filets bound around their heads-honor a sacred relic mound with music, dance, and offerings. The only clue to the site of this stiipa' is the northern costume of its worshippers. A second instance of the portrayal of sacred sites is represented by two panels, one featuring a pillar (fig. 16) and the other a tree (fig. 17), on adjacent sides of the west pillar of the south gateway. The pillar, with deer clustered at its base and groups of turbaned worshippers on either side, seems to represent the site of Sarnath; the tree circled by a shrine on the adjoining panel indicates the site of Bodh Gaya. In these instances, the pillar is not intended to portray the Buddha's presence and his preaching of the first sermon any more than the tree is meant to suggest the aniconic presence of the Buddha. Their context, within the panel's composition, makes this evident. It is vital to recognize the multivalence of the major Buddhist emblems; in different contexts, they may represent the Buddha, portray sacred sites, or make l! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~2 .4 . _ m-9 -. ' FIG. 17. Site of Bodh Gaya, SAnchi south gateway. Courtesy AIIS. reference to Buddhist attributes. It is significant that the Buddha's words on the importance of pilgrimage, in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta passage quoted earlier, were prompted by Ananda's query regarding the plight of the monks who could no longer serve him or receive his audi- ence. In his reply, the Buddha speaks of pilgrimage for both monks and laity: And there will come, Ananda, to such spots, believers, brethren and sisters of the order, or devout men and devout women, and will say, "Here was the Tathagata borni", or 'Here did the Tathagata attain to the supreme and perfect insightl" or 'Here was the kingdom of righteousness set on foot by the Tathigatal" or, 'Here the Tathagata passed away in that utter passing away which leaves nothing whatever to remain behindl"36 It is strange that lay worship alone should be high- lighted by those who wish to explain emblematic reliefs as portrayals of pilgrimage sites.37 These depictions of lay worship may have occurred by chance in the course of portraying, on each monument, no more</page><page sequence="15">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS 59 than six to eight scenes ofworship. While it is true that the Mahapaninibbhana Sutta entrusts the Buddha's relics to the laity rather than the clergy, recent Bud- dhological studies make it amply evident that the Buddhist ecclesiastic community was closely involved from the very beginning with the relic cult and the stuipa, with cultic practice of every kind, as also with religious giving and with the image of the Buddha.38 The denial of aniconism and the accent on sacred sites make it necessary to address panels from the site of Amaravati (and also Nagarjunakoi)da) that have always been viewed as portraying the birth of the Buddha (fig. 18). These repetitively portray Queen Maya standing under a tree; to one side are her maids, and to the other side are the gods, headed by Indra and Brahma. Upon the swaddling clothes held by the gods are a pair of infant footprints (occasionally seven infant footprints), generally interpreted as evidence of aniconism and representing the event from the sacred biography in which the infant Bud- dha took his first seven steps. Is there an alternate way of interpreting such panels, and could they depict homage at a sacred site? It would be necessary to assume that an image of Queen Maya beneath a'sal tree, flanked by maids and the gods, was set up at an early date at Lumbini, site of the miraculous birth. Of this we have no evidence; certainly the Asokavadana makes no reference to any such images. An additional intractable problem is the presence of the infant footprints. Why would an artist have portrayed foot- prints, rather than a tiny Buddha child, in a group of modeled figures if not because he was constrained by a previous aniconic tradition? Any suggestion of pag- eantry reenactment runs into insuperable problems. Even if such plays were performed, what place do infant footprints, rather than a little child, have in them? Only the theory of aniconism offers a rea- sonable explanation for the large number of such f i ?;8 z ; FIG. 18. Birt of Budda Amargvati.

Indeed, Gandhara provides numerous panels with a similar arrangement of figures, except that the infant Buddha child in anthropomorphic form is now received upon the swaddling clothes held by the gods (fig. 19). No one questions that these Gandharan panels depict the actual birth of the Buddha or suggests that they portray either the sa- cred site of Lunbini or pageantry reenactments of the birth. The obvious compositional similarity of the Gandharan panels to those from Amaravati (and Nagarjunakonrda) reinforces the conclusion that the latter too portray the birth of the Buddha, who, on occasion, is represented at these sites in aniconic form. From Amaravati, a site largely executed after the anthropomorphic Buddha was a known feature in the art of the northern Kushar7 sites, come two por- trayals of actual images, one as a bas relief and one apparently as a metal icon. They are noticed here as possible representations of worship at local sites. Both portrayals come from slabs, some eleven feet high and carved in three registers, that cased the dome of the Amaravati s1tupa. One dome slab, drasti- cally pared down for reuse in modern construction, survives in two registers; the lower is a scene of worship of a now-lost object, while the upper depicts the adoration of a circular medallion with a relief carving of a seated Buddha, placed upon a seat be- neath a bodhi tree, with footprints below the seat (fig. 20). Since the Amaravati stiipa railing itself is re- nowned for its circular carved medallions, the scene appears to represent a local site where one such medallion was worshipped; if that is the case, the artist of the dome slab perhaps added the footprints to reinforce the sanctity of the medallion.

U. P. Shah quotes the canonical Aupapa.tika Siutra's passage on the Pi]rrabhadra Chaitya, which speaks of a prithivi4sila-pagta placed upon a lion throne and resting against the trunk of the best asoka tree in a forest grove; the addition of the word pfithivi (earth) to the sila-patta (slab) suggests to Shah a terracotta plaque.39 The noncanonical Jain text Vasudevahini4i (ca. A.D. 350-450) similarly speaks of a sii of yakisha Sumana, placed upon a platform be- neath an asoka tree, where it was worshipped.40 The second such Amaravati slab, now missing, is known only from an 1816 drawing made by Colonel Macken- zie; it represents the worship of a portable shrine placed beneath a bodhi tree and containing a Buddha icon flanked by attendants (fig. 21). Further studies may clarify the exact significance of these two intrigu- ing site-related portrayals. Attfibutes The third critical aspect in the interpretation of emblems is the recognition that, on occasion, the pillar may represent neither the first sermon of the Buddha nor the site of the first sermon but rather the doctrine that the Buddha enunciated on that FIG. 21.

In like manner, the sacred tree and the seat beneath may indicate neither the event of the Buddha's enlightenment nor the site of Bodh Gaya but the wisdom and supremacy of the Buddha established at that event. Similarly, the stiupa may indicate neither the great decease of the Buddha nor a sacred stupa site but rather the Buddha's achieve- ment in finally severing the bonds of rebirth. Not infrequently, the main intention of the artist depict- ing a pillar, tree, or stiupa was to emphasize the Buddhist truth to which it attests. Such seems to have been the case with the emblems carved on the "dies" or blocks between the architraves of the Sanchi tora- nas, as also on the uprights between architraves. However, due to their capacity for multiple refer- ence, emblems intended to indicate the attributes of the Buddhist faith also serve to remind the viewer of the Buddha himself and of the site with which an attribute is associated. A number of Gandharan panels depict the worship of the Buddha's halo, as also of the tliratna emblem, or threejewels of Buddhism (fig. 22). A declaration of belief in this triple refuge-the Buddha, the Dhamma or doctrine, and the Samgha or monastic communi- ty-is a key expression of commitment to Buddhism. New adherents to the faith would repeat three times their belief in this triple refuge; the formula was chanted repeatedly in Buddhist devotional worship; and Buddhist occasions commenced with its affirma- tion. The great store placed on declaration of belief in this triple refuge is well exemplified by a tale in the DivyMvadana. A minor god, destined to be born from the womb of a sow, was reborn instead in the Tushita heavens by the mere expedient of following Sakra's advice to repeat "I go for refuge to the Buddha, the best of men; I go for refuge to the Dhamma, the best of the destroyers of desire; I go for refuge to the Samgha, the best of orders."41 Gandharan panels cen- tering on the halo, or triratna, depict neither the worship of the Buddha in aniconic form nor worship atanyspecific site; rather they represent homage paid to the Buddhist faith itself through adoration of its attributive emblems. The most impressive use of emblems as attributes is apparent in the decoration of the dome of the Amaravati stiupa (fig. 23). Each of the two hundred and more dome slabs, roughly eleven feet in height and three feet wide, was divided into three registers, and, during the final phase of embellishment of the stipa,42 their design followed a standard repetitive scheme (fig. 24). The lowest register depicts either a tree sheltering a seat or the Buddha himself seated beneath a tree. The central register usually portrays a wheel upon a pillar, although occasionally the I~~~~~~~~~~I FIG. 24. Dome slab with attributes, Amarivati.

The upper register invariably portrays a stuzpa In each register, the emblem, or the image in characteristic pose that replaced the emblem, is flanked by worship- pers. The slabs are completed by a band of running lions and a band of tniratna emblems. The precise interpretation of these dome slabs is crucial to an appreciation of the Buddhist message of the site. On this occasion, the tree or the image beneath the tree represents neither the event of the enlightenment nor the site of the event; the wheel or the preaching Buddha represents neither the first sermon nor its site; and the stiupa stands neither for the great decease of the Buddha nor for a stiupa site. The intention seems to lie in quite another direction. While inextricably connected with the life events of the Buddha and the sites atwhich these occurred, the dome slabs refer to the attributes suggested by the emblems. They repetitively reiterate the belief in the three jewels of Buddhism: the Buddha (lowest regis- ter), the Dhamma or doctrine (central panel), and the Samgha or community of monks (top register).4 For the lay worshippers and the monks circumambulat- ing this large hemispherical monument, the slabs were avisual affilrmation of the formula thatwas upon their lips: "Buddham saranam gacchami, Dhammam saranam gacchiimi, samigham saranam gacchami," or "I take refuge in the Buddha, I take refuge in the Doctrine, I take refuge in the Monastic community." For a group of largely illiterate laymen and laywomen who made the pilgrimage to this great stiupa, a visual reiteration of the creed was an effective means of religious propagation. The upper row of lions may have been intended as a reference to the Buddha as sakyasimha, or "lion of the Sakyas,"while the topmost band of tniratnas serves only to reemphasize the mes- sage of the dome slabs. Conclusion While it is true that Foucher, writing in the first decades of the twentieth century, misstated the na- ture and extent of aniconism, he was certainly accu- rate in perceiving its existence. No doubt, the general correlation of Hinayanawith aniconism and Mahayana with the anthropomorphic image is false. No doubt, too, early scholars did not perceive that certain reliefs on the early Buddhist monuments depict the devo- tions performed at sacred sites. However, denying the existence of aniconism is equally invalid. I argue that an emblem may carry different mean- ings in varying contexts. The worship of a bodhi tree may, in certain circumstances, be interpreted as the enlightenment, and thus a scene in the biography of the Buddha. In other instances it may represent devotions at the site of Bodh Gaya. In yet another context, it merely serves as a reminder of the supreme wisdom of the Buddha. One must accept the multilay- ered significance of many early bas reliefs and recog- nize that more than one meaning may have been intended by the artist, as well as read by the ancient beholder. Twentieth-century analytical viewers may find it strange that a scene portraying the enlighten- ment of the Buddha should include a shrine erected two hundred years after the event. They may also consider it anachronistic that a panel portraying Moka's visit to the site of the sacred bodhi tree should include a shrine built only after the visit. Yet artists and devotees of the first century B.C. probably viewed such a scene as a perfectly reasonable way to present a reminder of both the sacred site at Bodh Gaya and an event in the life of the Buddha or of King Asoka.</page><page sequence="21">ANICONISM AND THE MULTIVALENCE OF EMBLEMS 65 Notes 1.

Strong's statement in The Legend of King Asoka: A Study and Translation of the Aokavadana (Princeton: Prince- ton University Press, 1983), 34, that, according toTaranatha, the poet Matrceta rewrote his hymns in praise of the Buddha in the form of dramatic performances to be staged by troupes of actors is misleading. Tiranltha merely states that Malrceta's stotras, or hymns of praise, were recited even by singers, dancers, and jesters; there is no suggestion of dramatic performances and enactment of plays. See Lama Chimpa and Alaka Chattopadhyaya, trans., Taranatha's His- tory of Buddhism inIndia (Simla: Indian Institute of Advanced Study, 1970), 134. A detailed search through Buddhist texts for any evidence of pageants uncoveredjust one instance- in a tale titled "The Overreached Actor" from Anton Schief- ner's Tibetan Tales, Derived from Indian Sources (London: K. Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp; Co., 1882), which is an English version of selected stories from the Tibetan translation of the original Sanskrit Miulasarvastivadin Vinaya According to the tale, an actor, having acquired the facts of the Buddha's life up to the enlightenment, pitched a booth at Rajagriha and sounded a drum. When a great crowd gathered, he exhibited in a drama the events from the life of the Buddha (p. 244). The tale adds that he made a good profit from this venture. This is intriguing information but certainly not the same as a regular tradition of reenactment of significant events from the Buddha's life. 14. S. Huntington, Art of Ancient India, 99. John Huntington's suggestion ("Sowing the Seeds," pt. 4, 30) that the monkey's offering of a bowl of honey at Vaisali (west pillar of north gatewayat Sanchi) "maybe a reenactment of the event at the site before a group of pilgrims" is even more problematic. 15.

The tree is not included under BODHO. Admittedly, Childers (93, col. 2) gives three meanings for BODHI: the knowledge possessed by a Bud- dha, arhat, etc. (as in BODHO); a Bodhi tree; a precept. It is worth noting that each of the inscribed medallions at Bharhut that depicts the worship of the tree of one of the previous Buddhas (five such medallions survive) uses the term bodhi, while in the case of the Buddha Vessabha, the label specifies bodhi ?ala, or the sila tree (of enlighten- ment). 21.

The Bharhut panel avoids the human form even for the gods Indra and Brahma. Such an avoidance is to be seen in the context of Hindu worship which, in the Vedic period, was concerned onlywith sacrifice and in which images of the gods played no part. Few early images of Hindu deities exist. It was mainly with the spread of Puraqic Hinduism that images of the Hindu gods proliferated. This fact has been largelylostsight of, particularlywith the nineteenth-century projection of Hindu India as a polytheistic country whose multitudes of gods had multiple heads and handst 28. J.

John Huntington's suggestion that this is the Vai?ali stupa is based on the premise that since the monkey incident on the same pillar occurred at Vaisali, all other incidents refer to the same site.

Such a premise, as I shall show in my book-length study, is unjustified: frequently, the Sanchi pillars group together incidents that have no geographical or temporal connec- tion with one another. 36. Davids, Buddhist Suttas, 91. 37. The firthatheory states that the emphasis on sacred pilgrim- age to sites neverwaned. One has to ask, then,whyrepresen- tations of the lay worship of trees, pillars, and stfupas do not occur at Gandhara or Ajarnt or on Gupta monuments. Would not the absence of such emblematic depictions, after the period of the sites of Bharhut, Sanchi, and Amaravati, indicate that emphasis on devotions at sacred sites faded into insignificance, as did the 'exaltation of lay worship"? It is perhaps pertinent to quote here S. Huntington's "Early Buddhist Art," 408, n. 43, in which she takes a less rigid stand on aniconism: "At this time, I am unable to predict whether there are indeed some images that require a Buddha figure and must be seen as truly 'aniconic' in the sense that they employ a symbol as a substitute for what should be an anthropomorphic representation. However, even if a few images are truly aniconic, the vast majority are not, and the role of 'aniconism' has been vastly overemphasized, ulti- mately leading to the misinterpretation of most of the extant art." 38.

While the three registers of dome slabs belonging to earlier work at the site are decorated with a range of themes, including the chakravartin, the great departure, Ramagrama, the enlightenment, and certain unidentified scenes, all later slabs conform to the scheme described. 43. I. K. Sarma (verbal communication), who seems to agree with such an interpretation, informs me that dome slabs recently unearthed at the site reveal the letters bo and dha, for "bodhi tree" and "dhammachakra," presumably inscribed as shorthand notations for sculptors' information. As he rightly pointed out, Garjapati Sthapati, who is in charge of the Sculpture School at Mahabalipuram, similarly writes Nata and Vi upon slabs of stone for "Na.taraja" and "Vish- nu." Why should the stupa stand for the Samgha? I suggest it was because the relic mound was indeed the center of the monastery and the very raison d'etre for the formation of the monastic community that congregated around a stuipa.</page></plain_text>
