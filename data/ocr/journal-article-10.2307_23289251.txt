Prince and Gary Topping Coming out of a history accented with violent persecution from outsiders, Latter-day Saints have responded warmly to members of other faiths who have treated them with even minimal humane consideration, despite disagreeing with their theology. Although Utah history contains many examples of vituperative attacks on Mormonism by members of various other religious groups, partic ularly Protestant, few such attacks came from Roman Catholics, who generally have been content to pursue their own Christian lives and to minister to their own community without attacking the beliefs and practices of others.1 Working from the unusual position of a minority church in predominantly Mormon Utah, Catholics have, with some notable exceptions in the late nine GREGORY A.

Latter-day Saints in Utah, in turn, generally have been cordial toward Catho lics since the pioneer era, when Brigham Young intervened on be half of Father Edward Kelly to resolve a disputed title to Catholic Church property in Salt Lake City.2 In the quarter-century following World War II, however, rela tionships between the two churches were seriously strained on sev eral occasions. The story of those strains and their ultimate resolu tion focuses largely on two church leaders: Duane G. Hunt (1884-1960), bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City, and David O. McKay, president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. David O. McKay (1873-1970), the older of the two men by over a decade, had long harbored deep personal distrust of Catholicism. While McKay's exposure to Catholicism had been minimal in Utah, his service from 1923-24 as president of the European Mission placed him for the first time in countries where it was the dominant church. In 1923 he visited Liège, Belgium, and wrote in his diary, "A Catholic Church celebration was held last night [Saturday]—People drinking and carousing until 6:30 this morning. O what a Godless farce that organization is!"3 As the presiding officer over the Church s European missions, he also saw that the most successful proselytizing efforts spanning nearly a century had come from Protestant England, Scandinavia, Germany, and Switzerland, whose thousands of nineteenth-century converts, including his own grandparents, comprised the majority of territorial Utah's population. In contrast, proselytizing efforts within predominantly Catholic countries had been limited, primar ily to France, Belgium, and Italy, and had been generally unsuccess ful.

Hunt (1884-1960) had been raised a Methodist but left the church of his youth following college and converted to Catholicism. None theless, he never forgot or disparaged his Protestant background and always maintained sympathetic feelings for other churches. Fol lowing law school at the University of Iowa, Hunt moved to Utah in 1913, spent three years on the Speech Department's faculty at the University of Utah, then decided to enter the ministry. After gradu ating from St. Patrick's Seminary in Menlo Park, California, he re turned to Utah where, on June 27, 1920, he was ordained by Bishop Joseph S. Glass in the first ordination held in the Cathedral of Mad eleine in Salt Lake City. Hunt spent the remaining forty years of his life in Salt Lake City, becoming the fifth bishop of Salt Lake City in 1937.5 In 1930, the centenary of the founding of Mormonism, the Catholics leased airtime on Sunday evenings on KSL, the Mormon Church-owned radio station, for a series of addresses by Bishop Hunt to expound the faith of the Catholic minority. While not in tended either as an assault on Mormonism or an attempt to lure Mormons to the Catholic fold, Hunt's addresses were not well re ceived in some Mormon quarters. Nonetheless, the Catholics took the criticism in stride, reporting that the Mormons "have done a good deal of anti-Catholic talking over the radio in recent months, but on the whole they are less intolerant than strongly Protestant communities."6 The first crisis in Catholic-Mormon relations during Bishop Hunt's tenure was precipitated by Father Robert J.

Born and reared in the Avenues neighborhood of Salt Lake City, Dwyer was the first native Utahn ordained in that di ocese (1932). Eventually he became bishop of Reno (1952) and archbishop of Portland, Oregon (1966). An omnivorous reader as a youth, Dwyer was a scholar as well as priest. His 1940 dissertation, written at Catholic University and published as The Gentile Comes to Utah: A Study in Religious and Social Conflict (Washington, D.C.: Catholic University of America, 1941), became a standard work of Utah history; and he contributed regularly to the Utah Historical Quarterly during and after his service as an officer of the Utah State Historical Society. Furthermore, he was a prolific and popular journalist, serving as columnist and editor of a newspaper, the Intermountain Catholic. Dwyer had a less tolerant attitude toward Mormomsm than Bishop Hunt. He grew up as a member of a Catholic minority in a Mormon community where, although official relations between the two churches might have been cordial, individual relations could be testy. Dwyer was an expert on both Mormon history and doctrine; but although he admired the history, he had no use for the theology and found it difficult to confine his acerbic observa tions within the tolerant bounds of Hunt's policy. At this point in 1932, Hunt was a seasoned forty-eight while Dwyer, age twenty four, was rector of the Cathedral of the Madeleine, intermittent ed itor and columnist for the Intermountain Catholic, and a teacher in Catholic schools. The appearance near the end of November 1945 of Fawn McKay Brodie's unflattering biography of Joseph Smith, No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet (New York: Alfred A. Knopf), initially met with a deep silence from offi cial Mormon spokesmen; and while it was being reviewed widely in both popular and scholarly publications around the nation, Mor mon publications, as Brodie's biographer notes, "declined to re view, or even to acknowledge the book's existence for months after its release."7 Eventually, because the book was such a frontal attack on the sincerity of Joseph Smith's claims to revelation, the Church was obliged to speak. It did so obliquely at first in the form of im plied references in speeches by J. Reuben Clark and David O. ^Newell G. Bringhurst, Fawn McKay Brodie: A Biographer's Life (Nor man: University of Oklahoma Press, 1999), 107.</page><page sequence="5">146 The Journal of Mormon History McKay (Brodie's uncle), later in a negative book review published in the Improvement Era by Apostle John A. Widtsoe, and finally dur ing April general conference 1946. In the very last session of the conference, several speakers referred to the book, including Apos tle Albert E. Bowen, who "made a stirring defense of the Prophet Joseph Smith against the poisonous slander of those who would make him out an imposter."8 Looking on from the sidelines, it appeared to Father Dwyer that the depth of Brodie's research and the reasonableness of her interpretations threatened to open up a significant crack between Mormon intellectuals, who would likely find the book convincing, and the rank and file, who were now being lectured into faithful ness by the leaders. Of particular interest to Dwyer was the confer ence address of J. Reuben Clark, who enumerated ten "false doc trines" that he implied were contained in Brodie's book, without naming her directly. Among those doctrines were skepticism about an anthropomorphic God, the supernatural revelations of Joseph Smith, divine assistance in translating the Book of Mormon, and the idea of eternal progress.9 What most caught Dwyer s eye was the apparent unwilling ness of Mormon officialdom to entertain any kind of critical exam ination of Mormon history and scriptures, and its decision instead to insist upon nothing less than rock-solid and literal affirmation of received truth. "Higher education," he observed in his Intermountain Catholic column, "has not proved an unmixed bless ing so far as adherence to simple faith in the sacred writings of the Church is concerned."10 Obviously hoping to widen that crack be tween Mormon officialdom and intellectuals, Dwyer examined some of the central Mormon doctrines showcased by Brodie's book, which he deemed to be among Mormonism's most vulnera 8"Church Leader Refutes Attack on Joseph Smith," Deseret News, April 8, 1946, 7.

In his eagerness, however, he stepped over an invisible line in Mormon-Catholic relations and precipitated outcries of protest not only in the Mormon-owned Deseret News, but even in the Catholic-owned Salt Lake Tribune, which ultimately resulted in Hunt's suspending him for almost four years as editor of the Intermountain Catholic.11 Dwyer's defense of Catholic orthodoxy contained nothing doctrinally new, nor was his column even a sustained examination of Mormon and Catholic differences on the points raised in the conference. Rather, it was the sharpness of the barbs he sent against the Mormon positions that aroused the ire of his readers. Reacting to the conference speakers' insistence on a physical rather than solely spiritual God, Dwyer commented that "by this forthright declaration of belief in a physical deity,... Mormonism definitely places itself outside the realm of rational inquiry and rests its case upon a philosophical impossibility." Moving on to the Mormon assertion that LDS scriptures came directly through Jo seph Smith without human or environmental influence on the fi nal form, Dwyer observed dryly, "Historical criticism thus stands rebuked." To Mormon intellectuals, "the inconsistency of the sa cred books of the Mormon Church with any recognizable critical standards is too flagrant to escape their notice," and "in thus throwing down the gauntlet, Mormonism has inevitably drawn at tention to those features of its teaching that are most clearly irrec oncilable with reason and most violently impatient of critical anal ysis." The Mormon proposition of "eternal progress," that man can progress to godhood, did not escape Dwyer's sarcasm: "Long a favorite apothegm of Mormon orthodoxy, the idea that God is a kind of principle of eternal progress, and that man reflects this progress by following in the wake of an expanding godhead, is de monstrably an intellectual absurdity." Dwyer concluded by ex pressing "pity that so many earnest and zealous men and women, capable both by inheritance and native genius of serving the ad ' ^Dwyer was silently replaced after the December 1, 1946, issue and silently reinstalled with the November 19, 1950, issue.

The Mormon response in the Deseret News began by nibbling around the edges of Dwyer's indictment, pointing out such minor er rors as referring to the annual conference as "semiannual" (techni cally, the April conference was "annual" and its October counterpart was "semiannual"), and criticizing Dwyer's article as "lack[ing] a bit in ... ecclesiastical courtesy" by referring to President J. Reuben Clark as "Mr. Clark" or "Reuben Clark." More to the point, the response indi cated that the rise of heresy in any church is likely to cause "consterna tion" and that any time a church encourages higher education it is likely to encounter skepticism. Regarding Mormonism's "philosophi cal impossibility," the writer asserted an essential incompatibility of religion and philosophy, so that most religious doctrines seem impos sible to the secular mind, and most miraculous interventions in hu man affairs, like Moses's reception of the Ten Commandments, elude critical evaluation. Finally, the writer asserted that, to the rest of the religious world, the Catholic attention to transubstantiation, confes sion, relics, and such things appear as futile as Mormons' concern over their own unique doctrines.13 The Salt Lake Tribune, then edited by John F. Fitzgerald, pub lished an indictment of Dwyer's article titled "Ill-Timed, Ill-Natured and Very Ill-Advised Criticism of a Christian Conference." This edi torial was both less lengthy and less temperate than the article in the DeseretNews. Accusing Dwyer of Pharisaical superiority in condemn ing another religion, it appealed, rather oddly, to patriotism rather than reason. Its basic point was that, during the time of postwar healing, Americans should stand united in the interest of what it called "the future of the world and the perpetuation of the race" rather than indulging "the narrow opinions of any intolerant egotist or illiberal religionist with a sanctimonious complex."14 Apparently Dwyer accepted the Deseret News response as merely a restatement of Mormon philosophical positions and a further ex ^Robert J.

It was, in stead, the Tribune rebuke that aroused his ire. In an Intermountain Catholic editorial, he attacked the "purely negative secularism which holds that all religious controversy... is necessarily reprehensible." In such a secular view, disagreement over politics, economics, sociology, or almost anything else is permissible, but "religion is taboo." Scoring heavily against his patriotic critic, Dwyer reminded him that freedom of religion had been one of Franklin D. Roosevelt's Four Freedoms, for which the country had recently fought, and argued that "the idea that fraternity should be played up at the cost of playing down honest creedal disagreements" was inimical to "the true advancement of reli gion in a democracy. ___ »15 The rest of the column seemed directed more to the eye of Bishop Hunt, his religious superior, than to a general audience. Al though the bishop had enjoined his priests to turn the other cheek in response to attacks on Catholic teachings, he himself, after all, was a vigorous defender of the faith when the occasion presented it self, particularly when Catholic doctrines were attacked by the Mor mons. Did editorship of the diocesan newspaper entail the authority for Dwyer to engage in similar polemics? A concomitant question was whether Dwyer had initiated the debate or merely responded to provocation. Ultimately only the bishop could decide the first ques tion, but Dwyer had his own answer to the second. "Provocation," he began, "is a relative term. ' It included, to his mind, not only instances of specific attack, but also long-term promul gation of offensive ideas, either of which could justify rejoinder. "Open denial of the divinity of Christ is provocative to the Christian; not less so is the frank avowal of doctrines concerning the nature of the Godhead which are viewed as irreconcilable with the Christian revelation," Dwyer continued. Although he concluded with an apol ogy to any persons he may have offended, or if he had "allowed acer bity to sharpen his comments," it is hard not to regard his words as dis ingenuous.

Further, Dwyer's stretching of the elastic clause he thought he could find in the semantics of prov ocation was nothing less than carte blanche to attack Mormonism whenever he chose and meant nothing less than the onset of the kind of warfare between Catholics and Mormons that had plagued much of Protestant-Mormon relations and which Bishop Hunt had been at pains to avoid. Finally, it would be difficult not to see acerbity in the tone of his initial comments on the conference. "Consternation" there was aplenty among the conference speakers, but Dwyer was well aware that Brodie, for the moment at least, had them down. Thus, he had shown himself as not above adding a kick or two of his own. Dwyer concluded his article by expressing his willingness "to take his chance with the considered judgment of time and posterity." Posterity, to this point at least, has rendered the silent judgment of amnesia, but Bishop Hunt took little time to render his: On Decem ber 1,1946, Dwyer's name silently disappeared from the masthead of the diocesan paper, and it would be almost four years before it reap peared. There was an immense love and a deep respect between the two men, apparent to those who knew them and lingering in their reputations; but the amicable relations between the two churches, now rendered fragile, needed protection; and for the moment, Dwyer's services were otherwise used as rector of the cathedral and as a teacher at Judge Memorial High School The next crisis in Catholic-Mormon relations occurred only a few months later. Injanuary 1948, J. Reuben Clark, first counselor to LDS Church president George Albert Smith and de facto presi dent due to Smith's failing health, began a series of Sunday night radio addresses on KSL Radio, in which he affirmed the core ten ets of Mormon doctrine. At the same time, in a commendable ges ture, the station made Sunday night airtime available gratis to Bishop Hunt. Hunt did what Clark did, reaffirming the core beliefs of his own church. Clark, however, misinterpreted Hunt's ad dresses on the primacy of the Pope and the Holy See in Rome as an assault on Mormonism, and wrote in his diary, "Bishop Hunt seemed to have declared war."16 But it was Clark who waged the war. Speaking to his Catholic friend John F. Fitzpatrick, publisher of the Salt Lake Tribune, he asked a rhetorical question: "What 16J. Reuben Clark Jr., Office Diary, February 25, 1948, quoted in D.</page><page sequence="10">Prince and Topping/Catholic-Mormon Relations might be the situation if we went to Rome and applied for time over the Vatican station and they gave us the time for nothing . . . and then we proceeded to lambast the Catholic Church over their own station on the time which they had given us?"17 The printed texts of Hunts radio addresses, however, belie Clark's charges. While he sometimes addressed doctrines over which Mormons and Catholics disagree, like the apostolic continuity of the Catholic Church, he did so in the context of sermons on basic Catho lic teachings, never as an isolated jab at Mormonism and never with any reference to Mormon teachings at all.18 Thus, one can appreciate Hunt's genuine astonishment when Fitzpatrick reported Clark's in dictment: "Oh, God forbid. Do you mean that?"19 When Fitzpatrick assured Clark that he had misread Hunt s in tentions, Clark, unimpressed, did not change his view that Hunt had, indeed, declared theological war upon the Mormons. By early March, Clark was shaping his own radio addresses to include direct attacks on core Catholic beliefs. He also began to write an anti-Catholic polemic that he included as a 220-page appendix in a book containing the ra dio addresses, which was published the following year."0 He also made no secret of his antagonism toward the Catholic Church. A mi nor incident became, in his eyes, an occasion of offense. While KSL was doing some remodeling, Monsignor Jerome Stoffel, who occa sionally substituted for Hunt in giving the radio addresses, was moved from the cramped studio that Hunt normally used to the spa cious one used by Clark. After giving one address, he left the studio just as Clark was entering it to give his own address. Clark did not greet him, but instead glowered at him as if to say, "What in the hell Michael Quinn, Elder Statesman: A Biography of J.

The seventy-five-year-old McKay was, at this time, second coun selor in the First Presidency, and thus subordinate to Clark. Though not yet directly involved in the Clark-Hunt dispute, he clearly sided with Clark. After meeting with a group of stake presidents in Ogden early in 1949, he wrote, "Another question that came up was the seeming determination of the Catholics to convert as many Mormons here in the West as they possibly can. There is no doubt but that there is an organized campaign on in this respect."2- Only two weeks later, he came into direct contact with Bishop Hunt over another matter, and its affable resolution was typical of McKay's mixed feelings of genuine benevolence and cooperation toward individual Catholics, whether laity or clergy, but distrust and even animosity toward the church to which they belonged. At issue was an editorial in the Salt Lake Tribune pertaining to the high divorce rate in Utah. A Mormon friend of McKay, disturbed over the editorial, felt that it was unfairly—albeit only indirectly—criti cal of the LDS Church. He voiced his concerns to Hunt who, feeling somehow implicated in the editorial, called McKay to clarify the situa tion. McKay assured him that he did not share his friend's feeling and affirmed that he felt the newspaper had the right to publish any facts and "to comment on anything that is News." Appreciative of the re sponse, "Bishop Hunt then said he thought when anything like this comes up that it is better to get in touch directly; that he did not want any misunderstanding."23 In spite of the good personal feelings resulting from that ex change, McKay took aim at Hunt's institution several months later. While meeting with local LDS leaders in Idaho, "I admonished them to be on their guard against the attempted inroads of the Catholic Church."24 One month later a pamphlet written for Utah Catholics and intended to raise money for under-funded Utah parishes inadver tently caused a skirmish that escalated nearly into theological warfare. 21Msgr.

Steck, Hunt's assistant in early 1949, documented the impoverishment of the Cath olic Church in many areas of Utah. Only fifty-two priests were as signed to Utah, an area of nearly 85,000 square miles; six of the state's twenty-nine counties had only one priest; and sixteen counties lacked any priest at all. Steck requested donations to support the training of additional priests and the construction of more parochial schools (there were only three in the entire state) and churches. He also called for a Catholic center in Salt Lake City, as there was no adequate place for Catholic youth to gather socially. The pamphlet made no mention of the LDS Church or Mormon beliefs and carried no suggestion or implication of proselytizing among non-Catholics within Utah. How ever, it was entitled "A Foreign Mission Close to Home!" and therein lay the problem, a problem that Steck, a St. Louis native with no un derstanding of Mormon vernacular, likely did not even sense.25In Catholic usage, and certainly in the context of the pamphlet, mission meant a rudimentary parish incapable of sustaining itself financially. In the LDS lexicon, mission was used only in the context of proselytiz ing. A Mormon who saw the pamphlet without reading its contents could thus have easily concluded that it was the first foray of a new ini tiative to lure Latter-day Saints away from their own faith. One such Mormon was David O. McKay. Speaking to local Church leaders in his hometown of Huntsville, "I presented to them the avowed activity of the CATHOLIC CHURCH here in Utah, and called their attention to a leaflet that designates Utah as 'a foreign Mission close at home.'"26 Apparently McKay was not the only Mormon to react in this way. When Bishop Hunt found that the pamphlet had been widely misin terpreted by the Mormons, he was both hurt and enraged. On the same day that McKay spoke to the leaders in Huntsville, Hunt wrote to his friend John Fitzpatrick, publisher of the Salt Lake Tribune and one of Utah's most prominent lay Catholics, venting his frustration and anger: I cannot resist the temptation to get a few things off my chest. I re fer to the pamphlet published by Bishop Steck this winter and which ^Leo J. Steck, "A Foreign Mission Close to Home!" (n.p., 1949).

There is absolutely no reason why anyone of any other church should pay the slightest bit of attention to this pamphlet. It contains not one iota of propaganda against any one else; it does not complain about any one else. It calls attention to a few priests in this Diocese who need financial assistance and of some of our poor missions. It was sent to Catholics only. . . . That anyone should be disturbed about this pam phlet of Bishop Steck's is wholly unreasonable. It makes me furious. Some day our Mormon neighbors will wake up to the fact that my re gime represents the high point in the effort of the Catholic Church to be cordial. . . . To all of [our Utah priests] I give the same advice. "Never criticize any other church or its people; confine yourself exclu sively to the Catholic religion." I have forbidden priests to reply to at tacks made against us on the radio by prominent Mormons.

I must wait until I have cooled off.27 Things then went from bad to worse. Under direction from McKay and his colleagues in the First Presidency,28 Apostle Mark E. Petersen, who was also editor of the LDS Church-owned Deseret News, initiated a series of meetings with local LDS Church leaders through out the Salt Lake Valley. Petersen asserted that "a powerful church is mustering all possible strength from all over America for an intensi fied and concentrated attack on us."29 Leaving no doubt about the identity of that church, he charged: About six years ago the authorities of the [LDS] church began to hear of Catholic movements in the east to raise funds for carrying on a campaign in Utah.... Bishop D. G. Hunt of the Salt Lake diocese had 2^Duane G. Hunt, Letter to John F. Fitzpatrick, August 28, 1949, Duane G.

Loss of Mormons to the Catholics in Utah was mentioned. We recognize their right to proselyte, but they will not recognize our right to do so if they ever gain the upper hand.30 While these meetings were on-going, Hunt sent word to McKay through a mutual friend (identity not known) that he wished to speak with him personally in an effort to resolve the crisis. McKay re sponded, through the same intermediary, that he "should be glad to make a convenient time when he might see me."31 The meeting took place at Holy Cross Hospital where Hunt also had an office. He explained that the sole purpose of the pamphlet had been to raise funds to continue the Catholic Church's ministry to its own members in Utah but that it was clearly being misinterpreted by both Catholics and Mormons. "When we found out that our own people objected to it, and that your people especially had objected to it, we discontinued the distribution of the pamphlet." McKay replied, "We received a copy, it seems to me, only six weeks ago.... Naturally we were perturbed." "Well," said Bishop Hunt, "Catholics all over the United States are. I am very sorry; I hope you will believe me." He went on to explain the different meaning of "mission" in the Catholic context. McKay responded, "I rather think, Bishop, that the people of the United States would not have that distinction in mind, because it says on the pamphlet, 'A Foreign Mission Close to Home.'" Hunt ac knowledged McKay's point by saying, "I realize that it would be hard for me to make you believe otherwise," to which McKay replied, "I be lieve it would be hard to make anybody believe otherwise." Despite McKay's stiffness on this point, Hunt finally succeeded in convincing him that the Catholics were not conducting a proselytizing campaign in Utah, and McKay said he would carry that message to his associates in the First Presidency. Hunt then reassured McKay that he was a voice of moderation within the Catholic Church in Utah: I have been attacked recently by our Priests because the report has gone out that the Mormons are attacking the Catholics in Utah, ''"Minutes of a meeting held in the Tenth Ward Chapel, October 13, 1949, Hunt Papers. 3 ' McKay, Diary, October 7, 1949.</page><page sequence="15">156 The Journal of Mormon History and that I, as the Bishop, am doing nothing in retaliation, and I am not doing anything, and I do not propose to do anything.

There is a feeling throughout the United States (this is from our side now) that the Latter-day Saints are perse cuting the Catholics and are going to drive them out of the city, and they blame me for doing nothing about it. McKay indicated with some skepticism that ' we understand that he [Steck] is especially skilled in missionary work, and that is why he has been sent to Utah." Hunt replied, "No, he isn't a missionary; that is not his work."32 Still the meeting ended amicably and Hunt fol lowed up with a personal letter to McKay, in which he sought to clarify the matter further: The attitude of the Catholic Church in Utah toward other Churches during this year has been and is precisely what it was last year and what it has always been. Our primary objective here as else where is to safeguard the faith of our people and to administer the Sacraments to them. A secondary objective is to win converts. These come into the Church because they are attracted by some doctrine or devotion, never as the result of a direct approach by a priest, and never as the result of an attack upon the religion of their youth. We preach our doctrines openly so that those who are interested may hear. We give out literature explanatory [of] our doctrines to those who ask for it. Such have been our methods in the past; such are our methods now. In other words and in summary, the disturbing pam phlet has not meant any change in our program or policies. In no way was it intended to affect our attitude toward Protestants and Mor mons or our relations with them. It was intended merely as the means of raising additional revenue for a few of our priests whose people cannot fully support them.33 Finally satisfied, McKay responded more warmly: I am glad that I accepted your cordial invitation to have a per sonal conference with you on the question of the purpose of your having issued this objectionable pamphlet. ... As I have already stated to you, when the leaders of the Church first read this appeal 32McKay, Diary, October 12, 1949. 33Duane G. Hunt, Letter to David O.

With this thought in mind, we took immediate steps to inform our people of what appeared to be an approaching campaign planned by the Cath olics for the specific purpose named above. Your letter sets forth conclusively that there was no such intent, that there has been "no at tack upon others," nor "any change in policies" of the Catholic Church here in Utah. Thank you for setting forth so clearly your atti tude in this matter.34 In retrospect, it seems clear that McKay and his colleagues badly and unfairly misinterpreted the pamphlet and subsequently took un warranted and damaging action in retaliation. Hunt was justified in his initial feelings and showed commendable integrity and charity in initiating the healing process. McKay accepted Hunt's explanation, but with obvious reluctance. A double standard was in effect, but never entered into the discussion. That is, McKay and his colleagues were vehemently opposed to any attempt by the Catholics to prosely tize within Utah, yet made no apology about sending thousands of LDS missionaries to Catholic strongholds within the United States and foreign countries, with the expressed intent of converting Catho lics to Mormonism. Ultimately, McKay did exactly what he had hy pothesized to Hunt, taking Mormonism to the gates of the Vatican when he reopened the Italian Mission after a hiatus of a full century.35 However, the Mormon-Catholic entente cordiale constructed by Hunt and McKay held firm for several years. Shortly after McKay be came Church president, he visited Holy Cross Hospital to perform a blessing of healing for a young LDS patient afflicted with polio. As he entered the building, he encountered Bishop Hunt, who greeted him cordially and introduced him to the Sister Superior.36 A year later, Hunt wrote a letter with directions that it be read at Sunday Mass in every parish in the diocese. The letter touched delicately on Catho lic-Mormon relationships and urged Catholics to be good neighbors under all circumstances: 34McKay, Letter to Duane G. Hunt, November 7,1949, Hunt Papers. 35The Italian Mission was reopened during McKay's administration on August 2, 1966.

Never deny your faith. Never apologize for it. State frankly that you are Catholics.

Love God and neighbor. Keep your minds and hearts free from the bitterness of religious controversies.37 Several months later in February 1953, McKay paid a high pliment to Hunt in speaking to local LDS leaders in Ogden: I shall always respect Bishop Hunt and what he did the other day. Before I went to California, he asked for an appointment, came to the office, and said, "Frankly, we are contemplating building a high school up in Ogden. ... I understand that if Weber College vacates the buildings on that block, some of them come back to you, but I think that this one is not included. I am here for the purpose of ascer taining whether or not you want that building. If you do, we will with draw." ... Without hesitation, I said, "We want it." He said, "Then we will withdraw."38 The following year, McKay visited Brazil, with the largest Catho lic population in the western hemisphere. While in Rio deJaneiro, he walked up the hill of Corcovado, to the magnificent statue of Christ, "Cristo Redentor," that overlooks the city. "When he got up there and saw the statue with the arms outspread, he recited that verse, 'Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.' 3^Hunt, undated circular letter, "My dear People," Hunt Papers.

In 1953 he visited San Mateo, Califor nia, to dedicate a new LDS chapel. As he and his host drove past a Catholic Church whose congregation was exiting after Sunday Mass, he said, "There are two great anti-Christs in the world: Communism and that church," pointing to the Catholic Church. "Then," re counted his host, "he put his hand on my knee and said, 'Remember that.'"40 The following year, an advertisement appeared in the Wall Street Journal, soliciting funds for the construction of a new abbey at the Catholic monastery in Huntsville. The monastery had been founded in 1947 by the Trappist Order, which had selected the property be cause its isolated rural setting favored the monastic lifestyle. The fact that Huntsville was McKay's hometown was unrelated, and the mon astery never engaged in proselytizing. Still, McKay interpreted the fund-raising campaign for the abbey as part of "their campaign to convert Latter-day Saints." Speaking at a meeting of the First Presi dency and Quorum of the Twelve, he reiterated his statement of a year earlier: It is more apparent than ever, becoming more apparent each day, that two great organized forces, the purpose of which is to under mine the high principles of the Restored Gospel, are operating. One is Communism, which is moving aggressively over the face of the earth, fundamentally prompted by disbelief in the existence of God, a rejection of the life of Jesus Christ as the Savior of the world, and is against the Church. The other is the Catholic Church, which is show ing more clearly than ever before that they are determined to coun teract the influence of the Church in this western country.41 At the same time he was maintaining a critical attitude toward Catholicism, McKay continued to look favorably upon other 39Asael Sorensen, interviewed by Gregory A.

Within weeks of establishing a policy discouraging LDS girls from wearing crosses because "this was a Catholic form of wor ship,"42 he received a gift of a "Chrisma" charm, which combined the Byzantine Cross with the Star of David to symbolize "the essential unity of the world's great faiths." The same day, "I took the charm down to my son, owner and manager of the McKayJewelry Shop and asked him to attach a pin to the charm so that I can wear it on my lapel when I so desire."43 Later the same year, he spoke with Ezra Taft Benson, who was serving simultaneously as Secretary of Agriculture to U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and as an LDS apostle. Benson was about to embark on a world tour that would include a stop in Rome, and the American ambassador there had suggested that a meeting with the Pope could be arranged. McKay told Benson, speaking for the First Presidency: "We are all united in the feeling that if you can in honor, and without embarrassment, avoid that conference it would be well for you to do it... . We have in mind particularly the effect upon our own people.... [The Catholics] have everything to gain and nothing to lose, and we have everything to lose and nothing to gain."44 A week later, upon learning that the Trappists in Huntsville were seeking to buy additional land, he remarked to his fellow General Authorities, "The Catholic Church is against us, and wherever they can prevent our growth they are going to do it."4° However, in 1958 one of McKay's colleagues unwittingly initi ated a series of events that ultimately led McKay to abandon his pri vate diatribe against Catholicism. Bruce R. McConkie, a member of the First Council of Seventy, the Church's third-ranking presiding quorum, wrote an encyclopedic work that carried the authoritative ti tle of Mormon Doctrine but which was published in July 1958 without the consent or knowledge of his fellow General Authorities, including McKay and McConkie's father-in-law, senior Apostle Joseph Fielding Smith.46In spite of its title, the book was filled with erroneous state ments. McKay, infuriated when he learned about the book, asked se nior apostle Mark E. Petersen to review the work for accuracy; 42McKay, Diary, April 29, 1957. 43McKay, Diary, May 20, 1957. 44McKay, Diary, October 2, 1957. 45McKay, Diary, October 10, 1957. 4®Smith, president of the Quorum of the Twelve, succeeded McKay</page><page sequence="20">Prince and topping/Catholic-Mormon Relations Even before McKay saw the book himself, he reacted to reports from his colleagues by instituting a policy (which remains in effect to this day) requiring advance approval before a General Authority can publish any book.17 In addition to studying the book himself, McKay quickly assigned Mark E. Petersen and Marion G. Romney, both se nior apostles, to review the book for accuracy and to report their find ings to him. In addition to their oral reports, Petersen also submitted a written report listing 1,067 errors affecting "most of the 776 pages of the book."48 Among their criticisms, and of greatest concern to others, was McConkie's treatment of Catholicism. The dictio nary-style definition under the heading "Catholicism" read "See Church of the Devil," and under "Church of the Devil," he minced no words: "The Roman Catholic Church specifically—singled out, set apart, described, and designated as being 'most abominable above all other churches."'49In support of his allegation, he cited a passage from the Book of Mormon (1 Nephi 13:5). It does not name Roman Catholicism—understandably since the writer, Nephi, left Jerusalem in 600 B.C.—but earlier LDS leaders going back to the LDS Church's founding had not hesitated to make the connection. None, however, had done so as blatantly as McConkie, and the instant popularity of his book meant that the insult to Catholics rapidly became a high-profile issue. Bishop Duane Hunt, having enjoyed several years of peace with his Mormon neighbors, was stunned. Immediately after the 1958 gen eral election in November, he paid a courtesy visit to newly elected Congressman David King to congratulate him on his victory, yet the experience was bittersweet for both men. Hunt carried a copy of McConkie's book; and with tears in his eyes, he said to King, a devout Mormon, "We are your friends. We don't deserve this kind of treat ment!"50 Hunt also took the matter directly to McKay. Robert L. Simpson, who learned about the episode when he became a General Authority in 1961, reminisced, "I know the Catholic Bishop at the as Church president in 1970. He told McKay that he "did not know anything about it until it was published." McKay, Diary, January 7, 1960. 47McKay, Diary, February 6, 1959. 48Ibid., January 7, 1960. 49Bruce R.

And President McKay had a feeling for him, and even went so far as to have Brother McConkie change a line or two in his Mormon Doctrine book that would have seemed a little hard on the Catholic Church at the time."51 McKay's son Lawrence was even more direct in describ ing his father's reaction to Hunt. "[Bishop Hunt] called Father and said, 'Is this the attitude of the Church, that the Catholic Church is the 'Great and Abominable Church,' as expressed in this latest book of Bruce McConkie's?' That book was taken off the shelves."52 Unfortu nately, neither Hunt nor McKay left a written record of their conversation. In the aftermath of the enormous embarrassment caused to the Church and to himself by McConkie's book, McKay quietly aban doned his private criticism of Catholicism for the remaining decade of his life. He had come to realize that Bishop Hunt was a true friend without a hidden agenda, and he valued that friendship greatly. In a note to Hunt following the funeral of McKay's counselor, Stephen L Richards, McKay wrote: "When, from the rostrum I saw you and my esteemed friend, John F. Fitzpatrick, sitting in the audience, paying tribute of respect to my departed friend and associate, Stephen L Richards, I wanted to shake your hands in personal appreciation. Thank you for your attendance at Stephen L's funeral rites."53 In addition to coming to terms with Hunt, McKay realized that the Catholic Church was not a threat to the LDS Church in Utah nor, for that matter, to the vitality of international Mormonism, whose emergence was the centerpiece of McKay's entire ministry as Church Hunt himself left no record of this incident or of his subsequent meeting with McKay. King apparently took no action as a result of this incident. r&gt; 1 Robert L. Simpson, interviewed by Gregory A.

Conversely, despite occasional skirmishes at a local level and successful LDS proselytizing among Catholics, particularly in Latin America, Mormonism never posed a strategic threat to Catholi cism. Indeed, in recent years the two churches have formally joined forces on occasion to pursue moral issues within the political arena and, more frequently, to work together on charitable ventures. Less than a year after the death of Stephen L Richards, as McKay and his fellow General Authorities were leaving the Salt Lake Temple following a meeting, they were saddened to hear the news of the sev enty-six-year-old Hunt's death. McKay prepared a statement for the lo cal newspapers that conveyed genuine respect for Hunt, and grief at his passing: "We are deeply grieved at the sudden passing of this emi nent and devoted leader of the many loyal and law-abiding members of the Catholic Church of the diocese of Salt Lake City. He gave to them the spiritual guidance that helped them to shape their lives in accordance with the teachings of his Church. They have lost a trusted and respected adviser."54 Beyond the words of written tribute, McKay paid unprece dented respect to Hunt by attending his funeral mass at the Cathedral of the Madeleine. It was the first high mass McKay had ever attended. "At the conclusion of the funeral services at 12 noon, the new Bishop, The Most Rev. Joseph Lennox Federal, came out on the steps of the Cathedral to greet President [Henry D.] Moyle and me, and to thank us for coming to the services. I was very favorably impressed with him."55 Federal, in turn, was very favorably impressed with McKay. A decade later he reciprocated the gesture by attending McKay's fu neral. Then, as the cortege passed the Cathedral of the Madeleine on its slow, sad journey along South Temple Street to the Salt Lake City Cemetery, he ordered the bells tolled in a final demonstration of re . 56 spect. 5/1 McKay, Diary, March 31, 1960. 55McKay, Diary, April 5, 1960. 56The new First Presidency expressed its appreciation to Bishop Fed eral for this "gracious, thoughtful courtsey" in a letter dated January 28, 1970, Joseph Lennox Federal Papers, Archives, Catholic Diocese of Salt Lake City.</page></plain_text>
