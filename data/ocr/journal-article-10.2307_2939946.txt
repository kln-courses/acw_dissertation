AUGUST 26, 1920 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS THE PLACE OF LIFE IN NATURE1 1T is a peculiarity of our status as self-conscious beings, whose existence and activities are bound up with the special form of material organization called vital, that life appears to us as the cen- tral and all-important fact of nature. The qualities of living beings are always present to our attention. In most of us the feelings of activity, energy and spontaneity are strongest when organic life is strongest-when we are most "alive;" the popular meaning of the word vitality comes from this fact; and the naive tendency has al- ways been to ascribe a special freedom or originative capacity to life, and to regard the non-living part of nature as something radically different from the living, as something inferior-or basely mechan- ical. But obviously this view, as the product of prepossession rather than reasoning, can have no scientific or evidential value in relation to the problem of the place of life in nature. Most of us can remem- ber wondering as children at the absurd self-importance of inferior animals like house-ffies; later on we find that this curious self-re- garding attitude of living beings is simply one of their general or "class" characteristics, shown even by plants. It would appear therefore that when man-who is certainly not the least egoistic of the animals-assigns to life a position of central importance in the cosmos, he may be merely furnishing another example of this natural propensity, which has its biological origin in the inherently self-con- serving or self-protecting tendency common to all organisms. This property is a necessary condition of organic survival; it is an ex- ample of what is called an "organic regulation" and even has its analogies in various automatically regulated mechanical devices. We must face the possibility that in reality life has no unique or privileged position in nature, but is merely one out of the many purely casual and inessential results of the operation of blind nat- ural forces. At least a biocentric conception of the cosmos must 1 Paper read at a meeting of the Royce Club, Harvard University, April 11, 1920. 477</page><page sequence="2">478 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY justify itself on other grounds than those of the instinctive human prejudice. I propose this evening to discuss the question of how life is re- lated to the rest of nature, the greater part of which is non-living in the usual understanding of the term. How is this peculiar and spe- cial development which we describe as living to be derived from a cosmos which close observation shows to be subject everywhere to rigid determination by mechanical and mathematical laws? What, then, is the essential relation of life to the cosmos? In earlier times mankind regarded the world and its inhabitants as something emanating from life, as created and sustained by the volition of a living deity or deities, and as subject to more or less arb.itrary divine-or sometimes diabolical-intervention; life was the primal cause or originating condition of things; the deity breathed into his creations the breath of life; by this action some- thing not previously present was added to nature; in a word, the source of life was "supernatural." How far we have travelled from this naive belief in these scientific days I need scarcely remind you. To most of us, especially biologists, life is not a primitive but a co-m- paratively recent and derived phenomenon, one product of the evo- lution of a cosmos which at first was entirely non-living; in the temporal or historical progress of nature complex or "heterogene- ous" systems, including finally life, by degrees emerged from the originally indefinite or homogeneous primordium (to paraphrase Spencer); life as thus conceived is not a primary agency, but a sec- ondary and somewhat -exceptional derivative of the natural process. This view seems now firmly based on naturalistic observation; and in fact it is usually regarded as a summarized objective description of what has actually happened during the past several million cen- turies. The question of whether or not to accord primacy to life is per- haps not one to be settled by observation alone. When we view cosmic events in their historical suecession it seems certain that life is a later rather than an e.arlier appearance in nature; there is no doubt that the physical conditions on the globe were incompatible with the -existence of living matter until a comp.aratively late stage of planetary evolution. But the argument from the geological suc- cession of life on the earth is an equivocal one and not decisive, since its opponents may well reply that the very appearance of life at a certain stage implied its previous latency; how otherwise in a mechanistically controlled world could it ever have come into exist- ence? The character of the dilemma is evident; in any physico- chemical view of natural evolution the causal chains extend back</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 479 indefinitely and uninterruptedly; whatever appeared at any time or place in the sequence was in this sense predetermined-had a series of mechanistically interconneoted events leading up to it. The ref- erence to preexisting causes thus stretches back ad infinitum, and whatever existed at any time, however remote, must be referred for its ultimate causal determination to what we can only call, however vaguely, the original constitution of nature. Yet it would seem that we can not assign a physical but only a metaphysical meaning to this phrase. Claude Bernard recognizes this dilemma and comments upon it, but without concerning himself greatly, since he was satis- fied that for the solution of concrete scientific problems (in which he was mainly interested) only physico-chemical or experimental methods have any real value. Apparently it is now agreed among philosophers that causality, while a constant feature of natural exist- ence, as it presents itself to our senses, is not a factor to be appealed to in accounting for ultimate origins. Defining the situation in this manner enables us to formulate the alternatives of the problem somewhat more clearly. We may put the matter thus: Is life a development from physical nature, pe- culiar only in expressing or exemplifying in an intensified or cen- tralized form certain fundamental features or tendencies of natural processes? Or is it a special agency or activity set apart from non- living nature, having peculiarities which are sharply contrasted to the inorganic and not derivable from it? These would seem to cor- respond to the alternatives of a natural or a supernatural mnode of origin. If life is a product of natural evolution, is it an expression of a deeply rooted or essential property or characteristic of nature? or is it a casual product, one of the many purely mechanical effects of what used to be described-in a phrase vaguely irritating to many persons-as a fortuitous concourse of atoms? It is to be noted that the former alternative recognizes a certain preexisting trend or directive tendency, reaching eventually its expression in living or- ganisms; and it therefore seems more consonant with a vitalistic interpretation; the underlying "urge" or originative impulse which is postulated might be designated by Bergson's term, elan vital. The other is the mechanistic alternative, which regards the peculiari- ties that seem to set life apart from other natural processes as simply the result of the physical and chemical properties of the special ma- terial complex called protoplasm, especially its properties of con- structive metabolism and growth, which are dependent on certain special and primarily accidental features of its physico-chemical constitution. Let us now consider life as a fact of external nature and inquire</page><page sequence="4">480 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY what are the objective criteria of living as distinguished from non- living mnatter. Filst we observe that living matter is not found dif- fusely distribuited, but always as forming a part of some special organism. Many individuals of each species, similar in their activ- ities and structure, are found, each in its appropriate habitat. The existing species of animals and plants are as a rule true to type and readily distinguishable from other species; individuals of the same species are closely alike, although somewhat variable. 'Thus the repet- itive tendency, universal in non-living nature, exhibits itself also in living organisms; but living species are on the whole more clearly defined and exhibit fewer intergradations than non-living species, e. g., of minerals; a highly specialized and individualized character seems to belong to the forms of living matter. But all of these forms have in common certain highly definite class properties, not ordi- narily met with in non-living matter; and it is first necessary to state these as clearly as possible. Living matter is sharply distinguished from dead matter by vari- ous remarkable peculiarities of activity or behavior, and by a unique physico-chemical and structural composition. The most striking feature of its activity is its power of growth or self-multiplication; this is shown by all of its forms, from the lowest plants to the high- est animals. With the property of growth is to be included that of reproduction, which has been defined as discontinuous growth; e. g., a cutting from a plant will grow into the complete organism under appropriate conditions; so also will a seed, which is equally to be regarded as a detached portion of the parent organism; and similar conditions are found in animals (regeneration, sexual and asexual reproduction), although here the extraordinary complexity of the process by which a fertilized egg develops into the adult seems to give the reproductive process a special status of its own. Even in this case, however, the essential nature of reproduction as orderly and specific growth toward a definite final organization is clear enough. All living material, then, is growing material-at least in certain stages of its existence, for there are natural limits to the increase in size of ithe individual in higher plants and animals-in other words, it is synthesizing material; and this brings us to what is apparently the essential feature of living organisms, considered as physico-chemical systems. All living matter is more or less con- tinually engaged in transforming unorganized materials and energy taken from the surroundings into organized living material of its own kind. It thus tends automatically to add to itself; what is ap- propriated from the surrounding non-living world is actively trans- formed into its own organized and active living substance. This</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 481 transformation is specific; i. e., a special type of living matter or protoplasm, with a chemical composition, structure and activity identical with those of the original protoplasm, is formed. Each portion of protoplasm thus serves as a center of construction of simi- lar forms. This condition has certain analogies to "germ-action" in inorganic processes, such as crystallization, but on the whole is a unique and distinctive property of living organisms. This property depends on certain highly definite processes of chemical transforma- tion which have their special or individual characteristics for each species of protoplasm. If we put two different species of yeast or bacteria into the same culture-medium, each builds up protoplasm of its own kind; i. e., each effects a special predetermined kind of chemical transformation in the materials which it incorporates from the surroundings. Each has the same external materials as its source of supply, but each transforms them in its own specific way, and hence builds up a special kind of protoplasmic structure which, hav- ing a special physico-chemical constitution or organization, exhibits corresponding special activities. The term specificity denotes this peculiarity. We thus conceive of each cell or each portion of proto- plasm as primarily a center of specific chemical transformation or synthesis. Its other specific properties follow from this, including its power of maintaining these characteristics intact and transmitting them to other portions of living matter arising from it in growth or reproduction. "Heredity" is the name usually applied to this lat- ter process; but it is important to note that the power of reproduc- ing or replacing itself is one which is at all times active in living protoplasm. The living substance is continually being chemically decomposed or broken down by its own energy-yielding processes (usually oxidations of some kind), and unless there is a compensa- tory process of construction or replacement it sooner or later ceases to exist as living. The processes of specific construction must there- fore balance or exceed this destruction if life is to continue; excess of construction implies growth, or increase in the quantity of living organized protoplasm; and reproduction is an aspect of growth, as already pointed out. In this sense "heredity'" is always being manifested in living organisms; as Haldane puts it, "heredity is for biology an axiom and not a problem," i. e., when dealing with living matter biologists assume or take for granted its specific trans- formative and synthetic power, just as chemists take for granted chenmical affmity. The physiological units of the specuilative biolo- gists (gemmules, pangens, ids) have always been endowed by their creators with the property of automatic self-perpetuation and repro- duction; and just at present this property is assumed without</page><page sequence="6">482 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY further question to be possessed by the chromosomes, which most geneticists regard as the bearers of hereditary qualities in higher organisms. But in the physiological sense no such theories of heredity can be regarded as ultimate; if chromosomes (e. g..) deter- mine the appearance of certain special cha-racters in organismns (as now appears almost certainly to be the case), what determines the appearance of the special qualities possessed by a given set of chronmosomes themselves? Surely not a second set of chromosomes -i. e., similar physiological units of a lower order? Evidently these would require a third set of determinants, and so on ad infinitum, like the fleas in Swift's epigram. But the facts of phys- ical science forbid any such regressus, since limits to divisibility are set by the atomic or electronic constitution of matter. The self- multiplying property of living matter is in reality an expression or consequence of the specific constructive side of its metabolic proc- esses, and the problem of heredity resolves itself ultimately into the problem of the physico-chemical conditions determining this pecul- iar synthetic power. Specific chemical transformation is the form of physical activity which is essential to living matter. There is an interesting general significance in this fact, for the most striking feature of chemical reactions, as distinguished from other natural processes, is that through their means substances are formed having properties en- tirely different from those of the original interacting substances. There is always the generation of novelty, the appearance of quali- ties and modes of behavior not deducible (at least at present) from those of the parent bodies; and it is this peculiarity which has enabled the life-process to create out of carbon compounds, salts, and water such a multitude of novel and varied forms. The syn- thesis of special chemical compounds in metabolism, in special struc- tural and other relationships, thus makes possible the appearance of the qualities which we call vital. All living beings are primarily products of metabolism, in this general sense; they are formed, mnaintained, and perpetuated by processes of chemical transforma- tion. They represent, in the purely physico-chemical sense, special collocations of matter and energy; and yet their synthesis in the manner broadly indicated necessarily involves the synthesis or creation of many other properties and modes of action which are of a different and higher order and give rise to the special con- ception of vital. The chemical process is the foundational one, but it brings into being systems having qualities whose existence could never have been predicted from a consideration of the chemical processes alone. These "vital" qualities have properties of their own requiring special modes of consideration and investigation.</page><page sequence="7">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 483 The organism is undeniably a physico-chemical system, but it is something else in addition. We come now to a consideration of the more specifically vital properties. I-How can such complex systems as living organisms maintain themselves or even continue to increase and multiply in a nature which seems on the whole unfavorable to the preservation of special configurations of a complex type? Part of the answer has already been indicated. An organism maintains itself because its dissolu- tion is normally balanced by an accompanying reconstruction; its naterials and energyr are replaced as rapidly as they are lost or destroyed, and hence the dependent vital characters, however com- plex they may be, are enabled to persist. In this general respect living organisms resemble certain other natural systems whose permanence also depends on the maintenance of a balance between integrative and dissipative processes of various kinds; a candle- flame, a whirlpool, and fireworks such as the "devil's fountain" are instances; their persistence and individuality are due to an automatically controlled balance of diverse activities. The general class of physical conditions called equtilibria enters here. Experi- ence shows that two equal and oppositely directed forces or tensions produce where they come into contact a stationary condition, per- manent unless disturbed; static equilibria, as in a balance or a stretched spring, are of this kind. Hence such equilibria can be represented by mathematical equations-a certain duality being recognized in the conditions determining the permanent state in question. The class of equilibria represented by organisms is of a more complex kind; they represent equilibria of processes, often called "dynamic equilibria." Any number of separate processes or activities, whose effects, taken singly, are of the most varied and frequently opposed kind, may be so coordinated that the total or resultant systemn preserves a constant recognizable character or unity. The component activities may be collected into two groups, which may also conceivably be symbolized by the expressions on opposite sides of an equation, the constructive or integrative processes of the one side balancing the destructive on the other. Each group, taken collectively or additively is equal and opposite to the other in its total or resultant effects; hence the two com- pensate each other and produce a stationary total condition. Thus when constructive and destructive metabolism in a living organism are equal there is balanced maintenance, indicated, e. g., by nitro- genous equilibrium; when the one or the other exceeds there is either growth or regression. In all organisms the conditions making for dissolution are various. Take the case of a simple marine plant or unicellular animal as an illustration: the mechanical and chem-</page><page sequence="8">484 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ical action of the environment, the tendency of protoplasmic mate- rials to diffuse into the surrounding sea-water, and especially the continued oxidation of protoplasmic constituents and loss of carbon as CO2, all combine to diminish the living substance; this loss is replaced during life by the intake and transformation of food materials. When, however, the synthetic processes cease, as at death, the destructive processes are unbalanced and the organism is quickly disintegrated. On the other hand, with an abundant food-supply and otherwise favorable conditions the synthetic process may predoniinate and lead to indefinite growth and reproduction. Now this conception is applicable to all forms of life and also to life in its totality; its persistence implies that disintegrations are balanced or overbalanced by integrations. In the extraordinary diversity of organismns we find an infinity of different means by which this vital balance is maintained. When it is not maintained, as repeatedly happens in nature, a species becomes extinct. Living and stable species are therefore found to be organized in such a way that their persistence and perpetuation are ensured by all kinds of structural, chemical and behavioristic peculiarities and devices. These are usually called "adaptations," especially in those cases when some special feature of the environment is provided against: thus low temperature in the surroundings is countered in mammals by special thickness of fur; scarcity of food is compensated for by the special development of senses, intelligence and activity, as in most carnivorous species; enemies are thwarted by protective struc- tures and modes of behavior. To particularize is unnecessary, since we are now interested in the general rather than the special char- acters of living beings. In all such cases the adaptation represents a condition which favors the persistence of the vital equilibrium- something which enables the individual or the species to survive, especially the species, since cases are numerous where individuals are sacrificed to secure the survival of the species. In general what we mean by an "a.daptive'" feature in an organism is some special peculiarity of structural organization or activity that directly aids in preserving the organic equilibrium, i. e., in securing survival. A few concrete examples of internal and external adaptations will illustrate. The arrangement of the valves in the heart is adaptive, since it ensures the constant flow of blood in one direction and hence the constant supply of food and oxygen needed to maintain the cells composing the organism. The camera structure of the eye is adaptive in enabling the animal to react effectively to the stimulus of light waves reaching it from different directions of space-these light waves being indicators of the presence and situation of physical objects which are thus dis-</page><page sequence="9">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 485 criminated. A countless number of speci-al adaptive structures and habits have reference to the special features of the animal's envir- onment: arboreal creatures have special clinging devices; parasites are curiously protected; predatory animals are usually swifter, more powerful and more intelligent than their prey; the special instincts of an animal are its congenital adaptive modes of behavior. In brief, unless a character in some way definitely furthers continued existence in an environment it is not classed) as an adaptation; its criterion as adaptation is that it favors the persistence of the species. To put the matter concisely, adaptation is a form of equilibration. This characterization expresses of course only the most general significance of adaptive characters and neglects the infinitely various details. Physiological science is not yet in a position to account for the development of the special mechanisms involved in the adaptive actions of organisms, or even to explain their mode of operation in their finished and active state as parts of the adult organization. Thus there is still uncertainty about the mechanism of muscular contraction (although the indications a-re that a muscle is an electro- capillary motor); and everywhere similar difficulties confront us. These arise chiefly from the unexampled complexity and delicacy of living structures and mechanisms, whose characters furnish at once a support to vitalists (like Haldane and Johnston), and a challenge to the mechanists, who see in the regularity of vital action a proof of its complete conformity to physico-chemical law. It would seem, however, that the scientific difficulty is mainly one of analysis and will become less with time and the progress of re- search. Probably the chief reason why the structural fe-atures, chemical properties and activities of organisms are so remarkable and so difficult to duplicate in artificial systems is that the material composing the living organized structures is always metabolizing material, of the kind characteristic of life. Structures which would be impossible (because impermnanent or unstable) in material having no such automatic power of self-replacement are capable of permanent existence in living organisms; hence th.e possibilities of organized structure and activity are enormously increased. The structural organization present in the nervous system of a thinking human being is of a type whose stability is rendered possible only through the ceaseless metabolic activity of the living substance, in which the tendency to reach static equilibrium is continually offset by new conistruction. Regularly acting mechanisms which other- wise would be too delicate and complex to have more than an evanescent existence are thus rendered permanent; and with their continued existence and operation possibilities of activity are intro-</page><page sequence="10">486 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY duced which would otherwise be unattainable. Such possibilities are indefinitely great, and correspondingly the capabilities of a highly developed and trained nervous organization have no assignaible limits. These considerations make it clearer what kind of a system, in the physico-chemical sense, the living organism represents. Evi- dently the constituting elements or essential distinguishable com- ponents of a living organism-considered as a system in equilibrium with an environment-are only in part static conditions; they con- sist largely of events, processes and sequences, often prolonged and highly complex. The phenomena of life show in a most striking manner how temporal processes or successions of processes can be organized into stable groupings or equilibria, just as certainly as can static conditions. Take an elementary instance: in a human being the swallowing of food initiates a sequence whose details are largely known to physiologists; upon the regular succession of inter- connected events and processes which follow, constituting digestion, absorption and the rest, depends the continuance of the individual life. The first stage of the total sequence determines the final and intermediate stages, in a manner which is none the less constant and dependable because it is indirect; if the normal sequence be deranged, the organic equilibrium is disturbed and death may result. Such an illustration indicates clearly the kind of organized or equilib- rated whole which an organic individual represents. A still more striking illustration of the living or organic type of constitution is seen in the regular sequence of developmental processes coninecting one generation with the next; the continuance of the species in nature depends upon the regular repetition of this sequence. Yet in spite of the inconceivable complexity of the process of embryonic development, it is a perfectly delinite, constant and unified process, of such a kind that when its initial event is determined (in fertili- zation) the whole sequence is also determined. Of course' such a sequence may be modified or interrupted by outside agencies; nor- mally, however, it represents a characteristic "natural constant" for each species, and is an essential factor in its continuanee, i. e., in preserving its equilibrium with external nature. Such an ex- ample illustrates perhaps more clearly than any other the essential nature of vital organization; it is an organization or integration of processes. There is no limit to the complexitv of the single proc- esses, provided their constancy is assured; and also no limit to the complexitv of the integrated product, the living organismn. Ap- parently there exists a popular impression that when consequences are indirect and require time for their appearance they are less certain than if they are direct; the above instances show that they</page><page sequence="11">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 487 are no less certain; the difficulty is to trace the intermediate events and their interconnection. Highly indirect consequences of the most perfect uniformity and reliability are frequent, one might say the rule, in living organisms. And it is as an organization of processes which are equilibrated, i. e., so interrelated and integrated as to secure persistence and unity to the whole living system in its environment, that life occupies its unique position among the phe- nomena of nature. Many of the most characteristic manifestations of life in nature are referable to the innate tendency of living matter, as growing or self-multiplying material deriving sustenance from outside sources, to increase indefinitely in quantity. The limit to this in- crease-supposing other conditions, like temperature, to be favorable is set by the supply of available transformable material; pre- sumably if all substances were equally assimilable, the whole of nature might thus be transformed into living protoplasm and the products of its activity. Coal fields and tropical forests are illus- trations of how far this process has extended at certain times and localities; and in a somewhat different sense the transformation of the world through human activity illustrates the same tendency. Since each organism transforms the materials that it assimilates specifically into its own kind of living organized system different from others, the inevitable result follows that those organisms which are most effective in securing and transforming these materials in- crease at the most rapid rate. If we put a yeast cell into a solution containing sugar and the appropriate salts, in course of time these substances are transformed into yeast protoplasm; if several cells of different species are introduced, several different kinds of proto- plasm are produced, in quantities determined by the relative trans- formative or meta!bolic capabilities of the species. Such facts in- dicate that wherever organisms are present a tendency results for all assimilable compounds in the environment to be transformed into living substance; and there seems to be no doubt that there actually exists in nature a general tendency of this kind, however it may be interpreted philosophically. To physical science this tend- ency appears simply as a necessary result of the property of auto- matic growth and propagation characteristic of protoplasm. This peculiar appropriative property of life, which is apparently an accident of the special chemical constitution and structure of its physical basis, introduces into living nature the element of com- petition or struggle, which since Dar-win's time has been recognized as a main factor determining the direction of organic evolution. Only those organisms can persist in free nature which possess the means of securing the material and energy required for their main-</page><page sequence="12">488 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY tenance and increase; accordingly, since the supply of transform- able material is limited, the characteristic situation arises which is described (in anthropomorphic terms) as the struggle for existence, with its result, the survival of the fittest. It is curious to see how what appears to physiological science simply as an automatic activity of systems possessing a certain physico-chemical constitu- tion has resulted in the spread of life over the whole earth, with all of its extraordinary diversification. The original appearance of life might thus conceivably have been due to some primarily accidental collocation of materials, producing a system having the power of automatic specific transformation and growth. Any such system having thus arisen would inevitably persist and spread, provided the sulbstances and physical conditions necessary for its growth were present. For example, the production, through some chemical accident, of a photochemical transformer like chlorophyll would enable the organisms possessing this compound to spread wherever there was a supply of carbon dioxide, salts and water. We observe in fact that green plants cover the whole earth, and that the greater part of organic life is directly or indirectly dependent upon them. There is an apparent quality of exclusive self-reference in all organisms, due to the specific assimilative element in their consti- tution. This fact is in no way inconsistent with the development of interdependent relations between the individuals of a species, as seen in the social animals, or even between different species, as in symbiosis. Such conditions may be regarded as forming the physical basis on which altruism has evolved in the higher forms of life; it should be noted, however, that they can persist only in so far as they favor (or at least are compatible with) organic sur- vival. What we descrilbe as the egocentric property of conscious organisms appears to objective science simply as a manifestation of the characteristic vital assimilative capacity, which, being specific for each organism, has the effect of making each act as if it were the expression or objectivation of a definite "purpose," that pur- pose being to maintain and multiply itself and its own species. At least it is objectively true that unless the organic activities have this result in the long run, extinction follows, as a purely physical consequence. No one can ascribe selfishness, except by metaphor, to a weed which chokes out all the fairer plants in its neighborhood; and yet the property which such an organism exhibits, and which is physiologically necessitated by its own innate type of constitution, has an obvious resemblance to the conscious and acquisitive selfish- ness shown by human beings under certain conditions. The curious and seemingly inexplicable dependence of consciousness upon the</page><page sequence="13">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 489 physiological processes in a particular single organism-what we call personal consciousness-is a phenomenon which gives to the intellectual and psychic processes, so highly developed in man, the appearance of being essentially biological functions, developed like other functions in the interest of organic survival. The selfishness of persons, social groups and nations would thus appear as some- thing rooted in the elemental physical nature of organic life, and hence inescapable. But this view has its limitations, and need not disturb those who still believe in the possibility of transforming life and nature in the direction of realizing or objectifying the higher human ideals. Such ideals have a reality, a fundamental part of which is the physical reality of living beings; hence they have trans- formative and reproductive capacity-i. e., the potentiality of in- definite multiplication and self-realization which is inherent in all life is theirs also. The qualities of the best life are thus capable of survival, increase and eventual dominance, equally with those of inferior life-probably more so, since all persistent life requires the maintenance of equilibria, and equilibria are more stable when disharmonies, destructive elements and other incompatibilities are absent. So far I have been considering life as a development or special derivative of physical nature, and have dwelt chiefly on its physico- chemical properties and aspects. But these form only a part of its total reality; this is shown clearly by our own conscious experience. Many other sides of our problem would require consideration in a complete discussion; but time does not permit of this, and I am also not sure of my qualifications for the task. There are, how- ever, certain more general considerations which I wish to bring for- ward, necessarily in a somewhat summary form, as having an intimate bearing on the more fundamental aspects of our problem. Observation seems to show that the living organism, as a part of nature, exhibits all of the general or fundamental characters of natural existence, but in an intensified and centralized form; i. e., the organism is an epitome or summarized expression of certain essential and innate properties or peculiarities which pervade the whole natural process. The complexity, specialization and diversi- fication of living beings correspond to certain definite natural tendencies carried to an extreme; similarly with their spontaneity and originative or creative capacity. How then are we to interpret nature as a whole? A true interpretation would enable us to com- prehend the two apparently contradictory aspects of organisms, (1) their physically determined or mechanistic character, existing in com-bination with (2) their apparent freedom of action and creative- ness, the latter being seen especially in human beings. At present</page><page sequence="14">490 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY among biologists the mechanists and the vitalists form opposed groups; yet it seems certain that there is no necessary or irrecon- cilable contradiction between their views. A free or purposive agency may be mechanically actuated, i. e., may exhibit complete mechanical interdependence between all of its parts and processes; nevertheless in its ultimate determination other factors than the mechanical may enter. It still seems to me that the case of an artist working with mechanically refractory material illustrates this general type of situation; he may master his material only in so far as he is familiar with its mechanical properties and behavior, and conforms his own action to these. The material undergoes no change except as acted on by mechanical forces, but these are directed and coordinated by the conscious intention of the artist. The problem is difficult, and I can do no more at present than to indicate what seems to me the probable direction in which its solution lies. It is a problem for both physical science and phi- losophy, especially for a philosophy which is rigidly critical and demonstrative in its method, rather than speculative, since our pur- pose is to obtain a clear and valid conception of the present actual- ity, rather than to develop ideas which appeal to ingenious and imaginative minds as representing interesting possibilities. Nature, as it presents itself to our observation, has its highly general or universal as well as its particular aspects. It is at once a continuum and a tissue of separate events. Repetition is its most pervading characteristic, at least when its details are considered. This repetitive character seems fundamental to reality in general; it forms the basis of logic in the mental sphere, and of stability, uniformity and regularity in the physical sphere. Yet the whole natural process does not seem to be repeated (in spite of Herbert Spencer's contention), but has a progress or trend; scientific obser- vation indicates this, and the physical law of dissipation seems in- consistent with any other conception. We have then in natural reality a combination of a regular or repetitive structure (equivalent to law-abiding or logical) with a forward and apparently irreversible trend or activity ("becoming- ness") which is perpetually generating novelty. This novelty ap- pears to scientific observation as derived from changes in the con- figuration, position, and modes of interaction of certain persistent entities or objects whose characters remain unchanging. In the physical sphere these appear as atoms or electrons; the quantum theory also attributes atomism to energy. A diversity or manifold- ness arising from the varying combination of similar ultimate ele- ments, i. e., some kind of an atomism, would seem inherent in the natural constitution of things.</page><page sequence="15">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 491 Now physical atomism seems to be related to the general char- acteristics of space and time. Just as one portion of space or time is similar to any other, so any condition originating in space and time is persistent and unchanging only in so far as it conforms to this general characteristic of spatiality and temporality. Hence the electrons, i. e., the ultimate persistent or unchanging spatio-tem- poral elements of physical reality, are all alike; e. g., all electrons are equal in the physical property of mass or inertia, a quality defined by a relation, viz., acceleration, dependent on fixed spatial and temporal conditions. Thus there exists in nature a stable, un- varying or permanent foundation on which development can proceed. No development, but only chaotic conditions, would be possible with- out an underlving permanence and stability in the ultimate con- stitutive elements of physical reality and in their mode of action. On this much it would seem that all scientifically and logically trained minds can agree. The repetitive and orderly quality everywhere observed in na- ture is a derivative of this foundational stability. And this quality, shown in external nature as the natural laws or constants discovered and formulated by scientific observers, has its close correlative in the repetitive and orderly quality of conscious intellectual opera- tions. These, whatever else they may be, or implicate, are a factor in enabling the living organism to deal effectively with external nature. All human experience shows this. Knowledge is a rela- tion of correspondence between the knower and the thing known; there is an adjustment which interrelates the, two in a manner favorable to the knower, i. e., he is thereby enabled to act effectively in reference to the thing known. This kind of relation is similar to that observed in external nature between the organism and the environmental objects to which it reacts effectively. The element of adaptiveness or equilibrium is the essential feature in this rela- tion. It would appear, therefore, that the orderliness in both the mental and the physical domains has a common origin and signifi- cance. The question of the ultimate basis of this "logical" quality in things is, however, one for mnetaphysics rather than for natural science. But there is also in nature an element making for the production of novelty-a creative or synthetical ingredient; this introduces complexities which to our minds often appear as disorder and arbitrariness. Mlany origins seem at first sight unaccountable; yet when they are traced out in detail they are found to consist of orderly an'd familiar elements in new combinations. Their dis- cordance or alien quality seems usually due to lack of conformity with other systems or processes which have arisen independently-</page><page sequence="16">492 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY i. e., to lack of equilibration. This incompatibility gives the ap- pearance of disorder in nature, and indeed is disorder, in the sense that anything new necessarily lacks conformity to established rule at its first appearance; but, given time, all existents which are in free communication settle down into some kind of equilibrium or modus vivendiat least this is true in the physical world. Whether it is true of existence as a whole may be doubtful; the element of conflict seemns ineradicable so long as novelty continues to come into existence, for, qua novelty, it necessarily encounters conditions which are not in harmony with it and with which in some manner an equilibrium has to be reached-a process requiring time and mutual adjustment. This combination of conservative and novel elements in the structure of reality makes a different kind of appeal to persons of different mental constitutions, and is what gives rise to the ap- parently irreconcilable feud between the mechanists and the vital- ists in biology. Those men who are most impressed with the essential conservatism and constancy of natural processes as ex- hibited in the living organism are mechanists; to them the organism is simply a complex machine. Those who are chiefly conscious of the free and novelty-engendering element always present, and most conspicuously in those activities that seem characteristic of the highest vitality-e. g., originality and creativeness in art-are vital- ists; such men are often inclined to limit the applicability of physico- chemical methods in physiology. On our present view both are right and both are wrong; the organism in its purely physical con- stitution is undoubtedly a physico-chemical system, peculiar in nothing but its special qualities of complexity and highly developed specificity; yet to account for its complete characters a reference to ultimates other than the physical seems necessary. This last consideration is the crucial one. For example, if the regular or conservative tendencies disclosed by natural science were the only ones operative in nature, it would be incomprehensible why the universe is not homogeneous, or at least is not in a state of settled and stable equilibrium, since sufficient time has elapsed for any inequalities of potential to have become equalized, and thus to balance one another wherever they come in contact. The fact that this has not happened indicates the presence of some constantly acting originative tendency in nature which in some manner com- pensates the tendency toward a static equilibrium. The scientific, mathematical or logical description of nature does not pretend to exhaust the concrete detail of reality; nevertheless it undoubtedly expresses accurately many of the permanent conditions to which all phenomena (all existents?) must conform. These per-</page><page sequence="17">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 493 manent conditions are the primary or fundamental actualities in nature; and they underlie and make possible the infinite variety of materials, events, processes and developments which it presents to our observation. All of these, except possibly the most elemental realities investigated by mathematics and logic, appear as products of what we may agree to call "creative evolution." This process is also a fact, a tangible actuality in our experience. To call the novelty-producing or creative element in reality "volitional," or to ascribe to it consciousness, purpose and ethical intention, is in a sense to anthropomorphize nature; in any case it can give only a vague indication of the essential nature of the originative factors underlying development. Still, these factors, if existent in a natural product like humanity, must also be present in some form in the natural process considered as a whole. In all such specula- tions, however, the implications of language are misleading; and direct experience or intuition of phenomena-in active life as well as in observation and reflection-would seem to be the safest basis for sound and valid thinking. Of course by the term intuition I mean nothing mystical or indefinable, but simply direct conscious experience of the actual phenomena of life and nature, without the prejudices or preconceptions arising from the use of words or other symbols. Scientific observation or intuition (in this sense) dis- closes as a reality the constant or law-abiding and hence calculable element in phenomena; but superposed on this, and equally real and fundamental, is the creative element which gives nature its char- acter as a temporal or historical process whose possibilities are never completely realized at one time, but always in process of realization. The conflict of opinion which makes metaphysics an alien and often unsympathetic field to students of the physical sciences indicates that something is still lacking in our knowledge of the essentials of reality. There must be some solution of the metaphysical prob- lem on which all clear-sighted, honest and disinterested minds can agree. RALPH S. LuuLIE. CiLAK UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
