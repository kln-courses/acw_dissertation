The engraving of Huitzilopochtli (reproduced in Figure 27) remains one of the most curious depictions ever produced of that god, and I felt it a personal mission first to identify the publication from which the engraving was taken and then to discover how Huitzilopochtli ever came to be seen in that strange way. Some of the ideas in this essay were first presented in a lecture, "The Image of the Aztec High God, Huitzilopochtli," given at Dumbarton Oaks in October 1985. The topic was explored further in talks at the American Society for Ethnohistory meeting in Chicago (November 1985), the University of Colorado at Boulder (July 1986), and the Institute for Advanced Study (September 1986). I was able to expand and complete the essay in the intellectually nourishing ambience of the Institute for Advanced Study while I was a Visiting Member in the School of Historical Studies in 1986-87, and I am deeply grateful for that opportunity. At the Institute, I want espe- cially to thank John Elliott, Irving Lavin, Marilyn Aronberg Lavin, Elliott Shore, and Barbara Tedlock (a fellow "fellow") for their impor- tant comments and suggestions. I also want to thank Elisabeth Blair MacDougall, Michael McCormick, Cecelia Klein, and Emily Umberger for their ideas and help.</page><page sequence="5">I. THE AZTEC GOD A t the time of the Conquest of Mexico in the sixteenth century, Huitzilopochtli was the most celebrated of all Aztec deities.' Although a late-comer to religious prominence, he had be- come in the fifteenth century the official focus of worship for the Aztec-Mexica political system. His cult was indeed the state cult of the Aztec empire, which itself had gained intellectual and economic dom- inance, if not direct political control, over most of the civilized peoples of Mexico and Central America. Huitzilopochtli was a solar god and the god of war. More than this, he came to embody the feats and as- pirations of the Aztec-Mexica people themselves. Huitzilopochtli is first noticed as a minor hunting god, the tribal pa- tron of a small band of Nahuatl-speaking people-the Mexica-who inhabited the dryer areas of northern Mexico probably during the elev- enth, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries. In Aztec literature, Huitzilo- pochtli is often called "the portentous one," for he directed the nomadic Mexica on their legendary migration from the island home- land of Aztlan down into the Valley of Mexico, sending omens to steer the tribe's progress. He then guided them in their often-chicanerous associations with the settled peoples already living around Lake Tetz- coco in the Valley of Mexico, and he saw them locate finally, in 1325, on the swampy island in the middle of the lake where he had sent an eagle to perch on a nopal cactus as a sign that the Mexica should there establish their capital city, Tenochtitlan. With the gradual increase in Mexica status and power, Huitzilo- pochtli's importance grew. The formation of the Triple Alliance em- pire, which united in 1427 the city-states of Tenochtitlan, Tetzcoco, and Tlacopan, elevated Huitzilopochtli to the ranks of a major deity, espe- cially one of war. Then when the city of Tenochtitlan came to domi- nate the alliance, Huitzilopochtli became the premier god of all the Aztec-held lands. True, local gods were still venerated in the different regions of the empire, and the old agricultural gods of rain and corn 1 The term Aztec is used here to designate generally the Nahuatl-speaking people of the Triple Alliance empire who controlled most of Mesoamerica in the years before the Spanish Conquest. Although united culturally, the Aztecs thought of themselves in terms of their particular tribal affiliations: as Mexica, Tetzcoca, Culhua, Tepaneca, etc., and the term Mexica is used when it is important to distinguish the specific Aztec group whose tribal patron was Huitzilopochtli and who settled at Tenochtitlan, eventually to dominate the Triple Alliance. 1</page><page sequence="6">2 INCARNATIONS OF THE AZTEC SUPERNATURAL still had prominence for farmers in a largely agrarian society, but Huitzilopochtli was raised up as the spiritual force of the state. In so becoming, he assumed new attributes, associations, and areas of control, and his cult was interwoven with Mexica history and destiny. Huitzilopochtli came to embody the sun, undermining the importance of the more traditional sun god, Tonatiuh. As such, he demanded that the life's blood and hearts of humans be given to sustain the sun on its daily journey through the sky from dawn to dusk and through the Underworld at night. He was also the patron of the warrior class, principally the military orders of eagle and jaguar knights, and saw that the Mexica were sufficiently victorious to acquire the victims needed for sacrifice. As a god who sponsored military success, he in- directly fostered the vast tribute system, which supported the desires of the Aztec nobility for elite luxury goods (precious stones and met- als, feathers, shell, and finished jewelry and costumes). At the Templo Mayor, the Great Temple in the heart of Tenochtitlan, Huitzilopochtli was worshiped alongside Tlaloc, the god of rain and, indirectly, of agricultural fertility, who had ancient roots in Mesoamer- ica. Together the cults of Tlaloc and Huitzilopochtli reflected the eco- nomic basis of the empire: agriculture and war/tribute. The Templo Mayor was itself conceived iconographically to express an analogy be- tween the mythic victory of Huitzilopochtli over his sister following his miraculous birth and the success of the Mexica over their enemies. Each war captive dispatched on the sacrificial stone before the shrine of Huitzilopochtli thus repeated symbolically the god's own victory over his adversaries.2 With this clear focus on Huitzilopochtli at the Templo Mayor and the god's importance elsewhere in Aztec Mexico, it comes as something of a surprise to realize that the god's physical form and visual image are largely unknown. Few sculptures of the deity have survived, and the paintings of him in the pictorial codices are relatively sparse and iconographically varied; these shortcomings in the artistic record per- haps explain why the god's physical manifestation has remained so enigmatic. The incarnations of other Aztec deities are fairly common among extant Aztec sculptures and in the painted manuscripts. Stone fertility goddesses abound, and the recent (1978-82) excavations that uncov- ered multiple stages of the Templo Mayor in downtown Mexico City 2 For the sacred nature and cultural importance of Huitzilopochtli, see especially Brotherston, "Huitzilopochtli and What Was Made of Him" (1974), pp. 155-166; Kohler, "Huitzilopochtli und die prakolumbische Einteilung des Kosmos in links und rechts" (1973), pp. 257-271; Gonzalez de Lesur, "El dios Huitzilopochtli en la peregrinaci6n mexica" (1967), pp. 175-190; Padden, Hummingbird and the Hawk (1967), pp. 2-13; Seler, "Uitzilopochtli, der sprechende Kolibri," in his Gesammelte Abhandlungen (1960-61), vol. 4, pp. 157-167; Hunt, The Transformation of the Hummingbird (1977); Matos Moctezuma, "The Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan: Economics and Ideology" (1984), pp. 133-164.</page><page sequence="7">THE AZTEC GOD 3 have revealed a ubiquity of small statues and images of Tlaloc, the rain god, and of Tonacatecuhtli, the two-horned god of the cache offer- ings.3 Although Huitzilopochtli shared with Tlaloc the twin shrines atop the Templo Mayor, he is corporally absent from its ruins. Huitz- ilopochtli and Tlaloc also occupied the twin shrines of the principal temple in Tetzcoco across the lake, and Huitzilopochtli and Tezcatli- poca (Smoking Mirror) were reported by the Spanish conquistadores to have been worshiped in Tenochtitlan's marketplace neighbor of Tlatelolco.4 But no idol known to come from one of Huitzilopochtli's temples has ever been found. In all of Aztec sculpture, only five rep- resentations of the deity can be surely identified. He figures sparsely in the native-style pictorial manuscripts as well. Within the corpus of ethnohistorical documents that were painted and written under Spanish patronage in sixteenth-century Mexico to record Aztec culture, Huitzilopochtli's form varies according to the context of his appearance. The Spanish conquistadores likewise dif- fered in their visual opinions of his cult image, so that there was no one image of Huitzilopochtli pictorially or textually preserved. Later, when European artists sought a picture of Huitzilopochtli to include in the illustrated publications recording the voyages of discovery and the histories of the conquests in the New World, they found only a few disparate and visually inadequate descriptions. Lacking a recognized model, these artists were free to assemble their own iconographic pro- gram of the Aztec god for their continental public. Thus, in the Aztec world, in the minds of the conquerors and Spanish friars in Mexico, and in the early European engravings, Huitzilopochtli's image was constructed to be internally consistent with the god's function in that specific context and to fall suitably within that particular aesthetic so as to be readily intelligible to the separate audiences. Each world por- trayed Huitzilopochtli for its own purposes and within its own vision- ary perimeters, and each formed the Aztec god it wanted. In seeking a better understanding of the changing image of Huitz- ilopochtli, it is useful first to outline the god's visual characteristics in a general sense as these are known from the sixteenth-century pictorial codices in the native tradition and from textual descriptions written shortly after the Spanish Conquest. The Pre-Conquest repre- sentations of the god can then be identified and analyzed within their political and ideological contexts. Huitzilopochtli appears more often 3 Matos Moctezuma, El Templo Mayor (1982); Heyden, "Symbolism of Ceramics from the Templo Mayor" (1987), pp. 109-130; Broda, "The Provenience of the Offerings" (1987), pp. 211-256. Although H. B. Nicholson (Art of Aztec Mexico [1983], pp. 86-91) has identified the god of the caches as Tepeyollotl (Heart of the Mountain), Debra Nagao ("Planting of Sustenance" [1985], pp. 5-27) has made a strong case to support her Ton- acatecuhtli (Lord of Sustenance) identification. ' See, however, Barlow, "Los dioses del Templo Mayor de Tlatelolco" (1944), pp. 45- 55, who argues that Huitzilopochtli and Tlaloc were kept together in Tlatelolco.</page><page sequence="8">4 INCARNATIONS OF THE AZTEC SUPERNATURAL in the painted books, where his appearance differs according to his function: 1) as the tribal patron who directs the Mexica migration from Aztlan to Tenochtitlan, 2) as the patron of the monthly feast of Pan- quetzaliztli, and 3) as the principal Aztec god. These representations are part either of the Aztec world or of the mendicant mind that strove to record Aztec culture objectively and accurately, and Huitzilopochtli is presented within an Aztec frame. But when the chroniclers and con- quistadores described his cult image guarded within the Templo Mayor, they seem to have switched perspectives to see him through the more distant European lens. In the centuries following the Con- quest he comes to be a new pagan god or a diabolical idol. Throughout, the focus of this analysis is the physical form of the god. Huitzilopochtli's ideological nature, much discussed elsewhere, is of concern only as it bears on his formal manifestation. And, here it is important to clarify the difference between the Nahuatl concepts of teotl and teixiptla. After the Conquest, teotl was universally translated by the Spanish as "god," "saint," or sometimes "demon," but as Arild Hvidfeldt has admirably demonstrated,5 its actual meaning is some- thing close to the Polynesian idea of mana, a sacred and impersonal force or a concentration of power. Teixiptla has generally been trans- lated as "impersonator," "substitute," or "image" (Abbild in German) but is essentially the physical representation or incarnation of the teotl. It describes the living humans who impersonate or personify the teotl during cult performances and rituals, the effigies of stone, wood, or dough, and the assemblages of ritual attire that might be arrayed on a frame (usually of wood). These teixiptlas, in fact, form the gods. The names of the gods are applied to the teixiptlas themselves, because Az- tec deity names are simply cultic terms denoting the persons and ob- jects central to the ritual activities. The features of the teixiptla determine the identity of the deity. Thus, by expanding on Hvidfeldt's differentiation of teotl and teixiptla, one can say that individual Aztec gods do not exist ontologically, endowed with visual appearances and physical attributes that they may or may not assume at any given time. Rather, sacred power, mana, or teotl (divinity?) is called forth by the creation of a teixiptla. The physical form, costume, and accoutrements that comprise the teixiptla define the deity and even create it, as is dis- cussed more fully below. 5 Hvidfeldt, Teotl and Ixiptlatli (1958), pp. 76-100.</page><page sequence="9">II. THE VISUAL ATTRIBUTES OF HUITZILOPOCHTLI A basic list of the elements of Huitzilopochtli's teixiptla can be drawn up by combining those pictured in the Codex Borboni- cus (Fig. 1) and Codex Telleriano-Remensis (Fig. 2) with those painted and listed in Bernardino de Sahaguin's Primeros Memoriales manuscript (Fig. 3). The Codex Borbonicus (Fig. 1), a ritual/divinatory manuscript painted for the most part in a purely native style shortly after the Conquest,6 shows Huitzilopochtli's deity impersonator within a native context, standing before a temple-platform as a participant in the ritual during the monthly feast of Panquetzaliztli (Raising of Ban- ners). An analogous depiction in the Codex Telleriano-Remensis7 (Fig. 2) is different in that the draftsmanship shows a degeneration of the Aztec painting style and the form of Huitzilopochtli does not appear as an active participant in a festival but is instead used to embody or represent the month. Sahaguin (Fig. 3),8 in another contrast, shows Huitzilopochtli as the first and foremost of his painted series of the Aztec gods, and on the left he has registered the Nahuatl names of the various costume elements. In Sahaguin's representation, his artist has also painted Huitzilopochtli to the right of another deity who is iden- tified as Paynal. The chroniclers describe Paynal as Huitzilopochtli's page or representative, but Sahaguin himself calls Paynal "the dele- gate, the substitute [teixiptla], the deputy because he represented Huitzilopochtli";9 it is clear that Paynal can be considered a variant manifestation of Huitzilopochtli. Descending from the top of the headdress, Huitzilopochtli can be characterized by his: headdress - a crest of white heron feathers topped with a spray of long lumi- nous green quetzal feathers (Figs. 1-3), - a gold colored fillet over his brow, curled at the front (Fig. 1), 6 Paris, Bibliotheque de l'Assemblee Nationale Francaise, Corpus Legislatif, Y 120.

This list includes most of the elements, and certainly all the impor- tant ones, commonly associated with Huitzilopochtli. Never are all these elements found together on the same image, for several, like the shields or back devices, are variants of the same item and are used interchangeably depending on what aspect of Huitzilopochtli is being presented. A cluster of several elements is usually necessary to iden- tify the god, although there is one feature that is in itself individually diagnostic of Huitzilopochtli. Of the elements that appear often to mark Huitzilopochtli, only the hummingbird helmet is found solely on Huitzilopochtli images.10 The hummingbird is not always present when his form is created, but when it does appear, it specifies the god. This marking is easily ex- plained, because the hummingbird (huitzilin in Nahuatl) is the princi- pal phonetic component of Huitzilopochtli's name. Moreover, the small bird is not directly associated with any other deity. The lack of another direct association is important here, because it contrasts with situations of other phonetic symbols. For example, the phonetic sym- bol of Tezcatlipoca's (Smoking Mirror's) name is a circular mirror from which curled volutes of smoke issue; it is often attached to the head- dress or replaces a missing foot. The smoking mirror is almost always (with a few surprising exceptions) found on Tezcatlipoca images,"1 but 10 Huitzilopochtli's blue and yellow striped face paint would be considered a second visual feature unique to this deity were it not that two figures in the Codex Fejervary- Mayer (pp. 25, 33) have faces painted this way. Eduard Seler, in his commentary to the codex (1901-02), actually proposed that the figure on p. 25 is Huitzilopochtli, but Her- mann Beyer subsequently took up the argument and found to his satisfaction that the figure is Tezcatlipoca. See Beyer, "Huitzilopochtli?" (1910), pp. 533-534. " Tezcatlipoca is without his smoking mirror in Sahaguin's Primeros Memoriales (His- toria, 1905-07), vol. 6, pl. 23, and Florentine Codex (1950-82), Bk. 1, pl. 3.</page><page sequence="13">THE VISUAL ATTRIBUTES OF HUITZILOPOCHTLI 9 it also features among the visual characteristics of a dozen or more other deities, including Huitzilopochtli. In contrast to Huitzilopochtli's hummingbird, Tezcatlipoca's smoking mirror thus cannot be consid- ered alone to signify that god. Setting aside the hummingbird, Huitzilopochtli's remaining visual characteristics are shared by other deities, many of whom are linked to him in some known way but others of whom seem unrelated. To use the Tezcatlipoca example again, this four-fold deity of whom Huitzilo- pochtli is one aspect can wear the heron- and quetzal-feathered head- dress, the gold fillet, the smoking mirror device, the turquoise nose rod, the fire-serpent back device, the anauatl ring pectoral, and the cape of skulls and crossed bones, and he sometimes carries the eagle- feathered shield, the spears, and the serpent spearthrower. Xiuhtecuh- tli (Turquoise or Year Lord, the God of Fire) is characterized by the same headdress, the fire-serpent back device, the cotinga feathers, the feathered shield, the turquoise shield, and the fire-serpent spear- thrower. Huitzilopochtli's distinctive black eye mask, bordered in white discs that represent "night eyes" or stars, is also worn by the hunting gods Mixcoatl (Cloud Serpent) and Camaxtli and by the Venus god Tlalhuizcalpantecuhtli (Dawn Lord). Without listing all the ap- pearances of these visual elements on other teixiptla, it suffices for the argument here to say that most of Huitzilopochtli's visual elements are not distinctly his. This is true for other Aztec deities as well. All Aztec teixiptla have a large proportion of their attributes in common with other gods, for these attributes and costume elements symbolize or embody aspects of the gods shared by others. The point is to recog- nize that there is a difference between those attributes that individu- ally identify Huitzilopochtli and those that qualify him. Returning, armed with this list of Huitzilopochtli's attributes, to the difference between the Nahuatl concepts of teotl and teixiptla, one can see that the teotl can be defined-the "god" as we think of him can be created-through the formation of the teixiptla. The teixiptla is comprised of the physical objects or visual elements (costume parts, colors, implements) that embody or contain within them particular qualities or properties. Many of these qualities are shared by a number of gods, and some are probably shared by all (i.e., the adorning with shells and bells ["tzitzile, oiuoalle"] seems nearly universal). The properties pertinent to that god are those contained in his costume elements and visual attributes. Thus Huitzilopochtli's nature is de- fined by the list of his attributes. The sacrality or teotl of Huitzilo- pochtli is actually created through the construction and adornment of his teixiptla.</page><page sequence="14">III. PRE-COLUMBIAN IMAGES OF THE GOD H uitzilopochtli was rarely carved in stone. In marked contrast to the water god Tlaloc and the water and fertility goddesses Chalchihuitlicue (Jades Her Skirt) and Chicomecoatl (Seven Serpent), whose stone teixiptlas are common in Aztec art, there are almost no remaining images of Huitzilopochtli. There probably were relatively few images created originally, for his was a specialized cult of the Mexica state, which was closely linked to the official ideology and administrative policies of the empire. Idols of Huitzilopochtli com- manded the principal shrines of the major political centers, but they were inappropriate for the many village and barrio temples and house shrines where the gods associated with agriculture and fertility were featured. As is fitting for the teixiptlas of major deities in metropolitan centers, the idols of Huitzilopochtli were created of luxury materials. Many effigies were crafted of perishable materials with the under- standing that they would be periodically replaced, and the more per- manent figures were torn apart after the Conquest for their precious stones and metals. The teixiptlas of Huitzilopochtli were naturally the greatest focus of attention during the general destruction of the idols by the Spanish. The only remaining idol of Huitzilopochtli is a small and compact jadeite figure now in the Musee de l'Homme in Paris (Fig. 4). The im- age has generally been identified as Tezcatlipoca, principally on the basis of the anauatl pectoral and the missing left foot, which is replaced by the head of a serpent.12 Both elements are distinctive features of Tezcatlipoca, but a serpent foot (see Fig. 8) and the anauatl pectoral are also found on Huitzilopochtli teixiptlas. On the figure's back is a long-beaked bird head, surely a hummingbird that would identify the image as Huitzilopochtli. The little idol additionally wears Huitzilo- pochtli's cape of skulls and crossed bones and holds his paper banner and spearthrower. Elsewhere in Aztec sculpture it is the active human impersonator of Huitzilopochtli who is carved in relief. He is noticeable on the great Jaguar Cuauhxicalli (Fig. 5), that monumental crouching feline whose back is hollowed to form a cuauhxicalli-literally eagle vessel, a recep- tacle for human hearts and blood-of stupendous proportions. The bottom surface of the bowl (Fig. 6) bears the carved figures of Huitz- 12 Easby and Scott, Before Cortes (1970), cat. no. 304. 10</page><page sequence="15">(-J 0 0 0 '0</page><page sequence="16">0 'U) .U N . 0 0 U) (U</page><page sequence="17">PRE-COLUMBIAN IMAGES OF THE GOD 13 FIG. 5 Jaguar Cuauhxicalli, 93 x 225 cm.

Seated opposite each other, both gods draw sacrificial blood from their ears with bone awls, and each has a leg drawn up with the foot replaced by Tezcatlipoca's smoking mirror. They are similarly arrayed with striped body paint, skeletal jaws, feathered back devices, heavily beaded necklaces, wristlets of beads and feather cuffs, and anklets decorated with knotted paper associated with sacrifice; each has a smoking mirror at the temple, partially hid- den by the bloodletting act. Huitzilopochtli is specified on the right by his eye-mask edged with small circles and by his headdress, which is composed of the spray of long quetzal feathers, the eagle-feathered crest, the curled filet, and most importantly, the hummingbird head at the back of the skull (the eye of the hummingbird looks out between Huitzilopochtli's raised left wrist and the volute of smoke from the mirror at his temple; the bird's beak rises straight upward above the level of the eagle-feathered crest). His and Tezcatlipoca's presence here refers to the original blood sacrifice of the gods to nourish the sun and earth and the subsequent need for man to continue this practice.13 13 A dissection of the iconography is given by Nicholson, Art of Aztec Mexico (1983), pp. 30-31, but the intermediate social context of the figures is subject to debate. Esther Pasztory, Aztec Art (1982), pp. 171-172, has suggested the penitent figures represent dead rulers of earlier cultures in the guise of deities, and Cecelia Klein, "Autosacrifice" (1987), pp. 334-338, has argued that the human impersonators of Tezcatlipoca and Huitzilopochtli are none other than the then present ruler Moctecuhzoma II (for Tez- catlipoca), and his recently deceased predecessor, Ahuitzotl (for Huitzilopochtli).</page><page sequence="18">FIG. 6 Detail of the carved bottom surface of the vessel of the Jaguar Cuauhxicalli, 24 cm. deep and 64 cm. in diameter (photo: Jose de los Reyes Medina)</page><page sequence="19">PRE-COLUMBIAN IMAGES OF THE GOD 15 The same association with self sacrifice through bloodletting charac- terizes Huitzilopochtli's manifestation on the so-called Teocalli de la Guerra Sagrada (Temple of the Sacred War), a blocky symbol-laden monolith that probably functioned as a throne (Fig. 7).14 Carved on the backrest of the Teocalli (Fig. 8), Huitzilopochtli's human form stands to the left of the sun disc, while the ruler Motecuhzoma II, identified by his name glyph of a nose ornament and turquoise head- dress (xiuhitzolli) and wearing the jaguar attributes of Tezcatlipoca, faces him on the right. Both figures carry in one hand the fringed incense pouch of a priest and in the other the pointed triangle of a maguey (agave cactus) leaf into which are thrust four maguey thorns that have already been used to draw blood; out of the mouth of each human issues the symbol of war-the fire band and the water streams, atl tlachinolli. Huitzilopochtli is clearly signified on the left by his hummingbird-head helmet (the god's face being bracketed by the upper and lower beaks of the bird's open mouth), by his lost foot (which in this case is replaced by his xiuhcoatl or fire serpent), and less distinctly, by his eye mask. A fragmentary carved femur found in Mexico City in the 1960s dur- ing the Metro excavations (Fig. 9) portrays a contextually similar Huitzilopochtli, in this instance facing the ruler Ahuitzotl (Water Beast), Motecuhzoma II's predecessor, who is likewise drawing blood from his ear with a bone awl. Ahuitzotl's name glyph, the water beast, appears above his head, to the left of the rectangular cartouche bear- ing the year date 12 Reed.15 On the right, Huitzilopochtli is defined by the eagle- and quetzal-feathered headdress, the hummingbird helmet, the smoking mirror, and the top portion of his distinctive eye mask. In the cuauhxicalli and on the Teocalli and bone, the teixiptlas of Huitzilopochtli participate in the bloodletting rite, twice alongside Mexica rulers and once with Tezcatlipoca, the god of rulership. Al- though bloodletting has generally been thought a priestly act, Cecelia Klein has recently argued that much bloodletting imagery associated with the Aztec Templo Mayor is part of the accession iconography of the Aztec rulers and visually fulfills their need to validate their de- scent and reign.16 In this context, Huitzilopochtli appears symmetri- 14 Umberger, Aztec Sculptures, Hieroglyphs and History (1981), pp. 185-190. 15 Emily Umberger, who brought this bone to my attention, believes it originally func- tioned itself as a bloodletter and was later recarved with parallel cuts that turn it into a rasp; these cuts obliterate some of the originally carved features. Although the year date only has 10 numerical discs left visible, Umberger points out that the spacing of the extant discs and the location of the cuts make it very probable that there were 12 discs originally. Umberger, personal communication; the bone was first published by Cepeda Cardenas and Martin Arafia, "Hueso grabado del Centro de Mexico" (1968), pp. 38-41. 16 Klein has also proposed that the humans impersonating Huitzilopochtli on the Jag- uar Cuauhxicalli and Teocalli are the most recently deceased rulers who face their suc- cessors, i.e., that Ahuitzotl (dressed as Huitzilopochtli) faces Moctecuhzoma II (in the guise of Tezcatlipoca) in the Jaguar Cuauhxicalli and faces Motecuhzoma II himself (wearing some Tezcatlipoca attributes) on the Teocalli.

In these ways and additionally as the god of war, Huitzilopochtli supports the ruler Tizoc on that ruler's great victory monument, the Stone of Tizoc (Figs. 10, 11). Along the side of the basalt disc are fif- teen separate scenes of Tizoc's conquest and victory over enemy towns. In each scene, Tizoc is costumed as a warrior but with the headdress of Huitzilopochtli and with one foot replaced by a volute of smoke; in what has been considered the first scene, where Tizoc (Chalk Leg) is identified by his name glyph in the form of a human leg, he additionally wears Huitzilopochtli's diagnostic hummingbird helmet and the characteristic star-bordered eye mask. In the traditional gesture of conquest, Tizoc grasps the deity impersonator of the de- feated town by the hair. Tizoc is victorious over enemy groups, just as Huitzilopochtli is victorious over rival deities. 17 In these five Pre-Conquest representations, the accoutrements of Huitzilopochtli vary, seemingly in accordance with different aspects of the deity, and his hummingbird helmet specifies the god. On the Jag- uar Cuauhxicalli, the Teocalli, and Ahuitzotl's bone, he appears actively and in human form as a participant in the bloodletting ritual. On the Stone of Tizoc his costume, the costume of the war god, gives divine strength to Tizoc. In the little jade figure, his accoutrements form the passive teixiptla of his cult. 17 Hermann Beyer and Eduard Seler before him reported that a similar image of Huitzilopochtli in warrior costume was also among the destroyed reliefs that used to be in the Pefiol de los Bafios at Tepetzinco, but as Emily Umberger and H. B. Nicholson have pointed out in conversation, the Tepetzinco figure cannot absolutely be identified as Huitzilopochtli.

HUITZILOPOCHTLI IN THE CODICES T he pictorial manuscripts from early Colonial Mexico show still other aspects of Huitzilopochtli. Considering the number and variations of deities in the pictorial codices, one would expect to find Huitzilopochtli well represented too. As in the Pre-Conquest stone sculptures, however, he appears less frequently than other, less important, deities and then only in certain contexts. This is as much a condition of Huitzilopochtli's nature as it is a reflection on the content of the extant Aztec-style manuscripts. Other than economic and gene- alogical documents, most of the major pictorial manuscripts in the na- tive tradition are ritual and divinatory manuals and histories (either of the Aztec migration into the Valley of Mexico or of the imperium after the establishment of the capital city of Tenochtitlan), or they are purely Colonial composites whose different parts are largely derived from the earlier sources and types. Huitzilopochtli is not pictured in the tonala- matls or sacred almanacs, where most of the other deity images ap- pear, because he is not one of the patrons of the days or of the ritual weeks in the 260-day calendar, nor is he one of the nine Lords of the Night. He is propitiated during some feasts in the 18-month solar cal- endar and sometimes is depicted in that context. He is painted in sev- eral of the migration histories, but he appears only once in one of the imperial histories, where the other gods are equally scarce. Migration histories In the migration histories, Huitzilopochtli either takes an active part in the affairs of the Mexica tribe during the journey from their mythi- cal homeland of Aztlan (Place of the Herons) to Tenochtitlan in the Valley of Mexico or he oversees the activities in a more passive way.18 His teixiptla is either human or manifest as a sacred bundle depending on the need for action. 18 For a review of the textual records of Huitzilopochtli's participation in the Mexica migration, see Yolotl Gonzalez de Lesur's analysis, which argues that Huitzilopochtli originated as a human tribal leader who was then deified during the journey and merged with an ancient god, "El dios Huitzilopochtli en la peregrinaci6n Mexica de Aztlan a Tula" (1967), pp. 175-190. 20</page><page sequence="25">HUITZILOPOCHTLI IN THE CODICES 21 In the Codex Boturini, a screenfold of native paper painted in an almost purely Aztec style, Huitzilopochtli's presence on the migration is indicated by a profile head with a bird helmet."9 On Boturini page 1 (Fig. 12), for example, the Mexica leave the island of Aztlan and canoe across the lake to settle in the year 1 Flint (in the square cartouche) at Culhuacan (identified by the curled hill); footprints mark the journey. At Culhuacan they build a rude shrine to their tribal god, from whose mouth rise speech scrolls to mark Huitzilopochtli's instructions to the tribe. Throughout the migration pictorially recorded in the Codex Bo- turini, the image and insignia of Huitzilopochtli are manifest as a sa- cred bundle (tlaquimilolli), often carried by the teomamas or god bearers. On Boturini page 4 (Fig. 13), the god bearer with the glyphic name of Tezcacoatl (Mirror Serpent) carries Huitzilopochtli's cult im- age, while the other three bear the hallowed objects of his cult.20 Huitzilopochtli is additionally manifest as a sacred bundle in the mi- gration history of the Codex Azcatitlan, a collation of European paper bound codex-style and painted in a mixed native and European manner.21 In this manuscript, his image often combines a humming- bird and a serpent tail, carried in a fabric pouch like a modern back- pack by the Mexica tlatlamacazque (the Mexica priests), who are identified as such in the glosses (Figs. 14 bottom center, 15 left side). As in the Codex Boturini, the sacred objects of his cult are also carried by the god bearers in the same manner (Fig. 15). It is clear that it is the sacred bundle of Huitzilopochtli that is being represented, because the bundle is shown unwrapped in the lower right corner of Fig. 15. 19 Mexico, Museo Nacional de Antropologfa, MS 35-38. Published by Corona Nnfiez, Antigiiedades (1964), vol. 2. The only European features of the manuscript are drawing innovations: the canoer's cloak on page 1 (Fig. 12) is drawn to represent naturalistically falling folds, and, as Donald Robertson, Mexican Manuscript Painting (1959), p. 84, has pointed out, the tree on p. 3 has leaves arranged in European rather than native-style clusters. Huitzilopochtli appears on Boturini pp. 1-4. 20 In the Codex Boturini, the four god bearers are Tezacoatl (Mirror Serpent), Chi- malma (Shield Hand), Apanecatl (Water Headdress), and Cuauhcoatl (Eagle Serpent); glosses on Boturini p. 2 translate their name glyphs. These same four god bearers are also named by Juan de Torquemada in his Monarquia indiana (1975-79), vol. 1, p. 114, but the Cr6nica Mexicayotl (1949), #26, replaces Cuauhcoatl (Eagle Serpent) with Iztamix- coatzin (White Cloud Serpent), and Hernando Alvarado Tezozomoc in the Cr6nica mexi- cana (1975), p. 225, keeps Cuauhcoatl and replaces the other three with Quauhtlonquetzque, Axoloa, and Ococaltzin. Diego Duran, Aztecs (1964), p. 13, says that four custodians served Huitzilopochtli during the migration, but he does not name them. Only two god bearers appear in most of the Codex Azcatitlan (Figs. 14, 15), but the manuscript pictures nine teomamas in its scene where the eight migrating tribes gather at Culhuacan to begin their journey (pp. 4-5); each god bearer is named and each carries a different burden, including the images of Huitzilopochtli and Tlaloc. The name glyphs of all the teomamas in the Azcatitlan have not been satisfactorily interpreted (see Barlow in Codex Azcatitlan [1949], p. 105), but the woman Chimalma is present, as is Cuauhcoatl and an individual who may be Apanecatl. Huitzilopochtli is borne there by a man whose name glyph is a serpent (coatl) and a house (calli). 21 Paris, Bibliotheque Nationale, MS Mexicain 59-64.

Sacred bundles, which generally contain the ritual paraphernalia of a cult, were among the most sacred objects of the Aztecs and some of the other Mesoamerican peoples, as well as the Plains and Pueblo In- dians. The belief and practice continue today. Although the specific contents of the bundles can include corn, precious stones, feathers, and the like, Werner Stenzel, who has written on sacred bundles in Mesoamerican religion, has shown that "energy is the secret and in- visible content of the bundles."23 Although he does not specifically say so, this energy can surely be equated with the Aztec idea of teotl, so that the teotl is released or revealed when a bundle is unwrapped. The act of unwrapping is itself important, as is indicated by the term for the sacred bundles, tlaquimilolli, which literally means "the bundled up thing"; it is derived from quimiloa, nitla, which means "to wrap up something."24 Even the sixteenth-century chroniclers have noted that the concept of the wrapped bundle was as important as the items they contained.25 There were individual bundles used especially by priest-shamans,26 and there were institutional bundles held by tribes, clans, ceremonial organizations, and villages. In Pre-Columbian Mexico, village bundles were called altepetlyyollo, the heart of the town, because they embod- ied the creative energy or the spirit of the town.27 The institutional bundles were often brought with a tribe on its migration into its present locale and have formed the focus of that group's commonality. Juan Bautista Pomar, writing in the sixteenth century, told how the sacred bundles of Tezcatlipoca and Huitzilopochtli in Tetzcoco had been brought with the Tetzcocans on their migration.28 The textual his- tories that record the Mexica migration often mention the presence of Huitzilopochtli's sacred bundle and its importance in directing the progress of the journey. The bundle (tlaquimilolli) of Huitzilopochtli ap- pears throughout the pictorial migration in the Codex Azcatitlan. He is often carried, and wherever the Aztecs pause on their migration, 2 Barlow in Codex Azcatitlan (1949), pp. 115-116. 2 Stenzel, "Sacred Bundles" (1970), p. 351. 24 Molina, Vocabulario (1970), pp. 90, 134; Stenzel, "Sacred Bundles" (1970), p. 348. 25 Stenzel, "Sacred Bundles" (1970), p. 349. 26 This practice still exists in Highland Guatemala, where the contemporary day- keepers use their sacred bundles in divination. See Tedlock, Time and the Highland Maya (1982), p. 650. 27 Stenzel, "Sacred Bundles" (1970), p. 349. 28 Juan Bautista Pomar, Relaci6n de Texcoco, (1975), pp. 12-13.</page><page sequence="30">26 INCARNATIONS OF THE AZTEC SUPERNATURAL Huitzilopochtli's image is placed in a conventionalized temple from which he oversees the subsequent activities of the Mexica. In subsequent years, Huitzilopochtli's bundle must have been care- fully kept within the ritual precinct of Tenochtitlan. Then, during the Conquest, it was spirited out of the city before it could be destroyed by the Spanish, if the evidence from an Inquisition case against idolatry can be believed. In 1539, eighteen years after the Conquest, one Don Miguel, a cacique or native leader who was originally named Pochtecatl Tlaylotla, was accused before the Inquisition of idolatry and was tried.29 A principal objective of the Inquisitor, the famous bishop Juan de Zumarraga, was to determine the whereabouts of a number of wrapped and bundled idols that were reported to have been removed from their temples by the Indians before the Spaniards could destroy them. Among them was alleged to be the idol of Huitzilopochtli, taken from the Templo Mayor under Motecuhzoma's direction after Cortes ordered the removal of all the idols from that temple during the Span- ish occupation of the city in 1520. According to the two Indian accusa- tors, who had helped to guard the idol before their conversion to Christianity, Motecuhzoma placed Huitzilopochtli's heavily wrapped and bound idol in the care of their father, a nobleman named Tlatolatl. Motecuhzoma and his short-lived brother Cuitlahuac then died in quick succession, and Tlatolatl and his sons moved Huitzilopochtli's bundle out of Tenochtitlan and into the palace of Boquicin, a powerful lord of nearby Azcapotzalco; there the bundle was joined by four other wrapped idols. After the Conquest, Tlatolatl and Boquicin were among the Indian leaders taken along by Cortes on his march to Honduras, and when word of their execution reached Mexico, the idols in Bo- quicin's palace were transferred back to Mexico-Tenochtitlan and into the custody of the defendant, Pochtecatl Tlaylotla. The accusators, who also helped with this last transfer, apparently never unwrapped any of the bundles and could not describe accurately their contents. They did, however, oversee the painting of a picture to support their testi- mony (Fig. 16). In the painting, the five bundles are labeled, from left to right, Huitzilopochtli, Cihuacoatl, Telpochtli, Tezcatlipoca, and Te- peuha (all deity names); to the right are a feathered panache, ceremo- nial staffs, and a sacrificial banner. Connected to the bundles by lines are Indian heads identifying the different guardians of the bundles: Tlatolatl, the first guardian of the Huitzilopochtli bundle, is pictured in the lower left; the guardians of the other bundles are in the upper left shown facing Boquicin; and the final owner of them all, Pochtecatl Tlaylotla, is drawn in the lower right.

Huitzilopochtli's bundle is distinguished by its elaborate rope bindings and its color; it is also smaller than the others, and its form reveals nothing of its contents. Although the accusators believed that this bundle contained Huitzilo- pochtli's idol from the Templo Mayor, this was probably not actually the case. The god's permanent stone image is described by the con- quistadores as being 12 feet tall, too large for a portable bundle, and the perishable dough images that were periodically created to repre- sent Huitzilopochtli were generally broken up during the ritual peri- ods in which they were formed. Probably the bundle smuggled out of Tenochtitlan at the height of the Aztec-Spanish conflict was Huitzilo- pochtli's sacred bundle, the tlaquimilolli, which may not equate with the idol or teixiptla of the god that sat in the Templo Mayor but which certainly contained and otherwise embodied the teotl of Huitzilo- pochtli. Although this bundle (Fig. 16) cannot be absolutely identified as the same sacred bundle carried throughout the tribal migration into the Valley of Mexico, it is probable that the contents of the original migratory bundle were preserved during the growth of the empire (perhaps being amplified as Huitzilopochtli's cult expanded), that they retained their power and significance, and that they were removed by Motecuhzoma in 1520 to be guarded and further preserved. Although sacred bundles hold energy, they are essentially inarticu- late and incapable of direct action; they work through priestly inter- mediaries, whether they are directing a tribal migration or outlining the construction of a temple. In the pictorial migration histories of the Aztecs, Huitzilopochtli is presented in the form of a sacred bundle much of the time, seeming to observe and guide the progress indi- rectly. At certain specific crucial places, however, greater activity seems to be called for, and Huitzilopochtli assumes human guise. In the Codex Azcatitlan, he is presented anthropomorphically at the principal crisis points of the migration. At the beginning of the narra- tive when the Mexica gather to start their migration, he appears as a full figured man in hummingbird costume atop the place sign of Azt- lan, the mythical homeland.30 Later at Chicomoztoc (Place of Seven Caves), the second legendary point of origin where the Mexica re- group for the journey, Huitzilopochtli as a man-bird holds a fire drill in his talons.31 Then at Coatepec (Serpent Hill) he stands as a warrior in avian attire atop the temple at the site of his miraculous birth and subsequent victory over his enemy sister Coyolxauhqui and his broth- ers, the four hundred Huitznahuaque (Fig. 14). Finally, he fights 3 Codex Azcatitlan (1949), pl. II (p. 2). 31 Ibid., pl.

Here the tribal patron is identified not by his hummingbird costume but by his striped face and blue body paint; he holds his standard shield with five feather tufts, plus two spears and the hunting bag of the nomad.' Thus in the pictorial versions of the Aztec migration history, Huit- zilopochtli's presence along the journey is manifest both through his static teixiptla, or sacred bundle, and through his appearance as a hu- man teixiptla in his godly attire. His bundle is pictured in the codices in ways that affirm Huitzilopochtli's guidance and supervision of the migration, and when circumstances seem to call for more direct sup- port, he is pictured in full figure, often with the shield and spears of the warrior. Except in the Telleriano-Remensis codex and its cognate, he is always depicted in the guise of a hummingbird without an elab- oration of other accoutrements. Imperial histories In the painted imperial histories, which treat the Aztec rise to power after the founding of Tenochtitlan, Huitzilopochtli appears only once, and the reason for his representation even there is somewhat ambigu- ous. In the lower left corner of map 8 of the Codex Xolotl,35 a painted history of the Valley of Mexico from the Tetzcocan point of view since the arrival of Xolotl's Chichimecs in 1224 (?) to the Tepanec War in 1427, the Mexica ruler Chimalpopoca (Smoking Shield) stands attired in the garb of Huitzilopochtli. The ruler wears Huitzilopochtli's head- dress of heron and quetzal feathers and his hummingbird device, and has his characteristic striped face paint; he also brandishes the shield, spears, and spearthrower often seen on the god, but since Chimalpo- poca is pictured in combat, these armaments may only be the weapons 32 Ibid., pl. VIII (p. 15). 3 The Codex Vaticanus A/Rios is MS Latino 3738 in the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Rome, published in facsimile with a commentary by Franz Ehrle, 1900. Huitzilopochtli appears on folio 67 recto. 3 We know it is the nomads' hunting bag rather than the pouch for a sacred bundle that is being represented because the same bag is used elsewhere in this migration his- tory to carry game that has been shot, i.e., fol. 26 recto. 35 The Codex Xolotl is MS Mexicain 1-10 in the Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris, pub- lished in color facsimile, 1951.</page><page sequence="34">-I..

It is clear that the artist's intent was to represent Chi- malpopoca (in Huitzilopochtli costume) rather than Huitzilopochtli the god, because Chimalpopoca's name glyph is attached, and because af- ter the battle Chimalpopoca is shown being led off in defeat by a Tepanec. In some ways this scene parallels the vignettes on the Stone of Tizoc, in that the ruler is shown in combat arrayed with the visual attributes of Huitzilopochtli, the war god. The Stone of Tizoc, how- ever, recalls both Tizoc's conquest of enemy people and Huitzilopocht- li's divine victory over foreign gods, while the Codex Xolotl presents Chimalpopoca's defeat in a situation where even Huitzilopochtli's ac- coutrements are an insufficient source of power. Ceremonials In ritual contexts, Huitzilopochtli is mentioned often in the sixteenth-century written texts, as one would expect. Since he was the principal Aztec deity and the patron of at least three festivals in the yearly cycle of eighteen "monthly" feasts,36 there are hundreds of ref- erences to his worship. The painted ceremonials, however, with the exception of the Sahaguin corpus, show his image only in connection with the monthly feasts. It might be useful first to discuss this exception. The illustrated writ- ings of Sahaguin, especially the Primeros Memoriales and Codex Flo- rentine, stand apart from the others in this case because the deity 3 H. B. Nicholson, in his valuable synthesis of Aztec religion, "Religion" (1971), table 4, lists Huitzilopochtli as the god propitiated during the feasts of Toxcatl (Dry Thing), Tlaxochimaco (Giving of Flowers), Teotleco (Arrival of Gods), and Panquetzaliztli (Raising of Banners). Almost all early sources consider Panquetzaliztli to have been Huitzilopochtli's principal feast (i.e., Sahagun, Primeros memoriales [1974], pp. 55-58; Flo- rentine Codex [1950-82], Bk. 2, p. 27). Several also assign Toxcatl partly or fully to Huitz- ilopochtli (Sahagun, Florentine Codex [1950-82], Bk. 2, pp. 71-74; Tovar Calendar text, Kubler and Gibson, Tovar Calendar [1951], p. 24; Torquemada, Monarchia indiana [1975- 79], vol. 3, p. 380), although most others consider Toxcatl to be more properly dedicated solely to Tezcatlipoca (i.e., Duran, Gods and Rites [1971], pp. 100-108, 426-429; Codex Magliabechiano 32v-33r [and cognates], Codex Vaticanus A/Rios 44v, see also the dis- cussion by Kubler and Gibson, Tovar Calendar [1951], p. 25). Duran (Gods and Rites [1971], pp. 450-451]) describes Teotleco as celebrating the arrival of Huitzilopochtli. Duran (p. 215), additionally says that Huitzilopochtli was garlanded with the first flowers of the season during the eighth monthly feast, Huey Tecuilhuitl (Great Feast of the Lords), while Sahagun (Florentine Codex [1950-82], Bk. 2, pp. 16, 109) places Huitzilopochtli's ceremonial adorning with flowers in the ninth feast, Tlaxochimaco. There is much vari- ation in the descriptions of the feasts in this solar cycle of eighteen 20-day months, including differences in the names of the months and feasts, their durations and dates, and the deities honored in each. Pioneering studies of certain aspects of the cycle have been made by Kubler and Gibson, Tovar Calendar (1951), Kirchhoff, "Fiestas anuales" (1969-70), and Brown, "Monthly Calendar" (1978), but a comprehensive comparison and analysis of these feasts are needed.</page><page sequence="36">32 INCARNATIONS OF THE AZTEC SUPERNATURAL impersonator or anthropomorphic image of Huitzilopochtli is painted by Sahaguin's artists in a variety of contexts when the written text re- fers to the god. In the Primeros Memoriales, Sahaguin's early (c. 1559- 61) compilation of cultural information that became the foundation for his larger Historia general, Huitzilopochtli appears in three contexts. He is displayed in the Templo Mayor in Sahaguin's plan of the ritual pre- cinct, he is present in his temple during the illustration of the monthly feast Panquetzaliztli, and he is the first of a painted series of Aztec gods, as has already been discussed (see Fig. 3).37 The later Historia general, as it is preserved in the Codex Florentine, also includes this series of painted gods, with Huitzilopochtli at the beginning.38 The god's visual attributes in the Codex Florentine are the same as those in the Primeros Memoriales, although the Florentine Codex artist painted a more graphically refined figure. Elsewhere in the Codex Flo- rentine, Huitzilopochtli is painted in connection with the narrative of his miraculous birth, then being worshiped by several Aztecs, and then being sprinkled with purified water, all within the context of Sa- haguin's textual description of Huitzilopochtli as the principal Aztec god. In other sections of the codex Huitzilopochtli is shown being adorned with garlands of flowers during the monthly feast Tlaxochi- maco (Giving of Flowers) and in association with the auguries of the days 1 Serpent and 1 Flint.39 In each instance Huitzilopochtli has es- sentially the same visual attributes that he has in the series of painted gods. Sahaguin's artists do not seem to have attempted to alter the vi- sual elements of the deity according to the circumstances of his ap- pearance. Instead the artists appear to have used the figure in the series of painted gods as the stock image of Huitzilopochtli and to have copied its features wherever Huitzilopochtli appeared in human form elsewhere. Sahaguin's Historia general is an organized compendium of cultural information conceived in the tradition of the medieval encyclopedias.40 His Primeros Memoriales records in paintings and written words the responses given by natives to his questions about indigenous life. In some ways these Primeros Memoriales paintings belong within the native tradition of manuscript paintings, for the graphic images do 37 The ritual precinct is published in Seler, Gesammelte Abhandlungen (1960-61), vol. 2, p. 71. The Panquetzaliztli ceremony is reproduced in Sahagun, Primeros memoriales (1974), lam. 16. 38 Sahagun, C6dice Florentino (1979), vol. 1, fol. lOr (1950-82, Bk. 1, pl. 1). 39 Sahagun, C6dice Florentino (1979), vol. 1, fols. 114v, 204v, 205r, 207r, 281r, 288v, 204v (1950-82, Bk. 2, pl. 29; Bk. 3, pls. 1-4; Bk. 4, pls. 56, 62). 4 Robertson, Mexican Manuscript Painting (1959), pp. 169-172, and "The Sixteenth Century Mexican Encyclopedia of Fray Bernardino de Sahagun" (1966), pp. 617-627, has argued that Sahagun modeled his Historia general on Bartholomaeus Anglicus's De Pro- prietatibus Rerum, which, although it was written in the thirteenth century, continued in its popularity for several hundreds of years and was printed in numerous reeditions from the fifteenth to seventeenth centuries.</page><page sequence="37">HUITZILOPOCHTLI IN THE CODICES 33 carry much of the cultural information that is being preserved in the Primeros Memoriales, and they are painted for the most part in the native style. On the other hand, however, they are conceived and ar- ranged firmly within a European template, and they individually exist because of Sahaguin's desire for precise information about Aztec cul- ture. The illustrations in the Codex Florentine are even more Western in their conception, for they function like illuminations in medieval manuscripts that illustrate or otherwise embellish pictorially the nar- rative contained fully in the text. Except for the series of painted gods, the pictures carry little information not also found in the writings. The Florentine Codex paintings were created simply to illustrate Sahaguin's massive encyclopedia and depend essentially on the written text. The representations of Huitzilopochtli exist to embellish the written refer- ences to him. Visually, they all derive from the figure in the Florentine Codex deity series, which itself is a copy from the god's model in the Primeros Memoriales (Fig. 3). Thus the Sahaguinite illustrations can be considered a closed set which falls outside the purely Aztec tradition of representing Huitzilopochtli. The other major pictorials that have a significant ritual and calendri- cal content illustrate Huitzilopochtli only within the context of the monthly festival cycle. This seeming imbalance of Huitzilopochtli im- ages in the ritual manuscripts is due both to Huitzilopochtli's nature and to the content of the manuscripts. Most of the ritual codices con- tain sections devoted to illustrating the workings of the count of 52 solar years, the solar year of 18 monthly feasts, and the tonalpohualli ("day or sun count"), a sacred count of 260 days used in divination and manifest visually in the codices in a variety of permutations. As a deity, Huitzilopochtli has no direct connection with either the 52-year cycle or the tonalpohualli, since neither is he a patron of one of the years, days, nights, or 20-day "weeks," nor is he a particular symbol of one of the cardinal directions or of a level of the heavens or under- world. Thus there is no reason for his image to appear where these counts and calendars are explained pictorially. Huitzilopochtli does play a significant role in several of the monthly festivals, however, and a human impersonator of the god actively participates in the ceremo- nies of the monthly feasts of Teotleco, Panquetzaliztli, and Tititl as these are painted in the native-style Codex Borbonicus (see Fig. 1)41 It is as patron of the fifteenth monthly feast, Panquetzaliztli, that Huitzilopochtli is most regularly depicted in the ritual codices. Many 41 Codex Borbonicus, pp. 31, 34, 36. I am following Couch's identification of these scenes; see Couch, Codex Borbonicus (1985), pp. 74-75, 79, 86, table V, who also discusses other interpretations of these ceremonies. In the lower left corner of fol. 89r of the Codex Magliabechiano is another figure that is sometimes identified as Huitzilopochtli, but the image contains too few attributes known to be associated with the god to warrant a definitive identification.</page><page sequence="38">34 INCARNATIONS OF THE AZTEC SUPERNATURAL of the sixteenth-century ethnohistorical sources that can be considered cultural encyclopedias (i.e., those that were created under Spanish pa- tronage to describe the ritual and sometimes secular life of the Aztecs and their environment) include a section explaining and picturing the eighteen monthly feasts. Most represent Panquetzaliztli, which means "the raising of banners," simply by presenting a sacrificial banner sim- ilar to the one standing atop a platform in the Codex Borbonicus (Fig. 1).42 The Codex Telleriano-Remensis (Fig. 2) and its cognate, the Co- dex Vaticanus A/Rios, use Huitzilopochtli's anthropomorphic image, displayed isolate in the "pin wheel" stance reserved for gods, to sym- bolize the feast. In contrast, Sahaguin's Primeros Memoriales includes sacrificial victims adorned with Huitzilopochtli's blue body paint and costume in a larger scene of the ceremonial activities of the month.43 More importantly for this survey, however, other codices picture and describe a dough teixiptla of the god, which was modeled, adorned, carried processionally around the city, and finally raised up to the temple during the feast. Almost all of the major pictorial sources and sixteenth-century eth- nologists who describe Panquetzaliztli in any detail say that Huitzilo- pochtli's dough teixiptla was created and publicly circulated during this feast.44 Again Sahaguin is a partial exception. In the Codex Florentine Sahaguin mentions the dough figure in its Panquetzaliztli context, but several times he also describes the dough image as being made during the fifth feast, Toxcatl, which is otherwise dedicated to Tezcatlipoca. Later, in narrating the Spanish conquest of Mexico, Sahaguin included a detailed account of the dough image of Huitzilopochtli in his de- scription of the famous Toxcatl feast of 1520, whose celebration was interrupted by the Spanish massacre of the dancing Aztec noblemen.45 Although Sahaguin's Florentine Codex version may represent a differ- ent ritual tradition from other sources, I think he probably instead simply conflated the Panquetzaliztli and Toxcatl ceremonies. No other early chronicler mentions a dough teixiptla of the god during the fatal 1520 Toxcatl celebration, and Sahaguin's own Primeros Memoriales de- scription of Toxcatl lacks any reference to a dough image.46 Although a 42 The Tovar Calendar, Boban Calendar Wheel, Veytia Calendar Wheels nos. 4 and 5, Humboldt Fragment no. 1, Jacinto de la Serna's Manual de ministros de indios, historical section of the Codex Vaticanus A/Rios, Kalendario mexicano, latino y castellano.

This ceremonial cult image of Huitzilopochtli was formed of tzoalli, a dough made from a flour of ground amaranth seeds mixed usually with the sweet syrup from the maguey cactus or with honey. Ama- ranth, called huatli in Nahuatl, is less common today than during the Aztec times, when it was one of the principal food staples. As Edwin Soule has summarized: The amaranths... are not grasses as are most cereals including wheat, corn, barley, rye and rice, but are fast-growing cereal-like plants that produce high protein grains in large sorghum-like seed heads. As a bonus their protein-rich leaves, which may be harvested many times a year, are eaten as greens. The grain is rich in starch and protein and exceptionally high in lysene, one of the critical amino acids that is defi- cient in corn and in most plant proteins. This was beneficial in balancing the animal protein-starved diet of the prehistoric Mexican and Southwest- ern Indians. Both the leaves and grains were tasty and easily prepared; the leaves by boiling, the grains by parching and milling into flour or by popping.47 Together with the triumvirate of maize, beans, and squash, amaranth was one of the great basic food crops of the Aztec empire. The tribute list of the Codex Mendoza records that the capital city of Tenochtitlan received in annual tribute almost as much amaranth as it did maize or beans.'8 In the late 1940s amaranth was cultivated especially in Central Mexico and to the west near Lake Patzcuaro.49 Now, vast fields of ama- ranth can also be seen around the site of Cacaxtla, near Puebla to the east of the Valley of Mexico. Of the eleven kinds of edible amaranth known to the Aztecs, one particular kind, michihuatli, was reserved for the tzoalli images. The name michihuatli means "fish amaranth," and the plant was so called, according to Sahagu'n, because the round yellow seeds looked like fish roe.-0 during Panquetzaliztli (Monarqu(a indiana [1975-79], vol. 3, pp. 380, 404-406). The text of the Tovar Calendar that purports to describe the painted representation of Toxcatl on the same page likewise assigns Toxcatl to Huitzilopochtli and mentions the dough image, although the painting itself depicts Tezcatlipoca's head and mirrored staff and lacks any Huitzilopochtli references.

Coxcomb and celosia are modern orna- mental varieties of amaranth that now adorn many gardens; pigwood and tumbleweed are wild varieties. 4 Sauer, Grain Amaranths (1950), p. 573, tallies the annual tribute in amaranth as c. 200,000 bushels, maize at 280,000 bushels, and beans at 230,000 bushels.

The Nahuatl word tzoalli came even to be translated as "bones of the gods." Huitzilopochtli's teixiptla was formed of tzoalli for the feast of Panquetzaliztli. During other feasts, the images of the hills, called Tepictoton, which literally means "the little molded ones," were made of tzoalli, as were forms of wind figures, those who died in wa- ter, and certain goddesses. A tzoalli image of the fire god Xiuhtecuhtli sat atop the xocotl pole in one ceremony, little coyote heads of tzoalli were given as an offering during another feast, and tzoalli cakes and tamales were eaten during many other festivals.51 During the reign of Motecuhzoma II, the captive on whose breast was drilled the new fire in 1507 was, after his death by fire, reincarnated as a tzoalli image, which was then distributed and eaten.52 Tzoalli was so linked with Aztec religious ceremonies and idolatry that after the Conquest, the Spaniards took the drastic step of forbid- ding the cultivation of amaranth. Yet, this edict was largely ignored, especially in the rural areas.53 Amaranth was reported among the local crops in the Relacion geogrdfica surveys conducted by the Spanish ad- ministration in the 1570s, and Ruiz de Alarcon says that the Indians were still grinding amaranth and making tzoalli idols in the seven- teenth century.54 The crop lost its importance by the late nineteenth century (it was mentioned as a local crop nowhere in the responses to a governmental agricultural questionnaire of the 1890s), but the tradi- tion of forming tzoalli figures for rituals continued in remote places: for example, Carl Lumholtz reports in 1900 on a major Huichol ceremony where tzoalli animals were modeled and eaten. By this time tzoalli had also slipped into Christian ritual, for rosaries made of amaranth dough were seen in the late nineteenth century in an Indian village near Guadalajara.55 A twentieth-century survival of the concept is alegria, a small golden cake of toasted whole amaranth seeds mixed with honey or a sugar syrup and sold as a sweet by street vendors in Mexico.56 Alegria literally translates as "gaiety, joy," and the sweets of this name are sold especially at fairs, along pilgrimage routes, and in front of churches on holy days. The cakes are commonly plain squares, but some ambitious ones have been formed into human and animal fig- ures, including such modern heroes as Benito Juarez.57 Continuing 51 Duran, Gods and Rites (1971), pp. 80, 107, 147, 203-204, 244-245, 256, 452; Sahaguin, Florentine Codex (1950-82), Bk. 1, pp. 17, 47; Bk. 2, pp. 7, 55, 112, 131, 132. 52 Sahagun, Florentine Codex (1950-82), Bk. 7, p. 32. 5 Soule, "Amaranth" (1979), p. 145. 5 Sauer, Grain Amaranths (1950), p. 576; Ruiz de Alarc6n, Superstitions (1984), p. 53. 5 Sauer, Grain Amaranths (1950), pp. 571, 577. `6 Ibid., p. 571; Duran, Gods and Rites (1971), p. 80n. 57 Illustrated in G.

With respect to the tzoalli image of Huitzilopochtli created for the feast of Panquetzaliztli, the chroniclers Duran, Sahagun, and their fol- lowers record that, two days before the feast itself, the young maidens of Huitzilopochtli's temple ground the roasted seeds of michihuatli, the fish amaranth; later they mixed this flour with maguey syrup, accord- ing to Duran, and with human blood, according to Torquemada. The resultant tzoalli dough was modeled on an armature of mesquite wood to form the human body of Huitzilopochtli, as large as a man (Fig. 18) The priests and lords dressed him and placed him on a wooden bench or litter whose structural members were long poles carved with ser- pent heads and tails. The day of the feast proper, the young men of the temple raced the teixiptla on a prescribed route around the city and its immediate environs in a procession called Ipaina Huitzilopochtli, "the haste or swiftness of Huitzilopochtli," with banners set up along</page><page sequence="42">38 INCARNATIONS OF THE AZTEC SUPERNATURAL the way. Then the procession ended when the priests placed the tzoalli image in Huitzilopochtli's temple, after which the young men piled human bones formed also of tzoalli around the feet of the dough figure. Later the tzoalli teixiptla was broken apart, distributed, and eaten.58 Sahaguin says that they dressed the tzoalli form in a sleeveless jacket painted with skulls and bones, a breechclout, and a black cape of net- tles decorated with tufts of eagle down (Fig. 18). It was covered with another cape painted with designs of "severed heads, the palms of hands, hip bones, ribs, tibias, lower arm bones, and footprints." The Huitzilopochtli image had his shield and darts and had balls of feather down in his hair, as was represented by Sahaguin's artist, but Sa- haguin adds that it also had his normal heron- and quetzal-feathered headdress, his hummingbird disguise, his serpent ear ornaments, and his blue striped face painting, which are not pictured.59 Diego Duran, in his Historia de las Yndias, describes the tzoalli teixiptla slightly differently, in concurrence with his artist's rendering of the dough figure (Fig. 19). Duran may have even based his written de- scription partially on the illustrations that were painted first and were then cut up and pasted in his final manuscript, for his explanations often refer specifically to the paintings beside them: "The god shown FIG. 19 Tzoalli image of Huitzilopochtli in the religious treatise of Diego Duran's Histo- ria, fol. 231r (after Duran, 1967, I, pl. 3) 5 Duran, Gods and Rites (1971), pp. 86-89, 457-459; Sahagun, Florentine Codex (1950- 82), Bk. 2, pp. 71, 145-146, 175-176; Bk. 3, pp. 5-6; Bk. 12, pp. 51-54; Torquemada, Monarquia indiana (1975-79), vol. 3, pp. 113, 380-381. 5 Sahagun, Florentine Codex (1950-82), Bk. 2, p. 72; Bk. 12, pp. 52-53.

Since all the other deity images in the Magliabechiano Group pictori- als are fully painted with legs and feet, the lack of the lower body here unquestionably distinguishes it as the tzoalli form; it is as if the legs and feet of the seated tzoalli image were being obscured by the richly designed cloak, as is nearly the case in the Duran illustration (Fig. 19). Presented in the Magliabechiano painting (Fig. 20) are Huitzilopocht- li's headdress, shield and spears, sacrificial banner, face painting, and anauatl pectoral. Huitzilopochtli's serpent ear ornament, described but not pictured by Sahaguin, is added in the cognate Codices Tudela and Ixtlilxochitl. To summarize the nature and context of Huitzilopochtli's appear- ance in the pictorial codices, the god's teixiptla occurs principally in the painted migration histories and in the painted ceremonials when the feast of Panquetzaliztli is the referent. In the migration histories, it is the god's tlaquimilolli, or sacred bundle, that is presented throughout the journey, except at crucial places along the migration where more direct action from the god is seemingly needed and Huitzilopochtli appears anthropomorphically complete as a warrior. He is a warrior, too, in his cameo appearance in the imperial history of the Codex Xo- lotl. Except in the Sahaguin corpus, where Huitzilopochtli was fre- quently painted in order simply to illustrate the text that referred to him, the painted ritual codices include Huitzilopochtli less frequently than other, lesser gods, and only in the context of the monthly feasts, notably the feast of Panquetzaliztli. In these, Panquetzaliztli is occa- sionally identified by Huitzilopochtli's deity impersonator, but more often the feast is represented by the dressed tzoalli form of the god, which was the focus of the month's ritual. According to the pictorial and textual ethnographic sources that have so far been used to give evidence of the physical nature of the teotl or sacrality of Huitzilopochtli, the god was manifest in various ways. He could be activated in the person of a human deity impersonator who 62 "Codice Magliabechiano Messicano" is MS Magl. Cl.

A third manifestation was his sacred bundle, which seems to have been less an image of the god than a container of the power of the cult. Each of these three physical embodiments of Huitzilopochtli had its appropriate place within the cult shrine at different times. The sacred bundle, brought with the Mexica from Aztlan, was a perma- nent, if invisible, presence, which was certainly well guarded and probably kept hidden in the deeper recesses of the shrine. In contrast, the deity impersonator and the tzoalli image were temporary occu- pants of the shrine, their presence depending on the rites of specific ceremonies. In addition to these manifestations of the god, however, there was also a relatively permanent teixiptla of Huitzilopochtli that commanded his temple as the prime image of the cult.</page><page sequence="46">V. HUITZILOPOCHTLI IN THE TEMPLO MAYOR he cult statue of Huitzilopochtli stood in the southernmost of T the twin shrines raised on the massive pyramid of the Templo Mayor. The most celebrated of the images was that in the Tem- plo Mayor of Tenochtitlan itself, although the main temples, or templos mayores, of Tlatelolco and Tetzcoco also contained permanent images of Huitzilopochtli. None of the pictorial codices created in the native style or tradition pictures this particular teixiptla of Huitzilopochtli, however. This may be because the Aztecs considered the various man- ifestations of the god to be roughly interchangeable: a deity imperson- ator was not more or less important or powerful than a tzoalli image; each had its place in a different ritual situation, and each was, after all, created from a grouping of visual attributes drawn from the same pool. The absence of native descriptions is probably also due to the absence of a suitable pictorial context in the native books for relating the attributes of a particular statue; the Aztecs did not paint pictures of the permanent cult images in their temples. The extant descriptions of Huitzilopochtli's permanent cult image come from the Spanish con- quistadores and the early Colonial chroniclers, who were either Span- ish or speaking from the Spanish Colonial point of view. These men were less concerned with the costumes worn by the Aztecs during cer- emonies involving Huitzilopochtli than they were with the iconic statue in the twin temple in downtown Tenochtitlan. The term idol is even appropriate here, in the sense that an idol is defined as "an image or other material object representing a deity to which religious worship is addressed." The word is used advisedly, however, because in our society, it is almost impossible to use the term "idol" without mentally putting the word "false" in front of it. The word brings with it a host of historical and cultural implications, not the least of which are the perceived evil of idols and their assumed inferiority to other images, either Christian or secular. Yet the word can also be useful precisely because it carries these meanings with it. Those who described the cult images of the Aztec gods displayed in the temples at the time of the Conquest did indeed consider them to be false idols. These chroniclers were warmly wrapped in the cloak of Christianity and saw the images of Aztec religion as being both de- based and vicious. By calling the Aztec images idols, then, one par- tially enters the mental framework of the early chroniclers. The idol of Huitzilopochtli in the Templo Mayor was described by many of the men who accompanied Corte's to Mexico and who then 42</page><page sequence="47">HUITZILOPOCHTLI IN THE TEMPLO MAYOR 43 set to paper their eyewitness accounts of the Conquest, and also by a number of religious and secular chroniclers who, although they may not have been present at the moment the statues of the Aztec gods were thrown from the temples during the Conquest, nevertheless had reliable native or Spanish informants. It thus comes as something of a surprise to discover that most of the descriptions of Huitzilopochtli's statue fall basically into only two traditions or families: one associated with the Dominican friar Diego Duran and the other associated with the conquerors Hernando Cortes, Andres de Tapia, and Bernal Diaz del Castillo. Of those friars in the first wave of mendicant ethnogra- phers, Bernardino de Sahaguin does not describe the permanent image in the Templo Mayor, nor does Motolini'a or Andres de Olmos in ex- tant writings. Duran-Tovar-Acosta tradition Diego Duran, who says he is relying both on native informants and what he has heard from the conquistadores, does describe Huitzilo- pochtli's image in some detail. His record is an elaborate version of his description of the god's tzoalli form (Fig. 19). Huitzilopochtli was a wooden statue carved in the image of a man seated upon a blue wooden bench in the fashion of a litter; from each corner there emerged a serpent-headed pole, long enough for a man to bear on his shoulder. This bench was sky blue, indicating that Huitzilo- pochtli's abode was in the heavens. The god's forehead was blue, and above his nose ran a blue band which reached from ear to ear. On his head he wore a rich headdress in the shape of a bird's beak. These birds were called huitzitzilin. We also call them . . [hummingbirds], and they are green and blue.... The beak which supported the headdress of the god was of brilliant gold wrought in imitation of the bird I have de- scribed. The feathers of the headdress, extremely beautiful and plentiful, came from green birds. [The idol] wore a green mantle and over this mantle, hanging from the neck, an apron or covering made of rich green feathers, adorned with gold. When he was seated upon his bench, [the apron] covered him to the feet. In his left hand he carried a white shield with five tufts of white feathers placed in the form of a cross. From these hung yellow feathers as a sort of border; from the top [of the shield], a golden banner. Extending from the handle were four arrows.... In his right hand the god held a staff carved in the form of a snake, all blue and undulating. He was girded, [and from the belt rose] a shining gold ban- ner set against his back. On his wrists he wore golden bracelets. He was shod in blue sandals. Each of these ornaments had its significance and connection with pagan beliefs. Thus garbed and adorned, the idol always stood upon a tall altar within a small chamber hung with numerous pieces of cloth, decorated with jewels, gold ornaments, and feather shields.... A curtain was al-</page><page sequence="48">44 INCARNATIONS OF THE AZTEC SUPERNATURAL ways hung before it, indicating reverence and veneration. Next to this room stood a second room, no less richly decorated, the home of an idol called Tlaloc. These chambers were at the summit of the temple.... 63 According to Durain, the wooden statue of Huitzilopochtli in the Tem- plo Mayor and the tzoalli image of the god were virtually identical. Duran's description of the permanent statue follows his artist's paint- ing of the god closely (Fig. 19), with some elaboration of detail in the written narrative. Duran's artist seems also to have used this same painting of the god as his model when he portrayed Huitzilopochtli seated in the twin temple (Fig. 21). Duran's account of Huitzilopochtli's cult image might have been consigned to oblivion for several centuries-for his Historia was not published until the nineteenth century-were it not that Duran's kins- man, the Jesuit Juan de Tovar, consulted and copied parts of the His- toria when it was in manuscript.64 Tovar drew upon Duran's historical treatise and the treatise on the gods and rites, including the Huitzilo- pochtli description and painting, in writing and illustrating his own Relacion del origen de los yndios, of which two illustrated manuscript ver- FIG. 21 Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan in the religious treatise of Diego Duran's Historia, fol. 232v (after Duran, 1967, I, pl. 4) 3 Duran, Gods and Rites (1971), pp. 72-74. 64 Duran, Historia (1867-80).</page><page sequence="49">HUITZILOPOCHTLI IN THE TEMPLO MAYOR 45 sions exist from the sixteenth century. Tovar's manuscripts have only recently been published themselves, but one version was acquired by the fellow Jesuit Jose de Acosta in the 1580s when Acosta was in Mexico.65 Acosta incorporated parts of Tovar's Relacaon, including the textual description of Huitzilopochtli's statue, in his Historia natural y moral de las Indias, which was first published in Seville in 1590. Tovar had copied Duran's description and painting of Huitzilopochtli almost exactly, and Acosta then repeated Tovar's text almost verbatim. Acosta only omitted the description of the feathered apron, the belt with the gold banner attached to it, the gold bracelets, and the blue sandals. His account also included the Duran-Tovar discussion of the tzoalli form.66 Acosta's history was almost immediately translated into Italian, French, German, English, Dutch, and Latin.67 It became the view of Pre-Columbian culture and the Conquest widely known to northern Europeans in the seventeenth century. Theodore de Bry issued part of Acosta's text in 1602 in part nine of de Bry's widely circulated and popular Americae or "Grands voyages" series, and Samuel Purchas gave further prominence to Acosta's description of Huitzilopochtli by incorporating it, with credit to Acosta, into his Purchas his Pilgrimage in 1613. Antonio de Solis also chose Acosta's record of the god over other published accounts available at the time and followed it in his own history, published in 1684, which became "the standard literary version of the Conquest until it was replaced by Prescott's history and other later works."68 Conquerors' tradition The second group of descriptions belongs to the conquistadores, who can be said to form an extended family of chroniclers of the Conquest. 65 The Tovar manuscript in the Museo Nacional de Antropologia (Secci6n de C6dices, MS 35-100) was first published by Manuel Orozco y Berra with Hernando Alvarado Tezozomoc's Crffnica mexicana (1878). According to John Glass, this or a similar manu- script was available to Juan de Torquemada who used it in his Monarqufa indiana to criticize Acosta's writings. The Tovar manuscript in the John Carter Brown Library, Prov- idence, Rhode Island (MS no. A 2a, Americana), was partially and defectively published by Thomas Phillipps (Tovar, Historia [18601), and has more recently come out in a schol- arly edition by Jacques Lafaye (Tovar, Manuscrit Tovar [19721); see p. 85 and pl. xix for Huitzilopochtli. The John Carter Brown manuscript is the one owned and used by Acosta. See Warren, "Secular Writings" (1973), pp. 79-81, and Glass, "Census" (1975), pp. 126-127, 223-225, 236-237, for a summary of the Duran-Tovar Acosta connection.

Lopez de Gomara's de- scription, included in his influential Historia de la conquista de Mexico of 1552, then seems to have influenced or formed the basis for the ac- counts of Francisco Cervantes de Salazar, Antonio de Herrera, Barto- lome de Las Casas, Juan de Torquemada, and even Bernal Diaz del Castillo. This tradition began with the conqueror himself, whose second let- ter to Charles V includes an account of Tenochtitlan, its temples, and the cult images inside. Cortes did not identify or differentiate Huitz- ilopochtli specifically, but he said that the Aztec statues exceeded in size the body of a large man and were formed of a seed dough mixed with the hearts' blood of human beings.69 This verbal image of Aztec cult images as large tzoalli statues quickly spread through the Euro- pean continent, for Cortes's second letter was published first in Seville in 1522 and then issued again in Nuremberg in 1524 in the accompa- niment of a celebrated map of the island capital, with Cortes's text in Latin, the international language of cultivated men; the letter subse- quently appeared soon thereafter in Italian, Flemish, German, and French. 70 Also circulating at this time were the published "decades" of Peter Martyr d'Anghiera, the official Chronicler of the Indies from 1520 to his death in 1526, who offered a running account of events in the New World, which he gathered from the official reports and interviews with the returning conquerors. In his fifth "decade," issued in 1530, he described Huitzilopochtli as a marble statue as tall as three men and compared it to the Colossus of Rhodes. Yet he also paralleled Cortes by adding that Aztec gods were made of dough images formed of a flour of ground edible seeds mixed with the blood of children.71 These brief descriptions of Aztec cult images were expanded greatly by Andres de Tapia, one of Cortes's most valued captains in the con- quest. In his short history of the Conquest, Tapia distinguished be- tween a tzoalli figure of Huitzilopochtli and two other statues of stone. Inside the shrine of the Templo Mayor he described "the principal god of all the land," whose form was "thicker than a man and as high," made of seeds ground into a flour and mixed with the virgin blood of boys and girls; during a festival, Tapia continued, this tzoalli form was 69 Cortes, Letters of Relation (197T7), vol. 1, p. 262. 70 Fuentes Conquistadors (1963), p. 49. 71 Martir de Anglerfa (sic) (1945), p. 59. A subsequent official Chronicler of the Indies (from 1532 to 1557), Gonzalo Fernando de Oviedo y Valdes, chose Cortes's account over Martyr d'Anghiera's and copied Cortes's second letter in describing the Aztec gods; Oviedo had few followers in this, however, because the part of his extensive Historia general y natural de las Indias that contained the god's description ([1851], vol. 3, p. 304) remained unpublished until the mid-nineteenth century.</page><page sequence="51">HUITZILOPOCHTLI IN THE TEMPLO MAYOR 47 then adorned with gold jewelry, wrapped in very thin mantles like a bundle, and placed in a space between two walls of the shrine. Outside the hollow wall were two idols on large stone bases the height of a measuring rod [c. 1 yard]. The idols were nearly the height of three measuring rods, and the girth of an ox. They were of polished granite covered with mother-of-pearl.... Over this they used a glue in the form of a paste to incrust gold ornamentation, and designs of men, serpents, birds, and other figures made of large and small turquoises, emeralds, and amethysts, so that all of the mother-of-pearl was covered except in some places where they left it to make a design with the stones. These idols wore thick gold serpents, and for necklaces some ten or twelve hu- man hearts made of gold. For faces they had gold masks with mirror eyes, and at the nape of the neck hung another face like a human head without flesh.72 Jorge Gurria Lacroix has argued that these massive granite idols ex- ist today as the Coatlicue (She of the Serpent Skirt) (Fig. 22) and the Yolotlicue (She of the Heart Skirt).73 The Coatlicue, a 2.57m tall statue of andesite which was discovered with the Calendar Stone in the cen- tral plaza of Mexico City in 1790, is one of the best-known and most horrific of all Aztec sculptures. A near twin is the battered and badly damaged Yolotlicue, discovered in 1933, which was once identical to the Coatlicue except in having a skirt composed of human hearts rather than of intertwined serpents. Gurria Lacroix equated these stat- ues with Tapia's idols because the Coatlicue and Yolotlicue are roughly the correct size, are of a polished hard stone, have necklaces of alter- nating hearts and hands with a skull pendant at the front and back, and are girded in serpent belts. As tantalizing as this interpretation is, it must fail because the iconography of the Coatlicue and Yolotlicue is otherwise different, belonging more to the earth and death lords and the souls of women who died in childbirth. There are also two frag- ments of at least one other Coatlicue-type statue of roughly the same proportions, which suggests that the Coatlicue and Yolotlicue were part of a larger series of sculptures.74 The size and costuming of the Coatlicue can, however, give one some idea of the visual presence of Tapia's statues. Tapia's relation of the Conquest was not printed until the late nine- teenth century, but this manuscript was available to Cortes's secretary, n Fuentes, Conquistadors (1963), p. 41. 7 Gurria Lacroix, "Andres de Tapia y la Coatlicue" (1978), pp. 23-34. 7 One fragment (NMA 11-3386), which sits in the lower patio of the Museo Nacional de Antropologia, Mexico, near the restaurant, is of the skirt of intertwined serpents, and the other (no catalogue number), which is partially hidden in the garden behind the director's office at the Museo, is part of the leg showing the leg ornaments of jewels, feathers, and bells, plus the bottom part of the serpent skirt.</page><page sequence="52">48 INCARNATIONS OF THE AZTEC SUPERNATURAL Francisco Lopez de Gomara, shortly after it was written. Although Lo- pez de Gomara never went to Mexico, he drew upon Cortes's letters to Charles V, interviews with the returning conquerors, and Tapia's rela- tion (among other sources) in order to write a history of the Conquest of Mexico, which focused principally on the person and actions of Cortes. Well composed and stylishly written, Lopez de Gomara's his- tory became widely known and served as a basic account of the Con- quest for nearly a century after its publication in 1552. Lopez de Gomara wholly absorbed Tapia's description of the cult images in the Templo Mayor, but where Tapia had given priority to the tzoalli image, Lopez de Gomara described the two large stone statues first and claimed they were of Huitzilopochtli and Tezcatlipoca. He then main- tained the dough figure as a separate, unnamed, image that stood within the shrine. Lopez de Gomara did not describe any cloaks or mantles associated with this tzoalli form, but he did say that when it FIG. 22 Coatlicue.

He added that the dough idol was replaced from time to time, the old one being broken up and distributed.75 This description of the stone and dough images in the Templo Mayor, published nearly forty years before Acosta's account, became the standard for its time. Francisco Cervantes de Salazar incorporated Lopez de Gomara's description nearly word for word into his Cronica de la Nueva Espafia, and although the Cronica was not published until 1914, Antonio de Herrera, another official Chronicler of the Indies, used it extensively in manuscript and copied the section into his His- toria general de los hechos de los castellanos which was published in fifteen "decadas" in 1601-1615. Even Bartolome de Las Casas, who stood op- posite Lopez de Gomara and Sepuilveda in the debate over the treat- ment of the Indians, included Lopez de Gomara's description of Huitzilopochtli in his own Apologetica historia sumaria, compiled in the 1540s and 1550s but not published until 1909.76 Geronimo de Mendi- eta's short description of the image of Huitzilopochtli as a dough fig- ure of ground seeds mixed with the blood of sacrificed children also derives from Lopez de Gomara;77 Mendieta may have used Lopez de Gomara here because Motolinia, from whom Mendieta derived much of his information, did not describe the statue in the Templo Mayor. Other accounts from different authors added variation. In 1556 in Venice, the narrative of the "Anonymous Conqueror" was published in an Italian translation as part of the third volume of Giovanni Battista Ramusio's Navigationi et viaggi. Here the Aztec idols were described along Cortes's lines as being dough statues, as big as a man or taller, made from ground seeds mixed with human blood; the statues were said to be seated in chairs like cathedras and holding a shield and sword.78 Then in 1615 some of Sahagun's views of Huitzilopochtli (dis- 7 L6pez de G6mara, Cortes (1964), pp. 166-167. This translation mistakenly says the necklace is of gold hummingbirds, but the original Spanish confirms the necklace has gold hearts.

Mendieta's history, finished in 1596, was first published in 1870. For Motolinia, see Memoriales (1971). 78 Fuentes, Conquistadors (1963), p. 174. Federico G6mez de Orozco has argued that the "Anonymous Conqueror" had never actually been in Mexico, and that this relation is a fabrication by a professional translator who was a member of Cortes's entourage in Spain. Jean Rose has more recently argued in favor of the relation's authenticity, and there are points to be made on both sides. Considering the errors in the relation, the "Anonymous Conqueror" must be used with caution, although he cannot yet be totally discounted. See G6mez de Orozco, "Conquistador An6nimo" (1953); Rose, Le Conquista- dor Anonyme (1970), pp. v-xi; and Warren, "Secular Writings" (1973), pp. 67-68.</page><page sequence="54">50 INCARNATIONS OF THE AZTEC SUPERNATURAL cussed above) were introduced into the literature through Juan de Torquemada's Monarquia indiana of 1615. A Franciscan, as was Sahaguin, Torquemada drew heavily on Sahaguin's unpublished Historia general, and he induded Sahaguin's account of the tzoalli image of Huitzilo- pochtli that was modeled on an armature of mesquite wood during the feast of Toxcatl. But for Huitzilopochtli's cult image in the Templo Mayor, Torquemada repeated Lopez de Gomara's description of one of the large stone statues, and he also followed Lopez de Gomara in de- scribing the separate tzoalli form in the shrine.79 The conquistador Bernal Dfaz del Castillo seems also to have relied in part on Lopez de Gomara's history, even though Diaz del Castillo set out to write his own Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espafia, published only in 1632, as a counter to Lopez de Gomara, who he felt adulated Cortes and slighted the common soldier. Diaz del Castillo's history has an immediacy of style that bespeaks his status as an eyewitness to the Conquest. Within the Templo Mayor he mentions two altars: On each altar were two figures, like giants with very tall bodies and very fat, and the first which stood on the right hand they said was the figure of Huichilobos their god of War; it had a very broad face and monstrous and terrible eyes, and the whole of his body was covered with precious stones, and gold and pearls, and with seed pearls stuck on with a paste, . . . and all the body and head covered with it, and the body was girdled by great snakes made of gold and precious stones, and in one hand he held a bow and in the other some arrows. And another small idol that stood by him, they said was his page, and he held a short lance and a shield richly decorated with gold and stones. Huichilobos had round his neck some Indians' faces and other things like hearts of Indi- ans, the former made of gold and the latter of silver, with many precious blue stones.... Then we saw on the other side on the left hand there stood the other great image the same height as Huichilobos, and it had a face like a bear and eyes that shone, made of mirrors which they call Tezcat, and the body plastered with precious stones like that of Huichilo- bos, for they say that the two are brothers, and this Tezcatepuca was the god of Hell and had charge of the souls of the Mexicans, and his body was girt with figures like little devils with snakes' tails.... In the high- est part of the [temple] there was a recess . . . and in it was another im- age half man and half lizard, with precious stones all over it, and half the body was covered with a mantle. They say that the body of this figure is full of the seeds that there are in the world. . . . Diaz del Castillo recalls four images-Huitzilopochtli, his small page who is surely Paynal, Tezcatlipoca, and the tzoalli form of a god whose name Dfaz del Castillo says he does not remember. He adds several 79 Torquemada, Monarquia indiana (1975-79), vol. 3, pp. 112-114, 380-384.

But Diaz del Castillo also agrees generally with Lopez de Gomara's description and on assigning the two large stone statues to Huitzilopochtli and Tezcatlipoca. Writing his Historia verdadera in the 1560s, some forty years after the events he was trying to remember, he may have turned to Lopez de Gomara to remind him of certain details about the idols, just as he apparently relied on Lopez de Gomara for other specifics. The Sources If Bernal Diaz del Castillo's Historia verdadera is considered as a sep- arate eye-witness account, there exist three basic descriptions of the image(s) in the Templo Mayor; Diaz del Castillo's and the two large and complexly formed traditions of Duran-Tovar-Acosta and of the conquerors and Lopez de Gomara. Otherwise there are simply the two traditions, characterized by Acosta and Lopez de Gomara. The process of determining the relationships and derivations of the various de- scriptions has seemingly made the situation clearer by reducing the many reports to two variants that can be weighed against each other. One then might be tempted to assign greater veracity to the descrip- tions of the conquerors, who were eye-witnesses to the Conquest. Yet within the descriptive tradition of the conquerors the visual impres- sion of Huitzilopochtli's cult statue in the Templo Mayor is murky with conflicting details, and there have clearly been embellishments and re- ductions in the description at different times and in different ways. The situation is further complicated because Cortes, Tapia, Lopez de Gomara, and Diaz del Castillo were not actually describing the statues inside the Templo Mayor at Tenochtitlan. Rather, they were recounting Cortes's and Motecuhzoma's tour of the shrine next to the great mar- ketplace at Tlatelolco, Tenochtitlan's immediate neighbor. There, if we are to believe the conquerors, Huitzilopochtli shared the twin temples with the god Tezcatlipoca.82 In Tenochtitlan, Huitzilopochtli was wor- shiped alongside Tlaloc, the god of rain. It is assumed that the con- tents of the Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan were essentially the same as in the main temple of Tlatelolco, but this remains an unproven as- 81 See Boone, "Templo Mayor Research" (1987), pp. 9-10, for a few instances of Diaz del Castillo's reliance on L6pez de G6mara. 82 Robert H. Barlow has argued that, despite the conqueror's descriptions, Tlaloc shared the twin temple in Tlatelolco with Huitzilopochtli. Barlow, "Los dioses del Tem- plo Mayor de Tlatelolco" (1944), pp. 45-55.</page><page sequence="56">52 INCARNATIONS OF THE AZTEC SUPERNATURAL sumption. This and the various conflicting details of the conquerors, despite their reliance on each other, all indicate that the accounts of the conquerors should be used with some caution; their impressions of Huitzilopochtli cannot necessarily be considered more valid than Duran's. A final description of a statue of the Aztec high god, which can now be added to the group, is Juan Bautista Pomar's account of the Huitz- ilopochtli sculpture in the main temple at Tetzcoco, across the lake from Tenochtitlan; there, Pomar reports Huitzilopochtli and Tlaloc shared the twin temples. Pomar's account is included in his Relacion de Tetzcoco, a detailed and lengthy response to the Spanish administrative questionnaire of 1577 circulated to all the towns in New Spain, which asked for, among other things, a description of the major deities of each town. The text of Pomar's Relacion was originally accompanied by several paintings, including the Templo Mayor of Tetzcoco and the gods Huitzilopochtli, Tlaloc, and Tezcatlipoca. As fortune would have it, the crucial painting of Huitzilopochtli is lost, as is the painting of Tezcatlipoca.83 Pomar's text, however, describes the figure of Huitzilo- pochtli in some detail. He says the statue was of wood, shaped like a young man standing, costumed and with a cloak of rich feathers. He wore a heavily beaded necklace of jades on which hung a turquoise pendant set in gold and surrounded by gold bells. His body paint was blue, and his face paint was striped blue and gold; he had hair of ea- gle feathers and wore a white shell lipplug, turquoise earrings, and a headdress of quetzal feathers and gold; on his shoulders was a device 8` The extant Pomar illustrations are preserved as Part 2 (fols. 105-112) of the Codex Ixtlilxochitl, a manuscript composed of three separate and unrelated parts that have been bound together at least since the mid-eighteenth century; fols. 109 and 111, one of which contained the lost Pomar illustration of Huitzilopochtli, are missing. J. E. S. Thompson equated this missing Pomar painting with the standing illustration of Huit- zilopochtli included in the Codex Veytia, a manuscript copied for the historian Mariano Veytia from Parts 1 and 2 of the Codex Ixtlilxochtl in 1755; and John Glass ("Census" [1975], pp. 147-148) and I (Boone, Codex Magliabechiano [1983], p. 101) have repeated this idea. After studying this Veytia image more thoroughly with respect to Huitzilopochtli's iconography, I am now convinced Veytia's illustration is derived not from a lost Pomar painting but from the illustration of the tzoalli form of Huitzilopochtli that is used in Ixtlilxochitl Part 1 to represent the monthly feast of Panquetzaliztli. Realizing that only one of the two deities in the temple, Tlaloc, was present in his source, Veytia's artist recreated Huitzilopochtli by repeating with some variations the tzoalli form in Part 1 of the Codex Ixtlilxochitl. Since the tzoalli form in his source had neither arms and legs nor the spear mentioned in Pomar's text, Veytia's artist simply added them, and he altered some of the other costume elements to agree with the parallel Tlaloc painting. Veytia's Huitzilopochtli lacks the loincloth, long feathered cloak, jade necklace with turquoise pendant, lipplug, leg bands, and back device of a hummingbird head mentioned by Pomar. Veytia's Huitzilopochtli was later reproduced by Diego Garcia Panes y Avellin in his "Teatro de la Nueva Espahia." See Codex Ixtlilxochitl (1976); Thompson, "The Miss- ing Illustrations of the Pomar Relacion" (1941), pp. 15-21; Veytia, Historia (1944), vol. 2, pl. 9.

He had a richly worked loin- cloth and had gold bands around his calves decorated with gold bells, and he carried a large spear, a spearthrower, and a feathered shield covered with a lattice of gold strips. In its principal elements, Pomar describes a statue very like the wooden image of Huitzilopochtli de- scribed by Diego Duran and published by Acosta. Pomar, who was a mestizo descendant of the Pre-Conquest rulers of Tetzcoco, is not known to have used, or known about, Durain's or Tovar's histories, and his Relacion was finished in 1582 before Acosta's work was pub- lished. Moreover, there are sufficient differences between the descrip- tions of Pomar and Durain-Tovar-Acosta to indicate their unrelatedness. Pomar's Huitzilopochtli, although it comes from Tetzcoco, can thus be considered a separate version of the god, useful in describing the stat- ue(s) in Tenochtitlan. The visual and textual sources for the idols in the Templo Mayor must include Pomar and the two major descriptive traditions repre- sented by Acosta and Lopez de Gomara. Added to this, we have the textual explanations and the native-style and early Colonial paintings of other aspects of Huitzilopochtli: his appearance as a deity imperson- ator, his embodiment in a sacred bundle, and his manifestation as a perishable dough form created during the feast of Panquetzaliztli. Even from the range of descriptions of the shrine itself, it is fairly cer- tain that there was more than one image of Huitzilopochtli in the Tem- plo Mayor. The shrine must have held at least a permanent cult image, a tzoalli figure, and a sacred bundle securely kept. Little can be said about the sacred bundle except that its contents were central to Huitz- ilopochtli's cult and that it existed not as a visual representation of the god but as a container of its teotl. The tzoalli figure is described by many of the friars and chroniclers and is pictured often in the codices. Duran-Tovar-Acosta and most of the paintings in the native-style codices indicate that the dough figure was seated and richly adorned, carrying also Huitzilopochtli's shield, spears, and sacrificial banner (Figs. 18, 19, 20). The tzoalli image prob- ably also wore a helmet in the form of a hummingbird head, for, al- though Sahaguin and the pictorial codices show him without one (Figs. 18, 20), Duiran includes it (Fig. 19) and Bernal Diaz del Castillo was probably trying to describe this helmet when he said that the tzoalli form of the god was half human and half lizard. It is also likely that jewels and precious materials were pressed into or pasted onto the body, as is mentioned by the conquerors and alluded to by Durain; the columns of blue discs painted on the tzoalli form in the Codex Magli- abechiano (Fig. 20) may represent this bejeweled splendor. The .form would have been draped in a cape of rich feathers, fully covering the torso and legs, for such a cape is featured by Durain, pictured in the Codex Magliabechiano, and alluded to by Tapia who says the dough form was wrapped in thin mantles.</page><page sequence="58">54 INCARNATIONS OF THE AZTEC SUPERNATURAL A permanent cult image of Huitzilopochtli is more difficult to recre- ate accurately from the sources. Essentially Duran and Pomar describe wooden statues of an anthropomorphic god painted and costumed with the standard visual elements generally associated with him in the pictorial codices.84 In contrast to this fairly benign image is the more monstrous and colossal stone sculpture described singly or in dupli- cate by the conquerors. The stone image had a mask of gold with mir- ror eyes, a gold necklace of hearts or of hearts and skulls with skull pendants, and a golden serpent belt, and it was covered with a mosaic of precious stones. Since Tapia, who was the first to mention these colossal stone statues, describes two of them standing outside the Huitzilopochtli shrine proper, it is likely that they were secondary fig- ures attendant in some way to Huitzilopochtli. The golden ornaments of the statues contain none of the visual elements normally associated with the god, and the conquerors' descriptions of the sculptures are tinged with a degree of sensationalism that suggests the conquerors might have been recreating in their accounts a horrific archetypal Aztec god, who, in the minds of the conquerors, must then be Huitz- ilopochtli. The conquerors' descriptions of Huitzilopochtli are sur- rounded textually by protestations against the sacrificial gore found in the shrine, and although these eye-witness descriptions certainly should not be discounted, we must realize that the conquerors may well have embellished on the golden and death-related features of the cult images. Gold, so highly prized by the Spaniards, was of less value to the Aztecs than the luminous blue and green feathers of the quetzal and cotinga birds. The descriptions by Duran, Pomar, and Sahagu'n, in his listing of the attributes of the gods, stress these precious costume elements, and their picture of Huitzilopochtli, reflected in the painted manuscripts, probably comes closest to the permanent cult image. 84 According to Duran (Gods and Rites [1971], 98), Tezcatlipoca's idol was of obsidian in Tenochtitlan and of wood elsewhere; other gods represented by wood statues were Quetzalcoatl, Camaxtli, Chicomecoatl-Chalchiuhcihuatl, Toci, Xochiquetzal, and Iztacci- huatl; stone images were carved of Cihuacoatl, Tlaloc, and Xipe Totec; Duran, Gods and Rites (1971), pp. 130, 143, 155, 174, 210, 222, 231, 239, 249. Sahaguin (Florentine Codex [1950-82], Bk. 2, p. 85) mentions rubber figures of the gods, and Motolinfa (Memoriales [1971], p. 33) inclusively says the idols were of stone, wood, terracotta, and dough and seeds. The Anales de Cuauhtitlan ([1975], p. 38) in the account of the year 1 Flint (1428) when Chimalpopoca died, refers to the idol of Huitzilopochtli as being of stone.</page><page sequence="59">VI. EUROPEAN VIEWS OF THE AZTEC GOD T o Europeans, Huitzilopochtli was the principal Aztec deity who commanded the march of the empire and successfully de- manded sacrifices on a vast scale. As such, he came to epito- mize Aztec religion and, to a broader extent, Aztec culture, and his image thus was formed by and became a fundamental part of Euro- pean ideas about the Aztecs. In a larger sense, too, the image of Huitzilopochtli came to be molded by the different European concep- tions of all the New World peoples and cultures. The idea and form of Huitzilopochtli as conceived by the Aztecs could not simply leap the ocean to be received wholly by interested citizens of Europe, but it was altered, bundled for intellectual transport, and carried along in fits and starts by the complex process whereby Western Europe of the Renaissance acknowledged and became acquainted with the New World. Huitzilopochtli emerged reshaped and transformed into a deity fully comprehensible to the Old World. The first ideas of the Aztec god came to Europe via the writings and reports of the conquerors, as we have already noted, and these ideas were not without a touch of the magical and wondrous. The conquer- ors, like their brethren, "had been nurtured for generations on tales of the fantastic and the marvelous."85 At the opening of the sixteenth century, Pliny's natural history, with its stress on the unusual charac- teristics of beast and man, was perennially in print, and Sir John Mandeville's mid-fourteenth-century geographic fantasy remained enormously popular.86 To Europeans, monstrous races, extraordinary plants and animals, and strange customs abounded on the fringes of the known world. The sailors and soldiers who volunteered for service with Cortes were additionally fired by enchanted visions from their readings of the chivalric romances so popular at the time, and the men, beasts, and places in the romance novels, as in Pliny and Mandeville, came to shape the way the conquerors perceived the Az- tecs. Thus Bernal Diaz del Castillo described the features of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan as "like the enchanted things related in the book of Amadis," referring to the chivalric romance novel, Cuatro libros de Amadis de Gaula, which was a favorite reading of the Spanish soldiers.87 The first Europeans to encounter the Americas, then, fully 5 Elliott, Old World and New (1970), p. 24.

As John Elliott has succinctly pointed out, "When Columbus first set eyes on the inhabitants of the Indies, his immediate reaction was that they were not in any way monstrous or physically abnormal."88 The existence of the warlike Amazon women was the most persis- tent of the legends to possess the explorers and conquerors. The Am- azon story originated with the ancient Greeks who reported them in Asia Minor, and the tale persisted through the Middle Ages, with Am- azons reputed to be in Africa, although the specific accounts of their location were always exceedingly vague. It was felt that Amazons might well be in the New World, and the conquerors kept looking for them. Columbus, Peter Martyr, Oviedo, Herrera, Sir Walter Raleigh, and other authors mention them.89 Diego Velasquez, the governor of Cuba, included in his orders to Cortes upon Cortes's departure for Mexico a directive to gather information on people "because it is said there are people with large, broad ears and others with faces like dogs [to find out about them], and also where and what direction are the Amazons."90 The Amazon myth and thoughts of Pliny's monstrous races were sufficiently widespread and significant, therefore, to figure in a contractual agreement between two willful men who were shrewd both in business and in the understanding of their fellow men. As more information about the Americas became available to Eu- rope, the predisposition to view these newly introduced lands in terms of the fantastic gradually fell away. But it remained a fundamen- tal problem for the European mind to find a way to comprehend the heretofore unknown peoples and cultures of the New World. Logi- cally, the response was through reference to what was already known, understood, and familiar, so that the New World "came to be viewed through the media of old and congenial ideas," to quote Margaret Hodgen who has written extensively and insightfully on early Euro- pean attempts to describe and classify alien cultures.91 More specifi- cally focused on the Western hemisphere, John Elliott has pointed out that the use of analogy to explain the phenomena of the Americas depended on making reference "to the most firmly established ele- ments in Europe's cultural inheritance. Between them, therefore, the Christian and the classical traditions were likely to prove the obvious points of departure for any evaluation of the New World and its inhabitants."92 8 Elliott, Old World and New (1970), p. 24.

After the Conquest of Mexico there arose two separate traditions of describing the spiritual nature of Huitzilopochtli; paralleling these views of the god were equally distinct visions of his physical form. One tradition saw Huitzilopochtli along the lines of a Graeco-Roman deity. The other was based in the Christian analogue, whereby Huitzilopochtli, who was clearly incompatible with a saint or one of the Trinity, was held to be an incarnation of the devil. In some ways these two views of the Aztec god can be aligned with the two traditions of describing Huitz- ilopochtli's idol in the Templo Mayor, which have been previously dis- cussed. The diabolical idea of the god obviously stems in large part from his association with human sacrifice, and it correlates well with the conquerors' description of the horrific idol in the blood soaked Templo Mayor. The classical analogy then fits with the view of Huitz- ilopochtli's statue as given by Duran-Tovar-Acosta. In the larger context, the two views-classical and diabolical-fell on opposite sides in the great debate over the nature of Aztec society that raged in the middle and second half of the sixteenth century. The Graeco-Roman view of the god aligns with the argument, principally expounded by Las Casas, that the Aztecs equaled or surpassed the Greeks and Romans in cultural achievements and lived in what was essentially a pagan Golden Age. The equation of Huitzilopochtli with Satan then naturally fell in with those like Francisco de Aguilar, the "Anonymous Conqueror," and to some extent Francisco Lopez de Go- mera who saw the Aztecs as being slaves by nature and as being guilty of the blackest crimes against God and nature.93 The situation is complex, however, and the two views of Huitzilopochtli were not al- ways mutually exclusive. Most of the mendicant friars proselytizing in Mexico, for example, took a more moderate stance, praising Aztec achievements while condemning the idolatry and human sacrifice rep- resented by Huitzilopochtli. Classical analogy The classical analogy, if it did not begin with Cortes himself, cer- tainly was developed by Peter Martyr, who saw the New World through "a haze of Latinity," comparing the people and events with supposed counterparts in the Roman world.94 Peter Martyr and Cor- tes, through their letters and decadas, spread throughout Europe the 9 Keen, Aztec Image (1971), pp. 62-63, 77-78. 9' Jones, Nezv World (1964), pp. 16-17.</page><page sequence="62">58 INCARNATIONS OF THE AZTEC SUPERNATURAL "image of a complex, refined society, of a people equal in intellectual and artistic capacity to Europeans, although blemished by the vices of paganism, human sacrifice, and cannibalism.... The Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, made visually known through the map sent to Spain by Cortes, had entered as a second Venice into the list of celebrated is- lands and great cities depicted in the atlases of the sixteenth century. In short, a new ideal Indian type, the creator of splendid empires and high civilizations," was conceptualized.95 This golden image of the Az- tecs then continued in the later writings of Oviedo, Acosta, Torque- mada, Purchas, and others.96 The mendicant friars in Mexico knew Huitzilopochtli to be only one, although the principal one, of the Aztec deities, and he was often de- scribed by such friars as Juan de Torquemada, Gregorio Garcia, and Agustfn Vetancurt as being like Mars, the Roman god of war.97 In Eu- rope the Aztec gods came to be included with classical and Egyptian deities in the 1615 addendum to Vincenzo Cartari's Le vere e nuove imagini degli dei antichi.98 Throughout his Monarquia indiana, Torque- mada drew analogies and comparisons between Aztec society and the culture of the Greeks and Romans.99 In so doing he was clearly seeing in Aztec society a Mexican equivalent of classical antiquity. This vein continued to be followed by Mexico's Creole nationals, who in their seventeenth-century search for origins sought to formulate and adver- tise the superiority of the New World to the Old and saw Aztec cul- ture as the American version of the great classical age. A pinnacle of this equation is the triumphal arch developed in 1680 by the Mexican savant Carlos Siguenza y Gongora for the ceremonial entry of the new viceroy, the Conde de Paredes, into Mexico City. By tradition the alle- gorical decorations and emblems on these triumphal arches were in- variably Graeco-Roman in inspiration, with allusions to classical myths and legends appropriate to pleasing the vanity of the new viceroy. In- stead of the standard models, however, Siguenza y Gongora had Huitzilopochtli and the eleven Aztec emperors (from Acamapichtli through Cuauhtemoc) pictured on the panels of the arch with suitable inscriptions to represent heroic virtues deemed desirable in a ruler.'00 Keen, Aztec Image (1971), p. 70. 9 Jones, New World (1964), p. 20. 9 Torquemada, Monarqufa indiana (1975-79), vol. 1, p. 114; Garcia, Origen (1981), p. 300; Vetancurt, Teatro mexicana (1971), p. 71. 9 Cartari, Imagini (1963), pp. 361-176.

The classical image of Huitzilopochtli was first visualized by the Tlaxcalan-born Franciscan friar Diego de Valades (Fig. 23). In his Rhe- torica christiana, a textbook in rhetoric and the art of preaching that was published in Perugia in 1579, Valades included descriptions of Mexican Indian life and a number of copper plate engravings, which he himself executed, to illustrate the volume.'01 His engraving of the Aztec Tem- plo Mayor presents a bright, seemingly magical world filled with de- tails on the flora of Mexico and the customs of the Aztecs: tapping the liquid of a rubber tree, making astronomical sightings, grinding corn, and so forth. Atop the central pyramid, Valades recreated the shrine of Huitzilopochtli as a semi-cylindrical apse capped by a semidome, vaguely classical in its features and very like the chapel of a Christian church. Huitzilopochtli is presented as a Roman god, or better as a statue of a Roman god, standing on a pedestal with arms outstretched and costumed in a tunic and spiked crown. Nothing about the shrine or the god is indigenous, with the exception of the presence of a sac- rificial victim and the suggestion that the interior of the shrine was draped with cloth hangings. Born in 1533, Valades had no memory of the actual Templo Mayor or of other active Aztec shrines, and he made his engraving in Italy in 1579 after he had been in Europe for eight years.102 Valades chose Latin as the language of his Rhetorica christiana, and he likewise engraved his copper plates in an Italian manner (note especially the houses), presenting Huitzilopochtli as an exotic pagan deity. There followed a twenty-three-year hiatus in published illustrations of the Aztec god. The classical idea of Huitzilopochtli was then adopted and carried even further by the family of Theodore de Bry when it issued in 1602 part of Juan de Acosta's natural and moral his- tory under the title, "De novi orbis natura," in part nine of their mas- sive series of "Grands voyages." The de Bry publishing house, established by the Flemish Protestant in Frankfurt am Main, special- ized in handsomely illustrated and well-printed volumes. In the 1580s the house developed its most famous project, the "Grands voyages" travel collection, which included in thirteen parts issued between 1590 and 1634 varied accounts of the exploration and conquest of the Amer- icas from the voyage of Columbus to the English and Dutch settle- ments in the early seventeenth century. The parts were published simultaneously in Latin and German, and the series was directed to Aztec Image (1971), pp. 188-191; Phelan, "Neo-Aztecism" (1981), p. 761; Leonard, Baroque Times (1959), p. 226. 101 Valades, Rhet6rica christiana (1579); Maza, "Fray Diego Valades" (1945), pp. 6, 9, 13, 25; Warren, "Secular Histories" (1973), p. 74. 102 McAndrew, Open-air Churches (1965), p. 239.</page><page sequence="64">FIG. 23 Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan in Diego de Valades's Rhetorica christiana, Peru- gia, 1579, op. 165 (photo: Rare Books and Manuscripts Division, The New York Pubhic Library; Astor, Lenox, and Tilden Foundations)</page><page sequence="65">EUROPEAN VIEWS OF THE AZTEC GOD 61 members of the European aristocracy, especially the German courts, to the rising class of merchants and artisans, and to that world of edu- cated people and collectors who had already become fascinated with the discovery and conquest of the New World.103 It was enormously popular within these circles. The large copper plate engravings that embellished all the volumes were the first serious attempt to illustrate the literature of the New World with any degree of accuracy. It is hard to overstress their impor- tance to the European audience, for they established the iconographic program of the Americas. Previous images of the New World were few, and most were necessarily simple woodcuts without the clarity and precision of line or the detail of presentation encouraged by the development of copper plate engraving in the sixteenth century. The sturdy copper plates also allowed for larger print runs, so that the de Bry images became widely known through the vast distribution of the "Grands voyages" series. In this, the de Bry family gave Europe the first consistent pictorial image of the New World as a whole."0 For some of the engravings in the "Grands voyages" the de Bry fam- ily could rely on drawings and watercolors made by artists, notably John White and Jacques le Moyne, traveling in the newly introduced lands, but there were no visual prototypes for most, which had to be formed from a mixture of the de Bry imagination, a reading of the texts, and the visual forms traditional to European art. 105 Throughout, the Indians assumed the anatomy and pose of Classical and Renais- sance gods and heroes on which were overlaid identifying elements. The engravings did much visually to further the humanist image of the Noble Savage and at the same time to foster anti-Spanish senti- ment directed at the cruelties of the Conquest.106 The engraving illustrating the Aztec god that accompanies the de Bry printing of part of Acosta's history (Fig. 24) shows Huitzilopochtli enthroned among his priests, who, the caption explains, are doing penance to atone for the sins of the ordinary people. The architecture of the domed shrine is European, as are the ritual vessels; the wall hangings mentioned in the sources are translated into a delicate cur- tain adorned with skulls and crossed bones. Huitzilopochtli's iconog- raphy generally follows Acosta's textual description of the god-he is seated on a litter (which here is a throne-like structure) and is holding the four spears, his shield decorated with the five feathers, and his banner. The headdress derives from Huitzilopochtli's own feath- 103 De Bry, Americae, Nona et postrema Pars (1602); Alexander, De Bry (1976), pp. 7, 10, 152; Bucher, Icon (1981), pp. xii, 11; Keen, Aztec Image (1971), pp. 163-164. 104 Bucher, Icon (1981), pp. 3-5.

The de Bry family has further made a canon of the god's seated frontal pose, with crossed legs and outspread arms.107 Similarly rendered statues of Mexican hunting gods also appear in an- other of the Acosta engravings.108 The pose and indeed the tone of the presentation were to endure, to be adopted by others. Specifically the vein continued in the first illustrated edition of An- tonio de Solfs's history of the Conquest of Mexico (Fig. 25). Initially issued in its original Spanish in Madrid in 1684, without illustrations, Solis's history was soon republished in French translation in 1691 in the accompaniment of two maps and a dozen copper plate engravings. Just as Solfs's text became, following Lopez de Gomara's, the standard version of the Conquest until it was replaced by Clavijero's history in 1780, these illustrations to the French edition became the visual stan- dards of their time, and they were essentially repeated in the subse- quent French editions. Solfs's French engraver recreated the Templo Mayor as a domed shrine derived architecturally and decoratively from both the de Bry engraving of 1602 (Fig. 24) and the earlier Val- ades engraving of 1579 (Fig. 23). Heavy drapes cover the inside of the shrine, whose tiny proportions require that the sacrificial activities as- sociated with the cult be performed outside on a Renaissance-style ter- race. The form of the god himself seems pulled directly from the de Bry image; he is nearly nude, clothed only in a hip cloth and pectoral and wearing the simplified crown of feathers that came to symbolize for all of Europe the garb of the American Indians, and he has the seated, frontal pose established by de Bry. Yet this image actually has more of the iconographic traits of Huitzilopochtli. Huitzilopochtli's ser- pent staff (the xiuhcoatl) is here, as well as his bench or litter supported by serpent-headed poles; the litter is translated into a throne, and the poles are misinterpreted as upright supports, but they are present all the same. The orb is novel. It derives directly from Solis's text, which, although Solis said he took it from Jose de Acosta, is actually an amended variant of the Acosta description. Solis's text explains that the statue of Huitzilopochtli is seated on a chair, like a throne, which is sustained by a blue globe, which they called Heaven, and that from the globe extend four rods ending in serpent heads. All this is pic- tured clearly in the engraving. Not pictured is Huitzilopochtli's bird 107 The origin of this pose for deity statues has not been determined. Emily Umberger suggested in a discussion in 1986 that it might possibly derive from the seated frontal pose of the Kiwasa idol of Virginia, engraved by the de Brys in 1590 from a John White watercolor to illustrate Thomas Harriot's A Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia, although I think the poses are sufficiently different to rule this out. The roots of this pose will probably be found in Italian representations of ancient deities.

Otherwise, the engraving is a fairly true rendering of the text, even with respect to the two standing stan- dard bearers who are described in the text as being two marble statues that supported "two huge candlesticks of an extraordinary make." 109 These twin statues, presented in a fiercely contraposto pose, wear the feathered headdress and feathered skirt with which the European imagination had endowed the canonical Amerindian.110 A slightly later engraving of Huitzilopochtli (Fig. 26), this time illus- trating the rival Italian edition of Solis's history, follows the text in a different way with its own peculiar interpretations, although the image is fundamentally derived from the French conception. In this Italian version, the poles of Huitzilopochtli's serpent bench have been more fully integrated into the orb, and the volutes of the backrest of the old throne have seemingly become attached to the idol's back. The feathers of the shield are no longer arranged in a cross, as the text indicates, and the undulating serpent staff is flipped. The bird helmet mentioned by Acosta and repeated by Solis has become a bird perched atop the idol's head, replacing the feathered headdress of the earlier interpretations, and the striped face paint of Huitzilopochtli- described textually as "two blue bands that bound its forehead and nose"-is misunderstood and translated into a blindfold.111 What may be considered a final variation on the classical interpre- tation is Bernard Picart's engraving of Huitzilopochtli for the large seven-volume compendium of religious customs issued by J. F. Ber- nard between 1728 and 1739: Ce'remonies et coutumes religieuses des peu- ples idolatres (Fig. 27). Volume six, devoted to the New World, contains the description of Huitzilopochtli taken from Antonio de Solis, includ- ing the mention of the blue globe, which was said to denote the exten- sive power of Huitzilopochtli.112 Picart's accompanying engraving owes much to the earlier French rendering that illustrated the Solis history (Fig. 25), for the shield, spears, serpent staff, pose, general degree of nudity, and configuration of the throne atop the globe are similar if not exactly alike. But Picart has also been more faithful to the text in giving Huitzilopochtli a bird headdress, although he rendered the bird as if it were perched on top of the god's head rather than depicting a bird-headed helmet (compare Fig. 19).113 He also integrated the ser- 109 Solis, Historia (1838), p. 200. 11 See, for example, Honour, European Vision (1975), p. 4. 1 Solis, Historia (1838), p. 200. 112 Picart, Ceremonies (1735), vol. 6, pp. 94-96, pl. 16. See Honour (European Vision [19751, cat. nos. 130 and 172) for more information on Picart's engravings. In the Crenonies volume, Picart also reproduced other Mexican illustrations that first appeared in Solfs (pl. 17 of the Templo Mayor), de Bry (pl. 18 of Huitzilopochtli, see Fig. 24; pl. 19 of the Templo Mayor, see Fig. 33), and Gemelli Careri (pl. 20 of a calendar wheel), among others. 113 The helmet of a bird pelt and the canine-headed poles probably derive from the illustration of Huitzilopochtli induded in Arnoldus Montanus's account of America, published in 1671 (see Fig. 36), which Picart knew and used for other ideas, as is ex- plained below.</page><page sequence="70">.0;~~~~~ ~ ~ ~ ~ *- o ;E ~ ~ ~~~~t N S::~~~~~~~~~~.</page><page sequence="71">EUROPEAN VIEWS OF THE AZTEC GOD 67 pent poles, whose ends look more like canine heads than serpent heads here, clearly into the orb. The shrine of the Templo Mayor has become spacious and regal in Picart's engraving, with the god placed before rich drapery on a tall pedestal embellished with ornamental chains and weapons. Several of the visual references are distinctly Roman. Not only are the chains and weapons appropriate in a general sense for the god of war, but their public array on the pedestal specifically mimics the Ro- man tradition of displaying as trophies the weapons captured in war. Huitzilopochtli's chair is a sella, a military folding stool used especially by Roman generals, which in the early medieval period was adopted by kings.114 By these obvious visual devices Huitzilopochtli is defined according to the classical conceptions of general and king. These engravings comprise what can be considered the more classi- cal, humanistic tradition of viewing Huitzilopochtli, paralleled textu- ally by the comparison of Aztec deities to pagan gods. Most of the Spanish friars working in Mexico compared Huitzilopochtli to the Ro- man war god Mars, and they were surprisingly neutral and objective when they described his physical presence, as has already been men- tioned. In some contexts many of the friars were also seemingly neu- tral when they described the nature of the Aztec god and Mexican paganism in general. For example, Motolinia recorded, without decry- ing the practice, that Aztec idols and Christian images were wor- shiped side by side just after the Conquest. Acosta saw idolatry merely as the result of a lack of religious development, where in the normal course of time idolatry would eventually be replaced by Christianity. But Acosta also discussed idolatry as being the specific effect of the work of Satan who had deceived the Indians, and in this he can be considered part of the current that linked the Aztec god to the Chris- tian devil. Diabolical analogy Even among the Spanish friars who compared Aztec gods to Roman gods were those who saw Aztec deities as manifestations or active in- struments of Satan. Motolinia, for example, referred to Aztec gods as "demons" and to their temples as "houses or hells." Duran called them "devils" and was appalled that even as late as the second half of the sixteenth century Aztec sculptures remained visible in Mexico 114 Elisabeth Blair MacDougall first pointed out to me that Huitzilopochtli sits on a Roman camp stool; Michael McCormick then confirmed and amplified this idea, and he related the display of weapons to the Roman tradition. Schramm and Mutterich, Denk- male der deutschen Konige und Kaiser (1962), p. 36, pl. 57, illustrate and discuss an early Carolingian sella that served as a throne; like the Huitzilopochtli seat, its supports also end in animal heads.</page><page sequence="72">68 INCARNATIONS OF THE AZTEC SUPERNATURAL City. Sahaguin said all were "devils, demons, evil spirits"; he particu- larly equated Huitzilopochtli with the devil's man and the diety Tez- catlipoca with Lucifer.115 This view of the Aztec gods as devils was to have considerable du- ration, transmitted in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century accounts of the New World. "Vitzliputzli," a corruption of Huitzilopochtli, even entered German folklore at least by the first half of the eighteenth cen- tury as one of the devils in the puppet play of Dr. Faustus on which Goethe based his great work; there, Vitzliputzli joined Astarot, Haribax, and other ancient foreign deities to compose the group of evil spirits from which Mephistopheles was chosen.116 The diabolical view of the Aztec gods was as widespread as the classicizing view. It grew out of and helped to form the broader image of the American Indians as morally degenerate peoples who had been tricked from grace by the devil; this image itself fell in fundamental opposition to the idea of the American Indian as embodying noble virtues. Visually the diabolical analogy was expressed both by Mexican art- ists in several early colonial sources and by European artists trying to recreate Aztec images on the European continent. From Mexico the illustrations accompanying one of the manuscript versions of Diego Mufnoz Camargo's Historia de Tlaxcala are a case in point. Created in the mid 1580s, several of the drawings present Aztec gods in the guise of devils. Figure 28, for example, presents the first body of twelve Franciscan friars, the Franciscan Twelve as they are called, who ar- rived in Mexico in 1524 to proselytize among the Indians, kneeling at the foot of a cross while devil-like creatures flock above. The devils have the standard claws, tails, horns, and bat wings of medieval dev- ils, and in an interesting mixing of elements, some also have the head- dresses and face paint of Pre-Columbian gods. Pointed ovals attached to their noses are sacrificial flint knives, drawn according to the Pre- Hispanic convention and placed on the noses as they would be in Pre- Hispanic painted codices. In other illustrations, the friars set fire to Aztec temples and drive out purely European-style devils, or they cre- ate an immense bonfire fueled by native cult images and furnishings from the temples.117 One of the versions of the Templo Mayor in Diego Duran's history of the Indies of 1579-81 houses diabolical idols. When this chronicler de- scribed the cult image of Huitzilopochtli, as previously mentioned, his artist painted a straightforward representation of the god's tzoalli im- 115 Motolinia, History (1951), pp. 99-100; Pagden, Natural Man (1982), pp. 168-178; Du- ran, Gods and Rites (1971), pp. 20-23, 51, 180-182; Sahagun, Florentine Codex (1950-82), Bk. 1, pp. 64, 67-68. 116 Palmer and More, Faust Tradition (1936), pp. 241, 261; Faustus Puppet Play (1893), pp. 3, 14-17.

Tlaloc on the left has a horrific serpentine face, a serpentine tail, claws, and monstrous bleeding faces on his joints, and he holds a long serpent. Fronted by a gory sacrificial scene, Huitzilopochtli on the right is presented in a similar monstrous form with diabolical accou- trements. Hairy demons, the equivalent of the common medieval black imps, hover about the shrines.118 In Sahaguin's Florentine Codex, too, when the chronicler described the Templo Mayor in his section on native architecture, his artist drew the occupants of the temple as demons (Fig. 30). Elsewhere in the same codex and in the earlier Primeros Memoriales draft (Fig. 3), the god appeared simply in his anthropomorphic form attired with his at- tributes of costume detailed, but when Sahaguin's artist came to pic- ture the actual statues in the Templo Mayor, he gave Tlaloc (on the left) a bearded goat-like visage and presented Huitzilopochtli as an open-mouthed devil. The adjacent text says that the "image of the de- mon, the Devil, was guarded there."119 The Sahaguin drawing of Huitzilopochtli's tzoalli dough image that was modeled and adorned during the last Toxcatl festival in 1520 (Fig. 18) is also more monstrous than other representations of the god in the codex. Additionally, it is pictured frontally, in distinctive contrast to Pre-Columbian paintings of gods and deity impersonators, which are almost universally in pro- file. These features suggest Sahaguin's tzoalli image is not derived from a Pre-Conquest pictorial prototype but was instead created from the mind of the artist after a reading of the text. Even Sahaguin who ex- tolled the virtues of Aztec culture and had compared Huitzilopochtli with the Roman Mars, also equated the god with the Christian- European devil, and his artist so depicted the god's form. Published engravings continued this diabolical tradition. Antonio de Herrera fostered the image of a demonic Huitzilopochtli in his monumental Historia general de los hechos de los castellanos en las Islas y Tierra Firme del Mar Oceano of 1601-1615 when the god was included in one of the vignettes on the title page to the "Descripcion de las Yndias" (Fig. 31). Herrera's Spanish engraver, Juan Peyrou, had access to a now-lost painted manuscript created in mid-sixteenth-century Mexico that pictured and described Aztec gods and rites, a manuscript of the so-called Magliabechiano Group, and he took his image of the Aztec god from a scene that illustrates the act of native cannibal- ism in front of the deity Mictlantecuhtli, Lord of the Land of the 118 For a discussion of imps see Russell, Lucifer (1984), pp. 130, 132, 210. 119 Sahagun, Florentine Codex (1950-82), Bk. 11, p. 269.</page><page sequence="75">FIG. 29 Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan in the historical treatise of Diego Durdn's Historia, fol. 131r (after Durann 1967 II, pl. 30) FIG. 30 Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan in Bernardino de Sahagun's Florentine Co- dex, bk.

The same manuscript Herrera's engraver used also contained a painting of the tzoalli dough image of Huitzilopochtli (preserved also in the Codex Magliabechiano, Fig. 20), but the engraver chose not to reproduce this image of Huitzilopochtli, which more accurately presented the god's visual attributes; instead the engraver selected the demonic figure in the company of cannibalistic Indians to convey his understanding of the nature of the principal Aztec god. This version of Huitzilopochtli reached a large audience through many reeditions of Herrera's Historia and of the "Descripcion." The publishing house of Theodore de Bry even incorporated the image into its own visual repertory when the de Brys reproduced the title page in their 1624 edition of Herrera's "Descripcion," which formed part twelve of the "Grands voyages" series.121 The de Bry engraving of Huitzilopochtli that accompanied Acosta's history (Fig. 24) figured prominently in the classicizing tradition of the Aztec god, but the "Grands voyages" series also contained other en- gravings that stressed the analogy with the devil. The illustration of the Templo Mayor (Fig. 33), which also illustrated the 1602 de Bry edi- tion of Acosta's history, is a wildly fanciful and ominous presentation of the temple. The monumental stepped pyramid has been rendered as an odd stacking of cylinders, the top one integrated with a tzompantli or skull rack, which is capped by a square platform and mounted by a series of free-standing stairs. Seated in the dark shadows of hulking effigy shrines, the two cult images are horned, animal-legged devils that add menace to the scene of human sacrifice before them. They crouch on their haunches and would seem to imperil any visitors with their outstretched arms. Away from the center of action, little gods carried by priests (on the far right and beneath the central stairway) are also horned and demonic. Heavy clouds and the way the effigy shrines are cut off by the top edge of the engraving help impart a sin- ister and oppressive tone to the scene. The frontispiece to part four of the "Grands voyages," which with parts five and six contains Girolamo Benzoni's history of the New World, shows another Pre-Columbian idol (Fig. 34). This time, he is fully in the manner of a European devil, complete with horns, beaked nose on an animallike face, bat wings, furred legs, clawed feet, and a pitchfork. Since Benzoni's text discusses the worship of zemi idols by the Arawaks of Hispafiola, the frontispiece image may have been in- tended to portray a zemi, although it does differ from the illustration 120 See Boone, Codex Magliabechiano (1983), pp. 47-52, for a discussion of the creation of and sources for these vignettes. 121 De Bry, Novi Orbis pars duodecima (1624).

The monstrous face on his torso is consistent with some European devils. There, the appearance of faces on the chest, belly, or buttocks was seen as reflecting Lucifer's inner moral monstrosity.124 But the torso face also has as its prototype one of the monstrous races of hu- manity originally described by Pliny the Younger in the first century A.D. and carried in popular imagination and especially the minds of the explorers and conquerors in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. These are the Blemmyae, headless people with their faces on their chests, who lived in the deserts of Libya, according to Pliny. Like the other monstrous races, the Blemmyae populated the poorly known ex- otic lands considered to be far from the centers of Western civilization. But as the world became better known through geographical explora- tion and as the existence of some of these races in their reported homelands became less likely, some of the races were shifted to lesser known regions and eventually to the New World.125 Columbus's and Cortes's concern with locating the Amazons and monstrous races has already been mentioned. The Blemmyae, too, were thought to popu- late parts of the Americas. The map of the Americas executed by the Turkish geographer Piri Reiss in 1513 pictured unicorns and an aceph- alic man in the area of northeast South America.126 Sir Walter Raleigh, in his account of his 1595 voyage to Guiana, not only reported Ama- zons and described their customs, but he described a nation of Blem- myae, calling them the Ewaipanoma, who were reported to live along the Caora River, although he had not seen them himself.127 Before the end of the sixteenth century, illustrations of the Amazons and the headless people of the Guianas made their way into the "Grands voy- 122 De Bry, Americae pars quarta (1594), pl. 24.

Pliny's Blemmyae came to be par- ticularly associated with the Americas, and the belief in headless men in the Guianas continued well into the eighteenth century.130 Thus, it is reasonable that European engravers might have particularly wished to picture American devils with monstrous faces on their torsos. Huitzilopochtli merges with this devil in the fantastic view of the god that is included in Arnoldus Montanus's description of the New FIG. 35 Ewaipanoma, men with faces on their chests, in the fifth part of Levinus Hul- sius's travel series, Kurtze Wunderbare Beschreibung.

The engravings range from excellent and factual views of New Amsterdam to wholly imaginary visions of the native population and wildlife of North and South America, and they often embody the mannerist fantasy that still touched ideas about the New World. Van Meurs's image of Huitzilo- pochtli combines the basic devil form derived from de Bry's Benzoni frontispiece (Fig. 34) with what may be considered a more classicizing view coming probably from the Acosta tradition, all enhanced with novel amendments. Huitzilopochtli has the torso face and bat wings seen in Fig. 34, but his hairy lower body is more clearly Pan-like with cloven hooves. Perhaps from the classical interpretation in de Bry's Acosta engraving (Fig. 24) come Huitzilopochtli's benign facial expres- sion, his feathered headdress, arm bands, heavy ear loops, feathered shield, and arrows. The image is not based on any single earlier illus- tration of Huitzilopochtli, nor is it entirely founded in Montanus's written description of the god.132 The accompanying text is itself a blending of Acosta's description of Huitzilopochtli and an account of some of the elements in the engraving. For example, the text says that Huitzilopochtli was seated on a blue throne, and it describes the god's baton as "a truncheon, full of blue crooked streaks like serpents," both of these elements having been interpreted differently by the engraver. Yet the text and engraving do agree on the laurel branch, the ancient Greek symbol of victory, above the shield, on the form and placement of the shield and arrows, and on the diabolical version of the statue itself. In other respects, van Meurs interpreted his subject freely. He stood Huitzilopochtli on a stage faced with feathers and emblems of war, alluding to an analogy with Mars, and he gave the serpent heads at the ends of the poles the appearance of long-snouted wolves or dogs. His temple is a spacious hall, draped, screened, and teeming with the activity of American Indians in their standardized feathered skirts and headdresses, and such other exotic types as Africans and Turks. On the far right, a Florida warrior in a helmet fashioned of a bird pelt has been excerpted from earlier de Bry engravings.133 131 Montanus, De Nieuwe en Onbekende Weereld (1671), op. 220; Montanus, America (1671), op. 296.

The descriptions of Japan and China must equally have been in van Meurs's mind when he was illustrating and printing Montanus's description of the New World, and this probably accounts for some of the exotic, oriental flavor in his Huitzilopochtli engraving. Montanus's book, and van Meurs's wondrous engravings, helped gratify the demand for American exoticism in the Low Countries. The Dutch West India Company had been founded fifty years before, and more and more the Netherlands was looking not just to the Far East but also to America. Amsterdam and Antwerp had been major pub- lishing centers for illustrated books on the New World in the late six- teenth and seventeenth centuries,136 and the van Meurs engraving of Huitzilopochtli in particular became an inspiration for other artists. Bernard Picart used several of the engravings in Montanus as sources for many of his own illustrations for the Ce're'monies publication of 1735. He even used the Huitzilopochtli engraving in creating his very different interpretation of the Aztec god, previously discussed as a classicizing image (Fig. 27). From van Meurs, Picart borrowed the pedestal hung with weapons and the canine-headed serpent poles, and he may have been influenced by the helmet in the form of a bird pelt, which he used to represent Huitzilopochtli's hummingbird- headed helmet.137 Picart seems also to have absorbed some of the the- atricality of van Meurs's presentation. In the seventeenth century, van Meurs's version of the god was re- drawn and included among the several hundred engravings that illus- trate Allain Manesson Mallet's five-volume cosmography, Description de l'Univers, published in Paris in 1683 with a second edition, pub- lished in Frankfurt am Main, following in 1686 (Fig. 37).138 Mallet's artist reproduced van Meurs's idol with fidelity, only substituting a li- on's face for the grimacing human face on the torso and translating the striped baton into a torch. The greatest change was in the ambience of the temple, for Mallet's artist transformed van Meurs's vast and richly 134 Montanus, Atlas Japonnensis (1670); Atlas Chinesis (1671). 135 Montanus, Atlas Japonnensis (1670), p. 91. 136 Honour, European Vision (1975), pp. 99-100; Hunnewell, Illustrated America (1890), p. 77. 137 Picart used the pose of the van Meurs statue for his "Idoles de Tabasco"; Picart, Ce'remonies (1735), vol. 6, pl. 24. 138 Mallet, Description de l'Univers (1683), (1686).</page><page sequence="86">FIG. 37 Huitzilopochtli, in Allain Manesson Mallet's Description de l'Univers, Paris, 1683, vol. 5, 311 (fig. 135) (photo: The Newberry Library)</page><page sequence="87">EUROPEAN VIEWS OF THE AZTEC GOD 83 appointed space, bustling with activity, to a quieter and smaller shrine. The hordes of visitors were replaced by less than two dozen worshipers, and the pedestal was stripped of its weapons array, leav- ing only the feathers. He also reduced the airy balcony in van Meurs's temple to two pendentive niches, for the display of two deity images. These he took from the top two vignettes on the title page of Herrera's "Descripcion"-those labeled as Huitzilopochtli and "el dios de los fi- nados" (Fig. 31). Mallet's engraver reached back to earlier images of Huitzilopochtli to amplify van Meurs's exotic and monstrous portrayal of the Aztec god. By the early eighteenth century Huitzilopochtli was less an Aztec deity than he was a reflection of European ideas about distant and foreign gods. A construct of the mind, to borrow John Elliott's phrase,139 his physical form was built of varied visual elements drawn from the vast pool of European images that had been further enriched with an infusion of exotic forms. Picart's Huitzilopochtli (Fig. 27) is nothing more than a somewhat strangely garbed Roman god, well proportioned and classically semi-nude, who regally commands from atop an orb on a richly draped stage. The van Meurs god, in Monta- nus's description (Fig. 36), is equally fabricated of mixed but fairly fa- miliar elements, and although this Huitzilopochtli stems largely from the diabolical tradition, he has been rendered benign and merely ex- otic by his regular facial features and the Eastern flavor of the scene. Half demonic with his brittle wings, monstrous torso face, and Pan- like legs and hooves, he is nonetheless also semi-nude, bejeweled, and crowned with a majestic plume. These features, plus the laurel branch and the gaily striped baton, helped to destroy much of the menace imparted by the diabolical half. What remains of this menace is effec- tively negated by his spacious and lively decorated shrine that receives a bustling panorama of humanity and opens upon a serene landscape. The image tells us almost nothing about the Aztec god, but it says much about seventeenth-century Dutch opinions of exotic gods and the available visual repertoire. 139 Elliott, Old World and New (1970), p. 28.</page><page sequence="88">VII.

The Pre-Conquest Mexican evidence suggests that even the Aztecs had not one, but mul- tiple Huitzilopochtlis, although this seeming multiplicity may only be a signal that we lack sufficient sources to attempt an understanding of the god's manifestations. Within the Pre-Columbian world only rare sculpted images of him still exist, revealing a human deity imperson- ator garbed in the elements of his costume in the act either of ritual bloodletting or of warfare. Excepting the hummingbird headdress, specific visual elements do not identify him. Rather, as with other Az- tec gods, his sacrality and nature (teotl) were defined and his changing roles were formed by groupings of his visual attributes gathered into cult images or teixiptla. The actual formation of the teixiptla seems to have created the deity, and the individual visual elements of his cult- in this case especially his blue striped face paint and blue body paint, the heron- and eagle-feathered headdress, the star-bordered black sky mask, the xiuhcoatl, and the shield and darts-each embodied a part of his character. Differing aspects of the god make equally sparse appearances in the pictorial codices created in sixteenth-century Mexico in the native tra- dition. There Huitzilopochtli occasionally takes active human form in the migration histories when his presence as a warrior or other partic- ipant is needed during the migration of the Mexica from their mythical homeland to Tenochtitlan; otherwise, only the passive tlaquimilolli, the sacred bundle that contains the instruments of his cult, is pictured ei- ther being carried by the god bearers or set in place in a temple along the journey. In the native style ceremonials, Huitzilopochtli appears only as a symbol for one of the monthly feasts, predominantly Pan- quetzaliztli, where he is manifest either as a human impersonator or as a tzoalli dough figure. Formed of ground amaranth seed during the Panquetzaliztli feast, a tzoalli figure of the god also accompanied the statue of the god in the Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan. Just as Huitzilopochtli appears in a myriad of forms in the pictorial manuscripts, the cult image of the god in the Templo Mayor was de- scribed in differing ways by the Spanish conquerors and friars. These descriptions fall into basically two traditions, however, one begun by Diego Duran and dispersed through Jose de Acosta's natural and 84</page><page sequence="89">SUMMARY 85 moral history, and the other publicized by Francisco Lopez de Gomara that incorporated principally the accounts of the conquerors Hernan Cortes and Andres de Tapia. Nearly all the other writers who were to communicate the cult image of Huitzilopochtli in the Templo Mayor drew from these traditions. The presentations range from a detailing of costume attributes (given by Duran-Acosta) to a spirited report on hideous, bejeweled, and blood-soaked idols (which impressed the conquerors), but the traditions have enough congruent details to sug- gest the Templo Mayor was somewhat crowded with images. A feather-cloaked and jeweled tzoalli form sat beside a permanent cult statue, both embellished with the costume elements of the god ren- dered largely in precious materials. Two colossal statues covered in mosaic seem to have been secondary figures attendant to the god, and tucked away in a recess was the sacred bundle, the tlaquimilolli, of the cult. Following the Conquest, the Mexican view of the Aztec god gave way to more purely European views that recreated Huitzilopochtli afresh using Old World analogies. The god came to be seen either in terms of the classical world of pagan deities or within the Christian universe as a pernicious figure. In this, Huitzilopochtli was firmly cou- pled with the differing views of native American cultures. Those his- torians and chroniclers who saw Aztec civilization as being equal in intellectual and artistic capacity to the ancient cultures of the classical world (which were also heathen) described Huitzilopochtli and the other deities of the Aztec pantheon as the New World counterparts of Roman gods. The other chroniclers, who saw instead the barbarism and horror of human sacrifice, viewed Huitzilopochtli not just as a focus of idolatry but as a full manifestation of Satan. Visually, Huitz- ilopochtli was presented to Europe either in the Roman analogue or as a diabolical figure, and the two interpretations came to be expressed in increasingly fanciful ways. More European features and less old Mex- ican ones were assigned to the cult figure, and elements from the clas- sicizing tradition came to be exchanged for some of those from the diabolical form. In each case, European artists created the Huitzilo- pochtli that best reflected their own views of distant foreign gods. Postscript: Huitzilopochtli and Quetzalcoatl In the years between the early eighteenth century and the late twen- tieth century, Huitzilopochtli has fared rather poorly as the premier Aztec god. His importance has gradually diminished in the minds of scholars, artists, writers, and informed laymen interested in Pre- Columbian societies, so that now hardly anyone outside Mexico knows his name. Some new interest was generated with the excavation in 1978-82 of the Aztec Templo Mayor in Mexico City, which has laid</page><page sequence="90">86 INCARNATIONS OF THE AZTEC SUPERNATURAL bare Huitzilopochtli's very altar and sacrificial stone, but the god him- self was absent physically, and the stress of the archaeological analysis has justly been on the economic and political evidence. Thus, even with his shrine revealed, Huitzilopochtli is not the deity who comes immediately to mind in a discussion of Mesoamerican religion. Quetzalcoatl is. Quetzalcoatl is for most people the quintessential Aztec god. The quetzal-feathered serpent, he is the Plumed Serpent of D. H. Lawrence, seen today as the ancient god of indigenous Mexican spiri- tuality, a bringer of culture, and the overseer of a Pre-Hispanic Golden Age. Where Huitzilopochtli has suffered a decline in reputation, Quetzalcoatl has fared well since the Conquest of Mexico. Beginning with the seventeenth century, Mexican historians, theologians, and politicians, as well as writers and painters, have habilitated the feath- ered serpent, forming him into what we now have as a twentieth- century version of Aztec divinity. In the sixteenth century the chroniclers described Quetzalcoatl sim- ply as one among the dozen or so principal Aztec deities; he was the wind god and the patron deity of the city of Cholula. Yet they also identified him, as did the Aztecs, with the quasi-historical figure, Ce Acatl Topiltzin (One Reed, Our Prince), a man-god who governed the Toltecs, the glorious ancestors of the Aztecs, during their greatest age. Tula, the capital of the Toltecs, was seen as a rich paradise of harmony, culture, and agricultural abundance, where ears of corn were larger than a man could carry, where cotton grew in different colors, where the arts and sciences flourished, and where the gods demanded only offerings of butterflies, jades, and flowers. A pious and virtuous fig- ure, Quetzalcoatl was tricked into disgracing himself by the militaristic and malevolent forces of the rival god-priest Tezcatlipoca and was driven from the city. Continuing according to the legend, Quetzalcoatl traveled east eventually to the Gulf Coast where he either set himself on fire and rose from the flames to become Venus the Morning Star (according to one account) or set sail across the sea on a raft of ser- pents, vowing to return one day to claim his throne (according to oth- ers). The latter version of the legend gave rise to Motecuhzoma's identifying Cortes with the returning Quetzalcoatl; Cortes landed on the Gulf Coast in 1519, the year One Reed in the Aztec count when Quetzalcoatl's return was predicted. Cortes himself reported to Charles V that Motecuhzoma believed Cortes and his men to be Quetzalcoatl's followers, and the case of mistaken identity became an integral part of the Conquest literature. The early chroniclers and conquerors did not, however, exalt Quetzalcoatl above other gods. This remained, as Jacques Lafaye has successfully established in his Quetzalcoatl and Guadalupe, for the Mex- ican Creole thinkers of the seventeenth century and later, who linked Quetzalcoatl with the Apostle St. Thomas and saw in the Aztec god a</page><page sequence="91">SUMMARY 87 force of incipient monotheism and Christianity.140 As early as 1607 Gregorio Garcia in his Origen de los indios del Nuevo Mundo reflected on earlier writings that had St. Thomas proselytizing in Brazil,141 but the great seventeenth-century Mexican scholar Carlos Siguenza y Gongora developed these ideas much further and specifically identified the Az- tec god with the Apostle. The famous essay was Fenix del Occidente, San Thomas Apostol, hallado con el nombre de Quetzalcoatl entre las cenizas de antiguas tradiciones conservadas en piedras, en teomoxtles tultecos y en cantares teochichimecos y mexicanos, which was never published but was widely circulated and cited during Siguenza's life and after his death by such historians as Lorenzo Boturini, Mariano Veytia, and Francisco Javier Clavijero.142 This identification of Quetzalcoatl with St. Thomas, known as the evangelizer of the Indies, arose with and itself supported the develop- ment of the Mexican national consciousness. Creole writers concerned with promoting the greatness of Mexican, as opposed to Spanish Colo- nial, traditions saw in Quetzalcoatl the benign ruler of an Indian Golden Age, a chaste foe of human sacrifice, who promoted the belief in one creator-god, who prophesied the Conquest, and who promised to return to restore his rule. By linking this figure with St. Thomas, they thus proved nascent Christianity to have been in America centu- ries before the Conquest, a conception that in turn supported the hu- manity and spiritual potential of the Mexican Indians and planted intellectual greatness firmly in the Pre-Columbian past. The political potential of this position was then developed at the close of the eigh- teenth century by the Dominican father Servando Teresa de Mier, who saw Quetzalcoatl as the sixth-century Saint Thomas of Mylapore. Building on the writings that preceeded it, Mier's argument helped the Mexican "Indian" church to anchor itself as historically separate from Spain. Thus it effectively undermined the spiritual foundation of the Spanish Conquest, and lent further support to increasingly felt Mexican rights to independence.'43 40Lafaye, Quetzalc6atl and Guadalupe (1976), especially pp. 177-208. 14"Garcia, Origen (1981), pp. 299-300. As early as 1579, Diego Duran had explored the idea of St. Thomas preaching specifically in Mexico, but his thoughts did not influence others. Duran's treatise on the Aztec gods and rites, in his Historia, began with a dis- cussion of the priest-ruler Topiltzin, whom Duran identified not with Quetzalcoatl but with the ruler Hueymac. Although Duran did not actually say that Topiltzin was St. Thomas, he implied strongly that he believed this to be the case. Duran's suppositions in this direction, however, were without great impact on others, because Duran's Histo- ria was not published until 1867-80, and Tovar and Acosta, who used his unpublished manuscript, played down the St. Thomas connection.

This past was seen as being embodied not by Huitzilopochtli, who was probably too blood-stained and horrific, but by the more virtuous god Quetzalcoatl, patron of learning and giver of culture. Octavio Paz has noted that Quetzalcoatl then "disap- peared from the historical horizon of the nineteenth century, except in the case of writers and artists who, without much success, chose him as the subject for their works. He disappeared but did not die."'44 In- deed he was later resurrected at the opening of the twentieth century for the revolutionary politics associated with land reform and was linked anew to ardent indigenismo. As Jacques Lafaye has observed, Quetzalcoatl then underwent a "lit- erary renaissance .. . contemporaneous with the rise of the indigenist movement in the 1920s and 30s."145 Mexican poets in particular were, and continue to be, fascinated by this mythical image of the Indian past. In English, works range in scope and seriousness from J. H. Cornyn's "The Song of Quetzalcoatl" of 1930,146 to D. H. Lawrence's The Plumed Serpent of 1926. Incorporating the resurrectional promise of the old Quetzalcoatl legend into Lawrence's search for a primitive Mexican world that existed before Europeans came to America, The Plumed Serpent has had a profound influence on the untutored concep- tion of Aztec divinity. In the visual arts, too, the focus was on Quetza- lcoatl, as culture hero and redeemer. The highest expression of this must lie in the Dartmouth College fresco cycle executed by Jose Clem- ente Orozco in 1932-34. There Orozco organized his monumental in- terpretation of ancient Mexican civilization around the central myth of Quetzalcoatl and the Pre-Columbian Golden Age. Visually he pre- sented Quetzalcoatl as a white-robed, white-bearded, Old Testament prophet battling forces of malevolence. In these centuries when historians, theologians, politicians, writers, and artists were remodeling Quetzalcoatl into the embodiment of Pre- Hispanic spirituality and culture, they largely disregarded Huitzilo- pochtli. In Europe he had been remade visually in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and early eighteenth centuries to conform to European ideas about exotic gods from distant lands. After that, his religious na- ture and physical image remained static. The Mexican intellectuals largely ignored him in developing national symbolism and iconogra- phy, with the exception, ironically, of Siguenza y Gongora, the cham- pion of Quetzalcoatl as St. Thomas, who included Huitzilopochtli as a personified virtue in the triumphal arch he designed to celebrate the 144Paz, "Foreword," in Lafaye, Quetzalc6atl and Guadalupe (1976), p. xxi. 145Lafaye, Quetzalc6atl and Guadalupe (1976), p. 310. 1"This is reported by Keen, Aztec Image (1971), p. 536, to be "a well-made, tuneful version of the legend employing the meter of Longfellow's Hiawatha."</page><page sequence="93">SUMMARY 89 entry of the Conde de Paredes into Mexico City as Viceroy in 1680. Other than Siguenza y Gongora, however, no one wrote essays, po- ems, plays, or novels about Huitzilopochtli. He was included as a de- ity in stories about the Aztec past, but always wrapped in infamy. The Mexican muralists did not feature him, except occasionally as a diabol- ical counterpoint, in creating their new, solidly Mexican, iconography and pictorial sensibility. Huitzilopochtli is probably insufficiently human to attract the kind of revitalization in the hands of writers and visual artists that raised Quetzalcoatl to prominence. His presence as a god outweighs any hu- man incarnation he might have had as a tribal leader, and as a god, he is principally associated with human sacrifice, a singularly distasteful subject that is de-emphasized in tributes to Aztec history and culture. Although we recognize Huitzilopochtli as the spiritual force behind the great Aztec civilization, he remains to us essentially demonic. In this way we are like the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Euro- pean engravers who combined in Huitzilopochtli's visual image ele- ments from the diabolical and classically heroic traditions.</page><page sequence="94">BIBLIOGRAPHY Acosta, Jose de 1979 Historia natural y moral de las Indias.
