Indeed my first crude notes were reduced to writing merely as a means of trying to solidify the position of myself and other members of the "Carbondale Circle" (Vuk Brontosaurusky, Hoot Gibson Ma gruder, Fleur de Lysol-Javal, Hermaphrodite Briggs, Walter Ng, B.

A luridly mutilated mim eographed "version" was pirated, however?probably by the same un derachieving boors who tried so fecklessly to make me the laughing stock of the memorable Linda Darnell Festival at Bowling Green? and given wide circulation at the 1979 Ozone Park Conference on the Phenomenology of Phenomenal Phenomena.1 What with the ridicule, the misprints, the transposed running heads, and all, I was made to look like?not to put too fine a point on it?an idiot. So here. I Regard, as preliminary to the problematic, the noetic opening of Eu gene Field's postsymbolist "Wynken, Blynken, and Nod," subtitled "Dutch Lullaby": Wynken, Blynken, and Nod one night Sailed off in a wooden shoe Sailed on a river of crystal light, Into a sea of dew. Already (cf. "The Gross Lexicon in and per Se," ch. CLxxm, pp. 853-922 supra) we have witnessed the horripilating potency of key notes to establish at the outset of a poem the approximate range of its problematic and, by im- no less than by ex- and com-plication, the concomitant range of its invariant solutions and isomorphically ac companying dissolutions. Hopefully the opening of the poem under examination?"Wynken, Blynken" etc.?asserts in such a "keynote" fashion the overall problematic of deterioration, beginning with the slippage of individual words from a condition of certainty (which we can denominate as the It) into a condition of obsolescence-suggesting decay (or the 't) and concluding with the slippage of (all?) persons from a state of wakefulness into a state of sleep. (A subsequent chap ter will boldly probe the tendency of children's literature to will the induction of sleep and also the ambition of this causal feature of art to extend its boundaries far beyond mere entertainment for mere chil *At that conference, incidentally, it was noted by several prominent structural ists that there was something very fishy about Edward Mendelson's so-called checklist "The Writings of Mstislav Bogdanovich" (TLS, 19 December 1975). For awe thing, a number of Slavic or Balkan items are impossible to find ( e.g., Filasaficky casopis ). For another thing Mendelson suggests that Bogdanovicn's profoundly seminal "Les structures heideggeriennes comme seul sujet de l'?criture" was published in Grammatolexis 2 (1970). Well it was not. (Not not profoundly seminal: not published.) (At least not in that journal, long associated with the distinguished name of the Amsterdamkraal.)

Art as a whole, it will be argued, takes for its final cause the hypnagogic production in each person of such a condition of fatigue, boredom, and peace that slumber is, regardless of the time of day .or availability of cots, bunks, hammocks, sleeping bags, beds, floors/etc, irresistible. After all, the only surviving English cognate of "Shantih" is "coma." This enterprise clearly constitutes a subspecies of what the canonical motif-index2 so aptly calls J2338, to wit, "Mother sells child a bill of goods'9) The manifold of complex deformations in Field's poem is balanced by a symmetrically binary manifold of complex redundancies. (1) The poem as a whole iterates the iambic rhythm (d?hnuH), which is at tacked perpendicularly by the repeated trochees (DUHduhDUHduh) of "Wynken" and "Blynken," but the threat of rhythmic deconstruction is disarmed or at least nonproliferated by the powerful presence* in the same verbal register or arena, of the con-struction of the perfect rhyme between the two words. (Much the same effect distinguishes the opening of Frost's "The Death of the Hired Man," which as a whole is in iambic pentameter; but the first line?"Mary sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table"?is neither iambic nor pentametric, so that the reader can be reinforcedly alarmed at the cte-struction im plicit in the basic syntagmatic sememe: "Mary sat . . . on the lamp flame," which perforce enrolls her permanently, I should think, among those who favor fire.) (2) The poem proceeds by a general substimp tive strategy of placing each object as part of a more comprehensive context, but "Wynken" jeopardizes the success of that strategy by (a) shrinking the field of vision (as well as the vision of Field) to one eye of the natural, primal pair, and then by (b) coding that, eye in terms of one of its functions, metonymically, a function, further more, which must necessarily remain the operation of one eye and one eye only. Two eyes, that is to say, cannot wink; that is the office of blinking which, correspondingly, can be done by two eyes only. Speaking of offices, by the way, I have carried out certain experi ments with winking and blinking in the gossamer wings and corridors of randomly selected academic office-buildings, and the only concrete result, apart from dismay, has been the congestion of my minute mail box with a plethora of anonymous notes and mysterious clippings from unidentified periodicals.

This maxi malizing function is bound up tidily in the third term of the opening phrase?"Wynken, Blynken, and Nod"?which gives the endangered consciousness: (1) a restoration of the governing iamb, just now in jeopardy from a repeated and rhymed trochee; (2) a transumptive (i.e., of course, metaleptic) form of metonymy (the function of nod ding standing for the whole existence of the head) without literal de formation (as in "ship's head"); and (3) the synthesizing presence of the setting or housing of both eyes?the wink and the blink?in one total capital function whose anatomy all but reverses the deterioration that has, constructively, eventuated in the dyad Wynken and Blynken, that is to say (as any child can see), a boustrophedon shuttling back and forth across a register composed of six terms, only one of which is "real": *Notton, *Notten, *Noddin, *Noddin, *Nodding, and, finally, Nod (verb and noun indifferently). We must ask at the beginning, as with any instance of deformation, whether the changes be random or systematic, and, as before, meta phoric analogies cut much less ice as aids to analysis than m?tonymie associations.

Here, at least, we have come far from what Rilke pungently called "the retarded core of our ultimate fruit." For here the redounding counterrhythmic couple "Wynken" and "Blynken" urge the poem in the direction of progressive deformation (and eye-formation) as well as deterioration, a motion subsumable ultimately as downward, i.e., in the direction of death, that which the souls in Poe-land mean when they moan "Nevermore." 'Wynken" is the office of one, "Blynken" of two . . . and by induction and extrapolation the series continues all the way to "*Zynken"; but, in the shapely poem at hand, the urging set up by "Wynken" and "Blynken" is nicely balanced by an equal but opposite urging from the ominous "and Nod": (1) the iamb is asserted; (2) the binary matrix of two syllables contains now two words instead of one, and the two do not rhyme, although (if you have just spent a weekend locked in a room with no company but the cassette Kenneth Burke9s Greatest Hits) their elemental literal components approach almost asymptotically the adumbration of an anagrammic pattern: a n c Nod ?in which the a I o (alpha/omega) binary set is proffered alongside a set of n's chiastically poised on the threshold of the terminal d that, significantly, concludes both words and calls up Bloom's vast accumu lation of glosses on the o/a pattern in Freud's celebrated "fort/da99 paradigm.

So here: Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes, And Nod is a little head, And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies Is a wee one's trundle-bed. In the final working out of the opposed urgings contingent on these "fishermen three" (i.e., three fishermen), two elemental settings of Special Space are sacramentally reached: Wynken, Blynken (dn). -^ Sea Nod (up) -?Sky + (It will not escape your notice that up upside-down is dn.) In this map Sea (which men traditionally go "down" to, although the canoni cal version would seem to want to read, "Men that go down in the sea in ships") embraces all of the ingredients of deterioration, devo lution, and entropy implicit in "fish," while Sky embraces those of valorization and, mutatis mutandis, improvement implicit in "star." Or in other terms: Three verbal nominal forms &lt; f wooden shoe *\ ? fish &gt; to catch crystal slipper stars The combinatorial projections of maximum organic corruption (fish continuous with mankind) and maximum inorganic sanitation (star discrete from mankind, not counting such headlines as "Catfish Be comes Superstar"), the former being analogous-metaphoric while the latter is digital-metonymic, display and enact (and, of course, sanc tion) two opposed verbal and iconic developments: -f?^ - star-fish starfish (singular with no distinct plural) - ? &gt;+ fish-star Pisces (plural with no operational singular)</page><page sequence="10">THE STATE OF LETTERS 627 ?so that singularity is aligned with corruption in exactly the same measure as, paradoxically, plurality finds itself aligned with puri fication (purificatio), both alignments implicit in the problematic paradigm of Williams's prophetic apostrophe to Gov.

[The displacement of the marine-celestial axis from star-fish to star-horse is of the same order, though not of the same logical category or precinct of praxis, as the displacement of the inherent plurality of "Blynken" to refer to one eye only.
