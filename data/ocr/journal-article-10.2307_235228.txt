LODEWIJK PALM Antoni van Leeuwenhoek. The Collected Let- ters of Antoni van Leeuwenhoek. Volume 13: 1700-1701. Edited by L. C. Palm. xiv + 422 + [xxi] pp., illus., bibl., indexes. Berwyn, Pa.: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger, 1994. $225. The project of editing the entire set of Antoni van Leeuwenhoek's letters (1632-1723) itself has a history, beginning with the commemora- tion of the tercentenary of van Leeuwenhoek's birth (1932). The project was initiated by the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences. Volume 1, containing the earliest letters-twenty-one in all, dating from April 1673 to February 1676-was published in 1939. Volume 2 (1941) was edited "in spite of the exceptional circumstances that have prevailed in Holland for over a year" (pref- ace, p. iii). Originally, twenty volumes had been planned, but it would be premature to state that the project will soon come to a close; by a cur- rent estimate, the quatercentenary of van Leeu- wenhoek's birth (2032) would seem a realistic completion date. However, the length of time re- quired for preparation and the very high price of each volume are consistent with the scientific level and the enormous significance of this proj- ect. High publishing standards and printing qual- ity have been maintained from the outset, while the format has been reduced as of Volume 10. Volume 13 contains twenty-one letters written by van Leeuwenhoek from January 1700 to July 1701; in addition, there is a letter to van Leeu- wenhoek, dated 28 May 1700, from Sir Hans Sloane (1660-1753), whose portrait of 1716 serves as the frontispiece of this volume. Of the twenty-one letters, nine are addressed to Sloane; one to John Chamberlayne (1666-1723), who translated van Leeuwenhoek's letters up to 1713 so that they could be read aloud in the Royal Society; two directly to the Royal Society; and four to Dutch contemporaries. For two letters the addressees are unknown. This edition is an interesting example of the problems due to translation: van Leeuwenhoek knew only Dutch, which he used for letters ad- dressed to the Royal Society in London; the let- ters were translated into either Latin or English for publication in the Philosophical Transac- tions. The editors, when embarking on this proj- ect in 1939, expressed their conviction that "the edition would not answer its purpose if only the Dutch text were published, for its purpose is to stand as a monument deserving the attention of admirers beyond our pale" (Vol. 1, p. 13n). Therefore all Dutch letters were accompanied by an English translation that was a combination of the original English translation of the seven- teenth century and a modem English version. But early reviewers criticized this practice, and, starting with Volume 3, the English translations are completely new. It may be regretted that readers interested in the seventeenth-century En- glish translations, which are important for the history of the reception of van Leeuwenhoek's work, have to use older editions (if available). The letters are arranged in strict chronological order, and each is assigned a number. Each letter is preceded by a double page (in Dutch and En- glish) with information as to the addressee, the manuscripts (if still in existence), and previous editions and a short summary of the contents. The text is printed in Dutch and English on fac- ing pages. Footnotes pertaining to philological problems are in Dutch, while those pertaining to the contents are in English; the two sets appear on facing pages, and they are numbered sepa- rately. Cross-references to van Leeuwenhoek's other letters prove to be quite helpful. The letters deal with microscopic observations on insects and arthropods, blood circulation, and sperma- tozoa. One letter singularly reflects van Leeu- wenhoek's arithmetical abilities in that it deals with the coal measures used in Delft and Rotter- dam. That the microscopy of insects could be dangerous to the investigating scientist becomes evident from letter no. 227, where van Leeu- wenhoek describes injuries he sustained due to bursting glass and sparks from burning charcoal (presumably during the process of preparing the lenses). The minute irregularities in his cornea resulting from these injuries stirred his interest. The well-prepared apparatus of the edition (also in both languages), which makes working with the book a pleasure, consists of a short pref- ace and introduction, a concluding bibliography, a table of weights and measures used by van Leeuwenhoek, and an index of names and sub- jects. A biographical register provides informa- tion on all persons mentioned for the first time in the letters or annotations in this volume (for others, the reader is referred to previous vol- umes). Twenty-one plates reproduce original drawings in red chalk (if preserved) sent to Lon- don by van Leeuwenhoek and engravings made there on the basis of his drawings and used in earlier editions. Considering the price of this vol- 729</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS-ISIS, 87 : 4 (1996) ume, the question may come up as to why the images (the portrait of Sloane, van Leeuwen- hoek's drawings in red chalk) were not repro- duced in color. KARL-HEINZ LEVEN * Eighteenth Century Londa Schiebinger. Nature's Body: Gender in the Making of Modern Science. x + 289 pp., illus., bibl., index. Boston: Beacon Press, 1993. $25. Since this important book came out, in 1993, commentary has centered particularly on issues of content. Londa Schiebinger has already made substantial contributions to contemporary under- Sapientia (wisdom personified) suckling two philosophers (reprinted in Schiebinger, Nature's Body, from a fifteenth-century German manuscript). standing of the history of women and science, and in Nature's Body she broadens the scope of her investigations from "women" to "gender." In this collection of essays on eighteenth-century natural history, she deftly demonstrates how the analytic category of gender can open new doors and windows on the history of science as culture. Signaling by her title a concentration on the anthropomorphic, Schiebinger tracks how a pen- chant for reading the world not just through hu- man eyes but metonymically, as if nature were human, has produced scientific documents and policies that focus "natural" facts and events through a gendered lens. An already much-re- printed chapter concerns Linnaeus's coinage of "Mammalia" as one of his six zoological classes, replacing the canonical Aristotelian "Quadrupe- dia." Schiebinger contextualizes the Linnaean taxonomic choice in terms of eighteenth-century domestic ideology and a new cult of mother- hood. Changing cultural perceptions of female breasts were much a part of the story of science at that time, and Linnaeus the taxonomist was also Linnaeus the physician who issued an attack on wet-nursing in 1752. His scientific ideas, Schiebinger argues, should not be separated from his beliefs about male/female difference and a woman's "natural" responsibilities as a mother. Assumptions about sexual difference also per- meated eighteenth-century racial science. Schie- binger explores the centrality of facial hair, for example, in theories about hierarchies of racial types; thus, priority given to a male secondary sexual characteristic led anthropologists to as- sign higher nobility to the "Caucasian or Bearded Type" than to the "Mongolic or Beard- less Type." Such interplay of sexual science and racial science appears in eighteenth-century studies that took the male skull and the European male body as the universal subject. These ideas-often not directly articulated-shaped knowledge and also determined access for Eu- ropean women and, with a few notable excep- tions, black men to scientific academies and uni- versities. In her concluding essay, "Nature's Body Wronged," Schiebinger reflects on what the out- comes of scientific work might have been had Europe's "fantasia of nature" been more inclu- sive: "How different our knowledge of the earth's plants and medicines might have been had men and women from around the globe be- gun sharing their knowledge in the eighteenth century as equals, not colonizers and colonized" (p. 206).
