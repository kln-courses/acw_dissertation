The primary results of the first four seasons of excavations enable the reconstruction of a flourishing Iron I settlement that covered the entire area of the site ? the upper mound as well as its lower terrace. The Iron I architec ture includes public buildings, installations and what appears to be cultic finds. It was preceded by LB, MB IIB and EB II?III settlements, detected in various exca vated areas. The next season will focus on some questions that arose during the first four seasons. Tel Rekhesh, in the eastern Lower Galilee, a multi-period site c. 4.5 hectares in area and roughly oval in plan, is situated on the left bank of Nahal Tavor (Wadi el Bireh). Jutting out into the steep slope of this perennial stream, the tell, atop a natural rock formation, rises more than 60 m. above the stream bed and over 55 m. above the floor of the cEn Hada Valley that defines it to the north (fig. 1).

Map showing Tel Rekhesh (facing south-east) mound has a somewhat restricted high area or 'acropolis' and a substantially lower terrace on its northern and western sides. HISTORY OF RESEARCH AND BIBLICAL IDENTIFICATION Surveys by earlier researchers (e.g., Saarisalo 1927: 68-69; Zori 1977: 116-120; Gal 1981; 1991: 22; 1992: 31-32) that included Tel Rekhesh have detected a broad range of archaeological remains on the tell and in its immediate environs. Surface finds at the site date from the fourth millennium BCE through the Byzantine and Early Islamic periods. Some of the most significant finds include imported Late Bronze Age Cypriot and Egyptian pottery, an inscribed Egyptian stele (unpublished), scarabs, an Iron Age model of a shrine and an Assyrian bowl (Zori 1977: pis. 31:2, 31:3, 33:3-5, 34:4). Aharoni (1967: 212-215) identified the site as Anahartu. biblical Anaharath, the only major settlement within the biblical allotment of the tribe of Issachar (Kallai 1986: 196; Gal 1982) which appears in the rosters of Canaanite towns from the reigns of Thutmosis III and Amenhotep II. Notably, p?trographie analy sis of three tablets from the el-Amarna archive (Goren, Finkelstein and Na^aman</page><page sequence="3">24 YITZHAK PAZ ETAL. 2004: 241-243) suggests the area of Tel Rekhesh as one possible source for clays used in their production. THE EXCAVATIONS1 A primary season of excavations, in 2006, yielded substantial evidence of archi tecture and associated finds and suggested that further exploration might prove fruitful (Paz and Kuwabara 2007). Indeed, second (March 11-22, 2007), third (August 6-23, 2007) and fourth (August 3-21, 2008) seasons have substantially contributed to an understanding of the size of the site and its importance from the third millennium BCE to the end of the first century CE through exposure of its material culture. Earlier observations of the topography of the tell by Gal (1981: 215) and the present team's reconnaissance suggested the existence of at least one fortification system and the likelihood of locating the place where it allowed access to the upper mound. Prior to excavation, the line of a wall thought to be defensive in nature was visible on the eastern side of the tell, and the north-east corner of the upper mound was thought to be the location of a gateway. Based on that hypothe sis, as well as on exploratory work conducted in the first season, several areas were excavated in order to verify these observations and to elucidate the history of settlement at the site. To date, c. 580 sq.m. have been excavated at the site (fig. 2). Work at several locations on the tell revealed a lengthy and complex history of settlement, which may have begun as early as the fourth millennium BCE, and uncovered definitive evidence of occupation during the Early Bronze, Middle Bronze, Late Bronze and Iron Ages, as well as the Persian and Roman periods. Following are descriptions of the major finds, from which this chrono-strati graphic profile is extrapolated. STRATIGRAPHY Stratigraphie designations for Tel Rekhesh are tentative since no two areas are contiguous, and relative elevations of each area differ considerably. Thus, all stratigraphie phases are represented by a localised system of numbering. 1 Excavations were carried out by a consortium of Tenri, Rikkyo, Keio and Doshisha Universities, Japan, and the Methodist Theological University of Seoul, Republic of Korea. The expedition is directed by Prof. A. Tsukimoto (Rikkyo University), Prof. M. Okita and Prof. H. Kuwabara (Tenri University). It enjoyed support from colleagues in Israel and the late Prof. M. Kochavi (Tel Aviv University) and is assisted by Dr. Y. Paz (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and Beit Beri College). Field directors are: S. Hasegawa (Tel Aviv University) for Area D4; Y. Tatsumi (Tenri Sankokan Museum) for Area D6; D.T. Sugimoto (Keio University) for Area E3; T. Onozuka (The Univer sity of Tsukuba) for Area D6; and M. Yamafuji (Waseda University) for Area C2/D2.</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 2. Tel Rekhesh: general plan Area E3 Work in Area E3, on the north-eastern edge of the upper mound, yielded evidence of an extremely complex array of stone structures and rock tumbles (figs. 3-4). Within the excavated area, massive wall segments were found, suggesting the existence of an entranceway, part of a more complex structure, which may have been in use for some time, since it appears to have been rebuilt and altered. Later buildings, as well as wall robbing and the cutting of deep pits from above the gate way complex, left only portions of it, while exposing underlying occupation deposits. The entranceway (fig. 4) and the structure to its east, which probably form one wing of a gate structure leading to the upper mound, are oriented north-east to south-west. Apparently, only its eastern half has been preserved; probes for its</page><page sequence="5">26 YITZHAK PAZ ETAL. Fig. 4. Area E3 gate complex(?): plan</page><page sequence="6">EXCAVATIONS AT TEL REKHESH 27 western side have failed to yield much evidence, with the possible exception of some partially preserved structures, including a flagstone pavement. The most prominent part of this structure is a solid wall of boulders (Wall 290), c. 1.25 m. wide, with three piers protruding into the passage on its west. To the east are two rectangular chambers integral to the complex. The southern one had two phases of flagstone pavements, one set directly upon the other, while the northern one may have had a beaten earth floor. In places, walls of this building were preserved more than 1.0 m. high. Walls encountered directly beneath the northern chamber may belong to a structural framework that was intended to stabilise the gate structure on the rather steep slope. They may, alternatively, have belonged to an earlier structure and later have been used as the gate's foundations. The fact that the chambers are long and very narrow supports a structural function. Two additional wall segments (the continuation of Walls 219 and 2323), protrud ing to the north of the entranceway, may have acted as external buttresses for the superstructure. A blocked doorway between the two chambers, the earlier, cobbled floor, and the construction of Wall 2351 (effectively making the southern chamber smaller) indicate two phases of use for the building. To the west, just beyond the line of the three short piers projecting into the passageway is a stone-lined drainage channel, preserved to a length of c. 5.0 m. It was encountered in association with a patch of a flagstone pavement, presumably part of the passageway. This drainage channel seems particularly compelling evidence for the interpretation of the structure as a gateway complex. Based on associated ceramics, the date of the earlier phase appears to be within the Late Bronze Age. Although this large structure recalls direct-entry gateways typical of MB fortifications, for the present there is no evidence for its utilisation in that period. Late Bronze pottery from this building includes carinated bowls, cooking pots with triangular, everted rims and decorated vessels of bichrome and 4 chocolate-on-white' wares. Below the remains of the substructure of the gateway, and in deep probes throughout this area, evidence of EB III remains was found, including several wall segments and deposits of restorable ceramic vessels, some possibly in situ. The question whether this structure was merely an entranceway into a large building or a gateway to the upper, fortified precinct of the mound remains open. Further fieldwork is needed to determine whether this structure is associated with a larger fortification system. During the Iron Age I, the southern part of the passageway was demolished to make way for a new building. Several walls were added to the east of the northern chamber to form a series of at least two very long and somewhat narrow rooms, possibly part of a large storage facility, similar to contemporaneous facilities known at sites such as Tel Hadar (Yadin and Kochavi 2007). Several finds recov ered from the only excavated room of this structure suggest a cultic function. These include a flagstone-paved corner, fragments of a basalt object (a stand?), a</page><page sequence="7">28 YITZHAK PAZ ETAL. three-legged ceramic strainer and a stone stele. The Iron I pottery of this stratum includes typical types, such as collared-rim pithoi, small deep bowls with everted rims and cooking pots with overhanging rims. Area D4 (Squares e9-10) Seven superimposed stratigraphie phases were encountered in a deep probe of two 4.0x4.0 m. squares (fig. 5). The profile described below represents a sounding c. 3.0 m. deep from topsoil down to bedrock, beginning with the earliest phase. Phase 7. ? A deep probe to bedrock in Square e9 yielded limited information on an EB occupation in this area. Finds included typical pot types, such as plat ters and holemouth jars. Phase 6. ? Directly above phase 7, we encountered two flimsy stone wall segments. No floors could be associated with these structures, but pottery in the fills suggests an LB date. Phase 5. ? Portions of a stone-built, rectangular structure and a small, rect angular stone-built installation to its east were encountered in Square e 10. Fill as sociated with it suggests an Iron I date. Phase 4. ? This phase is represented by a partially exposed stone-built wall in the north baulk of Square e 10, and a white plaster floor covering the entire area of adjacent Square e9. The earliest pottery associated with this floor dates from the Iron Age II. Phase 3. ? In Square e9, pits containing Fig. 5. Area D4: plan pottery of the Persian period were dug into earlier, Iron II and Iron I, remains. Phase 2. ? A stone wall segment of this phase is dated to the Early Roman period. Associated artefacts, including pottery and limestone vessel fragments, are paral leled at sites dating from the first century CE. Phase 1. ? This layer of brown topsoil is notable for containing much rocky debris mixed with Roman period pottery.</page><page sequence="8">EXCAVATIONS AT TEL REKHESH 29 Area C2/D2 This area was chosen in order to examine remains at the northern edge of a terrace below the upper mound, where evidence of a building was noted on the surface (fig. 6). Six squares have been excavated to date, revealing six stratigraphie Fig. 6. Area C2/D2: plan</page><page sequence="9">30 YITZHAK PAZ ETAL. phases, the five earliest of which are known from a restricted deep probe down to bedrock at the north-western edge of the area. Phase 6. ? The fa?ade of a large, well-built stone wall (Wall 696), oriented north-south and found in a limited exposure, may reflect either a short segment of a fortification line or the end of another defensive structure located at the edge of the rock shelf. The segment revealed may even delineate a passageway, providing access to the structure. Associated pottery suggests a late MB II date for its construction. Phase 5. ? A well-preserved white plaster floor was found in association with a stone built wall (Wall 675), most of which remains buried within the north baulk of the probe. LB pottery recovered on the floor includes typical bowls, storage jars and sherds of Bichrome Ware. Phase 4. ? This rather thick layer of fill, above the fill on the floor of phase 5 and distinct in colour from it, appears to be associated with a stone built element, only partially revealed. The area of the probe is too restricted to permit determination of the true nature of this deposit. Associated LB pottery types include cooking vessels and bowls. Phase 3. ? Above the fill of phase 4, a poorly built stone wall (Wall 647) was found in association with yellow mudbrick detritus. On the basis of ceramic finds within the soil matrix, this wall too appears to date from the Late Bronze Age. Phase 2. ? A long, well-built stone wall (Wall 609), oriented north-south, is part of a larger structure about which little is known in this phase. It may also date from the Late Bronze Age, but it continued in use in phase 1, which is dated to the Iron Age I. Another wall fragment (W692, Square j7), almost parallel to W609 and to its east, also appears to belong to this phase. Since no artefacts were found in clear association with this structure, its date remains uncertain. Phase 1. ? This phase is best known due to the substantially larger exposure of its structures. Wall 609 continued in use and was part of a large, multi-roomed rect angular complex, uncovered in all the excavated squares. Five chambers, labelled A-E, yielded information of particular interest (fig. 6). The beaten earth floor in Chamber A yielded Iron I pottery. In adjacent Cham ber B, connected to it by a doorway, several restorable vessels, mainly cooking pots, were found on a beaten earth floor. Two superimposed beaten earth floors are associated with Chamber C, both of which yielded complete Iron I vessels, including bowls, goblets, storage jars, lamps and cooking pots. Two oval, paved, stone-built installations with a common wall occupied the south-east corner of Chamber C. The easternmost one was paved with potsherds; the one to the west has a cobbled floor. The most remarkable finds from this room, recovered from its earlier floor, are two ceramic, fenestrated, cylindrical cult stands with incised</page><page sequence="10">EXCAVATIONS AT TEL REKHESH 31 decorations (fig. 7). A third ceramic, fenestrated cylindrical stand, with raised decoration representing a palm, was found in Chamber D. A notable object retrieved from Chamber E is a realistically sculpted fragment of the face of a Fig. 7. Cultic stands found in Chamber C of Area C2/D2 bearded male, part of a red-slipped anthropomorphic vessel (fig. 8a). Just outside and to the east of Chamber F, we found a pithos handle incised prior to firing with the outline of a palm tree (fig. 8b). All of the above suggest that cultic activities may have taken place in at least some of the excavated rooms of this area.</page><page sequence="11">32 YITZHAK PAZ ETAL. Fig. 8. Finds from Area C2/D2: a) fragment of anthropomorphic vessel; b) incised pithos handle Area D6 Seven squares were excavated in this area, on the eastern edge of the lower, south ern slope, during the second through fourth seasons (fig. 9). The excavation yielded evidence of what appeared to be a fortification line, probably founded on horizontal outcrops of sedimentary bedrock visible along the edge of the mound at the base of the tell. Examination of the larger area and a surface survey along the eastern side of the mound suggest that most of the defensive constructions, if they existed, were already eroded away in antiquity. This said, massive walls that could be defined as fortifications are still visible on surface levels in various locations along the eastern edge of the mound. This area is located midway between the edge of the summit and the lower, southern slope, which inclines sharply down to the south-east, making topography a critical factor in determining stratigraphie ascriptions. There are major difficul ties in assigning stratigraphie associations between structures at markedly different elevations. A series of deposits indicates a somewhat lengthy utilisation of the site at this spot. Six superimposed stratigraphie phases have been discerned. The results are discussed below. Phase 6: Occupation levels. ? Evidence for EB occupation was found in the</page><page sequence="12">EXCAVATIONS AT TEL REKHESH 3 3 ? i ? ;.&gt;.: ;- -s Fig. 9. Area D6: plan deepest probes in Square i5. These include poorly-preserved possible wall segments and pottery dating from the Early Bronze Age I, II and III. Ceramics include EB II platters of 'metallic ware' and holemouth cooking pots of brown fabric. EB III types include medium-sized storage jars, platters with everted rims and holemouths of grey fabrics. Phase 5. ? Two MB IIB infant's jar burials were found beneath a deliberately flattened pithos of that period. Each burial was accompanied by a juglet, one of the Tell el-Yehudiyeh type with a cylindrical body and the other poorly preserved, of indeterminate squat shape and unfixed. Phase 4. ? The most prominent features of this phase are two large wall segments</page><page sequence="13">34 YITZHAK PAZ ETAL. of a building (Walls 427 and 444), each c. 1.5 m. wide (fig. 9). Oriented north west to south-east, they are made of large boulders and form an entrance with a stone-built threshold. No further evidence of the enclosing walls of this structure has been encountered to date, but remains of stone paving and internal dividers associated with it are known. A long, large, rectangular basalt stone with a shal low, elongated keyhole-like depression carved into one of its four flat sides is also associated with this structure. Nearby, hollowed out of an irregularly shaped boul der, was a large, flat, shallow basalt basin surrounded by small cupmarks. A narrow, four-sided basalt stele, in secondary use as a step, lay just outside the entrance to this building. The pottery associated with this phase dates from the Late Bronze Age and includes typical cooking pots, carinated bowls, straight sided bowls and Cypriot imports such as Base Ring Ware bowls and jugs. Phase 3. ? This appears to represent two successive occupation phases. In the earlier phase, a corner of a large rectangular building ? including a long wall oriented north-east to south-west (Wall 486) abutting another wall (W408), both dating from the Late Bronze Age ? appears to have seen its first use coeval with the construction of a large, circular, flagstone-lined and paved basin (c. 0.60 m. deep; c. 2.7 m. in diameter; fig. 10). The basin may be related to olive-oil production. A similar, albeit much smaller, installation was found at the southernmost edge of the site, where it was interpreted as either a tomb or an installation (Paz and Fig. 10. Possible oil press in phase 3 of Area D6</page><page sequence="14">EXCAVATIONS AT TEL REKHESH 35 Kuwabara 2007: 23). Similar installations relating to oil production were found at Megiddo, Tel Qashish, Yoqnecam, Tell Beit Mirsim (Frankel 2006) and el-Ahwat (Beeri 2008). Not unexpectedly, several olive pits were recovered from within this structure. It is difficult to determine the age of this stone-lined structure. It may have been constructed in the Late Bronze Age or possibly in an early phase of the Iron Age I, but no later. Several observations are noteworthy: a) The basin may have originally been free-standing on the floor of an LB building of phase 4; b) the basin may have been cut into the debris of phase 4, which is dated to the Late Bronze Age and is thus later ? although how much later remains obscure; c) fill within the basin was replete with LB as well as Iron I ceramics, indicating that it was empty in the Iron Age I, when it filled up; and d) two short, small, cylindrical basalt pillar bases or column drums, each located approximately one metre away from the basin ? one to its north and the other to its south ? were also in use during the earliest phase of the basin and continued to function in the Iron Age I. Later, the earlier phase was completely covered by a surface of hard-packed earth, on which extensive evidence of burning was found, including large chunks of charred wooden beams and a thick layer of fill replete with burnt mudbrick detritus. The two cylindrical pillar bases, which slightly protruded above the floor of this phase, obviously remained in use, as did the outer walls of the earlier struc ture. Pottery assigned to this phase dates it to the Iron Age I (fig. 11). Parallels for this structure in Area M at Megiddo (Frankel 2006) date from both the Late Bronze and Early Iron I Ages. The basin went out of use when it was sealed by an earthen floor in a later phase of Iron Age I. Fig. 11. Iron I vessels found in phase 3 building of Area D6</page><page sequence="15">36 YITZHAK PAZ ETAL. Phase 2. ? The large rectangular building continued in use from phase 3, with additions of at least three rectangular rooms to its west. Evidence was found of an entrance through a small chamber on that side near the south-west corner of the structure. A hard-packed earth floor associated with this phase completely covered the debris of phase 3. This phase was apparently also destroyed by fire. Associated with it are stone tumbles, collapsed mudbrick walls, several rectangu lar-based stone (basalt and limestone) stele fragments and a large quantity of Iron I pottery, including complete vessels. Phase 1. ? Several flimsy wall segments and a pit that cut into earlier phases are dated to the Iron Age IIA. Finds from one pit include a complete ovoid jar with a ridged neck, a black juglet, Cypro-Phoenician pottery and an iron sickle blade. Phase 0. ? Pottery of the Persian period was encountered scattered in fills in this area. Area D6, Trial Square e2 This probe was opened in the central part of the southern slope. Three strati graphic phases were encountered from surface to bedrock in c. 2.5 m. of deposits. Phase 3. ? Two wall segments, one abutting the other, form corners of two cham bers of a building that was apparently considerably larger than the exposed remains. The accumulative tell soil in which this building was revealed yielded EB II and LB pottery. Among the EB finds were the figurine of a quadruped, a fragment of a piriform limestone mace-head and pottery of 'metallic ware'. Since no objects were found in direct association with this building, its date remains obscure. Phase 2. ? Two flimsy stone walls and a large deep pit are assigned to this phase. They are dated to the Late Bronze Age by associated, typical pottery types. The pit yielded one sherd of Mycenaean origin and several sherds of Cypriot imports, including Base Ring Ware and White-Slip bowls. Phase 1. ? This is a layer of fill, at least 0.5 m. thick, containing many Iron I sherds. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION The results of the four seasons of excavations at Tel Rekhesh permit a reconstruc tion of the settlement history of the site, which, for the present, appears to be quite different from data recovered in previous investigations. The selection of excava tion areas widely distributed over the tell, on its summit and at very different elevations, has allowed for a rather rough estimate of the size and func tion of different chronological episodes of human occupation of the site.

Roman + + summarises the chrono-cultural associations of remains in each area, as under stood today. The Early Bronze Age The results of the excavations at Tel Rekhesh indicate that the site may have first been settled during the latter part of the fourth millennium BCE, in the Early Bronze Age I, as indicated by the appearance of some distinctive sherds of this period. However, nothing more is known of the nature of activity in that time span. Settlement remains of the Early Bronze Age II, known from pottery and what may be occupation debris in two areas, D4 and D6/e2, appear to represent a settlement the extent of which is still vague. Note that some probes down to bedrock do not yield evidence for this period. Rather thick deposits of debris in Areas E3 and D6 suggest a substantial occupation during the Early Bronze Age III. Some loci on the higher mound yielded restorable EB III vessels. Thus, it is virtually certain that, contrary to Joffe 's (1999) assumption, settlement in the Early Bronze Age did not cover the entire 4.5 hectares of the tell, but was limited to the upper mound. It is hoped that future excavation will determine its full extent. The Middle Bronze Age The MB dating of the earliest phase of what appears to be a fortified structure in Area C2/D2 remains to be verified. Scattered finds of pottery and a few jar burials in Areas E3 and D6 suggest utilisation of the site in the Middle Bronze Age IIB. For the present, however, little is known of occupation in this period, as the remains still lie deeply buried below later deposits.</page><page sequence="17">38 YITZHAK PAZ ETAL. The Late Bronze Age The most impressive structural remains found to date on the mound belong to the substantial Late Bronze occupation. This LB settlement shows evidence for a history of internal development best known from what appears to be a gateway complex found at the north-eastern corner of the high mound. It remains to be seen whether this was part of a large building or was associated with a fortification system of the upper part of the mound. The gate system may have been contempo rary with a large complex structure in Area D6, probably associated with olive-oil production. The Early Iron Age I There is some continuity between the early phase of this period and the latest LB occupation in the utilisation and reorganisation of extant structures, such as remains of the gateway and the continued use of the large building in Area D6. Buildings of this period are of sizeable dimensions, suggesting a substantial occu pation for several generations, as determined from multiple phases encountered within different excavation areas. Here again, there is evidence for public struc tures, as well as more simple habitations. The less-than-peaceful tenure of the times appears to be reflected in evidence for violent destruction in two superim posed deposits in Area D6, the latter of which brought an end to occupation in this period. The question whether the site was fortified in this unsettled period will, it is hoped, be determined by further excavation. Although some of the structures of Iron I Tel Rekhesh may be somewhat smaller than the LB structures, it nevertheless appears that occupation at the site reached its zenith during the latter period, when it spread throughout the upper mound and 'spilled over' onto the lower terrace, as may be observed in the nature of buildings there, which are both residential and public in nature. The somewhat lengthy lifetime of these buildings, apparently over several generations, noted in the places where successive phases were encountered, as well as the material culture associated with this period, indicates some degree of prosperity for this Iron Age I community. The Iron Age II The only substantial remains from the later Iron Age ? probably portions of a rectangular fortress ? were found in two locations on the acropolis. Other contemporary remains include a few rather poor structures and pottery found in small quantities elsewhere on the acropolis and on the south-eastern flank of the tell. Some refuse pits are also assigned to this period. The Persian Period Only scanty evidence of Persian period activity was uncovered, including pits and scattered potsherds.</page><page sequence="18">EXCAVATIONS AT TEL REKHESH 39 The Early Roman Period This period is represented by fragmentary remains of buildings and large amounts of pottery found on the acropolis. The existence of a Jewish community at the site is hinted at by fragments of chalky limestone vessels of types associated with ritual purity and known from contemporary Jerusalem (Magen 2002). As mentioned above, our reconstruction of the settlement history of Tel Rekhesh on the basis of the results of the four excavation seasons reported here differs substantially from that extrapolated from data recovered in previous investiga tions (i.e., primarily surface surveys). This not only indicates the importance of verifying survey data by systematic excavation, but has substantially changed the perception of the importance of this ancient site. Undoubtedly, further exploration will add details to our knowledge of one of the major sites of Lower Galilee in the Bronze and Iron Ages.
