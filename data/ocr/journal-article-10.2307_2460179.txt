BOYARSKY Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, Kentucky 40536 Submitted February 22, 1978; Accepted January 22, 1979 When the term system is used in everyday language, one usually has a clear idea of the meaning. The word refers to an assembly whose parts interact with one another in some way. It can, therefore, be applied to a number of entities: to a simple gas, to the ensemble of particles in an atom, to a steam engine, to an industrial organization, or to an ecosystem. Such systems can be divided into two quite distinct classes, "cybernetic" and "noncybernetic" systems. While the words system and cybernetic system appear to play no central role in the thinking of many ecologists (Phillipson 1966; May 1976), there are those who consider an ecosystem to be a cybernetic system (Odum 1971; Margalef 1968). Should it be classified as such? Cybernetic systems evoke a picture of a large number of elements with intercon- nections of a complex and intricate nature, the interactions of the elements generat- ing continuous and complex changes in time an evolving, dynamic state. Such ensembles are either living systems (cells or multicellular organisms), aggregates of living systems (families, industrial organizations, societies), or cybernetic devices made by man (automated machines). These systems have one characteristic in common: All contain an "information network" (Forrester 1961) which connects the elements which compose them. They may be called "cybernetic systems" because they contain informational links whose function is to steer or regulate the system. ("We have decided to call the entire field of control and communication theory, whether in the machine or in the animal, by the name cybernetics, which we form from the Greek, xVf8pv4ztj or steersman." [Wiener 1961].) They are to be contrasted with systems which we call "noncybernetic". The latter are not organized around informational linkages. What is meant by information in this context? How can one determine which links of a system are informational and which are not? Is an ecosystem a cybernetic system ? WHAT IS "INFORMATION"? In every cybernetic system the action of one element of the system ultimately exerts an influence upon every other element of the system. We may say, therefore, that there exist links between all the elements of the system. All links, however, are not informational. The electromagnetic waves emitted by Am. Nat. 1979.

If the antenna, however, fell and crushed the house we would not consider this interaction between the antenna and the house to be informational. How do these two types of interaction differ? The word "information" derives from human intercourse; it can be applied in other contexts only in an anthropomorphic sense, as in the following example. The hormone "thyrotropin" links the pituitary gland and the thyroid gland: The greater the rate of secretion of thyrotropin by the pituitary gland, the greater, ceteris paribus, the rate of secretion of the hormone thyroxin by the thyroid gland. One can say that the hormone thyrotropin "contains information," and that thyrotropin "instructs" the thyroid gland to secrete more thyroxin. Similarly, the governor of the steam engine can be said to "instruct" a valve to let in more or less steam. One can advance beyond such metaphors, however, by noting that informational networks are charac- terized by (1) mapping, and (2) low-energy causes giving rise to high-energy effects. Mapping. As information passes along an information network it is "mapped" (transcribed) from one physical entity onto another. In the generation of speech a pattern residing in a stream of nerve impulses incident upon the vocal folds is mapped onto the air as a sound wave; this sound wave may be intercepted by a microphone which maps the pattern onto an electromagnetic wave, etc. Similarly, the nucleotide sequence of DNA is mapped into a nucleotide sequence of messenger- RNA, and the latter is mapped into an amino acid sequence of a protein. Wherever we find in nature a large number of such one-to-one correspondences between patterns (we call this "mapping") we know that we are dealing with an informational system; indeed, we know that we are dealing with a living system, or with a system derived from a living system. Cybernetic systems are filled with mappings. Energy. Informational processes, as found in nature, are always low-energy phenomena. (The minimum energy required, per Avogadro's number of bits of information, is on the order of 103 J; hence the minimum energy per bit is on the order of 10- 21 J, an insignificant amount of energy. There is no maximum energy per bit since very wasteful methods of information transmission can occur. The low energy utilization in informational networks is a result of evolutionary considera- tions: the more efficient information system offers a selective advantage.) What gives informational processes their dramatic quality ("the pen is mightier than the sword") is that at points where informational channels intersect effector systems, low-energy (informational) causes give rise to high-energy effects. Causal links which we intuitively consider to be informational all have this amplificatory characteristic. In the earliest steam engines of the Newcomen type, steam entered the cylinder when a valve was turned, and the piston rose. When the piston reached the top of the cylinder, another valve was opened to inject water so as to condense the steam; atmospheric pressure then forced the piston down. In these primitive engines the valves were actually operated by a boy who manipulated both valves by hand. The boy together with the steam engine formed a cybernetic system, the boy being a part of the information network which interconnected the parts of this system. The engine consumed on the order of 1010 J per day, the boy on the order of 107 J per day, a ratio of 1000 to 1: an example of the low-energy causes and high-energy effects implicit in informational linkages.</page><page sequence="3">NONCYBERNETIC NATURE OF ECOSYSTEMS 319 Next consider the system in the human body concerned with holding the volume of blood at a constant level. The hormone vasopressin plays an important part in the regulation of body water. Responding to information received as to the volume of blood present, the brain instructs the pituitary gland to release a stream of vasopres- sin molecules. The latter "inform" the kidneys as to. the rate with which they are to excrete water. (When the pituitary gland cannot release vasopressin, a pathological condition known as diabetes insipidus results: The kidneys may excrete as much as 30 liters of water per day.) The brain-kidney informational link assures that the kidneys excrete just enough water to maintain the constancy of blood volume. The energy cost of assembling vasopressin molecules from a pool of constituent amino acids can be estimated to be on the order of 10-6 J per day; the energy consumption of the human kidneys is on the order of 106 J per day. Why are water and glucose molecules in the blood not considered hormones, that is, informational like the hormone vasopressin? The reason is that each hormone molecule is present in only very small quantities, but nevertheless exerts a large effect. For every vasopressin molecule in the blood, there are about 1014 water molecules; for every insulin molecule in the blood (insulin regulates the blood glucose level), there are about 108 glucose molecules. The function of information. The information network in a society determines how matter (people, raw materials, finished goods, money, ...) flows through space. It serves a similar purpose in other cybernetic systems. THE NATURE OF CYBERNETIC SYSTEMS Cybernetic systems are characterized by information networks, feedback loops, and stability. Consider the human organism. The cells in the human organism are linked by an information network consisting of the cells of the nervous and endocrine systems. The cells of the information network collect information and send instructions to all parts of the organism. The neuro-endocrine information network, and the circulation (a transportation system), weld the 100,000 billion cells of the human body into a single integrated organism, as opposed to a mere collection of cells which happen to coexist in the same place. The elements of a cybernetic system are organized to operate together. This becomes possible only when they are all in communication with one another. When an element exerts an influence, this influence, by virtue of the connections among all the elements, ultimately returns to the element which first caused it. It follows that there will exist a myriad of feedback pathways in a cybernetic system. Feedback loops may be considered to be the fundamental units comprising the structure of cybernetic systems. Certain feedback loops have negative feedback, are "goal-directed," and have a stabilizing influence on the system. When the system is perturbed, the goal-directed feedback cycles react to reduce the effect of the perturbation. This leads to regula- tion: Certain variables in the system tend to be held constant. Such systems are, therefore, said to possess the property of stability.</page><page sequence="4">320 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST Noncybernetic Systems Scientists use the word "system" to denote any ensemble of elements which exhibits some cohesiveness, and which can, to the first approximation, be considered to have an existence in isolation from the rest of the universe. Many of these systems are not organized around informational linkages, and are, therefore, not cybernetic systems. They include such disparate entities as gases, solutions, bacterial cells, etc., held in containers; and objects held together by attractive forces (the solar system, the atomic nucleus, etc.). A noncybernetic system can contain cybernetic elements: A suspension of bacterial cells is an example of such a system. Noncybernetic systems can be stable, but the stability is not conferred by an information network; the sources of stability are found in physical principles, such as in the minimization of free energy (equilibria), or the minimization of entropy production (steady-states). That a system is stable, that it can resist perturbations, is not a sign that it is cybernetic. A rock is stable and can resist perturbations. Some scientists (cf. Odum, 1971) have argued that ecosystems are goal-seeking and "homeostatic," since they have a certain stability and seem to develop towards a predictable climax. There are numerous systems in the universe, however, which are stable even though they are not cybernetic; indeed, stability is a precondition for the existence of the universe. Numerous humble chemical reactions develop to a predictable climax and manifest stability. One would not describe them as goal- seeking or as manifesting homeostasis. The words goal-seeking and homeostasis have cybernetic origins, and should be reserved for cybernetic systems. That a system contains one or more feedback loops does not in itself mean that it is a cybernetic system. The existence of a thermostat-regulated furnace in a house does not convert the house and its occupants (people, insects, rodents, etc.) into a cybernetic system. It is only when such loops systematically and integratively invest all parts of a system via an information network that a system becomes "cybernetic". Cybernetic Components of Noncybernetic Systems The cell is a cybernetic system. We may take a collection of cells and, by connecting them by a communication and transportation network, create a multi- cellular organism. The multicellular organism is a cybernetic system. We may take, as in the case of man, a collection of multicellular organisms and by connecting them by a communication and transportation system create another cybernetic system, a society. It cannot, however, be inferred from this that a mere collection of cybernetic systems, such as an ecosystem, need necessarily be a cybernetic system. Were we to break down a multicellular organism with proteolytic enzymes and decompose it into its constituent cells, a collection of such cells in a flask would not constitute a cybernetic system: The cybernetic character conferred by the informational network of the organism will have been lost. DOES AN ECOSYSTEM CONTAIN AN "INFORMATION NETWORK ? The essence of the cybernetic system lies in the existence of a communication network which connects all parts of the system. It is this network which forges the</page><page sequence="5">NONCYBERNETIC NATURE OF ECOSYSTEMS 321 parts of the system into an integrated whole. Information can be propagated along this network only in two forms, as matter or as waves. The speed of propagation must be such that information can be collected and dispersed in the given system in a time which is small compared to organized changes which take place in the system. Except in the case of very small cybernetic systems, the spontaneous motion of matter (Brownian motion) is too slow for efficient information transfer. Thus, in the larger organisms, a convective system (e.g., circulation of blood or sap, cytoplasmic streaming) is provided for the movement of matter. The larger animals utilize both wave motion (nerve impulses) and convection (transfer of hormones and other substances by the blood) as a means of information transfer. In the large plants information exchange between the different parts of the plants occurs only via convective currents which carry messenger molecules. In small cells (microorganisms, mammalian cells) distances across the system are so small that Brownian motion suffices to transfer messenger molecules between the different parts of the system. In regard to ecosystems, we do not know of any wave phenomena, whether electromagnetic, acoustic, or electrochemical, which systematically connect the parts of the system. Are the different parts of the ecosystem connected systematically by pieces of matter which travel between them? The dimensions of the ecosystem are clearly too large for diffusion to be an effective method for the informational transfer of matter. There are convective currents (wind, streams) which could in principle serve to carry information in the form of matter. Their sporadic character, however, either in location or action makes it difficult to believe that they could serve to provide a systematic, organized exchange of information between different parts of the ecosystem. One would not expect a business to prosper if its goods were carried to the market by the vagaries of the wind, or by becoming accidentally attached to passing wild horses, and if the reverse flow of money or goods occurred by similar means. The elements of ecosystems do not appear to be connected by an information network. That certain cybernetic systems within an ecosystem interact by informa- tional means (foxes and hares, birds and insects) does not affect this argument. The absence of an information network has as its consequence the absence in the ecosystem of information-mediated feedback cycles. We do not perceive mechanisms whereby constituents (e.g., water) which are abundant in certain locations are distributed to locations where they are scarce. The stability of the ecosystem arises from principles more akin to those which operate in nonliving systems. Ecosystems differ from cybernetic systems in another fundamental way. In a cybernetic system there are numerous points where low-energy (informational) phenomena give rise to high-energy phenomena; in ecosystems the dominant interaction is that of high-energy phenomena giving rise to high-energy phenomena. Each day metabolic energies of 1010 to 1011 J/km2 are exchanged among the various pathways of a bay,for example; 109 to 1011 J/km2 are exchanged among the pathways of a forest (Odum 1962). These energy transformations are not modulated by low-energy (informational) influences as in a cybernetic system. In this context certain episodic events may, indubitably, exert an effect on ecosystems entirely out of proportion to their energy: parasites and pathogens may</page><page sequence="6">322 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST wipe out entire subpopulations. It has, therefore, been suggested (Caswell et al. 1971) that these elements might be considered to be of an informational nature. These interactions, however, are not part of a permanent network of causes and effects, nor do they involve the propagation of a series of mapping transformations around an ecosystem. In our opinion they should not be considered informational, any more than the propagation of a flu virus in a human population should be considered a part of the informational flow by which a society is coordinated. Interactions and Cycles within Ecosystems It is helpful to compare the feedback cycles and interactions within a typical cybernetic system, the human organism, and those of an ecosystem, the biosphere. Both are constituted of living organisms: the human organism of cells; the biosphere of plants, animals and microorganisms. The living constituents of both systems exist in a nonliving environment and interact with it: When the human organism drinks it is as though rain fell upon the cells. What are the typical interactions among the cells of the organism? With some exceptions (macrophages devouring senescent red cells), they consist of the exchange of molecules and neural messages, and of contact interactions between adjacent cells. What is the prepotent interaction among the living constituents of an ecosystem? It is probably fair to say that the dominant interaction between the different popula- tions of an ecosystem is the exchange of brute (informationally nonspecific) matter and energy. That the transfer of brute matter and energy is the dominant interaction among the living substituents of ecosystems (at least to the eye of the scientific investigator) is expressed by the fact that two dominant themes of ecological studies are the transfer of matter (foodchains, the carbon cycle, etc.), and of energy. Particularly significant is the meaning of the word cycle in relation to the human organism, as opposed to the ecosystem. In the human organism this word denotes a sequence of cause and effect which closes upon itself: The pituitary gland emits a hormone, thyrotropin, which stimulates the thyroid gland to release the hormone thyroxin; thyroxin inhibits the secretion of thyrotropin by the pituitary gland. By contrast, the word cycle as applied to an ecosystem traces the movement of an atom (e.g., carbon), a molecule (e.g., water), or energy, as each of these moves from compartment to compartment within the ecosystem. The cycle of the human organism describes the interactions among various species of cells, and leads to regulation and growth; the cycle of the ecosystem is the history of a piece of matter or energy. The Cybernation of the Ecosystem Man collects information from various parts of the world ecosystem, and transmits this information to other parts of the system. (Via this information network, information about an endangered species in Africa creates a flow of money, food, supplies, etc., from other parts of the world, a flow which exerts a positive influence upon the survival of the species.) These information flows are the beginnings of an information network which could, with further development, cause the ecosystem to become a cybernetic system.</page><page sequence="7">NONCYBERNETIC NATURE OF ECOSYSTEMS 323 On Characterizing Ecosystems as Cybernetic Systems Among the arguments put forth in support of characterizing ecosystems as cybernetic systems are the following. 1. The ecosystem has the ability to damp out environmental perturbations. This property is shared by many simple physical and chemical systems which can hardly be considered cybernetic systems. A cone standing on its base is an example, or a chemical reaction system which tends to maintain its temperature at a constant level by converting added heat into chemical energy (Le Chatelier's principle). 2. The ecosystem contains information. It is true that the ecosystem contains information, as in the DNA of the cells within it. But information content per se is not an indication of a cybernetic system. A warehouse full of books contains information, but is not a cybernetic system. That concepts obtained from informa- tion theory are used to quantify diversity in ecosystems is also no evidence that ecosystems are cybernetic systems. The information theory measure used is akin to the entropy concept developed for the analysis of simple thermodynamic systems (a gas in a container), systems which involve no feedback and which are not cybernetic. 3. The ecosystem is made up of cybernetic systems. A collection of cybernetic systems is not, however, necessarily a cybernetic system. A pellet of bacteria spun down to the bottom of a test tube is a collection of cybernetic systems, but is not itself a cybernetic system. 4. The ecosystem is a "system". The word system has been applied as a unifying concept to almost everything in the universe, beginning with the atom and passing through cells, multicellular organisms, societies, ecosystems, all the way to galaxies (Laszlo 1972). But if every configuration is a "system", what insight does the word "system" add to our understanding? 5. The ecosystem containsfeed-back loops. The example usually given here is the predator-prey encounter. It is true that when two animals interact, that a feedback loop exists between them. But a feedback loop at the level of two ecological units does not constitute a basic feedback relationship at the level of the whole ecosystem. Nor are the carbon cycle and nitrogen cycle feedback loops which connect elements distributed over space. CONCLUSION Although this paper has centered on the contrast between cybernetic and noncy- bernetic systems, the basic question has not been what word to use in describing ecosystems. Even if the word "cybernetic" did not as yet exist, even if the concept of a cybernetic system did not as yet exist, the concerns presented above would still remain. The basic problem is how to think about ecosystems, and how to place them within the scheme of known systems. We have suggested here that it would be misleading to place ecosystems within the class of other living systems (cells, multicellular organisms, societies, industrial organizations, ...). Those analyses of ecosystems which include informational path- ways, or which imply the existence of informational networks within ecosystems, do so by analogizing the ecosystem to an organism. This is a bad analogy, for organisms are not good analogs of ecosystems. Organisms, for example, have information</page><page sequence="8">324 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST TABLE 1 CYBERNETIC AND NONCYBERNETIC SYSTEMS Cybernetic Noncybernetic The cell The atomic nucleus The human organism The atom The family The earth and sun An industrial organization A gas in a container The European Economic Community The nucleus of a cell The liver An automated chemical plant An ecosystem A robot The biosphere networks which guide the long-range transport or motion of matter; ecosystems do not.
