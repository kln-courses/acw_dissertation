Moreover, the Presidential Address to the Virgil Society (1950) is included in the book, an address which had as its title Vergil and Homer. Nevertheless Many-Minded Homer will serve as an introduction, gentle in comment, devoid of odium philologicum, and most readable. There are dull passages, the long Trojan Story for example, but even these are enlivened from time to time by the author's wit: 'Myths appeal to an instinctive acceptance in a sympathy general to a class, a city, a nation, a culture, or even all humanity. They are more than untrue stories chosen at random [he has already reminded us that Chesterton referred to fairy- tales as 'the only true stories'] and just invented. "The oldest things last longest", and what is wholly new is wholly mad. You can put old content into a new form or new content into an old form; but if you put old content into an old form, that is death, and if you put new content into a new form, that is madness.' Jackson Knight was acknowledged to be a great Virgilian scholar, but although it is good that this collection of his writings on Homer should be published after his untimely death, they are neither so profound nor so original nor even so inspiring as the editorial preface might lead us to believe; Jackson Knight himself regarded them, with characteristic modesty, as 'inadequate'. **From Archilochus to Pindar2 was the only book left by John Davison; unfortunately he did not live to see it published. The volume includes essays and reviews of rare distinction, learned but at the same time enriched by a strong sense of humour and a forthright style, with frequent references to modern authors-Trol- lope, the Bronti sisters, Shaw, and others less well known. The treatment of Archilo- chus fr. 2 (iv 8opi plv pot pca pspaypvI .. .) admirably typifies his down-to-earth approach: he examines briefly the translations of Bonnard and Bowra, and points out the difficulty of leaning on a spear and simultaneously quaffing 'a steady and a con- scientious drink' of the excellent Ismarian; the rendering of iv 8opi as 'on active service', too, may suit the first two clauses ('I have pl3a, barley bread, poor stuff, on active service, but I also have 'lpaptK6s, the result of plunder'), but the third suggests doubts, 'for if a spear is likely to be a poor prop for a drinker, "active service" is obviously n The Classical Journal of the early nineteenth century, which played a role not unlike that of G &amp; R, affords ample evidence: quotations in Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Persian, even Ethiopic and Syriac, abound, and many are not translated, presumably because they were understood. Those who are interested may care to do some honest research, beginning with a letter to the Editor from Philosmaragdos on the subject of Emeralds (March I8io). The polyglots have a thin time of it nowadays, but our readers are at least spared the harrowing details of The Last Illness and Death of pre-eminent scholars: some twenty pages of the same volume are devoted to Richard Porson's end, with the unexpurgated report of the five gentlemen who carried out the post-mortem.

He proposes therefore to adopt Diehl's suggestion that bopG here refers to a ship: 'In my ship I have loaves of barley bread, in my ship I have wine of Ismarus; and I drink in my ship reclining'. Archilochus may even have ranked 'as a master of word-play with Thomas Hood--iv 8opi perhaps comes in trapa wpoasoKifav with a different meaning in the third clause' (cf. Hood's 'I leave my second leg, and the Forty-second Foot'). Scholars are indebted to Davison, and old students, who may have forgotten their lyric poets, will doubtless revive old memories with grati- tude; they will certainly appreciate his lively and original evaluations, not least of Sappho. Giovanni Capovilla's second volume' completes his magnum opus on Callimachus, a far-ranging inquiry which takes full advantage of the new papyri and makes a new assessment, inter alia, of the copaiiou viKol, of C.'s style, diction, and sources, of his critical judgements. Although no bibliography is included, the book is well documented with copious references to all the latest literature on the subject. D. J. Conacher's analysis of Euripidean drama2 has much to commend it to general reader and scholar alike. He combats the prevalent condemnation of 'Euripides the destroyer', although he admits the 'violent displacement of normal tragic structure' and certain 'structural eccentricities' which led to that condemnation. Euripides, he contends, approached myth in various ways: on the one hand, he 'devoted a certain measure of his dramatic energy to the ridicule of and satire on literal belief in the tradi- tional gods of myth and in the incredible "horrid tales made up by poets" about them' (doti8~0v OTWe Gc-rrlvol 6yo); on the other hand, he takes myth seriously in some ways (Hippolytos and Bacchae) and introduces anthropomorphic gods 'to symbolize certain real forces'; again, some plays (e.g. Hleracles and Troades) are tragic in their effect while involving 'a negative or sceptical attitude to the gods'. Conacher divides his plays, therefore (with the exception of Rhesus-he remains unconvinced of its authen- ticity), into seven groups: mythological; political (Suppliants and Heracleidae); plays of war or its aftermath, where he is interested in human relations only (e.g. Andromache); realistic (Medea, Electra, Orestes); tragddie manquee (Phoenissae, Iphigeneia at Aulis); romantic (e.g. Ion); and Satyric, in which group he places Alcestis. Each play is ana- lysed separately and at some length, with footnotes which deal with questions of a technical nature or with the theories of other, scholars. The main text can be read without any knowledge of Greek; thus students of English drama can use the book with profit. It remains to add this: Kitto's 'tragic victims' are in Conacher's analysis sub-divided into (a) those who because of their character or will do in some sense bring the catastrophe on themselves, and (b) those on whom suffering is inflicted by some 'agency completely external'-an important advance. B*The Two Muses3 (Mel- pomene and Thalia) devotes a third of its space to a good summary of the background, historical, social, and philosophical, of fifth-century Athens; a chapter on the Athenian Theatre completes this section. Thereafter two plays are reproduced (in English) with introduction, some stage directions, and helpful parentheses-Clouds and, rather sur- prisingly, Medea. Brief addenda follow both plays: comments by Norwood and Murray on Comedy; essays by Norwood, Murray, and Kitto on Tragedy. This is an interesting book, finely illustrated by some new photographs of stage productions in Greece and at Bradfield, and by other better-known representations of vase paintings and Greek theatres. The new edition of NEqAial4 will be most welcome. Dover's intro- duction is a long one: not only are the usual problems discussed in detail (the two ver- sions, for example, and the history of the text), but Strepsiades and his family, as well as Socrates, are allotted several pages each. The prejudices of 6 8Koalos Ab6yos, too, are portrayed in a novel and somewhat unexpected light (pp. lxiv-v). The apparatus I **Callimaco II. 'L'Erma' di Bretschneider, Rome, 1968. Pp. 579.

'I recognize one "principle" of textual criticism, and one only', he writes, 'to take into account, so far as is humanly possible, everything that is relevant, recognizing that what the MSS actually say in a given passage is never more than a portion of the evidence relevant to that passage and that the decisive evidence may appear from any quarter and from any distance.' The notes are generous. Dover has a lively appreciation of the difficulties undergraduates are likely to encounter; he has, moreover, a sensible, open attitude to Aristophanic jests which in the old days were passed over in silence or with an embarrassed smirk. Three new books have appeared on the TiEpi rfolIlTIKlS. L. J. Potts's translation' was first published fifteen years ago; the first paperback edition has now been issued. His introduction is brief but diverting, concerned largely with the influence of the Poetics on English literature from Chaucer onwards. The commentary is designedly constricted; the notes are meagre; nevertheless the intelli- gent reader will undoubtedly find this version satisfying and clear. Two American dons, Leon Golden and O. B. Hardison, have also produced a version,2 but with ex- tensive notes, diagrams, and explanations; their guiding principles are 'accuracy and readability' and in the main they achieve that aim. It is regrettable that they follow the growing modern practice of quoting Greek in Roman characters: thus we have the barbarous diphron moxtheron (sic) katatheis mikran te trapezan. How much more fitting to translate 'setting a kitchen stool and little table' (as Potts did), emphasizing the sub- stitution of 'kitchen' and 'little' for 'menial' and 'lowly'. However, the American edition has many virtues, not least the thorough expression of Else's views (with which the authors do not always agree). The work of D. W. Lucas3 accommodates the English scholars (many of whom today, alas, have not even a nodding acquaintance with the Greek tongue) and in the Introduction and Appendixes (on Mimesis; Pity, Fear, and Katharsis; simple and complex tragedy; Hamartia) the Greek is relegated to footnotes. The commentary is good and the text, with its apparatus criticus, admirably clear. Literature: Latin Volumes III and IV, dealing with Books v-x, complete *Cicero's Letters to Atticus,4 apart from an Index still to come. They follow the schema of their predecessors: the O.T. (W. S. Watt's 1965 edition for Bks. v-viii, Shackleton Bailey's own 1961 text thereafter) appears on the left, the spirited and highly skilful translation on the right; the apparatus criticus, a full and most valuable commentary, maps, and various appen- dixes, together with nominum, verborum, rerum indices. Towards the end of the period covered here (5 1-49), the correspondence in unusually fertile and of course particularly useful fo the historian; to help him S. B. has attempted a reconstruction of Cicero's movements from 18 January to 19 May 49--the day on which Tullia gave birth to the puerum kw-rap~vialov. .. perimbecillum, his grandson (Ephemeris, appendix i). The classical world has every reason to be grateful, for not only are the volumes eminently readable and instructive, but the Cambridge University Press has seen to it that in format and clarity they are beyond reproach. To render Ovid efficiently into English is no easy matter; the Amores, above all, abound in problems, however smoothly the translator's verses run.

But this, he says (rightly enough), is 'flat and longwinded'. How much more effec- tive is I'll be your slave for life, your ever faithful lover. Lee's version,' opposite the Latin text, is witty and graceful-a model of the direct, idiomatic style that ever delights the heart of T. W. Melluish. Take, for example, his A silvery soprano tempts me to steal a coloratura kiss. (II. iv. 25-6) The notes are textual and explanatory, but hardly adequate; the Life of Ovid too concise. The pleasure lies in the verse itself, free and varied. Clarence W. Men- dell, Professor Emeritus of Latin at Yale, whose work is already familiar to English readers, has published two books recently: Our Seneca2 appeared for the first time in 1941 and is now reprinted; Latin Poetry: The Age of Rhetoric and Satire3 is new, less praiseworthy but still a volume of note and worth. The former provides a conspectus of Seneca's debt to the Greeks and the use he made of it. Comparing Sophocles' O. T. with the Oedipus of Seneca, Mendell remarks on the economical, logical, relentless development of the one, the hair-raising melodrama of the other. 'No great creative literature like the Greek drama could have originated in the Age of Nero,' he writes. 'There was no great communal interest left, no spontaneous support. There was no longer any cohesion in the potential audience. Each man was on the make for him- self and none had time for ideas or incentive for developing them.' Scrutiny of the respective Greek and Roman use of the Prologue; of dramatic technique (Seneca's disdain for illusion, e.g., and his 'failure to motivate entrances and exits or properly to introduce characters'); of the long, debating speech, the device of the deus ex machina, the stichomythia which in the Greek serves to advance plot, but in Seneca is more commonly 'display of rhetorical fireworks'-all these convince Mendell that the Roman's tragedies were not intended for the stage. This would be accepted today, but modern critics are more inclined than M. is to allow something more than mere rant and fury to Seneca; some even admire his rhetoric and see in it a consistent philosophy. To prove his own thesis, Mendell adds his translation of the Oedipus Tyrannus and its Senecan counterpart, so that the reader may judge for himself. Latin Poetry is a prolegomenon for the non-classicist. The author quotes considerable excerpts (in English) from Phaedrus, Manilius, Persius, Statius, Valerius Flaccus, Silius Italicus, and the better known Lucan, Seneca, Juvenal, and Martial. A readable account of each poet's life and work provides background and Juvenal's third and tenth satire are translated, for good measure, in full. It is well done and should stimulate inquiry; certainly it will be a boon to English students. But why no mention of Petronius ? Most English works on him (Petronius) have been concerned with philological matters, or with the history and text of the Satyricon. J. P. Sullivan's literary study4 is consequently rather unconventional; it is also a scholar's book, but (because nearly all the Latin is translated) within the grasp of the general reader. Whether one regards the Satyricon as 'one of the most licentious and repulsive works in Roman literature' (Lecky-but he did not live to read the modern pornography), or as 'un romanzo che no si pu6 leggere senza nausea' (Civitelli), or as a parody of the Odyssey (Klebs), or with Highet as 'an implicit criticism, social, aesthetic and moral, of the life around him', or as an Epicurean tract, or as a picaresque novel-none of these types fully describes it.

It was a work of art, not a satire (for true satire presupposes an ethical standpoint, a quasi-moral principle, and Petronius could hardly be accused of being a satirist in the Horatian or even Byronic tradition). Sullivan tries to reconstitute the missing parts of the work-a not entirely unrewarding exercise-and minutely examines the extant fragments for traces of parody, humour, and satire; the sexual themes natu- rally claim attention, but S. contends that, far from being avant-garde, they were only traditional-novae simplicitatis opus, 'quod populus facit'. Consideration of Petronian obscenity leads him to psychoanalyse the author himself-at least one might deduce something of value. In fact he sees evidence enough to link our Petronius with the Tacitean T. Petronius Niger, cos. suff. c. A.D. 62. Htistory The strong, vigorous prose style of Jacquetta Hawkes always pleases, and although B*Dawn of the Gods' is unlikely to supersede the latest volumes on Crete and Mycenae it will certainly be popular. The book is notable for its first-class illustrations (Miss Hawkes is a firm believer in 'looking' as well as 'reading'); for them she is chiefly indebted to the Greek photographer, Dimitrios Harissiadis. Her narrative covers the Minoan-Mycenaean period, with a quick glance at what preceded it and a longer gaze at the Greek revival which followed the Dark Ages-a term 'no longer used as freely' as in the past. 'It seems to me', she writes, 'that the degree of continuity between Mycen- aean and Classical Greece, and the importance of the Bronze Age heritage, have even now never been stated with sufficient force. There has also been the counter-attack by the minority of scholars who have used their interpretation of the tablets to build up a picture of an Oriental-style palace bureaucracy, and in this way to create a gulf between the Mycenaean Age and Homer.' Her own theme, that the marriage of the essentially 'feminine' society of Crete (she perhaps over-stresses the matriarchal aspect here) with 'masculine' Mycenae produced something powerful enough to survive the so-called Dark Ages, is not altogether convincing, but it is an attractive idea. She quotes the case of the Cerne Abbas Giant and the White Horse of Uffington, pre-Roman Celtic symbols which have persisted to modern times through the English Dark Age. Another work on the same period is William A. McDonald's B*Progress into the Past,2 an American publication. He begins, 'In a very real sense all scholarship is motivated by curiosity and an urge to investigate mysteries. So this is going to be a kind of detective story, a historical whodunit.' Let no one be deterred by this modest prooemium: this is a fine book, well written and well constructed. McDonald's ap- proach is biographical; the outstanding figures in the drama are Schliemann, Evans, Band legen; others, like Tsountas, D6rpfeld, Wace, and Ventris, play subordinate but important parts. (All these gentlemen, incidentally, are honoured with photographs in the text; all other illustrations are line-drawings.) McDonald's approach is also his- torical: that is to say, the discoveries and their interpretations are recorded as they happened, often through the eyes of Schliemann, Evans, and Blegen, and in their own words; their mistakes and hypotheses are presented, the reader being in the position, so to speak, of an onlooker in 1890, say, or 1920, or 1965. He 'participates' in the slow accumulation of evidence over three generations; sees one theory discarded, another take its place, a third in process of being debated; in the final sixty pages he has set before him some current theories and problems (e.g. the dating of the Knossos tablets). This method does entail some repetition and occasional recapitulation of theories aban- doned or modified, but the reasons for present-day evaluations become clearer. Four points remain to be added here: McDonald has drastically reduced biographical details which are 'extra-professional'-one must not look for a 'Life' of Schliemann in these Chatto &amp; Windus, 1968.

Our German, French, and Italian friends, not to mention the Greeks, may feel that they have been neglected in this respect, but lack of space compelled the line to be drawn somewhere. BThe Aegean Civilization' was originally published in this country in I925; Gustave Glotz, its author, was acclaimed with almost embarrassing compliments. He had divided his survey (after a general introduction) into four parts, dealing respectively with material, social, religious, and artistic and intellectual life. The last-named contained his com- ments on writing and language in the Minoan-Mycenaean world, now of course quite outdated. The bibliography, limited to pre-1925 works, is also outdated; and the illustrations (pen-and-ink drawings supplemented by some not very impressive photo- graphs) would hardly satisfy modern readers. It would seem that a reprint, without an editor's notes and a revised book-list, was bound to fail. Yet I think that would be a false notion: Glotz was a historian of considerable reputation, supremely capable of 'making the dry bones live'; he still has something of worth to say. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson have published Sabatino Moscati's work on the Phoeniciansz in the History of Civilization Series (under the general editorship of Sir Ronald Syme). The author deals separately with the Phoenicians in the Syro-Palestinian coastal area and the Phoenicians and Carthaginians in Africa, under five main headings: history, religion, art, economy and trade, script and language. The colonies in the west (Malta, Gozo, Pantelleria, Sicily, Sardinia, Spain) are the subject of a third section of some fifty pages. Moscati's synthesis, illustrated with plates of exceptional quality, with maps, drawings, and diagrams, covers a period of roughly a thousand years, from c. I200 B.C. to the fall of Carthage. In the east the evidence is surprisingly meagre; in the west there is an astonishing wealth of material; it might have been tempting to concentrate rather on the Punic element, but Moscati resisted this-the similarities and differences in the two cultures are fairly examined. Only in one respect will the reader be disappointed: Alastair Hamilton's translation from the Italian, otherwise so efficient, falters in the brief passages on Language: 'in late Punic we note oscillations within the sibilant and liquid-nasal series, as well as emphatics and non-emphatics. . .' requires some explana- tion; the advice of an English comparative philologist might have been sought. A list of modern works and up-to-date articles in learned journals (with some annotation) completes this survey, an excellent addendum to the volumes of Picard, Warmington, and Harden. BThe Ancient World: Manners and Morals' comes from the tireless pen of Jack Lindsay. As one would expect, it is readable, always interesting, and em- bellished with good and often unusual plates. Lindsay begins with Minoans and My- keneans (sic-he believes in adhering to the Greek); he ends almost predictably with the unfortunate Theodora, consort of Justinian. As I see it, he has committed two errors: (a) there are numerous apt quotations, sometimes involving long excerpts, but these are inserted without proper reference to chapter and verse; hence the reader is often frustrated; for example, the description of a pagan initiation-ceremony is ascribed to the Byzantine Michael Psellus, 'drawing on unknown sources'; Psellus was a prolific author, but the passage quoted is absolutely uncharacteristic and one would like to know Lindsay's warrant; (b) morals are in this volume too readily equated with sexual customs and taboos; we would like to hear more about other misdemeanours: what happened to embezzlers, forgers, arsonists, and so on (there is no lack of evidence). It seems paradoxical that while our author will translate without a blush, even with ob- vious relish, the most intimate revelations of sexual behaviour, in his fairly compre- hensive bibliography he omits to mention the researches of Jean Marcade--or is that dynamite?

Here, however, the references are given in full, there are adequate notes, and the bibliography is more extensive; the illustrations, moreover, are line-drawings in accordance with Lindsay's normal practice. By making good use of papyri and inscrip- tions he reconstructs the customs, religious and secular, of the people. There are no dull pages. We are rapidly approaching a point where almost every statement on the Greeks will be challenged. 'Writing today on even comparatively well-known periods of ancient history is like entering a jungle-a jungle of ancient traditions and modern conjectures, with very few undisputed facts. We have long ago lost the beauti- ful innocence of those whose love for Greece was combined with an unperturbed belief in the truth of at least the chief traditions of the Greeks themselves.' So writes Ehrenberg in the Preface to his new book.' Because he thinks that Greek history (in this case of the sixth and fifth centuries) should not be left to the polemics of 'so-called experts', he gives a fair and balanced summary of the main problems in the notes, with copious guidance on further reading; this is in fact the great achievement of the work. The narrative itself is straightforward, an attempt 'to show the multifarious picture of Greek life at any given moment'; those who have read Ehrenberg's previous studies will not need to be reminded how well he can interpret the moods and feelings of the ancient world. Robert Connor, a Princeton don, is also conscious of 'fallible men working on broken and distorted material'; he quotes Walker's epigram: 'A writer of whom hardly anything is known is a writer of whom almost anything may be assumed.' The subject of his monograph2 is Theopompus, whose extant history is limited to a few score of fragments 'partisan, tendentious, and often malicious ... and coloured by moral and political prejudices'. Yet, despite the rancour and harshness of Theopompus, von Wilamowitz entertained a high opinion of his worth-no mean commendation; it is surprising, too, for T.'s propensity for 'slurring the paternity' of the famous, for denying their accomplishments or 'ascribing them to base motives', led Lucian to ob- serve that 'he was a prosecutor', not a historian. Connor examines and translates fifteen fragments from the tenth and twenty-fifth books of the Philippica: an excursus on Athenian domestic politics which has acquired a title of its own, On the Demagogues, and another on Marathon, Plataea, and other matters of Athenian foreign policy. The results of his research are bound to be somewhat tentative, but the basis has been laid for a fresh and longer inquiry. He also contributes a working Index (pp. 187-3o6) of Theopompus' vocabulary which should be really helpful in the future. In his *Freedom in Greek Life and Thought3 Max Pohlenz is at his best when dealing with the ,EvOEpia of the Hellenistic and Christian eras: the word meant different things to Diogenes, Epicurus, Zeno, Socrates, but the Christian ideal was sui generis, something utterly foreign to the pagan Greek-and Pohlenz brings this out clearly in his final pages. He is good on the Classical Age, too, though I think he is more than kind to Pericles and some of his judgements are too sweeping: 'None of the Athenians was illiterate'; 'By far the largest items in the state budget under Pericles were the cost of the monumental buildings on the Acropolis, of sculpture and painting, the gymnasia, baths, religious festivals and institutions of general utility'-a formidable list, but no mention of military expenditure; 'The Athenians in Aeschylus' time knew nothing about the problem of free will'; the antithesis between body and soul, we are told, was formulated for the first time in the West by the Orphic and Pythagorean thinkers, a statement which comes strangely from Pohlenz, for he is familiar with his Old Testa- ment. He is not invariably well served by the translator: there are frequent references to the Greek nation and there is mention of the provinces (i.e. colonies). On the whole, however, this is a most valuable and interesting prolegomenon. Johan Henrik Schreiner's Study in Historiography4 explores the Ath. Pol. for clues to Aristotle's final I *From.

The inquiry is pretty thorough, but the conclusion proves to be indeter- minate: in general, it appears, Aristotle was a bit of a snob and could not bring himself to condemn one so highborn as the son of Xanthippus and Agariste. A fourth volume' in the Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Universal History Series was published in the autumn of 1968. Pierre Grimal was responsible for most of the text, but other scholars undertook the task of writing the significant fourth chapter, on Egypt, Syria, Palestinian Judaism, Mesopotamia, and Arabia-eastern countries on the periphery of the Hellenic world. They were, in that order, Philippe Derchain, Hermann Bengtson, Morton Smith, Maurice Meuleau, and Werner Caskel, representing the best of Franco-German- American erudition in that field. Much of the volume must inevitably be devoted to the political struggles and wars, but literature, art, and religion are by no means passed over; the plates, too, have been wisely selected to illustrate these activities. The book is annotated and a bibliography is provided (pp. 396-405); it is likely, however, that the latter will assist French or German readers for the most part-English publications are rarely included. A. R. Hands's monographz will be received with gratitude by everyone. Under the heading of charity (a difficult word to define, with legal im- plications more diverse and extensive than the layman would suppose) and social aid or philanthropy, three main subjects are considered: the provision of foodstuffs, of education, and of medical care (the advancement of religion is involved to some degree in all these categories). It is easy to point to the alimenta, the tesserae, the congiaria, and so on of the Roman world; similarly in Greece the epidosis, the theorikon, the diobelia immediately spring to mind-but how far did the pagans advance beyond the do ut des principle ? When we are told that 'the poor' benefited, what was the real meaning of ol 1TrvrrTE ? Certainly they are not to be identified with rrcorxoi. It is notable that Dio- dorus, alone of classical writers, 'describes with human sympathy the lot of the miners' (whose conditions were worst of all). 'To give to a beggar is to do him an ill service', says Plautus; 'give to the good', says Theognis; 'to those who are worthy', says Cicero; 'to the most deserving', says Seneca. Aristotle went further: 'To help the poor with distributions of money ... is to fill a leaky jar.' As certain provisions were undoubtedly made for the less fortunate, what was it, apart from the claims of Zeus Xenios, the terrors of the &amp;pal BouVuyEiat, blatant self-interest, and the desire for posthumous fame, what was it that impelled the rich to endow charities and pay the public physicians? Some answer may be found in the eighty-one documents translated into English and thoughtfully included in the book (pp. 174-209). If one cared to express in one sentence the enormous gulf that divided pagan and Christian ideas of 'giving', it would be this: There was no counterpart of the Byzantine fn-rxorpoq(Eiov in pre-Christian Athens or Rome. B**Greek Oared Ships, 900-322 B.C.,3 the work of J. S. Morrison and R. T. Williams, is scholarly and comprehensive: the literary and archaeological evidence is here reproduced in toto. Ship's gear, the handling of ships, shipbuilding, the ship- sheds (this section was written by J. D. Blackman of Bristol University), tactics, crew, types of vessel-everything that could contribute to the understanding of sea-power, including the description of battles-all these are carefully discussed and where pos- sible depicted in the very fine plates. The book follows a chronological pattern: first the Homeric period, then the Archaic (7oo-480), last the Classical; in each case the whole evidence, from texts or inscriptions, is given in the original language (there are a few passages in Latin). It is regrettable that no translations were added, but at least classical scholars will have an incomparable &amp;poppci for further research. To compose a history of scholarship is never easy and rarely attempted. Rudolf Pfeiffer thinks that 'only one who has practised scholarship all his life should dare to write' such a book: the historian must have become old 'to develop his art to the full'.

Very long experience can make a man too cautious: witness, the 'if' in that surprising sentence (p. 21): 'If Michael Ventris's ingenious theory of the decipherment of this syllabic script [Linear B] is correct ... '. Pfeiffer presumably wrote those words some years after the publication of Chadwick's book. He can be disarmingly modest, too: writing of 'the oriental background' in an early chapter, he remarks; 'While aware of this historical process, I am, naturally enough, rather reluctant to speak of it as I have not the slightest acquaintance with the languages concerned; so I am forced to rely on the reports and interpretations of specialists and to draw conclusions from them with due reserve.' A lifetime devoted to the pursuit of scholarship, circumspection, humility-these are no bad qualifications for a task which covers some three centuries and marks a turning- point in Greek history. The obsolete and trivial are omitted; there are only essential biographical data; the emphasis is at all times on the permanent, the judgement which is of lasting value. The Greeks themselves had an innate scepticism where the written word was concerned; they never allowed themselves to become book-ridden; and this made of them excellent critics. The vast number of them and the wide range of their researches can be ascertained in the text and excursuses of this volume,' which in lesser hands might easily have degenerated into a mere catalogue, but in fact is both readable and lucid and inspiring. In the whole of human history there have not been many events which can be truly called decisive, moments which transformed and redirected the course of things; the burning of Persepolis and what immediately followed it was one such crisis. Sir Mortimer Wheeler, soldier-scholar-archaeologist, tells the story2 with characteristic zeal and vigour. As to the question whether the firing of the palace was deliberate policy or the result of a drunken revel in which Thais and the flute-girls played a prominent role, Tarn chooses the former; Sir Mortimer will not reject the latter answer-and gives good reasons for it. Sir William Tarn, 'in his twentieth- century Scottish retreat, had had no great experience of campaigning at the age of twenty-six far from home, amidst the outlands of an alien continent in the fourth century B.C.' Of course, nobody else can today claim personal knowledge of fourth-century morals and circumstances, but Sir Mortimer has made his point: Tarn's judgement of Alexander was at times distorted 'by the instincts of an English gentleman'. The second part of the book, dealing with the aftermath, discloses new evidence and ex- citing prospects of a most dramatic type: the excavations at Ai Khanum, Begram, Taxila, Charsada, and other sites have proved fertile beyond expectations and new evaluations can be made, about Gandhara art, for example, and the influence of Rome. The volume is illustrated with photographs of fine quality; like the narrative, they impress and convince. *A History of Rome through the Fifth Century,3 despite its ambiguous, Americanized title, is the compilation of a British scholar. In fact, this is the first volume of a work which will extend from the origins to the downfall of the Western Empire. In it are collected translated passages from Roman and Greek authors, as well as inscriptions, with brief introductions; many are adapted from eighteenth- and nineteenth-century versions, some (including all the epigraphical evidence) are the work of Jones himself. Above all they are designed to exemplify the arts of law and government. Commendable though it is, the volume as a whole can in no respect rival Roman Civilization, the selected readings of Naphtali Lewis and Meyer Reinhold, which was published in America seventeen years ago and is omitted from Jones's bibliography. B*Herculaneum* gives a good account of the present state of the town and a lively summary of past excavations. The illustrations are most praiseworthy, the narrative I **History of Classical Scholarship. From the Beginnings to the End of the Hel- lenistic Age. Oxford U.P., 1968.

In the latrine ... ?' (Why should the unfortunate man merit the 'jolly' ?); 'more Greek greats turned up' (referring to wall frescoes). However, these are minor flaws; the historians and the sociologists will be pleased to have this book on their shelves. Unless there is an access of new material-most probably from Egypt-we shall never know who wrote the Historia Augusta; we cannot even be sure that one man was the author. Sir Ronald Syme (loyal to the thesis of Hermann Dessau, 'a scholar of pronounced sobriety, averse from speculation and addicted to facts'), believes there was in fact one editor. In his ab- sorbing inquiry,' by a series of convergent arguments and by an adroit use of Ammia- nus Marcellinus and other writers, including Jerome, he narrows the likely candidates to a literary personality, ' clever, but sly and silly, cynical and irresponsible; a rogue grammaticus alert for oddities of fact or language; a fancier of clothing and decoration, an art connoisseur in a small way; a fancier also of all curiosa, including the religious, but devoid of strong inner beliefs; and, above all, a collector with an untidy mind. His limitations help to reveal him.' He wrote in or about the year 395, not for propaganda but for 'the pleasure he takes in deception': the HA is a gigantic hoax-an extraordinary display of misapplied energy ... KorGIv &amp;vep6brrov 8EV6TEpov TrrE1. . .. No doubt this will not be the end of the matter. As Syme remarks (in the turgid and irritating style he sometimes affects) 'Assiduous frequentation of the HA engenders deplorable habits. All too often scepticism goes hand in hand with ingenious explanations.' Nevertheless, this is a masterly exposition and a prosopographer's paradise. Edward Gibbon was not alone in his belief that the rot set in when Marcus Aurelius died; some Romans themselves felt a change. Not without cause, for the next two hundred years brought economic disaster and political chaos; the masses cannot have been very happy. Prima facie Michael Grant had little justification for his choice of title-Climax hardly seems the appropriate word.2 Yet he makes out a reasonable case: there was remarkable progress in architecture and the arts (in portrait sculpture, for example-witness the famous bust of the Thracian Maximinus: there is no Augustan serenity here, but in the careworn, strong face an overwhelming impression of grim determination; there is also sympathy and understanding, with maybe a fleeting glimpse of sardonic humour). Masterpieces appeared in the so-called minor arts: in bas-reliefs, mosaics, coins, intaglios, portrait-painting. The novel developed and philosophers, especially the great Plotinus, flourished; there were military triumphs and an advance in jurisprudence. More important than anything else was the spread of Christianity and its eventual acceptance as the state religion. There is a further point: in some of its more unhealthy manifestations the age bore an amazing resemblance to our own; if for no other reason Grant's fine survey deserves to be widely studied. The plates, as in all his books, have been selected with care and are of the highest quality. We have received Friedrich Heer's BThe Holy Roman Empire,3 much of which is, of course, outside our sphere, though one is constantly reminded of the classical heritage. There is some mystic German nonsense: 'Five thousand years measure the flight path of the imperial eagle, as he makes his way from the temple towers of Eridu towards the setting sun, towards the evening mists veiling the future of the atomic age.' Assurbanipal, Alexander, Augustus, Charles V, Francis Joseph-how surprised they would have been in each other's company!

Yet in this act of faith Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul have displayed sound judge- ment.' De Ridder, Curator at the Louvre Museum, was an able and promising scholar, but he died young, after finishing only three chapters of the book; it was completed by Deonna, archaeologist and historian, a Professor at the University of Geneva. To- gether they produced a fine interpretation of the place of Art and Artist in the Greek world, down to the end of the Hellenistic Era. The continuity of style, the absence of 'disconcerting shock in evolution' (rEXvav E86TrEs K rporIpcov) are emphasized: unlike the modern artist, 'considering himself to be a superior being' who takes pride in 'this rupture with the public which he even maintains as necessary', the Greek developed steadily, always in harmony with the society of the time. That at least is the contention of the authors and no doubt it will not be accepted everywhere. The techniques of the ancient craftsmen are discussed at length (pose, anatomy, drapery, symmetria, perspec- tive, chiaroscuro, composition) as well as the influence of the 'Greek ideal', both in its heyday and in later centuries. If de Ridder and Deonna are more reverent, less sceptical than modern critics, their observations are acute and worthy of full examination. The twenties, when they wrote, had not yet become entirely disillusioned: a philologist (Vendryes) could still describe the Greek tongue as a language 'whose very essence is godlike ... The outward form ... is in itself a delight to the soul. The harmony of its rhythm, the grace of its sounds, and the richness of its vocabulary even, are not the most precious of its qualities. In the grammatical field, Greek is distinguished above all other languages by the precision of its morphemes which renders the word-formation so lucid, and the graceful suppleness of its syntax which gives to every thought its full value, following its every movement and reflecting each fine shade in its transparent depths. Never has a more beautiful instrument been fashioned to express human thought.' What reaction would Vendryes provoke today? Gisela Richter's BKorai: Archaic Greek Maidens2 is a companion volume to her Kouroi, published in I960: it covers the same period, c. 650 B.C. to 'the cataclysm of the Persian wars, which marks a turning point', and it is noteworthy for the same meticulous scholarship, with exact descriptions of each plate (measurements, provenance, chronology, bibliography). The evolution of the Kore type, from the early examples to 'more or less naturalistic' forms, is, it must be admitted, more interesting and varied than that of the Kouroi: to begin with, there is the unsolved problem of their meaning; then there is the infinite variety of their garments, with their polychrome decorations; the hair-styles, jewellery, pins and buttons, footwear, not to mention the gradual revelation of the figure beneath skilfully moulded drapery. The plates, illustrating the six groups into which Dr. Richter has divided her Korai, are magnificent; the majority of them are the work of Alison Frantz, who has usually provided more than one view. The whole opus (Kouroi and Korai) constitutes a most valuable record for students of Greek Art and Society. The importance of engraved gems (used as seals or amulets, or even for orna- ment) hardly needs stressing. Yet they have been somewhat neglected since Furtwling- ler's Antike Gemmen appeared in I9oo; few scholars were able to devote the years of laborious research which they demand-for 'it is only through constant practice that the eye gradually acquires the ability to arrive at sound judgments'. Miss Richter's superb volume,3 therefore, will be especially welcome: it 'presents a history of Greek art in miniature' and it illuminates in no uncertain manner the beauty and interest of the stones. In order to demonstrate more clearly these qualities, most of them are shown in their actual size, the impression made by the intaglio is then placed beside I BArt in Greece. Published in 1968.

Before she embarks on the actual description of the gems (and here she' follows the system already adopted in her previous works), the author gives some information on technique and materials, on known engravers and their signatures, on collecting, on forgeries (not easy to detect), and on the properties shared with coins. For the sake of convenience the examples which appear in the plates are arranged in chronological sequence, from the Geometric to the end of the Hellenistic period; the Etruscan gems are dealt with under four headings (from the early archaic period, seventh and sixth centuries, to the Late period of the fourth to third; thereafter they are classified according to subjects portrayed: deities, daemons, centaurs, satyrs, and so on). A second volume, on Roman gems, is projected. John Boardman's Archaic Greek Gems' is of smaller scope, being limited to the schools and artists of the sixth and early fifth centuries B.C., a period which saw the inception of a new series. The scarab or scaraboid shape was adopted, both Phoenician in origin, and harder materials were used, mainly of the chalcedony family, necessitating different techniques. His attempts to define the work of indivi- dual artists, or at any rate of certain schools, has been worth while, but the difficulties are formidable in the extreme. Nevertheless, a start has been made and doubtless with more finds and the publication of Papadimitriou's Brauron excavations (1961) progress will be more rapid. Boardman's illustrations are excellent and the book is well anno- tated, but the description of the plates, obviously for some good reason, is rather concise. It seems that Richter and Boardman published their works independently; the former mentions the 'forthcoming' Archaic Greek Gems, but Boardman omits any reference to her Engraved Gems. Both, however, agree that Furtwlingler inspired them. I Schools and Artists in the Sixth and Early Fifth Centuries B.c. Thames and Hud- son, I968. Pp. 236, with 387 illustrations (15 in colour).
