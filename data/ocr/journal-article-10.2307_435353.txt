<plain_text><page sequence="1">VICTORIAN BIBLIOGRAPHY FOR 1955 Edited by AUSTIN WRIGHT T HIS bibliography has been pre- pared by a committee of the Vic- torian Literature Group of the Modern Language Association of America: Austin Wright, chairman, Carnegie Insti- tute of Technology; William D. Temple- man, University of Southern California; Francis G. Townsend, Ohio State Univer- sity; Robert C. Slack, Yale University (Visiting); and Oscar Maurer, University of Texas. It attempts to list the note- worthy publications of 1955 (including reviews of these and earlier items) that have a bearing on English literature of the Victorian period, and similar publications of earlier date that have been inadvertent- ly omitted from the preceding Victorian bibliography. Unless otherwise stated, the date of publication is 1955. Reference to a page in the bibliography for 1954, in Modern Philology, May, 1955, is made by the following form: See VB 1954, 260. Some cross-references are given, though not all that are possible. For certain con- tinuing bibliographical works the reader should consult VB 1941, the last annual bibliography in which such works are listed in full.

JPE, LXIII, 461-88. This major article documents the inextricable connection between belief in the beauty of a providentially ordered nature and belief in a providential order in human affairs which laws can only hinder. The principal writers who pro- mulgated the laissez faire doctrine among the bourgeois intellectuals of the 1840's and 1850's were James Wilson and Thomas Hodgskin.-- F. G. T. Guest, Ivor.

"Reform of the Borough Police, 1835-1856." EHR, LXIX, 411-27. The traditional view has been that the metro- politan police forced an exodus of criminals from London to the towns, which led to an improve- ment of the borough police in 1835, which in turn caused an exodus of criminals to the rural areas, which led to legislation to improve the county police in 1839. Actually, the borough police forces were organized slowly and somewhat in- efficiently. The true cause for the bill to improve the rural police, introduced July 24, 1839, was Chartist agitation.-F.

Nor are modern books, such as those by the Hansons, Lord Elton, and Charles Beatty, much of an im- provement. They are more sophisticated, but they are guilty of the same error, namely, an abysmal ignorance of Egypt and the Sudan.

"The British Timber Duties, 1815- 60." Economica, new ser., XXII, 122-36. At one time the import duty on Baltic timber was so high that ships actually carried it to Canada so it could be called Canadian timber and then brought it back across the Atlantic to Great Britain for well under the cost of a direct ship- ment from the Baltic plus the duty. The result was an artificially high price which encouraged the use of iron. At the same time, ships in the Canadian timber trade, which made the western trip almost empty, carried emigrants to North America for as little as 25s. in the 1830's. R.

Sanders, Charles Richard. "Carlyle's Letters." Bull. John Rylands Libr., XXXVIII, 199- 224. Valuable and fascinating account of work done and being done on Carlyle correspondence, es- pecially at Duke University. Work at Duke on a file of Carlyle's letters was begun in 1952 and, though not completed, shows "significant data." In the master file (5,687 letters are now noted) is a card for each letter of which any trace has been found. Unpublished letters total 3,053. Of the 2,634 letters recorded in print, 805 are in Dyer's list of scattered letters; many of the re- mainder have been incompletely printed. The guess is made that eventually at least 8,000 auto- graph letters will be found. Professor Sanders gives many statistics of interest and numerous valuable interpretive comments on the style, contents, and varying significance of Carlyle's correspondence. He contends that the letters re- veal accurately not only Carlyle but also the events of the time, with comments and pen- portraits. Sanders mentions many Victorians, among them Forster, Browning, Tennyson, Lan- dor, Froude, Dickens, Mill, Macaulay, Milnes, Hunt, Sterling, Macready.

Having failed to reform the Royal Literary Fund, which actually needed no reform, Dickens decided to ruin it, but failed.

Mannheim, Leonard F. "The Law as 'Fa- ther.' " Amer. Imago, XII, 17-23. The objects of filial acceptance and Oedipal re- gression are the good John Jarndyce and the evil Krook, both connected with the law. You see, the Father is disguised as the Law, and then the Law is symbolized in the human figure--the anthropomorphic viewpoint, of course. Jarndyce lives in Bleak House, but Bleak House is really not a bad house at all-in fact, it is like the Father's house in which there are many mansions. -F. G. T. Miller, J. Hillis.

After his nervous breakdown in the 1840's, Dobell wrote The Roman, a dramatic poem cele- brating revolt and liberty. Most interesting is Thale's equating of father with Austrian ag- gression and mother with oppressed Italy, an equation which suggests why more Victorians than just Dobell were so emotional about 1848. In the case of Dobell, I think Thale's evidence and the arguments he bases on it are conclusive. -F. G. T. Domnett. Horsman, E. A. (ed.). The Diary of Alfred Domett, 1872-1885. .. . See VB 1954, 249.

A criticism of Hawthorne's novel appeared in the Westminster Review in October, 1852. It is here attributed, with reason, to Marian Evans; throws interesting light on the early develop- ment of her thought concerning the art of fiction. She contends that realism per se is not enough, that Hawthorne treats Zenobia too harshly, and that he had not sufficiently shown the moral ef- fect of Brook Farm upon his characters. Rust suggests interestingly that George Eliot may have shown (by the impact of society upon the individual) in Middlemarch what she wished Hawthorne had done in The Blithedale Romance. -W. D. T.

Melville is known to have borrowed Jerrold's The Mutiny at the Nore from the New York Society Library while he was working on Billy Budd. Jerrold's Black-eyed Susan was one of the most popular plays in nineteenth-century New York. Marryat was one of the best-known writers of sea stories, and his novel, The King's Own, was acknowledged as a source for Jerrold's The Mutiny at the Nore. All three of these Victorian works contain scenes in which a man unjustly condemned praises the force which condemns him. Scott, Kenneth W. "Monsieur Violet." TLS, Oct. 1, 1954, p. 632.

Mill as the fairest of economists, but he is usually dismissed by economists as a literary figure, deficient in originality. Stigler singles out six important ideas contributed to economics by Mill. Why, then, are these original contributions overlooked? Because Mill was interested in the advancement of knowl- edge, not in advancing either himself or a set of his own theories. He advanced these original ideas without even calling attention to their originality; consequently, few in his day or ours have recognized what the science of economics owes to him.-F. G. T.

The beauty of a work of art resides in its formal qualities, but its truth rests in its grasp of ex- ternal reality. Roger Fry declared that in the work of art a man's head is of no more significance than a pumpkin, to which Ruskin's reply would have been about as follows: "The artist who sees no more in a man's head than he does in a pump- kin has never seen a man's head at all, whatever he may mean by his 'vision.'

A perceptive comment, in verse, on Tenny- son's language. Miller, Betty. "Tennyson and the Sinful Queen." TC, CLVIII, 355-63. This is without doubt the finest essay on Tennyson in recent years. The reading of Mil- ton's Samson Agonistes made a profound im- pression on the twelve-year-old Tennyson. For the rest of his life he feared he was going blind, and he associated sexual intercourse with the loss of power, as in the case of Merlin, who, after the storm had spent its passion and left the ravaged woodland at peace, confided his secret to Vivien, and slept. "I am Merlin/Who follow the Gleam." Why is it that in the early poetry of Tennyson the woman so often waits in solitude for the lover who is strangely absent? Malory, contends Betty Miller, fascinated Tennyson because of the attachment of man for man in the Morte d'Arthur and the distinct sub- ordination of women. But whereas Malory at- tributed the tragedy to Arthur's incest, Tenny- son suppressed the Oedipus echoes and blamed the fall of the ideal on a woman's lust.-F. G. T. Munsterberg, Margaret.

"Yeats and the Irish Mind." TC, CLVIII, 66-75. Despite its generalizations on something called "the Irish mind," this essay is an excellent speci- men of the much maligned art of appreciation. In retrospect, Yeats seems one of the few poets of the last century whose life and work form a coherent unit, in which even the political wran- gling and theatrical bickering had their proper function in guarding him from sterility. In retro- spect he seems more rational than the rationalists, the poet of greatest intellectual stature since Baudelaire. Nevertheless, his poetry was always too spare. His condescension to Keats is coarse, because "it is so obvious a mask for his own envy of a luxuriance he could never command."- F. G. T. Rao, K. Bhaskaro.
