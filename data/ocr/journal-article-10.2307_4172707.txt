<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOPHOCLES: MERE CONSERVATIVE OR TRUE SEE-R? By PRESTON HEl. EPPs It has been said that the first prayer of a man of genius should be: " Save me from my disciples." The Greek tragedians, espe- cially Sophocles, would doubtless hasten to make that prayer, if they could read some recent interpretations of them and their plays, even by people well able to read them in the original. These interpretations read at times as though the authors were adver- tently or inadvertently "using" Greek drama to reinforce some social or political notion, much like some nineteenth century Eng- lishmen are said to have used Greek history to back up or counter tenets of political parties of the time." Whatever may be the reason for these inadequate interpretations, they have such disregard for the total facts, or so distort them, as to make one wonder whether even first hand acquaintance with a body of material is much insurance against untenable interpreta- tions. Strangely enough, it is Sophocles, the calmest and most even tempered of the Greek tragedians, who comes off worse than Aeschylus or Euripides in these recent interpretations.2 Appar- 1 See Charles M. Andrews, " Some Vagaries and Amenities of History," Fourth Annual Report of the Com,ention of History Teachers of the Middle States and Maryland (1906), p. 48, where he says: " Party prejudice is as strong as that of country, and England furnishes the remarkable instance of a group of men writing in the first half of the nineteenth century who used their historical material and subject as an opportunity for demon- strating the truth of their party doctrines. Macaulay's History of Eng- land is but a huge party pamphlet. Mitford's History of Greece is an unconcealed attempt to uphold the cause of monarchy and the Tories; and Thirlwall's History of Greece supplements Mitford's in the zeal it dis- plays in defense of aristocratic government. To both of these works Grote is a reply which, in twelve volumes, applauds the cause of popular liberty and the program of the Whigs." Professor Andrews discusses this subject further in the American Historical Review, XXX (1925), 243 ff. 2 The type of interpretation this article has in mind may be seen in the following: Edith Hamilton, The Great Age of Greek Literature (New York: Norton, 1942), pp. 258-283. Alan M. G. Little, Myth and Society in Attic Drama (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1942), pp. 43-6 et alibi. How purely 427</page><page sequence="2">428 Sophocles: Mere Conservative or True See-r? ently because Sophocles does not rail at life and his world, he is classifie(d as a "conservative, the upholder of an established order," who was unpained by any injustice or suffering around him and therefore never raised his voice against such, while Euripides is proclaimed the " great modern," the supreme agonizer over the distress and injustice of the world.4 It is odd how often Euripides is extolled wherever Sophocles is berated.5 Whether subjective this work at times becomes may be seen from the following: "Nor is Antigone other than a tribal heroine in a democratic age the eternal conservative, who cherishes the past as something sacred, and will lay down her life for her convictions," p. 44. G. M. A. Grube, The Drama of Euripides (London: Methuen, 1941), pp. 4-12. WV. K. Prentice, Those Ancient Dramas Called Tragedies (Princeton: Princeton Press, 1942), pp. 73-86. Hoow any one can hold that Antigone's attitudes and conduct are no better in quality than Creon's is remarkable. A similar lack of distinction between the actions and conduct of these two appears in Professor Gilbert Norwood's Greek Tragedy (London: Methuen, 1928), pp. 137-40. See also George Thomson, Aeschylus and Athens (London: Law- rence &amp; Wishart, 1941 ). NVhile this work is not concerned with Sophlocles or Euiripides, it illustrates the lopsided initerpretations becoming prevalent. Buit the final banikruptev of such interpretations of Greek authors enmerges in Mr. Buirton Rascoe's Titans of Literature (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1932), pp. 37-88. For interpretations of Sophocles which keep within the framework of the total facts and preserve also the hierarchy of facts and values, see the f ollowing: Werner Jaeger, Paideia (New York: Oxford Press, 1939), I, 265-282. Paul Shorey, "Sophocles," Martin Lectures (Cambridge: Harvard Press, 1930), I, 57-95. John A. Moore, Sophocles and Arete (Cambridge: Har- vard Press, 1938). 8 See Edith Hamilton, op. cit., p. 262, and Alan M. G. Little, op. cit., pp. 44 and 46. The latter's loose use of an author's statement may be observed in the following: "But as Jebb points out, SophocIes, ever the conservative, makes no innovation in the accepted myth " (p. 46). The phrase "ever the conservative" is not in Jebb's statement. Jebb simply notes, without suggesting a reason, that Sophocles made no innovation in myth on which the Trachiniae was based. See also P. W. Harsh: A Hand- book of Classical Drama (Stanford: Stanford Univ. Press, 1944), p. 89. 'Edith Hamilton, op. cit., pp. 271-80, where Euripides is actually com- pared to Isaiah. 1f The regularity with which commentaries and interpretations have long veered into censure or praise of Sophocles and Euripides, especially Euripides, is a reproach to scholarship. Why commentators do not see that their task is neither to praise nor to blame but to clarify and present the clearest possible picture based on the total facts is something of a mystery.</page><page sequence="3">Preston 1. Epps 429 this is the spirit of an iconoclastic age registering its protest against all who are less violent than itself cannot be known." But whatever its motivation such extolling and berating occur too regularly to be accidental. An example of how the facts of the lives of Sophocles and Euripides are wrenched, and at times disguised a bit, to sup- port an interpretation may be seen in the way writers strain to force these two tragedians into different chronological periods.7 Sophocles' dates are 496/5 to 406/5 B. C. Euripides' are 480 to 406, or 484 to 406. The difference between their births then, is, at most, sixteen years, and may be only twelve. They both lived through (1) the great period of expansion and creative achieve- ment from 479 to about 430 B. C., and (2) almost through the Peloponnesian (civil) war, 431-404 B. C. It was within these periods that the sophists developed and popularized their technique with its amoral basis. Within the first period more thoughtful Athenians seem to have begun to feel obliged to reckon in their thinking with the remarkable amount of 'scientific' speculation which had gotten abroad through the work of philosophers. Thales (ca. 624-547 B. C.), Anaximander (ca. 611-547), Anaximines (6th century), and Pythagoras (6th century) had set forth their various theories of the elements from which all things had come- theories which implied gradual development rather than sudden creation. Xenophanes (6th century) had uttered his effective pro- tests against anthropomorphic polytheism. Heraclitus (ca. 540- 480 B. C.) had propounded his flux and eternal change as the reality back of the universe rather than any permanence, which was, according to him, merely illusion. Anaxagoras (5th century) " G. M. A. Grube, op. cit., p. 12, has the following: "Iconoclasts our- selves, we may the better feel the religion behind his (Euripides') iconoclasm." "Edith Hamilton, op. cit., pp. 259 and 280. Notice the statement "there were scarcely two decades between the two tragedians." Fifteen years (or twelve) lack a good deal of being two decades. Also Alan M. G. Little, op. cit., p. 35, after giving the dates of the three tragedians, says: " Thus between Aeschylus and Sophocles a generation has elapsed, between Sophocles and Euripides half a generation. . . . These writers therefore represent the views of men who grew to maturity at well-spaced intervals in the group life of Athens." As life moved then, is sixteen years (at most and maybe just twelve) a well-spaced interval?</page><page sequence="4">430 Sophocles: Mere Conservative or True See-r? was expounding his doctrine of nous (cosmic reason) as the force back of and responsible for all, while two contemporaries, Leucip- pus and Democritus, were bringing forward their theory of atoms, void, and determinism as a full account of creation. Speculation concerning the nature of things had, in fact, advanced so far by the time of Sophocles and Euripides that the most popular sophist of the time, Gorgias, could argue: (1) that nothing really existed; (2) that if it did, it could not be known; and (3) if it could be known, it could not be communicated.8 The two periods, then, through which both Sophocles and Euripides lived were a time of great growth, expansion, ferment, change, war, and much disintegration. When the first period began, Sophocles was not more than sixteen and Euripides was one (or perhaps five) years old. When the Peloponnesian war began, Sophocles was sixty-five and Euripides at least forty-nine (maybe fifty-three)." I The title of this work was 7repl ro6 ttl Srros I wspl p6cews. It has not survived but a resume6 of its arguments has in Sextus Empiricus' (ca. 200 A. D.) Against the Logiciams, I, sec. 65-87, Loeb ed., II, 35-45. The implications of these early philosophical speculations and the extent to which they had permeated Athenian fifth century society have not been given their deserved emphasis, it seems to me, in interpreting the different outlooks of Sophocles and Euripides. Such knowledge demands a major shift in men's thinking-a shift from the conception of a capriciously created and controlled universe to that of one created and controlled in accordance with unhurrying, inexorable laws, in which the role of time as a major factor is greatly increased. Sophocles' extended statements concern- ing the unwritten cosmic laws (Antig. 450-57 and Oed. Tyr. 863-71) and his acceptance of them seem to indicate, as do the general character of his plays, that he had embraced the latter conception of the cosmos. The tremendous role he gives time as a cosmic agent is seen in Oed. Col. 7-8; 607-20; Ajax. 646-7, 605, 713; Elec. 780-2, 179; Phil. 285; and Trach. 126-35. In times of such intellectual revolution some natures welcome the new knowledge and rise rather readily to a new synthesis of it with all elements given their new and proper place. That is what Charles Kingsley did with the new nineteenth century knowledge. But others, like Bishop Wilberforce, are confused by it anid remain so. In the same way Sophocles seems a good example of one who rose easily to a new synthesis of the new k;nowledge and to a more inclusive outlook, while Euripides seems a good instance of one who never rose above it to new and more adequate perspec- tives but remained confused by it. " Sixty-five seems to many people too old to expect further mental alert- ness or new perspectives. But Sophocles wrote plays for another twenty-</page><page sequence="5">Preston H. Epps 431 But in spite of this sixteen years' difference (and perhaps less) in their ages, and in spite of their being born and living their lives in the same general community, the marked differences in these men are said to be due (1) to the difference in their ages,10 (2) to conservatism in Sophocles, or (3) to the difference in the times in which they " lived," since Sophocles remained " aloof from the spirit of his age and would always have done so no matter what the age." 11 The first of these arguments is unconvincing because the con- temporaneity of the two men was too nearly identical. It would be as true to say that the differences in Emerson and Thoreau were due to their being born fourteen years apart or to their " living " in different times. Professor Jaeger's statement accords better with the facts, and is more convincing. " Fifteen years or so sepa- rated their births," he says,12 "but even in an age of rapid de- velopment that interval was not enough to make them belong to different generations. It was the difference in their characters [Italics mine] which made them express the same world in such widely dissimilar ways." The faultiness of the second and third arguments is not so obvious, though just as real. One of the first things sensed by all who read and live with Sophocles is a calmness in the presence five years, and some of them took first prize. What is generally regarded as his greatest play, poetically at least, was first given posthumously and is said to be the work of the last years of his life. So resourceful and vigorous was his intellect right up to the end. The same was true of Euripides. 10 See supra, note 7 with references. 11 Edith Hamilton, op. cit., p. 280. The full sentence is: " Even though his (Sophocles) long life did not end until a year or two after Euripides' death, he belonged to an earlier day. Or rather it is true that Sophocles was aloof from the spirit of his age and woiuld always have been so no matter what the age." In similar vein Professor Grube (op. cit., p. 5) says: "Long before the outbreak of the Peloponnesian war in 431 B.C., there were many stirrings of new things under the surface of Athenian success, with which the great statesman (Pericles) must have been familiar. But not so the poet. Sophocles probably belonged to a more conservative circle than Pericles. . . . He seems to have retained the outlook of his middle age and to have reinained largely unaffected by the doubts and questions of the younger generation." 'l Paideia (New York: Oxford Press, 1939), I, 329.</page><page sequence="6">432 Sophocles: Mere Conservative or True See-r? of whatever life offers and an adequacy for meeting and in some measure rising above all that life may confront man with. His plays have none of the " weariness, the fever and the fret " 18 which are found, no matter for what reason, in Euripides. This Sopho- clean calm and his apparently always unruffled nature were felt by the Greeks themselves 14 and have been remarked upon by com- mentators ever since. It is an all-pervading calm, with none of the earmarks of a studied or laboriously arrived at addendum to his nature. It seems rather to stem with disconcerting naturalness and ease from a satisfying understanding of the world about him and a congenial oneness with it. This calm was so dominant an element in Sophocles that it diffused itself throughout his plays and communicates itself to readers even today.'5 It must have been this quality which Matthew Arnold had in mind when he spoke of Sophocles 16 as one -" The nearest to such in Sophocles is the complaint against the gods (the only one in the surviving plays) in Trach. 1264-78. How little such sentiments are expected in Sophocles' may be seen in Oates and O'Neill's note (The Complete Greek Drama, New York: Random House, 1938, I, 500) on these lines. It reads (in part) : "There is a puzzling, almost Euripidean ring in these last lines. They scarcely reflect the normal thought of Sopholes. .. . More than a hundred of Sophocles' plays have not survived. What these may have contained can never be known; but this vast lacuna in our kniowledge of Sophocles should always be remembered. 1' See Aristophanes' Frogs 82, where Sophocles is declared content in Hades as he was on earth. The adjective eCKOXOS, which is repeated, means "be in a good humor," " be at peace with." 1I See Professor Jaeger's testimony in Paideia (New York: Oxford Press, 1939), I, 274, which says: " To the question 'what is the nature and meaning of life' Sophocles does not reply, like Aeschylus, with a theory of the universe justifying the ways of God to man, but simply by the form of his speech and the characters of his men and women. This can hardly be understood by those who have never turned to Sophocles for guidance at moments when, in the chaos and unrest of life, all principle and all structure seem to dissolve away, and have never restored the balance of their own lives by contemplating the firm harmonious repose of his poetry." This tribute seems the greater when it is remembered that it was written in the midst of the rise of Naziism. Professor Shorey used to speak of a similar effect upon himself from reading and contemplating Sophocles' poetry. He emphasized the fact that Sophocles had never failed to refresh and restore him. "I See his sonnet: To a Friend.</page><page sequence="7">Preston H. Epps 433 whose even-balanced soul From first youth tested up to extreme old age, Business could not make dull nor Passion wild; Who saw life steadily and saw it whole. He " saw life steadily and saw it whole! " That is the statement this article would like to offer as the real reason back of those attitudes and actions in Sophocles which are being attributed to conservatism or to indifference to what was around him. This line of Matthew Arnold's is the most penetrating and adequate brief estimate yet made of Sophocles and his work, and the one most consonant with the total facts of his life and with his plays. It is difficult to imagine a truer brief characterization of the man and his work. There have never been many men who have insisted on looking at life steadily and on the basis of something like all essential factors-who refuse to make any part or parts of life as im- portant as the whole of it. But there have been a few; and the calmness with which they are able to meet and rise above all that life confronts them with is regular and noteworthy. Sophocles and Socrates especially, and to a lesser degree Matthew Arnold and Emerson are four examples. Such men are seldom the favorites of radicals and iconoclasts. And naturally so; because radicals and iconoclasts, like the majority of mankind, generally insist on some single or, at best, few factors of life as all that really matter. They are therefore generally characterized by that impatience natural to a partial view.'7 But the men mentioned above, who insist on something like a total view of life, never seem in a hurry. And naturally so, too; not because they are conservatives, in the ordinary sense of that term, or upholders of some status quo, but because their steady and more complete outlook on life keeps them concerned lest, while they are doing away with something they recognize as neither right nor desirable, they also (1) destroy something very much needed for the healthful on-going of the world, or (2) set in crea- tive motion thereby something worse or more undesirable than the thing being destroyed. They are aware of the fact that mere destruction of something undesirable does not, in and of itself, 17 This is not said in disparagement of radicals but merely to call atten- tion to the essential partiality of the radical outlook.</page><page sequence="8">434 Sophocles: Mere Conservative or True See-r? insure something more desirable-that the mere doing something about something is not always progress, or even amelioration. They have seen that the cosmos is not going to give man any better or more adequate life except in proportion as its basic demands for such a life are met. Their first concern, therefore, is to discover more clearly what these demands are and project all action in fuller accord with them. A close examination of the life and work of such men will show thev were men of action, though never of swift action. They seem keenly aware of the on-going nature of the universe, and that bit of knowledge, genuinely believed, is sufficient to save one from all conservatism which stems from a desire to keep something as it is. But that conservatism which is concerned to retain in this on-going process all that has proved essential to the best life for all is, of course, another matter; and it is easy to sense in these men, as in all who insist on looking at life steadily and seeing it whole, this type of conservatism. What is the evidence for holding that Sophocles' " calm harmony with himself and with his world " was due to a wholeness and clarity of vision rather than to indifference to or aloofness from his age, or to concern for maintaining some status quo? The poetry of the seven extant plays and the characters he portrays in them; for Professor Jaeger seems right again in saying that Sophocles' answer to the problems life poses is not so much in verbal state- ments as in the "firm harmonious repose of his poetry" and in the action and character of the men and women he portrays.'8 One of the most remarkable passages illustrating this wholeness of view is in the Oedipus Coloneus 607-20. Oedipus has just told Theseus that he (Oedipus) has come with what will one day prove a help for Athens against Thebes. Theseus promptly brushes aside the idea that relations between Athens and Thebes shall ever de- teriorate from their present friendly state. Whereupon, Oedipus reminds him: O dearest son of Aegeus, to gods alone comes never age nor death, But on all else all-mastering time his sure confusion works. Both strength of earth and strength of body wane; "ISee quotation in note 15. Also: "Sophocles . . . expressed his own moral standards in the characters he drew." Paideia (New York: Oxford Press, 1939), I, 275.</page><page sequence="9">Preston H. Epps 435 Faith dies, while faithlessness buds forth; And never the same feeling long remains Of friend to friend and city unto city. For soon to some and later unto others Things pleasant turn to bitter and then again to joy. If now with Thebes your affairs are all fair weather, Immeasurable time, as on it goes, Brings into being countless days and nights In which your present profitable pledges Shall for small reason be scattered by the spear." Aside from the implicit wholeness of view in this passage, three things are worth noting: (1) it is a protest against an easy con- tentedness in Theseus. (2) The sentimenlt must be close to, if not entirely, Sophocles' own; for there is nothing in Oedipus' character 19 See also Trach. 126-35, where the cycle of joy and woe for all is com- mented upon without complaint. Ajax 666-78 is somewhat similar in tenor. After Ajax has been thwarted by Athena in his attempt to avenge himself on the Greek leaders at Troy, his devoted concubine, Teemessa, tries to dissuade him from further action. In a moment of feigned yielding to her he says: Henceforth, then we shall yield to gods And learn to reverence the Atreidae. They are our rulers and must be yielded to. And pray, why not? For dreaded things and things most powerful yield to authority. The snowy winters yield to fruitful summers. The weary round of night gives way to day, With its white steeds, to kindle forth its light. The blasts of dreaded winds, too, often leave the groaning sea to sleep; And likewise too all-powerful sleep, Although it binds its victims, sets them free, And does not, having seized them, hold them ever, And we, shall we not learn to know our proper place? I shall. This may at first sound like mere acquiescence in whatever happens to be. But read in the light of the full context and in the light of Ajax' previous conduct, it seems a way of saying: Not lawlessness, such as I tried, but proper conformity (not to things as they happen to be) to those prerequisites laid down by the universe as sine qua non for healthful individual and group life is what all must do who would gain a fuller, better life. The word translated "know one's proper place" (awopoveip) seems the key to a proper interpretation of the passage. Its noun form is the word for the Greek cardinal virtue of moderation, temperance, proper restraint and expression. It is not used of mere yielding, acquies- cent action but of intelligent, wise (not just expedient) conduct.</page><page sequence="10">436 Sophocles: Mere Conservative or True See-r? per se to demand that the dramatist have him speak in this vein. (3) There is no hint of complaint because the world is such. A second passage illustrating this wholeness of view is the mes- senger's comment on the passing of Oedipus in lines 1606-66 of the same play. This passage has an even more personal Sophoclean tone; for messengers, whose task was to describe the tragic hap- pening in a Greek play, had no particular character in which they had to speak. Oedipus, "made venerable by his suffering" and " hallowed by pain," has had a peacefully triumphant passing from this life, called audibly from it and directed by some unseen power to his place of translation. The messenger, apparently not content with describing Oedipus' departure, adds: And by wvhat fate it was that Oedipus won his release from life, No living mian save Theseus e'er can tell. No lightiting flaslh divine accomplished it, Nor any sea storm wakened at the time; But some one of the gods conveyed him thence, Or else the nether depth in griefless welcome Did rend itself for him. For without moan and pained by no disease Did Oedipus depart this life; a passing Truly wondrous, if ever mortal any such has known. And if I seem herein as speaking folly, No commerce crave I with such foolish minded.20 Note again the absence of even a suggestion of complaint at any- thing in Oedipus' experience. The passage seems rather to grow out of a feeling that a sufferer has been seen through his suffering, and not wholly to his disadvantage. I have long wondered if the two Oedipus plays may not be Sophocles' comment on the Aeschy- lean dogma,2' fixed by Zeus, of learning through suffering. A further indication of the inclusiveness of Sophocles' view of life is his insistence upon reckoning with those god-ordained laws of character and justice which brook no disobedience apart from dire results. This idea is emphasized in three of the surviving plays.22 The passages in the Oedipus Tyrannus and Antigone are 2s The personal judgmlent of the last two lines is surprising.

There is a good deal in Greek literature about 6.ypacoo (d-ypairvo()</page><page sequence="11">Preston H. Epps 437 extended ones. The first of these, uttered by the chorus just after Jocasta's confident disparagement of oracles, says: May it be my lot to live with reverent purity For all the words and deeds those laws sublime enjoin- Laws brought to birth through the clear heaven, And which were fathered only by Olympus. No mortal nature gave them birth, Nor shall oblivion lay them e'er to sleep; For god is great within them, and never grows he old. Again, there is nothing in the character of the chorus which would make it necessary for Sophocles to have it speak in this vein; for the chorus is more variable and less marked in character than any participant in Greek tragedy except messengers, perhaps. The second passage is entirely in character but is also so like in tone to the one just cited, which was not demanded by the character of the speaker, that it seems fair to claim a Sophoclean feeling in it too. Antigone, caught burying her brother, has been brought before Creon whose decree his burial defied. Creon asks if she knew of the decree. "Certainly," she says, "for it was quite evident." "And did you then dare to transgress it?" Antigone replies: Of course I did; for it was not Zeus Who had made this proclamation; Nor has justice, dweller with the gods below, Marked off such laws for mortals. Nor did I think that your decrees, Being those of a mortal, were sufficiently strong To override the firm, unwritten laws of god. Not merely now and yesterday they live, but evermore, And no man knows from whence they came. This hardly sounds like mere instinctive action, as Professor Kitto strangely describes Antigone's conduct.23 These two pas- sages and other briefer references leave one with the feeling that there must be at least an unfortunate ambiguity, if not an inad- u6Aol. See Xen. Me-n. IV, 4, 19; Lysias, VI, 10; Thuc. II, 37, 3; Demos. XVIII, 275; Arist. Eth. Nic. 8, 13, 5. See especially R. Hirzel "&amp;ypacos v6Aos,"Abh. d. Sichs. Ge8ellsch. d.

Another indication of the steady wholeness of Sophocles' view is the large, more-than-local attitude of his characters generally. Except for certain traditionally hateful types such as ilenelaus, they never lose entirely a certain nobility. They exhibit a marked freedom from petulance, pettiness, and railing at life or their lot in it.28 They never engage in tirades against groups or types of humanity27 such as Hippolytus' outburst against women and against the fact that the human race is dependent upon such for its continuance. Electra's revenge, unlike Medea's, is for her father rather than for herself. Creon's harshness seems rooted in some concern for the state rather than in mere personal exalta- tion. Oedipus' concern never quite yields to mere personal con- siderations. And so on with Sophocles' major characters. The way in which Sophocles' characters meet life is a further 2"G. M. A. Grube, op. cit. (London: Methuen, 1941), p. 5. 11 Edith Hamilton, op. cit., p. 262. Similarly, Professor Greene (Moira, Cambridge: Harvard Press, 1944, p. 145), commenting on the last six lines of the Antigone, says: " Sophocles is writing as a religiouis concerva- tive." Here, as in several of these recent commentaries, the woid conserva- tive seems to be used to describe all attitudes which do not find fault with accepted terminology or statements. It takes no account of the well-known practice (especially in religious matters) of giving the same term richer and more inclusive meanings. It would be about as reasoiiable to accuse scientists, who use already familiar and accredited formulae, of beiiig conservatives. 36 Sophocles' plays, like all dranmas, are variously and volumninously interpreted. His Electra, for instance, is called everything from " niatri- cide with cheerfulness " to an unqualified rejection of the crime (Kitto, op. cit., p. 133 ff.). There is space here for only the most generalized glance at the general character of his characters. It should be remembered that what happened to traditional Greek tragic characters and their general reactions to it were already fixed by Greek tradition much like the larae details of what a Biblical character may do are fixed for us. But the spirit in which they might act and react and their attitude toward what might befall them were within the playwright's handling. 97 There is an outburst against greed for power and wealth in Oed. Tyr. 380-89 and one against priestly venality in Antig. 1033-47. They are both angry outbursts, and not calculated ones.</page><page sequence="13">Preston H. Epps 439 testimony to a more inclusive view. Sentimental self-pity for what life hands them is never characteristic of them.28 They confront life, look squarely at what it presents them with,'" recognize it for what it is, and then meet it either by living above it, yielding to it only as they have to and with a certain nobility, or acknowledging, as Creon does in the Antigone, the error responsible for the situation and trying to remedy it. The protests of Sophocles' characters against angry, retaliatory conduct as less becomi:ng and adequate than a more reasoned course of action is in accord with their characteristic nobility and is also an indication of greater wholeness of view. Such protests appear in four plays 30 and are the more surprising, because noth- ing is more openly avowed in Greek literature than retaliation and plenty of it. But even Odysseus, the shiftiest character in Greek literature, argues against it in the Ajax, and that too when it would apparently have been to his advantage to agree to it. And so, although Sophocles is too timeless to be confined to any single interpretation, several prominent factors seem to indicate that it was a steady wholeness of view in him rather than aloofness from his times or complacency in his own good fortune which was responsible for his irritating calm and his essentially noble and uncomplaining characters. University of North Carolina. "I The commos in Antig. 806-882 reads much like one. But such scenes (generally of grief) were so much a regular part of Greek tragedy that they were given a technical name. They are different in tone and conteilt from the non-lyric ones of the kind seen in Euripides' Jflectra 300 if. 2 Deianeira's attitude in Trach. 436-59 toward what faces her accords well with the attitude of Sophocles' characters generally.
