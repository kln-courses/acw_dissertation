<plain_text><page sequence="1">Henry V and the Paradox of the Body Politic CLAIRE MCEACHERN T HE AMBIVALENT PRACTICE AND EFFECT OF SHAKESPEARE S HENRY V is by now a critical commonplace. In Norman Rabkin's definitive charac- terization, the play's shifting portrayal of political power provides the fulcrum of its affective structure: the state appears alternately as beneficent or coercive, displaying "the simultaneity of our deepest hopes and fears about the world of political action."' Ambivalence about the stance of the play (and, by implication, those of its author and the Elizabethan theater) with regard to the imperatives of the Elizabethan state persists in more recent critical evaluations. Arguments that the play presents an ideal por- trait of state power emphasize the comic rhythm of the ending or perspec- tives such as that of the Chorus; evidence to the contrary includes Henry's denial of his former tavern companions, his insensitivity to the common soldiers, and his rapacious wooing of Katharine of France. Historicist critics phrase the play's representation of power in a vocabulary of subversion (the suspension of hegemonic interest) or mystification (the state's canny occlu- sion of its coercive nature),2 tending to resolve the play's ambivalence in the direction of the ultimately coercive nature of the state (hence the bleak fashion, in many current arguments, for subversion to become mystifica- tion).3 Feminist critics, too, have recently underscored the pejorative nature of the play's representation of power as it manifests itself through the I would like to thank those people whose generous responses helped shape this essay, especially David Bevington, James K.

Karen Newman writes, for instance, that Henry "domesticates [Katherine's] difference, refashioning the other as the same.... Katherine is not only 'englished' but silenced as well."4 What is of most interest to me is the terminology invoked in such evaluations of hegemony. Changes in critical fashion notwithstanding, discussion of Henry V's ambivalence frequently takes place in terms of Henry's character, a process in which the fleeting appeal of the state is that of its chief officeholder. As Rabkin observed, the play orchestrates our feelings about power through its depiction of Henry's personability, a personability coded as interiority: "Shakespeare reveals the conflicts be- tween ... our longing that authority figures can be like us and our suspicion that they must have traded away their inwardness for the sake of power."5 Despite current attempts to denaturalize notions of human subjectivity, Henry V frames response as a referendum on the fluctuating personableness of the king. Whether seen as a function of generic miscegenation or of the contradictions of social context, the play's ambiguity often surfaces in critical discourse in the terminology of personality. Whether they portray Henry as an "amiable monster," "an imperfect man," or "the man placed at a disadvantage in the sphere of personal relations by the fact of a corporate self,"6 discussions of the character typically gauge his appeal in terms of his relative "humanity," as if such a quality were a matter of degree.7 That we persist in discussing dramatic constructs as people-in Catherine Belsey's terms, "unified, knowing and autonomous" "perhaps testifies to our inheritance of novelistic notions of character (and no doubt owes more to our tendency to consider people as people). In the case of Henry V, modern narratives of the liberal subject are reinforced by Shakespeare's provision, in the second tetralogy, of a narrative of psychological matura- tion for this mirror of all Christian kings. Such personability is also a function of the phenomenology of acting: not only an actor's ability to 4 See "Englishing the Other: 'le tiers exclu' and Shakespeare's Henry V," Fashioning Femininity (Chicago, 1991), 95-108, esp. 104. 5 Rabkin, 296. 6 See, respectively, William Hazlitt, "Henry V" in "The Characters of Shakespear's Plays" in The Complete Works of William Hazlitt, ed.

Price, ed. (University Park, PA, 1975), 92-117, esp. 107. 7 For example, Joanne Altieri in "Romance in Henry V" (Studies in English Literature 21 [1981]: 223-40) states that in 4.1 "Henry is humanized for us to a greater degree than anywhere else in the play" (228). Similarly, Rabkin asks, "can the manipulative qualities that guarantee political success be combined in one man with the spiritual qualities that make one fully open and responsive to life and therefore fully human?" (281). This terminology of subjectivity exerts a pull on even those efforts that attempt to account for the play's contradictions within the contingencies of social context. Most recently, Joel Altman, in an analysis of the play's rhetoric, attempts to locate this duality in the ambivalence Elizabethans manifested in regard to the Irish wars. Yet he, too, examines the duality as a function of character: his phrase "participating the king" (i.e., "not only sharing his presence with others but absorbing in return their private thoughts and words") attempts to measure our relative kinship to or estrangement from what-or, rather, whom-we inevitably relate to as a person; see his " 'Vile Participation': The Amplification of Violence in the Theater of Henry V," SQ 42 (1991): 1-32, esp. 7. 8 The Subject of Tragedy: Identity and difference in Renaissance drama (London, 1985), 8.

I will argue that discussion of the play's representation of power in terms of personhood derives from a similar inflection in Elizabethan discourses of communality. I wish, then, to examine the "person-ality" of Henry as sharing in the Elizabethan personification of the crown, sharing not so much in a discourse of personal subjectivity as in the tropes of subjectivity used to produce a particular Elizabethan political affect-that of corporate identity, of what we might call "the nation."'0 By personification I mean in part the anthropomorphic imagining of political process in terms of human agency, or what Phyllis Rackin has described as the Elizabethan humanist's secularizing attention to the "sec- ond causes" of historical process, "that is, . . . [to] human actions and their consequences."" Such personification, like the medieval theory of the monarch's two bodies, attempts to describe the relationship between the respective claims and longevities of individual interest and state power; it is also indebted to John Foxe's Actes and Monuments, arguably the first English "popular" history, in imagining historical agency not merely as the property of human rulers but of ordinary (if elect) people. But in addition to this "population" of political terminology, I would like to examine the affective or interpellative ramifications of the Elizabethan deployment of a vocabu- lary of the monarch's private identity in the service of corporate identity: what, in other words, are the consequences of imagining the state as if it were a person? Admittedly, to consider the symbolic evocation of person- hood as a function of political identity may work only to denaturalize identity at the expense of mystifying power. The formulation may also seem overweening, since in early modern England, state power was largely concentrated in-or at least symbolically configured by-a person. Yet what I wish to explore is the way this discourse of personhood animates corporate identity. Literary personification operates through a range of techniques, from denotations of psychological interiority (Rabkin's "inwardness") to the more material portrait of a body (itself often a trope of affect) or of the passions. Tudor rhetorician George Puttenham describes personification as the "at- tribut[ion of] any humane quality ... to dombe creatures or other insensi- 9 Belsey, 15. 10 I use the term nation advisedly but emphatically. Most current political theory limits national identity to a post-nineteenth-century location, a product of the presumed social homogeneity produced by industrialism; see, e.g., Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism, rev. ed. (London, 1991); Ernest Gellner, Nations and Nationalism (Ithaca, NY, 1983); E. J. Hobsbawm, Nations and Nationalism Since 1790: programme, myth, reality (Cambridge, 1990). I would argue for an early modern political consciousness shaped, among other things, by the state institutionalization and centralization of religious practices. Criticism typically treats Henry V's nationalism as a synonym for state ideology (hence as propagandistic) and invariably considers its operations repressive; see Altman, 8; and Dollimore and Sinfield in Drakakis, ed., 211. "Stages of History: Shakespeare's English Chronicles (Ithaca, NY, 1990), 6.</page><page sequence="4">36 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY ble things, ... to giue them a humane person." Henry Peacham defines it as "the fayning of a person, that is, when to a thing senseless or dumme, wee fayne a fit person," giving as an example: "an Oratoure by this figure maketh the common wealth to speake."' 2 Like many rhetorical operations, prosopopoeia depends on the construction of a similitude in which certain attributes of one term are conferred on another-"to borrow the name of one thing, to expresse another, that did in something much resemble it."'93 Indeed, personification literalizes this similitude; the endowment of an abstract ideal with human aspect typically relies for its effect on the attri- bution of speech to the "dumme," speech that then produces the transac- tions of empathic identification or a kind of fellowship. As Peacham ex- plains, "The vse of this figure is very profytable in perswading, chyding, complayning, praysing, and pittying."'14 Not surprisingly, among the re- sponses attendant on dramatic characterization is a recognition between auditor and character of a common affect, as when a character seems to speak one's own thoughts-for example, Coleridge's smack of Hamlet-or in the milder acknowledgment that "he" or "she" may be measured against one's own image: like or unlike, the important fact is that the auditor entertains the possibility of a shared identity. Tellingly, discussions of Henry V's "humanity" often index its presence as "fellow feeling" or a consciousness of mutuality. Rabkin, for example, asks: "can [the king's] political resourcefulness be combined with qualities more like those of an audience as it sees itself" 15 Or as Richard Helgerson observes, "Shakespeare's play unequivocally denies [a dream of commonality].... King Hal ... scarcely remembers his own humanity, which is squeezed almost to nothing by the burden, as he likes to think of it, of his office."''6 As these two formulations indicate, the transactions of audience-charac- ter identification in a history play, or even the alliances among characters within a play (the two may be intimately related), are instrumental to political identities. Personification's animating correspondences are per- haps especially relevant to a modern, democratic notion of popular sover- eignty, given its assumptions about the state's obligation to elide differences between power and people, between "office" and "an audience as it sees itself." However, as Rabkin and Helgerson also indicate, modern appre- hensions of Henry's personhood tend to imagine an antipathy between hegemonic power and fellow feeling, a binary in which Henry's humanity exists in an inverse proportion to "his" accommodation of state interests. In other words, we attribute variations in how we feel about power in Henry V to the mutability of character rather than of power. Such an antipathy is typical (if paradoxically so) of our Qwn democratic imagination, which, while it holds to the ideal that common feeling may coexist with state power, more often betrays skepticism about this possibility, especially with regard 12 Puttenham, The Arte of English Poesie (London, 1589), 200; Peacham, The Garden of Eloquence (London, 1577), sig. 03r. 13 Peacham, sig. BIv. 14 Peacham, sig. 03v. It could be argued that the construction of simile mimics the forma- tional processes of group identity: some valences are held in common, while others are excluded. 15 Rabkin, 281 (emphasis added). 16 Helgerson, 232.</page><page sequence="5">HENRY V: THE PARADOX OF THE BODY POLITIC 37 to earlier state formations.'7 The now-commonplace consideration of the early modern state as ultimately hegemonic exacerbates such skepticism; any apprehension of early modern democratic impulses, we are told, is anachronistic-a false recognition, so to speak, of fellowship between past and present, monarchy and democracy (anachronism being a habit for which nationalism is also notorious). Such efforts to adjudicate historical difference have rightly served to estrange Shakespeare, whether out of an effort to denaturalize hegemony (while affirming its persistence) or, more wistfully (even Whiggishly), in order to argue some difference between Elizabethan state power and the state power of democracy. While I acknowledge the dangers of anachronism, as well as the naivete of the hope that hegemony could be other than sinister, my chief target is the assumption that the exercise of state power stands in an unequivocally negative relation to human bonds, the position that reads fluctuation in Henry V's portrait of hegemony as deriving not from any variant depreda- tions of state power but from Henry's intermittent allegiance to its unvary- ing coercive interests. In discussions of Henry V's character, this position generates the nonsensical diagnosis of a flickering presence of Henry's personhood or humanity. In other words, it produces a discourse of relative human-ness, when, taxonomically speaking, either one is human or one is not. Apprehensions about the shifting appearances of Henry's fellow feel- ing owe less, I suspect, to the stringency of a postmodern ethos of discon- tinuous subjectivity than to a pious attempt to purge the terms human and humanity of what we would like to believe are nonhuman (or, conversely, all-too-human) tendencies: self-interest, for instance, or the will to power. In what follows I hope to demonstrate that such a segregation of person- hood and power was not the habit of the Elizabethan discourse of social identity in which Henry V participates, and that social mutuality and tyranny were alike described in terms of monarchic personhood. In so doing, I hope to reveal that the Elizabethan vocabulary of corporate identity did not imagine the relationship between fellowship and hegemony to be an exclu- sively antithetical one. Rather, much as personhood figures both fellowship and hegemony, so are they complicit forms of social existence. I would like then to argue for the location of the source of the play's multivalent portrait of state power as within neither Shakespeare's ambivalent attitude toward state power nor his text's ambivalent representation of it but within the coincidental nature of state power itself as imagined by Elizabethan termi- nologies. I will approach this vocabulary by way of one of the major discourses available to us in which monarchic personhood and corporate identity intersect, namely, that of the social practice of the Elizabethan theater. For the most part, the contest for control of the Tudor theater was curiously predictable. London authorities repeatedly insisted on the need for civic order and argued for the unruly potential of plays; and the Privy 17 Quentin Skinner observes that such an antipathy-"the idea that the confrontation between individuals and states furnishes the central topic of political theory"-is relatively recent in conception, dating from Hobbes's elaboration of a notion of a state independent of charismatic personal occupation; see "The State" in Political innovation and conceptual change, Terence Ball, James Farr, and Russell L. Hanson, eds. (Cambridge, 1989), 90-131, esp. 90.</page><page sequence="6">38 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY Council replied, somewhat coyly, in terms of the need to provide royal "solace": "the vse and exercise of suche plaies, not beinge euill in yt self, may with a good order and moderacion be suffered in a well gouerned estate, and ... hir Maiestie beinge pleased at some times to take delighte and recreacion in the sight and hearinge of them, some order is fitt to bee taken for the allowance and mainteinance of suche persons, as are thoughte meetest in that kinde to yeald hir Maiestie recreacion and delight."'98 The Privy Council defended playing as compatible with civic order, while Lon- don authorities attacked royal prerogative as a defense both of municipal order and, in 1592, of "a Christian Common wealthe." In 1594 players became, for city authorities, "the very sinck &amp; contagion not only of this Citie but of this whole Realm." And in 1595 and 1597 the authorities' concern for "the good government of this Cytie" produced the conviction "that neither in policye nor in religion [plays] ar to be permitted in a Christian Common wealthe."'9 The escalation of stakes from the local "good government of this Cytie" to the entirety of the "Christian Common wealthe" may have been no more than a sign of mayoral desperation, the "Common wealthe" becoming the highest rhetorical ground in a turf fight that was, as Steven Mullaney's work makes clear, both literal and symbolic.20 But even if the "real" argument concerned the place of the stage within the city of London, its terms were more than local: city authorities, Privy Council, queen, and players alike increasingly insisted that the issue was the place of theater in the social whole.2' Though the respective interests of the disputants may indeed have been merely partisan-the aldermen concerned only with civic order, the Privy Council with aristocratic allegiance, the queen with royal prerogative, and the players with private enterprise-the issue at stake, and the term of its expression, is corporate. Whereas municipal authorities emphasized the common good that flows from comprehensive order, Elizabeth's formulation placed the pleasure of plays quite literally in a common weal. For the monarch, plays existed "aswell for the recreacion of our loving subjects, as for our solace and pleasure."22 18 "Order of the Privy Council," 22 June 1600, reprinted in E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 vols. (Oxford, 1923), 4:329-31, esp. 330. 19 Chambers, 4:317, 318, 321, and 330. The term commonwealth makes its initial Elizabethan appearance in this context in a royal proclamation of 1559 forbidding public representation of political matters: "also some [plays] that haue ben of late vsed, are not conuenient in any good ordred Christian Common weale to be suffred" (Proclamation 509, reprinted in Chambers, 4:263). 20 See The Place of the Stage: License, Play, and Pouter in Renaissance England (Chicago, 1988), 1-88. 21 While my discussion is limited to the London context of theater relations, the touring existence of theater companies in this period provides another possible practice of (or at least metaphor for) the unification of diverse communities in a common cultural lexicon. For a discussion of the effects of national consolidation on provincial theater, see Peter Womack, "Imagining Communities: Theaters and the English Nation in the Sixteenth Century" in Culture and History 1350-1600: Essays on English Communities, Identities and Writing, David Aers, ed.

Royal rhetoric nonchalantly uses theater as a trope for an idealized monarch-subject relationship. Elizabeth's subjects are "loving," not least because they have been given theater.24 In the royal formulation, theater stands as an index of the monarch-subject bond. The survival of theater companies had no doubt more to do with private enterprise than with royal protection and depended less on a queen's appetite than on a commodified taste for entertainment. Further, Eliza- beth's "permission" of this communal activity may be an instance of a state's attempt to regulate what it cannot thoroughly prohibit, and the ease with which the royal voice acknowledged the theater's existence may have been the result of a studied nonchalance rather than an indulgence. Yet however heterogeneous the social practice, the royal position elaborates a rhetoric of mutuality, of a political identity founded in common feeling. Indeed, as has been well noted in recent criticism, much of the antitheatrical literature takes as its principal grievance the theater's potential construction of a "common" identity in its suspected erosion of social distinctions, both by means of its representational content and through the effects of its material practice.25 Perhaps most threatening was the literal congregation produced Time His Form and Pressure': Rehistoricizing Shakespeare's Theater," New Literary History 20 [1988]: 83-104, esp. 91). The coy or nostalgic quality of thejustification's image of the relation between sovereign and subjects (and the innocent mutuality of theatrical pleasure) is perhaps corroborated by another stock defense of the theater's origins, the citation of a medieval precedent of a pleasure-loving king: Edward IV is variously cited as having liked to see plays (e.g., Thomas Heywood, Apology for Actors [London, 1608], sig. E lv). 23 The theatrical experience is not, of course, necessarily pleasurable, any more than it is homogeneous; or, rather, pleasure (like pain) is notoriously difficult to generalize, as are its effects. Robert Weimann defines theatrical pleasure as subversive: "one of the ways by which the Elizabethan theater appropriated power was to challenge the representation of authority by an alternative authority of theatrical representation which derived at least part of its strength from vitalizing and mobilizing a new space for Spass [fun, pleasure], with all its irreverent and equalizing implications in the social process" ("Towards a literary theory of ideology: mimesis, representation, authority" in Howard and O'Connor, eds., 265-72, esp. 272). 24 The question of whether the product of theater was a community unified in support of order or a community unified in opposition to it informed to some extent the earliest Tudor discussions of the place of the stage. Defenses of the theater struggle to argue its relevance to the health of the common weal, with strategies that ranged from the naively homiletic to the cynically repressive. Henry VIII proclaimed in Acts 34 and 35 of 1543 that it is "lawfull to all and euery persone and personnes, to sette forth songes playes and enterludes, to be vsed and exercised within this realme, &amp; other the kynges dominions, for the rebukyng and reproching of vices, &amp; the setting forth of vertue" (reprinted in Hazlitt, ed., 2-6, esp. 5). While this defense would not be forthcoming from a royal quarter again in the Tudor age, a similar tactic harnessed the pleasure of plays for purposes of social control: "the people must haue soom kynd of recreation" was the (skeptical) paraphrase of the municipal authorities' "and that policie requireth to divert idle heads and other ill disposed from other woorse practize" ("The Lord Mayor to Lord Burghley," 3 November 1594, reprinted in Chambers, 4:316-17). 25 See, for instance, chaps. 1 and 2 of Jean E. Howard's The Stage and Social Struggle in Early Modern England (New York and London, 1994). Actors' violation of sumptuary laws, their</page><page sequence="8">40 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY by the theatrical occasion: "the assemblies of multitudes of the Queenes people" was a fact alluded to in many a mayoral complaint.26 The descrip- tion of theater's public availability as a function of royal munificence, the queen's conflation of allegiance and commonality, suggests a mystification of order in which the city fathers were loath to concur. Elizabeth of course did not literally share her subjects' pleasure, or vice versa: public players attended the queen, but the queen herself never attended public theater. But what in fact the aldermen objected to was the extrapolation of public theater from Elizabeth's private appetite, the as- sumption that the latter in some sense occasioned and excused the former. Whereas the queen's voice emphasized the innocence of a common plea- sure, resistance to theatrical practice sought to construe innocence as cor- ruption, corporateness as corporeality. Antitheatrical discourse casts Eliza- beth's penchant for plays and aristocratic sponsorship of theater companies as a willful exercise of private appetite at the expense of corporate order. As one opponent bemoaned, "Alas, that priuate affection should so raigne in the Nobilite, that to pleasure, as they thinke, their seruants . . . they should restraine the Magistrates from executing their office."27 Another critic focused on the theater's transgression of the boundaries of monarchic affect and the subsequent effect upon social hierarchies: "there is no passion wherwith the king, the soueraigne maiestie of the Realme was possest, but is amplified, and openly sported with, and made a May-game to all the beholders."28 If such a statement censures the violation of social decorum in the translation of royal "passion" to "May-game," another complaint contends that the commonly carnal nature of theatrical pleasure itself dissolves another hierarchical boundary-that between humans and ani- mals: "Tragedies and Commedies stirre vp affections, and affections are naturally planted in that part of the minde that is common to vs with brute beastes."29 The same writer objected to the effects of theatrical practice on the borders between private and public: "in a commonweale, if priuat men be suffered to forsake theire calling because they desire to walke gentleman like in sattine &amp; velvet, with a buckler at theire heeles, proportion is so broken, vnitie dissolued, harmony confounded, that the whole body must be dismembred and the prince or the heade cannot choose but sicken."30 And, as the final phrase of this statement suggests, the ultimate recourse was that of the queen's body itself: impersonation of authoritative and gendered figures, and the physical mingling of social and gender hierarchies in theater audiences are alike cited as evidence of the theater's disorder. Stephen Gosson in Playes Confuted in flue Actions (Ldndon, 1582) observes: "for a boy to put one the attyre, the gesture, the passions of a woman; for a meane person to take vpon him the title of a Prince with counterfeit porte, and traine, is by outwarde signes to shewe them selues otherwise then they are, and so with in the compasse of a lye" (sig. E5). 26 See "Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London to Lord Chamberlain Sussex," 2 March 1574, reprinted in Chambers, 4:271-72 and passim. Congregation is described throughout in pejorative terms: "the inordynate hauntyinge of greate multitudes of people" and "such conventicles of people by such meanes called together whereof the greater number is the meanest sort" (273, 269). 27 Anthony Munday, A second blast of retrait from plaies and Theaters (1580), reprinted in Chambers, 4:2 10. 28 Henry Crosse, Vertues Common-wealth, or the High-Way to Honour (London, 1603), sig.

The communal nature of playing is confirmed, ultimately, by its ability to communicate plague to the "royal persone" of Elizabeth.32 The- atrical activity and appetites are literally corporeal threats: both originate from, and return to, the body. Whereas in royal discourse a common appetite for theatrical pleasure links the monarch with her subjects, the discourse of order emphasizes a far greater leveler, the common vulnera- bility to mortality. The representation of social mutuality as unruly corporeality was not limited to antitheatrical discourse; on the contrary, such representation was a commonplace of political theory. The Homily of Obedience, for instance, portrays the erosion of social hierarchy as resulting in (and from) "carnal liberty, enormity, sin, babylonical confusion ... no man shall keep his wife, children, possession in quietness, all things shall be common."33 Or, as Thomas Elyot warns, "they which do suppose [commonwealth] so to be called for that. . . euery thinge shulde be to all men in comune without discrepance of any estate or condition, be thereto moued more by sensualitie than by any good reason or inclination to humanitie."34 Both of these texts imagine social commonness as a comprehensive pursuit of individual interests, not (as we tend to) as a collective sacrifice of them. Yet as such a warning reveals, the labile quality of theatrical congregation (was it innocent fellowship or corrosive leveler?) is less a problem with theater than with the body, the metaphor used to defend order. Commonwealth can be, on the one hand, a fairly staid image of corporate welfare. But on the other, of course, it can connote a shared public space of universal welfare potentially contradictory to order and degree. Even though hardly an actual social possibility, the connotation was, not surpris- ingly, one that contemporary theorists wished to eradicate. Writing in 1606, 31 "Answer of the Corporation of London" to the "Petition of the Queen's Players to the Privy Council," November 1584, reprinted in Chambers, 4:299-302, esp. 300. 32 Elizabethans suspected that plague was communicable through the air and by means of physical contact, but also that frequenting theaters could occasion plague for moral rather than physical vulnerabilities, interpreting plague as an instrument of divine vengeance for play- going. "To play in plagetime is to encreasce the plage by infection: to play out of plagetime is to draw the plage by offendinges of God vpon occasion of such playes" ("Answer of the Corporation of London," Chambers, 4:301). It should, however, be observed that while the physiological explanation of plague was invoked to censure theaters, other sites of congrega- tion, such as churches, escaped like censure.

Alv.</page><page sequence="10">42 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY Edward Forset punctiliously curtails the utopian promise of "common weale" by collating the image with another that denies the possibility of a society without distinctions: It is not therefore called a Commonwealth, that all the wealth should be common; but because the whole wealth, wit, power, and goodnesse whatsoeuer, of euery particular person, must be conferred and reduced to the common good: and that same sort and semblance, as the distinct members of the bodie, being ordained to different vses, do yet concurre in this consonance of inten- tion. . for the procuring and preseruing of the comfort and continuance of this one bodie.35 Forset limits the impulse toward a literal distribution of property among individuals and instead defines commonwealth as the collective well-being that results from the subordination of local interests. Whereas municipal authorities would compare social disorder to an unruly body, the "common good" emerges from a singular "consonance of intention." For, as Forset continues, "there must be a proportionablenesse and a kind of vnanimitie of the members, for the aiding and adorning of the publike comprehending all: so that foule daughter of darknesse and Chaos confused and all dis- turbing Anarchie, is to be exiled, or rather excluded out of this compaction of the bodie politique."36 This body thus excludes the possibility of a "horizontal" social community in favor of a "vertical" one, the assumption being, of course, that the "comfort and continuance of this one bodie" depends on the denial of wealth equally shared. A community imagined in terms of a body appeals because it is bounded, cohesive, and hierarchically organized: the image lends selfhood and a single intention to a political totality that is multifarious in desire.37 The image of a centralized "bodie politique," much like the etymologi- cally labile "common wealth," is invoked expressly because it contains this leveling potential. But it, too, possesses an inherent instability, an instability also phrased in terms of an excessive corporeality. For just as the possibility that "all the wealth should be common" threatens the status quo, so, too, does the possibility that the single intention of "vnanimitie" an intention personified by the monarch-will rule in conflict with the "comfort and continuance of this one bodie." Thus discussions of the body politic describe the image as constraining not only the desires of a common will-"carnal liberty, enormity, sin"-but also the potentially tyrannical power of the monarch, itself expressed as a disruptive private will.38 Forset phrases this 35 A Comparative Discovrse of the Bodies Natvral and Politique ...

For a survey</page><page sequence="11">HENRY V: THE PARADOX OF THE BODY POLITIC 43 control as the regulation of corporeality: "soueraignes through their natu- rall frailties, are subject as well to the imbecillitie of iudgement, as also to sensuall and irrationall mocions, rising out of the infectious mudd of flesh and bloud,... do at the making of Statutes ... drawing supplies out of their politicall bodie . .. make good what wanteth in their naturall."39 The image designed to stabilize and order an aggregate itself unfolds a potential source of (top-down) disorder in the social whole. In the political cosmology where a well-ruled body represents proper community, social disorder is a private, local, willful body-more body than politic. A well-ordered body should be a body only to a certain degree (so to speak). The metaphor employed to inscribe an orderly unity is itself in need of circumscription. Tyranny is conventionally imagined as antithetical to utopian commu- nity; yet, as constructed by Tudor-Stuart texts, they are similar insistences on private interest at the expense of corporate welfare. Both forms of social disorder-the literal common weal and the willful monarchic interest, the horizontal and vertical extremes of corporateness-collapse into unruly corporeality. "Carnal liberty" meets "the infectious mudd of flesh and bloud." A similar conflation occurs in the intersection of theater and its royal sponsorship. What in the royal defense of theater is presented as a coincidence of monarch-subject mutuality-the production of "loving sub- jects"-can only be imagined by municipal authorities as the product of a tyrannical "private appetite." Such imagination (or lack thereof) demon- strates the difficulty attendant on a monologic ideology of hierarchy in grasping the apparently paradoxical convergence of mutuality and alle- giance. The reductive description of the extremes of social totality as corporeality suggests that, as an image of the simultaneity and compatibility of diverse interests, the Tudor-Stuart ideal of corporate identity was, while integrative, yet precariously balanced.40 The convergence of monarchic interest with mutuality in the dispute over theater-the invocation of royal appetite as a trope of common fellowship- raises a related issue fundamental to the conduct of patriotic feeling: what distinguishes a comprehensive hegemonic allegiance from horizontal com- munion? As Forset's language reveals, the boundary between duty and pleasure is tenuous. A common obligation may unite a social body: "this strong vnion . .. instructeth all true subjects of any countrie to . .. the firmest adherence against all opposing enmities ... remembring that a common daunger alike distresseth the lesse as the greatest." He is yet at pains to warn that a common duty should not be interpreted as producing any equality of persons-"but especially, to bee tenderly affected in the losse or harme likely to befall their choicest statesmen of the best account and and bibliography of anthropological literature dealing with the metaphor of the body, see Jean Comoroff, "Bodily Reform as Historical Practice: The Semantics of Resistance in Modern South Africa," InternationalJournal of Psychology 20 (1985): 541-67. 39 Forset, 16. It was this vocabulary that provided James I with the terms for a threat to a stubborn Parliament: "I looked for no such Fruits at your Hands.... I am a Man of Flesh and Blood, and have my Passions and Affections as other Men: I pray you, do not too far move me to do that which my Power may tempt me unto" (Journals of the House of Commons [London, 1803- ], 2 May 1607, 1:367-68. Ironically, the dispute in question concerned the union of Great Britain. 40 Even the order-mongering Homily of Obedience affirmed to different degrees that "everyone hath need of other."</page><page sequence="12">44 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY qualitie, against whom the enemies of the state doe chiefly bend their malignant intentions."4' If the common pleasure of the theater can elide categories of order and degree, so might a political identity based in collective loyalty, not to mention a theater that produces the affect of a common political identity. I don't mean to imply that the experience of theatergoing (or the experience of the nation) is in any way uniform or homogeneous among its participants; "gentles all" is (in both instances) always ever a fantasy. Nor do I infer that the congregating of play-viewers necessarily results in a feeling of social unity (it might well do the opposite). I would like to suggest, however, that the convergence of tyranny and fellowship exhibited in the terminology of personification-"solace," "de- light," "private appetite," "pleasure"-perhaps reveals why hierarchical societies, despite exhortations to uniformity of allegiance among their citizenry, in fact depend for their survival on differential distributions of loyalty. Or, to imagine the problem differently, this convergence explains why order is best maintained not by comprehensive compliance with the law but by its transgression. As London's aldermen perennially realized, royal sponsorship of the theater was threatening hierarchy precisely in its prom- ise of a common allegiance. It is with the dual valence of the monarch's body in mind that I would like to turn to a reading of Henry V's personhood. Critical conventions usually demand at this point (if not well before) a reading of the play which puts such "backgrounds" to work and, if only proportionally, reestablishes the sovereignty of the literary text. Ideally such a reading would preface itself (having skirted temptations offered by coincidence and innuendo) with an explanation of its correlative mecha- nism, setting out the nature of the links to be forged between discourses of contexts and literary texts. With Henry V the problem of such parallel discourses is unusually difficult to finesse, given that, in the Chorus to Act 5, the play itself insists on the act of correspondence between play and culture. "As by a lower but by loving likelihood," Essex is allied, through comparison, with Henry V. As the phrase reveals, such contextual figura- tions are not simply mimetic or fully identical but exist in some partial and tendentious relationship to each other. In the spirit of "lower but loving," I would like then to suggest the congruences and contradictions of a common language, in which Shakespeare's play joins the lexicon of monarchic corporeality to explore the paradox of a space of selflessness imagined as a person. Perhaps the most evident personification of the coincidence of hegemony and collectivity is that of "Britain" constructed in the four persons of Captains Fluellen, Gower, Jamy, and Macmorris. The four parts of Britain have unified in a fight against the greater evil of France; individual wills and Britain's traditional regional feuding are subsumed to greater purpose within a fantasy of national (male) bondedness; however, as Jonathan Dollimore and Alan Sinfield put it, "the Irish, Welsh and Scottish soldiers manifest not their countries' centrifugal relationship to England but an 41 Forset, 49.</page><page sequence="13">HENRY V: THE PARADOX OF THE BODY POLITIC 45 ideal subservience of margin to centre."42 Despite the unanimity, a pecking order remains.43 Caricature functions to isolate Macmorris, but in Fluellen's leek-wearing it serves to assimilate cultural chauvinism to the totality of Britain via tolerance for a bit of quaintness. Although Fluellen is "a little out of fashion" (4.1.84), 44 as Henry puts it, he clearly ranks as the favored subcultural exponent, with an authority both guaranteed and subordinated by ethnic kinship to Henry himself. "I am Welsh, you know, good coun- tryman," Henry tells Fluellen, who replies, "All the water in Wye cannot wash Your Majesty's Welsh blood out of your body, I can tell you that" (4.7.104-7). Henry's blood secures his corporeal link to his subjects, his intransigently common body, as it were. But if Henry's blood is Welsh, it is also blue. Henry offers both the most powerful fantasy of collectivity in the play and the most hierarchical denial of common will. Like the salutation of the Chorus-"gentles all"-the rousing speech before Agincourt explicitly suspends social distinctions in a fantasy of familial harmony: "We few, we happy few, we band of broth- ers. / For he today that sheds his blood with me / Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile, / This day shall gentle his condition" (4.3.60-63).45 Yet, as if to check the leveling potential of this erasure of social hierarchy, Henry's closing words on the battlefield displace the promised kinship with a hierarchical ordering: "Where is the number of our English dead? / Ed- ward the Duke of York, the Earl of Suffolk, / Sir Richard Keighley, Davy Gam, esquire; / None else of name, and of all other men / But five-and- twenty" (4.8.102-6). By naming them in rank order-unless they have no "name -this enumeration of the dead reinscribes social divisions, the link between blood and power. Blood and power were, of course, linked within the hierarchical entity of the Elizabethan family, which organized power according to gender and priority of birth. Henry, too, links blood and power in his rallying cry before the gates of Harfleur, when he urges the transformation of body into an instrument of war: Stiffen the sinews, conjure up the blood, Then lend the eye a terrible aspect: Let it pry through the portage of the head Like the brass cannon.... (3.1.7-1 1) At the same time, Henry punctiliously insists on differences among his "dear friends," between "you noblest English, / Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof' (3.1.17-18), and "you, good yeomen, . . . Let us 42 See Drakakis, ed., 217. They also make the instructive observation that "the play's obsessive preoccupation is insurrection" (216). 43 As the work of Brian P. Levack on the British union demonstrates, such unity would soon be a highly contested construct; see The Formation of the British State: England, Scotland, and the Union, 1603-1707 (Oxford, 1989). 44 Shakespeare quotations are from The Complete Works of Shakespeare, ed. David Bevington, 4th ed.

For there is none of you so mean and base / That hath not noble luster in your eyes" (11. 25-30). The play is as vigilant in limiting the scope of common feeling as it is in encouraging it. Henry's body becomes the chief site of this contest. It is precisely the corporeality of the monarchic body that is resisted as the trope is turned into a metaphysics of power. "[H]aving given [him]self over to barbarous license" in the past, he has, on becoming king, "whipped th' offending Adam out of him, / Leaving his body as a paradise" (1.1.30-31). In Henry's transformation into the head of the unitary body politic (Forset's "consonance of intention"), "Hydra-headed willfulness . . . soon did lose his seat" (11. 36-37). Instead of a personable prince, Henry is a collective symbol that denies what he did affect: "His companies unlettered, rude, and shallow, . . . And never noted in him any study, / Any retirement, any sequestration / From open haunts and popularity" (11. 56-60). In the course of the play, all evidence of his former "addiction" (1. 54) either dies, is executed, or, like Pistol, "steals" away (5.1.86). The king who moments before advocated an orgiastic plundering of Harfleur justifies Bardolph's "cutting off' for the theft of a pax by invoking a modulated conquest: "we give express charge that, in our marches through the country, there be nothing. . . taken but paid for, none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful language; for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the gentler gamester is the soonest winner" (3.6.107-13). Thus to "gentle" is both to erase social division and to reinstate it by turning conquest into a "noble" sport. The purification of the body is, of course, nowhere more evident than in the death of Falstaff. Excessive, voracious in its appetites, Falstaff's corpo- reality appears only in its absence from the play. Henry's "right wits" and ''good judgments" replace "the fat knight with the great-belly doublet" (4.7.46-47) at the heart of the body politic. Falstaff's death would seem to prove the coercive rather than communal nature of Henry's personification of the body politic: "the King has killed his heart" (2.1.88). Hostess Quickly's report of Falstaff's demise makes clear the death of corporeality and of the disorder corporeality breeds: "So 'a bade me lay more clothes on his feet. I put my hand into the bed and felt them, and they were as cold as any stone; then I felt to his knees, and so upward and upward, and all was as cold as any stone"(2.3.22-25). The cold of Falstaffs genitals tempers the bawdy of this statement, and nostalgia replaces the carnivalesque that Falstaff had embodied. Unassimilable to a geographic typology, Falstaffs boundless body is less a place than a time-as Orson Welles puts it, "Falstaff is a man defending a force-the old England-which is going down.... the death of Merrie England.... the age of chivalry, of simplicity, of Maytime and all that."46 Libidinal energy and the body are exiled to the margins as the play constructs community in the exclusive image of state power. Falstaff dies offstage. The preceding account recapitulates conventional response to the second tetralogy, which typically narrates a transformation in the character of Henry, from a personable prince (who can "drink with any tinker in his own 46 See Chimes at Midnight, ed. Bridget Gellert Lyons (New Brunswick, NJ, 1988), 261-62.</page><page sequence="15">HENRY V: THE PARADOX OF THE BODY POLITIC 47 language") to an unfeeling embodiment of state power, and a concomitant affective shift from fellowship to estrangement. However, analysis of Henry V also reveals that the opposition between hegemony and mutuality, be- tween power and personhood, is unstable, even anachronistic. For, from his father's vantage point, Hal-"young wanton and effeminate boy" (Richard II, 5.3.1 0)-cultivates his tavern-founded fellowship in an act of personal willfulness at the expense of corporate welfare. As Bardolph's transgression reveals, rousing exhibitions of state power have the capacity to break rank: "What rein can hold licentious wickedness / When down the hill he holds his fierce career?" (3.3.22-23). More tellingly, Sir John Falstaff, if usually described as an embodiment of carnivalesque subversion, also represents an excess of aristocratic prerogative. Necessity as well as nostalgia attend his passing. Tyranny and fellowship are compounded in each instance. Their conjunction suggests that hegemony is not antithetical to collectivity but constitutive of it. Indeed it is arguable that the monarch's less "personable" qualities, his denial of a common body, only serve to idealize the bonds of allegiance. For instance, in response to Sir Thomas Erpingham's willing embrace of a shared physical discomfort-"This lodging likes me bet- ter, / Since I may say, 'Now lie I like a king'" (4.1.16-17)-Henry concurs with an apocalyptic description of how the denial of physical presence leads to a reincarnation of sorts: "Tis good for men to love their present pains . . . so the spirit is eased. / And when the mind is quickened, out of doubt / The organs, though defunct and dead before, / Break up their drowsy grave and newly move" (11. 18-22). Similarly, Falstaff's death in- vokes the eros of sacrifice: we relinquish him as a condition of our willing- ness to suffer loss for inclusion in the corporate good. A death for your country-the exchange of body for state, of private for public-is, after all, the supreme commerce of social belonging. The language of the monarch's body, with its punning conflation of both power and pleasure, is also present in the final scene. In his role as the fumbling lover, the king repudiates his private appetites by insisting on the sheerly powerful function of his person. He denies his ability to dance-"I have no measure in strength"-but affirms his prowess on the battlefield: "If I could win a lady at leapfrog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back, under correction of bragging be it spoken, I should quickly leap into a wife" (5.2.138-41). Unlike the model lover, Henry shuns his person, describing himself as one "whose face is not worth sunburning, that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there" (11.148-50). His claims to Katharine's affection are based on the corporeality of power alone: "my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost [love me], notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage" (11. 223-25). Even at the moment of his conception, he argues, coercion upstaged communion: "Now beshrew my father's ambition! He was thinking of wars when he got me; therefore was I created with a stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, when I come to woo ladies, I fright them" (11. 226-29). However, if Henry's "blood" reassures him of Katharine's favor (and she is, we must remember, a spoil of war), the affective power of a common body, with its shared vulnerability, is also on his side: "A good leg will fall, a straight back will stoop, a black beard will turn white, a curled pate will grow bald, a fair face will wither.... But in faith, Kate, the elder I wax, the</page><page sequence="16">48 SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY better I shall appear. My comfort is that old age, that ill layer-up of beauty, can do no more spoil upon my face" (11. 160-63; 229-32). He ends on a typically punning conjunction of tyranny and mutuality: take me by the hand, and say, "Harry of England, I am thine." Which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud, "England is thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry Plantagenet is thine"-who, though I speak it before his face, if he be not fellow with the best king, thou shalt find the best king of good fellows. (11. 237-44) In this oddly theatrical, disembodied moment-"though I speak it before his face"-Henry resuscitates his claim to fellow feeling. As with most demonstrations of disingenuity, the effect is at once repellent and appeal- ing. In the symbolic economy where tyranny and fellowship are alike corporeal, denial of one-in this case, the body of pleasure, or of affective union-is at once a denial of the other-the body of tyrannic coercion. For all of its claims to convergent meanings, the notion of a common language must, in all honesty, acknowledge lapses in convergence; some likelihoods, are, so to speak, lower than others. Any argument for the participation of Shakespeare's play in the Elizabethan language of royal personhood must acknowledge the most glaring instance in which the representation of power in the play differs from its representation in the culture: namely, in the fact of gender difference. In other words, what and how does it matter that the monarch of the history play is male while the then monarch of the Elizabethan state was not? Does the play's represen- tation of a tyrannical appetite as male divertingly idealize Elizabethan monarchy? Does its imagination of monarch-subject mutuality as male alliance suppress cultural anxieties about a female monarch? In materialist criticism similar questions about contradictions between play and world have produced an evolution in the vocabulary that describes their interplay, a process in which the older language of text-context reflectionism has been replaced by the more sophisticated terms of subver- sion and containment, mystification and mask. Yet oddly, while we have complicated our notions of aesthetic practice and have even affirmed the textuality of all ideological production, we have yet to apply a similar pressure to the state, except occasionally to point out its internal contradic- tions. These contradictions function then as signs of ideological incoher- ence that the state presumably would, if it could, stamp out. In arguing to the contrary that the play's representation of the paradox of monarchic personhood shares in the labile terms of Tudor-Stuart ideology generally, I am arguing in some sense for a return to a kind of reflectionism. I would urge the rehabilitation of ideology as the enabling medium of collectivity as well as that which "legitimate[s] inequality and exploitation by representing the social order which perpetuates these things as immutable and unalter- able."47 In other words, I would suggest we might imagine that among the state's interests, the production of an integrated and beneficient social unity is as authentic as any other. 47 Dollimore and Sinfield in Drakakis, ed., 212.</page><page sequence="17">HENRY V: THE PARADOX OF THE BODY POLITIC 49 Among the results of our perceived antagonism between fellow feeling and hegemony has been its inability to account for the emotional power of the play's ending, in which the consummation of state interest is attended with all affections of charismatic fellowship. Perhaps the most potent fantasy of unity and, simultaneously, the most violent purification of the body from the body politic are proposed in the unification of England and France through the union of Henry and Katharine: "the paction of these king- doms," as the Queen of France puts it, in "the bed of blessed marriage" (5.2.363-64). In order more fully to evaluate the play's closing gesture toward a powerful and pleasurable fellowship, as well as the contradiction between play and world, I would like to return to the discourse of monar- chic pleasure and its relations to gender. Where does pleasure reside in the body politic? This question is mostly avoided by contemporary descriptions of the figure. While internal organs are given their legislative function, the limbs a juridical purpose, the mind or soul the chief office, the analogy of function is never pushed to its limits, its margins, its orifices. Forset allows that a monarch should have some fun: There is nothing that is either more gracefull for seemelinesse of shew, or more auaileable to any man for his health, than to haue alwayes a light and chearfull heart: and it was yet neuer seene that any part of the body euer grudged at or repugned, but rather willingly furthered the well-pleasing delights of the heart. From hence good people will learne this well-resembling inference, That the recreating sports and pleasures of Soueraignes (in whom is the heartbloud of the ciuill bodie) be not dislikingly crossed or repyned at, but rather entertain- ingly allowed, and comfortably affoorded vnto them.48 If the monarch-as-heart seems an innocent locus of "light and chearfull" pleasure, the heart's morphology confirms the uncontroversial nature of recreation, for, as Forset continues, The figure of the hart is shaped sharpe poynted at the lower end, and vpward it is more widely spread abroad: To this forme the best princes doe conforme, they open their hearts with a full spread towards vertue, goodnesse, and heauenly things, but do make narrow and close the same against all base appetites of this vnhallowed flesh.49 Forset is writing in 1606 for a male monarch for whom, as Leeds Barroll reminds us, "hunting, not plays, was the approved solace,"50 and whose hips were ideally narrower than his shoulders. Elizabeth's "full spread," how- ever, was downward, as the Ditchley portrait makes clear: she held all of England in her skirts. Some Elizabethans were more wary of princely pleasure. Hence Thomas Floyd, writing "Of pleasures and Delight" in his Picture of a perfit Common wealth, decrees that when properly executing their duty, governours ... are always to be emploied in matters of great consequence, whereof the charge is such, that if they discharge their duty, they shall hardly 48 Forset, 31-32. 49 Forset, 30. 50 "A New History for Shakespeare and His Time," SQ 39 (1988): 441-64, esp. 461.

He expresses an opinion probably dear to London authorities, who, short of foreclosing monarchic pleasure, tried to limit it, and to isolate it from the common weal. The lord mayor writes in 1592 to the archbishop of Canterbury to request-"bycause wee vnderstand that the Q. Maiestie is &amp; must bee served at certen times by this sort of people [i.e., actors]"-that "if by any means it may bee devised that hir Maiestie may bee served with these recreations ... by the privat exercise of hir Maiesties own players in convenient place."52 These words at once acknowledge the appetitive origin of theater ("must bee served") and urge that that appetite be privatized. Theater: "well-pleasing delights of the heart" or "base appetites of this vnhallowed flesh"? The answer may well depend on the gender of the desirer in question. Anthony Munday's lurid (and possibly parodic) instance of antitheatrical discourse underscores the link between the effects of theater and a specifically female corporeality. A second and third Blast of retrait from plaies and Theaters locates the pernicious effects of playing and the "force ... [of] their inchantments of pleasure" specifically in the bodies of women: they haue receiued at those spectacles such filthie infections, as haue turned their minds from chast cogitations, and made them of honest women light huswiues; by them they haue dishonored the vessels of holines; and brought their husbandes into contempt, their children into question, their bodies into sicknes, and their soules to the state of euerlasting damnation.53 Here the subversive effect of plays is linked to the sexual appetites of women, always potentially wayward and threatening to exceed the legal and physical boundaries of home and hearth. As female bodies are the vehicles of uncorrupted inheritance, their control provides the cornerstone of patriarchal order and the property it guards. Certain plays erode both the boundaries that contain female sexual appetites and the material property that their chastity is designed to consolidate and keep within the family. "Credite me," urges Munday, there can be found no stronger engine to batter the honestie as wel of wedded wiues, as the chastitie of vnmarried maides and widowes, than are the hearing 51 Floyd, sig. M5r. Floyd has a low opinion of pleasures generally, especially those "which are superfluous &amp; vnprofitable ... spending their time about nothing.... Moreouer there are other plasures which are lewd, &amp; are termed by the name of carnall &amp; worldly plea- sures.... Conceale thy delights in thy heart, lest shamefully they be discouered. Delight is the brook of euils, quenching the light of the soule, &amp; hindering counsell, turning men aside from the right way" (sigs. M4v-M7r). 52 "The Lord Mayor to John Whitgift," 25 February 1592, reprinted in Chambers, 4:308. 53 Hazlitt, ed., 142 and 125, respectively. Significantly, Munday signs himself with a com- pound term of nation and affect: "Anglophile." Although the particular susceptibility of the female body figured as a trope for the sexual license the theater provoked-married women were frequently singled out as the group most in need of being prevented from going to the theater-men were also targeted as vulnerable, and the theater was thought to be a site for prostitution (see Chambers, 4:198, 203, 218, and 223). For a discussion of the relationship of the theater and the categories of gender, see Jean E. Howard, "Crossdressing, The Theatre, and Gender Struggle in Early Modern England," SQ 39 (1988): 418-40.</page><page sequence="19">HENRY V: THE PARADOX OF THE BODY POLITIC 51 of common plaies. There wanton wiues fables, and pastorical songes of loue, which they use in their comical discourses (al which are taken out of the secret armorie of Venus, &amp; practicing bawderie) turne al chastitie vpside downe, . . . insomuch that it is a miracle, if there be found anie either woman, or maide, which with these spectacles of strange lust, is not oftentimes inflamed even vnto furie. "Inflamed" by plays, female desire is both source and metaphor of civil disorder. In particular, representations of the trajectories of libidinal de- sire-"wanton wiues fables, and pastorical songes of loue"-urge unruly union at the expense of order; this is not corporateness but corporeality. Theater, itself the product of a female (monarch's) appetite, represents and elicits a form of feeling that threatens the nucleus of social order, producing a behavior "common" in its sexual and material effects. For where lies the security of property if not in female chastity? The feminized terminology of political disorder is not unique to an antitheatrical location. Recall, for instance, that Forset imagines order's an- tithesis as a "foule daughter of darkenesse." The traditionally gendered binary of passion and reason associates women with appetite, and, so constructed, women are more susceptible to the corporeality solicited and produced by affect. Richard Hooker, for instance, identifies female affective penetrability in another domain as the susceptible target of religious radi- cals' infiltrations: [M]ost labor hath been bestowed to win and retain towards this cause them whosejudgements are commonly weakest by reason of their sex.... Apter they are through the eagerness of their affection, that maketh them which way soever they take, diligent in drawing their husbands, children, servants, friends and allies the same way; apter through that natural inclination unto pity which breedeth in them a greater readiness than in men, to be bountiful towards their Preachers who suffer want ... finally, apter through a singular delight which they take in giving very large and particular intelligence how all near about them stand affected as concerning the same cause.55 Given their domestic location-as mothers, lovers, and gossips-women are the first line of defense against the seductions of zeal, "diligent in drawing" others along with them. Such a combination of centrality and vulnerability also provoked the cautionary tones of domestic conduct books. Whether recommending the choice of a wife, or suggesting methods for securing the consciences of children and servants, such texts recommend that the patriarch police the boundaries and purify the interior. As Henry Smith's Preparative to Marriage recomme nds, "he which chuseth of [women], had neede . . . make an Anatomie of their bodies and mindes by squire and rule, before he say, This shall be mine.... [S]o our Spouse should bee holy, vndefiled, and faire within."56 Elizabeth's "solace," then, both originates in and strikes at female appetites, strikes at the foundation of the consolidation of property and order that is England. 54 Hazlitt, ed., 143. 55 Of The Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity (1592), ed.

As critics have noted, Elizabeth's body was the compass and synecdo- che of England's ideological insularity and coherence; her physical self and physical boundaries-namely, her much-touted virginity-was the guaran- tor of English ideological purity.57 This dependence of the body politic on the body natural emerges most clearly in the objections to the marriage negotiations with Alencon in 1580. In A Gaping Gvlf, John Stubbs warned that the threat to English insularity was "the old serpent in the shape of a man, whose sting is in his mouth, and who doth endeavor to seduce our Eve, that she and we may lose this English paradise."58 Sir Philip Sidney likewise warns against the ardent Frenchman who would "[thrust] him self into the low countrey matters, he somtime seeking the king of Spaine daughter somtime your Majesty... "5 Sidney's pun registers the particular associa- tion of English ideological integrity with Elizabeth's physical inviolability. Both of these Protestant writers imagine Elizabeth's alliance through mar- riage with an international elite to be in conflict with English religious insularity; they thus cast her marriage as the double loss of chastity and cultural purity. (These terms of isolationism and insularity are ones we have come to associate with nationalist propaganda or with the "othering" of cultural difference.) In 1588 one writer generalizes this gendered vulner- ability, applying it to a national context and urging militant self-defense in order to avoid seeing "our Countrie ruinated, our Souereigne Princesse iniured, our wiues and virgins defiled, our infants tost on pikes, and our goods the greedie Spaniardes spoyle."60 This equation of geography and the body, of the security of territorial boundaries and female boundaries, necessarily envisions boundary alterations as the result of phallic aggres- sion. Thus in 1593 we find Elizabeth excusing England's insularity-her failure "to advance My Territories, and enlarge my Dominions" -as a corollary of her gender: "I acknowledge my Womanhood and Weakness in that Respect.' Whether passive or inviolable, Elizabeth's gendered phys- ical identity is less the token of a transient "natural" body than the bulwark of England's ideological integrity. Virginity literalizes insularity.

As the 1547 date of the Homily of Obedience makes clear, the associations of social regulation with corporal regulation are the inheritance rather than the invention of Elizabethan political discourse. By the 1590s it was not Elizabeth's virginity but her mortality on which English ideological intact- ness depended, and it was her successor, not her husband, who was the forbidden subject of public speculation. Yet the language of political integ- rity persists. Patriarchy's subordination of women is often the chief symp- tom of internal hierarchy as well as of cultural insularity-hence our common term for both: chauvinism. Thus both the internal threat to hegemony (that adulterous leveling erosion of the boundaries of private property) and the external threat (invasion, miscegenation, from without) are imagined pejoratively as loss of chastity via adultery or rape. But what is the relevance to Henry V of these associations of political corruption with female corporeality? Does the play end pleasurably, with an image of compatible cultural difference and a promise of internal commu- nity; or does the betrothal between the factions of an international political elite reinforce hegemonic difference? Are indeed the two distinct? Ques- tions about whether the ending of the play emphasizes pleasure or power are to a great extent related to those often applied to its formal category. Henry V has elicited a good deal of criticism that tries to isolate its governing genre. Negotiating the play's generic multiplicity and uncertain ideological valence alike, criticism has tried to impose formal coherence on what has been described variously as a history, a comical history, an epic, a romance, even a pastoral.62 The most successful grounds for such taxonomy have been located in the play's resemblance, in its resolution, to romantic com- edy: its representation of a marriage that secures the integrity of the English state. Comedy is, formally, a conservative genre, usually predictable in its assignment of moral rewards. If female characters, for instance, are allowed articulate reign within the body of the Shakespearean comedy, it is only to be finally domesticated in marriage.63 History plays, on the other hand, are held up by defenders of the theater as productive of ideological stability: what, asks Thomas Nashe, "can be a sharper reproofe to these dangerous effeminate days of ours?" But they are notoriously indeterminate in their formal identity.64 Thus it is significant that the aspect of comic form that Henry V appropriates is in fact closure: marriage. If the chastity of the female body is vulnerable to the invasion of plays, and the chastity of the Elizabe- than state vulnerable alike to external invasion and common pleasure, it is perhaps appropriate that Henry V closes with containment of the "effemi- nate." 62 See, for example, essays of Altieri, Barton, and Dean, cited above; see also Tennenhouse, 68-71. 63 For a discussion of the relative limits that certain genres impose on female energies, see Carol Thomas Neely, Broken Nuptials in Shakespeare's Plays (New Haven, 1985). 64 Pierce Penniless his Supplication to the Devil, reprinted in The Renaissance in England, ed.

The conversion of the politics of domination into a poetics of desire-of conquest into communion-is an awkward one. Henry's vacillation between the languages of power and of pleasure betrays the incongruity of configuring violence as romance. "I love thee cruelly," he tells Katharine, as sex gives way to power (5.2.203). The mutuality represented here is inherently dual; unity is suggested but in decidedly hierarchical terms, as the insistent pressure of gender politics qualifies the utopian movement of comedy. The configuration of Katharine as an object of desire further circum- scribes the romantic tenor of the scene. Less an affective than a political gain, she is "our capital demand, comprised / Within the fore-rank of our articles" (5.2.96-97). The figuring of Katharine's inaccessibility not as erotic resistance but as linguistic disadvantage exposes the Petrarchan fantasy as a strategy of male manipulation. The woman's silence here is made quite literal: "I cannot speak your England" (11. 102-3). Most Shakespearean comedy is dominated by a verbal woman, but here an articulate man determines the terms of courtship-however much he might deny verbal facility: "I speak to thee plain soldier" (11. 150-51). The equation of woman and territory, with its insistence on the body-as- "politic," develops in the juxtaposition of scenes 3 and 4 of Act 3. Henry's opening battle cry has urged the "noblest English" to prove their mothers' chastity and aristocratic birth simultaneously: "Dishonor not your mothers; now attest / That those whom you called fathers did beget you" (3.1.17, 22-24). In 3.3, Henry threatens to invade Harfleur with a speech that returns obsessively to images of rape, of "the fleshed soldier ... mowing like grass / Your fresh fair virgins" (11. 11-14); "pure maidens [fallen] into the hand / Of hot and forcing violation" (11. 20-2 1). State power appears here as an excessive corporeality, and as Karen Newman observes, "the expansionist aims of the nation-state are worked out [in these notorious lines] on and through the woman's body."65 In the following scene Katharine learns English and performs an anatomy of her body, laying herself open to semantic invasion as her innocent English words are trans- formed into French sexual slang: "Le foot et le count! 0 Seigneur Dieu! Ils sont les mots de son mauvais, corruptible, gros, et impudique" (3.4.50- 52).66 Like most sexual joking, the linguistic play here occludes the violence of victimization: the pleasure of punning tempers the pressure of rape. If England's political integrity-her national chastity-is vulnerable as, and to, the female body, such fragility is here controlled by its representation as foreign. Tellingly, while Henry's body can be purified, the only English- 65 Newman, 101.

By means of the body of the French maid, Henry names himself "Heritier de France" (5.2.339). However, romantic comedy, we recall, is an "inflamer" of (female) desire and was singled out by antitheatrical Elizabethans as the genre most dis- ruptive of political harmony, in its potential production of unruly corporeal unity among its audiences. As Stephen Gosson put it, "when Comedie comes vpon the stage, Cupide sets vpp as Springe for Woodcockes."68 Such plays violate the boundaries of the platform stage and the body alike: "the gesturing of a plaier, which Tullie termeth the eloquence of the bod- ie ... prepare[s] a man to that which is il.... There cometh much euil in at the eares, but more at the eies, by these two open windowes death breaketh into the soule."69 And if plays threaten the body's orifices, they violate the state's as well: "vnchast fables, lascivious devises, shifts of cozenage . .. ar so framed &amp; represented by them, that such as resort to see &amp; hear the same, beeing of the base &amp; refuse sort of people ... draue the same into example of imitation &amp; not of avoyding the sayed lewd offences."70 If comedy is ostensibly conservative in its decorous assignment of moral rewards and marital partners, it is also, in utopian reconciliation of desires and satisfac- tions, nondeterminative. As antitheatrical opponents realized, affect ex- ceeds boundaries, and the ostensible messages of social control are not always sufficient to contain the disorder they conclude. Furthermore, if most comedies end with the promise of marriage, they do not often end with its accomplishment; their affect, as it is apocalyptic in structure, is also in feeling wholly anticipatory or open-ended. Henry may claim that love tempers his power interests, that he "cannot see many a fair French city for one fair French maid that stands in my way" (5.2.318-20). The King of France points out that the two are identical: "my lord, you see them perspectively, the cities turned into a maid; for they are all girdled with maiden walls that war hath never entered" (11. 321-23). Appropriately enough, her image through a perspectival illusion is double, complicit: Katharine is simultaneously an object of affection and of political interest. While she may recoil at the English perversion of the French terms for her body, the slang does allow Katharine a sexual voice, as her repetition of terms displays: "Foh! Le foot et le count! Neanmoins, je reciterai une autre fois ma lecon ensemble: d' hand, de fingre, de nailes, de arm, d' elbow, de nick, de sin, de foot, le count" (3.4.54-57). Katharine's titillating recita- tion is indeed a male-authored ventriloquist fantasy of female eroticism, but 67 Even though Pistol refers to her as "Doll," Bevington and other editors suggest this is a typographical error substituting for "Nell." 8 The Ephemerides of Phialo .. . and a short Apologie of the Schoole of Abuse (1579), reprinted in Chambers, 4:207.

In the following scene the Dauphin dreads just such an articulate female libidinousness: "Our mad- ams mock at us and plainly say ... they will give / Their bodies to the lust of English youth/ To new-store France with bastard warriors" (3.5.28-31). The final love scene reinscribes the violent confrontation of cultural differ- ence but in a gentler form. "Is it possible dat I sould love de ennemi of France?" (5.2.170-71), asks Katharine pointedly. "No, it is not possible you should love the enemy of France, Kate," responds Henry; "but in loving me you should love the friend of France, for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it. I will have it all mine. And, Kate, when France is mine and I am yours, then yours is France and you are mine" (11. 72-77). Henry's verbal confusion-of pronouns, of political and sexual desires, indeed, of territorial boundaries-forges an accommodation between power and affect, political possession and sexual possession, which accom- modates the body to hegemony and vice versa. The joke results not so much from linguistic disadvantage as from the beginnings of a common language: "thy speaking of my tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needs be granted to be much at one" (11. 191-93). Henry urges the combination of pleasure with power and gives the body a utility for the state: "I get thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldier- breeder. Shall not thou and I, between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a boy, half French, half English, that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?" (11. 205-10). The brute exercise of a sovereign will (albeit directed on an even more foreign territory) is reha- bilitated into an ideologically useful corporeality, the biological reproduc- tion of dynastic power. On the one hand, the play's closure offers an image of the alliance of an international aristocracy secured through the exoga- mous exchange of a woman. On the other, it offers an image of the apocalyptic eventuality of a mutual alliance in which difference, whether of culture or gender, is collaborative rather than coercive, suspended rather than suspect. It is no coincidence that the terms of the debate about the status of early modern representations of Protestant marriage (egalitarian or hierarchic) are the same as those that have governed consideration of its political formations.71 Both debates concern the potential accommodation of differ- ence, whether of gender or status, within a social totality. Yet to concede the victory of a hegemonic organization of such difference is to relinquish the promise and pressure of an alternative ideal. Our tendency to segregate (often chronologically) power and fellowship denies not only the extent to which ostensibly democratic state formations are hegemonically inflected but also the extent to which community takes place in and through institu- tions, rather than in some sentimentalized locus amoenus beyond power's reach. The ambivalence that characterizes Henry V is an ambivalence fun- damental not to his personality but to a fantasy of social union which employs the tropes of personhood as a means to its realization. Henry V might have pleasure serve the body politic. But Elizabeth herself, as tradi- tion has it, requested that Falstaff be resuscitated, excerpted, and in love. 71 See, for instance, William and Malleville Haller, "The Puritan Art of Love," Huntington Library Quarterly 5 (1942): 235-72; and Linda T.
