<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DEVIL'S GLASS GERALD WEALES When Charles Morgan's The Bturning Glass opened and closed with such rapid- ity on Broadway in the spring of 1954, W. A. Darlington, writing in his "Lon- don Letter" column in the New York Times (April 11, 1954), commenting on the contrast between the shortness of the New York run and the apparent English success, said, "Its technical shortcomings did not go unnoticed by the London critics but Mr. Morgan has a large public here which cares too much for what he has to say and the way in which he says it to be put off by faulty stagecraft . . ." The short- comings of which he speaks are many and are crippling, but the ideas of the play, particularly in so far as they are symptomatic of a strong current of thought at this time, do demand atten- tion. Morgan is one of a group of English writers, in and out of the the- atre, who are concerned with the spir- itual state of man and the survival of that spirit in the face of a mass preoc- cupation with things scientific and ma- terial; their distrust of science extends beyond the understandably wide-spread fear of radiation and beyond the in- Gerald Weales is a mzember of the English staff at the University of Pennsylvania. The present article wtas written before the recent death of Charles Morgan; since Morgan's ideas and their relationship to the community of thought de- scribed in the article have not been altered by the author's death, the article has been printed in its original form. tellectual distaste for gadgetry which has become the basis for the popular parlor game-bait the Americans-in Europe, in Asia and in some circles in our own country. Morgan's concern is a religious one; God and, more impor- tant, the Devil are active participants in his thought and his play, although they have no place in the cast list. The problem of the play is whether or not Christopher Terriford is justified -no that is not strong enough, is right or wrvong-in his decision not to give England the secret of the burning glass, a secret that holds a great potential for destruction and an equally strong pos- sibility for eventual material good to mankind. The secret is a particular set- ting on a WVeather Control machine, which will allow Terriford waves, waves (liscovered by Christopher's father which, unlike radio waves, pierce the ionosphere instead of reflect from it, to polarize the ionosphere in such a way that the sun's rays can be let through, can be manipulated and focused as by a gigantic lense. Mr. Morgan's message, which lies in Christopher's (lecision to allow wartime, but not peacetime use of his secret, is presented on stage through discussions between Christopher and his wife Mary, who represents the warmth and solidity of genuine faith, who is as aware of God and the Devil and her relationship to each of them, as she is</page><page sequence="2">312 of the furnishings of the very comfort- able South Room of Terriford House, where all the action of the play takes place; through an informal debate be- tween Christopher and the Prime Min- ister, Montagu Winthrop, who repre- sents the now outdated belief that prog- ress and knowledge are necessary con- comitants and that there is an inevitabil- ity about the first of them; and a sharp exchange between Mary and Lord Henry Strait, the Prime Minister's secretary, who represents the pettiness and bit- terness of unthinking power. These three decisive scenes are almost lost in a heavily melodramatic plot, replete with theatrical cliches and bro- midic characters. Christopher is spirited off to Russia by Tamas Hardlip, a stock suave villain in the tradition of Teck de Brancovis in Watch on the Rhine, and Mary has to decide whether or not to reveal her husband's secret setting. She stands by his original decision, but she and Christopher's cynical assistant Tony Lack (an idealist gone bad in the war) manipulate the machine to burn warn- ing patches on the Russian countryside and thus get Christopher back. Tony, whose loose tongue first let Hardlip know that there was a burning glass, now knows the setting and, in the best empire tradition, goes jokingly to su- icide to save the Terrifords' powerful secret from his own weakness. Buried in this unsuccessful amalgam of science fiction, melodrama and moral- ity play lies Morgan's case against sci- ence, his plea for ignorance under specific circumstances. MI organ's argument is not limited to the play itself; he prefaces the published edition of it with a long essay, "On Power Over Nature," in which he takes Christopher's view toward much more than the fictional burning glass; in which, too, he gives Christopher and Mary real existences, EDUCATIONAL THEATRE JOURNAL lets them talk and make decisions. Al- though their pre- and post-curtain lives have no validity in regard to their stage personalities, just as Liza Doolittle has no relation to the discussion of her post-play life that Shaw added to the published Pygmalion, they do have rel- evance to the development of Morgan's ideas. Christopher has decided, before the curtain goes up on the first act, that he will not allow the secret of the burn- ing glass to be used for the supposed welfare of minkind. His premise, which Mary defends in her exchange with Lord Henry, is that man in search for knowledge and power has in fact lost the real power which lies in his faith, has fallen victim to a design of the Devil. Let us examine the relevant scenes in the play. The first, the con- versation between Mary and Chris- topher, assigns more-than-human sig- nificance to both Christopher's decisions and the glass itself; the latter becomes plainly demonic (". . . an infinite sup- ply of pure heat, spilling out from heaven just because my puny hands turn on the tap. ... Or spilling out of hell . . .") and by implication (or ex- plicitly in Mary's description of prayer as a kind of listening) the decision comes from heaven. It develops that the knowl- edge must be withheld to protect the simplicity of the Terrifords' life to- gether ("Our private peace was some- thing we didn't know we had to defend. Now we have to."), which by extension embodies all of the spiritual values of human existence, all of life that is in opposition to the acquisitiveness and meaningless comfort of a too materialis- tic world. All of these qualities are sym- bolically on stage in the form of the chess board which sits downstage always in the spectator's eye, often referred to in the dialogue; on the board a game between Mary and Christopher is under-</page><page sequence="3">THE DEVIL'S GLASS way, the continuity of the kind of life they believe in. At the end of Act I the board is upset by Hardlip and the cur- tain comes down on Mary's determina- tion to get all the men back on the correct squares ("But I can! I can!"); with Act II there is a complete break in the game, Christopher's kidnaping; Act III ends as the game is resumed with the Prime Minister, now in agreement with Mary and Christopher about the glass and life, looking on. The only serious opposition to Chris- topher's position comes from the Prime Minister in Act II. The character of Lord Henry-his pettiness, his pom- posity, his apparent distaste for every- thing around him-makes his Act III argument with Mary no real threat to Christopher's beliefs; Mary's triumph is expected-"Why are you, who have comfort and power, so bitter?" The di- vergent views can best be shown by the following short exchange: Prime Minister: . . . Do I understand that now, for the first time, science is withholding knowledge? Christopher: Now, for the first time, science is withholding power. Prime Minister: Is not that reaction? Christopher: No, sir, it is revolution. It is rev- olution against the drug that has been . . . swelling us. Prime Minister: Power over Nature is a godlike drug. Christopher: It happens that we aren't gods. Prime Minister: You are holding back the clock. Christopher: I am refusing to put it forward. To do either is to lie. This passage, one unfortunately in which the Prime Minister plays a little too effectively a straight man for the determined Christopher, does not, of course, settle the matter. The play finds no conclusion to the argument between these two points of view, perhaps be- cause-as Morgan admits in his essay -this kind of debate is not subject to final solution. The solution that the play does reach, however, is an unfair one; it is theatrical rather than intel- lectual. First of all, the debate is halted by Christopher's willingness, in the face of his recognition of the danger that all freedom faces from Communism, to allow the use of the secret as a weapon in case of emergency. This tem- porary decision gradually becomes a final one, for somewhere in the action of Christopher's kidnaping and his re- turn, the Prime Minister seems to have become convinced, although we never see the convincing, for he says at the end, "To see an evil power not exercised gives me even now a little hope for the future of the world . .." The ease of the Prime Minister's con- version, however, does not make the problems of Morgan's play that simple or that easily acceptable. His equation of the burning glass with evil, which in the essay that introduces the play be- comes an equating of scientific ad- vancement with demonic forces, deserves closer analysis. There is little value in (loubting Morgan's view here by doubt- ing the reality of Satan or the Satanic forces of which he talks, by falling back on a rational or a psychological explana- tion of these forces in which he believes. Obviously his belief would transcend any such explanation, would perhaps even accept it. He has already answered that argument by suggesting that ". . . it may be a part of that design to con- ceal itself from men by persuading them to abandon the anthropomorphic name which their forefathers used to intimate the principle." It is more important to question his reasoning when he inti- mates that the Devil had a hand in the accidental setting on Christopher's Weather Machine. He can only suggest that such is the case by letting the Christopher of the essay feel something "filthily unpleasant" when he makes 313</page><page sequence="4">314 the discovery, by underlying the whole of the business of the burning glass with a vague feeling of nether-worldliness. A satanic force that could use an intellec- tual dismissal of the concept of Satan would surely not be beyond the injec- tion of a feeling of doubt in the pres- ence of a genuine advancement of knowledge. The decision about the burning glass is Christopher's and Mary's, is a human one, and certainly has no priority on the heavenly stamp of approval, is as likely to be evil as the discovery itself. The importance of Morgan's position. however, extends far beyond Chris- topher Terriford and his science fic- tional burning glass. At the end of the play in an answer that Christopher makes to a question from the Prime Minister, Morgan places himself firmly in a new current of belief: Against the tide of modern thought? I wonder whether even that is as true as it was. Tides turn. The Wonders of Applied Science have become much less wonderful than they were. Only half-baked minds any longer worship that particular Golden Calf. Mlen of science them- selves do not. If that is all there is to Morgan's posi- tion, he is indeed moving with a large crowd. Few men believe any longer in the inevitability of progress; still fewer expect to find the salvation of mankind in the improvement of the mechanical world. The respect for the laboratory is not (lead, of course, but there is no longer the reverence that once existed. Even among unthinking men, the last to accept the nineteenth century faith in the primary importance of science, there is a suspicion of the latest prac- tical manifestations of that (liscipline, coupled usually with a desire for the latest commercial variants. It is true, too, that scientists no longer pretend to have all the answers to the problems of human existence, nor easy access to EDUCATIONAL THEATRE JOURNAL those answers. But the new humility in the laboratory is not quite the same as Morgan's distrust, does not take quite the same form. There is the low-level mockery of Anthony Standen's Science is a Sacred Cow which kids scientific attitudes without rejecting them. There is the serious opposition to specific proj- ects which must not be confused with a general opposition to the search for new knowledge and new powser; the now famous doubt of J. Robert Oppenheim- er in the face of the hydrogenl bomb did not make him want to disassociate hini- self from Princeton's Institute lor Ad- vanced Study, of w-hich hc is c(irector. Groups such as the Federation of Amer- ican Scientists have been forlmedl not to put a damper on scientific activity, but to give the scientist a voice in the social and political use of the new pow- ers which are obviously not intrinsically cure-alls. Christopher Terriford is cor- rect when he suggests that scientists doubt themselves a little, but certainly they declare no moratorium on research, on the search for knowledge and power. Morgan's position is not nearly so tempered as that speech of Christopher's might suggest. That which is plainly now no salvation has become, for him, a damnation. It is in the essay of intro- duction that we find a neater lresenta- tion of his certainty that the w(rtld has reached that stage of scientific advance- ment when it is beginning to touch areas of knowledge forbidden to man. I Under- lying this position is the belief that the desire to gain knowledge, the certainty that all knowledge is the stuff of prog- ress, is part of a demonic (lesign. There is talk of blasphemy, an invocation of the metaphors of Prometheus, Adam and Eve, Icarus, Faust. Speaking spe- cifically of rockets to Mars, by implica- tion of any scientific advancement, Mor- gan says, ". . . few ask whether it is</page><page sequence="5">THE DEVIL'S GLASS within the province of the human spirit, to undertake such a journey, to rape such powers." With such statements Morgan places himself-like Dorothy Sayers, who in her notes to her transla- tion of the Inferno seems to equate psy- chiatry with evil-against the extension of human knowledge. His use of the word rape makes impossible any sugges- tion that the particular powers have now given themselves freely, have suc- cumbed to the seducing blandishments of modern man, for the attempted se- duction would be as false as the rape. Morgan's search for spiritual values and for a new integrity and strength in man is not a lonely one, but his path seems to be leading him toward an espousal of ignorance. He hopes that ". .. there may may be a halt for many centuries in all but the minor developments of technol- ogy." It is possible that the reverse of the situation that Basil Willey describes in Sevtenteenth Century Background is now underway; Willey points out how the rise of scientific thought and depend- ence on it forced religion and poetry from the center stage of human thought, turne(l it into a formalism that had been shed of strength and imagination. WAil- ley lingers often on the values that were lost in that shift, more often than he (loes on the values gained, but if the return to religion that he recognizes in the early pages of his book reverses the procedure, if a new preeminence of spir- itual values demands the freezing of scientific knowledge, as though values of any kind could flourish in darkness, like snails in a dirt-floored cellar, then some future dealer in the history of ideas will have to write a Twentieth Century Back- ground that contains a lament for other values lost. No one need regret that Har- vard is spending a large amount of money on an expanded theological pro- gram, that the theologians and philos- ophers all across the world are demand- ing and getting more and more atten- tion, that discussions of ethics turn up in unlikely places like governments, businesses and research stations. If the world of thought is actually going under new management (or the old one of the days before Bacon and Descartes), there is little need to worry unless-as Mor- gan seems to demand-the new leaders hang "Out to Catch Up" signs on the office doors of the physicists and chem- ists, the psychologists and the psychi- atrists, even probably the sociologists and statisticians. Morgan's The Burn- ing Glass does not kindle any consider- able theatrical fire, but it demands at- tention because it represents-as the glass of the microscope once did-an attempt to warm man by focusing on one aspect of his existence at the ex- pense of everything else. 315</page></plain_text>
