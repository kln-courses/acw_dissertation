First of all we must greet the new series of Rainer Papyri, Mitteilungen aus der Papyrussamm- lung der Nationalbibliothek in Wien, under the editorship of HANS GERSTINGER. The first issue promises well, and includes: Stereometry, Homer, epic and bucolic frs., Aeolic scrap, History of the Diadochi, Demosthenes, Lysias, Isaeus, Encomia, philosophy, mythology, schoolboy essay on preliminaries to the Trojan war, gram- mar, metrics, notes on later dithyrambs, scholia to Pindar's Pythian i. 87, tragic commentary, and com- mentary to De Fals. Leg. Reviewed by POWELL in Cl. Rev., XLVI (1932), 262-3. P.S.I. x, fasc. 2 (see §3 below), consists of literary texts, nos. 1163-81, viz.: Job, Jonah, Acts of Apostles (xxiii. 11-29, Western Text, in hand similar to Brit. Mus. Dio Chrysostom), Apocalypse, Iliad, Herodotus, Aristophanes (Nubes, 577-635), Argonautica (i. 1195-1221, 1 cent.), Scholia to Odyssey, [Corinna (Orestas), Old Comedy, New Comedy, Romance (Antonius Diogenes ?)], Manuals of augury, Medical Receipts from Tebtunis, Odes (Bacchylides ?). Nos. in square brackets already published. The richness of Oxyrhyn- chus as a literary site is again upheld. A new publication, Etudes de Papyrologie, was launched in 1932 by the Soc. Royale Egyptienne de Papyrologie, forming a complement to the "Textes et Documents" of the same Society. In Bursian, 236 (1932), 115-226, A. DEBRUNNER writes a "Bericht iiber die Literatur zum nachklass. Griechisch, 1904-29". KORTE continues his report on Literary Texts in Archiv, x, 217-37. In Etudes de Papyrologie, I (1932), 11-18, W. G. WADDELL publishes "Some Literary Papyri from Oxyrhynchus" in the Cairo collection, viz.: frs. of Iliad, xvI, xxIII, xxIv; Odyssey, xm; Callimachus, H. to Artemis, 46-84 with scholia; Thucydides, I; Euripides, Orestes, 754-64; three texts for school use. P. COLLOMP in Chron. d'Eg., vn (1932), 237-42, writes on La Critique Textuelle et la Papyrologie. Ibid., 243-55, G. voN MANTEUFFEL dis- cusses Die Papyri als Zeugen Griech. Kleinliteratur. POWELL has edited a Third Series of New Chapters in the History of Greek Literature, 1933, with chapters by various authors on Earlier Lyric and Elegiac, Tragedy, Comedy, Later Elegy, etc., Romance, and Appendix. Epic and Elegiac. In Cl. Phil., xxvn (1932), 151-5, BARBARA P. MCCARTHY writes on Line Omissions in Homeric Papyri since 1925, i.e. since Bolling's External Evidence. P. COLLART discusses the papyri of the Iliad in Rev. de Phil., 3 ser., VI (1932), 315-49, vn (1933), 33-61. A. SEVERYNS writes on P. Ryl. 22 and the Little Iliad in Serta Leodiensia, 1930, 305-26. WESSELY is represented in Griffith Studies by an article De Callimacho Bibliothecario, 38-41. In the Festschrift Richard Reitzenstein, 1931, 23-69, E. REITZENSTEIN discusses passages from the Aitia. R. PFEIFFER writes on Berenikes Plokamos in Philologus, LXXXVII (1932), 179-228. Rev. by G. COPPOLA in Boll. di Fil. Class., N.S., II (1932), 272-5. MILNE in Cl. Rev., XLVI (1932), 250, regards AEvKaS lzepas in the Iambi scholia (P.S.I. 1094), 1. 39, as certainly a lemma. Incidentally, is not ev Ti- 'AX'povT in 1. 38 simply a gloss on the unusual [udaov 'AXE'-] povros ? R. KEYDELL in Hermes, LXVII (1932), 240-1, finds remains also of a Gigantias in the Brit. Mus. Bassarica. A. WIFSTRAND edits two Argonautica fragments from Berlin in Eranos, xxx (1932), 1-6. The second consists of scholia to iii, 1075-1127, and contains interesting readings. Tyrtaeus forms the subject of an article by F. SCHACHERMEYR in Rh. Mus., LXXI (1932), 129-42. W. JAEGER also writes on Tyrtaeus in Sitzungsb. Berl. Ak., 1932, 537-68. T. W. ALLEN inter alia discusses Hesiod, fr. 96 (P. Berol. 10560) in Cl. Quart., 1932, 82-7. In Chron. d'Eg., vu (1932), 256-7, G. MEAUTIS writes on Une reminiscence Homerique dans un Pap. d'Oxyrhynchus, i.e. P. Oxy. 1794. Thinks the author a disciple of Callimachus.</page><page sequence="3">§ 1.

Arch. d'Alex., viii (1932), 53-62 W. PEEK restores Griechische Epigramme aus Aegypten, with 6 plates. P. MAAS in Zeitschr. f. vergleich. Sprachforschung, 60, 286, interprets 7rpo,t48Oeaa in P. Brit. Mus. Lit. 54 as aorist imperative of fpor-Oq0eaaoozat. Lyric. B. SNELL identifies P. Oxy. 426 as a Paean of Bacchylides in Hermes, LXVII (1932), 1-13. MAAS, ibid., 469-71, discusses the metrical aspects. B. LAVAGNINI restores Sappho i, 5 (Lobel) in Riv. Indo-Greco-Italica, xvi (1932), 1-5. In 1. 19 v(owve/Los - VHLOL aveLOS is nearer the traces than L.'s 'Ypvaos. L. has also published a Nuova Antologia dei frammenti della lirica greca, Turin, 1932. A new scrap of Corinna is published by G. COPPOLA in his Introduzione a Pindaro, 1931, 231-42. The end of one poem and the first lines with title (Orestas) of a second are preserved. The new Bacchylides (?), P.S.I. 1181, consists of two fragmentary odes, the second entitled Leucippides. These were the wives of the Dioscuri, whose legend (or something similar) is obviously referred to in 11. 27-9 of the first ode. In 11. 13-14 read: JFl uev aKa[Lpov] AorapC |I K&amp;Xerav AL[fLeva,, and in 1. 17 Evave'o[s E]Lapo[s adva]0&amp;ltas. The end of the poem, 11. 21-37, can be restored with practical certainty. In 1. 36 read 17p]a/i8[Es ?, and in 1. 20 Ev,jpar[ov Ov]aia[v ]6a4cov ? K. LATTE in Philologus, LXXXVI (1932), 271-2, interprets Bacchylides xvi. 112. In Phil. Woch., 52 (1932), 87-102, K. MiNSCHER writes on the new Hymns from Epidaurus. Drama, etc. Three new fragments of Aeschylus have been found by the Italians at Oxyrhynchus; two, from the Niobe and the Dictyoulkoi, are published by NORSA and VITELLI in Bull. Soc. Arch. d'Alex., 28, 107-21. G. VON MANTEUFFEL writes on Drobne Gatunki Mimiczne w Swietle Papyrus6w in the Acts of the Second Congress of Slav Classical Philologists, Prague, 1931. I learn from Cl. Rev., XLVI (1932), 145, of two studies of Menander by TSERETELI. In Neophilologus, xvII (1932), 144-52, W. E. J. KNIPER makes a study of De Verfoeide van Menander (MLaolv4evos). KORTE in Hermes, LXVII (1932), 367-8, restores 1. 397 of the T7EpLKeLpo/tev7, and assigns an iambic verse in Vol. Hercul., xI, 160, 9, to the Diktys of Euripides. Q. CATAUDELLA in Riv. difil., Ix (1931), 509-11, makes restorations in the choliambics of P. Heidel. 310. History. G. DE SANCTIS writes on the Oxyrhynchus Hellenica in Atti della Reale Accad. d. Scienze di Torino, LXVI (1931), 157-94, and A. MOMIGLIANO, ibid., 29-49, argues for Androtion as the author. A. v.

He also reviews UXKUI,L-GYLLENBAND'S "New fragment", in Gnomon, vm (1932), 201-6. Oratory. The new Favorinus is treated at length by A. WIFSTRAND in Eikota, II (1932), 1-16. Also by G. M. LATTANZI, II proemio del Trepf ovyijs, in Riv. di il., x (1932), 499-500. There is a long review of F. by K. PRAECHTER in Gnomon, vm (1932), 561-72. P. COLLART also writes on Favorinus in Bull. Ass. Guillaume Bude, xxxrv (1932), 23-31; B. LAVAGNINI in Riv. Indo-Greco-Italica, xvI (1932), 122-4. I learn from Cl. Rev., p. 145, that TSERETELI has published a papyrus of Isocrates, Ad Demonicum. F.

F. ZIMMERMANN in Hermes, LXVI (1932), 91-116, restores two columns of the Ninos romance. In Festschrift fur G. Leidinger, 1930, 102-8, A. HARTMANN publishes from a Munich papyrus of the fourth century a drawing representing a dramatic scene. Of. § 3. 2. RELIGION, MAGIC, ASTROLOGY. (Including Texts.) General. The new volume of Papiri greci e latini (P.S.I. x, 1932) includes 1147, a census record of priests of the temple of Seknebtynis at Tebtunis (A.D. 202/3); 1161, a fourth-century Christian letter; 1162 (" ? 3rd cent. A.D.") a very curious oath to preserve Ta pEra- (rather wrapa-) 8]E6oteva pot ,uvar7jpLa, and mentioning a rarjp and a LepoOKIjpve, clearly the oath of a cult society of an esoteric kind, not unlike the sort of society which might have arisen in connexion with Hermetic literature (the opening formula has the Jewish tinge which we find in C.H.I.). [For some Biblical texts, see § 1 above.-Ed.] P. JoTGUET, Inscription de Deir-Chelouit (Griffith Studies, 241-4, pl. 24a), is a re-edition of S.B. 4023, a graffito by a stolistes with a notable use of els at&amp;va after the Imperial names which date it 15 June 200. G. KLAFFENBACH, Eine Weihungan Isis (Archiv, x (1932), 215-16), gives a curious text from Antinoopolis. The phrase 'Aya0os Ja4Cuov K[al 'A]yaOr) TvtXr aqio [. . .] rTv Kvplav 'Iotv is thought by K. to indicate that these deities, perhaps represented on the relief, were regarded as interceding with Isis for the dedicant. But it is just possible, if unlikely, that 'A.A. and 'A.T. are both personal names. FR. W. VON BISSING, Eine "pantheistische" Bronze in der dgyptischen Sammlung zu Florenz (Aegyptus, xii (1932), 339-45), publishes a puzzling Ptolemaic representation of a human-headed bird, with long tail, its feet on two small rams, a uraeus crown, etc. J. G. MILNE, Arsinoe and Ammon (Griffith Studies, 13-15), makes the interesting suggestion that the doc- trine that Alexander was son of Ammon was developed into a popular romance by Lysimachus and brought to Egypt by his widow Arsinoe. HERBERT THOMPSON, Eponymous Priests under the Ptolemies (Griffith Studies, 16-37), is an invaluable supplement to Plaumann's article Hiereis in Pauly-Wissowa. O. MONTEVECCHI, rpaOal lEpeov (Aegyptus, xII (1932), 317-28), deals with the personal lists annually presented to the civil authority by temples. CH. PICARD, Les influences etrangeres au tombeau de Petosiris: Grece ou Perse? (Melanges V. Loret; Bull. Inst. fr. arch. orient., xxx (1930), 201-27), confirms excellently the hypothesis of Greek influence in the relief decorating of this tomb, as against the hypothesis of Persian influence, and shows new points of contact with Hellenistic art. L. GERNET-A. BOULANGER, Le Genie grec dans la Religion (Bibliotheque de synthese historique, 11; La renaissance du livre. Paris. 1932. Pp. xlii+-528. 40fr.), includes by the second of its two authors, pp. 393- 517, an excellent survey of the religious history of the Hellenistic period. The warning, p. 461, against belief in the supposed Mithraeum at Eleusis will be noted. FRITZ SAXL, Mithras, Typologische Untersuchungen (Verlag Heinrich Keller, Berlin. 1931. Pp. xi+ 125 with 43 plates), is as useful and important a book as it is beautiful. It is a very serious contribution to the study of the interplay of Greek and Eastern factors as well as to art-history. The fresco from Pneferos, which is so instructive a parallel to that from Karanis, is discussed p. 21 and figured Abb. 62. H. MATTINGLY, A Mithraic tessera from Verulam (Num. Chron., 5th ser., xII (1932), 54-7), publishes a queer disk showing the birth of Mithras from a rock (produced by altering the Tarpeia type on a denarius of Augustus), and on the other side MI9PAL QPOMAZAHE read in a circle with 'IPHN across the circle, which indicates a curious blending of Egyptian and Persian elements. HANS HERTER, De Priapo (Religionsgeschichtliche Versuche und Vorarbeiten, xxII (1932). Pp. 334 with 3 plates. Tbpelmann, Giessen), is another admirable study, giving as it does a complete collection of the material literary and monumental, and throwing light on the general processes of Hellenistic development. Theologisches Worterbuch zum Neuen Testament in Verbindung mit ... herausgegeben von GERHARD KITTEL (Kohlhammer, Stuttgart. 1932. 7 parts published at RM 2.90 each, 64 pp. each) is an outstanding enterprise. Intended to take the place of Cremer, it is the product of intimate collaboration by a staff of specialists, and gives a unique series of monographs on words of interest for religious history; it is already indispensable to all workers in this field. In this connexion I may mention E. VON DOBSCHUTZ, Zur Lexikographie des Neuen Testaments und seiner Umwelt (Theol. Stud. u. Krit., civ (1932), 238-54), which surveys recent work and</page><page sequence="5">§ 2. RELIGION, MAGIC, ASTROLOGY 71 remarks, p. 240, on the notable phenomenon of the development of specific Jewish terminology between the LXX and the N.T. J. BIDEZ, La cite du monde et la cite du soleil (Bull. acad. roy. Belg., 5th ser. 18 (1932), nos. 7-9, pp. 244-94; also issued separately by Les Belles Lettres, Paris), is an eloquent and illuminating study of the interpretation of Greek and Eastern idea in Stoicism. B. has also produced Vol. 1, pt. 1 of his Bude edition of Julian, including the political speeches; this fulfils a long-felt need. FR. CUMONT, Tete de marbre figurant la Lybie (Mon. Piot, xxxII (1932), 1-10 with 1 pl. and 3 figs.), incidentally explains a torso from Cyrene as Isis or an Isis priestess and remarks on a gem signed by Lyco- medes as showing a princess reigning at Cyrene with the attributes of Isis. In his L'adoration des mages et l'art triomphal de Rome (Mem. pont. Acd. . di Arch., Ser. III, 3 (1932), 81-109 with 9 pls.), he proves conclusively that a group of reliefs wrongly connected with Magi comes from a triumphal arch set up to celebrate a victory over the Parthians and decorated in a traditional style, shows the effect of this tradition on later Christian representations of the adorations o of Christ by the Magi, and gives a new and illuminating discussion of the custom of veiling the hands which we know in monuments illustrating Egyptian worships as practised in the Graeco-Roman world at large (not in ancient Egypt). H. J. ROSE, Mithra-Phathon chez Nonnus (Rev. hist. rel., cv (1932), 88-101), and CUMONT'S postscript, ibid., 102-3, are supplementary to the paper by C. on La fin du monde noticed in Journal, xvIII (1932), 81. W. .W TARN, Alexander Helios and the Golden Age (J.R.S. xxii (1932), 135-60), argues that Orac. Sib., III, 350 ff. is a prophecy relating to what was expected of Cleopatra, and notes, 139 ff., parallels with the Praises of Isis. He explains the fourth Eclogue, convincingly to my mind, as a prophecy connected with the son expected from Antony and Octavia. G. MANTEUFFEL, In Oraculum figuli observationes (Eos, xxxIII (1930/1), 391-4), supplies parallels from the Old Testament. B. OLSSON, Zwei Papyrusstellen besprochen (Aegyptus, xII (1932), 355 ff.), handles secondly an extra leaf of P. Holmiensis, a formula for seeing the Sungod. L. R. TAYLOR, The divinity of the Roman Emperor, is reviewed by A. D. NOCK, Gnomon, vIII (1932), 513-18; what is there said about Agathos Daimon should be supplemented by reference to the remarks of M. P. NILSSON, Die Gvtter des Symposios (Symbolae philologicae 0. A. Danielsson octogenario dicatae, Uppsala 1932, 218-30) about Zeus Philios, whom he regards with reason as little more than a konkretisierter Begriff, taking shape in the time of the Peloponnesian war as an outgrowth of the rise of individualism, and about the toast of Agathos Daimon himself; also G. H. MACURDY, The grammar of drinking healths (Am. Journ. Phil., LIII (1932), 168-71). S. EITREM, Zur Apotheose (Symb. Oslo., x (1932), 31-56; xi (1932), 11-34; to be cont.), is illuminating on the assumption of divine costume by rulers, etc., on the Gytheion inscription, on Caligula, and on "Die heilige Ehe". K. SCOTT, The significance of statues in precious metals in Emperor Worship (Trans. Am. Phil. Ass., LXII (1931), 101-23), also bears on this topic. G. A. S. SNIJDER, Ein Priester der Magna Mater aus Smyrna (Oudheidkundige Mededeelingen uit's Rijksmuseum van Oudheden te Leiden; Nuntii ex museo antiquario Leidensi, Nieuwe Reeks, XIII, i (1932), 1-13), deals with priestly crowns in general. His very interesting Antique and mediaeval gems on bookcovers at Utrecht (Art Bulletin, xiv (1932), 5-52) includes p. 36 remarks on Egyptian and other types of Bacchus. 0. WEINREICH'S survey, Volkskunde (1925-31) (Arch. f. Rel., xxix (1931), 44-84), should be consulted for parallels to the popular tales of the Empire, on which there are valuable observations in the brilliant paper of E. SCHWARTZ, Unzeitgemdisse Beobachtungen zu den Clementinen (Z. neut. Wiss., xxxII (1932), 151-99). On one folk-tale which comes into our period there are excellent observations by W. KROLL, Das Marchen von Amor und Psyche (Pddagogisches Zentralblatt, Heft 5 (1932), 253-6; valuable criticisms of Reitzenstein's views). F. J. D6LGER, Drei Theta als Schatzsicherung u. ihre Deutung durch den Bischof Theophil von Alexandrien (Antike u. Christentum, m (1932), 189-91), treats the legend of the treasure in Alexander's tomb. In the same journal he discusses a head of an Isis priest with a cross on his forehead, and decides that it is a scar (II (1930), 291-6). H. KEES, Die Himmelsreise im agyptischen Totenglauben (Vortrdge Bibliothek Warburg, 1928/9, pub. 1930), 1-20, is of use to students of this period. The same volume includes R. REITZENSTEIN, Heilige Handlung (21-41), which sums up the Vorgeschichte der christlichen Taufe of the great scholar whom we all mourn.</page><page sequence="6">72 BIBLIOGRAPHY: GRAECO-ROMAN EGYPT (1931-1932) In the previous volume (1927-8, pub. 1930) we may note J. KROLL, Zur Geschichte des Spieles von Christi Hollenfahrt (257-301). A. D. NOCK, Cremation and burial in the Roman Empire (Harv. Theol. Rev., xxv (1932), 321-59), argues that the change from cremation to burial which took place in Italy and the West in the second century A.D. was due not to religious changes but to the fact that the sarcophagus became fashionable and thus made burial customary. He further draws conclusions as to the character of the hellenization of Egyptian and other Eastern cults in the Graeco-Roman world. O. LASSALLY, Amulette u. Tatowierungen in Agypten (Arch. f. Rel., xxIX (1931), 130-8), may be mentioned although not bearing directly on these times. A. STORCH-F. HEICHELIHEIM, Zum Traumglauben u. Traumverstdndniss in der Antike auf Grund urkundlicher Traumberichte aus der Ptolemierzeit (Zentralbl. f. Psychotherapie u. ihre Grenzgebiete, iv (1932), 559-60), is known to me from Aeg. xni (1932), 417, no. 87. WILAMOWITZ-MOELLENDORF, Der Glaube der Hellenen, I, is reviewed by FR. PFISTER, Theol. Lit.-Z., LVII (1932), 148-53; ii by M. P. NILSSON, D. Lit.-Z., 3 F., Ii (1932), 2065-74, which includes a reference to a stele inscribed "Qpov found at Goritsa in Thessaly (B.C.H., LV (1931), 487 ff.) near a building which may be a sanctuary. Graeco-Jewish literature. H. LEWY, Hekataios von Abdera 7repi 'IovSaJwv (Z. neut. Wiss., xxxi (1932), 116-32), gives a powerful defence of the authenticity of the excerpt in Joseph. C. Ap. 183. R. MARCUS, Divine names and attributes in Hellenistic Jewish literature (Proc. Amer. Acad. for Jewish Research, 1931-2, 43-120), is a very valuable piece of lexicographical investigation. J. S. BOUGHTON, The idea of progress in Philo Judaeus (New York, 1932. Distributed by the Jewish Publication Society of America; pp. 292. $1.50), shows a close acquaintance with Philo and his modern interpreters, and emphasizes well the peculiarly Jewish element in his work and the definite point of view to which Philo adapts the concepts of popular philosophy.

The same writer in his Faba Pythagorae cognata (Serta Leodiensia, in the same Bibl., XLIV (1930), 33-57) has a noteworthy explanation of that well-known superstition and rapprochements with magical practice. His first topic is handled also by TH. HOPFNER, Mittel- und neugriechische Lekano-, Lychno-, Katoptro- und Onychomantien (Griffith Studies, 218-32), with great knowledge. CAMPBELL BONNER, Demons of the bath (ibid., 203-8), gives an interesting collection and discussion of material bearing on this superstition. In his Liturgical fragments on Gnostic amulets (Harv. Theol. Rev., xxv (1932), 362-7), he publishes an amulet with part of the hymn which closes Corp. Herm. I and another of Chnubis with the phrase ;Swp tb+I apTro 7TreWrLV ip ptyoz which is presumably a series of avtvara. For an analogy to the usage of magical papyri cf.

Notes on and corrections of miscellaneous documents previously published are referred to in § 9. Notes on single documents will be found here; so too all reviews, when sufficiently important for mention.) General. I have not at the time of writing had an opportunity of seeing what is certain to prove a very important and interesting addition to the well-known Loeb series, namely a selection of the more noteworthy papyrus texts chosen and edited by HUNT and EDGAR. Apparently only the first of two volumes, by the latter, has yet appeared. Select Papyri. With an English Translation. By A. S. HUNT and C. C. EDGAR. 2 vols. I. Private Affairs. London, Heinemann; New York, Putnam; 1932. Pp. xx+452. Cloth, 10s. (leather, 12s. 6d.). P. Oslo. n (Journal, xvm, 83) has been reviewed by H. C. YOUTIE (Cl. Phil., xxvn (1932), 86-95; rather unsympathetic); K. PREISENDANZ (O.L.Z., xxxv (1932), 554-5; Phil. Woch., L1: (1932), 227-34); K. FR. W. SCHMIDT (O.G.A., cxcIV (1932), 279-86; detailed, many suggestions); and H. I. BELL (Cl. Rev., XLVI (1932), 23-4; Mizraim, I (1933), 190-1). BtTTNER'S edition of papyrus letters from the collection of the Giessen University Library (Journal, xvnii, 84) has been reviewed by B. OLSSON (D). Lit.-Z., 1932, 879-80); F. Z[UCKER] (B.Z., xxxII (1932), 158); WILCKEN (Archiv, x, 273-5); and SCHUBART (Gnomon, vmi (1932), 552). During the year under review a whole new volume of P.S.I., issued in two parts, has appeared, and it ranks among the most important of the series, despite the fact that, unlike several of its predecessors, it contains no texts from the Zenon archive. The second part (pp. 105-232), which included the indices and a graceful dedicatory poem in Greek elegiacs by V[ITELLI] to WILCKEN on his seventieth birthday, consists entirely of literary or theological texts, and therefore does not fall within the scope of this section; but the first is purely documentary. There are two texts of the Ptolemaic period, but the rest are Roman or Byzantine (almost entirely the former), and they include some very interesting documents, e.g. 1100, an extract from the v7ropvwrjiLaTa,aLot of the epistrategus Vedius Faustus; 1103, in which a man of over seventy asks for relief from a liturgy on that ground and also because his eyesight is weak; 1105, a petition which throws light on the position of the nomographos; 1119, an interesting sale of live stock [in the subscription only TavptKa Kal PoLKa are mentioned, whereas oLcKa occur in 1. 8; should we therefore read 11. 7 f. Tau-] I p/LKa and in 1. 12 (e.g.) [rdcv-rwv orv Tav] pLK.5 ?]; 1123, important for the evOV€ELaa of Alexandria; 1125, a letter-book of the procura- tor usiacus; 1128, an interesting agreement for a temple oath, one party being a Lepovl'Kqrs E'e etrqfEdasg; 1132, an apprenticeship to a mat-maker [Mr. Tait, for the note on 1. 1, refers to his note on Ostr. Petrie, 288]; 1146, important for the poll-tax of priests; 1149, a very interesting but unfortunately very imperfect document about priests; 1161, a moving Christian (?) letter; and 1162, a most notable oath of a probably pagan mystes.l A review of the second part of vol. IX by P. COLLART has appeared in Rev. de phil., ser. 3, vi (1932), 77-8. The first part of x has been reviewed by WILCKEN (Archiv, x, 249-59; very important as usual) and F. ZUCKER (B.Z., xxxII (1932), 408). Ptolemaic. P. Cairo Zenon, IV (Journal, xvIII, 84) has been reviewed by WILCKEN (Archiv, x, 238-41) and P. Mich. Zenon (Journal, ibid.) by P. COLLART (Rev. de phil., ser. 3, vI(1932), 411-12); W. L. WESTERMANN (A.J.A., xxxvi (1932), 75-6); H. I. BELL (Mizraim, i (1933), 186-7) and anonymously (J.H.S., LII (1932), 145). Two articles which deal with the Zenon papyri may here be mentioned. ELIZABETH GRIER (Accounting in the Zenon Papyri, in Cl. Phil., xxvn (1932), 222-31) discusses the methods of account-keeping illustrated by some of the documents from the archive, and W. SCHUBART publishes translations of seven letters from it, with a general introduction and some explanatory comment (Griechische Briefe aus Agypten, in Die Antike, vIII (1932), 113-37). O. GUERAUD'S masterly work, 'EvrevELt (Journal, xvnI, 84), has been completed by the appearance during the year of the second part, containing (pp. 129-296) the concluding portion of no. 52, nos. 53-113, an appendix containing four fragments which, though of a different character from the EVTEVfILS, are of juristic interest, and the indices, additions, and corrections, etc. The whole volume is a work of the first importance, and its merits have been generally recognized. Part I has been reviewed by W. SCHUBART (O.L.Z., xxxv (1932), 106-9); P. COLLOMP (Rev. it. anc., xxxrv (1932), 83-7); K. PREISENDANZ (Phil. Woch., 1932, 609-13); P. CHANTRAINE (Rev. crit., LXVI (1932), 103-5); M. HOMBERT (Rev. belge, xi (1932), 231-2; not seen); P. COLLART (Rev. de phil., ser. 3, vi (1932), 413-14); part II by WILCKEN (Archiv, x, 241-8). C. C.

(ibid., 191-3). Various reviews of the Loeb demotic papyri (Journal, xvii, 85) have appeared. The following call for mention: by L. WENGER and E. SEIDL (Z. Sav., LII (1932), 430-8); E. SEIDL (K. V.G.R., xxv (1932), 297-306 [see also § 6]); WILCKEN (Archiv, x, 248-9); F. LL. GRIFFITH (Journal, xvIrI (1932), 194-5); and A. CALDERINI (Aegyptus, xii (1932), 78-9). SEIDL has, further, published a separate article on no. 12 (see § 6 below): Zu Pap. Strassb. dem. 12, in Z. Sav., LII (1932), 326-8. A reference must here be inserted to what is evidently an important article, seen as this goes to press: N. J. REICH, New Documents from the Serapeum of Memphis, in Mizraim, I (1933), 9-129 (to be continued). Roman. JOHNSON and VAN HOESEN's P. Princ. Univ. (Journal, xvir, 85) has been reviewed by H. A. SANDERS (A.J.A., xxxvi (1932), 209); P. COLLOMP (Rev. et. anc., xxxIII (1931), 398-9); M. NORSA (Boll. Fil. Cl., xxxvi[I (1932), 190-3); M. HOMBERT (Musee belge, xi (1932), 140-1); and H. I. BELL (Cl. Rev., XLVI (1932), 22-3, and Mizraim, I (1933), 189-90). COLLART'S P. Achmim (Journal, xviii, 85) has been reviewed by WILCKEN (Archiv, x, 261-7). P. COLLART has found among the Reinach Papyri (now belonging to the Paris Faculte des Lettres and housed in the Institut de Papyrologie) the lost beginning of P. Ryl. 178, and publishes the complete document (A.D. 26). Un papyrus Reinach inedit et P. Rylands 178, in Melanges Glotz, I (1932), 241-7. Reviews of L6scH's Epistula Claudiana continue to appear. In the year under review I have noted the following: by G. HOENNICKE (O.L.Z., xxxv (1932), 310-11); G. GHEDINI (Aegyptus, xII (1932), 72); and P. DE LABRIOLLE (Rev. de phil., ser. 3, vi (1932), 418-20). H. JANNE in an article on the concluding section of the letter of Claudius (P. Lond. 1912) brings new arguments, by no means conclusive indeed but certainly interesting, in favour of S. Reinach's view of that passage as containing a reference to Christian propaganda at Alexandria. He differs from Reinach on one point: for him the "Jews from Syria" were not Christian missionaries but anti-Christian emissaries of the Pharisees. Un passage controverse de la lettre de Claude aux Alexandrins, in Rev. Arch., ser. 5, xxxv (1932), 268-81. See also § 4 below. UXKULL-GYLLENBAND'S fragment of the Acta Isidori (Journal, xvII, 126) has been reviewed by A. VON PREMERSTEIN (Gnomon, viI (1932), 201-6), who attacks his view that the trial occurred in A.D. 41; for a fuller statement of the same point of view by the same scholar see § 1 above and § 4 below. The fragment published by H. I. BELL (Journal, xviii, 86) is the subject of an article by A. NEPPI MODONA, who reprints the text: Il nuovo frammento di una redazione variata degli "Atti di Isidoro", in Aegyptus, xI (1932), 333-8. With which fragment A. MOMIGLIANO deals in an article, not yet accessible to me, entitled Un nuovo fram- mento dei cosidetti "Atti dei martiri pagani" (Rend. Pont. Ace. Arch., vn (1932), 119 f.; see Aegyptus, xn, 291, no. 9711), I am unable to say. V. MARTIN publishes a small fragment of a land-tax register (P. Genev. Inv. no. 125) which seems to date from the end of the first century and the names in which are mostly those of Romans. Proprietaires romains en Egypte sous l'Empire, in Melanges Glotz, 551-5. An important volume published by W. L. WESTERMANN and C. W. KEYES is to be known as P. Columbia, ii, vol. I being Westermann's Upon Slavery in Ptolemaic Egypt. This volume contains the texts of a group of six papyri dating from the first half and middle of the second century and all of them, according to the editors (but see WILCKEN, Archiv, x, 272 f.), from Theadelphia. The first three are taxation rolls, relating mostly to poll-tax and the related taxes, the fourth is a series of receipts for payments for transport service, etc., from the same roll as FRISK'S Bankakten (Westermann on an inserted slip explains that his and Keyes's work was done independently but that on becoming acquainted with Frisk's volume he was able to make the necessary alterations in their own transcripts in proof), the fifth is a list of donkey-drivers, the sixth is an account of taxes in kind. It will be seen that there is much material of a useful if not sensational character, and it is handled with the editors' usual care and provided with an elaborate commentary.

E. KORNEMANN publishes an interesting example of an Elterliche Teilung fiir den Todesfall (Archiv, x, 213-15) from the Giessen collection (P. Giss. Inv. Nr. 255). It is a notarial homologia, with six witnesses, from Tebtunis, and is dated in A.D. 139. H. KORTENBEUTEL, who is working in the papyrus collection at Berlin, has published from that collection an oath document of a somewhat noteworthy character. Dated in A.D. 153, it is a deposition to witnessing the scourging of a Roman citizen by order of Hierax, strategus of the Heraclides Division. It is a double deed, with six witnesses. Kortenbeutel adds a valuable commentary on the many interesting questions which it raises. Ein Kaisereid, in Aegyptus, xII (1932), 129-40, with facsimile. A private letter published by VITELLI seems to prove that T. Flavius Victorinus entered Alexandria as prefect on 10 July A.D. 159.

In a brief notice (Archiv, x, 276) WILCKEN agrees with Vitelli's inference. The Vatican roll, edited by NORSA and VITELLI, which contains on one side Favorinus's 17Epi Ovyis and on the other land registers from the Marmarica (Journal, xviI, 79, 87) has received notice from several reviewers. The following may be noted here, the first of which, as the review is not accessible to me, I take from the bibliography in Aegyptus, xnii (1932): C. GALLAVOTTI, II papiro Vaticano greco II, in Historia, v (1921; sic, 1. 1931 ?), 644-7 (see p. 84, no. 9112); and A. G. AMATUCCI (Boll. fil. cl., xxxvm (1931), 4-7). See too § 1 above, and Aegyptus, xII, 82, Intorno al papiro Vaticano Greco II. W. L.

Entertainment in the Villages of Graeco-Roman Egypt, in Journal, xvim (1932), 16-27. A. E. R. BOAK publishes a noteworthy appeal by an Antinoite for relief from a guardianship, which offers several points of special interest. It includes copies of judgements bearing on the case. Boak takes the date as A.D. 172-3. [I may say that I cannot believe in Boak's interpretation of 11. 35-8; HUNT's view, quoted in the note, seems much more probable.] A petition for relief from a guardianship: P. Mich. Inv. No. 2922, in Journal, xvIII (1932), 69-76. An important papyrus of the Geneva collection published by V. MARTIN throws new light on the arrange- ments for entry among the Alexandrian ephebi. It dates from about the end of the second century and appears to be an extract from the protocol of the proceedings preliminary to such entry. It consists of a series of questions addressed to the candidate. It is interesting to note what these questions are; and furthermore the text is of value as proving that, whatever the rAaytov so often mentioned in connexion with ephebi may have been, it was not the detachment to which the new ephebe was assigned, for the boy here interrogated names the 7rAXdyov to which he (already) belonged. It is further interpreted, both by the editor and by WILCKEN in a review (Archiv, x, 275-6), as proving that enrolment in a deme preceded, and did not follow, admission to the ephebate; but I am not convinced that this is a necessary inference. It is true that the boy is here called woatKoaiuos o [Kal] ZrjvE[o]s, but these words occur in the heading. The text is an extract, and the heading may have been no part of the original protocol and may refer to the ephebe at the time (perhaps considerably later) when the extract was made. I should therefore prefer to regard the evidence of this papyrus as neutral on the point. Un document relatif a l'ephebie, in Chron. d'Eg., vi (1932), 300-10, with facsimile. S. EITREM contributes to the volume, Griffith Studies (Two Greek Papyri, pp. 214-17), copies of two papyri from his own collection. The first is a second-century list of names, of no great importance, but offering some intriguing problems; the second, of the third century, is a customs receipt for Atlevos MeLieows issued at the 7rvnr of Philadelphia, and it gives Eitrem occasion for an interesting excursus on such receipts, on the "harbour of Memphis", and on the mysterious 'Epzrjs which occurs in certain customs registers.

[Cf. also § 2.] An exceptionally interesting private letter, dating from the third century, is published by V. MARTIN from the Geneva collection. Its value lies in its pronounced literary flavour and its educational interest.

A Greek Papyrus Letter to a Student, in Griffith Studies, 245-7, plate 24b. Roman-Byzantine. An important volume of non-literary texts comes from the University of Uppsala and illustrates the value of co-operation both between individual scholars and between institutions. During the years 1920-5 a collection of fifty-eight papyri was deposited on loan by the Staatliche Museen at Berlin in the Greek seminar at Uppsala, for the purpose of papyrological study. As explained by the general editor, T. Kalen, the original idea of publishing the whole collection in a single volume was abandoned owing to various circumstances, the literary texts in particular being reserved for later treatment. The volume now issued, which is the joint work of the seminar under the direction of Kalen (who has himself contributed very largely to the whole), contains twenty-five texts, ranging in date from the second to the fourth century. To the last century indeed (A.D. 309) only one text belongs, all the others being of the Roman period. The first four are the rolls previously published by THUNELL in his Sitologen-Papyri. They are published unchanged as regards the text (corrections being relegated to the commentary or the Berichtigungen und Nachtrdge) but with a new commentary (of course founded on Thunell's) by Kalen. The other texts are of various types but with a preponderance o f official docuents or documents oa semi-official character (returns, etc.). There are the usual indices and three excellent facsimiles. Berliner Leihabe griechischer Papyri: herausgegeben vom griechischen Seminar der Universitat Uppsala. I. Uppsala, A.-B.

ZERETELI and P. JERNSTEDT, which embraces texts of the late Roman and Byzantine periods. It contains a wealth of interesting and valuable material, and the names of the editors are sufficient warrant for the merits of the commentary. The first twenty-three texts are letters, the remaining thirty-four private contracts or official documents. In the first class may be mentioned two very interesting letters to a certain Antonia, the first, from a physician named Marcus, referring to a battle (/axq) in which the Roman army had suffered appre- ciable loss; and, at the other end of the series, to a letter from the well-known Arab pagarch 'Atiyyah to the riparius of Arsinoe bidding him bring certain ev7ropo.

The first is the famous receipt issued by the general 'Abdallah in the year 22 of the Hegira, during the very conquest of Egypt; all three are of great interest, and Grohmann deserves hearty thanks for making them generally accessible.1 4.

ROBINSON in Am. Journ. Phil., LIII (1932), 383-5, by J. A. 0. LARSEN in Cl. 1 I have considerable doubts as to the correctness of some of Grohmann's readings, extensions, or interpretations, and think it well to record them here. No. 1 (p. 41) he interprets as a receipt for supplies obtained for the army, which, instead of making them an extra charge on the inhabitants, 'Abdallah credits to their tax quota. "En d'autres termes: le g6n6ral nourrit ses soldats sur le tresor public"; and Grohmann uses the text as evidence for the humanity and clemency of the conquerors. It certainly would be if his interpretation were correct, but I can see no warrant for it in the endorsement, on which it rests. Grohmann translates this: "Document concernant la remise de brebis aux Magarites et a d'autres gens qui arriverent, a titre d'accompte sur les impots de la premiere indiction." I should myself render it: 'Receipt for sheep delivered to the Magarites and others who came up to collect the taxes of the first indiction", and explain the transaction as an instance of the use of troops (common even under Byzantine rule) to collect the taxes, their maintenance being charged on the taxpayers. The Arab invaders had taken the precaution to secure the taxes due to the government against which they were fighting. In no. 2 (p. 44), 1. 2, for Grohmann's ovai(as) read presumably ovoa: not "de mon train" but "accompanying me". In no. 3 (p. 45) Grohmann finds evidence for the rule (agreed to by the Copts in their treaty with the Arab conquerors) by which troops passing through a district were entitled to three days' maintenance. This view rests on his reading in 1. 3, b]ar[dv]r7v -rptv 7ratALK(iv) EKaIarw, which he renders "un [re]pas de trois plats" (he has to admit in another document "des repas de 4 plats chacun", which weakens the case for his version here). In the absence of a facsimile it would be rash to be dogmatic, but I feel fairly certain that the true reading is rraXALK(aplwv), for which see P. Lond. 1447, 13, note. In the endorsement I suggest for Grohmann's KC)(L(r,)K(os) either KwIJt(rTv) ("villagers") or (more probably) KwtL(-TCKCv) ("village dues") the first t being in either case for -; in 1. 3 read ap-r(d7v), in 1. 2 OvUA(js) and, possibly, for €K(da)T((w), eK(ca)r(ov)or EK r(oV voiJ.aTro) followed by dpov(pag). The meaning of 1. 2 is not entirely clear to me, but I suggest as the probable rendering of the whole: "Sell to 'Amir b. Asla' of the tribe Kouta [or is it possible to read Kovpa and explain as "of the Kuraish" ?] for three solidi hay at the rate of two arourae per solidus and stabling (?) and maintenance of three attendants at the rate of one artaba of bread per month to each." The endorsement may be rendered "By the people of Sophthis for village dues three solidi and (maintenance of) three attendants".</page><page sequence="13">§ 4.

LAW 83 d'assyriologie juridique, Rev. hist. dr., xi (1932), 501-15. A very interesting beginning of the study of Hittite private law has been made by V. KOROSEC, Z.

The former, though appreciative, thinks that the author goes too far in the view that Philo reflects the law of the contemporary Jewish courts in Alexandria; such reflection as there is, is unconscious. Greek law. What is evidently an important book (not seen), U. E. PAOLI'S Studi di diritto attico (Florence, 1930), containing studies of the Attic maritime loan, Vro0-qKr-adronTt7Lia, and citizenship, is highly praised by E. WEISS, Z. Sav., LII (1932), 441-7. The reviewer, who has himself published a short characterization of Greek law in the Encycl. of the Social Sciences (New York, 1931-), considers PAOLI'S separate treatment of Attic law to be justifiable, provided that, like him, one relates it to the laws of the other cities. V. ARANGIO- RuIz, Arch. Giurid., cvn (1932), 245-53, is equally laudatory, especially of the third study, in which a new view of Attic marriage is proposed, but differs from the author as to V15o0'KqI and aTronitfLfa. The next volume of the Arch. Giurid., 161-78, however, publishes a remarkable answer by PAOLI. Demotic law. E. SEIDL, K.V.G.R., xxv (1931-2), 219-49, continues his Sammelbericht (Journal, xvin (1931), 131), the first part of which has been welcomed by L. WENGER, ibid., 285-6, and P. M. MEYER, ibid., 360. Here he completes and brings up to date his previous article, and then deals with public law and administration. He considers that M. SAN NICOL6's Beitrdge (Journal, xviii (1932), 91-2) have opened up to Egyptologists the best comparative material, but takes exception to his chronological table, in which the column Egypt ought to begin not with 1400 or even 710, but with the Fourth Dynasty (2720-2560). In Zu Pap. Strassb. dem. 12, Z. Sav., LII (1932), 326-8, E. SEIDL disagrees with W. KUNKEL'S interpretation of this papyrus (Journal, xvIII (1932), 93, 99). L. WENGER and E. SEIDL, Z. Sav., LII, 430-8, and E. SEIDL alone, K. V.G.R., xxv (1931-2), 297-306, review W. SPIEGELBERG'S Die dem. Papyri Loeb (cf. F. LL. GRIFFITH, Journal, xvIII (1932), 194-5). In both reviews attention is drawn to Pap. 43 as throwing light on the Ptolemaic avyypari adiroarTaalov; both in fact lay stress on points of demotic law elucidating the Ptolemaic and Roman periods, and this is ex professo the aim of E. SEIDL'S Die dem. Zivilprozessordnung und die griech. Rechts- urkunden, Chron. d'Eg., Nos. 13-14 (1932), 210-26, to which, space forbidding details, the attention of students of the Greek Ptolemaic texts is strongly recommended. Cf. L. WENGER, Archiv, x (1931-2), 286; U. WILCKEN, ibid., 248-9. Coptic law. A. A. SCHILLER, K.V.G.R., xxv (1931-2), 250-96, begins a general survey of the sources and literature for Coptic law (sixth to tenth centuries). He treats of the general problems, legal sources, docu- ments, and the law of persons, property, succession, and obligations, reserving for a future article civil procedure and criminal law and procedure. Cf. Journal, xvini (1932), 93; W. E. CRUM, ibid., 196-7, and L. WENGER, ibid., 287-8. Eastern Hellenistic law. P. KOSCHAKER'S important book (Journal, xvm (1932), 93, 94, 96-7) is reviewed by M. SAN NICOL6, Z. Sav., LII (1932), 460-6 (cf. O.L.Z., xxxIV (1931), 1015-18), by F. DE ZULUETA, Law Quart. Rev., XLVII (1932), 275-6, and by L. WENGER, Archiv, x (1931-2), 289-90. The fundamental question raised by the Avroman and Dura finds, namely how far Hellenistic law took effect in the interior of Asia, which is touched on by SAN NICOL5 in his review, is the subject of P. KOSCHAKER'S Leyden address: Die rechtsgeschtliche Bedeutung der griech. Pergamenturkunden aus Dura, Chron. d'Eg., Nos. 13-14 (1932), 202-9. There is a gap of about 200 years between the earliest Greek texts and the latest cuneiform. The private law of a Greek ro'ALs like Dura was doubtless at first Greek (cf. P. Dura 5, Journal, xvIII (1932), 98), but how long did it remain pure, and how far was it received by the mixed native population of the district ? In P. Dura 10 and in the Avroman parchments we find, as in Egypt, Greek documentation extended to non-Greeks, but is this only form ? The question is difficult, because we do not know the contemporary native law and because Greek law has not the specific, easily distinguishable quality of Roman law. From P. Dura 10 the natural conclusion is that Greek law is applied to oriental parties, but antichrestic self-pledge is also found in cunei- form sources from 2000 B.C., and probably the native institution persisted. Thus we cannot infer reception of Greek law; still, Greek juristic thought and form are dominant. But in Z. Sav., LII (1932), 340-2, Zu P. Dura 10, E. SCH6NBAUER denies the cogency of the oriental parallels, earlier by centuries, and maintains that P. Dura 10 exhibits pure Greek law, antichrestic debtor-bondage, which is a common Indo-Germanic institution, and the best parallel to which is the Roman mancipii causa, etc. He develops this view further in an article in Archiv, x (1931-2), 201-10, to which we shall return (below B ii and C); L. WENGER is not unfavourable, Archiv, x, 289. E. BICKERMANN, reviewing Yale Class. Stud., II (1931), in Gnomon, vIn</page><page sequence="18">84 BIBLIOGRAPHY: GRAECO-ROMAN EGYPT (1931-1932) (1932), 572-7, regards P. Dura 10 as a diplomatic hybrid, in form neither Greek nor Babylonian, but Parthian, like the two other Greek documents from Parthia. The witnesses are to the transaction, not to the document, which therefore, unlike the cuneiform document, is simply evidentiary. The combination with the sealed double form is due to reception. Cf. Jeremiah, xxxii, 9 f. It is suggested that the borrower, since he retains property of his own, is to be the lender's military retainer, more Parthico, rather than his serf. The Berytus question. Byzantine law. The Milan Conferenze (Journal, xvIII (1932), 92) are reviewed by F. DE ZULUETA, Law Quart. Rev., XLVII (1932), 272-4. See also L. WENGER, Archiv, x (1931-2), 291 and A. LEVET, Rev. hist. dr., xi (1932), 539-43. H. F. JOLowIcz, Academic Elements in Roman Law, Law Quart. Rev., XLVII, 171-90, maintains that till after the end of the classical period academic influence is negligible, but that in the later period it is a factor, the results of which have in a number of points been demonstrated. F. PRINGSHEIM, Bonum et aequum, Z. Sav., LII (1932), 78-155, argues that the phrase was hardly ever used by the classical jurists save with reference to the formulae in which it occurred, whereas in interpolated texts of Justinian it appears almost always in the form ex bono et aequo, as an expression of the new Byzantine equity. E. LEVY, Zur Infamie im rom. Strafrecht, Studi in onore di Salvatore Riccobono, Ii, 79-100 (Palermo, 1932, offprint), shows the effect on the classical edictal principle, which made infamia an automatic con- sequence of condemnation in certain cases, first of the extension of the cognitio and secondly of the late imperial tendency to remove the penalty from the discretion of the judge. Incidentally he reveals a poignant page in the life of Papinian and a characteristic piece of Byzantine scholasticism. F. DOLGER, B.Z., XXXII (1932), 245-6, announces the publication (Athens, 1931, edd. J. and P. ZEPOS) of eight volumes which are mainly a reprint of ZACHARIAE VON LINGENTHAL'S scarce lus graeco-romanum, but contain interesting additions. Although DOLGER does not praise the execution of the work highly, he considers it useful, as does L. WENGER, Archiv, x (1931-2), 292. In fasc. 2 (1931) of the new 'Apx. B.J. (above i), 437-40, I. C. TORNARITES, reviewing G. FERRARI, Diritto Bizantino, Encicl. Ital., viI (1930), 141-8 (not seen), contends that in spite of its Roman skeleton the spirit and social character of the Byzantine law is Greek. Apart from this dissent, the review is favourable. There is a discussion of the meaning of CnmrTeAEa in medieval texts. iv. Juristic texts. J. C. NABER, Scholia ad Pandectas Graecas in integrum restituta tria, Studi in memoria di Aldo Albertoni, i, 21-3 (Padua, 1932, offprint), after announcing a forthcoming demonstration that certain fragments published by SEYMOUR DE RICCI in Et. Girard, I, 273 ff. (1913) give a text from the first edition of the Cod. Just., attempts, by the aid of scholia on the Basilica, a conjectural restoration of other fragments published in the same place. They are Greek scholia on D. 19, 2, 54, 1; 55, 1.3, written later than Nov. 120 (544). The discovery of a scholium on L. 55, 3 is of interest, because this text is omitted by the Florentine MS. of the Digest, though its existence has been inferred from Greek sources. v. Diplomatic. B. KTiBLER, Pariculum exemplum, St. Riccobono, i, 437-53 (Palermo, 1932, offprint), finds the clue to the enigmatic word periculum in the rubric De sententiis ex periculo recitandis of C. Theod. 4, 17 and C. Just. 7, 44, and in Cic. II in Verrem, III, 183. It is a mistake for pariculum and should properly mean duplicate (lao5rvrov of the Novels, Laov of the papyri), but in the slang of the chanceries, which was inherited by the Middle Ages, it meant the final draft sententia drawn up by the scribae, which was corrected and subscribed by the magistrate and, when read to the parties, became unalterable. Parties were provided with a duplicate, mundum, which also was an authentic original, a duplicate as opposed to a mere copy (exemplum, v-rilypaqov). The question of duplicate originals is further considered in relation, inter alia, to imperial enactments and to wills. It is unfortunate that in this fascinating study the printing of the Greek text on p. 439 seems to have gone awry. At the very last moment W. KUNKEL kindly sends Zur Grdko-&amp;gyptischen Doppelurkunde, St. Riccobono, i, 415-33 (Palermo, 1932, offprint). B. Law of persons. i. Juristic persons. New documents: P. M. MEYER, Z. Sav., LII (1932), 363. G. BESELER, ibid., 284-7, Zu dem Briefe Hadrians an Plotina vom Jahre 121, returns to a subject recently treated of by A. STEINWENTER (Journal, XVII (1932), 94). He interprets Hadrian's letter as a permission to a Roman citizen, Theotimus, to make a will in Greek and according to Greek law, and thereby to regulate the succession to the headship of the Epicurean School, which was corporative owner of the School property, and as an Athenian corpora- tion was subject to Greek law. Hadrian may or may not have doubted the capacity of a diadochus, who happened to be a Roman citizen, to act under Athenian law; at any rate, he removed all doubt in the present case. See below, vi.</page><page sequence="19">§6. LAW 85 ii. Slavery and bondage. E. SEIDL, K.V.G.R., xxv (1931-2), 306-13, reviewing V. ARANGIO-RUIZ, Persone efamiglia, etc. (Journal, xvni (1931), 135, 136) adduces in confirmation of the author's conception of Graeco- Egyptian slavery (possibility of half-freedom) E. WEISS, Communio pro indiviso und pro diviso, Archiv, iv (1908), 330 ff. and P. dem. Loeb 41 and 47. He also states that Egyptian law permitted sale of self and sale of one's children into slavery, a point on which P. KOSCHAKER had expressed doubt. As noted here last year (p. 94), there is a difference of opinion with regard to the effect on this question of P. Colomb. 480, published by W. L. WESTERMANN, Upon Slavery in Ptolemaic Egypt (summarized by P. M. MEYER, Z. Sav., LII (1932), 367-8, and reviewed, chiefly with reference to its fiscal side, by F. OERTEL, Gnomon, viiI (1932), 647-56). E. SCHoNBAUER, Archiv, x (1931-2), 182-5, produces very strong confirmation of KOSCHAKER'S interpretation, which is that 11. 23 ff. of the papyrus are not concerned with bondage or enslavement of free persons, but with slaves given as security. The contrast between vro'xpea awcarTa and E'Aev'pa is between slaves already pledged and those clear of encumbrance (ave'ra^a). This involves that the editorial completion is wrong, and another is proposed. The royal ordinance as a whole thus dealt with the acquisition of slaves by private purchase (11. 1-14), with auction-sales by the State and its organs (11. 15-22), and with hypotheca- tion and forfeiture (11. 23 ff.). On the other hand, as noted above (A. iii. Eastern Hellenistic law), SCHONBATER in the same article differs from KOSCHAKER with regard to P. Dura 10. See also below, C. Colonate. F. ZUCKER, B.Z., XXXII (1932), 85-9, reviewing P. Ross. Georg. III, draws attention to the importance of Pap. 8 for the history of patrocinium. iii. Civitas. See P. M. MEYER, Z. Sav., LII (1932), 368-70; U. E. PAOLI, Studi di diritto attico, no. 3 (above, A iii, Greek law). iv. Family. E. SEIDL, in the review of V. ARANGIO-RUIZ just mentioned (ii), while approving of the author's conception of the proprietary organization of the Egyptian family (children have expectant iura ad rem), observes that this conclusion rests on particular marriage-contracts, and that we do not know the common law. He thinks that there is demotic evidence of a far-reaching patria potestas (P. Louvre E. 7832 = Corp. Pap. I, 8). With reference to the Karanis diptych published by H. A. SANDERS, A.J.A., xxxii, 309-29 (Journal, xvi (1930), 135; xvii, 136), U. WILCKEN, Archiv, x (1931-2), 276-7, withdraws his own expansion of deereebts in favour of DITTMANN'S. R. TAUBENSCHLAG, 'Evvoiosg 'HAXKia nel diritto papiri, Aegyptus, xII (1932), 141-4, inquires into the age of majority in Graeco-Egyptian law, which, as A. BERGER in his important recent article Minores in Pauly- Wissowa (cols. 1883-4) observes, is uncertain. TAUBENSCHLAG shows that the evidence has greatly increased since his article Die patria potestas im Recht der Papyri, Z. Sav., xxxvnr (1916), 177-230, where he had con- cluded that the age was 18, though for ITepuat Trjsg Enyovfjs it was probably 20. P. Oxy. 2134 (A.D. 170) with B.G.U. 1068 (A.D. 101) perhaps reduces the former figure to 14. For Romans the 25 years of the 1. Plaetoria were kept to: P. Oxy. 2111 (A.D. 135), but after the Const. Antoniniana there is trace of persistence for a time of the Graeco-Egyptian age; the Byzantine P. Lond. 1, 113 (p. 201), however, shows that ultimately the official law here won the day. To the recently published documents concerning guardianship and minority recorded by P. M. MEYER, Z. Sav., Ln (1932), 373-4, should now be added P. Mich. Inv. 2922 (c. A.D. 172/3) published by A. E. R. BOAK, Journal, xviii (1932), 69-76. It is a petition for excusatio tutelae, on which some further slight juristic commentary might be desirable; but the most interesting point, the citation of precedents (cf. e.g. M., Chr. 85), is obvious. R. TAUBENSCHLAG, Die Alimentationspflicht im Rechte der Papyri, Studi Riccobono, I, 507-18 (Palermo, 1932, offprint), contributes a systematic study of the papyri in which any sort of duty of maintenance appears. As between parents there seems to have been no such duty apart from contract in national Egyptian law, but only a social duty. After the Const. Antoniniana the case was altered: e.g. P. Lond. 1708 (A.D. 567), from which it may further be inferred that the law of Justinian imposed no duty as between brother and sister. There may have been one in respect of a wife divorced when pregnant: P. Fay. 22 (M., Chr. 291, first century B.C.) and P. Flor. 93 (A.D. 567). But the most frequent source of the duty is contract, either as an incident of service-contracts of all kinds, including wapa,uovr5, or as a principal term in family-contracts on marriage or adoption, or parental divisions of property. We find, in particular, cases in which a parent parting with property to a child imposes a duty of y-qpoooaKEta. Reservations of life-rents for maintenance are also common in wills. A curious case is seen in B.G.U. 1024 (fourth century): the mother of a murdered girl is awarded one-tenth of the murderer's property in lieu of her lost right to maintenance, an idea which recurs in late Bvzantine law. With this study may usefully be compared Un contratto vitalizio del tempo di Dario I, Aegyptus, xii (1932), 35-47, in which M.

Heidelberg, 1923, 6. v. Marriage. A condensed summary of W. F. EDGERTON'S Notes on Egyptian Marriage chiefly in the Ptol. Period (Journal, xvIII (1932), 95) is given by P. M. MEYER, Z. Sav., LII (1932), 374-5, and 420-8, E. SEIDL reviews the work. The principal question is of the interpretation of the demotic marriage-contracts, which EDGERTON regards as purely patrimonial, the marriage itself being in Egyptian law simply consensual. SEIDL, on the other hand, thinks that they at any rate strengthened the marriage by securing almost penal advantages for the wife in the event of undeserved divorce, and that they perhaps even indicated marriage as against concubinage. There are parallels in Hammurapi and the Syro-Roman Lawbook. But he does not regard these patrimonial contracts as essential to marriage, so that he is prepared to admit that the ya'/os aypajos of Roman times may be a survival of national custom. At any rate the distinction 'yypaoos and aypaqos does not occur in Egyptian documents, and there is there no sure trace of grades of marriage. SEIDL ends by discussing the reading and interpretation of P. Tor. 18 (U.P.Z. 118). In his review of V. ARANGIO- Ruiz (above, B ii) he is of opinion that this writer's discussion of Egyptian marriage is superseded by EDGERTON'S. F. ZUCKER, in his already mentioned (B ii) review of P. Ross. Georg. III, comments on Pap. 28, which is the first fourth-century marriage-contract to come to light. vi. Monks. P. COLLINET, La regle de saint Benott et la legislation de Justinien, Rev. hist. rel., civ (1931), 272-8, draws attention to ch. 2 of Abbot CHAPMAN'S Saint Benedict and the sixth century (London, 1929), in which the relation of the Rule to Justinian's legislation was first observed and the conclusion drawn that the Rule must precede C. 1, 3, 46 (A.D. 530). Justinian, a western Christian like Justin, was in close relations with the Pope even before the reconquest of Italy; he may have obtained the Rule from the Pope or from St. Benedict; as for jurisprudence, so for the reform of eastern monasticism, the indefatigable legislator turned to the West. A. STEINWENTER, Byz. Mdnchstestamente, Aegyptus, xin (1932), 55-64, develops in greater detail one of the topics of his Die Rechtsstellung der Kirchen u. Kloster nach den Papyri, Z. Sav. (Kan. Abt.), xix (1930), 1-50 (Journal, xvn (1931), 135; xvmI, 94, 96). Byzantine legislation did not entirely deprive monks of power to dispose of their property mortis causa, and in any case only applied to regular coenobites in the full sense. It is clear that monks did make wills, for there are precedents in the Byzantine formularies, though examples of actual practice are few. The Egyptian examples are not against the law, because they are either anterior to Justinian or made by hermits; seldom by coenobites. In the twelfth to fourteenth centuries there are many Byzantine wills of monks, but nearly all in favour of the monastery. The wills of Superiors show a patrimonial conception of their rights over the monastery, but they may also be regarded, like the philosopher's wills, as exhibiting the birth-struggle of juristic personality (see above, B i). C. Law of property. See P. M. MEYER, Z. Sav., LII (1932), 391-4. Conveyance. The most important work for papyrologists is E. SCHONBAUER'S Rechtshistorische Urkunden- studien, Archiv, x (1931-2), 177-210; cf. Z. Sav., LII (1932), 340-2. Its accessibility justifies brevity here. The four sections deal respectively with P. Colomb. 480, P. Freib. III, 36/7, P. Ent. 14 and 15, and P. Dura 10, the connecting thread, apart from incidental excursus (B ii above), being the explanation of the prob- lematic dvav€Cuctso by the doctrine of Karaypairj which was propounded by the author in his Beitr. z. Gesch. d. Liegenschaftsrechtes im Altertum (1924). KaTaypafn' is based on the Greek principle that for the sale of certain kinds of property, regarded as of special social importance, the co-operation of the community through its organs was necessary. It was therefore not a mere registration of a private act, written or oral, but a registration of the seller's declarations to which the State gives its co-operation. The form is derived from the 0ooAoyiat of a party to a dispute made before the magistrate, which put an end to contentious procedure, but which, as P. Ent. I shows, were enforceable by execution. Compare (and contrast) in iure cessio. This requirement of public co-operation applied equally to hypothecation of catagraphable property, and hypothecation was at the date of P. Ent. I, 15 (P. Magd. 31) only allowed for a fixed term, probably one year. The creditor, if unpaid on the due date, could claim the thing as forfeit (eLKarafloA') without regard to excess-value, if any. But if he failed to exercise his right, the property would be freed, and he would be remitted to the ordinary process of execution of debt. Thus, if both creditor and debtor wished to adjourn the due date, either or both might have an interest in renewing the hypothec. Renewal was vavaewaLs, which, like the original hypothecation, required an act of public co-operation in the nature of Karaypaqq.</page><page sequence="21">§ 6. LAW 87 This would not be given without the agoranomus having satisfied himself of the existence of the antecedent hypothec between the parties and of the consent of both to renewal. P. Freib. III, 36-7 are documents of an avave'was; the reason for the petition to the king in P. Ent. I, 15 is that there was no time for avavaveams-, to which both creditor and debtor's heir were agreeable. P. Ent. I, 14 is a case in which eirtKarafoAXi had taken place upon property on which the petitioner's horse had happened to be quartered. In P. Dura 10 the hypothec of property is not general; it may be that it was of the debtor's invecta et illata (L. WENGER, Archiv, x (1931-2), 133). The acvavecQvacs clause, which probably covered the Trapaiov4j as well as the hypothec of property, can be explained quite simply by this doctrine of Ptolemaic avavE'auLs. The Egyptian papyri of the Roman period suggest that the doctrine had been modified in certain respects. In Zur Frage der Eigentumsiibergang beim Kauf, Z. Sav., LII (1932), 195-250, E. SCH6NBAUER uses his publicity principle for the solution of a vexed question of Roman law. F. PRINGSHEIM, as is well known, holds that the rule, that ownership of a thing sold did not pass to the buyer unless the price had been paid, was introduced into Roman law in the early Byzantine period, by reception from Greek law. As SCHONBAUER remarks elsewhere, the burning question of the Roman or Graeco-oriental character of Justinian's law can only be settled by further study of Greek law. Here he denies that the rule was Greek. A seller who allowed Karaypaq ' to take place before being paid must provide himself with an actionable acknowledgement of debt in the form of a fictitious loan. Mancipatio, like KaTaypafrj, embodied social control of alienation, but in it the exchange of the thing against aes weighed out was essential. But later Roman law diverged from Greek. The 12 Tables allowed expromissio (probably sponsio of a third party) as a substitute for payment; then the creation of the consensual contract of sale made the buyer debtor of the price, and the expromissor came to be regarded as security; expromissio was then generalized as any form of satisfactio, and finally, not later than Diocletian, property was allowed to pass if seller chose to rely merely on buyer's personal credit (fidem emptoris sequi). In Inst. 2, 1, 41 Justinian combines various strata of texts, but substantially he adopts the latest development. The original rule of the 12 Tables and its developments appear to have been applied to traditio. Still more purely Romanistic are three articles on the problem of the causal or abstract character of traditio (cf. Journal, xvii (1931), 137): J. HUPKA, Z. Sav., LII (1932), 1-30 (very conservative); F. SCHULZ, ibid., 535-49 (reviewing five recent works; radical); and E. SCH6NBAUER, K.V.G.R., xxv (1931-2), 136-218 (not yet digested; seems conservative). G. FERRARI, La donazione nei papiri di Ravenna, St. Riccobono, I, 457-83 (Palermo, 1932, offprint), reacts against some of H. STEINACKER'S doctrines in Die antiken Grundlagen der friihmittelalterlichen Privat- urkunde. In these documents, which date from the end of the fifth century, as in P. Lond. III, p. 254 (M., Chr., 367, sixth century), even nominal reservation of usufruct rendered traditio rei unnecessary for conveyance; this is Theodosian and earlier law, not a Byzantine anomaly. When usufruct was not reserved, traditio was necessary, but in Justinian's sense there was donatio perfecta by mere agreement to give, which was enforce- able by personal action (Inst. 2, 7, 2). Traditio cartae cannot be explained by the absolutio of Nov. 44, for it is found earlier. The fact that this act, put in high relief by the Ravenna documents, is not mentioned in eastern documents, does not prove that it did not take place in the East. It is a natural act in many cases, e.g. when the document is epistolary. Again, observance of the law of insinuatio at Ravenna and in Egypt does not prove that donation was perfected by insinuatio alone. Cf. Journal, xvi (1930), 138; xvii, 134. P. T(ORELLI) also, in Studi Medievali, nuova ser., 604-8 (offprint, n.d.), is decidedly critical of STEINACKER. The study of the function of writing in legal life is beyond the scope of diplomatic, which is merely an auxiliary discipline. So long as GNEIST'S doctrine of the pure consensuality of Greek contract and BRANDI- LEONE'S (Riv. Stor. Dir. Ital., I and ii) of the persistence of true stipulation in the West are unrefuted, the question of the dispositive nature of the Roman document is open. So also is that whether the exceptio non numeratae pecuniae is purely Roman or only a Roman formulation of a Greek idea (cf. J. C. NABER, Aegyptus, xII (1932), 247-8). There are other criticisms, but final judgement must be deferred till we have heard STEINACKER on the medieval period. P. S. LEICHT, Le ultime vicende della mancipatio in Italia, Riv. Stor. Dir. Ital., v (1932), 19-27, contends that the continuance of mention of mancipatio in Italy, according to locality, till the Bolognese renaissance, is a pure matter of routine and ignorance, and no proof that mancipatio and the distinction between res mancipi and nec m. survived after their suppression by Justinian and indeed by earlier desuetude. Real security. M. SAN NICOLO, Parerga Babylonica, I-v, Archiv Orientdlni (Journ. Czechoslovak Oriental Inst., Prague), iv (1932), 34-40, 179-92. The second of these studies (38-40) offers some material for com- parison; it notes the relative rarity in late Babylonian law of real security being substituted for personal</page><page sequence="22">88 BIBLIOGRAPHY: GRAECO-ROMAN EGYPT (1931-1932) liability; real security tends, in fact, to become mere security, additional to personal liability. Further and less remote material is supplied by the second of U. E. PAOLI'S studies in Attic law mentioned above (A iii, Greek law). D. Law of obligations. i. General. E. LEVY, Z. Sav., LIr (1932), 512-23, in a review of the Freiburg collection of PARTSCH'S posthumous and smaller works (Journal, xvmn (1931), 91), treats chiefly of the unfinished study of Synallagma. A very careful account of PARTSCH'S views is given, and the conclusion is reached that the developed Byzan- tine theory of synallagma had only a very limited importance. F. WEBER, Untersuchungen zum grdko-dgyptischen Obligationenrecht. Modalitdten der Leistung im Recht der Papyri (Munch. Beitr., Heft 15, 1932), starts from the position (A. B. SCHWARZ's against A. SEGRIE's) that in Graeco-Egyptian law performance of an obligation was a discharge of liability without further formality, and considers the question: when was performance effective ? Must it be rendered to the creditor, by the debtor, and at what time and place ? What was the effect of partial performance ? To which of several obligations of the same debtor to the same creditor was a performance, which did not satisfy them all, to be appropriated ? These Modalitdten form the subject of successive sections, which are preceded by a survey of sources and followed by a summary of conclusions, with excellent indexes. A cursory examination of the book makes a good impression. The conclusion is that the Gr.-Eg. law of contract was modern in character, and that the Romans found in Egypt substantially the same commercial law as their own. The solutions, for example, as to performance by a third party, or as to appropriation of payments are the same, and there is the same tendency to construe payment by a third party as purchase of the debt. In short, we have in Egypt a continuous development, to which neither the Roman conquest nor the Const. Antoniniana made much difference; divergences between local and imperial law are only occasional. Special attention is drawn to new conclusions in regard to depositum and to leases at will in late law (Journal, xiv (1928), 154). The third of M. SAN NIcOL6's above-mentioned (C, I.c., 179-88) Parerga Babylonica illustrates from late Babylonian documents the construction of substituted performance, datio in solutum, as sale, a construction which is found also in Hellenistic law, though some of the papyri, which are our chief evidence, have given rise to controversy as to what the underlying transaction really was: datio in solutum, sale with price prepaid, or a form of usury. Cf. F. WEBER, op. cit., 14 and R. TATUBENSCHLAG, St. Bonfante, I, 420. The construction as sale was ultimately admitted by Justinian, and the importance of the late Babylonian documents is that they suggest a persistence in nearer Asia of Babylonian ideas even through Roman times. Hellenization was probably superficial and temporary. Cf. above, A iii, Eastern Hellenistic law. ii. Sale. See above, C. Conveyance; also P. M. MEYER, Z. Sav., LII (1932), 386-8, noting new documents. M. SAN NICOL6. Parerga Bab., I (above, C, l.c., 34-8) announces the discovery in one or two Cappadocian documents (Eisser-Lewy) of a word,used in connexion with pledge, related to the Hebraic 'erabon, which, in spite of the traditionally Semitic origin of appaBco6v (arrha), has up to the present been the only parallel. It is suggested that the term may have been specially western Semitic. F. WIEACKER, Lex Commissoria. Erfillungszwang u. Widerruf im rom. Kaufrecht (Freib. Rechtsgesch. Abh., mi, Berlin, 1932). This book, treating of the very difficult subject of reservation by seller of right to call the sale off, if not paid by a certain date, has not yet been reviewed, but certainly it shows real talent and thorough training in modern critical methods. The conclusions with regard to the main lines of the Roman evolution do not appear to be revolutionary, but the handling of the embarrassing collection of texts in the Corpus luris is original. What most concerns us here is that the ultimate state of Roman law is explained as a result of Hellenistic influence (79-115). Hence a considerable treatment of Greek sale (89-103), which is mainly papyrological, but is too technically expressed for rapid summarization. The author follows PENGSIHEIM'S doctrine as to the introduction of the rule in Inst. 2, 1, 41, but unfortunately he could not join issue with E. ScaoiNBAuER's article in Z. Sav., Li (1932), 195-250 (above, C. Conveyance). No papyri appear to be cited by H. SCHEUER, Die Laesio enormis im rom. u. im modernen Recht, i, Z. f. vergleich. Rechtsw., XLVI (1932), 77-117. iii. Societas. Two important articles are to be noted: R. TATUBENSCHLAG, Die societas negotiationis im Rechte der Papyri, Z. Sav., iL (1932), 64-77, and A. STEINWENTER, Aus dem Gesellschaftsrechte der Papyri, St. Riccobono, I, 487-504 (Palermo, 1932, offprint). The first is a systematic survey of the sources, the second raises special points. Both deal with partnership for the farming of public taxes and land, for farming private land, and for trade and handicraft. STEINWENTER differs from M. ROSTOVTZEFF, Gesch. der Staats- pacht (Philologus, Suppl. IX, 1902) as to the relation of the ,ET'oXot of the dpXcdvrjs to the Ptolemaic State,</page><page sequence="23">§ 6. LAW 89 holding that they were directly liable to the State and distinct from the Eyyvot. He also draws attention to a group of cases in which it is difficult to say whether there was partnership, colonia partiaria, or both. In the Byzantine partnerships between artisans he notes the express mention of affectus societatis and the fact that the standard of care is culpa in abstracto. iv. Depositum. In Phil. Woch., LII (1932), 1078-84 (Festschr. Poland, 133-40), W. SCHUBART summons the use of irapalKaTartEa9aL and related terms in the papyri to the aid of the interpretation of the will of Ptolemy the Younger of Cyrene (below, H). C. SPIcQ, Rev. bibl., XL (1931), 481-502, adopts the same course in regard to the vapaOKrq of 1 Tim. vi, 20; 2 Tim. i, 12, 14, but carries his point too far. v. Dialysis. A. STEINWENTER, Das byz. Dialysis-Formular, St. Albertoni, I, 73-94 (Padua, 1932, offprint), applies the diplomatic method recommended by H. STEINACKER to dialysis, which for his purpose he under- stands with PARTSCH primarily in the sense of contract for ending or avoiding a lawsuit. Such contracts, in sixth-seventh century papyri, agree in external form with early (Justinian) and later Byzantine law. They agree also in style with the Byzantine literary formularies (scholia of Basilica), but the coincidence does not extend equally to the substantive law. What is the source of the documentary unity ? Hardly imitation by the eastern Empire generally of the practice in Egypt, as supposed by A. SEGRE in sale, nor yet imperial constitutions, but rather the influence of the law schools, which is seen, for example, in the Byzantine formulary of the stipulatio Aquiliana (cf. P. Lond. 2017). We must omit many interesting details. vi. Delict. . RABEL, Z. Sav., LII (1932), 466-81, in the course of a dissenting but appreciative review of F. DE VISSCHER'S Etudes de droit romain (Journal, xvn (1931), 138; xvII, 98), differs from him both as to the interpretation of P. Hal. I and as to the development of theth actio iniuriarum noxalis. The book is favourably reviewed by B. BIONDI, Bull. Ist. Dir. Rom., XL (1932), 225-41 (see 236 ff.), and by R. MONIER, Rev. hist. dr., xi (1932), 161-3. The connexion between the KImj aiKLaa and the actio iniuriarum (aestimatio in bonum et aequum) is considered by F. PRINGSHEIM, Z. Sav., LII (1932), 86 ff. E. Law of succession. See P. M. MEYER, Z. Sav., LII (1932), 375-7, especially for new documents; also above, B i and vi. E. KORNEMANN, Elterliche Teilung f. d. Todesfall, Archiv, x (1931-2), 213-15, publishes P. Giss. Inv. 255 in advance of P. Giss. II. Of the reign of Hadrian, it is a division of property (lAepLIa: cf. H. KRELLER, Erbrechtliche Untersuchungen, 242; M., Chr., 306) made by a mother between her two sons, with effect post mortem. F. DE ZULUETA, Reichsrecht ou Volksrecht dans le P.S.I. 1027?, Rev. hist. dr., xi (1932), 491-501, accepts H. A. SANDERS'S view that the tablet is the first of a diptych (Journal, xvmi (1932), 98), and contends that the testatio in question is a record of proceedings which can be explained by pure Roman law. His chief point is that very young children were allowed to make cretio, of course with auctoritas, as soon as they could speak, before they could understand (D. 29, 2, 9). M. DAVID, Uber die Form des ordentlichen, schriftlich abgefassten Privattestaments zur Zeit des Dominates, Z. Sav., Lii (1932), 314-25, deals with a neglected subject. In the legal texts of the period we find civil and praetorian wills distinguished. It is explicable by classical law that the former require 5 and the latter 7 witnesses, but what was the determining difference? Not the solemnization of the mancipatio familiae, which was quite dead, but possibly that the civil will was holograph and the praetorian allograph. The papyrological evidence is assembled p. 318, n. 1. The same writer's Studien zur heredis institutio ex re certa (Leipzig, 1930) are briefly summarized by R. MOmNEB, Rev. hist. dr., xi (1932), 163-4, and papyrological points in them are picked out by P. M. MEYER, Z. Sav., LI (1932), 377. F. Lawcourts and procedure. See P. M. MEYER, Z. Sav., LI (1932), 395-407, where a full account is given of E. BERNEKER'S and E. SEIDL'S books (both Journal, xviI (1932), 99). Attention has been drawn (A iii, Demotic law) above to the latter's Die demotische Zivilprozessordnung, etc. A point of procedural terminology is cleared up by U. WILCKEN, Archiv, x (1931-2), 246-7, in his Referat of P. Ent. II, 64 (8tK,V ypaaa60aL) and 74 (SK11v A'yeLv). R. DULL, Der Giitegedanke im r6m. Zivilprozessrecht (Journal, xvin (1932), 99), has been reviewed shortly by E. GRUPE, Phil. Woch., LII (1932), 843-5, and F. J. KLEIN, Archiv R. u. W., xxv (1931-2), 567-8. H. LEVY-BRUHIL, Rev. hist. dr., XI (1932), 777-81, is more critical; indeed the conception of the praetor's function advanced by him in various well-knownstudies is diametrically opposed to DiTLL's. E. SCHONBAUER'S article, Z. Sav., Li (1932), 251-81, bears the same title as this book, and is in part a review of it. While agreeing that the original role played by the State in private suits was not that of the bracchium saeculare of the private interest and that cases were more often than not settled in iure, SCH6NBAUER holds that the State's purpose was not conciliation (Giitegedanke ?), but order. DULL carries WLASSAK'S doctrine of the N</page><page sequence="24">90 BIBLIOGRAPHY: GRAECO-ROMAN EGYPT (1931-1932) original nature of the exceptio too far and too late. There is no parallel between the intermediate arbitral sentence of the iudex in an actio arbitraria (which is the peculiar feature of such actions) and the decision of the Greek SaMrrTjnS, which was final, though subject to eULats. R. DULL, Uber die Bedeutung des Verfahrens de piano im r6m. Zivilprozess, Z. Sav., LII (1932), 170-94, combats the idea that de piano means simply not pro tribunali, and that de plano and in transitu (Gaius, 1, 20) are interchangeable. The sources show that de pilano is connected with minor matters delegated to the court-staff; it developed ultimately into the institution of iudices pedanei (XaAatLKaa-rai', xa,iadev, de plano). P. COLLINET, La procedure par libelle, Et. hist. sur le droit de Justinien, iv, Paris, 1932. This substantial volume, which is the first detailed study of the libellary procedure as a whole since BETHMANN-HOLLWEG, requires a special review. We note here the emphasis laid on the new evidence, especially the documents of P. Oxy. xvi and P. Lips. 33 and 38. The conclusions are not lacking in originality and will provoke discus- sion; they are the fruit of much reflexion and meticulous study of the texts. Undoubtedly the book fills a long-felt want. G. Criminal law. See P. M. MEYER, Z. Sav., LII (1932), 394-5, and M. SAN NICOLO, ibid., 295-6, noting P. Oslo. II, 17 (A.D. 136) as new evidence of the application of flogging even to free persons in criminal procedure; cf. P. Oxy. 1186 (fourth century B.C.). E. CUQ, Le rescrit d'Auguste sur les violations de sepultures, Rev. hist. dr., xi (1932), 109-26, maintains his interpretation of the Nazareth (?) inscription against L. WENGER'S (Journal, xvrI (1932), 100, etc.); see now the mainly summarizing article (two textual suggestions; full literature) of F. DE ZULUETA, J.R.S., xxII (1932), 184-97. H. Public law. That the organization of the Macedonian army throws light on the early Ptolemaic constitution was maintained by E. SCH6NBAUER, Z. Sav., XLIX (1929), 345 ff. (Journal, xvi (1930), 134). F. GRANIER'S Die Makedonische Heeresversammlung (Munch. Beitr., Heft 15, 1931, not seen) has had several short reviews. P. TREVES, Riv. di fil., LX (1932), 397-402, does not accept the contention that the original constitution survived in the orientalized monarchies of the Diadochi. U. KAHRSTEDT, G.G.A., cxcrv (1932), 208-11, makes the same criticism, but regards the collection of materials as valuable, as does W. W. T[ARN], J.H.S., LI (1931), 307. C. OLIVERIO, La Stele di Tolomeo Neoteros re di Cirene (Documenti antichi dell'Africa italiana, I, Cirenaica, 1. Bergamo, 1932). The interest of this inscription is political: cf. § 4, but because of its form it has an accidental legal interest. On this aspect see L. WENGER, Zum Testamente des Ptolemaios Neoteros von Kyrene, St. Riccobono, I (?), 529-48 (Palermo, 1932, offprint), E. BICKERMANN'S review in Gnomon, vmt (1932), 424-30, and U. RATTI (t) Note sul testamento di Tolomeo Neotero, Riv. di fil., LX (1932), 375-7. Cf. above D iii. The only substantial question is whether the 7TapaKa.rawr0K was meant to and did take effect in Ptolemy's lifetime. The legal answer can only be negative: so WENGER, though U. RATTI, in a very sensible argument, dissents. But this isent a political gesture, not a legal act. On the flovuA-papyrus, P.S.I., x, 1160, see § 4. J. STROUX and L. WENGER'S book on the Augustan Cyrenean inscription (Journal, xvII (1930), 100, etc.) is the subject of a learned review by A. FLINIAUX, Rev. hist. dr., x (1931), 715-24. E. LEVY, Zwei Inschriften auf den Jurist Maecianus, Z. Sav., LII (1932), 352-5, draws attention to C.I.L., xiv, 5347, 5348, which confirm the fact, already practically proved by papyri, that the jurist L. Volusius Maecianus was prefect of Egypt at the end of Pius' reign and at the beginning of the next. His interesting career is commented on. P. M. MEYER, Z. Sav., LII (1932), 381, cites new documents and literature (including EHRENBERG, Hermes, LXV, 337 ff., not seen) on the Ptolemaic terms Stayparnta and 7TpoUTay/La. Cf. E.

KENYON'S Books and readers in ancient Greece and Rome (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1932, pp. vii+ 136) is the outcome of three lectures delivered at King's College in 1932. He deals with the use of books in Greece and Rome, the history of the roll and codex, and the use of papyrus and vellum as materials.

Bibliothekswiss., I (1931), cap. II, 27-149 is also inaccessible to me. 8. LEXICOGRAPHY AND GRAMMAR. PREISIGKE'S Worterbuch is reviewed by C. J. KRAEMER in Cl. Weekly, xxiv (1931), 149 f. (not accessible to me). LIDDELL AND SCOTT Part VI, A-ot, pp. 1021-1200, has appeared; Parts V and VI are reviewed by P. MAAS in J.H.S., LII (1932), 150-2, Part V by P. SHOREY in Cl. Phil., xxvii (1932), 177-8. GRADENWITZ'S Heidelberger Kontrdrindex der griechischen Papyrusurkunden is reviewed by W. SCHUBART in O.L.Z., 1932, 770-1; by H. I. BELL in Cl. Rev., XLVI (1932), 44; by G. COPPOLA in Boll. fil. class, xxxvm (1932), 193 f.; by K. F. W. SCHMIDT in Phil. Woch., 1932, 322-5; by P. COLLART in Rev. de phil., ser. 3, vi (1932), 405-6; and by W.

MAYSER'S Grammatik der griechischen Papyri I and II 1 is reviewed by G. N. HATZIDAKIS in Byz.-Neugriech. Jahrbiicher, ix (1932), 203-4. A. GROHMANN'S article, Griechische und lateinische Verwaltungstermini im arabischen Aegypten, in Chron. d'Eg., vii (1932), 275-84, is not accessible to me (see § 4). D'ARCY W. THOMPSON has contributed an essay On Some Greco-Egyptian Bird and Beast Names to Griffith Studies, 249-53. W. SCHUBART'S article, IIapaKa-ra-riGeaOa in der hellenistischen Amtssprache, in the Festschrift fiir Franz Poland = Phil. Woch., 1932, 35(8), 133-40, is a discussion of the meaning of this word in the testament of Ptolemy Euergetes II and of the purport of the whole document (see also §§ 4, 6, D iv). In Cl. Rev., XLVI (1932), 12, W. B. SEDGWICK discusses the phrase 7oAAa 7roAAcv (Pap. Oxy. 744) without being aware that his conclusions were anticipated by EINAR HTnTRTET in Eranos, xvI (1917), 91-6. The complete title of the dissertation by H. GLITSCH which was mentioned in Journal, xvIn (1931), 141 is De Ptolemaei et Apollonii, Glauciae filiorum, chartis quaestiones linguisticae, and it is a study of papyri contained in WILCKEN'S Urkunden der Ptolemderzeit, vol. I. F. ZUCKER has reviewed it in Gnomon, viIn (1932), 577-84. H. LJUNGVIK, Beitrdge zur Syntax der Spdtgriechischen Volkssprache (Skrifter utg. av K. Humanist. Vetenskaps-Samfundet i Uppsala, 27: 3), Uppsala and Leipzig, 1932, is not yet accessible to me. It is favourably reviewed by G. GHEDINI in Aegyptus, xII (1932), 381-2; by R. M. DAWKINS in Cl. Rev., XLVI (1932), 236; by P. S. COSTAS in Cl. Phil., xxvI (1932), 2934, and by A. DEBRUNNER in Indogermanische Forschungen, L (1932), 255. E. C. COLWELL, The Greek of the Fourth Gospel, Chicago, 1931, is devoted to proving that the idioms of this gospel which have been claimed as Aramaisms are found in papyri which are free from Aramaic influence and must be admitted to be genuine Greek. The book is favourably reviewed by P. S. COSTAS in Cl. Phil., xxvII (1932), 193-5. G. GHEDINI reviews, in Scuola Cattolica, LVII (1930), 81-90, LIX (1931), 315-24, several works on the Greek of the N.T. or on similar subjects. In Byz.-Neugriech. Jahrbiiher, vii (1931), 317-26 the late CARL WESSELY has given a sketch of the language of the Zenon Papyri, with the object of showing that the beginnings of many modern Greek developments can be observed in them. K. F. W. SCHMIDT mentions in Phil. Woch., 1932, 323, footnote, that he has long been engaged on a Kontrdrindex der griechischen Sprache arranged on the same plan as PAPE'S Etymologisches Worterbuch der griechischen Sprache, i.e. by grammatical categories, and within these by alphabetical order beginning from the end of the word. 9. GENERAL WORKS, BIBLIOGRAPHY, MISCELLANEOUS NOTES ON PAPYRUS TEXTS. W. G. WADDELL has published a very pleasant paper on The lighter side of the Greek papyri: A talk to the St. Andrew's Society, Cairo, Egypt (C. F. Cutter, Low Fell, near Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 1932. Pp. 21, 1 plate). J. MANTEUFFEL publishes, in Polish, another article of a general character: Rozwoj i potrzelz papyrologji, in</page><page sequence="26">92 BIBLIOGRAPHY: GRAECO-ROMAN EGYPT (1931-1932) Nauki Polskiej, xv (1932), 287-90. For an article by P. G. RABEAU on Les enseignements des papyrus: Christianisme et sociologie see § 2, Christian. Reviews of the Kontrdrindex are referred to in § 8 above. M. HOMBERT has continued his excellent Bulletin papyrologique in Byzantion, vi (1931), 722-36 (part v, for 1930) and vII (1932), 433-56 (part vi, for 1931-2). The bibliography in B.Z., xxxII (1932), 146-251, 395-477, is valuable as usual; papyri are dealt with on pp. 157-9 and 406-9. K. PREISANDANZ'S Zur Papyruskunde (Handbuch der Bibliothekswissenschaft, ed. FRITZ MILKAU, , (1931), cap v, pp. 300-31) will be found useful not only as a general survey but in particular from a bibliographical point of view. M. HOM- BERT in his Projets de bibliographie papyrologique (Chron. d'Eg., vII (1932), 227-36), read to the Section of Papyrology at the Leyden Congress of Orientalists, sketches the plans formed by himself and VAN HOESEN, with the collaboration of S. DE RIccI, for the projected international bibliography on slips, which, I am glad to be able to record, has now become a reality. See too Bibliographie papyrologique sur fiches in Rev. belge, xi (1932), 393-4 (not accessible to me). BILABEL'S Berichtigungslisten, ii, 1, and Sammelbuch, Iv, are reviewed together by E. KIESSLING in D. Lit.-Z., 1932, 1499-1503. In his Varia (Symb. Oslo., x (1932), 153-6) S. EITREM deals with the following documentary papyri: 63. S.B. 6944; 64. B.G.U. 372; 65. P.S.I. 1055; 68. P. Oxy. 119; 72. P. Oxy. 44 = W. Chrest. 275. J. C. NABER proposes new readings for several of the Cairo Zenon papyri in Ad papyros quosdam Cairo-Zenonianos (Aegyptus, xni (1932), 48-54, 243-9); but EDGAR, on the strength of an examination of the originals by GUERAUD, points out (ibid., 371) that many of these suggestions are irreconcilable with the papyrus evidence. 10. MISCELLANEOUS, EXCAVATIONS, PERSONAL. In Z. Sav., LII (1932), 552-5, E. SEIDL publishes a Bericht iiber den 18. internationalen Orientalisten- kongress zu Leiden (7-12 Sept. 1931), following this with the Entschliessung iiber die Edition koptischer Papyri und Ostraka. The papers read in the papyrological section are published in Chron. d'Eg., vii (1932), and several of them have already been referred to in their proper place. The following general surveys of work done or in contemplation call for mention here: N. HOHLWEIN, Notes sur quelques papyrus inedits du Caire, 317-23; H. I. BELL, Papyrology in England, 134-6; K. KALBFLEISCH, Die Fortschritte der Arbeit an den Giessener Papyri, 151-2; FR. BILABEL, Uber den Fortschritt der Arbeiten an neuen Heidelberger Papyrus- Unternehmungen, 311-16; L. WENGER, Mitteilung iiber den Stand der Miinchner Papyrussammlungen, 335- 48; L. AMUNDSEN, Papyri and papyrology in the Scandinavian countries, 324-31; A. CALDERINI, Proposta per la compilazione di un censimento delle persone nominate nei documenti dell'Egitto greco-romano, 258-61; FR. HEICHELHEIM, Bericht iiber ein Papyrusverzeichnis nach Gauen, Archiven und Jahrhunderten geordnet, 137-50; A. STEINWENTER, Ein Vorschlag zur Publikation koptischer Rechtsurkunden, 153-6. With these articles may be classed, though it appeared elsewhere, a survey by M. HOMBERT of papyrology in the United States of America: Les Etudes papyrologiques aux Etats-Unis, in Bull. des Alumni, iii (1932), 229-34. The same number of Chron. d'Eg. contained (262-9) B. A. VAN GRONINGEN'S Projet d'unification des systemes de signes critiques, in which, following up the brochure of BIDEZ and DRACHMANN on the unification of editorial usage in the matter of critical signs and apparatus criticus, he outlines a scheme suitable for use alike in papyri, inscriptions and literary texts. Elsewhere in the number H. I. BELL (Note on methods of publication, 270-1) accepts VAN GRONINGEN'S scheme and pleads for greater uniformity in certain other matters of editorial usage; and A. S. HUNT (A note on the transliteration of papyri, 272-4) unfavourably (and, in the present writer's opinion, very justly) criticizes the practices of (a) dotting letters within square brackets, (b) underlining broken letters. On pp. 285-7 (Essai d'unification des methodes employees dans les editions de papyrus) are stated the conclusions arrived at by the Congress. WILCKEN in Archiv, x, 211-12, Das Leydener Klammersystem, accepts the new system, and so does A. CALDERINI in Aegyptus, xii (1932), 276-9 (Unificazione dei metodi usati nell'edizione deipapiri). The proposals are also stated by VAN GRONINGEN in Mnemosyne, LIX (1931), 362-5 (De signis criticis in edendo adhibendis). Ev. BRECCIA has published a very useful survey of the museum over which he presides: Le musee greco- romain 1925-1931 (Municipalite d'Alexandrie, Istituto italiano d'arti grafiche, Bergamo, 1932, pp. 102, 62 plates). BOAK and PETERSON'S Karanis (Journal, xvii, 103) has been reviewed by J. A. 0. LARSEN (Cl. Phil., xxvII (1932), 420); Ev. BRECCIA (Bull. Soc. Arch. d'Alex., 27, 78-83); D. ZUNTZ (Gnomon, viii (1932), 107-9); D. M. ROBINSON (Journ. Am. Or. Soc., LII (1932), 63-5); and H. I. BELL (Mizraim, I (1933), 187-8).</page><page sequence="27">§ 10. MISCETLLANEOUS, EXCAVATIONS, PERSONAL 93 Ev. BRECCIA has published (Ann. Serv., xxxI (1931), 19-24) a Rapport sur les fouilles de la "Societa Italiana per la ricerca dei papiri greci e latini" a Oxyrhynchos et a Tebtynis (1928-1930). Several obituaries have been mentioned in § 6 above. The following call for mention here: On WILAMOWITZ-MOELLENDORFF by WILCKEN (Archiv, x, 314); on WESSELY by H. GERSTINGER (Aegyptus, xII (1932), 250-5), WILCKEN (Archiv, x, 314-15), and J. CAPART (Chron. d'Eg., viI (1932), 115-16); on SPIEGELBERG by J. CAPART (ibid., 116-17) and CL. P[REAUX] (ibid., 117-18); and on DESSAU by A. STEIN (Klio, xxv (1932), 226-44).</page></plain_text>
