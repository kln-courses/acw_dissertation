<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK LIST philology in the "notes" (Murphy is usually conservative about textual emenda- tion, finding the chief difficulty in elucidating the work's often obscure vocabulary), whereas the "interpretation", both introductory and verse-by-verse, is concise by comparison. Murphy has published articles on the Song of Songs at regular intervals since 1954. This commentary, which represents the mature fruit of a lifetime's study, is a distinguished contribution to a prestigious series. [H.G.M. WILLIAMSON] L.

NIEHR, Rechtsprechung in Israel. Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der Gerichtsorganisation im Alten Testament. Stuttgarter Bibelstudien 130. 144 pp. Verlag Katholisches Bibelwerk, Stuttgart, 1987. DM 29.80. There have been many studies of O.T. law and its relationship to law in the rest of the ancient Near East, but surprisingly few on the processes of law and the organization of courts of justice. A monograph which deals exclusively with these latter topics is therefore particularly welcome, the more so because of the widespread use of legal ter- minology in biblical literature generally. Niehr begins with a brief consideration of general studies of legal systems and the methodological problems raised by the O.T. source-material. An account of the different legal systems attested at Mari, in Assyria and Babylon and in the remainder of Syria and Canaan then provides the context for a study of the development of legal institutions in Israel. In the "egalitarian tribal society" of the pre-monarchic period (for which Exod. xx 22- xxiii 19 is argued to provide some reliable information) Niehr holds that the pater- familias and the elders (representatives of the heads of clans) dealt with most cases, though some were referred to priests for resolution by ritual means. He finds no solid evidence for the existence of individual "judge"-figures at this time. The monarchy at first brought about only minor changes to this system, as the king's jurisdiction was limited to his immediate entourage. Only under Josiah were state judges introduced to replace the priestly jurisdiction at the defunct "high places". After the exile the "heads of fathers' houses", representing the clans, took over the roles previously exercised by the elders and paterfamilias, and the legal authority of the Jerusalem priesthood was greatly augmented. The imperial authorities were generally content not to intervene. A bibliography and an index of biblical references complete a work which offers both a synthesis of earlier study and a provocative fresh reconstruction of Israelite legal history. [G.I. DAVIES] S. OLOFSSON, God is my Rock: A Study of Translation Technique and Theological Exegesis in the Septuagint. Coniectane Biblica, Old Testament Series 31. x + 208 pp. Almqvist &amp; Wiksell International, Stockholm, 1990. S. Kr. 178. This is a revised version of an Uppsala dissertation (1988). While the author has much to say about theological exegesis in the LXX in general, he is mainly interested in the Psalter. Ch. 2 deals with claimed instances of anti-anthropomorphism and anti-anthropopathism in the Greek Psalter and concedes much less to theological exegesis than have Olofsson's predecessors in this area. Most of the spadework for the volume is done in the longer chs 3 and 5, in which the translation of metaphorical designations of God ("rock", "shield", "refuge", etc.) and dif- ferent types of metaphorical divine names ("mighty One", "most high", etc.), respectively, are discussed. The last of the main chapters looks at possible backgrounds for the translation of divine names and epithets in the LXX. The work is thoroughly indexed, and there are six tables setting out translation equivalents under a number of headings. The author shows awareness of a wide 287</page></plain_text>
