In invoking 'normal conditions' CN, Malzkorn is dissenting from my claim that we ought to speak only of ideal conditions for the manifestation of a disposi- tion, and that because these will be relative to a specific context, we cannot form a reductive conditional analysis that employs them.2 Malzkorn's proposal fails, in my view, for a reason which I have already suggested elsewhere (mentioned by Malz- korn on p. 457). I shall describe this reason more fully. A finite list of normal conditions in which a disposition is to be tested cannot guarantee the manifestation of the disposition, because there remains the possibility of some further condition that interferes with the process and prevents the mani- festation. Malzkorn (p. 458) suggests that empirical science could provide us with the list L of normal conditions for a disposition D, in which case L determines CmD. He says little about the form L must take. Suppose it is a simple list of types of states of affairs (C1, C2, C3, ... , C). My claim is that each item may be realized, but the mani- festation R may still not occur during or after test T because of the presence of an interfering condition CF1. It could be the case that Dx, t, that Tx, t and that CWjc, t, t + 8, but still not be the case that Rx, t + 8 because CFI; hence the proposal does not analyse Dx. 1 W.

He does tell us that the problem of excluding interfering conditions is by no means specific to disposition ascriptions (p. 457), and that the normal conditions will be those that are normal in the actual world (p. 458), but these points do not address the objection directly. Can the objection be answered? Can we claim, for instance, that CoD auto- matically excludes CF, because CFG is not a normal condition relative to the disposi- tion D? I suspect, but do not assert, that this is the claim Malzkorn would favour, as he seems to think (p. 464) that normal conditions 'preclude' electro-finks and other such possibilities.3 But I do not see how Co can exclude CF1. For Malzkorn's pro- posal to be an analysis, he needs conditions CADj that are specifiable. My claim is that if the list of C" can be specified, then it can be defeated: that is, CM can be satisfied (each item in the list L can be true) but the manifestation can still fail to occur for some x that is D and is tested, because CFI is also the case. The only strategy I can envisage to avoid this problem would be as follows. First, allow negative truths into L, so that we have --CF1 among our list. This is already controversial, as some writers doubt whether there are truth-makers for negative truths: hence it may be ques- tioned whether -,CF, has a legitimate place in L. But even if we allow negative truths, and CF, is excluded by this move, there may be some other interfering con- dition CF that L does not exclude. No matter how many such conditions we list in L, some further interfering condition is possible. For practical purposes, that is as far as the strategy can go. But theoretically, and secondly, we could list in L every fact in the world, to make sure we have included everything that could possibly stop the disposition from manifesting. However, that would still not guarantee (entail) that R would follow when T, unless we also include a higher-order 'fact of totality', that these are all the facts there are. Some think this is an acceptable move,4 but even if so, Malzkorn's claim (p. 460) that this is a simpler conditional analysis than that which Lewis has offered would look under threat, as Lewis' analysis does not have to invoke higher-order facts.5 Is there some such condition as CF1 available to defeat every disposition manifest- ation? Possibly not. Some dispositions of basic particles may manifest indefeasibly, whenever their stimulus conditions are realized. But I doubt that Malzkorn's analysis is designed solely for these, which are more likely the exceptions than the rule. His analysis is meant to be general, so it fails. I have argued previously only for context-sensitive ideal conditions that cannot be part of a reductive conditional analysis. The reason for preferring ideal to normal con- ditions is that disposition ascriptions can sometimes be made in quite abnormal conditions, as when we say things are fragile at very low temperatures. Malzkorn objects (p. 459) that just about everything is fragile at very low temperatures, so that the ascription becomes practically trivial. He may be right in this case, but all that it shows is that there must be better examples. The speculation appeals to me that much of what we call technology depends upon setting up some artificial 3 A 'fink' makes a disposition vanish the moment it is tested: see C.B.

Some examples: oil will yield petrol, but only during a carefully controlled manufacturing process; petrol powers an engine (which is a carefully controlled environment that converts burning petrol into motion and then propulsion); diseases administered in accurately measured doses, at an appropriate age, produce immunity, though uncontrolled ex- posure produces illness; metals can become molten and be reshaped; we can ascribe dispositions to elements which exist only under artificial conditions, and the same is true of certain subatomic particles which are isolated and tested only in the unique environment created at CERN. There is no shortage of further examples. Malzkorn does not say exactly what 'normal conditions' means. Plausibly, it could mean either naturally occurring conditions, or commonplace conditions. Whichever of these one opts for, I am quite sure that useful and plausible disposition ascriptions can be found which are not normal in that sense. I am, however, willing to allow that normal and ideal may coincide in some cases. This means, on my interpreta- tion, that the ideal conditions are those naturally or commonly occurring. This leaves just one other objection brought against ideal conditions (p. 459): that a disposition concept D, in my account, seems to be a different disposition in differ- ent contexts. My answer is that D is a single concept when its ideal conditions are unspecified, but when one begins to fill in the detail of the ideal conditions, one is then speaking of a more precise disposition concept. This is no more mysterious than that there is one concept 'tall', even though what it is to be tall for a man and tall for a giraffe are likely to be different heights.6 For the reasons given against Malzkorn's notion of normal conditions, we cannot specify ideal conditions in which any disposition manifestation is guaranteed, and this is why I remain sceptical about the prospects for a reductive conditional analysis. Having argued specifically that Malzkorn's conditional analysis fails, and that in any case he has not provided sufficient reason to reject my ideal conditions as the background against which disposition ascriptions are made, I turn now to a more general issue in his paper, his professed realism. It may well be possible to reconcile realism with a conditional analysis, notwith- standing my objection that Malzkorn's particular analysis fails. However, I am not convinced that Malzkorn's realism is of a kind that most realists would endorse. A realist theory of dispositions allows that a disposition's existence is logically inde- pendent of the occurrence of any test or manifestation, to which we can add that some dispositions may be beyond our power to test, and that some may be beyond our conceptual scheme and hence beyond our knowledge completely. I am doubtful that Malzkorn would sign up to this much realism. His first sentence (p. 452) de- clares his starting-point, that a disposition is a property to give a particular response to a particular test (of course testing and conditional analyses often go hand in hand). Further, his second adequacy condition for conditional analyses (p. 461) is that we must not imply that T or R are actually realized at the time D is ascribed; but he does not go as far as to say that Tand R need never be realized. 6 See D.H. Mellor, 'The Semantics and Ontology of Dispositions', Mind, Io9 (2000), PP. 757-80, at pp. 759-60, for a pertinent discussion of this issue.

The attraction is manifest when Malzkorn says (p. 456) that we have no epistemic reason to ascribe being red to a chameleon sitting in the dark on a green baize cloth, because whenever it is exposed to light it becomes green (let us suppose instantaneously). The realist accepts that some property of the chameleon makes it red whether or not it passes the test for redness. The realist, therefore, would allow dispositions to which we have no epistemic access; but I am not sure that Malzkorn would allow them, and certainly his six adequacy-conditions for a conditional analysis (pp. 461-2) are not designed to accommodate them. Making the presence of dispositions dependent upon the passing of tests is a kind of anthropocentrism, of which Malzkorn accuses me in respect of abstract dispositions. I allow that such things may exist, and offer divisibility by 2 as an example (Dispositions, pp. 165-7). However, I do not have a 'long since abandoned anthropomorphic con- ception of mathematical functions' (Malzkorn, p. 462, fn. 12). I think that mind- dependent acts of division can test whether a number is divisible by 2, but the abstract power of the number resides in one of its standing properties, which we can call its being even. A number has this property whether or not we test for it. We no more create the property by testing for it than we create solubility by testing for it. I conclude that, although there is much of interest and insight in Malzkorn's paper, he does not provide us with a tenable new theory of dispositions. University of.Nottingham</page></plain_text>
