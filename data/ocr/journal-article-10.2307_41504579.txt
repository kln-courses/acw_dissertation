<plain_text><page sequence="1">Toward an Iconography of Tristan Tzara By Ellen Sharp Curator of Graphic Arts Two portraits of Tristan Tzara (1896-1963) ac- quired in recent years by The Detroit Institute of Arts and another Tzara portrait in the Winston- Malbin collection, acquired while Lydia Winston Malbin was living in Detroit, are part of a rich mine of material which exists concerning Tzara's activity, not only as a chief catalyst of the Mouve- ment Dada and a Surrealist poet, but also as an art critic, editor, collector, and social activist.1 Throughout his life, Tzara was a prolific writer of poems, plays, and essays on literature.2 His poetry was usually first published in a limited signed edi- tion with illustrations by a major 20th-century ar- tist. The list of artists who have illustrated his work is impressive - Arp, Braque, Dali, Sonia De- launay, Ernst, Giacometti, Gris, Kandinsky, Klee, Laurens, Léger, Marcoussis, Masson, Matisse, Miró, Picabia, Picasso, Tanguy, and Villon.3 Most of these artists were close personal friends of Tzara and have left us their impressions of the poet in the form of portrait drawings. If we were to assemble all these works and were also to include portrait photographs, we would have an imposing iconography. To discuss all these portraits, however, is not within the scope of a Bulletin article. Indeed, it would be a formidable task just to compile a list of them, locate the own- ers, and obtain record photographs. Moreover, because of the manifold aspects of Tzara's cre- ativity, any comprehensive study of the poet would involve a complex investigation not only of the avant-garde literature of the 20th century but also of the plastic arts. Therefore, this essay which utilizes some of the most interesting of the por- traits of Tzara can serve only as a brief introduc- tion to his extraordinary career. Tristan Tzara was the pseudonym adopted by Samuel Rosenstock who was born in 1896 to a prosperous family in Moinesti, Rumania. As a boy, he was a precocious student with an aptitude for mathematics. He loved music, especially Bach, and played the piano. French was a second lan- guage for him as it was for many cultivated Ruma- nians at that time. This early orientation toward France and French culture was significant for the future of Dada as Tzara was naturally drawn to Paris rather than to Berlin or New York. FIGURE 1.

After attending high school in Bucharest, he en- rolled at the University in the colleges of mathe- matics and philosophy. However, neglecting his studies, he became more and more involved with poetry. His parents frowned on his Bohemian friends and, to remove him from distracting, un- wholesome influences, sent him abroad to study in the autumn of 1915. Ironically, their son's in- volvement there with Dada would be far more scandalous and make him far more notorious than his relatively innocent student activity. Tzara's first published work, under the name of S. Samyro, appeared when he was 1 6 in a periodical which he founded in 1912 with his friends, the poet Jon Vinea and the artist Marcel Janeo. Later he used the name Tristan Ruia or simply signed his name Tristan. Tzara (meaning terre, land) was added later and first appeared in the Rumanian review The Call on October 4, 191 5, shortly after Tzara left Bucharest for Zurich. He had set out to study in Paris but, when Rumania entered the war, was forced to stay in Switzerland. 191</page><page sequence="2">192 His use of the name Tristan was obviously literary in origin, having romantic overtones of Arthurian legend and the great medieval legendary cycles of France and Germany. However, as Gordon Browning has expressed it, "After Zurich (1916- 1919), after a change in literary sensibility, Tzara and his name are bound by the assonant staccato Dada-Tzara and associated irrevocably with the expressions of the Dada and Surrealist move- ments."4 In Zurich, Tzara found other artists who were war exiles like himself such as his countryman Marcel Janeo and the Alsatian Jean (Hans) Arp. A bastion of the financial world and of the phil istine haute bourgeoisie, this Swiss city would seem an un- likely place in which to launch a revolutionary movement in literature and the arts. However, here surfaced all the flotsam of the upheaval caused by world war - conscientious objectors, war profiteers, double agents, refugees, deserters, revolutionaries. "In the most obscure of streets in the shadow of architectural ribs, where you will find discreet detectives and red street lamps,"5 the pacifist writer Hugo Ball opened the literary nightclub Cabaret Voltaire at No. 1 Spiegelgasse. Here in February of 1916 Dada was born. Across the street, only a few doors away, lived another celebrated revolutionary, Vladimir 1 1 y ich Oulianov, called Lenin. Legend has it that Tzara and Lenin played checkers together at the Cabaret Voltaire but, in fact, the Russian and the Dadaist had little contact with each other.6 Dada was con- cerned with literature and the arts, not with poli- tics. It grew out of the young artists' concern with abstract art, their revolt against bourgeois taste and their disenchantment with a world and its governments which permitted the slaughter of men. The only political position they took was against war; they supported the Russian revo- lutionaries because they felt that only drastic changes in the social structure would bring peace to the world. The young men who formed the Dada group brought to Zurich not only their pacifist ideals but also a knowledge and enthusiasm for the innova- tions which avant-garde artists were making in the various European capitals. Hugo Ball and Richard Huelsenbeck had been active in the Expressionist movement in Germany. Arp had been in Paris and was familiar with the Cubist innovations of Picasso and Braque. "Tzara, the romantic interna- tionalist whose propagandist^ zeal we have to thank for the enormous growth of Dada, brought with him from Rumania an unlimited literary facil- ity."7 Tzara also was in contact with the Italian poet Marinetti, the leader of Futurism. When in the archetypal Dada manifestation of 1919 in Kaufleuten Hall in Zurich, Tzara had 20 persons simultaneously reciting his poem The Fever of the Male , he was using a technique which the Futurists had already employed in their manifesta- tions. Hans Richter, the German artist who joined the Dadaists in Zurich in 1916, cogently expres- sed Dada's debt to Futurism. ". . . Futurism was one of the main arsenals from which Dada drew its weapons."8 But however much they borrowed from other avant-garde movements, the Dadas abjured all "isms." They never used the term Dadaism but referred to their movement as Mouvement Dada or simply Dada. More than one of the founding fathers have laid claim to the discovery of the name Dada.9 Tzara was said to have come upon the word (a child's name for a hobby horse) while leafing through a French dictionary. Dada made a cult of childishness to oppose the supposedly ma- ture world's foolishness. Opposed to tradition, Dada wanted to revive wonder, humor, spon- taneity, unpredictability, and to disregard con- ventional concepts of symmetry and measure. Be- yond their innovations in literature and the plastic arts, Dadas championed complete freedom for the individual. The Dadaists' provocative procla- mations, their manifestations, were intended to involve the spectator. Any reaction, even nega- tive, was preferable rather than a passive accep- tance of what occurred on stage. In their efforts to revitalize and extend language and the plastic means of expression, Dadaists turned to new sources of inspiration such as Afri- can and Oceanic art. Dada writers broke all rules of conventional grammar and punctuation. They employed a fragmented typography like that of Futurists, fashioned outrageous metaphors and preposterous similes. In painting, a method of au- tomatic drawing, perhaps inspired by the doodling of Paul Klee, was evolved by Arp. He would take a pencil and allow his hand to move freely without looking at the paper. The outlines so achieved would then later be filled in with ink. In the Winston-Malbin collection there is an automatic drawing by Arp (Fig. 1), executed in 1918, which is a portrait of Tristan Tzara.10 Far from being a realistic likeness, it nevertheless captures the lively personality and the spirit of the poet. Another portrait of Tzara done a year earlier is one of Hans Richter's so-called "visionary portraits" (Fig. 2). Richter states that these portraits were cre- ated spontaneously as if in a trance at the hour when lights begin to fade and one is engulfed by dreams. He used a brush for these ink portraits trying to capture the spiritual essence of a person- ality. The problem was for him not to investigate</page><page sequence="3">physical or psychological phenomena but to cre- ate a structure of forms.11 In addition to automatic drawings, Arp also pro- duced at this time a series of collages and reliefs under the collective title Compositions According to the Laws of Chance. For his collages, he is re- ported to have dropped pieces of paper on a ground and then pasted them on cardboard júst as they had fallen. A comparable technique is de- scribed in Tzara's recipe for composing an "acci- dental poem." Take a newspaper. Take some scissors. Pick out an article which is as long as you wish your poem to be. Cut out the article. Then cut out carefully each of the words in. the article and put them in a bag. Shake gently. Then take out each piece one after the other. Copy them down conscientiously in the order in FIGURE 2. Tristan Tzara, 1917, Hans Richter, American, born Berlin (b. 1888); brush in black ink, 10% x 5Vi in.

The poem will resemble you and you will find yourself to be an infinitely original writer with a charming sensitivity even though you will not be understood by the vulgar.12 The Cabaret Voltaire lasted six months. Hugo Ball left Zurich and leadership of Dada gravitated to Tzara. Dada plays, poetry readings, lectures, and exhibitions continued in Zurich at different loca- tions including Waag Hall and the Gallery Corray. The journals Dada 1 and Dada 2 were published in July and December 1917. Tzara's 25 Poems illustrated with woodcuts by Arp appeared in July 1918. After an initial period of excitement and great ac- tivity, doldrums set in for Dada. Huelsenbeck left for Germany and Ball, who had reappeared on the scene, disappeared once again. There were no public Dada manifestations from July 1 91 7 to July 1 91 8. Tzara kept up an extensive correspondence with artists and writers in Europe and America, but his letters indicate that he was in a nervous, de- pressed mood. He felt alone and discouraged. However, a letter dated August 21, 1918 which Tzara wrote to Francis Picabia marked the begin- ning of the rejuvenation of Dada.13 Although it is usual to consider Zurich as its birthplace, Dada was actually symptomatic of a world-wide malaise engendered by World War I. A similar New York movement was underway practically contemporaneous with the Swiss man- ifestations. Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray, and Picabia were its principal leaders. In February 1918, Picabia went to Lausanne for medical treatment. He, too, was suffering from nervous depression. The poems he published there14 came to the attention of the Dada group and prompted Tzara's letter in which he asked Picabia to contri- bute to the Dada review. Picabia agreed to do so and also sent a copy of his journal 391. An ex- change of letters between the two men led to gradually increasing rapport and finally to Picabia's three-week visit to Zurich in January and February of 1919. In December 1918, a month before Picabia's arri- val in Zurich, Dada 3 was published. Already Tza- ra's return to high spirits - the influence of contact with a kindred spirit - is evident. Bold red letters identify Dada 3 and directly below them is Tzara's name, now featured according to his importance as the real regisseur of Dada (Fig. 3). An aura of excitement is created by the radiating lines of black type. Vulgar commercial references are no longer genteely relegated to the inside. The price of the publication is printed conspicuously on the 193</page><page sequence="4">194 cover. Placed at the bottom of the sheet, it admi- rably balances the design of the cover. On the inner pages of Dada 3, all sizes and sorts of type faces are exuberantly mixed as though some naughty child had been allowed to play with the printer's type box, or so it would have seemed to eyes accustomed to conventional typesetting of the day. The lead article of Dada 3 is the Dada Manifesto of 1918, first read by Tzara in Zurich on July 23, 1 91 8. For Dada 3, he prepared a specially-revised text written with precision and passion: We must sweep and clean. Affirm the cleanliness of the individual after the state of madness, aggressive complete madness of a world abandoned to the hands of bandits who rend one another and destroy the centuries. . . . Free- dom: Dada Dada Dada, a roaring of tense colors and interlacing of oppo- sites and of all contradictions, grotes- ques, inconsistencies: LIFE.15 Picabia too was roused out of his depression and began to draw and paint after two years' neglect. One of the reasons he was drawn to Zurich was Tzara's suggestion that an exhibition be staged in Zurich of Picabia's latest works. Jean Arp wrote about the excitement and curiosity which he and Tzara felt as they went to meet Picabia for the first time. On their arrival at his hotel, they found him FIGURE 3.

Arp commented with typical wry Dada irreverence that it reminded him of Rembrandt's Anatomy in the museum in Amsterdam. Picabia dipped the disassembled parts in ink and stamped them on paper. He then finished the drawing with a few lines and added his signature. This historic document is now in the Winston-Malbin collection (Fig. 4). It was used as the inside cover of the Anthologie Dada (Dada 4-5). The alarm clock is a familiar Dada icon, symbolizing Dada effort to arouse their contem- poraries. William Rubin has suggested that, in tak- ing apart the famed Swiss national product, noted for the precision of its assembly and the elegance of its appearance, Picabia was mocking the establishment.16 The alarm clock is especially ap- propriate in this instance, for it marks the reawa- kening of the Dadaists. The impact of the meeting of Tzara and Picabia was to be of the greatest importance for the future of Dada. Picabia wanted Tzara to accompany him to Paris and, when he returned to the French capital in March 1 91 9, continued his urgings by letter, offer- ing a room to the impecunious Tzara. But Tzara could not quite yet bring himself to leave Zurich. In April of 1919, he staged one of the most flam- boyant of the Dada soirées at Kaufleuten Hall and in May of 1919, Dada 4-5 appeared. Its design continued the innovations of Dada 3. Pages of bright pink, orange, and blue papers are in- terspersed with white. The organic shapes of Arp's woodcuts are particularly effective on these colors. The three musketeers of the Parisian Dada/Surrealist movement, André Breton, Louis Aragon, and Philippe Soupault, each have a poem in Dada 4-5. 17 Breton and Soupault were working at that time on the important texts which were eventually published under the title Magnetic Fields. The first chapters appeared in October, November, and December of 1919 in Littérature , the Paris review they had founded with Aragon. The publication of Tzara's Manifesto of 1918 in Dada 3 had had a decisive effect on Breton and his friends. Its spirited attack on formalism in the arts and its praise of the spontaneous struck a re- sponsive chord with them. The Parisian poets were in need of a new direction, for two of their leading mentors had died recently - Guillaume Apollinaire and Jacques Vaché. Breton, who liked to create myths, to weave a mystique around an unusual personality, began to build much of the same aura around Tzara. By the end of 1919 most of the war refugees had left Zurich. The electric ambience of the city of the war years had disappeared. Dada no longer had the power to shock or interest the Zurich public.</page><page sequence="5">FIGURE 4.

By its very nature it was a movement which quickly ran its course. Tzara must have realized it was time to move on. One morning early in January 1920, without ad- vance warning, he presented his card at the door of the apartment of Picabia's mistress Germaine Everling, this being the Paris address Picabia had given him. Since Tzara had no place to stay and no money, Mme. Everling could not but admit him and allow him to remain. Breton and his friends had been impressed with the moral grandeur of Tzara's Manifesto of 1918; they had read his poems and found them remark- able and beautiful. Tzara's name alone conjured up for them romantic literary associations. When Breton, Aragon, and Soupault arrived later at Mme. Everling's, they were disconcerted to dis- cover that this small dark man who spoke French with a Rumanian accent which sounded atrocious to Parisian ears was Tristan Tzara. A portrait draw- ing by Robert Delaunay (Fig. 5) records the bulldog-like countenance of the Tzara of this period with his large expressive mouth and shock of black hair falling over his forehead. The poet stares at us with a penetrating cyclopian gaze through the monocle he usually wore to correct his extreme myopia. But whatever may have been the initial consternation of the Parisian poets upon their first view of Tzara, it quickly disappeared for Tzara immediately took charge. He prepared to launch Dada in Paris with all the weapons he had developed in Zurich. The poets associated with Littérature were ready for a new cause to which they might direct their youthful enthusiasm. Tzara's arrival was happily timed for they had already projected a public pro- gram for January 23. It was decided to incorporate Tzara into the program and to make it a surprise appearance. Tzara, accurately gauging the anti- German feeling then in Paris and knowing that his Rumanian accent was often mistaken for Teutonic, decided that he would read a fragment of newspaper during which an electric bell would 195</page><page sequence="6">FIGURE 5.

Sonia Delaunay. 196 be sounded continually to prevent the audience from hearing what he was saying. He described the event as follows: The debut of Dadaism in Paris took place on the twenty-third of January, at the matinée organized by the Dadaist review Littérature. Louis Aragon, ... A. Breton, . . . and G. Ribemont- Dessaignes . . . gave readings from their works. Picabia . . . exhibited a number of pictures, one of which was a drawing done in chalk on a blackboard and erased on the stage; that is to say, the picture was valid for only two hours. As for me, announced as 'Dada/ I read aloud a newspaper article while an electric bell kept ringing so that no one could hear what I said. This was very badly received by the public, who became exasperated and shouted: 'Enough! Enough!' An attempt was made to give a futuristic interpretation to this act, but all that I wanted to con- vey was simply that my presence on the stage . . . anything I might have said really had no importance.18 Tzara realized that Dada manifestations must not fall into a set pattern. He used a variety of means to draw attention to Dada in his new head- quarters. False rumors were circulated to lure the press and the public. As in Zurich, specially- designed posters were published. Papillons (Fig. 6), small rectangles of thin paper with Dada aphorisms composed by Tzara and Paul Eluard, were printed in black on papers of different colors, red, green, yellow, and orange. They were scat- tered about Paris at night, posted on walls, even in public urinals. Two Dada publications were issued in 1920, Bul- letin Dada (Dada 6) and Dadaphone (Dada 7). Picabia published two issues of his new review Cannibale in the first of which his diagrammatic portrait of Tzara was featured (Fig. 7). Littérature</page><page sequence="7">FIGURE 6.

Private collection, Detroit. published 23 Dada manifestos in May and be- came completely an organ of Dada. The supreme Dada event of the year took place on May 26 at the Salle Gaveau. Tzara had a new advertising ploy for this - sandwich men to roam about Paris with boards emblazoned with out- rageous Dada announcements such as "all the Dadiasts will have their hair cut onstage." The Salle Gaveau, a prestigious hall where fine con- cert music was usually performed, and located in the elegant Saint-Honoré quarter of Paris, was de- liberately chosen as an incongruous setting for a Dada manifestation. The organ on which Bach and Mozart were usually performed was to be used to play jazz and fox trots at intermission. Among the events scheduled on the program was a performance of Tzara' s play The Second Celes- tial Adventure of M. Anti py ri ne. The audience came prepared to heckle, howl, and to pelt the performers. Tzara reported: "For the first time in the history of the world, people threw at us, not only eggs, salads and pennies, but beefsteaks as well. It was a very great success. The audience were extremely Dadaist. We had already said that the true Dadaists were against Dada."19 Another outstanding Dada event of 1920 was the preview of the Max Ernst exhibition organized by André Breton at the Galerie Au Sans Pareil on May 2. 20 It included not only painting but also collages. In the Winston-Malbin collection is one of these proto-Surrealist works which Mrs. Malbin ac- quired directly from Tzara (Fig. 8). Entitled Sitting Buddha , it is an anatomical engraving altered with pen and gouache. It represents one of the many variations which Ernst developed from the collage technique.21 It, like many of Ernst's early collages, shows the influence of Picabia's machinist draw- ings with its use of inscription and mechanical apparatuses. Ernst's technique is, however, more delicate and precise. His machine-like beings anticipate the strange anthropomorphic creatures of his later Surrealist work. These collages have been recognized as the immediate visual sources of Surrealism. The medium was not used as the Cubists had em- ployed it to reinforce plastic elements in the com- position. The juxtaposed images serve rather as poetic stimulants, suggest correspondences, and reveal a dreamlike surreal order which transcends conventional concepts of space, scale, and perspective. At the time of the Ernst exhibition, Duchamp and Arp were virtually unknown in Paris. Picabia was the official Dada artist. But Breton found the metaphysical, ordered Ernst more compatible with his artistic philosophy, and Michel Sanouillet has suggested that he organized the Ernst exhibition to give Picabia some competition.22 A certain mor- 197 Un autre : TAISEZ'VOUS, le DADA ж Société Anonyme pour langage n est pas stenosteno, l'exploitation du vocabulaire. ni ce qui manque aux chiens !

The year 1 921 was critical for Dada in Paris as the group divided into two factions - the Bretonists who advocated organization and discipline, and the fiercely individualist Dadaists like Tzara and Picabia who found hierarchy foreign to Dada. In the early spring, Dada announced it was planning a series of excursions in Paris. It wished to remedy a situation created by "the incompetence of guides and suspect cicerones" who subjected the public to learned tours of historic monuments. In mockery of tradition, they proposed tours of ordi- nary Parisian sites. The first scheduled visit was to the abandoned church of St. Julien-le-Pauvre. Un- fortunately, it poured rain and the excursion was a flop. The very absurdity of the situation appealed to Tzara and to his mind made the event a Dada success. Breton was of another opinion. He would have liked the event to be menacing, for those present to have experienced a heightened sense of reality, not for it to have turned into a facetious, mocking Dada event. There were no more Dada excursions A brief, harmonious interlude occurred in the fall of 1921 when Ernst, Arp, Tzara, Paul Eluard, and Breton came together for a few idyllic days in the Austrian Tyrol, resulting in the last important Dada publi- cation, Dada au grand air. The estrangement FIGURE 7.

January and April of 1 922 saw Breton's attempts to organize the Congress of Paris which was to be an international congress for the determination of di- rectives and the defense of the modern spirit. Tzara refused to participate because he felt any attempt to codify Dada was against its very spirit. He was attacked by Breton, and the split between Dada and Surrealism was now irreparable. Certain aspects of Dada, however, were seminal in the development of Surrealism and were to re- main important elements in both Surrealist poetry and Surrealist art. For poetry, automatic writing; exploitation of the unconscious and chance; sex- ual and anti-clerical attitudes. For art, fusion of unrelated objects as in the collage medium; inter- est in the art of the insane, of children and of primitive cultures; the use of found objects. As Lucy Lippard has colorfully expressed it, Surrealism was "house-broken Dada."23 By 1 923, Dada was really dead. It had no tribunal for Littérature was now completely under the con- trol of Breton, who published the Manifesto of Sur- realism in the journal in 1924. Tzara, however, accepted this turn of events for, as with Zurich Dada, he realized that the movement had run its course. Tzara seemed to relish growth and change all during his career. In an interview only a few days before his death in 1963, he chided André Breton for not realizing Surrealism had seen its FIGURE 8.

Tzara said that one must know how to termi- nate a movement when it had come to the end of its usefulness and that Breton was artifically pre- serving a movement that had become decadent.24 The Dadaists made a last attempt in July of 1 923 to make their presence felt on the Parisian scene. The event was entitled "Soirée du Coeur à Barbe" and Tzara's play Gas-Operated Heart (Le Coeur à gaz) was performed. There were also showings of films by Man Ray, Charles Sheeler, and Hans Richter and music by Erik Satie and Darius Milhaud. Bre- ton and Aragon seemed to have been determined to provoke a disturbance. Breton at one point was expelled by the police while Eluard continued the demonstration during the performance of Tzara's play. Fist fights broke out and continued outside the theater after the performance. Tzara and Eluard came close to appearing in court over the matter. It was a sad outcome to an intense friendship and the whole affair was a cause of regret to both men in later years. The event, how- ever, was needed to bring out into the open deep- seated rancours and opinions which had not been fully expressed. Six years later, Tzara formally joined the Surrealist movement. In Ernst's collage of 1 930, Loplop In- troduces the Members of the Surrealist Group , he occupies an important position next to Dali at the very center of the composition (Fig. 9). The golden twenties with the apogee of Dada and its rapid absorption by Surrealism marked a time of fashionable success for Tzara. He was seen fre- quently at the chic cabaret Boeuf sur le Toit and regularly attended the Count of Beaumont's Soirées de Paris where in May 1924 his play</page><page sequence="11">Cloud Handkerchief (Mouchoir de nuages) was performed. In 1925, he married Greta Knutsen, the beautiful daughter of a wealthy Swedish indus- trialist, a painter and poet in her own right. They set up housekeeping in a house in Montmartre designed for them by the distinguished modern architect Adolf Loos. The youthful elegance of Tzara at this time is seen in the photograph by André Kertész (Fig. 10 and Back Cover) recently acquired by The Detroit Institute of Arts. Kertész left Hungary in the early '20s and settled in Paris where he soon came to know leading figures in the art world. A series of fine portraits of Parisian artists date from this time. Kertész recalled that his was not a deep friendship with Tzara but that a certain sympathy existed be- tween them because of their similar European backgrounds.25 Theirs was the type of easy rela- tionship that often developed in the casual cafe life of Montparnasse. Kertész asked Tzara if he might visit him and take his portrait. One of the photographer's motives for this request was his desire to see Tzara's house, which was the talk of Paris.26 It is tempting to dwell upon the glamorous aspects of Tzara's life in the 1 920s, but it would be doing the poet a great disservice to overemphasize this aspect of his career. As Mary Ann Caws points out in the introduction to her recent translation of Tzara's major poetic works: "Tzara's situation in French literature is unique: he is the only poet who has left us a vast body of significant material from both the dada and surrealist epochs."27 Elmer Peterson, in an earlier study which concentrates on the poet's theoretical writings, reinforces this view. He argues that Tzara should not be thought of simply as the leader of Dada, that "his work from 1 924 through the end of World War II estab- lishes him as one of the major surrealist poets along with Breton and Eluard, and with Breton and Aragon as one of the most lucid interpreters of this movement."28 Tzara's poetic masterpiece, Approximate Man (L'Homme approximatif , 1931), was completed during his Surrealist period as well as his great prose poems The Antihead (L'Antitête, 1933) and Seeds and Bran (Crains et issues , 1935). He had been working on sections of Approximate Man as FIGURE 10. Tristan Tzara , 1927, André Kertész, American, born Hungary (b. 1894); photograph, silver print, 9% x 8 in. Elliott T. Slocum Fund (74.49). 201</page><page sequence="12">early as 1925. The poem is a modern Odyssey, an "epic interior pilgrimage" as Mary Ann Caws has described it29 in which imperfect man or ap- proximate man struggles for, but never attains, his ideal. During these years Tzara also wrote numerous ar- ticles on art and artists for magazines and weeklies such as Cahiers d'Art and Lettres Françaises , as well as prefaces to exhibition catalogues. His principal subjects were primitive art, the work of his Dada friends (Arp, Eggeling, Man Ray, Schwit- ten) and the School of Paris artists (Picasso, Matisse, Miró). Some of Tzara's finest essays are devoted to the work of Pablo Picasso30 for whom he felt a special affinity. In many respects, Picas- so's development parallels Tzara's own poetic evolution. Like Tzara, Picasso denied traditional forms of representation and sought to enlarge man's comprehension of nature. Tzara stressed the work of art as experiment and invention and like Picasso never adhered to one particular style. He placed emphasis on the creative act rather than on the product of art. Ideologically, too, Tzara's concerns were close to Picasso's. After joining the Surrealists in 1929, Tzara was formally associated with the group for FIGURE 1 1 .

In the early 1930s, he became active in Communist organizations and finally joined the party in 1947 when he was naturalized as a French citizen. As a young man, Tzara had opposed World War I. His Dada high jinks had concealed a deep concern with morality and the human condition. The horrifying events of the decade beginning with the burning of the Reichstag in 1933 and continuing with the brutal persecution of the Jews and the Spanish Civil War had a profound effect on Tzara. He came to be- lieve that poetry must serve social ends. At the 1937 Second International Writers Conference in Valencia, he gave an important speech on "The Individual and the Conscience of the Writer," in which he warned that the writer, if he wishes to survive as such, must take a political stand.31 Later during World War II, Tzara was active in the French Resistance with the National Writers Committee. Tzara and his wife were separated in 1939 and divorced in 1942. The breakup of his marriage, the tragic developments in Europe culminating in a second World War brought about a change in Tzara's life style as well as a profound réévalua- tion of his philosophy of life and art. The mature Tzara is seen in a Giacometti portrait of 1 949 (Fig. 1 1) received as a gift to the Institute from Dr. and Mrs. Barnett Malbin (The Lydia and Harry Lewis Winston Collection). Also received was a copy of the limited edition of Tzara's poem of 1949, Phases , with a similar lithographic portrait of the author as a frontispiece (Fig. 1 2). In the Giacometti portraits, spectacles have replaced the monocle which had been his distinguishing mark; the black shock of hair has become gray; sartorial elegance seems no longer of any particular concern. It is a wise, mellow man with a quizzical gaze who emerges from the febrile lines of Giacometti's lithographs. In Tzara's work of the 1940s and 1950s much of the pessimistic strain which permeates earlier poems such as Approximate Man has been eradi- cated. In a lecture at the Sorbonne in 1947, Tzara saw the Surrealists as overcome with despair at the duality of man and world. He called for a hu- 203</page><page sequence="14">204 manistic hope in the power of man to create his own destiny.32 His work became more positive and optimistic as the titles of two 1955 poems indicate, At Full Flame (A haute flamme) and The Good Hour (La bonne heure). During the last years of his life, Tzara concen- trated his energies on scholarly research into the writings of François Villon and Rabelais. Both manuscripts have remained unpublished. In a tribute to the poet written shortly after Tzara's death on Christmas Eve 1963, Louis Aragon mov- ingly recalled the last time he saw his friend on the Saturday before Christmas. Tzara was under an oxygen tent, paralyzed, unable to speak, and barely able to see. Tzara's son had been reading to his father from the Rabelais work. Tzara, mortally ill, nevertheless managed to signal for the manu- script and point out an error.33 When Tzara died in 1963, the obituary notice in The New York Times noted that he had not been much talked about in recent years.34 For several years after his death, there was surprisingly little attention paid to his achievements. However, since 1970, there has been a revival of interest in the poet. In this country, important publications such as those by Mary Ann Caws and Elmer Peter- son have appeared.35 Tzara has been the subject of several doctoral theses.36 In 1975, the first volume of his complete works, edited by Henri Béhar, was published in Paris.37 To celebrate this event, the literary review Furope devoted an entire issue to Tzara including a few unpublished works as well as essays covering the varied aspects of his career.38 It is hoped that the Tzara renaissance will result in a major book-length study of this excep- tional man.39 NOTES 1 . My thanks to the following scholars who have taken time from their busy schedules to reply to my letters and answer questions. The reader of these notes will realize the debt I owe to the research and publications of Lionel A. Biron, Gordon Browning, Mary Ann Caws, Elmer Peterson, and Michel Sanouillet. In securing photographs, Sonia Delaunay and Denise René have been most helpful. Above all, my gratitude to Lydia Winston Malbin whose drawings and books and reminiscences of the poet were the inspiration for this article. 2. Readers will be able to grasp fully the scope of Tzara's achieve- ment when the project to publish his entire oeuvre is completed by Flammarion. One volume of the seven projected has appeared - Oeuvres complètes, Tome I (1912-1924), ed. Henri Béhar, Paris, 1975. 3.

Quoted from a letter from Gordon Browning to Ellen Sharp, November 1973. 1 am indebted to Mr. Browning for information on Tzara's early poems and Tzara's use of a pseudonym.

The leading characters in Tom Stoppard's prize-winning play Travesties (first produced in London in 1974 by The Royal Shakespeare Company) are Lenin, James Joyce, and Tzara. These three men were all in Zurich during the war but there is no evidence that they ever met. Stoppard's play is brilliant fiction. 7.

This drawing by Arp and other works by Picabia and Ernst from the Winston-Malbin collection discussed in this article were in the personal collection of Tzara and acquired directly from him by Mrs. Malbin. 11. Concerning the Dadas' exploitation of chance, Richter wrote: "Chance appeared to us as a magical procedure by which one could transcend the barriers of causality and conscious volition, and by which inner eye and ear become more acute, so that new sequences of thoughts and experience made their ap- pearance. For us, chance was the unconscious mind that Freud discovered in 1900." Richter (note 8): 57. 12.

The account given in their article of the alarm clock incident is taken from a letter to Lydia Winston Malbin from Marguerite Arp, May 20, 1968. A slightly different account is given by Gabrielle Buffet-Picabia, "Some Memories of Pre-Dada: Picabia and Duchamp," The Dada Painters and Poets (note 5): 266. 17. See Lionel A.

Mr. Biron corrects an assumption by previous writers that Dada 4-5 marked the first time that the three French poets collaborated with Dada. A poem by Soupault appeared in the French edition о f Dac/a 3and other evidence indicates that he was in contact with the Zurich Dadaists as early as 1916. 18.

In most Dada chronologies, the year of the Max Ernst exhibition at Au Sans Pareil is given as 1921. However, in Max Ernst, Beyond Painting , New York, 1 948, the invitation to the preview is reproduced (p. 12) and the year is 1920. Ernst himself when quoting from Breton's introduction to the exhibition states that the year was 1920 (p. 13). 21. Ernst later commented on the inaccuracy of using the term col- lage for many of his works that are so described. He stated that in most of his "collages" there wasn't any glue at all. He also stated that he was not responsible for using the term, that of the 56 works in his first Paris exhibition only 1 2 could with justification be called collage or découpage. He continued: "One rainy day in 1 91 9, finding myself in a village on the Rhine, I was struck by the obsession which held under my gaze the pages of an illus- trated catalogue showing objects designed for anthropologic, microscopic, psychologic, mineralogie, and paleontologie dem- onstration. There I found brought together elements of figuration so remote that the sheer absurdity of the collection provoked a sudden intensification of the visionary faculties in me and brought forth an illusive succession of contradictory images . . . "These visions called themselves new planes, because of their meeting in a new unknown (the plane of non-agreement). It was enough at that time to embellish these catalogue pages, in paint- ing or drawing, and thereby in gently reproducing only that which saw itself in me, a color, a pencil mark, a landscape foreign to the represented objects, the desert, a tempest, . . . thus I obtained a faithful fixed image of my hallucination and trans- formed into revealing dramas my most secret desires - from what had been before only some banal pages of advertising. "Under the title 'La Mise sous Whisky-Marin' I assembled and exhibited in Paris (May 1920) the first results obtained by this procedure, from the Phallustrade to the Wet Nurse of the Stars.

Mr. Sanouillet dedi- cated his comprehensive account of the Dadas in Paris (see note 13) to Tzara, paying tribute to the massive collection of literary documents which the poet had amassed, the record of an extraordinarily rich life as correspondent and collector. 205</page></plain_text>
