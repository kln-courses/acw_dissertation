<plain_text><page sequence="1">Poisoned Animal, Polluted Form: Chamoiseau's Birds at the Limits of Allegory Richard Watts University of Washington A language and a style are blind forces; a mode of writing is an act of historical solidarity. A language and a style are objects; a mode of writing is a function: it is the relationship between creation and society, the literary language transformed by its social finality, form considered as a human intention and thus linked to the great crises of History. (14) - Roland Barthes, Writing Degree Zero Ecocriticism, understood broadly as the search for the meaning of the non- human world in texts of all kinds, continues to open exciting avenues of inquiry. Textual elements previously backgrounded by critics- plants, animals, landscape- are no longer simply treated as functions of context or setting but are now read as the material base of existence in which the human is unavoidably imbricated. Moreover, as the awareness of anthropogenic environmental change expands, we increasingly turn to contemporary literature, cinema, and music for responses to global warming or environmental toxicity and scrutinize cultural texts from the past for their articulation of the environmental crises of the moment or their anticipation of problems to come. On the whole, though, ecocriticism and animal studies -the field in which this essay intervenes- have not been sufficiently attentive to the ways in which changes in form and genre can be read as indicators of new or different relations to the non-human world. Greg Garrard's chapter on animals in his updated state-of-the-field book Ecocriticism is concerned with human-animal thematics and their ethical implications, but not at all with form; in this way, it accurately reflects most of the work being done in the field (146-80). My essay argues, among other things, that form, genre, and mode and their current disruptions are potent markers of change in human-animal relations and, more broadly, of anxiety regarding global environmental change. I do this by focusing on allegory and the function of animals in the works of Martinican author Patrick Chamoiseau, a key figure in francophone postcolonial studies, whose latest novel evinces a dramatic reordering of human-animal relations at the level of both content and form. Chamoiseau's novel also suggests how relationships with the non-human world and the types of representation they engender are informed by the legacies of colonialism. Capturing the full reach of a text such as Chamoiseau's requires, in fact, the conjuncture of two approaches - ecocritical and postcolonial - since in his narrative about animals and toxicity, form, genre, and mode are put to 177</page><page sequence="2">178 Richard Watts the service of representing environmental degradation in a place whose relation to environment is structured precisely by the colonial past and the postcolonial present. Narrating Vanishing Cultures ... and Animals Over the course of a literary career that now spans close to thirty years, nearly all of the novels and even some of the works of non-fiction by Patrick Chamoiseau have deployed the figure of the author-narrator "Chamoiseau," recorder of and participant in the vanishing cultural traditions of Martinique.1 In the novels, the self-reflexive figure of the author-narrator moves among those whose stories he tells, presenting himself as having access to but also standing partly outside of the Martinican subaltern culture that the extradiegetic author Patrick Chamoiseau typically takes as his subject. While the author-narrator figure occasionally plays a central role in the unfolding of the plot of the novels, he is also marked as an "observer" watching from the outside. For example, in Solibo magnifique (1988; Solibo Magnificent , 1997) "Chamoiseau" becomes a suspect in the death of the storyteller Solibo, but here and in his other novels the tools of his trade as recorder of fictionalized ethnographic ephemera- his omnipresent notebooks, the unreliable tape recorder he uses in Chronique des sept misères (1986; Chronicle of the Seven Sorrows, 1999) - indicate his double status, as does, of course, this character's connection to the author by their shared name.2 Even in those narratives where the presence of "Chamoiseau" is reduced to just a punctual use of the first- person "je" [I], the author-narrator's voice nonetheless works to insert the narrative into a contemporary frame and connect it to current social problems, as in the historical novel L'esclave vieil homme et le molosse (1997; Old Man Slave and the Attack Dog) that renders a slave's escape from an eighteenth-century plantation in Martinique.3 The recurring use of the character of the author-narrator is one of the hallmarks of Chamoiseau's writing and can be seen as central to the appreciation and critique of the works. In a general way, "Chamoiseau," or at least the narrative "je," brings to light the (normally obscured) mechanisms of authority in fiction in a manner typical of both postmodern and postcolonial aesthetics. Much of the scholarship on Chamoiseau comments on the positioning of the author-narrator as an instrument of narrative resistance to the norms of the inherited European culture of the novel. The author-narrator character provides an ironic measure of ethnographic authority, since the "je" here belongs to the group whose stories he is telling. This trope of the culturally proximate narrator works well in Chamoiseau's narratives because they are ultimately most concerned with the transition of Martinicans from</page><page sequence="3">Poisoned Animal , Polluted Form 1 79 objects in the colonial archive to subjects with creative agency in the postcolonial present. But Maryse Condé, originally from Martinique's neighboring island Guadeloupe, has in fact accused Chamoiseau and other writers belonging to the Créoliste movement of provincialism, which is to say excessive cultural and linguistic localism (305-10). Chamoiseau shows in Biblique des derniers gestes that he can write well beyond the borders of Martinique. But what of other limits and borders? Can works with a foregrounded author-narrator whose very effectiveness lies in his proximity to his subjects reach beyond human concerns or cross the so-called species barrier? Because we have oriented our readings of postcolonial literatures toward cultural politics for so long, this question has hardly come up. It has not seemed important or even relevant until now to suggest that Chamoiseau' s positioning as amateur ethnographer situates the works in the realm of overwhelmingly human concerns, which is to say the realm of the cultural, with all the anthropocentric freight the term typically carries.4 Patrick Chamoiseau' s most recent novel, Les neuf consciences du malfini [2009; The Hawk's Nine Levels of Consciousness], constitutes a significant departure from his well-established narrative template and forces the reader to reconsider the role of the author-narrator. The novel presents an encounter between a hawk and a hummingbird in a corner of forest some ten kilometers north of Fort-de-France, Martinique's largest city, and follows their survival of an ecological calamity until the ultimate conversion by the hawk to the hummingbird's way of being in the natural world. Humans are present, but very intermittently and in relatively undefined form. The author-narrator character "Chamoiseau," for his part, maintains only a vestigial presence in the text; in fact, the author-narrator's presence is more rightly described as paratextual. The name "Patrick Chamoiseau" appears, as one would expect, in what Gérard Genette calls the peritext- on the front and inside covers and in the form of his initials at the bottom of the synopsis on the back cover -but the narrative "je" that has "Chamoiseau" as its referent appears in only two places in the diegesis, on the first and last pages, buried in each case at the bottom of the page in the novel's only footnotes, which renders that presence more accurately raeta-diegetic and thereby distanced from the story space. What is the logic of this self-marginalization, which is striking in its departure from Chamoiseau's typical mode of authorial self-representation? What does it mean for the author-narrator figure and the function he serves to be pushed to the edges of a body of work that has until now given him a central or at least significant role? If the author-narrator's presence previously functioned as ironic guarantor of ethnographic authenticity, what does his self-conscious relegation to the outer limits of this narrative signify?</page><page sequence="4">180 Richard Watts Through the contraction of his stand-in's presence in the narrative, Chamoiseau is explicitly backgrounding the role of humans. This, the author- narrator seems to suggest from the margins, is not a story about Creole culture in Martinique or the legacies of plantation life on the island, as had been the case with nearly all of Chamoiseau's works up to this point. Rather, it is concerned with the extra-human, the "natural" as opposed to the strictly "cultural." Even if the opposition is not quite that sharp in the narrative itself, the manner in which the author stages "Chamoiseau's" withdrawal attracts attention and obliges us to be mindful of human-animal relations and the implicit hierarchies that define them from the start. The first footnote, which describes the author-narrator's encounter with the eponymous malfini or hawk who has landed in his yard in the aftermath of a hurricane, ends with the narrative "je" describing his role as follows: "Alors, je m'accroupis comme une petite personne auprès du singulier visiteur et me mis en devoir de l'entendre... ou bien d'imaginer ce qu'il ne pouvait dire..." [So I knelt down like a little person in front of this remarkable visitor and opened myself up to hearing him... or rather to imagining that which he could not say...] (1 7).5 As these lines indicate, the novel constitutes an exercise in imaging the interior lives of animals, but does so with a type of framing that does not typically accompany such narratives. The novel is voiced in the first person by the malfini hawk, and the diegesis proper opens with his words, not with those of the human author. Beyond the recognition of his presence in the footnotes and the peritext, the author-narrator has virtually no role to play in the diegesis. This explicit marginalization of "Chamoiseau" within the context of a literary production that has relied on that figure makes for a different kind of narrative than one finds in standard animal tales, especially Caribbean ones, where humans are typically altogether absent, making the function of animals as human proxies that much easier to perceive. Placing "Chamoiseau" within the narrative only to mark his absence indicates a change in the relationship between human and animal. This very evident deviation from Chamoiseau's standard narrative template obliges us, as Philip Armstrong puts it, "To go beyond reading animals as screens for the projection of human interests and meanings, which until recently was the predominant way of treating cultural representations of animals" (2). Pointing to the backgrounding of humans in the novel is important from a literary-historical perspective because it suggests the beginning of a movement away from the nearly exclusive focus on cultural politics in Chamoiseau's writing, a literary touchstone for understanding race, gender, and history in the francophone Caribbean. But, there is more to this novel as concerns the species barrier than the simple shift in focus from human to animal. The way in which animals are apprehended, the rendering of their different forms of</page><page sequence="5">Poisoned Animal, Polluted Form 181 consciousness, and, perhaps most crucially, the imagined animal perspective on the encounter between the noxious activities of humans and the lives of animals, all constitute important departures from Chamoiseau's typical thematic concerns and seem to force changes in how stories are told, or at least in how Chamoiseau tells stories. The shift in focus from the human to the animal in Chamoiseau's work produces a number of further changes in the disposition of the narrative and, as a consequence, in modes of reading. My central concern in what follows is the nature of these changes, the most important of which is a disruption in the workings of allegory. Taken from a certain distance, Les neuf consciences du malfini bears the marks of allegory: the rapacious malfini hawk can be read as standing for man's violent territorializing impulses, the promiscuous hummingbird for a potentially deterritorialized and peaceful human relation to place. But the narrative also resists allegorical readings and obliges us to read it as if it were centrally, if not exclusively, concerned with animals. It forces us to partially suspend the hermeneutic reflexes that privilege allegory (i.e., reading for the human) in representations of animals. This suspension is underscored by "shared vulnerability," a term from the discourse on animal rights, which allows us to imagine the pain animals might suffer.6 The link Roland Barthes makes in this essay's epigraph between shifts in modes of expression and historical crises points to the importance of interpreting literary mode and form in order to understand and recast human (and non-human) experience. Les neuf consciences du malfini produces just such a shift away from representation in an allegorical mode. Accompanying this shift is a question implied throughout the narrative: Is it possible in the time of accelerated anthropogenic environmental change for the animals that suffer as a result of it - and suffer disproportionately, Chamoiseau suggests - to tell us merely about ourselves? Non-Human Thematics, Human -Centered Form The introduction to this essay can give the impression to those unfamiliar with Chamoiseau's work that the non-human world is thematically absent from all but the most recent novel, which is not quite the case. At least as early as Texaco , which won the 1992 Prix Goncourt, and certainly in the novels that follow, there is attention paid to the relations of humans to the land and the articulation of a Martinican Créoliste version of environmentalism. Still, although the Martinican landscape and fauna are present in all of Chamoiseau's works, they rarely appear in a way that suggests the notion of shared vulnerability or constitute what Donna Haraway calls "naturecul tures," those spaces and moments where the "Great Divides of animal/ human, nature/ culture, organic/ technical, and wild/ domestic flatten</page><page sequence="6">182 Richard Watts into mundane differences- the kinds that have consequences and demand respect and response" (16). Furthermore, their presence does not seem to provoke the significant reorientation of storytelling that Les neuf consciences du malfini evinces. This section steps away for a moment, then, from the question of the destabilization of allegory in Les neuf consciences du malfini to track the shift in thematic orientation in Chamoiseau's other novels. I take this detour with two goals in mind: first, to show how the progressive emergence of environmental thematics in Chamoiseau's work can (and does) nonetheless coincide with a type of narrative form that is consistently human-centered; second, and by extension, to establish a narrative baseline for demonstrating how radically Les neuf consciences du malfini breaks with Chamoiseau's mode of narrating the non-human world. Patrick Chamoiseau is often referred to as the novelist of the urban experience in the francophone Caribbean, and most of his novels bear out this characterization: the Creole market in Martinique's capitol city Fort-de-France that serves as the backdrop to La Chronique des sept misères , the "Savane" plaza in the heart of the city in Solibo magnifique , the urban slum attached to the flank of Fort-de-France in Texaco , the former slave plantation and current home for orphaned children on its outskirts in Un dimanche au cachot (2007; A Sunday in the Dungeon). Still, in each of these texts, the "urban" is suffused with the "rural," and unruly, Creole- or simply African-identified "nature" disrupts the workings of the paved, rectilinear "culture" of the city that is linked to the legacies of French colonialism. In the early novels, this takes the form of rural people living in the city. They are characterized by - or, rather, by means of -a greater proximity to the African cultural substrate of the island: Pipi, the urban "djobbeur" [day laborer] of La Chronique des sept misères who, as a result of his connection to the countryside, ends up zombified; the peasant Congo in Solibo magnifique whose name alone identifies him with Africa and who speaks Creole "avec son accent de nègre original" [with his accent of original African] (41/19) that the other characters have to translate for the author-narrator Chamoiseau, the consummate city dweller. This simplified schema of ostensibly unacculturated rural characters lost in the city receives a much fuller treatment in Texaco, which reaches back two centuries to describe the migration of former slaves from the rural plantation at the time of the second abolition of slavery in 1848 to a present-day slum connected to Fort-de-France built, significantly, on the land of a béké (a descendant of slaveholders). This novel presents a highly detailed account of how former slaves negotiated the interface of built and natural environments in post-abolition Martinique. Esternome, who becomes a carpenter after he gains his freedom, first tries to build a Utopian, back-to-nature village on the slopes of Mt. Pelée before being ushered, after a long series of misfortunes (including the volcanic eruption of</page><page sequence="7">Poisoned Animal, Polluted Form 183 that very mountain in 1902), to the city. There he and others build shelters from the waste of an emerging consumer society (e.g., discarded pallets), bringing their intimate knowledge of the land to bear on these improvised constructions. Even in the urban, industrialized waste space of what will become the slum dubbed Texaco (so named because it sits on an oil depot operated by that company), the inhabitants create oases: Papa Totone vivait dans une case en bois-caisse. Elle semblait d'un autre âge. [...] L'endroit semblait un œuf de verdure zébré de cordes luminescentes. [...] Une mousse lustrait les rives de la rivière qui s'écoulait plus claire qu'une vitre de magasin. Seule l'odeur folle de l'En-ville venait offusquer l'ensemble, le bruit aussi des camions très proches qui longeaient la corniche afin de s'en venir aux réservoirs de Texaco. (316) Papa Totone lived in a hutch made of crate wood. It seemed of another time. [...] The place looked like an egg of greenery streaked with luminescent ropes. [...] The moss glistened on the shores of the river which ran clearer than a shop's window. Only City's crazy odor intruded into all of that, also the noise of nearby trucks which followed the corniche in order to get to Texaco's reservoirs. (287-88) These characters and their dwellings constitute living counterpoints to the deadening impulses of industrial modernity and reclaim a connection to the natural environment that urbanization had severed. Although there is greater consideration of the natural environment in Texaco than in the earlier novels, the logic here is still one of human stewardship of the land albeit with former slaves playing the role of good stewards and the forces of progress, which ostensibly aim to improve the slum by cutting a highway through it, the role of bad stewards. Naturally enough, human ends trump all other concerns. Likewise, the narrative, for all its innovative mashing up of the oral and the written and of French and Creole, remains a parable of the transmission of human culture, in particular the culture of the descendants of slaves. A different logic and a concomitant shift in storytelling appear in the 2002 novel Biblique des derniers gestes , where the human and non-human are presented not as trapped in a relationship of stewardship, where the former always has the upper hand on the latter, but as co-constitutive. Among the many instances in which the human is tied to the non-human, the protagonist of the novel, Balthazar Bodules Jules or "Bibidji," finds solace in orchids, which present to his mind an ideal form of being: "Escortant ses errances, elles surgissaient partout, secrètes, protéiformes, avaient happé le monde dans le réseau de leurs racines, le possédaient en s' accordant à ses diversités" [Accompanying him in his wanderings, those secret and multifarious plants rose up everywhere; they had seized the world in the network of their roots and possessed it all while coinciding with it in all its diversity] (158). Bibidji aims to live like an orchid, which can grow nearly</page><page sequence="8">184 Richard Watts anywhere and requires very little water, giving beauty to the world while taking very little from it. I have argued elsewhere that form in this novel reflects the thematic co-constitution of human and non-human worlds (901- 03). I would only add here that it does so in part by strategically limiting the role of the author-narrator "Chamoiseau," who hands over the narration to a number of other characters: some living, some dead; some real, some mythological. This further blurring of the roles of author and character and of the real and the magical seems to correspond to a lessening of the sharp divisions between the human and the non-human in the novel. In this regard, Biblique des derniers gestes anticipates the jump across the species barrier that Chamoiseau takes in Les neuf consciences du malfini, where narration undergoes a significant shift. Allegory and Its Limits If Chamoiseau' s movement toward less anthropocentric thematics can be tracked in his novels of the last ten years, his transformation of the representation of animals and, more specifically, the workings of allegory and the animal fable in Les neuf consciences du malfini is an abrupt, recent development. His first published literary work, the two-act play Manman Dio contre la fée Carabosse (1982; Manman Dio Versus Carabosse the Fairy) stages the confrontation between the water deity Manman Dio - the Martinican variant of the Afro-diasporic divinity Mami Wata - and the wicked fairy godmother figure Carabosse from the European oral tradition. In this early work, Chamoiseau explicitly and somewhat schematically establishes what will become a central concern in the novels and essays that come after it: the threat of erasure of the composite Creole culture of Martinique at the hands of French economic, political, and, most importantly, cultural domination of the island department. To do so, the play accesses both Martinican and European stores of contes populaires or folktales. This insistence on the popular will also come to characterize much of Chamoiseau's subsequent work. Figures from Caribbean folklore appear in a number of his novels with a similar allegorical intent: for example, the zombie figure in Chronique des sept misères as alienated Martinican and the evil deity Yvonette Cléoste in Biblique des derniers gestes that functions as the embodiment of Western violence. Closer to my concerns in this essay, Chamoiseau also edited a collection entitled Au temps de V antan: contes du pays Martinique (1988; Creole Folktales, 1994) that offers his adapted transcriptions of oral folktales and contains a number of animal allegories. In some of those tales, animals talk, but they do not talk as animals. For Lewis Seifert, Glan-Glan the speaking bird of one of these tales "embodies a mysterious and thus powerful speech that invokes the role of orality in</page><page sequence="9">Poisoned Animal Polluted Form 185 Creoleness. As if to signal the heuristic and otherworldly potential of this orality, Glan-Glan is, first of all, an unknown and (seemingly) enchanted species of bird" (227). The specificity of this bird is unimportant and his animality is entirely incidental; what matters is the animal's capacity to translate a social problem, which in this case is the fragile status of Creole orality. The animals of Les neuf consciences du malfini play a decidedly different role. They do not stand in strictly as vessels for the expression of human concerns. Rather, they are vehicles for responses to problems that concern them directly, if not problems shared by both animals and humans. Although the malfini or hawk narrates Les neuf consciences du malfini, a hummingbird's actions, movements, and responses to ecological crisis are at the heart of the narrative. The hummingbird, or colibri in Creole, has a special place in Martinican folklore. In a well-known tale that pits colibri against all manner of creature, the hummingbird is defeated after a long struggle (he is decapitated by "poisson armé" [the armored fish]) and dies. In a brief essay in the wartime journal Tropiques , Aimé Césaire and René Ménil link colibri to the runaway slaves or "marrons" of Martinique and his assailants to the colonizer: "Mains coupées, corps écartelés, gibets, voilà ce qui peuple les allées de l'histoire coloniale. Et rien de tout cela n'aurait passé dans le folklore?" [Hands cut off, bodies scattered about, gallows, that's what fills the passageways of colonial history. And none of that would have entered the folklore?] (10). "Vaillant colibri" [brave hummingbird], as the authors call him, is therefore the privileged figure for the martyrdom of the descendants of slaves in Martinique.7 The hummingbird of Les neuf consciences du malfini is also assailed, but by a different constituency, and meets a decidedly different end. A more salient difference, though, is that the narrative gives consideration to his suffering as a hummingbird, not simply as allegorical stand-in for the suffering of humans. Still, the forms of characterization in the early part of the novel seem to warrant allegorical readings. The malfini describes the forest of Rabuchon into which he wanders as a site of prédation, rich with the type of prey that interests him. But his eyes are quickly drawn to an unusual hummingbird known as the Foufou (a generic Creole name for a type of small, green hummingbird, the Eulampis holocericeus, but functioning here as a proper name), who perturbs the malfini as well as the other inhabitants of Rabuchon because he refuses to take part in the territorial battles that occupy nearly all of them. He flits about promiscuously and displays an inconsequentiality that calls attention, by contrast, to the aggressive behavior of the malfini and even other colibris. The Foufou is, in a word, minor, and this mode of being is troubling to the other animals of Rabuchon in its inexactness: "c'était son être imprécise, et même imprédic tibie, qui l'isolait des autres. [...] Un solitaire</page><page sequence="10">186 Richard Watts donc, comme moi-même; mais si ma solitude relevait d'une éminence démesurée, la sienne provenait que d'une totale indistinction" [it was the imprecise and even unpredictable nature of his being that isolated him from the others. A solitary creature, then, like me. But if my solitude stemmed from my Olympian status, his was the function of a total lack of distinctiveness] (39). Chamoiseau constructs a sort of idealized ethical creature in the figure of the Foufou, which can, at this point in the narrative, easily be allegorized as a human ideal. The malfini , for his part, remains driven by his instinct to dominate in the early sections of the novel and can be read allegorically as an expression of man's colonizing impulses. This sort of overdetermined reading is blocked or frustrated by a number of elements of the text, many of them evoking interspecies contact. The narrative begins with the malfini soliciting the attention of the author-narrator, whom he addresses in the novel's first four words first as "Frère, vivant..." [Brother, Living One...], thereby signaling an interspecies connection, then as "ô Nocif" [Oh Noxious One], marking out a distance between them and acknowledging the threat humans pose to non-human populations (1). This form of address destabilizes the ground of allegory by signaling that the story is not about us; it is being told to us, it concerns us, but it is centrally concerned with animals. Likewise, the rare humans who enter the world of Rabuchon are liminal figures- a very young girl, a very old man- who seem disposed toward interspecies contact (the girl and the Foufou "sing" together [43-44]). As such, they break down the rigid species barrier upon which animal allegory relies. For animals to stand as human, they must be nearly blank slates of otherness onto which human characteristics are transferred. They must be generic representatives of a species whose animality, like that of the folkloric bird Glan-Glan, does not interfere with their ability to convey human traits; as Graham Huggan and Helen Tiffin put it, animals in this type of story must be "primarily symbolic" (139). These few initial moments of interspecies connection in the text rely on some measure of anthropomorphism to produce their effect: the hawk "speaks" to the author-narrator (we understand, of course, that this is a product of the author-narrator's imagination) and the Foufou communes with the young girl in a way that requires his adoption of human characteristics (he repeats her song). At least in the early sections of the novel, then, animals must meet humans in their discursive universe. At this point, we are not yet strongly solicited to read across the species barrier. However, Chamoiseau's subsequent staging of a shared ecological calamity pushes this complicated human-animal economy and the disruption of allegorical readings that it implies even further. In the novel's long middle section, Chamoiseau steps fully out of the context of the Creole folktale and its allegorical and</page><page sequence="11">Poisoned Animal Polluted Form 187 anthropomorphic resonances to directly address animal welfare, including that of the human animal. This section meditates both on globally dispersed anthropogenic environmental change and on the local ramifications of a specific ecological calamity. Allegory and "Toxic Discourse" The malfini is sufficiently troubled by the idiosyncratic Foufou, and especially his unwillingness to defend himself from violent attacks, that he decides to follow the Foufou, to track his every move in order to uncover the mystery of this non-territorializing behavior. Part of this tracking takes them both well beyond the confines of the island on a long-distance journey that is more peregrination than migration. During this pedagogical flight, the hawk and the hummingbird encounter migratory birds that appear confused and agitated. The birds describe disrupted seasons, extreme weather events, intermittent food supplies, and other climate-related difficulties: "Ils parlaient de saisons déboulées en avance, ou qui tardaient outre mesure, ou qui s'installaient en dérive inconstante hors des vieilles habitudes" [They spoke of the seasons that came too early, or that were remarkably delayed, or were unpredictably variable in relation to their old habits] (112). Rather than speaking of disrupted instinct, Chamoiseau presents the birds' dilemma as a failure of their "sapience jusqu'alors infaillible" [previously infallible knowledge] (113). As with humans, global climate change can be understood as constituting a crisis of reason for animals. Their way of reckoning with the world is inadequate to the environmental crises they face. The tragedy of climate change, though, is expressed here in terms that keep us from reading animal distress as a symptom of a strictly human problem. By imagining a specifically avian reaction to anthropogenic climate change, Chamoiseau obliges us to see beyond the purely human interest in the problem. This same imperative to read ecological crises as problems that beset animals (and not simply in their role as "sentinels" or "indicator species," which is to say as instrumentalized markers of potential environmental harm to humans) is driven home with even greater force by the Foufou's response to a case of environmental poisoning in the forest of Rabuchon. The central episode of environmental poisoning is, in fact, foreshadowed in an early passage in the novel in which the malfini surmises that the Foufou's few moments of stillness or "apathy" might be the effect of the poisons that the Noxious Ones (i.e., the humans) spread around them (34). In this way, the entire narrative is placed under the sign of the type of looming toxic threat that Rob Nixon characterizes as slow violence, "a violence that occurs gradually and out of sight, a violence of delayed destruction that is dispersed across time</page><page sequence="12">188 Richard Watts and space, an attritional violence that is typically not viewed as violence at all" (2). Still, the threat verges on ecocide later in the text, in the form of the accelerating death of the bit of forest in Martinique where the malfini and the Foufou live. The phenomenon is linked to its proximity to banana plantations: "Les bananiers seuls demeuraient florissants, mais ces grosses herbes, alignées, garde-à-vous, très souvent parfumées d'une chose nauséabonde, faisaient l'objet de sept-douze attentions de la part des Nocifs" [Only the banana plants remained in flower, but those overgrown grasses, all in a line, at attention, often covered in a nauseating perfume, were the subject of all kinds of scrutiny by the Noxious Ones] (138). Although not explicitly named in the novel, Chamoiseau is clearly evoking the widely recognized poisoning of soil and groundwater in Martinique with chlordécone, a synthetic chlorinated insecticide chemically similar to DDT and known as kepone in English. It was used by Martinican landowners- significantly, most of them descendants of slave owners from the béké ethno-social class- on banana plantations allegedly as late as 2002, even though its use had been outlawed in France in 1993.8 The passage creates striking though probably unintentional echoes with Rachel Carson's 1962 anti-pesticide screed Silent Spring , a text central to Lawrence Buell's enumeration of the characteristics of what he calls toxic discourse.9 Buell writes, "Although [toxic discourse] rests on anxieties about environmental poisoning for which there is often strong evidence, it is a discourse of allegation or insinuation rather than of proof" (48). The insinuation is much stronger in Chamoiseau's novel than it is in Carson's essay, primarily since the animals that reckon with the poisoning can have only a vague sense of the source of illness in their habitat. Where the novel closely resembles Silent Spring, though, is in the web of linked toxicities that it describes. Just as Carson follows the path of DDT from the fields on which it is sprayed to the rivers into which it leaches and then into the flesh of the animals whose habitat it enters, so does Chamoiseau track the effect of the unnamed chemical through the interconnected creatures of Rabuchon: "Où étaient ces punaises puantes, ces libellules filiformes, ces moucherons de soleil, ces cafard sombres qui puisaient de la terre, ces grosses noctuelles qui n'aimaient que la lune? [...] Avaient-ils disparu sans que je m'en rende compte ?" [Where were the stink bugs, the slender dragonflies, the gnats, the dark cockroaches that rise up out of the earth, the moths that love only the moon? Had they vanished without my having noticed?] (133). This is significant because the focus shifts, at least momentarily, from the exceptional and exceptionally visible animal on which allegory always relies to the seemingly inconsequential. Chamoiseau does this, it seems, not so much to suggest a wholly non-hierarchical biotic world- after all, exceptional animals in the form of the malfini and the Foufou remain central in this narrative- but</page><page sequence="13">Poisoned Animal Polluted Form 189 to represent the connections between species and the profound reverberations of human effects on the environment. Toxicity is the great leveler: in the case of chlordécone poisoning, it wipes out the aphids, sickens the birds, and causes infertility in humans. Its effects are distributed nearly indiscriminately. This creates a tension in the narrative that renders emotional attachment with individual characters difficult: the narrative is organized around the malfini and the Foufou, but the toxicity is spread up and down the chain of being in a way that forces us to recognize that no animal is exempt, including the human animal. Humans are depicted in the novel as both affected by the poisoning and at least partially aware of the cause. But the specificity of the animal response to the poisoning keeps us from simply reading "up"- the central practice of allegory - from their plight to the plight of humans. Conclusion To return to the Roland Barthes epigraph, if a "mode of writing" is a human intention and is "thus linked to the great crises of History" (14), Chamoiseau' s recent novel seems to suggest that great crises of History - an ecological one in this case- can also precipitate the collapse or at least the inflection of a mode of writing. The effect of the novel's equal consideration of animality is a malfunction of allegory. Chamoiseau describes throughout his 1997 intellectual autobiography Ecrire en pays dominé his passage as author from "marqueur de paroles" [word scratcher], which is to say recorder of cultural practices, to the more militant "guerrier de l'imaginaire" [warrior of the imagination]. There is, I would argue, a third incarnation, Chamoiseau as warrior of the ecological imagination, and this latest authorial persona has implications for his use of form. Whereas animal allegory was fully appropriate to (and wholly functional in) works solely concerned with cultural politics in Martinique, an attentiveness to animal welfare and to the co- responsibility that defines future relations to the environment destabilize animal allegory as a mode of writing. That mode is both inappropriate to and inadequate in this context precisely because of its unavoidably anthropocentric perspective. Allegory instrumentalizes the animal by always making its referent a human problem or characteristic; Chamoiseau imaginatively restores animal agency, and allegory ceases to be appropriate to animal representation. It is impossible to fully separate the human from the animal concerns that are foregrounded here. Some of this is simply a function of the limits of our ability to know, understand, and represent animal consciousness. Clear traces of allegorical figuration in some of the characteristics of the animals remain in Chamoiseau's novel, not the least of which is the hawk's understanding of his</page><page sequence="14">190 Richard Watts psychological or spiritual evolution in terms of Buddhist enlightenment (the hawk's eighth consciousness is his predatory instinct; his ninth consciousness of the title is his transcendence of that instinct). Similarly, and more significantly, humans both cause the ecological catastrophe depicted in the novel and suffer from it, even if that suffering is only hinted at. But this inevitable trace of the human has to be understood as part of Chamoiseau' s project: human and animal, Les neuf consciences du malfini suggests, must be seen as co-constitutive. Humans and their interactions with the animals are just present enough in this animal tale to disrupt allegorical (i.e., anthropocentric) interpretation; likewise, they are just present enough to avoid the risk of trivializing human suffering and descending into reflexive zoophilia. Through the precise example of poisoning at the hands of agricultural pesticides, Chamoiseau creates an alignment between the Martinican subaltern- the descendant of slaves who tend to be the present- day agricultural workers in Martinique- and the non-human world. The postcolonial subaltern, Chamoiseau suggests, has to recognize the connection to animals through the harm that both suffer as a result of the negative externalities of modern agricultural production. This, in turn, creates at the very least a sentimental alliance among marginalized human and non-human "others" that enlarges the counter-public of a rationalist economic order, an order that, as it is depicted in Les neuf consciences du malfini, privileges the productivity of banana plantations over animal and human welfare. But the means that we typically deploy to imaginatively render the animal Other are not adequate to this more expansive notion of otherness. The significant reordering of those to whom we are connected and the manner in which we are connected to them has implications for novelistic form. Chamoiseau' s novel, with its reordered narrative structure, demonstrates that our modes of representation and our ways of reading must also change to adapt to the great ecological crisis of History. Notes My thanks to María-Elena Garcia and the participants in the "Animals, Violence, Justice" research cluster, sponsored by the Simpson Center for the Humanities at the University of Washington, who very generously read and commented on a first version of this essay. Translations are mine unless noted by two separate page references: e.g., (41/19), the first referring to the original edition, the second to the translation. 1. To take the example of one of Chamoiseau' s works of non-fiction, the 1997 "theoretical" essay Ecrire en pays dominé [Writing in Dominated Land] is part programmatic diatribe on the problem of cultural production in Martinique and part intellectual autobiography with its listing of works that influenced the author and his idiosyncratic response to them. This latter aspect of the essay has the "author" in an extended dialogue with another "character," the unnamed "Vieux guerrier" [Old Warrior]. The fictionalized "je" [I] is therefore deployed in</page><page sequence="15">Poisoned Animal Polluted Form 191 nearly the same manner in this work as it is in the novels. Regarding the focus on Martinique in Chamoiseau's works, the 2002 novel Biblique des derniers gestes [Biblical of the Last Gestures], which spans the globe, stands as a notable exception, but even that narrative begins and ends on Chamoiseau's island home. 2. For Lydie Moudileno, the figure of "Chamoiseau" (especially in Solito Magnifique) is a more sharply drawn character than the figures whose stories he is ostensibly foregrounding, which she attributes precisely to his status as observer: "Son extériorité par rapport au milieu qu'il décrit n'en est que plus flagrante dans la mesure où il dote explicitement son personnage d'une profondeur exceptionnelle dans le récit [...], ce qui n'est pas le cas pour les autres témoins" [His outsider status in relation to the society he describes is even more noticeable as a result of the fact that he gives his character an exceptional depth in the narrative, which is not the case for the other witnesses] (90). Perhaps, but the relative flatness of the characters that surround "Chamoiseau" is a tacit admission of Chamoiseau's status as outsider. In other words, Chamoiseau does not attempt to obscure the sociocultural gap between himself and the Martinican popular culture he describes. To do otherwise would be to perpetuate an illusion of narrative omniscience, which runs counter to Chamoiseau's project of narrating cultural difference and the gaps in understanding that such difference implies. 3. In L'esclave vieil homme et le molosse, "Chamoiseau" intervenes in the final chapter to explain how he came to know and transmit the story of the runaway slave and how it might serve as a model in the Caribbean today: "Le vieil esclave m'avait laissé ses os, c'est dire: charroi d'histoires-mémoires et de temps rassemblés. [...] C'étaient des os de guerrier [...] sans souci de conquête ou de domination. Qui aurait couru vers une autre vie. Vie de partage et d'échanges qui transforment. Vie d'humanisation du monde en son total" [The old slave had left me his bones, which is to say a collection of stories-memories across time. They were the bones of a warrior with no interest in conquest or domination, who ran towards another life, a life of transformative sharing and exchanging, a life that sought to humanize the world in its totality] (146-47). 4. This is true even in the case of the aforementioned L'esclave vieil homme et le molosse, in spite of the significant role played by the titular "molosse" [a generic term for a large, aggressive dog] who tracks the runaway slave of the title. The dog, in this case, is simply a stand-in for the old slave's master and betrays only the slightest independence of consciousness. 5. The conceit of the author-narrator creating the narrative on the sole basis of his interpretation of the sounds and movements produced by a character appears already in Chamoiseau's 2002 novel Biblique des derniers gestes. In that novel, though, the character Balthazar Bodule-Jules, whose groaning and fidgeting Chamoiseau transforms into an 800- page narrative, is human. Furthermore, the author-narrator Chamoiseau remains at Balthazar Bodule-Jules' s side, essentially accompanying him throughout. In Les neuf consciences du malfini, this imaginative act is shown as being done from farther away; namely, from across the species barrier. Still, the fact that the narrative exists is Chamoiseau's way of suggesting that the species barrier is somewhat permeable. 6. Cary Wolfe makes the case for a consensus on "shared vulnerability" in his essay "Before the Law: Animals in a Biopolitical Context" through references to the work of Peter Singer, Jacques Derrida, and Cora Diamond (11-13). 7. A. James Arnold provides a compelling explanation for why Aimé Césaire's generation could acknowledge the importance of Creole folktales but could not put them to productive use in their cultural combat: "The reason for this can be found in the cultural disruption</page><page sequence="16">192 Richard Watts brought about by the official policy of assimilation practiced by the French on their subjects in the 'old' colonies of the West Indies [...]. When we factor the policy of cultural assimilation of French West Indian people of color in with the economic transformation of the landscape [...], the result is a historical pressure that paralyzed the imagination of the first generation of French West Indian intellectuals who came to an awareness of themselves as the heirs to the African diaspora" (265). 8. The issue of kepone pollution in the French Caribbean was brought to widespread public attention by the 2007 publication of Chronique d'un empoisonnement annoncé : Le scandale du Chlordécone aux Antilles françaises 1972-2002 [Chronicle of a Poisoning Foretold: The Kepone Scandal in the French Antilles 1972-2002] by Louis Boutrin, leader of the new political party "Martinique Ecologie," and Raphaël Confiant, novelist and Chamoiseau's erstwhile collaborator. The "Plan d'action chlordécone en Martinique et en Guadeloupe 2008-2010" [Kepone Action Plan in Martinique and Guadeloupe 2008-2010] (June 2008), produced by the French Government, belatedly details the extent of the problem, though without reference to the specific health effects that are associated with the pesticide in the popular imagination (e.g., most significantly, male infertility). 9. The connection between Les neuf consciences du malfini and Carson's Silent Spring are explored in depth in an unpublished essay by Christina Sutton, a University of Washington graduate student who took part in my seminar "Ecocriticism and the Post/ Colonial" in Fall 2009.
