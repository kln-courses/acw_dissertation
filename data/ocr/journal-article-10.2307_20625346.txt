Raven Arts Press. ?1.95/?4.50._ Nothing exemplifies the growing maturity of Irish publishing more than its willingness to look beyond native subject matter and native writers to pastures less green. Raven's ambitious and admirable Raven Trans lations series gets off to a flying start with this translation of Harding's Fabulous Life .. . The volume consists of two long prose poems based on the lives of these two poets. In his stimulating introduction S. B. Smith claims that "each was subtly important to his time in ways that pass beyond the actual body of the writings". This is a risky state ment, conjuring up visions of a huge clank ing Wagnerian stage machinery of Zeit geists and World Historical Individuals but, within the confines of a work of art, it is valid enough. Harding probes the fantasti cal lives of his characters with the imagina tion rather than analysis, and communicates his findings in arresting images. We see Apollinaire in the frenzied world of pre war Cubist Pans, trailing his English Governess to the quay where he stands, "with his big red heart sobbing in his hand". He is identified clearly in the poem, as is Shelley, as a life-giving force in a repressive society. Locked up in prison, accused of stealing the Mona Lisa, he digs "a tunnel under the wall and he saw the sun at the end of the tunnel and he crawled in that direction until the whole tunnel filled with light". But both of our poets are stalked by darker forces. Eventually word is sent back to Corporal Hitler in Nietzsche trench, who "ordered the heavy howitzers to open fire on Apollinaire". And we see Shelley, on hearing of the death of Adonais, "tearing out pages from an old bible and before distributing them graciously fluttering to the wind he wrote on them with loving care in a big flowery hand the word 'death'." A playful, moving, and very impressive work. S. B. Smith's translation reads like an expert, loving, reconstruction, and so does Derek Mahon's version of Les Chimeres. You can almost feel the sympathy flowing between the two poets. These translations are scintillating, and show the astonishing way in which Nerval seems to anticipate Baudelaire and the Symbolists. They really catch fire when Mahon encounters that spirit of anthropomorphism which so ani mates his own work: Even now a God hides among bricks and bones ? And, like an eye closed in the womb, a pure Spirit evolves beneath the glaze of stones. From the Paris of Nerval and Apollinaire we come back to the more, or perhaps less, familiar ground of North Dublin, as seen in Dermot Bolger's new book. This is an extremely ambitious poem-sequence, which attempts to link private and public experi ence, through the device of a central narrator. We see the events, both public and private, through his eyes, and it is not a pretty sight. It is a vision of Dublin seen from the driving seat of a car cruising the late-night streets, in terms of shared experi ence and common vocabulary a world closer to New Jersey than to Kildare Street, a point which Bolger reinforces by his apt quotations from rock songs. If the American Dream is dying, then it will re verberate just as strongly here. But in the sequence, this dream comes to represent all the dreams of youth which are so savagely mutilated and crushed in contemporary Irish society, a process aptly symbolised in the sequence by the Stardust fire. Counter pointed to this theme is the eternal one of youth coming to terms with death, not just the great abstract itself, but death on a t Sidney Bernard Smith</page><page sequence="2">18 personal level. Somehow, out of all this, the narrator manages to attain a desperate balance, an assertion of happiness and per sonal growth in the face of a hostile society, and perhaps even a hostile universe: the cars roll through frames towards credits ending the movie in which I have refused my cue and cannot be written back in". Raven Arts Press have also embarked on a Long Poem series, a much neglected genre which seems set for something of a renaissance. Conleth Ellis's long poem After Doomsday transports us to yet familiar but disturbing landscape: that of rural Ireland after a nuclear bomb has been dropped. He sees it from the point of view of nature, and how it is affected in the world of an Irish farm. The book throws in some light relief in the form of quotations from the famous Civil Defence booklet, which had already attained the status of a cult classic before the film The Atomic Cafe brought such material to a wider audience. An original work which "no bunker should be without".</page></plain_text>
