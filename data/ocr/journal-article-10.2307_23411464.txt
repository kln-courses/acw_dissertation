<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kimbo: Stone Figures from Western Province, Solomon Islands Few figures carved from stone in the Solomon Islands have been recorded in the literature which is quite sparse given the range and diversity of local art forms in the western Solomons. However a sizeable collection has now been made of small, free-stand ing, stone heads known locally as kimbo. Some of these stone heads are similar to the well known nguzunguzu figures carved in wood, but kimbo seem to be a distinct traditional art form that was once spread widely throughout the western Solomons. Introduction One of the earliest published references to small carved figures in Western Province was by Lt. B .T. H. Somerville who had spent eight months in 1893 and 1894 surveying mostly in the Morovo and Roviana districts of New Georgia. He wrote that the most common carved figures were village protectors "made almost invariably from a fern tree stump." (Somerville 1897:387; Williamson 1914:66). Somerville also noted smaller carved figures "of a man's head, supported on its own clenched fists, the face of extreme and dog-like prognathity....with wide staring eyes, long pointed chin between two entirely disproportionate atrophied arms, growing from the ears from which downwards they follow the line of a chin" (Somerville 1897:371). These were fine descriptions of the figures called nguzunguzu in the Roviana language and to to isu in the Marovo language. The role of these wooden fig ures was well recorded as being to protect the village against manggota, or evil spirits. Somerville also wrote that often one of these fig ures, which he called a 'toto ishu,' was attached to a canoe prow, at the waterline, to guide the canoe safe ly, and to "keep off the kesoko or water fiends which might otherwise cause the winds and waves to upset the canoe, so that they might fall on and devour the crew" (Somerville 1897:372). Subsequent local lore has it that a nguzuguzu for a war party held a head or skull in its hands under its chin, while a canoe for peaceful purposes would have a nguzunguzu hold Rhys Richards Wellington ing a dove. These nguzunguzu figures are now made for the tourist trade from black ebony wood and mottled brown kerosene wood, and are highly pol ished and inlaid ornately with nautilus shell Although Somerville's account implies that all the figures he saw were made of wood, much the same nguzunguzu shapes occur in stone but with a different function. The name kimbo is now used to cover a range of stone figures (human, semi-human and animal, including some nguzunguzu) associat ed variously with grave sites. (Figure i) Figure i. Nguzunguzu,'from Baniata Village, Rendova Island (K.42) The extensive writings of Hocart, who undertook anthropological research on Simbo and in Roviana in 1908, are disappointing on kimbo, largely because of a proliferation of names from place to place, and very few references to stone items. Most of the free standing carvings seen by Hocart and the early mis sionaries were made from stumps and tree ferns e.g. "four feet high with a shell over the forehead, two shells in place of ears, mere traces of arms and a large penis" (Hocart c. 1908, Hocart 1922:264; 1937:39). He noted that spirit beings such as kesoko (general spirit beings), tomate (spirits of the dead), and tutu ru (generally evil bush spirits) were often ill-defined, fluid and vague, and moreover varied from place to July 2001 103</page><page sequence="2">place both on and off Sim bo. Some were tutelar deities, others merely ornaments (Hocart 1935:98). Some were for personal rituals and not all were evil. (The concept that all carvings were malevolent dev ils clearly post-dates the advent of Christianity.) The illustration of a kimbo that Wall published then, and again in 1975, is of a slim figure with a human face on a tall torso and wearing a brimless, flat topped cap, from 'Heremaini' on Nggatokae (Wall 1974:36; Wall 1975 plate I). Consequently in the remainder or this report, kimbo have been defined as carved, three dimen sional, stone figures associated with funeral customs. This definition excludes fern and tree stump figures, wooden post statues and the remodelled human skulls covered with tita gum and shell inlays that were made in Roviana but were called kimbo malivi by informants in Morovo. In 1964 Keio University sent an archaeological expedition from Japan to the British Solomon Islands where they made general surveys in Choiseul, north New Georgia, Simbo, Ranonga and Vella Lavella. A preliminary report by Masashi Chikamori included an illustration of a nguzun guzu, with a circular brimmed, bowler hat with a caption "A stone statue of Ugogozu, one of grave artifacts, at Tangele Sope nguzunguzu in Simbo Island." This seems to be the earliest published illus tration of a kimbo, albiet a kimbo in a nguzunguzu form (Itoh 1965; Chikamori 1965). In 1974 Lindsay Wall wrote To explain the connection between the stone kimbo figures found on grave sites on Nggatokae and the pre-Christian religion of that island, it is necessary to explain some of the pre-Christian beliefs. One of the main bases of their religion was the belief that the head held the life [force] of man, thus the importance of skulls [and headhunting] in their religious rituals. When a man died it was believed that his spirit, mangonai (image), would go to Ove, the home of all spirits on Simbo Island, if the proper rituals had been abserved. Through his skull, usually placed in i small slab grave at a special grave site on a :liff ledge, promontory or small hill top, orayers could be offered to the ponda, or Devil. Often a likeness of the dead man, kimbo, carved of hard volcanic stone, would oe placed at the site in memory of the man whose skull was there and also to act as a â– vatchman to deter people from coming near :he grave. The kimbo was sometimes carved yy the man himself before he died, or by his ;on or close relatives after his death. Wall 1974:34) In 1973 Margaret Tedder made an extensive held survey for the Solomon Islands National Museum of the taro terraces and other archaeological features of 'Old Kusaghe' on north-eastern New Georgia (Tedder 1976). At Kui standing at the corner of a grave-sized rectangle of stones adorned with other traditional custom items, she found a very lifelike little stone head, with a small topknot and an open mouth with teeth. It seems from the illustration to be about 20 cm high and 15 cm wide. A second stone figure, also illustrated, was found at Kokorapa. It is dog-headed like a nguzunguzu, but includes a torso and legs. It seems to have been about 20 cm tall. Tedder referred to both as mbeku patu, but since in some dialects on New Georgia this can mean a stone doll, without any sacredness, the generic name 'kimbo" is preferred. Both these kimbo were deposited in the Solomon Islands National Museum. Kimbo seem to have been limited to heads anly and not often to full bodied figures, or to fig ures made from pumice. In 1975 Lindsay Wall and Rolf: Kuschel published an account of their field work on Nggatokae in 1969 and 1971. They noted "Skulls of chiefs and head hunters were taken to inaccessible places such as caves, cliff ledges and outlying islands. The site was called era, or if the skull was placed in a special shrine, oru. A male relative might later on carve a stone image (kimbo) of the deceased to place at the grave site . Only men could carve kimbo and as a rule only for a male relative, though some husbands :arved one for a wife. The main purpose of the fig ure was to watch over the grave and frighten off intruders. Food offerings were sometimes made to ancestor at the site." His illustration was the same kimbo as before, but in his tables he listed artifacts :ollected at ten sites, including one kimbo from Vanua and three kimbo from Heramaini, and noted [hat all were deposited in the Solomon Islands Mational Museum. In 1978 John and Sue Chick included in their Grass Roots Art of the Solomons, an illustration of a jumice figure, full bodied but seated with a mortar ind pestle. This they labelled as "A Kimbo from 04 I aciric Arts</page><page sequence="3">Nggatakae" (Chick and Chick 1978). They also showed "a stone head from the Morovo lagoon area," which is a head mounted on a single broad circular ring. Morovo people today would call this a kimbo, adding assertively but wrongly, that its use was as a weight for a turtle net. tattooed face on an egg shaped stone sitting on a round pedestal (Waite 19791x234). In 1982 Clarke and Kelesi published a brochure Solomon Islands Arts and Artifacts with a picture of three other kimbo, all with nguzunguzu character istics and bulbous headgear. Their description has some additional comments, possibly from Wall and Tedder: "Some kimbo were shaped like nguzun guzu... The carving of kimbo may have extended throughout the Marovo Lagoon region in pre-chris tian times. Ship's captains reported sighting them in the hills over a wide area. The figures come in red and grey stone and in coral and pumice" (Clarke and Kelesi 1982). In fact, no other references to, or exam ples of, kimbo have been found that were made of red stone, or of coral or pumice. Waite has noted that "Anthropomorphic images carved in stone are far less common than wooden images in museum collections of art from the Solomon Islands. Of the seven stone images in the British Museum Solomons collection, one of espe cial value is a small egg-shaped stone head that was acquired by the Rev. Alfred Penny in the Florida Islands (Nggela) in the 1880s" (Waite 19791x213). This was called a "tindalo, or spirit of the dead." Such figures were consulted and prayed to as they exercised powers in war, agriculture, sea travel, fish ing, health and love. Her illustration of it shows a Figure 2. Unnamed figure from Bilua Island, Vella Lavella (K.57) A heavily tattooed tindalo, but upright with a stem like torso, now in the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, is illustrated in Oceanic Mythology. (Poignant 1967:95) A third tindalo, given to Bishop Selwyn at the Florida Islands in 1851 and now at Cambridge, has only an oval head, with a deeply incised full face tattoo (Stanley 1994:28). Still anoth er illustration of a tindalo stone from the Florida Islands shows an egg shaped head with little modi fication (Waite 19793:252). The new collection includes one minimally modified circular stone with a carved face, but it has no tattoo and is so different in style that it seems unlikely that tindalo in the Florida Islands are the same as, or are some form of, the kimbo of Western Province. Waite noted the existence of two stone heads with "incised facial tattooings" and a very different style from kimbo (Waite 19793:252). Evidently 'tindalo' and other tattooed stone heads belong to a different class of stone images beyond the scope of this review of kimbo. The importance accorded the head as the core of being, and for the worship of ancestoral skulls, has been noted widely in the former cultures of the west ern Solomons where most of the art and carvings were associated with heads, head hunting, mortuary practices, and to decorate canoes for head hunting, graves and skull collections. From the foregoing review of the literature, it would seem that somewhere between fourteen and seventeen stone kimbo are or have been deposited in museum collections. A few more may perhaps have been overlooked as 'stone nguzunguzus' (Figure 2). Describing The New Collection During 1998, in the last few months of the writer's three years living in the Solomons, several local traders began bringing kimbo to Honiara for sale. This practice had been noted by Wall and Kuschel in 1971, but apparently was not prevalent in 1996 and 1997. Why it was 'resumed' in mid 1998 was never explained, but within three months over 80 were purchased. All were wet, mildewed and in poor con dition. Several of the larger ones crumbled away despite help from staff of the Solomon Islands National Museum and were discarded. To preserve July 2001 105</page><page sequence="4">the remainder, on our departure for New Zealand, all were packed in damp newspaper and cardboard boxes where they dried out slowly though often with some minor cracking. These kimbo totalled 81, with 69 single heads, nine double headed Janus-like figures, and one with four heads. (Two more that are atypical and only nominally kimbo being large bangle-like rings carved with heads spread round the outer rim are discussed later.) The largest figure weighs 1700 grams, the smallest 40 grams, and the average weight is 427 grams, The tallest figure is 175 mm, the small est a tiny 40 mm. The average kimbo is close to 100mm tall, 100 mm deep and 60 mm across the face side. Most are free standing though a few have small extensions to steady them (Figure 3). Since stone kimbo seem something of a new, or scarcely Figure 3. Kesa from Kusi Village, Kolombangara Island. (K.62) described, traditional art form, some simple com ments follow to describe the new collection. While the heads can be seen as a single stylistic group, the main feature is their wide diversity: no two are identical, and most are distinctive and indi vidualistic in design and execution. This suggests that at some stage or stages in the past many people had the skills necessary to carve well, while the wide distribution of these new' kimbo, spanning what were traditionally hostile village groups, suggests those skills were probably spread across several dif ferent language and clan groups. In design, two thirds are human heads, nearly one third are like nguzunguzu (part human and part dog) and two are dogs. But these forms overlap signifi cantlyâ€” over half the nguzunguzu have some semi human features, and one third of the human heads were also in some way like nguzunguzu. (In several areas kastom stories record that mankind's oldest ancestor was a dog.) This cautions that the people who made these figures, and used and valued them, may not have made the same exclusive distinctions made today i.e. humans, gods and ancestral dogs were probably intermingled rather differently then. Just over half of the kimbos had a plain vertical or near vertical main axis, but almost half have a con trived mainly horizontal axis which distorts facial and other 'human' features. In this new collection of stone kimbo, a quarter of the faces show natural features realistically with little or no distortion. But 27% of the faces have some horizontal stretching and a further 40% have extreme prognathism extending, for example, their upper and lower jaws far beyond their noses. Vertical attenuation is less marked, affecting only a quarter, though 13% are heightened extremely. (By compar ison, the sample of 197 wooden carved heads of fig ures from Choiseul, New Georgia and Santa Isabel quoted by Waite has slightly more prognathism than the new collection (72% to 68%), but has marked ly more vertical attenuation (71% for Waite com pared with 30% here) (Waite 19793:250). Overall this new collection of 79 stone figures has consider ably less facial distortion than comparable Western Province carvings in wood. In her pioneer woik Aspects of Sty le and Symbolism in the Art of the Solomon Islands, Waite has used largely limbs, and their poses, to assess important diagnostic attributes. However only two of the 79 io6 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="5">new kimbo have a torso or legs, and only a quarter have arms. For most of the latter the arms are elon gated, as in the set nguzunguzu pose, usually in order to hold a skull, or several, in hands clasped under the chin. Unlike the wooden nguzunguzu, however, none of the kimbo in stone carry doves of peace instead of skull trophies. mouths with blandly parted lips, but eight have smiles, one a scowl, and six have small but deep o shaped mouths. Only one kimbo has teeth. Special attention was given to hairstyles, head ware and hats as possibly diagnostic features for sub regional styles and variations (e.g. as seems to be the case for wood carvings on nearby Bougainville.) However only 9% of the kimbo had hair, 41% appeared bald or featureless, and 46% had large bul bous headgear, mostly as a large smooth bulb, but six more have their bulbs divided into segments and two are divided by horizontal lines (See Fig. 4) Only one had a small 'top hat' like those often on the mod em nguzunguzu carved for tourists. Two thirds have large circular earrings similar to the clam shell rings used formerly as currency. Five have conventional ears, three have oval ear lobes and a quarter have no ears at all. Noses are generally long and narrow, many heightening the prognathous' thrust of greatly extended upper and lower jaws. None have facial or other tattoos. Mouths are not a distinguishing feature, as almost all have horizontal Figure 4. Unnamed figure from Choiseul Island. (K.44) July 2001 107</page><page sequence="6">Localities and Local Lore The new collection includes kimbo from every main island in Western Province except uninhabited Tetepare, Simbo, Mono and the Shortland Islands. As noted, kimbo did occur on Simbo. Kimbo prob ably exist in the Shortlands, and possibly on Bougainville, since the new collection has many from Choiseul and northern Isobel too (Figs 4 and 5). Of the 81 new items, 44% are from New Georgia (including Roviana, Marovo, and Vangunu and Nggatokae Islands), a further 28% are from Choiseul, and 8 from Kolombangara (Fig. 6), five from Rendova, four from Rananga, two from Vona Vona and one from Vella Lavella. The provenace of 6% is unknown except generally "from Western Province." Care was taken to establish the generic name 'kimbo.' The local name is definitely 'kimbo' in the Marovo and southern districts. Another name beku or mbeku may be used more widely, but it can be confusing as it has various meanings. In Roviana both kimbo and beku were used, though 'kimbo' has a sense of sacredness lacking from 'beku' which, near Munda for example, can also mean a doll. As Tedder indicated, 'beku' was the given name in northeast ern New Georgia. "On Simbo, beku apparently sig nified an image, though not necessarily a spirit. The upper tip of canoe prows were apparently called beku in parts of New Georgia and gelana on Vella Lavella." Anthropomorphs and anthropomorphic heads were rendered in three dimensions. Canoe prows, presumably all in wood, were called beku on Faisi and Alu in the Shortland Islands, located on the border with Bougainville (Waite 1990:54). Thurnwald reported squatting grave-side figures on Choiseul in 1910, and that this was the case again "in certain regions on Bougainville. The figures are called mbeku, and often the posts of the chiefs halls in Buin are carved in the form of such mbeku fig ures" (Capel 1943:24). But such wood carvings would be two dimensional so here too the name 'beku' can be confusing. Other names may exist else where, but so far 'kimbo' seems to be the most pre cise if limited to three dimensional figures carved of stone and associated with funeral customs. The spelling used includes the letter m which would be dropped if the name referred only to items from the Marovo language area. The letter m has been retained here throughout partly for convenience but Figure 5. 'Too Soo' from Kia, Isobel Island (K.68) also in order to use a single name 'kimbo' to cover the wider distribution. Wherever possible the persons who sold these kimbo were asked to specify not only the former locations of their wares, but also the custom names, usages and other details. Most of the new collection of kimbo were taken from formerly tambu sites, especially damp caves and surface finds' within the forests, near to but not necessarily close to former inland villages. Very few were dug up (and any sug gestions of further digging were censured vigorous ly). Conspicuously there seem to be no current tambu and little if any concern for secrecy, or alas for conservation. Why they were brought to Honiara openly in 1998 for sale was never clarified, but it could perhaps reflect some local slackening of old ways as the values of the local churches penetrate deeper. Informants provided four distinct functions for kimbo. Many said that they were grave markers or memorials comparable to modern church grave stones, to commemorate a specific ancestor, but without any sacred or magical powers. Others said kimbo were grave markers intended to warn, more or less ominously, that living humans should keep well away. A third group, some of whom were cross examined quite thoroughly, asserted that formerly, io8 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="7">to the gods or spirits with which they were associated. Some of the objects, as for instance carved representations of sharks or other ani mals, are indeed the receptacles of the bodies of the departed, but they are not so of their spirits, and the objects themselves are in no way the things to which reverence is paid. Figure 6. Bangara of the Monriki Tribe, a Janus figure with shell inlays, from Kusi Village, Kolombangara Island. (K. 48) if venerated, kimbo functioned as a personal, pri vate, medium for contact with the deceased. Kimbo were particularly potent for this, they said, if a lock of hair, a fingernail, or a finger was deposited safely within the kimbo, either in a treasure box space pro vided, or inside an ear. It was implied that "some (bush) people" still use kimbo for this purpose, and that a few (benighted pagans) still accept the fourth function, namely that some kimbo are, or were, embodiments of the Gods themselves, and to be worshiped as such. Where Gods had vacated their former repository homes, kimbo could now be shift ed, or sold, with impunity. In this context it is interesting to note the obser vation of Williamson who visited Roviana and Kolombangara in 1910: The old idea that people worship idols is not correct. Sailors, untrained travellers and mis sionaries found carved images and other objects before which religious ceremonies were performed and offerings were placed, and not unnaturally assumed that these things were idols which were themselves the object of worship. But in fact the carved images were only memorial images...the offerings were made not really to the objects themselves, but (Williamson 1914:80) If this is still so in most cases, it might go some way to explain why latter-day vendors were so ready, and indeed keen, to trade or sell their antiques. Several traders were eager to record the names of their stone figures, some in writing, and some added other comments. Names were recorded for 49 kimbo. Most were individual names, but some could be generic e.g. 'Nguzunguzu was recorded once each for kimbo from Morovo, Roviana, Sasavelle and Ranonga; 'Buga' was recorded three times for kimbo from Ranonga and one from Randova; 'Kesa' was used four times on Kolombangra, once on Randova and twice on Choiseul. One seller from Kolombangara wanted it recorded that 'kesa was the name whether the kimbo figure was "made from stone or mud." Notably too 'Karua' was given twice for double headed figures from Choiseul, and 'Pela' for a four headed figure also from Choiseul. (Karua can mean two; kesa is the common name for cylin drical shell money from Choiseul, and pela is the name of the lethal magic still much feared in parts of New Georgia.) Among sixteen additional comments, two sellers indicated that kimbo were funeral boxes for relics; one that his kimbo was an evil spirit who damaged gardens; and two that their kimbo could help reveal the hideouts of enemies. Two more were sea gods, with one able to make fine weather or storms. Two other informants specified that their named kimbo were peacemakers, one specializing in resolving compensation claims. Another kimbo was a god of hunting; and one, a janus figure from Kolombangara named 'Machuva,' was "the God who transferred his powers, by a hug, to headhunt ing warriors (keba) about to fight." Despite these signs of personal awareness of the origins and power of kimbo, local knowledge evi dently varies greatly from village to village. Everyone seemed certain that kimbo were old, dating from well before Christianity arrived. But no one knew July 2001 109</page><page sequence="8">how, when or where kimbo were made, though some suggested that enquiries should be made in the more isolated villages and islands. For the record, they noted that well over 70% of the kimbo were made from shell carrying sand stones, mostly coarse and light, with another 20% or so were made from similar but finer grained sand stones. Five or six kimbo were heavier, pecked, and might have a volcanic element. Thick dark patinas gave external colors of sandy tan, various browns and some yellowish browns, except where careless over-cleaning, probably done with the ubiquitous big blunt bush knives, had left some surfaces scraped and scarred. Interior colours ranged from light grey green through to orange brown. None were red or black. An opportunity arose for some cross checking when Dr Peter Sheppard of Auckland University's archaeological team returned in July 1999 to con tinue their work near Nusa Roviana. He showed xerox copies of several kimbo from that area to trust ed friends from nearby villages, but these elders said none of them had ever seen anything like these kimbo. They thought some of the names a bit famil iar, but more likely to be from the people in Marovo. Similarly Kenneth Roga, the local cultural affairs officer in Gizo, who has visited hundreds of shrines, did not think these kimbo could be from Roviana, and thought enquiries should be made on Nggatokae ( Shepherd pers. com. 17 July 1999). By contrast however when asked during a brief official visit to New Zealand, Willington Pindaru of Patutiva in Morovo, proved well acquainted with kimbo. He said all such small stone figures were called kimbo. He had never heard any called beku. They were found, he said, in special tambu places that are still tambu today for some villagers. However he thought no-one would be at all con cerned now if kimbo were sent to Honiara, or New Zealand or elsewhere. He confirmed that stone kimbo are a separate art form distinct from nguzun guzus, and said that while some kimbo have bodies, none stand up, all sit down. He said that kimbo had "other roles in taem bifor when there were other Gods," and was not very sure whether anyone talks to those gods today through kimbo. He felt sure kimbo are not made now, unless on Ranonga, and are not still used, unless on Ranonga "and in Roviana." Finally Willington Pindaru was sure that some kimbo are very old, "much much older than the arrival of Christianity in Marovo in 1912." Confirmation of the considerable age of all the kimbo in the new collection came from an unex pected source. Several geologists were invited to examine them all minutely initially to confirm absolutely that none of them were pottery. They did so, and in addition, they declared unreservedly that the ingrained dirt, debris and crystal blooms found deep in the various cracks and holes in the kimbo could not have been put there recently, but were consistent with an old age. Overall the strongest impression is of diversity, in material and style, and in execution too. One kimbo has eyes with circular shell. Another kimbo is a near ly bald man guffawing who could easily be taken for a jovial European singer. One wears a brimless top hat, another looks like a partly carved pebble, anoth er has a broad support stand while its face is a bit like a stylized Mohawk Indian brave, and yet anoth er has a carrying string. One highly decorated kimbo from Roviana has no stylistic matches at all, while one from near Munda carries a decorated bowl on its head. The dog from Morovo is beamingly happy but in every way unique. The two rings mentioned earlier form a searate class: One from Sasavele near Munda, called 'Ko may,' has four kimbo-like figures, linked in pairs, with shell circle inlaid eyes. The other ring, from Kia in Isabel is a very soft, light greenish yellow muddy sandstone talc, lightly carved to show in low relief on the outer rim two stout females, full frontal with pendulous breasts, and on the two sides a frigate bird motif like those common in Malaita and the Eastern Solomons. It too is unique, and though both rings were called kimbo by their sellers, in reality they resemble the other kimbo only in name. However apart from these few exceptions, the remainder of the new collection has a coherence and unity that establishes kimbo as a new-found, traditional art form that was once widespread throughout the'Western Province.' Conclusion It is noteworthy that in searching the scattered and fragmentary historical and recent records, I found many comments to be unfortunately, in effect, unusable. This is because all too often generaliza no Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="9">tions have been made that combine information from discrete language and village groups whose customs are likely to be as much dissimilar as simi lar. Generalizing may be convenient for writers, and comforting for students, but in the Solomons con text, it is often inaccurate and unhelpful. This is par ticularly so in the western parts of the Solomons where village by village differences are so marked. For in the held it is abundantly clear that neigh boring villagers frequently do not agree even on basis names for common objects, let alone concur on abstract issues and functional matters. Broad prov inances, island-by -island, are no longer adequate now that several very different kastom areas can be identified on each island. At this stage of research, such over-generalisations serve only to obscure the extraordinary diversity of peoples, lifestyles, cus toms and language present in the western Solomons traditionally and still today. For example, Solomons people have never lived and thought in neat geographic entities such as island-by-island labels like 'New Georgia,' 'Isobel,' and 'Choiseul,' and even now the nation is adopt ing only reluctantly foreign concepts like 'Western Province' and a separate Bougainville, (e.g. Dureau 1998:205) This diversity continues because in addi tion to a myriad of very local 'kastoms' continuing from village to village, the Solomons still have 76 distinct languages spread among less than 400,000 people. Linguistic studies suggest that valid, useful, geographical 'cultural entities' do exist, backing up the traditional convergences that every local knows intuitively continue to link culturally wantok (lit. 'one talk,' or the same language) and other tradi tional groups. For example, on cultural issues local people know that northern Choiseul is linked inex tricably with Bougainville; that northern Malaita is similarly linked with southern Isabel; that southern Malaita, Ugi, Ulawa and parts of Makira share much in common culturally; and that Marovo was closely linked traditionally with Simbo and has centuries old linkages with Kia in Isobel too. But with very few exceptions, especially in the West, these basic culture entities' and their para meters seem so far to have escaped the literature entirely, while some studies continue to go on mix ing Solomons apples with oranges' unfruitfully. General comparisons of funerary customs, or fish ing, or art styles, on Eddystone (Simbo) with those in culturally distinct Santa Ana, or those in far off Santa Cruz, were perhaps the best that could be done last century. But there is no excuse now for fail ing to be much more attuned to the diversity and depth present in Solomons and to dealing instead with each internal sub-cultural, or 'kastom,' entity in its own right. On reflection, perhaps the most valuable message from this first study of kimbo is the conclusion that the focus of anthropological research on the Solomons' material culture, needs urgently to be narrowed down much more to village and wantok levels before the substantial body of remaining tra ditional knowledge is lost forever. Only after much more of that detailed work has been done, and done in accord with local kastom entities, are broader gen eralisations likely to be in order. Acknowledgements I would like to thank everyone who provided advice and help with this paper, but particularly Claire Clark who examined each kimbo minutely to ascertain its parent rock and the presence of very slow forming crystals etc. Neil Penman took the photographs. Special mention is merited too of Jari Kupianen who read and commented on an earlier draft after interviewing various informants in Marovo on kimbo and other related traditional issues. Professor Deborah Waite kindly suggested some changes and refereed the final version.
