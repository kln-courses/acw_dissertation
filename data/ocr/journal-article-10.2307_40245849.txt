The most thoroughgoing study of Nietzsche's im- pact on the British literary scene provides excellent accounts of the very considerable effect of his writings on John Davidson, Havelock Ellis, W.B. Yeats, Bernard Shaw, and others, but fails even to men- tion Hardy.1 To date we have no critical account of the whole range of Hardy's published and unpublished responses to Nietzsche to- gether with attention to historical considerations which help to ex- plain their negative character. Yet such an explanation would appear to be a desideratum in view of passages from Hardy's writings which suggest real, though limited, affinities with Nietzschean ideas. The most obvious exam- ple is Hardy's poem, "God's Funeral" (1908-10). As its title indi- cates, the poem dramatizes the "God is dead" theme familiar to readers of Thus Spake Zarathustra and Joyful Wisdom. Using lan- guage and imagery highly reminiscent of Nietzsche, Hardy depicts the very funeral procession of God, here referred to as a "man- projected Figure" imagined by men in their need. God's followers and mourners lament that "uncompromising rude reality" has brought down their deity. The persona in this work tries in vain to lessen the general gloom by pointing to an ambiguous "pale yet positive gleam" on the horizon. In the end he too finds insufficient certitude there and "mechanically" follows the other mourners.2 In a companion poem, "A Plaint to Man" (1909-10), Hardy devel- ops the same theme but from a different perspective. This time the dying God himself is the speaker. As he dwindles "beneath the dei- cide eyes of seers," God speaks to man, his maker, expressing won- derment at human need which would invest a figment with powers that are man's own. Now with the imminent disappearance of God must come recognition of the long unfaced truth: dependence must be placed on "the human heart's resource alone. . . ."3 Despite the partial affinities with Nietzschean ideas suggested by these passages, Hardy's stated views of the German thinker are chief- ly adverse. In six references to Nietzsche from about 1898 to 1914 403</page><page sequence="2">404 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES Hardy expressed serious reservations about the man or his works. On various other occasions he wrote out passages from Nietzsche or made extracts of writings about him.4 Taken together, the existing pub- lished and unpublished data give us a means of tracing Hardy's atti- tudes towards Nietzsche through these years and of exploring some of the factors which affected his views. The earliest indication of Hardy's awareness of Nietzschean ideas falls during the period that he was writing Jude the Obscure and well before Nietzsche's works had been translated into English. In one of his literary notebooks now in the Dorset County Museum, Hardy in early January of 1894 copied a passage from a volume entitled Key- notes, a book of short stories by a Nietzschean enthusiast, who wrote under the pen-name of "George Egerton." The author was an icono- clastic early feminist who had lived in Scandinavia, where Nietzsche was beginning to have some impact on Strindberg and others. The passage is taken from Egerton's lively account of woman's true nature in contrast to romantic stereotypes of her. A key to certain female contradictions is found in "the untamed primitive savage temperament that lurks in the mildest, best woman," however much this tempera- ment might fail to approximate expectations of her. Noting the ten- dency of men to prefer a "model on imaginary lines" to reality, Eger- ton observes that "when a Strindberg or a Nietzche [sic] arises and peers into the recesses of [woman's] nature and dissects her ruth- lessly, the men shriek louder than the women, because . . . the gods they have set up are dear to them." In related remarks copied by Hardy, Egerton launched an attack, possibly inspired by Nietzsche, on "artificial morality" which results in a ceaseless "struggle between instinctive truths and cultivated lies."5 The relevance of both passages to central issues in Jude and to the difficulties with puritanical re- viewers which Hardy had experienced since the publication of Tess oftheD'Urbervilles (1891) helps to explain his interest in them. There is also some evidence that Hardy was aware of the British journalistic attack of this period on Nietzsche. In an undated note- book entry entitled "Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals," Hardy copied one sentence from an unidentified newspaper: " 'Mr. Crawfurd con- siders than N's sounder doctrines were put forth during his early life, &amp; that his later utterances were tainted with insanity.' (Newspaper)." Following this entry is one sentence of evaluation by Hardy: "The latter words are true enough."6 These words, of course, suggest some acquaintance by Hardy with "Nietzsche's later utterances," but other- wise merely reflect the tendency of contemporary British reviewers learning something of Nietzsche's mental breakdown to write off as many as possible of his works. Much of the unfavorable response seems to have been fostered by Max Nordau's Degeneration (English translation, 1895), a virulent attack on the "decadence" of Nietzsche,</page><page sequence="3">WILLIAMSON 405 Baudelaire, Wilde and others. British reviewers were all too ready to repeat Nordau's pungently phrased attack on Nietzsche as egoistic, brutal, incoherent, and insane.7 Even more temperate critics like Seth Pringle-Pattison and William Barry expressed sharp disapproval of Nietzsche's thought and literary style.8 This criticism seems not to have prevented Hardy from occasion- ally finding a Nietzschean pronouncement worth preserving in his literary notebook, however. For example, in late 1899 or early 1900 he copied a passage from Thomas Common's translation of the Pref- ace to The Case of Wagner. In accordance with Hardy's occasional practice of supplying topical headings for his notebook entries, it might have been (but was not) entitled "Self -Overcoming," for it is part of Nietzsche's account of his attempt to overcome Wagner and Schopenhauer in himself: "What does a philosopher firstly + lastly require of himself? To overcome his age in himself, to become 'time- less.' With what, then, has he to wage the hardest strife? With the characteristics in which he is just the child of his age."9 Later references to Nietzsche occur in Hardy's notes on an Acad- emy book review of Maurice Maeterlinck's work, The Buried Temple and in Hardy's published reply to remarks made by the reviewer. In a notebook entry of early May, 1902, Hardy copied portions of the review including the reviewer's antithesis between Maeterlinck's plea for justice in human relations and Nietzsche's naturalistic ethics. Hardy's reply, published in the issue of 17 May 1902, while rejecting suggestions by Maeterlinck and his reviewer that there might be a kind of inscrutable morality in nature, accepted the interpretation of Nietzsche as a moral Darwinian and agreed that Nietzschean ethics were unacceptable: ". . . to model our conduct on Nature's apparent conduct, as Nietzsche would have taught, can only bring disaster to humanity."11 A notebook entry of late 1902 shows Hardy still seeking guidance as to the central emphasis of Nietzsche's thought. The entry is a quo- tation of several paragraphs from an article in a philosophical journal with a brief comment by Hardy. In this article the author, Julius Goldstein, finds the "keynote" to Nietzsche's work in his reaction to the impact of Darwinistic naturalism and post-Hegelian mate- rialism on man's understanding of his place in nature and his relation to his Creator. According to Goldstein, Nietzsche perceived that these intellectual forces made belief in a transcendental world, God, and the immortality of the human soul henceforth impossible. "The death of God" is therefore seen to be the basis of Nietzsche's attack on Christian morals and his attempted ethical transvaluation.12 Hardy's note at the conclusion of his quotations from Goldstein sug- gests that at this date he is still interested in "placing" Nietzsche in relation to the philosophical tradition with which he is familiar:</page><page sequence="4">406 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES "Then through Darwin, Hackel [i.e., Ernst Haeckel] : + through Schopenhauer [,] Nietzsche."13 Another notebook entry of 1902 attests to Hardy's awareness of central emphases of Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy. The entry con- sists of quotations from Arthur Symons' review of a French trans- lation of the work, especially of Symons' discussion of the Nietz- schean concepts of tragedy as an elaboration of the original choric "nucleus" of the play and of the creative dialectic of the Apollonian and Dionysiac tendencies in Greek life and art. As an English trans- lation of the work was not available until 1909, Symons' review was probably a means of acquainting Hardy with these Nietzschean ideas. The entry closes with a quotation which touches on considerations later to become thematically important to The Dynasts: "To Nietz- sche the world and existence justify themselves only as an aesthetic phenomenon, the work of a god wholly the artist: ' + in this sense the object of the tragic myth is precisely to convince us that even the horrible and monstrous are no more than an aesthetic game, played with itself by the Will in the eternal plenitude of its joy.' [The Birth of Tragedy, xxiv] The Will' is Schopenhauer's 'Will,' the vital principle."1* Another notebook entry shows Hardy's awareness of a discussion by Nietzsche of the effects of beauty. An undated entry grouped with notes of the 1909-10 period sets out a partial translation of Section 149 of Human, All-Too-Human, Part I, a work which received no full English translation before Helen Zimmern's version of 1909. The trans- lation is not Zimmern's however; various strikeovers and substitutions, indicated in the quotation below, suggest that Hardy was rather labo- riously translating the passage himself: The noblest kind of beauty is that which does not violent ravish by a single stroke, does not deliver st-^Fmy assault* + intoxicating assaults, (- which quickly provokes distaste) but which slowly insinuates itself, which which thus- one carries with him almost unconsciously, but- on a one one day, in a dream, fee-sees before him; + which finally, after having held us modestly by the heart for a long while, takes possession of us completely filling our eyes with tears; our heart with desire [.] Nietzsche15</page><page sequence="5">WILLIAMSON 407 Hardy's subsequent references to Nietzsche all occur in letters written around the time of the outbreak of World War I. His view of Nietzsche on the eve of the war is clearly indicated in a letter of early summer, 1914, written in answer to a request that he support a project to commemorate the seventieth anniversary of Nietzsche's birth with a monument to be raised in Weimar.16 Hardy's reply to this request contained strictures on Nietzsche rather than promise of support for the memorial. Following the general line of British critics who had been troubled by the incoherence of Nietzsche's writings, Hardy also raised the question of originality: "It is a question whether Nietzsche's philosophy is sufficiently coherent to be of great ultimate value, and whether those views of his which seem so novel and striking appear thus only because they have been rejected for so many centuries as inadmissible under humane rule." He particularly objected to Nietzsche's emphasis on the efficacy of "human masterfulness," an emphasis which he thought failed to take account of imperfections in the order of nature itself. He imputed to Nietzsche the assumption that the universe is "a perfect machine which only requires thorough handling to work wonders." In fact, Hardy observed in a statement which tells us more about his own blend of environmentalism and humanitarianism than it does about Nietzsche, the converse is true; "to do good with an ill-working instrument [i.e., Nature] requires endless adjustments and com- promises" (Life, II, 160). For Hardy the events of August 1914 were awesome confirma- tion of his fears about the outcome of "masterfulness" as a principle in international affairs. As early as 1902, at the close of the Boer War, he had seen "disaster to humanity" as the inevitable consequence of "naturalistic" morality. Again, in The Dynasts (1904-08) he had dramatized the ghastly results of Napoleon's relentless efforts to im- pose his will by force on the peoples of Europe. Now the outbreak of hostilities on a vaster scale destroyed his melioristic hopes for "the gradual ennoblement of man" (Life, II, 165). Like many others of his epoch confronted for the first time by the horrors of twentieth century warfare, Hardy at first doubted that civilization itself would survive.17 Almost immediately, however, he began to try to understand the causes of the war, including the character and outlook of "Young Germany." By late September, 1914, he had read J.A. Cramb's extra- ordinary mixture of prophecy, mysticism, and intellectual history, Germany and England (1913), a work which is the immediately relevant background of Hardy's subsequent remarks about Nietz- sche.18 Beginning with an account of the divergent national interests of England and Germany, Cramb comments on the importance of Nietzsche and his followers in shaping the bellicose frame of mind</page><page sequence="6">408 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES which made it "inevitable" that Germany would make war on England. For example, Nietzsche's influence is discovered in General von Bern- hardi's widely-read Germany and the Next War (1912) with its empha- sis "not merely on how Germany could make war on England most effectively, but why Germany ought to make war on England."19 Similarly Cramb finds Nietzschean inspiration for the "religion of Valour" of "Young Germany," its emphasis on "the glory of action, heroism, the doing of great things" - especially in relation to the goals of German inperialism. Together with the example of Napoleon and the teachings of Heinrich von Treitschke (1824-96), the inspirer of pan-Germanism, the philosophy of Nietzsche is taken to be de- cisive in the formation of contemporary German character. Cramb explicitly identifies Nietzsche with both German military expan- sionism and with the development of the new "world-religion" of secular existentialism.20 Hardy's astringent reactions to Germany and England included attention to Nietzschean ideas. As he had done before the outbreak of the war, Hardy expressed scepticism about the efficacy of will- directed force in bringing about authentic improvement in the quality of human life: "But it seems to me that Nietzsche, Treitsneke [sic] , Cramb, and all of the school (if it can be called a school) insanely re- gard life as a thing improvable by force to immaculate gloriousness, when all the time life's inseparable conditions allow only clumsy op- portunities for amelioration by plodding compromises and contriv- ances." Strong exception is also taken to Cramb 's "inordinate admira- tion for the German idea of power" and the ill-merited praise which he lavished on both Napoleon and the Junkers (Meynell, pp. 279-80). In early October of 1914 Hardy expressed most of these views pub- licly in a letter to the editor of The Manchester Guardian. The im- mediate occasion was the German bombardment of Rheims Cathedral, an edifice whose magnificent thirteenth century Gothic architecture Hardy had studied during the days of his architectural apprenticeship in the 1860's. Now, stung by the thought of damaged mouldings and shattered stained glass, he was drawn to raise the question whether the shelling could have been accidental or whether it had to be re- garded as "an object-lesson of the German ruling caste's will to power." In the latter event, Hardy would impute the event to a "disastrous blight" on Germany brought by the writings of Nietzsche and his "followers," Treitschke, Bernhardi, and others. As had Nordau before him (Nordau, p. 472), Hardy finds the extent of Nietzsche's influence in Germany both outrageous and puzzling: "I should think there is no instance since history began of a country being so demoralised by a single writer, the irony being that he was a megalomaniac and not truly a philosopher at all." Hardy infers that intellectuals in Germany and elsewhere have been dazzled by the "bombastic poetry" of Nietz-</page><page sequence="7">WILLIAMSON 409 sche's writings and have thus been uncritical about the substance of his remarks. He observes that in Nietzsche "off-hand assumptions" replace argument, and he adds a realist's anathema: "His postulates as to what life is on this earth have no resemblance to reality."21 This summary dismissal of Nietzsche's ideas, aphoristic method, and style was sure to elicit annoyed response from the growing num- ber of the philosopher's British adherents, several of whom were eager to make it clear that Nietzschean ideas had little or nothing to do with German militarism. Within days effective rebuttals appeared both in the Guardian and in the London papers. The defenders of Nietzsche included Thomas Beecham, C.M.S. McLellan, and Beatrice Marshall.22 Of these, Beecham 's comments best indicate the grounds of informed dissatisfaction with Hardy's remarks. This critic con- tested Hardy's designation of the German nationalists Treitschke and Bernhardi as "followers" of Nietzsche and pointed out that this view failed to take account of Nietzsche's status as a "good Euro- pean," his many denunciations of German nationalism, and his par- ticular detestation of Treitschke.23 In a brief reply to his critics published in the Guardian, Hardy ad- dressed the views of those like Beecham who felt that Nietzsche's ideas had been misrepresented. Without offering any detailed or sys- tematic counter-rebuttal, he pointed out that his limited remarks on Nietzsche were guiltless of some of the errors of interpretation attrib- uted to them. He noted that he had not claimed that Nietzsche him- self was German, pro-German, or that he antedated his "follower," Treitschke. On the other hand, Hardy cited several passages from Thus Spake Zarathustra to support his earlier comment about the consequences of Nietzsche's emphasis on the will to power: "Ye shall love peace as a means to new wars, and the short peace better than the long. ... I do not counsel you to conclude peace but to conquer. . . . Beware of pity."24 Despite his sharp disagreement with the principle of "human masterfulness" as it was reflected in these exhortations, Hardy professed himself to be in agreement with other (unspecified) Nietzschean dicta. We can only speculate that the author oîjude the Obscure might find something to admire in Nietzsche's iconoclasm and attacks on religious hypocrisy. By 1914, however, Hardy admitted that he had not looked at writings by Nietzsche "for years." After objecting once more to the incoherence of Nietz- sche's writings, Hardy concluded his letter with the assertion that for most of those "who have lived long enough to see the real colour of life and who have suffered," Nietzsche's views could not command assent.25 It should be noted that there is no evidence that Hardy ever altered the opinions of Nietzsche expressed in these remarks. The largely negative cast of the opinions is attributable to several main causes, the most basic of which was the manner of Hardy's intro-</page><page sequence="8">410 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES duction to Nietzsche's writings. As was true of other Britons of his day, Hardy became acquainted with Nietzsche's writings through frequently unidiomatic English translations, e.g., Tille's renderings of Thus Spake Zarathustra. Again like many of his contemporaries, he encountered Nietzsche's writings decidedly out of the order of their difficulty of style and expository method. English translations of the less accessible middle and late works began to appear in the 1890's and it is likely that Hardy's repeated objection against Nietzsche's incoherence is directly related to the aphoristic method employed in these works. Hardy's opinion of Nietzsche seems also to have been partly con- ditioned by the highly unfavorable climate of popular response to Nietzsche which followed in the wake of Nordau's Degeneration. Although the notebooks show that he was aware of appreciative and informed discussions such as those by Arthur Symons and Julius Goldstein, his own expressed opinions before 1914 closely approxi- mate the reservations about Nietzsche expressed by many other con- temporary reviewers. As was perhaps inevitable after Nordau's sen- sationalistic attack, much of this popular response was colored by the implications of Nietzsche's mental illness. Although Hardy found some of Nietzsche's pronouncements worth copying in his literary notebook, the psychiatric label "megalomania" greatly impaired his appreciation of Nietzsche as a philosopher. Hardy's unsympathetic reaction was also a consequence of his view that Nietzschean "masterfulness" was basically incompatible with his own ethical emphasis. For Hardy human compassion was the only recourse from insentient or malign natural forces; for Nietzsche it was an element of slave morality. Especially through the efforts of Alexander Tille and Thomas Common, Nietzschean thought came to be regarded as an extension of Darwinism to ethics. Hardy looked on such a "naturalistic" ethics with profound mis- givings, for, like T.H. Huxley, he rejected the struggle for existence as a basis for morals. Though never in disagreement with Nietzsche that accepted ethical dictates often fail to correspond to natural facts, Hardy was convinced that to model individual or national conduct on the apparent conduct of Nature was to invite disaster. From Hardy's letters, it is clear that he saw World War I as a dis- aster attributable to the ethical principles he rejected. After reading Cramb's Germany and England in 1914, Hardy joined many other Britons in identifying Nietzsche's teachings as a primary cause of German militarism. Given the circumstances discussed here, it appears doubtful that Hardy ever possessed a comprehension of Nietzsche's philosophy as a whole. He left no indication that he understood such vital Nietz- schean concepts as the over-man and the revaluation of all morals.</page><page sequence="9">WILLIAMSON 411 Although we need not question his claim in 1914 that he "heartily agreed" with many of Nietzsche's sayings, we must conclude that the agreement did not extend to Nietzsche's central ideas and that it was over-shadowed by his understanding of war as the inevitable conse- quence of the Nietzschean will to power.26 EUGENE WILLIAMSON • University of Alabama NOTES 1.

The word "positive" suggests a pun on the positivism of Auguste Comte and of British Comtians such as Frederic Harrison. For Hardy's view of the necessity of an alliance between religion and rationality "unless the world is to perish," see the introductory "Apology" (1922) to Late Lyrics and Earlier (Collected Poems, 4th ed.

The Times report of the bombardment had em- phasized both the "wanton deliberation" of the shelling and the "irretrievable damage" resulting from it (The Times, 21 September 1914, p. 8). 22. For brief descriptive comments on these responses to Hardy's letters see Nancy V. Snider, "An Annotated Bibliography of English Works on Nietzsche," Diss., University of Michigan, 1962, pp. 51, 70-71. 23.

See "Of War and Warriors" and "Of the Pitiful," Thus Spake Zarathustra: A Book for All and None, trans. Alexander Tille (1896; rpt. New York and London: Mac- millan, 1906), pp. 60, 122. Hardy's sole departure from Tille 's rendering is the word "coun- sel," a substitution for "advise." 25.Manchester Guardian, loc. cit. Hardy's reply was vigorously supported by "The Philosophy of Savagery," a Guardian editorial. The view that Nietzschean ideas were ulti- mately responsible for the war had already been advanced some weeks earlier in the London Times. See, e.g., Robert Bridges' call for a "holy war" against a nation whose "apostle is Nietzsche" (The Times, 2 September 1914, p. 9). An editorial of the same date observed that "War to Treitschke, and General Bernhardi, and to all the conscious or unconscious followers of Nietzsche is noble and splendid in itself" (p. 9). 2 6.
