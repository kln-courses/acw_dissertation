<plain_text><page sequence="1">PERIODICAL LITERATURE CONDUCTED BY DR ALEXANDER F. CHAMBERLAIN [NOTE.-Authors, especially those whose articles appear in journals and other serials not entirely devoted to anthropology, will greatly aid this department of the American Anthropologist by sending direct to Dr A. F. Chamberlain, Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts, U. S. A., reprints or copies of such studies as they may desire to have noticed in these pages. - EDITOR.] GENERAL Abraham (0.) und von Hornbostel (E.). Ueber die Bedeutung des Phonographen fiir vergleichende Musikwissenschaft. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1904, xxxvI, 222-236.) More exact investigation of music as a psychological and culture character of human races is desirable. The relations between text and music (difference of spoken and sung language, etc.) can be studied with the aid of the phonograph. Japanese and Siamese music has already revealed interesting facts. A brief sylla- bus for workers is given on pp. 232-233. The lack of relation among the Arabs between the meter of their poems, which has no mora, and music, as Dr Hartmann pointed out, is another curious fact. von Andrian (F.) Dr Wilhelm Hein. (Mitt. d. Anthr. Ges. in Wien, 19o4, xxxIv, 84-85.) Brief biography with notes on scientific activities. Bartelletti (Veturia) Sugli individui a capelli rossi. (A. per l'Antr. e la Etnol., Firenze, 1903, XXXIII, 277-281. ) General discussion with particular refer- ence (and statistics) to Italy and France. Red hair is an anomaly, having more affinities with the blond than the brunet type, and is a product of the inter- mixture of blonds and brunets. Bauer (M.) Beitrige zur anthropologi- schen Untersuchung des harten Gaumens. (A. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., 1904, N. F., II, 159-184, I pl., I fg.) Gives details, with measurements, of examination of the hard palate in 214 skulls (European 101o, Asiatic 57, African 22, American 10, Australasian and Polynesian io). B. concludes that the torus palatinus "Iis neither a fixed race-character nor a speci- fic pathological stigma." The parabo- loid form of the hard palate is most com- mon in man, the ellipsoid U-form least. The height index of the hard palate is a new index. Becker (C. H.) Panislamismus. (A. f. Religw., Lpzg., 1904, vii, 168-192.) Discusses the recent development of " Pan-Islamism " and the chief literature of the subject. In Persia no signs of this movement are to be found, for the sceptical Shiites rule the realm of the Shah. In Sunnite Islam, however, the doctrine of " Pan-Islam " has grown up, stimulated by the interference of the European world in the affairs of Africa and Asia. The long latent idea of "Pan- Islam" has now become a movement, with a political side that is opportunist. Bertholon (L.) Note sur les marques sin- cipitales de certains craines antiques. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1904, ve s., v, 55-56.) Cites Herodotus as to the nomad Libyans burning children on top of the head as a primitive medical proc- ess. The Guanches, certain Amerinds, did the same; neolithic man also. Brown (C. F.) "The Long 'Hidden Friend," by John George Hohman. (J. Amer. Folk-Lore, Boston, 1904, xvII, 89-152.) Reprint, with introduction and explanatory notes, of Hohman's The Long Hidden Friend (Carlisle, Pa., 1863), a famous American book of folk- medicine, based on the " Gipsy Book," the " German Centennial Almanac," the " Book of Albertus Magnus," etc. 720</page><page sequence="2">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 721 Chamberlain (A. F.) Proverbs in the making : Some scientific common-places. (Ibid., 161-170.) First section of article listing Nos. 1-205 of "familiar quota- tions" or "gefliigelte Worte" from modern scientific and literary authorities embodying succinct statements of scien- tific facts and fancies. In memoriam : Frank Russell. (Ibid., 208-209. ) Brief sketch of life and activities, with list of folklore pub- lications. Race-character and local color in proverbs. (Ibid., 28-31.) Compares, under 45 headings (English proverbs), the proverbs of the Yoruba of western Africa and the Negro-English of Guyana. Based on Bowen and Wullschligel. (and I. C.) Studies of a child. I. (Ped. Sem., Worcester, Mass., 19o4, xI, 264-291.) Gives linguistic and psy- chologic data from observation of authors' child : Affirmation and negation, analogy, argument, comparison, definition, fear, imagination, nature-observation, obiter dicta, poetry and song, right-handedness, stories, spontaneous words and language, talk, time, etc. Many specimens of the child's "original" language are given; also records of her conversation. This spontaneous speech has quite a primitive aspect. Clodd (E.) In memoriam. Frederick York Powell. 1850-1904. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1904, xv, 182-184.) Brief ap- preciation of character and work. Dr Powell was a lovable personality. His knowledge was so great as almost to in- hibit productivity of the highest order. At his death he was president of the Folk-Lore Society. Conradi (E.) Psychology and pathology of speech-development in the child. (Ped. Sem., Worcester, 1904, xI, 328- 380.) R6sumes, with bibliography of 92 titles, recent literature of the subject: Order of development of different sounds, recapitulation theory, word-invention, first word-meanings, stammering, stutter- ing, methods of curing stuttering. Au- thor takes an optimistic view of speech- defects. Dionne (N.-E.) Le phre S6bastien Rasles j6suite, missionnaire chez les Ab6naquis, 1657-1724. (Trans. R. Soc. Can., Ot- tawa, 1903, Ix, 117-134.) Contains interesting facts as to the character and labors of Father Rasles, author of an Abnaki dictionary. Farnell (L. R.) Sociological hypotheses concerning the position of women in ancient religion. (A. f. Religw., Lpzg., 1904, VII, 70-94. ) From study of data in classical literature, etc., concerning exclusion of men from ritual, prominence of women in the ritual of the hearth, prestige of virgins dedicated to deity, women as prophetesses, priestesses of male deities, prostitution as part of ritual, interchange of dress between the sexes, Amazons, exclusion of women from tem- ples and cults, male ministrants of female divinities, eunuch-priests, etc., the author concludes that "the matriarchate has not left so clear an impress on classical religion as has been supposed." More- over, "many of the curious phenomena in the relation of the sexes to cult are not necessarily distinctive indications of any special family-organization," and "the prevalence of a goddess and the prominence of women in the divine ser- vice can be due to other causes than matriarchy or gynaeocracy." Farrand (L.) The significance of mythol- ogy and tradition. (J. Amer. Folk-Lore, Boston, 1904, xvI, 14-23.) Address of President of American Folk-Lore Society. Discusses relations of ethnology and com- parative psychology, resemblances and differences, problem of dissemination, methodology of folk-lore investigations, value of mythology and tradition for ethnology - totemism, religion, etc. - racial psychology. Dr Farrand con- cludes that the reactions of a group, their customs and beliefs, can be interpreted only in the light of their collective ex- perience, and hence in the light of their traditions (these epitomize collective ex- perience). Civilization is not necessarily a gauge of mental evolution. Before claiming rank as an independent science folk-lore needs more exactness of method and right use of data. Gunkel (H.) Die Paradieseserzi~hlung. (Dtsche Rndsch., Berlin, 1904, xxxI, 53-78.) Treats of literary and mytho- logical aspect of story of Paradise as given in the book of Genesis. The legend hails from Mesopotamia, but Paradise itself had no local habitation. von Hansemann (D.) Ueber die rachi- tischen Verinderungen des SchAdels. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1904, xxxvI, 373- 383, 5 fgs.) Author holds that both</page><page sequence="3">722 AMERICANANTHROPOL OGIST [N. s., 6, 1904 for the anthropoids and for man rachitis is a disease of domestication (= civiliza- tion), caused in the latter by dwelling in closed spaces, influence of food, clothing, etc. Rachitis is said to be unknown among primitive peoples. In Japan it is absent, but will probably come with the adoption of European houses. In the skull rachitis induces a thickening of the bones. Craniotabes is not a real rachitic phenomena. The thickenings met with in rachitis are hyperostoses not exostoses. Rachitis often localizes in the upper orbital curves. The Neanderthal skull has no rachitic characters. Hunnewell (J. F.) Certain great monu- ments. (Proc. Amer. Antiq. Soc., Worcester, 1904, N. S., VI, 192-199.) Treats of the "pointed style of archi- tecture," its origin and distribution. Lang (A.) The origins of the alphabet. (Ftn. Rev., Lond., 1904, 634-645, 7 fgs. ) Discusses recent discoveries (Evans, Petrie, Don da Verga, etc.). Lang thinks that, in spite of the wide- spread Mediterranean signary, the honor of first evolving true alphabetic writing belongs to the Phoenicians. Dr Durkheim on " Social Origins." (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1904, XV, 100-102.) Replies to Dr D.'s critique of author's book. Dr D.'s rejoinder appears on pp. 215-216. Lehmann (J.) Die Pfahlbauten der Gegen- wart, ihre Verbreitung und genetische Entwicklung. (Mitt. d. Anthr. Ges. in Wien, 1904, XXXV, I19-51I, 2 maps, 14 fgs.) After general discussion of pile- dwellings, their nature and types (four chief ways of origin : platform on piles inside house as in C. America, Florida, Venezuela, etc.; utilization of roof sup- ports; hut as a whole on one or more piles, Lapland, New Guinea, New Zealand, Africa, etc.; hut on platform borne up by piles), treats of the Malay house, its congeners and distribution, African pile-structures (houses, gran- aries, etc.),-inhabited pile-dwellings are not very common in the " dark conti- nent.'" Dr L. gives xI reasons for the erection of pile-dwellings: Safety and refuge from human enemies, from wild animals, protection from floods, protec- tion from sand-dunes (Portugal), from moisture (northern S. America, Himal- ayan India, etc.), from stinging insects by night (Congo, marshy regions of white Nile), from dirt and vermin (Indonesia), on account of inequalities of the ground (Assam), to save room (Siam), for easy access to the water, for pleasure of water-residence (China), for purposes of commanding a wider outlook. The reasons for the pile-dwelling are functions of geographical relations, the structure itself a consequence of these. A good bibliography is appended. LOnborg (S.) Primitiva samh&amp;llen (Ymer, Stkhlm., 1904, xxIV, 129-156, 6 fgs., map.) Good r6sum6 of Schurtz's Altersklassen und Mdnnerbfinde (Ber- lin, 1902), with critical remarks. von Luschan (F.) Einige wesentliche Fortschritte in der Technik der physi- schen Anthropologie. (Z. f. Ethn., Ber- lin, 1904, xxxvI, 465-466.) Describes briefly the Martin glass-eye color table and another color table (with glass marbles) prepared by the author, con- taining 35 tones from the color of the most anoemic European to that of the darkest African. Mantegazza (P.) Emilio Zola sul tavolo anatomico. (A. per l'Antr. e la Etnol., Firenze, 1903, xxxIII, 343-350.) Re- sum6 and critique of Arthur MacDonald's study of Zola. Mantegazza, as is well known, opposes the Lombrosan dogmas as to the connection of genius and mad- ness. _--. Prime linee di psicologia positiva. (Ibid., 131-196, 351-348.) Sections xI-xxIV treating of hate, self-love, marks of the hierarchy, sense of property, sense of the good, the just and the true, the religious sense, the physics of thought, thought in the world of living matter, analysis of thought, logic and associa- tions, liberties and necessities, measure and value of thought, special characters of human thought, the psychic produc- tion of the individual. Many references to primitive peoples and to the child. Religions may be classed as atheism, totemism, fetishism, idolatry, pure deism, The psychic hierarchy has five great stages: Anthropomorphic (first child- hood), childhood, adolescent, youthful, adult. M. holds that no common man can become a genius by way of educa- tion and that no genius of the first order can be prevented from becoming distin- guished by the most adverse circum- stances. Genius and madness have no close relationship.</page><page sequence="4">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 723 Marett (R. R.) From spell to prayer. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1904, XV, 132-165.) Discusses Frazer's ideas of the relation- ship of magic and religion, the r81e of spell in magic, etc. Cites examples to show how "the spell passes by easy gradations into the prayer, the impera- tive into the optative." Concurrently with the personification and progressive deification of the instrument, the spell evolves into the prayer. The spoken word is the very type of a spiritual pro- jectile. Author holds that "once per- sonify, you are on the way to worship." Religion is a far wider and more com- plex thing than magic. Martinez (M.) Investigacion de la pa- ternidad. (An. Univ., Santiago de Chile, 1903, cxII-CxIII, 303-336.) R6- sum6s facts concerning the "recherche de la paternit6 " in various European and American countries. Mason (0. T.) The ripening of thoughts in common : "Common sense is thoughts in common." (Proc. Amer. Philos. Soc., Phila., 1904, XLIII, 148-155.) Dis- cusses topic under heads of biology, speech, industries, fine art, social life, learning and lore, religion. The pos- session of thoughts in common (coming down the age and gaining impetus as they roll) causes, incessantly and spon- taneously, similar words and actions. Telepathic influences in spiritual con- nections, if they exist, are the effect, not the cause, of striking coincidences. Bio- logic moving in concert is the natural forerunner of altruism in culture. Myers (C. S.) The taste-names of primi- tive peoples. (Brit. J. of Psych., Cambr., 1904, I, 117-126.) Treats of taste- names of Indo-Germanic peoples, native tribes of Africa, India, New Guinea, Torres Sts., New Hebrides, etc. Com- pares vocabularies denoting gustatory and other sensations. Dr M. finds that " sweetness" -- " tasting good "- a term applied also to saltness; word for saltness is derived from sea-water ; terms for salt and sour tend to be confused; there is no specific name for the bitter taste. He thinks it likely that "4the intimate connections between sensations of taste, touch, and emotional tone, to which the vocabularies of primitive peo- ples thus bear interest, date back to a very early period of phylogenesis." A good paper. Newell (W. W.) The Ignis fatuus, its character and legendary origin. (J. Amer. Folk-Lore, Boston, 1904, xVII, 38-6o.) A valuable comparative study, with bibliographical notes, of a Mary- land negro legend, "Jack-o'-my-lan- tern." The dialect and the name of the devil's wife are the only negro elements of importance. Mr N. holds that in the legends of this type (devil overcome), the adversary defeated was, in the older versions, not Satan but death. Olbrich (C.) Das Milchtrinken der Schlangen. (Mitt. d. Schles. G. f. Volksk., Breslau, 1904, 67-72.) Dis- cusses "milk-drinking" of snakes, as "an example of the strong influences exerted upon natural-history tradition by ancient ideas preserved in folk-belief." Cites from the literature of the subject I587-I901, A.D. Penka (K.) Karl von Ujfalvy. (Mitt. d. Anthr. Ges. in Wien, 1904, xxxIv, I81-I82.) Brief sketch of life and scientific activities of the distinguished Hungarian philologist and ethnologist. Von U. made a speciality of historical anthropology. Phillips (J. H.) Ethics in primary edu- cation. (So. Wkmn., Hampton, Va., 1904, XXXIII, 202-207. Author argues that: A graduated course of classical selections, beginning with fairy tales and myths, folk-lore, legends, and Bible stories, followed by stories of biography, heroism, and adventure, and leading gradually into the best that literature affords in poetry or in prose, constitutes the most efficient means of ethical de- velopment. Potter (M. A.) Additional variants of the father and the son contest. (Folk- Lore, Lond., 1904, xv, 216-220.) Vari- ants from the Hawaiian islands, the The- seus-.Egeus story, etc., in addition to the examples in the author's recent vol- ume on this theme. Powell (F. Y.) Tradition and its condi- tions. Presidential address, 1904, Folk- Lore Society. (Ibid., 12-23.) Prof. P. thinks that "the transmission-power of tradition has been very much under- valued." But collection must come before systematization, or material will disappear forever. Even bookless com- munities, however, have social machin- ery, "schools " (Druids, medieval Erin, etc. ) for preserving past knowledge. The</page><page sequence="5">724 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 6, 1904 Maori, in their wharekura, or " red house ", had a sort of "heathen univer- sity", besides "schools" of star-lore and of agriculture. Then there are dramas as remembrancers, historical plays, such as the Polynesian one of Cook and Omai, not forgotten 100oo years after the arrival of the famous navigator in 1777. And in many other cases, too, corroboration exists to prove the fact pre- served by tradition in some form or other. St. (L.) C. C. Swart, der erste Karto- graph des Nordens. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1094, LXXXV, 245-246.) Resumes ad- dress by Dr A. Bj6rnbo on Claudius Claussen Swart (b. 1388) before the Kgl. nord. arch. Ges. of Copenhagen. His is the Clavus map (ca. 1430) of the north, including Greenland,--later copies suggest that he may have even visited Greenland himself. He says of the Eskimo that they may have come from the north pole. Stavenhagen (W.) Ueber Seekarten. (Ibid., 217-221, 239-245.) Historical sketch. Usener (H.) Mythologie. (A. f. Re- ligw., Lpzg., 1904, vII, 6-32.) Treats of the nature and relations of religion and mythology, the scope and aims of their investigation, etc. Back of mytho- logical names lies a long period in which they were stamped. The extent of re- ligious ideas is incomparably greater than is generally believed. All the great ad- vances of culture (fire, agriculture) have their myths and their divine cults. A religious bond is absent nowhere. Christian saints follow heathen gods, and the church has simply glorified many primitive ideas. Language and poetry are bound up with mythology and re- ligion. Between folk and revealed re- ligion no essential differences exist from the point of view of creative activity of the poet. Mythology, properly con- ceived, must clarify our religious con- sciousness. Weissenberg (S.) Jiidische Statistik. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1904, LXXXV, 320- 323.) Risum6sJiidische Statistik (Ber- lin, 1903, pp. 452) published by the " Verein fiir jiidische Statistik," founded in 1902 by Dr A. Nossig. The total of the Jews in the world is, in round num- bers, II,ooo,ooo, of which considerably over I,ooo,ooo are in America and over 8,500,000 in Europe. Asia has somewhat more than half a million. While as a whole in all Europe the Jewish population is on the increase, the rate of increase as compared with that of the rest of the inhabitants has consider- ably decreased in some regions. Wilson (L. N.) Bibliography of child study. For the year 1903. (Ped. Sem., Worcester, 1904, xI, 292-327.) Lists, with topical index, 486 titles, many of them anthropological. Zaborowski (S.) Les protoaryens ont-ils connu les metaux? (R. mens. Ec. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1904, XIV, 207-219.) Discusses Indo-European metal-names. Z. concludes that "1the proto-Aryans knew copper as a metal and perhaps bronze (in its worked form), but nothing more." The profusion of terms in the Aryan tongue for "Iaxe " in general and in particular forms is noteworthy in con- trast with the penury of metal-names. Z. seeks to connect Latin raudus and its cognates with Sumerian urud. EUROPE B6rand (G.) Decouverte d'un nouvel instrument en pierre polie (galet polis- soir) dans les stations n6olithique du nord de 1'Arrt de Bressurie, cantons de Chatillon-sur-S~vre et de Cerizay, D6- partt des Deux-S vres. (Ibid., 237- 239, I fg. ) Describes implement found in i i neolithic stations out of 29 in this region, which author designates as a "polishing pebble." The large number occurring indicates some im- portant role in prehistoric industry. Bericht Uiber die im Jahre 19o3 in Oster- reich durchgefiihrten Arbeiten. (Stzgb. d. Anthr. Ges. in Wien, 1904, 28-60, 27 fgs.) R'sum6s of archeological investi- gations in Lower Austria (Mattula on " stations" at Retzbach, etc. ; von Baillou on Roman-period tumuli at Wiener-Neustadt and their contents), Upper Austria (Straberger), Carinthia (Frankl), Steiermark (Riedl), coast- country (Marchesetti on castellieri, and Moser on the excavations at the Pokala cave), Dalmatia (Buli'), Bohemia (Cermak on finds at Ctslau and Mo- covic, Richly on finds in southern Bo- hemia, von Wienzierl on finds in north- ern Bohemia, Schneider on finds at Smifitz, and Lindner on the bronze remains of Schmidgraben and Lhotic), Moravia (Kondelka on sporadic prehis-</page><page sequence="6">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 725 toric finds in Wischau; Mattula on finds in 'Znaim, Burgberg, Schattau, etc. ; Makowsky and Rzchak on archeology of Briinn), Bukowina (Romstorfer on minor finds and Kaindl on recent in- vestigations of the neolithic " station " of Szipenitz), Hungary, Darnay de Szent Mdrton on the Schomlauberg cemeteries and particularly the cemetery of Csab- Rendek. Bielenstein (A.) Das Kochen und der Kesselhaken der alten Letten. (Globus, Brnschwg, 1904, LXXXV, 181-183, 8 fgs.) This interesting account of old Lettic iron kettles and pot-hooks is ex- tracted from a forthcoming work by Dr B. on Die dlteste Kulturgeschichte der Letten. Blaschke (E.) Drei Spiele. (Mitt. d. Schles. G. f. Volksk., Breslau, 1904, 77-79.) Brief account of three Silesian folk-games: Onder siebna ufschtiehn, Battler und Scharndarm, MAster und Gesellen. Bi5ckel (0.) Das Volkslied der polnischen Oberschlesier verglichen mit der deut- schen Volkspoesie. (Ibid., 40-65.) Com- pares, as to material and form, the folk- songs of the Poles of Upper Silesia, as represented by Julius Rogers' Pie'ni Ludu Polskiego w G6rnym Szlaska (Breslau, 1863) and the partial transla- tions of Hoffmann von Fallersleben (1865) and Weiss (1867), with German folk-poetry. Rogers' collection contains 511 lyrics and 35 narrative songs. Braun (G.) Ueber Flaggen von Fischer- booten. (Globus, Brnschwg., 19o4, LXXXV, 253-256, 5 fgs.) Describes briefly the carved and painted wooden "flags" of the fishing vessels of the Kurische Nehrung, etc. Also the flags of the fishermen of Chioggia, near Ven- ice, which resemble them. These "flags" are of considerable ethnologic interest. Burne (Charlotte S.) Fifth of November customs. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1904, xv, o106-107. ) Author notes that there were more Guy Fox effigies in London than usual in 1903. A procession is briefly described. Capitan (L.), La question des 6olithes. (R. mens. Ec. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1904, XIV, 240-241.) R6sum6s investigations of Rutot. Dr C., who previously was against the " eoliths ", here declares his belief that these objects are really tools of man or of anthropoids as Rutot claimed. Dr C.'s own studies and the data in Rutot's La prehistorique dans ' Europe centrale ( Namur, 1903) have led to this new conclusion. von Chlingensperg auf Berg (M.) Der Knochenhiigel am Langacker und die vorgeschichtliche Herdstelle am Eisen- bichl bei Reichenhall in Oberbayern. (Mitt. d. Anthr. Ges. in Wien, 1904, xxxIv, 53-70, map, 9 pl.) Detailed description of the grave-mound of Lang- acker and the "station" of Eisenbichl, discovered and investigated by the author, and the remains there found-pottery in great quantity and much variety, bronze ornaments, needles, arrowpoints, bone weaver's shuttles, clay whorls, etc. Clark (M. S.) Pembrokeshire notes. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1904, xv, 195- 198.) Treats of harvest-customs, "Ipis- con-led," toothache charm, New Year's, Epiphany, May-day observances, etc. Corn-baby, A.

Sarkophag aus Hagra Tri- ada, Kreta. (A.. f Religw., Leipzig, 19o4, vII, 264-274.) Describes the sarcophagus discovered in July, 190o3, and now in the Candian Museum. The pictures and ornamentation represent the cult of the dead 13oo00 B. C. Ellis (H. C.) Monmouthshire notes. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1904, xv, 221.)

(Folk-Lore, Lond., 1904, xv, 102-Io3. ) Cites three instances of belief in the witch-figure charm. Graham (R. C.) On a legend from the island of Tiree. (Scot. Hist. Rev., Glas- gow, 1904, , ,113-122). Discusses the story of "O'Neil, and how his hair was made to grow," which, according to the author, "stands quite alone among the Highland legends." It belongs with the English The Smith and his Dame, and may also be related to the legend of St Eloy, a patron saint of the farriers. Hippe (M.) Zwei Breslauer Sagen. (Mitt. d. Schles. G. f. Volksk., 1904, 90o-119.) Detailed discussion of " Der Glockenguss" and "Die Hahnkrthe," the former the best-known and most popular folk-tale in Breslau. The oldest version of the first comes from Attendorn in Westphalia. The second seems to have been " made" by Fiilleborn on the basis of the story of " Henry the Lion of Brunswick." Hull (Eleanor) The story of Deirdre, in its bearing on the social development of the folk-tale. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1904, xv, 24-39.) Traces the development of this Irish folk-tale during the 6oo-700 years from the version in the 12th cen- tury book of Leinster ; to that contained in a Belfast Ms. of the I7th or I8th century. During that period the wild woman of the early tale has become a sort of Lydia Languish; the latter one has parted with the heroic elements of the older romance. Levarcham, the "keener," has turned into an affec- tionate old nurse. In a modern High- land version the tale is quite remodeled. Kahle (B.) Eine Vorschrift ftir Taufpaten. (Mitt. d. Schles. G. f. Volksk., Breslau, 1904, 66-67.) Discusses directions for god-parents (no one must go between them) and their folk-meaning. Kaindl (R. F.) Die Hochzeitsfeier bei den Ruthenen in Berhometh am Pruth, Bukownia. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1904, LXXXV, 281-288,1 8 fgs.) Detailed account of wedding-ceremonies, etc., among the Ruthenians on the Pruth. The events last four days, after which nothing but tippling occurs. There are many songs sung to bride and groom. Also dancing, music, eating and drinking galore. Kaiser (Thea) Landschaftliche Bilder aus Bosnien und Herzegowina.. (Ibid., 221- 226, 7 fgs.) Contains a few ethno- graphic notes - Bosnian mills, the dug- outs of Lake Pliva, ruins at Blagaj, etc. Karo (G.) Altkretische KultstAtten. (A. f. Religw., Lpzg., 1904, VII, 117-156, 38 fgs., I pl.) From this study of old Cretan cult-places, the author concludes that the old Achaean religion was inde- pendent - in spite of the close relations between Crete and Egypt, the Achaeans despised both the gods and the temple of the Nile-dwellers. The old Achaean cult was without temples or idols. The gods represented are rather the primitive forms of the Hellenic than derived from the Orient. The ancestors of the Achae- ans were forefathers of the Hellenes. Kjellmark (K.) Ofversikt af Sveriges stenAlderboplatser. (Ymer, Stkhlm., 1904, xxIv, 187-225, 9 fgs., map.) R6- sum6s data concerning " stations " of the stone age in Sweden, finds, etc. After somewhat detailed account of those of Jaravallen (near Limhamn) in the ex- treme S. W., and the flints there dis- covered, the author lists (with brief notes) 56 other stations from various parts of the mainland and the island of Gothland, embodying his investigations 19oo-1903. The Limhamn "stations" are probably contemporaneous with the Danish kitchen-middens of the older stone age. Some of the " stations" are very rich in stone implements and flints. The marked pottery of Limhamn is interesting. Krause (Hr) Ueber einen Knochen aus der Oborniker Kiesgrube. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1904, xxxvI, 524-526.) Argues that the marks on the Obernik bones exhibited by V. Chlapowski, were made by mice or similar rodents and not by man. Laloy (L.) Ethnographisches aus Siid- west-Frankseich II. Das Baskenland. (A. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., 1904, N. F. II, I85-I93, Io fgs.) Treats, in general terms, of the Basque language (an inde- pendent stock, with no great dialectic differences), farms, dwellings, agricul- ture (reforesting and use of the untilled flats are needed), clothing (national dress is disappearing), household utensils, domestic animals, fishery (St Jean de Luz is a typical fishing-town), games and dances (the national ball-game con-</page><page sequence="8">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERA 7URE 727 trasts with the Spanish bull-fight and the dances are remarkable for their modesty). But the Basques lose from day to day something in their old possessions and activities. Lehmann-Filh6s (M.) Die Waldfrage in Island. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1904, LXXXV, 258-260, I fg.) Compares present and past condition. In the ninth century Iceland was well wooded. Lef6vre (A.), Le Latium avant Rome. (R. mens. Ec. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1904, XIV, 229-236.) R6sumbs data concern- ing ancient inhabitants, traditions, myth- ology and religious ideas, etc. L. points out that the primitive area of the Latin was very restricted, and that re- ally ancient documents are absent. The indzgetes gods are discussed at some length. The agricultural divine series is the most complete. The people of an- cient Latium, their beliefs and customs, had a serious narveth and narrowness of mind contrasting with the joyous aclat of the Homeric Achaeans, etc. Lissauer (A.) Die Sammlung der "Ter- tiar-Silex" des Hrn. Klaatsch. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1904, xxxvI, 299-317.) Brief notes on the exhibition before the Anthropological Society of Klaatsch's collection of "tertiary flints" (from Cantal in southern France, and Kent and Sussex in England), with ensuing discussion. The artificial character of these flints and their interglacial origin were generally admitted, though, as Dr Branco observed, their user may not have been really so high a creature as man. Looff (W.) Erdhiitten inHolstein. (Glo- bus, Brnschwg., 1904, LXXXV, 169-170, 3 fgs.) Brief account of the earth- houses (17 in number) near Lentf6hr- den in Holstein, which resemble dwell- ings of prehistoric times. They are used by quarrymen in winter especially. These form a little community apart. All but one are bachelors, who lead a life corresponding to their estate. MacDonald (A.) Midsummer bonfires. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1904, xv, o105- io6.) In the valley of the Aberdeen- shire Dee, St John's Eve fires survive by reason of the fact that 115 years ago ten shillings a year was left for the pur- pose by a London merchant who had been herd-boy there. Mazegger (B.) Ein Jadeitbeil aus Tirol. (Stzgb. d. Anthr. Ges. in Wien, 1904, 6-7, I fg. ) Brief note on a true jadeite axe found near Cloz in 1903, the first of its kind in that region. Mehlis (C.) Ein zweite neolithische An- siedelung im Hasslocher Walde und ihre Keramik. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1904, LXXXV, I89-I90, 6 fgs.) Brief account of the second neolithic " sta- tion" in the Hassloch forest, discovered in 1903-o4, and the numerous pottery remains found there by Dr M. Four types are distinguished. A mixture of lake dwellings' art occurs in these neo- lithic " stations." Meringer (R.) Beitr-ge zur Hausfor- schung. (Mitt. d. Anthr. Ges. in Wien, 1904, XXXIV, I55-180, 98 fgs.) Treats of the nature of the Bosnian house, and its congeners; recent literature on the house and its furniture, the "Kachel- ofen " especially ; inn-signs (the develop- ment of the wood-shavings motif is cur- ious). In several respects the Bosnian house belongs to the "High Germanr " culture group, in others it departs much from this. In the region of Agram a type resembling the Bosnian occurs. Meyer (A. 0.) Schlesische Gedichte aus der Reformationszeit. (Mitt. d. Schles. G. f. Volksk., Breslau, 1904, 14-22.) Gives texts of several Christmas sayings, six love-songs, and a hymn from Ms. additions to a copy of the Mirabilia Ro- ma, (Niirnberg, 1491), dating from about the middle of the sixteenth century, mostly unedited. Milne (F. A.) and Nutt (A.). Arthur and Gorlagon. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1904, xv, 4o-67.) The translation by Mr Milne is from the Latin original edited by Prof. Kittredge of Harvard, the accompanying notes (pages 60-67) are by Mr Nutt. This Arthur romance was apparently unknown to students until the publication of Prof. Kittredge. von Miske (K.) Die ununterbrochene Besiedelung Velem St. Veits. (A. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., 1904, N. F. II, 29- 41, 68 fgs.) Cites archeologic and cul- ture-historical evidence to show that at Velem St Veit there was an uninter- rupted settlement of man from the neo- lithic period through the bronze, Hall- statt, and Le T?ne epochs of prehistory, and after this, during the Roman, Sla- vonic, and "folk-migration'' periods into</page><page sequence="9">728 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 6, 1904 the Middle Ages. The series offibul&amp; is particularly instructive. The new settlement, at the end of the neolithic period, was achieved peacefully. A sud- den large increase occurred with the bronze age. The fire-places also indicate permanent settlement. Die Bedeutung Velem St. Veits als prihistorische Gusstaitte mit Beriick- sichtigung der Antimon-Bronzefrage. (Ibid., 124-138, 62 fgs.) Velem St Veit is of great significance as having been, even in the pre-Cyprian import- periods, a factory for autochthonous bronze, and later a center for the dis- tribution of antimony bronze. Evidence from the bronze objects, refuse, molds, etc., to this effect is cited. Both finds and chemical analysis demonstrate that here was a culture-center in prehistoric times. - Gepunzte Bronzemesser aus Velem St. Veit. (Stzgb. d. Anthr. Ges. in Wien, 1904, 8-Io, 5 fgs.) Describes 5 bronze knives, with punched ornamenta- tion either on handle or blade, from Velem St Veit. Montelius (0.) Die Datierung des Stonehenge. (A. f. Anthr., Brnschwg, 1904, N. F. II, 139-141, I fg.) M. considers that Stonehenge was a temple built at least 3,500 years ago. Much (R.) Zur Ligurerfrage. (Stzgb. d. Anthr. Ges. in Wien, 1904, 8.) Dr M. thinks that the Ligurians were Indo-Germans and closely related to the Celts in language, etc. Niederleithinger (A. G.) Fund in Eibesthal, Nieder6sterrich. (Ibid., 6- 7, 2 fgs.) Brief note on discovery of skeleton and two pots. 01shausen (Hr) Ueber einen Ausflug nach Dr. Hahnes diluvialen Fundstitten bei Sch*nebeck a. E. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1904, XXXVI, 477-486.) Author concludes as a result of his observation of the Sch6nebeck finds that Hahne's material does not consist of artifacts of the intergiacial period--the stratum in which they were discovered has not been shown to be interglacial. Patroni (G.) La grotta preistorica del Zachito, presso Caggiano, Salerno. (A. per l'Antr. e la Etnol., Firenze, 1903, xxxIII, I197-216, 20 fgs.) The cave of Zachito represents the culture of "the oldest people who occupied southern Italy from time immemorial, the Siculi of his- tory." Bronze objects are lacking and the most important remains are ceramic, resembling those of the prehistoric " sta- tion" of Scoglio del Tonno, near Tar- rento. In this part of Italy has occurred a survival of neolithic population, culture, and ceramic art. Comparisons with Per- tosa are interesting. Peacock (Mabel) Notes on the Stamford bull-running. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1904, xv, 199-202.) Historical sketch. This "sport ", often cruel and savage, was put down with military aid in 1839-it had existed from time immemorial. The bullards, or bull-chasers, had a special song. Piette (E.) Classification des s6diments form6s dans les cavernes pendant 1'atge du renne. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, 1904, XV, 129-176, I p1., 73 fgs.) As the result of 28 years of investigation of the art-remains of the caves of the rein- deer epoch, P. concludes that the "glyptic age" covers two periods, the Gourdanian (engraving) and the Pap- alian (sculpture). The former subdivides into the stratu of engraving and har, poons of reindeer horn, of engraving with few or no harpoons, and of engraving with cut-out contours; the latter into strata of bas-relief sculpture and round boss-sculpture. The developments of engraving and sculpture are considered in some detail in their inter-relations. Pittard (E.) Contribution t l''tude an- thropologique des Tsiganes. Io Tsi- ganes dits Tatars. 20 Tsiganes dits Bul- gares. (Ibid., I77-187.) Gives results of measurements of 2 female and 13 male " Tatar Gypsies " of the Dobrudja, and 22 female and 48 male "Bulgarian Gypsies" from the Dobrudja (except two), taken in I9go. These Gypsies tend to be dolichocephalic, with average stature for men I.63-I.65m., the "Bul- garians" being a little taller than the " Tatars." Pradel (F.) Der Decem. (Mitt. d. Schles. G. f. Volksk., Breslau, 1904, 119-12I.) Gives text of a poem by Pastor Schu- mann (1759) on the occasion of the edict concerning the war-levy on the tithes of the Silesian clergymen. Regalia (E.) Sulla fauna delle grotte di Frola e Zachito, Caggiano, Salerno. (A. per l'Antr. e la Etnol., Firenze, 1903, xxxIII, 217-275, 6 fgs.) Inter- esting study of the fauna of noted Italian</page><page sequence="10">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 729 caves, whose human occupancy dates from 2000-1750 B. C. Three breeds of dogs, two of swine, three of cattle, two of sheep were known, besides the goat and the camel (probably adventi- tious over sea). The horse was lacking, also there were no domesticated birds. Remains of many wild animals occur. This is the first reported presence of the camel in prehistoric Italy, and Europe as well. Reinach (S.) La Crete avant l'histoire. II. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, 1904, xv, 257-296, 48 fgs.) R6sumes recent researches of Evans at Knossos, Halb- herr and Pernier at Phaestos and Hagia Triada, Hogarth and Bosanquet at Praesos, Palaeokastro, etc., and discusses their meaning for the history of art and industry in the Greek world. Cretan civilization has had the following stages: Neolithic, 4500-2800, B. C.; Epoch of Kamares or Mino I, 2800-2200, B. C.; Transitional epoch, Mino II, 2200-1900 B. C.; Apogee of epoch of Kamares, or Mino III, 1900-1500 B. C. Mycenaean epoch, 1500-1200 B. C. Reisch (E.) Ueber die neuen Ausgrabun- gen auf Kreta. (Stzgb. d. Anthr. Ges. in Wien, 1904, 13-20.) Describes the palaces of Knossos, Phaestos, Hagia Triada, and other important recent dis- coveries in ancient Crete. Dr R. thinks that "into the ground covered by the great culture-stratum of the ' Mycenaean' period, Achaean poetry sank the roots from which was developed the flower of the Homeric epic." Rorie (D.) Some superstitions of the Fifeshire fisher-folk. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1904, xv, 95-98.) Topics are "buying wind," tabooed words and names, un- lucky pig, treatment of dead carcasses of animals. The pig is parexcellence the unlucky animal of the Fifeshire coast. While hare is an unlucky word to utter, a hare's leg is sometimes carried in a boat for luck. Ruppin (A.) Inzuchtserscheinungen bei den Karaiten in Halicz. (Pol.-Anthr. R., Berlin, 1903, II, 704-70o6.) From observation of 52 families (190 persons) of this Jewish sect settled in Halicz in Galicia since the 14th century, the author finds evidence (diseases, backward and feeble-minded children, etc.) that close intermarrying has been decidedly injuri- ous. AM. ANTH., N. S., 6--48 Schmidt (H.) Der Bronzesichelfund von Oberthau, Kr. Merseburg. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1904, xxxvI, 416-452, 34 fgs.) Treats of the bronze sickles found at Oberthau in 1902 and now in the Berlin Museum : Form and technique (4 types), origin and distribution (full data given ; type II is western, type III southeast- ern European, type Ia is northern Italian, type Ib belongs to the Swiss lake-dwell- ers); chronology, etc. Many local vari- ations in form occur. Interesting are the marks or makers' tokens on some of these sickles. Seger (H.) Die Denkmailer der Vorzeit im Volksglauben. (Mitt. d. Schles. G. f. Volksk., Breslau, 1904, 1-13.) Treats of folk-belief concerning ancient monu- ments, stone-graves, burial-mounds, walls and fortifications, etc., and the objects found in and about them : Giant- graves, dwarf-houses, buried treasures, changelings, sunken castles, churches and bells, " thunder-stones " and proverbs about them, etc. Siebs (T.) Zur Kunde der deutschen Monatsnamen. (Ibid., 23-32.) De- tailed etymological discussion of the German month-name Hornung (Feb- ruary) and its philological and psychical cognates. Dr S. concludes that the name signifies " dirt (excrement) month," the chief element, hor, being cognate with Gk. auar76, etc. Skutsch (F.) Das Josefsfest zu Rimini. (Ibid., 32-40.) Decribes the St Joseph ceremonies (the scega-vecchia, or masked doll, children's festival), etc., at Rimini. A symbolic destruction of winter and entrance of spring. Stanzel (K.) Volkskundliches aus dem Oelser Kreise, besonders aus Klein- Ellguth. (Ibid., 79-90.) Gives texts of "a true tale" (dialect), a number of "summer-Sunday" and harvest-songs (notes on customs), satiric and other songs of youth, etc. Turner (M. Agatha) Personification of a river. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1904, xv, 99.) Brief note on a washer-woman's talk of the Derbyshire Derwent as if it were a living personage or a deity. Wahner (J.) Zum " Klapperngehen " in der Karwoche. (Mitt. d. Schles. G. f. Volksk., Breslau, 1904, 73-77.) De- scribes the "Klapperngehen," or " rattle walk" of the last three days of Passion week in the Catholic villages of Silesia.</page><page sequence="11">730 AMERICAN ANTHR OPOL OGIST [N..s., 6, 1904 Wherry (Beatrix A.) Wizardry on the Welsh border. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1904, xv, 75-86.) Gives stories of charms, witchcraft, " wise men," ghosts, superstitions, etc., from Monmouthshire, gathered by a young lady who is still at school. Among the topics are tooth- ache-charming, putting spells on people, the witch's daughter, haunted house, " Jack Kent " (a bargain with the Devil story). von Wichdorft (H. H.) Spuren ehe- maliger eisenerzgewinnung und alter Eisenschmelzhiitten im Kreise Naugard i. Pommern. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1904, xxxvII, 237-243, 2 fgs.) Describes remains of iron smelting works, of the Middle Ages, at Priemhaus in Pomerania, and other evidences of a local iron industry. Wiklund (K. B.) Namnet LuleA och de forna nationalitetsf6rhillandena i Norr- botten. (Ymer, Stckhlm., 1904, XXIV, i8o-I86.) Discusses etymology of Lulea and early ethnology of north Bothnia, migrations of Lapps, Finns, etc. Primi- tive Lapp Ltilijjaf signifies "eastern water." Wilser (L.) Nochmals die bemalten Kiesel von Mas-d'Azil. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1904, LXXXV, 319, 2 fgs.) Critique of Piette, Cook, etc. Dr W. attributed these painted pebbles to the Cro-Magnon race, but thinks Piette's idea of their use in a prehistoric school altogether imaginative. Wissowa (G.) Die Anfinge des r6mi- schen Larenkultes. (A. f. Religw., Lpzg., 1904, VII, 42-57.) Argues that the Roman lares had their origin, not in the house, but in the comjitum. Unlike the genius, the lar is attached to the .lace, not the person. The lares began as protectors of the land about the house - Larum sedes in agris (Cicero). Wiinsch (R.) Ein Dankopfer an As- klepios. (Ibid., 95-116.) Discusses the offering to Asklepios by Coan women and the description of the art-works of the temple in the fourth mimiamb of Herondas (recovered some twelve years ago). Coincidences between the As- klepios religion and Christianity, extend- ing even to details of cult and ritual, are noted. AFRICA Bantu totemism. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1904, xv., 203-205.) Notes from a MS. of the late G. W. Stow and com- ments by Lang and Thomas. The ex- tracts cited "show that Mr Lang's theory of the origin of totemism (i. e., group-names given from without were the germs of totemism) has been antic- ipated implicitly by some totemic tribes of South Africa, and explicitly by their civilized observers. Bauer (F.) Bilder aus dem deutschen Tsadsee-Gebiet. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1904, LXXXV, 265-269, 333-337, 13 fgs. ) Contains notes on the natives (Bornu, Haussa-traders, Shuari Arabs, etc.), the towns of Dikoa (buildings), Ngala, Wulgo, Mafate, Gulfei, Kusseri. Myth and fancy flourish in Bornu. The "ancients" of Ngala are said to have been giants, even the women. The mai, or shaman, has great power. Cleve (A.) Zahnverstiimmelungen und ihre Bedeutung flir den Lautwandel. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1904, xxxvI, 456- 460.) Treats of the effects of teeth mutilation on language'among the native of Kinga-land, who knock out the two lower front teeth. Their language lacks f and v altogether and seeks to avoid k and g. Other phonetic peculiarities are cited. - Ueber die Frauensprache. (Ibid., 460-463.) Gives examples of the wo- man's language of the Konde as com- pared with ordinary speech. Some of the words may be of foreign origin, others are periphrases of the usual names of things. Missionary Schiiler thinks these women's languages arise as a natural result from the sex-taboo of certain names (father - in - law, brothers, - numerous where polygamy exists for women). With the Konde the woman's language is not a secret one, and the men even borrow from its vocabulary - a speech- forming tendency is here present. The Wakinga, to whom a woman's language was unknown, are gradually taking up, from contact with the Wakonde, a like custom. Die Dorsalen des Sango. (Ibid., 463-465.) An interesting contribution to primitive phonetics. The change of k to g occurs only in affixes, a softening only in the roots. Prefixes retain k much oftener than roots. The Sango do not practise teeth-mutilation, but their sub- ject-people, the Safua, formerly did so. C. thinks the Sango language betrays the</page><page sequence="12">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 731 effect of such a custom, the phonetic con- sequences only of which have been transferred. Curcan (A.) Essai sur la psychologie des races negres de 1'Afrique tropicale. (R. gen. d. Sci., Paris, 1904, xv, 638-652, 679-693, 24 fgs. ) Treats of senses and appetites, sexual instinct and vices, mo- bility of character, peoples of forest and of plain, egoism and altruism, ideas of truth, loyalty and justice, work and in- dustry, gaiety, intellectual evolution, effects of education, ideas, mysticism and superstition, extent of vocabulary (most complete =5,00ooo words; maximum of ideas = 2, 500 or 3,000), abstraction and generalization, numeration, comparison, judgment, logic, esthetics, music and song, etc. Author concludes that the black race has a unity of mind (dme), the white a diversity. The psychological differences between negroes are small. As a negro the negro is not imperfect- ible. He is a child, a minor, whose education is to be undertaken with firm- ness, gentleness, and patience. Rapid and violent methods are to be condemned. A unilateral education, entirely stimu- lated by another race, the consequence of white conquest, will not save him. F. (B.) Das Ulugurugebirge in Deutsch- Ostafrika. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1904, LXXXV, 274-277, 2 fgs.) Contains a few notes on native agriculture. Fisher ( A. B.) Western Uganda. (Geogr. Journ. Lond., 1904, XXIV, 249-267, 5 fgs.) Contains notes on the Batoro, Bakonjo, Bahima, Balega, Bambuba, the Batwa pygmies, etc. Author sees marks of "deterioration," or "evolu- tion of evil" everywhere. Also proofs of influence of outside civilization. Gentz (Lt.) Die Ovambos, Deutsch-Siid- west-Afrika. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1904, LXXXV, 205-208, 4 fgs.) Author advo- cates forcible subjection and pacification. Political rather than ethnological article. Kandt (R.) Gewerbe in Ruanda. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1904, xxxvI, 329-372, 4 pl., 98 fgs.) Treats of arrow-making, wood-carving, boat-building, weaving and basketry, metal-work, wire-drawing, ceramics, bark-clothing, etc., among the natives of Ruanda in equatorial Africa. The rulers are the Watussi, a non-Bantu people, who have adopted the Bantu speech of their subjects. In Ruanda the markets have favored handwork and injured artistic professions. Pottery is almost entirely in the hands of the Batwa dwarfs, who make also guitars and are likewise executioners to the kings of Ruanda. Klose (H.) Der Mono als Salzstrasse. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1904, LXXXV, 276- 277, I fg.) Describes salt-making by the natives on the river Mono in Togo. von Luschan (F.) Beobachtungen an Kieselmanufakten in Aegypten. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1904, xxxvI, 317-321.) Treats of flints of Thebes and Helonan. Artificial flints occur at Thebes older than the local lacustrine formations. The origin of the Helonan flints needs careful determination. Narbeshuber (R.) Anthropologisches aus Siid-Tunisien. (Mitt. d. Anthr. Ges. in Wien, 1904, XXXIV, 1-18, 93-111, 2 fgs.) Treats of influence of climate (errors of diet dangerous) ; food of Arabs and negroes and its preparation, meal- time; sexual relations of women (men- struation, child-birth, treatment of the enceinte-a birth-stool is in use) ; rem- edies for snake-bite, etc. ; chirurgic and gynecological operations and processes; cerebral and nervous diseases; neuroses without known anatomic bases ; diseases of respiratory and circulatory organs; diseases of digestive canal and its belong- ings, of the kidneys and the bladder; diseases of the organs of locomotion ; con- stitutional, infectious diseases; diseases of the skin; sexual diseases; eye dis- eases (pages 104-1II). A good con- tribution to ethno-medicine. For the Arab food is "hot" (summer) and "cold" (winter). Six children in the family are common, and mothers of 15- 20 are not unknown. Nervous diseases are rare, likewise lung-tuberculosis. Eneuresis nocturna is very rare through early accustoming to the pot de nuit. Eye-diseases are very common. Parsons (H. G.) Royal succession in Yoruba-land. (Folk-Lore, Lond., 1904, xv, 98.) Notes the killing of the King of Ibadan by his subjects on account of age and inefficiency. His heart was eaten by his successor. In Yoruba "to reign" is je-oba, literally "to eat the king." Plehn (A.) Die akuten Infektionskrank- heiten bei den Negern der Aiquatorialen Kilsten Westafrikas. (A. f. Path. Anat. u. Phys., Berlin, 1903, CLXXIV,</page><page sequence="13">732 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 6, 1904 Suppl. I-103.) The results of eight years' experience (15,ooo patients) as physician in the Kameroon country and neighboring regions. Among these negroes tuberculosis, scrofula, rachitis, syphilis, tabes, progressive paralysis, and probably also leprosy and sleeping sickness are unknown. Their resistance is great for wound-infection, gonorrhcea, dysentery, malaria (the last and the first especially) - also yellow fever (practi- cal immunity). To smallpox they are especially susceptible, and the results, unlike those of beri-beri, are often very bad. Rheumatism of the joints is also common, but not severe in results. Dr P. attributes disease-resistance to heredity. This valuable monograph has a bibliography of 347 titles. Ramsay (D.) Nssanakang. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1904, LXXXV, 197-202, 6 fgs.) Brief description of the Nssa- nakang region in German East Africa. Slavery was formerly very prevalent. The salt-makers are women. Schweinforth (G.) Aegyptische Knall peitsche "Fergille." (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1904, xXXVI, 517-519, I fg.) Describes the fergille or whip used toward harvest-time in upper Egypt to scare away the birds by the noise it makes. Similar whips are in use in various parts of central Europe. Seidel (H.) Deutsch-Siidwestafrika im Jahre 1903. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1904, LXXXV, 202-205.) Contains notes on the recent troubles with the natives (Ovambos, Hottentots, Hereros, etc.), economic problems, etc. ------Togo im Jahre 1903. (Ibid., 288-291.) The Catholic missionaries teach the natives English, to which Hr S. stoutly objects. Peace has prevailed with the aborigines. Singer (H.) Kamerun im Jahre, 1902- 1903. (Ibid., 208-209.) The Mo- hammedan part of the Cameroons is more peaceful. In the south the interior tribes press toward the coast. Traeger (P.) Das Handwerkzeug eines tunesischen TAitowierers. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1904, xxxvI, 469-477, 7 fgs.) Describes the tools, modi operandi, pat- terns used, etc., of a Tunisian tattooer. Many of the figures are ancient and tra- ditionally preserved. The cross here found is not of Christian origin or signifi- cance. V. Ujfalvy (K. Freih.) Die Ptolemaer. Ein Beitrag zur historischen Anthropol- ogie. (A. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., 1904, N. F., II, 73-123, 7 pl., 40 fgs.) Treats of the Egyptian Ptolemies, their ances- try and descent (genealogical table, p. 79), etc., psycho-physical type of the Lagidae, from Ptolemy I Soter to Cleo- patra VII. Inbreeding, v. U. concludes, when excessive, changes qualities to de- fects, defects to crimes--psychic and physical degeneration ultimately ensues. Sister-marriages are rather an effect than a cause of degeneration. Webb (R.) A witch-doctor's kit from Magila, East Central Africa. (Folk- Lore, Lond., 1904, xv, 68-74, I pl.) Describes medicine basket and contents (antiseptic materials, theft-powders, "gazelle-bottle," bell-bottle on outside to announce presence, stock bottle, med- icine for barren women, pots for "gun- powder witchcraft," bone-pounders, gourds, etc.), of a Bondei witch-doctor. Of foreign origin are the scarifying knife (broken and rusty European table-knife), the rusty " farthing tin lamp." The cob-sheath of Indian corn is used for wrapping, and gunpowder is an ingre- dient in skin-disease "medicine." de Zeltner (F.) Le monast~re souterrain de Goba. (L' Anthropologie, Paris, I904, xv, 189-194, I fg.) Describes briefly the subterranean monastery of Goba in Abyssinia, still in good preser- vation. Its resemblance to Egyptian monasteries may be due to the influence of the Alexandrian architect employed by King Lalibela, who lived at the end of the I2th century A. D. It also marks the southern limit of Christianity before the arrival of the Europeans. ASIA Abraham (0.) und von Hornbostel (E.) Phonographierte "tiirkische Melodien. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1904, XXXVI, 203- 221.) Technical study, with musical notation of the material of von Luschan (q. v.). These Turkish melodies do not differ from European so much as do, e. g., the Japanese, and some of the resem- blances and coincidences are striking. Blilz (E.) Die sogenannten magischen Spiegel und ihr Gebrauch. (A. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., 1904, N. F. 11, 42- 46.) Criticizes the statements of Jikel, etc., concerning "Japanese magic mir-</page><page sequence="14">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 733 rors." These mirrors, rare in Japan and known to few, have nothing to do with the " menetekel " of the Book of Daniel or the performances in the house of Tezcatlipoca. It is their reflecting of real, not magic, forms that has made them remembered in Japanese folk-lore. Bezold (C.) Babylonisch-Assyrische Re- ligion. (A. f. Religw., Lpzg., 1904, vII, 193-211I.) Critical reviews of liter- ature of 1903 concerning Assyrian-Baby- lonian religion and related subjects; ex- cavations, cuneiform inscriptions, reli- gious, mythological, omen texts, text- books and polemical discussions, popular works, Babel-Bible literature, Ham- murabi, Jewish theological works, Chris- tian works, etc. Brecht-Bergen (R.) Der Altai und sein Gold. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1904, LXXXV, 313-318, 7 fgs., map.) Chiefly geological. "Altai " is said to signify in Chinese and Old Turkish "gold mountains." Traces of mining earlier than Russian occur- and from one kur- gan 6o lbs. of gold articles was taken. De Groot (J. J. M.) Wu Tsung's perse- cution of Buddhism. (A. f. Religw., Lpzg., 1904, vII, 157-168.) Cites doc- umentary evidence concerning the official persecution (by decree of 844) of Budd- hism in China by the Emperor Wu Tsung (840-846 A. D.) of the T'ang dynasty. The terms of the decree are given. Buddhism never recovered from this blow, though the extermination in- tended was only partly effected. The sequestered goods and lands were never restored. Subsequent revivals never re- newed the former glory. Fischer (A.) Mitteilungen fiber die Sel- ungs in Siid-Birma sowie fiber die siid- lichen Shanstaaten. (Stzgb. d. Anthr.

(Folk-Lore., Lond., 1904, xv, 186-192, I pl.) Treats of child-birth, death, nail-paring, moon-ceremonial, indulca (exorcism) of Spanish Jews, evil-eye (the charm is given), charm-necklaces, etc. Miss Freer's paper is followed (192-194) by "Notes " by M. Gaster. Holtzmann (H.) Sakramentliches im Neuen Testamente. (A. f. Religw., Lpzg., 1904, vII, 58-69.) Discusses the sacraments of the New Testament, with reference to recent literature, in relation to early Christian practices, pre- Christian rites, Mithrasism, mysteries, etc. Japans militArische Entwickelung. (Glo- bus, Brnschwg., 1904, LXXXV, 157-161, 6 fgs.) Sketch of military evolution in Japan, based on Dr Joseph Lauterer's Japan, das Land der aufgekenden Sonne, einst undjetzt (Leipzig, 19o4). Karutz (R.) Ethnographische Wandlun- gen in Turkestan. (A. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., 1904, N. F., 11, 194-201.) The Kirgis, losing largely their caravan- activities through the building of the trans-Caspian railroad, flock to the towns; those in eastern Turkestan have been driven into the mountain-valleys as a result of increased cotton-culture and Russian official supervision. The Tur- komans, who possess a certain culture- force of their own, suffer from an increas- ing poverty in the motives of their culture-products, particularly in utensils and ornamentation, carpet-weaving, etc. They are, however, beginning to be at home in agriculture. The city and town population east of the Amu-Darja lose, in like manner, from the influx of Euro- pean products and models. Modifica- tions are very noticeable in dwellings and their construction, furniture, etc. Lart weaving and related industries are influenced more and more by Russian methods. Booths and bazaars are chang- ing also and the streets in which they are. As with primitive peoples the old things are everywhere passing away and swift work of the ethnologist is needed to preserve their remembrance. ten Kate (H.) Noch einmal "Zur Psy- chologie der Japaner." (Globus, Brn- schwg., 1904, LXXXV, 226-227.) Re- ply to critique of Dr Baelz. Dr ten K. disavows any race prejudice, but thinks that the mistakes of European races cannot wash the Japanese white. Lanz-Liebenfels (J.) Anthropozoon bib- licum. (Vrtljhrss. f. Bibelk., Berlin, 1904, II, 307-355.) Author discovers the " missing link," in the man made of earth (as contrasted with the man made in the image of God-the " co-Aryan " ), the anthropozoon, he terms him, of Genesis II, 7. Many strange argu- ments are adduced in support of this curious theory.</page><page sequence="15">734 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 6, 1904 Lehmann (C. F.)

Einige tiirkische Volkslieder aus Nordsyrien und die Bedeutung phonographischer Aufnah- men ftir die V61lkerkunde. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1904, xxxvI, 177-202.) Gives native texts and translations of 22 brief songs from the Turks of northern Syria, with explanatory notes. Material collected in I901 by the author and his wife. Von L. thinks highly of the pos- sibilities of phonographic researches in folk-song. He calls attention to the influence of European and American music upon that of other and more or less primitive races-Japanese, Ha- waiians, peoples of India, etc.-influ- ence easily detected by phonographic records. A great ethnographic museum will have gramophonic apparatus for reproducing for visitors the voices of the peoples whose weapons and implements, ornament and clothing are presented before their eyes. Niehus (H.) Der Maharaja von Durb- hanga und sein Wohnsitz. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1904, LXXXV, 302-3o6, 6 fgs.) Brief account of Singh Bahadur, his temples, palaces, parks, etc. Notes on Tibet. (Nat.

Critical review of select literature of 1903, concerning ancient Hindu reli- gion and mythology, magic, sacrifice, the horse, Buddhism, Jainism, Hinduism. Rivers (W. H. R.) Toda prayer. (Folk- Lore, Lond., 1904, xv, I66-181.) Treats of the formulae used in the daily ritual of the Toda dairy. Native texts and explanations. Dr R. is inclined to think that the Todas once possessed a higher civilization and that their prayer is the result of a process of degradation of their religion. It illustrates one way in which the Indian mantra may arise, - the third formula (besides prayer and magical incantation). R6sler (Hr) Ueber die Aufdeckung einer alten Nekropole in Baku. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1904, XXXVI, 297-293.) Brief account, from the official periodical Kaw- kas, of the discovery (in connection with the excavations near the new Russian cathedral at Baku) of a prehistoric cemetery, a sort of catacombs.

Contains notes on flora and fauna and their uses, natives (almost entirely Bedouins), etc. Here occurs the Tamarix mannifera, the "&lt;manna" of the Bible. Besides the Bedouins there are a few Greek monks, some Egyptian and Turkish officials. Also a small group of people, now Mo- hammedans, but originally Christians, said to be the descendants of Wallachian slaves presented to the monastery of St Katharine by Justinian. Sellin (E.) Ueber die Resultate der Ausgrabungen in Palastina fdr die soge- nannte prThistorische Zeit. (Stzgb. d. Anthr. Ges. in Wien, 19o04, 3-4.) Re- cent investigations into the archeology of Palestine have made it clear that the really prehistoric period ends with about 2oo0 B. C. The immigrant race of 28oo-2500 is anatomically, linguisti- cally, and religiously Semitic. Walker (E. O.) The census of India. (Gent. Mag., Lond., 1904, ccxcvlI, 353- 359.) Contains brief notes (from Cen- sus report) on customs and beliefs of Deshusth Brahmans, Murris, Brahuis, tribes of Indo-Chinese border, Dravi- dians, Nayars, Bhils, etc. Infanticide is said now to be rare. The ethnographic review of the Census report contains valuable data. Wegener (G.) Lhassa. (Globus, Brn- schwg., 1904, LXXXV, 269-274, map.) R6sum6s our knowledge of " the forbid- den city " from the visit of Father Odo- rich von Pordenone in 133o A. D. down to the present.

Zwei Rechtsriten bei den Hebrgern. (A. f. Religw., Lpzg., 1904, VII, 33-41.) Treats of anointment with oil (by the people, by a prophet, etc.), and the " spreading of the wings" (mantle cloak) over any one (Ruth 3, 9), as a symbol of protection. Dr W. notes that the Hebrew word for anoint really signifies " to stroke with the hand " -the oil-idea being later, and perhaps of Egyptian origin. Wright (A. R.) Tibetan charms. (Folk- Lore, Lond., 1904, xv, 95, I pl.) Brief notes on an exorcist's dagger, a charm- box, a metal hand (Hebrew evil-eye charm), and medieval bronze amulet- cases.

After historical introduction, treats of popula- tion, infanticide, diseases, social regula- tions, physical characters, language (the Matty language is grammatically north Melanesian, phonetically Polynesian), mythology, beliefs and customs, houses, food, weapons and implements, dances, etc., among the natives of the Hermit and Matty islands, etc. Malaria, in particular, is discussed at length. In some of the islands in a few years the population has decreased 50 percent. Edwards (C. R.) Governing the Phil- ippine islands. (Nat. Geogr. Mag., Wash., 1904, xv, 273-284, 6 fgs.)

Ges. in Wien, 1904, XXXiV, 112-154, 16 fgs. ) Treats, with abundant bibliographical references, of footstool-like cocoanut scrapers, their distribution (Africa on the east coast from Zanzibar and Sua- heli; Asia, from India, Ceylon, Siam, Malacca; Indonesia, from Sumatra, Java, Nias, Flores, Alor, Timor, Bor- neo, Celebes, Moluccas, Philippines; Micronesia almost everywhere; Poly- nesia, from Ellice Is., Rotuma, Samoa, Society Is. ; Melanesia, from Dutch New Guinea, Matty Is., Hermit Is., N. New Mecklenberg, St Matthias, Solo- mon Is., etc.). It does not occur in the central Melanesian area. The use of the implement is discussed in detail and its varieties pointed out. It was distributed by the Malayo-Polynesians from Asia eastward. There are three groups of this scraper: the board-form, the stool- form, and the spring-board form. Friedmann (M.)

This valuable article treats of the ir or mat- cloths of the Marshall islands, their varieties, ornamentation (chief ones fig- ured), names, etc. Also of tattooing (do), its processes, varieties, names, patterns (chief ones are figured), etc. The native texts and translations of the prayer before tattooing and of 3 tattooing songs are given. Dr K. thinks that the order of the ornaments is of more significance for race-relationship than the interpreta- tion, which must be used with great care. The order in tattooing is no less fixed than in mat-cloths. The arrange- ment of the tattoo-ornaments with the Marshall islanders is different from that with the Caroline islanders. Mathews (R. H.) Die Sprache des Tyed- dynwurru Stammes der Eingebornen von Victoria. (Mitt. d. Anthr. Ges. in Wien, 1.904, XXXIV, 71-76.) Gives for the first time outline of grammar.

N.) Civilization by rein- deer. (So. Wkmn., Hampton, Va., 1904, XXXIII, 209-215, 4 fgs.) Notes on the use of reindeer and the reindeer industry in Siberia and Alaska. It is interesting to find that the Lapps, who were engaged to teach the Eskimo about the reindeer, turned gold-miners when their contract expired. The Siberians at first employed as teachers " proved to be ignorant and unsatisfactory." Batchelder (F. J. ) Settling the Canadian Northwest. (Ibid., 218-122, 5 fgs.) The Mormon colony had settled " in southern Alberta, the only really arid portion of the region "- here they are making the desert bloom. The Russian population now numbers nearly 20,000 and the Galician over 5,ooo. The Ger- mans count 46,888 and the Scandinavians 17,314. A great mingling of peoples is taking place here. Boas (F.) The folk-lore of the Eskimo. (J. Amer. Folk-Lore, Boston, 1904, xvII, 1-3.) R6sum6s data concerning nature and content of tales and legends from all parts of the Eskimo area, particularly the region east of the Mackenzie river, where the most typical forms of culture are to be found. Hero-tales, in which the supernatural plays a more or less important r6le, compose the great mass of Eskimo folk-lore and the most char- acteristic. Another fact is that "the animal myth proper was originally for- eign to Eskimo folk-lore." The "Ifor the benefit of man" ideas is absent from the transformations and creations of Eskimo folk-tales. Many of the animal tales must have been borrowed from the In- dians. A sudden change from love to hatred is a common episode. Tales of shamans are quite numerous. The sex- ual element, as compared with that of Indian tales, is limited, and obscene inci- dents are few. Brandt (Lilian). The negroes of St. Louis. (So. Wkmn., Hampton, Va., 1904, XXXIII, 223-228.) Notes on his- tory, location, social status, employ- ment and occupation, education and philanthropy, etc. The negro here is not being superseded by the white (1890-19o00 whites increased 27 %, negroes 32 % ). The population of negro descent exhibit social and economic grades, as do the white. Clavel (M.) Items of folk-lore from Bahama negroes. (J. Amer. Folk- Lore, Boston, 1904, XVII, 36-38.)

(A. per 1' Antr. e la Etnol., Firenze, 1903, xxxIII, 287-322, I pl., 21 fgs. ) Treats of clothing and ornament, objects of personal use (to- bacco-pouches, bags, pipes, etc.; purses hair-strings, etc.), implements and in- struments for hunting and fishing, food- getting and food-preparing, mortars, water-vessels, honey-liquor and its uses, musical instruments, bows and arrows, clubs and other weapons. The Toba consist of two groups, the Tocouit and the Pilagh or Ai. Ostrich-feathers are made much use of. The Toba pipe is cigar-like in form. The Tobas do not incise their vases for ornamental purposes. They are very fond of honey. Dixon (R. B. ) Some shamans of northern California. (J. Amer. Folk-Lore, Bos- ton, 1904, xviI, 23-27.) Treats of character and procedure of shamans among the Shasta, Hat Creek and Acho- mawi, and Maidu Indians, stocks prac- tically in contact one with another. With the Maidu the position of shaman is hereditary, with the Hat Creek and Achomawi acquired by lone vigil dream- ing, among the Shasta by dreaming. Ideas as to cure and cause of disease differ also. Dorsey (G. A.) Wichita tales. III. (Ibid., 153-I6O.) English text of the story of "The two boys who slew the monsters and became stars." The chief figures are After-birth-Boy and his brother, Double-Faced-Man, and Little-Spider- Woman. A tale of disregarded taboo. Du Bois (Constance G.) Mythology of the Mission Indians.

Three brief songs accompany the story. Ehrenreich (P.) Die Ethnographie Siid- amerikas im Beginn des XX. Jahrhun- derts unter besonderer Beriicksichtigung der Naturv6lker. (A. f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 1904, N. F., III, 39-75.) Treats first of principles of ethnologic di- vision, then gives a systematic review of the most important stocks and families of speech and discusses anthropogeographi- cal facts, culture-relations, etc. E. recog- nizes about 55 distinct stocks, including, of course, several about which very little is known. The oldest traces of man have been found in the Pampas and Patagonia. The Brazilian plateau also is archeo- logically ancient. In the Andean high- lands a great and old attempt to form an adaptive race was in process. Chibcha culture is younger than Peruvian. The Pampas peoples are new compared with the old Querendi-folk. The Amazon and its branches have been of vast im- portance in relation to migrations and tribal contacts. The original home of agriculture was in the great lowlands of the Amazon, Orinoco, etc. E. gives the Chaco region fewer possibilities for the development of culture than justly belong to it. Interesting local cultures (e. g. in the Xingu region) have developed in several parts of the continent. Degen- eration of certain objects (throwing- sticks, bow, shield, etc.) in historical times is noted. Vulcanism has greatly influenced religion and mythology. Hero-myths and animal-stories abound.

Treats of the risings of 1859, 1866, 1868-1871, the state of Ar- aucania, 1862-1873, laws, government activities up to 1887, condition of the country, future problems, etc. Costumbres judiciales i ensefianza de los Araucanos. (Ibid., 203-256, 339-372.) Treats of administrative or- ganization, family (list of relationship terms, etc., 221-224), property and ag- riculture (list of technical terms 233), justice, education among the old Arau- canians and education of these Indians to-day. Besides the family-chiefs and the military chief (in war time) the gulmen or primitive rich man exerted great influence. The dignity of the ca- ciques grew with the Spanish occupa- tion. Domination of the father, polyg- amy, simulated wife-stealing, a family co6perating for material ends rather than united by ties of affection. The primi- tive pastoral (llama) habits of the Arau- canos were increased by the animals introduced by their conquerors. Huerin, the word for "offense, crime," meant rather " damage" - they had a simple lex talionis, "head for head." Modifi- cations due to Spanish influence made the cacique a sort of judge. Chile has done much, both through the early mis- sionaries and the later schools for the Indians. At present there exist at least 80,ooo Araucanians. The children re- ceive a practical education in the coun- try schools, while a number of natives are trained for teachers in the normal schools of Chillan and Valdivia. Hale (E. E.)

The Aztecs of to-day. (So. Wkmn., Hampton, Va., 1904, XXXIII, 528-535, 4 fgs.) Notes on physical characters, dress, religion, foods, medicine, carving, weaving, amusements, etc. They have the Virgin but not Jesus. They still retain their fame as surgeons and " the wonder- ful art of the Aztec sculptors is not yet extinct." Mescal is made for sale, more than home consumption. Aztec great- ness is far from being dead yet. Indian Day-schools. (Ibid., 554-558.) Symposium by R. P. Higheagle, Maggie G. Keith, and J. J.

Brief notes on travels in the country about the Icana and Airary rivers and the In- dian tribes. Dr K. obtained several hundred photographs (including some of the mask-dance of the Kob~ua), 500 ethnologic specimens (masks, pottery, basketry, etc.), and extensive vocabu- laries of several tribes hitherto unknown. Kroeber (A. L.) A ghost-dance in Cali- fornia. (J. Amer. Folk-Lore, Boston, 1904, XVII, 32-35.) Describes a ghost- dance existent about 30 years ago among the Yurok and Karok Indians of the lower Klamath river, who obtained it from the Shasta--these last probably borrowed it from the Paiutes of Nevada. The specialized Karok-Yurok-Hupa cul- ture has given the ghost-dance some peculiarities. Lehmann-Nitsche (R.) Die dunklen Haut- flecke der Neugeborenen bei Indianern und Mulatten. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1904, LXXXV, 297-301, 2 fgs. ) After r6sumeing briefly the literature of the subject, the author adds his own observa- tions from the Argentine (5 little Arau- canian children). In the northern prov- inces (e. g. Catamarca), where mulattos still occur, the " spot" is called "Imancha " or "mancha morada "I (mulberry-colored spot), and is regarded as a sure sign of negro blood. On the Argentine littoral neither the thing nor the name is known. Dr L.-N. thinks the phenomenon can most plausibly be explained as a rudimentary formation. It is now known to occur in the light, the middle-colored, and the dark races. Bibliography of 40 titles. La " mancha morada" de los recien nacidos. (Sem. M6d., Buenos Aires, 1904, repr., pp. 1-23, I fg.) Spanish dress of last preceding title. Lyman (W. D.) Myths and superstitions of the Oregon Indians. (Proc. Amer. Antiq. Soc., Worcester, 1904, N. s., XVI, 221-251.) Treats of myths relat- ing to the supposed superior powers and to the spiritual nature of men, myths of the creation of the Indian tribes and their acquisition of fire and other agen- cies of life, stories accounting for the peculiar and beautiful features of some portions of the country, myths of the hereafter and ideas of joys and punish- ments in another life. The Indians concerned are the Klickatat, Chinook, Yakima, etc. The author seems to con- fuse Chinook jargon names with real Indian ones, e.g., " shoto-lallies" can hardly be the Yakima word for "Ihuckle- berries," nor is "Sahale" the proper name ofa Klickitat divinity. The " con- tinuing storye" is one feature of these myths-"gleeman bouts" of the im- agination are in vogue. Mooney (J.) The Indian navel cord. (J. Amer. Folk-Lore, Boston, 1904, xvII, 197.) Treats of disposal of navel cord among Cherokee, Kiowa, and Cheyenne Indians. With the last the child is thought to be right or left handed from the manner of its grasping the navel-cord package which has been hidden for it to hunt out. Neger (F. W.) Die Insel Mocha. (Glo- bus, Brnschwg., 1904, LXXXV, 228.) Resumes briefly C. Reiche's La isla de la Mocha (Santiago de Chile, 1903). This island off the southern coast of Chile is of some anthropological impor- tance. The three skulls described in detail are said not to be Araucanian, but preconquistorial. Many stone, bone and pottery remains occur. Iron axes and a copper knife indicate European influence. When discovered by Pastene in 1544 Mocha was inhabited by Araucanians. The island at present serves as "the land of souls," or the port thither. Nelson (E. W.) A winter expedition into southwestern Mexico. (Nat. Geogr. Mag., Wash., 1904, xv, 341-356, 14 fgs. ) Contains notes on the Indians of the Lake Chapala region, the Tarascans of Michoacan, the negroes of Acapulco, etc. The region about Mt Tancitaro is the home of the turkey, "1found wild here, domesticated by the Aztecs, and introduced into the Old World by the Spaniards soon after the conquest." In parts of Guerrero the negroes have crowded out the Indians, and the African hut is now one of the featrures of the country. Newell (W. W.) Eighth Memoir of the American Folk-Lore Society. (J. Amer. Folk-Lore, 1904, xvII, 189-I96.) Criti- cal r6sum6 of Dorsey's Traditions of the Skidi Pawnee. Ojeda (T. T.) Memoria historica sobre la familia Alvarez de Toledo en Chile.</page><page sequence="21">740 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 6, 1904 (An Univ., Santiago de Chile, 1903, cxIII, 201-276, 447-526.) A valuable genealogical study, with statistics, filia- tion-list, etc. Osgood (W. H.) Lake Clark, a little known Alaskan lake. (Nat. Geogr. Mag., Wash., 1904, xv, 326-331, 3 fgs.) Contains, p. 329, notes on the natives of Keeghik, "the westernmost representatives of the pure Athapascan stock." Nearly all are of mixed blood, " usually with considerable trace of Rus- sian." Their language is now "as much or more mixed than their blood." Only a few know any English, but " nearly all are proficient in Russian and in modified Aleut, as well as in several Indian lingoes." They appear to have suffered less than some other tribes from the deteriorating influences of the whites. Person (Mary A.) The religion of the negro. (So. Wkmn., Hampton, Va., 1904, XXXIII, 403-404.) Discusses negro Christianity. Roe (W. C.) An oculist among the In- dians. (Ibid., 229-231.) The Indians in Colony, Okl., seem to be particularly susceptible to trachoma - 38 out of 120 cases of boys and girls had beginning trachoma. Of 222 cases of all ages and sexes examined 120 were found to re- quire treatment. Conditions are, how- ever, improving among these Cheyennes and Arapahos. Sapper (K.) Der gegenwirtige Stand der ethnographischen Kenntnis von Mittelamerika. (A. f. Anthr.,Brnschwg., 1903, N. F., III, 1-38, 7 pl., map, 3 fgs. ) Resumes data concerning present extent and distribution of the Indian peoples of Central America (17 stocks totaling 1,582,000 souls), physical characters (chiefly based on Starr), present culture- conditions (food and its preparation, food- plants, food-products, clothing and orna- ment, dwellings and furniture, society, intellectual culture, art, music, poetry, re- ligion, etc. ). Interesting is the Huastec "island " of Chicomucelo in Mayan Chia- pas. As Chibchan, Sapper groups Gua- tuso, Cab6cara, Bribri, T6rraba, Brunca, Dorasque, Rama, Guaymi, Cuna, and the extinct Corobici, Voto, Tariaca, and Quepo. The language of the Salvadoran village of Guatijiagua, hitherto quite unknown, may have Lenca affinities. The admixture of Spanish blood in the Indian population is increasing even in remote regions. Along the Atlantic littoral, from British Honduras to Pan- ama, negro intermixture is occurring more and more. Birth-rate and infant mortality are both high and both varia- ble. Race-smell is also variable. In the interior the resistance against white culture-influence is still strong, and even in the villages and small towns the Indian factor in the institutions, etc., of the mestizo exceeds the white. Naturally native social organization is best pre- served among such independent peoples as the Lacandons and some of the Chib- cha tribes. Spanish influence is in several regions largely modifying Indian speech. Native poetry still survives, chiefly in transitory form, improvisation, etc. (e. g., the grave-eulogies of the Talamancas). S. knows of but a single game (the Kekchi muluc, a sort of dice with corn) of adults that does not show European influence - as do all the chil- dren's games. On the whole the Indian tribes of C. America have suffered most loss in the intellectual and social field, while their material field has sometimes even extended itself into the European. An excellent article. Schmidt (M.) Nachrichten iiber die Kayabi-Indianer. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1904, xxxvI, 466-468, I fg.) Brief r6sum6 of the expedition of Bodstein in 1901. The arrows of the Kayabi are described. - Ableitung siidamerikanischer Ge- flechtmuster aus der Technik des Flecht- ens. (Ibid., 490-512, 40 fgs. ) Author ar- gues that out of the technique of basketry itself motives arise, which by mere vari- ation and combination are further per- fected by the human mind. Also, wher- ever palms grow and their leaves are used for textile purposes an independent point of origin occurs for the textile motif and the ornamentation derived from it. The origin of the basket out of the feathered palm-leaf and the motifs and ornamentation thereby suggested are of great interest. Seler (E.) Archgologische Untersuch- ungen in Costarica. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1904, LXXXV, 233-239, 9 fgs.) Criti- cal r6sume of C. V. Hartman's Archeo- logical Researches in Costa Rica (Stock- holm, 1901). Dr Seler suggests a rap- prochement of some of the Costa Rican animal motifs and certain forms met with in the Chimfi region of Peru.</page><page sequence="22">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERA T&amp;RE 741 Ueber Steinkisten, Tepetlacalli, mit Opferdarstellungen und andere Rhn- liche Monumente. (Z. f. Ethn., Berlin, 1904, xxxvI, 244-290, 54 fgs.) Treats of the stone chests of Riva Palacio, Islas y Bustamente, the Hackmack stone chest in the Hamburg Ethnological Mu- seum, and the Tezcoco chest in the Mu- seo Nacional de Mexico, ornamenta- tion, their mythological significance, etc. Also the Mixcouac stone in the Mexican museum, the Huitzuco stone, and the " 8 reed " stone plate of Orozco y Berra, the last relating probably to the dedication of a temple by the elder Mon- tezuma in 1447. Most of these monu- ments have to do with the sacrifice of blood (one's own in propitiatory fash- ion), and the ashes of the deceased which they were to hold - those of princes and kings. Simms (S. C.) Traditions of the Sarcee Indians. (J. Amer. Folk-Lore, Boston, 1904, xvII, 180-182.) English texts of brief legends of origin of Sarcees, the deluge (with Algonquian diving epi- sode), origin of constellation of the Bear. Speck (F. G.) Some Mohegan-Pequot legends. (Ibid., 183-184.) English texts of three brief stories : Chahnameed, the glutton, wins the eating match; Chahnameed squeezes the stone; Why lovers should never become jealous. Thompson (A. H.) Ethnographic odon- tology; the Inca Peruvians. (Dent. Di- gest, Chicago, 1903, repr., 28 pp., 12 fgs.) Treats of the teeth in general and in detail. Investigations based on ex- tensive and minute notes on some 500 Pe- ruvian skulls in U. S. museums. Defect and disease of the teeth among these Indians are such as one might expect from a civilized people who ate maize and chewed coca. The finer type of Quichua and the coarser Aymara differ in several respects. Tooker (W. W.) Algonquian names of some mountains and hills. (J. Amer. Folk-Lore, Boston, 1904, XVII, 17I- 179.) Treats etymologies of Monad- nock, Katahdin, Weequadnock, Wee- puting, Massanutton, Shot-nigher, Mu- chattoes, Manhattan, Massachusetts, Wachusett, Wachogue, Watchung, Mauch Chunk, Kearsarge, Taconic, Woonsocket, Neutakonkanut, etc. Mr Tooker's authority ought to drive out of the newspapers and periodicals some of the absurd etymologies (e. g. for Kear- sarge) that still appear in them. Washington (B. T.) The value of edu- cating the Negro. (So. Wkmn., Hamp- ton, Va., 1904, XXXIII, 558-564.) Author argues that " at every point at which the Negro has touched the white man, the Negro has had the wisdom to get something that has made him a stronger and more useful citizen." Wren (C.) The stone age. Remains of the stone age in the Wyoming valley and along the Susquehanna river. (Proc. &amp; Coll. Wyoming Hist. &amp; Geol. Soc., 1902-3, Wilkes-Barr6, [1904], 93-114, 3 pl.) General remarks on the stone age in America, etc., with brief account of collection of specimens in the Society's museum. The author's collection con- sists of some 5,3oo pieces, probably, as a rule, of Algonquian origin. The " notched disks," whose use is conject- ural, number more than 50.</page></plain_text>
