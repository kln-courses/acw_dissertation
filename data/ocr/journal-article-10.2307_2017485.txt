SYMPOSIUM IN HONOR OF WILLIAM JAMES The Psychology of William James as a Basis for his Philosophy. G. S. BRETT. A survey of the development of James's thought suggests that the Principles of Psychology and other collateral writings form the basis for the general structure of his philosophy. This can be made evident by consideration of selected topics which are discussed in those works and subsequently play an important part as character- istics of the more mature teaching. Such themes as the principle of activity, the status of relations, the meaning of consciousness, the psychic experience, are to be emphasized in the context. While some parts of the work done in the field of psychology persist as factors in the epistemology of James and in such metaphysics as he could consistently develop, there are others which point more di- rectly toward the practical philosophy and the views which James expressed on the meaning of life and the value of action. The psychological doctrines are described under the two divisions of cognition and volition in order to form an introduction to the theoretical and practical aspects of the philosophy. William James and the Facts of Knowledge. DONALD C. WILLIAMS. The years which have added to James's stature have not re- vealed a systematic coherence in his philosophy, but they show forth, writ large in a generation which he so much influenced, its war- ring components. In his critical theory of knowledge, his enthusi- asm for the enthusiast and for the rebel made him a great prophet of the voluntaristic schwdrmerei, the positivistic recusancy, and the pragmatic compound of the two, which grew so strong in the philosophy of the recent past. At the same time, his unequalled sensitivity to the present fact, his genius for acute analysis and for metaphysical and cosmological invention, faced him in the di- 673</page><page sequence="2">674 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY rection of a very different and more knowledgeable dispensation, an empirical realism for which he not only developed the concep- tual instruments but proposed some of the cardinal hypotheses. Even in the latter and gnostic mood, however, when convinced that conscious presentations are parts of a reality as independent as it is inescapable, and that the philosopher ought to decide which parts they are, James could not decide, but vacillated between a panpsychistic representationism and a neutral objectivism. These alternatives, and his evidences for them, still deserve careful ex- amination. If, finally, however, so stark a classification by "isms" seems repugnant to James's own temper, this must be because, in a valiant life-long endeavor to amalgamate the two elements of the good life, to love and to think, he, like so many of his admirers, never quite learned to exercise both faculties on the same object at the same time. William Janes as a Moralist. HERBERT W. SCHNEIDER. William James's moral idealism was distinct from and comple- mentary to his empirical analysis of mind. His individualism was Kantian, closer to Carlyle than to Mill. As he inclined increas- ingly to a belief in radical continuity in consciousness, so he in- clined increasingly to a radical discontinuity in action. William James was his father's son, a champion of "individual manliness. " Though he claimed not to understand his father 's philosophy, he reasserted it in his own. Basic to both is the contrast between ethics and religion, moralism and spontaneity, law and love, thought and life. He came to this basic distinction during his physical and intellectual crisis-a crisis identical with John Stuart Mill 's-when he realized the inadequacy of his scientific enthusiasm for a philosophy of action. Apparently his philosophy of action began with an appreciation of Goethe. Then followed his discovery of the importance of spontaneous variation for Darwinism. He came to embrace indi- vidualistic idealism through Renouvier, Green, Royce, Sigwart, Spir, and Peirce. The system of ethics which emerged from his course in 1888 and found expression in his essay, The Moral Phi- losopher and the Moral Life (1891), was decidedly idealistic and pluralistic-Kantian, anti-Hegelian, anti-utilitarian. No science of ethics or "canon of ends" is possible. He suggested but failed to take seriously the implications of his ethics of "demands" or "claims" (individual categorical imperatives) for a theism (like Howison's) or for a social ethics (like Dewey's). His chief in- terest remained to defend the claims of individuals against God,</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 675 against Society, and against science ("romantic gnosticism") in spite of the "strenuous" character and "tragic" consequences of this Promethean and heroic ideal. He was a radical antinomian, like his father, but he preached his faith with more grace and de- fended it with more science. SYMPOSIUM ON "THE RELATION OF SIGN TO OBJECT SIGNIFIED" The Logic of Semantics. PAUL WEISS. The relation of sign to object is a relation of inference, the con- verse of a prior and presupposed inference from object to sign. Operational Analysis as an Instrument for the Critiqute of Linguistic Signs. ERNEST NAGEL. Two contrasting positions are frequently taken with respect to many expressions in daily speech and in the formulations of the sciences: that they are meaningless fictions, or that they refer to some realm not accessible to the overt procedures of empirical re- search. However, these alternatives are not exhaustive, even with respect to those signs which do not signify empirically identifiable things or relations in the natural subject-matter of the sciences; and if the full range of operations relevant to the use of such signs is noted, they can be exhibited as signifying identifiable traits of inquiry. It thus appears that there is no general problem of ob- jective reference, though there are many special problems relevant to discovering the tacit rules in accordance with which signs are used. The general thesis that the consideration of the activities of sign-users provides a fruitful ground for the critique of abstrac- tions, is illustrated by an examination of a class of expressions em- ployed in the natural sciences, the class of expressions which are used in assigning certain numerical values to the magnitudes of physical properties. Thus, statements containing such phrases as "the instantaneous velocity of Mars" or "a distance whose length is the square-root of two feet," do not appear to denote empirically identifiable traits of physical subject-matter. On the other hand, just as isolated statements in the sciences can not be put to a crucial test, although an inclusive system of statements in which they are contained can be so tested, so isolated signs may not denote traits of subject-matter, although the system of signs in which they are elements may do so. In fact, an examination of the way the above apparently non-referential expressions are used, suggests that they serve to integrate various parts of an inclusive inquiry; the specific "objects" which they signify are thus certain modes of conducting inquiry.</page><page sequence="4">676 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY The Problem of Semantics. A. P. USHENKO. The position of semantics is that meaning is a relation between the symbol and the referent. But when the referent is distant in space or time, it is not directly given so that it can be related to the symbol. Therefore symbolic reference to an absent object is the main difficulty of semantics. The difficulty is reduced if symbolic reference can be interpreted as a rule of inference which leads from the symbol-premise to the referent-conclusion, because in deduction the premise and the rule of inference can be given before the der- ivation of the conclusion. If, on the other hand, one admits that prior to the derivation of the conclusion symbolic reference is in- complete, one might prefer to side with A. J. Ayer, who argues that meaning is not a relation at all, but a rule for the use of the symbol. Ayer's view is found to be untenable, because he can not formulate the required rule without introducing into it symbolic reference, i.e., because his view involves a vicious circle. The fore- going examination of the semantic difficulty shows that there is no solution so long as symbols or concepts are taken to be exclusively means of description within discourse and therefore having no contact with the referents which are outside discourse. The solu- tion of the problem begins with a division of symbols, words, or concepts into two kinds: the means of description such as the word "blue," and the objectives for reference such as the word "thing." The objectives for reference play the part of the absent referents in discourse. Hence meaning, although not directly a relation be- tween the symbol and the referent in the original, is a relation be- tween the symbol and the referent as represented by an objective for reference. Toward Agreement in Ethics. CHARLES A. BAYLIS. Sharper delineation of certain ethical concepts will help toward agreement. Precise definitions are offered of derivative value, with its three subclasses of instrumental, contributive, and resultant value, and of basic value, with its two sub-types, simple and emer- gent basic value. The concept of basic value is presented as more sharply defined and as more useful than the notion of intrinsic value. Instrumental value is distinguished from normal instru- mental value which is the value an entity of a given kind would have were its consequences the usual consequences of entities of this kind. The essence of formalistic ethics can perhaps be expressed as follows: Acts of certain kinds possess so much positive non-instru-</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 677 mental value, basic, resultant, or contributive, that no matter what the circumstances and therefore no matter what the consequences, the total value of any act of the kind specified will be at least as great as that of any alternative, and hence all acts of this kind are right; on the other hand, acts of certain types possess so much negative non-instrumental value that no matter what the circum- stances there will always be some alternative to an act of the kind specified which would be better and hence all acts of this kind are wrong. As so formulated a well-grounded decision is possible be- tween formalism and teleology. With a precise understanding of the nature of basic value, in- creasing agreement in answers to the question, "What entities pos- sess basic value?" may be expected. A method of elimination is suggested for reaching decisions in such inquiries. Human Equality. GEORGE MORGAN, JR. An examination of equalitarian movements in history, and of representative arguments for human equality, both axiological and pragmatic, leads to the following conclusions. Aside from "equal- ity of consideration" and an elusive feeling of the sacredness of human life, there are no universally valid forms of equality among men. Rather there are a variety of considerations favoring both equality and inequality in their several forms and according to season and circumstance. Any positive sense of values, i.e., one which is not ultimately nihilistic, must entail both equality and in- equality, since they are obverse and reverse sides of any act of evaluation: some differences are thrown into relief, others dismissed as irrelevant or unimportant. The proper interpretation of a de- mand for some specific form of equality is that certain differences between men are irrelevant in that context. The chief abuses of equalitarianism rest upon false judgments of irrelevance which lead it to champion mediocrity against excellence. The most beneficent equalizing powers in human experience do not set up equality as an ideal but further it as a by-product of a sense of comradeship and communion. Such are the best of our own democratic tradi- tions. On the Historical Understanding of Kierkegaard. KARL L6WITH. The proper historical setting is to be shown where Kierkegaard's main concept of the "single individual," his criticism of existing Christendom provoked by it, and the corresponding notion of para- doxical belief come to stand. As pupil and opponent of Hegel, Kierkegaard is closely connected with the radical criticism of the</page><page sequence="6">678 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Young-Hegelians, particularly with Feuerbach and Marx. His "Either-Or" with regard to Christianity is at the same time de- termined by the social political movement as represented by his antipode Marx. The criticism in Das Eine was not tut (1848) is Kierkegaard 's answer to Marx 's communistic manifesto (1847), and his expectation of a restoration of genuine Christianity is the reverse of Marx's propaganda for a world revolution. Both, how- ever, agree that the world of the nineteenth century is in full dis- solution. To Marx the bourgeois society is one of isolated individ- uals and thereby deprived of the generic essence of man; to Kierke- gaard Christendom is a widely spread institution where nobody is a personal follower of Christ. Insisting on a decision as such- either in favor of or against Christianity-Kierkegaard could sympathize with Feuerbach who knew at least what Christianity is, though rejecting it; but at the same time defending it against its confusion with philosophy, humanity, and social progress. Both objected to Hegel 's mediation of the divine and the human, of Christianity and paganism on the summit of metaphysics. Despite this common opposition, however, Kierkegaard's as well as Feuer- bach's concept of subjective belief is determined by Hegel's polemics against every "positivity" as a merely external objectivity. From Hegel's sentence that God is essentially only "in thought" because the comprehended spirit is the same as the comprehending one, it is only a single step to Feuerbach's anthropological thesis that all modifications of the divine being are projections of the human being, and to Kierkegaard's existential thesis that God is only in and for the subjectivity of a proper God-relationship. Starting from Luther's thesis that God is essentially existing "for me," Hegel, Feuerbach, and Kierkegaard emphasize man 's self-appro- priation of the divine, endangering thus the superhuman claim of religion. The Crisis of Contemporary Philosophy. ERICH FRANK. Philosophical thinking, which after the collapse of the specula- tive systems had found security in positivism, is once more facing a crisis. To fall back on the old patterns of metaphysics has proved unsatisfactory. A new principle must be sought through which the eternal question of philosophy can be answered in a way ade- quate to the man of today and to his particular situation. Traditional metaphysics and science, even the positivistic theory, are still determined by that concept of nature which formed the foundation of Greek philosophy. True being is seen here in the</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 679 universal, in the essence of things. Science too strives to find the universal law, that which recurs in every individual phenomenon. For the modern, however, the individual ranks higher than the universal. The uniqueness of existence becomes the decisive prob- lem, as important as that of essence. Kierkegaard and the existen- tial philosophers, in resuming certain ideas of Schelling, have made the principle of existence the main issue of philosophical discus- sion. But by assuming individual existence as an absolute prin- ciple they have fallen into a subjectivism which is inadequate to the true character of reality. In the limitation of his existence which is determined by the inevitability of guilt, death, physical and spiritual struggle, man encounters a truth which transcends his subjectivity. The prin- ciple of human existence must be understood, therefore, as the spectrum into which has been broken the light of objective being. The External World and Induction. EVERETT J. NELSON. Because experience does not reveal connections between data sufficient to validate induction, the validity of induction presup- poses an external world grounding data. And because of this presupposition, the existence of such a world can not be inferred inductively. Since the Principle of Indifference is synthetic, re- sort to it in order to get an antecedent probability for the hypothe- sis that an external world exists must be rejected until an acceptable rationalism is established. The positivistic position that a prin- ciple of induction is a maxim of procedure, and so is neither true nor false, is a sheer evasion, because the applicability of the rule, and our faith in its success, presuppose the proposition that data are so ordered that the observed may be taken as signs of the unobserved. The rejection of the inductive argument for an external world does not deny its existence but simply one way of knowing it. It is not incompatible with realism but only with a realism assimi- lating metaphysics to science, and so giving up the possibility of validating empirical knowledge. Further, it is not favorable to positivism but rather a call for a genuine metaphysics in order to provide a ground for our belief in science. The problem of the nature of the external world involves the traditional problems of philosophy, e.g., of pluralism versus monism and of the nature of law. Though these problems await solution, we do know that the realms of physical and of scientific objects, as described by science, do not satisfy the metaphysical requirements for an external world adequate to validate knowledge, because, for example, they embody only external relations.</page><page sequence="8">680 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY The Status of Emergence. PAUL HENLE. The argument of the paper may be summarized as follows: (1) That emergence as discussed in emergent evolution pertains primarily to qualities of things, not things themselves. (2) That unpredictability has generally been taken as the criterion of emer- gent qualities. (3) That, with a few exceptions which do not effect the argument, no quality is predictable on the basis of any group of qualities alone, but only on the basis of a group of qualities and some hypothesis. (4) That in general the original group of quali- ties does not determine uniquely the hypothesis which explains them. On the basis of one explanatory hypothesis and a given group of characteristics, another quality may be predictable; on the basis of another equally satisfactory explanatory hypothesis and the same group of characteristics, the occurrence of the quality may not be predictable. (5) The solution would appear to lie in con- sidering only predictability relative to the simplest hypothesis. (6) But, simplicity of hypotheses seems to be subjective. (7) Hence, the criterion of emergence is subjective and no metaphysical status can be accorded to emergence. Modal Propositions and Truth Tables. HENRY S. LEONARD. The classical view of logic is that it deals with propositions by dealing with their forms. This view is adopted, without defense, and applied to the study of modalities. But four misconceptions or elements of vagueness in the classical view are first cleared up: (1) The logical properties of propositions are distinct from, but de- fined in terms of, the logical properties of the forms those proposi- tions possess. (2) The possessive relation between propositions and forms is a many-many relation rather than a many-one relation. (3) Most developments in symbolic logic are concerned exclusively with determining the logical properties (analytic, contradictory, or indeterminant) that belong to certain identified forms. (4) The deductive organization common in symbolic logic may be replaced by any other organization that as efficiently determines this identi- fication of properties belonging to forms. This paper replaces it by a method of truth tables for the forms of modal propositions. After explaining the method of truth tables in its classical ap- plication to non-modal forms, the question is raised, how can it be applied to modal forms? Three methods of application, progres- sively more complex, are described, and the ranges of applicability of these methods are fixed. The first two methods require no more than the two original truth values, truth and falsity; but the third method involves the subdivision of these two values into the cases</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 681 of their necessary and their contingent occurrence. The first method consists in simply erasing the modal sign from the repre- sentation of the form and testing the resultant non-modal form. It applies to every accidentally modal form, i.e., to every form in which the modal sign occurs solely in a prefix to a non-modal form. The second method introduces columns of values to represent modal expressions, but uses only two truth values. It is reliable whenever it shows a form analytic or contradictory, but in some other cases, it fails. The third method, involving the use of four truth values, suffices to treat all cases not amenable to treatment by the preceding methods. Pleasutre Theory in Ethics and Esthetics. Lucius GARVIN. This paper deals with some of the implications of a hedonistic general theory of value in the fields of ethics and esthetics. It is argued that hedonistic assumptions together with conventional lin- guistic usage imply (1) that there is a fundamental difference in the manner in which basic ethical and esthetic predicates attach to objects and (2) that ethics occupies a central and special place as a value science, quite other than that occupied by esthetics. The general premise of hedonism is given a non-naturalistic, non-subjective, and non-relative interpretation. Rightness is de- fined as attaching to objects objectively, though it is "socially sub- jective" and relational. Ultimate moral standards are held to be universal in applicability, and to possess the force of categorical imperatives. Esthetic predicates, on the other hand, are described as subjective and relative, and the laws of esthetic value are re- garded as hypothetical and without any absolute compelling power. Attempts to formulate definitions of beauty which will be consistent with the basic hedonistic premise and at the same time treat beauty as objective, are rejected on the ground of the ultimacy of individ- ual esthetic preferences. Though the artist and the esthetic con- templator are thus shown to possess a freedom qualified, on the esthetic side, in no other way than by their own esthetic disposi- tions, they are nevertheless not removed from the constraint of moral principles, which, in the sense in which they are interpreted by the hedonist, may exercise a compelling force even in the region of esthetic values. The Symbolic Meaning of Esthetic Terms. MAX RIESER. Esthetic experience does not arise on the same level of awareness as do the sensations of cold, soft, sour, or sweet; it is not of per- ceptual but of intellectual origin, mediated by thought processes.</page><page sequence="10">682 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Not sensuous elements as such are enjoyed (e.g., colors, shapes), but contexts of meanings. Esthetic response involves an act of interpretation, not the form itself; but what the form is supposed to represent is what is liked or disliked, which likings do not de- pend on forms but on general concepts of life. Thus a material form is not indispensable as a source of esthetic response; even an immaterial idea will suffice. When investigating the esthetic "meanings" we shall see a disparity between the ethical and the esthetic scales of valuation which do not coincide, the discrepancy being due to the fact that the esthetic scale is more archaic than the moral one. Forms have meaning, they speak their own archaic language, whose meaning is superadded to the realistic meaning of rational speech. The archaic language of forms is the specific language of art; it may create the illusion of artistic wisdom or depth. Its "phrases" are not logical but "telluric"; they never- theless carry significance which can be grasped by man. Even the elements of order to be found in art are in their specificity terms of a language. This is also true of "symmetry" or "asym- metry," "harmoniousness " or "disharmony." Their esthetic significance is not due to their being a form, but to their being meaningful terms of the esthetic language. Any analysis of es- thetic appreciation proves that we value not shapes but ideas rep- resented by them. In the act of "esthesis" we grasp the symbolic function of a thing, whether or not its form is a symbol of a de- sirable content. The emotional attitudes towards the good and the beautiful are basically different. The Neo-Catholic Theory of the Artist's Creative Process. KATHA- RINE E. GILBERT. The NTeo-Catholic theory of the artist's creative process brings together two contrasted conceptions of art: craft, in the sense of useful work, and divine inspiration. How they can be reconciled appears from a development of their respective meanings. Four points apply to craft: (a) its practical extraversion; (b) involve- ment of a discipline not mechanical in its principles of order; (c) exclusion of imitation and friendliness to varied, and even fantastic, invention; (d) and emulation of the Divine Architect of the World. Four points apply to divine inspiration: (a) collection of impres- sions; (b) recoil from contact with phenomena to the interior silence; (e) hoarding of gathered experience in the memory and mulling in the fancy; (d) activity of making works of art through the fertilization of the germinating interior mass by the Creative Influx. The Architect of the World, which is the ultimate model</page><page sequence="11">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 683 for a craftsman, coincides with the Creative Influx which fertilizes the poet's imagination. Criticism is directed toward the vagueness and ambiguities in the final concept on which the whole structure rests. Being in pure act is now omnimodal potency and now an anthropomorphic moral being. Descartes and the Genesis of the Concept of Physical Law. EDGAR ZILSEL. In his Discours de la Methode Descartes proclaims the discovery of "laws which God has put into nature." These laws are given in his Principia Phitlosophiae. They are the laws of inertia and of conservation of momentum and seven "laws" or "rules" of impact that, however, are partly incorrect. All of these are laws of mechanics, assert quantitative relations, and are interpreted theo- logically. The modern term "physical law" emerges in these passages for the first time. The idea that God gives commandments to the sea and the winds appears in a few verses of the Old Testament. From them St. Augustine developed his concept of God's "eternal law" which is synonymous with divine providence. Similar ideas are to be found in the Stoics. All of these ideas, however, are of a teleological character; they never point out specific recurrent asso- ciations of natural events and, of course, do not refer to processes in a laboratory. Ancient science too was little interested in regular connections between physical processes. Only three physical laws were correctly known to antiquity (the principles of the lever and of Archimedes and the optical law of reflection), but were never called "laws." In the modern era quantitative mechanical regu- larities were first studied by the engineers of the Renaissance. They appear in scientific form in Galileo and Stevin but were never called "laws" by them. Thus Descartes is the first author com- bining investigation of quantitative regularities with the law-meta- phor and theological interpretation. From him the concept was adopted on the one hand by Spinoza, on the other by Huyghens and the physicists of the Royal Society (Wallis, Wren, Hooke, Boyle, Newton). Descartes' law-concept in particular and the concept of physical law in general were the results of a combination of the ideas of rising, modern technology and scientific mechanics with the religious tradition. They presuppose the modern state with central sov- ereignty and rational statute law.</page><page sequence="12">684 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Berkeley's Conceptualism. SYDNEY C. ROME. By considering critically the epistemological situations in which Berkeley claims knowledge by way of "notions" to operate, I show that in Berkeley's early works notional knowledge is dominated by seven leading characteristics. The first two merely summarize Berkeley's actual statements: (1) Spirits are not known by means of ideas. (2) Nevertheless spirits are in some sense known. This non-ideational knowledge Berkeley calls notional. From the fact that spirits are totally independent existences, it follows that (3) notional knowledge is immanent yet external. Because Berkeley's arguments against representative knowledge apply equally to no- tional knowledge as well as to ideational knowledge, (4) notional knowledge is direct and empty. Unmediated by any interposed natures, notional knowledge takes the object known as identically the subject of all knowledge about it. From this direct realism I conclude that (5) some words such as mind and spirit stand for real objects such as "minds" and "spirits." This completely re- verses Locke's semeiotic that words signify only ideas. From the facts that notional knowledge is direct (not mediated by interposi- tion), immanent, and external to the objects known, it follows that (6) a "notion" is an epistemological act. Since in knowing a spirit the full nature of a spirit certainly can not be known, it is clear that (7) notions abstract. That Berkeley actually advances this seventh thesis in the Principles I show in detail. At the same time I demonstrate that notional abstraction can be held to occur and yet the existence of abstract ideas be denied. These seven theses concerning notional knowledge imply a ten- sion which the Sirns finally resolved when in it ideas ceased to be homogeneously simple thought-objects to become complex non-cog- nitive objects of thought. A second historical consequence is that Berkeley's employment of notions also was used to establish com- mon sense realism in both epistemology and metaphysics. Dewey on Materialism. RoY WOOD SELLARS. There is a strong trend toward naturalism in secular philosophy but naturalism itself is seldom defined with any precision. To one group it merely means the rejection of religious supernaturalism; to another, a fervid acceptance of science and scientific method; to still another, empiricism and the meaninglessness of metaphysical statements when tested in terms of sensory observations. To me, at least, such a situation is unsatisfactory. Naturalism demands an ontology in order to be positively grounded.</page><page sequence="13">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 685 Now all through history the ontology associated with naturalism has been materialism. That was the case in the Ancient World and, as Hook has pointed out, during the Middle Ages, materialism was correlated with the rejection of theism and final causes. Unfortunately, materialism has been in disrepute among his- torians of philosophy, the greater number of whom have been idealists. Any sophisticated form of materialism was given another name, such as hylozoism, while the qualifications introduced were usually ignored. In his essay in the recent Dewey volume Savery has brought this point out very clearly. He has called attention to the recent growth of critical and emergent forms of materialism. At present there are two rather clannish groups of philosophers who regard themselves as naturalistic in their outlook, the prag- matists and the positivists. In many regards Dewey can be re- garded as typical of both. It should be of interest, therefore, to examine his replies to the very pertinent questions asked of him by Savery. It would seem that his primary objection to materialism is that it presupposes the validity of the category of substance. It is my opinion that he is right in this assumption but wrong in his rejection of the category of substance. There are enduring organic selves and things with powers and potentialities. What is needed is a proper handling of those traditional problems, a cor- respondence theory of truth, the basis for our belief in an external world, the relation of mind and body, a rational theory of emergence in terms of emergent causality. It is very unfortunate that Dewey has allowed himself to side-track these basal problems by encourag- ing himself to believe that they are pseudo-problems. They are not. Realism makes possible a critical materialism of an evolutionary sort able to offer a positive ontology to naturalism. SYMPosIUM: THE PIuILOSOPHICAL PRESUPPOSITIONS OF DEMOCRACY The Philosophical Presuppositioas of Democracy. SIDNEY HOOK. Since all the key terms of the symposium title are ambiguous, in order to facilitate the joining of issues I propose to ask and answer three generic questions. The first is: What is democracy? This is approached primarily as a task of definition rather than of histor- ical analysis. The second is: What are the grounds we can legiti- mately offer for our belief in the desirability of democracy? The third is: Are there any facts of a cosmic, historical, socio-economic, or psychological kind which stand in the way of our acceptance of democracy, i.e., which make democracy an impracticable ideal?</page><page sequence="14">686 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY (1) Two senses of democracy are distinguished-political and ethical. It is shown that the second is primary in that it serves as the criterion of judging the degree to which any given set of polit- ically democratic institutions functions democratically. The prin- ciple of ethical democracy is a prescription to treat human beings equally as persons where "equality" refers not to status but to op- portunity, not to origin but to relevant functions. This principle of equality is distinguished from other conceptions of equality. (2) The main problem is to justify our belief in democracy as defined. Four types of justification are considered. (a) Belief in the validity of democracy is logically dependent on the truth of certain theological propositions. (b) The validity of democracy presupposes or is presupposed by certain metaphysical propositions where "metaphysics" designates a theory or reality or an ontology. (c) Belief in democracy is a non-rational preference rooted in man's physical nature and conditioned by his social environment. (d) Belief in democracy is belief in the hypothesis that the modes of action, described in the previous section, will more adequately than any other known alternative bring to fruition in human life certain value patterns whose nature is briefly indicated. Reasons are offered for rejecting the first three types of justification and ac- cepting a variant of the fourth. It is shown that this position is immune to the customary charges of question-begging and irrel- evance. (3) The third question concerning the feasibility of democracy is considered in the light of the impressive arguments and evidence adduced in the writings of Mosea, Pareto, and Michels. Reasons are advanced for rejecting their chief contentions, and in behalf of the conclusion that democracy is both desirable and possible. The Philosophical Presuppositions of Democracy. GLENN R. MORROW. Democracy presupposes that man is a rational being, i.e., able to govern his conduct by principles formulated in common with his fellowmen and accepted as sovereign over his private interests. For democracy proposes to determine public policy by public dis- cussion, to which all persons in the community shall have access; and if this method leads to genuine solutions of social conflicts (as is assumed by democracy) it is because joint inquiry reveals prin- ciples, not merely common interests, and principles that have au- thority, not merely force, behind them. The pronounced irratiolnalism of recent thought has weakened this premise of democracy. Is the conception of man as a rational</page><page sequence="15">AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 687 being really tenable today? Yes. We can hardly justify the ex- cessive claims made for Reason by the classical rationalism, but history affords abundant evidence of the working of the practical reason, as above defined. The Philosophical Presuppositions of Democracy Necessary for the Solution of Social Problems. F. S. C. NORTHROP. Democracy's future depends upon its capacity to solve our social problems. These are of two kinds: problems of fact and problems of value. Solutions of the former we term factual social theories; of the latter normative social theories. Democracy is a normative social theory. A factual social theory is one resulting from the application of the method of natural science to social phenomena. This method prescribes complete accordance with the facts for any correct fac- tual theory. A normative social theory is one which differs in whole or part for a given society from what a correct factual social theory for that society would designate. Consequently, the scientific method for determining correct normative social theory can not be that of natural science applied to social phenomena. When this is overlooked the culturalistic fallacy occurs. It consists in applying to normative social theory a scientific method appropriate only for factual social theory. A paradox arises. The truth of normative social theory,-its propositions being synthetic, requires an empirical criterion; yet correspondence with social phenomena commits the culturalistic fallacy. To state this paradox is to find an escape: normative social theory requires an appeal to empirical facts; they can not be those of social phenomena; hence, they must be those of nature. What do we mean by nature? Analysis of the methods and verified theory of natural science exhibits two factors: (1) the data of sense and (2) a deductively formulated postulated component. The former we term nature in its esthetic aspect; the latter nature in its theoretical aspect. Hence, that normative social theory is the correct one which proceeds from the philosophically articulate conception of nature in its esthetic and theoretical aspects which is designated in the experimentally verified, postulated theories of natural science. The capacity of such theory to solve social problems is indicated.</page></plain_text>
