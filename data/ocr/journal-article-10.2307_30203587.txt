<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARDE EL MAR: REFORMULATING THE ROMANTIC SYMBOL, A PROJECT IN THE PRESENT PROGRESSIVE JORDI Gracia, in his introduction to the Spanish edition of Arde el Mar, draws several connections between the Romantic literary tradition and Pere Gimfe- rrer's poetics. He lauds Gimferrer's faculty for breaking "el envaramiento con una genuina ironia romintica," contrasting his surrealistic imagery with his "ret6rica romintica," and citing the article which appeared in Destino upon Gimferrer's reception of the Premio Nacional de Poesia, which comments, "se halla en la linea de un evocador neorromanticismo" (Arde el Mar, 47-9). Gim- ferrer, always his own commentator and critic, corroborates in Oda a Venecia ante el mar de los teatros, "Lloraba yo, acodado al balc6n / como en un mal poema romintico," both remembering his youth and referring to the actual writing of the poem (AEM, 109). Yet Gimferrer's work is no recapitulation of Romantic poetics; I would argue, in fact, that it is a complete reformulation of them. The Romantic poets are remembered largely for their revelation of "the symbol," a concept defined as the poetic synthesis of "the universal" and "the particular" in which neither term signifies the other but in which both are ab- solutely one. The symbol is the perfect unity of concrete things such as bal- conies or horses with what the Romantics believed to be the metaphysical or- dering of the universe. In light of this understanding of poetic meaning as self- revealed, explication was equated with meaninglessness. Friedrich Schelling, a member of the early Jena Romantic school, claimed that the modern 6poque began with reflection, that is, with the process of distancing oneself from im- mediate experience, the shattering of the organic unity of experience, and the obscuring of our comprehension of it. Modern man, Schelling continued, hav- ing wrested himself from the self-evidence of nature wherein finite and infinite coalesce, must take refuge in the inadequate and fractured realm of concepts. English Romantic poetry, in the tradition of Shelley, Coleridge, and Keats, is an attempt to reintegrate experience and reflection, or, looked at in another way, experience and its expression. This project has received sharp criticism at the hands of post-structuralist critics. Paul de Man, for example, argues that were the symbol actuated it would obviate the production of poetry, since all processes in the world would be immediately revealed in the analogic process of human intellection. He attributes this epistemological impasse to the way in which the terms of Romantic discourse, such as "subject" and "object" and "universal" and "particular," have been understood, and attributes their misun- derstanding to the human incapacity for a priori knowledge of the world. With regards to Coleridge, de Man writes, Words such as 'affinity,' and 'sympathy,' appear instead of the more ab- stract 'analogy'...But the new terminology indicates a gliding away from</page><page sequence="2">478 REBECCA COLE HEINOWITZ RHM, LII (1999) the formal problem of a congruence between the two poles to that of the ontological priority of the one over the other. For such terms as 'affinity' or 'sympathy' apply to the relationship between a subject and an object. The relationship with nature has been superseded by an intersubjective, interpersonal relationship, that in the last analysis, is the relationship of the subject toward itself. Thus, the priority has passed from the outside world entirely within the subject, and we end up with something that re- sembles a radical idealism (de Man, 195-6). De Man argues that the subject and object of Romantic poetry do not achieve synthesis, but that the object is capitulated to the subject by a naive over-identi- fication of the poet with the landscape that inspires him. By this token, the only essence expressed in Romantic verse is that of the perceiving/expressing subject. The tendency to understand subject and object and universal and par- ticular as static dichotomies rather than as the dynamic outlines of a contin- uous perceptual movement, is more easily surmounted, however, in an era such as ours in which faith in fixity no longer seems to subordinate our aware- ness of transience. Gimferrer's work is heir to Romanticism's knotty terms, but Arde el Mar, a book belonging to the "Postmodern" era and influenced by high Modernist poetry, succeeds in releasing language from its contract to define and allowing it performative agency. As in the poetry of the Romantics, the attempt is made to bring subject and object together in the atemporal event of apprehension, but now, the Kantian dilemma of the last century is exacerbated, explosively relativized, and what previously seemed daunting dichotomies are seen to be only as rigid as one's experience of perception. This realm of hyper-subjectiv- ity, whether one understands it from a historical materialist perspective as evincing and responding to social alienation, or shares Schelling's belief that it proceeds from a spontaneous shift in thinking patterns, is precisely Gimfe- rrer's starting point. His poetic proceeds from the fragmentation of the con- temporary world, the lack of faith in that which our senses perceive, the suspi- cion of any fixed correlation between appearance and essence, and from the indeterminacy of these values - what Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe have called the condition of "unfixity" - reveals the existence of a new symbol. Romantic poets would commonly read deep meanings into landscapes, yet curiously, as Paul de Man notes in his essay, "The Rhetoric of Temporality," "this finer attention given to the natural surfaces is accompanied....by a greater inwardness, by experiences of memory and reverie that stem from deeper re- gions of subjectivity" (de Man, 194). Gimferrer writes, "[los rominticos] res- ponden a una apasionada entrega y apertura al mundo exterior, a 'lo otro', un deseo de fusionarse y romper la circel de la individualidad" (Insula, 3). This statement summarizes both the distance between Gimferrer's understand- ing of the particular and that of the Romantics, and the proximity between the two. Gimferrer's interest in the outside world lies in its ability to galvanize imagination, to draw one out of oneself, not into another identity, but out into experience. The Romantic poet, yearning to break from individuality, seeks a fusion with the natural world, but, under the guise of renouncing psychology, only converts the natural world into a reflection of his desire. Wordsworth</page><page sequence="3">ARDE EL MAR: REFORMULA TING THE ROMANTIC SYMBOL 479 writes, "I was often unable to think of external things as having external exis- tence, and I communed with all that I saw as something not apart from, but in- herent in, my own immaterial nature" (Wasserman, 26). Taken to the extreme, this "deseo de fusionarse" achieves its objective all too well and eliminates the possibility for perception to act as convoy between self-contained subjects and objects. Gimferrer's revindication of the particular is rooted in the lucid presenta- tion of imagery. But this imagery is not an end in itself. Gimferrer is too atten- tive to the deceptive capacity of appearances to invest them with unchecked authority. He writes, "Ambigiiedad: un arte de la apariencia. Aprehensi6n de un mundo, del mensaje cifrado que emite a nuestros sentidos y cuya clave no poseemos. Ambigiiedad esencial de la imagen" (Film Ideal, 83). Gimferrer han- dles the image without reifying it as the particular by representing its equiv- ocity, its composition of diverse and contradictory elements. In Band of Angels, one finds a "fulgor estremeciendo el aire" that is "caliente en las mejillas" at the same time as it is "glacial" (AEM, 135). In Primera visi6n de marzo, a bril- liance made of "calados de piedra" accompanies statues that impose their "ful- gor inanimado," a "tambor de piedra," as well as a "sordo conjuro que organi- za palabras," and "una memoria abolida / por el silencio encapuchado de esta tarde" (AEM, 122, 124). This abolished memory, like the leaves in Primera visio6n that change color despite their inability to perceive color as humans do, is not silence but, paradoxically, the act of giving voice to the poem. This alterity of the image to itself corresponds in Gimferrer's work to the self's pursuit of otherness, by means of which poetry is created. Gimferrer writes, "Hacia otro, hacia otra / vida, desde mi vida, en el comuin / artificio o rutina con que se hace un poema" (AEM, 122). Collaboration with the other is necessary for the construction of the poem since the "artificio o rutina" by which poetry comes into being is "algo comfin." Thus, the poet writes of him- self, "Visi6n, suenio yo mismo" in the same way he describes objects of his gaze, "las estatuas / -soiadas desde nifio-" (AEM, 122, my emphasis). With the lines, "Interiormente Ilamo o ilumino / esferas del pasado y me s6 tan distinto / como se puede ser siendo uno mismo," introspection becomes the recognition of distance from that which one discovers upon looking inside oneself (AEM, 123). The paradox that being conscious of "uno mismo" is the recognition of the alien quality of oneself is identified with the act of writing poetry: "...y pien- so / en el mejor final para este raro poema / empezado al azar una tarde de marzo" (AEM, 123). The equivocity inherent in the self, like the equivocity of the image, arrests the reification of meanings. The particular ceases to be the image to which the poet flees - for there is no unequivocal self to flee from and no unequivocal image to take refuge in - and becomes the flight. Despite this emphasis placed on process, on the irreducible fragmentation of human experience, reading the first poem of the book, Mazurca en este dia, one is immediately impressed by the continuity and clarity of the images. A narrative seems to be transpiring: "Tres veces la corneja en el camino, y casi / color tierra las ufias sobre la barbacana," but it is the forceful juxtaposition of the images rather than the actions themselves which propels the narrative for- ward (AEM, 105). In the first eighteen lines of the poem, in fact, only three</page><page sequence="4">480 REBECCA COLE HEINOWITZ RHM, LII (1999) verbs can be found. The suppression of verbs throughout the first two stanzas sets the driving power of the images into relief. But unlike Spanish Neorealist poetry, such as that of Gabriel Celaya, this primacy of the image does not aim to create a verisimilitude in order to erase the divergence between word and object. Rather, the imagery alludes to the rich, cohesive world-vision which such verisimilitude attempts to convey, while at the same time refusing the al- lure of that vision. Here, in the profoundly dialectical assertion that fragmenta- tion and cohesion of vision are mutually inclusive, lies the key to Gimferrer's surmounting of Romanticism's epistemological impasse. Midway through Mazurca, while it seems as if the description of the con- frontation with Urraca is merely being elaborated, "quieta estaba la luz en sus ojos de corza," a significant transformation is being set up. Playing on the po- tential of the adjective "quieta" to signify both the visual: motionless and calm, and the auditory: silent, Gimferrer shifts to the portrayal of a river, wherein the light that recently glimmered in the princess's eyes now rests quietly "sobre el rumor del rio lamiendo el farell6n," for, in this case, were the "quieta luz" still a visual reference, how could it be perceived over a sound? This semantic pivot shows the fluidity and indeterminacy of perception even in the midst of a sin- gular, narrative portrayal, and draws the reader's attention away from the os- tensible scene, to the dynamic scene of language, or rather, of one's own sug- gestible consciousness. Because so much language has been invested in the portrayal of Vellido Dolfos and Urraca, the tenor of the initial scene is not un- dercut, but transferred to perception itself, by the impossible presence of a rock jutting out of the sea in Zamora. In part I of Primera visidn de mano, we read, "el mar hecho ceniza / fingi6 en mis ojos su estremecimiento / y su vibrar de aletas" (AEM, 122). Suddenly, the direction of the wind changes, importing distant voices from land ("idesde aquella terraza?"), and with the sounds of men comes the association of war, such that the mien of the sea responds, and reflects "armadura" rather than the fins in its depths. Further on, a different vision of the sea is presented: "mar, / supe de ti: gaviotas a lo lejos / se volvian espuma" (AEM, 123). Be- cause the sea is the subject being apostrophized, the mention of spume seems self-evident, a programmatic inclusion to enhance the evocation of the sea. However, seizing creative agency, the spume ("ella misma") begins to direct the gaze of the poet, and then his very language, as it winds about the surface of the water. Finally, the poet, after curtly observing tritons and chimeras as though mystical creatures were now less compelling than the sea foam, con- cedes, "es mis ficil / decir que vivo en ella y que mi historia / se relata en su pilido lenguaje" (AEM, 123). Here, the reader becomes aware that the image is not a passive tool the poet wields, but itself a poet, engaged in the flux of consciousness. With this gesture, the Romantic impasse complained of by de Man is dissipated: in the absence of an anthropomorphic humanism that as- sumes man's creative power over the elements, the elements are free to manip- ulate the facets of man. In Mazurca, the appearance of the "farell6n," an unusual form of farall6n, legitimizes the truth value of the scene being invented, insofar as one might as- sume that a poet would not draw on an unusually specialized lexicon unless to underscore the particularity of his source. Behind this nod towards a one-to-</page><page sequence="5">ARDEEL MAR REFORMULATING THE ROMANTIC SYMBOL 481 one correspondence of signifier and signified is the ironization of the Roman- tic credulity of the image, and its replacement by a faith, if such a term can be applied, in mental association. With the act of association as the particular, in- stead of the image, jumps in temporality and location need not be construed as discontinuity, but as a continuous tracking of mental correlations. On lines 15 and 16, 'Y es, por ejemplo, ahora / esta lluvia en los claustros de la Univer- sidad," the poem springs into its fictional present tense, that in which dwells the arcane, reliable, first-person narrator. But the line of associations which led to this jump is what remains foregrounded, since the referent of "es" is vague, and quite possibly refers back to the subject that was reflected in Urraca's eyes and then rose above the murmur of the river: "la luz quieta." The phrase "por ejemplo," furthermore, acknowledges this trajectory as but one of many possi- ble outcomes of associative play with "la luz," an image free from responsibility to any narrative. Gimferrer guides the figure of light, now infused in the rain, into con- frontation with itself: "esta lluvia en los claustros...sobre el Patio de Letras, en la luz charolada / de los impermeables," creating a visual reflexivity which cor- responds to that of the poem (AEM, 106). The light which, at its poetic incep- tion, dwelt in the eyes of Urraca, is now "retenida en la piel," still resolved in its interaction with the body. This formal recursivity serves to strengthen the line of association which weaves through time from a Spanish epic of the Middle Ages to the Patio de Letras at the Universidad de Barcelona where, one sup- poses, El Cantar de Sancho Segundo, from which Urraca hails, is still studied. Even this thread of association finds a tangible correlative in the light pouring over the shoulder of the raincoat and "declinando en la espalda / como un hilo de bronce" (AEM, 106, my emphasis). This moment of synthesis between the purport of the poem and its expres- sion is enunciated by the discharge of the previously suppressed verbs: "...decli- nando en la espalda...restallando en la yerta / palmera del jardin, repicando en la lona / de los tascos paraguas, rebotando en el vidrio," thereby pointing to the act, rather than the image, as the arena of harmony between the finite and the infinite. Although each of these verbs refers to the same subject, the polymorphic light, they propel it through a circuit of diverse sensory experi- ences, infusing the light with audible, visible, and tactile properties. The resul- tant emphasis falls on the process of inventing or observing their association, not the investment in any one particular action. By recognizing the particular as a process rather than a hypostatized image, Gimferrer avoids the pitfall of dissolving its potency in a one-to-one correspondence with some conceptual or spiritual state. Nevertheless, the acuity of this process is dependent on the depth of the stimuli it responds to, such that Gimferrer is obliged to impart to his images the same degree of plenitude they would require were they the par- ticulars through which the universal shone. As though ingenuous of its exposi- tion of process, Mazurca reverts to the plain description of unmoving objects. But almost immediately, the innocent observation of "pana" and "guantes" segues into an enumeration of materials ("marfil," "mimbre") which could belong either to the antique landscapes of Zamora and Florencia presented ear- lier or to the university campus where the poet, or his persona, muses. The eli- sion of the two arenas is achieved by the articulation of things which are inte-</page><page sequence="6">482 REBECCA COLE HEINOWITZ RHM, LII (1999) gral to each, not in subjecting either one to generalizations. By refusing an overt assimilation of the particular image into the universal concept, Gimferrer preserves the conditions of specificity necessary for the integrity of the univer- sal and the particular if they are to be maintained as the parameters of symbol- ic experience. The final four lines of Mazurca en este dia elucidate another element which distinguishes Gimferrer's poetics from that of the Romantics: his formulation of the universal. Rather than identifying the universal with an ineffable and de- terministic doctrine governing the operations of the world, Gimferrer de- scribes the universal as an indefinite set of shifting perceptions. This includes the recognition that perception is operative in all things, not only in those commonly held to have agency. The protagonist cries, "Dios, Equ6 fue de mi vida?" but the portentous exclamation seems more likely that of an assassi- nated king than that of a young man on a college campus. This is a problematic interpretation, though, since the king hasn't been given a voice anywhere else in the poem. The cry could belong to anyone or anything. The following line, "Cambia el color del agua," indented to where the previous line left off, osten- sibly to continue the hexameter, appears, then, as a response to the pendant interrogation. Water, a substance that assumes the color of whatever is placed near it, does not have an absolute color to change. "Cambia el color del agua," in this sense, explains the passage of life alluded to in "que fue de mi vida" as a perennial sequence of responses to that which comes into contact with it. But in order for the Romantic notion of the universal to function in a new way, one additional shift of agency must be allowed: the poem itself must be- come occupied in the activity of its perception. On line 20 of Primera visidn, one reads, "Tanto poema escrito en unos meses," following a description of how the sea altered its reflection of fish fins to that of armor when the voices of men wafted across its surface. This line comments on the spontaneous, poetry- producing sensibility of the natural world, not on that of the poet, or else it would specify, "Tanto poema he escrito." One finds a consummate statement of this awakening of voices in the poem, Oda a Venecia ante el mar de los teatros, wherein, "Las piedras vivas hablan de un recuerdo presente" (AEM, 108). Stones, emblems of inanimacy in stock poetic parlance, are here recognized as expressive entities. This is neither the anthropomorphism of the Greeks nor the personification of Christian allegory; the environment, like anything con- veyed through poetry, exists in a state of awareness which enables it to com- ment on its own construction. Oda a Venecia begins with a complex, self-referential account of time spent in Venice as an adolescent. On line 21, however, this descriptive language is abruptly broken by an interrogation in the first person, "iEstuve aquf? dHabrd de creer que 6ste he sido / y 6ste fue el sufrimiento que punzaba mi piel? / Qu frnigil era entonces, y por qu6." This interruption evinces, first, a lack of investment in the validity of any one narrative. Even if, as the near-verbatim ci- tation of Pound's third Canto, "mirmol en la Dogana...un ffretro en los den- sos canales," suggests, this recalled adolescence is not his, but that of another 1 "I sat on the Dogana's steps / For the gondolas cost too much that year."</page><page sequence="7">ARDEEL MAR: REFORMULATINGTHE ROMANTIC SYMBOL 483 poet, Gimferrer can respond with equal intensity to it (Pound, 11). I am not suggesting that Gimferrer's poetics draws upon the notion of a collective poet- ic (un)consciousness, but rather upon the understanding that all identity, all location, all temporality, ceases to be definitive and restrictive before the unify- ing act of poetic thought. This entails not only an anti-humanist renunciation of the need for autobiographical material, but of the need for an experience to have happened to anybody. It suffices for something to simply have hap- pened, as the statement "&amp;ste he sido" implies. If this one narrative of Venice, Gimferrer comments, has to be the one that pricks his flesh, if he cannot be moved by a concomitance of interchangeable and multiple stories, how "frigil" that one narrative becomes, and all for what? In other words, experiences are not valuable as fetishized moments, but as entrances into the larger web of re- sponse. One could feasibly criticize this reformulation of the universal as inad- equate in comparison with the Romantic symbol, as a mere multiplication of particularities. This critique would consist of the assertion that to replace the universal with actual material rather than with abstract concepts is currently impossible, alluding to Kant's unfulfillable postulate of the completed system wherein every possible schematic configuration is at once concretely realized (Kant, 142-156). Obviously, Gimferrer does not include every possible mask or voice in his poetry; his inclusion is, in fact, highly selective. The voices which are included are those which demonstrate the process of meaning-making in action. The poetic agenda is not to present a panoply of intriguing masks but to emphasize the act of discovering, selecting, and synthesizing those masks. De Man notes: "In Wahrheit und Methode, Hans-Georg Gadamer makes the valorization of the symbol at the expense of allegory coincide with the growth of an aesthetics that refuses to distinguish between experience and the repre- sentation of this experience" (de Man, 188). The Romantic call for an essential organicity between signifier and signified complements the aesthetic self-re- flexivity one finds in Gimferrer's work, yet, as de Man asserts, this synthesis only appears to be the goal of Romantic poetry. De Man claims that the Roman- tic poets were looking for one universal meaning to be manifest in all the real things of the world - evidence of a static equivalence which ultimately preclud- ed any movement between the universal and the particular. Conversely, Gim- ferrer writes, "Se ha desvanecido la ficci6n del hablante inico, la del texto univoco" (AEM, 58). Gimferrer is not seeking universal meaning, but the liv- ing interface which alone can connect the universal and the particular. In Primera vision de mano one experiences the new type of oneness between signifier and signified achieved by the continual expansion of frames of reflex- ivity. The poem begins with the overtly self-conscious announcement of the- matic material, "iTransustanciaci6n!" such that that which follows cannot but appear as the elaboration of this idea. What could be a closer approximation of immanent unity than the doctrine holding that the bread and wine of the Eucharist are transformed into the body and blood ofJesus although their ap- pearance remains the same? The bread and wine commune with the universal- ity of Christ by maintaining their particular appearance. In reading Gimfe- rrer's poem according to this model, one may simply accept a kinetic relation- ship between "el mar" that "vivi6 en las enramadas" and "un jilguero" which</page><page sequence="8">484 REBECCA COLE HEINOWITZ RHM, LII (1999) one would properly expect to find amidst branches. But this reading, in which one thing can simply be substituted for another, would neglect the dynamic of perpetual motion by which this poem operates: the transubstantiation of the act of transubstantiation. This second order of transubstantiation is best illustrated by Gimferrer's use of the body to complicate the relationship of subjectivity and objectivity. The speaker of Primera visitn breaks faith with sensations, the reportings of the senses, in favor of a belief in an ill-defined correspondence between what is in- side and what is outside the body. He suggests an impossible correlation be- tween his own blood and the environment (depicted by allusions to nature, mythology, and art) which would bypass the unreliability of senses: "Sangre, dime....es verdad el color de la magnolia, el grito / del a;inade a lo lejos, la espa- da en mi cintura / como estatua o dios muerto, bailarin de teatro. / iNo me mentis?" (AEM, 121-2). In so doing, the speaker transforms his body's relation- ship to the world into something essential which escapes the treachery of sub- jectivity, bridging the gap between internal and external not, according to the dictates of Romanticism, through intense subjectivity (or "radical idealism," ac- cording to de Man), but by means of its absence. In Gimferrer's postulation of a phenomenological correlative between body and world, whereby one verifies the color of a flower or a bird cry by one's pulse, (as opposed to a psychological involvement of consciousness and world) one undoubtedly hears echoes of Pound and Eliot, but also of the great forbear of Romantic verse, John Donne. As with Romantic poetry, emphasis is placed on the site of subjectivity between word and object, however in the work of Gimferrer, this subjectivity is unable to keep word and object from diverg- ing. Although subjectivity cannot consolidate the disparate elements of experi- ence, however, the poem does not simply substitute phenomenology, pure physicality, as a conceptual panacea. Rather, the prevailing tone of the poem remains one of personal meditation, with the standard confessional poetic "yo," who tries but fails to understand the universe, guiding its exposition. Thus the problematic of the self's transubstantiation, that between body and mind, inside and outside, is left in flux. In Oda a Venecia, Gimferrer compares "un recuerdo presente," the coexis- tence of past and present time, to "la vena [que] insiste sus conductos de san- gre, / va, viene, y se remonta nuevamente al planeta" (AEM, 108). What at first seems an organic simile between time and the body is problematized when the coming and going of blood does not flow back to the heart, but rather, to the planet. This perversion of the natural order exacerbates the disjunction of time that, several words before, seemed regular, and is further complicated when one recalls the presence of the "planeta" in Band ofAngels: "ven hasta mi, belleza silenciosa, / talismin de un planeta no vivido, / imagen del ayer y del maiiana" (AEM, 137). In that poem, beauty is an uninhabited planet as well as the indifference of today and yesterday, such that, reintegrating this suggestion into one's reading of Oda, human blood is seen to flow through the body and into timeless beauty. One recalls that the hands of this personified beauty are those that are entreated, "me salven de morir," again linking beauty to the vital functions of the poet. One must also consider the referent of the "recuerdo presente" to which this beauty has been appended, since the original image</page><page sequence="9">ARDEEL MAR: REFORMULATING THE ROMANTIC SYMBOL 485 being referred to, "un desnudo o adolescente muerto / en las inmensas salas del recuerdo en penumbra," is itself, a reflection back in time to a memory of the poet, not saved from death by beauty, but dead (AEM, 108). From the returning of blood to the planet, we continue, "y asi la vida ex- pande en batin silencioso, / el pasado se afirma en mi a esta hora incierta." Rather than being identified with a certain hour, a single temporal slot, time is identified with an equally dynamic energy, the poet himself. Temporality is kept from being assimilated into the normative structure of cause and effect and is inscribed as the physical act of synthesis. One finds another conversion of temporality into pure action in the final stanza of Oda, "Es doloroso y dulce / haber dejado atris la Venecia en que todos / para nuestro castigo fuimos adolescentes / y perseguirnos hoy por las salas vacias" (AEM, 109). Since the third line speaks of "esta embocadura de escenario vacio," and since the pro- tagonist positions himself "en las inmensas salas del recuerdo," the line, "perseguirnos hoy por las salas vacias," resonates with the both the "salas" and the "vacios" it claims to chase, and the emphasis falls on the chase itself since, linguistically, then and now are already united. Oda a Venecia ends, "y perseguirnos...en ronda de jinetes que disuelve un espejo / negando, con su doble, la realidad de este poema" (AEM, 109). The pursuit of memory, which has been revealed as pursuit itself, is ultimately dis- solved by a mirror. This gesture of dissolving the "ronda dejinetes" is the same gesture which negates "la realidad de este poema." The association between the construction of the poem and the search for one's self is accentuated by the fact that they are dissolved by the same inversion. The asymptotic ap- proach to communion between subject and object is like "buscando el equili- brio de una nota indecisa / que ain no es y ya pas6, qud pura" (AEM, 125). In not responding to these poems chronologically, but in following my own temporality of reading, and in reading the topologies traced by the individual poems as continuous with one another, I hope to have created an interface be- tween this reading and the texts it reads. It is the challenge of poetry and criti- cism alike to suspend its own act of reading against peremptory definition, and this challenge is made more difficult in the face of work that excites a multi- tude of interpretations. But one only resists closure temporarily, in order for the objects of study to reveal themselves in their own terms, before assessing them conclusively. It has been the ultimate purport of this paper to argue for one particular reading of Arde el Mar, namely that its emphasis on the percep- tory act resuscitates the symbol. Gimferrer's triumph opens the field of poetry for greater syntheses of concept and material. As due tribute, then, I abstain from repackaging the discoveries of this reading process, in the hope of sus- pending the motion of the poetry a little longer.
