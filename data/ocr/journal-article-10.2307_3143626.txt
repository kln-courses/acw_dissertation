<plain_text><page sequence="1">MAN'S GREATEST ILLUSION ROBERT LIVINGSTON SCHUYLER Gouverneur Morris Professor of History, Columbia University (Read A7ozeniber 20, 1947) MACAULAY in his essay on Francis Bacon spoke of "illusions to which the whole human race is subject, and which experience and reflection can only partially remove." He had been studying Bacon's Novu im Orgaintwii and, like others before him and since, was deeply impressed by it, so deeply as to say that "no book ever made so great a revolution in the mode of thinking-overthrew so many prejudices-introduced so many new opinions. His attention had no doubt been caught by Bacon's famous exposition of "idols" (idola in Bacon's Latin, from the Greek E't'6wXa), those erroneous beliefs and conceptions which ob- structed the advancement of knowledge. The more general of such untrue notions, those grounded in human nature and common to the whole human species. Bacon called idols of the tribe, or race, and it was of these that lhe was thinking when he likened the human mind to a false mirror, which distorts the nature of objects by mingling its own nature with it. He denied that man is the measure of things, and he asserted that nature can be commanded oniv if she is obevedl. Nevertheless Bacon did not make explicit men- tion of the most prolific of all of man's illusions, the source of a host of impediments to understanding -the illusion of anthropocentrism and anthropo- morphism. During almost the entire course (1 man's existence, ever since he has been capable of thinking about his relation to the external, he lhas taken it for granted that lhe occupied, quite literally. a central position in the physical universe and that non-human objects and beings possessed attrinutes siniilar to his own. Anthropology tells us that primitive man as- sumed the world around him to be full of spirits; and during that long stage of human culture char- acterized by this belief in spirits, or animism, any object might be regarded as possessed of life. soul, will, purpose, and other human attributes. The object might be inanimate or animate, to use categories that were not yet sharply distinguished. It might be a heavenly body, the sea, a river, a volcano; or it might be an animal or a tree. Deism developed out of animism. The conception of spirits as immanent in objects is much older than the conception of man-like deities who rule objects. Tn the words of Sir James Frazer ill Th7 Golden. Bough: The process of thought which leads to the change fromn the one mode of conception to the other is the gradlual investment of the immanent spirits with more and more of the attributes of humanitv. As men emerge from savagery, the tendency to humanise thleir diviinities gains strength; and the moret human the'se become, the wvider is the breach which severs themii from the natural objects of which they wNere at fir.t merely the animating spirits or souls.

Animism, indeed, is still a going concern in primitive communities in various parts ot the world, and survivals of animism are still all aroun(l us. Young children are always animistic, as observant parents well know; and even civilized adults-we ourselves, no less become animistic tinder the influence of strong emotions.

The state of mind which attributes to it these characters of a living creature is one in which the reason is unhinged by grief. All violent feelings have the same effect. They produce in us a falseness in all our impressions of external things, which I would generally characterize as the "pathetic fallacy." From animism as the primitive cosmic philoso- phy, however, our ancestors did emerge quite a while ago, and it is only traces and vestigial rem- nants of animism that are to be found among civilized peoples today. Anthropomorphism, on the other hand, still holds us in its grip. It is basic in orthodox religions; and it is implied in humanistic attitudes and cults in which man is viewed as the culmination of a cosmic purpose, for purpose is a human attribute. Philologists might take exception to the statement that an- thropomorphism is embedded in those languages which, like French, possess no neuter gender and ascribe sex to all objects, even to all ideas. But the proposition is at least arguable. There is in all of us a kind of subconscious vanity, though a better name could perhaps be found for it. We cannot bear to think that we are cosmically unimportant. We can, of course, rno longer believe, as our forebears believed up to some ten generations ago, that we are, literally, at the center of the physical universe. Neverthe- less it is still possible for us to believe that we are at the apex of creation. In what we know about the universe, to be sure, there is no good reason whatever for believing this; but, as Bacon was so well aware and as modern psychology so strongly emphasizes, men usually have little dif- ficulty in believing what they wish to believe. There are some modest individuals in the human race, and we should rejoice in their presence among us; the race as a whole, however, resembles Captain Cuttle in Dickens's Domnbey and Son- Captain Cuttle, who used to walk down the street winking at his own sagacity. The burden of proof, I suggest, should rest upon those who as- cribe to us-to you and to me-a position of unique distinction and eminence in the universe. The fact that we are predisposed to believe what is flattering to our vanity is the best of reasons for questioning our belief. "To have doubted one's own first principles," in the words of Justice Holmes, "is the mark of a civilized man." Anthropocentrism in the literal sense depended, of course, upon the geocentric cosmology which or- iginated with primitive man and received its most refined formulation at the hands of Claudius Ptolemy and his school of astronomy. It perished with the overthrow of that cosmology in the as- tronomical revolution with which the names of Copernicus and Galileo are associated. As a description of the universe as a whole, the sun- center theory of Copernicus may not seem like much of an improvement on the earth-center theory of Ptolemy. Both are about equally re- mote from present-day cosmological conceptions. Still the Copernican revolution did depose man front his self-arrogated station at the center of everything. And the subsequent amazing devel- opment of astronomy has taken place with no greater consideration for his egoism. I have read predictions to the effect that we would cease to be civilized-would return to savagery-if we ceased to believe in our own ultimate importance. I be- lieve that these are false prophecies. We did not cease to be civilized when the astronomical revolu- tion displaced us from our preferential position at the center of the cosmos-quite the contrary. To our ancestors, who lived with dignity and decorum on a stationary earth at the center of a tidy and well-regulated universe, with all the celestial bodies respectfully revolving around them in perfect circles, the situation in which we find ourselves would seem intolerably degraded. Here we are, the erstwhile lords of creation, parasites of a minor planet of a commonplace and wholly undistinguished star, which is but one of some billions that form a galaxy which itself has un- countable fellows-transported in a bewildering maze of motions at astonishing velocities, with the rotation of the earth on its axis, with the revo- lution of the earth around the sun, with the sun in its galaxy, and with the galaxy through space toward-who knows where? The earth is sub- ject to half a dozen major motions, and there are lesser ones. I have heard Harlow Shapley say (in private conversation, but I think he would not object to being quoted) that he had examined photographs that show some galaxies distant from us approximately one billion (1,000,000,000) light years, and that within the portion of space lying within this radius (i.e., a spherical piece of space with the earth as its center and a radius of a bil- lion light years) there are probably about a bil- lion galaxies comparable in magnitude to our own Milky Way System and averaging more than ten billion stars apiece. That is to say, ten billion bil- lion stars in what is at most only a small fraction of that total space which Einstein has taught us to</page><page sequence="3">48 ROBERT LIVINGSTON SCHUYLER [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. conceive of as finite but boundless. And how many of these stars may be the parents of planetary systems more or less like our own Solar System I leave to the conjecturings of professional cosmolo- gists. This is the universe we have to reckon with, and in it a man must be completely obsessed with a sense of the cosmic importance of himself and his fellow human beings, must be a victim of the merest wishful thinking, if he does not come to question the arrogant assumption that the species to which he belongs represents evolution's high- est product. The fact that the development of as- tronomy has had so little effect upon our estimate of our cosmic significance is striking evidence of the strength of human vanity and of our almost total immersion in immediacies of one kind or an- other-which is closely related to our vanity. There is time to speak of only one of the great philosophers who have rejected anthropomorphic conceptions of Deity: the saintly and lovable Ba- ruch Spinoza. He was regarded by his seven- teenth-century contemporaries-Catholics, Protes- tants. and Jews-and for a long time after his day as a monster of impiety; and to those who can think of God only in anthropomorphic terms Spi- noza's religious ideas must seem indistinguishable from atheism, in spite of his explicit repudiation of the charge when it was brought against him. In Part I of his Etlics, entitled "Concerning God," Spinoza denies that even the highest attributes of man are attributes of God. [ know that there are manyv who think that they can show that supreme intellect and free will do ap- pertain to God's nature; for they say they know of nothin) m11ore perfect wvhich they can attribute to God than that which is the highest perfection in ourselves . . . [-But] if intellect and will appertain to the eternal essence of God, we must take these worles in some significations quite different from tho.&gt;e they usuially hear. For [the] intellect and will which should constitute the essence of God would perforce he as far apart as the poles front the humian intellect anld will, in fact. would have nothing in common wsith them hut the namet: there would be about as much corres)ondence between the two as there is between the Dog, the heavenly Constellation, an(l a (log, aln animal that barks. Probably no one has understood better than Spinoza howy deeply ingrained anthropomorphism is in the human mind. In replying to a puzzled correspondent he wrote: . . when you say that if I deny that the operations of seeing. hearing. attending, wishing, &amp;c., can be ascribed to God, or that they exist in Him in any eminent fashion, vou do not know what sort of God mine is; I suspect that you believe there is no greater perfection than such as can be explained by the afore- said attributes. I am not astonished; for I believe that if a triangle could speak, it would say, in like manner, that God is eminently triangular, wvhile a circle would say that the divine nature is etninentlv circular. Thus each would ascribe to God its o\n attributes. Like Bacon, Spinoza viewed the human mind as a distorting medium. Everybody mistakes for external things the forms of his imagination, he declared, adding that "all the explanations coin- monly given of nature are mere modes of imagin- ing, and do not indicate the true nature of any- thing, but only the constitution of the imagination." What Spinoza taught, however, was doctrine that few men have been willing to accept. Illusions of grandeur may take many forms; for exanmple. individual, national, racial, and hu- man racial. The only remedy for them-n nless indeed the- rise to psychopathic dimensions, in which case other forms of therapy may be '"idi- cated"-is the spirit of humility, that "highest virtue, mother of them all." as Tennyson called it. Unfortunately, however, humilitv is one of those virtues to whiclh we la- lip service. WNRe give it an airinog. perlhal)s on Suinda-ys but a complete rest on xveekdavs. I wvish to urge xvith all seriousness and emphasis that the pursuit of this virtue of hluility ought to be a major objective of edlucatioin, though this is not the occasion for an exhibition of plans and blueprints. MIorally wise nmen, whatever thleir fields of endeavor, have always recognized the saving graces of hlutmility and the indispensable role that humility plays in the higher life of manl. Let me sumnmon a few witnesses. The first was a devoted searcher after truth in the realm of plhysical science, the late Max Planck. author of the Quantum Theory and known to us all by reputation at least. In a work entitled (in its English translation) Thc Phiilosophy of Plhysics, a book intended for the laymiian. hle savs: Every in(lividual science sets about its task L)vr the explicit renunciation of the egocentric and anthropo- centric standlpoint.

He diviide(l the</page><page sequence="4">VOL. 92, NO. 1, 1948] MAN'S GREATEST ILLUSION 49 plant world into the categories of poisonous and non- poisonous. He divided the animal world into the categories of dangerous and harmless. As long as he remained bound within the limits of this method of treating his environment, it was impossible for him to make any approach toward real scientific knowledge. His first advance in this knowledge was accomplished only after he had taken leave of his own immediate interests and banished them from his thought. At a later stage he succeeded in abandon- ing the idea that the planet whereon he lives is the central point of the universe. Then he took up the more modest position of keeping as far as possible in the background, so as not to intrude his own idio- syncrasies and personal ideas between himself and his observations of natural phenomena. It was only at this stage that the outer world of nature began to unveil its mystery to him, and at the same time to furnish him with means which he was able to press into his own service and which he could never have discovered if he had continued looking for them with the candlelight of his own egocentric interests. The progress of science is an excellent illustration of the truth of the paradox that man must lose his soul before he can find it. The forces of nature, such as electricity for instance, were not discovered by men who started out with the set purpose of adapting them for utilitarian purposes. Scientific discovery and scientific knowledge have been achieved only by those who have gone in pursuit of it without any practical purpose whatsoever in view. My second witness is that courageous philoso- pher, the late Morris R. Cohen, who, among other shining merits, never hesitated to stand up and be counted when he found himself in dissent from prevailing tendencies of thought. My quotations are all taken from the recently published collection of his posthumous papers called The Faith of a Liberal: . . . we need resignation to learn to live in a world that is not formed just for our own comfort. ... . . . because the practical is important and must not be neglected, it does not follow that the theoretical is of no inherent importance, or that it can be justi- fied only to the extent that it ministers to the prac- tical-that pure science, for instance, has no justifica- tion as an activity in itself, but has value only to the extent that it finds application in technology and the like. I regard the latter view as intellectually and morally vicious. ... Too much absorption with human problems is in- tellectually narrowing. . . . It is a great help . .. to see that our present life is but an episode in the history of mankind, and the latter but an insignificant incident in cosmic history. Such wider vision not only diminishes the exaggerated importance which we attach to most of our practical concerns, but is, as an exercise of supreme intellectual energy, a good in itself if anything is good . . . it impoverishes philosophy to minimize those cosmic interests which have always constituted its life-blood. And our view of the human scene becomes narrow, unillumined, and passionate if we do not rise above its immediate urgency and see it in its cosmic roots and back- grounds. The faith of the liberal, as of the scientist, grows out of a deep humility which recognizes the limita- tions of mortal finitude and acknowledges the impos- sibility of any individual's attaining correct answers to all the problems that he faces. But this humility is combined with a hope that, through rational com- munication and collaboration among individuals, a living body of common thought may be created which will more adequately answer the problems of an age or society than can any individual, whether he be a scientist or a dictator.... Before presenting my third and last witness I should like to say a few words of introduction. Nobody who has paid any attention to recent tend- encies in historiography, especially in this country, would be likely to question the proposition that one of its outstanding characteristics is present- mindedness. By this I mean the point of view of those who believe that the only value of the study of the past is to explain the present. Now if the historian accepts this point of view, he will, of course, omit or play down those past events and developments that do not seem to him to ac- count for the-- present, no matter how important they may have seemed to men at the tille, and, conversely, he will throw his spotlights on those that do appear to him to explain the present, no matter how unimportant they may have seemed at the time. Present-mindedness is an essential ingredient of what has been called "the new his- tory"; but actually there is really nothing new about it. On the contrary, it is extremely old, in fact primitive. It causes those who yield to its blandishments to see the past through the distort- ing medium created by their own present-day standards and presuppositions. Seeking to ex- plain the present in the light of the past, they end by viewing the past, unconsciously or consciously, in the light of the present. They do not perceive that it is bad logic to infer that the past explains the present, even though this be true, from the fact that a historical account seems to explain some present situation when it has been deliberately constructed for this purpose. Present-mindedness bears the same relationship to man's attitude to- ward the past that anthropomorphism bears to</page><page sequence="5">50 ROBERT LIVINGSTON SCHUYLER JPROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. man's attitude toward the universe around him. It is, and always has been, the great distorter of the past, the great source of anachronism, the great foe of historical-mi-ndedness. As a phenomenon of our time it is bound up with that cult of the present to which our sense of self-importance. rationalized by the dogma of evrolutionary prog- ress in human affairs, has given rise. It is gratifying to our self-esteem to look upon ourselves as the heirs of all the ages, but that does not justify us in supposing that the ages existed for the heirs. Historical occurrences-what men have done and thought and felt-had a validity of their own. They did not happen in order to be mere antecedents, they did not happen merely to lead up to us. We are not final in tinie any more than we are central in space. It has been said that our earth and its inhabitants are but a hit of star gone wrong. It xvould be more sensible to think so than to mistake Ourselves for that "one far-off divine evrent, to which the whole cre- ation moves." T now summon my last witness, a historian who thought deeply about the nature and processes of history, myn revered teacher, William Archibald Dunning. As President of the American His- torical Association, he delivered, some thirty-five years ago, a remarkable address on "Truth in History." Distu rl)edl by the dominant cult of the timelv Dunning declared that a spirit of temporal humility was the crying need in the study of history: Our pride in the attainments of our own day dis- torts all our judgments of the past. In vain the master-mind of a distant generation rears with match- less ingenuity a system of institutions based on the teachings of Moses or of Numa. We follow out languidly the story of his system, no matter h1owNr precisely it fitted the demands of the time. At only7 one point will our interest revive, when the master- mind, by some chance, hit upon a notion that has ac- ceptance and vogue in our own day. Here we center our attention and appreciation, and in our history of the affair make the central feature, not the ingenious adaptation of the system to contemporaneous needs and environment, but the accidental fact that there was in the situation something that anticipated the thought or achievement of the wonderful twentieth century.... The realities of the past will never he scientifically apprehended so long as the student of history stands contemplating in a stupor of admira- tiOn the reversals of ancient beliefts effected in our own age. Contempt for those who lacked our light is the worst of equipments for understanding their' deeds. I said a few minutes ago that illusions of gran- detur take a nuumer of forms. To these another must he added, that which exalts our own age at the expense of all past ages. The cure for this present-miindedness is that form of humnility kno-wn as historical-minidecldess.</page></plain_text>
