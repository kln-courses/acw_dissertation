<plain_text><page sequence="1">PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE CULT OF ASCLEPIUS AT ROME Gil H. Renberg, Case Western Reserve University For Lawrence Richardson, jr., and Jerzy Linderski, and in memory of Robert E. A. Palmer 1. Introduction Studies of Asclepius invariably focus on his role as the Greeks' god of medicine, a divine healer who had followed in his father Apollo's footsteps by practicing the medical arts and, having been established at sanctuaries throughout Greece, came to be consulted routinely by individuals suffering physical afflictions.1 The overwhelming majority of sources for the cult of Asclepius come from the Greek East, and furthermore these sources?consisting of works of literature, inscriptions, sculpted objects, archaeological remains, and even papyri?are considerably more illuminating than those pertaining to the god's worship in the Latin West. There are three main reasons for this: in the West The subject of Asclepius's cult in Rome was first drawn to my attention by the late Robert E. A. Palmer in his final Latin epigraphy course, in which I had the privilege of participat ing during my year in the University of Pennsylvania's post baccalaureate program. Prof. Palmer, who belonged to the school of thought that it was better to mandate the subjects of term papers than to let students flail about in an unfamiliar area and risk choosing an unproductive topic, knew that this subject deserved further attention and directed me to study and write about the epigraphical evidence for the cult. I am grateful to him for the initial inspiration to work on this subject, as well as for the basic training he provided me in both epigraphy and Roman topography. It was with great sadness that I learned of Prof. Palmer's recent passing and with great regret that I realized he would not see this article, which might not have been written if not for his suggestion a decade ago. Since undertaking to write this article, I have benefited tremendously from my repeated consultations with Jerzy Linderski and Lawrence Richardson, jr., both of whom added immeasurably not only to the article itself (which they were kind enough to read in draft form) but to my understanding of Roman religion and culture in general. Since this article deals with so many of the areas of ancient scholarship about which they taught me both in and out of the classroom, it is fitting that it be dedicated to them. I must also thank: Rebecca Benefiel, John Bodel, Harriet Flower, Fritz Graf, Paul B. Harvey, Jr., David Koller, Silvio Panciera, Sara Saba, Celia Schultz, and Bronwen Wickkiser for giving me input on specific issues addressed in this article; Kent Rigsby both for his input on particular issues and for reading a discussion of Asclepius in Rome intended for my dissertation and then wisely suggesting that it be removed and discussed elsewhere; Ivan Di Stefano Manzella and William E. Metcalf for providing me with information necessary for my research; Maria Letizia Caldelli for sending me the rel evant portion of her then-unpublished article in Daidalos; and Lisa Mignone for bailing me out of not one bind but two. In addition, I am grateful to Eugenio La Rocca for permission to reprint part of Carettoni's edition of the Forma Urbis Romae, and to Marc Levoy and Jennifer Trimble for permission to reproduce a photo from the Forma Urbis Romae Project's Web site. I am also grateful to the Department of Classics at Johns Hopkins University and the Department of Greek &amp; Latin at Ohio State University for covering part of the cost of the illustrations accompanying this article. 1 In literature, the standard spelling of the god's name was Aesculapius and 'AaxkY\ni?c;. In the Latin inscriptions of Rome, as elsewhere, the god's name was most commonly spelled Aesculapius (or else variants were employed, e.g., Aesclapius, Aisclapius, Aescolapius, Esculapius), while in the Greek inscriptions it was spelled AaxXy]7uog. According to a survey, in the Latin West the spelling Aesculapius is used in 53 percent of inscriptions pertaining to the cult of Asclepius, Asclepius in 16 percent, Aaxkr\ni6Q, or another Greek spelling in 10 percent, and the remaining inscriptions employ either the Greek nociav or one of the Latin variants of Aesculapius (Tassini 1995-1996, 214-219). Instead of opting for Aes culapius, I am employing the Latinized spelling Asclepius, found occasionally in literature as well as inscriptions. For the different spellings of the god's name, see RE 2:2 (1896) 1642-1643, s.v. "Asklepios" (R. Pietschmann); for the Latin variants, see also Diz. Ep. 1 (1895) 314, s.v. "Aesculapius" (D. Vaglieri) and Degrassi 1986, 145, and Georgiev 1977 for the Greek. MAAR 51/52, 2006/2007</page><page sequence="2">88 GIL H. RENBERG there were no sanctuaries comparable in importance to the major Asklepieia at Tricca, Pergamon, Epidauros, Cos, and Athens;2 the few prominent sanctuaries identified in Italy, Dacia, North Africa, and elsewhere have not yielded inscriptions or works of art comparable to those of the eastern sites in terms of quantity or quality; and Asclepius drew little attention from Latin authors, only a few of whom made more than a passing reference to his cult or cult sites. Even though Asclepius was worshiped throughout the western provinces, as is attested by abundant epigraphical and sculp tural evidence, his cult in the Latin West has been all but neglected by scholars, who instead have returned repeatedly to the more ample and intriguing sources from the Greek East.3 But Asclepius's worship in the West deserves to be studied in its own right: as can be seen from a study of the cult of Asclepius in Rome, where he gained his first known foothold in the Roman world and was worshiped for at least six centuries, the god retained his role as healer but also aided his devotees in other capacities as well, becoming a popular recipient of private cult because of his tendency to take a direct interest in his worshipers' lives. Asclepius's cult in Rome therefore evolved over time: initially worshiped as a god whose presence was essential to the state, during the republican period Asclepius quickly came to be worshiped privately as well, and in the imperial period he primarily belonged to the spheres of private religion and military religion, though his importance in public affairs continued to be manifest in his role of protector of the emperors' well-being. Introduced to Rome from Epidauros in response to the devastating plague of 293 B.c. and given a permanent home in a temple at the southern end of the Tiber Island two years later, Asclepius was among the first gods to be officially imported from the East and subsequently at times worshiped along with Roman gods.4 Tradition held that he was conducted to Rome by an ambassador, Quintus 2 But see the emperor Julian's inclusion of the Tarentum sanctuary in a list of prominent Asklepieia (Jul. Gal. 198.2, ed. Neumann). On this site, see Riethm?ller 2005,2:426-427, no. 566. 3 This attitude of neglect is exemplified by R. Pietschmann's express decision to omit from his survey of Asklepieia those in the cities of the Latin West, with the exceptions of Rome and the Greek colonies of Italy and Sicily (RE 2:2 [1896], 1662, s.v. "Asklepios"). For more than a century, the only list of western sanctuaries of Asclepius was to be found in A. Walton's study of his cult (Walton 1894,118-121), but J?rgen W. Riethm?ller has recently provided a full catalogue of cult sites associated with Asclepius in both the East and the West (Riethm?ller 2005, 2:409^60). Even Riethm?ller, however, does not explore the cult in the western provinces in any de tail, just providing a brief survey in addition to his catalogue (Riethm?ller 2005, 1:85-90). The only study devoted to this subject is Danuta Musial's monograph, which surveys a sig nificant amount of the evidence for the cult in Rome, the rest of Italy, and the other western provinces (Musial 1992a). This work does make a valuable contribution but does not repre sent a detailed study of Asclepius in the West and neglects most topographical issues. For a rare example of detailed scholarship regarding the cult of Asclepius at a particular site in the Latin West, see Cristiano Tiussi's study of Asclepius in Aquileia and the north Adriatic (Tiussi 1999). Also of note is an unpublished doctoral thesis written by Paola Tassini on the cult of Asclepius in the Latin West (Tassini 1995-1996). This important work, which consists of a catalogue of 238 inscriptions (mostly dedicatory) from all of the western provinces except those of North Africa, is unavailable outside of a few libraries in Italy, but I had the good fortune to be able to consult it during a visit. Tassini's thesis, while broadly focused on the god's cult in the western half of the Roman Empire, provides an invaluable contribution to the study of Asclepius's worship in Rome, not least because of her autopsy-based readings of several of the inscriptions, and therefore my own work has benefited greatly from hers. In general, I have not sought to argue with Tassini on our few points of disagreement, since her work is unpublished: rather, I have used her work to supplement my own (as is especially evident in my own catalogue), as well as to save myself from making mistakes I might not otherwise have caught. Overall, Tassini's work represents an excellent start to the study of Asclepius in the Latin West, and one hopes that she will complete the task or that someone else will continue her work. 4 From Rome, Asclepius's cult spread to other parts of central Italy during the third and second centuries B.c. (see Degrassi 1986; Coarelli 1987, 23-33; Musial 1990, 236-238; Musial 1992a, 60-71; Riethm?ller 2005, 1:86-87). Several problems are associated with this development, since the god's spread from Rome may have been facilitated by his prior arrival in Magna Graecia and Sicily, which perhaps occurred as far back as the fifth century B.c. (see Cornelia 1982-1983,228-232 and Tiussi 1999,15-16). The earliest evidence for Asclepius's wor ship in Italy might be a bronze statuette of a youth from Felsina in north central Italy that bears a Greek dedicatory inscription written with Corinthian letter forms that date it to roughly 450-425 B.c. {SEG 35, 1029; cf. Riethm?ller 2005,2:438, no.</page><page sequence="3">PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE CULT OF ASCLEPIUS AT ROME 89 Ogulnius Gallus, who was sent by the senate after a consultation of the Sibylline Oracles in 292 B.c. revealed that the god must be enlisted in ending a plague that was devastating the population.5 Soon thereafter, a public sanctuary was established for Asclepius by the senate and honored with a dies natalis on 1 January, and the god was believed to be on call for future emergencies.6 A century later, in 180 B.c., just such an emergency occurred, leading the Romans to call on Asclepius, along with his companion Salus and Apollo, to lift an epidemic that was afflicting the army.7 A comparable situation, though one for which the evidence is more ambiguous, may have occurred in 87 B.c., when the forces of Marius and Cinna were besieging Rome and plague broke out among both the attackers and defenders?perhaps leading to an official appeal to Asclepius for divine aid, according to an interpretation of three coins probably representing the god as a serpent that were issued by the monetalis Lucius Rubrius Dossenus.8 But after 180 B.c. there is no clear indication that he was 613). However, it is uncertain whether it originated in Italy or was brought there later; and, even if originally from Italy, it need not have been erected at a sanctuary of Asclepius rather than one of Apollo or some other Greek god. This Felsina inscription and the use of Latin and Etruscan transliterations of the Doric spelling AloxXamoc, in third-century B.c. inscriptions from central Italy, including an inscribed poculum that possibly originated in Rome (cat. no. 40), does seem to suggest that Asclepius had some degree of presence in the region before his formal introduction to Rome (see Cornelia 1982-1983, 232-235, 242, omitting mention of the Felsina statuette; cf. Musial 1992a, 1^4). (The spelling Aisclapi on the poculum may not be relevant to the issue of Doric influences in central Italy since, as suggested by D. Nonnis, this object may have been prepared by a foreign workman or scribe operating near the Roman Asklepieion: see D. Nonnis in Cifarelli, Ambrosini, and Nonnis 2002-2003,292-293; on linguistic aspects of this spelling, see W?chter 1987,467-468.) Further clouding the issue, Valerius Maximus and the anonymous De viris illustribus claim that an aedes Aesculapii already existed at Antium and was visited by the god's serpent on the way to Rome, whereas Ovid states that the serpent visited a sanctuary of Apollo (Val. Max. 1.8.2; [Aur. Viet.], De vir. ill. 22.2; Ov. Met. 15.722; on the site, see Riethm?ller 2005,2:429, no. 575). Even though Livy indicates that there was a temple of Asclepius in Antium by 170 B.c. (Livy 43.4.7), it is doubtful that Asclepius was worshiped there before be ing introduced to Rome: thus Ovid seems more reliable (see Wissowa 1912,307, n. 4 and Musial 1992a, 60-61; cf. Brucia 1990, 93-101), though his version has not been accepted by all (see Cornelia 1982-1983, 233; Degrassi 1986, 150). Overall, the issue of how and when Asclepius's cult spread in Italy is not yet settled and may never be. 5 On Quintus Ogulnius Gallus, see RE 17:2, "Ogulnius 5"; cf. Degrassi 1986,145-146. The main sources for Asclepius's arrival from Epidauros are: Livy 10.47.6-7 and Per. 11; Ov. Met. 15.622-744; Val. Max. 1.8.2; and [Aur. Viet.], De vir. ill. 22.1-3. For additional references, see D. Degrassi, LTUR, "Aesculapius, Aedes, Templum (Insula Tiberina)," 1:21. The sources themselves are collected in Lugli, Fontes 2:144-148, nos. 9-25 and Torelli, Fontes, 27-36, nos. 3-24. Asclepius's arrival at Rome and the history of the Tiber Island sanctuary have been discussed by numerous scholars: Becher 1970, 217-228, 235-244 et passim; Besnier 1902, 152-183; Bru cia 1990, 63-113; Degrassi 1986, 145-149; Degrassi 1987; de Filippis Cappai 1991; Graf 1992, 160-167 et passim; Guarducci 1971; Guarducci 1978, 158-165; Musial 1990, 232-234; Musial 1992a, 13-59 (with an important discussion of the political background to the god's introduction); Musial 1992b; Pensabene 1980,17-20 et passim; Radke 1987,38-41; Riethm?ller 2005,1:233-236 and2:431-432, no. 586; Roesch 1982; Schmidt 1909, 31^6; Steger 2004, 91-93 et passim; Tiussi 1999, 15-22; Ziolkowski 1992, 17-18 et passim. The arrival of the god in serpentine form was com memorated on the reverse of a medallion struck by Antoninus Pius, which portrays the emperor on the obverse (Gnecchi, Medaglioni romani, 3:9, Antoninus Pius nos. 1-3 + pi. 43, 1-2 = LIMC 8, "Tiberis, Tiberinus," no. 23 + pi.; see Van Buren 1911). His arrival may also have been commemorated in a first-century relief from the Palazzo Rondinini featuring a scene that has been interpreted as the river-god Tiberinus welcoming Asclepius's serpent by offering him water from a spring (Palazzo Rondinini, 211, no. 25 + fig. 120 = LIMC 8, "Tiberis, Tiberinus," no. 13 + pi.; cf. von Duhn 1886, Besnier 1902, 181-183, and Le Gall 1953, 26-27). 6 Seen. 17. 7 Livy 40.37.2-3: Postremo prodigii loco ea clades haberi coepta est. C. Servilius pontifex maximus piacula irae deum conquirere iussus, decemviri libros inspicere, consul Apollini Aesculapio Saluti dona vovere et dare signa inaurata; quae vovit deditque. Decemviri supplicationem in biduum valetudinis causa in urbe et per omnia fora conciliabulaque edixerunt; maiores duodecim annis omnes coronati et lauream in manu tenentes supplicaverunt. ("Finally, this scourge began to be seen as a portent. Gaius Servilius, the pontifex maximus, was instructed to seek a manner of appeasing the gods' wrath, the decemviri to inspect the (Sibylline) Books, and the consul to vow gifts and give gilden statues to Apollo, Asclepius and Salus, which he vowed and gave. The decemviri proclaimed a two-day period of supplication for health in the city and throughout all the market towns and centers. All those who were older than twelve took part in this supplication, wearing wreaths and bearing laurel branches.") 8 See appendix.</page><page sequence="4">90 GIL H. RENBERG called on by the senate to rescue the people of Rome: evidently, never again would his assistance be considered crucial to maintaining or restoring the health of that city's populace.9 Instead, his chief role in Rome's religious life was to be the restorer and preserver of the health of individual devotees, as well as their general benefactor. In these capacities he was worshiped not only at the Tiber Island sanctuary but at numerous other public and private sites as well. The evidence for Asclepius's widespread worship in the city is primarily epigraphical and has been overlooked by many of those discussing his cult in Rome, who generally focus on his main sanctuary and even attribute to it dedications that almost certainly did not originate there. A topo graphical study of the god's places of worship in Rome has not previously been undertaken: as will be seen, such analysis reveals the prominent role the god played in personal religion throughout the city, not just at his healing shrines.10 Asclepius's role of healer has been the sole focus of those who have studied his cult in Rome, and much has been written about the presumed presence of an incubation facility at his main sanctuary. But a careful evaluation of both epigraphical and literary sources calls into question the reliability of much of the evidence cited as proof that Asclepius's ailing worshipers underwent therapeutic incubation at that site and shows that relatively few of his cult sites in Rome can be linked to healing. The present study, therefore, attempts to establish not only where in Rome Asclepius was worshiped but also the nature of that worship and the various ways in which Asclepius was believed to have served his devotees. In the Latin West, no other city has produced as many inscriptions pertaining to the worship of Asclepius, let alone inscriptions so richly varied in content, and therefore understanding the sources on this cult in Rome is essential to appreciating the god's cult in the Latin West.11 2. The Topography of the Cult of Asclepius in Rome and Its Environs Among the most significant questions regarding the worship of Asclepius in Rome is the num ber and location of the god's cult sites (fig. 1). Since no structures dedicated to Asclepius have survived intact, this issue must be investigated by means of other sources of information. The only public sanctuary of Asclepius that can be documented with absolute certainty, through more than a dozen literary references as well as several inscriptions and other artifacts, is the complex on the Tiber Island. There is also convincing evidence that another sanctuary existed on the Esquiline near the Baths of Trajan during the imperial period, and this conclusion has 9 After 180 B.c. there are no recorded instances of the Roman government calling upon Asclepius to ward off a plague. Even during the great epidemic of Marcus Aurelius's reign there is no evidence that Asclepius's aid was officially sought by the senate, though admittedly the contemporary sources for this period are relatively sparse (on the plague, see Gilliam 1961; for Asclepius's apparent lack of an official role in combating it, see Beaujeu 1955, 366). Asclepius's alleged inability to protect the citizens of Rome from subsequent plagues was even fodder for at least two Christian polemicists (August. De civ. D. 3.17, p. 125 ed. Dombart and Kalb; Arnob. Adv. nat. 7.47). However, though perhaps not actively involved in defending the Romans from subsequent plagues, dur ing the imperial period Asclepius did assume the role of conservator Augustorum in at least one inscription (cat. no. 23; see p. 135-136). 10 Though not intended as a topographical study, Tassini's doctoral thesis takes note of several of the pertinent issues regarding the cult of Asclepius in Rome (Tassini 1995-1996). Riethm?ller, on the other hand, includes the various sites linked to Asclepius in his catalogue of the god's cult sites but provides no topographical analysis (Riethm?ller 2005, 2:431-434, nos. 586-598). 11 All of the inscriptions related to Asclepius's cult in Rome and its immediate vicinity are collected in the catalogue at the end of this study, with the exception of two funerary in scriptions (see nn. 152,153) and a small lead seal bearing the word AaxX|y]7cio) about which nothing is known other than the editor's brief description ("Tessera o bollo di piombo, dal rovescio convesso e traforato") {IG 14:2416, 2).</page><page sequence="5">PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE CULT OF ASCLEPIUS AT ROME 91 gained general acceptance.12 In addition, epigraphical evidence attests to the existence of other, less important, sites associated with Asclepius. One of these has been identified from archaeological traces as well as an inscription as a funerary association's schola dedicated to Asclepius and Salus in an area between the Aventine and Monte Testaccio,13 and there is also epigraphical evidence for a shrine associated with a funerary association of Asclepius and Hygieia just outside the Porta Appia at either its schola or the burial site of one of its members. Other inscriptions suggest the existence of at least one cult site outside the Porta Flaminia and another, possibly an Asklepieion, in the northern suburbs beyond the Pons Milvius.14 Perhaps the latter site, like the Tiber Island and Esquiline sanctuaries, was associated with healing, but this role cannot be ascribed to the god's other sites.15 Furthermore, the worship of Asclepius was not limited to his own cult sites: like any god, Asclepius could receive offerings at the sanctuaries and shrines of other gods instead of his own, and this is attested by epigraphical evidence. So, too, is Asclepius's worship at the headquarters of professional associations and commercial complexes. It also appears that Asclepius was worshiped at various military sites, as is indicated by dedications linked to specific military complexes as well as the general preponderance of military personnel among those erecting dedications to him. In addition to this epigraphical evidence, the discovery of several anepigraphical statues and reliefs of Asclepius throughout the city may reveal other sites at which Asclepius was worshiped. However, the fame of the Tiber Island temple has often obscured the fact that Asclepius's cult in Rome was so diverse in terms of places of worship. This diversity becomes apparent when the topographical evidence for the cult is thoroughly surveyed. Healing Sanctuaries Tiber Island. The location of Asclepius's first cult site in Rome, according to legend, was determined by the god himself when, arriving on Quintus Ogulnius Gallus's ship, the sacred serpent brought from the Epidauros Asklepieion suddenly slithered off the ship and swam to the Tiber Island.16 12 An apparently spurious tradition preserved by the Mira bilia Romae concerning a templum of Asclepius at the Baths of Diocletian is more likely to refer to the temple near the Baths of Trajan, as was first suggested by A. Maiuri (see Maiuri 1912,244-245, on Mir. 27; cf. G. De Spirito, LTUR, "Mars, templum," 3:226). Whereas H.Jordan had previously accepted the claim of the Mirabilia and concluded that the primary literary source for the site at the Baths of Trajan had named the wrong bath complex (Jordan 1871-1907, 2:524-526; Jordan 1877,356), Maiuri employed epigraphical evidence to argue that the Mirabilia was in error. His conclu sion is supported by the sequence of monuments listed in the Mirabilia passage itself. 13 As early as the mid-republic Hygieia was recognized as Salus 's Greek counterpart, as is indicated by two references in Terence (Ter. Hec. 338 and Ad. 761). On the relationship between Hygieia and Salus, see Marwood 1988, 150-151. 14 One of these sites is proposed, and another briefly dis cussed, by Guiseppe Cordiano (Cordiano and Gregori 1993, 156). Cordiano is the only scholar to have emphasized the multiplicity of Asclepius's cult sites in Rome indicated by the epigraphical evidence, though Tassini identifies six sites associated with the god in her unpublished thesis (Tassini 1995-1996,253-256), Tiussi briefly recapitulates others' ar guments regarding Asclepius's other cult sites in Rome (Tiussi 1999,22-24), and Riethm?ller includes all of the previously identified or proposed sites in his catalogue but provides no discussion of them (Riethm?ller 2005, 2:431^34, nos. 586-598). (But see also Roesch 1982,177, citing the famous statues of Asclepius erected in the Temple of Concord and Porticus Octaviae (see p. 115) as evidence of the god's "presence" elsewhere in Rome.) 15 It is not surprising that Rome had so few Asklepieia: after all, Athens, a city comparable to Rome in terms of its large size and the amount of information available regarding its religious topography, is known to have had only a single Asklepieion, away from which few dedications to Asclepius have been found (e.g., 7G22:4417,4492-4493,4516). For the Athenian Asklepieion and lesser sites in Attica, see Riethm?l ler 2005, 2:10-22, nos. 2-7. (Asclepius was also honored in IG 22:4457, a joint dedication to Amynos, Asclepius, and Hygieia from the Amyneion: see Kearns 1989, 147; Vikela 2006; and Riethm?ller 2005, 1:12-17, no. 4.) 16 For references to this event, see n. 5.

This function is attested by literary, archaeological, and possibly epigraphical evidence: Suetonius records that Claudius issued an edict forbidding the abandonment of "sick and worn-out slaves" (aegra et adfecta mancipid) on the Tiber Island by owners who wished to avoid the expense of caring for them;18 Festus states that Asclepius's temple was built on the island because of the importance of water for healing the sick;19 hundreds of anatomical votives attesting to the presence of a healing cult, along less than a year after the embassy left for Epidauros and the god arrived in Rome.

According to the edict, which subsequendy was discussed by Roman jurists, these slaves were freed and did not have to return to their masters upon recovering. Since many Roman slaves were Greeks, it can be safely assumed that a significant number of those who were abandoned on the island were favorably inclined toward Asclepius and might not have been altogether unwilling to convalesce at his sanctuary. 19 Festus, De sign, verb., 110 M (= p. 98 Lindsay).

Cecilia in Traste vere and is likely to have originated on the island, while a statuette of a hooded boy thought to be Telesphorus was dredged up from the Tiber and could have been a dedication from the sanctuary;21 and a lengthy Greek inscription that is probably from the site records four miraculous recoveries attributed to the god (cat. no. 6).22 Rather notably, all of the dedicatory inscriptions from the Tiber Island sanctuary address Asclepius alone (cat. nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 7), and no evidence survives for the worship of Asclepius's medical partner Hygieia at the site, even though the two were addressed jointly in four dedicatory inscriptions from Rome that cannot be assigned to this sanctuary (cat. nos. 12,15,27,35; cf. 30)P Although several other gods were worshiped on the Tiber Island, Asclepius was considered the preeminent divinity, and so, even though the island was generally referred to as the Insula, Insula Tiberina, Insula inter duos pontes, or by similar names, it also was known as the Insula Aesculapi because of the prominence of the god's sanctuary.24 The reason for establishing Asclepius on the Tiber Island rather than within the city was already lost to history in the imperial period, and thus conflicting explanations have been proposed both 20 Nearly 500 terracotta anatomical dedications and statue fragments dating to the third and second centuries B.c. have been found either at the Tiber Island or nearby: 352 alone come from a cache at the foundation of the Pons Fabricius and 7 from the riverbed beneath the bridge, 51 more from the modern Ponte Garibaldi and the small island that used to be just north of the Tiber Island, 39 from the Ponte Rotto, 27 from the area of the Pons Cestius, 13 from the Via di Ponte Rotto, 11 from the modern Ponte Palatino, and just 4 from the Tiber Island itself (see Pensabene 1980, 5-21, 25-31, et passim; cf. Besnier 1902, 230-238). These dedications, which date to roughly the same period as the four small republican-era bases linked to the temple (cat. nos. 1-3,7), appear to testify to the popularity of Asclepius's cult during the mid-republic, but it must be recognized that a number of the terracottas may have originated at the sanctuaries of other gods in the area, Apollo Medicus in particular (see Pensabene 1980, 19-20).

Donatella Degrassi's claim that inscriptions attest to the worship of Hygieia on the Tiber Island appears to have been based on an assumption that the five dedications from Rome that name or represent her originated there (D.

Degrassi 1986, 146, recognizing that there were other fac tors as well. Joel Le Gall, noting that foreign gods who were excluded from the pomerium were traditionally installed in the Campus Martius, proposed another explanation: that Asclepius was deliberately established on the island to take over from the river-god Tiberinus as a healer (see Le Gall 1953, 104-105; cf. Guarducci 1971, 270 and Degrassi 1986, 146-147). Against such suppositions, see Graf 1992, 164-166. See also A. Ziolkowski's discussion of the availabil ity of public space being a more important consideration for the placement of new temples than whether they were intra or extra pomerium (Ziolkowski 1992, 278). 27 In addition to the detailed catalogue of Asklepieia in Greece and the Greek islands prepared by Riethmuller (Riethm?ller 2005), which includes topographical informa tion, see the survey by A.

Cum enim ex pestilenti in salubrem locum corpora aegra translata fuerint et e fontibus salubribus aquarum usus subminis trabuntur, celerius convalescent. Ita efficietur uti ex natura loci maiores auctasque cum dignitate divinitas excipiat opiniones?1 There will be a natural suitability if, first of all, for all temples the most healthful areas are chosen, and in these places, in which shrines are to be erected, there be adequate springs of water. This is especially the case for Asclepius, Salus, and the other gods by whose treatments many of the sick appear to be cured. For when the sick are brought from a pestilential to a healthful place and treatments are supplied from healthful springs of water, they convalesce more quickly. And so it happens that from the nature of the place the divinity receives a reputation that is greater and of higher standing. Fresh water was indeed available at the Tiber Island site: not only was there the river flowing by on both sides, but a medieval well head at S. Bartolomeo, the church where the temple is believed to have stood, indicates the presence of a spring or well that may have been a factor in the selection of the Asklepieions location (fig. 4).32 Furthermore, the island was largely uninhabited and removed from the open sewers and other health hazards of the city, so it was more conducive to convalescing than Rome's other neighborhoods.33 Therefore, the Tiber Island may have been chosen because of its healthful nature and its separation from the contagion and death that were commonplace in the city, while the exact spot on the island was determined by the presence of a water source: thus the site for Asclepius's first temple in Rome was intended to facilitate the god's medical practice rather than to comply with religious scruples over the pomerium?4 (Even after the Asklepieion itself was destroyed and built over, the Tiber Island continued to be devoted to healing: as far back as 29 Plin. HN 29.8.16. As Paul Roesch correctly points out, the Romans' belief in Asclepius's power was demonstrated by the fact that they brought him from Epidauros, and they would not have risked offending the god by barring him from the city (Roesch 1982,174). Pliny's reference to two temples, one built "outside the city" (extra urbem) and the other "on the island" (in insula), was previously taken literally (see Bartoli 1917; cf. Wissowa 1912, 307, n. 7) but is instead thought to refer to the temple's initial construction and subsequent reconstruction (see Degrassi 1987, 523). 30Festus, De sign, verb., 110 M (= p. 98 Lindsay) (quoted below, p. 99). 31 Vitr.

On the well head, see n. 35. 33 The island had a single vicus, the vicus Censori, which pre sumably could have included dwellings in addition to public buildings (see D. Degrassi, LTUR, "Vicus Censori," 5:157). A portion of the vicus Censori, including what appears to be its compital shrine, is shown on the Severan Marble Plan of Rome (fig. 3b). For some of the unhealthy aspects of living in Rome, see Nutton 2000, 66-67 et passim. 34 Roesch questioned the reliability of Festus's statement that the Tiber Island was chosen as the site of the Asklepieion because of its water supply, noting the presence of water sources throughout Rome (Roesch 1982,174). However, the additional requirement identified by Vitruvius, that sanctuar ies of Asclepius be set in "the most healthful areas," along with Plutarch's statement that the island was "more healthful" than other parts of Rome, offsets Roesch's concerns.</page><page sequence="12">98 GIL H. RENBERG Fig. 4. View ofS. Bartolomeo allTsola, former site of the Tiber Island Asklepieion (photo Fototeca Unione, AAR, neg. FUN.1669.Nash). medieval times the aforementioned well at S. Bartolomeo was believed to supply healthful drafts,35 while in the sixteenth century a hospital of the Franciscan Order, the Ospedale Fatebenefratelli (now the Ospedale San Giovanni Calibita Fatebenefratelli), was built on the northern half of the island, where it stands to this day.)36 35 The well bears a medieval inscription that may attest the power of its water, though the worn condition of the letters makes this uncertain. F. von Duhn originally read, Qui sitit ad fontem veniat potumque salubrem [h]auriat ex vena [?] ("Whoever thirsts, let him come to this fountain and draw a healthful drink from the channel(?)")(von Duhn 1886,171). This reading was partly challenged by Carlo Cecchelli, who examined the inscription and detected no reference to the "healthful drink" and also noted other problems with von Duhn's text, though in both readings the inscription is an invi tation to drink of the well (see Cecchelli 1938-1951,2:40-43, who did not provide a new text). On the well head and relief, see Pazzini 1934, 203-208; de Francovich 1936; Cecchelli, 1938-1951,40-46; cf. Guarducci 1971,280-281. 36 According to a possibly spurious tradition preserved in a medieval text, St. Emigdius, bishop of Ascoli Piceno, vis ited an unspecified templum Aesculapii during the reign of Diocletian and healed many in the name of Jesus, leading the crowd to destroy Asclepius's altar and throw his cult statue into the Tiber River, from which it can be inferred that the passage pertains to the Tiber Island Asklepieion [Acta S. Emygdii 11 (= Acta Sanct., Aug. II, 31, ed. H. Delehaye et al.); cf. Besnier 1902, 240-241 and Guarducci 1971, 279). Regardless of whether Emigdius was indeed responsible for the temple's destruction, the pagan cult sites of the Tiber Island were eventually replaced by Christian holy sites, beginning with shrines devoted to relics and culminating in the erection of churches (see Cecchelli, 1938-1951,29-105; Guarducci 1971,279-281). While healing powers may have been attributed to some of the Christian saints and bishops associated with the island during the medieval period?far from a unique characteristic among prominent Christian figures of late antiquity and later periods?there is little reason to conclude that their presence on the island represents a deliberate program of supplanting Asclepius (see Guarducci, 1938-1951, 280; cf. Besnier 1902, 242-243 and Pazzini 1934, 201-203, which</page><page sequence="13">PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE CULT OF ASCLEPIUS AT ROME 99 That Asclepius was worshiped in a proper temple is made clear by the use of the term aedes in three literary sources and AaxXr)7u?iov in another,37 rather than the more frequent?and nonspe cific?alternatives templum and isqov.38 Little is known about the sites architectural history, but an inscription recording the use of the stips Aesculapi by the aediles for unspecified construction on the island (cat. no. 4), seen in light of Varro's statement that the paintings of light-armed cavalry had been in "the old temple of Asclepius" {in Aesculapii aede vetere), indicates that the temple was most likely rebuilt toward the end of the republic, when the island itself was systematically monumental ized and the Pons Fabricius was built (in 62 B.C.).39 There is little question that the Asklepieion was located at the southeastern end of the island, which today is the site of the tenth-century church of S. Bartolomeo allTsola.40 Because of this, no traces of the sanctuary remain visible, although several granite and marble columns and other architectural components employed in the church's construction?and visible to visitors?are believed to have been used in the Asklepieion?1 and, as noted above, the medieval well head on the chancel steps may reveal the site of the spring or well that would have supplied fresh water for the site.42 While the sanctuary itself is gone, carved into the southeastern wall of the island, which in antiquity was revetted with travertine in the form of a ship's stern, there can be seen a relief consisting of a worn bust assumed to be that of Asclepius, between a staff wound with a serpent on the left and a bucranium on the right (figs. 5a-b).43 Literary sources shed little more light on the sanctuary's layout and features. The only discussion of the sanctuary itself appears in the passage by Festus that includes a reference to the importance of water for healing: In insula Aesculapio facta aedes fuit, quod aegroti a medicis aqua maxime sustententur. Eiusdem esse tutelae draconem, quod vigilantissimum sit animal; quae res ad tuendam valitudinem aegroti maxime apta est. Canes adhibentur eius templo, quod is uberibus canis sit nutritus.

The serpent is guardian of this temple, because it is a most vigilant animal greatly overstate the link between Asclepius and his succes sors). Even if the worship of Asclepius on the Tiber Island was waning by the fourth century, as Margherita Guarducci speculates, the Asklepieion is unlikely to have suffered the fate of eastern Asklepieia that were immediately replaced with churches, since in Rome public sanctuaries were spared such conversions until the seventh century at the earliest (see p. 108; on the Church's appropriation of Asklepieia and other sanctuaries in the East, see Frantz 1965 and Gregory 1986, 237-239). 31Aedes: Livy, Per. 11; Varro, LL 7.57; Festus, De verb, sign., 110 M (= p. 98 Lindsay). ?axXY]7ueiov: Cass.

Dogs are made present in his sanctuary, because he was nourished by the teats of a dog. He holds a knotty staff, which symbolizes the difficulty of this art. He is crowned by laurel, because this tree is a source of many remedies. Hens are sacrificed to him. This passage indicates that the god's cult statue, as was typical, represented Asclepius holding a staff and wearing a wreath.45 Also, as at other Asklepieia, sacred serpents and dogs, whose presence was believed to be therapeutic, lived within the precinct.46 Nothing else is known from literature about the features of Asclepius's sanctuary, other than the minor detail that Varro had seen paintings of light-armed cavalry (ferentarii equites) within the "old" temple.47 By the mid-republic, as is revealed by Livy and Plutarch, there were many "temples and porticoes" on the Tiber Island, and since porticoes were commonly found at Asklepieia?as at sanctuaries of numerous other gods?it is reasonable to assume that at least one of those mentioned by the two authors was located within Asclepius's sanctuary.48 Some of these porticoes may have housed shops at which, at least during the mid-republic, worshipers could buy the anatomical dedica tions and other types of thank offerings that have turned up at the bottom of the Tiber in such profusion.49 These porticoes also may have been used for the display of statues and other works of art dedicated to the god, such as the colossal statue of Asclepius found on the Tiber Island in 45 On the standard iconography of Asclepius, see LIMC 2 (1984) 863-897, s.v. "Asklepios" (B. Holtzmann) and Edel stein, Asclepius 2:214-231. The statue also may have been alluded to by Ovid, who indicated that when Asclepius ap peared to Quintus Ogulnius at Epidauros in a dream, he took "the form which he is accustomed to in the temple, holding a rustic staff with his left hand and with his right pulling at the flowing hair of his long beard" (qualis in aedelesse solet, baculumque tenens agreste sinistra\caesariem longae dextra deducerebarbae) (Ov. Met. 15.654-656; see Guarducci 1971, 270-271). However, there is reason to believe that the pas sage instead refers to Nikeratos's statue of Asclepius from the Temple of Concord (see Becatti 1973-1974, 18-19, 39; on Nikeratos and this statue, see n. 110). Nothing else is known concerning Asclepius's cult statue on the island, but it may be obliquely referred to by Suetonius, who records that after recovering from a serious illness?most likely the one that struck him in 23 B.c. (Cass. Dio 53.30.1-3)?Augustus erected a statue of his physician Antonius Musa (PIR l2, A 853) beside Asclepius's statue (Suet. Aug. 59: statuam . . . iuxta signum Aesculapi statuerunt). It has been assumed by some that this would be the cult statue on the Tiber Island (see, e.g., Lugli, Fontes 2:152, no. 52 and D. Degrassi, LTUR, op. cit., 3:100). While it is indeed possible that Musa's statue stood beside Asclepius's in the temple's cella?as may have been the case with a statue commonly identified as Servius Tullius's that stood within the Temple of Fortuna (see Rich ardson, NTDAR, "Fortuna, Aedes," 155)?or else in the immediate vicinity of the temple, it is just as possible for the statue of Asclepius referred to by Suetonius to have stood elsewhere in Rome, perhaps in the Temple of Concord or Porticus Octaviae, the site of another famous statue of the god (see p. 115). On Musa, see Michler 1993. See Edelstein, Asclepius 2:167, 227-228 and Girone, la mata, 91; cf. RE 22 (1896) 1681-1683, s.v. "Asklepios" (R. Pietschmann) and Wacht (n. 193 below), col. 223. 47 Varro, LL 7.57. Lawrence Richardson, jr., has proposed that these paintings may have portrayed a major battle and were dedicated in honor of the victory (Richardson, NTDAR, op. cit., p. 3). 48 Livy 25 A {ut iam eminens area firmaque templis quoque ac porticibus sustinendis esset); Plut.

A passage in one of Ennius's tragedies stating that "the porticoes of the sons of Asclepius are packed with the wounded" {namque Aesculapi liberorum saucii opplent porticus) inexplicably has been seen as relevant to the Tiber Island sanctuary by Giuseppe Lugli (Lugli, Fontes 2:151, no. 83; cf. Besnier 1902,200), but since the unidentified play, sometimes thought to be Hectoris Lytra, is set in the Trojan War, this is inconceivable (Enn., seen., frag. 171, line 326, ed. Jocelyn). 49 See Besnier 1902, 237-238. On anatomical dedications from the site, see n. 20. The likely presence of these shops in the immediate vicinity of the sanctuary was suggested by Lanciani, who instead thought that they were located on the road approaching the Pons Fabricius, where some of the ded ications were found (Lanciani 1888, 70; Lanciani 1892, 62; cf. Notizie degli scavi di antichit? [1885] 156). But the small rooms appearing on the surviving part of the Severan Marble Plan that shows the Tiber Island could easily have served as shops for those visiting the sanctuary (figs. 3a-b). While the porticoes seen by Livy might have been constructed during the monumentalization of the island that postdated these mid-republican votives (see p. 99), it is nevertheless probable that porticoes had already been a feature of the island before its first-century B.c. makeover.</page><page sequence="16">102 GIL H.

Giovanni Calibita of a pavement with a mosaic dedicatory inscription addressed to Jupiter Jurarius59 or to Veiovis, who was occasionally confused with Jupiter by Roman poets and had an aedes somewhere on the island that shared the dies natalis of Asclepius's temple.60 Since the mosaic and the site of the temple of Asclepius were on opposite sides of the road that bisected the island crosswise, which was either the vicus Censori itself or adjacent to it, any structure joining the precincts of Asclepius and this Jupiter would have had to incorporate 54 See von Duhn 1886,170; cf. Besnier 1902,183. This relief appears related to a relief of an unidentified female figure, probably divine, sitting in a small boat {Palazzo Rondinini, 212, no. 26 + fig. 119; cf. von Duhn 1886, 169 + pi. 10). However, since this scene has no known relevance to the cult of Asclepius, it may argue against assigning the relief of the serpent to the Asklepieion. 55 For the latter view, see von Duhn 1886, 168. 56 Fritz Graf, following Besnier and his predecessors, interprets the tree as symbolic of a grove at the sanctuary since sacred groves were common to Asklepieia (Graf 1992, 181-183, esp. 183; Besnier 1902, 200). Nonetheless, as Van Buren states, a single tree need not have been a stand-in for an entire grove (Van Buren 1911, 189). 57 Similarly, a series of coins issued under Septimius Severus, Caracalla, and Geta that represent Asclepius standing in a temple may depict the Tiber Island temple, as has been suggested by Lugli (Lugli, Fontes 2:148-149, nos. 32-35). However, this is unlikely to be the case for all of them: while the three coins dating to A.D. 207 probably represent this temple because they appear to have been struck in com memoration of its 500th anniversary (see p. 125), a coin from A.D. 203 featuring a similar scene on the reverse need not have been linked to the Tiber Island temple {BMCRE 5:338, no. 837 + pi. 50, 7), while the coin of A.D. 215 that shows Caracalla making an offering in a temple of Asclepius is much more likely to represent the temple at Pergamon because the emperor had just sought treatment there, and coins commemorating the occasion of his visit had also been minted at Pergamon {BMCRE 5:458, no. 148 + pi. 71, 8, wrongly associated with the Tiber Island temple by Hill 1989, 38 and Penn 1994, 39; for Caracalla and Pergamon, see n. 179). It must be recognized, however, that even if some of the coins do represent the Tiber Island temple and cult statue, they provide no architectural or iconographi cal details of value. This is also true of the coin of Lucius Rubrius Dossenus that shows a serpent within a temple, which would be that temple if the serpent were Asclepius (see p. 160; cited by Hill 1989, 38).

RENBERG an archway or gate.61 On the other hand, Ovid's statement can be interpreted not as an indication that the temples of "Jupiter" and Asclepius were physically joined but rather that they were linked because they shared the island, so it is impossible to rule out Jupiter even if his cult site was across the street from Asclepius's. For the same reason, Veiovis can potentially be considered the magnus avus regardless of where on the island his aedes stood. This problem is ultimately unresolvable but may give hints at the topography of the island's southern half. Despite the clear evidence that dedications for Asclepius and sculpted representations of the god were discovered or first recorded at numerous sites throughout the city, the existence of minor shrines of Asclepius in and around Rome has been largely ignored by scholars, and thus there has been a general tendency to assign to the Tiber Island Asklepieion nearly every dedicatory inscrip tion addressed to Asclepius, particularly those composed in Latin.62 This includes not only several inscriptions found a significant distance away from this sanctuary and, in some cases, linked to other sites (cat. nos. 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 24, 26, 28, 33) but also five dedications of unknown provenience (cat. nos. 31, 32, 33, 34, 35) and two fragmentary inscriptions that are no longer considered to have been addressed to Asclepius.63 Furthermore, one of the Greek dedications of unknown provenience has been assigned to the Tiber Island by some without a convincing reason for doing so (cat. no. 37), and the large tablet recording four healing miracles may also have been assigned to this sanctuary based on speculation misinterpreted as fact (cat. no. 6).64 In fact, only four dedications can be firmly linked to this temple: three limestone bases from the republican period found nearby in the riverbed (cat. nos. 1-3)65 and an early imperial marble altar found on the island itself (cat. no. 5).66 In addition, another dedicatory inscription should be assigned to the On the vicus, see n. 33. 62 G. Wissowa listed CIL 6:1-20 and 30842-30846 (= cat. nos. 1,2,3,4,5,7,12,13,15-20,24,26,28,31,32,33,34,35,42, and CIL 6:3 and 15, on which see next note) (Wissowa 1912, 308, n. 4), while Platner and Ashby listed only CIL 6:7-20 and 30842-30846 (= cat. nos. 1, 2,3,4,5, 7,12,15,16, 20, 24, 26, 28, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, and CIL 6:15) (Platner and Ashby, TDAR, op. cit., 2-3), as did Luigi Moretti {IGUR 1, p. 87). In contrast, Richardson, who cites the same inscrip tions as Platner and Ashby, recognizes that "few seem to have been found in the vicinity" of the Asklepieion (Richardson, NTDAR, op. cit., 4), while Jordan was even more cautious in listing only those found on the island or almost certain to have originated there (Jordan 1871-1907, 1.3:634, n. 30, listing cat. nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7). Besnier, though he recognized that only cat. nos. 4 and 5 were found on the island itself, believed it likely that cat. nos. 31 and 35 also came from the Asklepieion but provided no particular reason for singling out these two dedications (Besnier 1902, 211-212). Lugli included not only cat. nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 but also cat. no. 28, which may instead be from the Castra Ravennatium or another military site in Trastevere (Lugli, Fontes 2:150-151, nos. 43-47, 49, 50). More recently, Degrassi has correctly included cat. nos. 1, 2, 3,4, 5, and 7 but makes the mistake of assuming that cat. nos. 31, 32, and 33 came from the site as well (D. Degrassi, LTUR, op. cit., 1:22), while Riethm?l ler has also listed cat. nos. 1-5 and 7, as well as the more dubiously assigned 28 and 30 (Riethm?ller 2005, 2:431), and also claims that several other dedications to Asclepius of unknown provenience also are most likely from the Tiber Island sanctuary (cat. nos. 31,32,34, and 35) in addition to a possible forgery (cat. no. 42) and two unrelated inscriptions {CIL 6:3 and 15) (Riethm?ller 2005, 2:434). 63 CIL 6:15 has been demonstrated to be a fragment of a larger inscription that is altogether unrelated to the cult of Asclepius {CIL 6:36883) but still appears in some scholars' lists (see previous note). This is also true of CIL 6:3 + add. p. 3003, an inscribed sculpture fragment from Tor Marancia on the Via Ardeatina that Henzen believed was addressed to [Aesculapi]o deo, no doubt because of the presence of a serpent enwrapping a foot. However, the positioning of the serpent is not typical of Asclepius's iconography, calling into question this restoration. More recent scholars have settled on a restoration of [Liberjo deo, which finds support in the presence of other traces of Liber Pater s cult in the vicinity (see Caldelli 2004, 229-237). 64 See the catalogue for discussions. 65 For these and dedications to other gods recovered from this part of the Tiber, see Pensabene 1980, 16-17; cf. Roma medio repubblicana, 138-147. 66 Cat. nos. 20 and 34 were assigned to the Tiber Island by Lanciani without basis for doing so, even though the former is reported to have been seen first at the Orti Giustiniani north of Rome and most likely originated at a Praetorian shrine (Lanciani, StSc 3:269 and FUR, pi. 28). Two other dedications are problematic for different reasons: cat. no. 42 is also of unknown provenience but may be a forgery, and</page><page sequence="19">PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE CULT OF ASCLEPIUS AT ROME 105 Tiber Island because it dates to the republican period, when no other cult site of Asclepius in Rome is known, and also because of indirect evidence (cat. no. 7). To these can be added the nondedicatory inscription referring to the use of the stips Aesculapi for unspecified construction, which was found at S. Bartolomeo (cat. no. 4). However, the likely presence of additional sites sacred to Asclepius, as well as shrines of other gods at which Rome's inhabitants might also have erected dedications to him, would suggest that at least some of the unprovenienced inscriptions addressed to Asclepius have been wrongly attributed to this sanctuary. Esquiline. Of the other sites at which Asclepius was worshiped in Rome, only the Esquiline sanctu ary, the existence of which is suggested by inconclusive but nevertheless persuasive evidence, has received significant attention.67 Although it is mentioned by only one ancient literary source, this reference and the epigraphical evidence that has been linked to the site indicate its importance. According to the anonymous Passio SS. Quattuor Coronatorum, a Christian martyrology dating to the late sixth or early seventh century, this temple was restored by Diocletian during his visit to Rome for his vicennalia, which occurred in A.D. 303:68 Veniens vero Diocletianus ex Sirmis post menses undecim, ingressus est Romam. Et statim ius sit in termas Praianas templum Asclepii aedificari et simulacrum fieri ex lapide proconisso [sc. proconnesio]. Quod cum factum fuisset praecepit omnes curas in eodem templo in praegomas [sc. praeconias] aeneas cum caracteribus infigi, et iussit ut omnes militiae venientes ad simulacrum Asclepii sacrificiis et ad turificandum compellerentur, maxime urbanae praefecturae milites.69 Diocletian, coming from Sirmium after eleven months, entered Rome and immediately ordered that the temple of Asclepius in the Baths of Trajan be restored and a statue be made from Proconessian marble. And when this had been done, he instructed that all the cures achieved in this very temple be inscribed publicly in bronze and posted, and he ordered that all of the services, especially the soldiers of the urban prefecture, be compelled to approach the statue of Asclepius with sacrifices and to offer incense. The existence of this sanctuary of Asclepius, which is not otherwise attested in surviving literature or corroborated by archaeological remains, is supported by epigraphical evidence indicating that the Passio correctly places a temple of Asclepius in the vicinity of the Baths of Trajan. Two statue bases featuring Greek dedicatory inscriptions for Asclepius were found close to this complex, one in the cat. no. 41, a plaque recording the dedication of an image of a serpent, presumably to Asclepius, has been assigned by one editor to Rome but is more likely to be from Puteoli. In addition, a poculum for Asclepius dating to the early third century B.c. from Chiusi or its vicinity is thought to have been produced and purchased in Rome (cat. no. 40), perhaps even at the Tiber Island, which would make it the earliest known artifact pertaining to the cult of Asclepius in Rome, as well as evidence for the god's growing popularity in Italy (see Degrassi 1986, 148-149). (Chiusi appears to have been the origin of the gens Ogulnia, which suggests the possibility that Quintus Ogulnius, the Roman ambassador who transported Asclepius back to Rome, did not limit his role in spreading the god's cult to this city alone: see Tiussi 1999, 18-19.) 67 Maiuri first argued for the existence of an Esquiline site, which has gained general acceptance (see Maiuri 1912; IGUR 1, p. 84; Guarducci 1978,165; D. Degrassi, LTUR, "Aescu lapius, Aedes (M?ns Cispius)," 1:22-23; Riethm?ller 2005, 2:432-433, no. 589; cf. G. De Spirito, LTUR, "Aesculapius, Templum infra Thermas Traianas," 1:23 and Lugli, Fontes 3:136-137, nos. 38-40). 68 For Diocletian's building program in Rome and relation ship with the city's residents, see Curran 2000, 43-48. 69 Passio SS.

Further indicating Diocletian's reverence for Asclepius, the Passio?the accuracy of which, of course, may be questioned?recounts the martyr dom of Pannonian artisans at Sirmium for refusing Diocletian's request that they fashion a sculpture of Asclepius for a temple.

RENBERG coenobium of the Carmelite convent at S. Martino ai Monti and the other just behind the church (cat. nos. 8-9), while a small altar addressed in Greek to "lord" Asclepius and found near the baths at the intersection of the Via S. Clemente and Via Labicana can also be assigned to the Esquiline sanctuary (cat. no. 10). Likewise, a statuette discovered in a medieval wall near Madonna dei Monti, a short distance down the Via Cavour, was found close enough to S. Martino that it can be assigned to the same site as the inscriptions.70 The presence of these dedications and the statuette near where the Passio located a templum of Asclepius argues forcefully for the existence of the otherwise unattested site, and since one of them bears the phrase "and in this very temple he erected thank offerings for recovery" (... vrjw 8' sv xo)8? Ccoaycua Orjxev), it appears that the templum featured an actual temple (cat. no. 8B, line 7). That two of the inscriptions were found at or near S. Martino perhaps indicates that Asclepius's temple was originally located in the vicinity of this church and the adjoining piazza, on the Oppian just off the clivus SuburanusJ1 Recent work on the Severan Marble Plan shows that there was a triple fountain at the present site of the Piazza S. Martino ai Monti, and this may have served as the sanctuary's source of water; at the very least, the presence of this fountain, along with a nearby nymphaeum, demonstrates the availability of a water source in the area.72 The evidence for the Esquiline sanctuary's history is circumstantial and far from complete. The year of its founding is unknown and has been the subject of speculation. While some have cited the dedication by a Praetorian medicus cohortis in A.D. 82 as evidence that the site was extant by the Flavian period (cat. no. 24), this dedication is more likely to have come from a military site, and thus it is the presence of the three second-century A.D. Greek inscriptions that serves as a terminus ante quemP The likelihood that the site already existed by the end of the second century A.D. indicates that the Passio s use of the term aedificari refers to a restoration or expansion under Diocletian rather than the establishment of a new templum Asclepii.14 That the site was still active in the early fourth century might also be indicated by a Latin inscription that in the Diocletianic period or later was added to the left side of the statue base from S. Martino (cat. no. 8), but it is not certain that the later inscription was intended for display in the sanctuary.75 The sanctuary's continued existence half a 70 Rome, Mus. Nuovo 1448: LIMC2, "Asklepios," no. 172 + pi.; cf. Visconti 1888, 182-183. The likely connection between this statue and the putative sanctuary was rightly recognized by Riethm?ller (Riethm?ller 2005, 2:433) and provides further support for Maiuri's proposal. In addition, a possibly erroneous report published by R de Clarac states that another statue of Asclepius was found in 1811 near the Baths of Titus, which are located on the side of the Baths of Trajan opposite S. Martino, but as he points out, there is reason to believe that the artifact in question was actually cat. no. 36, found elsewhere in Rome (see de Clarac, Musee de sculpture, 4:9, no. 1157 and IGUR 1, p. 84). 71 This was first suggested by D. Degrassi, LTUR, op. cit., 1:22-23 (quoted in n. 78). 72 See Rodriguez-Almeida 1975-1976, 265-275. The foun tain has been tentatively identified as the Lacus Orphei by Rodriguez-Almeida (see also R Coarelli, LTUR, "Lacus Orphei," 3:171), while the nymphaeum just east of S. Martino is unidentified (see LTUR l:fig. 154). For the importance of water in the cult of Asclepius, see p. 97. Moretti tentatively cites this dedication, which is more reasonably assigned to a shrine at or near the Castra Praetoria (see discussion in catalogue), as evidence that the sanctuary existed in the first century A.D. [IGUR 1, p. 84), and his conclusion has been echoed by others (Guarducci 1978, 165; Roesch 1982,177; Cordiano and Gregori 1993,156). D. Degrassi rightly exhibits more caution in treating the dedica tion as evidence for the god's worship on the Esquiline in the first century A.D., without assigning it to this temple (D. Degrassi, LTUR, op. cit, 1:22), while Riethm?ller takes the proper step of linking it to the Castra Praetoria (Riethm?ller 2005,2:433). 74 Though generally employed in reference to new construc tion, aedificare was occasionally used as a term for the recon struction of damaged structures (see TLL 1.4,923-925 [esp. 924], s.v. "aedifico"). It is, nevertheless, an odd term and exemplifies the bad Latinity of this postclassical text. 75 CIL 6:1701b + add. p. 3173: Aurelius\Marinus\v(ir) p(erfectissimus) rat(ionalis)\s(ummae) r(ei). Moretti cites this as evidence that the cult of Asclepius was still flourishing during the Tetrarchic period (see IGUR 1, p. 84), yet it is unclear whether this inscription represents a reuse of the base for a new statue or a rededication of the original statue.</page><page sequence="21">PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE CULT OF ASCLEPIUS AT ROME 107 century later may be attested by the Fasti Furii Filocali of a.D. 354, which record a N(atalis) Asclepi on 11 September that is perhaps better attributed to the Esquiline temple than the Tiber Island, which was originally founded on 1 January and therefore would have had to have been rededicated later for that date to be its dies natalis.76 If so, the Esquiline temple probably would have remained open until the law issued by Theodosius I in a.D. 391 that effectively closed the pagan temples.77 At some point, probably no earlier than the sixth century a.D., the site of the former Asklepieion may have been appropriated by the Church, if the suggestion that today's church of S. Martino occupies the same space is correct.78 The first Christian congregation at the future site of S. Martino was a titulus established at the house of a priest named Equitius by St. Silves ter I, a fourth-century pope famous in Christian legend for ridding Constantine of leprosy and baptizing him (a.D. 314-335), and when Pope Symmachus (a.D. 498-523) replaced the titulus with a more expansive complex, the Basilica SS. Silvestri et Martini, he may have deliberately chosen the site of the defunct Asklepieion situated nearby in order to replace a sanctuary devoted to a pagan healing god with a Christian church consecrated to two saints famous as healers.79 If the former was the case, the statue probably would have represented Marinus (= PLRE 1, "Marinus," 5) rather than Asclepius, since another statue base for this individual was found elsewhere in Rome (see below). Regardless of what sort of statue stood atop this base in late antiquity, though, it is highly likely that the base itself was reinstalled at the sanctu ary after the additional text was added, since if it had been hauled away to be inscribed for reuse at any other site, the odds of its being found in close proximity to another Greek dedication to Asclepius, let alone a sanctuary that the two inscriptions together appear to reveal, would be small. Lanciani, preparing his map of Rome before Maiuri first suggested the existence of a sanctuary of Asclepius in this neighborhood, treated this inscription as an indication of the approximate location of Marinus's house even though the text itself gives no reason for doing so (Lanciani, FUR, pi. 23), and his conclusion has gained acceptance (F. Guidobaldi, LTUR, "Domus: Aurelius Marinus," 2:66). However, since a marble cippus?no doubt a statue base?bearing the same inscription was seen outside the Aurelian Walls in the Orti Giustiniani (CIL 6:1701a + add. p. 3173), it is clear that statues of this prominent individual may have stood at multiple locations in and around Rome, and therefore there is no reason to consider the inscription at S. Martino evidence for Marinus's house. (Three inscriptions from the lararium of a villa of the Volusii Saturnini at Lucus Feroniae that each provide the cursus bonorum for a member of this prominent family are especially pertinent to this issue: one of them records the precise locations in Rome where eight different statues of Lucius Volusius Saturninus were to be erected [AE 1972, 174], while this and the other two inscriptions demonstrate that honorary texts could be inscribed in a domestic setting [AE 1972,175-176].) 76 Fasti Filocali: Inscrlt 13.2, 1, p. 508. For the document's relevance to religious practices in fourth-century A.D. Rome, though not Asclepius's cult in particular, see the important study by Michele Salzman (Salzman 1990; cf. Curran 2000, 222). First proposed by Maiuri, the attribution of the 11 September dies natalis to the Esquiline site has gained ac ceptance (see Maiuri 1912,246-247; cf. D. Degrassi, LTUR, op. cit, 1:23), although Lugli instead linked it to the Tiber Island site (Lugli, Fontes 2:148, no. 30). However, since the Fasti Praenestini, which record the dies natalis of the Tiber Island temple, date to the Augustan period (see Inscrlt 13.2, 1, pp. 141-142), and the Fasti magistrorum vici date to the Augustan period {Inscrlt 13.1, 1, pp. 279, 287), there is a period of more than three centuries between these Fasti and the Fasti Filocali during which a rededication of the temple could have occurred, and thus it is possible, though unprov able, that the god's original temple came to celebrate its dies natalis in September rather than January. (The Fasti Antiates Maiores, which also record the 1 January date for the Tiber Island temple, were composed even earlier, between 84 and 55 b.c.: see Inscrlt 13.2, 1, pp. 1, 28.) 77 On Theodosius's law, see Curran 2000, 215-216. 78 See D.

The same titulus appears to have been called the titulus Equitii and, later, the titulus Silvestri; however, the later source evident in the Liber Pontificalis may have been referring to the titulus after it had been relocated in the large Roman hall just west of S. Martino. Basilica: Lib. Pont. 53.9 (p. 262, ed. Duchesne). The Fragmentum Laurentianum, part of a series of papal biographies related to the Liber Pontificalis that dates to a.d. 514-519, instead refers to a church of St. Martin adjacent to " sanctus Silvester" {Frag. Laur. 52, p. 46, ed. Duchesne, cf. pp. 267-268, n. 35). It is unclear whether this later report is correct in identifying two distinct struc tures and, if so, whether the structure associated with St. Silvester in the early sixth century was the site of the original titulus or, as seems more likely, the Roman hall that survives to the west of S. Martino. For the history of Christian worship</page><page sequence="22">108 GIL H. RENBERG However, it may be wrong to conclude that the basilica was built on ground formerly conse crated to Asclepius, since emperors and church leaders of the fourth through sixth centuries would deliberately avoid appropriating public pagan temples in Rome's urban center for use as churches, preferring to convert secular buildings or build new structures adjacent to pagan temples.80 Therefore, the Asklepieion is more likely to have stood in the neighborhood of S. Mar tino than at the church's precise location; however, regardless of which was the case, it is quite possible that this juxtaposition of sites devoted to pagan and Christian healers was intentional on the part of Pope Symmachus. Via Cassia. The Tiber Island and Esquiline temples represent the two most important cult sites of Asclepius in Rome and are the only sites clearly linked to healing. In addition, the recent publica tion of an inscription from the Via Cassia may reveal another site, one located in Rome's northern suburbs, in the vicinity of the Pons Milvius or else a few miles down the road. If such a site did exist, which depends on the altar having originated in this area rather than in Rome, it would have been visited by those seeking medical assistance from "Paean of the Tiber" and thus served as an alterna tive to the god's more prominent sedes many miles away (cat. no. 29).81 In recording an individual's recovery from tuberculosis, the altar's dedicatory epigram begins with the adverb svxau?a to specify that the recovery had taken place at that very spot: eviocuO' &amp;x??octo Aou7io[v] | ev XuyQOLi cp66r|i I )(?1(jlo)vi nouav ?u?g[icj I [?x]axov rjfxaaiv | ?cojjLOv 6? eSeifiai' I 'Aqqiol nXaiwviKrj | ii[jLc5a' stouqov I y? elA.eoufj.evri 6e6v. Herein Paean of the Tiber cured Lupus of a wretched consumption?in winter, within a hun dred days. Arria the Platonist prepared this altar, honoring her companion and propitiating the god. If this imperial-period altar did originate in Rome's northern suburbs, it suggests that some distance upstream from the Tiber Island Asklepieion there was a sanctuary at which Asclepius's aid could be sought by those who were in need of cures but had opted against visiting the more famous site several miles away. The use of the epithet ?u?cnc; shows the close association of Asclepius with the at this site during late antiquity and the complex problems provided by the conflicting sources, see Christian Basilicas 3:87-124 (esp. 89-90, 121-124); cf. S. Serra, LTUR, "SS. Silvester et Equitius, titulus," 4:325-328 and Curran 2000, 118. On the Christianization of this region of the Esquiline in general, see Reekmans 1989, 886-891. St. Martin's reputation as a miracle-healer is already evident in the Vita Martini, Sulpicius Severus's late fourth century biography of him (see Rousselle 1990, 109-122 et passim). The legend of Silvester curing Constantine first appears in the romanticized fifth-century Acta S. Sylvestri and thus predates Symmachus's construction of the basilica (see Kelly, Popes, 27-28, s.v. "Silvester I, St"; cf. Lib. Pont. 34.2, p. 170, ed. Duchesne). This and other sites in Rome devoted to St. Silvester and their possible links to earlier pagan worship are discussed by R. E. A. Palmer, who, like Serra, does not note the potential link between the location of this saint's church on the Esquiline and the sanctuary of Asclepius (Palmer 1978,228-230). For the phenomenon of Christian healing shrines in the East being built atop earlier pagan sites that had served worshipers similarly, see n. 36. 80 See Salzman 1999, 127-134. The first public temple con verted into a church was the Pantheon, which became the church of S. Maria dei Martiri in a.D. 609, although several basilicas had been built atop or near Mithraea, which were private sites, beginning in the fifth century (p. 129). Even after a.D. 609 such conversions appear to have been infrequent. 81 The existence of a sanctuary near the Via Cassia, based on the assumption that the altar originated at or near where it was unearthed, was proposed by Cordiano (Cordiano and Gregori 1993,156). The appellation "Paean" was commonly applied to both Apollo and Asclepius, but there should be no doubt that in this inscription, as in three others from Rome (cat. nos. 8, 38, 39), it represented Asclepius.</page><page sequence="23">PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE CULT OF ASCLEPIUS AT ROME 109 river that flowed past his original sanctuary in Rome as well as this unidentified sanctuary, probably built somewhere along the Tiber's banks in the neighborhood of the Pons Milvius.82 Lesser Shrines Three to five other sites, located just outside the city walls at the northern, southern, and southwest ern boundaries of the city, can be established on the strength of epigraphical evidence alone, but none of these can be identified as a healing shrine with any certainty. Instead, the inscriptions from these sites reveal Asclepius's involvement in other areas of his worshipers' lives. Three of these sites, one of which was in an unknown location, belonged to private collegia, but it is unclear whether the other site was a neighborhood shrine or even a public sanctuary of which no record remains. The latter site, located at a spring later named for Hygieia near the Porta Flaminia, may well have been a healing shrine, but there is no reason to conclude that the other two were. A fifth minor shrine within the city can be assigned much more tentatively to the area between the southern slopes of the Caelian and the Baths of Caracalla, based on the evidence of a single inscription. If this site did exist, there likewise is no reason to conclude that it was a healing shrine. Funerary Collegia. The best documented of these lesser shrines is an aedicula that apparently was erected either at the schola of the Collegium Aesculapi et Hygiae or at the burial site of a member of this funerary association by his widow in a.d. 153 as part of a donation she made to the group. Although this shrine and the accompanying structures and statue of Asclepius are widely, and with good reason, held to be from the association's schola, it is at least worth considering the alternative, since the activities described by the lengthy decretum recording the donation might suggest instead that a site for banqueting was established on the Via Appia by this widow in the immediate vicinity of the tomb of the imperial procurator under whom her husband had served, where her husband's own remains also appear to have been interred (cat. no. 11, lines 1-4): Lex collegi Aesculapi et Hygiae:\Salvia C(ai) /(ilia) Marcellina ob memoriam Fl(avi) Apolloni proc(uratoris) Aug(usti) quifuit a pinacothecis et Capitonis Aug(usti) l(iberti) adiutorisleius mariti sui optimipiisimi donum dedit collegio Aesculapi et Hygiae locum aediculae cum pergula et signum marmoreum Aesculapi et solarium tectum iunctum in\quo populus collegis(upra) s(cripti) epuletur, quod est via Appia ad (aedem) Martis intra milliarium I et II ab urbe euntibus parte laeva inter adfines Vibium Calocaerum et populumP Resolution of the Association of Asclepius and Hygieia: Salvia Marcellina, daughter of Gaius, in memory of Flavius Apollonius, imperial procurator, who was in charge of the (imperial) picture galleries, and of his assistant the imperial freedman Capito, her excellent and most devoted husband, gave as a gift to the Association of Asclepius and Hygieia a site for a shrine with a pergola, a marble statue of Asclepius, and an adjoining roofed solarium in which the 82 In his initial publication of this dedication, Cordiano concluded that IIou&amp;v ?u?^ig was a syncretism of Asclepius and the river-god Tiberinus (Cordiano and Gregori 1993, 154-155), but Kent Rigsby persuasively argues that the unique name "Paean of the Tiber" is a poetic creation, not a theological one (Rigsby 2001, 107). 83 On this collegium, see P.

While it is possible that the statue and structures were placed at a tomb belonging to her husband Capito, the fact that the donation is made in the memory of Flavius Apollonius as well as Capito suggests that the latter's resting place was overshadowed by that of the former.

RENBERG membership of the aforementioned association may dine, on the Via Appia beside the Temple of Mars between the first and second milestones, on the left side for those departing from the city, between the neighboring (tomb of) Vibius Calocaerus and public land (?).84 This gift, of which no traces remain, was situated on locus privatus more than a mile beyond the Porta Capena, and thus well beyond the Servian Walls; when the city was enlarged more than a century later, the Porta Appia was built just before the sanctuary of Mars and these neighboring structures, leaving them outside the Aurelian Walls as well.85 According to this inscription, Salvia Marcellina's donation consisted of an aedicula, a pergola, a marble statue of Asclepius, and an adjoining roofed solarium used for communal banquets, which would have commemorated the deceased.86 Funer ary associations, like professional and religious associations, each had a patron divinity, so the link between this collegium and Asclepius and Hygieia is not particularly noteworthy and certainly does not indicate an emphasis on medicine or healing.87 This is equally true of another collegium associated with these two divinities that might also have met periodically in the area of the Via Appia during the second century A.D. This professional association of imperial masons, formally named the Collegium Aesculapi et Hygiae Structorum Caesaris nostri, is known from a single inscription that was found being reused as building material in the Catacombs of Praetextatus on the Via Appia, and, since it records funerary arrangements for some of the group's members, it indicates that their burial site?though not necessarily their schola?was located not too far away.88 As was possibly the case with the first collegium, this one might have had a shrine to Asclepius and Hygieia present at the site where its members were in terred, but this would not have been a proper cult site, let alone one linked to healing. Therefore, the two dedicatory inscriptions by active and retired military personnel, respectively, that might have originated in the area of the Via Appia cannot be assigned to either site (cat. nos. 12, 13).89 Likewise, a broken relief linked to the Athenian Asklepieion but found on the Via Appia cannot be 84 The precise nature of this "public land" is uncertain. Instead of this traditional reading, it is worth considering that since streets and neighborhoods were sometimes named after trees that had served as landmarks?see, e.g., Mart. Ep. 1.117.6 (adPirum), Suet. Dom. 1.1 {adMalum Punicum), and Zappata 1996, 90-96, nos. 1-2 (adSalicem)?populum here could refer to a well-known poplar tree that stood, or had stood, in this area. Trees also, it should be noted, sometimes served as boundary markers (see D?ke 1971, 98, 103). 85 Excavations in the area of the Porta Appia (today's Porta S. Sebastiano) have revealed a monumental structure that may have been part of the sanctuary complex (see Cecchini, Pagliardi, and Petrassi 1986, 600). In its immediate vicinity were found tombs dating to the first century B.c. through the second century A.D., showing that this area was indeed partly devoted to funerary practices. 86 For the relevance of this inscription to collegial banquets, see Tchernia 1982; cf. Scheid 1985,195. 87 Collegia were occasionally named for gods, reflecting a special relationship between these groups and their divine patrons (see Waltzing 1895-1900, 4:431^132). On the reli gious aspects of collegia in general, see Waltzing 1895-1900, 1:195-255 (esp. 195-208, on their patron gods). 88 Josi 1936, 211: D(is) M(anibus)\fecit Ulpia Cyne\gis, im munis, et\donavit Collegio\Aesculapi et Hygiae\structorum Caes(aris) n(ostri), \exceptis ollis XII et\sarcophagis duobus\quos sibi reservavit\et suis ("To the Manes: Ulpia Cynegis, immunis, prepared this and donated it to the Association of Asclepius and Hygieia of the Imperial Masons, setting aside twelve urns and two sarcophagi which she reserved for herself and her household"). Tassini has proposed a date of the Trajanic period based on the nomen "Ulpia," and this period or the years following would appear to be the most likely (Tassini 1995-1996, 60). 89 Since, unlike burial sites, the shrines at funerary associa tions' scholae did receive dedications to their patron gods, it would be possible for one or both of these dedications to have originated at the schola of one of these collegia, one or both of which were on the Via Appia. This, however, is unlikely, not only because the dedications in question were by military personnel rather than imperial freedmen, but also because dedications from scholae tend to refer to the collegium in some manner. (For a partial list of dedications by collegia or their individual members, see Waltzing 1895-1900, 4:457^83. It is unclear whether the dedications from col legial shrines that are silent on the matter were likewise communal rather than personal.)</page><page sequence="25">PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE CULT OF ASCLEPIUS AT ROME 111 assigned to a particular site but further attests the presence of the cult of Asclepius in this extramural part of Rome.90 It appears, therefore, that near the Porta Appia there was at least one minor shrine of Asclepius that served a funerary association, but despite the presence of other evidence for the god's worship there is no sign of a proper cult site in the vicinity. Another funerary association, which met in the area of the imperial Praedia Galbana district east of the Emporium, erected a schola that its members dedicated to Asclepius and Salus on land granted by Hadrian's procurator patrimonii Caesaris (cat. no. 14).91 The dedicatory plaque lists fifty-nine members of this collegium salutare, many of them imperial freedmen and slaves, as well as others who worked in the Praedia Galbana. It is likely that this association had a relationship with Asclepius and Salus similar to that of the Collegium Aesculapi et Hygiae even though the two gods are not specifically identified as the group's patrons. Regardless of whether they were official patrons, the chief purpose of this dedication was to promote not the health of the association's members but rather the well-being of the imperial household. This is indicated not only by the fact that it was dedicated on behalf of the numen domus Augustae/Augusti but also by either the ap plication of the epithet Augusta to the goddess Salus or her identification as Salus Augusti, linking her implicitly or explicitly to the emperor's health.92 The "Caeliolus" A much more complex problem is presented by two dedications, both bases, that appear to come from the area of the modern Parco Egerio, situated between the Baths of Caracalla and Aurelian Wall, to the east of the Via Druso (cat. nos. 15,16). Since the editors of CIL assigned one to the "Celiolo" and the other to the "Caeliolus," they have been interpreted as evidence for another cult site of Asclepius on the Caeliolus.93 In antiquity, the term "Caeliolus" was sometimes applied to an unspecified ridge of the Caelian, but by the nineteenth century the area labeled by modern Romans as the "Celiolo" was an eminence south of the Caelian, as is indicated by Lanciani's map.94 The dedication assigned to the "Celiolo," addressed to both Asclepius and Hygieia, is reported to have been found, though not necessarily in situ, just inside the Porta Metronia at the base of the Caelian, at a spot that has been precisely identified. The other dedication, addressed solely to Asclepius, is supposed to have been seen first during the early eighteenth century on the "Caeliolus," but it is unclear whether Franciscus Ficoronius, who recorded it, had in mind the "Celiolo" or else part of the Caelian. Therefore, one dedication can be assigned to the area of the Parco Egerio with greater certainty than the other, but both appear to have been discovered some distance away from the Tiber Island, raising the possibility that there was a cult site of Asclepius on or below the Caelian. If there was indeed such a site in the Parco Egerio, it should not be assumed that it was a healing See below, p. 120. 91 On this collegium, see Waltzing 1895-1900,3:313-314, no. 1332 and Bollmann 1998,269-270, no. A21; cf. Kolb 1995, 201-203 and Riethm?ller 2005, 2:434, no. 596. 92 On the association of Salus Augusta and Salus Augusti with the emperor Augustus and his successors, see Marwood 1988, 9-10, 148-150, et passim, and see p. 24 for the Hadrianic coinage portraying Salus, including Salus Augusti (BMCRE 3:418, no. 1215 and 440, no. 1348 + pi. 83, 3). Beginning with Augustus, the epithet Augustus/Augusta was commonly applied to divinities who looked out for the well-being of the Roman state as well as the emperor (see Lott 1995). 93 The Caeliolus was first identified as a potential loca tion of a cult site of Asclepius by Lugli?who termed it a donarium?on the strength of these two inscriptions (Lugli, Fontes 3:83, nos. 1-2), and this has gained some acceptance (see L. Chioffi, LTUR, "Aesculapius et Hygia," 1:23 and Riethm?ller 2005,2:435, no. 590). A lone note of caution is expressed by G. Giannelli, who is hesitant to assign the two inscriptions to such a site (G. Giannelli, LTUR, "Caelius mons [in eta classical," 1:209). 94 See Lanciani, FUR, pi. 42. For the current state of the ques tion regarding the location of the Caeliolus, see E.

The presence of the nearby Marana brook as well as numerous springs might suggest that this was the case, since water sources were important features of Asklepieia, but the inscriptions themselves provide no support for this possibility. One of them, ambiguously worded, was commis sioned by two parents on behalf of a female dependent [pro Septimia Martina alumna) but betrays no indication that it was prompted by a specific health crisis (cat. no. 16). While they may have been thanking the god for benevolence he had already exhibited toward the girl, their dedication appears to have been precautionary, seeking the god's favor so that no harm or ill health would befall Martina. The other dedication is altogether unrelated to Asclepius's medical practice and instead reveals that his benevolence could extend beyond health concerns, to the commercial prosperity of worshipers.95 Many gods who, unlike Mercury/Hermes, were not primarily associated with com merce were nevertheless worshiped at Roman workplace shrines, and this appears to explain why Asclepius and Hygieia received the gift of "two metal tapers in the form of a satyr and Antiope" (ceriolaria duo Saturi et Antio&lt;p&gt;es) from two individuals, presumably husband and wife, whose livelihood evidently was the bean trade (cat. no. 15).96 The dedication states that it was erected "with the permission of those from the bean-selling establishment" {ex permissu eorum negotiations fabariae) and thanks the two gods for their "divine power" and "miraculous deeds" (gratias agent es numini et aratis eorum). The circumstances alluded to by the dedicants are unclear and need not have been health-related.97 It has been suggested that they were thanking these gods for the success of a bean-selling business situated in or adjacent to the Tiber Island Asklepieion, but if that were the case, it would have made sense for them to erect the dedication at the sanctuary where they worked. This dedication, however, appears to come from a workplace shrine in a different part of the city?a site that may or may not have been devoted to Asclepius and Hygieia.98 If this dedication did, in fact, originate at a workplace shrine in the Parco Egerio, it would reveal the presence of a commercial zone there. There has been speculation that the group approving this 95 A perhaps comparable situation may be revealed in the dedication to Asclepius by individuals grateful to him "for their improved lot" (ob Processus suos) (cat. no. 18; see p. 114). See also the dedicatory relief that may reveal a link between Asclepius and a guild of bakers (cat. no. 30). 96 For an excellent study of the gods worshiped at workplace shrines in Ostia, see Bakker 1994; for dedications specifically from horrea, including those at Rome, see Rickman 1971, 312-315. 97 While the term dgeiiq could indeed be used for healing miracles (see cat. no. 6, line 5; cf. ICret l:xvii, 19, line 10), it also appears in several inscriptions that do not pertain?or cannot be linked?to them (e.g., IG 11.4,1299, line 91; ICret 3:iv, 15; IKyzikos 2:4). 98 Guarducci concluded that this dedication was made in order to thank Asclepius and Hygieia both for granting these two devotees permission to sell beans at the Tiber Island sanctuary and for the subsequent success of their business (Guarducci 1971,278; cf. Latte 1967,227-228, n. 5). While the second part of this conclusion may be accurate, she is probably wrong to interpret the phrase ex permissu eorum as recording permission obtained from Asclepius and Hygieia (see discussion in catalogue). L. Chioffi, like Guarducci, also places this private business at the Asklepieion, citing the par allel of an epitaph for a scaphiaria who sold her vessels at an otherwise unrecorded sanctuary of Bellona on the island (AE 1971,40; seeL. Chioffi, LTUR, "BellonaInsulensis," 1:193). But this is an unconvincing parallel, since the existence of merchants on the Tiber Island in general, and the fact that this woman sold oxacpioc there in particular is not a reason to conclude that these two bean sellers must have worked there, too. Tassini, who agrees with the link between the dedi cants and the Tiber Island sanctuary, has rather ingeniously proposed that these two individuals perhaps had to receive special permission to make a dedication at the site because they may have been stigmatized for selling beans, which were considered impure by Pythagoreans and in certain other cults, and were in fact specifically mentioned in a lex sacra from a temple of Asclepius in Thuburbo Maius dictating that, "Whoever wishes to ascend the platform must keep from women, pork, beans, barbers and the public baths for a three-day period; it is not permitted to enter the enclosed area shod" (Quisq(uis) intra\podium ad\scendere vo\let a muli\ere, a suilla,\a faba, a ton\sore, a balAneo commu\ne custodi\at triduo;\cancellos\calciatus\intrare noUito) {ILAfr 225, lines 7-20; see Tassini 1995-1996, 45-46, whose interpretation was partly anticipated by Kleijwegt 1994, 213, n. 43). Such a possibility, however, depends on the permissus having been obtained from the cult of Asclepius, which, as noted above, seems the less likely reading of the inscription.</page><page sequence="27">PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE CULT OF ASCLEPIUS AT ROME 113 dedication operated in the "Porticus Fabarius" that the Regionary Catalogues assigned to Regio XIII, which included the Aventine and Emporium district;99 more recently, this establishment has been identified with the one referred to as the Porticus Fabarum in a graffito epitaph from the Catacombs of Domitilla stating that "Victoria from the Bean Portico was laid to rest" (De[posit]a Bictora deporticu fabaru(m)).m But if the group of "those from the bean-selling establishment" was located in Regio XIII, the dedication would have had to originate roughly a mile from where it was dug up. Therefore, another conclusion appears to be in order: these sources refer to two different establishments. The Regionary Catalogues place the Porticus Fabarius in Regio XIII, but the Cata combs of Domitilla, located on the Via Appia just over a mile from the Parco Egerio, are closer to this dedication's find spot in Regio I, which suggests that perhaps the Porticus Fabarum, overlooked by the Regionary Catalogues or no longer extant when they were compiled, stood somewhere nearby. Warehouses and commercial districts were scattered throughout Rome instead of being concentrated entirely in the area along the Tiber wharves, and it is quite possible for there to have been a modest center of commerce in Regio I, especially since the Via Appia and other major roads entering Rome from the countryside?roads bringing produce into the city?ran near the site where the inscrip tion was discovered.101 Indeed, the point where the Via Appia and Via Latina converged and the Baths of Caracalla stood was as promising a location as could be found for commerce at Rome's southernmost point. So, just as the Via Ostiensis featured a mixture of tombs and commercial sites, this area, known for its tombs, may also have featured structures dedicated to commerce.102 But it is also possible, since the dedication may have originated atop the Caelian and only descended to its find spot in later years, that the Porticus Fabarum may be better situated in Regio II, a part of Rome in which commercial structures were more plentiful than Regio I. Therefore, it is impossible to draw any conclusions regarding the location of such an establishment.103 And yet the existence of the Porticus Fabarius in Regio XIII and possible existence of a Porticus Fabarum in Regio I or II may be completely irrelevant to the provenience of this dedication: the bean industry at Rome was not limited to just one or two locations devoted primarily to this commod ity, so the group that authorized the dedication to Asclepius and Hygieia could have operated at a 99 Valentini and Zucchetti, Codice Topografico 1:143 [Curio sum), 181 (Notitia). See Lanciani, StSc6:88 and Loane 1938, 120, n. 27. Loane also cites a now discredited emendation of the Fasti Ostienses that purportedly referred to produce sellers (olitores) at the base of the Aventine near the Circus Maximus, but this word was later identified as basket weav ers (vitores) by Edwin Flinck (Flinck 1926, 86-88), and this reading has been verified by subsequent editors (CIL 14:4535, line 3; Vidman, Fasti Ostienses, frag. Ch, line 4.) Although "Porticus Fabaria" would be expected?and, indeed, Loane prefers this name to "Porticus Fabarius"?it is possible that the compilers of these late antique documents opted for the rare masculine form of porticus (see TLL 10.2:24-25, s.v. "porticus"). 100 AE 1958,272. In publishing the graffito, A. Ferrua noted that a Porticus Fabaria in Regio XIII was already known but did not specifically state that he believed it to be the same as the Porticus Fabarum (Ferrua 1956, 608); this, however, appears to have become an accepted conclusion (see M. Macciocca, LTUR, "Porticus Fabarum," 4:122). On the distribution of warehouses and markets in Rome, see Loane 1938, 113-121 and Rickman 1971, 87-122; cf. Richardson, NTDAR, "Horreum, Cella, Portus," 191-192. For the data found in the Regionary Catalogues regarding the distribution of horrea in Rome's fourteen Augustan regions, see Rickman 1971, 323-325. 102 For the limited evidence of commerce in the general area of the Baths of Caracalla, see Avetta, Via Imperiale, 252-253. 103 Support for concluding that a Porticus Fabarum once stood either on or below the Caelian is to be found in a situation possibly comparable to that of "Victoria from the Bean Portico": another graffito epitaph, this one from the Catacombs of Praetextatus, records the burial of "Domitius Taurus Pernarus, from the street by the Market" {Domitius Taurus Pernarus de platia Macelli), who evidently once worked at the Macellum Magnum built by Nero on the Cae lian and was buried in the same general area as Victoria (AE 1958, 271; cf. Ferrua 1956, 608-609; on the Macellum, see G. Pisani Sartorio, LTUR, "Macellum Magnum," 3:204-206). Quite possibly, both of them lived and worked up the Via Appia from where they were interred.</page><page sequence="28">114 GIL H. RENBERG horreum or some other type of establishment in or near the Parco Egerio or atop the Caelian?and not necessarily one for which we have a record. Regardless of where "those from the bean-selling establishment" exercised their authority, however, it is rather doubtful that the dedication on behalf of Septimia Martina originated at the same site. While it is certainly possible that it was erected at a neighborhood sanctuary or shrine of Asclepius in the area of the Parco Egerio, it must be remem bered that cult sites were inclusive in terms of the worship of other divinities, and thus a dedication to Asclepius need not have originated at one of his own cult sites. Overall, therefore, it is possible that neither dedication found in this part of Rome originated at a cult site of Asclepius?and, even if such a site did exist, it would only have produced the dedication for Septimia Martina, while the other would have been erected at a workplace shrine or guild headquarters. 'Tons aquae perennis Hygiae." Only one of the extramural locations at which Asclepius was wor shiped seems reasonably likely to have been devoted to the god's medical powers in some manner. Located near a spring outside and to the east of the Porta Flaminia in what was later the vineyard of the Duke of Melfi, this site has produced three dedications to Asclepius that were found and recorded during the Renaissance:104 an altar dedicated by a man and woman whose relationship is unknown but who were probably fellow freedmen (cat. no. 17), a statue base or altar vowed by an imperial freedman and his family "for their improved lot" {ob Processus suos) (cat. no. 18),105 and an inscribed plaque from the dedication of a husband and wife thanking the god for an unspecified exhibition of his power {gratias agentes numini tuo) (cat. no. 19).106 In addition, it may be possible to assign to this shrine another dedication first recorded in the nearby Orti Giustiniani, though a Praetorian shrine on the Esquiline is the likelier point of origin (cat. no. 20). The spring was labeled fons aquae perennis Hygiae by the Renaissance antiquarian Martinus Smetius, but the origin of this tradition is unknown?perhaps a statue of the goddess was found there??and no ancient source links Hygieia to the site. Although there is no clear indication that this site functioned as a heal ing shrine, its location near a spring suggests that this cult site of Asclepius may have emphasized the god's curative powers;107 and, if the site was a healing shrine, it is likely that Asclepius would have been joined there by Hygieia, whose association with the site was somehow recalled fifteen hundred years later. Cult Sites Not Devoted to Asclepius In addition to being worshiped at his own temples and shrines, Asclepius, like any other god, could receive offerings and dedications at the sanctuaries of other divinities. While it is unclear whether 104 The site is discussed by Cordiano (Cordiano and Gregori 1993,156) and more briefly by G. Messineo, who mistakenly identifies all three dedications as altars (Messineo 1991,9, n. 4). Riethm?ller confuses the Porta Flaminia with the Porta Flumentana and therefore suggests that these three inscrip tions originated at the same site as the dedication from the schola of the Collegium fab rum tignariorum (cat. no. 23; Riethm?ller 2005, 2:433, no. 592). 105 The precise meaning of Processus in this context is unclear, but it appears to pertain to an improvement in the dedicants' lives unrelated to health, such as increased prosperity (see ILL 10.2, 1523-1527 (esp. col. 1524), s.v. "processus"; cf. Latte 1967, 227, n. 5 and Guarducci 1971, 278, n. 50). 106 The phrase gratias agentes numini tuo need not have alluded to Asclepiuss medical intervention since this and similar phrases appear in dedications to other gods. The formula gratias agens was used throughout Thrace and the eastern Latin-speaking provinces (see Le Glay 1995, 265), whereas this dedication and the one by the bean sellers (cat. no. 15) represent its only occurrence in Rome. For the pos sibility that this site was frequented by natives of the north Adriatic regions, see p. 123. 107 On the importance of sources of fresh water at Asclepiuss healing sanctuaries, see p. 97.</page><page sequence="29">PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE CULT OF ASCLEPIUS AT ROME 115 the dedication by the bean sellers came from a workplace shrine of a god other than Asclepius, this appears to have been the case at the horrea Seiana in the Emporium district, where a statue of Asclepius was dedicated to its genius, presumably at a workplace shrine of that divinity (cat. no. 21), and another inscription records that Asclepius's statue was consecrated to Silvanus at an un known aedes of that god, along with statues of Silvanus himself, Jupiter, Vulcan, Apollo, and Diana (cat. no. 22).108 There is also good reason to conclude that a relief of Asclepius and Hygieia that is of unknown provenience originated at the headquarters of a corpus pistorum (cat. no. 30). Seven kilometers down the Via Appia, Asclepius again shared the company of several gods: at the Villa dei Quintilii, situated between the Via Appia Nuova and Via Appia Antica, an acephalous statuette of Asclepius and a smaller statuette were discovered among the remains of a sacellum?apparently, of Zeus Bronton?along with statues of Hygieia, Jupiter, Hercules, the Dioskouroi, Artemis Ephesia, and the eastern gods Zeus Bronton, Mithras, Astarte, Atargatis, and Neotera.109 Literary evidence, too, reveals that Asclepius was honored at other divinities' cult sites: according to Pliny the Elder, a statue of Asclepius by Praxiteles's son Kephisodotos stood in the Temple of Juno Regina in the Porticus Octaviae, while statues of Asclepius and Hygieia by Nikeratos stood in the Temple of Concord in the Forum Romanum.110 Just as places of commerce like the horrea Seiana and aforementioned bean-industry establish ment as well as the meeting places of funerary associations like the Collegium Aesculapi et Hygiae featured shrines, the headquarters of professional collegia also included shrines that could receive dedications made on behalf of the association.111 In Rome, Asclepius was among the gods so honored, as is demonstrated by the erection of a statue of Asclepius Conservator Augustorum at the headquar ters of the Collegium fabrum tignariorum, a major professional guild with no overt connection to the cult of Asclepius, by one of its members (cat. no. 23).112 Since both this professional association and the funerary association based at the imperial estates known as the Praedia Galbana saw fit to make dedications to Asclepius on behalf of the emperors, it is likely that other such groups did so as well. And in light of this phenomenon, it seems a virtual certainty that Asclepius, the patron of physicians, was regularly honored by the guild whose members met in the schola medicorum that is referred to in one inscription.113 Cult Sites at Military Complexes A significant number of Asclepius's worshipers in Rome appear to have been associated with the military, and in several cases it appears that their dedications came not from public temples but 108 Indirect evidence might point to the Circus Flaminius as the location of this aedes (see discussion in catalogue). 109 See Annibaldi 1935, 81, nos. 5-6 + fig. 5 (= LIMC 2, "Asklepios," no. 305). On this site and the other statues, see Annibaldi 1935 and Paris 2000. For the inscriptions from the site, see IGUR 1:136-139 and AE 1935, 130-131. Despite the fact that these statuettes were excavated at a cult site some distance from the Porta Appia, Riethm?ller inexplicably associates them with the meeting place of the Collegium Aesculapi et Hygiae (Riethm?ller 2005,2:434; on the Collegium, see pp. 109-110). 110 Temple of Juno Regina: Plin.

RENBERG from shrines situated in some of the city's military camps and stations.114 Active and retired military personnel, especially members of the Praetorian Guard, constitute the largest identifiable group among those who commissioned inscribed dedications for Asclepius in Rome, and while four such dedications cannot be linked with certainty to a known site (cat. nos. 12, 13, 20, 32), four others appear to come either from the Castra Praetoria itself or the adjacent area between the camp and Servian Wall known as the Campus Cohortium Praetoriarum (cat. nos. 24,25,26,27), and another comes from a site in Trastevere, perhaps the Castra Ravennatium (cat. no. 28). Two of the dedica tions of unknown provenience were commissioned by Praetorians and perhaps originated at one of their shrines on the Esquiline. One of these, by a pair of individuals who had fulfilled their tours of duty and were discharging their vows to Asclepius, was first seen at the Orti Giustiniani and could easily have originated in or near the Castra Praetoria half a mile away (cat. no. 20). The other dedication cannot be assigned to the Praetorians' camp with any certainty because the dedicant was a veteran when he commissioned it, and, moreover, conflicting antiquarian sources make it impossible to determine in which part of Rome the inscription originated (cat. no. 13). The other two unprovenienced dedications were by personnel from other military services: one, a dedication to Asclepius and Hygieia by a decurion of the equites singulares, was found outside the Porta Appia, but the attempts to link it to known sites on the Via Appia or east of Rome are purely speculative (cat. no. 12);115 the other, dedicated to Asclepius for the well-being of the emperors by a soldier from the eleventh urban cohort, does not have a recorded find spot (cat. no. 32). Castra Praetoria and Campus Cohortium Praetoriarum. Although four dedications and a statuette can be assigned to the general vicinity of the Castra Praetoria, it is unclear whether any of them came from the camp itself rather than nearby temples or shrines.116 Like so much concerning the topography of the part of the Esquiline dominated by the Praetorians, the full distribution of cult sites frequented by them is unknown.117 Only two communal shrines have been identified by name: the templum Martis Castrorum Praetoriorum, which is mentioned in the funerary inscription of one of its priests and possibly represented on a Claudian coin celebrating his accession to power with the support of the Praetorians, and the shrine of the standards.118 Another inscription, found at the 114 In addition to the dedicatory inscriptions by military personnel, one of the four miraculously healed individuals named in the testimonial inscription attributed to the Tiber Island Asklepieion was a soldier (cat. no. 6, lines 15-18; see pp. 123, 127). No study of Asclepius and military religion has been undertaken, but see Edelstein, Asclepius 2:253, n. 10 for some scattered references (now dated), and also R. W. Davies's discussions of several dedications to Asclepius linked to medici'm the Roman army (Davies 1969 and Davies 1972; cf. Marwood 1988, 71-73). For additional references to legionary dedications to Asclepius from northern Britan nia and Moesia Inferior, see R. Gordon, Journal of Roman Studies 93 (2003) 260.

In addition to the epigraphical evidence for the worship of Asclepius in the Praetorians' neighborhood, a statuette of Asclepius that was found on the Via Marghera, a modern stretch running from the southwest corner of the Castra Praetoria, may well have originated at a military shrine (Rome, Mus. Nuovo 2267: LIMC 2, "Asklepios," no. 297 + pi.), as is true of an acephalous statuette from the area of the Maccao dei PP. Gesuiti, just west of the encampment (Rome, Mus. Naz. Rom. 320: Mus. Naz. Rom., Sculture 1.2, no. 31), both of which might further demonstrate the importance of Asclepius to those serving in the Praetorian Guard. 117 On the difficulties of determining the religious topography of the Praetorian zone, see Durry 1938, 307-308. 118 Templum Martis: ILS 2090; Cohen, Medailles imperiales 1, "Claudius," 254, nos. 40-46 (= BMCRE 1:165, no. 5 + pi. 31, 4 = RIC 1, "Claudius," nos. 22-25 + pi.

Most notably, the remains of a temple were found beneath the Via Gaeta between the Via Castelfidardo and Via Goito, while a smaller aedicula was unearthed less than a block away, at the corner of the Via Goito and Via Montebello.120 Furthermore, dedications by Praetorians for a range of gods?for example, the genius centuriae, Jupiter Optimus Maximus, Jupiter Dolichenus, Fortuna, Mithras?have been found in the area, suggesting that many more shrines once stood in the Castra and its immediate vicinity.121 While no cult site of Asclepius is known, it is nevertheless possible that the god of health was venerated at his own shrine or temple; but if no such site existed, those wishing to make dedications or offerings to him could have done so at the shrines of other gods, so the presence of dedications to Asclepius in the Praetorians' neighborhood does not prove the existence of a site dedicated to Asclepius.122 Two dedications to Asclepius are generally attributed to the Castra Praetoria because they were found in its immediate vicinity: an unidentified dedication from A.D. 82 by a doctor of the fifth cohort addressed to Asclepius (cat. no. 24) and an altar for Asclepius Sindrinus by natives of the Philippopolitan region of Thrace who were serving in the Praetorian Guard in A.D. 241 (cat. no. 26).123 However, neither can be assigned to the camp itself with any certainty: the dedication by the medicus cohortis was first seen at the Horti Maecenatis, which might place it at the southern fringes of the Campus Cohortium Praetoriarum,124 while the dedication for Asclepius Sindrinus was found in two pieces that were each several hundred yards from the Castra Praetoria, one having been reused at a church on the west side of the Baths of Diocletian and the other having turned up to the east of the Baths in the immediate area of the two cult sites on the Via Goito. The former dedication, having been erected by a medicus for the well-being of his cohort, may have come not from a temple but from a shrine located in the valetudinarium he oversaw.125 Two other dedications should also be recognized as having originated in or near the Castra Praetoria. One of these, an altar for Jupiter, Asclepius, and Hygieia dedicated by an individual who had recently been discharged from military service, was first seen at the Baths of Diocletian or the nearby Porta Salaria and thus almost certainly is from one of the Praetorians' cult sites, most likely one consecrated to Jupiter (cat. no. 27). The other inscription, a large tablet to Asclepius Zimidrenus dating to A.D. 227 (cat. standard (see Durry 1938,321-323). Shrine of the standards: Hdn. 4.4.5, cf. 5.8.5 (see Durry 1938, 309-310). 119 CIL 6:215, cf. 30717. See Durry 1938,314 et passim.

Aedicula: CAR 3 G, no. 7 (site of CIL 6:32524 + add. p. 3832,32622a-k, 32623,32624,37184). The two sites are shown in Lanciani, FUR, pi. 10. For structures of a nonreligious nature in this area, see E. Lissi Caronna, LTUR, op. cit., 1:254. 121 For references, see E. Lissi Caronna, LTUR, op. cit., 1:252; the texts are collected by Lugli, Fontes 4:252-256, nos. 327-345. 122 Cordiano, citing some of the Praetorians' dedications to Asclepius, has suggested the existence of an aedicula of Asclepius at the Castra Praetoria (Cordiano and Gregori 1993, 160, n. 32). Riethm?ller reasonably suggests the presence of a valetudinarium at the camp but omits cat. no. 25 from his study altogether while wrongly treating cat. no. 26 as if it would have come from the same site as cat. no. 24, which is the only inscription likely to have originated at such a structure (Riethm?ller 2005,2:433, no. 591). 123 For the inclusion of these two among dedications from the Castra Praetoria, see, e.g., E. Lissi Caronna, LTUR, op. cit., 1:254 and Lugli, Fontes 4:252, nos. 325-326. 124 Uncertainty over where this dedication was first seen has led some to conclude that it originated not at a Praetorian site but at Asclepius's Esquiline sanctuary (see p. 106). 125 On valetudinaria, see Wilmanns 1995, 103-116 and Valenti 1998, 89-102.</page><page sequence="32">118 GIL H. RENBERG no. 25), undoubtedly originated at the same site as the dedication to Asclepius Sindrinus made in A.D. 241, and not the area where it was found being reused. This Thracian god, whose name suggests a toponym for an unknown site or else some association with a regional hero, is known to have been worshiped at a sanctuary near modern Batkun (Bulgaria), 45 kilometers west of Philippopolis, where, as at Rome, his epithet was subject to spelling variations.126 The problem of the location of the cult site at which Asclepius Zimidrenus/Sindrinus was worshiped in Rome is part of a larger problem, since the tablet for Asclepius Zimidrenus (cat. no. 25) was one of many dedications commissioned by Thracian members of the Praetorian Guard for their native divinities, and these could have originated either at a single sanctuary frequented primarily by Thra cians or, as seems more likely, a number of cult sites in the Campus Cohortium Praetoriarum.127 Quite possibly, one of these sites was devoted to Asclepius Zimidrenus/Sindrinus, especially since the later dedication was commissioned by a priest (cat. no. 26). It may well be that this Asclepius, worshiped by natives of Thrace, was in some way considered distinct from the Asclepius worshiped elsewhere in Rome and thus would not have been worshiped at the same shrine, but this is far from certain. Therefore, while it is possible that the four Praetorian dedications addressed to Asclepius originated at a single site, it is more likely that they originated at two or more sites and that Asclepius Zimidrenus was worshiped at a cult site established by and for the Thracians serving in the Praetorian Guard long after the medicus cohortis had erected his dedication in A.D. 82 and decades after the establishment of the cult site at which the altar for Jupiter, Asclepius, and Hygieia was dedicated. Castra Ravennatiunti The other military complex at which Asclepius potentially was worshiped lay on the opposite side of Rome, in Trastevere, where a dedication to Asclepius by military personnel (cat, no. 28) was discovered near the Piazza Mastai, in close proximity to a dedication to Jupiter Dolichenus.128 It has been argued recendy that these came from a shrine within the Castra Ravennatium, but since this naval installation has traditionally been placed in the vicinity of S. Crisogono, it may be more advisable to attribute these two dedications to an unknown military site that either enclosed or stood adjacent to a Dolicheneum}29 The joint worship of Asclepius and Jupiter Dolichenus by military personnel (among others) may also have been evident on the Tiber Island, since one dedication to Dolichenus by an optio classis praetoriae Ravennatts was found there,130 while another that was probably commis sioned by a sailor was seen in Trastevere at S. Benedetto in Piscinula, which is situated just beyond the Pons Cestius.131 These two inscriptions could indicate that Jupiter Dolichenus was worshiped on 126 On the sanctuary and the dozens of inscriptions and reliefs from the site, presumably located in an unknown place or vicus named Zim(i)dra, see Tsontchev 1941; cf. IGBulg 3.1:117-118 and nos. 1114-1292. For the epithets, of which Zu[xu8Qr]vog, Zu[i^8qy]vo(;, and ZuX.|ii&gt;?8QY]vog were the most common, as well as the likely name of this village, see Tsontchev 1941, 74-75. The reliefs from Batkun represent Asclepius Zimidre nus/Sindrinus both in the manner traditional for Asclepius and as a Thracian rider-god: compare, for example, an acephalous statuette for Asklepios Zymydrenos that represents the god using conventional iconography or a relief of the god beside Hygieia and Telesphorus (IGB?/g 3.1:1133; IGBulg}. 1:1141), with a relief for Asklepios Zylmyzdrenos that represents a Thracian rider-god (IGBulg 3.1:1226). Such differences in iconography, however, do not indicate theological distinctions and simply reflect different ways of representing the same god, as is demonstrated by Nora Dimitrova's recent study of Thracian rider reliefs (see Dimitrova 2002,216-220). For the iconography of Asclepius as a rider-god in Thrace, see LIMC2 (1984) 897-901, s.v. "Asklepios (in Thracia)" (Z. Goceva). 127 See the discussion in the catalogue. On the Thracian dedications in general, see Durry 1938, 333-339. 128CIL 6:415 (= Zappata 1996,192-193, no. 45). This dedica tion to Asclepius has been repeatedly assigned by scholars to the Tiber Island (see n. 62). 129 See discussion in catalogue. 130 AE 1971, 28 (= Zappata 1996, 188-191, no. 43). 131 CIL 6:418 + add. pp. 3005, 3756 (= Zappata 1996, 191-192, no. 44); cf. Lanciani, FUR, pi. 28. This inscription has been taken as evidence for a Dolicheneum in Trastevere (L. Chioffi, LTUR, "Iuppiter Dolichenus, aedes (Reg. XIV),"</page><page sequence="33">PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE CULT OF ASCLEPIUS AT ROME 119 the island, either in his own shrine or at the Asklepieion itself, but this is far from certain, since not all inscriptions first seen on the island necessarily originated there, and these two could easily have originated in Trastevere, perhaps even at the same site as the dedication to Asclepius.132 Unknown Cult Sites Linked to Asclepius As the existence of the various temples and shrines discussed above indicates, the cult of Asclepius once extended throughout Rome. Several of the sites known from inscriptions and other finds were extramural, perhaps because such areas were not so quickly despoiled as the city itself. Asclepius probably had no more than two temples?only a few gods had three or more?but numerous shrines that did not survive the ravages of the postclassical era may once have existed within the city, as had the god's Tiber and Esquiline sanctuaries before the Christians expunged them from the landscape. Indeed, since the fourth-century Regionary Catalogues show the presence of dozens of aediculae within the city?only a small percentage of which have been positively identified, let alone discovered?it seems highly unlikely that none of these honored Asclepius. Unfortunately, no more shrines of Asclepius are revealed by the remaining epigraphical evidence, although it is quite likely that at least some of the dedications of unknown provenience originated at cult sites of this god that are completely unknown (cat. nos. 30-39). Similarly, literary evidence does not indicate the existence of additional sites, with one possible exception.133 Archaeological evidence, however, may point to additional sites at which Asclepius was worshiped. Just as the find spots of certain inscriptions appear to reveal the existence and approximate location of otherwise unknown cult sites of Asclepius, the find spots of anepigraphical statues and reliefs of the god may serve the same function.134 Dozens of such representations of Asclepius are preserved at museums in Rome, and, while the origins for most of these are unknown and therefore they cannot even be assigned to Rome itself with confidence, the find spots of several were recorded and therefore might indicate the former presence of a shrine of Asclepius.135 Unfortunately, these rarely can be definitively linked to a cult site since both public buildings and the dwellings of the rich commonly featured sculptures of the gods, many of which had been brought from Greece or were copies of Greek originals, and thus any number of sculpted objects could have been displayed in such settings for decorative rather than functional purposes. Furthermore, even if some of these statues and reliefs came from temples or shrines, these sites need not have been consecrated to Asclepius: as discussed above, Asclepius could be worshiped at other gods' cult sites.136 3:132-133), but also has been speculatively assigned to the Tiber Island (Coarelli 1996a, 587). 132 Filippo Coarelli argues for Jupiter Dolichenus's worship on the island (Coarelli 1996a, 585-587), but D. Degrassi is rightly skeptical (D. Degrassi, LTUR, op. cit., 3:100). 133 Lugli suggests that the cryptic reference to Asclepius as one who "in earlier times having turned into a serpent climbed to an elevated sanctum on the Roman Palatine" {quondam versus in anguem templa Palatinae subiit sublimia Romae) in the late antique medical writer Marcellus Empiricus's Carmen de Speciebus may allude to a cult site on the Palatine (Marc. Carm. de Spec. 3^4, ed. Niedermann; Lugli, Fontes 8:55, no. 1). 134 For the importance of dedicatory reliefs to the topographi cal study of the cults of Athens, see Vikela 1997. To some extent, a similar approach can be applied to the dedicatory reliefs and sculptures found in Rome. 135 In addition to the anepigraphical materials, three inscribed statues of Asclepius survive (cat. nos. 33, 36, 38), as well as a single relief (cat. no. 30). There is also an ornate altar that features reliefs of serpents approaching an offering of two fruits and a pinecone (cat. no. 31), which were elements of the cult's iconography (see Ciotti 1943-1945,40-42; see also CILA 2.2, no. 360 + fig. 197, from Sevilla, a relief of serpents eating pinecones from an altar, and IG 10.2, 2, 58, from Macedonian Herakleia, a plaque featuring two ears flanking a pinecone). All five dedications are of unknown provenience, though there is reason to link the relief to the headquarters of a corpus pistorum (see catalogue discussion). Seep. 114-115.</page><page sequence="34">120 GIL H. RENBERG Bearing in mind such considerations, the statues and reliefs of Asclepius uncovered in Rome do further demonstrate his far-reaching presence in the city. In addition to the colossal statue of Asclepius found on the Tiber Island and the statuette from the area of Madonna dei Monti,137 both of which can be linked to known sanctuaries of Asclepius with varying degrees of certainty, sculptures of Asclepius have also been found at other ancient complexes, including the Domus Tiberiana or an adjacent complex on the Palatine, the Baths of Caracalla, where a colossal head was found, and, as noted above, in the immediate vicinity of the Castra Praetoria.138 But most notably, a large statue of Asclepius accompanied by a young boy carrying a sacrificial rooster was unearthed in the Forum Romanum just east of the Lacus Iuturnae and most likely came from this shrine or the adjacent site often identified as a statio aquarumP9 That Asclepius should be worshiped at or close to the Lacus Iuturnae is appropriate since this water-goddess is believed to have exhibited her therapeutic powers at this sanctuary;140 however, it is impossible to conclude from the presence of this statue alone that Asclepius had a shrine in the Forum.141 Like the colossal head and statue of Asclepius standing beside a young worshiper, a statue that is believed to have been found on the Quirinal and a colossal head from the Palatine were not found near known cult sites of Asclepius, raising the possibility that Asclepius was worshiped in these neighborhoods as well.142 Outside the city, a broken relief possibly representing Asclepius and two other figures that appears to have originated in Athens was found in the area of the Via Appia near the tomb of Caecilia Metella and may have come from the same site as one or more of the inscriptions from this area that pertain to the cult of Asclepius, though it might instead have decorated someone's villa.143 All other sculpted representations of Asclepius from Rome and its suburbs are of unknown provenience.144 137 See nn. 50 and 70. There may also have been a statue of Asclepius found near the Baths of Titus, in the general vicinity of the Esquiline sanctuary (see n. 70). 138 Palatine: Tomei, Museo Palatino, no. 110.

Becatti 1973 1974,20 et pasim and Riethm?ller 2005,2:432, no. 587. The speculation that the young boy represents Ianiskos, a son of Asclepius according to some traditions, is difficult to accept (see Holl?nder 1912, 153-155). Liisa Harri disputes Boni's contention that the statue originated in the niche built into the west wall of the Atrium Vestae that faces both the "statio aquarum" and the Lacus Iuturnae, basing her argument on the dimensions of the niche. The presumed statio aquarum has been thought to have served as a cult site linked to the cura aquarum (see Bruun 1989, 145), but there is a good possibility that the site has been misidentified and was not connected to the city s water supply (see P. Burgers, LTUR, "Statio aquarum," 4:346-349). 140 See Aronen 1989, 60-63; cf. Harri 1989, 205 and E. M. Steinby, LTUR, "Lacus Iuturnae," 3:170. The possible existence of an actual cult site of Asclepius somewhere in the Forum Romanum was proposed by Maiuri, based on the representation of a statue of Asclepius in one of the arches of the Colosseum in the "Sacra Via relief" on the Tomb of the Haterii, but this argument is unconvincing (Maiuri 1912, 244-245, n. 2; on the relief, see Jensen 1978, 88-151, esp. 97 and 137). Even if Maiuri was correct, this statue from the Lacus Iuturnae appears unrelated to the one in the Haterii relief. Moreover, the fragmentary Greek inscription apparently referring to a temple of Asclepius that was found in the Forum and cited by Maiuri is now believed to pertain to a temple in Greece or Asia Minor, not Rome (IGUR 1:75). 142 Quirinal: Rome, Mus.

Another statue found on the Quirinal that has been thought by some to represent a youthful, beardless Asclepius is more likely a statue of a human?perhaps a doctor?in the guise of a god (Vatican, Braccio Nuovo 2288: LIMC 2, "Asklepios," no. 157 + pi. = Wrede, Consecratio, 195-196, no. 3 + pi. 1, 2-A). 143 Rome, Mus.

For the inscriptions from the Via Appia that relate to Asclepius, see pp. 109-111. 144 The most noteworthy of these is a travertine cippus of Severan date that represents the Capitoline Triad in relief on one side and Asclepius, Hygieia, and Telesphorus on the</page><page sequence="35">PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE CULT OF ASCLEPIUS AT ROME 121 3. Asclepius and His Worshipers in Rome Both the inscriptions themselves and their topographical distribution reveal the nature of Asclepius's cult in Rome in ways that the literary sources do not. With the exception of the oft-told story of Asclepius's introduction to Rome and the establishment of his temple on the Tiber Island, Roman authors almost completely neglected the god and his sanctuary.145 As discussed above, the sanctuary was briefly described by Festus, and Varro noted having seen paintings at the "old" temple.146 The only other specific references to the temple were made by Cassio Dio, who reports that swarms of bees gathering at its ceiling in 43 b.c. were considered an ill omen,147 and by Pliny the Elder and Plutarch, who gave different explanations for why the Asklepieion was established on the Tiber Island.148 Suetonius's statement that sick slaves were being abandoned on the insula Aesculapi during the reign of Claudius also appears to pertain to Asclepius's temple, the likeliest place for them to have convalesced.149 With so little attention devoted to Asclepius's foremost cult site in Rome, it is no surprise that the lesser sites were ignored altogether by Roman authors. And, since these literary sources on Asclepius in Rome provide virtually nothing of substance regarding the god's cult in general, the nonliterary evidence must be relied on. These sources reveal a god who played a vital role in maintaining and restoring his worshipers' health?perhaps even visiting them in their dreams as they practiced incubation at one or more of his sanctuaries?but they also reveal a god who was worshiped by individuals from many different segments of society for a range of purposes. Cult Organization and Worshipers Relatively little is known about the cult organization at Asclepius's two sanctuaries and the individu als who frequented these sites, though there is more extensive information regarding Asclepius's worshipers in Rome in general.150 As was reported by Festus, Asclepius was worshiped on the Tiber Island according to his native tradition, from which it can be inferred that he was served by a priest hood and lesser officials, as at Epidauros.151 Evidence for an official priesthood may be supplied by one or two funerary inscriptions for a sacerdos Aesculapi, but both inscriptions are problematic, and neither priest can be assigned to a particular sanctuary. In the case of one inscription, the word sacerdos has been restored, and too much of the name of the deceased is lost for a restoration to be attempted.152 Another funerary inscription clearly preserves both the title sacerdos Aesculapi and other (Rome, Mus. Naz. Rom. 534: Mus. Naz. Rom.,Sculture 1.2, no. 16). See also Frankfurt, Liebieghaus 79a: LIMC 2, "Asklepios," no. 270 + pi. 143 For the sources concerning the sanctuary's establishment, see n. 17. 146Festus, De sign, verb., 110M (= p. 98 Lindsay); Varro, LL 7.57. See pp. 99-101. 147 Cass. Dio 47.2.3. 148Plin. NH 29.8.16; Plut. Quaest. Rom. 94 (see pp. 96-97). 149Suet.

Cat. no. 5, an altar for Asclepius from a two-time minister that was preserved on the island, has been cited as evidence for the cult's hierarchy because of the misconcep tion that this individual served Asclepius (e.g., Besnier 1902, 210 and IIS 3.1:576); however, as Franz B?rner correctly perceived, this slave was a minister vici (B?rner 1954/1955, cf. Lott 2004, 161-163,203; on ministri in Roman cults, see RE 15.2 [1932] 1846-1848, s.v. "Ministri" [E. Marbach]). The altar most likely originated at the island's vicus Censori, not the sanctuary itself (on the vicus, see n. 33). 132 CIL 6:2231: D(is) m(anibus)\[?]nus qui et Muner[?J \[?? sacerd]os\Asculapi se vib[o fecit sibi et]\[libert]is libertabusqu[e posterisque eorum]. The inscription has been dated by Tassini to the third or fourth century A.D. because of the use of the supernomen (indicated by the presence of quiet), a practice uncommon in Latin inscriptions before the</page><page sequence="36">122 GIL H. RENBERG the individuals name, but it was only viewed by a sixteenth-century antiquarian and has been suspected of being a forgery.153 If genuine, it would show that an individual whose name, Lucius Plaetorius Sabinus, suggests a possible familial link to one of the regions along an Adriatic coast, had functioned as Asclepius's priest somewhere in Rome.154 This, in turn, could serve as yet further evidence for those concluding that Asclepius in Rome was worshiped mostly by foreigners and those of servile or formerly servile status.155 Such a conclusion is understandable since sixteen of the dedications to Asclepius were either inscribed in Greek or commissioned by Greeks, or both (cat. nos. 8, 9, 10, 15, 17,18, 19, 21, 24, 29, 31, 32, 35, 36, 37, 38).156 Moreover, the only literary evidence regarding the god's clientele, Suetonius's reference to sick slaves being abandoned on the Tiber Island, might testify to Asclepius's popularity among Rome's slave population.157 Nu merous Greeks, including slaves, freedmen, and free-born residents of Rome, bore theophoric names such as Asclepiades, Asclepiodorus, and Asclepiodotus, as well as Asclepius itself, signal ing the importance of this god to Rome's Greeks.158 Indeed, there is even reason to think that the Esquiline sanctuary was primarily frequented by a local Greek community since the three dedications linked to the site, one of which was by a physician from Smyrna,159 were all inscribed late second century A.D., and on the grounds that Asculapi and se vibo appear to represent later Latin spellings (Tassini 1995-1996,58). 153 CIL 6:2230 + add. p. 3307: L(ucio) Plaetorio L(ucii) f(ilio) Claudia (tribu) Sabino, \sacerd(oti) Aesculapi vix(it) ann(os) LXXV,\M(arcus) Plaetorius Numisianus Sabinus\f(aciundum) c(uravit). The inscription is described as "valde suspecta" by one editor of CIL without explanation, though the reason may lie in the fact that a nearly identical inscription from Tibur was recorded during the Renaissance by the habitual forger of antiquities Pirro Ligorio (CIL 14:359* = Inscrlt 4.1, 100*). It has been dated no later than the first century A.D. by Tassini, who treats it as genuine, on the basis of nomenclature (Tassini 1995-1996, 19-20). 154 As pointed out by Tassini, the gentilicial Plaetorius is most commonly found in Italy's Regio IV (Samnium), Dalmatia and Illyricum, and it is also known in Regio X (Venetia and Istria) and the Brundisium plain (Tassini 1995-1996, 19-20; see Vulpe 1925, 131, n. 1,143 n. 2,208, n. 6 et passim; cf. OPEL 3:145). Both this inscription and the other funerary inscription have been speculatively linked by Riethm?ller to the Tiber Island sanctuary, but such a conclusion is problematic for the reasons discussed above (Riethm?ller 2005, 1:325, n. 4). 155 See Besnier 1902, 205; Musial 1990, 236; Musial 1992a, 51-54. 156 Also worth noting is that Ulpia Cynegis, the woman who made a donation to the collegium of imperial masons (see p. 110), can be identified as a Greek from her name (see Solin, Griech. Personennamen, 2:1111, s.v. "Cynegis"). A dedication to an unspecified divinity has been uncon vincingly associated with Asclepius by Besnier and Tassini because it was assigned by one antiquarian source to the Tiber Island?even though the other sources said it was seen in Trastevere or, more vaguely, "near" the Tiber at "S. Maria," which could refer to one of several churches on either side of the river?and also because the dedicant's name, Lucius Licinius Seleucus, suggests an eastern origin (CIL 6:841 + add. p. 3007; see Besnier 1902, 210-211 and Tassini 1995-1996, 59, no. 42; cf. Riethm?ller 2005,1:325, n. 4). This proposed link to the cult of Asclepius is far from certain, though if the inscription was indeed seen at S. Maria dell' Orto, it could be one of the dedications originally erected at a cult site in this area, among which was a military dedication for Asclepius (cat. no. 28; see pp. 118-119). 157 The point is that of Besnier (Besnier 1902, 208). 158 See Solin, Griech. Personennamen 3:1636-1637 (index). Hygieia's name was likewise commonly adopted as a female name (see Solin, Griech. Personennamen 1:390-392, s.v. "Hy gia"). Of special interest is a third-century A.D. sarcophagus of Marcus Cornelius Hermadio, whose cognomen was Greek, and his wife Cornelia Hygia, which appears to represent him in the guise of Asclepius and her as Hygieia (CIL 6:16229; see Wrede, Consecratio, 197, no. 5 + pi. 2, 4). 159 At Rome, the close relationship between physicians and their patron god is exemplified by the two epigrams inscribed on this dedication by Nikomedes of Smyrna (cat. no. 8) (see p. 126) and is implicit in Pliny's comment that Asclepius's temple was placed outside the city because of the Romans' negative view of Greek medicine and physicians (Plin. HN 29.8.16). It may also be evident in a bilingual inscribed funerary altar from the Via Aurelia that bears a relief of Asclepius and Telesphorus in the pediment and was erected in the second or early third century A.D. by one Greek for his Greek magis(er/6i^6iayioiXo(;, who, if A. Br?hl is correct, taught him the medical arts {IGUR 2:608 + photo = LIMC 7, "Telesphoros," no. 90; see Br?hl 1956 and BE 1958,552). Despite the association of Asclepius and physicians at Rome, there is no evidence that physicians active at the Tiber Island Asklepieion had issued the medical prescriptions found in the inscribed record of the god's miraculous cures (cat. no. 6), as has been claimed (see Musial 1992b; cf. Musial 1992a,</page><page sequence="37">PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE CULT OF ASCLEPIUS AT ROME 123 in Greek (cat. nos. 8-10).160 Similarly, the shrine at the fons aquae perennis Hygiae may also have catered to a particular population?not Greeks but rather natives of the northern Adriatic, where Asclepius was also popular.161 Two of the three dedications from the site appear to reveal such a link: the use of the formula gratias agens in one dedication suggests that it was commissioned by a native of one of Rome's Latin-speaking eastern provinces (cat. no. 19),162 while the gentilicial name of the man and woman making another dedication indicates possible ties to northeastern Italy, most likely Aquileia (cat. no. 17).163 If this shrine was indeed patronized primarily by worshipers from the northern Adriatic, it could well be that the priest Lucius Plaetorius Sabinus, possibly a native of this area himself, served at this site rather than the Tiber Island sanctuary. The general absence of references to the Asklepieion or the god's cult in Roman literature has been taken as a sign that members of Rome's upper classes, many of whom harbored a suspicion of Greek medicine, did not worship Asclepius, either at this sanctuary or away from it.164 It has even been argued that Aelius Aristides's failure to mention the site testifies to its unimportance for Roman elites.165 These argumenta ex silentio are by no means conclusive since other gods, including native divinities, who played prominent roles in Roman private cult did not fare considerably better in the literary record.166 Nevertheless, the fact that none of those named in dedications to Asclepius can be identified as a member of the senatorial or equestrian classes does appear to support this observation.167 In contrast, many of the dedicants were slaves or freedmen (cat. nos. 5, 14, 18, 22, 37) or active and retired military personnel (cat. nos. 12, 13, 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 32), suggesting that Asclepius was especially popular among members of these groups.168 However, Asclepius was 43,51-52). For the association of doctors with Asclepius in general, see Samama 2003, 64-66 and Wickkiser 2006. 160 The presence of a Greek community in this neighbor hood may also be attested by the discovery of several dozen Greek inscriptions near the Baths of Trajan. Most notably, an association of Greek athletes (r] lego. ^uaiiKrj auvo?oc,) was headquartered just east of the Baths of Trajan and produced more than a dozen inscriptions found mostly at or near S. Pietro in Vincoli (IGUR 1:235-248, ILS 5164; see L. Chi offi, LTUR, "Curia Athletarum," 1:330 + add. p. 5:241 and Richardson, NTDAR, "Curia Athletarum," 102; cf. Newby 2002,185). However, Moretti's hesitant suggestion that alloi the Greek inscriptions associated with Asclepius might have originated on the Esquiline has little merit (IGUR 1, p. 84, on cat. nos. 6,36-39) since Greek dedicatory inscriptions in general, like other types of Greek inscriptions, were widely distributed throughout the city. 161 For the cult of Asclepius in the north Adriatic, see Tiussi 1999 and Riethm?ller 2005, 2:438^41, nos. 614-625. The inscriptions recording the presence of Balkan and Danubian natives in Rome are collected and discussed in Ricci 1993. 162 On the geographical distribution of the formula gratias a gens, see n. 106. 163 Though individuals named Cantius or Cantia are known in several provinces, Tassini has effectively presented arguments in favor of associating the dedicants Lucius Cantius Rufinus and Cantia Euhodia, who may have been colliberti, with the gens Cantia in Aquileia (Tassini 1995-1996, 20-21, relying partly on Leber 1970; cf. Tiussi 1999, 36 and OPEL 2:32). 164 See Besnier 1902,204-205. This claim is partly belied by the fact that Romans traveling or stationed in the East would visit Asklepieia: see, e.g., the list of senators and equestrians who show up in the epigraphical record of the Pergamon Asklepieion (IPergamon 8.3, pp. 193-194). 165 See Besnier 1902, 208. 166 The best example of this is Silvanus, who is named in more than 265 inscriptions from Rome but was discussed by few authors and was of little interest to the upper classes (for the inscriptions, see Panciera 1995; for the literary sources, see Palmer 1978,241-242 andDorcey 1992,153; on general lack of interest among the elites, see Dorcey 1992,3,81 et passim). 167 This follows a much larger pattern evident throughout the Latin West where, as Tassini has found, only 3.5 percent of inscriptions pertaining to the cult of Asclepius were com missioned by senators and 4.6 percent by equestrians, in contrast to 23 percent by freedmen, 21 percent by soldiers and 10 percent by slaves (Tassini 1995-1996, 277-299). See also the discussion of Patrizia Calabria regarding the rarity of republican coins representing Asclepius (Calabria 1992, 71). It is worth considering that the paintings of light-armed cavalry seen at the temple by Varro, if they were indeed given as dedications in the aftermath of a military victory (see n. 47), could reflect upper-class worship by at least one Roman who was prominent enough to lead armies. The testimonial inscription assigned to the Tiber Island</page><page sequence="38">124 GIL H. RENBERG by no means shunned by Roman citizens of native birth and ancestry. This is demonstrated by sev eral dedications commissioned by individuals whose names appear to be typically Roman (though some may have Celtic origins): Lucius Albanius (cat. no. 1), Marcus Populicios (sc. Publicius) (cat. no. 2), Caius Bruttius (cat. no. 7), Septimius Martinus and Plaetoria Ianuaria (cat. no. 16),169 Lucius Valerius Iunianus (cat. no. 23), Marcus Sevius Seneca (cat. no. 27),170 Quintus Ennius Sabinianus (cat. no. 28), Caius Pupius Firminus (cat. no. 30), Caius Celsinius Martinus (cat. no. 33), and Silius Sabinus (cat. no. 34). A dedication by two recently discharged Praetorians even identifies one, Quintus Rosinius Severus of Mutina, as a native of Italy, while his comrade, Titus Popilius Broc chus from Tarraconensis, possessed a Roman name (cat. no. 20). The prevalent view that Asclepius was especially popular among foreigners and the lower classes needs to be tempered in view of the epigraphical evidence: there are almost as many dedications to Asclepius made by those of Italian heritage as by Greeks and twice as many as by identifiable slaves or freedmen. Worship under the Antonines and Severans The worship of Asclepius in Rome began in the mid-republic and continued at least as late as the third century a.d., but while it is impossible to determine for certain, Asclepius may have enjoyed a surge?or resurgence??of popularity in Rome during the Antonine and Severan periods. This is evident from the majority of the dedicatory inscriptions, which date to one of these periods or else are post-Severan, as well as from the testimonial inscription that refers to healing miracles ef fected "during the time of our August emperor Antoninus," most likely Caracalla (cat. no. 6).171 It is not all that surprising that most of the epigraphical evidence for Asclepius's worship in Rome would come from the Antonine or Severan periods: after all, the period between a.d. 150 and 250 saw the greatest production of inscriptions in Rome and the rest of the Latin West.172 But the epi graphical evidence is complemented by other forms of evidence. The most notable, as well as the most easily dated, is the medallion struck under Antoninus Pius in commemoration of Asclepius's arrival at Rome.173 This emperor's reign witnessed the 450th anniversaries of both his arrival and his temple's subsequent foundation, and it appears likely that the coin featuring Asclepius that was struck in a.d. 156/157 was specifically intended to honor the former anniversary.174 Two other ar chaeological finds have been dated to the Antonine period exclusively on iconographical grounds: provides further evidence for the worship of Asclepius by members of these groups (cat. no. 6). While the first two individuals named, Gaius and Lucius, cannot be assigned to a particular segment of Roman society, the fourth, Valerius Aper, is identified as a soldier, and the third individual's name, Iulianus, was commonly born by slaves (see Solin, Sklavennamen 1:13). In addition, the two gifts to collegia named for Asclepius and Hygieia both appear to have been made by freedwomen (cat. no. 11; Josi 1936, 211 [see n. 88]). As discussed in the previous note, this pattern of freedmen, slaves, and soldiers representing the three largest groups of worshipers of Asclepius in Rome matches patterns evident in inscriptions elsewhere in the Roman Empire. 169 As discussed above, the gentilicial Plaetorius could indi cate an origin in Samnium, but it could also be from one of the provinces with an Adriatic seacoast (see n. 154). The cognomen Seneca does raise the possibility of Spanish origins (see OPEL 4:65). 171 For the dating of this inscription, see the discussion in the catalogue. For the interest of emperors of the Antonine and Severan periods in Asclepius, see Musial 1992a, 57-59. 172 See Mrozek 1973 and MacMullen 1982. 173 Seen. 5 and fig. 7. 174 BMCRE 4:343, no. 2034 + pi. 49, 8. See Grant 1950, 105-106; cf. Beaujeu 1955, 301, n. 4. Jean Beaujeu accepts Lugli's unsupported claim that Antoninus Pius restored the temple for the anniversary (Lugli, Mon. ant. 3:624), but at best it is possible to conclude from the evidence that the emperor commemorated Asclepius's arrival and his temple's dedication. In both this case and that of the coin issue celebrating the 500th anniversary (see below), the temple's foundation was incorrectly dated to 293 b.c., which was when the plague first struck Rome (see n. 17).</page><page sequence="39">PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE CULT OF ASCLEPIUS AT ROME 125 Fig. 8.

That Asclepius's intended function in Rome was that of healing god is likely demonstrated by the location of his first sanctuary in a "healthful" extraurban spot that included a supply of fresh water, which was an important element of the god's healing shrines.182 Likewise, the Via Cassia site, judging from the god's title as Paean of the Tiber, appears to indicate proximity to the river and, presumably, springs feeding into it. Such a preference for the presence of a water source may also be reflected in the location of the possible healing shrine outside the 175 See n.21. 176 See n. 142. 177 See n. 159.

RENBERG Porta Flaminia at the spring later named for Hygieia.183 While the physical settings of these cult sites suggest links to healing, more direct evidence for Asclepius's importance as a healer in Rome is to be found in inscriptions. Two of the Greek dedications addressed to Asclepius employ epithets pertaining to his medical prowess and role as averter of illness: "the one who drives away diseases and suffering" (vouacov tcocOsoov is sXaxfjcO in one (cat. no. 9), and "releaser from illness" (vouao?,?iy]cJ, "famous for skill" (x?m?fxrjTic;), and "life-giving" (cpsQsa?iocJ in the other (cat. no. 38).184 Private dedications in both Latin and Greek credit Asclepius with recoveries: in addition to the epigram from the Via Cassia recording Lupus's recovery from tuberculosis (cat. no. 29), a dedication to Asclepius and Hygieia by an eques singularis was erected "for the well-being of himself and his and that of Lucius Iulius Helix, the medicus who diligently restored me back to health in accordance with these gods" [pro salute sua suorumque et L(uci) luli Heitels medici qui cur am mei diligenter egit secundum deos) (cat. no. 12),185 and a dedication of unknown provenience claims that the dedicant, an imperial freedman, was cured of a spleen ailment by Asclepius's direct assistance (cat. no. 37). The latter dedicant, Neochares Iulianus, gave the god a silver anatomical votive in the form of a spleen, inscribing the base with the grateful statement that he had "been saved by your hands from a swelling of the spleen" (?v%o[v] o7ikr\vdc; aco?sic, om? awv %igcov).186 In addition to curing those who were already sick, Asclepius evidently could dispense advice on maintaining one's health. The most elaborate dedication for Asclepius from Rome, by the physician Nikomedes of Smyrna, is a large base from the Esquiline site that once supported a statue of the god as a child that was copied from an original by the famed Hellenistic sculptor Boethos.187 On this base were inscribed two Greek dedicatory epigrams preceded by similar prose statements that the dedication was made "as a gift for deliverance and thank offering" (o&amp;otqol xoel ^acuaTrjcuoc) (cat. no. 8A-B). While the first epigram vaguely credits Asclepius with having saved the dedicant from serious illnesses (line 7), in the second epigram, this doctor relates that he had placed the statue in the temple as a thank offering (^coaycHoc, line 7), telling the god, "many times by your advice (I have) avoided disease" (noWum gouc, ?otAocTg | vouaov aXeuapievog, line 8).188 The man ner in which this "advice" was communicated is not revealed, but since so noted a physician as Galen claimed to have received medical inspiration for an operation in a dream, and was aware of an individual at Pergamon who underwent a similar operation after receiving a dream, this is the likeliest medium.189 While Galen does not attribute these dreams to Asclepius, it is possible that the god himself was envisioned both times, especially in the case of the incident at Pergamon; 183 If there was another shrine of Asclepius in the Parco Egerio, as seems unlikely (see pp. 111-114), it may have been located near the Marana brook or else an unknown spring. In antiquity, this area must have been flush with water, as was the area to the west where the Camenae and other nymphs were believed to dwell. 184 In addition, a badly damaged altar addressing "Paean" features the word vouaoc,, either in reference to a specific ailment or to Asclepius's talents in general (cat. no. 39). 185 For a similar inscription from Lycia, see n. 200. 186 On this phrase, see p. 128. In discussing this inscrip tion, F. T. van Straten has observed that the dedication of a replica of an internal organ is much more typical of Italic anatomical votives than those found in Greece (van Straten 1981, 142). 187 On the lost statue, see Maiuri 1912, 247-250; on Niko medes himself, see RE 17.1 (1936) 500, s.v. "Nikomedes 14." As was first suggested by A. Falconieri during the seventeenth century, this may have been the same individual whose epitaph from Rome labels him "the finest doctor" (olqiotoq, iy]tq6&lt;;), and one who "saved many with his pain-alleviating drugs" (noXkooq is o(baaq ^olq\l6lkoic, avwSuvoicJ (IGUR 3:1283 = Samama 2003,520-521, no. 476; see Maiuri 1912, 242-243). 188 Maiuri suggested that this verse could be an allusion to one of the major epidemics of the imperial period (Maiuri 1912,248-249, n. 2). 189 Galen, Cur.

Whereas these dedicatory inscriptions provide tantalizing glimpses into Asclepius's medical practice at Rome, the lone testimonial inscription provides the most detailed evidence for Asclepius as a healing god at Rome. This inscription, a large marble tablet suspected to be from the Tiber Island Asklepieion, preserves four third-person testimonies of miraculous recoveries achieved by individuals who had complied with instructions communicated to them by Asclepius (cat. no. 6): [?] |a6xalg xaiq rjuigoctc, Ia(a) tivI TuepXo) exQr\\i(XTioev ?A,0etv sn[i to] Is|qov ?yjfxa xal Tigoaxuvrjaai, el&lt;x&gt;a ol%6 tou 8s?iou sX.6etv S7ti to ?lqioxsq?v | xal OsTvai tou&lt;; 7isvts SaxTuXoug S7rava) tou ?^jiaToc, xal d@ai ttjv xbi\qol K0Cl ^7ci6sivat kid Toug i8(oug ocpOaXfxoug- xal ?q??v dve?Xe^s tou |5 8?]fiou 7iaQ?GTo5Tog xal GUvxoci?Ofxevou, ?tl ^coaai ocQsml sysvovTO stiI | tou Es?aaTOU rjpLwv ?vtcovsivou. | Aoux(q) 7iX,suq?itix(I) xal dccpy|Ajciapiv(o U7i6 rcavT?g dv0?(O7iou ?XQr\g\i6Lu\osv 6 Oe?g sX-Oetv xal sx tou t?i?a)fjiou a?&gt;ai t?cp@av xal jjlst' oYvou dva|cpuQaaai xal ?7u6eivat km to nXeuQov xal s?coOy] xal or]u,ooia r]u)(a(XGTy]g?v |10 tco 6sa) xal 6 Srjfiog ouveyaQT] auTW. | atfxa dvacps^ovTi TouA-iavw dcprjAJUGfiivco U7c6 TiavT?g dv0Qa)7iou ^grja[xa|Tiaev 6 0edg sX?siv xal sx tou T?i?a&gt;fxou doai x?xxoug GTOo?iXou xal | (paysiv ptsTa piXiTog enl TQsIg iqpiQag* xal ?Gco0r] xal sa-Ocibv 8r)u,oGia | r]u)(ag(GTr)Gev s(jl7tqog6sv tou Srjfxou. | 15 OuaXsQiw "Ahqu GTQaTicoTr] TucpXw ?%Q7i(jidTiGev ? 0sdg sX?siv xal Xa?eiv a!fia|&amp;; aA-exTouuvog tauxou p.exa [xeXiTog xal xoXXu(Dio&lt;v&gt; auvTQityai xal kid | Tgetg rjfxsQag dmxQefaai stiI Toug ?cp?a^fxoug- xal dvs?Xe^?sv xal e\r\kude\&gt; \ xal y]u)(a?)iGT7]g?v ?rjfjioGta tw ?e?&gt;.190 In those days he issued an oracle to a certain Gaius, a blind man, to approach the sacred base and prostrate himself, and then to go from the right to the left and place his five fingers atop the base and lift his hand and place it over his own eyes. And he saw properly once again, with the people standing by and rejoicing that living miracles were happening during the time of our August emperor Antoninus. To Lucius, who was pleuritic and despaired of by all men, the god issued an oracle that he should go and lift ashes from the triple altar and mix them with wine and place this on his side. And he was saved and publicly gave his thanks to the god, and the people rejoiced with him. To Iulianus, who was bringing up blood and despaired of by all men, the god issued an oracle that he should go and lift pinecone seeds from the triple altar and eat them with honey for three days. And he was saved and, appearing publicly, gave his thanks before the people. To Valerius Aper, a blind soldier, the god issued an oracle that he go and take the blood of a white cock along with honey and mix them into an eye salve, and over three days anoint his eyes with this. And he saw once again, and appeared and publicly gave his thanks to the god. In each case, the sufferer appears to have received these instructions by means of a dream-oracle from Asclepius, as is indicated by the use of s^rifiaTiasv, a term occasionally associated with dream revelations in literature, inscriptions, and papyri.191 Since the top of the inscription is broken and 190 In addition to the commentaries by Moretti in IGUR and Girone, the most important discussion of this inscription is Guarducci 1978, 158-165. 191 Literature: Joseph.

RENBERG traces of letters on the right side reveal that at least one column of text is missing, it is clear that this is part of a larger list of miraculous cures, similar in nature both to the famous inscribed steles from Epidauros and Lebena and to the bronze inscriptions later ordered by Diocletian for the Esquiline sanctuary.192 As at Epidauros and Lebena, the motivation for inscribing these accounts does not ap pear to have come from the individuals who were cured but rather from priests or other authorities intent on publicizing the god's remarkable healing powers, and this explains the similar language of each account. This inscription, therefore, served as an advertisement for Asclepius's successful medical practice at one of his sanctuaries, quite possibly the Tiber Island Asklepieion?and, if this was indeed its point of origin, those who posted this tablet may have been emulating the more famous steles of the Epidauros Asklepieion in order to make the tacit claim that the Tiber Island sanctuary was a worthy offshoot. Healing through Incubation? This inscription preserving four healing testimonies is routinely cited by those who have concluded that therapeutic incubation, which involved sleeping within a sacred precinct in the hope of being cured by a god or receiving a prescription in a dream, was practiced at the Tiber Island Asklepieion.193 It has long been assumed that the sick could undergo incubation there, and this may well have been the case, but it has not been recognized that all of the evidence for the practice at this site that has been cited can be called into question.194 The best piece of evidence, this testimonial inscription, does appear to record dream-oracles similar in nature to those received by worshipers at Epidauros and Lebena, and its specific references to the cured individuals appearing publicly seem to imply that while recovering they had been secluded in the same manner as those engaging in incubation at eastern Asklepieia, but its provenience is uncertain, and thus it might have originated on the Esquiline or elsewhere.195 Among dedicatory inscriptions, one in particular stands out as potential evidence for incubation, even though it has never been cited as such: Neochares Iulianus's dedication of a silver anatomical votive after "having been saved by your hands from a swelling of the spleen" (cat no. 37). The phrase "saved by your hands" may be metaphorical?after all, an army doctor's dedication from the legionary fortress at Deva in Britain addresses the god as "Asclepius of healing hand" (r|7ii6)(stQ)?but it could also indicate that Neochares believed that the god had appeared to him in a dream and directly treated him for this malady by performing surgery or simply touching his abdomen.196 Unfortunately, the inscription's provenience is unknown, so it 192 Epidauros: IG 42!:121-124; cf. LiDonnici 1995. The Epidauros steles were seen in antiquity by Pausanias, though not recorded in detail (Paus. 2.27.3; cf. Strabo 8.6.15). Crete: ICret l:xvii, 8, 9, 10B, IIA, HB (?), 12A, 12B (?), 14A, 15, 19, 20 (?); cf. Girone, lamata, 75-135. 193 On incubation in general, see RAC 18 (1997) 179-265, s.v. "Inkubation" (M. Wacht). On the practice in the cult of Asclepius, see esp. Edelstein, Asclepius; Girone, Iamata; Graf 1992; Guarducci 1978; Riethm?ller 2005,382-392 et passim. Among the studies linking cat. no. 6 to incubation at the Tiber Island are: RE 2.2 (1896) 1676,1690, s.v. "Asklepios" (R. Pietschmann); Besnier 1902, 223; Wissowa 1912, 308; Guarducci 1978, 161; Degrassi 1986, 149, cf. D. Degrassi, LTUR, op. cit, 1:22; Musial 1990, 233, 235; Musial 1992a, 40^2; Graf 1992,162; Wacht (above), col. 194; Riethm?ller 2005,2:431. See Renberg 2006 for a brief discussion of this problem (at pp. 110-113), as well as a discussion of numerous sanctuaries of other gods in the Latin West that have been unconvincingly associated with incubation. 195 Even if the inscription itself did originally greet visitors to the Tiber Island sanctuary, it is worth considering that it could be a copy from an eastern sanctuary: perhaps the odd reference to miracles occurring under the emperor "Antoni nus"?probably Caracalla?in the first testimony is a sign that these miracles occurred at the Pergamon Asklepieion during his visit in A.D. 214 (on the visit, see n. 179). The fact that the inscription identifies the afflicted individuals as Gaius, Lucius, Julianus, and Valerius Aper does not contradict this theory, since plenty of Roman names are found in the inscriptions of the Pergamon sanctuary. 196Deva dedication: SEG 50,1086 (= Samama 2003,554-555, no. 524). It was widely believed that, in addition to providing prescriptions, Asclepius when appearing to those undergoing</page><page sequence="43">PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE CULT OF ASCLEPIUS AT ROME 129 is impossible to link it to incubation at a particular sanctuary; but if it were to come from the Tiber Island Asklepieion, it would represent evidence that, in addition to possibly giving prescriptions of the type recorded in the testimonial inscription, Asclepius healed people directly at the site, as at eastern AsklepieiaP1 In contrast, the Via Cassia dedicatory epigram makes clear reference to a sanctuary where a recovery occurred but provides no specific language suggesting that incubation played a role (cat. no. 29).198 Indeed, since it took Lupus 100 days to recover from consumption, one should not conclude automatically that he benefited from the god's nocturnal intervention. (Admittedly, Aelius Aristides's experiences demonstrate that incubation could be essential to some long-term treatments and did not always produce immediate results overnight, while a dedication from Pergamon indicates that an individual received a prescription from Asclepius and followed it for 120 days before being cured.)199 Therefore, this site where "Paean of the Tiber" healed Lupus cannot be identified as a shrine at which incubation occurred on the strength of this one inscription: instead, it could have functioned like one of the many other healing sanctuaries and health spas throughout the ancient world at which people convalesced without seeking or receiving therapeutic dreams from the site's resident divinity.200 While Neochares's rather significant Greek dedicatory inscription is ignored in discussions of incubation at Rome's Asklepieia, three Latin dedicatory inscriptions referring to direct communica tions from Asclepius are regularly cited as evidence for incubation at the Tiber Island Asklepieion, even though all three are of unknown provenience and make no reference to medical problems incubation sometimes healed them as they dreamed, either by merely touching the afflicted individual or by performing an operation. Such a scene is portrayed in a well-known relief from the Peiraeus Asklepieion (Peiraeus 405: Mitropoulou, Attic Votive Reliefs, 63-64, no. 126 + fig. 183 = LIMC 2, "Asklepios," no. 105). 197 The earliest evidence from the cult in Greece, especially at Epidauros, is for such miraculous, quick feats of healing rather than the issuance of prescriptive dream-oracles, but, as the Edelsteins rightly argue, it would be wrong to conclude from the absence of evidence that Asclepius was not provid ing such prescriptions from the very beginning as well (see Edelstein, Asclepius 2:151-155; cf. Wacht [n. 193 above], cols. 222-223). Likewise, an unsustainable distinction is to be found in Moretti's suggestion, made solely on the strength of cat. no. 6, that Asclepius had a single modus operandi at the Tiber Island sanctuary: Sanationes Aesculapii in insula Tiberina differunt a sanationibus illis notissimis Epidauriis quod Epidauri deus ipse noctu aegrotanti medetur, Romae contra Aesculapius videturper somnium aegrotantibus remedia praebere (Moretti, IGUR 1:128-129; contra, see Guarducci 1978, 162, n. 4). Such a sweeping conclusion should not be based on just four accounts from an incomplete inscription and ignores the fact that by the imperial period there was a belief that Asclepius at Epidauros both gave out prescriptions and healed directly (see, e.g., IG 42.1:126 = Girone, Iamata, 58-70, no. 2.4 + photo). If the dedication by Neochares and the testimonial inscription both originated at the Tiber Island site, it would prove that at this Asklepieion, too, Asclepius both healed and gave prescriptions. On direct healing, see ThesCRA 3 (2005) 330, s.v. "Healing through touch" (V. Lambrinoudakis with S. Petrounakos). 198 For an apparently similar situation, see the epigram in the Palatine Anthology in which an individual named Aeschines?perhaps the famous orator?states that he had spent three months at Epidauros waiting for a sore on his head to heal but makes no mention of incubation or a miraculous cure (Anth. Pal. 6.330; see Wickkiser 2006, 31). Wickkiser's article explores the evidence for Asclepius's treatment of chronic conditions. 199 Without support, this Via Cassia inscription's editor concludes that, "La nostra epigrafe costituisce quindi un'ulteriore attestazione dell'uso dell'incubatio anche all'intemo degli Asklepieia romani" (Cordiano and Gregori 1993, 156). Pergamon dedication: SEG 37, 1019. 200 For a possible parallel, which attributes recovery from a persistent illness to therapeutic waters rather than dreams, see the dedication from Ad Mediam in western Dacia inscribed, "To Asclepius and Hygieia, for the well-being of Iunia Cyrilla, because they restored her from a long ill ness by the virtue of the divine power of these waters, her husband(?) T(itus?) B. A. (dedicated this) in fulfillment of a vow freely and deservedly" (Aesculap(io)let Hygiaelpro salute IuniaelCyrillae quod allonga infirmita\te virtute aqua\rum numinis sui\revocaverunt\T(itus?) B(??) A(??) eius v(otum) s(olvit) l(ibens) m(erito)) (IDR 3.1:55 = ILS 3846). Also of note is a Lycian inscription in which an individual thanked both a god, believed to be Asclepius, and the doctor who had treated him, which again demonstrates that Asclepius's healing powers were not manifested solely through incuba tion (IKibyra 1:83 = Samama 2003, 384-385, no. 274B; see EBGR 2002, 28 on this and the similar IKibyra 1:82).</page><page sequence="44">130 GIL H. RENBERG or treatments. These three dedications all indicate that they were prompted by a message from Asclepius: one altar was dedicated "in compliance with a dream" (ex viso) (cat. no. 31), two small statuettes were dedicated by an individual after "having been commanded" (iussus) (cat. no. 33), and an unidentified dedication was made "according to a command from the god's numen" (ex iusso numinis dei) (cat. no. 32).201 The unmistakable claims of divine revelation in these inscriptions have been assumed by scholars to refer to dreams obtained through incubation.202 Such a conclusion ignores the fact that dedicatory inscriptions featuring similar references to divine communications were by no means limited to the cult of Asclepius. There are, in fact, more than 1,300 known Greek and Latin dedications that employ such formulas as ex viso, ex iussu, ex praecepto, somnio monitus, xoct' ovocq, xa6' utcvov, xax' kmmyyp, nQoom^OLVXoc; xou 6eou, and xocxa %Qy][xocxia|ji6v, and these are addressed to more than a hundred different gods.203 With few exceptions, these gods were not associated with medicine, let alone incubation: as is clear from literature as well as this group of inscriptions, any god could appear to any worshiper for any of a number of reasons. Therefore, it is demonstrably wrong to assume that in the case of Asclepius such dedications recording contact between god and worshiper necessarily pertain to incubation.204 Unfortunately, as is true of so many of the 1,300 divinely inspired dedications, these three for Asclepius provide no information regarding the dedicant's experience, instead relying on formulaic language.205 While it is clear that the formula ex viso would refer to either a dream in which the god appeared or a symbolic dream thought to contain a message from the god, the formula ex iusso 201 The ex viso dedication of an image of a serpent is omitted from the following discussion because its provenience is in doubt (cat. no. 41). 202 Although this assumption has been common, there has been some variation in the inscriptions cited. D. Vaglieri had cited cat. nos. 31-33 (Diz. Ep. 1 (1895) 316, s.v. "Aescula pius" (D. Vaglieri)), while R. Pietschmann, Ernst Schmidt, and Wissowa cited only cat. no. 31 (RE22 (1896) 1676,1690, s.v. "Asklepios"; Schmidt 1909, 44; Wissowa 1912, 308, n. 3), and Besnier later included cat. no. 32 in addition to cat. no. 31 in his discussion of incubation, implying a connec tion (Besnier 1902, 225). Other than Vaglieri's, these early discussions excluded cat. no. 33, which had not yet appeared in CIL 6 but was already published elsewhere, though more obscurely (IRNL 6752, cf. CIL 10:948*, 1; EphEp 4:719). This omission was twice perpetuated by Guarducci, who, like Besnier, included cat. no. 31 and 32 in a discussion of incubation at the Tiber Island Asklepieion without explicitly linking them to the practice, thus hedging her bets: instead, she simply concluded that, "il dio si manifestava ai fedeli con visioni durante le quali egli dava consigli o impartiva comandi" (Guarducci 1978, 162; cf. Guarducci 1971, 277). More recent scholars, however, have included cat. no. 33 in their lists of Latin inscriptions linked to incubation. Thus, after stating that incubation was practiced at this site, Musial claimed of cat. nos. 31-33, "Quelques dedicaces adressees ? Esculape en temoignage de gratitude pour les guerisons font allusion ? la revelation par les songes" (Musial 1990,235; cf. Musial 1992b). The notion that these three dedications are evidence of incubation at the Asklepieion has most recently been perpetuated?and thus given further legitimacy?by M. Wacht in his article on incubation in RAC (Wacht [n. 193 above], col. 194), erroneously quoting cat. no. 31 as cat. no. 32, as had Becher 1970, 220-221, n. 61) and by D. Degrassi in her article on the sanctuary for Steinby's Lexicon (D. Degrassi, LTUR, op. cit., 1:22; cf. Degrassi 1986, 149). To date, only one scholar, Cordiano, has urged caution in discussing the background of these inscriptions (Cordiano and Gregori 1993, 160, n. 26). 203 See, most recently, G. Renberg, "'Commanded by the Gods': An Epigraphical Study of Dreams and Visions in Greek and Roman Religious Life" (Ph.D. diss., Duke Uni versity 2003), which is being revised for publication. All state ments regarding this group of 1,300 divinely inspired dedica tions are based on that work and subsequent research. 204 Yhis js a Common misperception: see, e.g., D. Vaglieri's claim that, in addition to cat. nos. 31-33, all such dedications prompted by Asclepius are evidence for incubation (see n. 202). There are indeed many dedications from the major Greek Asklepieia that refer or allude to dreams, but only a small percentage are unambiguously related to incubation. Asclepius is just one of several gods whose dedications cit ing dreams have been ill-advisedly treated as evidence for incubation (see Renberg 2006). 205 This is the case with the two other dedications to Ascle pius erected in Italy following the god's communications: CIL 5:2034 (monitus; Pagus Laebactium, Cisalpine Gaul) and cat. no. 41 (ex viso; Puteoli? Rome?). Another, possibly from Praeneste, features the unique phrase dictu et factu, an apparent reference to the god's word and deed, rather than the dedicant's (ILS 3838 = ILMN 1:513; for an opposing view, see de Marchi 1896-1903, 2:260, n. 4).</page><page sequence="45">PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE CULT OF ASCLEPIUS AT ROME 131 and participle iussus cannot even be linked to dreams with any certainty since divine commands could also be imparted through a range of other divinatory media. For this reason, as well as the fact that it provides no information about the circumstances leading to its dedication, the plinth with statuettes inscribed Iussus Asculapio C(aius) Cel\sinius Martinus ("For Asclepius, having been commanded, Caius Celsinius Martinus (dedicated this)") should not be linked to incubation (cat. no. 33). Similarly, the dedication employing the phrase ex iusso numinis dei cannot be conclusively attributed to a god-sent dream, and the fact that it is concerned not with the dedicant's health but with the emperors' eliminates the likelihood that Asclepius's message was received during incuba tion even if it was transmitted through a dream (cat. no. 32): Salv&lt;i&gt;s Augustis\sancto Aesculapio\ex iusso\numinis dei\posuit\Mustius T(iti) f(ilius) Fab(ia tribu)\Olympus Roma\miles coh(ortis) XI\urb(anae) (centurid) Vituli. With the Augustuses being safe, to holy Asclepius, according to a command from the god's nu men, Mustius Olympus, son of Titus, of the Fabian tribe, from Rome, a soldier of the eleventh urban cohort in the century of Vitulus, erected this. Such dedications made for the health and well-being of the emperor or emperors were quite com mon during the imperial period and were often commissioned by military personnel who sought to enlist the blessings of the gods.206 Several dozen of these dedications were set up following divine commands, as is indicated by the use of such formulas as ex imperio 207 ex iussu 208 ex viso209 and somnio admonitus210 and in none of these cases can any link to incubation be established. Therefore, this dedication is indistinguishable from a larger group bearing comparable texts, and there is no reason for concluding that this soldier had undergone incubation. Of these three Latin dedications for Asclepius, only the altar featuring the formula ex viso might plausibly be linked to incubation (cat. no. 31). The inscription, however, makes not even an oblique reference to health or healing, or any other personal crisis: T(itus) Flavius Antyll\us ex viso Ascl\epio aram\consecravit. Titus Flavius Antyllus, in reaction to a dream, consecrated this altar for Asclepius. This altar, which features a finely carved relief of four serpents partaking of an offering of fruits and a pinecone, is larger and more ornately decorated than most other altars from Rome, and it is tempting to identify it not as yet another unexceptional offering destined to clutter a donarium but rather as the main altar at a public or private shrine?certainly not the typical dedication made in compliance with or response to a dream obtained through incubation. For these reasons, one should not be overly hasty to assume that the three Latin dedications must refer to an incubatory experience simply because they allude to a communication from Ascle pius. After all, in addition to being one of the few gods who was believed to come to worshipers undergoing incubation, Asclepius, like any other divinity, could appear to individuals in dreams or 206 For Asclepius's role of protector of the emperors, see pp. 135-136. 207ILS 3807 (Bellona), IDR 3.5:253 (Mater Deum Magna). 208 CIL 11:2 Qupiter Dolichenus). 209 CIL 5:1870 + add. p. 1053 (Jupiter Dolichenus), CIL 3:8082 (Hercules Invictus), CIL 6:659 (Silvanus).

RENBERG visions whenever he pleased: his inclination to appear to his worshipers was by no means limited to those undergoing incubation, and his presence could be sensed by those nowhere near his healing sanctuaries. As is demonstrated by these Latin inscriptions, particularly if iussus and ex iusso here refer to dreams, as well as the Greek inscriptions recording or alluding to dreams, Asclepius was thought to take an interest in his worshipers' lives and occasionally demonstrated this by appearing to them directly or sending messages that were unmistakably from him. Divinely inspired dedications from throughout the East and West indicate that Asclepius appeared to his worshipers in their dreams with greater relative frequency than all but a few of the other gods. These other divinities, particularly Silvanus, the nymphs, and different Lares, were primarily associated with specific locations where they might be encountered, such as groves, streams, and crossroads, and thus their visible epiphanies were unsurprising because of their immediate proximity. But their unusually frequent appearances in dreams may also have been a product of their importance in private cult, especially in the case of Silvanus and the nymphs, and this may explain Asclepius's propensity for appearing to worshipers whose ensuing dedicatory inscriptions betray no sign of illness or recovery. In other words, Asclepius was a god whose chief role in ancient religion lay in protecting individuals, and his regular appearances in dreams unrelated to incubation is a function of his prominence in private worship. The bulk of the epigraphical evidence for this is to be found outside of Rome, but the Roman inscriptions recording Asclepius's communications indicate that in Rome, too, Asclepius's worshipers felt close enough to the god to believe that he sufficiently cared about them to communicate his concerns. Overall, then, the epigraphical evidence for incubation in the cult of Asclepius in Rome proves to be ambiguous. This is also true of the literary sources that have been repeatedly quoted as proof that incubation was practiced by the god's worshipers at his urban sanctuaries, without anyone noting the circumstantial and unsubstantial nature of this evidence. Some of the claims that have been made in this regard can hardly be supported: for example, the statements by Livy and Plutarch that the Tiber Island had many "temples and porticoes" have been interpreted as evidence for incubation at the Asklepieion, even though neither passage specifically refers to Asclepius's sanctuary, and porticoes were common features at countless sanctuaries that did not employ them as incubation dormitories.211 Two other passages that have been taken as evidence for incubation at the Tiber Island sanctuary, in works of Plautus and Cicero, at most prove that the role of incu bation in Asclepius's cult was known to the Romans by the mid-republic.212 In Plautus's Curculio, set in Epidauros but momentarily shifting its frame of reference to Rome, the characters who are conversing outside the Asklepieion twice refer to incubation: early in the play, Phaedromus mentions that a leno is undergoing incubation in the shrine of Asclepius (hie leno, hie qui aegrotus incubat in Aesculapi fand), and a little later Palinurus, the Cook, and Cappadox discuss the latter's dream-vision of Asclepius from the night before.213 Plautus's Epidaurian comedy indicates that by the turn of the second century B.c. Rome's citizens were sufficiently familiar with incubation for the playwright to expect them to understand his references, but his conflation of Epidauros and Rome should not be taken as definitive proof that incubation was also practiced at Rome's Asklepieion, even if there exists the possibility that Plautus's characters were acting out a scene familiar to Romans who had 211 Livy 2.5.4 and Plut. Publ. 8.6 (see n. 48), cited by Besnier 1902, 200; D. Degrassi, LTUR, op. cit., 3:99; Tiussi 1999, 15-16, n. 3; Riethm?ller2005,1:325, n. 3 (Livy only). Musial is the only scholar to have cast doubt on this claim regarding porticoes and incubation (Musial 1992a, 36). 212 The only reliable evidence for incubation in republican Italy is limited to shrines of Calchas and Podalirius at Mt. Drion in Apulia, though archaeological evidence from the Hellenistic Asklepieion at Agrigentum suggests that incuba tion was practiced there before Roman times, and there is indirect evidence for the practice at certain other Asklepieia in Magna Graecia (see Renberg 2006, 113-114). Plaut. Cure. 61-62,216-273.</page><page sequence="47">PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE CULT OF ASCLEPIUS AT ROME 133 visited the Tiber Island.214 By Cicero's time, the practice of incubation was noteworthy enough to merit consideration in his De Divinatione. At one point, as the philosophical debate between the two brothers progresses, Cicero criticizes the notion that Asclepius or Serapis could impart medical knowledge through dreams: Qui igitur convenit aegros a coniectore somniorum potius quam a medico petere medicinam? An Aesculapius an Serapis potest nobis praescribere per somnium curationem valetudinis, Neptunus gubernantibus non potest?215 Who therefore concludes that the sick should seek treatment from an interpreter of dreams rather than a doctor? Or can either Asclepius or Serapis really prescribe to us in our sleep a remedy for health, but Neptune is not able to do so for helmsmen? This passage might have been targeting the Tiber Island Asklepieion, but in Cicero's day there does not yet appear to have been an Egyptian sanctuary in Rome at which incubation could be under taken, suggesting that Cicero's philosophical persona in this work was speaking about the two cults in generalities rather than alluding to specific sites in Rome.216 Another author, Festus, presents better?albeit likewise indirect?evidence than Plautus and Cicero that incubation was indeed practiced on the island. According to Festus, Asclepius was one of just three foreign gods whose traditional worship was precisely maintained after being introduced to Rome, all during the third century b.c.: Peregrina sacra appellantur, quae aut evocatis dis in oppugnandis urbibus Romam sunt fconataf aut quae ob quasdam religiones per pacem sunt petita, ut ex Phrygia Matris Magnae, ex Graecia Cereris, Epidauro Aesculapi: quae coluntur eorum more, a quibus sunt accepta.217 Rites are called foreign which either by the gods having been summoned to Rome from besieged cities were undertaken (?)... or which were sought during peacetime because of a certain rever ence, as were the rites of the Great Mother from Phrygia, of Ceres from Greece, of Asclepius from Epidauros, which were maintained according to the customs of those from whom they were received. In the case of the two goddesses, other sources reveal to us ways in which their worship remained unchanged: the Magna Mater's priests and priestesses were brought from Asia Minor,218 while Ceres's priestesses were drawn from the Greek populations of southern Italy,219 and so both cults in Rome were overseen by cult leaders familiar with their traditional worship. Furthermore, the Greek-oriented cult of Ceres that began in the late third century b.c., joining a preexisting cult of the Italian Ceres present in Rome since the fifth century b.c., featured expiatory processions of 214 For this unproven link between the Curculio and Tiber Island sanctuary, see Besnier 1902,205-207 and Guarducci 1978, 161-162; cf. Degrassi 1986, 149. 215 CicDw. 2.59.123. 216 A. S. Pease speculated, perhaps erroneously, that Cicero was referring to the Tiber Island sanctuary "because of its nearness" (Pease 1920-1923, 2:367 [repr. ed., p. 549]). Besnier was more convinced that the passage pertained to this site (Besnier 1902, 224-225). But Cicero could just as easily have been alluding to the well-known Asklepieia in the East, as well as Sarapis's Canopus sanctuary, which during the Hellenistic period had become famous for miraculous cures (see Strabo 17.1.17, p. 801; cf. Diog. Laert. 5.76). 217 Festus, De verb, sign., 237 M (= p. 268 Lindsay). 218Dion. Hal. 2.19.4-5. Cic. Mb. 55. See Le Bonniec 1958, 381^00.</page><page sequence="48">134 GIL H. RENBERG matrons and maidens derived from those for Demeter.220 So it appears possible that Asclepius's Tiber Island sanctuary was overseen by Greeks, who introduced his peregrina sacra, and they may have also introduced the practice of incubation.221 It can be inferred, then, that when Asclepius was brought to Rome by the embassy sent to Epidauros, the site of the most important incubation shrine of Asclepius in mainland Greece, the Romans did not modify his cult to follow traditional Roman religious practices but instead worshiped him according to tradition?an important ele ment of which was incubation.222 Therefore, incubation may have been an early, or even original, aspect of the cult of Asclepius in Rome. Later in the imperial period, it may have been practiced at the Esquiline sanctuary as well, since the Passio SS Quattuor Coronatorum reports that Diocletian had ordered that a list of cures effected by Asclepius be inscribed on bronze tablets at the temple (Diocletianus . . . praecepit omnes curas in eodem templo in praeconias aeneas cum caracteribus in figi),223 and since the surviving testimonies of Epidauros and Lebena mostly pertain to cures achieved through incubation, it appears that some of these cures recorded at Diocletian's command would have been achieved through incubation. The literary sources for the cult of Asclepius in Rome leave open the possibility of incubation being practiced at one or more of his sanctuaries, but none of these scattered passages represents conclusive proof. Indeed, the evidence for incubation in Asclepius's cult at Rome is much more limited than has been recognized by those who have treated the subject, and only the unprovenienced inscription preserving testimonies of miraculous recoveries and the likewise unprovenienced Greek dedicatory inscription referring to a cure obtained at the god's hands might constitute reliable proof. Beyond Rome, however, there is a complete lack of direct evidence for incubation in Asclepius's cult elsewhere in the Latin West, where the god was worshiped in nearly every province.224 As noted in the introduction, during Roman times nowhere in Italy or any other western province does there appear to have been an Asklepieion on par with those of the East in terms of its prominence, with the possible exception of Tarentum.225 If incubation was indeed practiced somewhere in the Latin West, our lack of awareness would be due in part to such factors as the tendency of Latin dedicatory inscriptions to be less detailed than comparable Greek texts and the tendency of Latin authors who discussed religious practices to focus on Rome and the rest of Italy. In light of the lack of any sort of evidence for incubation at Asklepieia located somewhere other than Rome, it is at best possible to conclude that Asclepius in the Latin West was a healer?a healer whose modus operandi was not recorded. Asclepius's Other Functions. As is indicated by the three Latin dedications made in compliance with the god's commands, as well as similar divinely inspired inscriptions from other sites, Ascle pius took an immediate interest in the lives of his worshipers?even when they weren't ailing. In 220Jul. Obs. 43,46,53; cf. Jul. Obs. 34,36 and Livy 27.37.7. See Le Bonniec 1958, 451-455 and Spaeth 1996, 11-12, 103-104. 221 For what little is known of the cult's hierarchy, see pp. 121-122. The possibility that Festus was referring to the Esquiline Asklepieion, which evidently was frequented by Greeks, cannot be excluded, but the passage does seem to indicate the Tiber Island site instead. 222 D. Degrassi cites Festus in addition to epigraphical evidence in concluding that at the Tiber Island Asklepieion, "molto praticata doveva esservi Vincubatio, come ad Epid auro" (D. Degrassi, LTUR, op. cit., 1:22; cf. Degrassi 1986, 149). The same conclusion was reached by Musial indepen dently (Musial 1992a, 39; Musial 1992b, 77). 223 Passio SS. Quat. Cor. 22 (see n. 69). 224 See Renberg 2006. The well-preserved Asklepieion at Agrigentum features a structure that has reasonably been identified as an abaton, but the site appears to have stopped functioning by the Roman period (see De Miro 2003,73-88). On Tarentum, see n. 2.</page><page sequence="49">PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE CULT OF ASCLEPIUS AT ROME 135 the case of the dedication made ex iusso numinis dei for the emperors' health (cat. no. 32), it is clear that Asclepius was thought to have contacted a soldier on a matter altogether unrelated to his personal health, and it is quite possible that the other two dedications prompted by Asclepius could have been associated with issues that likewise had nothing to do with any health problems. The Epidaurian steles, among the earliest inscribed documents from Asclepius's cult, reveal the god not only to have miraculously healed afflicted individuals who visited his sanctuary but to have repaired a broken cup, found a lost child, taught a winning wrestling move, and revealed the location of buried treasure.226 Literary and epigraphical sources echo the testimonies, assigning to Asclepius a number of other responsibilities quite unrelated to his medical practice. In Rome, this is most strikingly demonstrated by the dedication to Asclepius and Hygieia thanking them for blessing a couple s bean business in an unspecified manner (cat. no. 15), as well as the dedication by an imperial freedman and his family "for their improved lot" (ob Processus suos) (cat. no. 18), a phrase perhaps suggesting some sort of commercial or professional success. Further evidence of the god's role in promoting prosperity is represented by the dedication of a statue of Asclepius to the genius horreorum Seianorum by a father and son who presumably worked at this warehouse complex (cat. no. 21) and possibly by a relief linked to the headquarters of an imperial corpus pistorum (cat. no. 30). As the dedication by the freedman and his family demonstrates, Asclepius was a god who cared for families as well as individuals: it is no surprise, then, that Asclepius was among the gods worshiped at domestic shrines excavated in Pompeii and Herculaneum.227 Thus Asclepius, a god primarily associated with maintaining and restoring personal health, could serve as the protector and benefactor of an entire household. Asclepius's role of guardian of the household had its roots in Greece but appears to have become especially important by Roman times, as is demonstrated by the wealth of dedications erected on behalf of the well-being of entire families.228 Asclepius's role of protector extended beyond the private individual and household, to the emperor and imperial household and those serving in the military. In addition to the dedication made by a soldier "with the Augustuses being safe" (salvis Augustis) (cat. no. 32), Asclepius is seen as protector of the emperors' welfare in three other dedications from Rome: the statue of Asclepius Conservator Augustorum erected at the headquarters of the Collegium fabrum tignariorum (cat. no. 23);229 the dedication to Asclepius and Salus Aug(ustaAusti) commissioned for the numen domus AugustaelAugusti by the members of the funerary association at the Praedia Galbana, many of whom were imperial freedmen or slaves (cat. no. 14); and the altar found in Trastevere that possibly originated at the Castra Ravennatium or some other military site and appears to have been commis sioned by military personnel for the health and well-being (pro salute) of Alexander Severus and Iulia Mamaea (cat. no. 28). Certain emperors were especially devoted to Asclepius, among them Antoninus Pius, during whose reign Asclepius's cult appears to have been very much in vogue at 226 IG 42.1:121, lines 79-89 (cup); IG 42.1:122, lines 19-26 (child), 50-55 (wrestling move); IG 42.1:123, lines 8-21 (treasure). 227 See Bakker 1994, 41, n. 90 and Catalano 2002, 165, 176. 228 For Asclepius's role as protector of families and his involvement in various aspects of daily life in the Greek East, see Edelstein, Asclepius 2:104; for his specific role of preserver?as opposed to restorer?of health, see Edelstein, Asclepius 2:182. Exemplifying a flaw found throughout their impressive study, the Edelsteins overlooked much of the epigraphical evidence in their brief discussions of these issues, since they preferred to draw on the relatively small group of lengthy and descriptive texts rather than the more numerous dedications to Asclepius that are terse and less informative. But even short texts, especially when studied collectively, can be quite revealing. 229 The role of conservator Augustorum was more commonly assigned to Jupiter (see Diz. Ep. 2.1 (1961) 607-608, s.v. "Conservator").</page><page sequence="50">136 GIL H. RENBERG Rome.230 The importance of Asclepius to this emperor is indicated indirectly by the profusion of dedications and other cult-related objects during his reign, but is also evident in the Lex collegi Aesculapi et Hygiae inscribed in A.D. 153 (cat. no. 11). According to this document, the association held the most important of its annual feast days on 19 September, the emperor's birthday, and did so not at its schola but at the Templum Divorum in the Campus Martius?a clear sign that the col legium, which included imperial freedmen of previous emperors among its members, was dedicated to the ruler cult as well as the cult of Asclepius and Hygieia.231 As noted above, military personnel represent the largest identifiable group of Asclepius 's worshipers in terms of vocation.232 Some of their dedications were made primarily for their personal benefit, as was the case with the dedication to Asclepius made by a veteran of the Praetorian Guard for an unspecified reason (cat. no. 13) and the dedication of the decurio equitum singularium who sought his own well-being as well as that of his household and the army doctor who helped him regain his health (cat. no. 12). Those serving in the military also made dedications collectively, as is seen in the two dedications to Asclepius Zimidrenus commissioned by Thracians serving in the Praetorian Guard (cat. nos. 25,26). The dedication to Asclepius from Trastevere, which appears to have been for the well-being of Alexander Severus and Iulia Mamaea, likewise was commissioned by a group that was possibly led by an optio convalescentium (cat. no. 28), whereas the one made "with the Augustuses being safe" was dedicated by a lone, lowly miles in the eleventh urban cohort (cat. no. 32). That Asclepius was sought as a protector of soldiers' well-being is demonstrated in particular by three dedications. One of these, by the medicus of a Praetorian cohort, was dedicated to Asclepius expressly for "the well-being of his comrades" {salus commilitonum) (cat. no. 24). The other two dedications were made by individuals who had just been honorably discharged from their units (missi honesta missione), both in fulfillment of vows: evidently these soldiers had promised Asclepius that they would honor him with gifts and offerings if he ensured that they survived their tours of duty (cat. nos. 20,27). Asclepius's worship by soldiers in Rome is also indicated by the Passio SS. Quattuor Coronatorum, which records the tradition that Diocletian restored the Esquiline temple of Asclepius and then "ordered that all of the services, especially the soldiers of the urban prefecture, be compelled to approach the statue of Asclepius with sacrifices and to offer incense."233 4. Conclusion As is indicated by literary, epigraphical, and archaeological evidence, Asclepius in Rome was a god who took a close interest in people's welfare and was the subject of widespread veneration among both foreign-born and native-born individuals. Heretofore the focus on his cult has centered on his Tiber Island sanctuary, but it is clear that those who wished to worship him were never too far away from an alternative shrine or sanctuary. The god's original sanctuary in Rome undoubtedly retained its preeminence, particularly as a healing shrine, until the Roman gods were no longer worshiped and Asclepius was ousted from the Tiber Island by the Christians. Though we lack direct evidence for it, Asclepius, who interacted with his worshipers with relatively great frequency compared to most other gods, may well have been thought to pay nocturnal visits to those who sought his medical aid See pp. 124-125. 231 On the link between this collegium and ruler cult, see Palmer 1993,560-561. 232 See pp. 115-119, 123. 233 Passio SS. Quat. Cor. 22 (see p. 105).</page><page sequence="51">PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE CULT OF ASCLEPIUS AT ROME 137 at this site. But as is demonstrated by the existence of the dedications recording or alluding to the gods communications with individuals, Asclepius did not limit his appearances to this one site: in addition to the doctor who received advice from Asclepius?advice unlikely to have been received at a sanctuary since it involved warding off illness rather than treating it?worshipers could receive messages from Asclepius that were unrelated to their health, as appears to have been the case when the soldier serving in the eleventh urban cohort received a command to make a dedication for the well-being of the emperors. Such inscriptions reveal that Asclepius was thought to be in direct contact with at least some of his worshipers, while the inscriptions referring to his various remark able feats and positive impacts on his worshipers' lives indicate that his presence was felt even when he had not communicated a specific message. Asclepius's cult in Rome, therefore, is not just noteworthy because he was installed there by the senate for the immediate benefit of the Roman state and eventual benefit of generations of ailing inhabitants, but also because he was installed by military personnel at their shrines and by private worshipers at their workplaces, guild headquarters, funerary associations, and, most likely, neighborhood and household shrines. As a god worshiped throughout Rome by groups and individuals seeking a range of benefactions, Asclepius played an important role in Roman religion?a much greater role than has previously been recognized. 5. Catalogue of Inscriptions Relating to the Worship of Asclepius in Rome Note: As discussed above (see n. 3), Paola Tassini has previously produced a catalogue of Asclepius inscriptions from the Latin West, including Rome, in her unpublished doctoral thesis. This work is especially valuable because she personally examined all of the inscriptions from Rome that are available for study and in several cases produced new readings or provided other information not previously in print. Since her work is unpublished, I have decided to base my own texts only on available editions and studies, but have noted all of her autopsy-based findings. Furthermore, I have not attempted to provide a full bibliography for these inscriptions (as does Tassini and as will the next fascicle o/CIL 6 currently wnder preparation by Silvio Panciera), preferring to cite only those studies directly relevant to my discussions in the present work.

(see note) Provenience or Secondary Context: Seen at S. Bartolomeo on Tiber Island (Lanciani, StSc 1:16) Topographical Analysis: While this inscription was found at S. Bartolomeo, the medieval church believed to occupy the site of the Asklepieion, it could have originated somewhere on the island beyond the sanctuary's perimeter, where money from the god's stips might also have been used for construction (see nn. 39,59).

Notes: If this inscription is indeed linked to the monumentalization of the Tiber Island (see Degrassi 1987, 525-526), it would date to the late republic. In his discussion of this inscription (CIL 1:1105), Theodore Mommsen proposed that the name in line 1 be restored [V]al[eriu]s, which would make this aedilis a member of the powerful Valerii Flacci family (see RE 8A.1 [1955] 4-39, s.v. "Valerius 162-82"; cf. Hayne 1978). As was suggested by D. Degrassi, he may have been the Lucius Valerius Flaccus defended by Cicero, perhaps serving as aedile in 66 B.c., a year for which no curule aedile is known (see Degrassi 1987,526). This date, however, needs to be reconciled with Leonie Hayne's earlier suggestion that Flaccus spent the year 66 B.c. serving under Metellus Creticus and then joining Pompey in the East (Hayne 1978, 230). Cat. No. 5 Date: A.D. 24 (see note) Provenience or Secondary Context: Seen at S. Bartolomeo on Tiber Island (Lanciani, StSc 5:277) Topographical Analysis: This dedication to Asclepius Augustus was commissioned by a minister vici and provides a compital year, and therefore it most likely was erected at a shrine in the vicus Censori (see n. 33), the island's lone vicus, located just north of the sanctuary (see Lanciani, FUR, pi. 28, reproduced above as fig. 2).

Notes: These four testimonies once belonged to a much larger document, as is indicated by the tablet being broken at the top and the ends of lines 11 and 13 being followed by letters that represent traces of a second column of text. The date of the inscription can be surmised from internal and paleographical evidence. The first surviving testimony refers to a recovery that oc curred "during the time of our August emperor Antoninus" (lines 5-6, S7il to? X??aaxou rjfxcov ?vto)V?ivo?), either the reign of Antoninus Pius (a.D. 138-161) or Caracalla (a.D. 211-217). The inscription was almost certainly commissioned during the reign of this "Antoninus," since the effusive claim that "living miracles were occurring" (line 5, ^coaai aQ?xal ?y?vovxo) under a certain emperor is less likely to have been made once that emperor had been replaced. Moretti dates the inscription to the third century on paleographical grounds, and Guarducci concurs with this assessment, assigning the inscription to the reign of Caracalla, whose veneration for the god was well known (Guarducci 1978, 161; for Caracalla and Asclepius, see n. 179). Cat. No. 7 Date: Late III or early II B.c. Provenience or Secondary Context: Unknown Topographical Analysis: This dedication can be assigned to the Tiber Island sanctuary based on both the lack of evidence for any other cult sites of Asclepius in Rome before the imperial pe riod and the similarity of the inscription to those on the three bases known to have been found in the Tiber (cat. nos. 1-3). Furthermore, as noted by Tassini, when seen by D. Vaglieri it was in the possession of Dr. Luigi Sambon, who also owned numerous terracota votives from the Tiber (Tassini 1995-1996, 13-14; on Dr. Sambon, see Pensabene 1980, 6, n. 7).

Note: Paleographical evidence indicates that Text A slightly precedes Text B in date. The earlier epigram, composed in Doric dialect, may have been a conscious imitation of the dedicatory poem accompanying the original statue by the Hellenistic sculptor Boethos, which Nikomedes could have seen at one of the major Asklepieia in the East, perhaps Cos (see IGUR 1, p. 86; cf.

The group responsible for the dedication and the origin of their name are both unknown: Moretti has plausibly but inconclusively proposed that it was a minor medical school (Moretti 1989, 11), while others have sought to link the name to the Tripolitanian tribe named Arzuges, which may be incorrect (see Kajanto 1966, 46).

Clemente and Via La bicana, near the Baths of Trajan</page><page sequence="56">142 GIL H. RENBERG Topographical Analysis: This dedication was found too far from S. Martino ai Monti, the presumed site of the Esquiline Asklepieion, for it to be attributed to the sanctuary with certainty, but nevertheless it was found close enough that this site represents the most likely point of origin, especially since the Via Labicana runs at the base of the Oppian and thus is downhill from S. Martino. Moretti was the first to attribute it to the Esquiline sanctuary, albeit reluctantly, and unlike cat. nos. 8 and 9 he did not cite it as primary evidence for the site's existence (IGUR l,p. 84).

Note: The dedicant may be the same individual who is named in an epitaph (CIL 6:10647 + add. pp. 3506,3910) and is possibly named in a damage list of members of a collegium (CIL 6:32429d), as Tassini points out (Tassini 1995-1996,26). Area of the Via Appia and Via Latina Cat. No. 11 Date: a d. 153 Provenience or Secondary Context: Unknown Topographical Analysis: This inscription probably came from the site on the Via Appia where Salvia Marcellina donated to the Collegium Aesculapi et Hygiae a statue and shrine for Asclepius along with structures for collegial banqueting (see Lanciani, FUR, pi. 46). The land on which these were erected may well have been immediately adjacent to the schola mentioned at line 11, as is generally held to have been the case, but it is worth considering that the locum in question may have been at her deceased husband's resting place if this, too, was in the zone referred to as ad Martis. If the latter possibility was indeed the case, the statue and accompanying struc tures would have been erected adjacent to a funerary monument (attached to a tomb garden?), probably that of her husband's superior, the imperial procurator Flavius Apollonius (see p. 109). Either way, the complex in question must have been quite sizeable, since the solarium was expected to be used for dining by the members of the collegium. It is also worth noting that the known scholae were, with few exceptions, located in the heart of Rome, but the existence of a schola of a collegium Silvani a good distance further down the Via Appia from the site in question shows that the location of the one dedicated to Asclepius and Hygieia was not that unusual (see Bollmann 1994, 224, no. 19).

A.D. 150 Provenience or Secondary Context: Found in a vineyard outside the Porta Appia, near Domine Quo Vadis? Topographical Analysis: It is impossible to determine whether this inscription originated at a shrine on the Via Appia or a site frequented by the equites singular es at Tor Pignattara (see note). Tas sini has tentatively assigned it to the schola of the Collegium Aesculapi et Hygiae, basing her argument not only on the proximity of its find spot to the site that received the widow Salvia Marcellina's gift for the collegium but also the fact that this dedication was made at roughly the same time (see P. Tassini, LTUR Suburbium, "Aesculapii et Hygiae schola et collegium," 1:26-27; cf. Tassini 1995-1996, 64 and Riethm?ller 2005, 2:434); however, the traditional conclusion that the lengthy inscription pertaining to this collegium locates its schola on the Via Appia might be unfounded (see cat. no. 11). Moreover, the dedicant's status as an eques singularis calls into question whether he would have belonged to and made a dedication at a private funerary association's headquarters, had this collegium's headquarters indeed stood on the Via Appia. Therefore, this inscription's proximity in both time and space to the site linked to the Collegium Aesculapi et Hygiae may well be a coincidence. It is considerably more likely that the dedication was erected where this officer was stationed (see Davies 1972,4), or perhaps even at the Tiber Island Asklepieion. Editions: CIL 6:19 + add. pp. 3003,3755 (= 7LS2194 = Speidel, Kaiserreiter, no. 31 + photo) (photo: Di Stefano, Galleria Lapidaria, 257) Object: Marble base or altar Text: Aesculapio et Hy|giae M(arcus) Ulpius Ho | noratus, dec(urio) | eq(uitum) sing(ularium) imp(eratoris) n(ostri),|5 pro salute sua | suorumque et | L(uci) Iuli Helicis me|dici, qui curam|mei diligenter egit |10 secundum deos, | v(otum) s(olvit) l(aetus) l(ibens) m(erito). Note: This dedication can be approximately dated by the appearance of Honoratus's name in a dedication to Jupiter from A.D. 153. That dedication was found at the Catacombs of Saints Peter and Marcellinus, in an extramural area on the Via Labicana at Tor Pignattara where the equites singulares appear to have both trained and buried their dead (AE 1951,184 = Speidel, Kaiserreiter, no. 30). While it is impossible to assign the dedication in question to Tor Pignat tara with any certainty, this remains a distinct possibility. Provenience or Secondary Context: Possibly first seen at S. Giovanni a Porta Latina or else S. Giovanni in Laterano Topographical Analysis: It is rarely advisable to conclude that inscriptions first recorded in one of Rome's churches must have originated in that church's vicinity, but especially in the case of this altar reaching a definite conclusion is impossible because it was assigned to churches in differ ent parts of Rome by Renaissance antiquarians. Since S. Giovanni in Laterano is significantly closer to the Castra Praetoria, it may be that Pighi and Smetius were correct in assigning it to this church, despite the reservations expressed by Henzen in CIL. However, this dedication was made by a veteranus, which means that it need not have been given to the god at a military shrine. Indeed, it is not clear whether this was even an option for retired military personnel: see, for example, the dedication to Silvanus Salutaris by a veteranus Augusti cohortis VI praetoriae that was apparently erected not at a military shrine but at a funerary association's schola located a short distance away from the Castra Praetoria (ILS 3566; see Palmer 1978,234). Furthermore, Cat. No. 13 Date: III A.D. (first half)</page><page sequence="59">PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE CULT OF ASCLEPIUS AT ROME 145 it is unclear whether the dedicant's decision to refer to his former cohort is significant: after all, it could indicate that he made the dedication to Asclepius at the schola of a veteran's collegium and thus made a point of identifying his former unit, but since it was commonplace for veterans' tombstones to identify their cohorts, it may also have been perfectly ordinary for them to do so in dedicatory inscriptions regardless of whether their dedications were made at military shrines or other cult sites. Unfortunately, there are too few dedicatory inscriptions by veterans for any definite patterns to be detected. This inscription, therefore, cannot be attributed to a type of site, let alone a particular site: however, if it was seen at S. Giovanni a Porta Latina, at Rome's southernmost point, rather than S. Giovanni in Laterano, it may have originated at a site on the Via Appia, where there is other evidence for the worship of Asclepius (see pp. 109-111). Even so, there is little reason to link it to the Collegium Aesculapi et Hygiae that periodically met on the Via Appia (see cat. no. 11), as Riethm?ller tentatively does (Riethm?ller 2005, 2:434).

Note: A "M(arcus) Aurel(ius) M(arci) f(ilius) Iul(ia) Venustus Side," undoubtedly the individual who dedicated this altar, also appears in an inscription from the aedicula in the vicinity of the Castra Praetoria that listed scores of active military personnel (CIL 6:37184 I, line 25; on the shrine, at the corner of the Via Goito and Via Montabello, see p. 117). Since that inscription dates no earlier than a.d. 204 and possibly postdates the Constitutio Antoniana (see Benefiel 2001, 222-223), this one must be from the first few decades of the third century, as Tassini previously noted (Tassini 1995-1996,43). This dedication, listed elsewhere as an altar, has been identified as a base by Tassini (Tassini 1995-1996, 43). Praedia Galbana (Testaccio Area) Cat. No. 14 Date: II a.d.

Notes: The inscription is most likely to date to the reign of Hadrian, based on the presence of the names Aelius and Ulpius (see Tassini 1995-1996, 36). For Salus Augusta and Salus Augusti, see p. 111. "Caeliolus" Cat. No. 15 Date: III a.d. Provenience or Secondary Context: The inscription was found just inside the Porta Metronia near the Marana brook, roughly where two other inscriptions, a Claudian pomerial marker (CIL 6:123 lb = 31537b = 37022? = Gordon, Album 1, no. 97) and a funerary inscription (CIL 6:2120, cf. 32398a + add. p. 3826 = ILS 8380), were subsequently discovered (Lanciani, FUR, pi. 42, showing just the other two inscriptions; cf. Lanciani, StSc 6:88). If it postdates the Aurelian Walls, the site at which it was dedicated would have been intramural. Topographical Analysis: While the spot where this dedication was found has been identified both by H?lsen in CIL and by Lanciani, it is not recorded to have been found in situ. Therefore, though it may have originated in the general vicinity of the Porta Metronia, it need not have come from this exact location. Moreover, it could have been erected atop the Caelian and progressed down its southern slope over time (with some amount of help). Regardless of the part of Rome in which it originated, this dedication must have been made in a workplace shrine?dedicated to a genius loci or some other divinity if not to Asclepius and Hygieia themselves?or guild headquarters since it was erected "with the permission of those from the bean-selling establishment" (see pp. 111-114). The use of the term permissus reveals that this unidentified body had supreme authority at the site in question, and therefore this site could not have been a public sanctuary or shrine of Asclepius. It also indicates that the two dedicants received permission from human rather than divine authorities since there is no parallel among dedicatory inscriptions for permissus being ap plied to the gods, and in literature it was not employed for divine consent before late antiquity (see ILL 10.1:1549-1551 [esp. col. 1550], s.v. "permissus"). Therefore, while it is possible to construe the awkward grammar of the opening lines as a reference to "permission" from the two gods (see, e.g., Guarducci 1971,278), the dedicants' particular choice of language suggests otherwise.

Line 11: ANTIOTES, lapis Notes: The exact meaning of this inscription has been in doubt, in part because of two possible stone-cutting or spelling errors, ARATIS (apparently corrected from ASATIS) in line 6 and ANTIOTES in line 11. For line 6, Mommsen in CIL proposed the awkward &lt;p&gt;aratis?a vari ant for the more appropriate dative plural paratibus?in reference to the role played by the god in the dedicants' successful bean business (ut intellegantur opes ex negotiatione fabaria paratae dedicantibus deorum auxilio). The better interpretation of ARATIS is surely that of F. Buecheler, who recognized the word as a Latinized spelling of (XQsmiq (Buecheler 1909, 1). Buecheler's conclusion seems especially prescient in light of the discovery at Leptis Magna just four years later of a relief dedicated to Asclepius by a native of Nicomedia aretes causa (IRT 264, cf. BE 1953, 257). The other problematic word, ANTIOTES, was recognized by Henzen in CIL as a misspelling of Antiopes, a Latinization of the genitive of Antiope (i.e., AvTio7ir]c;), who in myth was seduced by Zeus in the guise of a satyr and who sometimes appears in Dionysiac iconogra phy (e.g., LIMC 1, "Antiope I," no. 7). However, since the text was crudely inscribed and the stone-cutter's Ts and Ps are similar, it is possible that ANTIOPES rather than ANTIOTES was originally inscribed. The crudeness of the hand raises doubt concerning the criteria used by S. Castellani to assign an unusually late fourth-century date to this inscription in Supplementa Italica, and a third-century a.d. date appears preferable. Cat. No. 16 Date: III a.d. Provenience or Secondary Context: Unknown location on the "Caeliolus" Topographical Analysis: There is no way to determine where this inscription originated, especially since it could have come either from the modern Parco Egerio to the south of the Caelian or the Caelian itself (see p. 111). Since it appears to predate the Aurelian Walls, this dedication most likely originated at an extramural site. Editions: CIL 6:10 + add. p. 3003 Object: Small base Text: Deo Aescul(apio) | Sep(timius) Martinus | et Plaetoria | Ianuaria |5 pro Septimia | Martina | alumna. Notes: Tassini, who examined the inscription, made out faint traces of an eighth line, which she restored as v(otum) [s(olverunt) Ifibentes) m(erito)?] (Tassini 1995-1996,44). Plaetoria Ianuaria ap pears to have been unrelated to Lucius Plaetorius Sabinus, a priest of Asclepius known from his epitaph, since that inscription appears to date to the first century a.d. [CIL 6:2230 + add. p. 3307; see pp. 121-122). The date of this dedication can be determined from the use of deus, a title found in dedicatory inscriptions in Rome beginning at the middle of the second century a.d. (see Mancini 1980), and the lack of a praenomen. Shrine at "fons aquae perennis Hygiae" outside the Porta Flaminia Cat.

However, it was commissioned by two former Praetorians at the conclusion of their tour of duty, and thus it would be far better to assign this to a Praetorian shrine on the Esquiline.

HORREA SEIANA (emporium district) Cat.

D. Palombi, LTUR, "Horrea Seiana," 3:46-47). (Since Lanciani prepared his map before the excavations of 1911 that revealed the precise location of the horrea Seiana, he places this complex immediately west of the Porticus Aemilia, where this inscription was found, but the horrea instead stood on the far side of the Via Beniamino Franklin near where it intersects with the Via Giovanni Branca and Via G.

Note: Tassini argues for an early date on the grounds that the dedicants were the freedmen (or descendants of freedmen) of the gens Volusia (PIR 5:659-668), which owned property in this part of Rome during the early imperial period (Tassini 1995-1996, 17; see W.

Provenience or Secondary Context: Unknown Topographical Analysis: R. E. A. Palmer proposed that this large shrine of Silvanus, known only from this inscription, was located in the Circus Flaminius, where an imperial freedman named Abascantus served as aedituus aedis Neptuni quae est in circo Flamin(io), according to a funerary inscription (ILS 4997). Since a lead pipe from Tusculum identifies him as a slave of Domitian (CIL 14:2657), Palmer has linked his construction efforts to the rebuilding program undertaken by this emperor in response to the fire that swept through Regio IX in a.D. 80 (Palmer 1978, 238-239; cf. L. Chioffi, LTUR, "Silvanus," 4:318). Palmer did not state that this construction was part of the emperor's own rebuilding program, and he was correct not to do so: the cult of Silvanus was not one in which the emperors are known to have taken interest, and therefore this inscription appears to record a purely private under taking. Despite the evidence of the Tusculun pipe, the lack of a praenomen might date this inscription to a later period.

Note: The stone-cutter did not include the number of denarii being issued, but perhaps these amounts were added later with paint (as suggested by Tassini 1995-1996, 41). Halsey L.

Castra Praetoria and Campus Cohortium Praetoriarum Cat. No. 24 Date: a.d. 82 Provenience or Secondary Context: Seen in the Horti Maecenatis in the Campus Esquilinus or the Castra Praetoria itself (CAR 3, app., no. 14) Topographical Analysis: Since the exact boundaries of the Horti Maecenatis are unknown, and it is likewise unclear just where Iacobus Mazochius, who recorded this inscription during the early sixteenth century, believed them to be located, it is impossible to determine where the dedication was first seen. However, it is clear that it was seen somewhere on the Esquiline?if not at the former site of the Castra Praetoria, then in the vicinity, perhaps near the southern perimeter of the Campus Cohortium Praetoriarum. It cannot be linked to a particular cult site but may have been erected in a valetudinarium (see p. 117).

Cat. No. 25 Date: a.d. 227 Provenience or Secondary Context: Found reused in a late antique wall at the Piazza Manfredo Fanti Topographical Analysis: This dedication, like cat. no. 26 for Asclepius Sindrinus, most likely originated either at a cult site devoted to a number of Thracian divinities or else one especially devoted to Asclepius Zimidrenus. It was one of dozens of dedicatory and honorary inscriptions commissioned by members of the Praetorian Guard, most of whom were natives of Thrace, that were discovered being reused just southwest of the central train station, in two late antique walls beneath the Piazza Fanti and a nearby spot to the east of S. Eusebio, between the Via Principe Amedeo and Via Filippo Turati (CIL 6:32532-32540, 32542-32544, 32546-32570, 32572</page><page sequence="65">PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE CULT OF ASCLEPIUS AT ROME 151 32573, 32575-32576, 32578-32584, 32587-32590, 32591 [= IGUR 1:131], 32592-32598, 32601-32614). Despite the inclination of some scholars to assign them to a single sanctuary of the Thracian gods in the immediate vicinity of the two walls, the fact that these inscriptions and numerous statue fragments were used as construction material suggests that they could have originated elsewhere in the Praetorians' neighborhood, and not necessarily at a single cult site (see H?lsen in CIL 6:3320, 3339 and Durry 1938, 333-334, arguing against W. Henzen, Bullettino della Commissione archeologica Comunale di Roma 1875, 83-85 and Mommsen in CIL 6:720; cf. Lugli, Fontes, 70-71). This conclusion is supported by the fact that some of these inscriptions were commissioned by natives of other provinces besides Thrace?including some members of the cohort es urbanae, who lived and often worshiped with the Praetorians {CIL 6:32601,32616; cf. Benefiel 2001,221-222)?and the dedications were not addressed solely to Thracian gods, suggesting that the artifacts embedded in these walls originated at several sites. This conclusion is also supported by the discovery of cat. no. 26 in another part of the Campus Cohortium Praetoriarum, some distance from the Piazza Fanti, just as other possibly related inscriptions were found away from the two walls (CIL 6:32571 and 32586, found well to the south, and IGUR 1:132-135, from unknown sites on the Esquiline; cf. Benefiel 2001). Since this dedication and cat. no. 26 were commissioned by Thracians for a god worshiped only at a sanctuary near Philippopolis (see p. 118), they no doubt originated at the same site, perhaps a shrine for Asclepius Zimidrenus situated somewhere in the Praetorians' neighborhood. The link between the two inscriptions is strengthened by the fact that the Marcus Aurelius Mucianus named in line 37 participated in the later dedication as well (cat. no. 26, line 3), having become a sacerdos of the god in the interim.

Note: Arthur E. Gordon expressed uncertainty over whether the god s epithet was Sindrinus, Sindri nas or Sindrina (Gordon, Album 3, p. 81), but the use of Zimidrenus in cat. no. 25 indicates that Sindrinus is most likely correct, as is proven by the -oc; endings found in several dedications to this god in his native Thrace that were unknown to Gordon (see p. 118). For the orthographical relation between Sindrinus and Zimidrenus, see Durry 1938,336, n. 7. The reading of lines 4-5 has been the subject of some controversy, owing to the fact that part of the text is inscribed over erasure, and there have been different suggestions for some of the letter traces (see Gordon, Album, ibid.). Lines 2-3 are problematic as well, since the "I" of miles may have been at the end of line 2 rather than the beginning of line 3 (see Gordon, Album, ibid.).

As Tassini rightly points out, the fact that Jupiter is addressed first suggests that the dedication was not made at a cult site primarily devoted to Asclepius (Tassini 1995-1996, 31).

Castra Ravennatium or Unidentified Military Installation (Trastevere) Cat. No. 28 Date: a.d. 228 Provenience or Secondary Context: Found between the Via S. Francesco a Ripa and Piazza Mastai, near S. Maria deU'Orto (Lanciani, FUR, pi. 34; cf. Lanciani, StSc 6:388) Topographical Analysis: Since it was discovered at the same site as a dedication to Jupiter Doliche nus (CIL 6:415 = Zappata 1996,192-193, no. 45), Coarelli concluded that this altar originated at a shrine within the Castra Ravennatium where both Asclepius and Jupiter Dolichenus were worshiped (see Coarelli 1996a). For this to be the case, Coarelli would have to be correct in placing this installation between the Piazza Mastai and S. Francesco a Ripa, which contradicts the widely held belief that the Castra Ravennatium was located in the area west of S. Crisogono (see C. Lega, LTUR, "Castra Ravennatium," 1:254-255 + add. et corr. 5:235). Furthermore, Coarelli's association of the dedications for Asclepius and Jupiter Dolichenus does not seriously consider that there were other sanctuaries or shrines at which they might have originated, even though three other dedicatory inscriptions?one for Bona Dea Oclata (ILS 3508), one for the imperial cult (CIL 6:881 + add. p. 3070), and one for a god whose name is missing (CIL 12:807 + add. p. 954)?were unearthed at the same site, along with two republican inscriptions record ing that magistri of the pagus laniculensis had installed structures at what was clearly a public site, all of which indicates that there were multiple cult sites in the neighborhood (CIL 12:1000 + add. pp. 965, 1001; on the pagus, see Coarelli 1996b, 18-19 and P. Liverani, LTUR, "Pagus Ianic(ulensis)," 4:10). But, even if Coarelli was wrong in associating this dedication to Asclepius and the base dedicated to Jupiter Dolichenus with the Castra Ravennatium, his conclusion that somewhere in Trastevere Asclepius and Jupiter Dolichenus were worshiped at the same site is not unreasonable since three dedicatory inscriptions show that this was the case elsewhere in the Latin West (see CIL 3:8044 [Dacia], AE 1981, 739 [Dalmatia], IIS 4323 [Numidia]; cf. Coarelli 1996a [Ostia]). And since the three dedications that associate the two gods were all commissioned by military personnel and at least two appear to have originated within army camps, Coarelli may be right to conclude that the two dedications from Trastevere originated at a shrine within a military complex?presumably, one devoted to Dolichenus?but it is just as possible for them to have come from a Dolicheneum that was near such a complex but not within it. (For a site at which Jupiter Dolichenus may have been worshiped in Trastevere, though not necessarily by military personnel, see p. 118.) Editions: CIL 6:13 + add. p. 3755(?)

Gordon believed that the dedication on the front was different from that on the left and right sides but recognized that at least part of the inscription on the sides was by the same hand as the inscription on the front. Tassini, however, rightly points out that it would be highly unusual for the sides to bear an unrelated inscription and has demonstrated that the text makes perfect sense if one reads the front and then the left and right sides and understands the date to have been placed on the left side because of insufficient space on the right (Tassini 1995-1996, 52-56). The letters COMVL in line 10 on the left side are more problematic: Mommsen in CIL proposed com(mentariensis) v(oto) l(ihens), while M. Torelli suggested that it may have been a stone-cutting error for cornicularius (M. Torelli apud Coarelli 1996a, 586-587), but Coarelli is probably correct in suggesting that it was an abbreviation for a class of officer (Coarelli 1996a, 586-587). If so, Durry's suggestion of an opt(io) conu(a)Kescentium) of Rome 's vigiles, unknown to Coarelli, is best, although it would depend on ascribing an error to the stone-cutter (Durry 1938, 103, n. 6). Such medical officers are known to have served in the classis Misenensis as well as the vigiles, which may support Coarelli s suggestion about this dedication's link to the classis Ravennas (see topographical note). Regardless of the type of unit in which he served, an optio convalescentium would have been especially likely to be in charge of offering a communal dedication to Asclepius at a military camp or a nearby site.

Provenience or Secondary Context: Unknown; found between the Pons Milvius and modern La Storta near the Via Cassia Topographical Analysis: This altar is reported to have been unearthed on the Via Cassia during con struction, but the precise spot is unrecorded. If it did originate along this road?and its size makes it unlikely to have been brought all the way from central Rome?it would reveal the existence of a sanctuary of Asclepius in Rome's northern suburbs. Use of the term svtoc??oc to indicate that Lupus was healed after convalescing at the same location for nearly one hundred days indicates that the site was indeed a sizeable sanctuary, not a small-scale shrine. While the sanctuary's pre cise location is unknown, the reference to Asclepius as "Paean of the Tiber" may suggest that it was situated beside the river and that the inscription was subsequently moved further up the Via Cassia, but since "Paean of the Tiber" may simply have been a poetic way of referring to Asclepius, this sanctuary need not have been located in close proximity to the Tiber.

Object: Finely executed marble relief representing Asclepius on the left, standing frontal and feed ing a large, winding male cockatrice (identifiable by his crest and beard) from a vessel in his right hand, and Hygieia on the right, standing slightly turned toward the equally large female (crestless and beardless) to which she is feeding fruits from a similar vessel Text: Numinibus sanctis | C(aius) Pupius C(ai) f(ilius) Ani(ensi) Firminus d(ono/-um) d(edit). Note: This individual is also known from an inscribed relief dedicated to Vesta that was first seen below the Caelian in the Orto Mattei (CIL 6:787 = ILS 3313 = LIMC 5, "Vesta," no. 30 + pi.) and an inscription of unknown provenience identifying him as the quaestor of an imperial corpus pistorum in a.d. 144 (CIL 6:1002, cf. 31222). The Vesta relief, dedicated with a woman who was most likely his wife (and a fellow pistor), represents the goddess sitting on a throne, beside which there is a full modius with ears of wheat hanging down and a round loaf of bread resting on top, which suggests that the dedication was erected at the headquarters of the bakers' guild (see LIMC 5 [1990], 420, s.v. "Hestia/Vesta" [T. Fischer-Hansen]). The style and quality of the Vesta relief and relief for the numina sancta are similar, and it is quite likely that they were dedicated at the same site?especially since the Vesta relief also features a large serpent reaching up for an offering from a patera that the goddess holds in her right hand, creating a thematic parallel with the relief of Asclepius and Hygieia (and possibly representing one of the two). Further support for this is to be found in the inscription of a.d. 144, now lost, which had on its sides reliefs of a round loaf of bread and a modius brimming with grain, which more closely links the Vesta relief, and therefore the Asclepius/Hygieia relief, to the guilds headquarters.

Note: The name Gilvius is problematic since it is unattested. Tassini has suggested, not implausibly, that there was a stone-cutting error that resulted in a gamma rather than a sigma being inscribed at the beginning of the name Silvius, but since the sigmas are all lunate, this is far from certain (see Tassini 1995-1996, 42-43). The letter in question, inscribed beside a fissure in the stone, looks like it could also be a tau, and the gentilicial Tilvius is indeed attested, though just once (Salomies and Solin, Repertorium, 186). However, the letter is more likely to be a gamma, and since both Gillius and Tillius are known gentilicials, the name is probably Gilvius. Cat. No. 37 Date: Late II A.D. Provenience or Secondary Context: Unknown Topographical Analysis: In giving a replica of the affected organ as a gift to Asclepius, the dedicant of the now-missing silver spleen was following a custom common at numerous Asklepieia, including the Tiber Island sanctuary. Therefore, such a dedication almost certainly was made at a sanctuary, not a minor shrine. The dedication was assigned to the Tiber Island by its first two editors, Giuseppe Gatti and Gaetano Gigli (G. Gatti, Notizie degli scavi di antichi? 1896, 392; Gigli 1896, 174-177), and they were followed in this by Besnier and Lugli (Besnier 1902, 213; Lugli, Fontes 2:151, no. 48). Since the dedication was donated to the Caelian Antiquarium Comunale by Lanciani during a period when dredging projects in the Tiber had brought up</page><page sequence="72">158 GIL H. RENBERG other inscribed dedications to Asclepius (cat. nos. 1-3) as well as numerous anepigraphical anatomical votives (see n. 20), Besnier suggests that it, too, was recovered from the riverbed. Maiuri, on the other hand, assigned it to the Esquiline sanctuary because of that site's presumed prominence during the second and third centuries (Maiuri 1912,246-247) and was followed by Moretti in IGUR for unstated reasons, though it can be inferred that Moretti did so because this cippus was inscribed in Greek, like the two dedications from S. Martino ai Monti (cat. nos. 8, 9; see IGUR 1, p. 84). The discovery of anatomical dedications from the Tiber Island sanctuary tips the balance in favor of this site but is not definitive proof of the inscription's origin.

Appendix: Asclepius and the Coinage o/L. Rubrius Dossenus Three coins (and one variant) issued by the obscure monetalis Lucius Rubrius Dossenus during the late republic have been thought by several generations of numismatists to represent Asclepius in serpentine form, but the existence of these coins and the problems of whether they do indeed feature Asclepius and why they would do so have been almost completely overlooked by those who have studied the cult of Asclepius in Rome and Roman religion in general.234 These coins, therefore, deserve special attention, especially since the identification of this serpent as Asclepius is in dispute. Furthermore, it is worth examining these coins because of questionable claims made by some regarding their representing evidence that the Romans had called upon Asclepius in a time of plague once again, as is known to have happened both when the god was first brought to Rome and again in 180 b.c.235 The date that Dossenus, who is otherwise unattested, served as monetalis is uncertain but is likely to have been 87 b.c.236 Although he issued at least six other coins, it is the three that potentially feature Asclepius that are of particular interest, both because during the republic Roman moneyers so rarely put this god on coins and because there has been much speculation regarding the circumstances that led Dossenus to do so and the meaning of their iconography. The three coins in question are: 234 On Dossenus and his coinage, see Calabria 1992 (with references to earlier studies). The only study of Asclepius and Rome to discuss these coins is Musial 1992a, 35-36. 5 See pp. 88-90. 3 See RRC 1:78; cf. MRR 2:451 + add. p. 3:183.</page><page sequence="74">160 GIL H.

Though other explanations of the serpent may be possible, the best interpretation is the tradi tional one: Asclepius is represented in his serpentine form coiled around a type of altar commonly associated with this god, which in one case is placed within his temple.238 This identification is preferable to the suggestion that the serpent is a genius, as was argued in the most recent study of Dossenus s coinage.239 237 See also Calabria 1992,68-69, nos. 10-11, an uninscribed variant that features Roma or Minerva on the obverse but the same reverse. 238 For omphaloi and Asclepius, see Kampmann 1992 1993. 239 Calabria 1992. Though correct that Asclepius was rare on Roman coins, especially during the republic, Patrizia Calabria's claim that the serpent on Dossenus's coins does not resemble other representations of Asclepius overlooks important parallels from Asia Minor. Most notably, a late Hel lenistic coin from Pergamon shows Asclepius on the obverse and on the reverse a female cockatrice posed atop a netted omphalos in a manner quite similar to that of the serpent on the three Dossenus coins, demonstrating that such iconog raphy was recognized in the cult of Asclepius by Dossenus's contemporaries even if this particular serpent, being female, did not represent Asclepius himself (BMCMysia, 129, no. 158 + pi. 27, 4) (fig. 13). Also significant is the discovery in Asia Minor of imperial-period sculptures of serpents coiled around omphaloi that were dedicated to Asclepius (e.g., IHadrianoi 14). Furthermore, Calabria ignores the fact that even though genii were often represented as serpents in paintings and other media, on Roman coins only their anthropomorphic form ever appears (as is demonstrated by a search of the on-line curatorial database of the American Numismatic Society, http://www.numismatics.org/cgi-bin/objsearch); and,</page><page sequence="75">PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE CULT OF ASCLEPIUS AT ROME 161 Fig. 13. Bronze coin from Pergamon. Obverse: head of Asclepius. Reverse: serpent coiled around a netted omphalos, inscribed AZKAHF1IOY ZQTHPOZ. American Numismatic Society 1944.100.43256 (photo A.N.S.). Certain interpretations of the other elements on these coins and their purported relevance to Asclepius's arrival in Rome, however, are far more problematic but have gained general acceptance.240 Some scholars go too far in claiming that the warship's prow that appears on two of the coins alludes to the manner of Asclepius's conveyance from Epidauros to Rome.241 Such a conclusion ignores the fact that bronze asses with Janus or Janiform heads of other gods on the obverse and a warship's prow on the reverse were commonplace during the republic, as were coins featuring an ordinary gods head and a prow on opposite sides.242 Similarly without merit is the claim that the presence of both Neptune and Asclepius on the quinarius alludes to the sea voyage by which Quintus Ogulnius's embassy traveled to and from Epidauros?an embassy in which an unrecorded ancestor of Dossenus is thought by some to have participated.243 It has also been speculated that these coins were intended to commemorate (belatedly) the bicentennial of Asclepius's arrival, an event that might have been marked with public celebrations.244 While this is by no means certain, it is worth considering that other issues featuring Asclepius have been plausibly linked to the 450th and 500th anniversaries of this event, and therefore it is not an improbable explanation of the gods otherwise mysterious pres ence on Dossenus's coins. One problem with this explanation is that 87 B.C. was not the anniversary of the god's arrival, though it is possible that the anniversary was celebrated late or that the coins instead marked the anniversary of the dedication of the god's temple, the date of which is unknown and might have been as many as five years after the return of Ogulnius's embassy.245 The occasion of an anniversary, however, is not the commonly accepted context for the issuance of these coins featuring the serpent: instead, these and Dossenus's other coins are frequently linked to the epidemic that broke out among Rome's warring factions as the forces of Marius and Cinna were trying to wrest control of the city from Sulla's faction in 87 B.c.246 If Dossenus did indeed is sue these coins in 87 B.c., it would seem an unlikely coincidence for them not to have been related to the outbreak?after all, Asclepius was a remarkably rare subject for coins minted in Rome, and the other coins that feature him can be linked to noteworthy occasions.247 While there is general moreover, the genii portrayed in their serpentine form tend to approach altars rather than coil around them. 240 These assertions regarding a link between the Dossenus coins and embassy to Epidauros have only been challenged in print by Calabria (Calabria 1992). 241 See BMCRR 1:313, n. 1 and Zehnacker 1964, 744; cf. Rowland 1966,411. 242 SeeLIMC5 (1990) 618-623, s.v. "Ianus" (E. Simon) (esp. pp. 620-621), and RRC 2:718-719. (I have been unable to consult Romolo Calciati, "L'asse con Giano bifronte e prora di nave," La Numismatica: mensile di scienza, storia, arte, economia delle monete 9.3 [March 1978] 82-86.) Similarly, a lack of awareness of the frequency of Janus coins led one scholar to suggest that the association of Janus and Asclepius on the as can be explained by the fact that the dies natalis of Asclepius's temple was 1 January, a date also significant to Janus, the god of beginnings (Zehnacker 1964,743, followed by Rowland 1966,411). 243 See Babelon 1885-1886,2:405^*06; BMCRR 1:312, n. 2; Syndenham, CRR, 109; Zehnacker 1964, 741, 744, 747; cf. Penn 1994,122. Against this supposition, Musial points out that the gens Rubria is not attested until later in the republic (Musial 1992a, 35-36 n. 18). 244 See Zehnacker 1964, 745; cf. Rowland 1966,411. 245 For the later anniversary issues, see pp. 124-125; for the uncertainty surrounding the year of the temple's dedication, see p. 93. 246 For the Marian siege of Rome, the bibliography on which is extensive, see Lovano 2002, 3&amp;-A5, esp. 42. See nn. 179 and 180.</page><page sequence="76">162 GIL H. RENBERG acceptance that these coins do pertain to the epidemic,248 there has not been a satisfying explanation of what these coins might signify regarding the role of Asclepius in the religious reaction to this crisis. According to one suggestion, Asclepius was not the only god whose help was sought on this occasion, but rather the oubreak of disease led to a procession honoring the gods of the Capitoline Triad as well as Asclepius.249 This claim seems wholly based on the fact that Dossenus also issued three denarii that each have the head of Jupiter, Juno, or Minerva on the obverse and on the reverse the goddess Victory and an empty chariot that was questionably identified as a tensa (i.e., a type of chariot devoted to carrying images of the gods during religious processions).250 Instead, however, this chariot is more likely to have been a triumphal quadriga, which, because it is empty, appears to symbolize a hoped-for victory over the enemies of the Roman state?in this case, Marius and his supporters.251 Therefore, these Capitoline Triad coins, as is also true of the Asclepius coins, can not be taken as evidence for public prayers or religious processions, as has been claimed, and the literary sources concerning the events associated with the siege likewise provide no evidence that such ceremonies were held.252 Furthermore, it has been inferred from these literary sources that the disease spread from the army to the inhabitants of Rome?which would certainly have justified public processions and appeals to Asclepius?but, as has been convincingly argued, this outbreak was limited to the two rival army camps situated on the Janiculum and should be catalogued among the outbreaks of dis ease that have afflicted armies throughout history rather than as an actual plague that affected the civilian population.253 The Asclepius coins, then, do not represent evidence for public ceremonies intended to save the city of Rome from a deadly plague: instead, they are more likely to refer in some way to the pestilence that struck the forces of Cnaeus Octavius and Pompeius Strabo as they sought to drive the Marians away from Rome, and can be interpreted as a sign that the lifting of this pestilence had been attributed to Asclepius. Overall, it is impossible to determine who might have sought to enlist Asclepius's aid and in what manner this was done: it is possible that prayers were offered and rituals conducted by the whole army, a portion of the army or its leadership, or even a single commander or soldier. While it would be wrong to exclude completely the possibility that there was a much more elaborate series of activities performed by Rome's religious authorities in a manner similar to the official appeal to Asclepius, Apollo, and Salus to alleviate the army's suffering in 180 B.c., there is simply no reliable evidence that this occurred. Therefore, those who prefer this explanation should not treat it as fact, since it is mere speculation.254 See RRC 1:78, 363 and others cited below. 249 See Foss 1990, 5; cf. Penn 1994, 121 and Lovano 2002, 42, n. 56 (which vaguely states that Dossenus's coin types "coincide with the literary evidence which tells us of the superstitious panic gripping the city at that time"). 250RRC 348/1-3 + pi. 45,18-20. 251 In treating the chariot as a tensa, Clive Foss was following much earlier scholarship and appears not to have considered Michael H. Crawford's important arguments in favor of iden tifying it as a quadriga (see RRC 1:362-363; cf. Lovano 2002, 42, n. 56). The presence of Victory on the Asclepius quinarius appears to tie it in to this theme. (For an unconvincing sug gestion that this goddess alludes to Asclepius's victory over the plague of 293 B.c., see Zehnacker 1964, 744.) 252 The literary sources are: App. BCiv 1.67-70; Gran. Lie. 35.12-45, pp. 14-18, ed. Criniti; Livy, Per. 79-80; Oros. 5.19 (esp. 5.19.18); Plut. Vit. Mar. 42-43; Veil. Pat. 2.21. 253 See Wiseman 1969, 74. 254 Another solution worth considering is that of Hubert Zehnacker, who suggested that the coins were meant to thank the Tiber Island-based god for helping the men whose suffering had occurred on the nearby Janiculum, especially through the agency of his priests (Zehnacker 1964, 747). While Zehnacker might go too far in proposing that the priests had formed "une sorte de 'croix rouge'," the active involvement of cult personnel in aiding the sick, either on the Janiculum or after they had been brought to the Asklepieion, could well have prompted a coin issue thanking the god?and there need not have been any public processions involved.</page><page sequence="77">PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PLACES OF WORSHIP IN THE CULT OF ASCLEPIUS AT ROME 163 Addendum At the 2007 meeting of the Archaeological Institute of America, a poster presentation displayed by Robert S. Wagman and Andrew G. Nichols of the University of Florida and William N. Bruce of the University of Wisconsin revealed the existence of another Latin inscription that appears to have originated at the Tiber Island Asklepieion. Entitled "Asclepius on the Tiber: New Inscriptions from the Tiber Island"" the poster was devoted to several unpublished, fragmentary inscriptions found either on or near the island. One of these, which was discovered in 1892 during the dredging of the riverbed near the Pons Cestius, is clearly linked to the worship of Asclepius by its iconography, though its text is too damaged to include much useful information (Mus. Naz. Rom. 27667). This inscription will be published along with the others in a report on the University of Florida's survey project on the Tiber Island.
