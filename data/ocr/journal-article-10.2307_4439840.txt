<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Author Looks to the Future * Robert M. McClung, Chevy Chase 15, Maryland Why does a well known author of children's books write such books? Mr. McClung whose address is 4906 Dorset Avenue in Chevy Chase tells us some answers to this in his talk-given to the American Nature Study Society in Chicago, December, 1959. You may wonder about the title, "An Author Looks to the Future." Well, I have a confession to make about that. It isn't my title. I was sent a form to fill out, asking- among other things-what the title of my talk would be. I procrastinated so long in completing the form and sending it back- partly because I didn't know what my title would be, anyway-that I finally received a notice telling me that I would talk on the subject, "An Author Looks to the Future." I see that someone else is scheduled to speak today on "Writing for Today's Children." I suppose that title would fit what I have to say as well. But the more I thought about the title given to me, the more apt it seemed to be. As a nature writer, I specialize in animal life-cycle stories for youngsters. When any- one is dealing with youngsters, they are deal- ing with the future, for today's children are the future. They are the coming generation, the generation which will have to cope with all of the problems of the world a few years from now. And these problems-as we all know-are many and varied. Will the different nations of mankind be able to live in peace with one another in the years to come, or will they end up by blowing themselves and the world to bits? What about the threat of overpopu- lation-a subject which has been given quite a play in the news recently. With more and more human beings coming into the world every hour, every day, and every year, will there be enough food for everyone, enough room for everyone? Will there be anything left except vast, sprawling urban areas, with broad, high-speed highways linking them, and maybe here and there a few patches of green? In the face of such a growth in hu- man population, will we be able to save our National Parks, our few remaining wilder- ness areas? Will we be able to protect wild- life from further encroachment on their habitat? Can we save the many threatened species from extinction? Great as the pressures on wildlife and other natural resources are today, the pressures of the future will be even more severe. What of the flood of insecticides and poisons that man is presently dumping all over the earth in the name of pest control? What of the sprays and chemicals used on all kinds of foods? Does anybody really know what their ultimate effect will be? Will all of these problems remain unsolved, to eventually cause mankind to commit race suicide-or will we eventually learn to co- operate with the environment, and not to make war on it? Despite his superior intelligence-or per- haps it would be more accurate to say be- cause of it-man has developed into the world's most destruictive predatory animal, the chief despoiler of the world in its natural state. Can he keep going on such a path for- ever? No, he can't. Many men and many societies-the Ameri- can Nature Study Society is one of them- are using all of their influence to find and urge sane answers for these grave problems. Recently there has been a growing awareness of many of them, and it is encouraging to have them discussed more and more fre- quently in books, newpapers, and even on the radio and television. Yes-men of good will everywhere are trying to find answers for these problems. In spite of this, the ques- tions will still be around-heightened and in- tensified, I venture to say-for today's chil- dren to cope with when they grow up. And their children, too. How can we affect, or even influence any of these things in writing for children? Sure- ly it would be best to try to influence the adults, who have to deal with these problems today. 108</page><page sequence="2">AN AUTHOR LOOKS TO THE FUTURE 109 That must be done, of course. But I believe it is even more important to prepare our children so that they can eventually deal with them more intelligently and successfully than we can. We can do that by instructing them. And the best way to start instruction, it seems to me, is to develop an interest first. The sooner a child develops an interest and appreciation in the world around him, the better prepared that child will be to seek answers sanely and wisely when he grows up. The enthusiasm of a good elementary school teacher, or the interest sparked by a good book when he is very young, can influence a child's whole development and attitude toward nature. So far I've been talking about generalities, and perhaps dealing out thoughts which you may think are self-evident. Maybe so. And what's all this about books, anyway? "Study nature, not books," we are told, and I agree with the real meaning of that statement as much as any person here, I think. But like most epigrams, its very brevity makes it im- possible for it to tell the whole truth. Would the author of it agree with the following?: "Study nature . . . observe natural objects and phenomena with your own eyes ... and learn how to evaluate correctly what you see. Books-accurate and informative books-can tell you some of the things to look for, help you in evaluating what you see." Real enthusiasm for, and appreciation of nature, can be gained only by enjoying and studying it at first hand. But books can help in the development of that appreciation and understanding. And the sooner that apprecia- tion is stimulated in a child, the better. I can very well remember a couple of in- cidents of my childhood which, more than books or anything else, stimulated my interest in natural history. The first of these occurred when I was 5 or 6 years old. My older brother and I were hiking through the countryside near my grandfather's farm in western Pennsylvania. We came to Dunn's Woods, a tree-covered slope which was cleared of underbrush. There was a spring flowing out of the hillside, and overhead a canopy of white oak, hickory, and a few chestnut trees which had not yet died. We were rambling along, doing nothing in par- ticular, when suddenly we saw something that neither of us had ever seen before. It was a newly-hatched luna moth, its pale green wings spread wide, clinging to a dead branch. The beauty of that moth to my im- pressionable young eyes still haunts me. We carefully picked the moth up-I can remem- ber the prickly sensation as it clung to my finger-and carried it back to the farm, shielding it from the sun with my straw hat. After everyone had admired the prize, I placed it on a vine by the front porch. It was still there when I went to bed, but in the morning it was gone. But it left me with an interest which was to keep on growing and developing. The second incident occurred when I was in the second grade, I believe. I was playing in the yard with one of my buddies when I found a large baggy object made of some tough fibrous material. I know now that this was a Cecropia moth cocoon, but I didn't know it then. My mother said that it was a cocoon, and suggested that I take it to school -which I did. The teacher was one of those who had an interest in nature. She showed my cocoon to the class, and told us what it was. While I watched proudly, she placed it in a chalk box and covered the opening with string, criss-crossed first one way and then the other. Every day we looked eagerly to see whether anything had come out of the cocoon during the night. For months nothing did, and gradually the class forgot about it. But one day, when we came to school the moth had emerged. I'd never seen any moth so big, so richly patterned in dark gray, orange, black and white. From that time on I was hooked with a life-long enthusiasm. Most youngsters, when they first become interested in a subject, start collecting specimens of it, if the subject lends itself to such an activity. I started to collect moths and butterflies, and still have a few cases from those bygone days. There is nothing wrong with collecting things-if the enthu- siasm for it doesn't lead the collector to want the last of something rare-such as the last great auk, the last Carolina parakeet, or per- haps-someday-the last whooping crane. I remember the feeling of irony I had, after reading some of the conservation pleas of William Hornaday, that staunch and fiery old fighter for wildlife in the early days, then later reading how he collected a group</page><page sequence="3">110 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER of bison for a museum, when the species was face to face with extinction. Hornaday prob- ably had more to do with eventually saving the bison than any other one person. That's what seemed ironic to me about his collecting that last group. But his heart was in the right place ultimately. And I believe that that is the important thing we should try to inculcate in today's children as a first step-a feeling of appre- ciation and respect for nature. If he gets that, the rest will follow. The whole problem of conservation hinges on a question of values. Is everything put on earth for man to use as he wishes, or do we owe respect and careful use to the world of natural resources-soil, water, and minerals, as well as living things? I have digressed. Back to collecting. As I said, there is nothing wrong with collecting, done in moderation. It is just the first tenta- tive step, however, in gaining knowledge and appreciation of nature. The next, and much more important step, is to see and observe nature and natural things as a unified whole . . . to watch living animals, learn some of the answers about how they live, by direct observation ... and to want to know more about them. Alexander Skutch has expressed the thought better than I can say it: "When we have come to suspect that nonhuman ani- mals may have feeling and thoughts, volitions and purposes of their own, we have reached by the long, circuitous path of the naturalist, who began his career by regarding them merely as potential specimens, the attitude of every untutored child and primitive man, who never doubts that birds and beasts, and perhaps even trees and shrubs, enjoy an inner life not greatly different from his own. And when he reflects that his acts may affect their happiness, bringing them pleasure or pain, joy or sorrow, the morally mature man begins to ask how he must govern his dealings with them." Part of the above may sound anthropo- morphic, but it really isn't, if you stop to think about it. And while none of us want or like anthropomorphism in nature writing, I'll stick my neck out a bit and say that the business of avoiding anthropomorphism can almost be overdone. Animals-especially some of the birds and mammals-can have quite involved reactions. Many of them have limited feelings which might be called emo- tions, and some of them have the ability to reason to some extent. This is not to say that their emotions or reasoning power is in any way comparable to the human counterparts. But they are not necessarily different in all respects, either. People are animals too. They occupy the highest place because of the ad- vanced evolution and development of their brains and reasoning power. Again, I have digressed. What do books have to do with this idea of an appreciation of nature? Simply this: they can help to point the way, help to bring out the under- standing and enthusiasm for nature which is needed. That is one of the three important reasons why I write natural history books for childen. And what are the other reasons for writ- ing? One of them, of course, is money-that stuff which they say is the root of all evil -but which all of us find mighty hard to do without. The other reason is the per- sonal joy and pleasure in creative work-the planning, writing, and illustrating something which is your own handiwork. Of the three reasons why I write: 1) for money; 2) for the sense of accomplishment in creating something; and 3) the feeling of satisfaction in trying to say things which you sincerely feel are important . . . the last two give im- measurably the most pleasure. Most of the books I have done are animal life-cycle stories for six to twelve year olds. I started them almost by accident, twelve years ago, when I was taking a class under Dr. Eva Gordon at Cornell. One assignment was to portray an insect's life history-by any approach we wanted to use-as might be given to children in a classroom, or else- where. I thought of making a poster presentation, showing the stages of a butterfly's met- amorphosis from egg, to caterpillar, to chrys- alid, to adult winged insect. I started to do it that way, and then decided to try something different-I'd try telling it as a story. I started with a farmer's garden, and eggs on his tomato plants . . . explained how these hatched into tiny caterpillars that devoured tomato leaves, grew larger, shed their skins, and finallv developed into fine</page><page sequence="4">AN AUTHOR LOOKS TO THE FUTURE 11t big tomato worms . . . how and why the farmer killed one of them when he found it . . .how a bird ate another, and parasites killed a third . . . how the last tomatd worm burrowed underground, became a pupa which wintered in the soil, and then how the adult sphinx moth emerged the next spring to carry on the cycle. I paged this as a child's book, made simple illustrations, and handed it in. Encouraged by Dr. Gordon, I showed it to a publisher. The next year it was published, with very few text changes, but with finished drawings. And it is still selling away-slowly, but steadily. I like to think that that short book explains some things about tomato worms that children do not know. And I hope that it encourages them to view the next tomato worm they see as something of real interest-not just something to be squashed underfoot. I guess that this is the idea which underlies practically all of the animal life-cycle stories I have done. I aim to portray a familiar an- imal which children have seen, but perhaps do not know very much about. Many nature writers do a very successful job using the general approach, but I prefer to give the life-history of a single animal, telling it as a story. That's a personal pref- erence. I feel that I can capture a child's interest better that way. Animals are indi- viduals, just as people are, and no twvo are exactly alike. A child will often take a personal interest in an individual when a whole group leaves him cold. I want the reader to get a feeling about an animal as an individual. From that individual an- imal's story the reader can go on to informa- tion about the larger world of similar animals. I believe that interest-and accuracy-can be achieved with any number of different approaches in nature writing. And interest and accuracy are what I try to achieve. Along with the story of how the animal lives, I try-both in text and pictures-to show the animal's environment, how it is affected by it. I try to show the effects of other animals, of plants, of seasons, and other changes in the environment, on the animal-and it on them. In short, I try to show the animal as part of a community of living things. I feel that once a child appreciates an animal, can respect it as a living thing with a life and interest all its own, he is well on the way to developing the feelings, interest, and attitudes which are needed to help keep things from getting further out of hand in the years to come. If he can view a snake, or a moth, a fish, or a toad, with interest and compassion, he will want to learn more about it and the world it lives in. This, in my estimation, helps to develop sane and healthy attitudes toward conservation, and the study of natural sciences in general. One thing that should be guarded against is sentimentality. There is no good or bad in nature, except as we feel, and make our children feel about it. There is good or bad from an economic or health viewpoint, of course, but this or that animal is "good" or "bad" only according to our own selfish self interests, prejudices, or sentiments. What I mean is-there should be no villains, and no heroes in books about nature. For in- stance, who's the villain or hero in the following chain? A warbler eats an insect. A squirrel eats one of the warbler's eggs. A snake eats the squirrel. A skunk eats one of the snake's eggs. On and on, ad infinitum. All of the animals are simply doing what comes naturally for them. From time immemorial man has had prej- udices against snakes, spiders, and predatory animals, for example. Good animal books will show how these animals fit into the scheme of things. Some time ago I wrote a book about a rattlesnake, and judging from the response to it, we are happily getting away from the old prejudices. I sometimes get out of patience with the question, when it is put to me: "What use is such and such an animal?" That is the question of those who, without even think- ing about it, consider that the human race has the right to do what he wants with any of the other animals on earth. "What use is a mosquito?" someone asks, and I'm tempted to reply, " And what use are you to the mosquito?" Every year somewhere in the neighbor- hood of 2000 to 2500 children's books are published in the United States. Somewhere in the neighborhood of fifteen to twenty percent of these can be classed as elementary</page><page sequence="5">112 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER science or natural history books. Lots of them are good-plenty of them are me- diocre, and many of them are downright bad. How can a judgment be made as to what makes a good elementary science book? To sum up my feeling about it: the book must be accurate to be good. It must also be interesting-so that it will instill enthusiasm and stimulate interest. Either one of the qualities without the other makes the book fall short. A book is no good, no matter how factually truthful it may be, if it does not interest the reader. It can do actual harm if it makes an intrinsically interesting subject dull. And on the other hand, it can also do harm if it portrays things that are not so, and cannot be so. The really good book on nature-for chil- dren, or adults-must be both interesting and accurate. It must leave the reader with something to remember, some emotion or knowledge that becomes part of his expe- rience-and from which he goes on to other experiences. 1962 NABT Officers President: Mrs. Muriel Beuschlein, Associate Professor of Biology, Chicago Teachers College, Chi- cago 21, Illinois.
