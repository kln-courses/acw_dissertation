Twenty-five important works, repre? sented by large sections from the writings of such authors as Alfarabi, Aquinas, Maimonides, Averroes, Fortescue, give the student an appre? ciation at once broad and deep of the political themes treated by the three religious communities of Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. The sourcebook opens the way to the possibility of an appraisal of the degree of fidelity?or, rather, soundness?in the different transmissions of the common classical political philosophy, if we take as a measure of that soundness the degree in which the defining elements of modern political philosophy are not traceable, generally, to one or the other of the three scholarly religious communities. Helpful in pursuing such an investigation is the editors' discerning way of attributing to the Muslim philosophy and to Maimonides in so far as he followed the Muslim political teachings, a subordination of theology to political philosophy ; and?most crucial here?their account? ing for this approach in terms of the dominance of jurisprudence over theological doctrine in the Muslim and Jewish religions: If specula? tive wisdom was, indeed, considered to be the supreme wisdom in these religions, it was considered so only in the most abstract fashion. The tenuous state of the speculative virtues is suggested by Alfarabi's warn? ing that speculative virtue has no validity if philosophy is incapable of bringing such virtue to all others according to their capacity. "When the theoretical sciences are isolated . . . they are defective philosophy." And because the majority must learn philosophical truths through imi? tations of them ("therefore, according to the ancients, religion is an imitation of philosophy"), the true philosopher is at once supreme ruler and prophet. The greater the power of a philosopher for "exploiting what is comprised by the theoretical matters for the benefit of all others . . . the more perfect is his philosophy." An extreme consequence of this debasement of wisdom was?as the editors suggest in speaking of Averroes?the view of the Christian Averroists who maintained that theology is the enemy of the evangelical law and serves to prevent the "philosophical" interpretation of revelation within the Christian com? munity. The dominance of jurisprudence, with its minute regulation of men's private and public lives as citizens, readily accommodated the celebrated Averroist doctrine that even the truths of philosophy are measured not by that "why" of things which precedes the human intellect but by that intellect itself. There is a fateful connection here with the impassable gulf in Platonic thought (Plato's political philosophy, rather than Aristotle's, dominates the entire approach of the Islamic tradition of political philosophy and of that part of Jewish political philosophy which had access to the Arabic philosophic literature), between the world of "ideas" and the world of "laws."</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 595 Modern political philosophy emerged, as the editors point out, as a revolt not only against the medieval tradition, but more specifically against the classical tradition. One of the consequences of this revolt has been "the narrowing of horizons" within which knowledge is pur? sued?a confining of knowledge to those areas that either are most adequately comprehended by man (the quantified sciences and operable sciences) or that lie within the understructure of the thinking subject. Against this anthropomorphism the editors rightly protest. But a per? usal of these wonderful medieval texts may suggests some alteration in the editors' charge that the revolt against classical political philosophy is the simple explanation of the character of modern political philosophy. Modern political philosophy stems principally from Marsilius and Machiavelli; it reaches back indeed to what Machiavelli?rightly, in a measure?conceived to be the heritage of the classical and medieval tradition, namely, an unreal and separated world of Platonic perfection. Extreme idealism inevitably leads to materialsm and voluntarism. The Thomistic commentaries on Aristotle saved the classical heritage by the soundness of their understanding. But elsewhere the unreal world gave way first to the primacy of jurisprudence over theology and then to the primacy of human reason over its measure and rule in the truth of things (philosophy).
