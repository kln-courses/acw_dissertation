Mk. 25.50 (paper). Ever since the appearance of H. J. Kramer's Platonismus und hellenistische Philo- sophie (Berlin, 1971), the publication of Dietrich Lemke's doctoral dissertation, written at Tiibingen under Kramer's direction, has been eagerly awaited by students of Hellenistic philosophy. For, as Kramer made clear by his summary and use of L.'s work (pp. 137-38, 144-46), L.'s reinterpretation of Epicurean theology, valu- able in itself, also has consequences for the broader issue of Epicurus' relation to contemporary Platonism and Aristotelianism (cf. Kramer, pp. 146 f.). Now that L.'s book has appeared, it is possible independently to confirm its importance, if with a good deal less enthusiasm and many more reservations than Kramer ac- corded it. Of the three problems normally discussed under the heading of Epicurean theol- ogy-epistemology, ontology, and pietas-L. focuses on the first two, giving the last only cursory and unoriginal treatment in a brief epilogue (pp. 99-103). L.'s main concern is to "reconstruct" Epicurus' poorly transmitted views on the knowledge and nature of the gods. This focus leads him straight to the vexed questions of the establishment and relationship of our two most informative doxographical sources, Cicero Nat. D. 1. 49 and the scholion to Ratae sententiae 1 (= frag. 355 Usener). The result of his study is a qualifiedly original but ultimately mistaken solution to the much-discussed problem of Gotterklassen in Epicureanism.' Chapter 1 (pp. 5-22) deals with the Epicurean doctrine of perception in prepara- tion for the special problem of how man perceives the gods. For readers acquainted with K. Kleve's Gnosis Theon,2 L.'s discussion offers little that is new, though when he digresses from pure description of the perceptual process to treat some contro- versial issues, L. often makes (or revives) a convincing case, as, for example, when he restates (pp. 9-11) Apelt's neglected arguments in favor of the three-dimension- ality of images, or when he criticizes (p. 17) Furley's recent attempt to exclude the applicability of the term kirt$oXt to the problem of perception. On the other hand, the treatment given the Canonic (pp. 19-22) is oversimplified, and needs to be supplemented by Rist's more detailed analysis.3 Chapter 2 (pp. 23-41) is devoted to the ontology of the gods and argues (in my view convincingly) for three related points: the necessity of reading ad nos (Lam- binus) in place of the transmitted reading ad deos in Cic. Nat. D. 1. 49; the resultant inadmissibility of the so-called waterfall theory of the Epicurean gods represented by Scott, Giussani, Bailey, and more recently De Witt and Farrington; and an explanation of the ontology and immortality of the gods based on their being both intelligent and virtuous beings as well as modified a-Ter4pCia. In this chapter L. is particularly dependent on an earlier work of Kleve; nevertheless one feels that L.'s sound and thorough restatement of Kleve's case is justified by both the internal requirements of L.'s own broader argument and the admittedly provisional charac- ter of Kleve's solution.4 1.

Nat. D. 1. 49). Unfor- tunately, L. chooses to approach the problem by the circuitous route of arguing against those scholars with whom he disagrees instead of simply setting forth his own case. To some extent this is understandable-the literature on the subject is immense, and at least one of the views he attacks5 has never been subjected to a thorough refutation-but in general it means that L. must detain himself scrutiniz- ing anew theories no longer held (e.g., De Witt's intuitional interpretation of pro- lepsis). L.'s own case (pp. 55 f.) is quite simple and probably correct. Pace Kleve, man comes to understand the immortality and blessedness of the gods not by ob- serving the continuous flow of Ersatzstoffe to the gods (in Nat. D. 1. 49 ad deos can- not stand; nor can imagines in the phrase infinita simillumarum imaginum species mean "replacement materials"), but rather by noticing that images flow uninter- ruptedly from god to man and show the gods to be unchanging in appearance (cf. Lucr. 5. 1169-76). Taking these physical-perceptual facts as evidence, mankind concludes first that, like their images, the gods, too, must be unchanging (= im- mortal) and next that they must be happy as well, since they are not tortured by any fears of death. If we have followed L.'s judicious line of argument this far, we are prepared now to approach that part of the book for which the author claims the most importance and originality: the discussion of the problem of Gitterklassen in Epicureanism, in chapters 4 (pp. 57-76) and 5 (pp. 77-98). The problem of whether the Epicureans in their theology recognized two (or more) fundamentally different classes of gods arises from an apparent contradiction between Cic. Nat. D. 1. 49 and the scholion to Ratae sententiae 1. According to the scholion, the anthropomorphic gods of the Epicureans existed "on the one hand according to individual identity and on the other according to similarity," whereas the passage in Cicero claims that the gods did not exist as individuals but only as similars. L. begins his treatment of the problem by reviewing the previous scholarship (chapter 4, which is titled "Forschungsbericht"). His careful presentation of the work of those arguing for two classes of gods (Hirtzel, Mayor, Merlan, and De Witt) and those for one (Philippson, Freymuth, and Kleve) leads him to conclude that all views except Merlan's have been successfully refuted. In chapter 5 ("L6sung") L. proposes what he calls a new theory (p. 77) based on the foundations of Epicurean physics and a critique of Merlan. Merlan had argued6 that the scholion is essentially correct in claiming two classes of gods, and that Cicero's report is not wrong but merely incomplete: Epicurus recognized the exis- tence of unique, individualized gods (like those of the Olympian pantheon) next to a second class of "group gods," or gods who are distinguishable only as species, not individuals (like the Graces, Erinyes, and Moirai). L. cannot accept Merlan's theory because, as Merlan himself feared (Studies, pp. 55 f.), it seems to contradict one basic precept of Epicurean physics, that there is nothing unique in the universe (cf. Lucr. 2. 1077-80). Merlan, however, doubted whether Epicurus would have noted this difficulty and therefore hesitated to force ably in his still unpublished study of the physics of the Epicurean gods (cf. Gnosis Theon, p. 7). Rist, Epicurus, pp. 149-51, has also recently approved Kleve's position. 5. See Kleve, Gnosis Theon, pp. 82-89, criticized by L. on pp. 49-54. 6. P. Merlan, "Zwei Fragen der epikureischen Theologie," Hermes 68 (1933): 196-217; Studies in Epicurus and Aristotle, Klassisch-Philologische Studien, vol. 22 (Wiesbaden, 1960), pp. 38-72.</page><page sequence="3">358 BOOK REVIEWS upon Epicurus the conclusion which logically follows that "there could be no unique gods . .. only species of gods, each represented in many indiscernible in- dividuals" (Studies, p. 55). L. seizes on this apparent weakness in Merlan's theory (p. 81), and bases his "new" theory-the same one Merlan seems to reject in the passage just cited-on the very assumption of rigorous coherence in the Epicurean system which Merlan seems unable to accept. Thus, according to L., "of each god there exists an infinite number of copies" (p. 81) and "the 'folk-gods' of Greek religion (Zeus, Poseidon, etc.) are the 'types' of the particular divine species.... Epicurus built the tradi- tional gods into his system by subjecting them, too, to the requirement of infinite number" (p. 84). Turning next to the question of perception, L. argues that man cannot normally see an individual god (e.g., "Poseidon number 38") because all the images of that god "coalesce [during transit to earth] to form a single impression" (pp. 88- 89). Moreover, because the various "copies" of the different divine species are exactly alike, even in those rare cases when the images of an individual god do reach earth unmixed with others of the same type, man cannot know that he is in fact perceiving unmixed as opposed to composite images since the difference between the two types of images is nil (p. 89). Thus, although the scholion is strictly speak- ing correct in positing two kinds of gods perceivable by man, Cicero's highly con- densed report is at least normatively and practically accurate (p. 95). There are two questions that should be asked of L.'s theory: Is it new? Is it correct? The first question can be answered in short order. Despite his claims, L.'s theory is not so different from Merlan's; at most it represents what might be called extreme Merlanism. For, in spite of what Merlan says (Studies, p. 56) about the riskiness of attributing to an author "all the consequences which . . . seem to follow from his original assumptions," he very nearly proceeds to do just that in the suc- ceeding pages of his discussion. Thus, on page 70 he can write that a sculpture of a twin Athena implies that "there are many Athenas in that Athena exists in more than one copy. . . . What we see exemplified in the case of Athena could be also exemplified by statues of Zeus, Hermes, etc." Hence Merlan's reconstruction of Epicurean theology, like L.'s, reckons with the possibility of an Olympian pan- theon consisting of distinct classes of indistinguishable and innumerable divine copies. Indeed, it was precisely this part of Merlan's argument which J. Saunders (in his review in RBPh 39 [1961]: 1262-not listed in L.'s bibliography) found least plausible. By completely eliminating Merlan's first class of unique gods as a theoretical possibility, L. may go one step farther than Merlan was prepared to go, but that step, it should be clear, is not a very big one. More important is the question of the correctness of L.'s theory. I believe that there are at least three reasons why it must be wrong. First of all, in basing his argu- ment on the physical law that "nothing is unique," L. ignores the context in which that law is propounded and thereby misses the fact that the gods must be an ex- ceptional case. For according to Lucretius the reason nothing is unique is that things which are born must have parents of the same kind (cf. Lucr. 2. 541-50, 1087-89). If a thing is born, it ipso facto cannot be unique, for it must have been</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 359 born of like parents. But the gods were not born, as Philodemus tells us in De signis 22. 25-28 (p. 74 in P. H. and L. A. De Lacy, Philodemus on Methods of Inference [Philadelphia, 1941]). Hence there is no reason why there cannot be unique gods.7 This is not to say, however, that there cannot also be many gods who are not unique but indistinguishable members of various Gotterklassen. Nothing rules out Merlan's second (and L.'s single) class of "group gods" in Epicurean theology. Indeed, such a class seems to be required as a corollary to the doctrine that there are an infinite number of exactly identical worlds in the uni- verse. For if there are identical kosmoi, there must also be identical metakosmia. Granting this, however, is not to grant that in any given metakosmion all gods are present in equally great number. To the contrary, the law of isonomia as developed by Lucretius (2. 522 ff.) relates both to the absolute number of entities in a system taken as a whole and to their relative distribution throughout the system's various parts. Thus Lucretius says that the very fact that certain animals are rare in cer- tain parts of the world requires that they be very numerous in other parts. Ele- phants, for example, are numerous in India but rare (though not unique) in Italy (2. 536-40). As applied to the gods this distributive aspect of the law of isonomia must mean that even gods infinitely numerous in the universe taken as a whole may be very rare in any given metakosmion. Indeed, since gods, unlike elephants, are not born, they may even be so rare as to be completely unique in their particular metakosmion. Here, then, is another reason for rejecting L.'s claim that there can be no (locally) unique gods in a metakosmion: the very concept of group gods in one metakosmion necessitates the complementary concept of unique gods in some other metakosmion. Precisely because the Erinyes are group goddesses in our metakos- mion, there must somewhere be a metakosmion with only one Erinys to make up the balance. Finally, L.'s description (pp. 88-89) of the "normal" process of human percep- tion of the gods must also be rejected. How do L.'s images streaming from the in- numerable copies of gods of the same type just happen to "coalesce" during their journey to earth? L. offers no physical explanation of this very strange phenomenon. All he can do is refer us to a passage in Lucretius which is not at all to the point (4. 397-99). In that passage Lucretius does not talk about many mountains ap- pearing at a distance as one, composite mountain (the parallel L. needs) but rather of mountains on islands separated by space appearing to form a continuous moun- tain chain on one island (cf. Bailey's translation). And even granting the point for the sake of argument, what Lucretius would be presenting is still only a description of optical illusions, and not the required analysis of the problem which L. is dis- cussing. Despite the weakness of the book's major thesis, it remains a valuable contribu- tion to Epicurean studies for the skill with which its author has assembled, cate- gorized, and scrutinized the formidable body of scholarship which has grown up around the problems he discusses. L.'s talent is for the critical Forschungsbericht, and one wishes that instead of taking the hazardous course of Velleius, he could 7.

I might add that it was Merlan's failure to note this fact which led him to doubt his own theory of unique gods (cf. Studies, p. 55).</page><page sequence="5">360 BOOK REVIEWS have contented himself to say with Cotta, "omnibus fere in rebus, sed maxime in physicis, quid non sit citius quam quid sit dixerim."
