<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE "BLOODY HUSBAND" 1) BY HANS KOSMALA Jerusalem, Israel The circumcision story Ex iv 24-26 is one of the strangest stories in the Old Testament and one of the most difficult to explain. For this very reason it has always attracted the attention of scholars. The explanations offered in more recent times 2) do not differ fun- damentally from each other, for most of them follow the traditional Rabbinic understanding of the text, which found its expression already in the Targum Onkelos. With the exception of the interpreta- tion offered by one particular school of thought the modem approach concerns itself mainly with details of the text, but for the story as a whole no satisfactory explanation has so far been found. Martin NOTH in a recent commentary on the book of Exodus 3) raises a number of questions, answers them in part or tentatively and sums up his findings with the words: "but these are only vague conjectures, for the passage, because of its extreme brevity, is very obscure". His conclusion, coming as it does after the varied attempts of the past at solving the riddle, sounds almost like a final non liquet. However, it must be pointed out that the Hebrew of the three verses appears grammatically simple and clear, nothing is wrong with it, nothing is wanting. The actual difficulties come from the 1) Based on a paper read to Bible students of the H.U. in Bet Hillel, Jerusalem, February 18, 1960. 2) Select bibliography: Ad.

Most interpreters, even the earliest, therefore felt obliged to read or translate the text diffe- rently in order to fit it in with its context, adding or altering a word here or there, thus introducing new points or ideas. Others again approached the text from some preconceived idea of their own. It is quite evident that the circumcision story is a story by itself from whatever source it was taken and that it ought to be judged on its own merits, but that for some reason or other, which must be found out, it came to be inserted after verse 23. According to the context in which it now stands God attacks Moses in the night with the intenton of killing him. It is true we can compare the story to another likewise obscure story in which Jacob is attacked in the latter half of the night by "a man" who turns out to be God (Gen xxxii 24ff.). In fact the two stories have a number of elements in common. But whilst the narrator of the Jacob story explains its meaning in his own allegorizing way (28ff.), which may perhaps not be very satisfactory, no explanation is given to us in the circum- cision story, nor can we easily imagine any motive for JHWH's action. The pious Jewish mind had difficulty in understanding why God himself should want to kill his servant. In order to mitigate the harshness of the story, the Targumist slightly shifted the accent and made the aggressor a mal'ak, a divine messenger. The Greek translators had previously done the same, but possibly for different reasons. Theological interference never does a text any good, for, after all, it may have a plain and straightforward meaning of its own. Another theological consideration led the late Chief Rabbi HERTZ to weaken the purport of the words, "and God sought to kill him", and to create a situation which is in no way indicated in the story. The words, he says 1), are an anthropomorphic way of saying that Moses fell suddenly into a serious illness, because he had forgotten or postponed the circumcision of his son. This helps him to explain another curious point of the story. There is no reason why Zipporah should circumcise her son. But she performed the ceremony in the place of Moses, because he was disabled by his illness and therefore could not do it. The ERE has in vol. III an article of over forty columns on cir- cumcision, perhaps the most easily accessible discussion of the 1) The Pentateuch and Haftorahs, 1938, 221. 15</page><page sequence="3">H. KOSMALA subject in general. It also mentions our story, but it seems to have perplexed the authors of the article so much, that in one column we read, that Moses had failed to circumcise his son (p. 662a below; that is the traditional view) and in another we are informed, that Moses himself had not been circumcised and that the circumcision of his son was performed vicariously (p. 679b above). According to this view Moses had not been circumcised all his life-a very strange idea, for when a baby he had been adopted by the daughter of the Pharaoh of Egypt where circumcision was an ancient custom. Nevertheless, the view that Moses was not circumcised at the moment of the nocturnal incident recorded in Ex iv 24ff. is held by a number of scholars. Even Martin NOTH seems to prefer it to others especially because the expression hatan-damim must indicate a close connexion between circumcision and marriage, and, indeed there is sufficient ethnological evidence from Africa and South- Western Asia for such a connexion. He is, therefore, tempted to think that the appearance of the son on the scene is a later accretion and that, originally, the story dealt with Moses and Zipporah only (l.c., see p. 14n. 3). However, he makes no attempt to alter the text. A different line of approach was opened up over fifty years ago by Eduard MEYER. It has been adopted by a number of scholars including Georg BEER in his commentary on Exodus 1) and Elias AUERBACH in his book on Moses (s.p. 14 n. 2). This, too, begins from the expression hatan-damim, but takes it in the meaning of "bloody bridegroom". When does the bridegroom become "bloody"? In the night when he goes in to his bride. In other words, the story deals with the ius primae noctis, for which the god or demon or whoever conceals himself behind the letters JHWH contends with Moses, and therefore is about to kill him. Zipporah very quickly grasps the precarious situation, circumcises her son and touches with the foreskin the privy parts of the god in order to make him believe that the mark of blood on him is the blood of his first night with Zipporah. This interpretation of the story is so phantastic, not to say ridiculous, if one tries to picture to oneself the actual circum- stances demanded by this interpretation, that it can be dismissed at once. He must be a very silly god who can be cheated so easily. He must also have seen that Zipporah had had a son already before this pretended first night. Some logicality must be ascribed even 1) 1939 (HAT), 38f. 16</page><page sequence="4">THE "iBLOODY IHUSBAND1 to demons. Besides, the interpretation is completely divorced from the text and it does not explain why the story should have been in- serted just here. Most attempts to explain the story are remarkable for their lack of respect for the Hebrew wording. The student of a biblical text must consider it in the first place as it has been transmitted to us. The transmission of texts has been done, on the whole, with con- siderable care. He has to ask himself whether a text does not follow a line of its own. He has to give full attention to it and must allow himself to be guided by it, taking the text as he finds it instead of altering it or imposing on it his own ideas or, maybe, his misled imagination. The text is the only thing that is given and it should be sacred to us. But even if we fail to understand its meaning at once, it will be advisable to leave the text untouched so long as we have no definite proof that it is defective or faulty. Sometimes we can prove that, but not as often as we assume a text to be corrupt. One more point must be considered here. The biblical books consist of composite texts. That means that a narrative, for instance, is interrupted and something else is inserted into the text, which the writer, or a commentator, or a redactor or whoever gave the text its present form, felt obliged to mention. We do not always know for certain why this was done, but we ought always to try and find out the motive for his insertion, for this is part of our exe- gesis of the inserted passage. Our next step should be to discover the source or tradition whence an inserted piece was taken. There is another common type of insertions the purpose of which is clearly to explain by way of a comment or midrash some unusual term, some name which the text contains, or some particular idea the text ex- presses. We still lack an adequate study of all the types of insertions in and additions to the original text, of the methods which were applied in making such additions together with the reasons which occasioned them. A study such as this would be an invaluable con- tribution to the understanding of biblical texts 1). Let us return to our story and its context. The narrative in Ex iii and iv of how God finally succeeded in persuading Moses to go to Pharaoh- itself by no means a unit - is broken off after iv 17. God had just told Moses that he would meet Aaron, who would be his 1) It must be noted that in recent years FOHRER, SEELIGMANN, TALMON, a.o. have taken up related problems in some of their studies. Vetus Testamentum XII 17</page><page sequence="5">H. KOSMALA mouthpiece. The logical sequence of the narrative demands that Aaron should now come to meet Moses, after God had also appeared to Aaron and told him to do so. But the narrative is not taken up again till verse 27, where we find God talking to Aaron and putting him on the way to meet Moses. A whole paragraph (verses 18-26) containing more information about Moses and his family and relatives interrups the narrative. We must perhaps except verse 20b, but only perhaps, for the staff or rod with which he is to do the signs (17b) is no longer his private property (vers 2), but is now the "rod of God". The narrator or someone after him probably saw that the tale was not complete. A few important things were missing. There was first of all the human element. Moses was a married man: he had a wife and two children and a father-in-law who had been very good to him. He could not just leave his family behind. He went home, bade his father-in-law farewell and took his wife and two sons with him to Egypt after God had appeared to him again and had told him once more to go as all the men who had sought his life were now dead. But the most important point had not been mentioned at all in the main narrative. Moses had only been told to do certain signs that the people might believe him and to go to Pharaoh and to announce that they wished to leave Egypt (iii 10, 18). What he was to say to the unwilling Pharaoh, he had not been told. So God had to appear to him once more and give him further directions. This is done in iv 21-23. Verse 21 resumes the thread of the narrative at the point where verse 17 broke off: Moses is once more told to work the miracles (note the different word), further that Pharaoh's heart would be hardened and that, if he would not let them go, Moses should tell him that his firstborn would be slain. No mention is made of the other plagues. The two ideas, the concern for the family and the charge respecting the slaying of the firstborn, are two different items and independent of each other. They were brought together, formally connected with each other and inserted into the text at the most suitable moment, namely when God had left Moses (in verse 17) in order to talk to Aaron. The fact that God had to appear to Moses twice again, does not greatly disturb the modern reader who is used to reading his Bible, and probably did not disturb the ancient reader either, because good narrative form has been maintained throughout. Nor is there any doubt who is acting or who is talking to whom. Every one of the four short paragraphs 18</page><page sequence="6">THE 'BLOODY HUSBAND" mentions the names of the persons concerned. Verse 18: "Moses went... to Jethro"; verse 19: "JHWH said to Moses"; verse 20: "Moses took his wife..."; verses 21-23: "JHWH said to Moses". We know exactly where we are. What follows next - the circumcision story - has no connection with the original narrative or with the insertions which it follows, neither in contents, nor in form, nor in atmosphere. The acting person in verse 24 is named, it is JHWH; in verse 25 it is Zipporah, and in verse 26a it is JHWH again. JHWH, we are told, is about to kill somebody who is on a journey and now resting in an inn for the night. That somebody is together with Zipporah. That is - to be exact - all we can say. In the preceding pieces every person is carefully mentioned by name, sometimes even where the name might have been replaced by the pronoun, or is otherwise clearly distinguish- ed. The extreme care that has been taken in inserting the various pieces is remarkable, and just here, where the person to be killed should have been named or unmistakably indicated, we are left in the dark. Modern text criticism does not help us either, for the verses 18-26 - excepting a half-verse here and there according to choice - are lumped together and assigned to J1) or J1 2)= L3), the latter being a general receptacle for various kinds of traditional material which cannot be referred to J (=J2), E, or P 4). But as the circum- cision story has nothing in common with the main narrative of Ex iv nor with the insertions 18-23, it must come from a different stock of traditions. The name of Moses' wife is not mentioned anywhere in the whole chapter except here. It is true, she appears in the inserted verse 20, but without mention of her name: "Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them on the ass, and returned to the land of Egypt" This is a surprising statement as one should have thought that the presence of his family was bound to become a burden for him during the execution of his dangerous mission. The main narrative does not give the impression that any such move was envisaged, and ch. xviii, indeed, finds them all in the house of Jethro in Midian. Evi- dently they had not followed him into Egypt and the inserted record iv 20 had to be reconciled by another insertion in xviii 2: "after she 1) Martin NOTH, Uberlieferungsgeschichte des Pentateuch, 1948, p. 31. 2) G.

Besides we have to note that in iv 20 Moses has already at least two sons (cf. xviii 3-4), whilst five verses later, in the appended circumcision story, we hear that Zipporah, who is given here the same name as in ii 21 and xviii 2a, has only one. The story we may conveniently call a "Zipporah" story. Moses' name is not mentioned in it; there is reference only to "her son", though not by name. We are really sure only of three persons who figure in the story: Zipporah, her son, and JHWH. At the time of the incident Zipporah evidently had only this one son. He was thus her firstborn son. So far as the sequence of events is concerned, the story of the circumcision of her firstborn son is wrongly placed, where we find it now. As regards time it belongs to an earlier period in the life of Moses, and as regards the locality, it belongs to Midian, the homeland of Zipporah. It is a Midianite story and has, therefore, most likely also a Midianite background. The right place for the circumcision story would be fairly immediately after Ex ii 15-22, where we are told that Moses had fled to Midian, found refuge in the house of Jethro and took his daughter Zipporah to wife who bore him "a son". Moses spent a long time, jamim rabbim, in Midian (ii 23). It was during that time in the land of Midian that Moses came to know the God of his forefathers who would lead his people out of Egypt (iii 1ff.). We cannot escape the con- clusion from the story told to us in ch. xviii, that Jethro had some kind of faith in the god (xviii 1, 9, lOf.) who had revealed himself to the ger Moses in the land of Midian (ii 22, iii lff.). In xviii 19ff. Jethro gives Moses important instructions with regard to the ad- ministration of justice. Moses followed his advice. Naturally we know next to nothing of the earlier beliefs which Jethro, his family and his tribe held, but the story in xviii leaves no doubt, that Jethro identified his own god, the god of his district, of whom he was the priest, with the god who had revealed himself to Moses. Perhaps the ideas Jethro had inherited or formed of this divinity may have been in many respects somewhat cruder or at least different from the beliefs which Moses came to hold during the long and uninter- rupted experience with that god. Some of those older beliefs may have been preserved in the Midianite tradition for some time, for, after all, the Midianites were not Israelites who had a distinct and unique historic experience with the god whom they had accepted. Zipporah was brought up in her father's house and it is natural to presume that she may have retained some of the older beliefs to 20</page><page sequence="8">THE CBLOODY HUSBAND ) which she was accustomed since her early youth. Besides she did not participate in the great work of liberation (xviii lf.). Customs, beliefs, "superstitions" do not easily die out. The story of Rachel who had stolen her father's Teraphim in order to take them with her into her new homeland is a good illustration. In other words we cannot easily dismiss Zipporah's Midianite origin and upbringing. We have to take her past into account when reading the story of the circumcision of her son. In spite of the fact that the divinity in this story bears the name of the God of Israel, he was the divinity of the Midianite desert lands. As we have pointed out, the Midianite conception of God must not necessarily be the same as that of the later Moses or the prophets of Israel. This reflexion would account for the "strange" and "un-Israelite" behaviour of God in our story, although it may not explain it, since we know too little, if anything at all, of Zipporah's background. We can only imagine that her beliefs must have been different from Israelite ideas (as we know them) in many a detail. According to Hebrew tradition the Midianites were an Arab people or tribe. Midian was a descendent of Abraham by Ketura who had born him five other sons (Gen xxv 1ff.). All of them were sent eastwards. The Ishmaelites and Edomites who lived in the lands south of Cannaan descend from the same father Abraham (xxv 12ff. and xxxvi 1ff). There must have been a good deal of inter-marriage between these tribes (cf. xxviii 9, apart from many other instances of inter-marriage related in the historical books of the Bible), and it seems that they also merged into one another (cf. the example Judg i 16) or disappeared in other ways. On one occasion (viii 24) the Midianites are counted among the Ishmaelites. In the course of centuries even the names of some of them were no longer remem- bered - except in the literary remains of the Hebrew Bible. Their successors and heirs are the northern Arabs. The story recorded in Ex iv shows indeed traces of a civilisation which reminds us of the Arab world. The least we can say at this point iP that it has an ideo- logical background different from that of the Israelites. Why has this story been inserted after Ex iv 23? Finding it here in a series of Moses stories we quite naturally presume that it is a continuation of the conversations and dealings between JHWH and Moses. Nevertheless there is no intelligible reason in the Moses stories before us why JHWH should all of a sudden kill the man whom he had just entrusted with a most important mission concerning the 21</page><page sequence="9">H. KOSMALA lives of thousands of people. Nor does the inserted story itself offer any reason why Moses should now lose his life. His name is not mentioned, he is not necessarily one of the dramatis personae. Only the Syriac version has added his name at the beginning of the para- graph and says: "and Moses was on the way in a resting-place.. .". The LXX did not find the name of Moses in the Hebrew text. Besides we should not forget that the Hebrew text can also be translated "and it happened, or it came to pass on the way in an (the) inn that.. ". We must reject the traditional view that Moses is the hatan-damim, although we acknowledge the good taste of the ancient Rabbis in attempting to provide an acceptable meaning for the story. We must also reject the view which sees in the story an aetiological description of the custom of circumcision, a view which is shared to-day by very many scholars including NOTH and ALBRIGHT, evi- dently for want of a better explanation. Naturally we have to discard the sexological interpretation also, which has become a fashion in some circles. None of these explanations answers the question why the story found its place just here after iv 23. To answer such a question is an important part of Biblical exegesis. Why, then, has it been attached to verse 23? Apparently an obvious link is missing - or is it? The two verses preceding our story make two important state- ments. JHWH says: "my son, my firstborn is Israel", and he says: "I will slay thy son, thy firstborn". Both statements concern "the son, the firstborn". In the first the firstborn is God's: he is to live and to become his personal property and holy people. In the second the firstborn is Pharaoh's and Egypt's, who will lose their life. As Moses does not play any role in the story following immediately afterwards, he cannot be the link which connects verse 24 with verse 23. It is "the son, the firstborn" that does this. He figures both in our story and in the preceding two verses. Texts which have been transmitted from generation to generation - in oral or in written form, that is here of no importance - have in the course of time undergone certain changes, very often they have been "completed". One of the methods of completing texts makes use of key-words or key-ideas. It is true this method is not so often applied in the older Hebrew literature, but it is very common in later times. The rabbinic as well as the New Testament literature is full of such additions, where a word, an expression, or an idea was sufficient for someone who felt the need for "completion" to commit 22</page><page sequence="10">THE ('BLOODY HUSBAND" to writing all he knew about the subject in question. But we have also examples in the Old Testament for which the Qumran manus- cript Isa is a good witness. The study of the association of ideas has been sadly neglected in our exegesis of Biblical texts. This is true also with regard to the problem of Ex iv 24-26. We have so far looked at it from the more formal side; but there is also another point less readily appearant which our story has in common with the narrative in which it is inserted, the narrative of the exodus from Egypt. The culminating events in the preparation for the exodus are, as we have seen, the preservation of the firstborn of Israel and the slaying of the firstborn of Egypt. The decisive sign on which the execution of the divine plan is made dependent, is a visible sign of blood. The circumcision story deals with the same theme of the killing and the preservation of the firstborn son, not with Moses. In order to save him, Zipporah acted at once. Verse 25 describes the sequence of her acts vis-a-vis the threatening divinity: she took a flint, she cut off the foreskin of her son, wattagga' leraglajw, and then she said something after she had finished. The translation of the Hebrew words just mentioned seems to be difficult. Most expositors and translaters, both Jewish and Christian, render the word haggia with "to cast" or "to throw": "she cast the foreskin.....". But there is not a single case in the whole Bible, in which the verb has this meaning. It always signifies "to touch", "to reach", or "to make touch", "to make reach" (this applies also to the forms in the qal, even where God inflicts pain on some one: it is by his touch). Lera- glajw is usually translated "at his feet": "she cast it at his feet"; but then one would expect the prepositions 'el or (al. The only possible literal translation is: "she made it touch (with regard to) his feet", meaning "she touched with it his feet or legs". For many scholars the favourite translation of regel in this passage is "sexual organs", because the word is sometimes used euphemis- tically in that sense. According to their respective theories Zipporah cast her son's foreskin at the privy parts of Moses who is thought to be standing by and looking on, or at those of the god who wanted to embrace Zipporah, as it seems, in the presence of Moses. The one or the other of the two must have been half naked in order to enable Zipporah to hit the mark. One does not need much imagina- tion in order to realise that the whole scene is in either case utterly impossible. 23</page><page sequence="11">H. KOSMALA The meaning of the grammatically simple text is: "Zipporah touched with the foreskin the legs of her son". She would hardly touch with it that part on which she had just performed the operation with the flint, so as not to cause unnecessary pain to the child, but she would touch the place near it, the upper part of the legs. For regel sometimes also means just the leg. Why should she do that? The foreskin still contains fresh blood. With it she touches the thighs of the child and smears the drop of blood on them. She makes with the blood of circumcision a visible sign on the child in order to demonstrate that the required circumcision was performed on him and completed. Had she thrown the foreskin away without making this mark of blood on him, hardly anything would have been seen, for the blood from the fresh wound, a drop or two, would have fallen on the earth. It is important, therefore, to make the sign on the child visible. It must be seen. That is necessary for any blood-rite. When God commanded the Israelites to smear the blood of the slaughtered animal on the lintel and the door posts, it was done in order that it might be seen: "When I see the blood, I will pass over you... and not smite you" (Ex xii 13 and 23). Blood rites often serve as a prophylactic, especially among the Arab peoples. The 'aqiqah is a ceremony with a sacrifice designed to avert evil from the child. On that occasion the blood of the animal is smeared on the forehead of the child 1), that is on that part of his body where it can be seen. The Samaritans have a similar custom at their Passover. They take blood from the Passover lamb and draw with it a line on the forehead of the children down to the point of the nose. The custom has been noted by many visitors in the past. DALMAN records the view of the Priest Jizhaq saying that this custom is of Arab origin 2). This information is undoubtedly correct, but the custom may also have some indirect connexion with the command in xii 7 and 22f. to mark the houses with the blood of the animal, although the Samaritans keep this commandment at the same time, also literally, and still mark their tents with the blood in memory of the ancient injunction 3). The purpose of the blood rite is clear in both cases: it is to preserve the life of the inmates and the life of the child. There is further material in pre-Islamic Arab traditions which 1) E. WESTERMARCK, Ritual and Belief in Morocco, 1926, II, 414. 2) PJ VIII, 1912, 124. 3) Joachim JEREMIAS, Die Passahfeier der Samaritaner, 1932, 91f. 24</page><page sequence="12">THE "BLOODY HUSBAND" helps us to understand other traits of our story, such as the belief that "mother and child can be attacked by one of the Ginn", some divinity or demon, especially by night 1). Now we come to the last difficulty in our story. After Zipporah had made the sign of blood on her son so that the divinity might see the mark, she had actually completed her work. But to the visible sign an audible sign is added, evidently to make quite sure that the divinity will now let the child go unharmed. Zipporah says: "atan- damim 'attah li". To whom is she talking? The usual translation is: "a bloody bridegroom (a bridegroom of blood) art thou to me". It is understood that she says that to Moses. It is difficult to understand how she can say that to Moses - even if he is present. Hatan in BiblicalHebrew is the bridegroom, usually a young man about to marry or just being married and going in to his bride. Hatunnah is the wedding. In some cases a hatan is a prospective son-in-law or a just newly married son-in-law. Moses is no longer a bridegroom, he is Zipporah's husband. He had been her lawful husband for some time, for she had a son by him (ii 21f.). The word batan is definitely no longer applicable to Moses. S. TALMON (s. p. 14, n. 2) has seen this difficulty and although he applies the expression hatan to Moses, he realises that he cannot be anymore Zipporah's batan. He explains the passage in that way that Moses has now become the hatan-damim to JHWH, and he suggests that the Jod in the word li is an abbreviation of the Tetragrammaton. But this explanation is possible only if we accept an alteration of the Hebrew text which has never been noted by the Rabbis. Nor does the LXX draw any such conclusions from the Hebrew text. Besides the idea itself, "bridegroom of blood to JHWH" - and what should it mean? - is foreign to Israelite thought as it would imply a definitely feminine quality in JHWH's personality. JHWH is a masculine god. That he betrothes Israel unto himself (Hos ii 18ff.) is a more congenial metaphor. Eduard MEYER and his followers think, of course, that Zipporah is talking to the demon in order to make him believe that he has just spent the wedding night with his virginal bride. We can dismiss that view. Another solution was suggested by the late Chief Rabbi HERTZ 2). 1) E. WESTERMARCK, Ic., I, 303; J. WELLHAUSEN, Reste arabischen Heidentums, 18972, 148ff. 2) see p. 15, n. 1. 25</page><page sequence="13">H. KOSMALA According to his view Zipporah is addressing herself to the child telling him, that he is now a "bridegroom-of-blood", i.e., a "Bride- groom of the Covenant", for by the circumcision the child is received into the Covenant. He compares the expression hatan-damim to the expression hatan-torah of the feast Simhat Tora, but that expression was not formed until the Middle Ages. Moreover this explanation would presuppose all the later development of Jewish thought on the Covenant of circumcision. It must also be pointed out that the expression hatan-damim has never been used as a theological term in that sense, simply because Moses was always thought to be the hatan-damim. Zipporah indeed addresses her child and applies the words to him, but she is not really talking to him alone - she is saying them in front of the divinity so that the divinity may hear them. The words she utters are a statement, a declaration, introduced by the simple wattomer and the particle ki: they are the ritual formula which must accompany the ritual act. After the divinity had heard this declaration, he let him (the son) go. Here ends the sequence of events described in simple and clear language in verses 25 and 26a. What does this expression hatan-damim mean? It is unique in Hebrew usage, it does not occur elsewhere. We know, of course, that the word hatan - by itself- has been applied metaphorically to an infant fit for circumcision (Babli BB 98b), but the expression hatan-damim is never used to denote the "rak hannimol lismonah", the child (immediately) after the circumcision. What, then, is the hatan- damim? Is he a bridegroom after all, or, if not, how shall we under- stand that double expression? We are in a fortunate position, for the person who inserted the story, or someone after him added a comment to it and by doing so supplied us also with the key to the understanding of the story. If a friend gave you the key to his house that you may open it and enter in, he would expect you to use the key as it is. But if you, instead of using it, went to have it altered, you would not succeed in opening the door. But this is what many commentators do with the key offered to us in verse 26b: 'az 'amerah hatan damim lammulot. They did not like the word 'amerah; they changed it into 'ameru (EHRLICH, GRESSMANN, BEER a.o.) and translated the line: "at that time they called the circumcised bridegroom of blood", suggesting that the expression hatan-damim was at that time used among the Hebrew- speaking people. But that is not what the MT suggests. It says:'am,- 26</page><page sequence="14">THE "BLOODY HUSBAND" rah, and we must therefore translate: "at that time she, i.e., Zipporah, used the expression hatan-damim with regard to the circumcised" 1). Zipporah was a Midianite woman. If our text says, "she used the expression. . .", it is clear that the author of the line intends to point out that she used this expression, an expression to which she was accustomed in her home-land. It was not a term of the Hebrew- speaking Israelites, and we must take the hint the author gives us. As the Midianites must be classed as Arabs we have to turn to the Arabic language for enlightenment. It has long been noted by the lexicographers of the Hebrew language, that hatana in Arabic means "circumcise". The expression which Zipporah used can only be a connotation for the circumcised with a strong emphasis on blood which plays so important a part in our story, for the sign of blood is made in order to avert the evil intention of the divinity. We do not know the vocalisation of the word in Zipporah's language. In the Hebrew text, with Hebrew vocalisation, it became a Hebrew word meaning "bridegroom". The Arabic word for "circumcise" has been compared with the Akkadic word hatdnu, "to guard", "to protect". Perhaps there was, in very ancient times, a closer connexion between the two roots. This would suit our archaic story very well. Zipporah says the ritual formula: "A blood-circumcised one art thou with regard to me" 2), and the divinity, seeing the blood of circumcision and hearing Zipporah's declaration, disappears. The (firstborn) son is saved. The interpretation of Ex iv 24-26 offered here relies entirely on the transmitted Hebrew text, which needs no emendation. The text which the Greek translators had before them was evidently the same as the MT, but it is interesting to note what they did with it. They translated verse 25 from wattagga' leraglajw onward as follows: "she fell at his feet", as if to implore (the angel of) God to have mercy on her son, "and she said: CTTT O o6l TT rr pLTrop0t TO-ro rr7o~ naLou ,ov". The English translation of THOMSON-MUSES 3) renders the sentence thus: "The blood of the circumcision of my son has stopped me". This translation (as well as that of the following verse) is wrong. The translation given in BAGSTER'S edition of the LXX text has: 1) For this translation of mulot see U. CASSUTO, The Book of Exodus, 1951, 39 (Hebr.). 2) For the rendering of the particle le cf. Judg. xvii 2b. 3) The Septuagint Bible in the Translation of Charles THOMSON, as edited by C. A. MUsEs (The Falcon's Wing Press), 1954. 27</page><page sequence="15">H. KOSMALA, THE "BLOODY HUSBAND" "The blood of the circumcision of my son is staunched". This is a possible translation (cf. the clearer wording in Lk viii 44: "the flow of blood ceased"), but it makes no sense here, for the expression hatan-damim rather indicates the presence of blood, not the cessation, which the Greek translators must have understood. The verb a-TcMvaL "to stand" (basic meaning), is frequently used as a more emphatic word for 1voct, "to exist", "to be present", "to be there", and very often presupposes visual perception. Many such examples can be found in the LXX (e.g. Num xxii 24; Jos ii 11;- Ex xiv 19f.; Num xii 5; Deut xxxi 15, compare with MT). "Ea-T normally de- scribes an event of the past, but occasionally the statement remains valid for the present and the (immediate) future (LXX Jer xxxi 11 = MT xlviii 11). This is the rule in gnomic and formulary sen- tences, curses, etc. (cf. II Sam v 6). The Greek version of Ex iv 25b, therefore, simply says: "The blood of the circumcision of my son was or is there (the result of the circumcision being still visible)". The last line (verse 26b) in the Hebrew text containing the explanation of an unusual term could hardly be rendered in Greek at all. The LXX simply repeats Zipporah's declaration as given in verse 25b, but connects it this time closely with 26a: "and he (the divine mes- senger) departed from him (the son) because she said (&amp;O6-Tt £riv): the blood of the circumcision of my son was (and is) there". By this ingenious resumption of the important words the Greek trans- lator shows that he understood their intrinsic function as the neces- sary and effective formula which completed the ritual act. Although the LXX handles the Hebrew text in its own way, it nevertheless confirms the MT and bears out our interpretation of it. 28</page></plain_text>
