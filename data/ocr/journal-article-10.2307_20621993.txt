Whippo2 and Roger P. Hangarter Indiana University, Department of Biology, Myers Hall 150, 915 East Third Street, Bloomington, Indiana 47405 USA Darwin's research on botany and plant physiology was a landmark attempt to integrate plant movements into a biological per spective of behavior. Since antiquity, people have sought to explain plant movements via mechanical or physiological forces, and yet they also constructed analogies between plant and animal behavior. During the Renaissance and Enlightenment, thinkers began to see that physiochemical explanations of plant movements could equally apply to animal behavior and even human thought. Darwin saw his research on plant movements as a strategic front against those who argued that his theory of evolution could not account for the acquisition of new behavioral traits. He believed that his research explained how the different forms of plant move ment evolved as modified habits of circumnutation, and he presented evidence that plants might have a brain-like organ, which could have acquired various types of plant sensitivity during evolution. Upon publication of The Power of Movement in Plants, his ideas were overwhelmingly rejected by plant physiologists. Subsequently, plant biologists came to view the work as an important contribution to plant physiology and biology, but its intended contribution to the field of evolution and behavior has been largely overlooked. Key words: associationalism; auxin; circadian; Darwin; evolution; gravitropism; plant behavior; plant movement; sensation alism; tropisms. As part of the bicentennial of Charles Darwin's birth (1809 1881) and the sesquicentennial of the publication of his impor tant theory of species evolution (Darwin, 1859), it seems fitting to reexamine Darwin's study of plant movements (Darwin, 1862, 1865, 1875, 1880) within its historical context and mod ern relevance. While overshadowed by his codiscovery of the mechanism of species evolution with Alfred Russel Wallace (1823-1913), Darwin's plant physiology research contributed to a paradigm shift recognizing the biological nature of insect, plant, and microbial behavior. Today, plant biologists are proud to point out that Charles Darwin actively studied plant move ments and that he contributed to the discovery of the plant hor mone auxin, but his comparison of plant and animal behavior is often overlooked (Whippo and Hangarter, 2006; Holland et al., 2009; Isnard and Silk, 2009; Moulia and Founder, 2009), viewed as a distraction (Firn and Digby, 1980), and has even been used to imply that Darwin discovered or endorsed a mod ern "neurobiological" metaphorical or a rationalist approach to plants biology (Baluska and Mancuso, 2009). Darwin, how ever, was not a rationalist. He was an empiricist, and his books on plant physiology exemplify this tendency as well as, if not better than, any of his other biological works. By comparing plant and animal behavior using scientific analogies (see Genter (1982) for background on scientific anal ogies vs. metaphors), Darwin was alluding to the materialistic basis of human behavior (Beer, 1983), a tactic earlier used by Julien Offray de La Mettrie (1709-1751) (La Mettrie, 1994) and Darwin's grandfather, Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802) (Browne, 1989; Porter, 2007). Recently, several others have ex plored Charles Darwin's work on plant movement from histori cal (Browne, 2002; Ayres, 2008; Kutschera and Briggs, 2009) or scientific (Baluska and Mancuso, 2009; Ellison and Gotelli, 2009; Holland et al., 2009; Isnard and Silk, 2009; Moulia and Fournier, 2009) standpoints. To add to this interesting discus sion, we present Darwin's work on plant movement in light of his sensationalist or associationalist approach to animal psy chology (sensationalism/associationalism is a philosophical school of psychology that assumes that sensations and their im pressions become successively linked in associations to form the basis of thought and behavior). On his voyage around the world on the HMS Beagle, Darwin was captivated by the biological richness of our world and es pecially by the behaviors of animals and plants such as the sen sitive mimosa plant (Darwin and Cannon, 1959). After this voyage, Darwin began his study of evolution and formulating his theory concerning the mechanism of species evolution. He recognized that the opponents of his theory of evolution would try to use complex animal instincts as evidence of a divine Cre ator to oppose his theory of evolution (Richards, 1987), a prob lem which he considered "sufficient to overthrow my whole theory" (Darwin, 1859, p. 207). In the first edition of The Ori gin of Species, he discussed the natural variation in instincts within a population and speculated that natural selection would act on that variation, but he needed to explain the adaptive pro cess of acquiring a new habit (Darwin, 1859). Darwin reasoned that he could circumvent this problem, if he could demonstrate a materialistic basis for behavior and that natural selection acted upon it. Because he often employed plants to test his ideas about evolution, Darwin used plant movements to test his ideas about the evolution of behavior. 1 Manuscript received 22 July 2009; revision accepted 2 November 2009.

This hierarchy was dogmatized by Aristotle (384-322 BC) and gradually modified until firmly replaced by Darwin's theory of common descent and modification by natural selection (Dennett, 1995). Interwo ven in his scale of nature, Aristotle devised a nested hierarchy of the soul (Aristotle, 1973). First, he held that living matter could be identified on the basis of a soul. Second, the form of souls distinguished humans, animals, and plants from each other. Aristotle characterized plant souls as nutritive; plants ate food and grew. Animal souls were considered capable of sensa tion and motion in addition to being nutritive. Further up this chain, the human soul was deemed rational (Aristotle, 1973). The deductive reasoning arising from his metaphysical defini tion of plants gave rise to logical fallacies. Plant-animal analo gies (Ritterbush, 1964) and plant-animal syllogisms are two important types of logical fallacies associated with Aristotle's plant physiology. For instance, an erroneous plant-animal anal ogy proposed by Aristotle was that roots were like the heads of animals eating a concoction of predigested earth (Aristotle, 1973). Using this analogy, Aristotle created a faulty syllogism to argue for the concept of plant insensitivity. Aristotle believed that hair and bones were insensitive because he believed they were made of earth. Consequently, because he thought plants were also made of a concoction of predigested earth, he con cluded that plants were insensitive and lack active motion (Ar istotle, 1973). When Theophrastus (371-287 BC), Aristotle's student and successor, was confronted with the phototropic movement of plants toward the sun, he neatly explained it as a mechanical consequence of the sun removing fluid from the lit side of the plant (Theophrastus, 1976). But in other respects, Theophrastus did not fully adopt Aristotle's notion of plant insensitivity for he attributed the sense of smell to plants when describing all opathy (Pease, 1927). To claim Aristotle's theory of plant in sensitivity as the dominant understanding of plants during antiquity and medieval times is too simplistic. The personifica tion of plants seems to be a natural way for humans to think about plant biology and formed the basis of Plato's plant physi ology (Skemp, 1947). The idea that plants were sensitive and feeling became entrenched in primitive religions and carried on in classical mythology and popular lore. In numerous examples, the behavior of plants during this period was usually described in terms of human feelings of pain and pleasure or of the emo tions of love and hate (Thiselton-Dyer, 1889; Pease, 1927). During the Renaissance, the validity of Aristotelian, Neo Platonist, and folkloric explanations of natural phenomenon be gan being questioned. Giamattista Deila Porta (1515-1616), one of the leading figures of this questioning, experimented with nu merous natural phenomenon including optics, magnetism, and plant physiology (Porta, 1658; Eamon, 1996). His studies of plant physiology demonstrated plant hydrotropism, and his grafting experiments suggested that plants have some mecha nism for maintaining polarity analogous to magnetism (Porta, 1658; Ritterbush, 1964). He sought to explain plant and animal behavior as products of universal attraction (sympathy) and re pulsion (antipathy) (Porta, 1658; Webster, 1966). Porta's expla nation of plant and animal movements did not require a metaphysical soul because only forces of attraction or repulsion were in play (i.e., the sun's power of attraction causing plant phototropism) (Porta, 1658; Webster, 1966). In his comparison of plant and animal behavior to the action of magnets, we see that Porta believed that the behavior of animals and plants was just as passive as an iron filing to a magnet. Along a similar vein, William Gilbert (1540-1603) also experimented with plant po larity and concluded by analogy that plants had the same form of polarity as magnets and the earth. Gilbert went on to propose that such polarity was intrinsic to everything (Gilbert and Thompson, 1900; Ritterbush, 1964). Although these plant-mag net analogies were as naive as older plant-animal analogies, they set the stage for mechanical and materialistic explanations of plant movement by subsequent generations of scientists. Francis Bacon (1561-1626), father of the scientific method, rejected Porta's far-reaching theory that forces of attraction or repulsion caused plant movements and leaned toward the posi tion that plant motion could be explained by simple mechanical explanations (Bacon et al., 1626; Webster, 1966). In the case of phototropism, he held to Theophrastus' view that the light was simply drying out one side of the stem (Bacon et al., 1626). However, Bacon also advanced other erroneous plant-animal analogies (Bacon et al., 1626; Ritterbush, 1964). For Bacon plants were like animals because they both had veins and canals that carried spirits or liquors (Bacon et al., 1626; Ritterbush, 1964). And similar to Aristotle, Bacon thought that the roots of plants were like the heads of animals (Bacon et al., 1626; Ritterbush, 1964). Rene Descartes (1596-1650) dismissed Aristotle's nested soul hierarchy and held that animals and plants lacked souls (Richards, 1987; Des Chene, 2001). Instead he believed that plants and nonhuman animals were merely ma chines made of inert matter; their movement and behavior dic tated by simple hydraulics running through tubes or pipes, whereas human behavior, in contrast, was governed by a ratio nal soul (Richards, 1987). The Cartesian view of animal physiology and behavior was reinforced by William Harvey's (1578-1657) theory that the heart was like a mechanical pump circulating blood throughout the body (Harvey, 1628). After observing the muscle contrac tions of worms, Harvey first proposed that muscle movements could be evoked without control from the brain or mind. From this novel idea, Harvey proposed that the rapid movements of the mimosa sensitive plant were caused by the same type of acerebral process (Harvey and Lilly, 1651; Webster, 1966). Concurrently, Francis Glisson (1597-1677) proposed his doc trine of irritability (Glisson, 1654; Webster, 1966). Using plant vascular fibers as a guide, Glisson hypothesized the existence of animal nerves or fibers that were equivalent to the vascular tissues of plants (Webster, 1966). These theoretical nerves, ac cording to Glisson, contained a vital force that stimulated the surrounding tissue (Glisson, 1654). Glisson's concept of a vital force conflicted with the Cartesian mechanistic view of life be cause it assumed that a nonmaterial force was responsible for animal movements. Another challenge to the Aristotelian and Cartesian natural philosophies was first proposed by Pierre Gassendi (1592-1655) who asserted that humans and other nonhuman animals shared similar cognitive traits (Richards, 1987). This view would form the basis of the sensationalist phi losophy that would end up having a considerable influence upon Charles Darwin's understanding of animal behavior and plant movements (Richards, 1987). Porta's theory of plant movements and Cristobal de Acosta's (1515-1594) descriptions of the rapid movements of the mimosa</page><page sequence="3">December 2009] Whippo and Hangarter?Power of movement in plants 2117 sensitive plant and the diurnal leaf movement of tamarind plants in the 16th century increased interest in plant movements (Bell, 1959; Webster, 1966). By the mid 17th century, greenhouse specimens of the sensitive plant were becoming more common in England, and the research of Robert Browne on phototropism, gravitropism, and circumnutation caused Henry Power to ques tion the doctrine of plant insensitivity (Webster, 1966). Like Harvey, Power placed the mimosa plant as a transitional link between plants and animals (Webster, 1966). By 1661, the movements of the mimosa sensitive plant had captured the atten tion of King Charles II who directed the Royale Society to ex plain its movements (Webster, 1966), and a committee was established to investigate this oddity. Timothy Clarke's account of their experiments was published by Robert Hooke (Hooke, 1665; Webster, 1966). The committee experimented by touch ing the plant at various locations with various objects. They ob served that the magnitude of the touch determined the extent of the response (Hooke, 1665). They also devised a theory to ex plain the movements in which an ambiguous liquor or spirit cir culated throughout the plant and allowed plant organs to influence each other (Hooke, 1665). When the leaf was touched, they be lieved that the circulating liquor would move toward the stem and cause the stem to contract thus resulting in rapid movement (Hooke, 1665). Because most of the members of this committee were physicians, it is not surprising that their theory of mimosa leaf movement was similar to medical theories of blood circula tion and muscle contraction (Ritterbush, 1964). Just as discoveries of new plant movements were causing some to question the Aristotelian doctrine of plant insensitivity, the experiments and theories of Jan Baptista Van Helmont (1577-1644), Nehemiah Grew (1628-1712), Marcello Mal pighi (1628-1694), Edme Mariote (1620-1684), and Stephen Hales (1677-1761) on plant nutrition and photosynthesis casted doubts on the Aristotelian view that roots were analogous to animal heads feeding upon predigested food in the soil (Ritter bush, 1964). Therefore, as it was becoming clearer that plant and animal nutrition are not easily analogous, the movements of plants suggested that they were somehow similar to animals. This paradox together with other new discoveries of the 18th century greatly tested the orthodox taxonomical criteria for dis tinguishing between nonliving matter, plants, and animals. Natural historians' preoccupation with the idea of a gradu ated scale of nature intensified during the 18th century. Taxon omy was more than the classification of living organisms; it was concerned with classification and organization of all ob jects, both minerals and living organisms, within the graduated scale of nature (Foucault, 1973). Because insensitivity was con sidered the key for distinguishing between plants and animals, the new observations of plant movements and the discovery of new plant-like animals (i.e., Trembley's polyps) caused some to question the validity of such criteria (Ritterbush, 1964). To cope with this problem, the leading taxonomists John Ray (1627-1705), Charles Linne (1707-1778), and Jean Baptiste de Lamarck (1744-1829) preferred mechanical explanations of plant movement (Ritterbush, 1964). Ray believed that move ments of plants could be explained via a mechanical conse quence of temperature (Ray, 1686). And by coining the term sleep to describe the periodic movements of leaves, Linne was merely using an analogy to convey the notion that plants needed rest and not as an example of plant sensitivity (Linne and Bremer, 1755; Ritterbush, 1964). As theoretically inclined taxonomists and experimental plant physiologist of the 18th century debated the nature of plant movements, Charles Bonnet (1720-1793), who was a strong advocate for the graduated scale of nature, broadened the scope of the problem. Bonnet was one of the first to truly experiment with plant movements in a semicontrolled manner (Bonnet et al., 1754). While he acknowledged that the movements of plants might be purely mechanical (Bonnet, 1764, 1766), he put forth two different, but related theories of plant movement. First, from his observations of various plant movements he was un able to obtain conclusive evidence that plants are insensitive. And although not willing to rule out the possibility that plants might be insensitive, Bonnet rhetorically proposed that an un prejudiced philosopher from the moon could justifiably attri bute sensitivity and discernment to plants. From a taxonomic perspective, he contended that arbitrarily assigning sensitivity to sea nettles but not to plants violated the graduated nature of the scale of being. Second, Bonnet proposed another model that would guide plant physiology during Darwin's time: the irrita bility theory of plant movements. Bonnet derived this model from the work of his cousin, Albrecht von Haller (1707-1777), whose physiological experimentation with animal nerves and muscles allowed him to separate sensation from irritation (Haller, 1755). Haller showed that animal tissue and organs ap parently lacking sensation, such as the heart, could be stimu lated to move through irritation with touch, whereas nerves, which were sensitive, could not be irritated to move (Haller, 1755; Ritterbush, 1964). Because the irritable tissues that Haller worked with came from dead animals, Haller concluded that irritability was an intrinsic property of animal matter like grav ity or electromagnetic attraction rather than an immaterial or mystical property of life (Ritterbush, 1964). Although Haller did not believe his theory of irritability could be applied to plants (Ritterbush, 1964), Bonnet asked his readers to consider if Haller's irritability paradigm might explain the movement of plants (Bonnet, 1764, 1766). This idea provided an alternative and attractive middle ground between orthodox mechanical ex planations of plant movement and anthropomorphic explana tions of plant movements. The application of Haller's irritability theory to plants was soon adopted by several scientists as they sought to explain plant movement (Gigloli, 1900; Ritterbush, 1964). When Charles Darwin began investigating plant movements, Bonnet's plant irritability theory was the textbook explanation of plant movements given by Darwin's former botany professor John Henslow (1796-1861) (Henslow, 1835). Yet, as Bonnet was thinking about the movements of plants, he was also think ing about animal perception, behavior, and cognition. Bonnet and others were influenced by John Locke's An Essay Concern ing Human Understanding first published in 1690. In this essay, Locke argued that humans were born a blank slate without in nate cognitive abilities or instincts (Locke, 1959; Richards, 1987). Locke believed that ideas were derived from the faint echoes or impressions of previous sensations (Richards, 1987). Locke held that the main difference between plants and animals was that plants lacked perception, and their movements could be explained in purely mechanical terms (Locke, 1959). Julien Offray de La Mettrie advanced this one step further and pro posed that all matter had some form of sensation and motion (Richards, 1987). By redefining the nature of matter as no lon ger inert, La Mettrie opened the door for physiological thinking about behavior (Richards, 1987). In doing so, La Mettrie was able to make comparisons between human behavior and ma chines or plants in his important 1748 essays Uhomme machine and Uhomme plante [Man a machine and Man a plant] (La</page><page sequence="4">2118 American Journal of Botany [Vol. 96 Mettrie, 1994). Bonnet and other sensationalists, like Abbe de Condillac (1715-1780), would later argue that sensory impres sions had a physiological basis and were comparable to the physical impressions of a stamp (Anderson, 1982; Richards, 1987). The linking of sensations and their physical impressions in a contiguous chain or associations formed the basis of com plex thought and behavior. Therefore, sensationalists, like Bon net, elevated the significance of sensation from merely a means of monitoring the environment to the fundamental basis of thought and behavior. By the late 18th century, plant reproduction and the move ments of flower parts provided a subject of great interest. Dr. Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802) personified plant reproduc tion in complex multilayered analogies to discuss human sexual behavior, plant physiology, and the unity of life (Browne, 1989) in ways that prevented scientific analogy from slipping into lit erary metaphors (Porter, 2007). Guided by sensationalistic natu ral philosophy, Dr. Darwin was interested in the physical basis of disease (Darwin, 1794). He also argued for the sensationalist position that plants were sensitive organisms with a voluntary power of motion or will power (Darwin, 1794, 1800). Drawing another analogy with animals, Dr. Darwin thought plant buds contained a brain that, upon sense perception, caused plant movement by communicating with muscles via nerves (Darwin, 1800). Dr. Darwin went so far as to speculate that each plant bud represented an individual (Darwin, 1800). He held that a spirit of animation, which he believed governed all life, acted as a transmittable influence that moved through nerves and, when stimulated, caused the muscles to contract (Darwin, 1794; Rich ards, 1987). Besides putting plants and animals on more equal footing, Dr. Darwin also influenced his grandson's work on plant movement in other important ways. First, through his ap plication of sensationalist psychology to plants, Dr. Darwin con cluded that plants behaviors were acquired or learned habits (Darwin, 1800). For example, he considered the sleep move ment of leaves as an acquired habit associated with darkness and the need to rest (Darwin, 1794, 1800). This idea would factor into Charles Darwin's early thought on plant movements. Sec ond and more significantly, Dr. Darwin proposed that plant be haviors were part of a battle with neighboring plants to satisfy desires, compete for resources, and to adapt to their circum stances (Ritterbush, 1964). This idea can be seen most clearly in a passage from his epic poem Temple of Nature (Darwin, 1804, p. 157): " 'Yes! Smiling Flora, drives her armed car, Through thick ranks of vegetable war; Herb, shrub, and tree with strong emotions rise For light and air, and battle in the skies: Whose roots diverging with opposing toil Contend below for moisture and soil;" Altogether, Dr. Darwin believed that plant movement, like animal behavior, would eventually be explained in materialistic terms, he also believed that plant movements were acquired habits of associated sensations, impressions, and motions, and driven by the struggle for survival in competition with neigh bors for scarce resources. Those accepting of Dr. Darwin's views about plant move ments were either trying to popularize the field of plant physiol ogy as a hobby (Jackson and Henry, 1811) or were attracted to the notion that the ability of plants to feel pain or pleasure demonstrated the universal beneficence of a Creator (Tupper, 1811). Sir Humphry Davy (1778-1829), a leading chemist of the time, was a highly visible critic of Dr. Darwin's ideas about plant physiology. He firmly believed that plant movements were caused by mechanical means and that plants lacked all sensitivity (Davy, 1815). To acknowledge that plants are sensi tive and have the same power of life as animals, Davy argued was "delusional" because it was generally accepted that plants are only made of "common matter" and do not contain any im material "superior principle" like animals (Davy, 1815, p. 222). In a series of letters to the editor of The Port Folio, an early American literary magazine, three anonymous contributors nicely summarized and demonstrated the intense nature of the debate over Dr. Darwin's theory of plant physiology and its implication for the concept of a human soul (TC, 1814, 1815a, b; JRW, 1815a, b; WD, 1815). One contributor clearly identi fied how Dr. Darwin's theory of plant physiology challenged the long-held view of human superiority and the immateriality of the human soul (JRW, 1815b). This anonymous contributor hit upon a more significant objection: Dr. Darwin's theory was not supported by any compelling scientific evidence. He ar gued, "No vegetable physiologist has demonstrated the exis tence of a nervous system, nor shown satisfactorily that they posses anything like it. Until this be [sic] done, the friends of the Darwinian theory have made no progress in the establish ment of their hypothesis" (JRW, 1815b, p. 245). As we will discuss, Charles Darwin modified his grandfather's controver sial "Darwinian theory" and presented even more controversial experimental results that showed that even organisms lacking neurons could display complex responses to the environment. From his experiments about root gravitropism and twining plants, Thomas Knight (1759-1838) could not find any evi dence supporting Dr. Darwin's theory of plant movements (Knight, 1806, 1812). In stark contrast to Dr. Darwin, Knight argued that the movement of plant organs was simply mechani cal in nature and considered gravitropism to be caused by the force of gravity pulling the root down by its own weight (Knight, 1806). Throughout the 19th century, plant physiologists were attracted to parsimonious mechanical explanations, yet their experiments usually failed to validate their simple mechanical theories. As a scientist who believed that plants were excitable, Augustin Pyrame de Candolle (1778-1841) threaded the needle in a way that acknowledged the biological nature of plant move ment but denied any type of adaptive or active response to the environment. He considered the bending movement of plants toward light as a passive developmental outcome rather than a passive mechanical consequence of light or gravity acting on plants (Candolle, 1832). He proposed that light causes the illu minated side of the shoot to mature faster and thus grow more slowly than the vigorously growing immature tissue on the shaded side (Candolle, 1832). Knight's previous discovery of negative phototropism (Knight, 1812) and Henri Dutrochet's (1776-1847) observation that cutting a phototropically bent Medicago sativa L. seedling along the longitudinal axis resulted in straightening of the shaded flank of the seedling and contin ued phototropic bending of the illuminated flank suggested that Candolle's theory was an insufficient explanation of phototro pism (Dutrochet, 1837). Although Dutrochet believed that plants were sensitive, he also held the traditional view that plant movements were passive and could be explained by simple physics. He first introduced the idea that the movement of plant organs was due to changes in cell turgor by forward and reverse osmosis. More importantly, Dutrochet suggested that the envi ronment triggered plant movement, instead of mechanically providing the energy of motion (Dutrochet, 1824).</page><page sequence="5">December 2009] Whippo and Hangarter?Power of movement in plants 2119 Themes and variations of Knight's mechanical, Candolle's developmental, and Dutrochet's osmotic explanations of plant movement remained common through the mid 19th century. These passive explanations of plant movement continued being tested and refined by Julius Von Wiesner (1838-1916) in Aus tria and Julius Von Sachs (1832-1897) in Germany, who to gether with their students began the professionalization and academic study of plant physiology that we see today (Harvey, 1929; Linsbauer, 1937). Four major areas focused the direction of their research concerning plant movements during this pe riod: the relationship between cell wall extensibility and cell turgor on the growth and movement of plants, the interaction of gravitropism and phototropism in horizontally growing organs, determining whether the amount of movement was proportional to the amount of stimulus, and determining whether plant move ments were active responses to the environment or a passive consequence of light or gravity acting on the plant (Sachs, 1875; Sachs and Vines, 1882; Green, 1909). Collectively the results of Sachs, Wiesner, and their students suggested that plant move ment was more complicated than a simple direct mechanical effect of light, gravity, or touch upon plant growth and, thus, plant movements represented a form of irritability (Green, 1909). From his microcopy work, Sachs suspected that the ex ternal environment affected the subcellular organization of all living plant tissues (Sachs, 1875; Green, 1909). Therefore, Sachs thought that irritability occurred in all plant cells to a degree (Sachs and Vines, 1882; Sachs and Ward, 1887) and that plant irritability could be compared to animal irritability (Sachs, 1879). However, Sachs and Wienser did not accept the notion that plant sensitivity resides in a specialized set of cells analo gous to animal eyes, noise, ears, brain, etc., and did not fully recognize the capacity of plants to actively adjust to their environment (Green, 1909). At the same time these professional plant physiologists were vigorously seeking a materialistic and physiological explanation of plant movement, Charles Darwin and his son Francis began addressing a different set of ques tions about the evolution of biological behavior. But before finally turning our full attention to Charles Dar win's work on plant movement, we need to briefly introduce the field of animal behavior during his time. For those interested in a more in-depth discussion of this topic, we refer our readers to Robert Richard's (1987) Darwin and the Emergence of Evolu tionary Theories of Mind and Behavior for an excellent discus sion of Darwin's approach to understanding behavior. Following sensationalist natural philosophy, Lamarck thought that the mechanism of species evolution was caused in part by habitual use or disuse. Young Charles Darwin took this behavioral the ory of evolution as a starting point for his thinking (Richards, 1987). Because sensing was the basis of behavior for sensation alists, they had no need for a theory of the mind. Behaviors and cognitive traits could be explained through the organization of matter by way of impressions and associations. While on the voyage on the HMS Beagle, Darwin read On the Power, Wis dom and Goodness of God as Manifested in the Creation of Animals and in their History, Habits, and Instincts by Reverend William Kirby (Kirby, 1835; Richards, 1987). Kirby, who was a natural theologian and eminent entomologist, believed that the intricate instincts of animals pointed to a divine Creator, and yet Kirby thought they could also be explained by physical means (i.e., God acting through everyday physics) (Kirby, 1835; Richards, 1987). Kirby's rationale for this included the behavior of plants. Kirby, like others of his day, thought that the behavior of plants could be explained in purely physical and mechanical terms (Kirby, 1835; Richards, 1987). Darwin came around to a similar position that plant movements could be viewed using the sensationalist or associationalist psychology of his grandfather (Darwin, 1838, 1838-1839). In his notebook N on metaphysics and expressions Darwin (1838-1839, p. 50) concluded, "The memory of Plants, must be association, ? a certain round of actions take place every day, &amp; closing of the leaves, comes on from want of stimulus, after certain other ac tions, &amp; hence becomes associated with them. ? The establish ment of this principle of Association will help my theory of sensitive Plants." In addition as he composed his Essay of 1842, Darwin saw that plant and animal behavior are solely physical. He concluded "habits purely corporeal, breeding season &amp;c, time of going to rest &amp;c, vary and are hereditary, like the analo gous habits of plants which are inherited" [emphasis added] (Darwin, 1909a, p. 17). His subsequent keen interest in the be havior of plants suggests that he not only thought it possible to explain plant behavior via physical or corporeal means, but also that plants could be a model system for studying the evolution of biological behavior. Darwin was not alone in considering plant and animal behav ior as physical or physiological. Gustav Fechner (1801-1887), the founder of modern psychology, sought to make connections between physics, physiology, and behavior (Fechner et al., 1966; Heidelberger, 2004), and he also argued by analogies that plants have the same fundamental psychology as humans (Fech ner, 1848; Heidelberger, 2004). Matthias Schleiden (1804 1881), a plant cytologist who proposed the cell theory of biology, criticized Fechner's analogies between plant and ani mal behavior (Heidelberger, 2004). Nonetheless, Ernst Haeckel (1834-1919), who was one of the staunchest advocates of Dar win's theory of evolution, accepted and adopted Fechner's con ception of a plant soul. In an 1878 speech entitled Cell-Souls and Soul-Cells, Haeckel argued that all organic matter was sen sitive and that cell irritability was the basis of the soul. In sup port of his theory, Haeckel (1878) suggested that plant irritability demonstrated the existence of a plant soul. By giving all cells a soul, Haeckel attempted to arrive at a materialistic basis for the human soul that operated according to the laws of physics and chemistry. Moreover, Haeckel considered his theory of cell soul as the basis for the evolution of human consciousness. Charles Darwin's studies of insectivorous and climbing plants?Almost immediately after publishing The Origin of Species, Darwin became acquainted with the movements of the sundew Drosera rotundifolia (Browne, 2002). His fascination with Drosera started out as a hobby, but eventually it stimulated a more serious study of plant movements. In a 24 November 1860 letter to Charles Lyell (1797-1875), Darwin exclaims that he is "frightened and astounded" by Drosera (Darwin and Dar win, 1887, p. 320). He was shocked to learn that a plant could be more sensitive to touch than human skin (Darwin and Dar win, 1887). He also determined that Drosera could distinguish between objects (Darwin, 1875). In a world that held that the movements of plants were a passive consequence of the envi ronment acting on the plant, this observation was an eye opener for Darwin. His experiments suggested that Drosera might have some sort of nervous system (Darwin and Darwin, 1887), and he named the hairs of Drosera tentacles, after the appendages of a hydra. Off and on for the next 15 years, Darwin would study Drosera and other insectivorous plants, and perhaps not coinci dentally, he conducted experiments with Drosera the day after finishing the proofs of Expression of Emotions (Darwin and</page><page sequence="6">2120 American Journal of Botany [Vol. 96 Darwin, 1887). Darwin became interested in the movements of climbing and twining plants after reading an article by Asa Gray (1810-1888) and receiving seeds of Echinocystis lobata from Gray (Darwin and Darwin, 1887). We refer our readers to Is nard and Silk (2009) for a detailed treatment of his work on climbing and twining plants and its relationship to current re search. In his 22 July 1863 letter to Joseph Hooker (1817-1911), Darwin described his surprise at the continuous twisting and revolving movements of the uppermost stem of Echinocystis lobata (Darwin and Darwin, 1887). He noticed that the lower parts of the stem remained still during the revolutions and that the revolutions proceeded independent from the light condi tions. As soon as the revolving section of a stem touched a stick, the growing shoot would wrap around it. Darwin noticed the sensitivity to touch was developmentally gated because young stems did not wrap around each other. He also observed that tendrils display these regular revolving movements as they ex plore for something to wrap around. In 1863, Darwin found that tendrils were more sensitive to touch than the human finger and called them "wonderfully crafty" (Darwin et al., 1985). Despite the frequent analogies Darwin made between plant and animals, he still viewed plants as inferior to animals as late as 1875 when he finally published his work on insectivorous plants. The great est inferiority of plants, Darwin (1875, p. 367) contended in In sectivorous Plants, was the lack of a "central organ, able to receive impressions from all points, to transmit their effects in many different directions, to store them up and reproduce them." By referring to impressions and the ability to store or reproduce them, Darwin was again using terminology directly from the sensationalist school of psychology. In 1871, St. George Mivart (1827-1900) criticized Darwin's theory of evolution in The Genesis of Species, on the grounds that gradual change would confer no adaptive benefit to the or ganism (Mivart, 1871). Mivart referred to Darwin's work on climbing plants to support his claim that evolution could not explain how climbing or plant sensitivity arose (Mivart, 1871). To counter Mivart's criticisms, Darwin (1873) included a new chapter in the 6th edition of The Origin of Species that explained how the movement and sensitivity of climbing plants might gradually evolve. Darwin proposed that the ability to twine or climb evolved from the incidental revolving nutation of non twining plants. Darwin, likewise, proposed all plant species had some incipient form of touch sensitivity and that twining plants evolved to be especially sensitive to touch. Furthermore, Dar win speculated that the sense of touch evolved incidentally from other types of plant sensitivity such as sensitivity to light or gravity. Darwin likened this to an animal nerve or muscle incidentally being excited by galvanism or strychnine. In addition to his own research on plant movements and plant sensitivity, Darwin (1880) became aware of the research of Al bert Bendard Frank's (1839-1900) and Theophil Ciesielski's research on tropistic movements. Frank's experiments sug gested that gravitropism and phototropism of plant organs shared a common response system leading to differential growth (Green, 1909). Darwin drew upon Frank's research to support his idea that circumnutating is the shared mechanistic basis of all plant movements and how these movements would confer a selective advantage (Darwin, 1880). Ciesielski observed that the root tip was critical for root gravitropism and suggested that a transmissible influence was involved in gravitropism (Green, 1909; Bell, 1959). Darwin took great interest in this idea for a couple of likely reasons. Ciesielki's hypothesis was somewhat reminiscent of his grandfather's idea that plants contained a common sensorium (Darwin, 1794), and more significantly, it suggested that plants might have a sensing apparatus, analo gous to a brain, that natural selection might act upon. The Power Of Movements in Plants?Darwin began the re search for The Power of Movement in Plants in 1877 (Darwin and Darwin, 1887). He was assisted by his son, Francis, who visited Julius Sachs' laboratory in 1878 and 1879 (Chadarevian, 1996; Ayres, 2008). As we have already alluded to, Darwin's primary question was about how behaviors evolve, and more specifically Darwin (1880, p. 4) asked, "How did all [the] diver sified [plant] movements for the most different purposes arise?" He believed that circumnutation and tip sensitivity were modi fied to improve adaptability to the environment. The techniques Darwin used to study the movements of plants were often inge nious in their simplicity (Fig. 1) but were crude (Fig. 2) in com parison to the techniques of Sachs (Chadarevian, 1996) or the methodical approach of Wiesner (1878, 1881). Darwin also re peated his experiments using many different and relatively un related species to answer his questions about the evolution of plant movements (Darwin, 1880). This repetition made The Power of Movement in Plants tedious to read, and when he was correcting the second proofs, Darwin remarked that the book was a "horrid bore" (Darwin and Darwin, 1887, p. 332). Conse quently, Darwin openly encouraged his readers to skip most of the book and to only read the last chapter, which summarized the book (Darwin, 1880). Darwin's first concern in The Power of Movement in Plants was determining if circumnutating occurs in various organs of different species (Darwin, 1880). Following Rosa Muller's ob servations, Darwin (1880) begins The Power of Movement by describing the circumnutating movements of seedlings (Dar win, 1880). Using Brassica oleracea as a model, Darwin pre sented evidence that the radicle, hypocotyls, and cotyledons all display some form of circumnutation. From this, he went on and demonstrated that seedling circumnutation is universal across species and suggested that the twining ability of Aspara gus scandens evolved from the circumnutation of common as paragus. Once Darwin had determined that the organs of all seedlings continually circumnutate, Darwin turned his attention to ascertaining if mature plants also display circumnutation and found that stems, stolens, flower stems, and leaves of mature plants continually circumnutated. From these studies, Darwin concluded that all organs of all plant species circumnutated. This prompted Darwin to ask why circumnutation is universal in land plants and how it conferred an adaptive benefit for the plant. Darwin's perspective on the universal nature and adaptive benefit of circumnutation came directly from his sensationalist view of behavior. As we discussed earlier, sensationalists be lieved that habits, such as a child sucking their thumb, resulted from chains of associations between impressions and motion. In the example of thumb sucking, a sensationalist would say that impressions from nursing became modified and reinforced by associating sucking with the security of a mother and thus became an entrained habit. From the language Darwin (1865, 1880) used to describe plant movements, it is clear that he be lieved that plant movements were habits. Darwin's experiments led him to propose that circumnutation initially arose as a habit to help young stems to emerge from the soil and to help roots push deeper into the soil (Darwin, 1880). Furthermore, Darwin proposed that the habit of circumnutation was "everywhere modified" to produce phototropism (Fig. 2), gravitropism, hy</page><page sequence="7">December 2009] Whippo and Hang arter?Power of movement in plants 2121 \^ Glass Plate Magnified Tracing of Movement - Glass Needle -Seedling Fig. 1. Cartoon of Darwin's method of recording plant movement. Darwin visually lined up a bead of wax on a glass needle affixed to a plant organ such as a shoot, root, leaf, etc. with a stationary dot on a card and marked the glass. By repeatedly doing this at different times, Darwin con nected the dots to create his tracings of plant movement. The tracings led Darwin to conclude that all plant organs circumnutate and that the different forms of tropistic movements were modified forms of circumnutation (Darwin, 1880). Card with Stationary Point drotropism, diurnal leaf movements, touch responses, climbing, etc. (Darwin, 1880). To support this hypothesis, Darwin (1880) devoted five chapters of The Power of Movement in Plants in an attempt to demonstrate that the various types of plant move ment were modified forms of circumnutation. However, he also needed a materially constrained way to explain the variation that he saw in plant movements, how plant movements were inher ited, and what natural selection could act upon. To see how Darwin thought about the inheritance of plant behavior, we need to briefly mention what Darwin thought about the inheritance of animal instincts. Darwin believed that a particular animal behavior could become a habit if repeated often enough and postulated that habits became inherited through some type of physical modification of the brain (Rich ards, 1987). But Darwin understood that plants lacked brains (Darwin, 1875, 1880); therefore, how could the habit of cir cumnutation become inherited and how could it be modified to produce the various types of plant movement? Recall from our previous discussion that sensationalists thought that sensing was the fundamental basis of thought. In his theorizing about the evolution of animal vision, Darwin (1873) proposed that a single nerve cell could become sensitive to light. Therefore, in line with his sensationalist view of psychology, Darwin could have easily imagined that plants have some matter of special sensitivity, and, consequently, that the movement habits of plants became inherited through the modification this sensitive matter. Individuals with a configuration or makeup of sensitive matter particularly well adapted for their environment would be preserved and the less fit would be eliminated. From his work on plant movements and that of Ciesielski, Darwin had good reason to believe that plants contained some type of sensitive matter akin to animal nerves or brains (Green, 1909). However, Sachs (1873) tried to repeat Ciesielski's root decapitation ex periments and was unable to reproduce the results. Sachs held the belief that all living cells, not just a select few in a particular region, were irritable by the external environment (Sachs and Vines, 1882; Sachs and Ward, 1887). Therefore, the question of plant sensitivity and the existence of an organ or region in the plant with higher sensitivity remained unresolved. In The Power of Movement in Plants, Darwin (1880) first took up the issue of sensitivity not with root gravitropism in the manner of Ciesielski or Sachs but with touch sensitivity. He first noticed that when a radicle encountered an object that it could not grow through, such as a plate of glass, it would change its direction. After ruling out mechanical explanations for this phenomenon, Darwin proposed that the apex of the radicle was sensitive to contact and that it transmitted an effect from it to an upper part of the radicle. Darwin tested these ideas by affixing little squares of stiff card stock to radicle tips and observing how the root moved in response and in opposition to gravity. He also noticed that contact or irritation of one side of the root tip caused the root to bend toward the opposite side. After ex perimenting with relatively distantly related plant species, Dar win concluded that the tips of all radicles of nearly all plants are sensitive and transmit an influence upward. Darwin moved on to testing light sensitivity in shoot photot ropism. The general opinion of Sachs and Wiesner was that light acted directly on the bending part of the shoot (Wiesner, 1878; Sachs and Vines, 1882). Darwin's historically important experiments suggested otherwise. First, Darwin (1880) noticed that phototropic bending depended upon the developmental sta tus of the plant and the light environment prior to illumination with unilateral light. Independent from the work of Wiesner A 5**3' B * ^9? p.m. K / / 1 \ K } \ \ Fig. 2. An example of one of Darwin's tracings in Power of Movement in Plants (Darwin, 1880), fig. 171.

These observations caused Darwin to conclude that light is not acting directly on the re sponding cells or their cell walls. Instead, he proposed that these observations mean that light acts as a stimulus in the same way that light acts upon the nervous systems of animals. Second, Darwin was impressed by the accuracy in which coleoptiles bend toward the light and proposed that the upper part of the coleoptiles influenced the curvature of the lower part. To test his hypothesis, Darwin (1880) tried various experiments in which he amputated the shoot tip or covered the shoot tip with ink or caps. Because these seminal experiments indicated that light perception at the shoot tip was important for phototropic bending in the lower areas of the shoot, Darwin concluded that the shoot tip contained some kind of sensitive matter that trans mitted its influence to the bending part of the shoot. He also discovered that the root tip was critical for light sensing during root phototropism. In summarizing his findings, Darwin made several plant-animal analogies about plant light sensitivity and the sensitivity of the retina to bright and dim light and con cluded that light sensitivity in plants is nearly the same between plants and animals. After showing that the tips of shoots and roots were sensitive to external stimulation, Darwin (1880) reexamined the contro versial results of Ciesielski, who had presented evidence that the root tip was necessary for gravity sensing for gravitropism. Sachs' laboratory could not repeat Ciesielski's results and found that the roots with amputated tips oriented randomly. Be cause of the influence Sachs had over setting the accepted theo ries of plant physiology, Darwin took great care and was very methodical in amputating the root tips of various seedlings so that he could explain how Ciesielski and Sachs arrived at differ ent results (Darwin, 1880). First, Darwin noticed, in agreement with Ciesielski, that if the root tip was transversely amputated, then gravitropism was attenuated. Then he amputated the root tip more obliquely and found that the roots oriented randomly. From these experiments, Darwin suggested that Sachs' results were an artifact of not amputating the tip in a fully transverse direction. Darwin's results suggested that all tropistic movements are simply modified forms of circumnutation and that plant sensi tivity to various external stimuli (light, gravity, contact) resided in a common location at the shoot or root tip (Darwin, 1880). By uniting all forms of plant tropism responses into a mecha nism and by locating plant sensitivity to cells at the tip, Darwin thought that he had solved how plant movements and sensitiv ity arose via evolution by modification of circumnutation and sensitivity. For Darwin, the idea of a transmitted influence from the tip was of secondary importance as a way to explain how the tip induced bending in motor regions. Furthermore, Darwin did not know the nature of the influence and did not directly speculate on its nature. From his writings on insectivorous plants, where he experimented with the effects of opiates and electricity on plant movements, and his numerous comparisons between plant responses and animal nerves (Darwin, 1865, 1875,1880), we are of the opinion that Darwin probably thought that the transmissible influence in plants was akin to a neuro logical action potential. Finally, Darwin concluded The Power of Movement in Plants by framing his understanding of plant movements in sensationalistic terms. He remarked (p. 573), "It is hardly an exaggeration to say the tip of the radicle thus en dowed, and having the power of directing the movements of the adjoining parts, acts like a brain of one of the lower animals; being seated within the anterior end of the body, receiving im pressions from the sense-organs and directing the several move ments" [emphasis added]. The controversy following The Power of Movement in Plants?Darwin was concerned about the reception that the Power of Movement in Plants would receive (Chadarevian, 1996). This anxiety proved warranted; both Sachs and Wiesner had difficulty accepting Darwin's theory of plant movements. In uncovering the historical background behind Darwin's work on plant movement, we can see how an ensuing controversy would have been anticipated by Darwin. Darwin's ideas about plant movement were unorthodox and somewhat counter to the accepted theory of plant irritability. First, the criticisms were focused on the scientific validity of Darwin's experiments. Sachs thought Darwin's experiential approach was amateurish and unskillful (Sachs and Ward, 1887). Moreover, Detlefsen (1882), who was Sachs' student, could not reproduce the results of Darwin's root tip sensitivity assay. Wiesner also wasted no time in criticizing Darwin's theory. In his book entitled Das Bewegungsverm?gen der Pflanzen, which when translated into English also means The Power of Movement in Plants, Wiesner (1881) described his attempt to repeat Darwin's experiments and found little evidence that tropisms are a modified form of circumnutation (Fig. 3) or of plant sensitivity residing only at organ tips. Second, Sachs criticized Darwin's views on plant movement on historical and philosophical grounds. As a histo rian of plant physiology and a student of philosophy, Sachs would have been familiar with the scientific, historical, and philosophical problems of equating animal and plant sensation and behavior. In his book about the history of plant physiology, Sachs was contemptuous of Bonnet and others who found par allels between plant and animal plant sensitivity. He harshly rejected any vitalist or sensationalists ideas about plant move ment (Sachs et al., 1890). In line with this contempt, Sachs re garded Charles Darwin's idea that the root tip contained an organ equivalent to an animal brain as "sensational" (Sachs and Ward, 1887, p. 689). The rejection of Darwin's ideals about plant movement by plant physiologists was probably ironically exasperated by the advocates of Darwin's theory of evolution. In trying to diminish the gap between animal and human intel ligence, Darwin's followers such as Haeckel would recklessly use plant irritability to construct an erroneous chain of increas ing consciousness (Haeckel, 1900). Partial acceptance of the Darwin theory of plant move ment?Darwin's ideas about plant movement remained contro versial for several years, but by the beginning of the 20th century Darwin's idea of tip sensitivity and the drawing of anal ogies between plant and animal sensitivity became more widely accepted. Recognition of the significance of Darwin's work on plant movement began in the laboratory of Wilhelm Pfeffer (1845-1920). Pfeffer was a former student of Sachs, but his ideas about plant irritability were distinctly his own. His work on osmosis in plants caused Pfeffer to question the standard view of plant irritability (Pfeffer, 1877). Pfeffer suggested that external or internal stimuli released a trigger that, in turn, set off a cascade resulting in an irritability response (Anonymous, 1894; B?nning and Pfeffer, 1989). Furthermore, under this con ceptual framework, Pfeffer considered that setting off the trig ger would irreversibly alter the physiology of the plant. Sachs conception of irritability was strikingly different from Pfeffer's</page><page sequence="9">December 2009] Whippo and Hang arter?Power of movement in plants 2123 2nd Glass Plane I II III IV - - 2 e,. 3 1st Glass Plane d Stationary Point a ??

Modified fig. 3 from Das Bewegungsverm?gen der Pflanzen (Wiesner, 1881). A stylistic representation of a plant organ with tip/wax bead at positions, 'a', 'b , 'c\ 'd', or 'e\ When the organ tip is located at position 'a', Darwin's tracing method would place a mark at point 1 along the first glass plane. If the or gan tip grows to position 'b', then a mark would be placed at point 2 along the first glass plane. Although no horizontal movement occurred, it would appear to have moved according to Darwin's method. In other words, verti cal growth by itself necessitates moving the mark from points 1 to 2 along the first plane. This would give the impression of backward motion during Darwin's tropism experiments. If the organ tip moved slightly horizontally, from position 'b' to 'c', the placement of the mark is still placed at point 2 along the first glass plane, giving the impression that horizontal movement had not occurred. Further horizontal movement to position'd' would give the impression that the tip is in the same horizontal place as it was when it was at position a; that is to say, at point 1 along the first plane. When the organ tip bent further to position 'e', a mark would be placed at position 3 along the first glass plane. Because position 1 is between position 2 and 3, it would appear as if circumnutation occurred. However, by placing marks (I, II, III, or IV) on the second glass plane based on an intersecting line running from the tip at positions 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', or 'e' independently of the reference point and intersecting the first glass plane perpendicularly, circumnutation would not be evident. Therefore, Wiesner concluded that Darwin's evidence that tropism are modified versions of circumnutation was an artifact of his method of monitoring plant movement. because Sachs' considered irritability a reversible property of the cell (Anonymous, 1894). Pfeffer labeled his irritability the ory release-physiology. Pfeffer also applied the Weber-Fechner law, which was originally used by Ernst Weber (1795-1879) and Fechher in human psychology to describe the relationship between a stimulus and its perception, to nonanimal organisms when he sought to explain the chemotactic response of bacteria (Anonymous, 1894; B?nning and Pfeffer, 1989). Pfeffer's ex periments suggested that the Weber-Fechner law could be ap plied to bacteria, and this was considered sufficient proof that animal sensitivity did not require reference to a higher psychic power for explanation. Moreover, Pfeffer believed that the We ber-Fechner law could be applied to the gravitropic and pho totropic movements of plants. Pfeffer looked favorably on Darwin's ideas of plant motion because they were consistent with his release-physiology theory (Anonymous, 1894; Bell, 1959). After Pfeffer moved to the University of Leipzig, his students, Rothert and Cezpeck, produced the first corroborating evidence that sensitivity to the environment resided at the shoot or root tips and was separable from the responding region (Rothert, 1894; Czapek, 1895). Rothert went on to propose that all plant tropism responses would have identical transmitted in fluence. Pfeffer's theories about irritability and his students' experiments opened the door for further plant-animal analogies and another generation of scientist began debating the useful ness of such analogies. By making analogies between plant and animal systems, Nemec (1900) and Haberlandt (1900) indepen dently proposed the highly influential statolith theory of gravity perception to explain sensing in plants and animals. At the same time, animal psychologists had more than a pass ing interest in the research of Sachs and Pfeffer concerning the nature of plant irritability and movements. They viewed ideas about plant irritability and movements in response to stimuli as applicable to their fields of study. Jacques Loeb (1859-1924), who was a student of Sachs (Pauly, 1987), began to investigate the behavior of sessile coelenterates in the way Sachs studied plant tropism (Pauly, 1987). Loeb (1918) would go on to pro pose the tropistic theory of all behavior, in which tropisms to ward or away from a stimulus became the fundamental basis of behavior. Under Loeb's theory, tropistic responses to the envi ronment did not require consciousness and only physiochemi cal processes were in play (Loeb, 1918). While Loeb adhered to his mentor's view of direct irritability, others studying animal behavior would follow Pfeffer's release-physiology theory be lieving that complex internal physiology was controlling the behavior of animals. For example, Herbert Spencer Jennings (1868-1947) studied the movements of paramecium and ap plied Pfeffer's theories of release-stimulation as a guide (Jen nings, 1906). Numerous studies of animal and microbial behavior followed along these lines during the first decades of the 20th century, and comparative psychology was united by the belief that all organisms share the same basic form of irrita bility or reaction-response mechanism (Warden et al., 1935). This approach, particularly Loeb's tropistic theory of animal and human behavior, would eventually lead to the behaviorism of B. F. Skinner (1904-1990) during the 20th century (Pauly, 1987). Francis Darwin, encouraged by the confirmation of his fa ther's work on plant sensitivity by Pfeffer's laboratory, synthe sized Pfeffer's release-physiology with sensationalistic psychology and speculated that the memory of an acquired habit was the foundation of trait inheritance (Darwin, 1901, 1908). In the popular press, Francis Darwin's sensationalist ideas about behavior and inheritance were treated in the same manner as a modern big-foot sighting, and his fellow scientists shook their heads in disagreement over his Lamarckian theory of trait inheritance (Anonymous, 1908a, b). As part of the 1909 centennial of Darwin's birth year, Francis Darwin (1909b) re viewed the field of plant movements since the publication of The Power of Movement in Plants. In this review, Francis ac knowledged that scientists had rejected his father's theory of circumnutation. However, he saw that the major significance of his father's work on plant sensitivity was that it resulted in the recognition that plants respond to the environment in much the same way as animals. This new appreciation for plant sensitiv ity overthrew (at least for a while) the older theories of light, gravity, contact, etc., acting directly on the plant to produce movement. Wiesner even came to accept Darwin's work on plant sensitivity as an inroad into a unified biological theory of behavior. In a 1904 speech before the International Congress of Arts and Science at the St. Louis World's Fair, Wiesner (1906)</page><page sequence="10">2124 American Journal of Botany [Vol. 96 also spoke about the development of the field of plant physiol ogy and the importance of Darwin's The Power of Movement in Plants as a significant milestone in the advancement of a uni fied field of biology via the cross-fertilization of botany and plant physiology with zoology and animal physiology. As plant-animal analogies and parallels were reaching their height in popularity in the early 20th century, attention turned toward the question of whether the transmissible influence was a chemical substance, a change in osmotic pressure, or an elec trical event analogous to animal nerve impulses. If the influ ence was like a nerve impulse or osmotic, then making small transverse cuts along the shoot or root would presumably pre vent the impulse from moving to the bending region. Fitting performed this experiment and found that making transverse cuts in various places around the tip of coleoptiles did not af fect phototropic bending (Fitting, 1907). Boy sen-Jensen per formed similar experiments, but also inserted a thin piece of mica as a physical barrier into the shaded side of a coleoptile (Boysen-Jensen, 1911). The mica prevented phototropic bend ing (Boysen-Jensen, 1911). From that experiment and others, Boy sen-Jensen (1911) concluded that the transmissible influ ence was a diffusible chemical and that the influence came from the shaded side. Fitting also experimented with the post pollination expansion of orchid ovaries, and upon finding that even dead pollen could induce ovary expansion, he proposed that plant pollen contained some substance equivalent to the recently discovered animal hormones (Starling, 1905; Fitting, 1909, 1910). This idea fit well with Sachs' older hypothesis that plants contain growth substances (Sachs, 1880,1882). Paal (1918) in Pfeffer's laboratory repeated Fittings and Boy sen Jensen's experiments and also concluded that the transmissible influence was a substance. However, Pfeffer continued to see plant movements as a complex inner process of stimulation and activation. The idea that a single growth substance could cause tropistic movements was much simpler than Pfeffer considered possible (Went, 1974). Rejection of plant-animal analogies and the discovery of auxin?Although plant movements were included in compara tive psychology books as late as 1935 (Warden et al., 1935), most plant physiologists were uncomfortable with the compari sons between plant and animal movement during the 20th cen tury (Bell, 1959). A critical examination of Darwin's and Pfeffer's ideas about plant sensitivity and perception began in Utrecht in the laboratory of Friedrich August Ferdinand Chris tian Went (1863-1935) (Bell, 1959; Went, 1974). Went's labo ratory rejected the usage of plant-animal analogies and followed Wiesner and Sachs in working toward a simple materialistic basis of plant movements (Bell, 1959). Early on in Went's labo ratory, Blaauw proposed that light sensitivity or perception was not required for phototropism because he observed that the amount of curvature was directly proportional to the amount of light energy reaching the plant. However, subsequent photobi ology experiments from the Went laboratory suggested that the dose-response curve for phototropism was more complicated than Blaauw's theory predicted. As a consequence of this and Paal's research, the focus of the Went laboratory shifted to de termining the nature of the influence transmitted from the api ces. At the time, there were numerous internal laboratory debates between students in the Went laboratory over the nature of the transmitted influence (Went, 1974). Some held that it was an immaterial spirit (Went, 1974). Fritz W. Went working in his father's laboratory determined, based on diffusion calculations, that the transmissible influence had a molecular mass and the debate over the materiality of the influence was settled (Went, 1926). After this, Chlolodny and Went independently proposed that light or gravity caused lateral displacement of this growth substance at the apicies, which in turn caused tropistic move ments (Chlolodny, 1927; Went, 1928). In 1931, Kogl and Haa gen-Smit (1931) published their results concerning the isolation of this substance and renamed it auxin. This substance was in dependently identified as indole-3-acetic acid by Kogl's labora tory (Kogl et al., 1934: Kogl and Kostermans, 1934) and by Thimann and Went (1934, 1935). The Power of Movement in Plants and modern plant biol ogy?For most of the 20th century, comparisons between plants and animals to explain plant movements were frowned upon by most plant physiologists and seen as anti-intellectual (Galston and Slayman, 1981; Nagel, 1997). Plant physiologists contin ued to test the Chlolodny-Went and starch-statolith theories, as well as various ideas about the nature of the pigment responsi ble for absorbing light during phototropism. The mainstream school of thought followed the physiochemical theories of plant movement in the tradition of 19th century German and Austrian plant physiology. Progress in the field was slow and confusion abounded (Firn and Digby, 1980). Major breakthroughs began in the mid-1980s when the development of Arabidopsis as a model system attracted scientists to apply molecular approaches that were being used to great effect in yeast, animals, and mi crobial systems (Somerville and Meyerowitz, 1994). In fairly quick succession, numerous plant movement mutants were iso lated (Mirza et al., 1984; Khurana and Poff, 1989; Okada and Shimura, 1992; Liscum and Briggs, 1995). By genetically map ping many of these mutants, dozens of genes encoding proteins involved in plant movements have since been identified, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are rapidly being re vealed. Excellent reviews concerning the genetics and molecu lar biology of various forms of plant movement can be found elsewhere (Braam, 2005; Esmon et al., 2005; lino, 2006; Mc Clung, 2006; Celaya et al., 2009; Isnard and Silk, 2009). Darwin's main objective in The Power of Movement in Plants was to determine how biological responses to the environment arose during evolution. Unlike some of his successors, Darwin saw plant movement in terms of evolution and, thus, contingent upon problems ancestral organisms faced when responding to the environment, rather than only an engineering problem of a current snapshot in time. Obviously, we now have a far better understanding of how bacteria, plants, fungi, and animals are evolutionarily related (Palmer et al., 2004). In addition, molecu lar biology, genomics, and proteomics studies have uncovered the extent to which proteins are conserved between distantly re lated species. However, our understanding of the fundamental questions about the evolution of plant movements that were at the heart of what motivated Darwin remains rudimentary. To develop a deeper understanding of movement in plants and other organisms, it will be increasingly helpful to think in terms of the evolution of plant sensitivity and hormone signaling (Barlow, 1995; Lariguet and Dunand, 2005; Galv?n-Ampudia and Of fringa, 2007; Rensing et al., 2008; Ellison and Gotelli, 2009). CONCLUSION Historical analysis shows that Charles Darwin's work on plant movements originated as a system to study the evolution</page><page sequence="11">December 2009] Whippo and Hangarter?Power of movement in plants 2125 of behavior. Moreover, Darwin, like his sensationalist prede cessors, believed that behavior would ultimately be explained in physiological terms. Therefore, he was attracted to the phys iochemical approaches of plant physiologists to explain the evolution of plant movements. He tried to describe how all plant movements might be descended as modified forms of cir cumnutation and that plant sensitivity resided at root or shoot apices. However, subsequent research showed that Darwin's circumnutation theory of plant movement is inadequate and that plant sensitivity is not restricted to plant apices. For some plant biologists, the legacy of Darwin's research on plant move ment is his idea of a transmittable influence in plants, which of course contributed to the discovery of auxin. For others, his numerous demonstrations of plant sensitivity and responsive ness marked a new dawn for our understanding of plants. But as we have discussed, the beginning of these concepts certainly did not originate from Charles Darwin, although he did play an important role in advancing them. If we take a larger view and place the study of plant movement in the broader context of the questions Darwin asked about species evolution, trait inheri tance, and behavior, we see that plant biology is in many re spects at the beginning of something we are only starting to explore: the unique and accidental evolutionary path of plant movements and animal behavior. Hopefully, those commemo rating the 300th anniversary of Darwin's birth will be able to discuss this underappreciated aspect of Darwin's scientific legacy. LITERATURE CITED Anderson, L. 1982.
