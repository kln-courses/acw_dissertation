Pp. xi, 239. $zo.oo. The reach of Paul Fry's criticism is one of the most conspicuous things about it. His previous book, The Poet's Calling in the English Ode, ranged from Jonson through Keats, with excursions back into classical poetry; the more recent book begins with a chapter on Aristotle and moves through Longinus, Dryden, and Shelley to a culminating-and very provocative-study of Walter Benjamin. The five chapters are shaped by a theoretical agenda that couples "a critique of method" and of"formalism" with a celebration of interpretive modes pointed, implicitly or explicitly, toward "the sublime, the 'grace' beyond the reach of art" (p. 3). Fry positions his sublime hermeneutic in sympathetic though not uncritical relation to Heidegger, Gadamer, de Man, and others, and he uses it to recognize and validate those aspects of experience excluded or distorted, he claims, in formalist criticism: temporality, undecidability, randomness, frag- mentariness, displacement, the determination of the objects of perception by the processes of perception, the linguistic basis of all thinking. Fry's polemic against</page><page sequence="2">214 neats-onettey journal formalism is the least interesting aspect of the book: it coercively and inflexibly identifies critical "method" with "formalism"; it caricatures formalism by attri- buting to it a serene objectivism that no good formalist critic has ever believed in; and it often betrays Fry's own perceptive but sporadic recognition that the energies he associates with the sublime depend dialectically on the very articula- tions of form they transgress and disrupt. The strengths of Fry's argument are instead to be felt in its affirmations, in its celebration of the fictionalizing bold- ness of Dryden's critical prose, for instance, and in its venturesome speculations on Benjamin's notion of "distraction." Fry's chapter on Shelley gets off to a bumpy start with his needing to assert that if Shelley read Longinus at all "it is plain that he did not read him carefully" (p. 125), even as he insists that "Shelley is closest in spirit to Longinus of all the Romantic critics." Once past this initial difficulty, Fry launches into an extended reading of A Defence of Poetry that has its moments of strong illumination. He grounds a good understanding of the relation between predetermination and freedom in Shelley's conception of poetic inspiration on Shelley's own remarks about the words "liberty" and "chance" in a note to Queen Mab (p. 150). And he writes persuasively about Shelley's notion of the "great cyclic poem" (pp. 155- 58), and about his "acute and in some ways tragic sense of being immersed, saturated, in temporality" (p. 159). The chapter is entitled "Shelley's 'Defence of Poetry' in Our Time," and for Fry as for a number of other recent commen- tators, valuing Shelley in "our time" means accommodating him to the tenets of recent theoretical discourse. One of these tenets, as Fry makes clear in his intro- duction, is "the linguistic character of all thinking and the consequent unavaila- bility of the saving distinction between discourse and the generic idea (signifie') to which it refers" (p. 9). The difficulty with looking at Shelley from this per- spective comes when we recognize that his complicated sense of thought's de- pendence on language is not the same as that of post-structuralist theorists, and that he remained deeply and inventively committed to what Fry describes as "the notion of language that had prevailed almost universally since its exposition by Locke, namely, that words are arbitrary signs that obscure the pure essence of thoughts" (p. 138). Fry acknowledges this latter commitment but treats it as a regrettable conservatism on Shelley's part, rather than as a driving impulse in Shelley's linguistic speculations and in his poetry. Shelley openly resisted Horne Took's reduction of the operations of thought to operations of language, and his doing so is intrinsic to that agitated and divided cast of mind which Fry catches momentarily in observing that "His thinking is unstable because it is rigorous enough to remain in suspense between ideas of order and ideas of diffusion" (p. 159). Such Shelleyan suspension refuses to let itself sink into that collapsing of</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 215 "the difference between text and soul" that Fry (p. 48), accepting Wimsatt's analysis but inverting his evaluation, sees as essential to Longinus. The priority of language to thought also figures centrally, though much more grimly, in Paul de Man's extraordinary essay on The Triumph of Life, where it is announced as "the figurality of all signification" (p. 116). "Shelley Disfigured" first appeared in Deconstruction and Criticism (1979); it now stands at the center of this collection of essays written between 1956 and de Man's death in 1983, a collection that "represents the main bulk of what I have written on romanticism" (p. vii). De Man himself, with characteristically canny self-effacement, singles the essay out in his Preface as "the only place where I come close to facing some of [the as yet unresolved] questions about history and fragmentation" (p. ix) crucial to our understanding of romantic and post-romantic writing. "Shelley Disfigured" begins with the fragmentary textual status of The Tri- umph of Life, and with de Man's using Shelley's unanswered questions to turn over questions of his own about "the use of history as a way to new beginnings" (p. 94)-about what he later refers to, in an essay written especially for this volume called "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric," as "historical modes of language power" (p. 262). De Man focuses on the repeated "move- ment of effacing and of forgetting" in Shelley's poem, on the ways in which within this repeated movement "the syntax and imagery . .. tie themselves into a knot which arrests the process of understanding" (p. 98). He shows that The Triumph of Life is even more complex and resistant than we had thought-not by "undoing" this text so filled with its own "undoing of shapes" (p. 107), but by attending to un-undoable knots of significance in the writing. Even readers who feel that they are all too familiar with de Man's emphasis on the "themati- zation of language" (p. 113), or readers who think that knots of syntax and imagery may be tied so as to catch and hold meaning as well as to resist our analysis of it, have much to learn from his tracing of the "trajectory from erased self-knowledge to disfiguration" (p. ioo). Previous critics have written about the poem's opening "images of rising and waning light" (p. 104) and, like de Man, have followed them into the specular structures of Rousseau's inset narrative, where they are refracted and transmuted into images of evanescent sound, and eventually into images of tracks and traces. But no one before de Man has shown how relentlessly the poem uses these figurative movements to articulate and expose its own vulnerability to the interwoven problems of knowing, writing, living. Not all of de Man's own moves in "Shelley Disfigured" measure up to the standard of skeptical scrutiny characteristic of the essay as a whole. The identifi- cation of "measure" as rhythmically "articulated sound" with "language" (p.</page><page sequence="4">216 Keats-Shelley Journal 112) momentarily short-circuits the entire question of signification and is out of touch with Shelley's own position in the Defence: "Sounds as well as thoughts have relation both between each other and towards that which they represent, and a perception of the order of those relations has always been found connected with a perception of the order of the relations of thoughts." A related obscurity or truncation of the argument emerges when de Man generalizes about "the arbitrary element in the alignment between meaning and linguistic articulation" (p. 114) without pausing to consider Shelley's own very different conviction (again in the Defence) that "language is arbitrarily produced by the imagination," with its important implications for Shelley's poetic practice. And it is frustrating to see de Man make pivotal, though vaguely hedging, use of the notion of the "free play of the signifier" (p. 114) in an essay which has so much to teach us about the arbitrary constraints that any idea of linguistic or imaginative freedom has to face. Hazard Adams's massive Philosophy of the Literary Symbolic is, among many other things, a response to what is probably de Man's most famous essay, "The Rhetoric ofTemporality" (not included in The Rhetoric ofRomanticism, de Man says, because it has been reprinted in the new edition of Blindness and Insight). In the face of de Man's influential attack on romantic celebrations of the symbol as the linguistic act through which poetry unites the mind and the world, subject and object, Adams sets out "to rehabilitate the symbolic by insisting on a notion of it as the creator, through intellectual contrariety, of culture" (p. 23). That word "contrariety" signals the Blakean basis of Adams's argument. He begins with the familiar romantic opposition, still alive but with reversed valuation in de Man's writing, between "symbol" and "allegory," and up to a point his sur- vey of the various conceptions of the symbolic deliberately leaves them vulner- able to de Man's charges of "mystification": traditionally the symbol is not merely "a rhetorical trope but a mystery, in which a word or object embodies or actually contains in its very nature the being of the thing it stands for" (p. 17). But Adams contrasts these versions of the "'miraculous' symbol" to the "'secu- lar' symbol" that emerges-and remains "only emergent" (p. 18)-in roman- ticism. "In the 'secular' symbol . . . the universal becomes not something pre- viously there to be contained but somethinggenerated by the particular as the seed generates the plant or the poem such interpretations as we make of it" (p. 19). Although Adams wants to bring the symbolic back into critical favor by re- establishing it as an alternative to de Man's allegory, his larger purpose is to con- vert what he sees as an arrested opposition into a progressive Blakean contrary: "The problem for contemporary criticism is to rescue both 'allegory' and 'sym- bolism' from a historical negation which cyclically privileges one term over the</page><page sequence="5">Reviews 217 other" (p. 12); the "'secular' symbol" is "not a negation of allegory but a con- trary to the negation allegory/'miraculous' symbol" (p. 18). As the book de- velops, Adams repeatedly tries to extend his central "contrary" to include the "antimythic," skeptical, allegorizing reading of de Man and other deconstruc- tionists (here associated with Blake's Devourers) as an inevitable antithesis to the "mythic," prolific vision of the symbolic imagination that Adams has set out to "rehabilitate." Adams wants to build his rehabilitation of the symbol on the far side (to use one of de Man's favorite spatial figures) of structuralist and post-structuralist thinking. This means not only that his account of the literary symbolic is pri- marily concerned with language, but that he takes over the kinds of belief in the priority of language to thought we find in Fry and de Man and invests them with a very different set of assumptions. Adams's "'secular' concept of the symbolic" requires, he says, "a theory of the radically creative power of lan- guage" (p. 20), a theory that emerges most fully in the chapter on Blake (see p. o105). In the beginning there was "man"-a generic but also, as often in Blake, a sexual category, and apparently not yet itself constituted by language. What for de Man is a rhetorical trope (anthropomorphism) that always betokens a gap within the signifying function of language becomes for Adams the linguistic act by which the universe is brought into existence from a condition of mere "potentiality" (p. 107). Adams's view of language as "the fundamental form of constituting reality mythically" (p. o109), while not exactly Adamic, involves nothing less than re- fusing the entire tradition of thinking about language semiotically, as a differen- tial system of signs arbitrarily related to thoughts or to other signs. Many of the problems in Adams's account arise from his dissociating language as "a creative power" from language as "a mode of signification" (p. 355). The terms "trope" and "metaphor," for instance, lose much of their force in Adams's mythic ac- count of language because there can be no prior word or reality to turn, transfer, or transform. When Adams claims that language is essentially "metaphorical," it is not at all clear what "metaphorical" actually means (the discussion of Ricoeur's work on pp. 372-89 is not much help on this point). When Shelley, by contrast, says in the Defence that the language of poets "is vitally metaphorical; that is, it marks the before unapprehended relations of things" ("things," Shelley asserts in the essay "On Life," are nominally and not ontologically different from "thoughts"), it is clear that his understanding of the constitutive power of meta- phor depends on relation and difference, on the poet's already existing in the world and in language. While there are obscurities in his theorizing about language, Adams succeeds</page><page sequence="6">218 Keats-Shelley Journal in showing that post-structuralist attacks on the symbolic have often been directed at a constricted, impoverished sense of its possibilities. And because he works historically, his book is consistently and impressively engaged with earlier thinking about questions that are by no means the invention of modern theory. To take just one instance from the introductory chapter, Adams interestingly quotes Wilhelm von Humboldt's critique of "the narrow notion that language originated as a convention and that words are nothing but signs for things or concepts which are independent of them" (p. 26). What is interesting about Humboldt here is not the often presumed originality of his pronouncement that "Man thinks, feels, and lives within language alone," but his acknowledgement that the view of language he criticizes "up to a point is certainly correct," and his closely related recognition that "The most commonplace observation and the profoundest thought, both lament the inadequacy of language.... All higher forms of speech are a wrestling with this thought, in which sometimes our power, sometimes our longing, is more keenly felt." Adams insists, rightly per- haps, that "When all is said... Humboldt is more celebrative of human power through language than he is concerned about human limitation because of it" (p. 27). But the concern with "human limitation because of it" is there in Hum- boldt, as it is in Shelley, as a necessary contrary to that mythic, symbolic presence in language for which, as Adams demonstrates, "man" keeps on longing.
