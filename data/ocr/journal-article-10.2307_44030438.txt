<plain_text><page sequence="1">The following essay considers the role of animal imagery on postcards marketed in Canada's Rocky Mountain Parks. These popular souvenir items have helped shape dominant systems of environmental knowledge. Because of this, postcards should be considered in discussions regarding the ecological health of the region.

Each one of these holidays included a trip to the local post office to mail postcards to friends and family back home. Until recently I gave little thought to the dozens of postcards purchased and sent on these annual vaca- tions. My current research, however, has me wondering about the broader environ- mental and cultural implications of this ritualistic holiday act. A large number of these souvenir items feature images of bears: bears that have become a commodity of "the wild." The following discussion considers this commodification as it relates to current environmental and interspecific concerns facing Canada's Rocky Mountain Parks. The study of postcards is, by necessity, an interdisciplinary venture, one that raises questions about the role of images and icons in the production of discursive systems (Nancy), as well as relationships between written and visual texts (Mitchell). These inexpensive, popular souvenir items have historically been neglected in the realm of academic inquiry, and it is only in recent years that scholars have considered how Mosaic 39/4 0027-1 276-06/0770 18$02.00Â©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">78 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) these cultural texts can have meaning beyond the realm of personal correspondence; as Annette Pritchard and Nigel Morgan argue, "picture postcards are a rich cultural reservoir of popular perceptions of people and places" (111). My own critical interest in postcards centres on the relationship of image and text; I ask, in particular, how these elements work to shape dominant cultural understandings of nature and the nonhuman world. In recent years, many environmental historians have argued that a perceptual division between ideals of "nature" and ideals of "culture" is at the root of many cur- rent environmental problems (see, e.g., William Cronon; Richard White; Neil Evernden). The notion that "nature" exists outside of and stands separate from human society and technology presents a challenge for addressing ecological prob- lems in the twenty-first century. Not only does this dominant way of thinking mask many environmental tensions, but also it creates a sense of separation between most people's lived experiences and the environmental impact of their day-to-day activi- ties. To conceive of "nature" as existing separately from "culture" is to deny the sense of interconnectedness that affects all forms of life on Earth. As Neil Evernden argues, "Nature is [. . .] nowhere near as independent or as 'given' as we like to suppose" (xii). For those concerned with addressing twenty-first century environmental issues, a critical re-thinking of what "nature" is and means is necessary. In nonhuman spaces designated world. This as National particular Parks, way of there framing exists and a specific engaging way with of viewing the nonhu- the nonhuman world. This particular way of framing and engaging with the nonhu- man world - what I refer to as "National Park Nature" - is thoroughly mediated by the tourism industry. National Park Nature frames the landscapes of Jasper and Banff National Parks as "unspoiled" and "pristine" "wilderness playgrounds" to which one can "escape" in order to engage in healthy recreational pursuits, gaze upon "exotic" scenery, and live in harmony (even if only for a few days) with the animals who are "protected" by Park borders. The repetition of visual and textual codes reinforces this position, and goes a long way toward masking very real environmental tensions in these landscapes. Canadian National Parks face many of the same stresses as other regions of the Canadian landscape, stresses that are masked through the rhetoric of "pristine" wilder- ness so dominant in National Park Nature. Philip Dearden points out, for instance, that "samples taken of the snow pack in the Rocky Mountain parks - sites that we think of as being among the most pristine on earth - show higher concentrations of many pesticides than near-urban and agricultural sites" (87). Acid rain, pollution, habitat fragmentation, and competition among native and introduced species of</page><page sequence="3">Ken Cronin 79 plants and animals affect the parks as much as they do areas that lie outside park boundaries (Searle 22-24) and, as such, representations of these landscapes as unin- fluenced by human activity, "wild," and environmentally pristine are, at best, well- intentioned myths. Moreover, as John Urry has argued, preserving a particular area for its "special environmental quality" often has the effect of drawing large crowds to the region, a process that creates a new set of environmental concerns. As Urry writes, "to designate somewhere as a national park is to generate a kind of magnet, sucking in potential visitors who otherwise might visit many different places" (189). The con- centration of thousands of visitors each year to Canadas national parks virtually ensures that the "pristine" and "untouched" qualities for which they are so often cel- ebrated will not be found. Visual technologies have set up very specific ideas of what nature means in a Canadian context; as Timothy Luke argues, the "green gaze" of landscape photogra- phy "becomes the normalizing framework for imagining what Nature really is" (44). This has had the result of masking human impact upon the nonhuman world and it does not address fundamental questions regarding consumption and human activity outside national park borders. Moreover, this point of view does not easily accom- modate introspective questioning regarding the status quo values that have created the social need for National Parks. Cultural production has long dictated the ways in which animals are conceived of and, ultimately, treated in Western society. From novels and fairy-tales to paintings, films, advertisements, and postcards, representations of nonhuman species continually shape the dynamics of interspecies interactions. These representations have firmly solidified the perceptual gap that exists between "nature" and "culture" in North America. In the realm of nature, such animals as bears, deer, and bighorn sheep are conceived of as "wild" and "untamed," while nonhuman animals encountered in spaces characterized by notions of "civilization" fit into very different systems of rep- resentation. In urban centres, for instance, nonhuman animals tend to be grouped into categories that label them as either "pets" or "pests," both commonly recognized as resulting from human desires, behaviours, and habits. Images of nonhuman animals have been part of the visual identity of Banff and Jasper National Parks for decades, and certain animal species have come to be syn- onymous with the wilderness experience of the region. However, as recent studies have indicated, populations of animals we tend to associate with Canada's Rocky Mountain Parks have, in fact, been a little less "natural" than current tourist promo- tions would have us believe. As Dick Dekker has argued, populations of animals we currently associate with Canada's Rocky Mountains have fluctuated over time due to</page><page sequence="4">80 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) human activities, among them hunting and, more recently, Parks management poli- cies (26-29). In spite of this, the current rhetoric of tourism promotion in Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks focuses on the "wildness" of faunai species in this region. A recent Parks Canada brochure, for instance, discusses the difference between animals in Park spaces and animals in urban zoos, a difference that, in this context, is being attributed to the relative "tameness" of zoo animals in comparison to the animals one might encounter while on holidays in Banff or Jasper. "Is there a difference," the brochure asks, "between a wild bear and one in a zoo? We can only guess what the bear might think. But from our perspective, isn't the very thing that makes wild animals so attrac- tive to us the fact that they are indeed wild? Unfortunately, when animals become used to being around people, they are in danger of losing that very thing that makes them special, their wildness" (Parks Canada 10). This sense of "wildness" leads readers of this pamphlet to believe that their experiences in the Canadian Rockies will be more authentic than their encounters with animals at a zoo or a theme park. Even though such publications rely on promoting a sense of "wildness" with regard to the nonhuman animals living in the Canadian Rockies, the history of visual representations of these animals tells a different story. In postcard imagery, familiar pictorial codes are adopted and, as such, have the effect of "taming" these animals according to dominant cultural expectations. Only selected species of animals are rep- resented, and they tend to be represented in ways that are both aesthetically-pleasing and non-threatening to human consumers of these objects. These popular images decontextualize the subject of the photograph from the lived actualities of the indi- vidual animal's day-to-day existence. As created Christopher through Steiner repetition argues, - as in he the writes, context "tourists of tourism, are not a looking sense of for authenticity the new but is created through repetition - as he writes, "tourists are not looking for the new but for the obvious and the familiar" (99). The postcard is one of the most common means by which this "iconographie redundancy" (92) is perpetuated and, as such, it plays a key role in defining what constitutes an authentic wilderness experience for the thousands of people who visit the region each year. Lucy Lippard describes post- cards as "photographic clichÃ©s" and argues that they are "at best [. . .] a consensus of what viewers hope to see" (138). In many ways this is true, as postcard imagery draws upon iconic imagery and shapes what is seen and experienced during these sorts of wilderness vacations in very powerful ways. However, there also exists an element of individuality operating within the consumption of postcard imagery. The purchasing and sending of postcards, Peter Osborne explains, also situates tourists as "subjects of</page><page sequence="5">KeÅi Cronin 81 their own performance" of travel (92). By participating in the cyclical process of post- card consumption, tourists visiting the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks not only claim a piece of the mountain landscape for a handful of pocket change, but also use these popular souvenir items as a means to stake their presence in this culturally- privileged landscape. The images and textual messages on these cards combined with the means of consumption - either mailing them to family and friends as "evidence" of individual presence in this space, or the addition of these cards to photographic albums upon the visitor's return home - personalize the tourist experience through a mass-marketed vehicle. Postcards, then, mediate between the individualized experience and the mass- produced vacation adventure that defines the wilderness industry in such places as Jasper and Banff National Parks. These spaces are the geographic "Other" to the day- to-day urban existence of most people living in North America, and this designation is reinforced through the textual and visual language consumed through the exchange and consumption of souvenir postcards. In particular, postcards featuring images of "wild" animals go a long way toward creating a geography of environmental differ- ence in the Rocky Mountain Parks. Among other things, the animals featured on these popular souvenir items signify a space that is markedly different from most people's day-to-day existence. In this context, images of bears found on picture postcards do not depict individual animals but, rather, come to stand as iconic symbols of what is expected in a commodified tourist encounter in such spaces as Banff and Jasper National Parks. A large on the part presence of tourist of expectations animal species in the that Canadian have come Rockies to has be historically collectively focused termed on the presence of animal species that have come to be collectively termed "wildlife." Postcards and other such souvenir items featuring photographs of animals help to construct and sustain what sociologist Adrian Franklin terms the "zoological gaze," or "the manner in which viewing animals has been organized socially over time" (7). In the context of Rocky Mountain tourism, there exists an expectation when one travels to these locations that one may have an encounter (albeit, it is hoped, a safe and mediated one) with such species as bears and mountain sheep - species that tend to be featured on picture postcards sent from the park. The promise of encounters with animals has been a significant tourist draw to destinations such as Banff and Jasper National Parks, and this is something that tourism promoters have continually emphasized in promotional materials. For instance, a 1934 brochure on Jasper National Park claims that:</page><page sequence="6">82 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) one of the great charms of the park is the abundance and fearlessness of its wild life. To wake in the morning and see a deer below one's window, a black bear ambling off into the forest, or, on the trail, to be able to come close to the shyest creatures of the wild, the moun- tain sheep and goat; to watch the beaver at his busy engineering or the lordly elk, moose and caribou making their stately way through the woods, is a pleasure which makes every walk or ride a possible adventure. (Canadian, Canadian 9) The expectations of interspecies relations deriving from these touristic promotions frames dominant understandings of what constitutes acceptable behaviour toward nonhuman species both within and beyond National Park borders. In this example, the nonhuman animals who inhabit the Park are presented as part of the scenery, existing entirely to be gazed upon and enjoyed by those who take their vacations in Jasper National Park. This hierarchy of species is replicated through the production of picture postcards, which serve as a lasting reminder of the vacation experience. Both the touristic encounter and the material object of remembrance normalize the implicit power dynamic that exists between human and nonhuman species in this context. As dard my own symbols personal of the postcard Canadian collection Rockies attests, and have certain been animals featured have prominently become stan- in dard symbols of the Canadian Rockies and have been featured prominently in tourist photography consumed in Jasper and Banff National Parks. While I have not conducted a scientific sampling of all the postcards ever sold in the Rocky Mountain Parks, it is safe to say that bears have featured prominently in postcard imagery for several decades. Much tourist photography in the region plays upon the sense of fas- cination Western society has traditionally had with bears (Shepard and Sanders). Many postcards sent from the Canadian Rockies repeat this theme: scenes of bears on golf courses, bears on hotel properties, small children feeding bears, bears approach- ing cars on the highway, and, my favourite, a bear sitting in the driver's seat of a car (Illus. 1). According to these examples, it would seem that the Canadian National Railway's claim that "comical bears are always on hand to greet visitors and pose for pictures" (Canadian, Jasper 25) is indeed the case in the Canadian Rockies. Postcard images depict bears as non-threatening and seemingly existing entirely for human enjoyment and entertainment. G. Morris Taylor's photograph, entitled "Four of a Kind, Jasper Park" (Illus. 2), demonstrates a very important link between imagery and industry in the construc- tion of National Park Nature. This photograph shows five black bears - a mother and four cubs - crossing the railroad tracks in Jasper National Park. It is significant that the corporate logo of the rail company is visible on the train cars behind the bears.</page><page sequence="7">KeÅi Cronin 83 1. Byron Harmon, "Black Bear," n.d.; postcard (from the collection of the author). Whether this compositional element was added by accident or on purpose, one is reminded of the economic interests both the CPR and the CNR have historically had in the Rocky Mountain Parks. These companies have continually relied on images of National Park Nature (of which ursine iconography is a significant part) to attract tourists to the region. As many postcards attest, the juxtaposition of so-called "wild" animals with evi- dence of human activity and technological innovation has been an especially popular component of Rocky Mountain tourism. The anthropomorphism evident in many postcard images trivializes these animals at the same time as it underscores the differ- ence thought to exist between human and nonhuman species. A postcard featuring a photograph of a bear in the driver's seat of a car, for instance, appears humorous because automobiles exist outside the realm in which we have been socially conditioned to expect to encounter such animals. Ideals of nature and culture remain distinct in these photographs; it is obvious which of these pictorial subjects is to be read as "wild" and which is to be understood as evidence of humankind's "taming" of the nonhuman world, even though the divisions between these two realms are not as clear-cut as they may first appear. The comparison between nature and culture (or "wild" and "tame") within the same pictorial frame strengthens dominant cultural understandings of both, in that each serves as a counterpoint to the other.</page><page sequence="8">84 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) 2. G. Morris Taylor, "Four of a Kind" n.d.; postcard (from the collection of the author). Bears may not drive automobiles, but their habits and habitats are necessarily intertwined with human activity. For instance, highways cut through ursine habitats (Alison; Savage) and the continual development of human infrastructure continues to put humans and bears in close proximity to one another, often with adverse results (Ebner; Hryciuk). These examples demonstrate the blurring of the boundaries sepa- rating ideals of "nature" from those thought to define the realm of "culture." As William Cronon argues, "to protect the nature that is all around us, we must think long and hard about the nature we carry inside our heads" ("Foreword" 22). In specific many encounter instances, the itself. animals This phenomenon on the picture is postcard often emphasized come to stand through for the the hand- inter- specific encounter itself. This phenomenon is often emphasized through the hand- written messages inscribed on the back of the card. This relationship between the mass- produced and the individualized is an especially interesting aspect of W. J.T. Mitchell's "image/text problematic" (7) in the context of postcard studies. Simply put, postcards are a mass-produced item sold in large quantities to the thousands of visitors who flock to Banff and Jasper Parks each year. Many people inevitably end up with the same post- card; however, both the message on the back and the personal connotations deriving from encounters with animal imagery (i.e., a nostalgic memory of one's own glimpse of a bear in the park or, conversely, pangs of regret at not experiencing the expected encounter) add an individualized element to these popular souvenir items. Illustration 3 is a good example of this process as it plays out on both sides of the picture postcard. This card, sent to a Miss Heather Peden in Minburn, Alberta in</page><page sequence="9">3. Byron Harmon, Front and back of "Black Bears," postmarked: 28 August 1951; postcard (from the collection of the author).</page><page sequence="10">86 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) 4. Joseph A. Weiss, "Hello You!" n.d.; postcard (courtesy Jasper Yellowhead Museum and Archives PA 73/3). Image has been reduced from its original size. August 1951, was postmarked in Banff and features a photograph taken by Byron Harmon of a mother bear and three cubs. Harmon is one of the best known photog- raphers in the history of the Rocky Mountain Parks, and his images continue to visu- ally define this region. This card is a good example of Harmon's animal imagery. The message on the back of this card reads: "Dear Heather, Here is a picture of the bears we keep watching for but haven't seen yet. We'll be at Banff tonight so I'm sure we will see some there. We've had a fine time. Love, Auntie." At the top of the card is an addi- tional message that was scrawled some time afterwards - it reads: "Later - we saw a bear and two cubs, a coyote, and some moose." Without a glimpse of the creatures depicted on the front of the card, it is implied, the wilderness experience would not have been complete. If imagery exoticizes the mountain landscape by replicating views of the non-urban, wilderness experience, the text used in conjunction with this imagery often serves to familiarize these spaces. It is this dichotomy between the seemingly exotic and the familiar that makes the study of postcards a particularly rich area for framing human relationships with the nonhuman world. The role of text in the process of familiarization becomes especially evident when we consider the role of pre-printed text on postcards - that is text that is part of the card's design as opposed to the personal, individualized notes scrawled on the back of the cards. In the context of animal imagery found on postcards, the addition of text serves to reframe human relationships with nonhuman animals. Illustration 4 is a good</page><page sequence="11">KeÅi Cronin 87 example of this, and is one of many photographic postcards that features people hap- pily engaging with bears in the Canadian Rockies. This postcard is entitled "Hello You" and shows a small child posed next to a bear cub in Jasper National Park. The photograph used in the card was taken by Joe Weiss, a Jasper-based photographer who operated a photographic studio in the Park during the early decades of the twen- tieth century (Collinson). The words "Hello You" on the front of the card serve as a functionalized transcript of the exchange taking place between the two central figures in this photograph. We are to read this as a friendly encounter, and the juxtaposition of a human baby with an animal "baby" would no doubt have made this a popular postcard image. The position of the two figures within the photographic frame is also significant. The child, dressed in white, stands on the walkway that runs alongside the cottage behind the two figures. Both the path and the cottage can be read as evidence of human domestication of this space. Conversely, the black bear stands on the edge of the nonhuman world. Despite the physical closeness of these two figures, the myth- ical divide that separates nature from culture is played out in this postcard. Postcards featuring text that recasts the behaviour of nonhuman animals in terms of human habits and customs have been especially popular over the course of the his- tory of Banff and Jasper National Parks. Dietary habits, in particular, have provided much material for popular postcard designs in recent decades. One postcard, for instance, features a photograph of three bears (a mother and two cubs) foraging for food around a garbage can. This, as visitors to the Rocky Mountain Parks are warned, becomes a common and dangerous occurrence when food (or waste containing human food) is left in the open. Open garbage bins attract bears into spaces claimed by humans (i.e., campgrounds, picnic sites, and hiking trails). This often leads to encounters that pose a threat to both species, however, the seriousness of a potential human-ursine encounter is negated by the caption on this card: "Ugh, peanut butter and jelly again!" Illustration 5 is another card that exemplifies this dynamic. It features a colour photograph of three bears gathered around an elegantly set outdoor dining table. The front of the card describes the scene as a "coffee break," and the pre-printed text on the back reads: "Afternoon refreshments are enjoyed on the lawns of a Canadian Rockies resort, with much gusto and noise, by three self-invited bears." Cards like this have historically been very popular - they are considered humorous because they show something unexpected. In these examples, the anthropomorphic qualities ascribed to the bears - complaining about their sandwich fillings or getting a caffeine fix - makes them seem somehow easier to relate to, and therefore, frames the potentially danger- ous, wild, and unknown as something familiar. This framing, of course, provides little comfort to either species when human-ursine encounters end in interspecies violence and bloodshed (Savage; Ebner).</page><page sequence="12">88 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) 5. Byron Harmon, "Coffee Break," n.d.; postcard (collection of the author). The study of the tourist imagery of the Canadian Rockies can be used to trace shifting attitudes and regulations governing human encounters with nonhuman species. There exist countless examples of both picture postcards and tourist snap- shots showing people posing with and feeding bears in Banff and Jasper National Parks. Illustration 6 reproduces a photograph taken approximately sixty years ago, and shows a group of young tourists enjoying the company of three young bear cubs. This image, taken from my own family history (the woman in the white skirt and dark sweater is my grandmother), is not an isolated example. In this photograph, and in many others like it, excited visitors to Banff National Park cluster around these "wild" animals as a species that would rarely be seen in one's home landscape. My grand- mother and her two girlfriends hold out tasty-looking morsels for the cubs, while two younger boys in the foreground convey, respectively, a sense of sheer fascination with the cubs (the boy on the right can barely tear his eyes away from the scene) and the need to record one's experience with wildlife in a visual format (the boy on the left is self-consciously looking back at the unidentified photographer of this scene). As this image demonstrates, human interaction with bears in Park spaces has not been limited to souvenir postcards. In the first few decades after Jasper was established as a national park, tourists were encouraged to actively engage with the ursine citizens of the region. Newspaper advertisements appearing in the Edmonton Journal during</page><page sequence="13">KeÅi Cronin 89 6. Family snapshot of author's grandmother and friends feeding the bears in Banff National Park, c. 1940 (collec- tion of author). the 1920s, for instance, encouraged people to ride the train from Edmonton to Jasper to see and feed the bears in the Park (Jones 168). The Canadian National Railway (CNR) actively promoted this type of "wilderness encounter" and facilitated means for Park visitors to interact with these animals. A promotional pamphlet produced by the CNR during the 1930s gives information about a special taxi service for tourists staying at the Jasper Park Lodge; for fifty cents guests could take a taxi from the front door of the Lodge to "see the bears" (Canadian, Jasper 29). The visual and textual mes- sages reproduced in pamphlets and on postcards created a sense of excitement around these excursions; "seeing the bears" became a standard part of the tourist itinerary in the Canadian Rockies. As ecological sensibilities towards nonhuman species have shifted, the framing of interspecies encounters also underwent a transformation. The front of one postcard features a photographic image to which colour has been added for visual effect. The image shows a mother bear, with her cubs, leaning into the passenger side window of an automobile parked along the side of the road. I have found other examples of this photograph used on postcards, and the repetition of the image certainly seems to val- idate earlier touristic encounters such as those offered by the CNR and experienced first-hand by my grandmother. The pre-printed text on the back of the card, however, tells a different story: "First lesson in panhandling. Feeding bears is strictly against</page><page sequence="14">90 Mosaic 39/4 (December 2006) Park regulations, for the protection of both parties but Mama can't read." This text makes reference to park policy, which forbids feeding the bears, however, the image on the front of the card suggests that this is still something that one might experience on their vacation to the Park (although the vintage of the car in the photograph could also be read as suggesting a more nostalgic look back at a seemingly simpler and, per- haps, less regulated time). Further, this postcard clearly reinforces a human-nonhu- man power dynamic; the text refers to the mother bear as an illiterate pan-handler, and the photograph depicts the bears in a "cute" and "entertaining" manner and, as such, reinforces the notion that nonhuman animals are disempowered creatures exist- ing for the exclusive enjoyment of visitors to the Parks. In recent years, activist and educational campaigns have begun to incorporate familiar postcard imagery in unexpected ways. For instance, in 1993, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS) launched a postcard campaign aimed at halt- ing development in Banff National Park. Subscribers to Borealisy CPAWS 's official pub- lication, were given postcards featuring photographs of recent construction projects in Banff bearing captions such as "Banff: Is this a National Park?" and "Not all Postcards from Banff are Pretty," and information about the rate of commercial development in the Park (Locke 3). Visual campaign material, such as the imagery used by CPAWS in this instance, rely on the well-known format of the picture postcard, but disrupt visual codes typically associated with the popular souvenir item. The blend of the familiar and the unexpected have made this an effective tool for environmental activism. In the early 1990s, Parks Canada and photo-finishing labs in Banff, Jasper, Lake Louise, and Waterton parks teamed up to create a postcard bearing the caption, "A Fed Animal is a Dead Animal," in four different languages in an attempt to discourage tourists from engaging in the common, yet highly dangerous, practice of feeding wildlife (Mugford 22). It is significant that a campaign aimed at disrupting the wilder- ness ideal would adopt the postcard format in an attempt to educate tourists about the problems associated with this behaviour. Most of the images used on this card were actual examples of tourist snapshots culled from the rolls of film dropped off for devel- oping at the participating photography businesses, and the similarity between these "snapshot" images and the popular postcard images speak to how widely accepted cer- tain ways of visually framing these landscapes has become. For instance, the photograph in the bottom left-hand corner has striking similarities to the photograph discussed in the previous example. Both images feature a mother bear and her cubs approaching humans in the relative comfort of their automobiles. The inclusion of the words "A Fed Animal is a Dead Animal" on this example, however, shifts the currency of these pho- tographs from tourist souvenirs to material objects of environmental education. This is one of the few photographic postcards from the Canadian Rocky</page><page sequence="15">KeÅi Cronin 91 Mountain Parks that breaks with traditional ways of representing nonhuman species. While these cards are consumed and distributed in a different manner than tradi- tional postcards - the "A Fed Animal is a Dead Animal" card is distributed free of charge by photo-finishing businesses - the fact that such a familiar format is being used in this manner speaks volumes about the power of these "ideal souvenirs" (Geary and Webb 3-4) to shape attitudes and behaviours.
