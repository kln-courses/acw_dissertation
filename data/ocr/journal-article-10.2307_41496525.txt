<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Neolithic to Chalcolithic in the Southern Caucasus: ECONOMY AND MACROLITHIC implements from Shulaveri-Shomu Sites of Kwemo-Kartli (Georgia) c. hamon Abstract: In Transcaucasia, the emergence of the first neolithic cultures can be dated to the middle of the 6th millennium ВС. The Shulaveri-Shomu culture, which occupies the middle course of the Kura valley, is among the best known Neolithic culture of Transcaucasia. As for the subsistence economy, the presence of a wide range of grinding and abrading tools is mentioned, but no real study of their technological evolution and functional implications has yet been carried out. The present work aims at better defining the techniques of cereal processing and the exploitation of mineral and animal resources through the stone assemblages of four sites of the Kwemo-Kartli region in Georgia. The implication of macrolithic tools in the technical system of the Shulaveri-Shomu culture is also discussed in terms of relative chronology of the sites and comparison with other neolithic and chalcolithic cultures from Transcaucasia. Using the macrolithic implements, the question of the relationship between the Shulaveri-Shomu tepe culture and the southern regions of the Near and Middle East is discussed. Résumé: En Transcaucasie, l'émergence des premières cultures néolithiques date du VT millénaire ВС. Celle de Shulaveri-Shomu, qui occupe le cours moyen de la Kura, compte parmi les cultures néolithiques les mieux connues de la région. Dans le domaine de l'économie de subsistance, un large éventail d'outils de broyage et de polissage est mentionné mais jusqu'à présent aucune étude de leur évolution technique et de leurs implications fonctionnelles n'avait été conduite. Par une analyse des assemblages en pierre de quatre sites de Kwemo-Kartli en Géorgie, le présent article vise à mieux définir les techniques de préparation des céréales et d'exploitation des ressources animales et minérales. L'implication de l'outillage macrolithique dans le système technique de la culture de Shulaveri- Shomu est également discuté en termes de chronologie relative et de comparaison avec d'autres cultures néolithiques et chalcolithiques de Transcaucasie. La question des relations entre celle de Shulaveri-Shomu et les cultures des régions plus méridionales du Proche et Moyen-Orient est discutée.

INTRODUCTION In the southern Caucasus or Transcaucasia, the emergence of the first Neolithic cultures is dated to the end of the 7th millennium cal. ВС or to the very beginning of the 6th mil- lennium cal. ВС.1 Two main processes of neolithisation have been recognized, respectively in the western and eastern parts 1.

Their territorial expansion broadly follows the major physical and climatic regions, showing a close relationship between these Neolithic populations and their environment. The lack of connections between these two entities can be partially explained by the landscape itself. Eastern and western Georgia are physically separated by the Likhi range which forms a boundary between the eastern open steppe plain, with its arid continental climate, and sub- tropical climate of the Black Sea shore and the rainy mountain- ous regions (fig. 1). DEFINITION OF THE NEOLITHIC IN TRANSCAUCASIA The chronological framework of the Georgian Neolithic and Chalcolithic (also called "Eneolithic") is still discussed today. In South Caucasus, the Neolithic has been diversely and successively determined by: • a certain type of pottery (which by definition excluded pre-ceramic populations), • a specific flint and obsidian industry (different from Mesolithic industries), • the adoption of a sedentary way of life (which excluded pastoral and semi-nomadic populations), • a subsistence economy based on agriculture. This explains why some sites have been attributed succes- sively to the Neolithic or the Chalcolithic.2 These approximate definitions, together with a lack of stratigraphy or reliable cali- brated radiocarbon dates, have generated two important prob- lems in research on the southern Caucasus: • differentiation between Mesolithic and pre-ceramic Neolithic populations, characterized by a specific lithic indus- try including axes and grinding tools, especially in western Georgia, • differentiation between the end of the Neolithic and the beginning of the Chalcolithic, reinforced by continuity of occupation on the "gora" or "tepe" (tell settlements) and by uniformity in material culture, especially on the Shulaveri- Shomu sites (metal objects excluded). Our study adopts the following definition of the Neolithic: a transformation of lifestyle, with a production economy based 2. A synthesis of the discussions on this topic can be found in Chataigner, 1995 and Kiguradze and Menabde, 2004 Paléorient, vol. 34.2, p. 85-135 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2008</page><page sequence="3">From Neolithic to Chalcolithic in the Southern Caucasus 87 on plant and animal domestication.3 In some cases, this was accompanied by the introduction of new techniques (ceram- ics), the widespread use of some others (stone and bone pol- ishing) and by change in settlement patterns. Throughout this paper, evidence of metal production is considered diagnostic of the Chalcolithic. THE NEOLITHIC OF EASTERN AND WESTERN GEORGIA Located in eastern Georgia, the Shulaveri-Shomu culture is one of the best known Neolithic cultures of Transcaucasia. Its central geographical distribution along the middle course of the Kura valley, between eastern Georgia and south Azer- baijan, makes it of prime importance for the study of the Neolithic of the whole Transcaucasian area. Preceded by the Nagutni preceramic culture, the Shulaveri-Shomu culture is characterized by circular mud-brick houses, domestic animals and cereals. The material culture includes handmade pottery with incised and relief decoration, an obsidian industry based on the production of regular blades with a high proportion of burins and scrapers, and large numbers of bone and ant- ler implements.4 The architecture and material culture are evidence for exchange and technical transfers between the Shulaveri-Shomu culture and Anatolian or Near Eastern Neo- lithic cultures. Compared to the Shulaveri-Shomu culture, the adoption of a Neolithic economy in western Transcaucasia follows a com- pletely different pattern since agriculture, pottery manufacture and new social structures do not appear simultaneously. Differ- ent cultural groups, broadly corresponding to the major land- scape zones (Black Sea shores, Colchida plain and Imeretie) share similar economic features. Their definition, relationships and dating are still unclear and their specificities are difficult to interpret in terms of chronology or regional factors. Although most sites are open-air settlements (Odishi, Anaseuli I and II, Kobuleti, Melouri), much of the fauna and plant remains come from rock shelters (Darkveti). Pre-ceramic occupations are characterized by two types of lithic production: flake produc- tion (blades, chisels and scrapers) is found in the highlands, whereas blade production characterizes the Colchis plain and the Black Sea shores (Anaseuli, Melouri).5 Pottery appears in the upper levels of the Imeretian rock-shelters and in the so-called Late Neolithic of the Black Sea shores (Odishi). Blades and large numbers of polished tools are found together with querns and grinders. The lack of organic remains explains our partial knowledge of the economy of these populations. Taking into consideration the material culture (the association of microlithic elements, polished adzes and ceramics), these groups probably participated in the process of neolithisation of the eastern shores of the Black sea.6 Nevertheless, they show very few relationships with the south-eastern Shulaveri-Shomu culture. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The aim of this article is to discuss the role of macrolithic implements in the subsistence economy and techniques of the Shulaveri-Shomu culture. Our study is based on a typo- technological and use-wear analysis7 of macrolithic imple- ments found on four sites of this culture. This work follows developments in research at an interna- tional level over the last fifteen years on the functional analysis of macrolithic tools.8 In the Near East, the pioneer work of M.C. Nierlé and K. Wright9 laid the grounds for a typological and technological classification of macrolithic implements, regard- less of their function. Despite the recent work of L. Dubreuil on the function of Natufian macrolithic tools,10 this functional approach has still to be applied to Neolithic contexts.11 In this study, we have adopted an international terminology proposed in a recent article for the study of so-called "mac- rolithic tools" and their typological, technological and func- tional analysis.12 The term "macrolithic tool" or "macrolithic implement" includes grinding, pounding, crushing and polish- ing tools, also called "ground stone tools"13 or "non-chipped stone tools", depending on the authors and the geographical area concerned.14 Cereal and plant processing constitute a primary focus of research. This question is all the more crucial as the cere- als cultivated in Transcaucasia are much more diverse than 3. Following A. LEROI-GOURHAN, 1988. 4. KIGURADZE, 1986; KlGURADZE and MENABDE, 2004. 5.

Cereal processing may have required specific grinding slabs or mortars, adapted to tasks such as dehusking, pounding or grinding. Consequently, study of grinding and pounding equipment can provide information about food preparation and change in dietary habits through the sequence. Macrolithic tools can also tell us about the activities taking place on Shulaveri- Shomu sites. For instance, can we identify temper or colour processing on grinding and pounding tools? What is the role of abrasion in the shaping of bone and stone tools? We will examine how the identification of such activi- ties can be interpreted in terms of economy, site status and chronological trends. Finally, we will consider the similarities between the mac- rolithic implements from the Kwemo-Kartli region and those from other Neolithic cultures of Transcaucasia, as well as their relationship with Chalcolithic cultures of south-east Georgia. Is there any continuity in the practices and techniques used between the two periods? Can we distinguish regional speci- ficities in the macrolithic tools? Their role in the Shulaveri- Shomu technical system and economy is discussed here through comparison with Neolithic cultures from western Transcaucasia and the Near East. Comparisons between the Shulaveri-Shomu complex and the contemporaneous Halaf and Hassuna cultures in north Mesopotamia, Jarmo in the Zagros and Haciiar in Anatolia have been made frequently (table 1). According to Kiguradze, the finds from the earliest layers of Shulaveri gora bear some close resemblances to material from the site of Haciiar.15 Some ceramic decoration patterns at Imi- ris gora are similar to Umm Dabaghiyah productions.16 The anthropomorphic figurines of the upper levels of Khramis Didi gora also evoke examples of the Hassuna, Halaf and Samarra cultures.17 Despite some similarities in the productions of all these cultures, the nature of their relationship is still not clearly established. What about macrolithic tools? Is there, for example, a complete similarity between the Shulaveri-Shomu cereal processing and that of Anatolia or Mesopotamia or do some distinctions reflect regional variations linked to the local economy and tradition? THE SHULAVERI-SHOMU CULTURE AND THE NEOLITHIC OF TRANSCAUCASIA ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEOLITHIC IN TRANSCAUCASIA The first Neolithic of central and south-east Georgia The first Neolithic of central Georgia is characterized by pre-ceramic settlements with an elaborate and non-Mesolithic flint or obsidian industry. Because of a lack of reliable radio- carbon dates, the Nagutni sites (Shida-Kartli) were first con- sidered Late Mesolithic but are now attributed to the Early Neolithic. Recent evidence suggests they date to before the Shulaveri-Shomu culture,18 even if a parallel development of the two cultures cannot be excluded for the end of the 6th mil- lennium BC cal. The economic and functional status of these sites is still under discussion, and closely resembles the west- ern sites of the Paluri group. The sites of Paravani I and II may correspond to seasonal obsidian exploitation on the shores of Lake Paravani.19 The ori- gin of these groups is still undetermined. Do they correspond to the emergence of a local Neolithic culture that would have been swept away by the Neolithic communities from the Near East, at the origin of the development of the Shulaveri-Shomu culture? Or did they coexist with the first Shulaveri-Shomu populations in the region? Further investigations in Georgia 15. KIGURADZE, 1986. 16. KAVTARADZE, 1981. 17. GLONTI et al., 1975. 18.

The Shulaveri-Shomu culture The Shulaveri-Shomu culture occupied the middle course of the Kura (Mtkvari) from the 6th to the beginning of the 5th millennium cal. ВС. Today it corresponds to south-east Georgia and west Azerbaijan but it also extends southward into the Armenian regions of the Ararat valley.20 This territory broadly prefigures the geographical distribution of the later Sioni (Chalcolithic) and Kuro-Araxe (Early Bronze Age) com- plexes. Georgian sites of the Shulaveri-Shomu complexe were first considered Chalcolithic, but this culture is now included in the Neolithic, except for the latest layers where metal artefacts have been found, as for example in the upper levels of Khramis Didi gora and Aruchlo I. In fact, the Shulaveri-Shomu culture has a similar economic basis to contemporary Neolithic cul- tures of eastern Anatolia. THE SHULAVERI-SHOMU CULTURE SITES OF THE KWEMO-KARTLI REGION Sites and excavations In Georgia, the Shulaveri-Shomu culture is mostly known through excavations conducted in the Kwemo-Kartli region (fig. 1). The sites are generally located on the most fertile land alongside rivers, not far from the foothills. The sites of Shulaveri, Imiris and Khramis Didi gora were excavated by a team from the National Museum of Georgia, directed first by O. Djaparidze and A. Djavaxishvili and then by T. Kiguradze and M. Menabde. In Aruchlo I, excavations and sondages were first con- ducted under the direction of T. Chubinishvili between 1966 and 1976 and D. Gogelia between 1978 and 1985. Since 2005, new excavations are in progress.21 The chronology of the Kwemo-Kartlian sites is based on ten levels dated to the Neolithic, and on two upper levels dated to the beginning of the Chalcolithic.22 These levels have been recognized on four main sites: Shulaveri gora and Imiris gora (Kwemo-Shulaveri group), Khramis Didi gora (Kachagani group) and Aruchlo I (Nachiduri group). Some smaller or little- known sites such as Dangreuli gora (only known through two small trial trenches) or Gadačrili gora (Shulaveri group) com- plete our knowledge of this regional entity. Most of these sites have been partly disturbed by later occupations dating from the Bronze Age, the Roman period or the Middle Ages. Stratigraphy and dating The sites generally cover less than 1 ha, except for Khramis Didi gora whose surface area is 4 to 5 ha.23 Nine (Shulaveri and Khramis Didi gora) to seven (Imiris gora and Aruchlo I) layers of occupation or destruction have been recognised on the mounds. The height of the stratigraphy is quite stable, as the nine Neolithic layers represent 4 to 5 m of a total stratig- raphy of 7 m at Shulaveri gora, and there are about 6,5 m at Khramis Didi gora. In Aruchlo I, the six building horizons correspond to about 5 m.24 According to Kiguradze's ceramic study, five stages can be identified. The lowest levels of Shulaveri gora (levels IX-IV) are the earliest of this culture, and the upper levels (levels III-I) are considered to be contemporaneous with the lowest level of Imiris gora (levels VII-VI). The upper levels of this site (lev- els IV-I) are themselves contemporary with the lowest level of Khramis Didi gora (levels IX-VI).25 While the ceramic seria- tion has not been discussed since then, there has been some debate about the position of Aruchlo I in the sequence. On the basis of early but uncertain radiocarbon dates26 and some spe- cific features of the lithic material, the site of Aruchlo I was considered very early. However, following analysis of all the finds and a reassessment of the radiocarbon dates, it is now suggested that Aruchlo I occupies a rather late position in the sequence. 27 The l4C dates from the four main sites of Kwemo-Kartli and also from Shomu Tepe, Toïre Tepe and Gargalar Tepesi in Azerbaijan are confusing, due to variation in sampling, cal- culation and laboratories (table l).28 According to these dates, the Shulaveri-Shomu culture began in the second half of the 6th millennium ВС and ended in the middle of the 5th millen- nium.

HAMON and Göy Tepe (Azerbaijan)30 reveal that the Shulaveri-Shomu culture appeared at the beginning of the 7th millennium ВС rather than in the second half of the 6th millennium ВС. Settlements and architecture The architecture is characterized by use of plano-convex mud-bricks for the building of circular, oval or semi-oval buildings with diameters ranging from 1,5 to 4,5 m.31 Some of the forty buildings excavated at Shulaveri gora have coni- cal corbelled clay roofs. Adobe stucco was found on outer and inner sides of the walls. The larger buildings (2 to 5 m in diam- eter) are interpreted as living areas whereas the smaller ones (1-2 m diameter) are considered as "artisan" areas where stor- age and production activities may have taken place.32 The same type of architecture has been found in Imiris gora, but with an important "innovation": the buildings are sometimes organised around a central courtyard (Imiris gora, Aruchlo I).33 Some circular or oval hearths have been found in these courtyards. A system of three protective ditches of varying depth and width has been discovered around the site of Aruchlo I, located at the intersection of two rivers, as well as around Imiris gora. Funerary customs Little information is available concerning funerary prac- tices. Tombs were discovered at Shulaveri gora and Aruchlo I. Their dating is not always clear. At Shulaveri gora, four graves (among which one double inhumation) were discovered; as they cut into the mud-brick buildings, they could be later than the Neolithic.34 At Aruchlo I, two tombs have been found right beneath the floor of some houses or in an enclosure between levels III and V: a teenager was found in tomb 10 with no associated finds; whereas two bone objects (a point and a knife) were dis- covered in tomb 11. Three other tombs were located next to half-sunken huts around the tell and cannot be precisely dated to the Shulaveri-Shomu culture. Covered by small heaps of stones, they all show obvious traces of ochre. A red-coloured pot was found in tomb 7, and another in tomb 8 in association with a cornelian bead. Two bone points and two carnelian beads were found next to a 50-55 years old woman in tomb 9.35 SHULAVERI-SHOMU SUBSISTENCE ECONOMY During the 6th millennium cal. ВС, Kwemo-Kartli was characterised by a dry continental to a semi-arid climate.36 According to palynological data,37 there was "an extensive savanna on the plains, dense gallery forests along river courses and oak-hornbeam forests on the foothills" favourable for irri- gation. These climatic conditions favoured the development of an agricultural system involving the cultivation of a broad range of domestic plants and the breeding of animals. From the earliest occupation layers, bones of domesticated goat, sheep, cow, pig and even dog are present. They represent about 80% of the fauna at Shulaveri gora and 90% at Khra- mis Didi gora. There is also a wide range of wild mammals including deer, wolf, fox, aurochs, horse and gazelle, as well as turtles, birds and fishes.38 Nine species of wheat ( Triticum diccoccum , T. mono- coccum, T. aestivum , T. turgidum T. compaction, T. Durum , T. spelta , T. macha , T. paleo -colchicum) have been identified together with barley (Hordeum vulgare and Hordeum disti- chum ), oat ( Avena sativa ), rye {Secale cereale) and millet {Pan- icům sativum).39 According to plant remains from Aruchlo I and Khramis Didi gora, T. aestivo-compactum was dominant, followed by T. diccoccum or T. spelta, whilst the other spe- cies of wheat were much rarer.40 Barley {Hordeum vulgare) and legumes such as lentils {Lens esculenta ), peas {Pisum sati- vum) and beans {Vicia) were also present. The earliest traces of grapevine {Vinis vitifera) were found at Shulaveri gora.41 One of the most crucial questions concerns the appear- ance of domesticated cereals in Transcaucasia. Although some endemic species were apparently domesticated locally {T. macha, T. paleo-colchidum ), the question remains open for the main types of cereals {T. diccoccum, T. monococcum, T. aestivum). The great variety of endemic wheat species in Transcaucasia could have favoured local domestication of cereals, even if these cereals were already cultivated in the Near East. According to different authors,42 following various hypotheses on the appearance of a Neolithic economy in Tran- scaucasia (an imported Neolithic economy with or without movement of population, local domestication and spontaneous 30.

As for the Shulaveri-Shomu culture, the two hypotheses are still debated.43 The exceptional diversity of the cereal species cultivated on Shulaveri-Shomu sites is of great interest in terms of cereal processing and dietary habits. The possible correlation between the use of specific cereals and the grinding and pounding equipment deserves to be examined in more detail, as regards dehusking or grinding and more generally the preparation of cereals. SHULAVERI-SHOMU MATERIAL CULTURE AND TECHNICAL SYSTEM Ceramic production The handmade pottery of the Shulaveri-Shomu culture is made from local clay. Sand, "chamotte" (or grog), basalt and plant materials are used as temper in the lowest layers, whereas plant materials are dominant in the later pottery: • in phase I (layers XI-IV), there are coarse, ovoid pots with a protruding base, • in phase II, incised patterns appear on fine pottery, • in phase III, there are coarse brown to red ceramics with flat bases and relief decoration, • in phase IV, some fragments of painted pots are found in disturbed layers, • in phase V (upper levels of Khramis Didi gora), fine red polished pottery becomes predominant.44 Regional variations can also be seen in ceramic production, such as the Shulaveri gora and Khramis Didi gora groups. Chipped stone industry The obsidian industry comes from different sources includ- ing the Trialeti mountains.45 The proportion of obsidian in the assemblages increases over time, as at Shulaveri gora where obsidian represents 82% of the chipped stone industry in the lower level IX and 98% in the upper level I. In phases I to III, the blade industry is relatively standard- ized, as shown by the high quantity of conical cores and long, wide parallel macroblades found on the sites. Blades and segments of blades measure up to 15 cm. In phase IV, flake production increases to become predominant in phase V.46 Lithic tools change very little throughout the sequence. Bur- ins, scrapers, splintered pieces, drills and denticulated blades make up the standard tool-kit. At Shulaveri gora, half of the lithic artefacts are tools and these are mainly chisels, scrapers and splintered pieces. Agricultural activities are reflected by sickle blades and adzes.47 Bone industry The bone industry is rather standardized throughout the sequence and composed of a majority of spatulas, awls and spoons together with needles and arrows. Some antler dig- ging sticks (or hoes) are also present from phase III onwards. At Imiris gora, spatula and awls are shaped by abrasion and polishing. A genuine diversity in bone and antler production can be underlined at Khramis Didi gora, with a large series of perforated axes, maceheads and splintered tools in antler. At Aruchlo, biconical needles and perforated antler objects constitute the main items. The typology and technology of Shulaveri-Shomu bone and antler tools appear broadly related to the standard production found on Near Eastern Neolithic sites.48 Anthropomorphic figurines An abundant assemblage of anthropomorphic figurines has been found, especially in phase IV and V (over 60 examples at Khramis Didi gora). These figurines are generally seated women represented in a realistic way. They are interpreted as votive items dedicated to a cult of fertility and are reminiscent of similar examples produced in the Near East. Metal The earliest metal objects are in arsenical copper and come from Khramis Didi gora, levels VI and VII, and from Aruchlo I. Their appearance coincides with a general deterio- ration of the lithic industry and stone toolkit.49 Thus the latest levels of these two sites can be considered Chalcolithic or at least transitional between the Neolithic and the Chalcolithic. 43.

Kiguradze had already discussed some characteristics of grinding stones, massive pounder-mortar tools, "palettes", "hammer stones", "rubbing stones", "grooved stones" and stone vessels.50 This study includes 568 macrolithic tools coming from four main sites of the Shulaveri- Shomu culture: 70 from Shulaveri gora, 170 from Imiris Gora, 285 from Khramis Didi gora and 43 from Aruchlo (table 2). Unfortunately, the stratigraphie context of the objects is not always mentioned in the inventories, and thus it is impos- sible to relate stone objects to building levels on all the sites. In addition to this problem, the finds of the latest excavation at Khramis Didi gora have not been completely analysed, as finds were still being processed in August 2006. The classification of the macrolithic implements has been made first by activity (grinding, pounding, hammering, polish- ing and rubbing), then by the position of the tools (working Table 3 -Average dimensions of the main categories of tool.

QUERNS AND GRINDERS Querns constitute the lower part of the grinding equipment, in association with a "grinder" manipulated with two hands in a back-and-forth movement. The majority of the 75 grinding tools are made of vesicular basalts (66%), although sandstones were also used (24%). 85% of the querns and 60% of their upper parts were made of basalts. Querns The 25 querns have been divided into three main types, on the basis of their shape (table 4, figs. 4, 8, 14 and 21). • Quadrangular grinding slabs (ten examples) are gener- ally broken: fragments generally range from one to two thirds of the tools. These large quadrangular querns often show an important concavity (up to 11 cm). Two variants are attested: - "saddle-shaped querns"53 (seven examples). These tools are generally made on basalt cobbles, and their back is naturally convex. Flat slabs are included in this variant. They are particularly thin and regular, and scarcely concave on the working surface, but a distinct ledge of 2 to 3 cm wide is visible on the edge of the object and can show traces of flaking (fig. 4a), - "saddle-shaped slabs" (three examples). These tools are generally preserved for two thirds of their length and show regular concave surfaces (fig. 8b). The 51. ADAMS, 2002; HAMON, 2006; NIERLÉ, 1982; WRIGHT, 1992. 52. Wright, 1992. 53.

Different stages of pecking can be distin- guished on the working surface. These tools have often been used or reused for the grinding of pigments. • Ovoid (nine examples) or triangular (three examples) querns, with two distal edges and a strong concavity (figs. 3a, 5a, c). The back of the tools show polished zones. One is illus- trated for Shulaveri gora.54 • Narrow querns of quadrangular shape (two examples). They are broken in two and have a semi-circular section. The working surface is slightly concave and the back of the tool is hammered. Quern variability can be partially attributed to morphologi- cal change in a tool during its use, such as the deformation of the working surface and the presence or not of an edge on its ends and periphery. All types of querns have been used or re- used for colour processing. According to functional data, these cases must be interpreted as a re-use of grinding stones that were first used for cereals. Another example of re-use at Imiris gora is represented by a quern with a groove on its back. Grinders Most of the 50 grinders are of "short type": their length is less than the width of the corresponding lower tool (table 5, figs. 3b, 5, 9, 14 and 22). Coarse sandstones, calcareous sandstones and compact vesicular basalts are used for their manufacture. The tools are semi-circular to ovoid in shape ("bread-shaped") and semi-circular to flat quadrangular in sections55 (fig. 2a). The sides are shaped by flaking and the ends often show two or three steps of flaking. Pecking was used in order to smooth the back and side edges and allow a better grasp. The flat to plano-convex working surfaces were often pecked trans- versely. A polishing zone of 2 to 3 cm wide occupies the ends and sides if not the whole periphery of the working surface of these grinders. Some of the tools have two working surfaces on opposing sides. One isolated example of a grinder from Imiris (n° 148) is quadrangular in shape and in section. Two symmetrical grooves, parallel to the sides, were made by a longitudinal pecking and create a very specific section. The function of this arrangement is uncertain. Another example of ovoid grinder from Imiris (n° 198) (fig. 9f) has been re-used: its opposite face shows traces of polishing on the central part. 54. KIGURADZE, 1986: 22, fig. II: 37. 55.

Other grinding tools A third type of grinding tool can be isolated from among the undetermined objects (two examples). They could not be classified with certainty either as a grinder or a quern. These are flat, ovoid tools with a quadrangular, regular section. They are long and narrow, fairly standardized, and present two working surfaces on the opposite faces (figs. 3c and 9i-j). The working surface is plano-concave and is particularly abrasive since it is made of vesicular basalt. The sides of these tools are regularly pecked, the edge retouched and the working surface smoothed. This morphology is difficult to interpret in terms of function. As a quern, its function would have been quite different from the large quadrangular or ovoid ones, but as a grinder no association can be found with any of the lower slabs present. POUNDING TOOLS: MORTARS AND POUNDERS J. Adams defines the mortar as "a basin that confines an intermediate substance that is worked with a pestle in some combination of crushing, stirring, or pounding strokes."56 As well as mortars and pestles, an original type of grinding tool has been found on the Shulaveri- Shomu sites: we will use by default the term "grinding slab" to describe it. It belongs to Adams' general category of netherstones.57 Mortars Granite and basalt were used for five mortars (table 6, figs. 6 and 13a). Massive examples were found in Shulaveri gora and Imiris gora. The two examples have been broken at half of their length, in the middle of the depression.58 On a natural block, a flat surface has been chosen to create a circular depression about 10 cm deep and wide. A narrow strip 2 to 3 cm wide occupies the periphery of the depression; it is probably due to the shaping of the hole by hammering and pecking. The break- ing of the mortar may be the consequence of a strong gesture of pounding in the depression, where the tool is the thinnest. Inside the depression, use-wear reveals impacts of percussion and circular grinding. One quern has been gradually trans- formed into a so-called "mortar" (n°480) (fig. 14a). The initial working surface has been gradually transformed in order to obtain a deep working surface, the concavity of which starts at 56. ADAMS, 2002: 126. 57. Ibid.: 143. 58. KlGURADZE, 1986: fig.

The working surface shows circu- lar grinding and even vertical crushing in its centre. Pestles Two types of pestles in basalts (50%), sandstones (11%) and metamorphic rocks (34%) were found on the Shulaveri- Shomu sites (table 7, figs. 6, 11, 15 and 20). Two variants can be distinguished amongst these 68 tools: • The first type (11 examples) presents ends with fine per- cussion and smoothing of the edges. - The tronconical type with a circular section is shaped on all its sides (two examples) (fig. 15b). Both ends are flattened because of the repetition of a crush- ing action, but one end is much wider and presents crushed edges. - The cylindrical type with a circular section shows no differences between its two ends (nine examples) (fig. lib). The impacts of percussion have often over- lapped the edges and spread onto the sides of the pes- tle (fig. 3e). The impacts are rather coarse and deep, regular and well delimited. In one case, one of the ends has been violently crushed and shows a large and deep impact of percussion in its centre. These pestles are also frequently used on their faces and can be used as crushing hand stones. In this case, one to four of their sides present small cavities created by per- cussion and associated with other traces of use such as striations and polishing. The centre of one pestle (n°173 from Imiris) (fig. 11a), has been thinned by pecking in order to obtain an object with two promi- nent ends and a central part for handling. • The second type includes used cobbles of more varied shapes (57 examples) and smaller dimensions, although the largest one measures 26 x 10 x 5 cm (figs. 2b and 23b). The two ends show coarse impacts of percussion. Some samples show actual shaping and narrowing of the central part of the object for a better grip. Sometimes, polishing can be observed on the sides. Grinding slabs Amongst eleven grinding slabs, eight special tools in sand- stone or quartzitic sandstone were found at Imiris gora (table 8, figs. 3d and 10). These lower tools have been used in a circular gesture of grinding. We have not yet been able to identify the associated upper tools. These opposite faces of these circu- lar tools are tronconical in section. They are complete except in one case. Their morphology and shaping are particularly standardized. One of the working surfaces is always larger in diameter than the other. The side is shaped by the removal of regular flakes from one face to another. The edge is also sometimes retouched. The slightly concave working surfaces are characterized by a smoothing of their periphery and some rare impacts of percussion located in their centre. One example from Khramis Didi gora (n°488, fig. 17a) has been used both as a grinding table and as an anvil, as suggested by the small cavity created by percussion in the centre of one face. PERCUSSION TOOLS Anvils and hammer stones are characterized by a wide range of actions of percussion on the matter. Anvils can be used as lower tools for multiple activities, as shown by the numerous impacts of percussion, the polish and the incisions on the surface.59 Hammer stones show different zones of per- cussion, on their ends, sides and faces. Crushing cobbles are characterized by impacts of percussion concentred on a small zone on one or both faces, used primarily for the crushing of large fragments into smaller ones. Anvils The six anvils found in Shulaveri and Imiris gora are mas- sive cobbles of various raw materials: limestone, granite, sand- stone or metamorphic rocks (table 9). They are also of various dimensions but never exceed 20 cm in length and width.

The centre of one thick fragment of limestone presents a circular cavity of percussion. Sometimes, one of the faces or one of the corners bears significant impacts of percussion. Hammer stones Six types are represented among the 148 hammer stones (table 10, figs. 7, 12 and 16). They are made of andesite, basalt, limestone, dolerite, sandstone, quartzite and one unidentified metamorphic rock. • One hundred and twenty three hammer stones made on cobbles of metamorphic rocks (and more rarely limestone), are quadrangular or circular in shape. Dimensions are quite uni- form, although there are two main groups (fig. 2c). On some of them, one or more sides show important flak- ing created by percussion; these hammer stones were not used for a long time since the flaked zones are not completely crushed. Another category associates impacts of percussion with a coarse flaking from the use of one or two sides. One side and one or two corners show traces of crushing and smoothing. Crushing generally concerns the levelled edges: • One spherical cobble made of a dense black metamorphic rock was broken in its larger diameter (5,6 x 6 cm). The edges and head of this half cobble wear some percussion impacts. • The only example of a "hammer" was found broken in half; its dimensions are therefore rather small (5,8 x 4,3 x 2,1 cm) (fig. 19o). Despite a general quadrangular shape, the end of the hammer is thicker and it must have been used for percussion. Some lateral notches were prepared for hafting. A vertical per- foration was made perpendicular to the edge by percussion. • Few hammer stones were used as grinders. Made of meta- morphic rock, they are circular in shape but quadrangular in section. Their ends are natural, their faces bear striations or pol- ished zones and their sides are finely and completely pecked. • One quadrangular example from Khramis Didi gora is made of vesicular basalt (9,8 x 8 x 7 cm) (fig. 16k). The face and sides are pecked and polished, whereas the ends are flat- tened by percussion. • One cobble has been flaked symmetrically on both of its sides in order to obtain a pointed end (9,4 x 6,4 x 4 cm). The upper parts are macroflaked while the sides are microfla- ked (fig. 16m). The natural surface has been maintained on its base, certainly for handling purposes. The tool's morphology indicates that it was used to work material deeply. Paléorient, vol. 34.2, p. 85-135 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2008</page><page sequence="16">100 С.

They show at least two small cavities of percussion on two of their faces, and sometimes also on their sides (fig. 3f). These small cavities directly damage the natural surface, or occupy a pecked surface with polished zones. Such notches have thin- ned down the central part as if intended for hafting. The mor- phology and size of the cavities differ from one face to the other. The ends can also be flattened by repetitive percussion, or be damaged by macroflaking. This type of tool is generally used for two purposes: as a pestle (impacts covering the ends) or as a hand stone (the faces associated with the small cavities have extensive polish and transverse striations). This suggests a double gesture of crushing and grinding. Most of these tools were used for ochre processing, as suggested by remains found in the interstices. POLISHING AND ABRADING TOOLS Different kind of polishers can be defined after their mor- phology and the location of the different use-wear traces.60 They may be implied in a wide range of activities for the shap- ing and sharpening of different tools and objects. No nether- stones, defined as "bottom tools against which something was worked",61 were found on Shulaveri- Shomu sites. We refer here to the generic meaning of hand stones as a "large set of handheld tools."62 They share the same general morphology as grinders, but their shape, dimensions and use-wear show a totally different kinetic and use. Handheld polishers Seven hand polishers are made of fine sandstone or tender limestone (table 12, fig. 17). Two quadrangular polishers with triangular sections present several concave faces. Sometimes the hand polishers are made of flat pieces of sandstone. Their upper face is generally concave and covered by a uniform use- wear: it presents a lateral edge. A transverse gesture of rub- bing, with a slight movement of the hand, may have created this particular morphology. Prismatic polishers Three prismatic polishers have been found (table 12, fig. 17). They are made of homogeneous metamorphic rocks. All the faces of these very particular polishers present a uniform use- wear and a pronounced concavity, with a longitudinal distor- tion. Some corners are also levelled by polishing. Sometimes, longitudinal striations can be observed. Use-wear distribution on the surfaces suggests a transverse polishing movement. 60.

Ilk and Khramis Didi gora n° 367, fig. 17e). A longitudinal groove with a "U" section and more or less parallel sides occupies the centre of this tool. Because of the poor quality of the raw mate- rial, they often look like natural grooves. • Two discoid cobbles of quartzite (Khramis Didi gora n°397: 9,2 X 9 X 3,2 cm) (fig. 17f) and sandstone (Imiris gora n° 103: 9 X 7 X 5,1 cm) have a slightly convex base. The "V" sectioned groove has parallel sides. The upper face and the groove are completely polished. Some longitudinal striations occur in the bottom of the grooves.

RAMON • In Imiris, one grooved abrader is of particular type (n° 127: 19 X 8 X 4 cm) (figs. 3g and llj); a long, thin and "V" sectioned groove is located on the longitudinal axe of a cobble of fine sandstone. A regular, longitudinal incision is visible inside the groove. Type 2 could correspond to a form of grooved abrader (with transverse grooves) as known in Anatolia and also in Aratashen63 at the same period. Sharpeners Ten tools can be classified as sharpeners, even if their actual function may be diverse (figs. 13e, 16c and 19p). Six long cobbles of metamorphic rock present some resi- dues of metal oxides on their natural surfaces. They are associ- ated with striations and distortions of the surfaces caused by polishing or re-sharpening gestures. Three other small, flat fragments present groups of stria- tions associated with levelled zones of polishing. The groups of striations indicate the orientation of the abrasion gesture. This kind of use has also thinned and narrowed the end of one tool. One limestone cobble was also used as a sharpener (14 X 5 X 4,5 cm) (fig. 13e). One face of this sub-cylindrical object shows regular polishing and transverse striations. The natural curvature of the surface was distorted by use. Hand stones Thirty-eight hand stones of ovoid shape and of small size were made on thick cobbles of various rocks (five basalt, seven sandstone, six granite, eight metamorphic rock and one limestone) (figs. 71, 12g, 15b, h and 161). No shaping has been identified (fig. 2e). One or two opposite faces present polished areas with short transverse striations (fig. 3h). Traces of ochre are often visible on the surface of these tools. The edges are often completely smoothed, and indicate the same use as the working surface. Hand stone 80 (fig. 12m) from Imiris gora is a cobble of large dimensions with traces of use as an anvil and pestle. Five of the hand stones were also used as hammer stones, and six as pestles, like many crushing cobbles. Other polishing tools Two more examples belong to the category of polishing tools even if their function is not yet determined. Tool 513 of Khramis Didi gora was first attributed to the category of adzes, due to its morphological and technical char- acteristics. It has been shaped from a green soft metamorphic rock, of a particular kind which has no equivalent in the series (11 X 4,2 X 1,6 cm). The pattern of use-wear demonstrates its re-use as a shaft straightener or smoother. The object shows several levelled zones characterized by an extensive polish associated with groups of striations. Each zone corresponds to one moment of the object's use. The sides have long linear striations, one end shows traces of microflaking and the centre of one face has been used for fine percussion. Tool 114 from Imiris presents the same morphological and use-wear characteristics (16 x 5 x 1,8 cm). Made of soft lime- stone, this losange-shaped object presents an edge-like end and levelled zones, with an extensive polish and groups of fine stri- ations indicating the direction of movement. Both faces show obvious impacts of superficial percussion. ADZES AND CHISELS Several types of tools can be grouped together in the family of axes and adzes. They are all made of dark green heteroge- neous metamorphic cobbles. None of these objects have been found in Shulaveri gora, 5 come from Imiris gora, 75 from Khramis Didi gora and 17 from Aruchlo I. Adzes Ninety adzes or similar tools have been found: 4 in Imiris, 81 in Khramis Didi gora (fig. 16) and 4 in Aruchlo (fig. 20). They consist of several types of cobbles and blanks made of green or black metamorphic rocks, and more rarely quartzite. Several degrees of know-how can be distinguished in the shap- ing of these tools. Adzes have been shaped either on retouched natural cobbles or flakes. The tools are approximately trian- gular, and present a semi-circular to lenticular section.64 Two unsymmetrical rough-outs had been abandoned. The edges are generally convex, rarely flat. The flaking is generally irregu- lar and deep. The butt of the adzes is shaped by flaking. The surfaces are regularized by an extensive pecking, before fine polishing. The polishing is generally made on the first third of the adze. Facets of polishing show longitudinal striations on the faces and sides. They correspond to the different steps of shaping, use and re-sharpening of the adzes. The edge is pol- ished transversely over approximately half a centimetre wide. 63.

Paléorient, vol. 34.2, p. 85-135 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2008</page><page sequence="19">From Neolithic to Chalcolithic in the Southern Caucasus 103 The edge is often microflaked when not completely damaged by use. A fragment of adze has a vertical, cylindrical perfora- tion at mid-length, for hafting. Given the multiple stages of use, re-use and re-sharpening of the adzes, their "life" must have been quite long. It seems that these tools were used until they could not be re-sharpened at all. An adze from Khramis Didi gora has been notched on its sides, in order to isolate two different parts: the blade itself and the base ready for hafting. This part was thinned by hammer- ing. This adze is unique in the Shulaveri-Shomu sites but its technology resembles examples from the Neolithic site of Odi- shi in Colchida and also from the Chalcolithic sites of Imere- tie.65 Although the morphology is not identical, this tool could be the only clue of contact between the two Neolithic entities of eastern and western Georgia. One category of "adze-pestle" has been distinguished in order to describe the last stage of use or re-use of axes or adzes (three examples in Aruchlo and one in Imiris, fig. 20f, g). The edge of these former adzes has been completely flattened by percussion: the ovoid surface presents all the characteristics of use as a pestle. The morphology is suitable for precise handling (approximately 9x5x4 cm). These tools show fine impacts of percussion and a smoothing of the periphery of the surface. What was initially a simple case of re-use finally creates a new category of tool in the Shulaveri-Shomu series. Narrow edged adzes On three flat quadrangular cobbles of metamorphic rock, one special type of tool has been shaped. The natural surface has been retained on the base of the cobble, perhaps for haft- ing or handling. The sides have been regularly flaked out in order to thin the tool gradually and to obtain an edge of less than 2 cm wide. This narrow edge is surrounded by a dense pecking and is polished on no more than 2 cm long, with very thin and dense striations orientated either transversely or lon- gitudinally. Polished facets indicate the different stages of use and shaping of the edge. Only part of the tool has been shaped, mainly by regular flaking. Chisels The scheme of shaping and preparation of adzes has also been used for the making of six chisels made on small ovoid flat cobbles (fig. 16a-b). The chisels sometimes have bilat- eral microflaking on their sides. Some present fine traces of pecking and thin striations. A levelled edge is generally but not systematically made by flaking; it is either polished or microflaked, and may be associated with the removal of large secondary flakes. The other edge is either macroflaked or flat- tened by percussion. Chisels are only present in Khramis Didi gora, where stone vessels were found. Use-wear analysis has not been carried out on these tools, but they may have been used for shaping the stone vessel described below. PALETTES Four natural cobbles from Imiris (n°79, 92, 160) (fig. 10a) and Aruchlo (n°285) (fig. 20k) show coloured deposits and slightly distorted zones of use on one or two of their faces (figs. 3i and 10a). The raw material has not been identified. The coloured areas present long, deep regular striations orientated longitudinally. These tools can be interpreted as palettes used for the soft grinding and the mixing of black or red colours just before their use. The aspect of the deposit evokes the prep- aration of a kind of paste, which would explain the absence of actual traces of colouring powder. They constitute further evidence for the processing of ochre on the Shulaveri-Shomu sites, already attested by the presence of colouring matters on other crushing, pounding and grinding tools. In Imiris, another tool (n° 160) (fig. 10a) can be identified as a palette: it is a massive ovoid cobble (26 x 19 x 4 cm) with a wide zone covered by longitudinal striations and peripheral traces of ochre. LIMESTONE ITEMS All the 28 items are made of soft limestone (table 13). They are only present in Khramis Didi gora (19 examples) (figs. 18 and 19). Stone vessels Two types of stone vessels have been found in Khramis Didi gora (n°335, 406, 472, 479): one with a vertical rim66 (three examples) and another in the shape of an open bowl (one example) (fig. 18). Their base is either flat or round, and they measure around 8x5x5 cm. The pots were probably first hol- lowed out by hammering and pecking, traces of which have been identified. The rims are generally shaped by carving with 65. Niebieridze, 1978. 66. The globular bowl 117 of Wrigth's terminology (WRIGHT, 1992).

Most of the rims were first shaped by subhorizontal retouch, and then levelled by polishing. Next, the inside of the pots was scraped, as shown by the oblique and horizontal grooves along the rims and sides. Fine pecking was used to flatten the sides and edges. Both the inside and the outside were smoothed by polishing. "Mortars" Small cavities have been observed on eight quadrangu- lar blocks of limestone (n°348, 360, 363, 364, 385, 407, 419) (fig. 18). A fine strip of pecking occurs on the periphery of these small-cavities, reflecting a preforming stage. The sides of the blocks are coarsely flaked to produce an approximate shape. These objects are interpreted as mortars, even if they have little in common with the so-called massive mortars. Their function certainly differs from the massive ones, but their interpretation is a mystery. Stone rings Four broken rough-outs of limestone rings and one nearly finished have been found (n°332, 473, 474, 475) (fig. 19 1-m). They represent half or a quarter of the initial rings. Their sec- tion is quadrangular and there are two sizes. The two opposite faces are flat, the external side is convex, and a central edge has been shaped. A biconical perforation has been made by percussion, removal of flakes and scraping of the internal sur- face. Fine pecking and superficial scraping were also used for the surfaces. The function of these rings remains unknown, but they are clearly not ornaments. One circular fragment (n°470) is hammered on its external surface. Some linear traces of scraping are visible at the top of the perforation made by circular abrasion. This object is per- haps a preform of a macehead, a hammer or even a weight. "Hammers" Five so-called "hammers" in limestone have been identi- fied (n° 349, 416, 468) (fig. 19d-g); one similar example is made of vesicular basalt. These objects present two "heads" of tri- angular shape and ovoid section, reminiscent of present-day geological hammers. They are separated by a central groove for hafting almost 1 cm wide, and are shaped by pecking. Inside the groove, some thin linear traces suggest a system of strings to hold the object. The sides (one flat, one convex) have been shaped by regu- lar flaking. Pecking and scraping complete the shaping. The pointed ends are slightly crushed and microflaked by use. On one object, an end has been regularly pecked and a perforation was attempted by circular abrasion: different systems of haft- ing may have existed for these types of limestone hammers.

Picks Among the three limestone picks or "smoothers", one dou- ble pointed tool (n°435: 26 x 4,5 x 3,2 cm) (fig. 19a) has traces of polishing together with longitudinal striations and superfi- cial grooves from rubbing. One of the pointed ends has been created by a longitudinal rather than circular movement of pol- ishing. DIVERSE OBJECTS Massive block with small cavities A natural massive block (52 x 59 x 28 cm) of hard lime- stone was found in Khramis Didi gora. The sides were coarsely flaked. A large perforation, 16 cm wide and 14 cm deep, has been made in the centre. Twelve cavities of 3 to 7 cm in diam- eter were set around this perforation. They were made by a repetitive crushing action. Perforated objects Limestone items are not included in this paragraph (see above). Maceheads The five maceheads are of two types and present approxi- mately centred cylindrical perforation. For the first type, large ovoid cobbles of siliceous rock or vesicular basalt have been selected. One of the ends has been flattened by crushing, and there is a large circular perforation in the centre of the tool. Because of the hypothetical position of the hafting and the location of hammering traces, this tool may have been used as a hammer or a mace. The second type is per- fectly spherical (two examples: n° 156: 13 x 13 x 12,8 cm from Imiris gora and n°470: 5,6 x 4,6 x 3,8 cm from Khramis Didi gora). Fragments of sandstone, basalt or limestone have been perfectly shaped by pecking, and regularized by polishing. Special techniques must have been used to give a shiny aspect to the surfaces. The cylindrical perforation was made by abra- sion, according to the circular traces that can be observed at the bottom of the cavity. This object must have had a symbolic value as no traces of use have been detected (for example a sceptre). Spindle-whorls Two discoid cobbles of metamorphic rocks or basalt were perforated. The perforation is tronconical and under 5 cm in diameter. Although these objects are extremely rare at Khramis Didi gora, they can be interpreted as spindle whorls (fig. 19i). Undetermined perforated cobbles (fig. 19j-n) Nine basalt cobbles, mostly ovoid in shape, present a natural surface without any visible use-wear.67 A tronconical perforation occupies the centre (fig. 3j). When the perfora- tion has not been made by percussion, circular traces suggest the use of a mechanical system. They can be interpreted as weights. A unique circular object was found at Khramis Didi gora. The first steps of a small circular perforation (less than 1 cm deep) are visible on its upper part while the whole external surface has been regularised. A triangular object in limestone can be interpreted as an ornament.68 Its faces are covered by polished and striated lev- elled surfaces, organized longitudinally (fig. 3j). A biconical perforation was made for suspension next to one end. Splintered tools Eight splintered tools have been found on all the sites except Shulaveri (table 14, fig. 13g-h). They are made of cylindrical or ovoid cobbles in metamorphic rock and present worked ends: macro and microflaking are visible on one end while crush- ing and percussion impacts are associated on the opposite end. Impacts of pecking are sometimes concentrated on the faces. These tools can be considered as splintered tools, used to remove superficial matter. Sling-stones Small cobbles of sandstone or limestone of regular dimen- sions (30 to 40g) do not show traces of use. They can be inter- preted as sling-stones, for the hunting of small mammals or birds for example. Ochre One disc of ochre is present in Khramis Didi gora (n°467: 6,2 x 5,8 x 2,4 cm) (fig. 19q). Several facets of abrasion are visible on its periphery, while striations show the orientation of the main direction of use. According to use-wear distribution, 67. KIGURADZE, 1986: figs. 10-16. 68.

MACROLITHIC IMPLEMENTS AND THE SHULAVERI-SHOMU SITES OF KWEMO-KARTLI MACROLITHIC IMPLEMENTS AND THE STATUS OF KWEMO-KARTLIAN SITES Even if the four Kwemo-Kartli sites broadly share the same macrolithic toolkit, actual specificities can be identified through functional analysis. However, interpretation is diffi- cult in terms of chronology because of the general lack of stra- tigraphie context for these objects. The site of Shulaveri gora presents a high ratio of grinding tools, as if food preparation was still a major activity. In fact several categories of tool are rare if not completely absent in Shulaveri gora. The lack of pestles, polishing tools, splintered tools and crushing cobbles could reflect the minor importance of craft activities. The diversity of hammer stones fits with a multifunctional use and a lack of specialisation. Finally, the importance of cereal processing on the oldest site of Kwemo- Kartli would reflect the central role occupied by food proces- sing for Shulaveri- Shomu populations that first settled. While there are no polishers at Shulaveri gora, polishing and abrading activities have been identified at Imiris gora and Khramis Didi gora. At Imiris gora, there is a specific grinding slab, as well as mortars and pestles. In fact lower tools are attested on the site. The particular status of grinding and pounding activi- ties at Imiris gora is illustrated by a specific grinding slab (six examples), with only one or two examples on the other sites. These circular and double faced tools are of standard shape and were certainly used to produce a fine mineral powder (linked or not with grinding colours). Pestles also constitute an important part of the stone toolkit. Colour processing played an important role in activities at Imiris gora, as suggested by a wide range of objects used for this activity, such as pestles, grinding slabs and palettes. The macrolithic tool assemblage of Khramis Didi gora is the most diversified from Kwemo-Kartli. Its two main particu- larities are the high number of adzes and the presence of an original limestone vessel. All the stages of shaping (by flaking, pecking and polishing) and use of the adzes are represented. While function of these tools as adzes is clear, their abundance is difficult to interpret. Does this over-representation corre- spond to additional clearance for the creation of new living or agricultural areas? Did these tools have a different function, such as wood working for other purposes (building, etc.)? Limestone objects including rings, mortars, pots, spoons, spindle-whorls and hammers were found only in Khramis Didi gora. The presence of stone vessels could be linked to the important series of anthropomorphic clay figurines found on the site, as both productions reveal aesthetic expression and a high level of expertise. Given the complete absence of lime- stone vessels on the other sites of Kwemo-Kartli, this tech- nique may have been imported from southern regions where stone vessels are well known.69 This diversity of macrolithic tool equipment in Khramis Didi gora is not an isolated feature, as shown by the rest of the material culture: this is especially noticeable for the bone and 69. See for example the halafian site of Tell Amarna, in TUNCA and MOLIST, 2004.

MACROLITHIC TOOLS FUNCTION AND ACTIVITIES ON KWEMO-KARTLIAN SITES A use-wear analysis was conducted at low magnification, in order to determine the exact function of each category of tool. Given the diversity of raw materials, our initial methodol- ogy had to be adapted.71 The main problem concerned basalt tools for which we had no experimental reference examples. We refer to Dubreuil's work for a description of experimental use-wear on basalt tools.72 Specific optical equipment was used for the functional analysis. As there were no suitable binocular microscopes in the various Georgian archaeological institu- tions, we decided to work with the "Proscope©" system. This enables observations up to x200 (with four lenses at x5, x20, x50, xlOO and x200). Its handiness was particularly well suited to the rather mobile working conditions, despite the low qual- ity of the photographs produced. Eighty-nine objects out of 554 have been analysed: 20 objects from Shulaveri gora, 28 from Imiris gora, 33 from Khramis Didi gora and eight from Aruchlo I (table 15). Almost all categories of tools and objects have been chosen: grinders and querns, mortars, pestles, palettes, hammer stones, polish- ers, hand stones, perforated and grooved abraders (table 16). Half of the querns and two-thirds of the grinders (79%) were used for cereal processing. 40% of the first and 15% of the second were used to grind a mineral material, including pigments. These proportions can be interpreted in terms of dif- ferent re-use: it seems that querns were much more recycled than the upper tools, especially for the grinding of pigments or as anvils for their crushing. But their initial function was cer- tainly for cereal grinding. Considering more precisely the mor- phology of grinding tools, all types of lower parts were used both for cereal and processing of pigments whereas a majority of the ovoid upper parts were used for cereal processing (78%) while quadrangular ones were used for mineral grinding (only two objects).

A similar function can be mentioned for crushing cobbles and for grinding slabs which were used especially for the grinding of a very fine and abrasive mineral powder (which could correspond to a colouring powder). The importance of this colouring activity is confirmed by the fact that two thirds of the hand stones were used for it. Three polishers were used for mineral abrasion (polishing of axes or adze-like tools), whereas one grooved abrader was used for bone abrasion. According to our analysis, the activities are represented as follows: 24 tools were used for cereal grinding, 12 for mineral grinding and 19 for colouring grinding or preparation (including one palette, two fragments of colouring material and four tools used for the preparation of a colouring paste or for its applica- tion on a soft material). Bone grinding has been identified on two objects, while bone abrasion concerns only one grooved abrader. Four polishers were used for hard mineral polishing (such as axe or adze polishing).

Finally, the use of eight other tools is still undetermined. Cereal processing, grinding of pigments and stone pol- ishing are the three main activities represented. The respec- tive proportions of these activities between the different sites underline several tendencies: • In Shulaveri gora, cereal processing is dominant (65%), contrary to Khramis Didi gora where cereal processing is scarcely represented. This observation fits with the relatively diversified tool categories and morphologies on the latter site. • The proportion of mineral matter grinding is equivalent on the four sites, even if this observation is based on a very small number of tools. This activity is not specific to one par- ticular site. • Pigment grinding is also rather stable on three sites but is quite rare in Shulaveri gora, which could imply that this activity had not yet appeared when Shulaveri gora was first occupied. At Shulaveri gora, food preparation and cereal process- ing constitute the main activity carried out with macrolithic tools. At Imiris, a broad range of macrolithic tools was used for mineral and pigment grinding. At Khramis Didi gora, diversified macrolithic equipment appears with stone vessels and intensive use of adzes. Despite a common economic basis, real specificities can be isolated in the activities of the different occupations. The lack of stratigraphie contexts for the objects make these specificities difficult to interpret. Yet the earliest sites, Shulaveri gora and Imiris gora, show much evidence for cereal processing, with more diverse activities (pigment grind- ing) and macrolithic implements (grinding slabs and palettes in Imiris gora / adzes and limestone vessel at Khramis Didi gora) characterizing the later sites. MACROLITHIC TOOLS EVOLUTION AND CHRONOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS Even if the exact stratigraphie position of the objects is not known, a seriation of the tool sub-categories on the four sites provides some elements for consideration of chronological trends in the macrolithic toolkit. Our discussion will rely on the seriation initially proposed by Kiguradze.73 73. KIGURADZE, 1986: 99. Paléorient, vol. 34.2, p. 85-135 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2008</page><page sequence="25">From Neolithic to Chalcolithic in the Southern Caucasus 109 Chronology of the grinding tools We will first examine change in the shape of grinders on the four sites. Kiguradze has already observed that saddle querns and longer grinders appear in stage III of his classifica- tion of the Kwemo-Kartlian sites, and are still present in the next stages. The distribution of flat and short grinders is not uniform between the sites, both in number and proportions. The chro- nology of querns is not as clear. At Shulaveri gora, flat grinders are completely absent despite numerous grinding tools. All querns are concave and present a distal or peripheral edge, such as the saddle quern from level IV.74 One massive mortar was also found in the same level. At Imiris gora, both types of grinders (short and flat) coex- ist in equivalent proportions. A massive mortar was also found on the site. Querns of ovoid or quadrangular shapes are more or less concave and are delimited only in some cases by a distal edge. The morphology of querns is slightly different in Imiris gora, as ovoid flat tools are much more numerous in level V and quadrangular flat tools appear in level IV.75 At Khramis Didi gora, on the contrary, short grinders are rare compared to flat ones, whatever the raw material. Querns still show a certain concavity but no longer have a distal edge. On all the sites, massive concave querns coexist with nar- row flat ones. In conclusion, a chronological development can be pro- posed from short grinders / ovoid concave querns with distal or peripheral edges at the beginning of the sequence to flat grinders / plano-concave querns without edges at the end of the sequence. Narrow grinding tools could be late, but their scar- city makes interpretation difficult. Given this general trend, it does seem that the relative frequency of each category of quern and grinder offers a reliable means of obtaining an approxi- mate dating. Macrolithic tools and the chronological position of Aruchlo The seriation of macrolithic tools confirms the succession of Shulaveri gora and Imiris gora, and the late position of Khramis Didi gora in the chronological sequence. The study of macrolithic tools from Aruchlo I provides new evidence for its chronological position in the sequence of the Shulaveri-Shomu sites from Kwemo-Kartli. Two querns from Aruchlo (one with a peripheral rim and one ovoid tool with a strong concavity) look very much like examples from Shu- laveri gora. The relative frequency of tools used for pigment processing at Aruchlo I is similar to Imiris gora but lower than Khramis Didi gora. As at Imiris gora, pigment palettes have been found at Aruchlo. In addition, the function of the macro- lithic implements from Arucho I is very close to the spectrum identified in Imiris gora. These elements indicate a degree of similarity between the macrolithic tools from Aruchlo I and the latest layers of Imiris gora. This could be interpreted as evidence for their relative contemporaneity. In the light of these observations, a chronological trend can be proposed for macrolithic implements. At the beginning of the sequence, food procurement was still the main preoccupa- tion of the Shulaveri-Shomu populations. The development of the settlements of Imiris gora and Aruchlo I induced a diversi- fication of activities, among which pigment processing took an increasing part. This diversification of the macrolithic toolkit culminates in Khramis Didi gora. The development of this set- tlement required new territory, with forest clearance suggested by the presence of adzes. This development has enabled con- siderable craft and artistic production, like stone vessels and anthropomorphic figurines, which may have increased in par- allel with reinforcement of exchange with southern cultures. KWEMO-KARTLIAN MACROLITHIC TOOLKITS IN THEIR REGIONAL AND CULTURAL CONTEXT An important and unsolved question is the place occupied by these Kwemo-Kartlian toolkits within the Neolithic and Chalcolithic of Transcaucasia. Can some comparisons help us understand the origin and specificities of these sites within a regional context? Kwemo-Kartli among the Neolithic and Eneolithic cultures of eastern Transcaucasia Some comparisons can be made with the help of illustra- tions of macrolithic artefacts from Transcaucasia. For example, a quern with two small cavities from Shomu tepe is similar to one from Khramis Didi gora with a dozen small cavities on its face.76 But most comparisons are with Chalcolithic sites from east- ern Transcaucasia. On the Early Chalcolithic site of Kliltepe 74. KIGURADZE, 1986. 75. Chronological attribution after MASSON, 1982: 142. 76. After NARIMANOV, 1965.

These common features match the chronological sequence established by Kiguradze between the different horizons of the Shulaveri-Shomu culture.79 The oldest layers of Khramis Didi gora (IX-VI) are broadly contemporary with Shomutepe, whereas the later layers of Khramis Didi gora (IV-I) correspond to the industry of KíilTepe I and perhaps Tekhut as well. All these observations seem to confirm that the upper lay- ers of Khramis Didi gora are rather late in the sequence and date to the beginning of the Chalcolithic period. East-West relationships during the Neolithic and early Chalcolithic Very few grinding tools have been identified at Odishi (Colchida plain). One ovoid grinder is narrow and presents two distal edges,80 characteristics that correspond to the equipment of stage 4 of the Shulaveri-Shomu culture, i.e. the Neolithic- Chalcolithic transition (Khramis V-I). On this sole basis, the site of Odishi should date to the end of the Shulaveri-Shomu culture, and thus corresponds to the end of the Neolithic in western Georgia. West Georgian adzes are more massive and do not have the same shaping "chaîne opératoire" as in the Shulaveri-Shomu culture. The shaping of small natural cobbles characterizes the adzes of the Shulaveri-Shomu culture, whereas an actual sequence of shaping has been recognized on western sites. In addition to "shouldered" adzes of specific morphology, all the stages of adze shaping are found on western Neolithic sites: rough-out, flakes and even re-used adzes occur together in the assemblages. In fact, no correlation between western and east- ern adzes can be established. According to Lukin,81 the site of Kistrik (Abkhazia) offers a more diversified toolkit. Pestles and splintered tools on cob- bles, grooved abraders and small adzes share some features with Shulaveri-Shomu tools. Ovoid oblong querns, made on unshaped cobbles of basalt, are quite similar to the Neolithic ones from Kwemo-Kartli. In conclusion, very few comparisons can be drawn between the Neolithic grinding tools from eastern and western Georgia. If some contacts between western and eastern Neolithic cul- tures of Georgia have occurred, they apparently concerned the subsistence economy rather than "craft" activities. Kwemo-Kartli and the Neolithic cultures of the Near East On the basis of published macrolithic implements, Shulaveri-Shomu tools from Kwemo-Kartli have no char- acteristics in common with the poor macrolithic tools of the steppe cultures of north Caucasus, where querns are small and there are no mortars.82 Rather broad comparisons can be made between Shulaveri-Shomu and Near Eastern macrolithic tools, especially since macrolithic implements from the Kwemo- Kartlian sites cannot be attributed to precise layers. Never- theless, a chronological trend in macrolithic implements can be established. The grinding and pounding tools, tronconic pestles, perforated cobbles and massive mortars from the first layers of the Shulaveri-Shomu culture also occur in aceramic and Neolithic horizons in central and eastern Anatolia.83 A closer look at possible similarities between Shulaveri- shomu and Halaf macrolithic tools enables us to define some common features, which can rarely be considered significant because of the ubiquity of macrolithic tool types throughout Anatolia and Mesopotamia. Macrolithic implements from the upper layers of Shulaveri gora and from the layers of Imiris are apparently very similar to late Neolithic and early Halafian tools from Anatolia. The basalt grinding and pounding equipment from the Late Neolithic and Early Halafian layers of Tell Sabi Abyad in Syria84 is very similar to the material from Shulaveri and Imi- ris gora. On the Syrian site, conical or cylindrical pestles were used either with portable or massive mortars. One palette with red and black traces of pigment was also identified. Traces of ochre are mentioned for the majority of the macrolithic assem- blage, as well as on the floors of several small rooms.85 Tronconical pestles, grinding slabs used for ochre process- ing, palettes, small polished chisels and one grooved cobble from Late Neolithic levels (II-VI) at Hacilar in south-western Anatolia86 are similar to those found on the Shulaveri-Shomu 77.

Mortars are also made in the same coarse rocks as at Shulaveri and Imiris gora. Palettes from Late Neolithic levels (VI-VII) of Hacilar87 are very similar to Imiris gora ones, as are many of the palettes from the Halafian layers of Tell Kosak Shamali.88 Ochre processing seems quite an important activity in the intermediate layers of the Shulaveri-Shomu culture and early Halaf. Nevertheless, ochre processing on grinding stones and palettes has been widely recorded in the Near East, on a broad chronological and geographical scale. The use of ochre for painting, as in the decoration of Hacilar buildings at Hacilar,89 is a possible explanation for the large quantities of ochre pro- cessed on Shulaveri-Shomu sites. Common features are shared between the latest occupa- tion layers of Khramis Didi gora and the middle to late Halaf culture. The presence of exclusively flat slabs in level VIII of Kurban Höyük confirms the chronological match between the end of the Shulaveri-Shomu culture and the middle Halaf culture.90 A large slab with several small cavities from Khra- mis Didi Gora looks very much like a tool found in the Halaf phases I and II of Tilkitepe.91 Limestone vessels, similar to the one found in Khramis Didi Gora, are also frequent in Halafian contexts.92 The connection between macrolithic tools of the Neolithic cultures of Kwemo-Kartli and Anatolia can only be estab- lished on a broad geographical and chronological scale. As for the internal seriation of Shulaveri-Shomu culture macrolithic tools, these comparisons are difficult to interpret, given the slow rate of change in these tools throughout the region, from the very beginning of the Neolithic to the beginning of the Chalcolithic. Shulaveri-Shomu versus Sioni macrolithictools The relationship between the Shulaveri-Shomu culture from Kwemo-Kartli and the following Chalcolithic Sioni culture in the eastern part of Georgia is not yet clear. The Sioni culture has been recently identified through pottery, but more work is required on its economy and origins. The ear- liest ceramics are mineral tempered, while later material is straw tempered. The pottery is flat-bottomed, with an ovoid to sinuous profile which becomes more angular at a later stage. Incisions on the rim and comb-made designs constitute the main decoration, but relief decoration is scarce even though comparable to Shulaveri. Painted pottery is found in small quantities on the sites, and some examples from Berikldeebi may have been wheel-made.93 Depending on regional and probable chronological variations, the nature of the settle- ments varies (open-air settlements, rock- shelters, etc.), as does the architecture (buildings made of stone or mud-brick, semi- sunken structures). The sites are generally of short duration. Several features point to an important change in subsistence economy: a dominant flake industry, simple bone and macro- lithic tools, and coarse pottery.94 Several authors have pointed out the possible relationship between the two cultural entities of Shulaveri-Shomu and Sioni, especially when considering the ceramic material.95 The examination of Sioni macrolithic tools has raised the question of the subsistence economy of the Chalcolithic population, as well as its possible link to the Shulaveri-Shomu culture. Is there continuity between the two cultural entities in terms of stone- tool assemblages and techniques of plant food preparation? In fact, Sioni grinding and pounding tools from the Aragvi valley share very few morphological and technical character- istics with the Shulaveri-Shomu material.96 The Sioni grind- ing tools are made on short basalt cobbles, abundant along the riverbed of the Aragvi. They present very few traces of shap- ing and preparation, which could reflect a short use-life. They occur together with numerous small mortars (average diameter 12 cm) and crushing hand stones with small cavities. Unfor- tunately, large numbers of concretions in the cavities of many mortars made the application of use-wear analysis difficult. Several grinding stones were apparently used for cereal pro- cessing and a few mortars for processing other plants. A few pestles were used for pounding mineral matter. Pestles were thus used mainly for plant food preparation. These results are very similar to those obtained on several sites of the Chalco- lithic culture of Maikop (4th millennium),97 and provide evi- dence for a decrease in cereal processing. Several geographical factors could perhaps explain the differences between the two assemblages: raw material avail- ability, a specific subsistence economy related to the hilly landscape, and so on... But the clear homogeneity of tool morphology and shaping suggests a different interpretation. In fact, macrolithic tools indicate a real shift in food preparation 87. MELLAART, 1978: fig. 174. 88.

They must illustrate a deeper change in the subsistence economy and economic basis of the Sioni populations compared to the agricultural, sedentary way of life of the Shulaveri-Shomu populations of Kwemo-Kartli. CONCLUSION If cereal processing appears to be the main activity at Shu- laveri gora, the importance of ochre processing at Imiris gora and the diversification of the stone toolkit (stone vessels and adzes) at Khramis Didi gora demonstrate the implication of macrolithic implements not only in the subsistence economy but also in the processes of craft production at the end of the Shulaveri-Shomu sequence. The functional specificities of each settlement can be interpreted in terms of both activities and chronological and cultural relationships. Change in the morphology of grinding tools through the sequence and the connections between the pounding equipment (mortars and pestles) from Kwemo-Kartli and material from eastern Ana- tolia and northern Mesopotamia all provide additional infor- mation on the economic and cultural background of these Georgian sites. The results presented here only represent a first stage in the study of Neolithic and Chalcolithic macrolithic implements of Transcaucasia. Their significant role in domestic and craft activities raises new questions about the Shulaveri-Shomu culture, especially concerning the importance of pigment processing and its final use. But they also offer the opportu- nity to make broader comparisons, firstly with west Georgian Neolithic macrolithic implements, secondly with finds from Chalcolithic settlements of the Sioni culture, and lastly with material from various Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultural con- texts in Anatolia and Mesopotamia. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study was funded by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, through a post-doctoral Lavoisier grant in 2005-2006. I would first like to thank B. Lyonnet (CNRS, UMR 7192) and Z. Makharadze (National Museum, Tbilisi) for their constant help and academic support. My thanks go also to colleagues from the Archaeology Department of the National Museum of Tbilisi: to M. Menabde who gave me access to the collections and to T. Kiguradze's documentation, and to N. Grigolava, M. Jalabadze, T. Meshveliani and E. Qoridze for their constant help in this work. I am also grateful to G. Mirtskhulava (Tbilisi Centre for Archaeological Science) and S. Hansen (Deutsche Archäeologisches Institut) for showing me the finds from Aruchlo I. The study of the Sioni macrolithic toolkits from the Aragvi valley would not have been possible without the collaboration of G. Chikovani, and the help of G. Kogodjouri from the Centre for Archaeological Science, Tbilisi. Lastly I would like to thank C. Chataigner and B. Lyonnet for all their help in the correction of this article, and M. Ilett for the great work on the correction of the English language.
