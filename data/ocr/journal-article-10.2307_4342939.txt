<plain_text><page sequence="1">Classical Landscape with Figures. By OSBERT LANCASTER. Illustrated by the author. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1949. Pp. 224; 8 plates. $4.00. The author of this highly unorthodox guide to Greece has attracted considerable attention in recent months by another book, There'll Always Be a Drayneflete, a gay, happy, and pungent satire of his native Enigland in which few of the conceits, prejudices, and foibles of English society escape his probing wit. If one approaches Classical Landscape witli Figures with such a picture of the author in min-d, he will be prepared to be amused and entertained by a certaiin iconoclastic satire, as well as instructed by sound scholar- ship and a genuine sympathy for the land and people of Greece. The author's early evaluation of his own work will quickly dispel any illusion that the traditionial pose of scholar and commentator is to be maintained. As a dis- claimer of political wisdom, consider this statement: "I approximate spiritually more to the mule-ridinig female water-colourist, and ... the present work is likely to be considered closer in feeling to Little Walks iii Leafy UmTbria (now unfortunately out of print) than to Stormn int the Caucasus or Wings over Olyminpus."

Similarly one is invited to picture the leaders of school groups in Greece "gripping tight their Pausanias and resolutely turning their backs on anything post- dating the battle of Chaeronea." As an evidence of historical perspective, one might ponder the following observation: "History [is] a meaningless fantasy if not interpreted in the light of present day experience." One steeped in the literary and archaeological evi- dence for the inevitability of anthropomorphism in Greek religion may be startled by, though he can scarcely dis- agree with, Mr. Lancaster's reason for including human figures almost invariably in his illustrations: "In the high Alps or on the vast plains of Eastern Europe man is re- duced to complete unimportance and neither his presence nor his absence can possibly affect in the smallest degree the scene's significance, but here all the natural features seem to have been deliberately conceived in relation to our human stature ... the birth of humanism could only have occurred in a setting where man's proportion was so exquisitely adjusted to his environment" (10). One might wistfully say in passing, however, that there is a peculiar charm, to the sketch of the little shrine with two birds only in the foreground (110) as well as to the Boeotian marshland with a similar motif (100), despite the condemnatory quotation from John Henry Newman that appears immediately beneath the latter sketch. The practice of gathering encomia of antiquity from the great and the near great is gently chided by the quotation from George Bernard Shaw which introduces the second chapter: "However, I am at least quit of Athens, with its stupid classic Acropolis and smashed pillars." This may suffice for the purpose and method of the author. What of the contents? Landscape, antiquities, personalities, temperaments, political and social j udg- ments, and mediaeval customs are the stuff of the story, whether told in narrative or through the excellent colored plates, full-page line drawings, and very numerous small sketches by the author that dot the pages. Here one will miss few details from the panorama of Greece: the shepherd and his woebegone dog, tiny chapels and roadside shrines, a crusading knight, fantastically crowded buses and trolley cars, moustached "thugs," gesticulating traffic officers, pretty girls, pompous clerics, eager sponge-sellers, bored magazine-stand proprietors, modernistic buildings, and massed telephone wires find a place-and a happy one. Mr. Lancaster has conscien- tiously lettered in most of the commercial signs, in mod- ern Greek, that delight the newly arrived visitor in a Greek city. One last subjective comment. The author disclaims any intention to judge the Greeks fromn their own point of view: his standards of judgment are always "those of an Anglican graduate of Oxford with a taste for architecture, turned cartoonist, approaching middle age and living in Kensington." That statement explains much. The book should be read by all serious American classical scholars, the more serious the better. It will probably amuse them; it may help to mellow them; if it annoys them, that, too, will be a salutary experience. HERBERT N. CoucH BROWVN UNIVERSITY</page></plain_text>
