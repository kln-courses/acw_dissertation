It is also surprising that no detailed comparison is undertaken with the law of the king in Deut. xvii 14-20. Moreover, the English style of the author is often bizarre (e.g. "enfleshed", p. 43; "vehiculed", p. 45; the use of "adumbrating" with the apparent meaning of "damaging", p. 49; "capsuliz- ed", p. 203). Nevertheless, she has succeeded in drawing attention to an im- portant passage in the DtrH and in suggesting a fresh appreciation of its literary function in the composition as a whole. [H. G. M. WILLIAMSON] M. L. KLEIN, Anthropomorphisms and Anthropopathisms in the Targumim of the Pentateuch, with Parallel Citations from the Septuagint. xxvi (English) + 176 (Hebrew) pp. Makor Publishing Ltd, Jerusalem, 1982. It is frequently stated as a generalization that the Targumim avoid or tone down anthropomorphisms. In his doctoral dissertation, presented in 1978 to the Hebrew University and here published with the provision of an index of references and an up-to-date bibliography, Klein examines the origins and moder expressions of this view before subjecting it to analysis and common-sense criticism. It is shown that the Targumim are in no way consistent in their translations, and that more often than not we must reckon with general translation equivalents rather than specifically anti-anthropomorphic renderings. Amongst other relevant topics covered we should note here, in view of various recent publications, the salutary remarks about the inconsistent use of memra' in the Targumim. Instead of an English summary, two of Klein's articles in English (SVT 32 [1981], pp. 162-77, andJTS, N.S. 30 [1979], pp. 502-7) are included. Between them, they discuss in brief compass most of the areas covered by the dissertation, but not, we may note, the rendering of anthropomorphic and anthropopathic verbs at- tributed to God, where Klein's generally convincing thesis is most open to criticism. [H. G. M. WILLIAMSON] R. W. KLEIN, 1 Samuel. Word Biblical Commentary 10. xxxiv + 307 pp. Word Books, Waco, Texas, 1983. After a list of abbreviations, a general bibliography, and an introduction of little more than twelve pages, the com- mentary follows the usual pattern of the series, and there are indexes of authors, principal subjects, and biblical references, but unfortunately no maps. Klein is well informed and writes clearly, and the commentary is generally helpful and, among other things, takes textual evidence from Qumran into con- sideration. The reader would sometimes have welcomed more information (e.g. a discussion of the phrase "Yahweh of hosts" in i 3, and the meaning of miptan in v 4-5, and a fuller discussion of "seer" and "prophet" in ix 9 and of the im- plications of the command to "serve other gods" in xxvi 19), and sometimes references are made to philological matters and cognate languages without stating precisely what the relevant information is (pp. 32, 50, 175; cp. p. 232). One wonders whether the author was allowed enough space to meet the needs of exegesis. The commentary is readable, though there are places where the English is in need of polish or even correction (e.g. "decimation" seems to be used as a synonym of "massacre" on pp. 27, 108, and "transpired" as a synonym of "happened" on p. 224; "data... is", p. 35; "Saul was very angry with Michal, as he would be with Jonathan, his other son", p. 198; Jonathan is described as "presumptive heir" of Saul on pp. 199, 210-or is the phrase in- tended to have a different meaning from "heir presumptive"?). Notwithstan- ding such blemishes, the commentary deserves to be widely used. J.A.E.] G. A. F. KNIGHT, Servant Theology. A Commentary on the Book of Isaiah 40-55. International Theological Commentary. x + 204 pp. The Handsel Press, Edinburgh, and Wm B. Eerdmans, Grand Rapids, 1984. $9.95. True to the aims of the series, this commentary presents a theological exposition for the</page><page sequence="2">BOOK LIST 249 Christian Church without the paraphernalia of technical scholarship. However, despite the fact that it is said to be a complete revision and bringing up to date of Knight's 1965 commentary, it is still heavy with the jargon of the Biblical Theology movement and sadly lacking in some of the more recent insights into these chapters gained from form criticism and from considering them not only historically but also in the context of the book of Isaiah as a whole. Knight believes that Deutero-Isaiah "has penned a sustained theological treatise in verse" (p. 18), and he therefore seeks to trace the prophet's chain of thought from verse to verse with little concern for the book's smaller and larger literary units. O.T. scholars may also be surprised at Knight's confidence in the face of textual difficulties. The aim of the series is bold and laudable, but its execution is perhaps more difficult to achieve satisfactorily than its editors realize. [H. G. M. WILLIAMSON] J. KRASOVEC, Antithetic Structures in Biblical Hebrew Poetry. SVT 35. xiv + 143 pp. E. J. Brill, Leiden, 1984. 52 guilders; for subscribers to VT 44 guilders. Anti- thetic parallelism is a well-known feature of Biblical Hebrew poetry. In this monograph, however, Krasovec examines the wider use of antithesis as a struc- tural element in compositions of greater length than the simple couplet, work- ing with the definition that "the fundamental trait of the antithesis is that two opposing elements exclude each other in relation to a common idea" (p. 5). He groups the material into four categories: epic literature (i.e. Judg. v); "Psalmic" literature (principally Ps. lxxiii, though fourteen other psalms are briefly analysed); prophetic literature (e.g. Jer. x 2-16; Ezek. xvii 3b-10); and didactic literature. An appendix lists all units of antithesis in the Hebrew Bible (including antithetical couplets) with the exception of Prov. x-xxix, where the examples are too numerous. Krasovec demonstrates that the appreciation of antithetic structure can be a useful tool in revealing the distinctive characteristics of each passage studied as well as making a contribution to the solution of such problems as literary criticism, textual criticism, and the awareness of a text's unity. His careful study will thus afford considerable aid in the exegesis of the passages which he discusses. [H. G. M. WILLIAMSON] R. KUNTZMANN, Le symbolisme desjumeaux au Proche-Orient ancien. Naissance, fonction et evolution d'un symbole. Beauchesne Religions 12. 264 pp. Beauchesne, Paris, 1983. The introduction surveys relevant previous work on the symbolism of twins and discusses method. Part 1 examines selected examples of the sym- bolism in the ancient Near East: Jacob and Esau; Gilgamesh and Enkidu; Adapa and the gods Dumuzi and Ningizzida, pairs of tutelary deities, the cherubim and related beings; Jacob at Bethel (Gen. xxviii 10-22), Jacob at Mahanaim (xxxii 1-22), and Jacob wrestling with a mysterious being (xxxii 23-33). Part 2 is concerned with the symbolism of twins and astral and gnostic reflection. It begins with shr and slm in the Ugaritic texts, related mythological figures, and pairs of sacred pillars (including Jachin and Boaz), and then discusses gnostic literature about Thomas, the twin, and the Syriac Song of the Pearl. A final chapter sums up the various themes detected in the previous discussions, and their significance. The book ends with a bibliography, and in- dexes of references and subjects. [J.A.E.] D.
