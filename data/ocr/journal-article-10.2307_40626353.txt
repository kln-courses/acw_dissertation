<plain_text><page sequence="1">Realism and the Reaction George J. Becker, Documents of Modern Literary Realism, Princeton. Wylie Sypher, Loss of the Self in Modern Literature and Art, Random House. Charles I. Glicksberg, The Tragic Vision in Twentieth-Century Literature, Southern Illinois University Press. Nathalie Sarraute, The Age of Suspicion, George Braziller. Together, these four books offer a varied, patchy, but useful survey of realism and the reaction against it. George J. Becker's Documents of Modern Literary Realism gives precisely what the title promises, but with an abundance of material and sureness of selection that will make it a standard in its limited area. The documents range from Belinsky's "On Realistic Poetry" (Russian, 1835), which defines "realistic poetry" as "the poetry of our time par excellence," (p. 42) to, Erich Heller's "The Realistic Fallacy" (British, 1955), which attacks realism as a meaningful concept. In between are the obvious choices (Flaubert, 377</page><page sequence="2">PRAIRIE SCHOONER Sainte-Beuve, Taine, George Eliot, the De Goncourts, Garland, Dreiser, Zola, Strindberg, Engels, James, Proust, and Malcolm Cowley) together with a number of lesser known names. All of the major brands of realism, and the chief attacks upon them, are represented. Becker's introduction itself is a significant document in the description of realism. Except for some embarrassing over-generalizations (e.g., with the rise of the realistic novel "immediately artificialities of plot and charac- terization go out the window" [p. 29]), Becker admirably summarizes the history and theory of realism and the technical innovations that have accompanied it. The remaining three studies assume the death of the scientific posi- tivism that made realism seem feasible. Loss of the Self in Modern Litera- ture and Art, by Wylie Sypher, attributes the themes and forms of modern painting and literature to the world view imposed by post-positivistic thought. Unfortunately, Sypher limits his study of art to the avant-garde and profoundly misreads contemporary science. First, let's grant the major premise in his interpretation of recent science: What had previously been considered as laws reflecting the basic structure of reality (laws of cause and effect, space-time relations, the immediacy and validity of sensory experience, etc.) are now recognized as constructs dependent more upon the physiological and psychological characteristics of man than upon exter- ior reality. Self becomes a fact in the sense that each individual is isolated, cut off from nature by the screen which the mind places between man and thing and cut off from fellow men because they no longer share a common meeting ground. Earlier notions of self, Sypher continues, were illusory because they were based upon a hypostatization of purely conceptual relations. The plague-causing guilt of Oedipus and the storm-bringing rage of Byron are now seen as a fallacious humanizing of objective reality. To avoid the anthropomorphic fallacy, writers have created the character- less anti-hero and painters have developed techniques designed to eliminate self in the representation of objects; roughly stated, Sypher is arguing that since science has abandoned the possibility of objectivity, the arts must recapture it. So much for Sypher 's thesis. Now for his misreading of recent scientific thought. He assumes that, because we now recognize the operational primacy of pattern of thought over content thought about, and because we now see such patterns as fictions, we must therefore accept a world of intellectual and emotional vacuity, a world of things and persons in isolation. Thus Jean Dubuffet, with his attempts to portray a reality undistorted by his personality, and Mme. Sarraute, with her "twenty-four cinematic glimpses of banal situations in everyday Paris" and characters who "are simply their reactions to the conditions they meet" (p. 88). But the whole lesson of modern science, and especially of those scientists Sypher refers to- Whitehead, Heisenberg, and others- is precisely that the human factor 378</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW cannot be purged from experience. Hence Dubuffet and Mme. Sarraute attempt the impossible. The current scientific method, as I understand it, is not to eliminate the conceptual screens between knowledge and reality, but to recognize their inevitability and to exploit them. Another way of making much the same point is to note that human thought and feeling are part of the data of reality and that the artist who ignores them falsifies. Perhaps Sypher's should have begun with his final sentences: "Camus works his own variation on a theme once set by André Malraux, who in Le Temps du Mépris said: 'It is hard to be a man.' Camus answers that it is impossible not to be a man." Had Sypher accepted Camus' answer he would have produced a work of criticism more true to contemporary scien- tific thought and more knowing in the ways of art. Charles I. Glicksberg's The Tragic Vision in Twentieth-Century Litera- ture is concerned with what it means to be a man in an age dominated by the myth of nothingness. It means, first of all, protest: "because life is absurd and death an intolerable outrage, the modern writer raises his voice in frenzied denunciation that is balanced and kept under control by the art of irony" (p. 152). Secondly, it means the writer's commitment to "the humanistic ideal," for "having cast off all other-worldly illusions, he is ready to affirm what man alone can affirm: there is only this life, here and now" (p. 155). Although too hurried, Glicksberg does a commendable job of tracing these propositions through Kierkegaard, Kafka, Camus, Malraux, Sartre, O'Neill, and others; he is especially good at showing subtle ideological differences between such closely related writers as Sartre and Camus. Unfortunately, the subtlety does not extend to his own system building. For example, I cannot quite see, although Glicksberg takes great pains to explain himself, how tragedy can be both "frenzied denunciation" and "the imaginative record of the attempt, usually despairing but never aban- doned, to discern some pattern of justice in the way of fate" (p. xv). The difficulty is largely semantic, involving two conceptions of tragedy- tragedy as the record of man's protest against his helpless suffering and tragedy as the justification of an impersonal order (social, religious, moral, etc.) upon the individual. To subordinate one to the other is to miss the distinc- tive qualities of either modern or classical tragedy. Glicksberg chooses to subordinate the classical to the modern tragedy of "frenzied denunciation." The Age of Suspicion, by Nathalie Sarraute, is an impassioned plea for the "mote in the middle distance," the shimmer of truth between objective portrayal of surface reality and psychological probing. The surface novel (which she variously calls the behaviorist novel, the novel of situation, or the formalist novel) fails because somehow readers are interested in more than surface, because surface-as-surface is so easily done that it forces neither writer nor reader to extend beyond himself into the truth of things. The psychological novel is no longer adequate because, "having learned the 379</page><page sequence="4">PRAIRIE SCHOONER lesson of successive disappointments, everybody knew that there was no ultimate deep" (p. 12). When, with Dostoievsky or Joyce, we do explore the depths of a mind we find not the depth, but simply a depth, another sur- face. Both kinds of novel, Mme. Sarraute feels, have become so convention ridden that they can provoke only conventional responses. A new technique, then, is needed- presumably the kind of technique Mme. Sarraute has been working towards in her fiction. It is a technique equally difficult for reader and writer: difficult for the latter because he knows that the reader no longer trusts the author's imagination and that he must therefore earn his claim to "reality"; and difficult for the former because the writer earns his claim by forcing the reader to work "exactly where the author is, at a depth where nothing remains of the convenient landmarks with which he constructs the characters" (p. 71). Perhaps the most remarkable thing about The Age of Suspicion (other than the short but provocative analyses of a number of novels) is Mme. Sarraute's ability to argue forcefully for her kind of novel while acknowl- edging hopefully that it may be transcended. Lee T. Lemon</page></plain_text>
