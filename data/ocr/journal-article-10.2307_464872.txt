The widening interest in narrativity studies in recent years parallels the emergence of a general semiotics whose aspirations are becoming increasingly specific. At an early stage, the comparison of the results of research undertaken independently-by V. Propp on folklore [Morphology of the Folktale, tr. C. Scott (Bloomington: Linguistics Center, 1958)], by Claude L6vi-Strauss [Structural An- thropology, tr. C. Jacobson) New York: Basic Books, 1963)] on the structure of myth, by Etienne Souriau [Les Deux cent mille situations dramatiques (Paris: Flammarion, 1950)] on the theatre-made it possible to establish the existence of an autonomous area of inquiry. Later, new methodological investigations, such as that of Claude Bremond interpreting narration from the perspective of decisional logic [Logique du rdcit (Paris: Seuil, 1973)], or that of Alan Dundes seeking to describe the organization of narrative in the form of a narrative grammar [The Morphology of North American Indian Folktales (Helsinki: Suomalainen Tiedenkatemia, 1964)], contributed to a di- versification of the theoretical approaches. Our own concern, during this period, was both to extend as far as possible the field of application of narrative analysis, and to pursue the formalization of the partial models which had emerged from the ongoing research on narrative [1966a, pp. 192-221]: it seemed important to us to insist first and foremost on the semio-linguistic character of the categories used in the elaboration of these models, so as to ensure their universal applicability and to provide for the integration of narrative structures into a general semiotic theory. 1.2 Narrativity and its manifestation. One consequence of the methodological enrichment of narrative analysis and the possibility of applying it to areas other than folklore or mythology has been to bring to light some important problems, calling back into question the most widely accepted ideas in linguistics. It was first necessary to acknowledge that narrative structures can be identified outside of the manifestations of meaning that occur in the natural languages: in the languages of cinema and of dream, in figurative painting, etc. [cf. Christian, Film Language, tr. M. Taylor (New York: Oxford University Press, 1974); J.-L. Schefer, Scunographie d'un tableau (Paris: Seuil, 1969); and Louis Marin, Etudes scmiologiques (Paris: Klinksieck, 1972)]. But this amounted to recognizing and ac- cepting the necessity of a fundamental distinction between two levels of representa- tion and analysis: an apparent level of narration, at which the manifestations of narration are subject to the specific exigencies of the linguistic substances through which they are expressed, and an immanent level, constituting a sort of common structural trunk, at which narrativity is situated and organized prior to its manifesta- tion. A common semiotic level is thus distinct from the linguistic level and is logically prior to it, whatever the language chosen for the manifestation. * All notes and intra-textual references are provided by the editors.

DIACRITICS/March 1977 23</page><page sequence="2">On the other hand, if narrative structures are anterior to their manifestation, the latter, in order to take place, has to utilize linguistic units whose dimensions are larger than those of the utterance [6nonc6], units which would constitute "a com- prehensive syntagmatics," as Ch. Metz put it in speaking of the semiotics of cinema. Thus, corresponding to narrative structures one finds, at the level of manifestation, linguistic structures of narrative and narrative analysis has discourse analysis as its corollary. 1.3 Narrativity and semiotics. It is thus apparent that, if we acknowledge that significationi is indifferent to the modes of its manifestation [1970 b, p. 13], we are obliged to recognize an autono- mous structural level or region where vast fields of signification are organized. This level will have to be integrated into any general semiotic theory precisely insofar as the latter aims to account for the articulation and the manifestation of the semantic universe as a totality of meaning that is cultural or personal in nature. By the same token, the general economy of such a theory is overturned: previously, for example, one could suppose that linguistic inquiry consisted in setting up a mechanism, com- binatory or generative in character, which would account, on the basis of simple elements and primitive kernels, for the production of an unlimited number of utter- ances, and that, in turn, the transformation and combination of these utterances would produce the strings of utterances constituting discourse. Now, on the con- trary, we have to imagine instances2 ab quo of the generation of signification such that, starting with minimally articulated agglomerations of meaning we may obtain, as we move down from level to level, meaning-bearing articulations that are more and more refined, in order to achieve, simultaneously, the two goals that meaning pursues as it becomes manifest: to appear as articulated meaning, i.e., as significa- tion, and as discourse on meaning, i.e., as a vast paraphrase developing in its own way all the prior articulations of meaning. Put another way, the generation of signifi- cation does not pass first through the production of utterances and their combination in discourse; it is relayed, in following its course [parcours], by narrative structures, and these are the structures which produce meaningful discourse articulated in utter- ances. Hence it is apparent that the elaboration of a theory of narrativity which would justify and establish narrative analysis theoretically as a methodologically self- sufficient area of research does not consist simply in the perfecting and formalizing of the narrative models obtained by ever more numerous and varied descriptions, nor in a typology of these models which would subsume them all, but also, and especially, it consists in the positioning of narrative structures as an autonomous instance within the general economy of semiotics, conceived as the science of sig- nification. 1.4 The instances of a general semiotics. For this to be done, semiotic theory must be conceived in such a way as to ensure that between the fundamental instances ab quo, in which semantic substance receives its first articulations and constitutes itself in signifying form, and the ulti- mate [surface] instances ad quem, in which signification is manifested through mul- tiple languages, a broad space is reserved for the installation of an instance of mediation in which semiotic structures possessing an autonomous status would be ' "Signification is then only this transposition from one language-level to another, of one language into a different language, and meaning [sens] is simply this possibility of transcoding" [1970b, p. 13]. 2 Instance. The use of instance in contemporary French to convey at once a moment of occurrence or intervention and a state or status of insistency is increasingly widespread. Rather than translate it variously by terms such as level, moment, modality, import, etc., according to the context, we have decided to use systematically the English cognate, instance (from the Latin instantia, a standing upon or near, being present). Cf. J. Lacan, "L'Instance de la lettre dans i'inconscient" in Ecrits [Paris: Seuil, 1965]. 24 DIACRITICS/March 1977</page><page sequence="3">found. Among these semiotic structures the narrative structures would be construed as areas for the elaboration of complementary articulations of contents and a sort of grammar, at once general and fundamental, presiding over the establishment of articulated discourse. The structural project relative to this instance of mediation is thus two-fold: on the one hand, it is a question of sketching the construction of models for content articulation, as these can be imagined at this level of the course of meaning; on the other hand, it is a question of setting up the formal models which may be capable of manipulating these contents and arranging them in such a way that they can govern the production and the segmentation of discourse, can or- ganize, under certain conditions, the manifestation of narrativity. In other words, semiotic theory will be satisfying only if it succeeds in staking out at its core a place for a fundamental semantics and a fundamental grammar. 1.5 Toward a fundamental semantics. The project of a fundamental semantics, different from the semantics of linguis- tic manifestation, can only be based upon theory of meaning. This project is thus directly linked to the explicitation of the conditions in which meaning can be grasped and to the elementary structure of signification which may be deduced from it, and which will be presented thereafter as an axiomatics. This elementary struc- ture, previously analyzed and described [1968], must be conceived as the logical development of a binary semic category, of the type white vs. black; the relation of the terms of this category is that of mutual contraries, each one being at the same time capable of projecting a new term which would be its contradictory; the con- tradictory terms capable in turn of entering into a relationship of presupposition with respect to the opposed contrary terms:3 (--* marks presupposition; *--marks contradiction) The subsequent assumption is that this elementary structure of signification furnishes a semiotic model adequate to account for initial articulations of meaning within a semantic micro-universe. A clarification is necessary here regarding our conception of the semantic uni- verse. At a first stage [cf. 1966, pp. 25-27, 102-16], we had proposed to consider it as the totality of the "semantic substance" that can only signify through the net of articulations by which it is covered, meaning being grasped only if it is articulated. These articulations of meaning could be explained, we thought, as the result of a combinatorial operation carried out on the basis of a limited inventory of semic categories. One further step could be taken today, suggesting a somewhat more refined representation of this net of articulations. For we can imagine that each of the constitutive categories of the combinatorial (which, as we have seen, can be rendered at any moment as an elementary structure) may be transformed into a constitutive semiotic model, and, subordinating to itself other categories from the same inventory that serve as its sub-articulations, may thus subsume a vast field of signification, may serve as a covering for a semantic micro-universe. Therefore the fundamental inventory of semic categories necessary for the articulation of the semantic universe in its totality is at the same time the virtual inventory of all possible micro-universes, since each culture, each personality can favor, through privileged articulations, one particular micro-universe [cf. 1966, pp. 126-27] at the expense of another (the culture of wine in France, the exploitation of spring water in Turkey). Hence the constitutive model is none other than the elementary structure of signification used, as a form, for the articulation of the semantic substance of a micro- 3 This semiotic square is not exactly the same as that of 1968. The shift is discussed in F. Nef, ed., Structures 616mentaires de la signification [Bruxelles: Editions Complexe, 1976]. DIACRITICS/March 1977 25</page><page sequence="4">universe. We might say that the isotopy4 of the terms of the elementary structure grounds and secures the micro-universe as a unit of meaning, and makes it possible to consider, within our elaboration of axioms, the constitutive model as a canonical form, as an inaugural instance for a fundamental semantics. To examine the conditions of such a semantics would take us beyond the scope of this proposal. We are concerned here simply with distinguishing clearly the two levels-semantic and grammatical--of the exploration we are undertaking. Thus it would perhaps be preferable to mark this distinction with a terminological division, by speaking of content values each time we are dealing with semic units isolated within a micro-universe by means of the articulations of the constitutional model, and reserving the expression "structural term" for the formal units of the semiotic mod- el. 1.6 Toward a fundamental grammar. But if the elementary structure serves thus as a model for the structuring of the contents (i.e., the semantic substances), if it is capable of enabling meaning to signify, it remains nonetheless a semiotic form which may be considered apart from any investment. This structure is the "semiotic principle" which, according to Hjelmslev [Prolegomena to a Theory of Language, trans. F. J. Whitfield (Madison: Univ. of Wisconsin Press, 1961)], institutes and organizes all language, in the most general sense. This explains why, even though as a constitutive model it lies at the basis of the organization of contents, the elementary structure is at the same time the formal model which, owing to its constitutive categories, manipulates the contents organized without being identified with them. We have already noted, moreover, that the categories necessary to the formalization of the elementary structure of signification are the same epistemological categories used for the construction of any semiotic theory. It is with these "universals of language," established as a semio- tic model, as a primitive instance of any manipulation of meaning, that we may envisage the elaboration of the first premises of a fundamental grammar. 2. ELEMENTS OF A FUNDAMENTAL GRAMMAR 2.1 The taxonomic core It is difficult, at the present time, to elaborate an axiomatics on which narrative structures would be based: a complete semiotic theory would be a prerequisite. Thus one can do no more than sketch in, by referring to the global conception of such a semiotics, the principal articulatory instances and the predictable operational sequences of a projected narrative grammar. All grammars include, more or less explicitly, two components, a morphology and a syntax. The nature of the morphology is that of a taxonomy whose terms are interdefined, the syntax consists in a set of operational rules or else in means of manipulating the terms of the morphology. To illustrate what a taxonomic model of this type might be, we may refer to the structural analysis of the Oedipal myth carried out as early as 1955 by Claude L6vi- Strauss [in Structural Anthropology; cf. Greimas, 1956, 1965, 1966], an analysis which resulted in the construction of a simple achronic model on the basis of which, according to the author, all the Oedipal myths, including Freud's, can be generated. This model, the result of a paradigmatic reading of the mythic discourse, can be defined-we have examined it elsewhere-as the establishment of a correlation of coupled contradictory terms. It is easy to see that such a model is in every respect comparable to the constitu- tional model to which we have already referred, and that it may be interpreted by application of the same relational categories. Thus by calling a schema the structure 4 On the notion of isotopy (cf. hereafter 3.2.2), see Greimas, 1966, pp. 69-72; F. Rastier, "Vers une systdmatique des isotopies," in Greimas, 1972; and Rastier, Essais de s~miotique discursive [Paris: Mame, 1973]. The reader can compare this abstract notion with her/his intuitive experience of a level of reading. 26 DIACRITICS/March 1977</page><page sequence="5">which includes two terms joined by the relations of contradiction (st-, or s +- s2) and by calling a correlation the relation between two schemas whose terms, taken one by one, are in the relation of contrariety with the corresponding terms of the other schema (cf. 1.5), we can say that the taxonomic model is a structure with four terms which are mutually interdefined by a network of precise relations describable as the correlation between two schemas. For L6vi-Strauss, as we have seen, such a model accounts for the achronic apprehension of the signification of all the possible narratives belonging to a certain semantic micro-universe. It is a formal model: it does no more than articulate the invested content. Moreover, it is independent of its mode of manifestion: the dis- course which manifests it may be a mythic narrative, but it may also be the didactic discourse of Freud; it can just as well be present, in a diffuse form, in interminable anthropological or psychoanalytical discourses. In other words, it is on the basis of this first taxonomic instance that value- systems, or axiologies, and the recurrent processes of value-creation, or ideologies, can be articulated and manifested in a static mode. Even though it is capable of generating non-narrative discursive forms, the taxonomic instance is just as much a necessary base for any dynamic process generative of narrative syntax. 2.2 The narrativization of the taxonomy It is evident that the taxonomic model, owing to the stability of the relations which define its structural terms, may be taken as the initial nucleus of an elementary morphology. However, examining the conditions of the apprehension of meaning, we see clearly that if signification, to the extent that one attempts to find it in the object, appears as an articulation of fundamental stable relations, it is at the same time capable of a dynamic representation as soon as it is considered either as an apprehension or as a production of meaning by the subject. Taking this dynamic aspect into account, one can establish a network of equivalences between the fun- damental relations constitutive of the taxonomic model, and the projections of these same relations, or operations, bearing this time on already-established terms of this elementary morphology. The regulation of these operations would constitute syntax. Thus contradicition, inasmuch as it is a relation, serves, at the taxonomic level, for the establishment of binary schemas: inasmuch as it is an operation of contradiction, it will consist, at the syntactic level, in negating one of the terms of the schema and in affirming at the same time its contradictory term. Such an operation, when it is carried out on terms already invested with value, results in the transformation of contents by negating those which have been posited and by replacing them with new contents which are asserted. Consequently, we can place the first cornerstone, a provisional one, of a fun- damental syntax by saying that it consists in setting the taxonomic model into motion through transformations of contents invested in the taxonomic terms on which that fundamental syntax operates. Note: We have seen that the apprehension of myth called achronic is an unsta- ble instance, that its "dogmatic" structure is at every moment ready to develop into narrative. The studies carried out on certain minor genres (proverbs, wellerisms, headlines of news items, etc.) which seem at first glance to be pure axiological manifestations how on the contrary their thoroughgoing instability and a pro- nounced tendency toward narrativization. 2.3 The orientation of the syntactic operations The representation of syntax as a sequence of operations carried out on the defined terms of a taxonomic structure makes it possible to infer from them more easily a new property: the syntactic operations are oriented. Thus in the framework of a single taxonomic schema one can foresee two possi- ble syntactic operations, and two possible transformations of content: either s, : s, Or s1 = s1 DIACRITICS/March 1977 27</page><page sequence="6">Furthermore, since the taxonomic model is made up of two schemas, the ques- tion of the logical priority of the syntactic operations cannot fail to arise. The oriented operations may begin either with the first schema: s,= s, or-,- = si, or with the second schema: s2,- s2, or s2=&gt; s2; this already gives rise, as is apparent, to a first combinatorial of syntactic operations. Finally, knowledge of the relational properties of the elementary structure- which are at the same time those of the syntactic operations-prescribes the follow- ing: the operation of contradiction which, in negating for example the term s,, poses 1:: -::::: :'. / /: '--:: ::::: ::::. ? 7 /:$ /::::-:i:-l:,,:-:i-: :i:i--.. -::i:-:-i:_:l: ----: ,--':?-':: -:'--l-': " 7 / /1- --~1- -i-'-::;_1': l~_- 1 .:: ::: :-: .:::;iii?: ii: -/ / &lt;'7/7iXi ' / : at the same time the term , and must be followed by a new operation of presuppo- sition giving rise to the new term, s2, which is conjoined to--. Thus the syntactic operations are not only oriented, but are also organized in logical series. 2.4 The characteristics of a fundamental grammar. The characteristics which we have just specified and which can serve as a basis for the elaboration of a fundamental grammar can be summarized as follows: 1. Narrative grammar is composed of an elementary morphology, furnished by the taxonomic model, and of a fundamental syntax which operates on the taxonomic terms interdefined at the outset. 2. Narrative syntax consists in operations carried out upon the terms subject to being invested with content values; owing to this fact it transforms them and ma- nipulates them, by negating them and affirming them, or-what amounts to the same thing-by disjoining and conjoining them. 3. The syntactic operations, situated in the established taxonomic framework, are oriented, and therefore predictable and calculable. 4. The operations, moreover, are ordered in series and constitute processes which can be segmented into operational syntactic units. These minimal determinations, conditions of a fundamental grammar, even though incomplete, allow us to approach the problems relating to the construction of a surface narrative grammar. 3. ELEMENTS OF A SURFACE NARRATIVE GRAMMAR 3.1 The problem of levels of grammar. If we possessed a fundamental grammar it would be possible to imagine "lower" levels of grammar which, by making more specific the categories used or by tran- 28 DIACRITICS/March 1977</page><page sequence="7">scribing them in a more complex manner, would progressively move closer to gram- mar as it is manifested for example in the natural languages. Thus, by simplifying considerably, we may say that the fundamental grammar, which is concepetual in nature, must first receive, at an intermediate semiotic level, an anthropomorphic but non-tigurative representation, in order to be able to produce narratives man- ifested in a figurative form (where human or personified actors would accomplish tasks, undergo trials, reach goals). It is this anthropomorphic level which we shall designate by the term surface narrative grammar, specifying that the adjective "sur- face," with no pejorative connotations, indicates only that we are dealing with a semiotic level whose definitions and grammatical rules are capable, with the help of a final transcoding, of passing directly into discourse and into linguistic utterances. The term grammatical level needs to be defined first. If we say that a grammar can be constructed at two different levels, that means that it is possible to construct two different meta-languages accounting for one and the same linguistic phenom- enon present at a third level, in our case that of manifestation. We shall say likewise that these two metalanguages are equivalent, because they are isotopic but not isomorphic, indicating thereby that a determined segment of one metalanguage can be transcoded into an isotopic segment of another, even though the constitutive elements of the two languages are not by this token formally identical. The constitutive categories of such a surface grammar are distinguished, as we were saying, by their anthropomorphic character, from the logical character proper to the categories of the fundamental grammar. 3.2 Narrative utterances 3.2.1 The anthropomorphic practice If, in consequence, one of the basic concepts of the fundamental grammar is that of the syntactic operation, it will correspond, on the surface level, to syntactic practice. The establishment of equivalence between operation and practice [/e faire] is in fact what brings the anthropomorphic dimension into grammar. This fact can be interpreted in different ways: a) Whereas a logical operation is conceived as an autonomous metalinguistic process, allowing the subject of the operation to be bracketed (or allowing the use of any operator whatsoever), a practice, whether practical or mythical, implies as an activity-a human subject (or at least an anthropomorphosized one: "the pencil writes"). In other words, the practice is an operation defined by the adjunction of the classeme "human." b) When we speak of the practice, it is evident that we are not thinking of the "real" practice situated at the level of the semiotics of the natural world, but of the linguistic practice (whatever the language, natural or not, in which it is manifested), a practice transcoded as message. Whether it is a question, with respect to the semio- tic system that serves as the frame of reference, of an enacted practice or of a spoken practice, its status as meta-semiotic practice (because it is described) makes it a message-object, situated within the process of communication, implying an address- er and an addressee. The practice is thus a doubly anthropomorphic operation: as activity, it presup- poses a subject; as message, it is objectivized and implies the axis of transmission between sender and receiver. 3.2.2 Simple narrative utterances Conversion-the passage from one grammatical level to another--can thus be defined as an equivalence between the operation and the practice, by giving to the implications of the concept of practice the form of a simple narrative utterance (NU): NU = F (A) in which the practice, as a process of actualization, is labeled function (F) and in which the subject of the practice, as a potentiality of the process, is designated actant (A). DIACRITICS/March 1977 29</page><page sequence="8">Thus we shall say that any operation of the fundamental grammar can be converted into a narrative utterance whose minimal canonic form is F(A). It is still understood that narrative utterances are syntactic utterances, that is, independent of the content which may be invested in any given practice, and that the constitutive elements of the utterance F and A, are isotopes: any semantic restriction of F will necessarily have repercussions on A, and vice versa. The actant is, to give one example, an isotope of its function, in the same way that the name of the agent is of its verb (cf. hunter- hunt). 3.2.3 Modal utterances and descriptive utterances Thus a typology of narrative utterances-and, at the same time, of actants-can be constructed through the progressive introduction of determined semantic restric- tions. If, for example, we find that a certain class of functions is defined by the adjunction of the classeme "want" [vouloir]5, the actants, isotopes of these func- tions, will constitute a restrictive class which can be designated as that of subject- actants. In fact, wanting is an anthropomorphic (but not necessarily figurative: cf. "this rule requires that. . .") classeme which institutes the actant as subject, i.e., as possi- ble operator of the practice [faire]. And on this basis one can constitute, alongside the descriptive utterances (DU) a new type of narrative utterance: the modal utter- ances (MU). In fact, from the linguistic point of view, to want is a modal predicate which governs properly descriptive utterances. For example: (1) John wants Peter to leave. (2) Peter wants to leave. Once transcribed as semantic utterances, these linguistic utterances appear as fol- lows: (1) F: want/S: John; O (F: departure; A: Peter)/ (2) F: want/S: Peter; O (F: departure; A: Peter)/ It is clear that, linguistically, the introduction of the classeme "want" is something other than an overdetermination of the predicate, that it necessitates the construc- tion of two distinct utterances of which the first is modal and the second descriptive; the latter, hypotaxic with respect to the former, serves as its Object-Actant. If for the moment we do not take into account the fact that, in the first example, the semantic subjects of the two utterances are different and in the second case identical, we can interpret the modal utterance as "the desire to realize" a program which is present in the form of a descriptive utterance and is at the same time, given its status as object, part of the modal utterance. This allows us already to provide a formal description of modal utterances, as follows: MU = F: desire/S; 0/ These are enunciations of virtual programs made explicit in the framework of object-actants, it being understood that the object-actant of the modal utterance may can at all times be converted into any descriptive utterance whatsoever. If we now introduce a supplementary restriction, postulating that the semantic subject of the descriptive utterance must be the same as that of the modal utterance, we can say, after a fashion, that the syntactic practice consists in the transformation of a virtual program into an actualized one. s English provides no adequate equivalent for this use of vouloir (wanting in the sense of volition), which is a verb (infinitive) used as a substantive. The same remark will apply to le faire (the doing) hereafter; contextual considerations have led us to translate le faire by the noun practice. 30 DIACRITICS/March 1977</page><page sequence="9">As the descriptive utterance conceived as a program remains unchanged, the transformation can be interpreted as the substitution, for the modal utterance with the function "want," of a modal utterance of existence which is recognized as an implicit presupposition of every descriptive utterance. 3.2.4 Attributive utterances Our statement that the Object of desire, presented as Object-Actant, is in reality a program-utterance, requires some further attention. Other examples will allow us to introduce new characteristics of these descriptive utterances: (3) Peter wants an apple (4) Peter wants to be good These linguistic utterances may be represented semantically as [O = object]: (3) F: want/S: Peter; O (F: acquisition; A: Peter; 0: apple)/ (4) F: want/S: Peter; O (F: acquisition; A: Peter; 0: goodness)/ The semantic explicitation, as we can see, allows us to establish, alongside of already-mentioned utterances whose function belongs to the order of practice, the existence of two other types of descriptive utterances characterized by their func- tions, which are at times of the order of having, at other times of the order of being. As a subclass of descriptive utterances they can be designated as attributive utter- ances (AU). What differentiates these two types of utterances, at the level of seman- tic description, is less the specification of their functions-we are dealing in both cases with a relation of attribution between the subject and the semantic object- than the specification of the external or internal nature of attributable objects. To the extent that by bringing together in order to interpret them the functions of the two utterances, modal and descriptive, we can say that the desire for possession insti- tutes the object of a virtual possession as a value, we can see that apple is an external value with respect to the subject of the desire, while goodness is a value internal to the subject. We can state this difference in syntactic terms by saying that the rela- tion between subject and object of the attributive utterance is, in the first case, hypotaxic and, in the second, hyponomic [cf. 1966, pp. 28-29]. Let us then offer the following points in summary: a) The introduction into the surface grammar of the modality of wanting permits the construction of modal utterances with two actants: the subject and the object. The axis of desire which unites them permits us, in turn, to interpret them semanti- cally as a virtual performing subject and as an object instituted as value. b) If the modality of wanting valorizes the object, this object, as an actant of the modal utterance, may be converted either into an utterance descriptive of practice (examples 1 and 2)-and practice as such is found to be valorized-or into attributive utterances (examples 3 and 4)-and the actualization of wanting is then expressed through the possession of object-values indicated in the attributive utterances. c) The distinction of two types of attribution of object-values (hypotaxic and hyponomic) must be maintained: it offers a formal criterion for distinguishing two orders of value (objective and subjective) of capital importance for the understanding of narrative structure. 3.2.5 Modal utterances as functions of attributive utterances We have yet to complete our list of examples of narrative utterances with the following: (5) Peter wants to know [something] (6) Peter wants to be able [to do something] It is immediately apparent, without a semantic transcription, that the distinguish- ing feature of this type of utterance lies in the fact that a modal utterance can have as DIACRITICS/March 1977 31</page><page sequence="10">its object not a simple descriptive utterance, but another modal utterance, function- ing as a descriptive utterance, and thereby subject to being valorized in turn. A certain number of remarks are pertinent in this regard: 1. Our present knowledge of these matters would suggest [cf. 1976d] that only the modalities of knowing [savoir] and of being able [pouvoir] must be taken into consideration in the construction of the superficial grammar. 2. From among the properties of these modalities we shall retain: a) the possibility of forming modal canonical utterances: MU (kn or ab) = F: to know or to be able/S; O(F: to do; O)/ b) the possibility of being objects of modal utterances of wanting: MU (w) = F: to want/S; O (F: to know or to be able; A; O)/ c) the possibility of being objects of attributive utterances AU = F: attribution/S; O: a knowledge or an ability/ 3.3. Narrative units. 3.3.1. Performance and its polemical nature In order to complete the positing of the elementary units of the surface grammar equivalent to those of the fundamental grammar and to pass on to the construction of larger units, we must insist on the polemical representation which the relation of contradiction receives at this surface level. The axis of contradiction which we have designated as schema is known to be the locus of negation and assertion of con- tradictory terms.6 If we admit that the anthropomorphic representation of contradic- tion is polemical in nature, the syntagmatic string-which corresponds to the trans- formation of content values resulting, at the level of the fundamental grammar, from the operations of negation and assertion-will have to appear here as a string of narrative utterances whose semantic restrictions will assume the function of confer- ring upon it a character of confrontation and struggle. Constitution of this syntagma- tic string requires us to postulate: a) the existence of two subjects S, and S2 (or that of a Subject and an Anti- Subject) which correspond to the two contradictory practices, the relation of con- tradiction being recognized as a non-oriented one; b) the semantic restriction of the syntactic practice through the establishment of equivalence between the operation of negation and the function of domination, result of the polemical antagonism; c) the recognition of the principle of orientation valid for the two levels of grammar: to a given orientation of logical operations corresponds a given arbitrary choice of the negating subject and of the domination of one of the subjects over the other. d) the admission that the dialectical procedure according to which the negation of a term is at the same time the assertion of the contradictory term is represented, at the level of the surface syntax, by two independent narrative utterances: the first, with its function of domination, corresponds to the instance of negation, and the second, with the function of attribution, to the instance of assertion. 6 Concerning the terms "schema," "deixis," and "axis," cf. 1968: S (prescribed) ss(------------- s (forbidden) A i (non-forbidden) sS2I_____ (non-prescribed) S Here S and S are the axis; s, + s, and s2 + s2 are the schemas; s + s2 and s2 + s, are the deixis. [cf. 1970, p. 140]. 32 DIACRITICS/March 1977</page><page sequence="11">The syntagmatic string known as performance can be represented as follows: NU1 = F: confrontation (S1&lt;-S2) Note: this narrative utterance expressing anthropomorphically the relation of contradiction between two terms is in reality the syncretism of two modal utterances belonging to each of the subjects. NU2 = F: domination (S4--S2,) Note: The utterance corresponds to the triggering of the operation of oriented negation, in which S, negates S, or vice versa; negation, as we have seen, consists in the transformation of the virtual to the actualized or, what amounts to the same thing, in the substitution of the MU of existence for the MU of wanting, of domina- tion for the desire to dominate. NU3 = F: attribution (S,--O) Note: The latter utterance corresponds to the instance of assertion: this is ex- pressed anthropomorphically by the attribution of an Object-value. 3.3.2. The constitutive elements of performance. In this sketch of surface grammar we have placed the emphasis-by taking, as an example, a single syntagm--on the establishment of term-for-term correspondences between the two grammatical levels, on the bringing to light as well of the an- thropomorphic categories which substitute for the logical terms and operations. The result is the construction of a particular narrative unit, that of performance; owing to the fact that it constitutes the operatory schema of the transformation of content, it is probably the most characteristic unit of narrative syntax. Performance thus defined is a syntactic unit, a formal schema apt to receive the most varied contents. From another standpoint, the two subjects of the performance are interchangeable, each able to dominate or be dominated; likewise, the class of objects is subject to variation according to the distinct modes of syntactic attribution. From the viewpoint of its syntactic status, performance has the form of a series of narrative utterances constructed according to the canonical formula: the narrative utterance is a relation among actants. This relation, designated a function, is capable of receiving certain semantic specifications which are transmitted, owing to the isotopy of the whole, to the actants and which go so far as to determine their number. If the functions and the actants are the constitutive elements of this narrative grammar, if the narrative utterances are its basic syntactic forms, the narrative units-an example of which is represented here by performance-are syntagmatic strings of narrative utterances. 3.3.3 The constitutive relations of performance. The problem of the relations between utterances which are constituted as narra- tive units does not fail to arise here. We have seen that performance, taken as a narrative unit, corresponds to the taxonomic schema and that, because of this, the utterances which constitute it are equivalent to the logical operations situated inside the schema. We have also seen that the logical operations constitutive of the schema were oriented. Now it must be remarked that to this orientation, which is a rule of basic gram- mar, corresponds the relation of implication on the level of superficial grammar, with the difference however that if orientation follows the order of utterances, NU1-N U2-NU3 7 The problem of the number of actants is discussed in 1966, pp. 172-89, and also in Rend Thornm, Stabilit&amp; structurelle et morphogdnese [Paris: Benjamin, 1972]. DIACRITICS/March 1977 33</page><page sequence="12">implication, for its part, is oriented in the other direction: NU3 ] NU2 ] NU1. This conversion, which allows us to define the narrative unit as a sequence of implications among utterances, has a certain practical importance when narrative analysis is undertaken at the level of manifestation, where it grounds the rules for ellipsis and catalysis: the narrative utterances logically implied in the framework of a performance may be elliptical in the manifestation; the presence of the last link in the chain of implications (NU3) suffices for us to proceed, working toward a recon- struction of the narrative unit, to a catalysis which reestablishes it in its integrity. 3.3.4. The modalization of performances. A step backward and a reflection on the properties of modal utterances will permit us to establish the distinction between two possible types of performances. Let us recall that the modal utterances having "want" as their function institute the subject as a virtuality of the practice, while two other modal utterances, characterized by the modalities of knowledge and ability, determine this potential practice in two different ways: as a practice derived from knowledge, or as one based solely upon ability. These two different modalizations of practice can then be recognized in perfor- mances. Thus we shall distinguish performances modalized by knowledge of how to do [something] [/e savoir-faire] (Pkdn)-in which the performing subject will act, at the level of manifestation, through ruse and deceit-from performances carried out by dint of ability to do [something] [/e pouvoir-faire] (Pab)-in which the performing subject uses only its energy and its force, real or magical. 3.4 Performancial strings. 3.4.1. A syntax of communication. Up to now we have considered the terminal narrative utterances of performance (NU)--which is the equivalent, on the superficial level, of the logical assertion in the fundamental grammar-to be an attributive utterance (AU). We may ask however whether such a formulation is satisfactory. Such an attribution-or the acquisition, by the subject, of the object-seems to present itself as a reflexive practice: the performing subject attributes itself to itself, considering itself as subject of the descriptive utterance, an object-value. If this is the case, the reflexive attribution is only a particular case of a much more general structure of attribution, well-known in linguistics as the schema of communciation or, still more generally, as the structure of exchange: it is represented, in its canoni- cal form, as an utterance with three actants: the addresser the addressee, and the object of communication: TU = F: transfer (A , - O - A,) The possibility of using a very general schema is an initial advantage of this formulation. The latter allows us, furthermore, to distinguish clearly between two different syntactic levels: a) the level at which is situated the syntactic operator of the assertion, translated in surface grammar as the subject performing the attribution (in reality it is a meta-subject and the cause of the transfers which are accomplished) and b) the level at which the transfers themselves occur. The terms addresser and addressee merely camouflage the distinction. The second level-which is descriptive and not operational--can now receive an anthropomorphosized topological representation: the actants are no longer con- ceived as operators but as loci where the object-values may be situated, places to which they may be brought and from which they may be removed. The transfer is, in this case, capable of being interpreted at one and the same time as a deprivation (at the surface level) or as a disjunction (at the fundamental level) and as an attribution (at the surface level) or as a conjunction (at the fundamental level). 34 DIACRITICS/March 1977</page><page sequence="13">e.-M a e T, ?4- "0" . ... ... . ? J, ZJ.4 ?W 11 Ile, vl_ 17 W? ".0 V s; .1k As _ek'- Such an interpretation, which replaces the attributive utterances by the transla- tive utterances (TU), appears to provide a more correct representation of perfor- mance: the consequence of the latter (NU3) is no longer a simple acquisition of value, it is a transfer of value: if the object-value is attributed to the dominant subject, this is because the dominated subject is at the same time deprived of this object value; the two logical operations are thus summed up in a single utterance. 3.4.2 The topological syntax of objective values. Such a topological representation of the circulation of object-values [cf. 1976a] amounts to identifying the deixes of the transfers to the terms of the taxonomic model, considered as morphological units capable of being invested with content. We have already seen that investments of content values were distributed according to two correlated schemas. We can say now that at the anthropomorphic level, the schemas correspond to the isotopic spaces which are the places where perfor- mances occur, and that each space is made up of two deixes8 which are conjoined (because they correspond to the same axis of contradiction), but are not conformal; they are equivalent, at the fundamental level, to the contradictory terms: dd, On the other hand, the hypotaxic axes d2 -- d, and d -- d2 constitute heterotopic spaces whose deixes are disjunctive, because they do not belong to the same schemas, but conformal, since they are linked by the relation of presupposi- tion. Hence the circulation of value, interpreted as a string of transfers of objects- values, can take two courses: (1) F (d, -- O0 -- d)--*F (d, ~ O -&gt; dQ) This in the particular case of the Russian tales studied by Propp, can be interpreted as follows: society (d0) experiences a lack, the villain (d,) ravishes the king's daughter (0) and moves her elsewhere to hide her (d2). (2) F (d2 -&gt; O --, d2)--* F (d2 - O --d,1) 81.e., s-- s2 and ----s. DIACRITICS/March 1977 35</page><page sequence="14">This will mean: the hero (d2) finds somewhere (d2) the king's daughter (0) and returns here to her parents (d,). Thus the Russian tale manifests a circular transmission of values by utilizing, successively, two performing subjects and by valorizing one of the conformal spaces (that of the hero) at the expense of the other (that of the villain) [1973]. It is clear, however, that here we have nothing more than a simple doubling of the narrative. Myths of origin generally consider the absence of a given object of value as an original situation and the acquisition of values follows a single course (2). This is perfectly understandable, moreover: what is acquisition of value for the deixis d, is necessarily and simultaneously deprivation of value for the deixis d2, and vice versa. According to the perspective adopted, the same trajectory of value-transfers is sub- ject to two interpretations: the narrative is at once a story of victory and a story of defeat. What determines the choice of one of these two interpretations does not stem from the narative syntax but from the axiological articulation of content values: given the two conformal spaces, the investment of the one is given initially as euphoric and that of the other as dysphoric [cf. 1966]. Limiting ourselves for the moment to objective values, we may say that the topological syntax of transfers, doubling the courses of meaning apprehension de- scribed as logical operations at the level of the fundamental grammar, organizes the narration as a value-creating process. It is consequently this topological syntax which has the task of providing meaning to the narrative and it constitutes the latter's principal armature. Thus from the formal viewpoint, just as the translative utterances are the terminal utterances of performances and imply them logically, the syntactic trajectories expressed in the form of transfers constitute in fact syntagmatic strings of performances: that is, syntactic units of a higher order. 3.4.3. The installation [institution] of syntactic operators. Such a topological syntax is however purely descriptive: we have insisted on this point in denying any operational character to the actants of the translative utter- ances, which we have designated, in order to avoid any confusion, as deixes and not as addressers or addressees. This is because a syntax of operators has to be con- structed independently of a syntax of operations: a meta-semiotic level must be put in place in order to justify the transfers of value. The syntactic operators are conceived here as subjects endowed with the virtual capacity for particularizing that which will make them capable of accomplishing the transfer operation envisaged. This virtuality of the practice is nothing other than a modality: knowledge of ability; it can be formulated, as we have already seen, in two different ways: either as a modal utterance representing the subject's knowing- how-to-do or his ability-to-do; or as an attributive utterance, signalling the acquisi- tion of a modal value by the subject. If the subjects are transformed into operators following the attribution of a modal value (an attribution which we have just replaced by the more satisfying function of transfer), then the installation of operators can be established according to the same model of topological syntax of transfer, with this difference that the loci of transfers are no longer deixes here, but subject-actants. The operator thus estab- lished and endowed with a knowing-how-to-do or an ability-to-do becomes only then capable of realizing the performance for which it has just been created. Two series of performances can then be distinguished: (a) performances allowing for the acquisition and the transmission of modal values and (b) performances characterized by the acquisition and the transfer of objective values. The first install the subjects as operators, the second then effect the operations; the former create virtualities, the latter realize them. Thus alongside a topological course foreseen for the transfer of objective values and which institutes, as we have seen, a first syntagmatic string of performances, a second course of the same type can be predicted for the transfer of modal values. We cannot elaborate here on the origin of the first operator-actant which ini- tiates the syntactic trajectory: that would entail close examination of a particular 36 DIACRITICS/March 1977</page><page sequence="15">narrative unit, the contract that institutes the subject of desire by the attribution of the modality of wanting [vouloir] (cf. 1966, pp. 195-96), the probable realization of a "causing-to-want" skimming from the original sender. It will suffice to note for the moment that it is the wanting of the subject which makes the subject prone to carry out the first performance, marked by the attribution of the modal value of the knowledge or ability. A first hierarchy of modal values may be indicated; it orients as follows the syntactic trajectory, want -- know -- be able -- do and serves as a basis for the organization of the syntagmatic string of performances. Certain implications of such an orientation are immediately visible: a) only the acquisition of the modal value of ability makes operative subject prone to carry out the performance which attributes objective value to that subject; b) it follows that the acquisition of the modal value of knowledge has as its con- sequence the attribution of the ability-to-do (the mediation of this capacity-for- practice is necessary for the actualization of the practice); c) on the other hand, the mediation of knowledge does not seem necessary for the acquisition of the ability-to-do. This latter feature allows us to distinguish two sorts of subjects: "knowing" subjects whose aptitude for carrying out the performances stems from a knowing-how-to-do initially acquired, and the subjects which are "powerful" [puissants] by nature. Note: The acquisition of a modal value by the subject (or the anti-subject), which is manifested, for example, through the obtaining of a magical agent or of a message-object of knowledge, institutes the subject as adjuvant (or as opponent) capable of moving on to the following performance. Such a syntagmatic string, established outside of the formal framework of tranla- tive utterances, that is, without considering the actants implied, makes it possible already to specify the nature of the relationship between two different types of performances: a string of performances is oriented, since the performance institut- ing the syntactic operator is followed by the performance which effects the syntactic operation; at the same time, the objective performance implies the modal perfor- mance. 3.4.4. The topological syntax of modal values. Given the polemical nature of narrativity, two syntactic operators are necessary in order to establish a narrative syntax: we have, for this reason, already envisaged two subjects (S, and S2) for the construction of the performance. It is consequently the axis of exchange between these two subjects which constitutes the locus of modal value transfers: the attribution of a modal value to S, supposes that S2 is simultaneously deprived of this value. Two courses for the transfer of modal values will then be envisaged, according to whether we are dealing with a "knowing" or an "able" subject, i.e., according to the priority accorded to the acquisition of one or the other of the two modalities in question. a) In the first case, the syntagmatic string will be oriented as follows: TU1 (S--O: know-S2)-- TU2 (S--O: be able-S2) It can be interpreted as the acquisition, by S2, of a capability deriving from a know- ledge previously obtained; and at the same time as the loss, by S,, of all capability owing to the loss of knowledge. b) In the second case, the orientation will be reversed: TUI (S2-O: be able--S1)- TU2 (S2-O: know-S1) DIACRITICS/March 1977 37</page><page sequence="16">The string can be interpreted as the acquisition by S, of a knowledge that derives from a recognized capability, and inversely as the loss, by S2, of all knowledge following upon the loss of capability. One of the two strings suffices to constitute, in combination with the string of transfers of objective values, the completed narrative. If however we have chosen as addressees of modal values two different subjects for each of the two courses (S2 and S,) [this is clearly an arbitrary choice], it is in order to account at the same time for the particular organization of the doubled narrative, such as it is presented, for example, in the form of a Russian folktale studied by Propp. Here we see, in fact, first the subject S2, axiologically labeled villain, acquiring modal values at the expense of S,: S2 = O1: know -- 02: be able S2 then gives up its place to the subject S1, labeled hero: S, takes over the previously acquired values, progressively depriving S2 of them. S, = O1: be able -- 02: know 3.4.5 The general form of the narrative grammar. We have just traced the broad outlines of a surface narrative syntax, or rather, only a part of this syntax relative to the body of the narrative itself. What is lacking in this sketch and what we can only indicate briefly here is the examination and the establishment of syntactic units for the framework of the narrative, corresponding to the initial and final sequences of manifested narrative. It would be a question, in this regard, of accounting for the syntactic units corresponding to what are, at the level of deep grammar, the hypotaxic relations of the taxonomic model, i.e., to the relations that can be established in this model between the terms s, and -2 on the one hand, and between the terms s2 and s, on the other. The starting point of the narration would be represented as the establishment of a con- junctive contractual relation between an addresser and an addressee, followed by a spatial disjunction between the two actants. The completion of the narrative would be marked, on the contrary, by a spatial conjunction and a final transfer of values, instituting a new contract through a new distribution of values, objective as well as modal. Even though remaining incomplete, our attempt should give at least some idea of what a syntactic organization of narrativity might be. We have recognized two sorts of oriented syntagmatic strings organizing the transfer of values, modal as well as objective, in the framework of a syntax which is topological in nature. The object- values are situated in the framework of terminal narrative utterances representing the consequences of performances and implying them logically; these syntagmatic strings are thus in reality arrangements of performances which, as syntactic units, are recurrent and formally identical. Another principle of syntagmatic organization has likewise been recognized: the performances are arranged in such a way that the first, characterized by the attribution of a modal value which institutes the subject- operator, must be followed by a second which actualizes the operation. As for the typical syntactic unit, we have seen that it can be conceived as a string of three narrative utterances which are linked by implications. In examining the narrative utterances, we have been able to sketch out a summary typology; by introducing the supplementary semantic determinations of their functions and by varying the number and the specifications of their actants, we have distinguished three principal types of narrative utterances: descriptive, modal, and translative; every utterance represents, on the level of surface narrative grammar, either a relation or an operation of a fundamental grammar. Such a narrative grammar, once achieved, would have both a deductive and an analytical form. It would trace a set of itineraries for the manifestation of meaning; on the basis of the elementary operations of the fundamental grammar which would take the paths of the process by which meaning is actualized through the combina- 38 DIACRITICS/March 1977</page><page sequence="17">tions of syntagmatic strings of the superficial grammar which are only anthropomor- phic representations of these operations, the contents are invested, through the intermediary of the performances, in the narrative utterances, organized in linear strings of canonical utterances linked among themselves, like the links in a single chain, by a series of logical implications. When we have such strings of narrative utterances, we shall be able to conceive-with the help of a rhetoric, of a stylistics, but also of a linguistic grammar-of the linguistic manifestations of narrativized signification.
