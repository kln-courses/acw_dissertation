<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mere Humor and Moral Humor: The Example of Mark Twain Harold H. Kolb, Jr. "Mark Twain is a jester, and very little more." New Quarterly Magazine (1876) "He is the great American humorist. But he is more than that." Book Buyer (1901) Humorous writing in nineteenth-century America, like sex, was privately enjoyed by many people but publicly defended by few. An appetite for laughter seemed to represent man's lower instincts. Art and literature, in the view of many critics, are "ever pointing upward, and the influence of true art upon man is to make him look upward, too, to that vast where his Ideal sits, 'pinnacled in the lofty ether dim.'"* Curiously, Mark Twain would have agreed. In 1865, a few days before his thirtieth birthday and just after finishing a sketch about a loaded frog that would launch his career as a humorist, Sam Clemens sat down in Virginia City, Nevada, and wrote to his brother that, after a miscellaneous life as typesetter, steamboat pilot, miner, and reporter, he had finally found his vocation: I have had a "call" to literature, of a low order ?i.e. humorous. It is nothing to be proud of, but it is my strongest suit, &amp; if I were to listen to that maxim of sterm duty which says that to do right you must multiply the one or the two or the three talents which the Almighty entrusts to your keeping, I would long ago have ceased to meddle with things for which 52</page><page sequence="2">Essays (Kolb) 53 I was by nature unfitted &amp; turned my attention to seriously scribbling to excite the laughter of God's creatures. Poor piti ful business!2 This extraordinary letter demonstrates that Mark Twain began his career by accepting the nineteenth-century notion that humor was an inferior genre. Though he spent four decades disproving this notion, and though he did more than any other American to help Sigmund Freud drag humor up and out of the shadows in 1905, Mark Twain never rid himself of the conviction that mere humor was not quite respectable. Nineteenth-century Americans bought the works of "Artemus Ward," "Josh Billings," "Bill Arp," "Petroleum Vesuvius Nasby," and other "Phunny Phellows," but they also bought the idea that the humorist was at the low end of a scale which ranked the poet at the top, that entertainment was but a ragged handmaiden to the princess Instruction, and that the "spirit of irreverence [was] the great fault in American character."3 It is an article of our literary faith that Mark Twain set all this straight. We like to believe Frederick Anderson's claim that most critics in the United States, England and throughout Europe did come to accept Mark Twain on his own terms. . . . Twain was not uninterested in what reviewers might say, but his chosen subjects and style show no change as a result of criticism. He educated the critics in his purposes rather than accepting their instruction... .4 In many ways Anderson is correct, but an important counter current needs to be recognized. While Mark Twain did to some extent educate his critics, he also, to some extent, accepted their terms. In responding to the conventional notion that mere humor was inferior, that?as Matthew Arnold put it ? " 'the funny man' [was a] national misfortune" in America,5 Mark Twain and his defenders protested too much. The development of this ambiguous protest, which concedes as much as it challenges, is perfectly illustrated in the reviews of W. D. Howells, who insisted for three decades that Mark Twain was a significant writer because his humor was responsible, humane, moral. Howells began by noting incidentally, in brief reviews of The Innocents Abroad and Roughing It, that the humor is not "indulged at the cost of the weak or helpless side," that it is "always amiable, manly, and generous."6 He upped the ante by detecting in Sketches, New and Old "a growing seriousness of meaning in the apparently unmoralized drolling" {My Mark Twain, p. 102). Five years later, in an 1880 review of A Tramp Abroad, Howells developed his theory in full:</page><page sequence="3">54 American Literary Realism 19,1 [Twain's] humor springs from a certain intensity of common sense, a passionate love of justice, and a generous scorn of what is petty and mean. ... It may be claiming more than a humorist could wish to assert that he is always in earnest; but this strikes us as the paradoxical charm of Mr. Clemens's best humor. Its wildest extravagance is the break and fling from a deep feeling, a wrath with some folly which disquiets him worse than other men, a personal hatred for some hum bug or pretension that embitters him beyond anything but laughter. ... If you enter into the very spirit of his humor, you feel that if he could set these things right there would be very little laughing. At the bottom of his heart he has often the grimness of a reformer; his wit is turned by preference not upon human nature, not upon droll situations and things abstractly ludicrous, but upon matters that are out of joint, that are unfair or unnecessarily ignoble, and cry out to his love of justice for discipline. {My Mark Twain, p. 109) Howells's later reviews provide little variation from this theme: I warn the reader that if he leaves out of the account an indig nant sense of right and wrong, a scorn of all affectation and pretense, an ardent hate of meanness and injustice, he will come indefinitely short of knowing Mrk Twain (1882; My Mark Twain, p. 120) Here he is to the full the humorist, as we know him; but he is very much more, and his strong, indignant, often infuriate hate of injustice, and his love of equality, burn hot through the manifold adventures and experiences of the tale. (1890; My Mark Twain, p. 124) I could not help wishing others to value him for qualities besides his humor. I could not help hoping that they would note how there is no word of all his writing that flatters or even suffers wrong. ... In fine, what I am trying to make appear is that this humorist of ours is at heart a poet. . . . (1897)7 These reviews clarify the terms in which Mark Twain was seen in his lifetime. His opponents found his work of "colossal irreverence" and low moral level, whose "humour failed to meet the obligation of 'enforcing morality and exposing vice and folly.' " His champions, often echoing Howells, replied that Twain touches "gently and lovingly</page><page sequence="4">Essays (Kolb) 55 all serious things," that "to many refined people he may seem the vulgar buffoon . . . [but] he reverences what is essentially worthy of rever ence," that he is "the 'sacred poet' of the Mississippi."8 These cham pions are not wrong, for Mark Twain's writing often serves moral purposes, though not always, or inevitably, or necessarily. Thus, Howells and the other advocates defended Twain not by defending humor as such, but by propping it up through association with accepted nineteenth-century values, a strategy that distorts the nature of humor and one that ultimately led Mark Twain to misconceive his talents. Perhaps it was the only strategy available to them, and the one most effective at a time when American humorous writing was just emerging from a swamp of homicidal pranks, stretched puns, and tortured orthography. In any case, it was a strategy enthusiastically approved by Mark Twain himself, who, like all humorists, kept one foot firmly planted in the conventions of his time. When he read Howells's review of Sketches, New and Old, Twain immediately replied that it was a perfectly superb notice. You can easily believe that nothing ever gratified me so much before . . . [for] yours is the recog nized critical Court of Last Resort in this country. . . . Mrs. Clemens says, "tell him / am just as grateful to him as I can be." . . . The thing that gravels her is that I am so persistently glorified as a mere buffoon... .9 Similarly, Twain found Howells's notice of A Tramp Abroad "perfectly lovely, &amp; it came with its reviving breath just at the right moment. . . . Your most generous review has saved me." On the back of this letter, Livy Clemens ?again a stalking-horse for her husband's opinions ? wrote that We do thank you most heartily for your notice of Mr Clemens book ?I have wondered so many times why some one did not take note of certain things in Mr Clemens which seemed to me his strong points, and now you have spoken of them so of course I am peculiarly pleased ? A few days later another voice was added to this pious conspiracy. "Joe Twichell was here last night," wrote Twain to Howells, "wild with delight over your notice of the Tramp.' "10 These comments outline the public and private history of a campaign that succeeded. By the end of the nineteenth century the "wild humorist of the Pacific Slope" had become "a philosopher and a teacher." Driven from within, nudged from without by reviewers, by Olivia, by Matthew Arnold, by Howells and the Atlantic, Mark Twain,</page><page sequence="5">56 American Literary Realism 19,1 in his progress from mere humorist to moral humorist, attempted to lay to rest the doubts he had expressed to his brother in 1865. But the costs of this campaign were high. The writings of Mark Twain which followed A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court demonstrate, for the most part, artistic uncertainty and authorial frustration. There was, however, no flagging of energy. Mark Twain published 18 books and 180 sketches, tales, and essays between 1890 and 1910; and he left behind unfinished manuscripts so numerous that in the Bancroft Library, according to Frederick Anderson, "we count by filing cabinet drawers, not even by the number of documents."11 Certainly Pudd'nhead Wilson, the Autobiography, and the various versions of The Mysterious Stranger are important works, and an interesting volume or two could be pieced out from the remainder. But as a whole, the productions of the last third of Mark Twain's career are fitful and disappointing. This ground has been besieged by critics, and we now know a good deal about Twain's business catastrophes, his family sorrows, his increasingly pyrotechnic agnosticism, his disenchantment with turn-of-the-century business and politics. To this list of problems let us add one more?a change in genre. Mark Twain's early humorous works explode in many directions, with, as Bret Harte noted, "very little moral or aesthetic limitation."12 Readers who know only Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn would be embarrassed and perhaps shocked by the jokes at the expense of Blacks, Chinese, Jews, Irish, and Indians that occur throughout the apprentice writings. But by 1874 Mark Twain, established as "a scribbler of books, and an immovable fixture among the other rocks of New England," had disciplined his humor and deepened his ideas. Married, settled, celebrated, and turning forty, Twain was proud to be writing for the readers of the Atlantic Monthly?"for it is the only audience that I sit down before in perfect serenity (for the simple reason that it don't require a 'humorist' to paint himself striped &amp; stand on his head every fifteen minutes.)"13 In the following fifteen years, Twain produced a succession of major works, from "Old Times on the Mississippi" to Connecticut Yankee, that weave together an extraordinary blend of compelling narrative, humorous observation, and perceptive understanding of the human condition. The pure fun of the early pieces has become, as Moncure Conway put it, "fun and . . . philosophy."14 In the late works another shift takes place, and though the fun is never entirely lost?the darkest works are illuminated too frequently by flashes of humor to support the accusation of pessimism?philosophy becomes dominant. Having climbed to fame on the ladder of laughter, Mark Twain attempted to legitimize his success with a string of books</page><page sequence="6">Essays (Kolb) 57 whose genres were presumably more valuable than humor: Joan of Arc, King Leopold's Soliloquy, What is Man?, Christian Science, Is Shakespeare Dead? These works seem to be inspired by the analogy used by H. H. Boyesen, a Howells prot?g?, in his Atlantic review of The Prince and the Pauper in 1881: Rossini, with a reputation founded upon dozens of dazzling comic operas, could not rest, in his old age, until he had pro duced a solemn mass which might stand beside the grave works of more majestic composers.15 No major writer was less equipped than Mark Twain for solemn, grave, and majestic compositions. When his gifts for contrast, drama, and the vernacular were subordinated for history, theology, and philosophy, he was, like Antaeus, lifted off the ground of his strength. Satire became fulmination and the sharp specificity of his humorous vision?there is no such thing as a general joke?was lost in abstraction and generalization. The satirist of men in the Mississippi Valley became the moralist of Man across the eons of history. Mark Twain turned into the preacher that he had attacked for a half century. "I have always preached," Twain proclaimed in his Autobiography: Humorists of the "mere" sort cannot survive. Humor is only a fragrance, a decoration. . . . There are those who say a novel should be a work of art solely and you must not preach in it, you must not teach in it. That may be true as regards novels but it is not true as regards humor. Humor must not profes sedly teach and it must not professedly preach, but it must do both if it would live forever. And then, in the next sentence, the humorist in Mark Twain rose up and fired a shot at the preacher: "By forever, I mean thirty years."16 Thirty years after Mark Twain dictated his Autobiography, critics were embroiled in a twentieth-century version of the nineteenth-century debate over mere humor and moral humor. Mark Twain was brought to trial for America's lingering Calvinism, rampant materialism, and artistic barrenness?Van Wyck Brooks for the prosecution, Bernard De Voto for the defense. Brooks, ironically continuing the judgment of the age he was castigating, claimed in The Ordeal of Mark Twain that humor was Twain's problem. Stifled by mother and wife, frustrated by materialism, handicapped by being born in "the barrenest spot in all Christendom ... for the seed of genius to fall in," Mark Twain adopted [the role of humorist] unwillingly, as a compromise,</page><page sequence="7">58 American Literary Realism 19,1 at the expense of his artistic self-respect. . . . Thus his humour, which had originally served him as a protective coloration, ended by stunting and thwarting his creative life and leaving Mark Twain a scarred child . . . [who failed, ulti mately,] to put away childish things and walk the stage as poets do.17 The trouble with Brooks, replied Bernard De Voto in Mark Twain's America, was his strange thesis that Clemens really wanted to be Shelley. . . . Mr. Brooks dislikes humor. ... If Mark Twain really wanted to be Shelley, the desire was buried deeper than any research, psychological or skeptical, has revealed. The only fact that can be recovered ... is that Mark's earliest experiments with literature were humor, that he wrote humor through all the formative years of his career, and that during that time he wrote nothing but humor. ... His literary intelligence was shaped by the life of the frontier and found expression in the themes and forms developed by the humor of the frontier. [His best writings] are the humor of the frontier in its greatest incandescence, realizing its fullest scope and expressing its qualities on the level of genius.18 In their later works, the two critics reached a certain accommoda tion. Brooks quoted De Voto in The Times of Melville and Whitman (1947) and revised his earlier thesis, concluding that some of Twain's writings, along with those of Melville and Whitman, "were destined to live with the best in America." Although he had condemned Mark Twain's humor in 1920, Brooks praised it in 1947, presenting examples of "the comic understatements, the equally comic exaggerations, the contrasts" of our "serio-comic Homer."19 De Voto, after an exuberant defense of humor in Mark Twain's America in 1932, turned his attention a decade later, in Mark Twain at Work, to the author's inhibitions, psychic blocks, and "tortured revisions and adjustments." Moving perilously close to the psychobiography he had earlier disparaged in The Ordeal of Mark Twain, DeVoto even began to sound like Brooks: "Art is the terms of an armistice signed with fate."20 This crisscross of scholarship reflects the temperament of the scholars?middle age mellows some, sharpens others?but it also points toward a resolution. Early and late, Brooks and DeVoto are both right. Mark Twain is a moralist, whose scalpel lays bare dis honesty and greed and injustice and hypocritical piety. If not a philosopher, he is a thinker, and the course of his career can be charted</page><page sequence="8">Essays (Kolb) 59 by the progress of his thought, from ridiculing Sunday schools and romantic pretensions to satirizing materialism, inhumanity, and slavery. It is precisely this progress that creates our unhappiness with the ending of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, where Mark Twain reverts in the final ten chapters to earlier, lesser targets. He has switched from a canon to a rifle, and we miss the roar of the artillery that sweeps through the middle section of the novel. At the same time, Mark Twain is a writer whose mode of perception is essentially humorous ?a writer who sees the world in the sharp clash of contrast, whose energy often satisfies our aggressions, whose vision unravels our perceptions as it simultaneously organizes them, for humor, like mercury, celebrates instability, speed, motion, change. Both of these aspects?what Conway meant by "fun and philosophy," what Brooks meant by "serio-comic"?must be seen together. They are often linked in stunning harmony in the great works of the middle phase of Mark Twain's career. The humorous contrasts between Bemis's buffalo and other quadrupeds, Horace Bixby and the cub pilot, Miss Watson's heaven and the Widow Douglas's, Merlin's magic and Hank Morgan's miracles, not only reinforce but actually embody the meaning: the wonder of the West, the rocky road to maturation, the anthropomorphic nature of religion, the kinship of superstition and science. Yet we need also to recognize the lack of relationship between humorous method and significant meaning in some of Mark Twain's writings. A reader can enjoy the whimsical puns and hoaxes and "Sabbath Reflections" in Twain's early compositions, but often he must ask himself what the point is. The late works are pointed enough, but there, in What Is Man? for example, the humor is fitful and decorative. In the 1870s and 1880s Mark Twain is at his best, precisely because of the balance of philosophy and fun, but even here we can sometimes detect a tension between morality and humor, a tension succinctly expressed by Theodor in "The Chronicle of Young Satan," when the clumsy little clay men and horses made by the boys and touched alive by Satan reel and sprawl on their uneven legs, and fall over kicking and helpless: "It made us all laugh, though it was a shameful thing to see."21 The serious themes of Mark Twain's major works required a steady focus; the humor of his spirit demanded a rapier play, for humor seeks surprise, reversal, escape?change the joke and slip the yoke. These differing needs help explain the contemporary debate about Jim in Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Many objections to what Ralph Ellison called "a white man's inadequate portrait of a slave" focus on the repeated use, some two hundred times, of the word "nigger," yet the lack of similar objections to the same word in Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, and Richard Wright, and Alice Walker suggests that the</page><page sequence="9">60 American Literary Realism 19,1 problem lies elsewhere. Jim, many critics insist, is a model of dignity and humanity, and his example is so persuasive to the young white boy that he will risk hell for his black comrade. Certain passages are constantly cited: It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble myself to a nigger?but I done it, and I warn't ever sorry for it afterwards, neither. I didn't do him no more mean tricks, and I wouldn't done that one if I'd a knowed it would make him feel that way.22 It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was a trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself: "All right, then, I'll go to hell'?and tore it up. It was awful thoughts, and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the whole thing out of my head; and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't. And for a starter, I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog. (p. 272) I knowed he was white inside, (p. 345) But these heroic moments, and Jim's dignity, are punctuated by a number of passages that work to denigrate Jim. Jim said the witches bewitched him and put him in a trance, and rode him all over the State. . . . Every time he told it he spread it more and more, till by-and-by he said they rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back was all over saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers, (pp. 23-24) "Wunst I had foteen dollars, but I tuck to specalat'n', en got busted out." "What did you speculate in, Jim?" "Well, fust I tackled stock." "What kind of stock?"</page><page sequence="10">Essays (Kolb) 61 "Why, live stock. Cattle, you know. I put ten dollars in a cow." (p. 71) "Dat's the way Sollermun was gwyne to do wid de chile. Now I want to ast you. . . . What use is half a chile? I would'n give a dern for a million un um." (p. Ill) "Spose a man was to come to you and say Polly-voo-franzy? what would you think?" "I wouldn' think nuffn; I'd take en bust him over de head. Dat is, if he warn't white. I wouldn't 'low no nigger to call me dat." (p. 113) Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a corn pone that was in Jim's pan, and we went along with Nat to see how it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most mashed all his teeth out; and there warn't ever anything could a worked better, (p. 313) And there are passages which ironically expose the Mississippi Valley prejudice that Huck has unconsciously absorbed. Yet humor is a slippery affair, and these passages have a tendency to float loose from their ironic contexts and offend some white and many black readers. Well, he was right; he was most always right; he had an un common level head, for a nigger, (p. 109) He was thinking about his wife and his children, away up yonder, and he was low and homesick; because he hadn't ever been away from home before in his life; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for their'n. It don't seem natural, but I reckon it's so. (p. 201) "It warn't the grounding?that didn't keep us back but a little. We blowed out a cylinder-head." "Good gracious! anybody hurt?" "No'm. Killed a nigger." "Well, it's lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt." (p. 280) Nigger Jim is saint and fool, a guide to morality and the butt of jokes. Both sides of Mark Twain's dualism are satisfied, and one might argue that life is like that, full of foolish saints and saintly fools. But in this particular case, at the present moment in American history, Twain's mixture lies uneasily on our delicate racial conscience.</page><page sequence="11">62 American Literary Realism 19,1 Mark Twain's lavish legacy would perhaps have been even richer if he had recognized more completely the connection between humor and morality, and their sometimes conflicting claims. On one hand, he might have resisted the playful jokes, the golden apples for which he turned aside, that occasionally distract his narratives, especially in the early works. On the other hand, he could perhaps have lessened, especially in the late works, his heavy-handed apologies for nineteenth century values of altruism and motherhood and pathos, and his lumbering attacks on straw gods. Perhaps not, for this may be asking our remarkable leopard to change his spots. But Twain's career might at least have been less vexed if he had resisted the establishment's suspicions about humor. Forty years after confessing to his brother that the humorist's trade was a pitiful business, Twain still had his doubts. In "3,000 Years Among the Microbes," an unfinished manuscript written in 1905, the chief character, a cholera germ nicknamed Huck and associated in a cancellation with "Mark Twain," finally establishes himself by founding a College of Morals: I painted my sign myself, on a square of tin, and . . . then I nailed it on the house door: INSTRUCTION GIVEN IN Political Morals Commercial Morals Ecclesiastical Morals and Morals23 In his last years, Mark Twain enjoyed wearing his Oxford gown and playing the role of Professor of moral philosophy. What he failed fully to appreciate was how appropriately incongruous, how magnificently necessary, were the cap and bells that came with his philosophical robes. University of Virginia Notes 1.

It is to Howells's credit that even though he was the chief spokesman in his day for Mark Twain as moralist, he was aware of the danger of the interpretation he did so much to establish. In his longest and most thoughtful essay on Twain, published in 1901, Howells reviewed Twain's works and the evolution of readers' attitudes toward those works, concluding that "it would be rather awful if the general recognition of his prophetic function should implicate the renunciation of the humor that has endeared him to mankind. It would be well for his younger following to beware of reversing the error of the elder, and taking everything in earnest, as these once took nothing in earnest from him" {My Mark Twain, p. 161). Howells also should be given credit for another key insight into his friend's talent and the nature of humor itself. Though Howells, in an early chapter of My Mark Twain, calls Clemens "the most serious, the most humane, the most conscientious of men," he added a perceptive concluding note to his description of what he called the "catastrophe" of Twain's speech at the Atlantic dinner in honor of Whittier's birthday in 1877: "To be sure, [Emerson, Longfellow, and Holmesl were not themselves mocked; the joke was, of course, beside them; nevertheless, their personality was trifled with, and I could only end by reflecting that if I had been in their place I should not have liked it myself. Clemens would have liked it himself, for he had the heart for that sort of wild play, and he so loved a joke that even if it took the form of a liberty, and was yet a good joke, he would have loved it" (p. 54). An additional demonstration of Howells's favorite theme of Mark Twain as moralist can be found in his introduction at the Whittier dinner: "[Mark Twain is] a humorist who never makes you blush to have enjoyed his joke; whose generous wit has no meanness in it, whose fun is never at the cost of anything honestly high or good, but comes from the soundest of hearts and the clearest of heads."
