X. psychologists, and physicians, but which has never received compre- hensive treatment as a whole-if one except Wundt's latest work as an achievement of this kind. Certainly the work in review has both the faults and the advantages of a certain onesidedness of conception and presentation, the outlook being that of the philologist. Confusion of terms or of meanings is the source of much confused thinking on philosophical questions. The remedy is to seek the origin of language and of thought in language. A brief introduction acquaints the reader with the purpose of the enquiry, but leaves him in a general state of expectancy regarding numerous psychological and philosophical questions whose solution is to be found in the prob- lem of the origin of speech, but without the definite guidance or focusing of attention which it is the part of an introduction to supply. The first chapter corrects to some extent the impression that the present work has taken all knowledge to be its province, and after a short resume of various hypotheses which concern the origin of man and his speech faculty, the well-known theories of ' interjection' and 'imitation 'are introduced. These are at once abandoned on the ground that words do not retain the impress of primitive emotions, on the one hand, and, on the other, bear little resemblance to the cries of animals which the second of these theories invokes. -Later in this work we find that the author accepts Max MUller's I2i roots as forming the original content of a primitive Aryan speech. This may be one reason for his rejection of the interjection and imitation hypotheses. This chapter contains some account of the beginnings of the study of Sanskrit and the literature of India, concluding with a brief men- tion of the Darwinian theory of descent and the religious dogmatism by which it has been opposed. In this, as in most of the questions touching the origin of human speech and reason, the philosophy of language alone is competent to decide. " The point at which the animal ends and man begins may be precisely determined, since it coincides with the beginning of the root-period of language, and language is reason " (p. 40). The science of language has as its chief instrument philology, and it is from this aspect that the solution of the problem must be sought. The chapter on " The Philosophy of Language" depreciates the mul- tiplication of philosophical terms, and the belief-current in philosophy of the past-that such terms represent real entities rather than aspects of psychical life or activity. The author concludes, with Max MUller, that " language is not thought plus sound," but that " thought is lan- guage without sound " (p. 55). We think aloud, or the process of</page><page sequence="3">No. 4.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 427 thought is unaccompanied by vocal sounds. In any case we think in words. This is to identify thought with articulate language. Ges- ture language is not only aided, but, the author seems to say, made possible by the other and higher sign-system of social intercourse. Tribal communication by means of sign-language is accomplished only as the participants think, each in his own language, and trans- late their thoughts into pantomime (p. 56). Now, using the term language in the wider sense, to include all the outward manifestations of psychical activity that form the means of communication between man and his fellow, it may well be that thought is only the internal aspect of language, or that thought is impossible without language as a social medium of some sort. But there is a general opinion that the language of gesture is capable of a high degree of development as a speech medium, that, contrary to the opinion of M. Moncalm, it is cap - able of being carried to a degree of efficiency which is compatible with intellectual operations, that it is a natural system of sign-communica- tion, and, in the beginning, not dependent upon those already in pos- session of verbal speech (the author cites the case of deaf-mutes, p. 56), or even that the evolution of the latter and higher form of speech- intercourse may have been the result of accidental causes which have diverted a more primitive form of expression into other and better channels. At any rate, one may fairly say that the language of gesture and expression, presumably the earlier, from the present state of our knowledge of the subject, has hardly been given sufficient space or due respect by the author, although, later in the work, sign-language, in- deed, receives mention as the earliest mode of communication. With the fourth chapter we enter upon the domain of comparative psychology. The point of departure for man and animal is the same. With both the cognition of things proceeds from the impressions of sense. But their paths soon diverge. Man possesses speech, thinks objects, and represents them when they are no longer present. Of some interest is the statement, which might not pass unchallenged by the psychologist of animal life, that the most intelligent brute never interposes an instrument for the accomplishment of an act between his will and its realization. Romanes's receptual level of intelligence would hardly seem inadequate to this, but, stated in terms of the con- scious recognition of cause and effect (p. 6o), comparative psychol- ogy would doubtless side with the author. In the social environment constituted by the " First Human Societies " (Chapter V), man slowly elaborated the speech mechanism which constitutes his badge of superiority over the brute creation.</page><page sequence="4">428 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. X The phenomena of nature, later to be adored or made subject to law and reason, wore for him the aspect of a terrifying dream. His facul- ties were "between sleeping and waking," and fear dominated his life. But common sentiment and collective activity assisted or lent outward expression by signs and inarticulate sounds, the latter the in- voluntary accompaniments of physical effort. These, the 'clamor concomitants' of Noir6, became differentiated as men applied them- selves to the various occupations which their primitive mode of life made necessary, or their growing knowledge of nature permitted. For this theory the author acknowledges his indebtedness to Noir6. Max MUller's I2i parent-Aryan roots furnish the philological mate- rial upon which depends much of the evidence supporting the hypothe- sis. These roots are verbal, the ultimate elements of language, and expressive of human activity. If, however, we may believe with such writers as Sayer and Farrar that these roots never constituted a true language, our reliance upon them as indications of the probable course taken in the differentiation of sounds is considerably weakened. Besides, words such as measuring, hating, knowing, thinking, and many others, witness a tolerably advanced state of society, and it is somewhat difficult to believe that language was then in its beginnings, or that from these roots we can conclude that the verb rather than the noun, action rather than the object, was foremost in human speech or interest. Space does not permit a detailed account of the remainder of the chapter, which treats of substantive and the transference of man's personal activity to the objects of nature. The author summarizes by saying that: (') the basis of all roots is human creative activity, (2) the source of all our abstract ideas is the representation of purely material acts, (3) modern idioms are built on the ruins of ancient language and the knowledge of man's nature, and the entire history of humanity will be revealed by the study of ancient language. A few pages are devoted to the stages of language, the first seeming to correspond to the usual 'isolating stage,' the second being the ag- glutinative, and the third the period of myth. Myths are accorded separate treatment in the seventh chapter. They take their origin in metaphor-not the artificial and conscious metaphor of poetry-and in terms whose root-sense has been forgotten. Hence we ought not to expect that all myths will be explained. Myth pre- cedes mythology, the latter an inevitable and distinct period in the lives of peoples. The eighth and ninth chapters renew a discussion begun in the fifth</page><page sequence="5">No. 4.] REVIEWS OF BOOEKS. 429 chapter on the nature and origin of general and abstract ideas. The root-terms do not express single but repeated acts, such as pounding, breaking, and thus the verb contains a conception (Chap. V). In the case of substantives, the term, which at first expresses the general in the sense of the vague, is gradually transferred to the particular object. Yet of abstract ideas in the true sense, primitive man, like the animal, has none. These ideas constitute the mental economy of later thought, and correspond to nothing real. The origin of the religious concept, the concept of God, furnishes subject-matter for positions of the ninth chapter and the four remaining chapters of the book. Problems of religion have been approached from two points of view. One question is: What is meant by the idea of God? Another is: How did the concept arise? Metaphysical solutions and dependent epistemological discussions are so unsatisfying that the only course appears to be the genetic, or rather the historic- philological treatment of such conceptions which finds them in the evo- lution of the human mind (p. 226), first present to man in external phenomena, then in his own person and phenomenal self, the epitome of all humanity. " Finally in the clouds of psychological mythology and behind the veil of the ego, the true self which seeks the divine is revealed to man " (p. 266); it is the infinite in man as in nature. The search is revealed as man follows the clue of his own activity, passing through the earliest stages of anthropomorphism to the recog- nition of law and moral order, the formation of codes and religion. Interesting is the author's treatment of fetichism, polytheism, and the comparison of Hebrew with Aryan conceptions. The ordinary view of the first is a circulus in arguendo, for before there can be fetichism there must be some notion of the divine. Before polytheism or mono- theism is henotheism; for the primitive mind had no clear conception of plural or singular. ' God is,' not, ' there is only one God.' Thus the mind of the Hindu oscillates between the representation of many gods and the representation of one (p. 2I7). The Hebrew idea of God differs from the Hindu, partly because the former tended to treat natural phenomena as such, while the latter transformed them into personal agents, partly because of a certain inelasticity of the Semitic language which did not allow modification of original mean- ings once incorporated in root-words. Thus an abstract idea of deity such as was possible with the Hindu was not possessed by the Hebrew. For the same reason, the myth element is lacking with the latter al- though, on the other hand, the Old Testament abounds in metaphor.

X. matter of more than ordinary interest to the layman, in fact there is not a page which is dry or devoid of interest in the thirteen chapters which comprise the book. The grace and charm of mythology has more than usual attraction as one reads. The concluding chapter of " Observa- tions and Reflections " on the scientific explanation of the purpose of existence is short and somewhat disappointing in its indefiniteness. We are brought to the recognition of the fact that philosophy and science are merely the combination of a few roots and I2I concepts of the understanding; but this is hardly sufficient fulfilment of early promises, although the intermediate matter well repays the perusal of the book from cover to cover. Whether one is seriously minded toward the main problem and conversant with its details, or ap- proaches it for guidance, imitation, or general information, there must be much in the treatment and solution of its questions to satisfy and please the reader. But one remains unconvinced that the phil- ologist holds the key to the mystery of existence. The out-of-hand acceptance of Noire's theory disposes of debatable matter in too sum- mary a way. Comparative psychology indeed finds a small place in the work, but anatomy, physiology, embryology, phonetics, the science of gesture and expression, and even the study of the child with its stage of self-taught or consciously invented language, are witnesses which receive no summons or cross-examination commensurate with the evidence they may furnish. Yet in this labyrinthine problem all clues deserve to be followed. The early decision in favor of the human activity hypothesis allows interest to center about the religious concept for the remainder of the work. But though it "may be much to show," as the author says, that God, and soul, and immortality are not empty names, and that belief in the supersensible is not only universal but inevitable (p. I35), there are others who would reserve space for the question of validity when attempts are made to round off replies to the problem of origin and development with wider and and more conclusive generalizations.
