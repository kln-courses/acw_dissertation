By examining iconographic, archaeological, and ethnohistoric evidence, I argue that these figurines were actively used in household healing rituals concerning successful biological and social reproduction, comprised of the work, relationships, and attitudes that perpetuate human life. I then consider the physical experience of that ritual use by exploring the visual, tactile, auditory, and physiological aspects of these figurines. I contend that their visibility in workshops, markets, and the home presented an image of the female body that reinforced women’s important roles in the production and reproduction of the household and society. Finally, the material qualities of these figurines reveal ancient discourses on the human body and experimentation with bodily representation in terms of scale, form, and material. Worldwide, ancient figurines have fascinated archaeologists since such topics as the material characteristics of Mesoamerican figur- the dawn of the discipline (see Bailey 2005:2). Bailey (2005:6) ines (Klein and Victoria Lona 2009) as well as their life histories argues that this fascination is due to their materiality, to figurines (Overholtzer and Stoner 2011). These works all emphasize the as “expressive material culture,” and to their miniaturization.

This analysis, following Bailey draw us in today, as they would have in the past.

Figurine producers made According to these scholars, Type I-A figurines often have red slips, in contrast with the white slip featured on most other Aztec figurines. Type I-A rattle figurines also differ in that they commonly having additional details such as facial features, headdress and clothing elements, and fingers emphasized and retouched with incision after molding (Otis Charlton 2001:28). Producers fired rattle figurines at a higher temperature than other types, and scholars describe the paste as being nearly vitrified (Kaplan 1958:37). Kaplan (1958) suggests that rattle figurines were made throughout the Basin of Mexico of the same clay used for Aztec Black-on-Orange pottery. All Type I-A figurines represent women who wear some variation on the double side-loop headdress with two top projections, sometimes called the “two prong” headdress (Figures 5 and 6). This headdress has been interpreted as represent- ing a braid that goes from the center of the head to above the ears and loops back onto the head. This hairstyle was not worn until adulthood (Arvey 1988:183) and may even be an indication of motherhood (McCafferty and McCafferty 1999:106). Type I-A fig- urines all feature incised eyes with a raised ring of clay and a rimmed, open mouth. All wear round earspools and necklaces, the latter most commonly made of bands with vertical incisions under- neath. This necklace type is confined to rattle figurines, including those subtypes representing adult women and Macuilxochitl. Women are depicted standing or kneeling, with hands resting under- neath the breasts or on the thighs (usually when the figure is kneel- ing). Most women wear skirts, some of which are decorated with a diamond pattern, border, belt, and/or copal bags. Attributes such as Figure 1. Cross-section drawing of rattle figurine.

An estimate can be made, women who appear to be of reproductive age. All represent young however, by including only those fragments that include some women with perky breasts (Figure 7).; some of these women are portion of the torso. In Kaplan’s sample of 184 rattle figurine pregnant, as indicated by a large, protruding abdomen (Figure 8), body fragments (1958), 18% (n= 33) featured smaller figures and and others carry one or two smaller figures commonly interpreted 3% (n= 6) were pregnant. Unfortunately, because of their fragmen- tary condition we cannot tell how many of the 184 figurines would have featured women that were neither pregnant nor holding smaller figures. These percentages thus significantly underestimate frequen- cies of the different subtypes. The Parsons (1972) and Millian (1981) publications do not enumerate those subtypes for their samples. Of the 75 rattle figurines with some portion of the torso preserved from the Xaltocan and the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology collections that were studied for the multisensory analysis of this paper, 9% (n= 7) were holding smaller figures and 3% (n= 2) were pregnant. Additionally, six figurines (8%) were complete enough to discern that the woman was neither pregnant nor holding a smaller figure. If identified as a child, the smaller figure would imply that the larger figure is a mother; if identified as a figurine, it would suggest that that larger figure is a figurine user—perhaps a healer or a housewife, for example. When a single figure is held, it is always a miniature representation of a female adult, complete with breasts and the two-prong headdress. Colonial codices sometimes Figure 3.

Drawing by Tom Quinn. miniature consistently exhibits an erect, rigid posture and is grasped by the torso in the hand of the adult female, rather than being held in her arms (in Figure 9, the adult hand is only visible from the side view, not shown; see Figure 11 where adult right hand is visible from the front). This posture lends support to the figurine interpretation. Less commonly, a figurine depicts a woman holding two smaller figures. Two examples, including one from the Musée de l’Homme in Paris (Brumfiel 1996:148) and one exhibited at the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City (Figure 11), each depict a woman holding the same miniature female in her right hand and a different figure wearing a slanted headdress in her left arm. The female figure held on the right is erect in posture and grasped by the hand, but the figure held on the left is slumped over the woman’s arm, with feet dangling forward. The flexible posture of the figure on the left indicates that a living child, and not a solid, ceramic figurine, might be represented. The positioning of the body over the arm obscures the torso, where breasts, loin- cloths, and other sex- and gender-specific characteristics would be visible, suggesting that age, and not gender, may have been the primary characteristic emphasized. Thus, Aztec rattle figurines likely depict women holding both figurines and children, with fig- urines appearing more commonly. The existence of figural represen- tations of women holding figurines indicates that women were likely the principal users of rattle figurines (Smith 2002:103). Moreover, the existence of women holding figurines and children would imply that women used rattle figurines for healing purposes, poss- ibly for children.

The representations of midwives and the reproductive life cycle in Aztec figurines seem to show a similar concern with healthy repro- duction, as well as with the product of that process—the child. When one considers that reproduction is only successful when the child reaches reproductive age, reproduction comes to be under- stood as a much longer process than typically conceived of in modern Western societies. Ginsburg and Rapp (1995) have convin- cingly argued that human biological reproduction cannot be divorced from the more comprehensive concept of social reproduc- tion, defined by feminist scholars as the work, activities, relation- ships, and attitudes related to the continuation of current and future generations of human life. Physical reproduction is not iso- lated from broader social and political processes, but rather “is always, everywhere, a politically and culturally constituted practice” (Stephens 1995:286). Reproduction is not confined to a physical procreative act. Rather, it is an extended, multivalent process that necessitates various kinds of physical, medical, cultural, and spiri- tual work, such as those practices using the rattle figurines explored here. Furthermore, the study of social reproduction allows us to Figure 9.

It is noteworthy that the scribe of the passage from the Florentine Codex metaphorically linked the production of a child to the pro- duction of pottery and gourd rattles and specifically with the drying aspect of that production that is crucial for the formation of both gourds and ceramics. The authors could have written about avoiding dryness or emptiness without referencing rattles; that they did is significant. The two references to rattles suggest an important link here. The Aztecs understood rattles, whether made of pottery or of gourds, to be empty, hollow, dry, and without blood, the essential life force. López Austin’s (1988:1: 168) work on the ideology of the human body corroborates the fact that this characteristic would have been undesirable in a baby. He writes (López Austin 1988:1:168) Figure 13. Front and side view of rattle figurine, showing suspension hole pierced laterally through neck, from the Phoebe A. Hearst Museum. The function of blood was to strengthen people and make them Drawing by Tom Quinn. live and grow by keeping the muscles moist.

Even after a suc- cessful birth, however, the child had not escaped all danger. Parents were advised that perhaps the lord of the nigh “will unclasp from you his precious necklace, his precious feather” (Sahagún 1950–1982:VI:182). Fear and danger of an offspring’s death extended past birth and into childhood. The Aztecs personified the danger to mother and child in the form of deities, both those who were dangerous, and those who assisted. Dangerous deities who might cause harm to children included the cihuateteo god- desses and Xolotl (McCafferty and McCafferty 1999:120; Millian 1981:83). Deities who were asked for assistance during childbirth included Xochiquetzal, Yoalticitl, and Cihuacoatl (McCafferty and McCafferty 1999:103; Sahagún 1950–1982:VI:Chapter 27).

The other kind of figurine commonly burnished is Brumfiel and Overholtzer 2009), and five rattle figurines exhibited at the Xaltocan site museum were analyzed. While, admittedly, this is a small sample, comparison with published archaeological and museum collections (Baer 1996; Kaplan 1958, 2006; Millian 1981; Parsons 1972) suggests that it is representative of Type I-A figurines, and it includes a number of complete artifacts that enable a full multisensory analysis. Ouzman (2001) and MacGregor (1999) have criticized an over- reliance in archaeology on the sense of sight for interpreting lived experience. Ouzman (2001:237) suggests that this over-reliance natu- rally follows from a culturally ingrained post-Enlightenment empha- sis in Western society on the visual aspect. Common sayings such as “seeing is believing,” “it is apparent that,” and “the evidence shows” demonstrate the prominence of sight in modern Western culture (2001:238). Ouzman argues for an archaeology that includes con- sideration of other senses, particularly hearing and touch. MacGregor (1999:263–264) likewise encourages an analysis of non- visual sensory perception, such as touch and smell. Rattle figurines exhibit several characteristics that demand a Figure 15.

Given the apotropaic use discussed earlier, the figurines’ multi- sensory attributes have intriguing implications for the use of rattles in Aztec society in childbirth. Needham (1967) first drew attention to the cross-cultural use of percussive instruments in shamanic prac- tices designed to communicate with or repel spirits, suggesting a link between percussion and transition or the passage from one status to another. Of the San’s use of percussive sound in shaman- ism, Ouzman (2001:242–244) writes, Repetitive percussive sound can induce a heightened state of reality. Feelings of general euphoria as well as...disassociation from one’s body can result from the combination of percussive sound with strenuous physical activity...Percussive sound acts as an analgesic by blocking or overriding pain.
