<plain_text><page sequence="1">A SEAL IMPRESSION FROM EL-QITAR/TIL-ABNU (SYRIA) By ALFONSO ARCHI The seal rolled on the six sides of the envelope containing a legal document found at el-Qitar (Pls. XXXV-XXXVI),' on the west bank of the Euphrates some 33 km. downstream from Tell Ahmar, has its best parallels in the imprints of the Hittite seals from Ugarit and Emar of the thirteenth century B.C. The scene is framed above and below by a border a guilloche. To the left is the Weather-god, standing on two triangles representing mountains, which do not seem to be marked with a scale pattern as in Yaz. 64.2 The god wears a beard and his hair falls in a long pigtail down his back to his waist. He is wearing a short kilt and probably a shirt which leaves his arms bare. On his head he wears a tiara with horns, and a curved sword hangs from his waist, with the tip pointing downward and with the usual half-moon pom- mel. In his right hand, raised behind his head, he brandishes an axe. Behind his back, beneath the pigtail, is a filling motif (cf. SBo II no. 229). His raised left arm reaches out in front, and on the fist rests the god's symbol: TONITRUS, L 199, to the right of which is a star. Extending downward from the fist (and TONITRUS, the symbol of thunder) are two streams of water (the gift which the Weather-god bestows on humanity) which spread outward from one another, forming a triangular space. Within this is a female divinity, perhaps Hepat, wearing a long dress and a tiara. She is CD Fig. 1. Seal impression from el-Qitar. tI thank T. L. McClellan director of the archaeological expedition at el-Qitar for having allowed me to study this seal impression, and Mr. H. Hammade of the National Museum of Aleppo, who made it possible for me to examine the original. Death pre- vented W. Culican from completing the study of this seal impression, a drawing of which he gave in Abr-Nahrain 22 (1983-84), 57 f. The impression has been re-drawn for me by L. Scardala.

Bittel et al., Yazilikaya' (WVDOG 61; Berlin 1941); Yazilikaya2 (Berlin 1975). 2In other seals, as well as in Yaz. 42, the Weather-god is standing on two deified mountains in anthropomorphic form, that is male human figures wearing skirts with scales, see Ugaritica III, 50 fig. 68; MDOG 118 (1986), 185 (seal from Lidar).</page><page sequence="2">ANATOLIAN STUDIES seated on a stool, one arm raised to her face, and the other arm outstretched towards a table in front of her on which there seems to be an offering.3 Behind the goddess is the sign L.152, a symbol of prosperity,4 and a star. To the right, the seal is crossed obliquely by a snake's body which tapers towards the bottom. The upper end terminates in a human head wearing a divine tiara, and the tail end curls upwards, over which there is a second symbol of the Weather-god, TONITRUS. From the centre portion of this snaky being emerges the upper part of an anthropomorphic figure with arms stretched out- ward. The sinuous lines forming the body of this being resemble the two rivulets of water flowing from the Weather-god's hand. This figure may well represent a river deity, probably the Euphrates since on its right bank lies el-Qitar. The symbol for thunder is there to recall the bond between the god who controls atmospheric phenomena and rivers. In Hurrian mythology, the Tigris, Aranzah, is the brother of the Weather-god.5 The interpretation of the figure emerging from the river, which is, however, part of it, is uncertain. Hypothetically, it may be thought that a tributary, probably the Balih, is represented, which is an important part of the ecosystem of the Middle Euphrates area. The Balih is deified already from the age of Ebla.6 Behind the river-god stands a male figure wearing a skull cap and a short skirt. A bow is slung over his left shoulder, held close to his side by the left hand. His right forearm is raised in front of him, his hand closed into a fist in the usual gesture expressing respect to a deity (or perhaps in the act of holding a shield; what appears behind the river-god's back is not clear).7 He is the tutelary god of animals and fields, dKAL, whose iconography, besides the bow, may also include a spear held in the hand not holding the bow, a small animal (a hare or a wild goat) placed in front of the god, or another animal sacred to him (a deer, a lion or a winged animal) on which the god is standing.8 In the central part of the seal there are some Hittite hieroglyphs aligned in two columns which start from the upper border; two other signs (of which one is barely visible) fill the lower right-hand corner. The asymmetrical signs of both columns are all (with one exception la, in the right column) dextroverse. Also in the imprint of the seal of a king of Carchemish found at Lidar the two columns show writing in the same direction.9 There is no reason not to follow the order given to the signs from column to column. 3In the relief of Fraktin, Hepat, seated in front of the table, lifts a cup with one hand and perhaps a loaf with the other. 4L.155, frequently pictured in the seals, should have the same meaning.

Alp (Ankara, 1992), 8 f. 7The homage of a deity to the Weather-god is pictured in various seals, cf. Ugaritica III, 24 no. 32, 41 no. 56, 51 no. 70. However, it cannot be excluded that some- times the owner of the seal may have been represented, cf. Laroche, Ugaritica III, 123 f. On this problem, cf. Archi, SMEA 14 (1971), 73 f. 8All of these elements are found in seal no. 22 published by Guterbock in: Bittel, et al., Bogazkoy V (Berlin 1975), 59 f.

' And in line 1 of the text it is said that the tablet was sealed by a priestess, NIN.DINGIR, of the Weather-god whose name has to be read: 'si-ip-pi-lu-um-se, which is a good correspondence for the name in hieroglyphic writing: zi-pi-lu-sa. Most of the personal names in the document are Hurrian, and for the first ele- ment of the priestess's name one can recall fZi-bi/be, 'Zi-be-e/i, well attested in Nuzi.12 The priestesses NIN.DINGIR were an authority in that period and area,'3 and that explains why this document was sealed by one of them. It is quite likely that the town from which the priestess Zippilu(m)sa is said to be, ti-la-pa-nu(-)td-pd+ra/i-i(a) URBS, is that, the remains of which make up the mound of el-Qitar. Now, the first part of the name, ti-la-pa-nu, can be analysed as Til-Abnu, that is "Stony hill", which fits el-Qitar very well. The excavators describe the character of this site in this way: "The mountain itself is about 6 hectares in size and rises 76 metres above the flood plain. Two distinct parts of the mountain are separated by a saddle; the northern half is a jagged rocky ridge that gives rise to the mountain's name, el-Qitar, 'the train'. This ridge is effectively insurmountable on its eastern face, and only slightly less so from its western slope ...."14 But URBS seems to determine both ti-la-pa-nu and ta-pa+ra/i-i(a), clearly two elements. A solution could be to take ta-pa+ra/i-i(a) as an Hittite word: taparija- "district", that is tapar-, "to rule, administrate" + the adjectival -ija-.'5 This possibility cannot be ruled out: with Mursili II, the Hittites came to control the Middle Euphrates Meskene/Emar. Despite this oddity, that an administra- tive denomination like that came to form a place name, I am unable to offer another suggestion. 'The sign nu has only 8 and not 9 dashes; la, as M. Poetto has pointed out to me, is clearly visible in the imprints on the smaller sides of the envelope. He identified also pd+ra/i. The signs sa- and ta were suggested to me by J. D. Hawkins, to whom I owe also a profitable discussion on this seal, including the correction of Snell's reading of the name of the NIN.DINGIR on line 1 of the tablet to Sippilumse.

Ashurnasirpal (Annals III 55, 63; ARAB I, ?? 474-75) receives the tribute of Habini, ruler of Til-Abna in Bit-Adini, at the time ruled by Ahuni: "Unto Bit-Adini I drew nigh .... The tribute of Ahuni of the land of Adini-silver, gold, lead, copper ... I received ... At that time the tribute of Habini of the city of Til-Abna--four minas of silver, and 400 sheep I received from him, and ten minas of silver I imposed upon him as a yearly tribute. From the land of Bit-Adini I departed" (ARAB I, ? 475).16 Also Shalmaneser received the tribute of Habini from the town of Til-Abna after having destroyed several towns of Bit-Adini (Monolith Inscription, 3R 7, I 35; ARAB I, ? 599). In a list of 27 towns "brought into submission" by Shamshi-Adad V (IR 29.49; ARAB I, ? 715), Til-Abna precedes Hindanu, a town on the west bank of the Euphrates. Now, el-Qitar is also on the west bank, about 33 kin. south of Tell Ahmar/Til Barsip on the east bank, the major centre of Bit-Adini, and 60 km. south of Carchemish.7 This localisation fits the epigraphic data well. The fact that a powerful state like Bit-Adini was rather close does not contradict this proposal, if Til-Abna was placed on the other bank of the Euphrates. But el- Qitar is only a fortress of the Late Bronze age. The old name could have come to indicate the area, while the Aramaic settlement was displaced elsewhere. '6See also the recent edition by A. K. Grayson, Assyrian Rulers of the early First Millennium BC, I (1114-859 B.C.), Toronto 1991, 216 f. '7Tell Hadidi/Azi is 12 km. to the south.
