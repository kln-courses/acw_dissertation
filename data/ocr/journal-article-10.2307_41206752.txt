<plain_text><page sequence="1">Telescopes and Microscopes W. V. HOUSTON three hundred years ago there was revived, among thoughtful people, the idea that man might be able to understand the material universe surrounding him if he would consent to look at it carefully. Once again he became interested in observing and describing things rather than merely pondering over them. It has often been said that the spread of this idea ended the reign of anthropomorphism in science. Yet the universe is still anthropocentric. Man is still its center, and the universe as he sees it is peculiarly a universe seen by man. From his vantage point on the earth he looks enormous dis- tances, through telescopes, to see tremendous heavenly bodies. They are only tremendous compared with the man who sees them. From his laboratory stool he looks through microscopes at objects of incomprehensible minuteness. The minuteness is with respect to the man who looks at them and seeks to compre- hend. Man is roughly in the middle of the scale between the very large and the very small, and perhaps it is the middle of the scale because man is there. During the last three centuries a wide variety of instruments and methods has been devised for "looking" at the universe in various ways, and the telescopes and microscopes for looking at it in the ordinary sense have been developed almost to their limits. The new 200-inch reflecting telescope, about to be erected on Mt. Palomar, represents the limit thus far attained in the construction of telescopes. That limit is largely deter- mined by the available financial resources, although the ever- present atmospheric unsteadiness is, and will continue to be, a serious obstacle. The limit of optical microscopes has been reached in the ultra-violet microscope, where the limit is set by the wave properties of the light itself. To go further we shall 63</page><page sequence="2">The American Scholar have to adopt quite different methods, and within the past few years a good start has been made on the design of electron microscopes to push, still further, the limit of smallness of those objects whose geometrical arrangement can be directly ob- served. Any microscope or telescope is often popularly known as a magnifying glass and the magnification produced by it is re- garded as the essential characteristic of the instrument. For a telescope whose principal function is the observation of near-by objects, including the sun, moon and the planets, this is correct. For the observation of distant stars, however, the magnification is of little importance. A star is effectively a luminous point, and remains a point no matter how much it is magnified. The pur- pose of building a large telescope is not to obtain high magnifica- tion, for a small telescope can magnify as much as a large one. The magnification depends on the curvature and the disposition of the lenses and mirrors and not on their diameters. A large telescope has two functions. The first is to provide as large a light-gathering power as possible and the second is to provide as large a resolving power - that is, as sharp an image, as possible. In order to see a star at all a certain minimum amount of light from the star must reach the eye of the observer. The light emitted travels in all directions and only an infinitesimal fraction is intercepted by the whole earth. When observing with the unaided eye, only the very small part that passes through the pupil of the eye is effective. The pupil is a small hole about one- fifth of an inch in diameter, and the number of stars whose light is so intense that they can be seen through this hole is only about 5000. The vast majority of stars cannot be seen at all in this way. To see them it is necessary to collect more of the light that they emit. A telescope with an objective lens four inches in diameter intercepts 400 times as much light as the pupil of the eye. When this light is concentrated by the objective lens and the eyepiece so as to pass into the eye of the observer the star is made effectively 400 times as bright as when seen unaided. 64</page><page sequence="3">Telescopes and Microscopes Since the 200-inch mirror will collect a million times as much light as the observer's unaided eye it will correspondingly in- crease the number of stars that can be seen. The amount of light collected can be indefinitely increased by making larger lenses and mirrors but this is an expensive and difficult process. We can also "see" fainter stars by increasing the sensitivity of the detecting instrument. The human eye is a remarkably sensitive detector of light of the proper wave- length but a certain minimum amount of light-energy per second is required to make an impression. The development of sensitive photographic plates has done away with the old style of observing, in which the astronomer actually looked at th√© stars. Modern astronomical work is almost exclusively the photography of the heavens. With a photographic plate it is possible to make use of all of the energy received at one point throughout a long period of time. In this way the effectiveness of a telescope can be increased many times. Astronomers often make exposures covering several nights, and all of the energy received from a particular star during that time goes into the formation of a single small spot. By the use of these two means, large telescopes and photographic plates, the effective bright- ness of stars has been increased almost a billion times. The other function of a large telescope is to produce smaller star images. When a telescope is regarded as a magnifying glass this seems paradoxical ; but when it is realized that the light available is definitely limited, it is clearly desirable to concen- trate it on as small as possible a spot on the photographic plate. If the image is large it is correspondingly less intense. The property of forming a small image of a very small source of light is also of great importance when observing the details of near-by objects. If the light from each point of a planet is spread out over a large region on the photographic plate the images of different points overlap and it is impossible to see the small details at all. This property (of permitting the separation of points close together on the object) is called the resolving power and is one of the most important characteristics of any 65</page><page sequence="4">The American Scholar optical system. High magnification without high resolving power is of practically no use, for the same reason that it is of little use to look at a newspaper half-tone with a microscope. The simplest method of describing the passage of light through an optical instrument is to regard it as traveling along a system of rays. The rays are lines that represent the paths of the light and indicate the directions in which it is traveling. The rays extend in all directions from a luminous object. Those that meet a lens or a curved mirror are changed in direction by re- fraction or reflection. The ray that strikes the center of a lens passes through it with negligible deflection. Those that strike near the edge of a convex lens are bent toward those that pass through the center. Ideally all of these rays, no matter where they strike the lens, pass through a single point called the focus. All of the light, from a small or distant source, that strikes the lens or mirror passes through this one point. If there is a photo- graphic plate at that point, all of the light contributes to black- ening it. The rays from each point of an extended source come to a focus at a different point, but it is only if these points are sharp that a well-defined image will be obtained. For various reasons the focus of an optical system is not a sharp point. There may be errors in the shape of the lens or mirror; or the design may be such as to give an approximate focus for light coming from widely different directions rather than an accurate focus for light from a single direction. These are instrumental aberrations and can be minimized by careful attention to design and construction. But there is another reason inherent in the nature of light itself. The description of the radiation of light in terms of rays is only approximately correct. For a precise prediction of its path it must be treated as a wave motion, with all the accompanying complications. This fact sets a limit to the precision with which light can be focussed at a point and constitutes a fundamental limit to the resolving power of an optical instrument. The numerical resolving power of a single lens or mirror for distant points is roughly equal to its diameter divided by the 66</page><page sequence="5">Telescopes and Microscopes wavelength of the light that is used. The average wavelength of visible light is about one fifty-thousandth of an inch, so that the maximum resolving power of a lens one inch in diameter is 50,000. This means that the diameter of the image spot formed by a distant star is at least one fifty-thousandth of the distance from the lens to the focus. If this distance is 12 inches, the spots will be twelve fifty-thousandths of an inch in diameter. This is the minimum size that could be attained with perfect optical work. If now one should attempt to increase the magni- fying power of a telescope with this objective lens by looking at the image with a very high-power eyepiece the image could be made to appear as large as desired. However, if the image were magnified 500 times, each of these spots would be one- eighth of an inch in diameter. The resulting image would consist of a series of overlapping spots, one-eighth of an inch in diameter, and all smaller details of the picture would be completely obliterated. The magnification would be of no use unless accompanied by a resolving power that is sufficiently large. The resolving power of the 200-inch mirror will be theoretically 200 times as great as that of a one-inch mirror or lens, and the star images, under perfect conditions, will be cor- respondingly smaller and more distinct. Just what will be revealed by the increased light-gathering power of the newest and largest telescope is of particular interest to those who try to contemplate the universe as a whole. Within relatively recent years it has been found that stars are not uni- formly distributed through space but are grouped in clusters or galaxies. The galaxy of which our sun is a member includes the stars visible to the unaided eye, those comprising the Milky Way and many others. But far beyond the limits of this galaxy are other "island universes" similar to this one. Does this splatter of galaxies extend indefinitely or is there an end to it? No definite evidence of anything but a limitless extent has been obtained, but at least the new telescope will be able to reach much farther than ever before toward any limit there may be. In the design of a microscope the resolving power is the 67</page><page sequence="6">The American Scholar paramount consideration. A microscope is distinguished from a telescope by the fact that it is intended for viewing objects that can be placed close to it. A telescope may produce an image that looks larger than the object because it is closer, but the image produced by a microscope really is larger than the object itself. Because the objective lens of a microscope can be placed close to the object the lens need not be made large in order to intercept a major fraction of the available light. A lens prac- tically in contact with an object receives almost one-half of the light emitted by it. The only way to increase the amount re- ceived is to increase the amount emitted. Since most objects viewed with a microscope are not self-luminous they must be illuminated from an outside source of light. Consequently the light received in the microscope is merely that scattered by the object. A small object will scatter only a small amount of light, which must be spread over a very much enlarged image. There- fore the proper illumination of an object is a matter of much importance. Magnification alone, in a microscope, is not difficult to obtain. The objective lens forms an enlarged image of the object in the microscope tube. This may be as much as a hundred times enlarged over the original object. If desired, another lens could be used in the same way as the first and the second image would have ten thousand times the linear dimensions of the object. Such a process could be kept up indefinitely, but the difficulty arises in obtaining sufficient resolving power. There are numerous reasons why it is difficult to reach the ideally attainable resolving power in an optical instrument. One of these is the chromatic aberration of the lenses. Since the light of different colors is refracted differently by trans- parent materials a single lens has a different focus for each color of light. An image formed by such a lens will not be a single image but a series of images, one for each color. These will be at different places and of different sizes, and hence only approximately superposed. This can easily be observed by using a thick, convex spectacle lens, or a reading glass, to form an 68</page><page sequence="7">Telescopes and Microscopes image of a distant white light on a piece of white paper. Such an image will have colored edges that are not too sharp. This defect can be minimized by the use of systems of lenses of dif- ferent kinds of glass. Chromatic aberration is entirely absent from mirrors - an important advantage of reflecting telescopes over those using lenses. It has not yet been possible, however, to construct a reflection microscope. Another source of aberration is to be found in the shapes of the lenses. It is very difficult to polish lenses with other than spherical surfaces, and these are not ideal. That such is the case can be observed by testing the action of a simple reading glass. When a word is viewed through the center of the lens it can be seen quite clearly; but if the glass is so held as to give high magnification, words seen through the edge of it are indistinct and much distorted. In fact it is very difficult to find theoret- ically a shape of surface that gives good definition over a large field of view. However, this again can be approximated by the use of combinations of lenses. After the best has been done in eliminating chromatic and spherical aberration there still remains the limit set on the resolving power of lenses by the nature of the light itself. It is impossible to distinguish points on the object if they are closer together than about half the wavelength of the light used. With visible light this means about one-hundred-thousandth of an inch. If an object is viewed with a magnification of two thou- sand diameters, nothing smaller than one-fiftieth of an inch in the image will have any significance. Since all points and lines will be indefinite to this extent, higher magnification is useless. In the effort to overcome this difficulty, microscopes have been built to use ultra-violet light. With its shorter wavelength the resolving power is correspondingly increased. This is only a small advantage, however, since the shortest wavelength of light that is not absorbed by air is only a little less than half the wavelength of visible light. This merely doubles the resolving power or cuts in half the size of the smallest structures that can be distinguished. 69</page><page sequence="8">The American Scholar Although the wavelength of light determines the smallest sizes of particles whose structure can be recognized it does not limit the size of those whose presence can be detected by a microscope. A particle whose diameter is much less than the wavelength of light will scatter some light into a microscope. The image produced by this will be a very small disk whose size has nothing to do with the size of the object but will be deter- mined solely by the resolving power of the microscope. A rough measure of the size is given by the brightness since a large par- ticle will scatter more light than a small one. When a micro- scope is used merely to detect the presence of particles by the light they scatter it is known as an ultra-microscope. A very intense beam of light is directed on a suspension of small par- ticles in such a way that none of the direct light enters the objective lens. By means of the light scattered into the instru- ment by the particles it is possible to count them and to make very crude estimates as to their sizes. The ultra-microscope and the ultra-violet microscope repre- sent the limits to which ordinary microscopy can be pushed. The limit is set not by the skill of the designer or operator but by the nature of light itself. To study the structure of still smaller objects it is necessary to make use of radically different methods. It would, of course, be desirable to use light of still shorter wavelengths, such as X-rays in a microscope. They can easily be obtained with wavelengths a thousand or ten thousand times smaller than those of visible light, but no very satisfactory means has yet been devised for focussing them. If such means can be found an X-ray microscope would permit the examina- tion of structures of molecular dimensions. Within the past ten years considerable progress has been made, particularly in Germany, in the development of electron microscopes. In a vacuum, electrons travel in straight lines except when influenced by electric or magnetic fields, and these fields can be arranged to act as lenses. In one type of instrument the electrons are emitted by a hot filament, as in a radio tube. They are then speeded up and focussed by a magnet on the 70</page><page sequence="9">Telescopes and Microscopes object to be studied. This constitutes a system of illumination with a beam of electrons instead of a beam of light. The object to be studied is placed on a very thin film of collodion - in the vacuum, of course. When the film is thin enough most of the electrons go through it without appreciable scattering or slow- ing down, but an object on the film scatters, out of the beam, a certain part of the electrons. Since the number removed is proportional to the mass of the material along the electron path, a shadow of the object is impressed on the beam. Another magnet, corresponding to the objective lens of a microscope, focusses the electrons into an enlarged shadow-picture of the object. This picture is enlarged again and projected onto a photographic plate. The enlarging process could be repeated as often as desired but, as in optical instruments, the difficulty is not in the magnification but in the resolving power. The instrumental limitations on the resolving powej are called aberrations, in analogy with the spherical and chromatic aberrations of ordinary glass lenses. The electric and magnetic fields that speed up and focus the electrons must be so arranged that all of the electrons are brought to the proper focus. Present- day instruments can do this for only a very narrow beam of electrons, but it is to be expected that extensive improvements will be made in the near future. The fundamental limitations on the resolving power of an electron microscope are at present entirely negligible. They will be of importance when distances to be considered are so small that the electrons can no longer be treated as charged particles of negligible dimensions, but must be treated, by means of quantum mechanics, as waves. Here again half of the wave- length can be regarded as the limit of the resolving power, but the wavelength of a fast electron is very small. The wavelength is inversely proportional to the velocity and can be reduced by increasing the electron speed. The wavelength of an electron whose velocity has been produced by forty thousand volts is about one four-billionth of an inch, a length much less than the diameter of an atom. Such a limit is clearly of no consequence 71</page><page sequence="10">The American Scholar at the present time. The limitations due to imperfections in the electric and magnetic lenses are those yet to be overcome; but they have already been reduced to such an extent that mag- nifications of fifty thousand diameters can be effectively used, and recently photographs that show the outlines of large pro- tein molecules have been published. One of the central problems in all microscopy is the interpre- tation of the image. One sees a certain distribution of light and shadow, or of different colors, and must try to infer from it the nature of the original object. With an optical microscope the differences in appearance are due to differences in the extent to which different materials scatter or reflect the light. In many biological objects these differences are very small and a whole cell may look like a drop of water. In some cases the structure can be brought out by staining with dyes of various kinds. The dyes are absorbed differently in different parts of the cell, and the structure that becomes visible is essentially the distribution of the property of absorbing the dye. In the case of an electron miscroscope, as described above, the image is essentially a shadow picture. Electrons are scattered clear out of the beam by the object and the fraction of them removed is proportional to the amount of mass in the electron path. Hence it is only differences in density that can be observed. Differences in chemical composition, unless accompanied by differences in density, will not produce shadows. To make the structure of biological objects visible in an electron microscope it may be possible to use salts of heavy elements as stains. If salts of barium, for example, are differently absorbed by different parts of a cell, the electron microscope will show up the dis- tribution of the barium because of its mass. Such things still remain to be investigated. In addition to the examination of very thin objects trans- parent to electrons, other applications can be made of electron microscopes. They can be used for the examination of substances that emit electrons and that therefore correspond to optically luminous objects. Such an object is a very hot piece of metal. 72</page><page sequence="11">Telescopes and Microscopes The electron microscope makes it possible to form an image of the electron emissivity of the metal and to see from just what points the electrons emerge. Some attempts have also been made to form images by means of: electrons scattered or reflected from opaque objects, just as light is scattered from an ordinary object into a microscope. This, however, introduces difficulties into the focussing since the electrons tend to be scattered with changed velocities. The electron microscope is still in its infancy and little can be said with certainty as to its future usefulness. Nevertheless it appears to be a means of overcoming the obstacle set by the wave nature of light, and as such it opens another unexplored region of the universe. 73</page></plain_text>
