<plain_text><page sequence="1">3 INTERCULTURAL/MERCANTILE CONTACTS BETWEEN THE ARABIAN GULF AND SOUTH ASIA AT THE CLOSE OF THE THIRD MILLENNIUM B.C. Dr. E.C.L. During Caspers One of the most interesting developments in Middle Asian Archaeology in recent years has been the emergence of an even clearer pattern of intercultural links and trading exchanges over a very wide area in the late third and early second millennium B.C. We should begin by defining this area. It ranges from South Turkmenia and the ancient deltaic basin of the Murghab, also called the lower Murghab, and in ancient times known as Magiana; Uzbekistan, now part of the Soviet Union; and the oases of northwest Afghanistan (Dawlatabad, Farukabad and Dashly) , in ancient times known as Bactria; central Baluchistan; southern Pakistani and Iranian Baluchistan; the Indus Valley Civilization; Iran; the Arabian Gulf areas, viz. Bahrain, parts of coastal Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Oman; and ancient Mesopotamia. My aim is to select certain material goods which give irrefutaole evidence of these contacts. Also among these goods were raw materials such as lapis lazuli, agate and carnelian, turquoise, gold, silver and ivory. Besides this, we may also postulate a trade in more perishable substances such as foodstuffs, fabrics, timber and finished wood products. These latter articles have left no trace, so we are not in a position to prove that they actually did exist in a basically non-recorded trade economy. We should now examine some of the sites more closely. Since 1969, the Afghan-Soviet archaeological missions, in which Prof. Viktor Sarianidi has played a prominent role, have concentrated on the three oases of northwest Afghanistan, viz. Dawlatabad, Farukabad and Dashly. More than 70 sites have been recorded in these localities. Over a hundred graves in the Dashly Oasis have been excavated, and more than seven hundred graves have been excavated at Dharkutan in southern Uzbekistan (1). Some of these graves have been cut into the habitation deposits, but more frequently they have been encountered in the ruins of abandoned sites and, most commonly, they are located in cemeteries proper. Besides single, double and multiple burials, there are also cenotaphs. The graves themselves were dug directly into the soil and consist of a sort of funeral chamber at the end of a relatively deep shaft. This chamber is either placed directly at the bottom of ehe shaft or is extended from one of its sides. Frequently bricks were placed on top of the grave (2). thpiZ-'Vf11181!^8 deceased were lying in a flexed position, either on -Й h 9ΐ °r S ' bUt S8ldOm in a prone or suPine Position; furnished ;heir ^ds.w^re h with turne^ toward the north. The graves were richly furnished with pottery -- sometimes as many as a score of items richly have</page><page sequence="2">4 been recorded in one grave. Furthermore, such artefacts as copper needles and pins with richly decorated heads, cosmetics flasks of copper or pottery, steatite flacons, copper bracelets, copper blades, gold, silver and copper/bronze vases, stone beads, copper and stone stamp seals and cylinder seals have also been discovered in large numbers ( 3 ) . Architectural similarities, the funerary rites performed in connection with the graves as judged by the presence of food offerings, the occasional interment of rams in separate graves also provided with offerings, and the objects buried with the rams and with the dead themselves, suggest a clear cultural identity between the lower Murghab region of southeastern Turkmenia called Margiana, and the valley of the Surkhan-Daria River in south Uzbekistan (the sites Sapalli, Dharkutan and Mullali) and northwest Afghanistan, the latter two known as Bactria ( 4 ) . Regular Soviet excavations in the lower Murghab region, the territory of ancient Margiana, have taken place as early as 1972 with the expeditions to Auchin-tepe and Takhirbay . In 1974, excavations started in the oases of Gonur and Togolok. Gonur I is the largest site of ancient Margiana, while another settlement-cum-ternple complex lies in the oasis of Togolok. Excavations continued in 1977 and 1984-1986 (5). More to the north lie the sites of the Kelleli oasis with Taip-tepe south of the latter (6). However, the number of scientifically excavated graves in Bactria falls far short of the presumably many thousands of graves illicitly opened and subsequently plundered by local Afghan farmers since 1974. Particularly extensive grave robbery has taken place in the neighborhood of the villages of Akcha , Farukabad , Dawlatabad and Nikcha in the province of Balkh. Many of the Bactrian graves are located almost directly below the surface, a fact which, according to Kohl and Pottier, not only explains why so many thousands have been illicitly opened and plundered, but also why so many seem to contain incomplete or secondarily deposited skeletons (7). The Soviet archaeologists still adhere to the Soviet uncalibrated C-14 dates of the mid-second millennium B.C., which are too low. However, if one assembles all the dates reported in the Soviet literature, adjusts them to the 5730 half line, and applies the correction factors advocated by the MASCA Laboratories in Philadelphia, a fairly consistent sequence of nearly fifty dates is obtained which pushes the Central Asian sequence back to a date even slightly earlier than Western archaeologists have so far favoured (8). These available corrected radiocarbon determinations and stylistic parallels to historically "secure" sequences, in Kohl's view suggest the initial expansion of Central Asian settlements into the lower Murghab, viz. Margiana, and onto the norhtern and southern Bactrian Plain, viz. southern Uzbekistan and northwest Afghanistan, during the second half of the third millennium B.C., and which will have continued, particularly the development of this culture in southern Bactria, throughout the first half of the second millennium B.C. (9). The extensive grave robbery has meant that innumerable funerary objects have subsequently flooded the markets of the antique dealers in Kabul and from there have found their way into museums and private collections in Europe and the United States, where they have already become the subject of articles and museum catalogues. Then, at the Sixth International Conference of the Association of South Asian Archaeologists in Western Europe in 1981, M. Santoni reported on some</page><page sequence="3">5 recent discoveries in the southern sector of the large prehistoric site of Mehrgarh in the northern part of the Kachi Plain of central Baluchistan, Pakistan (10). There, south of the fourth and third millennium B.C. mound, lay a badly eroded cemetery which included graves containing flexed skeletons, cenotaphs and simple deposits, chronologically assigned to Mehrgarh Period VIII, viz. the late third- early second millennium B.C. This funerary area yielded abundant material presenting obvious parallels with cultural complexes of eastern Iran, viz. the still enigmatic site of Shahdad (11) on the edge of the Dasht-i Lut; northwest Afghanistan, viz. the Dashly Oasis (12); southern Uzbekistan, viz. Sapalli Tepe (13); and the lower Murghab region, formerly Margiana (14). A settlement near Mehrgarh called Sibri contained a cultural horizon similar to Mehrgarh Period VIII (15), as does a new site called Dauda Damb a few kilometers northeast of Sibri, the surface of which is littered with shards in the Mehrgarh VIII style. Once again, both sites show a strong Murghabo-Bactrian character ( 16 ) . At the Eighth International Conference of South Asian Archae- ologists at Moesgaard, Denmark in 1985, J.-F. Jarrige and M. Usman Hassan (17) made the first announcement of the exceptional chance discoveries of two clusters of antiquities at Quetta, northwest of Mehrgarh in central Baluchistan. One of these two clusters was associated with a human burial and, on the basis of the associated artefacts, was dated to the Mehrgarh VIII Period. The other was a deposit not far from the first grave. This has since become known as the Quetta hoard because of its unique assortment of typical Murghabo- Bactrian objects including, for example, round copper/bronze discs like mirrors without handles, one of the three types of mirror known from Bactria, and a gold goblet decorated with four embossed lions set between two relief uands and with a double-grooved, twisted, rope-like band in the lower register, to which reference will be made later on. This Quetta hoard, from which I have selected two items because of their relevance to the Arabian Gulf material which forms the nub of this paper, illustrates yet again the existence of strong cultural ties and exchange of luxury goods with the Murghab delta, viz. Margiana and the Bactrian territories of northwest Afghanistan, and southern Uzbekistan, towards the close of the third millennium B.C. Here it should be stressed that Kohl and Pottier have pointed to the fact that Jarrige favours an early relative correlation of the Mehrgarh and Sibri data with the Murghabo-Bactrian sequence, linking these materials specifically to remains from the Kelleli Oasis in Margiana and to the earliest known Bronze Age remains in southern Uzbekistan from Sapalli Tepe (18). Evidence for direct cultural and mercantile contacts between the Bactrian-Margiana region and the Indus Valley Plains has also been amply demonstrated in recent research by H . -M . Pottier, who has assembled available archaeological evidence hitherto left unnoticed (19). In a forthcoming publication, I will demonstrate the extistence of still other archaeological items coming from the main Indus cities, which equally show contacts with the Bactrian-Margiana culture, thereby enlarging the archaeological evidence now available (20). The theme of this paper is to discuss a few very distinctive pottery types and metal vessels from central Baluchistan, southern Pakistani and Iranian Baluchistan, and the Arabian Gulf regions, which will then be compared with similar types and objects encountered in the Bactrian-Margiana region.</page><page sequence="4">6 Among the Murghabo-ßactrian material from the South Cemetery at Mehrgarh VIII are pedestalled goblets with a distinct joint between the upper bowl section and the splayed f oot ; they are said to have been decorated with red paint (21) (Plate la). With their character- istic plastic ridge at the junction of the bowl section and the splayed foot, the goblets have close counterparts in, for instance, Dashly 1 &amp; 3 in northwest Afghanistan ( 22 ) , and the Margiana settlements (23) where they can be dated towards the end of the third millennium B.C. Furthermore, similarly shaped pottery goblets have been encountered in Bahrain (24), Saudi Arabia (25) and the Oman Peninsula (26). An initial reference to the correlation between the goblets from Mehrgarh VIII and those from Bahrain can be found in my paper "Some Remarks on Oman", published in the Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies, Vol. 19, 1989 (pp. 19-20). In Bactria and Margiana, the cup section of these pedestalled goblets shows a great variety of profiles ranging from a slender version like the ones from Mehrgarh VIII to distinctly globular (Plate lb-c-d). One variety shows a straight-walled profile, and there are also examples showing pronounced concave walls (27) (Plate 2). As we will demonstrate, the latter type has, so far, not been reported from Bahrain, Saudi Arabia or the Oman Peninsula, but the Khurãb cemetery in the Bampur Basin, which I will discuss later, does furnish such a straight-walled goblet, made of red pottery (28) (Plate 3a). Since it is our aim to test the validity of archaeological evidence for cultural/mercantile contacts, we will first view the goblets found in three variously located groups of tumuli on Bahrain against the recently published excavations at Mehrgarh in central Baluchistan, Pakistan. The first item to be considered is the upper part of a 9.1 cm. high wheel-thrown, brick-red coloured rimless goblet which must originally have stood on a splayed pedestalled foot. It was discovered in the Hamala North tumulus (29). Tha cup of this goblet is decorated with a row of five cross-hatched butterfly motifs, interspersed once only by a tree or vegetation design, also painted in plum-red (Plate 3b). This goblet can be dated by associated finds to the late third millennium B.C., viz. an omega- shaped pin(?) or hold-fast, a type also discovered by Bent and Prideaux in mounds at fAli (Mound В and J)(30), and with parallels in Akkadian and Ur III graves in Mesopotamia and at Susa in a comparable chronological context (31). This late third millennium B.C. corresponds neatly with a ca. 2000 B.C. date proposed for the Mehgarh VIII Cemetery. In connection with our efforts to establish evidence for the trade network, it must be mentioned here that the Hamala North tumulus has also furnished a tiny copper/bronze horned animal, probably a goat, measuring 2 cm. high, possibly once part of a pin (32) (Plate 3c). Recently I have proposed treating this tiny bronze as a possible Harappan import (33), but in the course of our survey of the pedestalled goblets it may emerge that a Murghabo-Bactrian provenance would be equally feasible. Secondly, three red-slipped, glossy pedestalled goblets have also been discovered in the course of the rescue dig near 'Ali on Bahrain, mounted by the Danish Expedition between 1961 and 1962 (34) (Plats 3d). All three goblets show the characteristic thickened plastic ridgs at the junction of the cup and the splayed steal, and two of them are decorated with cross-hatched, upturned triangles in</page><page sequence="5">7 black with single rows of horizontal dashes between them. The third appears to have been left undecorated. Thirdly, three more pedestalled goblets have recently been found by the Arab Expedition at Sãr el-Jisr (Plate 4a), all three discovered in Type 1 mounds characterized by a single burial ( 35 ) . These burials are built above the surface of the ground, with a ringwall and containing a burial chamber with one or two alcoves. Two of these goblets were found in the same mound (S-1D0). The third example was found singly (S-54). One of the two goblets from tumulus S-100 has been described as being of dark grey-black ware with glossy burnishing and turned on a wheel (36). It has an elongated cup and a thickened plastic ridge at the junction between the cup and the hollow splayed concave foot. In fact, it is a close counterpart of the red burnished goblet from iMehrgarh Cemetery VIII in central Baluchistan, Pakistan (Plate la). The other two goblets from Sãr el-Jisr are said to be of the red ware type of the three fAli examples. The smaller of the two, from the same burial S-100 as the unpainted grey-black burnished goblet, shows a fairly broad zone of criss-cross hatching or a net-like design executed in black paint under the outer rim. The shorter, less splayed foot is only partly hollow. The larger goblet from tumulus S-54 shows a herring-bone pattern in between two parallel lines executed in black, below an indistinctly painted row of fishes (Plate 4a). Although in both of these cases the diagnostic plastic ridge at the junction of cup and stem is absent and, in addition, the goblet from S-54 has a completely solid, low foot, the fact that both are manufactured in fine red clay and also resemble the other goblets under discussion in general appearance, warrants their inclusion in this easily distinguishable group of Bahrain burial pottery. Fourthly, fragments of very fine reddish slipped stemmed goblets decorated under the rim with a zone either of stylized caprids or of gazelles, painted in black on a whitish background, were discovered in the levels 19, 17 and 15 of City II at the Qala'at al-Bahrain (Northwall sequence? )( 37 ). These levels date to the late Akkadian, Ur III and Isin-Larsa periods (ca. 2200-1600 B.C.). Since these pedestalled cups appear to match those from Hamala North, fAli and Sãr el-Jisr, this could be an important step towards a chronological correlation between City II of the Qala'at al-Bahrain and a certain group of grave mounds. In the fifth instance, we are presented with the possible presence of pedestalled goblets in one of the Suq-Sunaysl graves in Oman, dated to about 2000 B.C. (38). These would provide a chrono- logical link with the Bahrain goblets on the one hand, and with a small chlorite flask of Murghabo-Bactrian origin from Tomb A at Hili North (U.A.E.) on the other (Plate 4b), since the assemblage of Tomb A at Hili North indicates g rather safe chronological mark, viz. the 21st, or at the earliest the late 22nd, century B.C. (39). The next find to be considered, representing a sixth example, is a small group of pedestalled goblets with a distinct joint between the upper bowl section and the splayed foot, decorated with a simple painted pattern of vertical and horizontal lines, which were discovered in the Dhahran tumuli of Saudi Arabia (40) (Plate 4c). These afford another chronological check. Zarins correlates this moundfiald with the City II occupation on Bahrain, which would place the date of these goblets towards the closing stages of the third</page><page sequence="6">8 millennium B.C. Furthermore, the close parallels with the pedestalled goblets from the iMehrgarh VIII Cemetery and from Bactria and Margiana almost certainly point to a Central Asian connection for this type of ware, although a local production of the painted goblet variety from Saudi Arabia, from the tumuli at Hamala North, 'Ali and Sar el-Jisr on Bahrain, and in City II of the gala 'at al-Bahrain, and the ones from Oman, cannot be ruled out. Having reviewed finds of pottery goblets, I now wish to discuss discoveries of the same type of object in metal. An 18 cm. high rimless copper/bronze goblet on a short, hollow cylindrical stem with a splayed foot and a concave base was also discovered in the tumulus at Hamala North on Bahrain (41) (Plate 4d). It had been carefully positioned with some stones at its base, possibly to prevent it tipping over. This suggests that it once contained some sort of liquid, perhaps beer or wine, both known from the ancient Near Eastern ":exts. Unfortunately, the goblet is too corroded to permit analysis of the inner surface. This goblet has so far remained the only published one from the Arabian Gulf area, and there has been no more than a suggestion that metal goblets either preceded those made of pottery or else that both varieties were contemporaneous (42). On the other hand, large collections of copper/bronze -- and, to a far lesser extent, of gold and silver -- goblets and vases of different shapes, displaying high artistic competence, are known to have come from the plundered graves in Bactria. Among the gold vessels from the Fullol hoard in the Badekhshan region of northeastern Afghanistan is the 'iowl of a pedestalled gold goblet, of which the lower part of the ctem is missing (43) (Plate 5a). However, a distinctive thickened ridge at the junction of the cup with the beginning of the stem is clearly visible. The decoration consists of an embossed geometric pattern. A similarly shaped pedestalled goblet, alço in gold and pertaining to the Quetta deposit or "hoard" (44) (Plate 5b), also shows α pronounced chickened embossed ridge between the bowl and the stem, and its shape closely resembles the pedestalled plain ceramic goblets from Mehrgarh, Period VIII. The copper/bronze goblet from Hamala North has no thickened ridge, but this is also the case of the two painted pedestalled goblets from the Sãr el-Jisr moundfield. The painted cup section of the goblet from the Hamala North tumulus is broken off just above the point where one would expect to find a distinctive joint, had there been one, and similarly the goblet fragments from the City II levels at the Gala 'at al-Bahrain do not afford a reliable reconstruction either . Conversely, the painted pottery goblets from 'Ali and from Dhahran do have this distinct ridge. Although the absence of this feature on the goblet from Hamala North may ba indicative of a local initiative taken in production, considered in conjunction with the painted decoration on some of the Arabian Gulf goblets, which is definitely non-iMurghabo-Bac trian , both ths Murghab delta region and Bac:ria also show in their pedestalled goblet potteries various types which Co not have this distinct ridge under their cup section. The emergence of evidence of α local copper production on Bahrain would demolish the argument that we can consider the copper/ bronze goblet only as a direct import piece and, in the absence of any metal analysis tests we can, for the moment, only surmise that either a Murghabo-Eactrian prototype may have been used in the local production of this copper/bronze pedestalled goblet from the Hamala North grave: mound or that we are, indeed, dealing with an actual import, since</page><page sequence="7">9 another copper/bronze goblet, said by C.S. Phillips to look identical to the one from Bahrain, was found in the Emirate of Ras al-Khaimah together with a typical Bactrian weapon. It would be beyond the scope of this short paper to consider other additional evidence of a possible contact between the Arabian Gulf and the Bactria-Margiana cultural sphere of influence having resulted in local imitations in the Gulf area. These will be discussed in a forthcoming contribution to the N.G. Majumdar Commemo- ration Volume, to be published in India (45). Although we are confronted with clear evidence of Bactrian contacts in the Oman Peninsula, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, this does not mean that we can point to any of these areas in particular as having been instrumental in their production. An intricate network of mercantile interaction connecting the Arabian Gulf and South Asia may be held responsible and may have resulted in equally intricate cultural intercourse. One example is the typical Umm an-Nar "black- on-grey ware" canister jars encountered in Umm an-Nar tombs, in Hili Grave 1059 and in Graves M at Hili, A in Hili. North, in the United Arab Emirates (46) (Plates 5c &amp; d, 6a &amp; b) and at 'Amlah in Oman (47). These canister jars provide a correlation with pottery from south- eastern Iran where both the shape and the mode of decoration occur in the burnished black-on-grey ware of the Bampur V,2 and VI Periods (48). De Cardi has noted strong Kulli-Mehi traits in this later Bampur material and the characteristic Kulli-Mehi canister-type pottery could well have been the prototype of the black-on-grey canister jars of the Bampur V and VI Periods. Recent ceramic analysis of some of the Umm an-Nar black-on-grey ware (Umm an-Nar island, Baat, Maysar and Hili 6) has led R. bright to consider this pottery ware as a variant of the Indo-Iranian Emir Grey, and a southeastern Iranian origin for the Umm an-Nar black-on-grey pottery has, therefore, been suggested (49). Nevertheless, the Arabian Gulf may have been under the direct influence of the Kulli-Mehi culture of southern Baluchistan, since the latter shows an unmistakable Murghabo-Bactrian element amidst its otherwise local Baluchistan tradition, hence the occurrence of Murghabo-Bactrian products and/or concepts in the Gulf. Although the published data from both Pakistani Baluchistan, viz. the Kulli-Mehi sites and the cemetery of Shahi Tump and from the Bampur Valley, such as the Khurãb cemetery and Fanuch, are totally incomplete and inadequately published, Kohl and Potter emphasize (50) that, contrary to the theory of the possible arrival of Central Asian peoples at Mehrgarh, Sibri, Quetta and now also at Dauda Damb and possibly other sites in the Kachi Plain of central Baluchistan, the supposition of a large-scale movement of Central Asian peoples into the Bampur Valley or Pakistani Baluchistan cannot be supported by the present archaeological evidence. They suggest the Murghabo-Bactrian materials, to which we will turn shortly, might be more economically explained as resulting from contacts, possibly established during annual migratory cycles , with new peoples now living immediately to the north in central Baluchistan and on the edge of the Dashti-Lut. The continuity of materials in the local tradition manifested both at the Bampur sites and in southern Baluchiscan certainly lends weight to their suggestion. But it still remains to be seen whether Pakistani Baluchistan or the Bampur Valley region did indeed afford an easy corridor for the cultural and economic contacts with the Arabian Gulf. Therefore, we should take a closer look at the finds from these two areas. The</page><page sequence="8">ΙΟ limited scope of this paper has made me decide, however, not to include the cemetery of Shahi Tump since the Murghabo-Bactrian objects discovered by Sir Aurel Stein are, on a whole, of a different nature than those found at Mehi and at Khurãb, Dãmin and Fanuch in the Bampur Valley area. We will, therefore, concentrate on the first two sites. The funerary deposits II and III at Mehi, on which Sir Aurel Stein has reported (51), consisted either of simple cremation remains or of ashes and remains of bones from completely cremated bodies in cinerary urns (52), a custom not comparable to the Murghabo-Bactrian practice of placing the body in a shallow pit in a flexed position. They were, however, accompanied by several objects of Bactrian provenance. It would be tempting to explain these recorded data as burials of persons of Bactrian descent wno had to comply with a non-Bactrian , perhaps local, practice of cremation. A copper/bronze mirror with an anthropomorpnic handle from Mehi burial deposit II ( 2 . 1 . a . ) ( 53 ) ( Plate 6c &amp; d) is the only example of its kind so far found outside its homeland Bactria (Plate 7a &amp; b), and therefore places the anthropomorphic bronze handle of a mirror, in the shape of a small naked male figurine, very much in the ancient Sumerian tradition, from the Barbar Temple IIA on Bahrain, in its proper perspective (54) (Plate 7c &amp; d). It stands on a curved base, the foot of which has two rivet holes and a slot, and points to a cultural interplay between Mesopotamia, the Dilmun culture of Bahrain, the Kulli-Mehi culture of southern Baluchistan, and the Murghabo- Bactrian cultural environment. However, it is a misconceived copy, for the functional artistry of the copper/bronze mirrors from Mehi and the Bactrian graves, which have a handle representing a stylized female figure, is entirely lacking in the one from Bahrain. In the case of the mirrors from Mehi and Bactria, the head of the stylized figure is provided only by the reflection of the face of the user in the mirror, but the Barbar figurine has to be turned upside down in order to use the mirror properly. From the same burial deposit as the large copper mirror with a handle inthe shape of a stylized figure, arms akimbo, comes a copper pin with a large, neatly worked head in the shape of a stamp seal (Mehi II .2 .2 .a. )( 55 )( Plate 6c &amp; d), a type often encountered in Bactria, viz. southern Uzbekistan, at the sites Sapalli Tepe and Mullali (56). This type of pin also occurs, for instance, at the cemetery of Dãmin (57), whereas a bird-headed, single- and double- looped and button-headed pins coma from cenotaphs at Mehrgarh VIII (53), the latter two also of Murghabo-Bactrian origin. A single- looped pin was also discovered at Kulli (Kul. 1 . 1 .8 .2 ) ( 59 ) . A second copper pin with a head formed by a lapis lazuli bead was discovered in Mehi burial deposit III ( . 6 . 9 ) ( 60 ) ( Plate 6c &amp; d). The lapis lazuli head of this pin points to a Bactrian source of inspiration, if not to a Bactrian origin. Another important discovery in burial deposit III (6.18) was a stamp seal thought by Stein to have been carved of bone (61) (Plate 8a). This bone (or perhaps alabaster?) stamp seal is of particular interest because it is of a type known from the Bactrian-Margiana cultural complex, being almost identical to a series of stamp seals in the shape of a star or a flower and made of stone and alabaster (62) (Plate 8b). The burial deposit III (.6) at Mehi has also produced a large unpainted red goblet with a wide, shallow open cup section with rounded sides and a high, widely splayed foot, as well as a triple set of truncated conical bowls with clipped and indented rims (Mehi III</page><page sequence="9">11 .6.13 &amp; Mehi III .6.2 &amp; 3)(63)(Plate 8c &amp; d; Plate 9). They have extremely close, almost identical parallels in Margiana, for example at the Kelleli Oasis, at Gonur-tepe 1 and Togolok-tepe 1,21,24, and in Bactria, for instance at Sapalli-tepe and at Dashly 1 &amp; 3 (64), where both types come in a great variety of shapes and sizes and with various profiles and rim details (Plate 2c &amp; d; Plate 8c &amp; d; Plate 9a) . At this point we have to turn our attention to the Bampur Valley, to the cemetery at Khurãb, which has already been mentioned in connection with our discussion of the pedestalled goblets from the Arabian Gulf. The burial custom at Khurãb differs from the cremation practice prevailing at Mehi and shows instead what looks like fractional or secondary burials. The üurial L.i at Khurab, which has furnished the straight-walled pedestalled goblet already referred to (L.i 278)(Plate 3a), also contained a close counterpart of the chalice cup on a high, widely splayed foot discovered at Mehi. This pedestalled chalice (L.i. 279 )( 65 )( Plate 9b) was also made of red clay. From the same burial L.i. at Khuräb came what Stein has described as a "flowerpot", which is, in fact, one of the varieties of truncated conical cups or bowls with clipped and indented rims particularly common in the Murghabo-Bactrian pottery corpus (66) (Plate 9c). To the same series of truncated conical cups or bowls belong those discovered in Khurãb burials D (D .245, 246), Ε. i (.256) and F. i. (.267)(67). A detailed examination, if such is still possible, of the bronze/copper and alabaster vessels and other metal objects from the richly furnished Khurãb ourials would certainly be rewarding in providing more parallels with the Central Asian materials (68). One example, not illustrated, may serve to underline this suggestion. Sir Aurel Stein mentions in passing that in Burial L.ii(?) at Khurãb he found a large flat plaque which might have formed a part of a mirror ( 69 ) . When we recurn once more to the cemetery at Mehi in southern Baluchistan, we find that burial deposit III also contained a thin copper uisc, which Stein thought was probably a mirror (Mehi III. 6. 5) (70)( Plate 6c &amp; d). Taking these two accounts into serious consid- eration, we may well have two more Murghabo-Bactrian mirrors, in this case the type without a handle. Finally from burial deposit II(.7) at Mehi emerged a rim fragment adorned with an animal with a pendent tail, presumably a dog (71) (Plate 9d). This animal is crudely fashioned in clay and its four feet have been placed on either side of the rim. Bactrian graves in the northwest Afghan province of Balkh and at sites in the lower Murghab area, viz. Margiana, have provided vessels with straight walls and a low ring base, thrown from red clay and with a cream coloured slip. They are decorated with snakes crawling on the inside and over the rim, and also seals, horned animals, possibly zebus, as well as other animals less readily identifiable, and human beings, all having a place on the rim (72). This type of vessel decorated with human beings and animals modelled on the rim was apparently quite popular, and they are regarded oy Viktor Sarianidi as having served an important cultic and deep religious purpose. A complete vessel with a similar plastic decoration was discovered in Margiana in tha site complex of Togolok and again shows seals, snakes, possibly wolves, birds(?) ana human beings (73) (Plate 10a, b, с &amp; d).</page><page sequence="10">12 The rim fragment from burial deposit I I (.7) at Mehi, with its plastic decoration in the shape of a dog (which meanwhile has also come to the notice of Sarianidi, who incorporates it in his most recent 1990 publication), may, therefore, illustrate that even this rather special type of pottery has found its way to southern Baluchistan. This leaves us with the intriguing but rather speculative question of whether the cultic and religious ideas of the Murghabo- Bactrian world had also travelled to southern Baluchistan and to the Bampur Valley region. Notwithstanding, we are still left with a fascinating, emerging pattern of contacts throughout a wide area in the late third and early second millennium B.C.
