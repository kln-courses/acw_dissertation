<plain_text><page sequence="1">A NOTE ON THE HARIHARA CULT Pranabananda J ash ( Visva-Bharati ) Summary The cult and philosophy of Saivism have given rise to varied iconogr aphical representations of Rudra-śiva. Among his different anthropomorphic forms worshipped in the whole country, that of Harihara is undoubtedly the most important. The conception of this image combines various ideas and customs, and has probably resulted from the fusion of at least two distinct religious creeds, which development is best illustrated by the Pradyumnešvara motif. In this motif Śiva, Umā, Laksmī, and Nārāyaņa are carved on both sides of the statue to harmonise (1) Harihara, (2) Laksmi-nārāyaņa, (3) Umā-mahesvara forms. The motive behind the rise of the system of syncretic form of worship is, no doubt, an attempt of the religious teachers belonging to different sectarian groups to express a great deal of eclecticism in matters of their respective cults ; and secondly, it was a joint effort of these sects to wash out the popularity and supremacy of the non-brahmanic sects which flourished all over the country during the time of Aśoka. From a close observation of the archaeological evidences, especially the iconographie representations of the Kusāņa era it may clearly be concluded that this syncretic form of worship came into vogue when the Brāhmaņic cult had been facing a great crisis. Lastly, it was not an entirely new conception, for it was in the Vedic literature in a nuclear form, as is illustrated by the story of Yama and YamL The fuller development took place due to the challenge of Buddhism, and other socio-political factors. As a result the Harihara sub-sect gathered immense momentum and significance.</page></plain_text>
