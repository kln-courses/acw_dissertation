<plain_text><page sequence="1">Franz Fiihmann. Der Geliebte der Morgenrote. Hamburg. Hoffmann &amp; Campe. 1979. 84 pages. 12.80 DM. To the ideologues of fashionable "relevance" our classi- cal humanist heritage may seem outmoded. Yet the classics are not dusty relics. The Greek myths, for example, state not only the truths of their own age, but do indeed comment on the human condition universally. This insight has informed Franz Fiihmann's work all along. Now, in this slender book, he retells and interprets four episodes from Greek myth: "Der Geliebte der Morgen- rote" is Tithonus, whose divine lover Eos procured for him eternal life, forgetting about youth; "Hera and Zeus " focuses on Hera's seduction of her "all-powerful" spouse, which seals the doom of Troy - a consequence he must unwillingly en- dorse; "Marsyas" is the satyr flayed alive by a deceitful Apollo for hubris - yet his art lives on; likewise, the god of the forges in "Das Netz des Hephaistos " is no less an artist for having failed to erase his cuckold's shame. In each case Fiihmann explores the dynamic of power and its victims. The main theme which orchestrates each story - without exhausting its poetic richness - is stated in "Hera and Zeus": "Denn auch die Macht der Machtigsten ist nicht allmachtig. " Power has its own rules which can bind the wielders beyond their intent. The Greeks knew this when they set the Moirai, the Fates, over their anthropomorphic gods. Fiihmann's book first appeared (in 1978) in his native DDR. It is tempting to put a narrow interpretation on his intentions: truth has frequently donned an outlandish or "antic" disguise, the better to dodge the attentions of myopic censorship. And there is, of course, a message also for the adherents of an ideology which has deposed the Judeo- Christian God, usurping his place along with his claim to absoluteness. The theme here, however, is broader. Fiihmann asserts the dignity of the victims against any totali- tarianism. Man is finite, stinks even, but has glory. He is ennobled by his emotions, his art and the capacity for love. Man exists in the vital tension between limitation and yearn- ing. Aspirations are not invalid because they are doomed. Tithonus's love does not shrivel with his body; Marsyas's artistry survives the executioners' vivisectionist analysis. Fiihmann here reconfirms his stature as a significant writ- er. In general, his vehicle is up to its load. Vocabulary and syntax accord sensitively with his themes and motifs, from the lofty eroticism of Hera's seduction to the gory horror of the slaughter of Marsyas. The language is lyrical, elevated, formalized when appropriate, without lapsing into antiquar- ianism. Insight into the meaning of events is concentrated in aphoristically pithy comment. At times the evocative power of a word says more than a sentence could. Such striving for economy, however, has its pitfalls: Hera, vis-a-vis Zeus, employs the same lie she had used on the Goddess of Love - does that make it "die Luge der Aphrodite "? The trope of repetition can be inventive ("Alltag nach der Allnacht ") or close to banality ("Die Briider waren B ruder "). It is anachro- nistic feedback from Nazi racism to comment: "Aus der Un- sterblichkeit kann man nicht austreten." Fiihmann takes other risks, such as constructing a dative- verb (widerstehen) with an infinitive, or employing a point-in-time verb (auf- hdgen) duratively. Boldness marks the creative mind. The necessary discipline may still earn Fiihmann the advance laurels as "the best living writer of German prose. " Friedrich P. Ott University of Massachusetts, Boston</page></plain_text>
