<plain_text><page sequence="1">The methodological contribution is most graphically illustrated from the first half of the book, which is devoted to the principles and context of the research (39 pp.) and Beti early history (155 pp.). Laburthe-Tolra states that his approach follows fundamental requirements of scientific method, namely that conclusions be based on as complete an examination of the sources as possible. Each piece of information, whether oral or archival, is dated and mapped in the manner of archaeology or classical scholarship, and this mastery of the sources is formidable. For example, he draws on evidence from written and oral sources, linguistic and genealogical data, items of material culture, modes of self-decoration, political structure and ritual practice to argue that the present close relationship between the Beti and the Fang is one of partial merging rather than identity, and that the Beti originate from the savanna-forest border rather than the forest itself. This devotion to the sources is carried through to the main body of the ethnography where, rather than create a model of Beti society in terms of Western theory, the author 'leaves to the Beti that which they themselves considered the substance of their life: speech' (p. 38). There are, of course, contradictions in the sources; some of these he resolves through contextualizing them, but many discrepancies and anomalies are presented. In fact, he insists that their documentation is critical, not only to the scientific endeavour, but to any theoretical understanding of segmentary societies. These societies, he says, 'conceal their nerve centres in free space' (p. 208). There are always many possible forms which ideas and material goods can take, and many different syntheses into patterns and institutions (p. 19). 'The implicit norms are rarely identical to the explicit values of reference' (p. 200). The description of the Beti 'ethos' is built up from the complexity of speech and practice, not down from central principles. Theoretically, much is implicit. There is no systematic comparative section or literature review, and the orientation owes much to interpretive social science. However, the organization of the material reflects a very interesting union of ideological and political-economic approaches. The central focus is 'the aims which this society posited for itself (p. 233), that is, the attainment of wealth and power by men. Processes of accumulation in political-economic terms, and orientation in spiritual terms, are what gives shape to the ethnography. The interpretive approach is applied to Beti concepts and practice in the acquisition, management and transmission of wealth and power. Since 'the fundamental form of power is the power to possess women' (p. 356), marriage is the central subject in the chapter on the economy, and the whole ethnography makes one of the most detailed examinations of hierarchical relations between the sexes and ages in the African ethnographic literature. As such it is of great importance as a commentary on Marxist models of segmentary social structures, and holds implications for feminist theory. The author says enough on these subjects to make it clear that his thinking is attuned to the issues, although the presentation is almost bereft of theoretical polemics. The low profile given to theory and comparison belies the potential importance of the thought. This book is, in all these respects, a source book for students of the history and social organization of segmentary societies. JANE I.

The volume edited by Kennedy is typical of the 'American' brand of cultural anthropology. In the main these essays are descriptive accounts of standardized beliefs, interpreted largely outside any immediate social context. This could only be so, however, for the people in question were forcibly removed from their homeland and resettled in conjunction with the Aswan high dam project. The volume is in some ways reminiscent of the many studies done among Amerindians whose modes of livelihood were also radically altered by external sources. Dr Metuh's partial ethnography on Igbo religion is a rehearsal of the 'High God in Africa' debate, which is now quite stale after so many decades. He writes, 'This book . . . is a study of the place of God in the life and worship of the Igbo ... Its scope is extended to see what light the Igbo experience throws on the persisting problem of the place of God Himself in African traditional religion'. Jacobson-Widding's substantial monograph offers a modified structural analysis of colour classification and cognition, based on a regional survey of peoples of the Lower Congo. Of the three Red-White-Black as a Mode of Thought is, by common standards of ethnography, perhaps the most valuable, theoretically informed contribution. Nubian Ceremonial Life is a collection of ten essays with a modest introductory survey on aspects of Nubian history by the editor. Four of the ten essays are Kennedy's, and each of these has been published previously; he is also co-author of two additional articles. The contributions are primarily ethnographic, showing little interest in broader issues of social theory. This may be the result of editorial policy since Kennedy writes (p. xvi): 'Looking back over the history of anthropology, it is apparent that ethnographic facts generally have been of far more lasting significance than the great bulk of theoretical formulations, no matter how brilliant the latter seemed at the time of their currency.' However, since each essay is concerned with the vague topic of 'social change' within this population, the general absence of theoretical synthesis suggests the volume might only attract the interests of Nubian specialists. H. M. Fahim considers the Friday ritual of Salat al-Jum'a from a diachronic perspective noting a tendency toward Islamization and secularization, due in part to economic changes brought about by the resettlement process. Kennedy and Fahim indicate that Dhikr rituals have also waned in social and ideological significance for related reasons, namely, a contemporary trend toward secular over suprahuman modes of explanation. Cults focussing on individual sheikhs or 'saints' provide the substantive basis of al-Messiri's article which attempts to define and distinguish a variety of psychosocial functions they served. Africanists whose interests include indigenous synthetic images should appreciate al-Guidi's essay on anthropomorphic spirits associated with the river Nile. As indicated, Metuh's monograph is an attempt to dispel the notion that a 'withdrawn God' is the single most important feature of Divinity in traditional African religions. As such, the book will be welcomed by those who 1) consider this a serious issue in contemporary African ethnography and 2) hold the same beliefs as the author. The presentation of ethnography is occasionally dogmatic and rhetorical. It is unequivocally demonstrated that Igbo are socialized to accept the existence of a suprahuman Divinity (Chukwu) or God. But this social fact by itself offers little reason for the author to continually speak in the immodestly general terms of the African, on the basis of his restricted study. He is quite correct when he argues that western monothetic terms do not always suit the meaning of African classifications; but this argument would be better served if he had not chosen to refer to the Igbo High God as 'He', 'Lord', 'Shepherd' and so on. One wonders why he has chosen to ignore the work of Horton, Beidelman, Kopytoff or Lienhardt - to mention only a few- whose contributions have collectively revolutionized the anthropological perspective on African systems of belief and social accountability. One also wonders if an Igbo who was not also a Christian would have written a similar account. Jacobson-Widding's study is an exemplary anthropological monograph. One of the central concerns of her present work may rightfully seem trivial to some: whether or not a binary or 83 REVIEWS</page><page sequence="3">triadic structure of classification underlies human cognition as manifested in symbolism. Yet the ethnography she marshalls to validate her own analysis is a model in the comparative method. This is all the more impressive because the study is not based on a single ethnic group, but draws instead on an extensive literature which provides a wider regional comparison. Her work marks a real advance and resynthesis not only of ethnographic method but also in the central theoretical concern of social anthropology, the translation of culture. She merits a wide reading among anthropologists, of course, but also, ideally, among others in such diverse fields as comparative literature and social history. JOHN W. BURTON Wheaton College GLEN NORCLIFFE, TOM PINFOLD (eds.), Planning African Development, London: Croom Helm, 1981, 201 pp. The title of this book suggests that it deals with general issues in planning development in Africa. In fact the book deals exclusively with Kenya. It reflects the work of a technical aid project funded by the Canadian International Development Agency, in which all of the authors were involved at various times. It would have been interesting to see at least one chapter written by a Kenyan, but perhaps this omission reflects the very large expatriate involvement in Kenyan planning processes. The book has eight chapters but is really in two distinct parts, as the first four deal with policy issues and the last four with project planning. In the first section, a series of diverse topics such as nutrition, marginal land, the rural non-farm sector and industrial location are discussed. Each of these is really an independent study and the linkages between chapters are not well developed. The chapters also appear to have been written at different times, as one author makes no use of the 1979-83 Development Plan, although others do. Cook looks at the problem of raising nutrition levels and makes a strong case for the increased use of fish as an alternate source of protein. This is not a new idea, and although his arguments on fishing potential are sound, there is little mention of issues such as access to land, which clearly affect the implementation of some of his ideas. The study by Campbell on Land-Use Competition at the Margins of the Rangelands is much more perceptive and he examines the implications of the 1979-83 Development Plan's emphasis on the use of arid and semi-arid lands, utilizing a case study from Kajiado District. Freeman and Norcliffe concentrate on the rural non-farm sector. Work on the informal sector has largely concentrated on the urban areas, but as this chapter shows, the rural non-farm sector is at least eight times as large in Kenya and much more work of this kind needs to be done. In the final chapter of the first part Westcott and Norcliffe argue for a more effective locational policy for manufacturing industry in Kenya. An important but unanswered question is what the relationship between this sector and the informal sector, both urban and rural, is to be. The second part of the book deals with various aspects of planning and budgeting with particular emphasis on the imbalance between recurrent and development expenditures. This is a major problem and methods to deal with it more effectively are required. The econometric approaches suggested by the authors have many drawbacks in addition to the well-known methodological ones. Such approaches in Kenya are seriously weakened by the lack of adequate data to feed into the models, by the validity of the assumptions made in these models and perhaps above all by the fact that in Kenya planning is as much a political process as it is an economic one. The authors ignore the latter issue completely and as a result the conclusions they reach have serious drawbacks. Anderson finds 'economies of scale' in hospitals and argues for the more efficient use of existing structures rather than building dispensaries and rural health centres. To follow this policy would be to intensify the existing inequities in accessibility to health care. Milanesi sees rural electrification as an uneconomic proposition. What he means is that the eighty per cent of Kenya's population in the rural areas cannot pay the same rates for electricity as the urban elite. Does this then mean that unless they move to town, they are to be denied electricity? 84 REVIEWS</page></plain_text>
