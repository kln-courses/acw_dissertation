Claire Ödland The Field Museum, 1400 South Lakeshore Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60605 USA Abstract The chapter discusses the making of Shipibo: La película de nuestra memoria ( Shipibo : The Movie of Our Memories) and documents the responses made to the Field Museum's presentation of Tschopik's 1953 film Men of the Montaña by community leaders, artists, professors, elders, and schoolchildren in 10 Shipibo villages along the Ucayali and Pisqui rivers, in Pucallpa, and in Lima. The Museum utilized his raw silent footage to allow the Shipibo of today to discuss their sense of indigenous identity and to share knowledge of their traditional ways with each other and with future generations. The chapter interlaces Shipibo commentaries on their cultural heritage and their traditional rituals and ceremonies with quotations from Tschopik's diary, descriptions of his film, and pertinent historical references from the literature. Resumen Este capítulo es sobre la realización de Shipibo: La película de nuestra memoria , y la documentación de las reacciones de los líderes de la comunidad, artistas, profesores, ancianos y niños de edad escolar, de diez comunidades shipibo, ubicadas a lo largo de los ríos Pisqui y Ucayali, en Pucallpa y Lima, sobre la presentación del Field Museum de la película de Tschopik's de 1953, Men of the Montaña. El Field Museum utilizó las filmaciones originales mudas de Tschopik para que los shipibo de hoy en día compartan el conocimiento de sus tradiciones antiguas entre ellos y con las futuras generaciones. El capítulo entrelaza los comentarios de los shipibo sobre su herencia e identidad cultural y sus ceremonias y rituales tradicionales con extractos del diario de Tschopik, descripciones de su película y referencias históricas pertinentes extraídas de la literatura. Introduction The Field Museum has a long history of research and collections building in the Andes-to-Amazon region of Peru. Most recently, as described by Wali (this volume), ecologists and anthropologists have been collaborating on environmental conservation efforts that engage local populations in the management of their natural resources. In this endeavor, a valuable resource came into play. In 1953, anthropologist Harry Tschopik Jr. (Fig. 4.1) had visited the region to research the exhibit "Men of the Montaña" for the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), and film the Shipibo of the upper Ucayali River (Tschopik, 1954b). A selection of scenes from his expedition was televised in the program Adventure on CBS, coproduced by the AMNH in 1954. As part of the show, the journalist Charles Collingwood also interviewed Tschopik about his findings. The balance of his film footage, however, would remain unseen for more than 50 years. With the permission of the AMNH, I created a compilation of Tschopik's film outtakes under the title El Pueblo Shipibo (Ödland, 2011). In 2007, the Field Museum arranged to present it to Shipibo people in their native communities during our collecting expedition. Tschopik's images of ceremonial customs and daily life in the flooded forest of the Pisqui and upper Ucayali rivers are a priceless cultural record for the Shipibo of today, who have few photographs of even their recent past. A group of Shipibo community leaders from Pucallpa and Iparia came to the first screening and reacted with great emotion. One man exclaimed, "Our ancestors weren't stupid after all! Look what we used to know how to do!" (my transcriptions, 2007). William Barbarán González, whose Shipibo name is Pein Sani, from Nuevo Libertador, said, "I think this is a very important document for us. We know the whole history of the Shipibo people in an oral manner. To go back about fifty years and see a documentary like this makes us reflect on how the ancient lifestyle of the Shipibo was. We hope that one day we can count on having this documentary. For us it will be vitally important for the purpose of knowing who we used to be, our customs, our lifestyle, as the Shipibo people here in Ucayali. For we indigenous Shipibo communities, borders do not exist. We are all of the Ucayali River Basin" (my transcriptions, 2007). During the 2007 museum expedition, I recorded Francisca Panchita Linares of Charasmaná as she sang her request: Now I sing to you from the river landing, From where you came up the ri ver bank. You brought us a beautiful thing, And we want to have it To be like them [the ancestors] and of their things.

Harry Tschopik Jr. (1915-1956), associate curator of the American Museum of Natural History and director of Men of the Montana. "Harry Tschopik was an ethnologist interested in material culture and in the relationship between ethnology and archeology, a dedicated museum man with a flair for exhibits and a belief in the mission of museums to take anthropology to the general public, a pioneer student of Peruvian ethnology who trained the first generation of Peruvian ethnologists, and a scholar who stood uncompromisingly for the highest standards of recording and interpretation in anthropology" (Rowe, 1958). With the kind permission of the American Museum of Natural History. That trip in 2007 made us aware of the significance of the documentary footage. We wanted to honor the wishes of the Shipibo and provide them with a copy that included their commentaries. In May 2008, our team was joined by Nancy Feldman of the School of the Art Institute. In July 2010, the full team grew to include Luisa Belaunde, then of the Universidad Federal de Río de Janeiro; Manuel Dámaso Cuentas Robles of the Universidad Nacional Intercultural de la Amazonia; and Peruvian videographer Fernando Valdivia Gómez. Based on the comments we received in 2007, I added additional film footage. In 2008 and 2010, we took a better edited, one-hour DVD to 10 native communities (Fig. 1.1) on the upper Pisqui and Ucayali rivers: Caco Macaya, Curiaca del Caco, La Cumbre, Manco Cápac, Pueblo Nuevo, San Francisco de Yarinacocha, San Luís de Charasmaná, Santa Clara (Nuevo Chicago), Santa Rosa, and Yarina. I recorded, transcribed, and had translated the commentaries from our expeditions in 2007, 2008, and 2010, sometimes from 36 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 4.2.

Used with kind permission of the American Museum of Natural History. Shipibo to Spanish by Peruvian associates and then from Spanish to English. These commentaries, capturing Shipibo people's reactions to the silent-film footage, became the foundation for our documentary. This chapter discusses the making of the resulting film, Shipibo: La película de nuestra memoria {Shipibo: The Movie of Our Memories). To deepen the understanding of the commentaries, I also researched archival records for Tschopik's accounts and diaries held at the AMNH. In what follows, narratives and criticisms from the audiences and informants are interlaced with quotations from Tschopik's diary, descriptions of his film, and pertinent historical references from the literature. The commentaries collected reflect the topics that the Shipibo people chose to discuss. In the process of viewing the first movie and making the second, informants shared their views of their own cultural practices with their children and with outsiders and discussed questions of identity and heritage. Cultural Heritage and Identity in Everyday Life The Shipibo possess an emblematic dress and art tradition that uses an elaborate style of patterning called kené; the meanings, use, making, and makers of this art are discussed by Belaunde (this volume). Tschopik's film shows every villager wearing the traditional dress, decorated with kené, that in some ways has changed very little since 1953. These traditional forms - the women's chitonie (skirt), pampanilla (shawl), and blouse and the men's cushma (tunic) - have not changed, but fibers, manner of fabrication, design motifs, and, most of all, occasions of usage have evolved in the way that fashions do, as people are influenced by new materials, the dress of surrounding people, and the requirements of their changing lives. But how accurate was Tschopik's documentary? For example, did everyone in a Shipibo community in 1953 dress in traditional, handmade clothes on a daily basis? In his film, every child and every adult is wearing traditional dress: men are shown working in the fields, clearing land, fishing, and building houses while wearing cushmas and even elaborate headdresses. Although Tschopik's (1953) diary noted that the chief usually dressed in Western clothes, he said nothing about the average villager, who, one would think, would follow the chiefs lead and if possible wear Western dress as well. The chief, he commented, was most helpful in arranging demonstrations of ceramic or textile arts and, one might assume, in arranging for Tschopik to film other events as well. Tschopik's film portrays women's daily tasks of preparing food and fabricating textiles and ceramics. They are shown cleaning and preparing cotton; spinning; weaving on a back- strap loom and on the harp-shaped, handheld Ucayali loom used in the region; and painting fine kené designs on a skirt length, using a splint dipped into a gourd, making the initial lines a darker brownish black. They cook yucca over a wood fire in a ceramic cooking pot covered with banana leaves. They demonstrate coil building, firing, and painting ceramic pots. The three women in Figure 4.2, an image of regrettably low quality due to its capture from Tschopik's movie, present different styles of traditional dress. On the left, the woman wears a blouse in contrasting colors that was still in fashion in 2010. The chitonie she is working on is appliquéd in bold black and white, a style typical of the Pisqui River at the time and no longer worn (my field notes, 2010) (see, e.g., two chitontes with comparable designs, Harvard Peabody Museum, Nos. 75888 and 75889). The central woman is spinning cotton and wearing a printed cotton blouse, a fabric that has been supplanted by polyester satin, with a brown dyed, fcené-painted skirt, also no longer in use. The woman on the right is preparing cotton ÖDLAND: THE MAKING OF SHIPIBO 37</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 4.3.

Feldman. roving for spinning while wearing a worn blouse and a chitonie that appears to have been over-dyed black. Young and old informants agreed that the traditional Shipibo dress was beautiful in the Tschopik movie. However, all the women who in our documentary discuss traditional dress rather significantly wore traditional dress, while others in nonspeaking roles did not: young women and other village women in the background wear shorts and T-shirts. Verena Valera Rojas, seen standing on the right in Figure 3.4, whose Shipibo name Kanan Kais means "Designer Woman," said, "In the old times, our ancestors, our grandparents dressed to feel beautiful. This is how we were; this is how we should be" (my transcriptions, 2007). However, even when they admire the traditional arts, young people cannot be made to dress in a style they see as old-fashioned. In our film, Priscila Maynas Romaina said, "Young girls of today hardly ever wear traditional dress and the young men, never." Older women in the remote river community of Manco Capac, wearing the chitonie , were even more strongly outspoken. In our film, Hilda Amasifuén Picota said, Our grandparents used to wear this [traditional skirt and blouse], so my mother made me wear it, too. Now we don't wear the cushma , the pampanilla , or face paint. Our daughters don't wear it either. In the future, our daughters are not going to wear this kind of clothing. . . . Our children dress like mestizos. The women now even wear pants! Seeing the film we were thinking, our young people are far from appreciating our customs. I advise my daughters to wear traditional skirts because we are not mestizos. That's what I tell my daughters, but they don't pay attention. Shipibo women today have a choice of dress, depending on occasion, occupation, status, and comfort. By 2007, the fashion for painted skirts seen in the 1953 film appeared to have given way to embroidered styles. In the upriver communities, nearly all the older women and a few young women wore embroidered skirts with traditional blouses or T-shirts. In urban Lima, Pucallpa, or even the nearby native community of Santa Clara, chitontes were almost never seen on young women. Only those engaged in artisan trade or cultural community organizations wore Shipibo dress. Shipibo women travel in Lima or Iquitos outside the native communities wearing their traditional dress in order to represent their culture, to indicate their professional identity as artists, and to market their arts. All males in the 1953 film, young and old, wore the cushma , even while doing the rough work of thatching a house, clearing and burning land, tending to crops, and hunting and fishing. However, Tschopik noted in his diary, "The Shipibo are rapidly becoming deculturated. Now the men wear . . . work clothes and go barefoot. The women wear traditional painted skirts and decorative blouses and traditional shawls. [The chief, a] man of about 55 . . . [o]rdinarily . . . dresses in khaki pants, a shirt and goes barefoot" (Tschopik, 1953: 3:5:53, 4:6:53). He goes on to hint that he and the chief may have arranged for the community to wear and fully display its traditional dress instead of their customary Western-style clothes. Girard (1958: 234), a near contemporary, noted that men wore Western dress except for the festival attire, which was covered "with drawings." Writing about her fieldwork in the early 1980s, Eakin (1986: 19) states that Shipibo men wore Western clothes but would use the cushma for special occasions or in the evenings for warmth or for protection from mosquitoes. One woman said that her son in Charasmaná wore the cushma she made for him only for warmth, never for special occasions (my transcriptions, 2010), 38 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 4.4. A Shipibo man aboard a boat wearing a tailored, embroidered shirt. Yarinacocha, 1988. Photo: R. L. Weber. but a group of young men filmed in 2010 possessed fine cushmas and modeled them together (Fig. 4.3). Most of the men we spoke with during our trips wore T-shirts, jeans, and cutoffs and went barefoot or wore old sneakers or rain boots. We did observe that for special cultural events, a man may still wear a fine cushma or a Western shirt or vest painted with kené designs (see Fig. 4.4). In our film, dressed in a polo shirt and long pants, Chief Saúl Rojas of Caco Macaya (Fig. 4.5) lamented the impact that missionaries had had on his culture: [Our traditional dress] "disappeared with the arrival of many religions and with education. . . . We used nose ornaments, and painted our bodies with huito, and the way we dressed, they [the missionaries] said they were the devil's ways, prohibited." In Tschopik's film, only men wore the headdresses, called maiti , in a range of styles based on a wide headband that left the crown of the head bare. In our film, José Roque Maynas, an elder of Santa Clara, wore the traditional cushma and a similar, feather-trimmed maiti while viewing and commenting on the silent-film clips. Observing the men's traditional dress in Fig. 4.5. Chief Saul Rojas, contributing to Shipibo: The Movie of Our Memories , Culiaca de Caco, upper Ucayali River. 2010. Photo: N. Feldman. ÖDLAND: THE MAKING OF SHIPIBO 39</page><page sequence="6">Tschopik's movie in our documentary, he chuckled disapprov- ingly at the men's contemporary headdresses and said, "This is just exactly right; the clothing, the ornamentation, is all just as it was. This is the traditional style crown; it's woven properly. The custom was for everyone to wear these for festivals in the old days. Now they use embroidered cloth or whatever but it should be woven, and not with the name of the church [Fig. 4.3] - that's very modern, new . . . because these newcomers tell us that we can abandon the customs of our culture." Schoolchildren wore uniforms to the film screening at their bilingual Shipibo-Spanish school in San Francisco de Yarina- cocha. Seven children, ages 14 through 17, were selected by their professors for interviews and spoke for our film. Girls wore a gray skirt and white blouse or T-shirt and most boys a T-shirt and dark pants. One boy wore a gold braid pinned to his white dress shirt, representing his high academic achievement. This boy, Igaro Ochavano Rucoba, was the only person we encountered who had ever seen a photograph of his grandpar- ents in which his grandfather wore the tari [cushma] and held a macana club. Another student, Jacqueline Roque said, "Seeing this film was important because it makes me realize how we were before, how we dressed. Above all we are losing our clothing tradition. . . . Many don't want to dress differently, but above all the prettiest designs are those from before." Shipibo identity in Tschopik's film was also portrayed by face paint and body adornment. His film shows the majority of the adults and children wearing face paint, and his diary offers a few notes about this. The chief of Pao Cocha, for example, goes about "often with his face fully painted in red and black and his bangs slicked down with genipa" ( Genipa oblongifolia) (Tscho- pik, 1953: 4:6:53). The genus is now known as Genipa americana . The painted face designs are much like the kené figures applied to textiles and ceramics (see Ödland and Weber, this volume) and in Tschopik's film sometimes fill the whole face or lie like a lacey mask across the eyes. Girard, too, visited the Shipibo during the early 1950s and described designs of painted faces, hands, and feet similar to those in Tschopik's film but unfortunately did not photograph them. Shipibo women paint the upper part of their faces. For celebrations, they usually cover the face completely with geometric figures and dots, done with little splints of bamboo. These are similar to those of their ceramics, textiles, weapons, and other utensils. They also paint their hands and feet with the same type of drawings. The anthropomorphic effigy pots are predominantly feminine, with the sex prominently featured. The face displays geometric drawings similar to those that the Shipibo paint on themselves in times of fiesta. Decoration with dots in a field framed by lines, as the Shipibo and Amahuaca style their face paint. The Shipibo use the specific verb chachat meaning "to paint the face with little dots," (my translation) which indicates that this is an ancient tradition (Girard, 1958: 238). During her fieldwork the following decade, Eakin met women wearing face and body paint, usually black Genipa but sometimes also red annatto. Heath (Alayza et al., 2002: 18) wrote that on holidays, some women still painted their bodies with fine designs. According to Gebhart-Sayer (1985a: 145), the juice was G. americana , and the paint would last four to five days: long enough for the Anisheati festival. Today, the attitudes toward and uses of body and face paint are variable. In Pucallpa, Verena Valera Rojas said, "We used a cape and wore our faces painted, with feathers above. We all had necklaces, and this was what showed off a beautiful young woman" (my transcriptions, 2007). Either Shipibo or outsiders may admire a beautifully fcewá-painted face, but informants pointed out that the paint serves to indicate ownership and membership. Professor Eli Sánchez Rodriguez said, "Face painting is used only for some ceremonies that have a spiritual orientation. It is not a simple painting; it has a religious meaning, a spiritual meaning, as if to say, 'I am present.' With this, one expresses one's desire to participate in the ritual. . . . They have their hands painted, which distinguishes them as part of the ritual and participants in the ceremony." A woman painting a man's face represented a mark of ownership, as to say, "This man is mine" (my transcriptions, 2010). Body paint was an important element of a girl's coming-of- age ceremony when, at about 10 years of age, she was initiated into womanhood, or, as the Shipibo described it in my transcriptions (2010), "she was dedicated as a woman." This was often the central part of the Anisheati , described later in this chapter in the section "Ritual and Ceremony." This private puberty ritual was not shown in Tschopik's film, but according to women we interviewed, the girl was painted all over her body and legs in elaborate kené designs. Inesa Diaz of the native community of Caco Macaya appeared to be about 65 years old when she recounted her experience as a girl for our film: "In those days, we would all dress ourselves with adornments and typical clothes, with the face painted with huito. It would be good to see nowadays that our children were dressed traditionally, practicing all of our customs." Other women said that now, however, face painting is practically never done. Hilda Amasifuén Picota said, "I saw that [in the film] in the fiestas women painted their husbands and children, now that is lost, for example I do not know how to make designs on the face. This makes me reflect on how they used to do things, and now we can't do what our ancestors used to do" (my transcriptions, 2010). Although rare, we did see evidence that people still knew how to do face and body painting. In 2007, for example, we were allowed to photograph one young woman's legs painted in a teardrop pattern in mourning for her sister. During the same expedition, we witnessed a welcoming ceremony in Nuevo Eden on the upper Pisqui River in which a delegation of Canadian petroleum engineers was greeted, each by a pair of young girls in red-painted faces and ceremonial maiti crowns, and escorted to an oil concession contract signing. In 2010 in the community of Manco Capac, Sara modeled her fcewé-painted face and legs and demonstrated a nose ornament for our documentary in which she said she painted herself with the herb huito or nane because her mother and her grandmothers used to do it. On the other hand, none of the schoolgirls interviewed commented on face painting at all. A much-noted feature of Shipibo body adornment, cranial deformation was traditionally practiced and is shown twice in Tschopik's film. In one view, a baby wears the shaping device tied on the head, and in another, a mother holds up a toddler with an elongated, sloping forehead. Tschopik (1953: 3:5:53) noted, "Almost all have deformed heads and head deformation . . . continues as an active practice." Roe (1982: 39-40) documented Shipibo using the "two short balsa boards wrapped in cotton-filled cloth ( baque vetánetti)" in more remote, isolated villages, including some along the Pisqui River 40 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 4.6. Inesa Diaz, contributing to Shipibo : The Movie of Our Memories , Culiaca de Caco, upper Ucayali River. 2010. Photo: J. C. Ödland. in the early 1980s. "That is the practice of cranial deformation that they used to do, differentiating us from other groups, other people. That is the pad they put on the forehead," one of the participants in a movie audience said, laughing perhaps with some embarrassment (my transcriptions, 2008). Regarding her 1980s fieldwork Eakin (1986: 20-21) wrote, Until very recently, the Shipibo practiced cranial reshaping on babies for beautification. Soon after birth, a board and pad were applied to the baby's forehead with a wide strap around the back of the head. The board remained in place for about three months and was tightened periodically, producing a rounded face and slanted forehead. Missionaries discouraged the practice for years with little result. A more potent deterrent has been ridicule from the outside world. In contemporary culture a Shipibo with a slanted forehead, especially a young army recruit whose short haircut exposes his forehead, is often ridiculed. Consequently, the custom is dying out. Audiences at our film presentations said the reshaping was used primarily to beautify baby girls. In our film, Priscila Maynas Romaina, who was 48 years old in 2010, told how, as a baby, she narrowly escaped having her skull reshaped. "My grandfather told me that this was our custom. My parents both wanted to put it on me but my uncle didn't like it, so they took it off. That was our custom back then." Some older women interviewed in the river communities, for example, Ineza Diaz of Caco Macaya (Fig. 4.6), appeared to have had their heads reshaped. Bernabé Ventura, interviewed on film, who traveled extensively in the Ucayali River basin, said that cranial deformation was used to distinguish a family's higher social position but that he had not seen it since about 1990. The practice lost popularity among villages as they came into closer contact with mainstream Peruvian culture. Women in Tschopik's film had tied brightly patterned bands, called jonshé , around their ankles to make the legs swell attractively. These narrow bands were woven on the Ucayali loom. (For further study of the loom in the Field Museum Collections, refer to FM83005, not shown here). Eakin (1986: 21) and Roe (1982: 39) also noted this practice. It is no longer in fashion, and no one in the audiences commented on it. However, these narrow bands are still produced and sold as bracelets to the tourist trade. In Tschopik's film, both men and women wear beaded chest ornaments and beaded collars covering the entire neck, necklaces of many old silver coins or metal disks, and lip and nose ornaments, whether working or feasting. (For further study in the Field Museum Collections, see FM242505, not shown here). Tschopik's diary (1953: 3:5:53) noted that in the river communities, "most still have nose and lower lip perforated for silver ornaments." Eakin (1986: 20) also noted people wearing the nose ornament but commented that the lip ornament was less often seen. Several La Cumbre community members wanted to speak about the nose ornament, called the reshó. Juan Ochavano said that he stopped wearing it when he was about 66 years old but at age 75, in 2007, he retained the piercing. The round metal ornament was strung on threads through a pierced nose to catch the light at fiestas, and both men and women, especially young women, used it. "It got them to marry sooner," he said (my transcriptions, 2007). In my transcriptions (2007), Panchita Linares, a La Cumbre woman of about 45 years, demonstrated for us how to wear the reshó . She did not want to sell the ornament, and one might assume therefore that she was still using it. Florinda Cardenas Linares (about 60 years old in 2007) did wish to sell her lip ÖDLAND: THE MAKING OF SHIPIBO 41</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 4.7.

Photo: Sarah Rivers ornaments, or kuri , and demonstrated how the carved metal pieces fit neatly into the otherwise indiscernible piercings in her lower lip. Sara of Manco Capac modeled the two lip ornaments as well as the kené- painted face and legs for the documentary. The big, square chest pieces of tiny beads and beaten coins that Tschopik and Eakin referenced seemed to now be reserved for ceremonial events or for sale to tourists. Contemporary potters spoke in our documentary about the meaning of their traditional ceramics and its importance to their culture, produced using the same methods shown in Tschopik's film. (Methods and important traditional forms are illustrated and discussed in Ödland and Weber (this volume). Celestina Amasifuén, a potter in Manco Capac, described and demon- strated some of her methods. In our film, she and her grandchildren chop down a tree in the nearby jungle and carry the heavy wood back to the village to burn the bark. Its ashes would be ground with a stone and mixed to temper the clay. Sunny weather was necessary. "To make a pottery piece I need two weeks: one week to prepare it and another to paint it. And now it's ready to be fired." She pointed to a big pot with large- scale figures, a mahuetá for brewing masato beer (For examples, see Figs. 4.7-4.9). The Museum purchased several pots or tinajas painted in kené figures from Sara Ruht Urias Roman from Manco Capac. In our film, she explained the red and black designs of her biggest pot: "What I like about this one is the painting; the drawing is like the roads that you might take, the paths of life. [The designs represent] knowledge that our ancient mother-ancestors left us. What they knew was much more than all their drawings can tell us." Simple effigy pots, called chomo , like those shown in Tschopik's film, may have a second bowl placed above the body form of the base, or large, elaborate ones may have faces painted or sculpted onto the bowl (Fig. 4.10, FM284544). Since 1993, the government of Peru has sponsored awards for excellence in art, presenting First Prize for Great Masters of Peruvian Craftsmanship to Petronila Cauper of Caco Macaya in 2009 (Fig. 4.11), (for a description of this award, see Feldman, this volume). The prize- winning effigy pot was elaborately shaped and painted, with a large spherical base, a wide neck, and at the top a woman's face. Cauper was interviewed in her thatched, open house, barefoot and dressed traditionally but with her two gold medals on wide ribbons around her neck. In our film, she said, "I felt very proud of myself, because no other Shipibo has received a medal like this. They gave me the first award in Lima and the second in Pucallpa. The chomo , the biggest pot [an effigy pot] with the woman's face, I won first prize with that one, and it was sold and taken to Spain." These complicated and highly decorated pots, Cauper said, might take three weeks to make. Her daughter, Delia Cauper, demonstrated an extremely elaborate joni chomo that she said would express all her skills: a large and complicated form, with a spherical base changing to square at the neck and sculpted with two children clinging to their mother (Fig. 4.11). It is painted in elaborate kené, 42 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 4.8. Shipibo woman polishing ceramic vessel, FM242544. Colonia Calleria, Loreto, 1961. See also Figure 4.7 of the same object. Photo: Borys Malkin burnished, and highly glazed with the local plant-based resin. In our documentary, the potters lamented the impending loss of this artistic tradition; in Celestina Amasifuén's community of Manco Capac, only three women practiced the art, and no young people wanted to learn. She said, "When I die, there will no more of this art. In thirty years there will be no more artisan work." Martin Ccorisapra, a collector and ceramics historian who accompanied us for the making of the documentary, described the kenè on pottery as the energy fields surrounding all beings and objects, represented in three dimensions and symmetrically organized around a cross motif. In the film, he states, "With ayahuasca, what the artists paint is like vibrations, the energy that each living thing has. They also apply this vibration to the cross, so that for them every animal has a vibration or an energy and the cross also has this energy and that's why they show the kené like this." (For further study in the Field Museum Collections, see mahuetá , FM341727, not shown here.) Households visited in 2007-2010 were no longer using pottery vessels; metal pots are more durable for cooking. Even in the Cauper house of two extremely fine and productive potters, cheap metal, plastic, or china plates were used at the everyday table. The schoolchildren in San Francisco interviewed in our documentary were not familiar with how traditional pottery was made and said that although their culture had so many valuable things, such as textiles, painting, and pottery, they did not understand the kené designs. Ritual and Ceremony The Shipibo call the Anisheati the festival of festivals, encompassing as it does all the major rituals and ceremonies of their culture. Informants explained the scenes as Tschopik's film showed the arrival of the guests, the masato toasts, salutations and challenges, strength contests, the punishment of the adulterer's knife, the girl's puberty ceremony, the animal sacrifice, the feast, and a song. Many of these component rituals involved bloodletting to reinforce community identity. In the second round of editing the Tschopik footage, I put the sequences in order as best as possible with the help of Ronald L. Weber and members of different Shipibo communities. Also known as the pishta, the Añi Xeati , or the anishiyacu, preparations for this festival took a year and a half or two. Saúl Rojas, chief of the community of Caco Macaya, remembered attending two Anisheati festivals as a boy when he lived in Nueva Olaya in the lower Ucayali and explained the elaborate requirements (my transcriptions, 2010). The host family began by clearing and burning a new field to grow the yucca needed to ÖDLAND: THE MAKING OF SHIPIBO 43</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 4.9. Hosts and guests at an Anisheati.

Host and guest women made and painted new ceramic brewing pots, or chornos , and serving bowls, and they wove, painted, and embroidered festival clothing, includ- ing a special cushma for the man chosen to sacrifice the animal. Saúl Rojas said the custom of the Anisheati was no longer practiced. It was, he said, first prohibited by the first evangelical missionaries and the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) (my transcriptions, 2010). SIL was founded in the United States in Arkansas in 1934 and in 1949 established a base at San Francisco de Yarinacocha (http://www.sil.org). The elder José Roque Maynas, shown as a young man in Figure 4.12 and 66 years old in 2010, was an experienced informant for other anthropologists, including Lathrap, Myers, Loy, and Weber (Weber, 2007). His father-in-law, Catalino, appeared in the film in the fishing scene and was an informant to Roe and others. He identified the location of Tschopik's film at two sites: the fishing scene was shot in Yarinacocha and the balance on the Pisqui River, agreeing with Tschopik's journal (Tschopik, 1953). He noted that some events of a traditional Anisheati were either missing from my edited version of the Tschopik footage or out of order. In other moments in our film, José Roque Maynas was enthusiastic about it. He strongly approved of the men's full traditional dress: " Estos somos nosotros , asi eran nuestras costumbres . We are these people; these were our customs." Informants agreed that much of Tschopik's film of the ritual was correct but remarked that timing it for the arrival of an anthropological expedition would have been unlikely. Only when all the arrangements were complete and the masato ready would the invitations go out, carried in canoes by host men with pots of masato to guests' river landings. Here, they were greeted with more masato , and the drinking would begin. When guests would arrive at the fiesta, more masato was served, and the strength challenges began (my transcriptions, 2010). In an image of unfortunately low quality due to its capture from Tschopik's movie, men raise their heavily decorated macanas , shouting greetings and challenges (Fig. 4.7). Audi- ences in Santa Rosa in 2007 explained the scene: "The man or the majordomo who carries the staff, when he's done drinking the huarapo or the masato , he will say ' je , je , je ,' as a sign that the drink was well-prepared, and that now it will have the effect of making the guests drunk. After that, they all begin to shout 'je, je ' but now in order to find someone to challenge to fight. Look there, now they are testing their strength with the staff, to fight later" (my transcriptions, 2007). In our documentary, Bernabé Ventura explained how the macana battles were just part of a larger picture: "To demonstrate the skills of each man or woman, women competed with their arts, and the men battled with the macana , win or lose, and like a contest, like a natural law that is not managed by families, by clans; whoever wins is the conqueror." Men struck at each other with the clubs, while the women ran in to try to grab the clubs with their shawls and keep the men from doing too much damage. But as Chief Rojas said, "Sometimes they killed each other; that's the fiesta." Women fought each other as well, including informant and textile artist Priscila Maynas Romaina, who said in our film, laughing, "Sometimes when a man goes off with another woman, then his ex-wife looks for a way to make him leave the new woman. Then she would fight her, because the stronger woman wins the man, just like that. I fought once but no more. Yes, I won." In the documentary, the schoolteacher Eli Sanchez Rodriguez offered a more spiritual explanation of the club battle as a strengthening of the whole community: 44 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="11">Fig. 4.10.

Rivers, © The Field Museum, CL0000_284544_FrontAngle. All the leaders of the different family groups organized the Anisheati or the pishta festival, and for everyone, men and women, it was important to be strong, Koshi joni , in the sense of strong in spirit and strong in body. That way we felt the strength of the family. Arriving at the fiesta, everyone drank masato, and saluted each other by raising their clubs. That is the harmonious opening of the fiesta, the raising of the clubs and shouts of greeting that both sides gave. As a sign of brotherhood, the strongest had to test each other, and show off their skills and abilities, so, the men challenged each other and the women went against each other too. In the end, nobody is the strongest because everyone is strong! Following the ritual battle with their decorated macanas , in Tschopik's film, two men fully adorned in cushmas , bracelets, face paint, and nose ornaments engage with the "adulterer's knife:" a small curved knife called the weshati. (For further study in the Field Museum Collections, see FM338478, not shown here.) In this scene, one man punishes another man, presumably for an extramarital affair, by cutting his head behind the ear, and substantial, ceremonial bloodletting follows. Informants Juan Ochavano of La Cumbre and Francisca Panchita Linares of Charasmaná on the upper Pisqui River said that if you found your wife with another man, he knew that you would be going to hit him. Then you would go to the fiesta, fight him there, and let "a lot of blood flow" (my transcriptions, 2007). Roe discusses the macana and weshati fighting, crediting the need for the fighting to the "fairly continuous philandering of men and the receptivity of married women," and resentment building up into hostility and revenge. It was culturally expected to acquiesce to being punished, or else the hostility would last for years. However, the weshati could also be poisoned and cause serious injury or even death. Chief Saúl Rojas described the developments, and, interestingly, his story tallied practically word for word with Roe's (1982: 98-108) published description. Other informants agreed. If a man made off with another man's wife, was caught stealing, or broke any social contract, the guilty man had to yield his head for cutting, both to prove that he was macho and to remain a member of the community. Other informants discussing the weshati referred to it as a tradition of the recent past. The elder José Roque Maynas recalled in our documentary an uncle, dead "only a year," who had a collection of scars, so one can assume that these head cuts ÖDLAND: THE MAKING OF SHIPIBO 45</page><page sequence="12">Fig. 4.11. Ceramie artists Delia (in front) and Petronila Cauper, contributing to Shipibo: The Movie of Our Memories. Caco Macaya, upper Ucayali River, Peru, 2010. Photo: N. Feldman. did not act as a serious deterrent to adultery. One must wonder whether a grandly scarred head was actually a badge of virility. The local treatment for the cut was piripiri herbs or boa fat. "Once the cut scarred over, on the next Anisheati, a man might go off and do the same thing again, and then submit to the very same punishment." However, spilling blood so visibly seemed to diffuse hostility. "Resolving the conflict this way they calm down not just the two men but also their families. The very act of seeing blood is calming," Bernabé Ventura said in our film. Tschopik's diary (1953: 3:5:53) notes, "All [men] own cushmas , bracelets, beaded collars which they produce on state occasions, as well as the short crooked "adulterer's knives" which all wear about their necks when dressed up." Despite this comment, none of these knives is worn visibly in his film. According to Girard (1958: 247), the Wisati ( weshati ) handle was covered with geometric figures and was always carried. School children at the bilingual school of San Francisco said that their fathers no longer owned the weshati. They had heard about these ritual fights, but they had never seen them and were upset by the fighting and bloodletting on the film. Their teacher Eli Sánchez Rodriguez explained in our documentary, noting the difference between the formal laws of Peru and the traditions of the native communities: "Now these things horrify us, they frighten us! Look what they used to do! How awful! So it's very hard for kids today to understand the old ways." Still, he pointed out, the weshati fight was an effective form of conflict resolution. "If we agreed about it, I believe it wouldn't be hard to live by those traditional rules. But we have disconnected ourselves from these cultural beliefs, and the old ways are gone." Part of the Anisheati celebrated a girl's puberty ritual. Tschopik's film showed the public portions of this ceremony: the circular mashá dance and the haircutting, called the Bëstëti Shrêati or "scissors cutting," where they cut the girl's bangs and change her clothing and adornments. Roe (1982: 40) presents an extensive study of the origins and symbolism of the girl's puberty ritual: "This was a major ceremony, which lasted for three days and involved much drinking of masato (lightly alcoholic manioc beer), dancing, singing, and fighting." While he notes an operation on the girl's genitals, other sources disagree as to exactly what was cut (see Mújica and Morales, in Alayza et al., 2002: 29; see also Belaunde, this volume). Because there is so much controversy about this procedure, it is possible that there were considerable historic and regional variations. Audiences in Santa Rosa commented on the puberty ceremony simply from a musical viewpoint. Today's children, 46 FIELDIANA. ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="13">Fig. 4.12.

They concluded, simply, that from today on, the girl could step out to dance with the other women, and they sang the following song (my transcriptions, 2007): We have finished the arrangements. We have finished the arrangements. We have beautified the girl. We have beautified the girl for a new life. It was difficult to address the puberty ceremony directly, possibly due to the presence of male translators and camera crew. Only women were ever allowed to witness this practice, which was done in private with close adult female relatives to perform the procedure and care for the girl. Inesa Diaz of Caco Macaya (Fig. 4.6) spoke on camera, sitting on a mat, and rubbing her leg in a way that was suggestive of some painful memory, but it was impossible to discuss the procedure directly. After midnight, she said, when the girl was thoroughly intoxicated with masato, her mother would sing this song to encourage her to be strong and brave. The following song was recorded and transcribed in 2010: ÖDLAND: THE MAKING OF SHIPIBO 47</page><page sequence="14">ato yame oshankin yamè Rechanpo, rechanki Tson noi bakebo Ikin, ikinbano. Go to sleep tonight Clitoris, clitoris, Whose is it, beloved daughter? I am with you, I will be with you. Hilda Amasifuén Picota recalled her older sister's haircutting at an Anisheati, with the sacrifice of a deer that they had raised, but she did not remember any operation on the genitals. One might think that had there been a radical procedure, she would have remembered hearing something about it from her older sister. She added, "Later it wasn't good for us to do all of this, but our ancestors thought that it would keep us from having extra-marital sex. But I think that the genitals were mutilated for jealousy" (my transcriptions, 2010). In Tschopik's film, the animal sacrifice follows the strength contests, the fights, and the puberty ritual. Little boys shoot arrows at a chicken that is tied by the foot to a kené- painted Shipibo cross. A group of women with painted hands and feet drag a domestic pig to the cross and tie it up, although, as informants pointed out earlier, the proper animal should have been a wild one, taken from the jungle when small and home raised. In our documentary, the elder José Roque Maynas laughed at the scene: "They didn't really used to sacrifice domestic pigs, but wild pigs and birds and sometimes monkeys. The monkey wasn't so popular, because it's like a human being. When they shot arrows at it, it tried to protect itself. So sacrificing a monkey isn't very good. But the other animals were fine. Everyone enjoyed it and laughed because it's Anisheati. Moreover, if anyone sacrificed a chicken, everyone would laugh at him; we preferred to have the sacrifice be of an animal from the jungle, not from the farm. We did not sacrifice animals like this pig." Men wearing decorated maiti, beaded chest orna- ments, chin ornaments, and with dabs of feathers stuck on their faces, shoot arrows at the pig until it falls. The women finish it off, beating it with clubs; they butcher it and cook it into a "beten" a stew of bananas, corn, and meat. In Tschopik's film, the stew was served communally, with women and men eating in separate groups seated on mats, from shared bowls, using their hands. Informants appeared to feel embarrassed by this and several carefully explained that in old days, they did not have spoons or forks. Conclusion What aspects of Shipibo culture shown in Tschopik's film occasioned the most audience discussion? In my transcriptions in 2007, 2008, and 2010, people spoke most frequently about the Anisheati and about Shipibo identity. Elders felt the loss of the customs they used to love. José Roque Maynas hoped to organize a full Anisheati and film all the proper preparations of an entire two-year production so that future generations would know the correct ritual. Ceramic artists feared that their traditional art would end with them since young people were no longer interested in learning or practicing these crafts. They spoke of the changes they have experienced in their environ- ment and of the need for and value of education for their children. Population growth has triggered changes in traditional customs and sources of food supplies, and resources of fish and game have become depleted. Uncontrolled development and road building have brought waves of invasive migrations of loggers, poachers, and poor settlers from highland Peru and from Brazil. Hunting with blowgun and dart is long past. Eakin (1986: 2) dated the latest usage of the blowgun to the 1950s. It had a romantic appeal to some schoolchildren, however. "For me, it would be better to live like our ancestors did, by growing their own food and hunting. Now see how our environment is contaminated," the student Lucas Angelo Valera Rodríguez said in our film. The large fish caught in Tschopik's film drew many envious comments on their size and availability. Professors at the school in San Francisco de Yarinacocha commented in our documen- tary that increased population has changed the environment of both the rivers and the land, and a traditional way of life was no longer viable. Abundant fish - big, choice fish - have disap- peared, and life now requires money, said Haroldo Inuma Macedo (my transcriptions, 2010). In the old days, audiences said, there was more collective work done, and the community shared meals. Women worked on their ceramics and textile arts together in family groups. Men felled trees, cleared land, and built houses together. Group fishing was done with huaca or barbasco , a native drug that stunned the fish in a huge harvest that provided protein for a whole community. Tschopik's (1955) article "Filming the Jungle Fishermen" described this bountiful catch in detail. These days, men feel the necessity to leave the community for outside work in order to have cash for things they did not need before. Eli Sanchez Rodriguez said in our film, Before, we didn't lack anything, we didn't lack vitamins, we didn't need pharmacies, and there was food on the table. And this other culture, the missionaries and religious people told us, but they do not know, they made us believe, that to drink masato was a diabolical thing. Or the Toé ceremony [a narcotic prepared from a species of Datura and used by shaman to produce visions similar to those of ayahuasca (Roe, 1982: 125)] or fishing with huaca: they may say it is poison, but for us, it's not! Now, [to feed our families] we have to bring in chicken, things from town or even more difficult. The influences and pressures of outside cultures and the sense of modern progress continue. The native communities in 2010 had basic local schoolrooms and a visiting health service provided by the national government of Peru. Some had a community telephone connection built by Spain and connected by satellite. A young man was designated by the chief to make or answer the extremely rare call and announce it over the village loudspeaker, all of which required a gasoline-powered electric generator to operate and local money for fuel. Some communities had a television monitor connected by satellite dish and, when fuel was available, powered by the generator for special events, such as the 2010 World Cup. Pepsi, Coca-Cola, Inca Cola, and packaged snack products had begun to reach the Ucayali villages though not yet those of the upper Pisqui (my field notes, 2007, 2010). 48 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="15">Fig. 4.13. Schoolgirls Ficcia Agustín, Jakelyn Juana Roque Valles, Nilda Valera Cumapa, and Rocío del Pilar Yui Inuma, contributing to Shipibo: The Movie of Our Memories , San Francisco de Yarinacocha, middle Ucayali River, Peru, 2010. Photo: N. Feldman. Most informants thought that modern education was vital for a promising future for their children. In our film, Priscila Maynas Romaina, the textile artist whose three children are finishing the university, expressed the hope that improved education would result in more Shipibo professionals, mayors, lawyers, and eventually members of Congress. Bilingual education was available at the Universidad Nacional Intercul- tural de la Amazonia, opened in 2000 and dedicated to indigenous Shipibo-Conibo students, and at the primary and secondary schools, such as that of San Francisco de Yarina- cocha, where boys and girls recorded their comments. In addition to typical school subjects, boys there learned how to cultivate yucca, bananas, and animal husbandry and no longer knew how to fish or hunt. The student Igor Ochavano Rucoba said in our documentary, weighing modern versus traditional life, "But even now the Shipibo way of life still exists in the upper Ucayali [River], not so much in San Francisco so close to the city of Pucallpa - [here] we can't practice so much, or maybe we are forgetting the traditional ways. I felt a little sad because the houses they lived in were just made of leaves and not safe; our houses are more modern. It might have been nice to live as they did, but life today is nice." Boys now preferred their masato chilled and thought today's music much better than the songs of 1953. In our film, the student Lucas Angelo Valera Rodríguez wanted the documentary to be screened on Lima Channel 2 TV because it had "the highest ratings" and because "people would be surprised by the video, how it shows things no one has ever seen. It may rescue our culture, and make it more popular, our beautiful culture." In their bilingual school, children also learned some of their ancestors' art and dances. The girls said that they continue to value their language, textiles, ceramics, dress, and food (Fig. 4.13). Students Ficcia Agustín and Jakelyn Juana Roque Valles planned to continue their studies to "make our families proud. Some of our families do not have much money, but they work for us and we will work for them. . . . We will preserve our Shipibo culture, keep it from being lost. We make artisan work to help ourselves and to preserve it." This is not always easy, Agustín said: "Some people are ashamed of being Shipibo. They don't speak their own language and don't identify with their own culture." In our documentary, the student Rocío del Pilar Yui Inuma summarized the feeling of most of the audiences: "It is important to recover our culture, and practice it, because if tomorrow we were to lose it, then what would become of us? That's why we must reclaim our customs and our beliefs. Wherever we go, we should identify ourselves as Shipibo and be proud of our culture. To belong to a Shipibo community means a lot to us, it is important." The names of all the elders, artists, community leaders, schoolchildren, and participating communities are listed in Appendix II. The movie premiered at the modern José Ignacio Aguirrezabal Municipal Library in Pucallpa in July 2011, with many of the informants attending as well as leaders of indigenous organizations. The completed production is avail- able in Spanish and Shipibo with Spanish subtitles and with English subtitles. The DVD containing both El Pueblo Shipibo and Shipibo : La película de nuestra memoria {Shipibo: The Movie of Our Memories) has been screened on Peruvian national television and distributed to the native communities, indigenous and human rights groups, and the educational system and museums of Peru.
