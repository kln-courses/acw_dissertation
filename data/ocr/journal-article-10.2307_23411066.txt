SA.35.95 Reviewed by Philippe Peltier Conservatory Section Oceania, Musée National des Arts d'Afrique et d'Océanie, Paris In the introduction to his book, and from the very first paragraph, Harry Beran brings up all the ques tions arising from the attribution to one sculptor of works dispersed in different collections since the beginning of the century: July 1997 121</page><page sequence="2">Mutuaga was a master carver who lived from about i860 to the early 1920s in the Suau region of the south-east Papua New Guinea. This book identifies him as a creator of more than eighty carvings, some of which have long been regarded as masterpieces of tribal art. In Mutuaga's case, the veil of anonymity that usually hides individual nineteenth-century Melanesian artists had been cast aside. For the first time, it is possible to name such an artist, to identify a substantial body of carving as his work, to show his personal style differs from the styles of other carvers, and how it changed during a lifetime of producing artworks. Most of his extant works have probably been locat ed and are illustrated here. (p.i) the colonists and white missionaries. Mutuaga invented a new type of object: a figure seated on a stool, which met a new demand. He thus produced all at once what the author designated as 'tribal art' (made by natives for natives) and ethnic art' (made by natives for whites). If the pertinence of this dis tinction remains to be proven — where is the exact limit? — it has the advantage of disclosing the com plexity of the facts. Many lime spatulae appear to have been carved solely for sale outside the culture. Thus this distinction seems more to hold for collec tors concerned to identify 'pure objects,' 'having a patina of use' or 'devoid of all external influence' than for the anthropologists for whom social dynamism is an important part of their studies or for art historians, since the output of 'classical' and 'modern' works seems of equal quality. It confirms nevertheless, that in all contact situations, products evolve rapidly. The aim is thus to identify an artist who lived at the beginning of the colonization of Papua, estab lish his recognition to promote him, a posteriori, as the incontestible master of a region of which the carvings are particularly sought after by collectors, to reconstruct a corpus of works dispersed in numer ous collections, and to recognize the variations of forms in the course of the development of his work. All these points raise important and numerous log ical or theoretical problems. The survival of the name Mutuaga stems from history and the conditions of colonization. He belonged to the language group Suau of the Massim region. His works were first collected by numerous colonists who lived in this region: Protestant minis ters, administrators -— often directly in contact with him — or just travelers. His works are to be found now in the great collections made at the beginning of the century, those which serve us today as funda mental references to sales catalogues. Mutuaga seems to have benefitted very early on from a great reputation largely promoted by Cecil Abel, the son of a pastor who grew up in Suau culture before teaching at Cambridge and who played on impor tant political role at the time of the independence of New Guinea. On the role played by the patrons of the sculptor, the author is alas, very brief. Because the work of Mutuaga comes at a time of change, part of his production escapes the use for which it was intended a few years earlier: exchanges of useful objects, specifically lime spatulae, in a par ticularly complex area. The art of this region, through its naturalistic forms, undoubtedly seduced All decisions require the establishment of a body of reference. Beran deals with these questions in the second and third chapters of his book. The author begins by limiting the corpus to the most represen tative objects — in other terms the most reproduced —of museum art. The "lime spatulae with human handles figures, lime spatulae with pug handles and human figures on bases that usually have legs" (p.13). The corpus is based on two collections, that made by F.G. Blacks of the Buffalo Museum of Sciences, and that of Cecil Abel, who knew the artist — when he was living at the mission of Kwato. From the for mer one can spot sixteen Mutuaga pieces, from the latter eight. To this basis he adds recollections gath ered in the field of Weibo Mamotroi, a man who knew the artists of that time. Then the author delim its the carvers who worked at the same time as Mutuaga. Eight specific traits are picked in order to establish seven sub-styles each represented by a 'Master.' All the carvings are reproduced and ana lyzed in the accompanying tables. The area studied is limited geographically. It covers the Trobriand Islands and the Suau region. A study larger in area risks having to modify the complexities of the facts. One encounters there, as the author recognizes else where, one of the limits of the study. To this geo graphical limit one can add two assumptions: at the interior of the Massim zone there exist specific, styl istic sub-regions; the artists have produced distinct forms in the production of human figures. The 122 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="3">forms are less individualized and more difficult to define than other types of objects, such as the spat ulae with canoe prow designs... a disturbing obser vation and one which raises the question of the 'hand' of the artist. This question of the 'hand' of an artist or of a characteristic style is debated in the fourth chapter. The author refers to the literature on the subject ini tiated by William Fagg or of Adrian Gerbrands and advances five criteria of attribution. Strangely, he makes no reference to any of the basic tests, which, in the "West, have permitted, since the end of the 19 th century, the reattribution ofWestern paintings, par ticularly of the High Renaissance, to their artists. These re-attributions, however, pose the same theo retical problems for the aposteriori constitution of a body of works attributed to a particular person. In other words, are the works known as being by Rembrandt, all the works of Rembrandt? But, from the moment one touches on the exotic' arts anoth er theoretical problem arises: are the respective 'hands' at work inventions of form by artists, and are these recognized as such in their society? Or are the forms specific to a particular group or clan, for example? In this case one can imagine that all the men of this clan can use these forms. Up to what point did the demands of the colonists perhaps modify the established social rules? Ail these ques tions are, alas, left hanging. And the author con cludes his chapter with a surprising indecisiveness: It would, therefore, be surprising if gifted artists, making art works of some design com plexity, did not develop a personal style. However, exceptions to this tendency do occur and if one identifies the distinct style of a number of artworks, one cannot take it for granted that they are by one hand. How extensive these exception are is not clear, nor have the exceptions mentioned been docu mented as fully as the artists who have devel oped a personal style. (p-56) In the following chapter, which deals with attri butions, the inquiry becomes one of investigative detection. The hypotheses are based on simple ele ments such as the decor in 'scrolls' (compare, for example, the evidence from a betel morter — pp.65—67), the form of eyes (p.68) or often quite simply on intuition. A classification with categories and sub-categories is proposed. It gets more com plicated as one goes along with the elements of ref erence multiplying. Then a chronology is sketched. But this is not without problems, for certain objects are not classifiable (they are generally the 'worst' pieces but, as the author reminds us, all artists have their 'malaria pieces'!) or the demonstration ends in contradictions such as: As already noted, Cecil Abel reported that the figure with almond-shaped eyes, but without eyelids, was brought to Kwati by Mutuaga shortly before 1920 and was then new. Yet fig ures with almond-shaped eyes and eyelids has dalready been collected between 1904 and 1906. However most examples of each style stage are likely to have been made within the periods suggested. (p.83) or in waverings such as this: The Drummer at Rest, with its flat, T-shaped face and semi-naturalistic body (Style varia tion i), can be attributed to Mutuaga because it fits the characteristics of a Jugenwerk per fectly, but the possibility of its creation by a predecessor cannot be excluded altogether." (p.84) In other words, what with sickness, an immature style, mediocre pieces and all other circumstances, anything is possible. There one reaches the limits of this type of exercise on which rests also a large part of the history of occidental art. But in Europe one always awaits conformation of written sources. That, in Oceania, is more often than not impossi ble, save for the rare, old museum catalogues or cat alogues of collections. In the present case there are fourteen well attested pieces. Apart from these, Harry Beran attributes 64 objects to Mutuaga. This attribution remains, however, hypothetical because the elements of attribution do not appear to be clear ly defined. This, in the present case, is complicated by the conditions and local practices of production and instruction of carving. At the same time, curi ously one sees reappear in this study old demons that have not been around for some decades. There is an example on page 101. In a long paragraph the author justifies his classification: July 1997 123</page><page sequence="4">But the classification would be misleading if it were taken to imply sharp and sudden changes in the style or quality of his work. In fact the development of Mutuaga's style is more gradual than the classification implies. The degree of naturalism gradually increases in the early part of his career, reaches a peak in examples of Styles Variations 3 and 4 and declines in some late examples of his work because some of the naturalistic detail is no longer carved. Otherwise, the naturalism' remains the standard of measure and the criterion for the classification and appreciation of the attraction of the works. The author goes even further when he affirms that the art of Mutuaga acknowledges this naturalism. His anthropomorphic sculptures are the most naturalistic in Massim art. No other sculptor carved figures with an equal range of natural istic details. (p-i03) At the risk of caricaturing, one thus reaches the following premise: in his time, Mutuaga was the most realistic artist in the whole Massim area, thus all the carvings of this period which show naturalis tic traits are attributable to Mutuaga. One can pose a simple question: and ask Mutuaga — or any other Massim artist — was he not restricted to this form of expression? Because even if the author admits (he does this in his conclusion) that the artist is verging on naturalism and stylization on the same piece, one can see the danger here of employing Western crite ria and applying them to an art which does not con form to these arrangements. Similarly, the argument advanced by the author to verify that the use of 'scrolls' (p. 103) can be inverted: to make of the "Master of the Falling Scroll" a follower of Mutuaga rests on the premise that Mutuaga is the incon testable source of all new forms. But the author goes still further in his conclusion as he attempts to trace, always using formal elements, a genealogical rela tionship between the artists. Certain Masters would be the Master of other Masters. The path to a school to which naturalism would be the key is thus open. The interest of Harry Berans' book perhaps lies elsewhere than in the reconstruction of the work of one artist (however passionately sought after). He shows, firstly, the limits of these kinds of studies (of which one could easily argue that they are still at a stage of indecisiveness). He then shows that the Massim area is stylistically more complex than is usually assumed, that it cannot be reduced, as authors of the art of New Guinea too often pro pound, to just that of the Trobriands. He also shows that the contact period was rich in adaption and invention, the work of Mutuaga is the perfect exam ple. He thus raises a series of questions both fasci nating and plentiful.
