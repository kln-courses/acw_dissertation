<plain_text><page sequence="1">[324] STRATIFICATION AND MODERN CHANGES IN AN ANCESTRAL CULT C. M. N. WHITE T HE present notes concern the Lwena, Chokwe, and Luchazi immigrants of the north-west of Northern Rhodesia, commonly referred to as the Balovale tribes.' Like other Central African Bantu they are animists, and their ancestors through the ancestral cult form an essential element in the community of the living and the dead. The spirits of the ancestors are of communal significance to the kinship group to which they belong, and they are also of individual significance to living individuals within a kinship group. The ancestral cult in its communal aspect, as, for example, in connexion with planting and harvesting, the birth and naming of children, and in the special status which it bestowed on the village head and the head of a kinship group, who invoked the ancestors on behalf of his kin, must be considered to be in a state of decay under modern conditions. The growth of individualism is rapidly undermining the com- munal observances of the ancestral cult, and the communal practices required by it are honoured more in the breach than in the observance. Some aspects of this side of the ancestral cult I have briefly described in African Studies.2 In contrast, however, the individual aspect of the ancestral cult has persisted more successfully, but only by undergoing a series of modifications which are rapidly changing it into a different form with the minimum of reference to the cult as origi- nally known. It is with this aspect of the impact of the spirits of the ancestors upon living individuals that these notes are concerned. THE TERMINOLOGY The verb saka found in the west central zone of Bantu languages might be ren- dered ' to heal or to treat a shortcoming of a physical nature '. It can thus cover not only diseases but infertility or failure as a hunter. The ill so treated is called a chisako and the cause of it is ascertained by divination. If the diviner ascribes it to an ances- tral spirit he says ' The spirit of your relative X has emerged in the form of such and such a lihamba '. A lihamba is thus a specific manifestation of an ancestral spirit making itself felt upon an individual. A lihamba is not the abstract conception of an ancestral spirit but its overt manifestation troubling one of its earthly kinsmen. References to the mahamba in the literature are scanty and none which I have traced appears to give a full explanation of the term. Melland3 calls them tribal spirits. This is not correct, since originally they were confined to their kinship groups, and although more recently they have been modified they were never tribal spirits. Gluckman4 quotes the names of several mahamba and calls them curative dances. This I For a fuller explanation of the term see the pp. 29-35. author's paper 'Witchcraft Divination and Magic 3 F.

Kayongo is a lihamba and not a disease. Baumann,I describing them among the Chokwe, calls the mahamba earth spirits and treats them as evil spirits. His account is the best which I have seen but leaves much unsaid. Hambly2 describes some ceremonies seen by him and appears to regard ovihamba as the name of the ceremonies. The Lwena, Luchazi, Chokwe, Lunda, and Mbunda all have mahamba, and Dr. Max Gluckman told me some time ago that the mahamba which he found among the Lozi had been borrowed from the Balovale tribes. Farther west in Angola the olondele of the Ovimbundu have much in common with the mahamba. Elsewhere in other tribes I have failed to trace any exact counterpart of them, and in particular Van Wing in his account of religion and magic among the Bakongo3 describes no comparable counterpart. The purpose of these notes is to try and trace some of the changes which the con- cept of mahamba has undergone, and to show that these can be correlated with other social changes. It will be well to point out that they refer to the Luchazi, Lwena, and Chokwe communities in the Balovale and Kabompo districts of Northern Rhodesia, since the changes which have occurred here need not necessarily have been exactly duplicated among the same tribes elsewhere. The derivation of the word lihamba is obscure; the root hamba-to go or travel- which occurs in south-eastern Bantu languages, is not found among these peoples except in a few derived verbs and there is no clear connexion between it and the name lihamba. Some of the individual mahamba have names whose symbolism and deriva- tion is clear and these are pointed out below, but I see no point in indulging in flights of dubious or bogus etymology if reliable derivations are lacking. An individual may have more than one lihamba and a single ancestor may emerge in the guise of more than one type of lihamba. If a person has a lihamba its existence is revealed by sticks driven into the ground, usually in front of his house. In the following account I propose to divide the mahamba into two main groups for his- torical reasons which will be set out. THE OLD MAHAMBA The oldest types of mahamba are commonly called mahamba vausoko, or kinship mahamba, since originally a lihamba was conceived of as only emerging in the matri- lineal kinship group to which both the living victim and the dead ancestor belonged. Originally there were no mahamba save kinship mahamba. Thus the deceased maternal uncle of a person might affect his niece or nephew as a lihamba since both belonged to the same matrilineal kinship group, but a lihamba belonging to the matrilineal kin group of his wife could not affect a man, though it might affect their children. The old mahamba can be conveniently assigned to two main groups with a few miscel- laneous ones classed together as a third. I H. Baumann, Lunda: bei Bauern und Jdgern in I934. Inner-Angola.

Female mahamba-mahamba valusemo (fertility mahamba) Women as a class in the community were the victims of a distinct series of mahamba which affected the female sex alone. The main ones were: Tembwa (Lwena, Chokwe), ntembwa (Luchazi), causes menstrual troubles and is derived from a female ancestor who was always bailing pools for fish. Kula (Lwena, Chokwe), nkula (Luchazi), is concerned with painful or prolonged menstruation, and is derived from a female relative who died a violent death especially involving the spilling of her blood. The root here is kula-to be sexually mature or full grown-which occurs in many words; for example, the tree Pterocarpus angolensis is called mukula because its red exudations are likened to menstrual blood. Kamayuwa (Lwena), Jinga (Chokwe), Nyambango (Luchazi), causes sterility; derived from a female ancestor who was a great dancer and wishes her female kin to carry on her fame and name. Tuta (Lwena, Chokwe), ntuta (Luchazi), causes babies to die at birth or be born dead and comes from a female ancestor who suffered from this misfortune. The name is derived from the root tuta-to take away-and plays a part in the lihamba symbolism. The giant rat (Cricetomys) is also called tuta because it takes food to store up in its burrow and the burrow of this rat is used in the ceremonies. Mboma causes failure to conceive or menstrual pains, and is derived from a female ancestor who suffered thus. The name mboma means a python and it is imagined that the lihamba has taken the form of a snake living in the womb of the victim. 2. Mahamba connected with hunting: mahamba vaunyanga These are derived from male ancestors who were hunters and most often affect males, though women may be affected. The main ones are: Chitapakasa (Lwena, Chokwe), Chitampakasa (Luchazi). This causes failure of a hunter. Although often it affects a hunter directly, it may work through a female relative who suffers illness also and is thus the unwitting possessor of the lihamba. Chitakai (Lwena), Chitakahya (Luchazi). Tambwe (Lwena, Chokwe), ntambwe (Luchazi). Although the old manifestations of these mahamba seem to have directly interfered with the success of a hunter, to-day, when hunters no longer play an important part in the community, they may cause illness. It is suggested that the hunting mahamba originated in a primitive community where all men were hunters, and only extended their activities to include women after cultivation replaced hunting. 3. Other mahamba A few other old mahamba fall outside these two classes. Kayongo (Lwena, Luchazi), ngombo (Chokwe). This may affect either sex and is derived from an ancestor who was a diviner and wishes a living relative to continue his profession. Tucker' gives an account of an Ocimbundu diviner who took up the profession after a deceased uncle, who had been a diviner, had affected him. Kayongo is one of the commonest mahamba to be found in villages to-day, a fact which shows how many persons must have plied the art of diviner in the past. So far as the L. S. Tucker, 'The Divining Basket of the Ovimbundu ', J. Roy. Anthrop. Inst., vol. lxx, No. 2, 1940, pp. 17I-201.</page><page sequence="4">STRATIFICATION AND MODERN CHANGES IN AN ANCESTRAL CULT 327 symptoms are concerned it is worth pointing out that the symptoms of malaria fit them in most cases. Chikuza (Lwena, Chokwe), Chikundza (Luchazi), may affect either sex and is derived from a relative who had been a masked chikuza dancer at puberty rites. The chikuza is one of the special ritual masks associated with the male puberty rites. Katotola (Lwena), Litotola (Luchazi), Ngondo (Chokwe), is likewise derived from an ancestor who had worn this mask at male puberty rites. It is not intended to describe the rites of exorcism in detail, for not only would it be tedious at this point but there is considerable variation in the details of the treat- ment applied by different 'doctors '. The study of the detailed ritual is, however, likely to be of great interest from the viewpoint of symbolism. Certain general features, however, are worth setting out. The lihamba is usually exorcized by a dance and drumming organized by relatives of the patient, and often lasting a full twenty-four hours or more. The assembled people address the lihamba by name in song, the song being usually very simple and little more than a refrain.The effect of this is to bring home to the lihamba that he has been recognized, and when this happens the lihamba responds by causing the patient to jerk and twitch. In such cases the patient often works himself into a remarkable emotional condition of excitement, with a glassy stare, violent perspiration, and even frothing at the mouth. As the exorcism continues the patient collapses exhausted from time to time and rests to recuperate. In the kamayuwa exorcism, the possession culminates in the patient leaping upon a fowl which has been tied up on the ground, and biting through its throat. On many occasions the exorcism falls into parts. The first dance accompanies the rite of lembeka. No beer is provided on this occasion, but at the end a lilembo is attached to the nape of the patient. The lilembo is a bunch of leaves of the castor-oil plant or muvangwa tree. Thereafter a period of about a month elapses, during which the patient must observe certain taboos, especially as regards food, after which a second dance is held accompanied by beer and the lembununa rite is performed to remove the lilembo. The food taboos are especially enjoined in connexion with the female mahamba and usually involve abstention from a number of types of meat. For example, in the kula rite the patient must abstain from bushbuck, situtunga, fresh meat with the blood still warm, fish with sharp teeth, and two other fish, musoji and kundu. In addition, the patient must wash with certain medicines by night, remain indoors in the morning and evening to avoid seeing the sunrise and sunset, and keep in the shade at noon. She may not draw water for herself. The 'doctor' (chimbanda) who treats a lihamba is always a woman if the lihamba is peculiar to women, a man if it is peculiar to men, but may be of either sex if the lihamba is common to both sexes. Although sticks are stuck in the ground after the rites, as a rule outside the house of the patient, neither the spirit nor the lihamba resides in these sticks. They are merely a token that the lihamba has been exorcized and a place at which libations can be made if there is any sign that the lihamba may return.</page><page sequence="5">328 STRATIFICATION AND MODERN CHANGES IN AN ANCESTRAL CULT It is, I think, important to distinguish between the ancestral spirit and the lihamba. The latter is an evil manifestation called up by the former. The ancestral spirit is an invisible creature who has no special residence in the village but is always with the community. In one sense he is associated with the earth, not only because the ancestors have a connexion with the fertility of the earth, as at planting and harvest- ing, but because he is approached through the earth. As noted above there is no beer at the lembeka rite, but there is beer at the lembununa rite and on this occasion beer is first poured on to the ground in front of the sticks as an offering to the ancestor. After this all may drink. The evil emanation, the lihamba itself, also has a connexion with the soil. In some cases the exorcism involves the digging of a trench through which the patient passes and repasses until she emerges leaving the lihamba in the trench. In the case of tuta, after the final washing of the patient with medicated water, the roots and herbs are cast into the burrow of a giant rat. In other cases the exorcism is performed outside the village, often at the junction of inter-village paths, in order that the lihamba may be left there and not return to enter the village; such a lihamba is conceived of as lying on the ground. Hence, as will be seen below, the new concept that a lihamba can be contracted by treading on it. Baumann called the older mahamba earth spirits and it seems that there is a clear link with the soil. It might not be fanciful to con- ceive of the mahamba as being called from the earth by the ancestral spirits and as returning to the earth after exorcism. Moreover, the ancestral spirits themselves have a connexion with the earth, and the Balovale tribes' originally conceived of the Supreme Being as linked to the earth and not as a sky-god. This is a field which needs more exploration and it is not proposed to speculate further at the moment. It seems clear that the original theory of the mahamba was that an ancestral spirit which felt that it was not receiving the attention to which it was entitled from its living kin, such as offerings, or following in its professional activities to preserve its fame, might emerge as a lihamba to draw attention to the fact. The purpose of the singing with the reiteration of the name of the lihamba is revealed as a means whereby the living assures the dead that he is remembered, and the jerking of the patient is the spirit's response, through the medium of the living, that he has heard them. The circumstances surrounding these mahamba are all primitive. The reproductive and sexual processes of women bulk most prominently. Then come the hunters. Fishermen, diviners, and dancers-including the ritual dancers of the puberty rites- also come in. The dead ensure that the living will riot neglect those accomplishments which are essential to the smooth running of their society. The functions of women and the activities of men were summarized in the mahamba which might emerge, and the background was a primitive society whose limited horizon was bounded by the kinship structure of a matrilineal society within which the mahamba were able to operate. With this as a starting-point one may turn to the more modern develop- ments which have taken place. THE NEW MAHAMBA The old mahamba still survive, though some of them are rarely heard of to-day, but a new series of mahamba with a different environmental background has emerged. I African Studies, loc. cit.</page><page sequence="6">STRATIFICATION AND MODERN CHANGES IN AN ANCESTRAL CULT 329 Moreover, the mahamba are being divorced from the ancestral cult and have become a theory of causation. The new mahamba are agents causing illness, and have no links with hunters or diviners. Women are overwhelmingly their main victims. In tracing the new mahamba I distinguish three periods of chronology; this is arbitrary and is solely based upon the dates of migrations of the immigrants into the Kabompo- Balovale area. PERIOD A. 1920-5. It was at this time that the first waves of Luchazi immigrants entered this area and to this period belongs the introduction of three new mahamba. Mahamba can now be acquired by infection or contact, such as eating out of a dish with an infected person, treading where a mahamba has been left or where an infected person has trodden. The sources of origin are the Songo and Chimbande neigh- bours of the Luchazi in Angola and also Europeans. Manyanga, a borrowing from the Chimbande, affects women, causing fainting and staring eyes; acquired by infection; not often heard of to-day. Visongo, said to be derived from the Songo, affects either sex with numbness in the legs, and is acquired by infection or might be due to an ancestor who had died in the Songo country. After treatment the lihamba emerges from the feet into a flat lwalo basket and is eventually emptied at the cross roads together with the remnants of medicine used. Vindele (' The Europeans ') mainly affects males and is said to be derived from a relative who had died in the European settled areas of Angola, especially one who had died in connexion with wars with the Europeans. The victim dreams of Euro- peangoods. When treated a house is built for the patient, chairs and a table are placed in it and a carpet of a blanket or quilt is spread on the floor. The patient dresses in European style; he dances, and eats off plates, with knife and fork, a meal cooked in Portuguese fashion, such as a fowl cooked with rice, tomatoes, and onion; he has his beer in a bottle and drinks it from a glass. The psychological processes behind this would be interesting to analyse. PERIOD B. I92 5-35. This was marked by the coming of Chokwe and Ovimbundu immigrants and further European culture contacts. Tukuka and Viyaya were brought by Chokwe immigrants; they emerge simulta- neously and are described as a male (viyaya) and female (tkukua). This curious duality produces swelling or twisting of the neck which may effect either sex and is usually acquired from an ancestor who died from such a condition. The Chokwe regard this as an old lihamba although Baumann thought that it was of recent origin. Chimbundu is acquired from a relative who has become infected with it during a visit to the Umbundu country. Either sex may be affected. Treatment involves the wearing of European clothes, eating off plates, and in particular the consuming of green string beans, and maize, characteristic of Umbundu diet. It will be noted that although Ovimbundu traders had visited these people with their trading caravans for many years previously, it was only when the Lwena and their allies started to visit Bihe that this lihamba arose. Kalunga (God). Either sex is affected, and the lihamba is derived from an ancestor who was killed by lightning. As I have shown,' Kalunga was not until recently an anthropomorphic god among these people but was often associated with natural African Studies, loc. cit. Aa</page><page sequence="7">330 STRATIFICATION AND MODERN CHANGES IN AN ANCESTRAL CULT phenomena as a force of nature. The ritual is therefore interesting, for the patient ascends to a platform, wearing a false beard of fibres from Aframomum roots, dances and sings, and splashes water from a basin on to himself and the onlookers with two fly-whisks. The onlookers exclaim that it is raining. The old Kalunga of natural phenomena who caused the lightning is here personified by the rain of splashed water; but the patient in his false beard is the God or Christ of the pictures in the religious books produced by the Catholic missions in Angola. A good example is found in Os Evangelhos dos Domingos e Festas para uso das Miss6es Catolicas do Planalto de Benguela. I do not know of any such illustrated books used by the evangelical missions in Angola. PERIOD C. In this period the process continues with several new mahamba. Vanyatumbunda affects women, causing a swollen stomach; it is acquired by infection and is said to have been introduced by Mbunda immigrants. But Mbunda had already entered the area much earlier and the history of this lihamba may be doubtful. Vazezu causes unsteadiness of the hands, was introduced by the Chokwe, and is acquired by contact. Kandundu. This affects either sex with illness and is acquired by contact. The history is confused. Treatment requires the patient to wear European clothes and wash in an enamel basin. This is another of the mahamba derived from European culture contacts. It is said that at Kubangu in Angola there was a trader who built a platform on a tower and used to mount it and then sing and dance. People thought that he had a lihamba which impelled him to do so and later decided that they might have contracted it. The old treatment involved climbing a pole on which was a plank as a cross-bar, a symbol of the platform on the tower. The present symbol often seen outside houses is a pole some twelve feet high with a short length of plank nailed horizontally across the top. The name of this lihamba is peculiar for kandundu is one of the olondele of the Ovimbundu, which, however, among the Ovimbundu, only affects babies and seems to have no connexion with the story cited above. Since I945 the mahamba have received some new accretions, both those noted being of a bizarre nature. Sitima (= steamer, the name used for a railway train in Northern Rhodesia). Derived from a relative whose death had been due to a train, it affects either sex. In a case recorded in 1948 a woman was observed shuffling on hands and knees on the ground emitting puffing noises. On her back were tied three long mutonga baskets which the other participants said symbolized railway carriages. Ndeke (aeroplane) is derived by infection from the settled areas where aeroplanes are often seen. The patient lies face down on a rough frame and extends arms and legs. The lihamba is said to cause a weakness of the legs which impedes walking. After treatment the patient erects a pole outside his house on which is placed a carved wooden aeroplane. It is clear from the foregoing that the mahamba have undergone a far-reaching revolution and have to a great extent been divorced from the old concept in the pro- cess. In the first place they are no longer closely associated in all cases with the ancestral cult. The results of other studies suggest that the last twenty or thirty years have seen considerable changes in the social organization of these people. The old</page><page sequence="8">STRATIFICATION AND MODERN CHANGES IN AN ANCESTRAL CULT 33I matrilineal kinship group no longer plays such an important part in providing the foundations of society, but is being replaced by the new moneyed individualism. The old mahamba were an essential part of the matrilineal kinship groups, which were communities formed of the living and the dead. To-day the dead are being for- gotten as economic individualism replaces mutual help and support among members of the matrilineal kinship group. The way is opened for the entry of new mahamba, based upon ignorance of the laws of cause and effect and the greed of opportunists. For, on the one hand, the new mahamba provide a species of logic to supply an answer to the question 'why' in cases of illness. And at the same time the diviner, or doctor, preserves his means of livelihood by inducing his credulous fellows to accept these new explanations for their ills; thus he continues to draw his fees although the old kinship mahamba have lost their status. The new mahanba have an economic origin in more ways than one. Again the new mahamba are a mirror of culture contact. The old mahamba belonged to a period of African history when the tribal community lived a life of constant raiding. Its horizon was limited to its kinship group. But with the coming of peace men became able to travel safely and widely. So strangers or their countries were blamed for the diseases which afflicted others, or new mahamba were borrowed from neighbours. It might be suggested that the ancestors had never been fully accepted as a convincing explanation of evil, and once men could travel more freely, their scepticism of the ancestors came to the surface and they tended to blame the living in strange countries. Then came the European culture contacts and, if the dates of the developments in new mahamba are taken into account, it appears that the coming of the Lobito railway line to Vila Luso about 1928 coincides with an increasing ten- dency to ascribe mahamba to the Europeans. It may well be that European labour working on railway construction and the many more who came after were responsible for this. Finally, the modern mechanization and industrialization of Central Africa has reached out into rural villages with the railway train and aeroplane mahamba. The elements which went to make up the new mahamba provide a remarkable cross-section of culture contacts in Africa, and show how dynamic is African society in absorbing and adapting its new contacts. But African education lagged behind and these new contacts give rise to new superstitions. There is a further aspect of the new mahamba which deserves a word. In a former paper' I tried to trace the evolution of attitudes among the Balovale tribes to witch- craft and pointed out that one effect of European administration and its prohibition of the killing of witches had been the practice of curing witches by emetic. Yet it is now nearly nine years since a case of the emetic treatment came my way and it would seem that the new mahamba are to a great extent fulfilling the need for a theory of causa- tion and helping to eclipse the old belief in witchcraft. The new mahamba explain the otherwise inexplicable in the sphere of sickness and disease for people who have no scientific knowledge. One might say that the old ideas of witches and their vandumba familiars are giving place to a world of vague disembodied emanations which may be caught by infection; thus the old world of superstition and the gradually spreading knowledge of infectious diseases are passing through a strange phase of synthesis. At any rate the mahamba of to-day are a far cry from those of the past. I Africa, vol. xviii, No. 2, 1948, pp. 8I-104.</page></plain_text>
