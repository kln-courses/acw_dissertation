<plain_text><page sequence="1">hI?I?^^ Jordan's Stonehenge: The Endangered Chalcolithic/ Early Bronze Age Site at al-Muraygh?t-Hajr al-Mans?b ? Stephen H. Savage ???????????? Introduction Archaeologists define a "ceremonial fondscape" as a group of stone and/or earthworks constructed on a scale large enough to effectively create a kndscape. Perhaps the best known example is Stonehenge, with its great circle of standing stones sur rounded by earthworks. A ceremonial L?ndscape effectively creates views from specific places toward other places that are considered to be important due to their natural location or associations with ritual activities, such as mortuary or sacrificial rites or astronomi cal functions. The ceremonial hndscape of Chakolithic and Early Bronze Age Jordan (table 1) is unique in the Near East, although it bears a striking resembknce to that of Western Europe and the British Isles during a sim?ar period. Perhaps, for that reason, early travelers to Jordan were impressed by the thousands of dolmens (prehistoric monuments of two or more upright stones supporting a horizontal stone skb, which may have functioned as tombs or sites of primary interment prior to secondary burial elsewhere), menhirs (standing stones), stone circles, and alignments. Table 1. Approximate Chronology of the Chalcolithic Period and Early Bronze Age in Jordan Archaeological Period Duration (years b.c.e.) Early Bronze IV 2300-2000 Early Bronze III 2700-2300 Early Bronze II 3000-2700 Early Bronze I 3600-3000 Chalcolithic 4500-3600 Following reports from these early travelers, especially Irby and Mangles (1817-1818) and Conder (1881), archaeologists have continued to examine many of these structures. Recent discussions include Dubis and Savage 2001; Herr 2002; lian 2002; Kafafi and Scheltema 2005; Mortensen and Thuesen 1998; and Palumbo 1998. Many dolmen fields have been mapped, and a few individual dolmens have been excavated. The function of dolmens is still a matter of discussion among archaeologists. Later in this issue of EA, Al-Shorman notes that dolmens are thought of as being "habitations, altars, or offering places..., winter camps for transhumant groups..., places for exploiting varied environmental zones..., or tombs" (2010, 46-47). New methods of archaeological analysis have been used to study the relationship between dolmens and their natural settings, in hopes of helping to determine how these enigmatic structures functioned. Al-Shormans spatial analysis of dolmen sites in Jordan indicates that they share some common traits: hillside terrace locations where large megalithic stones are readily available. Enough dolmens contained skeletal remains to suggest to Prag that "the dolmens of Jordan ... are the normal form for disposal of the dead of a large part of the population over a long period" (1995, 83). However, Al-Shorman's study casts some doubt on Prag's general conclusion, on the basis of the low number of Early Bronze I habitation sites (fifty-one in the Jordan Archaeological Database and Information System [JADIS)]) compared to dolmens (about twenty thousand). Al-Shorman suggests that a population of this size is beyond the carrying capacity of the region in the Early Bronze Age. However, twenty thousand dolmens built over a period of four hundred years means only fifty a year, which does not seem to require a large population. Moreover, the JADIS database underrepresents the number of habitation sites from the Early Bronze I period. Many sites are simply labeled Early Bronze Age on account of the difficulty of determining specific subperiods based on ceramic evidence, since diagnostic sherds from the Early Bronze I period were either not found or not recognized. There are many more sites in the later Early Bronze Age subperiods, so it is possible that the landscape could have supported a larger number of people. It is also possible that dolmens were used as temporary burial places. The large, charnel house burial places at Bab edh Dhra (Schaub and Rast 1989) contain many secondary burials: interments where the body is first buried elsewhere, with the bones being bundled together and placed in a secondary location for permanent burial. Al-Shorman further notes that some of the other possible interpretations of dolmens may not be testable due to the lack of data and that further survey and excavation are needed. Thus, it is especially troubling that archaeologists are now faced with the rapid destruction of Jordan's megalithic heritage. Kafafi and I ...... ~</page><page sequence="2">I Theories in Archaeology Today I Scheltema have lamented that, "Whereas nineteenth-century visitors spoke about thousands of dolmens, suggesting that modern day Jordan was at that time still the most densely dolmen-covered part of the Mediterranean, considerably less than a thousand in all seem to remain fairly intact nowadays" (2005, 8). Rapid population expansion following the first and second Iraq wars have spurred an unprecedented pace of urban and infrastructure development in Jordan. Dolmen fields are under attack directly by urban expansion, as well as by stone and gravel quarries. Examples include the Damiyah dolmen field, which is currently endangered by a travertine quarry (Gerit van der Kooij, personal communication; Scheltema 2008, 115), Rawdah, Adehmeh and the dolmen field at al-Muraygh?t (Scheltema 2008, 115; Dubis and Savage 2001; Savage and Rollefson 2001). Dolmens that had stood in Tila' al-'Ali, in western Amman, along Sharra Street, have very recently been removed for construction of a multistory commercial and residential building. This article focuses on the site of al-Muraygh?t (a.k.a. el-Megheirat, el-Mareigh?t, Mugheirat), which has been called "Jordan's Stonehenge" (Harrison, personal communication) because of the striking character of its dolmen field and configuration of menhirs and megalithic structures. Although unique, the site is currently in imminent danger of complete destruction from rapidly expanding gravel quarries. Al-Muraygh?t is a large site southwest of Ma'in consisting of a series of circles and rectangles of standing stones (menhirs) with cobblestone floors, an expansive menhir and dolmen field that extends over 80 ha (ca. 198 acres), and a sherd/lithic scatter that stretches across approximately 25 ha (ca. 62 acres; fig. 1). The dolmen field is concentrated mostly on hills to the west of the central knoll, but there are also dolmens on the hills to the south and north. The ceremonial center of the site occupies a low denuded hill with very little soil between bedrock terraces; two concentric circles of fallen menhirs are within line of sight of almost all the extant dolmens at the site. The larger site is spread across an area containing agricultural fields, which indicates some soil depth. Other, unplanted areas near the road from Ma'in reveal approximately 1.5 m of gray, midden-like soil containing numerous artifacts. The site is located partly within a large gravel quarry whose excavation is currently destroying the hills upon which the dolmen field is located and northeast of a more recent gravel quarry that threatens to expand into the western edge of the site. Ceramic evidence demonstrates that al-Muraygh?t was occupied during the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age, though there are indications that it was used over a much longer period of time. An Epipaleolithic component in the stone tools (Savage and Rollefson 2001) indicates when the site was first used; the dominant ceramic forms are from the EB I. Other researchers have indicated that a Chalcolithic component and possibly an EB III/IV component are present as well, although a surface collection I conducted in 2000 did not identify ceramics from these periods. A small Roman/Byzantine component is also present. The site is currently cultivated, and, in summer months, it is occupied by migratory pastoralists. It is therefore subject to damage from agriculture, erosion, vandalism, and, especially, by the expansion of gravel quarries located to the southwest and northeast of the site. This article will describe the discovery of the site, its configuration and artifact assemblage, and discuss the impact on the site of ongoing gravel quarrying in the vicinity. Early Reports from al-Muraygh?t The first description of al-Muraygh?t comes from Charles Irby and James Mangles, two commanders in the British Royal Navy who, in 1817 and 1818, were the first Westerners to openly visit the interior of the Levant since the Crusader period. Following Nelson's defeat of Napoleon's naval forces at the Battle of the Nile (1798) and William Sidney Smith's successful defense of Acco in 1799, the Royal Navy had acquired such a level of prestige with the Ottoman Empire that Irby and Mangles were able to secure permission to tour the region. Like many Royal Navy officers of the time, they probably went to sea in Figure 1. Three-dimensional view of the al-Muraygh?t region showing distribution of dolmen field and active gravel quarries near the site.</page><page sequence="3">3 their early teens, if not before, following a brief general education (see O'Brian 1995). Once at sea, as "young gentlemen," they were expertly trained in a specific set of skills, including gunnery, ship handling, command, and celestial navigation. They learned to write good, detailed reports. Their ideas about ancient history, however, were informed by the Old Testament, based on Ussher's six-thousand-year chronology; their cultural outlook was framed by late Georgian and pre-Victorian mores and the indisputable supremacy of the Royal Navy. Although they had the permission of high Ottoman officials to travel in the region, the trip was full of incidents?as Irby and Mangles moved further into the interior, the fractious tribes paid less attention to Ottoman authorities. It was a dangerous journey, the adventure of a lifetime. Their report, published in a series of extended "letters," remains a fascinating read. On June 9, 1818, Irby and Mangles crossed the Wadi Wala, moving northward, and noted the standing stones there. They camped that night near Ma'in and rode down toward the hot springs the following morning: We engaged a guide from our tents, who undertook to carry us to the sources of hot^water; our route was S. W.; in less than half an hour we reached another tall stone, set up apparently as a boundary mark, like those in the Wady^el^Wale [Wadi Wala]. The direct track is continued from this first, round the southern side of a rocky knoll rising to some height, and in a great measure detached from the surrounding hills. Some remarkable objects, of which we got a glimpse, induced us to pass round on the other side of this knoll; they are rude sepulchral monuments of the same nature with those we discovered on our road from Szalt [Salt] to the Jordan on our last tour; yet, as the former are rude throughout, without any mark whatever of the tool about them, whereas the others have universally a door in one of the smaller ends, it is possible that they may date from a remoter period, or have belonged to a still ruder people. Their proportions vary considerably, as does their aspect, though the construction is uniform; one flat stone is laid in at the bottom, and this there can be little doubt covers the grave of the deceased; and, as there is no appearance of the tombs ever having been violated, it probably protects them to this day. They would be a highly interesting object for excavation, as it might possibly lead to the ascertaining of the form of some of the weapons and warlike apparel mentioned in Scripture. It is worth noticing, that however remote may be the period to which these sepulchers are to be referred, the stature of those contained in them, is so far from gigantic, that it seems to have amounted to no more than the middle size of modern times. Not only this rocky eminence, upon which we first observed them, is covered over on all sides with these barbarous structures, but some few are scattered in the fields upon a lower level, and a great many upon the sides of the surrounding hills, insomuch that not less than fifty were in sight at one time. (Irby and Mangles 1985, 465-66) Irby and Mangles apparently did not stop long at the site, and they did not record its name. Nevertheless, they observed several salient features about it that make it clear that it was al-Muraygh?t. First, they recognized the isolated menhir to the east of the site as marking its boundary. It is a famous stone named by the local tribes and marked with tribal glyphs, but that information was not recorded for another sixty-three years. They recorded the presence of many dolmens arranged on the hills surrounding a central hillock, although they did not seem to have gone up onto it but traveled around it on the north side instead of taking the established track on the south. Instead, attracted by the dolmens, they followed the narrow, dry watercourse that separates the central knoll of al-Muraygh?t from the taller hills where most of the dolmens are located (this path can still be traced today; fig. 1 clearly shows the road to the south of the central knoll and the path Irby and Mangles took to the north of it). Their ideas about the dolmens were quite speculative, including that they contained burials under flat stones laid at the bottom. Our 2000 and 2001 investigations (see further below) showed that the dolmens rest primarily on bedrock. Irby and Mangles did not mention the structures on the central knoll. Claude Reignier Conder recorded a more extensive description of the site in 1881. Conder was a major (later colonel) in the British Army attached to the Survey of Western Palestine on behalf of the Palestine Exploration Fund. He was a keen observer, a skilled surveyor, and an artist; he spoke Arabic and wrote extensively on the archaeological sites of the southern Levant. He recorded the name of the site as "El Mareigh?t ... 'the things smeared,' with oil, or blood, or other thick liquid" (Conder 1889, 184), which he connected to an ancient practice of anointing or smearing menhirs, either with blood or with oil, the former being a ceremonial custom of the pre-Islamic Arabs, the latter a very ?jp Mareigh?t group is perhaps the most extraordinary and suggestive monument yet described in Moat&gt;^ ' J</page><page sequence="4">3 ancient practice in connection with menhirs. Although he had already visited many dolmen fields in Jordan, Conder thought that "the Mareigh?t group is perhaps the most extraordinary and suggestive monument yet described in Moab" (Conder 1889, 189). His description of the site is worthy of extensive quotation: The site of el Mareigh?t includes rude-stone monuments extending over an area of about a mile east and west, and half a mile north and south, on the ground at the top of the steep bank north of the 'Ain ez Zerka [Zarqa Ma'in]. These include a large series of menhirs, surrounded on west, north, and east by dolmens, a single menhir further east called Hajr el Mansub ("the erected stone"), and a wine press east again; while other dolmens occur north of the "erected stone," and hollow chambers in the cliff, north of the principal menhir centre. ... The single menhir, Hajr el Mansub, or "the erected stone," is the most evidently artificial of all the rude-stone monuments found as yet east of Jordan. Its rounded top and the groove cut in one side, show, as does its rectangular cross-section, the handiwork of man. It is 8 feet high, 4Vi feet wide at the base, and varies in thickness from 23 inches to 15 inches. The groove is 3 feet 9 inches from the ground, 9 inches wide, and 1 Vz deep. The bearing along one side of the stone is 48?, or about north-east. There are several tribe-marks on the stone, two on the southeast face, above the groove, being those of the 'Abb?d fAdw?n) and of the Khadir ('Anazeh), while the "raven's foot," or "trident" of the Jibbur (Beni Sakhr), also occurs with others. These might be easily mistaken for some kind of letter or rune, but there is no doubt as to their meaning and origin, while close inspection shows the marks to be recent. West of the Hajr el Mansub there are two low knolls at the top of the bank, which falls to the spring 1,000 feet beneath; from them, and from the Hajr, the spring can be seen. These knolls extend westwards about half a mile, and are covered with dolmens. On the south and west sides of the western knoll, and all round the eastern, these occur, and some are very fine examples. There are none on the north of the west knoll; the total number was counted to be about seventy. Immediately west of the west knoll there is a sort of little plateau about a quarter of a mile square, and rather lower than the plateau of the Hajr el Mansub. It is surrounded by a sort of amphitheatre of low spurs, on all sides but the south, where it reaches the brink of the great slope or bank of the ravine. In the middle of this little theatre rises another small and very rocky knoll, and its summit is crowned by a group of very conspicuous menhirs, while round the foot of the knoll runs a circle of smaller menhirs about 300 yards in diameter. The boundary of the plateau on the east is marked by a line of menhirs running approximately north and south, and there are traces of another line running westwards from this, along the brink of the valley bank at the south edge of the little plateau. East of the group on the knoll there are three or more alignments of menhirs running parallel, approximately north and south. The plateau on the south side of the knoll is strewn with other small menhirs without any order, and on the northwest side of the 300 yards circle, close to the menhirs, there is a dolmen standing alone. The hill spurs to the north, and to the west of the plateau, are also strewn with dolmens, and it was calculated that, including the seventy on the two knolls west of the Hajr el Mansub, and those north of it, there are at least 150 dolmens at this site. The menhir groups, as above described, thus form a circle 300 yards diameter, and a square about 500 yards side, or more. Those on the top of the knoll are about 5 feet high, the tallest being 6 feet. They seem to have been arranged in a little circle 15 paces (40 feet) in diameter. The three alignments to the east are 12 paces apart, and 20 paces long north and south, and are about 50 yards from the group on the Mareigh?t knoll. The row on the south side of the plateau is traceable about 30 yards, the stones often touching each other. The tallest is 6 feet, and the average about 3 feet. North of the circle, in the side of the hill, is a little cliff pierced with three chambers well cut. The western was 3 feet wide, 4 feet to the back, the central one 6 feet by 7 feet, the eastern 2 feet by 3 feet. These resemble the chambers found elsewhere with dolmens. (See el Kurmiyeh, and el Kal??.) This spur has about 40 dolmens on its west side, and 20 on the east, which are included in the former total estimate of 150 dolmens. There are, beside the dolmen adjoining the circle on the north-west, two hollows in the flat rock, each 1 Vi feet in diameter, and 6 inches deep. (Conder 1889, 185-89)</page><page sequence="5">3 Later Observations at al-Muraygh?t Nelson Glueck considered the Hajr al-Mans?b and al-Muraygh?t as two distinct sites, assigning them site numbers 81 and 82 in the first volume of his Explorations in Eastern Palestine (1934, 33; 1939, 137). He spelled Conder's "el Mareigh?t "as "el-Megheir?t." Beyond mentioning the stone and the dolmen field, Glueck confined his observations to noting that Mallon, Koeppel, and Neuville collected a number of Chalcolithic sherds (Mallon, Koeppel, and Neuville 1934, 155, pl. 63:4-9) and that de Vaux had collected "a large number of EB IV-MB I sherds" (Glueck 1939, 137-38). The next recorded visit to the site occurred in the early 1990s, when Harrison reported that Chalcolithic sherds were dominant, with a possible EB presence (1997, 29). In 1999, Savage, Harrison, Griffith, Elder, and Graham visited the site and confirmed Chalcolithic sherds (and one possible EB ledge handle) near the middle of the central knoll. The EB IV-MB I (now referred to as EB III?EB IV; see Harrison 1997, 29) sherds found in the region may be associated with the dolmen and menhir field, as these structures are sometimes associated with the EB IV period (although more often with the EB I, which was borne out by our subsequent work at the site). The reuse of an important Chalcolithic ceremonial site by people nearly two millennia later clearly points to the continuing significance of the place. Palumbo (1994, 2:58) gave "El Mugheirat" the site number 2111002 in the JADIS database; the "Hajar el-Mansub" was assigned number 2212012 (2:90). In both cases, Palumbo noted that the locations provided were only approximate. Georeferenced QuickBird imagery provided by Digital Globe for this study indicates that al-Muraygh?t was located in JADIS more than 3 km northeast of its real location, while the Hajr al-Mans?b was more than 5.5 km too far to the northeast, on the other side of Ma'in. Al-Muraygh?t and the Moab Archaeological Resource Survey The Moab Archaeological Resource Survey (MARS) project was established to collect settlement, archaeological, and environmental data from the western part of the Madaba Plain in the highlands of central Jordan. The field program for this long-term project includes detailed mapping, surface collections, and test excavations at known archaeological sites and pedestrian survey of the western Madaba Plain to discover additional sites. The project has concentrated its research to date at Khirbet Qarn al-Qubish, an EB I?III fortified agricultural village northwest of Madaba, and at al-Muraygh?t. Investigations at al-Muraygh?t were carried out in 2000 and 2001. During the 2000 field season, we mapped the locations of the menhirs on the central knoll and conducted a controlled, random, stratified surface collection in 10 m squares. We recorded and photographed seventy-five dolmens. During the 2001 season we photographed the Hajr al-Mans?b, recorded an additional twenty-five dolmens and photographed the ongoing quarry operations to the northeast of the site. Since then, al-Muraygh?t has been visited by several archaeologists in order to document the site's condition and further damage to it by the quarry. In addition, satellite images from the 1960s onward have been acquired, which have enabled the project to monitor the expansion not just of the original quarry but of two others as well. Below I will present a brief summary of our fieldwork, starting with the Hajr al-Mans?b, then continuing to the central core at al-Muraygh?t and the dolmens. Finally, I will discuss the ongoing quarrying activity at the site. The Hajr al-Mansub Although Conder describes an olive press of a later period as the eastern edge of al-Muraygh?t, the Hajr al-Mans?b is the probable boundary of the ceremonial complex, a fact recognized as early as Irby and Mangle's first description of the site. From the location of the Hajr one can see virtually all the dolmens still extant at the site. There is nothing at al-Muraygh?t to indicate any connection with olive processing, so Conder's olive press probably postdates al-Murayghat. The stone still stands in the middle of a wheat field south of the quarry near the intersection of two important tracks: the road from Madaba to the Ma4in hot springs and the road down to the floor of the Zarqa Ma'in. There has been considerable soil erosion near the base of the stone in the past century, which may have rendered it unstable (compare figs. 2-4). Conder's original drawing (fig. 2) and his description quoted above indicate that the groove in the stone was 3 ft by 9 in from the surface. Figure 3 shows the reverse side of the stone, but the groove can still be seen; it is now five or more feet above the surface. Figure 4, which was taken before February 2004, shows that the stone was leaning at that time. Figure 3 was taken in July 2007 and shows the stone in a more upright position. His Excellency Ambassador H. G. Scheltema (personal communication), formerly the Dutch Ambassador to Jordan, indicated that local farmers had recently set the stone upright again. This is a clear indication of its continued importance to the local population (especially when compared to other areas, such as the Wadi Wala, where the menhirs near Khirbet Iskander that were mentioned by Irby and Mangles have been deliberately toppled in recent years). Scheltema notes that "Jaussen and Savignac pointed out the phallic form of the standing stone." But, he continues, "the clearly incised semi-circular groove on one side of the stone could, on the other hand, also have had an anthropomorphic meaning" (2008, 102). The Central Core of the Site The low bedrock hill that dominates the site was the focus of our research effort in 2000 (fig. 5). There are several structures on the hill made up of outlines of megalithic rocks (probably columns or column bases), with cobblestone floors (figs. 6 and 7); some of the standing stones are more than 2 m high. The initial impression of the site is that the megaliths form a series of concentric circles focused on a central ring (now all knocked down) about 10 m in diameter at the top of the site. Conder's report is somewhat</page><page sequence="6">&lt;&lt; Figure 2. Conder's (1998,186) drawing of the Hajr al-Mans?b. Figure 3. Tim Harrison at the Hajr al-Mans?b in July 2007.

NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 73:1 (2010) 37</page><page sequence="7">3 ambiguous on this point, first describing a circle of smaller menhirs 300 yd. in diameter, then stating that the menhir groups he described form a circle 300 yd. in diameter. In 2000, the local farmers told us they had set up stones around a driveway they built up to the central core. The casual visitor to the site is struck by the stones set up along the driveway, leading to the interpretation that the other standing stones are part of a series of smaller concentric rings within the larger one; the clear presence of two concentric rings at the top of the knoll reinforces this impression. However, Conder does not seem to mean one circle 300 yd. in diameter but that there were groups of menhirs in an area of this size. Rather than a series of concentric circles of standing stones, there is a group of large structures on the central core of the site, which became more apparent as we examined and mapped the individual standing stones. Most are located on the top and the less steep western side of the central hill. The standing stones form a series of structures; at least eleven can be discerned. There were probably others, but the area on the west side of the central hill that lies between a modern catchment basin and the discernable structures has been the location of a Bedouin encampment. It is possible that evidence of additional structures was removed from this area when the surface was cleared for their tents. Outside the Bedouin encampment, where there is a wide area of relatively flat soil or bedrock, the stones tend to be arranged in large ovals. However, because the bedrock is stepped, when structures were placed near one of the steps, they are frequently rectangular, with the long walls running parallel to the bedrock steps. The stones tend to be higher on the lower steps. Most of the structures have rough cobblestone pavements. At the highest part of the central hill there is evidence of a unique structure (fig. 8). Here two concentric circles appear to form a central "shrine" with a cobble pavement. These stones have fallen, but it is clear that they once supported a small circular structure. The outer ring of stones is approximately 8-10 m in diameter, the inner ring about 4 m across. Almost all of the dolmens mapped at the site are within line of sight of this central Y Figure 5.

In spite of the proximity of the stones that make up the uprights on the central part of the site to the layered bedrock across the small wadi used by Irby and Mangles, it is clear that considerable effort must have been expended to pry them out of the bedrock terraces and to bring them down the western hill, across the wadi, and up onto the central hill of the site. Since the sherd and lithic scatter is spread across an area of about 25 ha, but the megalithic structures themselves are restricted (excepting the Hajr al-Mans?b, a special boundary stone) to an area of about 1.6 ha (ca. 4 acres) on the central hill, it is clear that this part of the site represented a place of special meaning to the inhabitants of the area. In conjunction with the large dolmen fields that face the central hill, it clearly appears to form a ceremonial precinct. Dolmens The MARS survey has mapped approximately one hundred dolmens in the area around al-Muraygh?t (in 1881, Conder estimated there were 150). Most of them are located on the slope of the hill immediately to the west of the central hill, across the small wadi. The exceptions include a single dolmen on the southwest slope of the central hill itself, two on the hill further to the south, and seven on or near the hill northeast of the central hill (placing them north of the Hajr al-Mans?b; see fig. 1). All but one of the dolmens are of the same type, with back and top stone slabs (see Dubis and Savage 2001). Most of the dolmens have rock-slab floors (in fact, bedrock), though a few have earthen floors, and one has a cobblestone floor. Most have open entrances, but one has a slab on the right side (looking in) that may have been a blocking stone. With few exceptions, the dolmens face east, northeast, or southeast, which can be explained by the side of the slope on which they were built: none faces into the hill. Several have a stone "circle" that fences them off from the rest of the field, and Dolmen 17, shown in figure 9, has a double circle around it. Many of the dolmens are damaged. Some are in a state of complete ruin, while others have one side collapsed, and many are missing their capstones. We have found very few artifacts associated with the dolmens we have investigated to date. Ceramics are especially rare. Lithic material in their vicinity tends to be nondiagnostic, although there often were large chert cobble/ cores in association with the dolmens. Other lithic artifacts in the vicinity of some of the dolmens include flakes, scrapers, ad hoc blades, and other manufacturing debris. Unfortunately, most of the dolmens were built on bedrock, and their floors were clean. We noted no human remains near them. The lack of diagnostic</page><page sequence="9">3 * s .... Figure 8. The ceremonial core of al-Muraygh?t; the two rings of concentric stones at the highest point are shown under the arrow. All of the dolmens are within line of sight of this feature. Photograph by H. G. Scheltema; used by permission. artifacts makes estimating their age problematic. Based on the ceramic evidence from the rest of the site, an EB I date is likely; however, other researchers have reported EB IV material from al-Muraygh?t, so a later date cannot be ruled out. Ceramics As noted above, previous visits to al-Muraygh?t by a number of archaeologists have resulted in the identification of several different ceramic components. These include sherds from the Chalcolithic, EB I, EB III, and EB IV periods. Our controlled surface collection recovered ceramics from EB I, EB II/III (?), Roman/Byzantine, Ottoman, and modern periods (fig. 10; Savage and Rollefson 2001, 225-28). The EB I period clearly dominates the ceramic assemblage. Most of the diagnostic pieces are from bowls/platters or jars. Bowl types include wide, shallow basin forms and small serving bowls of simple profile and deeper forms with a more complicated rim profile; some of these have finger or stick impressions below the rim. Diameters range between 15 cm and 30 cm for the EB I types. A single sherd from a bowl with a slightly outcurving rim may date to the EB II/III period. Jars include typical holemouth forms, some with finger impressions above the shoulder; these tend to have openings in the 25 cm range, which implies a relatively large jar. Other jar forms include Figure 9. Two dolmens from al-Muraygh?t. Photograph by H. G. Scheltema; used by permission. smaller, restricted forms with slightly outcurving rims in the 15 to 20 cm diameter range and rolled rim storage jars. The ceramic assemblage at al-Muraygh?t is dominated by small jars and bowls, with the occasional storage vessel; "lime coated" sherds seem entirely lacking. Ledge-handled jars are well-represented at the site. According to Amiran (1970, 35-40), the plain type (also called "duck-billed" and sometimes "axe-blade") is most characteristic of the EB I period. Duck-billed forms are well-represented at al-Muraygh?t (fig. 10:1-4). Interestingly, several additional treatments on this form might suggest a developmental sequence during the EB I period. Figure 10:1 illustrates a plain duck-bill form. Figure 10:2 is also duck-billed in shape, but the edge of the handle has been incised with a series of shallow grooves, and the top has finger pinch marks where it was molded to the rest of the jar. The handle illustrated in figure 10:3 is also of duck-bill shape, with incised marks around the edge that are deeper and more pronounced than those from 10:2. Small finger-pinch marks are also visible on the top, near the body of the jar. In figure 10:4, the edge of the duck bill handle is decorated with shallow impressions, possibly made 3</page><page sequence="10">IUI f? m IIB IH H with a finger, but more likely with a small stick; as with 10:2 and the finger- or thumb-indented form is more typical of EB II.

More recently, plain and indented types have been found in EBI contexts at 'Umayri. London (1991, 385-88) believed that the variations were the result of differential skill levels or stylistic choices of the potters, not chronological indicators within the EB I period. However, further excavation and analysis at 'Umayri suggest that chronological development may be the preferred explanation. Harrison reports that the duck-billed type showed up in Field Phase 7, Field D at 'Umayri (2000, fig. 5.15:18-22) and that the indented type was associated with the slightly later Field Phase 6 (2000, fig. 5.23:24-27); both field phases were EB I. A wide variety of edge treatments on ledge handles is present at B?b edh-Dhr?', and there is some development of the indented type during the occupation sequence at the site (Schaub and Rast 2003, 1:93-94, 148-49, 242-44, 382-84, figs. 7.2:17-19, 9.5:6-12, 11.9:14). The only published example with a sharply indented edge, probably done with a thin stick, appears in Stratum II (Schaub and Rast 2003, l:pl. 22:6)?the authors call this a "notched" form. This type is rare at the site, while plain and pushed up types are common (Schaub and Rast 2003, 2:passim). Lithics Prior to our fieldwork, no authors had discussed the lithics at al-Muraygh?t. In 1999, we collected a dozen unifacially retouched pieces and one small "Canaanean blade" from the central core of the site. In 2000, our controlled surface collection garnered many lithics from the site, including a Middle Paleolithic Levallois blade, a Middle/Upper Paleolithic double side-scraper on a blade, one Upper/Epipaleolithic side-scraper-plus-burin on a blade, two Epipaleolithic bladelet cores, a Pre-Pottery Neolithic naviform blade, and a probable Pottery Neolithic truncation burin. Five artifacts could not be dated confidently, and the remainder of the sample (671 total) appeared to be Chalcolithic/EB. We collected scrapers and informal knives, burins, cores, primary and secondary reduction flakes, preforms, retouched and utilized flakes, angular shatter, and other debitage. Although there are several examples of Canaanean blades, the informal blade made by unifacial retouch on a large flake is more common. Sixteen Canaanean blades were recovered, as opposed to 178 "ordinary" blades (Savage and Rollefson 2001, 228-32). The Canaanean blade is associated with plant-food harvesting in the EB (Rosen 1997, 44-50). The other blades may be associated with animal processing at al-Muraygh?t. Their concentration near the center of the stone circles suggests a ceremonial connection, perhaps related to animal sacrifice. The blades do not seem to fit easily into Rosen's Canaanean typology, and they lack the sickle sheen characteristic of plant harvesting. Rosen (personal communication) suggests that these blades, knives, and scrapers might be related to the less-formal lithic assemblages found in regions of the southern Levant dominated by pastoralism rather than settled agriculture, but the presence of a few Canaanean blades suggests that both activities may have occurred at the site. This indicates a greater participation in the pastoral economy of the southern Levant than the cereal agriculture economy at al-Muraygh?t. Ground Stone No complete ground-stone items were recovered from al-Muraygh?t. Twenty-six fragments of vesicular basalt were collected from sixteen of the surface collection units. Most were irregular chunks that could be from broken implements or from the manufacturing process. Two could be positively identified as grindstone fragments, indicating that cereal grains were processed on the site. Quarrying Activity at al-Muraygh?t As figure 1 clearly shows, there are two large quarries at al-Muraygh?t or in its immediate vicinity. The larger quarry to the northwest of the central knoll has existed at least since the mid-1980s. It does not appear on circa 1967 CORONA satellite images of the region but is present in Landsat 5 images acquired from 1987. SPOT satellite images from 1990-1992 show that the quarry had grown substantially. When our initial fieldwork was conducted in 2000 and 2001, the quarry had already expanded to the point where it threatened the site; this fact was brought to the attention of Jordanian government officials. Later we were assured that the quarry had ceased operations on any faces that threatened site features, but the 2006 QuickBird satellite image indicates that the quarry is still in operation and has encroached even closer to the dolmen field. In fact, the viewshed analysis described below indicates that it is quite likely that many dolmens have already been destroyed by the main quarry. Figure 11 illustrates the growth of the main quarry by superimposing outlines digitized from several satellite images. The approximate size of the quarry at various points in time is shown in table 2. These figures were calculated from the outlines in Arc View GIS. Note that there are some discrepancies in the outlines because of the different resolutions of the satellite images used as sources, especially with the Landsat 5 image, which has 28 m pixels, compared to the QuickBird image, which has 2 m pixels. Nevertheless, figure 11 and table 2 show that the quarry has grown from a modest 2-3 ha (4.9-7.4 acres) in the late 1980s to nearly 35 ha (86.5 acres) in March 2006. The fact that the quarry is still active is clearly shown in the QuickBird image, where many large dump trucks are lined up waiting to receive their loads at the main quarry and the newer quarry to the southwest of the site; by zooming in on the higher-resolution images east of the site in Google Earth, one can count a number of dump trucks on the road from the quarry to Ma'in. The expansion of the quarry has probably already consumed many dolmens and clearly threatens others. Figures 12 and 13 show the activity at the quarry in the summer of 2004.

Since the image resolutions vary, the sizes are approximations. A second quarry was established southwest of al-Muraygh?t sometime between 2002, when the Landsat 7 satellite images were acquired, and 2006, when the QuickBird image was taken. During this period, a third quarry was located farther to the west. While these quarries are now fairly clear of the site, a close-up of the QuickBird image shows intense activity at both. Archaeological survey has not yet been completed west of al-Muraygh?t, so it is quite possible that other features or sites will be destroyed by this activity. Elements of the Chalcolithic/ Early Bronze age ceremonial landscape are endangered by the ongoing activity. Additional fieldwork in the region is needed in the immediate future to document the remaining sites in the vicinity of al-Muraygh?t. Viewshed Analysis As noted above, almost all the dolmens mapped at al-Muraygh?t are within line of sight of the "shrine" on the central knoll. This is clearly an important feature of the site, as is the Hajr al-Mans?b. These features probably played an important role in boundary demarcation, as well as in the ceremonial activities that occurred at the site. Furthermore, because so many of the dolmens are visible from the central knoll (and many from the Hajr al-Mans?b as well), we can examine other areas near the site to determine whether it is likely that dolmens may have been present in places that have already been impacted by the quarries. Viewshed analysis is an effective method for this investigation. A viewshed analysis is a line-of-sight examination of the terrain from one or more points of view to discover what parts of the surrounding landscape are visible from the central points. Significant advances have been made in these techniques in recent years (see Gillings and Wheatly 2001; Wheatly and Gillings 2002). The method essentially uses a digital terrain model to determine which areas of the landscape are visible from one or more points, taking into account factors such as the observer's height above ground level and the elevation of target objects. One of the most familiar archaeological uses of this method is determining which of a series of watchtowers or signaling stations in a region were visible from each other or from a group of settlement sites. Christopherson and Guertin's 1996 visibility analysis of ancient settlements in the Tall 'Umayri region, on the northern Madaba Plain, illustrates the method and some potential results. Using settlement data and GIS applications of viewshed analysis, they showed that "[a]lthough Tall al-Umayri suffered from a restricted viewshed, the judicious placement of watchtowers would have allowed the inhabitants of Umayri to increase the size of their viewshed and thereby their control of the region" (Christopherson and Guertin 1996). A viewshed analysis of the al-Muraygh?t region was undertaken to determine which areas of the landscape potentially contained dolmens that would have been visible from the central shrine at al-Muraygh?t or the Hajr al-Mans?b. In this case, the digital elevation model (DEM) was obtained from NASA's ASTER instrument, flying on the Terra Satellite (JPL 2006). The DEM has 30 m horizontal resolution, equivalent to digitizing from 1:50,000 scale maps. Elevation data is reported in 10 cm increments. Global Mapper software was used to overlay the DEM with QuickBird 2 m resolution imagery (donated by Digital Globe, Inc., for this study) and to produce a combined viewshed analysis based on the locations of the central shrine at al-Muraygh?t and the Hajr al-Mans?b. The viewshed assumed observer and target heights of 1.8 m above the ground surface, highlighting all areas within three kilometers that are visible from these points. The results are shown in figure 14. Yellow-shaded areas are visible from the central shrine, cyan-shaded areas from the Hajr al-Mans?b, and green-shaded areas from both. These results indicate where additional dolmens were likely to 0 900 1800 Meters ^^^^^^^^^^^mtmmmmm 5 A Al-Murayghat and the Hajr al-Mansub . sues Figure 11.

The newer quarry to the west of the site threatens to engulf this side of al-Muraygh?t, as well as the knolls immediately west of the main site, where we have noted stone structures and EB ceramics. The gravel quarries endanger the remaining dolmens in at least two ways. First, the dolmens are directly threatened by the expanding face of the quarry. Second, the ongoing quarry activities include periodic blasting to loosen stones on the face of the quarry and the operation of heavy rock crushing machinery to transform the bedrock ^ Figure 14. Viewshed analysis from al-Muraygh?t and the Hajr al-Mans?b. Looking northwest, the yellow shaded areas are visible from the central shrine at al-Muraygh?t; the cyan-shaded areas are visible from the Hajr al-Mans?b; the light-green-shaded areas are visible from both. Note how almost all the extant dolmens (red squares) fall within these areas, and most of the quarry is visible from the Hajr al-Mans?b.

All these activities generate significant vibrations that are transmitted through the ground to help topple the remaining dolmens. Summary Al-Muraygh?t is a unique Chalcolithic/Early Bronze Age ceremonial site and thus a particularly important and significant archaeological site from this period. Together with the stone-circle site being investigated by Danish archaeologists, the site forms part of a sacred landscape on the western edge of the Madaba Plain. Its unique character and broader cultural significance mean that al-Muraygh?t needs to be preserved and protected. Unfortunately, the site is endangered by the continued operation of large gravel quarries located immediately north, northeast, and west of the site. During our fieldwork, dump trucks moved out of the older quarry north-northeast of the site at the rate of about one every three minutes. We have noted with increasing concern that the quarrying continues, in spite of efforts to stop it, even up to the present. Most of the dolmens surveyed in 2001 are located on hills that are being rapidly destroyed by the quarry, and the viewshed analysis presented here suggests that many of the fifty "missing" dolmens have probably already been destroyed. If something is not done to stop the quarry operations in this area soon, the rest of the dolmens will be destroyed as well. Furthermore, since there are menhirs located north of the site, it is entirely possible that a portion of the Chalcolithic/Early Bronze Age sacred landscape of the region has already been destroyed. Acknowledgments The fieldwork described here was conducted with the permission and support of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan; I am especially thankful to Dr. Fawwaz Al-Khraysheh, Director General, and to our Department Representatives, Rheem Shghour (2000) and Musa Malkawy (2001). The field crews included Dayle Elder and Tim Griffin (2000) and Monique Blom, Mohammad Malkawy, Caroline Puzinas, and Sidney Rempel (2001). The digital elevation model was provided by NASA as part of a grant to the Geo-Archaeological Information Applications Lab for the Digital Archaeological Atlas of the Holy Land project. Digital Globe, Inc., donated the high-resolution QuickBird image to the Moab Archaeological Resource Survey's effort to help save the site at al-Muraygh?t. There has been an ongoing effort by several archaeologists to monitor the expansion of the quarries since the danger they represent to the site became known. I am grateful for the photographs sent to me by Ambassador H. G. Scheltema, Dr. Zeidan Kefafi, and Dr. Timothy Harrison and especially for their permission to use some of them in this article. Dr. Gary Rollefson and Ambassador Scheltema confirmed the location of the site and the Hajr with GPS readings. Finally, I would like to thank Tim Harrison for reviewing an earlier version of this paper. References Al-Shorman, A. 2010. Testing the Function of Early Bronze Age I Dolmens: A GIS Investigation.
