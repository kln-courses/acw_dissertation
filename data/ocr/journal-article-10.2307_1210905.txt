<plain_text><page sequence="1">17 ROBERT BENAYOUN Animation: The Phoenix and the Road-Runner The following article led off the July-August 1963 issue of the French journal POSITIF, which was devoted to a survey of the state of animation. It is reprinted here, slightly condensed, by M. Benayoun's kind permission, and he also loaned us several of the illustrations. [Translated by Ernest Callenbach and Christine Leefeldt.] It is not really possible to sum up the state of the animation art. Like the phoenix, brother of the road-runner, animation develops so fast and so haphazardly that it overtakes itself perpetually and is always disappearing from sight. The aficionado of the frame-by-frame film may thus sometimes feel like a morose and frustrated bird-watcher-or like a char- acter out of Edward Lear, scrutinizing owls until, big-eyed and hook-nosed, he becomes something of an owl himself. Let us try to evade this danger. When ani- mation is carved up by pompous specialists, the ever-renewed phoenix can turn into a cardboard chicken or a hunk of sandwich. The animators themselves, deep in technical ques- tions, or captives without realizing it of the twists of fashion, are not always sound judges of advance or standstill in the field. A more objective viewpoint is necessary to evaluate this most rapid, most concentrated, most last- ing product of the seventh art. At the Annecy Festival of Animated Films in 1962, we had plenty of Flebuses-in every screen ratio, their bodies reduced to head and legs, crossing brackish reels upon whose back- ground decalcomania, collage, materials of the most bilious tachisme mixed-artistic tech- niques being rediscovered thirty years late by the commercial (auto, appliance, etc.) salons of spring and fall. But there was little novelty in these man- nerisms or formulas, no matter how up-to-date they were considered by the many serious ani- mators anxious to keep au courant. Real nov- elty lay, that year, in a kind of serene disre- gard of technique, a bypassing of mannerism, a virginal return to the origins of the art-as in the work of Williams and Dunning. In the 1963 competition, the false Hubleys and false Lenicas ran into the real ones, and Bozetto, after a year of reflection, imitated The Ap- ple. Let it be said at once: the annual interval which a festival like Annecy provides serves above all to show how ridiculous is the idea of a "new look" based on the successes of the year; on the contrary, it only furnishes a valu- able imitation potential. And the wheel turns with a wild speed; styles grow old faster than a twist tune or a swimming suit. Happily, and as always, the essentials remain. -Out of reach, Lardner would say.

This is something like the position, fifty years after its birth, of the animation film. It is divided between the far-out researches of the highbrows and the business of producing TV commercials. Who can tell if animation is an adult mode of expression which has been turned into baby-food, or a new language cre- ated by children (of genius) exclusively for intelligent adults? Over the years, film critics have refused to take notice of what they consider a puerile sop on the weekly theater programs, and some animators have declared that, far from being a link between the cinema and the older plastic arts, animation is an autonomous eighth art. They refuse to be called film-makers, and they refuse to be called artists; they prefer an unde- finable niche in an occult fraternity, jealously guarded, whose rites are celebrated at certain places along the Loire river .... And in truth the animator today defies defi- nition. He may be an able sketcher or may never have held a pencil in his life; he may have a degree in engineering, hold patents on inventions, or manifest a colossal lack of cul- ture together with a perfect instinct for the laws of movement. He may be a meticulous lab-man within the experimental branch of some official organization, or a freewheeling publicist, devoting his energy and talent to an ever-renewed praise of consumer goods. The diversity of form which is the result of all this can be surprising, detestable, even fatal, but nonetheless is what we must work from in defining animated film today. All these films illustrate, channel, or release an irresistible craze for speed, a realization symptomatic of one of the central compulsions most typical of our era-for it is superposed, in different forms, on disciplines as static in their basic laws as painting or sculpture. Animation, in principle, has no other plastic imperative than movement. Stills from the most beautiful animated films are as decep- tive, as little representative of the original, as are stills from a film by Resnais. When certain critics write, therefore, that the animated film is not cinema, they commit the same error as so many neophytes who imagine, once they have used an animation stand to shoot a num- ber of free forms in the act of moving, that they have made a film. They treat the genre as if it were a kind of annex to the beaux-arts, an after-dinner amusement. But if an animat- :--4 4UWA From Jan Lenica's LABYRINTH.</page><page sequence="3">ANIMATION ed film is made to be projected in a hall, its images registering at 24 per second on the retina, it surely constitutes a film. An animat- ed film made without traveling shots, without pans, without cuts or other cinematic gram- mar, without dramatic progression, would not only be a ludicrous anachronism but would also be as silly as those dance films which record a beautiful ballet with deadly stolidity -and in so doing betray the spirit of dance as well as that of film. However, these curious notions which circu- late about the "autonomy" of animation help explain the regrettable isolation which seems to have become the lot of so many animators, who keep themselves away from everything else happening on the screens, and work in- creasingly in ivory towers. They are animating exclusively for other animators. During the more than fifteen years that I have been an enthusiastic follower of anima- tion, I have observed all the fluctuations, all the swift-passing fads and formulas of the genre. These disturbances are incidental. Sometimes, they bring with them technical discoveries of importance; sometimes an ab- rupt break (always late) with entrenched styles. Modern art, though it has continually influenced, modified, or given impetus to the course of animation, has seldom been influ- enced in return. The great contemporary art- ists have never been tempted by animation. Those who have integrated a form of move- ment into their work-Calder, Frank Malina, Vasarely, Agam, Tinguely, Takis, Munari, Davide Turconi-have centered their efforts on an exploration of kinetic laws, but left to themselves they have not gone on to an analy- sis and decomposition of movement, or to its creative manipulation as did Alexeieff. Animation, by contrast, its fashions and ephemeral revolutions aside, has produced a certain number of authentic artists, who merit in their individual sphere the same admira- tion, the same critical exegeses, and the same respect as Mir6, Tanguy, Arp, or Magritte. JR, :T1 A it , kq 4" !%p .Nk ]k'4 jig M lo Pg Alexeieff's EN PASSANT (pin screen technique). Unfortunately the lack of publicity and distri- bution of their works condemns them to a nar- row audience of cinephiles and to the film museums, isolating them from the rest of the public. A vicious circle thus arises: the prob- lem of distribution itself drives the animators to cultivate a regrettable esoteric spirit, which leads some of them toward a sterile self- pigeonholing among the arts, as if they were the keepers of some lost secret. The great artists of animation seem to be distinguished very clearly from the experimen- ters. Art in animation begins at that moment when the "experimental" phase ends, and freedom ensues. McLaren, who is an unsur- passed experimenter, does not impress us by the techniques he has developed or perfected (painting on film, stereoscopic film, animation McLaren's CHAIRY TALE (man is ClatUe Jlutra). U.!</page><page sequence="4">20: ANIMATION of the human figure, synthetic sound) so much as by the forms he created once he let loose these techniques and then gave in to the automatic impulses of his own genius, as in Blinkity-Blank or Chairy Tale. It is in the un- bridled play of his imagination that he is su- perior to Len Lye, Fischinger, or even Cohl (who preceded him on the level of pure ex- periment). But his Lines Horizontal and Lines Vertical are mortally tedious and empty; they are merely superfluous tests, disinterested ex- ploration which leads only to pretentious- ness. As to Alexeieff, who is the most accom- plished of all animators, his fame comes not from his invention, admirable though it be, of the pin screen, but rather from his prodigious subsequent poetic visions, like Le Nez, which are full of art and poetry. "The tools are always lagging behind the art," he said to me one day, defining himself, with his characteristic modesty, as a sort of "engineer of the useless." In making films where the functioning of an instrument cre- ates previously unknown forms, he finds his greatest satisfaction when, at some given mo- ment, the oscillations of the pendulum he is now working with conform to his hypotheses. The imagination of an Alexeieff is ahead of the pendulum, just as it transcended the pin screen. Art works through research, but can also supplement it, or ennoble it. The experi- mental animated film is like the domain of the makers or the tuners who perfect musical in- struments on which they are not themselves gifted performers. Art requires a total domina- tion of an instrument, up to a total disregard of its "nature." It is when the experimenter is truly merged with the artist that we can ex- pect to reach the summit. I find the most pleasing animated creations of the last three years to be precisely those which disdain "technique" and are superbly indifferent to so-called "plastic values." When the American Robert Breer discov- ered, by one of those accidents which are the point of research, that the human eye could register and "appreciate" 24 totally different images per second, he was seized with a cre- ative passion next to madness, and began making far-out films where he disregarded every aesthetic value usually attributed to an ensemble of forms and colors. Mixing photo- graphs, newspaper clippings, and quickie paintings of an insolent tachisme, he ran them together as fast as racing cars. The eye ab- sorbs them imperturbably, as if they consti- tuted a coherent sequence. It is the succession of different images itself which comes to con- stitute an illusory form, comparable to that of solids in movement, and which reduces every attempt at analysis to a simple "impression." Every frame is treated by Breer as an individ- ual sensation: in one of his films, 240 distinct optical sensations are compressed into ten sec- onds. By arranging, within the film, several "loops" which bring about the eventual return of the images, Breer has found not only a way to preserve the integrity of a composition in space while modifying it in time, but also the insolence, the casualness necessary to turn this experiment into a work of art, capturing a kind of poetry of the imperceptible. There has been much talk of the Yugoslav animated film, whose resolutely modern graph- ics are inspired by certain wash techniques (see especially Un homme seul by Vastroslav Mimica). But there too, all exoticism put Mimica's UN HOMME SEUL. : *--: ? .. ? ? \ J- ???-? ? ??- wlY:. ~J ~z \ ?? c, i; r~l:~c~rr ?- ?- ~?

This tormented artist, of wild temperament, has made films which the Yugoslavs, a little dismayed, minimize in favor of the more spec- tacular work of Vokotic or Kostelac. Kristl seems obsessed by the spasmodic proliferation of minute people (reduced to symbols) along parallel and perpendicular lines. In Jewel Theft (by Mladen Feman), Kristl, who ani- mated it, reduced a fantastic anecdote to a lunar crossing of naked lines where humans reduced to the size of lice and in a state of panic hopped about according to some un- known erratic lures. With Don Quixote, which he both designed and directed, Kristl gave a definitive portrait of his personal nightmare. The Don, trans- formed into an ultrasonic insect, confronts the evil and injustice of this world in a kind of automotive joust: waves upon waves, whole regiments of motorized cops, or at least of sol- diers on wheels, swoop upon the defender of justice, but he quickly annihilates them. A demon of sound and speed seems to animate this insensate rally, completely unintelligible, but possessing an extraordinary subversive eloquence. Kristl then made (with Ivo Ur- banic) an hysterically mad adaptation of La peau de chagrin: one unfailingly notices, in the background of the tortures which upset the two heros, the inevitable human carousel, telescoping time not by the artifice of Breer, but by the traditional technique (design on celluloid) which in this case reinforces the de- liberate, almost neurotic aspect of these films. Kristl's LA PEAU DE CHAGRIN. The style of Kristl has roots in certain imper- ishably beautiful films by Pat Sullivan, and in an American tradition which goes from Saul Steinberg to Alvin Lustig (Lustig also seems to have influenced the young Yugoslav, Boris Kolar, whose Boomerang received an honora- ble mention at Annecy in 1962). More recently, a well-known and talented animator, who, however, had never reached the great heights of genius, took it upon him- self to commit an acte gratuit in regard to his own style, George Dunning in England made The Flying Man (Grand Prix at Annecy, 1962), in which he throws to the wind all his experience as an animator in order to re- From Fenian's THE JEWEL. THEFT, animated by Kristl.</page><page sequence="6">22: ANIMATION plunge, with startling freshness, into the basic resources of movement. Drawn with a brush and gouache on pieces of glass, The Flying Man seized what is most fragmentary in each dissected movement, and traced, so to speak, the ghost of each gesture. A man arrives at the beach, takes off his clothes, and begins to swim in the air. Awk- ward at first, he improves rapidly. Another man (followed by his dog) tries but fails mis- erably and goes away. This simple tale, obvi- ously, allows Dunning's brush work to be as euphoric as his character. The triumph of this film is equally grand when it shows the failure and the success of a movement considered im- possible. I deny absolutely that The Flying Man is an experimental film. Other film- makers might have realized a more eloquent technique using glass and brushes, but it took a creative master to join in one work theme and method, to create on the screen, with a technique necessarily imprecise (as Dunning forsook all fixing-up) the impression of a triumph over matter and weight. What is revolutionary in The Flying Man is that animation, on the higher level of its lan- guage, manages to reconstitute the gravity and solemnity of the sketch, and the essential truth which lies in a hesitant, groping style. John Hubley, another master, also plays in this register of apparent plastic insecurity. The lunar mirages of Moonbird, the telescopic vision and the energetic phantasms of the fea- ture-length Of Stars and Men, and still more recently the lightning glimpses of The Hole are all fugitive perceptions which turn anthro- pomorphism in upon itself. The human char- acters of Hubley are elongated or extended amoebas, with fluid movements, awkward ges- tures; mystified by comets, electrons, or fan- tastic birds; their voices, indistinct, stuttering, or elastic (the serene slang of Dizzy Gilles- pie), float and bob like sonorous ectoplasms, subject to the most unexpected accidents. In 1963, animation found its strength for renewal in a certain asceticism, a disdain for too detailed analysis of movement; it turned against twenty-five years of servile "in-be- tweening," of academic perfection in drawing. Like Jules Engel with his Icarus, it was pre- occupied with giving life to static drawings, reconsidering all the possibilities of the regular film camera, as Foldes had done in A Short Vision. And it is here that the cinema reasserts its rights. When Positif asked a number of lead- ing animators if live photography was signifi- cant to them, or if they considered animation a closed field, their responses made clear that since last year the cinema accepts, nay seeks, animation. Kristl is acting in his new film, L'homme grave. Dusan Vukotic in Le jeu is mixing live sequences with drawn. Ernest Pin- toff, after his short The Shoes, is making a feature live-action film, The Week-End. Ro- bert Cannon has made a film with a panto- mimist, Lotte Goslar. Ion Popesco-Gopo made a feature, A Bomb Was Stolen, in which ani- mation plays a modest role. Jan Lenica seeks to extend to feature length his fascinating ex- periments in Labyrinth, but this time with a live actor. Kavel Zeman, in Baron Miinchhau- sen, combines in color the resources of live photography and animation. As to Saul Bass, his work has always been halfway between animation and direction. He has made more than a dozen animated titles for features, illustrating the exactitude of Dunning's THE FLYING MAN. -;:,,,,,,-,,~~,~,~ ~~~liY ~i~~:mi -~ie~i~rild~~1 ~~ri ~~~~iX;~~ ?~?;1-i ti~~?8~~ 8*~a~ X1w~:lai -"~g?~ i::i?.-_-?i aln~a'~~~~~ --iC~d "":; ~ ;" i~a~ "-`.

The gallop in The Big Country, the flames of Exodus, the plunging architecture of North by Northwest and Some- thing Wild are difficult to classify. In doing Walk on the Wild Side, Bass filmed the com- ing and going of a black cat (his own, by the way) and made virtually a whole short by live photography, which logically had to lead him toward longer works-and in fact he is now at work on two films, one on New York, one on nuclear research. And let us not forget that he entirely planned several battle scenes for Spar- tacus, one of which was followed exactly. For this confluence of animation and live action, several major factors are no doubt re- sponsible. First, the immense temptations of trick work, which plague many animators, such as George Pal, Jean Jabely, Zeman, and which tend to give to the cinema a magical side. Also, some first-rank artists feel a certain limitation in the short form, when they have begun to pass beyond the trouvaille and em- bark on major works. There is also the difficul- ty of giving psychological depth to characters, in a dramatic context, which forces the ambi- tious animator to consider merging the two genres. And the feature animated film poses more than just technical problems. In the case of marionettes, one is reduced to a totally rig- id exterior for the characters, which even Trnka could not overcome (in his Midsummer Night's Dream). In the case of cell animation, one faces the dilemma of anthropomorphism and the need for stylization, which tend to cancel each other. In the end we must admit that animation, eager to renew itself, asks from live photo- graphy a kind of inspiration which it cannot obtain from its own plastic capacities. Live action offers a certain dynamic potential which can tantalize the animator, give him the desire to transcend a certain crazy move- ment, a certain sublime effect, to push a pos- sibility of the camera to the absurd. It was on the basis of the flight of real birds that Ub Iwerks was able to achieve some of the tricks in Hitchcock's The Birds-which suggested at moments another film, still to be made, in which the dynamics of a bird's flight would be the object of a poetic or lyrical exploration: James Pollack's titles for The Birds are what most strikingly remains in the mind. Dialogue is another phenomenon on which contemporary animators are fiercely split. The Hollywood school, from Tex Avery to Chuck Jones, has always relied in large part on vocal effects for characterization of its figures: Droopy, Bugs Bunny, or Woody Woodpecker are recognizable from the soundtrack alone. As for the "quiproquos" of Mr. Magoo, they are usually due to the puns and obvious jokes that rely more on the voice of Jim Backus than on the technique of Pete Burness. One of the great masters of modern animation, for many people, is the ineffable Mel Blanc, the multivocal phenomenon at Warner's, who, with the aid of three writers, has built up a library of 1,000 different voices. John Hubley has always been careful to see that a rich dialogue accompanies his films; as far back as Moonbird, he used the babblings of his own children, though in The Hole he turned to the doubletalk of Dizzy Gillespie. Ernest Pintoff attributes such importance to dialogue that several of his films resemble dramatic sketches by Harold Pinter or S. J. Perelman. The Inter- THE HOLE, by John Hubley.</page><page sequence="8">ANIMATION MARCEL TA MIRE T'APPELLE, by Jacques Colombert. view animates almost immobile characters, whose hip vs. square dialogue dictates their subtle changes of expression and their highly repressed gestures. In The Critic, the com- mentary is the basis of the film: as abstract shapes of a familiar kind cross the screen, the Yiddish accent of a heckling, skeptical New York spectator is heard commenting on the dismal progress of this phony avant-garde film, while a nearby lady tries vainly to shush him. Against this tradition stands the pantomime tradition of central and Eastern Europe: Trnka, Vukotic, Kolar, Hofman, Bozetto, Len- ica, Popesco-Gopo, et al. Bretislav Pojar, an old partisan of pantomime, skirts the problem by giving a visible form to language in The Orator: words take the form of balloons, with a life of their own. In Europe, of course, the wish to be understood across national bounda- ries encourages the use of mimicry and sound effects, as opposed to speech. But more often this preference indicates a tendency, opposed to that of the American animators, toward a generalization of characters, who become enti- ties or symbols, instead of mouthpieces or stars in their own right-as one might in a broad sense call Bugs Bunny. One might have believed heretofore that the preference for dia- logue was exclusively American, if it were not for the brilliant British school of animation. In the films of Vera Linnecar, Bob Godfrey, and Richard Williams (especially Love Me, Love Me) the role of voice is enormous and deter- mining. The discipline found in the analysis of movement can be seen to operate on the level of the gag. Just as Jerry Lewis, the last hold- out of the American burlesque style, adapts himself to the technique of the "slow-burn" and relies on the knowledge of his public to fill out a scene which is not even on the screen, the three Warner musketeers, Jones, Freleng, and McKimpson, no longer hesitate to depend on the assiduity of the audience. In effect they say: you've already seen this gag a thousand times, we won't insult you by re- peating it. Wile E. Coyote, as he falls over the cliff, holds up to us a little sign reading "A- gain!" and waves a fond good-bye. The fall itself, seen from above, remains invisible: we guess at its termination and then see, at the bottom of the ravine, a tiny mushroom of dust. Nothing could be more "cool." The gag thus becomes a kind of understanding be- tween the film-maker and those whom he now considers his accomplices. Thus it is that a trait of the most abstract animation, such as the retreating horizon or the upsetting of nat- ural cycles, is also paradoxically found in the cartoon, where the plastic capacities of anima- tion give way entirely to successive transfor- mations of rhythm.

It is difficult to say. We have now seen that shots of a blue fish in its bowl, the hand of a barkeeper polishing his counter, or the progress of a little figure along horizon- tal bands of color, can suddenly become au- thentic gags.' Today, the gag can arise from rocks in single file suddenly becoming afflicted with a tendency to do the jig-they all be- come covered, as they hop about in the wilds, with skittery tatoos a la Mir6 (as in Carmen D'Avino's Stone Sonata); the gag can cause demonic laughter in an egg which is proving very hard to cook and which attacks the cam- era (L' Oeuf d la coque, by Marc Andrieux and Bernard Br6vent); or by using six or seven leitmotif images associated with various shouts it can hilariously resuscitate the spirit of the No play (as in The Human Gardens, by Yoji Kuri). And finally the gag can have the fixed pattern of a shriek, in the mechani- cal or melodramatic unfolding of a drama so schematic, so elementary, that it seems like the pure derangement of a daydream-as in The Concert of Mr. and Mrs. Kabal by Wal- erian Borowczyk. (The four films mentioned above justly received prizes at Annecy in 1963). The gag is continually brought into ques- tion by its undoubted masters. Chuck Jones, for example, in his personal laboratory, gives it many a new spark of life. In High Note, he strives for the bareness of a Mondrian paint- ing. In his last film, Now Hear This, which he made with his art-director Maurice Noble, he goes so far as to do away with visual alibis, and replaces an expected sound gag by the simple placard: GIGANTIC EXPLOSION. But we can be sure the time has not yet come when the gag itself can be replaced by a sign saying "GAG!" IThese different images appear in Christopher Crum- pet by Robert Cannon, in Rooty-Toot-Toot by John Hubley, and in Flebus by Ernest Pintoff.</page></plain_text>
