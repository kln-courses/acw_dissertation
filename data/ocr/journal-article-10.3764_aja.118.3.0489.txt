Farther to the south, spread over four stone  slabs, were many badly burned and poorly preserved  coarse sherds, all belonging to a single cooking pot;  some stone tools were found in the same area. Room  4 further yielded 30 shells but no bones.44 Apart from the snake tube with cup, no other obvi- ous cult objects were found in Room 4. Since several  of its fixed installations also occur in typical domestic  contexts, Hallager has recently questioned the room’s  identification as a shrine.45 I prefer to follow McEnroe,  who rightly notes that “a major purpose of Room 4 was  the deposition of various kinds of household equip- ment.”46 Hence, the base of the snake tube contained  0.735 g of sand, very possibly to make it stable; the  slabs, too, suggest “a more or less permanent position  for the vessels.”47 Furthermore, McEnroe notes the ab- sence of a hearth and of traces of burning from Room  4, in contrast to some of the other spaces of the house  (Rooms 2, 3/13, 5), which suggests that no cooking  was done in Room 4 itself.48 He also underscores the  variety of implements recovered and the fact that few  of them are functionally interrelated, and he describes  the arrangement of architectural furnishings. All this  evidence suggests a meaningful distinction between  mere storage and purposeful deposition—if not ex- hibition—of artifacts, opening up the possibility that  the space, the objects, and the activities performed in  Room 4 were all involved in a ritual process.

Katsamba: The Triangular Room in the LM IIIB House  The site of Katsamba is located to the east of Her- aklion (8–10 masl) and is considered to be one of the  harbor towns of Knossos.58 Excavation in the 1950s by  Alexiou yielded remains of a LM IIIB house alongside  a road. Because of this road, a small room (1.9 x 2.6 m)  added later took a triangular shape (fig. 12). Within  this room, which can be interpreted as a shrine, was  found a stone platform originally made of two flat slabs  supported by three upright stone legs. Beneath the  platform were found an incense burner, a pyxis, and  two handless cups. Lying in front of the platform were  two nearly identical red-painted snake tubes made of  the same clay. Ash was found nearby.59 From the street, the house may have been acces- sible from somewhere to the south, where a storage  room was excavated. From there, the main room (3.70  x 3.50 m) could be reached (see fig. 12). The room  contained a quantity of domestic pottery (including  tripod cooking pots, a stirrup jar, a krater, and a kylix)  and some other equipment (millstone, stone tools).  Access to the shrine was also possible from the south, Fig. 12. Plan of the LM IIIB house at Katsamba (modified  via a passage leading to the street.

Following the criteria proposed earlier, these con- texts might therefore be interpreted as shrines even  though Goddesses with Upraised Arms were lacking.  A few other cases where the evidence is less secure can  briefly be mentioned. In the LM IIIA2 Casa dei Vani Aggiunti Progressi- vamente at Ayia Triada, a snake tube was recovered  close to the stairs at the entrance to Room 25, which  has been interpreted as a hall for banqueting (see  fig. 16).102 Banti believed that Casa dei Vani Aggiunti  Progressivamente was an ordinary house without any  evidence for cultic activity, but further details are lack- Fig. 16.

Were these buildings the residences of local rulers and  their extended families, as may be the case at Kom- mos, Katsamba, Koumasa, and Karphi? Or were they  communal buildings shared by a community with stor- age facilities where cultic as well as industrial activities  were performed, as seems to be the case at Sissi, Malia,  and Palaikastro? Although there is not as yet enough  information to decide conclusively between these two  possibilities, based on the architecture it would appear  that the cult activities performed in and around the  incorporated Stand Shrines may have served groups  of people much larger than what is usually understood  as constituting a nuclear family. For this reason, it  does not seem appropriate to call these buildings “do- mestic shrines,” because the term “domestic” creates Fig. 18.
