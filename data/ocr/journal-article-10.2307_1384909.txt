POYTHRESS Department of Psychology University of Texas Austin, Texas 78712 A sample of 234 college undergraduates were clustered into relatively homogeneous religious types based on the similarity of their religious profiles on three scales of religious commitment delineated by Hunt (1972): Literal, Antiliteral, and Mythological. Consistent with Hunt's previous notions, the Mythological commitment was a prominent one among subjects tested. However, a second contention of Hunt's - that proreligious subjects of different substantive orientations might differ in terms of personality characteristics - was not supported. Literally-oriented religious Believers did not differ significantly from Mythologically-oriented Believers on measures of intelligence, authoritarianism, or racial prejudice. Religious Believers as a group were found to be significantly less intelligent and more authoritarian than religious Skeptics. In religious research in recent years there have been numerous attempts to differentiate various dimensions or typologies representing unique religious orientations. Out of Allport's (1950) early theorizing on "mature" and "immature" religiosity has grown the body of literature on intrinsic and extrinsic (IE) religious types (e.g., Allport, 1966; Allport &amp; Ross, 1967). Glock and Stark (1965) posited five religious dimensions, Ideological, Intellectual, Ritualistic, Experiential, and Consequential, though recent findings (Clayton &amp; Gladden, 1974) utilizing factor analytic techniques have suggested a single general religious factor underlying Glock and Stark's multidimensional system. King (1967) used factor analysis to derive 9 religious dimensions, while Hunt (1972) focused on the substantive aspect of paper and pencil measures of religious belief and introduced scales to measure three broad religious orientations: Literal (L), Antiliteral (A), and Mythological (M). The present study was designed to investigate some of the implications of Hunt's notions on the L, A, and M religious orientations. The primary point of Hunt's (1972) article is that many of the paper and pencil measures of religiosity used by previous researchers have a built-in bias toward a literal-fundamentalist interpretation of Protestant Christianity. Acknowledging that 271</page><page sequence="2">272 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION the literal-fundamentalist orientation is indeed a valid pro-religious orientation (the predominant one for many people), Hunt argued that there are other orientations which a religious person might adopt which have been ignored by early investigators. The implications of this criticism for research are: (a) that many pro-religious (though non-fundamentalist) persons would be mis- classified or inappropriately assigned to low-religious or non-religious groups because they disagreed with the literal-fundamentalist bias built into the experimentor's measure of religiosity; and (b) that findings from research utilizing such biased measures, significant group differences, or correlations between religiosity and other variables are "at best meaningless and at worst, dangerous and misleading" (Hunt, 1972, p. 48). These two implications form the basis for the present study. Hunt provided scales, the LAM scales, with which to measure three broad religious orientations. The Literal (L) orientation is the one traditionally measured in religious research and represents the tendency to unquestioningly accept literally and at face value any religious statement. The Antiliteral (A) orientation is basically an anti- religious orientation in which a person rejects religion as being of no value to him or the world. The Mythological (M) orientation is Hunt's new entry into the religiosity measurement scheme and represents the tendency to reinterpret religious statements or doctrines and to seek their deeper symbolic meanings which lie beyond their literal wording. The strategy of the present study was to administer a modified version (described below) of Hunt's LAM scales to a sample of college undergraduates and to identify a number of relatively homogeneous religious types based on their LAM scores. This would determine if, as implication (a) above suggests, there exist a number of pro- religious individuals who are not literal-fundamentalist in orientation who might have been mis-classified with a more traditional (i.e., biased) measure of religiosity. Having identified these different religious types, it was decided to compare these relatively distinct groups on a number of dependent measures popular in the religious research literature to determine if, as implication (b) above suggests, previously reported relationships between religiosity and these other variables would not hold up given the more discriminating measure of religiosity. The dependent variables selected for the present study were intelligence, authoritarianism, and racial prejudice. Freud's (1927) notion that religious beliefs are magical and irrational and not conducive to the development of the rational intellect led to the hypothesis of an inverse relationship between religiosity and intelligence. Findings consistent with this hypothesis have been obtained by investigators using a variety of measures related to intelligence. Results from (a) formal intelligence tests (Brown &amp; Lowe, 1951; Southern &amp; Plant, 1968), (b) tests of logical reasoning ability (Feather, 1964; 1967), (c) comparisons of grade point averages (Robert K. Young, personal communication), and (d) measures of scholastic aptitude (Plant &amp; Minium, 1968; Bender, 1968) have supported the Freudian hypothesis. Contradictory findings have been obtained by Pratt (1937), Warren and Heist (1960), and Young, Benson, and Holtzman (1960).</page><page sequence="3">MULTIPLE RELIGIOUS ORIENTATIONS 273 Fromm (1941; 1950) indicted traditional religions as encouraging authoritarian attitudes in their followers. Early research utilizing the F scale (Adorno, et al., 1950) generally supported Fromm's contention (e.g., Kelly, Ferson &amp; Holtzman, 1958; Gregory, 1957; Jones, 1958; Siegman, 1962; Brown, 1962; Photiadis &amp; Johnson, 1963). More recent research utilizing Rokeach's (1960) Dogmatism scale has also been consistent with the above hypothesis (e.g., Rokeach, 1960; Wilson &amp; Kawamura, 1967; Swindell &amp; L'Abate, 1970; DiGiuseppe, 1971; Glass, 1971), while Feather (1964) failed to find support for this hypothesis and Stewart and Webster (1970) found that the hypothesized relationship held for "Theological Conservatives" but was reversed for "Theological Liberals." Finally, a number of studies have shown religiosity and racial prejudice to be positively related (e.g., Allport &amp; Kramer, 1946; Rosenblith, 1949), though studies by Allen and Spilka (1967) and Stewart and Webster (1970) have shown a positive relationship between religiosity and prejudice only for respondents with more traditional, literalistic religious orientations. Other studies have suggested a curvilinear relationship between these two variables (e.g., Kelly, Ferson, &amp; Holtzman, 1958; Young, Benson &amp; Holtzman, 1960; Young, Clore &amp; Holtzman, 1966; Allport &amp; Ross, 1967) which is consistent with the conclusions of Gorsuch and Aleshire's (1974) extensive review of the religiosity-prejudice literature. This brief literature review suggests that non-religious and anti-religious persons are more intelligent, less dogmatic, and less prejudiced than their pro-religious counterparts. If Hunt's assertion, that the non-religious groups in these studies contain a substantial number of non-fundamentalist pro-religious persons, is correct, then a number of other interpretations of the previous data are possible. If these misclassified religious persons have contributed substantially to obtained differences, then this would suggest that the non-fundamentalist religious persons are, apart from the true religious skeptics, more intelligent, less dogmatic, and less prejudiced than their fundamentalist counterparts. This might also suggest that religious persons collectively (fundamentalist and non-fundamentalist) do not differ from non-religious persons on these variables. On the other hand, perhaps these here-to-fore misclassified religious persons are not different from their fundamentalist counterparts, and their inclusion in the non-religious groups would have reduced the differences between religious and non-religious persons. Based on these considerations, the following hypotheses formed the basis for group comparisons in the present study. On measures of intelligence, authoritarianism, and racial prejudice: (1) no significant differences exist between pro-religious groups (collectively) and anti-religious groups; (2) no significant differences exist between religious groups of differing orientations (e.g., L vs M). METHODS Scales In the present study it was decided to modify Hunt's ipsative scales to a Likert scale format for the following reasons. The ipsative scoring procedure recommended by</page><page sequence="4">274 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION Hunt may force an individual to make a distinction between religious (L,M) interpretations which, were he to be confronted with those interpretations independently, he might not make. This is particularly important in the case of the individual who is indiscriminately proreligious (Allport &amp; Ross, 1967) or the individual whose religious concepts are so vague and confused that he might not distinguish between L and M statements, for example, did not a forced choice procedure require that he do so. This might be, in select cases, tantamount to creating religious types where in reality none exist. Thus it was decided to use a Likert format in order to assess degrees of L,A, and M religious commitment independently. This was done by creating three Likert statements from each of the original LAM items by incorporating the 3 response alternatives into the basic religious statement (see the example below). The LAM scales presented by Hunt consisted of 17 statements of a religious nature, each of which was accompanied by its own Literal, Mythological, and Anti-literal response alternative. A sample item from Hunt's scale is: 2. I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth; Agree, since available evidence proved that God made everything. (L) Disagree, since available evidence suggests some type of spontaneous creation for which it is unnecessary to assume a God to create. (A) Agree, but only in the sense that this is an anthropomorphic way of talking about whatever Process, Being, or Ultimate Concern stands behind the creative process. (M) Each of Hunt's items was converted into 3 Likert items. This sample item was converted into the following 3 items: 1. I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, since available evidence proves that God made everything. (L) 2. I do not believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, since available evidence suggests some type of spontaneous creation for which it is unnecessary to assume a God to create. (A) 3. I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth, but only in the sense that this is an anthropomorphic way of talking about whatever Process, Being, or Ultimate Concern stands behind the creative process. (M) This new format allows for pure L, A, or M types to emerge in cases where the individuals are conceptually clear enough to distinguish the commitment types on their own, but does not force them to do so. It also allows for the identification of mixed types (e.g., indiscriminately pro-religious) without a reduction in strength of commitment. It further serves to disguise the somewhat obvious intent of the original LAM scales to differentiate between three contrasting religious orientations. The modified LAM scales compare quite favorably with the original LAM scales in terms of internal consistency. On an independent sample of 109 undergraduate psychology students (64 females and 45 males), split-half reliabilities (corrected by Spearman-Brown formula) for the modified L, A, and M scales were .94, .95, and .76</page><page sequence="5">MULTIPLE RELIGIOUS ORIENTATIONS 275 respectively. For the modified LAM scales the L and A scales correlated -.88 (significant at .01), while the A and M scales were not related (r = -.17, non- significant). These are consistent with Hunt's findings (Hunt, 1972: 45-46) regarding the relation of A to L and M. A low positive correlation of .35 (significant at .01) between the L and M scales was also found. This weak relationship between L and M is somewhat expected in view of the fact that several of the L and M items differ only in rationale, not in direction of agreement, regarding the same religious concept. A low positive correlation between L and M was also noted by Hunt (Hunt, 1972: 44) using his scoring method. The 51 items created by the above modification of Hunt's LAM scales, the 40 item Dogmatism scale (Rokeach, 1960) measuring authoritarianism, and the 26 item Desegregation scale (Holtzman &amp; Young, 1966) measuring prejudice were the measures used in the present study. These 117 items were randomly arranged in an Attitude Questionnaire. Each individual item was scored on the following dimension of agreement-disagreement: Agree Neutral Disagree A B C D E (2) (1) (0) (-1) (-2) The numbers in parentheses indicate the weights used to score the Likert responses. The Sample The respondents in the present study were 14 students from a random sample of 200 undergraduates invited by letter to participate in the study, and an additional 228 undergraduates from the subject pool of introductory psychology students at the University of Texas. Previous studies with University of Texas undergraduates as respondents (see Young, et. al., 1966) had shown religious attitudes to vary with major area of study. To protect against bias in the present sample from this source, the volunteer sign-up sheets were prepared such that only a certain percentage of respondents could come from each college (e.g., Nursing, Humanities, etc.) within the university. The percentages allowed were obtained from the Registrar at the University of Texas and insured that the obtained sample was representative of the undergraduate population with respect to this variable. Of the 242 people who participated in the study, only 234 were used in the data analysis. Two students were dropped because of a religious orientation considered to be outside the realm of the study (Buddhist); six other students were dropped because they incorrectly filled out their answer sheets. Of the 234 students in the final sample, only 201 had SAT scores on file at the University. Consequently, in analyzing the data with respect to intelligence measures (SAT scores) only 201 students were used. In analysis of authoritarianism and prejudice scores, all 234 students were used. Because the present sample was drawn primarily from introductory psychology classes there was unequal representation with respect to grade level, with 121 freshmen, 69 sophomores, 31 juniors and 13 seniors making up the sample.</page><page sequence="6">276 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION Procedure All students taking part in the study completed the Attitude Questionnaire in a classroom specified on the experiment sign-up sheet. Students were told that this was a survey of their personal attitudes toward a number of issues and that there were no right or wrong answers. They were instructed to indicate their degree of agreement- disagreement with each of the 117 items in accordance with the 5 choice dimension shown above. Upon completing the questionnaire each respondent was given a debriefing statement. The separate scales within the questionnaire were scored by summing all weights corresponding to the alternatives selected and dividing by the number of items in the scale. The possible range for any person's score was from +2 to -2. Positive scores indicated agreement with the attitude or orientation being measured, while negative scores indicated, to some degree, the counter trait or attitude. SAT scores as a measure of intelligence were obtained independently from records at the University of Texas. ANALYSIS Clustering respondents The first step in the data analysis was to cluster members of the present sample into relatively homogeneous groups based on their three item religiosity profiles. Given that such groups could be identified and meaningfully labeled, then appropriate comparisons could be made. The clustering procedure used was a modification of Veldman's (1967) H-group program which was developed on the hierarchial grouping notions of Ward (1963). This program utilizes the D2 index of profile similarity (Cronbach &amp; Gleser, 1953) to determine relatively homogeneous groups of Ss. To preclude the scales with greater variance from having a disproportionately large effect on the D2 indices, scores on all three religiosity scales were standardized. The H-group program provided mean LAM profiles for anywhere from two to eight "ideal" groups. The decision of how many groups to retain was based on two primary considerations: keeping the number of groups manageable for data analysis, and being able to provide descriptively meaningful labels for the groups retained. It was decided to retain eight groups from the H-group program. Group membership for each student was then determined by computing an index of similarity (D2) between that student and each of the eight ideal profiles, with the smallest index determining group assignment. Table 1 shows the standardized LAM means for the eight derived groups and the descriptive labels attached by the author. Table 2 shows the structure suggested by the obtained religious typology which served as a basis for group comparisons. One primary dimension or division among groups was a religious Believer vs. Skeptic division. Groups A,B,C, and D were all pro-religious, either in a Literal or Mythological sense, while the remaining four groups were all skeptical of religious beliefs. Within the Believers, there were two groups which were predominately Literal, but which differed in secondary orientation;</page><page sequence="7">MULTIPLE RELIGIOUS ORIENTATIONS 277 TABLE 1 MEAN LAM Z-SCORES FOR 8 EMPIRICALLY DERIVED RELIGIOUS TYPES Group (N) Literal Antiliteral Mythological Descriptive Label A (66) .32 -.27 1.77 Mythological B (17) -.53 .96 1.23 Mythological/ Antiliteral C (22) 1.06 -.39 -1.14 Literal/ Anti-mythological D (34) 1.11 -1.35 .65 Literal/Pro-mythological E (33) -1.38 1.32 -3.16 Strongly Antireligious F (15) -1.11 1.16 -.93 Moderately Antireligious G (24) -.53 .54 -.68 Non-religious (Slightly Antireligious) H (23) .08 .17 -.02 Non-religious TABLE 2 THE STRUCTURE OF THE RELIGIOUS TYPES Believers Skeptics Mythological Literal Antireligious Non-religious A.

Pure similarly, there were two predominately Mythological groups which differed somewhat in secondary orientation. Within the four Skeptical groups were two Anti- religious groups and two Non-religious groups, with each of these pairs of groups differing in secondary orientation.

The reduction in degrees of freedom for F tests comparing intelligence scores was due to the exclusion of the 33 students for whom no SAT scores were obtained. This analysis showed significant differences among the eight groups on all measures. Comparisons based on the structural divisions in Table 2 were performed to test the null hypotheses described above. Believers vs Skeptics This comparison matched the four pro-religious groups (A,B,C,D) against the 4 skeptical groups. This comparison is analogous to the usual religious vs. non- religious comparison in previous studies except that here steps have been taken to insure that the religious group includes both the literally and the mythologically oriented religious person. The second part of Table 4 shows the results of these comparisons. For four of the five dependent measures, it is possible to reject the null hypothesis of no significant differences between religious and non-religious persons. With the exception of finding no significant differences on racial prejudice, these results are consistent with the results of previous research. Mythological vs Literal For the present study this set of comparisons was one of the most important. Hunt suggested that the relationships between religiosity and other personality variables might vary depending on the particular religious orientation involved. Thus, if type of religious orientation (e.g., Literal vs Mythological) is important, these comparisons should show differences. The third part of Table 4 shows the results of comparisons between Mythological groups (A,B) and Literal groups (C,D). These findings are non-supportive of Hunt's notion that differing pro-religious orientations might be differentially related to personality variables. It was not possible to reject the null hypothesis of no differences between religious groups of differing orientations for any of the dependent measures used. Because the pairs of Literal and Mythological groups both differed in secondary religious characteristics, (e.g., group A seems purely M oriented, while group B is anti-literal as well as M), it was possible that secondary characteristics might account for differences in personality traits. Comparisons between A and B, and comparisons between C and D, revealed no significant differences on any of the 5 dependent measures. Within pro-religious groups, type of religious commitment (Literal or Mythological) at either the primary or secondary level is not differentially related to any of the personality variables measured in the present study. Anti-religious vs Non-religious This set of comparisons matched the Anit-religious Skeptics (groups E,F) against the Non-religious Skeptics (groups G,H). The Anti-religious groups showed a clear</page><page sequence="9">MULTIPLE RELIGIOUS ORIENTATIONS 279 TABLE 4 RESULTS OF STATISTICAL TESTS Comparisons of all 8 groups on 5 dependent measures Measure F df p SAT(V) 2.23 7,193 .05 SAT(Q) 2.38 7,193 .05 SAT(T) 2.78 7,193 .01 Prejudice 2.02 7,226 .05 Authoritarianism 4.04 7,226 .005 Comparisons between Believers and Skeptics Measure t df p SAT(V) 2.59 193 .01* SAT(Q) 2.17 193 .05* SAT(T) 2.70 193 .01* Prejudice 1.42 226 NS Authoritarianism 4.07 226 .005** *Skeptics have higher SAT scores on all 3 measures. **Believers are more authoritarian than Skeptics.

The results of these comparisons are shown at the bottom of Table 4. These findings suggest that the manner in which one rejects traditional religious concepts is related differentially to personality traits of authoritarianism and prejudice. This is particularly interesting because these two groups of students are lumped together as the religious "nones"9 or "non-religious" group in many studies. It is likely that other differences between these two types of religious skeptics have been obscured by the failure of past investigators to make this kind of differentiation. These findings also, in an incidental fashion, support Hunt's notion</page><page sequence="10">280 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION FIGURE 1 LAM RAW-SCORE PROFILES OF 8 EMPIRICALLY DERIVED GROUPS -2 -4 0 1 2 L B A A M I~~~~~~~~~~ m1 MYTHOLOGICAL L A LITERAL L E F A ANTI-RELIGIOUS L G H A M NON-RELIGIOUS</page><page sequence="11">MULTIPLE RELIGIOUS ORIENTATIONS 281 that type of religious orientation may be important in determining different personality characteristics, though it is clear from the context of his paper that Hunt anticipated the important difference to be in terms of pro-religious orientations, not anti-religious ones. Comparisons between the two Anti-religious groups and between the two Non- religious groups were performed to check for differences related to secondary characteristics. These comparisons yielded no significant differences. DISCUSSION The present study clearly supported Hunt's criticism that non-literal pro-religious persons may be misclassified by traditional paper-and-pencil measures of religiosity. A modified version of Hunt's LAM scales was administered to a large number of university undergraduates, and the Mythological orientation emerged as a predominate one for more than one third of the sample (groups A and B, Table 1). If the M scale had not been administered, a large portion of the sample who are pro- religious in a non-fundamentalist fashion would have been classified based on, what for them, are secondary religious characteristics. Looking at the profile for group B in Figure 1, for example, a number of these Mythologically oriented subjects would probably have been categorized as Anti-religious, and this might have had serious implications for the findings of the study in terms of group differences. While this large number of students were predominately mythological in their religious orientation, in terms of absolute commitment to this orientation most were rather weak relative to the strength of commitment of students with different (L or A) orientations. This is shown in Figure 1. As a maximum possible score was 2.0 for any given scale, it is clear that students were less inclined to come out strongly for or against M type items relative to L or A items. This, however, may reflect a difficulty inherent in measuring the Mythological commitment. By its very nature the Mythological orientation is more subject to individual idiosyncrasy than is either the L or A orientation. As such, one who designs items to measure such an orientation, as Hunt has done, is likely to grasp only in part the particular symbolic interpretation which any given individual would consider appropriate for a given religious event or happening. Thus, the only moderate assent to M items may reflect the true M subject's agreement with the spirit behind construction of M items, but his disagreement with the particular symbolism assigned by the investigator who constructed the scale. With respect to relationships between religiosity and other personality variables, the present study partially replicated findings from previous research: religious Skeptics were found to be more intelligent and less authoritarian than religious Believers; on the measure of racial prejudice, Believers and Skeptics did not differ significantly. Among relatively homogeneous groups of pro-religious persons (i.e., Believers), no differences were found on any of the personality measures taken. As such the present findings failed to support the second major implication of Hunt's criticism - that different pro-religious orientations might relate differently to other personality variables. A couple of comments regarding the present findings are in order. While both</page><page sequence="12">282 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION Hunt's ipsative scales and the present scales confront the subject with choices among three distinctively different religious orientations, there may be differences produced by the different answering formats. Secondly, the present sample was not representative with respect to grade level as it included a disproportionate number of freshmen, and this may have biased the data. Finally, as in any individual differences study in which no experimental manipulation is performed and the data are essentially correlational in nature, it is impossible to assure that the individual differences variable selected as the basis for group determinations is the variable causally related to observed group differences on dependent measures. It is possible that other individual differences variables (e.g., sex, year in school, major subject, religious denomination, etc.) which may correlate with religiosity, the appointed independent measure in this study, are actually causally related to the observed differences. Con- sequently no conclusive causal statements can be made concerning the findings; their consistency with previous findings and with the theoretical relationships germinal to planning the study, however, are noted. Using a multi-orientation mneasure of religiosity such as the LAM scales has been shown to be useful in delineating several relatively distinct religious types. Not only did this procedure verify the existence of a prominent non-literalistic pro-religious group, but it also allowed for some differentiation among religious "nones" (Vernon, 1968). Whether this new pro-religious commitment will lead to any new insights concerning religious persons has yet to be demonstrated. Further research relating L, M, and other pro-religious types to personality variables may reveal differences in persons of varying pro-religious orientations. The present findings, however, do not support this notion and, rather, suggest a single general religiosity variable which underlies commitment types which appear to be substantively different.
