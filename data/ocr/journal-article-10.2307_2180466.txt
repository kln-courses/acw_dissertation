<plain_text><page sequence="1">Number 5 Whole Volume LII September, I943 Number 3II THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW THE COGNITIVE CONTENT OF ART THE arts have customarily been regarded as a source of intel- lectual nourishment. They have been accepted as vehicles of insight, revelation, and enlarged comprehension. Dissenting voices have, however, been raised from time to time, voices which express with indignation a denial of the value of art as a means to any adequate knowledge. The denial is, indeed, false, but the indignation is something with which we should sympathize. It springs from a profound and serious moral foundation, It expresses the protest of the disinterested, modest, disciplined, scientific consciousness against something which has all the appearance of highhanded, irresponsible, ex cathedra pronouncement by those confirmed indi- vidualists who are artists. How impressive, from this point of view, is that passage in the tenth book of Plato's Republic where, by means of a poetic simile, the simile of the mirror, Plato indicates the cognitive irresponsibility of artists. The representational artist reproduces nature and man by the simple and easy trick of catching their image in a mirror. This, Plato suggests, should deceive only the intellectually incompetent. Yet from Plato's time on defenders of art, as a vehicle of serious knowledge, have not been wanting. They have insisted that, though the purpose of art be to hold as it were the mirror up to nature, still this artistic mirror image provides the revelation of something otherwise not capable of being known. These old quarrels are still with us and they threaten in our contemporary civilization to be a locus of bitter antagonism. Any- one who reads the current literary journals or who converses with literary artists and critics must be aware that they are today mili- tant. Their campaign is part of a general offensive for the vindica- tion of the humanities. The recent preoccupation with semantics has, moreover, intensified the conflict, for it has produced, in the 433</page><page sequence="2">434 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LII. person of the logical positivist, a new type of intellectual puritan whose passion for the antiseptic and the sterilized leads him to disinfect language and thought of their germinal ideas. When poetry is pronounced to be nonsense or, at best, emotive utterance, literary critics, who cannot but listen attentively when anyone speaks of language, have felt that it was time to take the offensive. But any defence of. the cognitive content of art which is developed for the single art of literature will not suffice for philosophical purposes. The whole problem requires to be treated with greater generality. It may prove useful to begin with the elimination of certain cur- rent misconceptions regarding the nature of art considered as a vehicle of insight and knowledge. Two such misconceptions have been revived and advanced by Professor F. S. C. Northrop in a recent article in Furioso (Vol. I, No. 4). Mr. Northrop first makes it clear that it is science and scientifically orientated philosophy which are the custodians of knowledge in the proper sense. Art, he thinks, can fulfill only two cognitive functions. First, art as it is autonomous, "in and for itself", can perform the function of making us-aware of the immediacy of sensuous aesthetic surface. Practical life is dominated by utilitarian interests, and scientific knowledge is preoccupied with abstractions; and, due to the pres- sure of both, we cease to attend to the sensuously given for its own sake. The artist points it out to us in an arresting way. The purpose of a poem might be, for example, to make us see just how the sunlight sparkles on the water of a brook. Of course, if we are capable of seeing this for ourselves, we do not need the poem. Nature can give us everything that art can give if only we will open our eyes. Artists perform the altruistic function of draw- ing our attention to what we might otherwise fail to notice. And, since the sensuous is an ingredient of experience, art, in indicating it, denotes reality. Surely such a doctrine as this will not suffice. It must, of course, be acknowledged that all art has a sensuous embodiment for perception and imagination, but the recognition of this should not mislead us into the supposition that art is noth- ing but the presentation of the sensuous. Surely only someone who has never understood the complicated and really elaborate charac- ter of artistic expressiveness through sensuous material can sup-</page><page sequence="3">No. 5.] THE COGNITIVE CONTENT OF ART 435 pose that the opening of our eyes or ears or nostrils on any sensu- ous content which nature is in fact pleased to afford will do for us what art will do. Artists do often attend with concentrated intensity to the sensuous aspect of experience, and they always reverence with peculiar piety the sensuous nature of the material of their special art, but sensuous material is never for any artist an end in itself. It is something to be exploited; it is raw material. No artist is content merely to reproduce for the careless observer the exact character of the sensuously given. Mr. Northrop recognizes a second cognitive function of art: the expression for easier comprehension of an intellectual content borrowed from some other source. This is the famous fallacy of art's being philosophy or science or theology made easy for popular consumption through sensuous embodiment. The example given in this case is that Dante's Commedia is St. Thomas' Summa Theo- logica made easy. The author adds that, since St. Thomas has nothing to say to the modern world, so Dante, apart from the sensuous vividness of his expression, has nothing to communicate either. It is further suggested that, if we could get a work of art, presumably literature, which popularized modern scientific theory, it would be, until it became out of date, of great cultural utility. Now here again we have a doctrine which is clearly not in accordance with the data of our experience of art and artists. In the first place, it assumes that, although the construction of works of art may be difficult, the understanding of them is somehow easy. But the plain fact is that the comprehension of works of art is not easy. Let anyone undertake a thorough understanding of Dante's Commedia and he will discover that he has about as much chance of reading this as he runs as he has of reading the Summa Theological. In the second place, what grounds have we for supposing that artists are conscientious and careful purveyors, without distortion, of other people's ideas? The very opposite seems to be the case. Artists are notoriously highhanded even when they are not ill informed. Dante, who was, with respect to the theological material which he used, one of the most conscientious, followed St. Thomas only when it suited his purpose, which was not always. You cannot expect an artist to be a faithful reporter; he has something else</page><page sequence="4">436 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LII. to do. It is indeed true that, in certain historical periods, literary and plastic artists were expected to convey information as well as to create works of art. But, since the work of art always had its own unique intellectual content, the accuracy of the information it was supposed to convey was always in jeopardy. This was no less the case when the given material was mythological than when it was scientific, philosophical, historical, or political. The Church had every reason to be nervous when it confined the task of the pictorial teaching of scripture to artists, and the orthodox fol- lowers of Marx or Lenin have the same reason for apprehension when modern poets undertake to spread the gospel. The fact is that natural piety toward the experientially given, whether it be a theoretical conception, a human experience, or a material object, is foreign to the artist, who is not a reporter but a creator. Anything that God or nature, philosophy or science, politics or history, or art itself, can give him is not going to be accepted as something finished and as such to be respected. It is going to be reduced to the level of raw material for a new creation. Certainly works of art may and do exhibit the influence of ideas derived from non-artistic intellectual disciplines, but art is not a satisfactory method for popularizing such ideas. The sensuous embodiment which they receive at the hands of art does not make them easy; it makes them different. So far, then, we may conclude that, whatever be the cognitive content of art, it is not satisfactorily interpreted as the mere trans- mission for easy comprehension of either the sensuous or the intel- lectual components of experience. A work of art always involves the imaginative transformation of the given. It is, however, possible to regard the artistic transformation of the given in various ways. We turn now to those theories con- cerning the cognitive content of art which hold that such trans- formations are in the interest of expressing the fundamental and inner nature of the actual. There are two radically opposed variants of this doctrine. One is the view that every work of art is the expression of the personality of the artist. The other is the view, in opposition to this, that art is the revelation of the objective truth about man or nature, the physical or psychical, but in some</page><page sequence="5">No. 5.] THE COGNITIVE CONTENT OF ART 437 profound visionary sense impossible to the superficial investiga- tions of science. The notion that art is the expression of the personality of the artist derives its plausibility from the fact that artists are generally uncooperative and sometimes highly eccentric and that many works of art seem to be concerned with the expression of the emotional implications of something. In addition, there is the fact that literary and artistic critics are concerned with the biography of artists in a way in which few scientists are concerned with the biography of scientists. But I doubt if all this warrants the con- clusion that art is predominantly the expression of the personality of artists. In the first place, it must be-remembered that curiosity about the biography of artists is often an impertinent indulgence in gossip and sometimes a tacit confession on the part of the critic of inability to elucidate a work of art without recourse to extraneous and usually irrelevant material. Furthermore, it may be asked, what is the artist to us or we to him that we should care about the revelation of his idiosyncratic personality? Putting aside the interest of friends, it would seem that we could be concerned only on the supposition that artists are unusual persons; but it is doubtful that we should judge them to be such except as they are the creators of works of art which are independently valuable. The works of an artist may, of course, be used as data for the inter- pretation of his personality; but it seems evident that his hastily written letters also provide data, often more revealing, and proba- bly the psychiatrist at least would prefer to either of these the data provided by the unguarded flow of free association. Unfortunately, however, those who defend the objectivity of artistic content incline to an error of an opposite sort. The escape from the personal heresy has resulted more often than not in a flight into unsubstantiated claims. Critics begin to talk about the insight of artists: insight into the heart of reality, insight into deeper meanings than any grasped by science. The sciences most commonly depreciated by literary critics are the young social sci- ences, and that commendable modesty which prompts such scien- tists to admit with candor the limitations of their knowledge to date is actually used as a weapon against them.</page><page sequence="6">438 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LII. Because science proceeds slowly and cautiously in the interests of precision, it is falsely and hastily assumed that scientists are content with their present knowledge, whereas, as we know, every scientist's face is resolutely turned toward the future. But because the artist seems to be bold where the scientist is cautious he is credited with some mysterious power to penetrate to the heart of things. By individual insight he is supposed to know more about the actual world or at least about the nature of man than the disinterested cooperative labor of generations of scientists has uncovered. Clearly we must discriminate between the artistic and the scien- tific enterprises. The realm of art presents a pluralism of self- sufficient expressive utterances while science comprises an ever widening continuity of discourse. The activity of the artist, even though he may grow in power and wisdom, is, nevertheless, a discontinuity of excursions, while the activity of the scientist, even though he attacks new problems, is a single one-directional march. The failure to grasp these differences naturally results in our admiration for the artist with his goal achieved and our pity for the scientist who knows that he will never live to see even the frontiers of the promised land. But all attempts to seek, in the expressions of art, a deeper revelation of man or nature which escapes science and philosophy, must pause with some embarrassment before the phenomenon of artistic autonomy. The plain fact is that works of art are never competitive in the sense in which scientific hypotheses and philo- sophical theories may be. There is no doubt that it is possible to accept both Lucretius and Dante in a sense in which we cannot accept both Democritus and St. Thomas. Similarly, there is no catholicity of taste which can make it legitimate for a scientist to accept, without some higher synthetic principle of mediation, opposing interpretations of the same data. No doubt it sometimes seems as if philosophical discourse were identical with creative literature. We are all aware of the tendency of such philosophers as Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Bergson, and Mr. Santayana, to flee from the controversial battle into the sanc- tuary of poetic statement. But Nietzsche's attack on Schopenhauer and Santayana's attack on Bergson are evidence of the recogni-</page><page sequence="7">No. 5.] THE COGNITIVE CONTENT OF ART 439 tion that contradiction in philosophical doctrine does indeed neces- sitate choice, whereas radical diversity, amounting to incompati- bility, in the content of two different works of art does not necessi- tate rejection of either. No student of science or of philosophy would think of prac- tising that "willing suspension of disbelief" which is generally recognized as suitable in the approach to art. What does this suspension involve? It is not an uncritical acceptance of anything, for works of art must fulfill certain requirements though they are not those which we make of philosophical theories or scientific hypotheses. We expect a work of art to convince us, but not by argument and not by evidence. Its authenticity must be internal to its concrete sensuous presence. Given this authenticity, we accept it, and it seems that what we willingly suspend is not only our awareness of the lack of correspondence of the content to actuality but also our knowledge that other works of art express, with simi- lar authentic voices, different and often incompatible things. It is, of course, not only the poets who say incompatible things without mutual contradiction. Cezanne's vision of three-dimensional space and of the objects in that space is radically incompatible with the vision of Turner. In passing from the music of Bach to the music of Debussy we realize that we have made a transition from one world into another. We experience a like transition in passing from the cosmogony of Spinoza to that of Leibniz, but we know that the latter transition generates an intellectual problem which the former does not. That art is no simple imitation or reproduction of nature is abundantly acknowledged. The legitimacy, indeed the desirability, of distortion in the interest both of design and of interpretation is freely conceded. What fails to be recognized in many critical quarters is the full consequence of this acknowledgment. It is repeatedly suggested that the infidelity to nature of the work of art as a whole is the very condition of its fidelity with regard to that particular aspect of actuality which it has chosen for emphasis or elaboration. The false assumption underlying this doctrine is that the articulations of art are all positive though partial. This would be plausible if art were abstract, but art is concrete and this involves outright negation rather than mere absence. In the</page><page sequence="8">440 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LII. visual world of Cezanne's creation the graceful vistas of Watteau's landscapes are not merely absent or neglected; they are specifically rejected. Sufficient attention to the negative as well as to the posi- tive assertions of works of art eliminates the error of supposing that artists, like scientists, aim at cooperative synthesis of know- ledge. Since the actual world is in fact what it is, if works of art reveal its nature, they must be either mutually compatible or mutu- ally contradictory. If they are the latter, the acceptance of one must necessitate the rejection of others. If they are the former, they must be capable of synthesis into larger more adequate or more inclusive wholes. But is it not equally implausible to say either that in accepting Lucretius we must reject Dante, or that we must seek some higher synthesis in which the partial but com- patible truths of both poets can find expression? Salvador Dali tells us that the two artists who have most influenced him are Ver- meer and da Vinci,-the luminous precision of Vermeer and the enigmatic suggestiveness of da Vinci. But it is clear that whatever be our high or low estimation of Dali, we do not expect to find in his work any synthesis which will enable us to transcend a thesis and an antithesis in the sense in which we might expect a scientific or a philosophical doctrine to include the partial insights of earlier theories. In art we do not look for or believe in any such synthesis. The only escape between the horns of the dilemma which tries to compel our assent either to the theory that art is subjective and the expression of the personality of the artist, or-that art is objective and a revelation of the actual world, is to recognize that art is really neither of these, but the delineation of the possible. Of course "possibility" is a rather inclusive term. The statement that art is the delineation of the possible requires to be supple- mented by some differentiation of the various meanings of possi- bility. Terms such as actual, possible and impossible are adverbial expressions and refer to a mode of being of one entity considered in relation to others. A mode of being of entities in a togetherness implies, of course, a contextual situation. But what is a context? It is sometimes held that a context must be a context of discourse, which is to say that a context must be a conceptual context. This assumption, when developed, leads either to Hegelian idealism or to</page><page sequence="9">No. 5.] THE COGNITIVE CONTENT OF ART 441 one or another variety of epistemological scepticism. I confess I see no compelling reason for the assumption, and I suggest that we may recognize two quite different types of context, conceptual contexts and existential contexts. A conceptual context is a con- text of meanings related by some sort of logical order. An existen- tial context is a context of active substances or of events related by causal efficacy. It is true that existential contexts are known by means of conceptual contexts, but the description of a thing is not identical with the being of a thing. It is also true that a con- ceptual context, as it is part of the awareness of some mind or minds, is included in an existential context, but what is known is not identical with the knowing or with the effect of the knowing. Thus conceptual and existential contexts are not reducible one to the other. To be actual is to be operative within an existential context, that is, to be influenced and to exert influence in the sense of causal efficacy. To be possible is to be compossible with some existential or with some conceptual context. The possible, as it relates to an existential context, is the potential: the potential as capacity or tendency. This actually possible is sometimes called real possi- bility. The possible, as it relates to a conceptual context, may be called ideal possibility. I suggest that such ideal possibility may be classified as follows: (i) the formally possible, as, for example, in pure mathematics; (2) the hypothetical, as, for example, in scientific theory-this is the statement of what is probably actual; (3) the alternative, presented as I believe in art-this is an internally coherent or compossible scheme presented as alternative to the actual. A great deal of time and an enormous amount of human energy have been devoted to the development of all three of these. If we ask why, the answer as it relates to inquiries of which science is representative is clearest and most obviously satisfactory. Man wishes to know the nature of things for the sake of orientation, prediction and control as well as for the satisfaction of curiosity. But what can be said about such enterprises as, for example, pure mathematics on the one hand, and art, as I have interpreted it, on the other? What is the justification for a preoccupation with pos- sibility for its own sake? Nothing is so unfashionable today as</page><page sequence="10">442 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LII. the "art for art's sake" doctrine, since it is considered immoral to be caught anywhere in the vicinity of an ivory tower. Perhaps the pure mathematician has escaped denunciation only because the shocking extent of his purity has evaded popular notice. The an- swer regarding both mathematics and art could be: "but for delight their sole compulsion". This answer, however, though true, is not complete. The full answer is that the delight in question is a cogni- tive satisfaction since insight regarding the possible is insight into reality. Both artistic and mathematical possibilities, as ideals of orderly structure, can furnish norms for practical life: schemes and pat- terns in terms of which man can organize his emotions or his thoughts, control behavior or build bridges. But it must be empha- sized that this value in application requires that these possibilities be initially developed without regard for such application. Ac- commodation to the actual does not constitute the only disciplinary influence upon the human imagination. In fact, freedom from such accommodation engenders its own responsibilities. Mr. G. H. Hardy in a recent book, A Mathematician's Apology (Cambridge University Press, i940), has presented criteria for mathematical excellence which, I think, apply equally to art. These are seriousness and beauty. Seriousness means generality and depth; beauty means unexpectedness combined with inevitability and economy. Obviously, if what is presented to us purports to be a true account of some phase or aspect of the actual, we will be interested in it even if it seems to be something unimportant, such as the color of the tip of the wing of a certain species of bird. But if what is presented to us is something which makes no claim to describe the actual, it must be intrinsically interesting; the prime requirement is that it be, or appear to be, non-trivial. With regard to art, requirements of beauty mean that, for one thing, a work of art must have novelty and freshness. If we find these lacking, we accuse the artist of failure in originality. Then it must have inevitability; that is, it must seem convincing as a possibility; it must have the appearance of authenticity. If we find this lacking, we say that it is false; but obviously we do not mean false to the actual, since what we know to be false in this sense can still have artistic authenticity. Finally, it must have economy:</page><page sequence="11">No. 5.] THE COGNITIVE CONTENT OF ART 443 every element included must make its contribution to the effect of the whole. If we find this lacking, we say that it is disorganized. Seriousness is a criterion which differentiates greater from lesser works of art. Serious does not, of course, mean solemn. It im- plies range and depth. Range is richness and variety of included content. Depth is concentration of meaning in such a way as to provide levels of meaning within the same work of art. Depth is complexity on a vertical scale as range is complexity on a horizon- tal scale. The criteria of seriousness and beauty are not indepen- dent, since the artistic ideal is the achievement of novelty with generality and of inevitability and economy with. depth. The analogy, which I have drawn, between fine art and pure mathematics is intended to emphasize that the knowledge of the possible can be interesting and important in its own right and that although both art and mathematics are free from the requirement of accommodation to the actual, which is characteristic of science, nevertheless they must satisfy criteria of their own which, though different, are no less rigorous. Analogy, however, does not imply identity, and it is essential to indicate the important difference be- tween art and mathematics both as to method and as to purpose. Mathematics is formal and abstract; art is sensuous and concrete. The former is expressible in signs while the latter commonly employs symbols. To understand the sensuous symbolic expressions of art, it is important to distinguish the genuine symbol from the mere sign. Mathematics commonly uses the visual presentation of numbers, letters, and diagrams. These are sometimes called symbols but they are not genuine symbols; they are merely signs. A sign is a passageway to something else; it is a selfeffacing means to some insight which lies beyond it. It is diaphanous and transparent. A symbol is substantial and opaque. It does not point to something else; it holds its meaning within itself. The relation of the sign to what it signifies is a matter of convention, whereas the symbol must be, or at least appear to be, the suitable and natural vehicle of the meaning which it embodies; that is, it must in some sense resemble what it means. This is why signs function most effec- tively when they efface themselves, when they are as transparent as possible, allowing the perceiver to pass directly to the meaning.</page><page sequence="12">444 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LII. But symbols, being vessels and repositories of meaning, demand attention; their presentational appearance is important. Further, signs commonly belong within a system such that some signs may be substituted for others without loss of meaning, as i + 2 is equivalent in meaning to 3, and a technical term is equivalent to its definition. But symbols are commonly solitary and cannot be substituted for one another without radical change of meaning. The artist must exert a highly sustained creative energy to pre- vent his symbols from degenerating into mere signs. In poetry this is the effort to keep metaphor alive. The struggle of the poet is to maintain language full-bodied, solid, and inescapably present. The creative effort for sustained symbolic expression in plastic art is manifest in the effort to resist iconographical reduction. For once a work of plastic art becomes an icon, whether religious or secular, the observer tends to look through the sensuous material to grasp some meaning which lies beyond. It is the nature of abstract signs that they can be used again and again without alteration and impoverishment, but it is the nature of concrete sensuous symbols that they must be constantly and freshly recreated for each individual work of art. It is true, of course, that creative advance in mathematics often necessitates the invention of new signs, but once these signs have been in- vented they become the common property of all mathematicians and can be used over and over indefinitely. Symbols reemployed must wear their symbolic expressiveness with a difference. If the artist can achieve this difference, the imaginative invocation of former artistic expressions which can be effected through the employment of similar symbols is a common method of increasing the seriousness, that is, the range and depth, of artistic expression. An example of this is the rose of Dante's Paradiso. But this man- ner of handling symbols, although it is perhaps the best means of creating complicated fusions of expressive meaning, is not indispensable. Artists, like cultural epochs, differ with respect to the value which they place upon tradition. And, although this is a factor which is reflected in their work, it is irrelevant to the question of their importance as artists. Thus novel and isolated symbols will function just as effectively if they fulfill the essential requirements of symbols, that is, if they are made to appear as the</page><page sequence="13">No. 5.] THE COGNITIVE CONTENT OF ART 445 natural, necessary and inevitable sensuous vehicles of the mean- ing which they express. This discrimination between sign and symbol provides the key to the differentiation between mathematical and artistic possibili- ties. Mathematical possibilities, being communicated and devel- oped by signs, are both formal and systematic. The pure mathe- matician is one who spreads his wings, ascends to his Platonic heaven and remains there. His interest is confined to a highly abstract order of the possible, namely, the logical order of mani- folds. His interest is satisfied by intellectual intuition, and he ex- periences no urge to actualize these insights in concrete sensuous material. The artist, however, is, or aspires to be, a demiurgos. He seeks to create some ideal possibility by the process of working through some sensuous material. He cannot create a world, but he can create, in a work of art, an isolated selfsufficient structure which often impresses us as being a windowless monad which mirrors a world. Of course the consequence of this appetite in the artist for actualization is that the realm of art cannot hope to rival the systematic character of mathematics but presents an irreducible pluralism of unique visions. The independent individuality of art-objects has always been recognized, but it is important to notice that this independence is twofold. In the first place, in spite of the integrating influence of artistic tradition, works of art are independent of one another. They cannot be synthesized and they cannot be rigorously sys- tematized. The internality of relations within the work of art is in sharp contrast to the externality of relations of the art-object as a whole to other works of art. In the second place, the work of art is independent of the actual world of which, by virtue of its sensuous embodiment, it seems to be a part. In a sense it may appear paradoxical to urge this, for, if the aim of the artist has been properly described as the attempt to actualize a possibility in sensuous material, then surely, as actualized, it becomes a part of the actual world. In one way it does, but in another way it does not.. It is of the first importance to recognize this distinction. In so far as we consider a work of art either as a physical thing or as a</page><page sequence="14">446 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LIL product of human activity and an object of human appreciation, it certainly belongs to the context of nature or to the context of social culture. The recognition that a picture is also paint and canvas and so a natural object capable of physical and chemical analysis and subject to natural changes is current and hardly needs elaboration. But the recognition that a work of art is a cultural product has often been a source of considerable misun- derstanding. Of course the artist is a human being and a social creature. Of course the culture of his period influences him; his imagination has to work within the limits set by the raw material, physical and social, available to him. Obviously, works of art are cultural products which, in turn, produce effects on audiences and are causally efficacious in modifying social life. A social psycholo- gist, sociologist or historian would be bound to regard works of art as cultural data. It would be ridiculous to deny either the propriety of this or its importance. Nevertheless it is essential to differentiate the question: What is a work of art and what does it express? from the question: What influences of the cultural period are reflected in this work of art and how did this work of art influence those who knew it? It is evident that these are dif- ferent questions. It must further be remembered that the second question can be appropriately asked with regard to any intellectual product: the differential calculus, the Nicean creed, the theory of relativity. To say, correctly, that all this is cultural data is not to say that this is nothing but cultural data. It is surely obvious that before one can deal with Aristotelian philosophy, Christian theology or Newtonian science as cultural patterns, one must first understand them as philosophy, as theology, as science. The same is true with regard to art. A work of art may be regarded spe- cifically as a work of art, or it may be regarded as a cultural or as a physical thing. From either of the latter points of view, it is a part of the context of the world, but considered specifically as a work of art it is an isolated structure which, though present in the actual world, is not of it. One of the most impressive characteristics of the art-object is its boundary. Such an object may appear to possess an indefinite richness of internal depth and range, but it always has a boundary which isolates it from all other entities including other works of</page><page sequence="15">No. 5.] THE COGNITIVE CONTENT OF ART 447 art. The so called temporal works of art are no exception. Every musical composition and every poem begins and ends and so returns upon itself. It never just commences and ceases. When it is thor- oughly understood, every part is heard in the totality of the whole. It is surrounded by silence or at least by irrelevancy as pictures are surrounded by their frames. Thus works of art, present as physical things and present as cultural products, are, nevertheless, as works of art, imaginative vistas out of the actual. To enter into the contemplation of a work of art is to pass through the context of the actual to the appreciation of a unique, discontinuous possi- bility. That works of art, though present in the actual world, are not really of it, is not always recognized. This is because of the fact that many of the possibilities revealed by art are fairly close to actuality. The imaginative possibility may vary from actuality very conspicuously or only slightly. Fantastic art differs from so called realistic art only in this sense. The criteria by which works of art are judged more or less excellent should be irrelevant to the con- sideration of how close or how remote they are to the actual. The development of photography has brought this matter vividly home to the pictorial artist. It is unfortunate that there is no comparable invention capable of making it equally impressive to the literary artist. Poets have always known it, but prosewriters of fiction do not always understand what fiction is. The modern world is full of novelists who are not artists. They want to write sociological treatises without submitting to the discipline of science. Thus they produce ambiguous works which make no attempt to meet either the rigorous requirements of art or the rigorous requirements of science. A work of art presents a possibility which, because it is not abstract but concrete, must be regarded not as a schematism of or for the actual, but rather as an alternative to it. However, I do not think that we can insist that it must be conceived as an alternative to one aspect of the actual rather than another. Of course it is man who creates art and man is, naturally, interested in himself. It is a fact that perhaps the majority of works of art are concerned with the revelation of possibilities of human experience. The greater part of literature is concerned with what men might say and feel</page><page sequence="16">448 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LII. and think if they were unusually articulate or unusually sensitive or unusually representative in some way, and if the world that surrounded them and the events which influenced them were, whether fantastic or naturalistic, at any rate subject to a rigorous economical selfenclosed organization. Similarly, some music is expressive of what joy and sorrow would be like if it sounded in complicated harmonious patterns, and so forth. But I think that theorists who insist that artistic insight is always sub specie hu- manitatis are committed to too extreme a position. It is true that certain works of plastic art which present an artistic alternative to the non-human world of nature are elaborate experiments in anthropomorphism,-nature as it might be if it had human purpose and were subject to human emotion. But this is not always the case. Many such works of art have no humanistic reference and are the presentation -of how some aspect of the natural world might have appeared if it were simply more rigorously organized, more selfssufficient, and, as a mere spectacle, more interesting. Finally, vie must remember that there are works of art which present artistic possibilities not capable of being considered as imaginative reconstructions of man or nature in any obvious sense: arabesque designs, so called abstract pictorial art, and a good deal of music. This is the exploitation of sensuous material for the presentation of intricate, elaborate, autonomous schemes of order. Such works of art seem more analogous to the patterns of mathe- matical structure than to anything in the actual world. But these patterns are not formal possibilities; they are not variables which might be satisfied by any one of a range of values. They are sensuous symbols of what might have been a causally efficacious, integrated part of the natural world if nature had seen fit to achieve something more than crystal-formation or birdsong. Artistic possibilities may be developed for the realization of a variety of ends and the expression of a variety of values. An artist may have a moral purpose which he presents positively, through idealization, or negatively, through satire. He may wish to offer a commentary on life or on the civilization of his time, or he may wish merely to liberate a fantastic imagination. His work may involve an act of religious devotion or the vicarious gratifica-</page><page sequence="17">No. 5.] THE COGNITIVE CONTENT OF ART 449 tion of a thwarted desire. There is no limit or end to the secondary purposes which may be involved. The primary purpose, however, is to create an object which has artistic value. It is exclusively by reference to this value that art may be said to be "a spirited protest against nature" and to present a concrete alternative to the actual which is intrinsically significant and valuable because it is better than the actual. To be better, by this standard, is to achieve plenitude and richness with structural selfsufficiency. Otherwise expressed, it means to achieve intensional depth and concentration of expressive meaning with extensional limitation and isolated finality. The Leibnizian God no doubt in- tended that his best of all possible worlds should achieve this unity in variety and be a work of art, but no actual world containing real individuals and changing through time can fulfill this aesthetic ideal. The compossible schemes, which are works of art, must remain possibilities, and possibilities isolated and irreducibly plural. Possibility as it enters into the structure of such discourse as science, philosophical cosmology, and natural theology, is an en- tirely different matter. All three enterprises are concerned with what is taken to be actual. Consequently, in all three, reference must be made, at some point, to empirical data. Of course nobody supposes that knowledge of matter of fact concerning the actual is to be found neat, pure and uncontaminated through some translucent form of empirical observation. Facts are never dis- covered except under the illumination of some guiding theoretical conception. But theoretical conceptions must prove their explana- tory adequacy by saving the phenomena of experience. In attempt- ing to disclose the nature of the actual, science has its useful fictions, its ideal constructs, its norms of reference, and its imaginative flights. Cosmology and theology may use metaphor and symbol and the imaginative schemes of either may outrun the empirical evi- dence. Even if all meaningful statement in any of these disciplines embraces both logical structure and hypothetical formulation and hence contains some ineradicable reference to possibility, never- theless there remains a great difference between the exploitation of the possible as a means of arriving at the description, explana- tion, prediction, or control of the actual, and the exploitation of</page><page sequence="18">450 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LII. the actual as a means of arriving at the delineation of the possible. The argument of this paper may be summarized as follows. In the first place, it seems evident that art does reveal something to us; it has a cognitive content; it affords knowledge. The fact that art moves us, that we respond emotionally to it, cannot, I think, be interpreted to mean either that art is a mere emotional stimu- lant or that it is the mere expression of emotion. For many things are efficacious in producing emotion-bombs and whisky no less than art-and, though art may indeed express emotion, no artist can express emotion a propos of nothing. There must be some cognitive core, some insight as a focus for emotion. But if we ask: What is it that art reveals?, and if, in seeking an answer, we turn as we should to the scrutiny of works of art, we find that we are confronted by an irreducible pluralism of selfsufficient, inde- pendent visions. There is neither community of discourse, on the one hand, nor conflict and competition, on the other. If art were, fundamentally, a revelation of the actual world, it would seem that we should find in our attitude toward it the tendency, evident in our attitude toward science, metaphysics, and theology, to seek some intelligible unity either by rejection and selection or by a higher synthesis which transcends and supplants what it absorbs. Yet it seems to be an empirical fact that in art we experience no urge in this direction. Art is welcomed in its pluralistic diversity. This being so, we could consider the hypothesis that art is pluralistic because each work of art is the expression of a purely individual and personal point of view. But though in some cases we can find the artist in his work, in many cases we cannot, and the chief fact which discredits the hypothesis is that an interest in art seems to be qualitatively quite a different thing from an interest in personality. Any interest we may have in the personality of an artist is derived from our initial interest in the work of art for itself. Hence I suggest that, although a work of art is made out of sensuous material, which, as such, belongs to the actual world, and although it exhibits traces of the influence of the artist's life and his culture, nevertheless its prime purpose is to present to us, through sensuous symbolism, an ideal possibility. A work of art is, in a way, an addition to the actual, but an addition which, how-</page><page sequence="19">No. 5.] THE COGNITIVE CONTENT OF ART 45I ever it may be integrated as a cultural product, resists integration specifically as a work of art. As a work of art it is a selfenclosed isolated structure. To enter into the contemplation of it is to leave the context of the actual and to comprehend a concrete alternative as a possibility. The ultimate object of philosophical inquiry is reality. Unless the real is construed as the perishing occurrence of the moment, it must embrace the possible as well as the actual. Consequently, an interest in the possible for its own sake should be recognized as philosophically justified. A liberal mind is surely one which is not tied irrevocably and exclusively to the present or to the actual. One of the valuable functions of history is that it is a means of freeing us from a too exclusive concern with the present. But pure mathematics and fine art are, in their different ways, even more significant as freeing us from an exclusive preoccupation with the actual. It .is not a question of a mere happy escape from the slings and arrows of our immediate fortune. It is a question of a philo- sophic comprehension of the real in its manifestation as the in- trinsically interesting possible. DOROTHY WALSH WELLS COLLEGE</page></plain_text>
