<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stanley Cavell MORE OF THE WORLD VIEWED Ihave The World been told, Viewed and by and friends patient sympathetic with the difficulty to the issues of their of The World Viewed and patient with the difficulty of their expression, that I have made a difficult book, a sometimes in- comprehensible book. I have no choice but to believe this and, since I also continue to believe in the book, to attempt to account for its difficulty and do what I can to alleviate it, at least do what I can not to discourage a genuine desire to assess it sympa- thetically. I persist in the feeling asserted in the book's Preface, that its difficulty lies as much in the obscurity of its promptings as in its particular surfacings of expression. Given the feeling that a certain obscurity of prompting is not external to what I wished most fervently to say about film (and hence cannot have been cleared up before I commenced writing, nor at any time before I called the writing over), the commitments I set myself as I wrote were, first, to allow obscurities to express themselves as clearly and as fervently as I could say, and, second, to be guided by the need to organize and clarify just these ob- scurities and just this fervor in the progression of my book as a whole. These procedures would be pointless unless the ob- scurities I allowed myself were accurate responses to the nature of film and unless the expressions I found for them were accurate to those responses; and unless I did in fact manage, in the [ 571 ]</page><page sequence="2">57 2 THE GEORGIA REVIEW progression of the book, to bring some order and to do some justice to these expressions. Such procedures differ from, almost reverse, the procedures I had followed in my previous philosophical writing. There my hope for conviction from the reader was placed in my ability to motivate assertions, and objections to them, and to voice them in such a form and at such a time that the reader would have the impression that he was himself thinking them, had been about to have said them- not about to have said something generally along their lines, but as it were to find himself thinking those specific words just when and just as they were appearing to him. (Naturally this need not, even when done well, occur on a first perusal. Then what in a first should encourage going back?) Whereas in writing about film I felt called upon to voice my responses with their privacy, their argumentativeness, even their intellectual perverseness, on their face; often to avoid voicing a thought awaiting its voice, to refuse that thought, to break into the thought, as if our standing responses to film are themselves standing between us and the responses that film is made to elicit and to satisfy. Perhaps the plainest of my intentions, certainly the intention least hidden from me from the outset of the writing, was to demonstrate that movies may be written about, and that some are worth thinking and writing about, with the same seriousness that any work of art deserves, with the same specificity of atten- tion to the significance of the work at hand and to the formal devices of the work by means of which this significance is achieved. I knew from the outset, accordingly, certain of the issues that awaited me. (i) I would immediately have to say why so grotesquely obvious a point as the worth of certain movies is worth the making. It is worth making, to my mind, not alone because making it implies a commitment to specify the grounds of worth in particular cases, but because it implies that not all movies are in fact worth this attention and that there is next to no agreement among those who speak of movies over the canon of movies to which their speaking must be ac- countable and by which standards are thus far set against which to weigh worth; nor over the cinematic grounds there may be in terms of which to argue worth or worthlessness. These lacks in</page><page sequence="3">STANLEY CAVELL 573 agreement are a function, I believe, less of the comparative "youth" of the art of film than of the sociology of film criticism and theory. One might compare, for better and for worse, the contemporary state of film criticism and theory with the state of literary criticism and theory at the time of the establishment of the newspaper or of the literary-political Reviews; a time, that is to say, before the professionalization of scholarship and the aca- demicizing of criticism. (2) I would have at some point to begin to specify what I took to count as "formal devices" of film, and in particular to say why a rehearsal of the technological properties of lenses, filters, shutters, film exposures, etc., does not in itself constitute specifications of aesthetic properties of film. (The common appeal to technological properties is caused in part by a sense that the sheer power of film is unlike the powers of the other arts. I share this sense, and I agree that this power is essentially related to film's technology. But the aesthetic role of this technology is no more specified by studying it apart from its specific achievements in significant films, than, say, the role of electronic amplification in rock music is specified by studying electronic amplification apart from its specific results in the sounds of rock, indeed, apart from its role in determining what counts as a "sound." (3) I would have to say why a general declaration of the nature of film's "differences" from other artistic media- a declaration of cinematic "essence"- was apt to be called for and likely to be fruitless. Whatever one may mean by the "essence" of a medium of art, its sense can only be specified by the achievements of that art itself. The declaration of film's essence I had heard most frequently was that it consisted of "light and movement." That seems the natural, the only, answer to the isolated and persistent question, "What is the essence of the medium of film?" Since the answer seems to me more or less empty, I take the question to be more or less the wrong question to ask. In particular, I have seen no objects consisting essentially of light and movement (and essentially of nothing else) that have struck me as having the force of art. And since the objects of film I have seen which do strike me as having the force of art all incontestably use moving pictures of live persons and real things in actual</page><page sequence="4">574 THE GEORGIA REVIEW spaces, I began my investigation of film by asking what role reality plays in this art. There is at least a double cause for finding it natural now to resist the pressure of reality upon art: there is a more or less vague and pervasive intellectual fashion, apparently sanctioned by the history of epistemology and the rise of modern science, according to which we never really, and never really can, see reality as it is; and there is an interpretation of the history of the representative arts, especially the history of painting and of the novel contemporary with the invention of photography and with the advent of motion pictures, according to which art had been withdrawing from the representation of reality as from a hopeless, but always unnecessary, task. I was counting on its being found equally natural to resist these causes for resisting the pressure of reality: if for no further reason, a general dismissal of reality depends upon theories (of knowledge, of science, of art, of reality, of realism) whose power to convince is hardly greater than reality's own. I was not unaware that, in my case, resistance to this resistance is colored by my readings of Wittgenstein and of Heidegger, each of whom I under- stand to be writing within the threat of skepticism, out of a philosophical necessity not so much to deny its conclusion (which it may be fashionable to do, or not to do) but to determine the place of skepticism's inspiration, as though its threat is as revelatory of human thinking as science itself is. I wrote in hopes, however, that my reading of these philosophers was not overly idiosyncratic and that I could, besides, keep them from overlying what I had it in mind to say about film. The issue of reality for film was, in any case, forced upon me by the experience of Panofsky and of André Bazin. I felt that, whatever my discomforts with their unabashed appeals to nature and to reality, the richness and accuracy of their remarks about particular films and particular genres and figures of film, and about the particular significance of film as such, could not, or ought not, be dissociated from their conviction that film bears a relation to reality unprecedented in the other arts. I was therefore interested to discover that they had significantly misspoken them- selves, or spoken unnecessarily, in speaking of film as "a drama- turgy of Nature" and in speaking of "the medium of movies</page><page sequence="5">STANLEY CAVELL 575 [as] reality as such." They both wish, correctly, to emphasize that on film reality is not merely described or merely represented. But obviously it is not actually present to us either (anyway, obviously not present with us) when it appears to us on the screen. So I was led to consider that what makes the physical medium of film unlike anything else on earth lies in the absence of what it causes to appear to us; that is to say, in the nature of our absence from it; in its fate to reveal reality and fantasy (not by reality as such, but) by projections of reality, projections in which, as I had occasion to put it, reality is freed to exhibit itself. -I cannot say that I was entirely surprised to find that my emphasis on reality has caused a certain amount of unhappiness among readers of my book. In the Sarasota symposium, Alexander Sesonske raised questions about this topic of reality which he intended as specifying a number of causes for unhappiness likely to be shared by others. I propose to concentrate my remarks here along a series of such causes, as I have so far understood them or shared them. I shall want to account for the way in which, at each point, the issue of reality poses itself at once as too obvious to mention and too obscure, or false, to argue. I will also have it in mind to respond to certain suspicions aroused by my limitation to the canon of talkies at my disposal as I wrote: at one extreme, by my over- indulgence of Hollywood's contributions to the history of film; at another extreme, by my all but complete neglect of contem- porary experimental film making. The former limitation is thought to distort my account of what I call "traditional" movies; the latter neglect is thought to falsify my account of film's relation to modernism in the other arts, on the ground that the real modernism of the art of film is spoken for by its experimentalists, present and past. About halfway through my book (p. 72) I give a provisional, summary characterization of what I call "the material basis of the media of movies." I say that this basis is "a succession of automatic world projections." The remainder of the book then works out some consequences of each of the major terms of this characteriza- tion. But these consequences may seem misconstrued from the beginning, because there is one whole region of film which seems to satisfy my concerns with understanding the special powers</page><page sequence="6">57 6 THE GEORGIA REVIEW of film but which explicitly has nothing to do with projections of the real world- the region of animated cartoons. If this region of film counters my insistence upon the projection of reality as essential to the medium of movies, then it counters it completely. Here is what Sesonske says about cartoons (he is thinking spe- cifically of Disney's work, which is fair enough: if any cartoons are obviously to be thought of as movies, even to the point of their containing stars, these are the first candidates): . . . neither these lively creatures nor their actions ever existed until they were projected on the screen. Their projected world exists only no&lt;w, at the moment of projection- and when we ask if there is any feature in which it differs from reality, the answer is, "Yes, every feature." Neither space nor time nor the laws of nature are the same. There is a world we experience here, but not the world- a world I know and see but to which I am nevertheless not present, yet not a world past. For there is no past time at which these events either did occur or purport to have occurred. Surely not the time the drawings were made, or the frames photographed; for the world I know and see had not yet sprung into existence then. It exists only now, when I see it; yet I cannot go to where its creatures are, for there is no access to its space from ours except through vision. Each of these remarks is the negation or parody of something I claim for the experience of movies. But of course they do not prove that my claims are false except on the assumption that cartoons are movies, and that, therefore, what I said about movies, if it is true, ought to apply to cartoons in the way it applies to movies. But on my assumption (which I should no doubt have made explicit) that cartoons are not movies, these remarks about their conditions of existence constitute some ex- planation about why they are not. Since this is merely logic, what is the moral to be drawn from the fact of cartoons? I take the moral to be something like this: A good case can be made out, using the very terms of The World Viewed (about a world present to me from which I am absent, about various kinds of succession or motion, about conviction and memory, etc.) that cartoons are movies. It would, therefore, in a sense not be surprising to me if someone likes to think that that is what they are. Iben there is this asymmetry between his position and mine: He does not have to show that cartoons</page><page sequence="7">STANLEY CAVELL 577 are movies because he has no theory which his taste contradicts. He can simply say "the two are not that different." Whereas I do, apparently, have to show that cartoons are not movies, or any- way show that the differences between them are as decisive as my emphasis on reality implies. And of course I cannot show this, in the sense of prove it- any more than I can show that a robot is not a creature or that a human is not a mouse or a dog or a duck. If someone is convinced that humans are not that different from mice or dogs or ducks, he can bring a great deal of evidence in his support. There are probably more citable similarities between them than differences. To affect someone's conviction that cartoons are movies, all I could do would be to provide some reflections on cartoons. I imagine they would contain considerations of the following sort. The chief inhabitants of the world of animated cartoons (the ones I am imagining and the ones Sesonske's remarks seem to have in mind) are talking animals- anthropomorphic, we might say, in everything but form. The human figures in them seem, in com- parison with the animal figures, out of place or in the way. I think the reason for this is that there is less room, so to speak, in these human figures for our fulfillment of their animation, i.e., for our anthropomorphizing of them. If it proves to be true that human figures are thus generally problematic, then it becomes of interest to determine how the human figures that occur are made fit to occur, i.e., made to live the laws of animation. The world inhabited by animated creatures is typically also animated; it may not remain the stable background of the actions of the live figures, but act on its own. It is animistic. There is, of course, no general problem of achieving conviction in such a world; it taps perhaps the most primitive of our convictions about the world. If I say it is essentially a child's world, I hope I will not be taken as belittling it, nor as denying that it remains an ineluctable substratum of our own, and subject to deliberate or unlooked for eruption. The difference between this world and the world we inhabit is not that the world of animation is governed by physical laws or satisfies metaphysical limits which are just different from those which condition us; its laws are often quite similar. The difference is that we are uncertain when or to what extent our laws and limits do and do not apply</page><page sequence="8">578 THE GEORGIA REVIEW (which suggests that there are no real laws at all). The most obvious abrogations of our limits and laws concern those governing physical identity or destruction. The possibility of metamorphosis, even a tendency toward it, is familiar enough. The abrogation of gravity is manifested in everything from the touching movements of these creatures as they trace their arabesques in the air or climb upon a friendly petal, to the momentary hesitation before a long fall and the crash which shakes the earth but is never fatal. (The topos of the hesitation suggests that what puts gravity into effect is a consciousness of it.) Or rather, what is abrogated is not gravity (things and creatures do fall, and petals are sometimes charmingly difficult to climb up to) but corporeality. The bodies of these creatures never get in their way. Their bodies are indestructible, one might almost say immortal; they are totally subject to will, and perfectly expressive. (Reversing the economy of human expressiveness, their bodies bear the brunt of meaningfulness. Their faces are more or less fixed, confined to two or three attitudes. This condition captures and expresses the condition, the poignance, of real animals.) They are animations, disembodiments, pure spirits. Apparently it is natural for the animation to be of small animals, perhaps because they most immediately convey animatedness, quickness; perhaps because they can be given an upright posture without appearing grotesque or parodistic of the human (like chimpanzees dressed in cute clothes). The horse and the large dog (the usual principals of movies about animals) either have to be taken seriously or else they are merely comic. (Obvious exceptions here are Bambi- whom I have not seen- and Dumbo. But they are both children, and the former is an animal known for its expressive eyes and the uncanny beauty of its motion, while the latter is redeemed by its almost unbelievable discovery that it can fly.) Beasts which are pure spirits, they avoid, or deny, the metaphysical fact of human beings, that they are condemned to both souls and bodies. A world whose creatures are incorporeal is a world devoid of sex and death, hence a world apt to be either very sad or very happy. At either extreme its creatures elicit from us a painful tenderness. If I pursued such thoughts much farther, I would perhaps</page><page sequence="9">STANLEY CAVELL 579 start sounding theoretical. I would, at any rate, wish to locate the specific moods, emotions, and subjects which are natural to (narrative) animation. Natural is no more than natural, and may change with historical or cultural change. It does not mean that no other art can convey the moods and emotions, or employ the subjects, of cartoons; nor that cartoons which compete with movies cannot change. It means that each art and each change will convey and employ these moods and subjects in its own way. For example, cartoon violence can be funny because while it is very brutal it cannot be bloody. (Silent slapstick can achieve this logic; but its violence is often under-cranked, which feels semi- animated; and it is often more imminent than actual; and where active, often occurs between humans and objects, not between humans; and where between humans, often inadvertently or spasmodically.) Cartoon tenderness and loss is tenderness and loss maximized, or purified. Cartoon terror is absolute, because since the body is not destructible, the threat is to the soul itself. (This is different from horror movies. There the threat is not of isolation through abandonment or annihilation, but of isolation through unacknowledgeable disfigurement. They play upon the fear that cartoons laugh at: irreversible metamorphosis.) -Does Popeye have a soul? Well, does he have a human body? A sailor is nicely suited for exaggerated forearms; and fòr the rest, Popeye's body survives, or ignores, everything that brute human strength can deliberately inflict upon it- if, that is, it at some point receives its magic infusion of canned fuel. His body is not so much fed as stoked, and with a substance for herbivores, anyway for creatures of non-violence, for mythical children. (His timid ac- quaintance is also associated with a childish food, ground meat, no real amount of which satisfies his need. Which other human figures are indecorous enough to be shown eating?) Steam up, his body acts on its own, unaligned with, and not affecting, other avenues of expression: his face remains, through violence, preternaturally fixed; his voice goes on with its continuous static of undecipherable commentary; at last his pipe releases a whistle or two of satisfaction. In cartoons, sexuality is apt to be either epicene or caricatured. I suppose this is because cartoons, being fleshless, do not veer toward the pornographic, although, given a chance, they may</page><page sequence="10">580 THE GEORGIA REVIEW naturally veer toward the obscene. Of course, overlaps and af- finities may be expected among various media. A cartoon of Garbo or Dietrich or Marilyn Monroe will miss what is truly attractive about them- not simply their specific physical presences but the animation of those presences by the human female's exemplification of independence and profundity and wit. A car- toon of Mae West, however, may really capture her genius, because she is already a caricature of sexuality; the caricature of sexuality is her subject. It is the essence of her deflationary comedy that her blatant presence signifies nothing special. She is the woman of no mystery, or the woman whose interest has nothing to do with mystery. The invitation of her gait and voice are not suggestive, but epicene- nothing permanent ever happens. The stuffing of her dress is no more revealing than the giant hanging member on the front of an old clown. It is not arousing, but funny and obscene. Her constant self-possession and good humor mock our obsession with the subject of sexuality, both our cravings for it and our evasions of it. Have I missed Sesonske's point about cartoons? Is the point that my characterization of movies as successions of automatic world projections rules out the consideration of cartoons alto- gether as a species of film- that, so to speak, according to me they ought not to exist, or ought not to be able to exist? That would be bad. Then I might say that cartoons are successions of animated world projections. And I would expect this characterization also to be no more helpful, and no emptier, than what it is meant, and may prove, to summarize. Perhaps I am unduly solemn. Perhaps Sesonske's point- when he says that "the two are not that different"- really is confined to the joke in it: not that movies in general and cartoons as such are "not that different," but specifically that Hollywood feature films are mostly mickey mouse. I think that our experiences may really disagree here; if they do, I cannot afford to laugh this off. Everything I wrote in The World Viewed about Hollywood films is perfectly compatible with a claim that most of them are childish or worthless. (Though I am still willing to bet that this is true of no greater a proportion of them than of, say, French or Russian films, a part of whose prestige comes from our knowing so few of them, I assume the best.) My problem was</page><page sequence="11">STANLEY CAVELL 58 1 rather to understand, if the accidents and stringencies of Holly- wood production were the wholly baneful things that devotees of non-Hollywood films suggest, how so many of them could have been so good. (I am not prepared to argue with someone who is prepared to say that all are worthless.) People sometimes say, when their experience of some of these films cannot be denied, that they are good in spite of Hollywood's bosses and agents. But what reason is there to believe this? Does it make any sense at all to think of figures like John Ford or Howard Hawks or Frank Capra or Preston Sturges as limited by Holly- wood? (Perhaps others could have made better Hollywood movies. No; theirs are perfect of their kind. Then other people could have made better movies of different kinds and were kept out by Hollywood commercialism. I do not doubt it, but this is not a problem peculiar to America and its Hollywood.) Shall we blame Hollywood moguls for the obsession with happy endings? We can hear some maddening stories along this line. But this gossip will not account for the good films which call for, and earn, their happy endings. All that the prevalence of the happy ending shows- to the extent that it prevails and to the extent that it is more common in American than in foreign films- is that Hollywood did its best work in genres which call for happy endings. Of course it is arguable that the genres and conventions of Hollywood films are themselves the essential limitation. But to argue that, you have to show either that there are no comparable limitations in other traditions or else that their limitations (say a Russian tendency toward the monumental and operatic, or a French tendency toward the private and provincial, or a German tendency toward the theatrical and claustrophobic) are less limiting. Hollywood films are not everything; neither is American fiction at its greatest. But it is not clear to me that American films occupy a less honorable place among the films of the world than American fiction occupies in world literature. It is typical of my procedures in The World Viewed to invite words or concepts which are common, all but unavoidable, in speaking about film, and then try to discover what there is in these words and in my experience of these objects that they should go together. This means that I must often say things</page><page sequence="12">582 THE GEORGIA REVIEW that will sound more or less familiar. The obvious risks here are that I will either not be credited for saying something new or else not be saying something new. Neither seems to me un- bearable. Sensing an accuracy in the idea of a type, and feeling that film creates new access to drama's ancient concern with types, I traced these intuitions to the fact that on film the type is not primarily the character but primarily the actor. The sets of "fixed attitudes and attributes" by which types are defined- as these are at work in the experience of film- are established by the individual and total physiognomy (of face, of figure, of gait, of temperament) of the human beings taking part in the drama. For this reason, a type on the screen need not be established in theatrical tradition, by the recurrence of a role in a corpus of plays; it can be established by the recurrence of an actor in a corpus of films. (This is why, in my sketching a list of Holly- wood types [p. 36], I mixed together the names of characters and of stars.) This helped explain to me why I find that the distinction between actor and character is broken up on the screen; and I was led to speak of the individuals projected on the screen as individualities and, implicitly, to deny in the ex- periencing of them the distinction between types and well- rounded characters. So I am not likely to be much impressed by the statement that European directors (Sesonske mentions Renoir, Vigo, and Pagnol), unlike Hollywood directors, concern them- selves with characters and not types. I will hardly deny that the major European directors have made different sorts of movies than the major American directors have made; nor am I interested to deny that their films are on the whole better than those made in America. But their differences are not touched, or they are obscured, by saying that the American keep to a concern with types and the European do not. I would find it hard to believe that anyone admires Grand Illusion, Rules of the Geme, Zero for Conduct and V Atalante more than I, but it seems to me more accurate to their intention and effect to say that they are explorations of types rather than explorations of characters. Naturally this could be "proven" only in the specific analysis and experience of the individual works themselves. But just think of the obvious surface of their content.</page><page sequence="13">STANLEY CAVELL 583 The figures in both of the Renoir films are insistently labelled for us: the Aristocrat, the Jew, the Officer, the Professor, the Good Guy, the Poacher, the Wronged Wife, the Impetuous Lover. The shared subjects of the films depend upon this; both are about the arbitrariness and the inevitably of labels, and thence about the human need for society and the equal human need to escape it, and hence about human privacy and unknownness. They are about the search for society, or community, outside, or -within, society at large. So are the films of Vigo. And if four of the greatest films ever made are about the same subject, it gives one to think that film has here found one of its great subjects. It is the subject I found to underlie the Western as well as American thirties' comedies and musicals, and therefore to begin to account for the remarkable fact that works within just these genres are among the highest achievements of the art of film. The terms I used were different: I spoke of individual autonomy and its resemblance to outlawry, and of the claims placed upon autonomy by society and by love. Let us suppose that V Atalante is the best film ever made about the idea of marriage, specifically about the ideas of taking in mar- riage and being given in marriage. The richness and the beauty and the convincingness of the film have nothing to do with anything I understand as a study of character. Compared to Desdemona and Othello, Vigo's bride and groom are, well, mere types. We know and learn next to nothing about them; nothing they do need puzzle us. She is a village beauty who expects to find excitement in the world outside; he becomes frightened and jealous of her attention to attractions which are not within his power to provide; she leaves, more or less innocently; he retaliates by abandoning her; they long for one another; they are happy when they are reunited. The character of the old man is somewhat more developed, but Vigo's concern with it is not to explore it very far. We learn that the old man is superstitious, appreciates women and is successful with them, that he is capable of natural courtesy but also of crudity and selfishness, and that he has been around. In short, an old sailor. We know that he somehow holds the key to the plot or plight of the little community, but this is a function of his actions rather than of his character (if we are to have that distinction) : If this marriage is to take effect- which</page><page sequence="14">584 THE GEORGIA REVIEW the Church, and the community of the village, and apparently satisfactory sex, have all failed to insure- then the old man will have to effect it. That is, he will have to give the bride. He has authority in this because we have seen him win her for himself. This is a nice little yarn and, as in any nice little yarn, there are any number of treasures to be found, any number including zero. They are found here by the resonance that Vigo's camera, with wit, with tact, with accuracy, elicits from their temperaments in those actions in these settings at those times. From that we learn more than we knew of wedding processions, how they can feel like funeral processions, presumably because they com- memorate the dying of the bride to her past; we know more precisely and memorably than we had known of the daze and remoteness of brides, of the innocence of grooms, of the daze and remoteness of a husband who recognizes that he has been no husband; we know more certainly that a man wins a beautiful young girl only when he wins her imagination, i.e., only when he can share his imagination with her, and that if he can do that he may even be ugly and not young; we realize- for the first time or the fiftieth, it makes no difference- that one's respon- sibility to one's desire is to acknowledge it, and acknowledge its object, i.e., acknowledge its object's separateness from you. The power of these last ideas, as they find incarnation in the image of the husband searching under water for his love, is finally as inexplicable as the power of a phrase of music or of poetry. And the ideas are nothing without that power. Of course there is a sense of character explored. It is our own. I am reminded here- and there are passages in my book which show that it kept being reminded- of Thomas Mann's description, in his essay on Freud, of the "point at which the psychological interest passes over into the mythical," and of his assertion that "the typical is actually the mythical." Mann speaks of the step he took as a novelist when his subject-matter moved "from the bourgeois and individual to the mythical and typical" and he finds that "the mythical knowledge resides in the gazer and not in that at which he gazes." Mann locates this knowledge and gaze within "the mythically oriented artist," and what he says seems ap- plicable also to major writers of this century otherwise different from him. What he finds to be an achievement for the novel</page><page sequence="15">STANLEY CAVELL 585 I find to be the natural mode of revelation for film. That gaze of knowledge is the province of camera and screen; it is the power with which the director, in his pact with his audience, begins. -The mythical in the typical. I am not claiming that that is clear. I am explaining why I would like for it to be made clear. Beyond accounting for the irrelevance of character and individual psychology in assessing the significance of screened figures, it suggests the right level of explanation for the familiar fact that mediocre novels often make good film scripts and that great novels almost never do. Sesonske writes: "In the days of silent film it was necessary, of course, to be content with mere types . . . [because] speech is so deeply implicated in the formation and expression of our charac- ter, our identity as individuals. . . . One has to search hard among serious American silent films to find a single credible or really interesting character. But as soon as the actors began to speak, the possibilities changed." Two brief remarks about this, (i) As soon as the actors began to speak, an immediate new possibility was exactly the definition of a type through his particular attitude and attribute of speech: one need think no further than of the best comedians of the early talkies- for example, of Groucho and of Harpo (whose muteness, as well as his particular repertory of sounds, most brilliantly declares the new medium), and of Mae West and W. C. Fields- characters unthinkable apart from their singular voices. (2) It must have been Sesonske's impatience with my views that caused him, I assume, not to consider Chaplin in this light- the Little Man, the Tramp, who is a type, and re- enacts types, as deep as comedy. (Enid Welsford, in her study of folly, more than once emphasizes particular actors in the development of comic stage types. It suggests itself that the early affinity of film with comedy is an expression of their respective latitudes and appetites for the actor's individuality, something that suits each of them for being "popular.") Having spoken of Renoir and Vigo, and remembering afresh the vividness in their films of Michel Simon and Dita Parlo and Jean Gabin and Marcel Dalio, I can hardly avoid recurring to the topic of acting and performance for film. I agree with Sesonske that a number of my remarks on this topic are weak</page><page sequence="16">586 THE GEORGIA REVIEW and unconvincing. And he has called me on a couple of stupid slips. He finds that I had written, "The audience in a theater can be defined as those to whom the actors are present while they are not present to the actors." That is a conflation of two ideas. The first records a theme of some earlier essays of mine in which I define the audience in a theater as those to whom the characters are present while they are not present to the characters; the second contrasts the audience in a movie house as those present neither to the characters nor the actors. Again, I was wrong, in discussing the different ways in which an actor's role is explored for the screen and for the stage, to put this as though it was always the actor who did the exploring and not the director; what I was saying does not depend on any such general division of labor. Sesonske writes: "De Sica and Bresson have not shown that film does not require actors but rather that there is something of the actor in us all. ..." I say that particular people who are successful subjects for the screen may also be accomplished actors. The implication is that whether their accomplishments as actors are relevant to the screen is up to the screen; it cannot be determined a priori , i.e., without experiencing them on the screen. And the same is true of the non-professional's native gifts for acting. When, late in my book, I go back to my initial re- sistance to the idea of film's subjects as actors, what I say is: "But obviously they are actors the way any human being is" (p. 153). Does this say less than "there is something of the actor in us all?" It says that we are all ineluctably actors, leaving it open- as the word leaves it open and as our lives leave it open- how far that means we theatricalize ourselves and how far we are naturalized, fated both to motion and to motive; and it suggests that our condition as actors is shown not particularly by De Sica and Bresson, but by film itself. One might say that what De Sica and Bresson (and others) have shown is that there is something of the type in us all, something of the singular and the mythical. It is not merely that we occupy certain roles in society, play certain parts or hold certain offices, but that we are set apart or singled out for sometimes incomprehensible reasons, for rewards or punishments out of all proportion to anything we recognize ourselves as doing or being, as though our lives are the enactments</page><page sequence="17">STANLEY CAVELL 587 of some tale whose words continuously escape us. The mismatch of intention and consequence was the natural province of tragedy in theater. On film it is the natural province of comedy, and of something that is neither tragedy nor comedy, exemplified by Bicycle Thief or by Nights of Cabiria or by The Diary of a Country Priest, in which the mismatch appears as the distance between the depth to which an ordinary human life requires expression, and the surface of ordinary means through which that life must, if it will, express itself. One may call such forms secular mysteries. De Sica and Bresson are directors, along with Dreyer and Fellini, famous for their interest in unknown physiognomies. One might take this interest as incompatible with my emphasis on the recurrence of actors across their roles. But why? I do say that the use of unknown faces is a special possibility, and I relate its special power to the different powers of recurrence (p. 159). A further way to see its specialness is to compare it with the casting of unknowns in the theater. There the fact of unknown- ness is artistically more or less irrelevant; you take the person best for your conception of the part, or most reliable, or one whom you can afford, or one forced upon you by the management. These considerations are also at play in casting films. But some- times a film director, some film directors in particular, require physiognomies for their subjects which not merely happen to be unknown but whose point, whose essence, is that they are unknown. Not just any unknown face will do; it must be one which, when screened, conveys unknownness; and this first of all means that it conveys privacy- an individual soul's aliveness or deadness to itself. A natural reason for a director's requirement of this quality is that his film is itself about unknownness, about the fact and causes of separateness or isolation or integrity or outlawry. The greatest use of this quality, in my experience, is found in Dreyer's Passion of St. Joan. One of the burdens of my book is that a film of such depth must be giving deep significance to conditions of the medium of film itself. (This is, or ought to be, the meaning of "cinematic.") Dreyer's film above all declares at once the power of the camera to interrogate its subjects and, for all its capacity for pitilessness, its final impotence to penetrate the mystery of the individual human face. -The force of this</page><page sequence="18">588 THE GEORGIA REVIEW declaration is to be measured against the use of known faces, as known, to the same effect, which generally means placing them in unanticipated environments. I give sufficient examples of this in my book to attest to my conviction that this is a tendency of film as such, adjoining its tendency to discover at any moment the endless contingency of the individual human's placement in the world, as though nothing could be more unanticipated than one's existence itself, always in placement. The physiognomies of Chaplin, Keaton, Garbo, perhaps Gary Cooper, consistently explore this experience; they are at home everywhere and nowhere. The mystery of the familiar is caught memorably in the faces of Henry Fonda in The Wrong Man, Cary Grant in Suspicion or in one of his Hawksian disguises, Ginger Rogers in Roxie Hart, Joan Crawford in A W ontani s Face, Billy Burke in The Wizard of Oz, Joe E. Brown in A Midsummer Night's Dream, Rita Hay- worth in The Lady from Shanghai, Montgomery Clift in From Here to Eternity, Burt Lancaster in The Leopard, Clark Gable in The Misfits, and, trailing off, John Garfield in Gentleman's Agreement, and Kirk Douglas in The List of Adrian Messenger. The difference between stage and screen acting cannot be determined apart from determining the differences between stage and screen, between the nature and participation of their audiences and the role of their directors; above all, by the first fact about acting that I looked at in my book- that in a stage performance the actors are present, live, and in a screen performance not. Is this important, or trivial? Mostly it is obscure. What is the screen actor not, if he is not live? Is he dead? Not necessarily, but he could be. He could also be sitting next to me, which he could not be if he were on stage (and I not). -These seem stupid mysteries. Of course it's not him on the screen. Nothing is on the screen, but, at best, moving light and shadows. It's the performance which is live. -As contrasted with what? Since the use of sound transcription and videotaping, "live" per- formances contrast with recorded performances. And it seems that there ought to be this same contrast between what is presented to us on the stage and on the screen. From here it will occur to someone to ask, Then what is a movie a recording of?; to which the answer is apt to be, Nothing. From here, in turn, it may seem to follow that the issue of reality is settled, that movies are "some-</page><page sequence="19">STANLEY CAVELL 589 thing on their own"; the only thing they could be recordings of- real events happening as they are transcribed on the screen- have simply never taken place. Film can be used as a sort of recording device, as in newsreels. But the events in a movie are ones we can never be, or can never have been, present at apart from the movie itself. So the issue about the presence of the world and the actor, raised by Panofsky and Bazin, and modified by me, is a false issue. Movies and their actors are what they are. -With this last assertion I shall hardly disagree. What are they? First of all, movies are not recordings. It is worth seeing why they are not. In calling something a recording (say of a piece of music), two criteria are in play: (1) there is an original, separate event of which this is a recording and to which one can be present directly, so to speak; anyway, present apart from the recording; (2) the recording is in principle aurally indistinguishable from that event, where "in principle" signifies that the essential virtue of a recording is fidelity. Now when someone says that we cannot have been present at the events projected on the screen apart from that projection itself, nothing follows about what is apart from that projection itself. In particular, it does not follow that reality has played no essential role in the origin of that projection. All that follows is that any role reality has played is not that of having been recorded. But reality is not so much as a candidate for that role, because the projections we view on a screen are not in principle aurally or visually indistinguishable from the events of which they are projections- what could be more distinguishable? So to say we cannot have been present apart from the projection does not settle the question of reality; it does not so much as raise it. (Someone may say "can't have been present" because they believe that the issue oughtrit so much as be raised; or they may say it to me in particular because they imagine that I have asserted that one can have been present. We will have to get closer to both of these claims.) Then the state of the present question is this: If reality does play an essential role in understanding the medium of film, and if its role is not that of being recorded, then what is its role? My book gives a series of answers to that question. I describe the role of reality as one of being photographed, projected,</page><page sequence="20">590 THE GEORGIA REVIEW screened, exhibited, and viewed. (These answers are the paths of my differences from Panofsky's and Bazin's emphasis on "reality itself.") The significance I attach to these terms can be assessed, I believe, by nothing short of my book as a whole. Take my speaking of the fate of the camera as one of revealing all and only what is revealed to it. Sesonske calls this a myth of immaculate conception, i.e., one more way of denying the human role in human conceiving. My description certainly was mythological, as the terms "fate" and "revelation" in this context declare. But the mythological point of the description was not exactly to describe purity. My use of the term "camera" in this context, to begin with, stood for the entire physical apparatus which comes between what is before the camera and what results after it, on the screen; it stands for the camera, plus its lenses and filters, plus its film, plus the light required to expose its film, plus the physical procedures of preparing the film for pro- jection. (I am defining the word "camera," so to speak, in terms of its final cause.) Now when I speak of the camera, so understood, as revealing all and only what is revealed to it, I do not limit what is revealed by it merely to the subject which has passed before it. The revelation can, as it were, come from inside. Before the camera, let us say, stands a white building. If what results on the screen is a shaky white building, or a blurred or deformed one, or two identical ones moving past one another, this does not prove unclean conception- unless, perhaps, it prompts us to believe that the building itself is shaking, or is subject to deforma- tion as in a cartoon, or is capable of self-locomotion and spon- taneous self-duplication. The mythological point about the camera's revelations is twofold: first, that the camera has no choice either over what is revealed to it nor over what it reveals; and second, that what is revealed to and by it can only be known by what appears upon the print or screen. The first fold of the point, about the camera's lack of choice, is not an emphasis on its chastity but on its sterility. To say it has no choice is to say that it is a species of machine, a contrivance, and a reasonably simple one at that, compared, say, with a TV set. You can call its work immaculate, not because its conception is produced inhumanly (i.e., automatically), though the extent to which it works automatically is an essential fact about its</page><page sequence="21">STANLEY CAVELL 591 work; but because it has no conception whatever of its own. (A camera is a kind of room, not a kind of womb.) It does all and only what it is made to do. It tells no lies, any more than a type- writer tells lies; not because it is perfectly honest but because it is perfectly dumb. Unlike your use of a typewriter, however, you cannot know what you have made the camera do, what is revealed to it, until its results have appeared. This was the second fold of my mythological point about it: that the mysteriousness of the photograph lies not in the machinery which produces it, but in the unfathomable abyss between what it captures (its subject) and what is captured for us ( this fixing of the subject), the metaphysical wait between exposure and exhibition, the ab- solute authority or finality of the fixed image. The weight of this point is not reduced if some director is in fact able to predict his results with assured accuracy. Hitchcock is famous for this. One might say that he has the gift of photographic prophecy. Or one could explore the possibility that he limits beforehand what he shoots to what he can thus assuredly foretell. I mean explore the possible consequences upon his style. Film turns our epistemological convictions inside out: reality is known before its appearances are known. The epistemological my- stery is whether, and how, you can predict the existence of the one from the knowledge of the other. The photographic mystery is that you can know both the appearance and the reality, but that nevertheless the one is unpredictable from the other. Take again the project I cited in which Edward Steichen took a thousand shots of the same cup and saucer. Each shot, let us suppose, is different, each has a different physiognomy. But do what he will- change lenses, use different film or filters, vary the lighting, the angle, the distance- it is still the same cup and saucer. Therein lies the fascination of the thing of photography, like the fascination in faces. The art of the thing lies in the capacity for finding what will cause what, and for finding what is wanted. I said that the camera has no conception of its own. But it can be said, unlike a recording apparatus, to lead a life of its own, with its own possibilities of variation and inflection. (A tape recorder may also be said to "lead a life of its own." This would mean, apart from certain specific manipulations to improve the quality of its sound, that it is no longer reproducing independently</page><page sequence="22">592 THE GEORGIA REVIEW recognizable sounds, and perhaps that it is not attentive to any sounds at all apart from its own powers of originating them.) These are original with it, and they create its particular tempta- tions, but they are not its sins. They are either its stupidities or its glories, depending upon who is using it. Here is where sin gets a foothold. (The situation is described by Descartes when he is rehearsing the contents of the mind. They may be distorted, but in themselves they are not erroneous. Error arises when you make judgments on the basis of them.) This is the specific topic of the sections of my book called "The Camera's Implication" and "Assertions in Techniques." It is the topic, in my terms, of giving significance to a possibility of film. I say, in effect, that any and every gesture of the camera may or may not mean something, and every cut and every rhythm of cuts, and every framing and every inflection within a frame- something determined by the nature of film and by the specific context in which the gesture occurs in a particular film. I call such possibilities of the physical medium of film its automatisms. They are the bearers of the film maker's intentions- like syntactical and lexical elements of a language. Unlike speakers of a language, film makers can construct not merely, as it were, new sentences, but new elements of sentences. This intentionality of film's automatisms dictates the perspective from which a critical under- standing of a film must proceed. It is a perspective from which a certain level of description is called forth, one in service of the question, "Why is this as it is?"- the critical question- which may be directed toward works of art as toward any of the acts and works of human beings and of their societies. Suppose that it would be true to describe what is shown on the screen as a shot of a stairway. This description may or may not have a point (beyond cataloging the shot) . If one calls what is shown a "point of view shot," one may go on to say that such a shot may be es- tablished by, for example, cutting to it from the face of a character and cutting from it back to that face. This can seem a sort of syntactic remark, like saying that, in English, in standard declara- tive form the object of a verb follows the verb. Its usefulness will depend upon how many further remarks of that sort you are able to offer, and how systematically you arrange them. (The analogy with syntax is extremely thin. The term "verb" carries</page><page sequence="23">STANLEY CAVELL 593 systematic implications on its face, like the term "subdomiiiant," but unlike the terms "travelling shot," "medium shot," "point of view," etc.). If, however, you go on to say why this way of establishing a point of view shot is used, and why here, and why with respect to this character, and why by way of this content, then you are proposing a critical understanding of this passage. Its interest will depend upon its faithfulness to the intention of this work. But what will you be saying if you say, speaking about this work, that this shot is a point of view shot, and you go on to say nothing further about this shot in this work? Unless your words here are meant to correct a false impression, they do not so much as add up to a remark. They are at most the uttering of a name, which, as Wittgenstein puts it, is a preparation for going on to say something. No narrative device is more common than a cut from and to a character as he enters or leaves a room. In Grand Illusion, a film obsessed with the enter- ing and leaving of rooms, with the relations between the inside and the outside of a dwelling, with the impassability of sills and frames, this most common of devices is actively avoided until the beginning of the last act, at the farm. Then we cut from Gabin entering a doorway away from us, still in the cold and foreign night, to Gabin entering through that doorway towards us, into a bright kitchen. The very commonness of the gesture yields to, and acknowledges, the commonness, the anonymity, of the need for warmth and food. Good directors know how to mean everything they do. Great directors mean more- more completely, more subtly, more spe- cifically-and they discover how to do everything they mean. The gestures of bad directors are empty- they speak, as it were, nonsense. The implication of this theme is the absolute responsi- bility of the artist for the actions and assertions in his work. It is an instance of the human being's absolute responsibility for the intentions and consequences of his actions, and a kind of solace for it. (The human condemnation to intention and consequence is the sequel, if not the meaning, of original sin.) My impatience with the idea that photographs and paintings never really project or represent reality (when, that is, they obviously do) expresses</page><page sequence="24">594 THE GEORGIA REVIEW my sense that, as elsewhere, a fake skepticism is being used to deny that human responsibility. We may need freedom from this responsibility, but the denial of its claims is no route to that freedom, except within the bounds of comedy or of religion. Film is a moving image of skepticism: not only is there a reasonable possibility, it is a fact that here our normal senses are satisfied of reality while reality does not exist- even, alarmingly, because it does not exist, because viewing it is all it takes. Our vision is doubtless otherwise satisfiable than by the viewing of reality. But to deny, on skeptical grounds, just this satisfaction- to deny that it is ever reality which film projects and screens- is a farce of skepticism. It seems to remember that skepticism concludes against our conviction in the existence of the external world, but it seems to forget that skepticism begins in an effort to justify that conviction. The basis of film's drama, or the latent anxiety in viewing its drama, lies in its persistent demonstration that we do not know what our conviction in reality turns upon. To yield here to the familiar wish to speak of film as providing in general an "illusion of reality" would serve to disguise this latent anxiety- as does the conclusion of philosophical skepticism itself. This idea of the illusion of reality dims the differences in the role of reality posed in painting, in theater, and in film, and it closes out the wish of art to address reality in order to combat, or to suspend, our illusions of it. The "sense of reality" played upon in comedy and by religion, or searched by philosophy and in tragedy, is neither enforced nor escaped through film; one might say that it is there entertained. The moral of film's image of skepticism is not that reality is a dream and not that reality confines our dreams. In screening reality, film screens its givenness from us; it holds reality from us, it holds reality before us, i.e., withholds reality before us. We are tantalized at once by our subjection to it and by its subjection to our views of it. But while reality is the bearer of our intentions it is possible, as I put it in my book, to refuse to allow it to dictate what shall be said about it (p. 120). Flanked by its claims to speak for us, it is still open to us in moments to withhold it before ourselves, so that we may see for ourselves and may gladly grant that we are somewhere spoken for. To</page><page sequence="25">STANLEY CAVELL 595 know how far reality is open to our dreams would be to know how far reality is confined by our dreams of it. One will perhaps wish here to distinguish between natural and social reality (or between epistemological and political "given- ness"). But I doubt that we yet know what becomes, on film, of the distinction, hence the relation, between nature and culture, or between individual and society. Nature is naturally projected as the scene of specific human occupation; contrariwise, society tends to be projected in human relations which are either wholly personal or wholly anonymous. I mentioned in The World Viewed the tendency of film to project the idea of community in the form of male comradeship (p. 48), as though the sense of belonging together as citizens could only appear as an intimacy of discipline, and only after the nation had been threatened (as by war) or exercised its rejection (as by prisons). (Work can provide pools of comradeship if it has an internal drama and involves the adventure of danger- rigging and drilling for oil comes to mind; but the possibility of comradeship within factories seems available only for propaganda, as an image of mobilization, or for the explicitly fantastic.) It is common enough for social evil to be projected as the deliberate product of melodramatic aging villains. Capra's It's a Wonderful Life most innocently re- veals a further range of this fantasy. The hero's ruin is averted when the good people, the little people, band together with their individual contributions, returning personal favors done for them over the years by this man. The sentiment in the scene is very deep. It has been constructed as cunningly as a Keaton gag; what caps it, finally bursting the dam of tears, is the crowding of this band of goodness into this hero's house, each member testifying individually to his or her affection for him; so that the good society, the good of society at large, is pictured as this man's family (personally sponsored, what's more, by a denizen of heaven). This justice, hence this society, is poetic or nothing. The film adopts the terms, and at least equals the effect, of A Christmas Carol, told as it were from Cratchit's point of view. I would forego its effect if we had something to equal, say, Bleak House. But in that case the effect would not be so worrisome. One may think to settle the issue of reality by saying something</page><page sequence="26">5 дб THE GEORGIA REVIEW like this: "Let us agree that movies are made of incisions, in- gestions, projections, and what not, of reality. Then it is just a matter of emphasis whether you go on to study the significance of the fact that the ingestions and projections are manipulated and arranged (e.g., edited) or whether you go on to study the fact that the manipulated and arranged projections are of reality." This sounds sensible enough, and I do not wish to appear un- reasonable; but I cannot accept this idea of alternative and non- competing emphases, for two main reasons. 1 . Generally, because a difference of emphasis may, in philoso- phizing, make all the difference in the world. Whether you emphasize nature's likenesses or unlikenesses to an artifact may determine whether you wind up with a proof for the existence of God. Whether you emphasize the likenesses or the unlikenesses between men and women may determine what you take their relationship to promise. Whether you emphasize liberty or equality may determine whether you are a liberal or a socialist. The question is why your emphasis falls where it does, and whether it makes sufficient and exact room for the competing emphasis. This is a theoretical question, anyway a philosophical question, which only means that it is not going to be settled by any given set of instances alone. Take, for example, Dziga Verto v's Man With a Movie Camera , which is at the least a brilliant anthology of the tricks a loaded camera and fixed and refixed film can play. It is a natural example for someone to appeal to who wishes to emphasize film's independence of reality. But it is fully open to me to say that what this film shows is precisely the inescapability of reality, its fixed point within every brilliance of technique. It would not in fact be so good an instance for my emphasis unless its technique were an extreme of brilliance, for only then would it suggest that the extremest bound of tech- nique is still leashed to reality. It is only within this theoretical issue that a simpler fact about this film's declaration of reality can make itself felt, viz., that all virtuosity of technique is quite overwhelmed, or silenced, by a shot of childbirth. 2. My more specific reason for rejecting the sensible proposal about alternative emphases is that there is no sensible alternative of the kind proposed. To speak of reality photographed, pro- jected, screened, exhibited, and viewed, just is to speak of the</page><page sequence="27">STANLEY CAVELL 597 specific ways in which- arrangements in which and successions by which- reality is projected, screened, etc. This is another way of emphasizing what I called "giving significance to specific possibilities and necessities of the physical medium." Whereas, alternatively, to speak of the arrangements and successions of pro- jections apart from the fixed point of reality is to block com- prehension of why the arrangements and successions are as they are. Such a claim can only be proven in the analysis and criticism of particular films; that is the only source of evidence there is for any theory of film- but as usual only the theory can tell you what to look for, or what counts, as evidence. If, as suggested, someone believes that we never see reality as it is, with or without a camera, on the basis of some epistemological or scientific theory of vision, then immediately he owes us a presentation of this theory. (If one believes that projection inevitably distorts what is seen, then this must be compared with cases in which one is convinced that projection alone can reveal what is seen- as, for example, in a slow-motion shot of a moment of impact, or a time-lapse sequence of a gathering storm.) Whether or not this theory is forthcoming, however, I am content to proceed on the assumption that the camera is no better off epistemologically or scientifically than the naked eye- that the camera provides views of reality only on the assumption that we normally do, apart from the camera, see reality, i.e., see live persons and real things in actual spaces. (The fact that one and the same cup and saucer can appear in continuous variations and inflections of light and of angle may play a role in the conclusion that we never see objects as they are. But as it stands this fact is as unexceptional as the fact that you could not see the cup and saucer were they in total darkness. What else would you expect? -There is also no end to the ways these objects may be picked out in words; but variations and inflections among alternative words are not naturally con- tinuous. This difference will affect what counts "as possibilities" in photographing and in writing, hence what counts as giving or showing the significance of these possibilities in what you choose them to say.) If, again, one denies that it is reality which is projected, on the ground that spatial or temporal relations within and among projections are not the same as spatial or temporal relations within</page><page sequence="28">598 THE GEORGIA REVIEW and among real things and persons, I may not be much moved to disagree- as long, that is, as one sees that such a remark says either practically nothing or practically everything ambiguously. To say that spatial and temporal relations in reality are not what they are in the projection of reality would be a way of saying at least two things. It would repeat and begin to specify the point that projections are not recordings, they do not reproduce what they are of- in the sense that a reproduction of a statue reproduces the dimensionality of the statue (is another statue), or the repro- duction of a painting reproduces the dimensionality of the paint- ing. And it would stress the fact that the physical medium of film, like the physical medium of painting (paint on a two- dimensional surface), or like an aesthetic medium of literature (e.g., one of its genres), obeys its own laws, has its own autonomy- even when it is also a representation of reality. So, for example, you can compose a slow-moving narrative of a fast- moving horse race, and you can represent a horse rearing in a painting which itself does not rear. You merely have to know, or find out, how to do it; and your audience merely has to know how to read what you have done. You might, having now stressed the autonomy of the medium, its obedience to its own laws, then go on to discover and publish what those laws, or some set of them, are. You might, for example, discover some syntactical laws (as it were) governing this medium's power of narration (but then, of course, one will have to know what you understand its lexicon to be). Or you might really discover particular ways in which the two- dimensionality of the projection, or of the screen, is organized in order to capture certain dramatic or fictional qualities of the three-dimensional space it projects.* Such laws, whose promulga- tion I could only welcome, will take their place in position with the other facts about this medium which we know, or believe, to enter into its working, e.g., with the fact that it is photo- graphic, and therefore, to draw one further inference from this proposition, that the general relation between a projection and what it projects is not an achievement within the medium (as in the *1 know that Sesonske has made such discoveries in the work he is completing on the films of Renoir. I mention this not only because I expect his work to constitute a fundamental statement in the aesthetics of film, but to urge him publicly to bring, it out with all deliberate speed.</page><page sequence="29">STANLEY CAVELL 599 relation between a visual representation and what it represents) but constitutes the inception of the medium altogether, so that exploring the physical basis of the medium is not, as in the case of painting, like exploring and mastering the uses of tools but rather like exploring and mastering the powers of an instrument, such as the Hammond organ. The possibility invites one, accord- ingly, to become a virtuoso of the instrument without, so to speak, being able to say anything upon it of any significance. The moral is merely that if one is to discover laws for the artistic medium which takes the medium of film as its physical basis, one will first of all have to know which players of the instrument have been able to speak significantly upon it, and what it is they have been saying. A further motive for denying the fixed point of reality is the supposition that this leaves no room for the art of movies. A poor reason for the supposition is that this seems to leave no room for the work of the cinematographer. This pictures the cinematogra- pher in terms of his manipulations of his equipment and images. Whereas I have wished to insist upon his, in principle, incessant exercise of insight and choice, for example, upon -whether to manipulate, and how, and how much; and to emphasize that this exercise begins before there is anything to cut or pan or freeze, and continues until he has the insight, and the choice, to stop. A better reason for supposing the fixed point of reality to crowd out the art of movies is that, as remarked, realism had become, at the time of the advent of photography and continuing through the advent of the motion picture, the central issue in the practice of the other major representative arts. This is why I felt drawn into a discussion of modernist painting, beginning a couple of centuries ago, as a history of responses to the loss of connection with reality and a consequent history of painting's ways of reestablish- ing this connection, which in practice required a self-conscious reestablishing of its connection with the past of its art. I described the artistic significance of the motion picture (whatever its new powers of entertainment and documentation) as its apparent and unpredictable solution of the problem of reality at a stroke, by its miraculous neutralizing of the need to connect with reality through representing it, by its stroke of acquiring this connection through successive projections of reality itself. And I went on</page><page sequence="30">6 OO THE GEORGIA REVIEW to say that this had also not solved the problem of reality but brought it to some ultimate head, since the connection is es- tablished by putting us in the condition of "viewing unseen," which establishes the connection only at the price of establishing our absolute distance and isolation. And this is exactly the price of skepticism. -My complaint against the complaint against me to the effect that I am naive about reality is that it is naive about reality. There are more obvious reasons for taking my emphasis on reality to be misguided. I mention two of them. ( i ) My insistence seems just to deny the obvious fact that what appears on the screen may not be real from the beginning; the props may be fake and the backgrounds painted. (2) It seems to neglect the decisive role, in our experience of film, of composition within the frame. i. Let us distinguish between the counterfeit and the artificial, between cases in which the fake props and painted backgrounds are meant to fool the camera into thinking that what is revealed to it is reality, and cases in which their point is explicitly their non-reality. Explicit artifice is, first of all, quite rare; not just rare, but specialized. The instances I cite in my book are from German expressionism and from technicolor make-believes. Suppose that the only point of reality in these films is the ultimate point in any film, namely the actors- not a real animal or tree or sky or meadow or body of water to be found. Then what happens is that the locales of such films are given a specialized psychological or spiritual interpretation; we interpret them as projections of the characters', or some character's, state of soul, as their dreams, their fantasies, their madness. We interpret them in one direction or another, that is, as competing with our sense of reality. This means that the acting must be as stylized as the locale; dictated by it, so to speak. I assume this is obvious in Caligari. In The Wizard of Oz you have, within the dream, just two characters who are not of this artifice, whose sense of reality is ours, a young girl and her dog. The unmasking of the Wizard is a declaration of the point of the movie's artifice. He is unmasked not by re- moving something from him but by removing him from a sort of television or movie stage, in which he had been projecting and</page><page sequence="31">STANLEY CAVELL 6oi manipulating his image. His behavior changes; he no longer can, but also no longer has to, maintain his image, and he demonstrates that the magic of artifice in fulfilling or threatening our wishes is no stronger than, and in the end must bow to, the magic of reality; that, for example, Margaret Hamilton on a broomstick in the sky of Oz and Margaret Hamilton on a bicycle in a black- and-white projection of Kansas, taps one and the same source of power, call it the human craving for reality, call it the craving for our fantasies and reality to complete or to project one another. The case of counterfeiting reality is the typical case. Here we have the whole history of movie production technology, with its special effects, back-projections, miniatures, false fronts, etc. Doesn't all of this just immediately go to show how unnecessary the fact of reality is? On the contrary, it goes to show just how necessary it is, or how it is necessary. For the point of all this elaboration of machinery is exactly that it shall serve for reality, from the camera's point of view. To unmask such tricks is the treat for certain sensibilities; they will delight in production shots which show a half-constructed tree-trunk next to an actor standing on a box to give him more height than his leading lady. But all such facts, however interesting they are, like gossip, and however neces- sary the knowledge may be to certain makers of film, is of no more significance in viewing and assessing a film than it is, in reading and assessing the achievement of a novel, to know the working habits of the novelist. -I do not mean to confine the natural interest there is in technology to the level of gossip, or to the level of pleasure in unmasking achieved by the inside dopester. Nor would I wish to slight the fact that technology plays a role in the cinematic art unlike its role in any of the other arts. Because of its natural interest, and this role, one may well include, one often has included, the technology of movie making as part of the mise-en-scène of movies. The technology of architecture is at least as complex, and it has an appeal which plays directly into the artistic appeal of architecture- not merely an intellectual appeal to the engineers who participate in its invention and construction, but an appeal as spectacle and drama to those who watch its structures being raised or felled, or their sites excavated. The technology of painting has lately appeared to be the business of non-painters, but its mastery- say yoking colors,</page><page sequence="32">6o2 THE GEORGIA REVIEW or staining them in- remains part of the work of a lifetime. The technology of writing is nothing in comparison, yet the relation between constructing a line and constructing a sentence has pro- vided study for more than one millenium óf poets. The interest there may be in the fact that all writing is visible, is made with, say, ink on paper, of successive letters, is less interestingly declared in, say, Mallarmé's Un Coup de Dés than in Bresson's Diary of a Country Priest (in which the physical commitment in writing is brought under investigation in full-frame shots of a school- boy's notebook being filled with silent thoughts, and the act of writing is shown, through an identification of ink and wine, to be this Priest's sustenance and suicide). The artistic moral of all the machinery of fakery is the same as the moral of photographic projection itself: that only what appears within the projected frame counts, exists for the film. The rest is mere convenience. What you can get away with, or have a real need for, are empirical matters to be discovered, as with everything else to do with film, only by screening it. When a convenience is no longer convenient, it drops out of use, like an out-house. Of course certain survivors from an older generation will persist in thinking that only the out-house is proper, or worth the inconveniences of distance and bad weather. And when you see the results of the newer technology and social developments which made the studios at the same time unnecessary and too expensive, you realize that the older generation is not, in all cases, wrong. But then mere convenience was never the whole issue. The insistence on reality is not a matter of ethical purity but of cinematic fact. It does not alter this fact if, to place your characters in a particular house, you build from scratch as much of the house as you need for the camera to see, or whether you start with an actual house and tear down as much of it as you need for your camera to move around in as you wish it to. On the stage, two trees may constitute a forest, and two brooms the two trees; for the screen, this would yield only two brooms. A stage empty of everything but a couple of platforms may be made to constitute everything from the Roman Senate to the bedroom of Caesar's wife, to a field of battle; on the screen, it is an empty stage with a couple of platforms on it. (You may</page><page sequence="33">STANLEY CAVELL 603 wish to exploit this fact on the stage itself, e.g., use the naked back wall of the theater building, and the radiator suspended from its middle, and the theater work-lights and work-ladders, as impersonations of themselves. This is not the denial of theater but a simple-minded declaration of it. In any case, it requires a new bargain with the audience; it remains in each case to be seen whether it is worth their while.) The screen contracts for its powers of illusion by destroying incompatible powers, some- times by turning them to its own necessities, as in the other arts. On the screen, a view horizontal to the action reaches all the way to the horizon, unless its visibility is stopped- not by con- vention but in fact, say by an interposed object or atmosphere or by darkness or by a close-up which wholly or almost wholly fills the frame and blurs or obscures what is left. You can- if you can- fool the camera by giving it the horizon through painting it or back-projecting it. But this trompe Г appareil is no more essential to cinema than trompe l'oeil is essential to realistic paint- ing. And either may be in service of an art which is not "realistic." 2. A second obvious feature of film that my emphasis on reality may seem to deny, or not so much to deny as to neglect, is the importance of the way reality is shaped on film, not merely by the juxtaposition of shots but by its ordonnance within the individual frame. Some theorists of film will wish to lay their emphasis on this fact, or rather on an interpretation of this fact, viz., that what is within the film frame is composed, as if the frames of which movies consist are to be read as paintings, certain kinds of paintings. Now it is certainly compatible with what I have written that a cinematographer should treat the frame as if it were the frame of a painting. This is, for me, one pos- sibility of film, one more fact of the medium whose significance is to be discovered. Let us try briefly to locate this discovery. I start by reminding myself of the significance of the film frame generally, of the sense in which, as I put it in The World Viewed, it has the opposite significance of the frame in painting. Following Bazin's suggestion that the screen works as much by what it excludes as by what it includes, that it functions less to frame than to mask (which led me to speak of a photograph as of a segment of the world as a whole), I interpreted the frame</page><page sequence="34">6o4 THE GEORGIA REVIEW of a film as forming its content not the way borders or outlines form, but rather the way looms or molds form. The frankest acknowledgment I remember of the camera's exclusion, hence of its continuous implication of what is beyond the frame, occurs in George Cukor's Adonis Rib. There the camera is trained for a whole scene on Tracy's and Hepburn's bedroom, now empty, save intermittently, of their commanding presences, attending motionlessly as they shout to one another across the vacant space from one dressing room to the other, hers just left and out of the visual frame, his just right. The effect is the opposite of speaking across a void (a different director may want that effect and be able to get it with something like this set-up); here it projects an intimacy which does not require visible presence. The effect is to increase our intimacy with these figures because their invisible and pervasive presence to us puts us in the same relation to each of them in this passage as they bear to one another. It is not every marriage that one would care to become that intimate with. This scene is prepared by the longer one which precedes it, where the camera was also un- moving throughout, and at the same unobtrusive angle, but with its frame filled with three characters sitting at a table talking; yet nothing is significant here but what is, apparently routinely, shown. So the camera can do this too, and be equally interesting- if, that is, you have at your disposal, and dialogue with which to dispose, Katharine Hepburn and Judy Holliday and a support- ing actress strong enough to bear up in such company, and if you see how to open the field behind these figures by placing a witness to them against a far wall. (Cukor's "implication beyond the frame" in the empty bedroom scene is just beyond it to the sides. It thus exploits the typical region of cinematic narrative implication, in which a definite visible something is explicitly denied our view. This possibility has provided cliché devices for local suspense- as when the camera moves in upon a woman's listening face, limiting the view, hence widening the area, of the regions from which something may pounce- or for cowardly or tactful withdrawals from a scene of sexuality or violence. So suspicious have we become, in our freedom, of this mode of implication that any avoidance of the visually explicit may be felt as cowardice. I assume this to be under discussion in the long</page><page sequence="35">STANLEY CAVELL 605 back-tracking of Hitchcock's camera in Frenzy, recoiling from a scene of implied violence after the shutting of a door in its face. What is implied is not beyond the sides of the frame but beyond its blocked horizon, and the horrified wittiness of the backing gesture is capped when, later showing us what went on behind that door, Hitchcock shows us practically nothing at all of the event, which is again happening beyond the side of the frame, or rather below it.*) My suggestion, once again, is not that composition has no significance, but that any significance it has can be assessed only on the basis of what it is a composition of- in movies, that it is one of a succession of automatic world projections. For the idea of "composition" to carry for film anything like its weight in speaking of paintings, the various degrees of motion in the suc- cession of projections will have to be stilled, at least the motions of the camera and the motions of its subjects at a given moment. For if either the frame or the subject budges, the composition alters. This is of course, even so, the merest of analogies, for the current of frames through the projector cannot be stilled (unless for analysis), so that the liveness of a motionless camera on a motionless subject remains altogether different in its significance from the stillness of a still depiction- as is trivially declared on film by the possibility of freeze frames. The liveness itself sug- gests that what we are shown on the screen is always only one of an endless number of equally possible views, that nothing the camera does can break out of the circle of viewing; we are always outside; there is no perfect, or most significant, view. This is one of the meanings of the 360 degree track Hitchcock's camera traces around the embracing couple in Vertigo. We see them from every angle- at least every angle from a certain head- high height- and the effect is to accept as final their privacy with one another. Again it is well to insist that this meaning is a function of this 360 degree track, in this context, in this film. It is doubtless to be 'William Rothman, in his doctoral dissertation on aesthetics and cinema (Harvard, 1973), argues, to my mind convincingly, that a particular relation between the shown and the unshown is central to Hitchcock's narrative style, and that this relation develops in a consistent direction throughout bis oeuvre. His comments on a late draft of the present essay caused me at half a dozen points to correct or qualify or expand what I had said, for each of which I am grateful.</page><page sequence="36">боб THE GEORGIA REVIEW expected that all 360 degree tracks enforce some range of sig- nificance in common; but it is certain that if there is some range of common significance in this automatism it can only be dis- covered empirically, after the critical analysis of all individual 360 degree tracks. (All? Well, a goodly corpus of all to date. All that matter, that is; all that native viewers accept as significant. Enough to guide the empirical discovery of the a priori. Why not? Criticism, as part of the philosophy of art, must aspire to philosophy. Its goal is the native view; the desophisticated.) In Vertigo, the circling track cocoons the couple within the man's fantasy, which the woman cannot share but is drawn to realize. The world is circling and the couple are circling and the man is circling alone- a compounding which befits a climate and climax of vertigo. The succession of the man's images are neither really seen nor merely imagined nor simply remembered by him. They are projections and successions of the reality he enacts. They in- voke the status of film images. But they simultaneously violate this status. They do not proceed from a position outside the world whose perspective is in principle shareable; they do not imply the world as a whole, but select fragments from it whose implication is for him alone. They are not therefore meaningless but, as in madness, destroy the distinction between meaning and loss of meaning, between possibility and impossibility. They thus declare this woman's reality for this man, who invokes and violates her presence. If one thinks of the Romance, say of The Winter's Tale, as the satisfaction of impossible yet unappeasable human wishes, and hence as defining a presiding wish of movies generally, one might think of Vertigo as a declaration of the end of Romance. Rules of the Game, The Children of Paradise, The Earrings of Madame de ... , and The Birds are other instances.* *The terms I associate with "the end of romance," together with the earlier terms I associated with what I called "secular mysteries," especially the idea of "the mismatch between the depth to which an ordinary human life requires expression and the surface of ordinary means through which that life must express itself," provide terms in which I would like to describe Terrence Malick's Badlands. Whatever the objections to trusting one's re- sponses to a friend's film, particularly, I suppose, after just one viewing, the objections to keeping still can grow no less grave. For the moment I simply raise my hand in favor of the film, prepared to say this much: It is a film that invokes and deserves the medium's great and natural power for giving expression to the inexpressive, In everything from the enforced social silence, or shyness, of Chaplin and Keaton to the enforceable personal silence, or reserve, of Bogart and Cooper. It presses questions we ought to</page><page sequence="37">STANLEY CAVELL 6oj The incompleteness, or outsideness, or contingency of the angle of viewing, the fact that each is merely one among endless pos- sibilities, is most perspicuously declared, in my experience, in the work of Carl Dreyer. In the Passion of St. Joan , whose subject is so much the human face, the face in profile is given particular sig- nificance. The judges in profile are revealed as conspirators, whispering into an ear, or hiding their expressions; whereas it is in profile that Joan is revealed as most lucid to herself. It is in profile that she becomes the accuser of her accusers, turns upon them; and in profile that we last glimpse her Passion at the stake. The general implication is that one view of a face eclipses all others, and that we can be given only one at a time. (In case someone supposes that we could defeat this fact by the use of mirrors, it should be said that the doubling of view by a mirror can serve first of all to distract us from the experience of either view, and perhaps to show that two are, in this case, no better than one, that two are just as far from completeness. But the particular significance of the mirror will arise from the individual case.) How Dreyer specifically manages this significance of the have made ourselves answer. What is the faith that understands silent strength to be in service of the good? What words would such strength find in which to express itself? For in the end something must he said for our lives. We are saying something now, always, or allowing it to be said. When someone is born, or dies, or marries, or graduates, or has a birthday, millions still allow an ordinary drug store card to express their sentiments. Fewer millions, I guess, are more sophisticated and entrust their sentiments only to a more expensive comic drug store card. I do not deny that in such events it is better to see that something is said than to care overly about what is said. But if it is the spirit that counts, what happens when we no longer understand the spirit? - In what spirit does the killer in Badlands say that he "has a lot to say"? In what spirit does Malick baffle this claim by showing the boy unable even to fill a sixty-second recording in a van- dalized Record-Your-Own-Voice booth? In what spirit does the girl entrust the narration of her life to the rack of phrases picked from magazine shelves? Which shelves would you recommend? To have company under whatever sky, you will have to entrust its conformation to whichever booth of expression you can occupy. One might hear a resemblance between this girl's voice and the occasional voices in recent years taped from some place of violent secession. Patricia Hearst's message early last June, concerning the shootout in Los Angeles the month before, is the latest instance I am aware of. (A not entirely unrelated dissociation occurred in the farewell speech during the morning of August 9, 1974, concerning the death of Theodore Roosevelt's young wife.) Then one should ask whether the words of the narrator in Badlands , or her tone or spirit, would have been different, or hearable by us differently, if she had been narrating events we could find good. Is one prepared to say that if the events had been good then the message had not required taping? To whom, from where, does one address a letter to the world? To what end does one wish to leave one's mark upon the world?</page><page sequence="38">6o8 THE GEORGIA REVIEW profile in this film can only be determined, once again, by an analysis and criticism of the elements and of the whole of this film; and because it is a masterpiece of the medium of film, this analysis should result in an analysis of the possibilities of film itself. Another of the elements of this film arises from the possibility of zoning the screen space; in particular the left side of the screen, and more particularly the upper left quadrant, is zoned for special intensities of mood. -But how do you know what an "element" of cinematic significance is? You do not know in advance of critical analysis. Nothing- no variation or combination of angle, distance, duration, composition, and motions between- can be ruled out in advance as a sign of significance. Nothing would count as a nonsense syllable or as an ungrammatical se- quence, except perhaps after something that would count as a semantical analysis. From a linguistic point of view, this seems backwards, or incomprehensible. It suggests that film has neither a lexicon nor a grammar. Then why try to think of film as a language? Because the gestures of the camera are, or are supposed to be, significant, and because there is no known end to the significance they may have. If one thinks of a grammar as a machine for generating sentences, then perhaps one will wish to speak of the camera and its film as a machine for generating idioms. Then when one of its proposals is in fact used significantly, you will have a specification of the cinematic. This will be a specification of the cinematic not as that which is grammatical but as that which is idiomatic to film. One welcome consequence of this undisguised nonsense is that one would not then think of the cinematic as conveying significance that camiot be conveyed in another medium but as conveying a particular significance in this (critically specified) way. Dreyer's last film, Gertrud, made some thirty-five years after Joan, trades on and refines- with the refinement and concentra- tion at the command of a lifetime of work- the fact of the limited- ness, or arbitrariness, of the single view. The significance in this film depends upon a procedure which brings composition within the frame of motion pictures to its maximum analogy (excluding the use of stills) with the composition in paintings. The camera, once placed, is typically stilled for long minutes at a stretch, so</page><page sequence="39">STANLEY CAVELL 609 that there is something recognizable as a frame; and it remains about as still as a camera following the motions of speaking, listening human beings can be. Just as the characters depicted are about as still as speaking, listening human beings can be. They pose and repose themselves against a total, simplified environment, as for a painting or a still portrait, and the result is not the com- memorative or candid significance of paintings or still photo- graphs, but the opacity of self-consciousness. The emotion con- veyed is of theatricality, and the cause of the emotion lies not in the drama of the characters' words and gestures but in our sense that they are characters before themselves, that our views of them are their views of themselves. Their views are not caused by ours, by their awareness that they are being watched from outside; their awareness is of being watched from inside. After God, they are God to themselves. Our views of them come after the fact. Here is one view, -or one form, of the life of the mind, or the life of the love of the mind. The idea of love is itself eroticized and becomes part of the fact of love, so that faithlessness is faithlessness to the idea, i.e., a heresy. I call this the opacity of self-consciousness to distinguish it from the lucidity of self-consciousness, the capacity to exist for others, to acknowledge and accept the limitedness of the others' views of oneself, most perfectly expressed, as I claimed in my book, by the greatest of the courtesan figures of film, Garbo and Dietrich; to them I would now add, in all seriousness, Mae West. The idea raised in Gertrud is that the condition of privacy, of unknownness, of being viewed- the human condition- is itself the condition of martyrdom, the openness to interrogation and rejec- tion; the question raised is whether a refusal to accept this con- dition causes greater suffering than the suffering of martyrdom itself- whether martyrdom is as necessarily the cause as it is the effect of intolerance. The sense of constriction about these characters- the sense that they are limited or condemned to the same views of themselves that we are given- produces a sense that it is they who are selecting these views, as if their spiritual energies are exhausted in the effort to find some perfect or com- plete view of themselves to offer and to retain. The freedom of the courtesan figures I have contrasted with them lies in their</page><page sequence="40">6lO THE GEORGIA REVIEW indifference to such a question, in their sense not so much that they are invulnerable as that there is no interrogation or rejection whose terms they cannot dictate, or afford. They may be taken, but never unawares. Defining their individualities would require defining their indi- vidual handlings of their authority over intrusion, settling the terms upon which they yield. Each has her own relation to solitude, to dominance, to sensuality, to gazes, to reputation, to laughter, to innocence. They seem (thinking of them from the thirties) to triangulate the classical possibilities outside of marriage. If Garbo is the human female at her most private and West the human female at her most public (and the extreme terms could be reversed), Dietrich is the human female awaiting both- vulnerable to change, to mutual knowledge. She is at home on the stage but also prepared to give it up. Change for Garbo is world-changing mood, or death; change for West is repetition. West's songs are not confessions and not addressed to a» un- known one, but are part of her instruction; singing them does not display her wares but collects the options at her disposal. West mocks the glamour of the others; Garbo mocks the familiarity of the others; Dietrich mocks the rigidity of the others, per- mitting herself indignity if she chooses. Garbo suffers the solitude that is not overcome by love, Dietrich the solitude that is. Neither Garbo nor West have secrets, in the former case because her secrets are the world's, in the latter case because the world has no secrets. And neither is subject to gazes, Garbo because she is beyond them and determines them, West because she is before them and disarms them. Unlike Dietrich, the others have no rivals, Garbo because she has no challenger, West because no man is worth the challenge. Dietrich's perversity declares her privacy and her willingness to share her tastes. Her donning of the man's hat is not an offer of dominance but an act of identification. It is a term of equality. West offers to share her favors, and her terms propose equality with all others. Garbo will share her realm, and the terms require the ceding of the wish for equality. Each acknowledges her need for yielding, for partaking of a man. West yields for the moment, out of interest or sympathy; Dietrich out of trust and for as long as it lasts; Garbo for the yielding</page><page sequence="41">STANLEY CAVELL 6 II itself, and forever. West suggests and invites; Garbo recognizes and commands; Dietrich looks and, if she likes, leaps. Dreyer's power with cinematic stillness, with the stasis of the frame, suggests that one significance of Eisensteinian montage may lie fundamentally not in the juxtaposition and counterpoint of images but in the fact which precedes that juxtaposition or counterpoint, viz., that it demands, and is demanded by, individual images which are themselves static or which contain and may compound movements that are simple or simply cumulative (for example, the inexorable movements of the sea or of a tremendous construction, or of a group or a crowd of persons) and which unify the entire reach of the frame, left to right and bottom to top. If, say, the design of light and shadow made by certain frames of the Odessa steps is less significant than the fact that this design fills and simplifies the entire frame, then the sense conveyed may be that any pose of nature or society is arbitrary and subject to human change, that no event is humanly un- graspable, and that none can determine the meaning that human beings who can grasp it are free to place upon it. Now suppose that this significance is destroyed if this reach of content is budged from just this frame; and suppose further that how long this may or must be held, to yield this significance, is determined by just this reach. (As how large a particular series of canvases must be may be determined by the reach of a continuous hue.) Then the fact that this frame must, at a particular instant, be jumped from, discontinuously, to another frame (of a similar or dissimiliar species) will be determined not by any inherent neces- sity of montage for film narrative but by the necessities of this species of frame. It would follow that montage is necessary to film narrative only on the assumption that a certain species of frame is necessary. This is clearly subject to experimentation. It is worth at least mentioning, however, because on a certain favored form of experimentation this question cannot be tested- I mean the form which takes a particular strip of film (say, the Odessa steps sequence) and rearranges its shots. However much you will learn about the internals of montage procedure from such exercises, you cannot answer from them what may be an equally intelligible and basic question, viz., what it is about certain species of frames that requires stasis and discontinuity; there is</page><page sequence="42">6 1 2 THE GEORGIA REVIEW no continuous material of the right kind to contrast with what is on this strip. If I am right about this, it suggests itself that Eisenstein's theories of montage are responses as much to the giving of in- struction in film making as they are to film making itself. This would not be surprising. In Must We Mean What We Say}, I had occasion to remark a comparable feature in the development of the New Criticism (at the opening of "The Avoidance of Love") and in the practices of ordinary language philosophy (at the close of "Austin at Criticism"). Since good instruction has goals beyond itself, and since its goals are internally related to the goals of the subject under instruction, the moral I draw is not that the methodical pursuit of an art is fruitless, but that the pursuit of no one method will yield everything. The richness of Eisenstein's observations equally suggests that the pursuit of no method will yield nothing. I have left for last one further way, I suppose the most blatant, in which my appeal to reality may seem false or mis- guided: it neglects the fact that the events of movies are fictional. So they cannot from the beginning be real or have happened, except perhaps by the purest or most miraculous of coincidences. My book contains next to nothing about the specific problems of cinematic narration or dramaturgy. My justification for this lack is nothing more than my sense that the problem of cinematic dramaturgy- of the ways in which its stories are comprehensibly related- can only correctly be investigated subsequent to an in- vestigation of the medium of cinema itself. That movies are fictional is not what makes them different from operas, plays, novels, some poems, some paintings, some ballets, etc. Since I assume that film's modes of dramaturgy are as specific to it as the modes of dramaturgy in the other arts of fiction, I assume that discussing the dramaturgy of a film apart from the nature and structure of the specific possibilities of film itself which are called upon in it, is equivalent, say, to discussing the dramaturgy of an opera apart from the nature and structure of its music. I equally assume that there are ways of analyzing music which will fail to show how it works in the drama. One or two of the preoccupations of my book do bear directly, however, on the concept of fiction. The idea of a type, for example,</page><page sequence="43">STANLEY CAVELL 613 is raised as a way of grasping the particular ways in which the human being is fictionalized- which is to say, molded- by film. The creation of a fictional presence (like the presence of nature) is not an achievement of the medium of film (as it is an achievement of novelists and playwrights and actors on a stage), but is given by the medium itself. (Perhaps the same could be said of the puppet or marionette theater.) Again, my speaking of the non-existence of the screened world is fairly obviously a way of characterizing part of what is meant by fictionality. It is true that I do not equate this idea of non-existence with the particular artifice of fiction, partly because I do not know what the par- ticular artifice of fiction is, and partly because my intuition is that fictionality does not describe the narrative or dramatic mode of film. There are broad hints in my book that I think the mode is more closely bound to the mythological than it is to the fictional. My formal reasons for this intuition revolve around my obsession with the particular mode of presence of the figures on the screen and the particular mode of absence from them of their audience. I speak of "a world past," and the idea of pastness threads through my book, as does the idea of presentness and of futurity. But I do not say that this is the past, that it is history. I do say that in viewing a movie I am "present ... at something that has happened" (p. 26). The context is one in which I am contrasting the audience in a theater with the audience in a movie house. Both audiences are present at fictions. When I say, in this context, that the audience in a theater is present at something happening, I do not wish to imply that the events on the stage are taking place, as it were, in real life, nor that they are inevitably set in the present. Just so, when I say that the audience in a movie house is present at something that has happened, I do not wish to imply that the events on the screen have taken place, as it were, in real life, nor that they are inevitably set in the past. I grant that the words themselves may seem at first glance to imply this, but at second glance they imply an impossibility: How can one be present at something that has happened, that is over? And this is as much a question whether the events in question are fictional or are historical; the contrast of fiction and history is irrelevant here. (One can have dreams and have hal-</page><page sequence="44">6 14 THE GEORGIA REVIEW lucinations. But it makes no apparent sense to speak of being present at dreams or at hallucinations. This suggests why it is wrong to think of movies in terms of dreams or hallucinations.) To speak of being present at something that is over is not to state a falsehood but, at best, to utter a paradox. At worst, it is an unilluminating or unnecessary paradox. Whether it is illuminat- ing or necessary depends upon whether the experience it is intended to express is really expressed by it; and whether, if it is expressed, it has the significance I attribute to it; and whether, if it does havé this significance, this significance can be expressed some better way. Its illumination or necessity also depends upon how the paradox is interpreted, specifically upon whether it accurately and memorably encodes the various concepts and descriptions I elicit from it- e.g., about our displacement from the world, about the significance of viewing and exhibition, about the significance of the absence and presence of actors and audience, etc.; and of course it depends upon whether these concepts and descriptions are in turn illuminating and necessary. When at the end of my book I say, "The actors are there ... in your world, but . . . you cannot go there nona. ... In a movie house, the barrier to the stars is time," I was counting on having earned the right to expect my reader to take these expressions symbolically, as my- thological descriptions of the state of someone in the grip of a movie. Perhaps the writing fails, or I had failed to earn the right to such an expectation, but those expressions cannot in justice be taken to mean that I think someone in the grip of a movie can literally go to the events it depicts at some time other than now. Not just common sense rules this out, but my repeated emphasis on such notions as the projected world's not existing, as the projections of the world as such (which is not the same as the representation of specific locales), as my absence from the world, as its being complete without me. These notions are meant to correct, or explain (of course, mythologically to correct or ex- plain), what is wrong and what is right in the idea of the pastness of the projected world. I relate that idea most immediately to my passiveness before the exhibition of the world, to the fascina- tion, the uncanniness, in this chance to view the manifestation of the world as a whole. In the sentence preceding the sentences I just quoted from</page><page sequence="45">STANLEY CAVELL 615 myself concerning "the barrier to the stars," I relate the movie house to the geography of Plato's Cave. The point of the relation is exactly that presenting yourself to these events cannot be a matter of walking out and literally going somewhere else. There is no time for me but the time I am in and there is no specific else- where to go. -Then why suggest that there is? -But I claim to be denying that there is. -Then why bother to so much as deny it since anyone with common sense cannot fail to deny it? -Because common sense is, and ought to be, threatened and questioned by the experience of film itself; and because the nature of our absence from the events on the screen is not the same as the nature of our absence from an historical event or from the events in a cartoon or in a novel or on the stage; and because the differing natures of our absence are internal to the differing natures of the audiences of the different arts; and because the nature of the audience of an art, its particular mode of participation and per- ception, is internal to the nature of that art. In the closing pages of my book I note a certain anxiety in the participation and perception of the audience of a film and I characterize that as an experience of my contingency. This sense of contingency may express itself mythologically as the con- tingency that I am not there- as though my absence requires an explanation. Writers about film are, I believe, responding to the sense that such an explanation is required when they speak of movies as if they were hallucinations or dreams. If they are speaking literally they are wrong. I have indicated that I think they are wrong mythologically as well, but it is not easy to say why. They are responding to the fact that I am seeing things, things not there, experiencing them as overwhelmingly present. You cannot snap me out of this mood by telling me that what I am seeing is the projection of photographs or that I am mis- using the word "seeing," because I will tell you that you do not realize what the projection of photographs is. You might as well tell me that I do not see myself in the mirror but merely see a mirror image of myself. The sense of contingency may express itself unmythologically as the sense that I am here, that it is my fate to exist and while I exist to be one place rather than any other. You may not find this to be much of a fate, or you may not credit the existence</page><page sequence="46">6l6 THE GEORGIA REVIEW of such a thing as "the sense of contingency," or you may feel either that I have misdescribed it or overemphasized its importance. Then one of us is wrong. In line with what I called these formal reasons for the intuition that the dramatic mode of film is the mythological, there are reasons having to do with the content it projects. I do not interpret this content as promising us glamor, magical resolution, and the association of stars, though I do not deny that such wishes are often excited and pandered to, not alone by movies. But movies also promise us happiness exactly not because we are rich or beautiful or perfectly expressive, but because we can tolerate individuality, separateness, and inexpressiveness. In particular, be- cause we can maintain a connection with reality despite our condemnation to viewing it in private. It is, after all, not merely a couple of unintelligible German philosophers of the early and middle part of the nineteenth century who were speaking, at the establishment of the industrial age, of the human being's estrange- ment from the world; nor, in its closing years, was a crazy European philologist speaking merely for himself (even if mostly to himself) when he announced the Death of God- by which he meant to record an altered relation in which we have placed ourselves to the world as a whole, to nature and to society and to ourselves. The myth of film is that nature survives our treat- ment of it and its loss of enchantment for us, and that community remains possible even when the authority of society is denied us. For movies are inherently anarchic. Their unappeasable appetite for stories of love is for stories in which love, to be found, must find its own community, apart from, but with luck still within, society at large; an enclave within it; stories in which society as a whole, and its laws, can no longer provide or deny love. The myth of movies tells not of the founding of society but of a human gathering without natural or divine backing; of society before its securing (as in the Western) or after its collapse (as in the musical or the thirties' comedy, in which the principals of romance are left on their own to supply the legitimacy of their love). It shares with any myth the wish for origins and comprehension which lies behind the grasp of human history and arbitration. In myth the past is called before us, reenacted, and in its presence we are rededicated. On film, the past which is present is pastness</page><page sequence="47">STANLEY CAVELL 6 1 7 or presentness itself, time itself, visually preserved in endless repetition, an eternal return, but thereby removed from the power to preserve us; in particular, powerless to bring us together. The myth of movies replaces the myth according to which obedience to law, being obedience to laws I have consented to and thus established, is obedience to the best of myself, hence constitutes my freedom- the myth of democracy. In replacing this myth, it suggests that democracy itself, the sacred image of secular politics, is unliveable. By opposite means, the myth of democracy is found unliveable (at least without prior, visionary transformation of ourselves) in the best of American literature. There we find the absence of romance, of the individual woman and man free to consent to one another; in particular, unable to imagine the bearing of a happy family. It is the land which had refused its full expression to the novel which gave rise to the first dramatic films of major artistic ambition, and to the greatest of the film comedies, which take their form as satires of authority. The anarchism of movies is already contained in the condition of viewing unseen. For the polis can be affirmed only in present speech, the members live for one another, each explicit, the city gathered within earshot of itself. I speak here within the condition of the doubt expressed earlier that we yet understand the relation, on film, of individual and society. I might say that we have yet to understand the images of society we offer ourselves. For of course we can be shown a gathering of persons- say around a leader- meant as a gathering of the city within earshot of itself. But what city would this be? Who might these individuals be for one another? What future can a collective image affirm as their common happiness? Such images will suggest that film's natural alternative to an anarchic response to social existence is a Utopian one. -Which is more important, for us to know our society to be just, at least open to justice; or for us to know that even in the absence of justice we may enact and satisfy our private need of one another? Which would you rather have, a mind or a brain? Before finishing with these additions and multiplications, I would like to modify, if not quite to retract, what I said in my</page><page sequence="48">6l8 THE GEORGIA REVIEW book about the delayed encroachment of modernism upon the art of film. Reacting against what I regarded as empty and prejudicial announcements appointing film as the major modern art, hence against certain definitions of that art, I insisted that the historical interest of film lies rather in its condition as the last traditional art, which means in part the last to find itself pushing itself to its modernist self-questioning. I was amply tentative about this, but it may well be too soon to be so much as tentative about such a question, too soon conceptually as well as too soon ar- tistically. It may be that the art itself and, more directly, the concepts in which one attempts to grasp its behavior, are too chaotic to allow of any such perspective now- except one taken upon the platform of a manifesto, which is not my business. One may share the sense of change in the art of movies over the past fifteen or twenty years, and even agree that this has something to do with the encroachment of modernist problems, but then account for this encroachment in at least two ways I have not considered: as a repetition, more or less farcical, of film's first and most serious modernist phase, expressed, say, in revolu- tionary Russia; or (non-exclusively) as the new emergence of experimental film making.* I am not now interested to adjudicate this issue but to emphasize that its adjudication is a matter essen- tially and simultaneously of the value and understanding one places on the particular objects in question and of the value and under- standing one places on the concept of modernism. I have used the term modernist, not originally, to name the work of an artist whose discoveries and declarations of his medium are to be understood as embodying his effort to maintain the continuity of his art with the past of his art, and to invite and bear comparison with the achievements of his past. The term is not meant to cover everything that may be thought of as advanced or avant-garde in art. On the contrary, it suggests to me a wish to break into (certain uses of) the concept of the avant-garde at at least three points: into its implication that advanced art looks away from the past toward the future; into its tendency toward promiscuous •I am assuming that an accommodation can be made with certain of the view» of Annette Michelson in "Film and the Radical Aspiration." This issue is broached in the introduction to Film Theory 'and Criticism, an anthology edited by Gerald Mast and Marshall Cohen (Oxford University Press, 1974).</page><page sequence="49">STANLEY CAVELL 619 attention to any and all claims to advancement, together with a tendency to cede the concept of art altogether, at any rate, to cede the idea of the arts as radically distinguished from one another, which is the sensible significance of the "pure" in art; and into the military-political image prompting its title, which suggests that an art can advance, or survive, in some way other than through its faithfulness to itself, and in particular that what prompts this advance, or promotes this survival, is a synchronized or imminent social advance. ( Arrière-garde is more like it. The modernist critic is not penetrating more territory but more time.) These may prove to be grounds on which to regard, say, Eisenstein's work as avant-garde but not as modernist. I hope it is clear that this in itself would not imply that his work is less good than any other. (And because I mean to be keeping open the relation between art and politics in a given generation, I would not like to give the impression that I take them as having no relation. One may still hope, almost above all, that the dream of the good city will not be lost, without forgetting that it is a dream, and hence just the beginnings of responsibilities.) They are also grounds on which to regard certain recent experiments in film making as inheritors, or relatives, not of modernism in the other arts, but of (what I called) their modernizings. I do not know this work well or extensively enough for my judgments of it in individual cases to be of much use. But if there is a genuine artistic movement in question, and if claims concerning the state of the arts of film are to be based upon it, then it is worth saying that the role of experimentalism in film making is as specific to it as any other of its features, so that one cannot assess its significance apart from an assessment of the significance of film as such. Two features in particular seem to beg for assess- ment. ( i ) In the arts of the novel, of music, and of painting con- temporary with the establishment of the art of film, the major ex- perimentalists have generally proven to be the major artists of their period, i.e., their "experiments" have been central to the develop- ment of the art itself, not more or less peripheral attacks upon it. One can, of course, claim that this will prove to be true of the art of film as well, that the dominant position of movies with their famous directors and stars and their mass audiences will ultimately be shown to have been an aberration of the art from</page><page sequence="50">Ó20 THE GEORGIA REVIEW almost its beginning, caused and maintained by historical, economic forces essentially external to its autonomous development. We should be able to convince ourselves of this about a century from now. (2) Film has from the beginning aroused, and through- out its history has inspired, lines of experimentation with its physical basis. This is another way of seeing the unique role played in this art by its technology. An apparently significant fact about its early experimentors is that their results provided devices for particular kinds of comedy, e.g., for animation and for burlesques of magic. What I have been saying makes out the concept of modernism to be in service of an art that is in battle not particularly against Goliaths (which is not new, and which waxes and wanes), but against false Davids. The concept is called for in specific stages of culture. Naturally its application will appear prophetic, since it will depend upon distinguishing among claimants to art those which play at liberation and those which play for it, those which are documents and symptoms of their time and those which are also valid diagnoses and statements of it. This motive for the concept bears on what I have written about movies only more or less eccentrically, mostly so far as I have felt impelled to make the Hollywood case against what I considered to be bad briefs against it (finding, if you like, Davids in Goliaths' clothing). The concept will be at home, and will then shed what is then unnecessary in its dogmatism, only within a believable critique of culture, call it a critique of historical judgment, which is able to schematize the emergence and the features of a stage of culture that calls for such a concept as modernism at all- a stage in which everything and nothing seems to matter, for example, that some say that everything new is significant and others that nothing significant is new; in which diagnosis has replaced dogma, hence institutions have no inside and culture is an unmasquerade; in which art and politics and religion forget themselves, and will covet one another's leavings; in which conscience seems bad manners, faith an indulgence, and nihilism our amusement. In the meantime, I am prepared to modify my claims about film's modernism by saying either that movies from their beginning have existed in a state of modernism, from the beginning have had to achieve their power by deliberate investigations of the</page><page sequence="51">STANLEY CAVELL ÒZI powers of their medium; or else that movies from their beginning have existed in two states, one modern, one traditional, sometimes running parallel to and at varying distances from one another, sometimes crossing, sometimes interweaving; or else that the concept of modernism has no clear application to the art of film. My feeling is that none of these modifications need weaken my insistence on film as the last traditional art, but on the contrary that each would be a way of explaining that insistence. I hold on to the critical hypothesis which runs through my book as well as through this continuation of it, that pride of place within the canon of serious films will be found occupied by those films that most clearly and most deeply discover the powers of the medium itself, those that give fullest significance to the pos- sibilities and necessities of its physical basis. Placing this sig- nificance in individual cases is an act of criticism. -Perhaps what I just called a hypothesis is more accurately thought of as a definition of, or as a direction for composing a definition of, "the powers of the medium itself." The idea, in any case, is empty apart from placing its significance in individual cases. I conclude with a sketch of such an act of criticism, somewhat more elaborated than those which have so far affected my remarks. It deals with certain of my experiences, as they have so far developed, of Rules of the Game, and directs itself toward accounting for one of its frames. The frame I have in mind figures in the last sequence of the film. Its view fronts upon the façade of the chateau in and around which the events of the film have played themselves out, and includes its terrace with its balustrade, the set of steps leading up to the terrace, and a segment of the entrance court from which the steps lead. The Marquis, at the center of the terrace and at the head of the steps, framed behind by the entrance portals to his house, is making a little speech of explanation to his guests, assembled at the bottom of the steps. He is saying something like: "There has been a deplorable accident, that's all. My keeper Schumacher thought he saw a poacher, and he fired, since that is his duty. Chance had it that André Jurieu should be the victim of this error." There follows a final isolating close- up of the Marquis as he concludes his speech and suggests to the company that they go inside to avoid catching a chill; then a</page><page sequence="52">бгг THE GEORGIA REVIEW longer shot to show a servant opening the portals behind him to receive the guests. Then a medium close-up of the homosexual and the general for the last of their typifying exchanges: "A new definition of the word 'accident.' " "No, no, no, no, no. La Chesnaye [the Marquis] has class. That is a rare thing these days." These two then quit the frame and the camera holds its position as shadows of the guests file across the façade of the chateau, leaving us with the looming balustrade, and, beneath it, a line of cypresses in their brightened tubs; upon which the film ends.* The sequence is a kind of summary epilogue, gathering together the characters as well as the themes of the production we have witnessed. If this production had merely copied rather than absorbed to its own purposes the tradition of eighteenth-century comedy which it consistently invokes, this sequence would serve to beg our pardons for any offense, celebrate the timely conversion of a miscreant ( The Marriage of Figaro) or his timely riddance ( Don Giovanni ), and permit the cast jointly to ask our blessing with our hands. Instead, the Marquis speaks alone, in confusion, to, not for the cast; they face him, their backs to us; and they file away from us, in clumps, as if their production had not been concluded but been interrupted. As if to declare: this production has from the beginning had no audience, none it has not depicted; no standing group of spectators will have known what they were watching. (Such a declaration inspires the most public in-joke of the film, in the line addressed by the Marquis to the head of his household staff: "Corneille, stop this farce!"- to which this chief servant replies soberly, as befits his name, "Which one?") I emphasize two critical features in the formal tableau of the Marquis' speech: (i) the position of Schumacher, the game- keeper, notable by his awkward posture and by his zone of isolation, halfway up the steps, between the Marquis and the Marquis' audience; (2) the absence of Octave, the part played by Renoir, notable in this moment of general assembly. Schumacher's posture is slightly hunched, turned largely from us but aware of the audience, as over his shoulder, and inflected toward the Marquis. His torsion might present a posture of con- •There is a good presentation of an English translation of the script in the Classic Film Scripts series published by Simon and Schuster.</page><page sequence="53">STANLEY CAVELL 623 trition, but his gamekeeper's shotgun is again in place, strapped across his back, as we had always seen it before the masquerade party. Here the gun happens to be pointing exactly at the Marquis' head. (I mean no more than "happens to be"; the meaning will be clear without this.) Let us recall that we already knew something about the sig- nificance of the camera's fronting upon the entrance to the chateau, in particular something about the terrace and its balustrade. The terrace had recently been established for us as a stage- when Octave, pushed by the mood of a late interview with Christine, the friend of his youth and now the Marquis' wife, enters the terrace from its side, as from the wings, to reenact the manner and moments in which his old teacher of conducting, Christine's father, used to make his entrance as head of the orchestra in Vienna and bring his performers to attention. So the Marquis, standing on that spot, is giving some further sort of performance, and his chateau has become a piece of theatrical decor, a backdrop, situating him. This merely underlines what is in any case obvious, but it impels us to ask more closely what the nature or point of this further performance is. It is one in which the Marquis is con- structing a particular form of lie (he says that his gamekeeper mistook his guest for a poacher, whereas the Marquis had earlier that night discharged his gamekeeper, and exactly on the ground that he had endangered his guests) ; but in this lie he is telling a truth (because his gamekeeper had, in shooting the aviator, shot a poacher on the Marquis' preserves and hence acted on the Marquis' behalf). Telling the truth by lying is, however, a way of defining fiction: the Marquis is not only giving a performance but composing a play or the ending of a play, or starting a further game. In tacitly accepting the gamekeeper back into his service and thereby conspiring to cover the accident, the Marquis places himself at the mercy of the gamekeeper. In explicitly accepting the gun as the lawful defense of his domain (i.e., his domain inside the house, his private life), he has submitted himself to the gun's dominion. (The little poacher had said to the Marquis during their first encounter that while the Marquis may be master inside the house, outdoors Schumacher is boss.) Schumacher had worn that shotgun strapped to his back through-</page><page sequence="54">624 THE GEORGIA REVIEW out the set-piece of the shoot, as he tracked the rabbits and birds into the guests' range of fire. After the shoot, but still within the shoot's locale, the action centers around a particular object, the small telescope or eye-piece. We are told or shown three main features of this object: it is fun, even fascinating; when you look through it, reality is suddenly revealed, or made ac- cessible, in an otherwise unavailable manner; it is deadly, it penetrates to the inner life of living creatures. Omitting further detail, I will simply assert that the eye-piece is a sort of figure of speech, or synecdoche of sight, for both a gun and a camera. (When the wife spies through it and sees her husband with his former mistress, this is already a kind of shooting accident.) Out- doors, outside, the camera is boss. It dictates what you may see and the significance of whatever you do. What the camera has killed, or breached, is the rule of theater. It uses theater, dominates it, locks it indoors. It participates in the subjugation of the Marquis, the ending of his game. For him, now, newly, all is but toys. He has become the Midas of amusement; everything he touches he winds; and he has laid hands upon himself. The camera, however, is out of his reach; it is behind his audience, witnessing them as well as his performance for them. This is part of what Octave-Renoir's absence from this con- cluding scene means. He has taken his place behind the camera. His absence declares his responsibility for what has happened; that is to say, for the act of interfering in the events of this society (he had, for the beginning, arranged for the presence of the poacher-rabbit; for the ending, he had directed and cos- tumed the events which cause the accident), in particular, for interfering by exposing it, which is what finally discomfits this comity. I was criticized in one recent discussion of these matters for, in effect, failing to see that Jurieu, the poacher-rabbit, was from the beginning fated to be expelled by this rule-intoxicated society, and that, presumably, his riddance, if extreme, all the more ex- tremely testifies to the power of the Marquis' game, which re- mains in full sway. The ground of this criticism must be the thought that Renoir's film merely condemns the Marquis' society (merely condemns, and merely this one), showing his toys of moral scruple always to have worked behind the gun of reality.</page><page sequence="55">STANLEY CAVELL 625 But this seems to me to deny the facts and the mood of the frame from which my reading has begun. One set of facts depends upon remembering who the Marquis is, I mean recollecting what his rules are. Of course he had wished all poacher-rabbits to be kept out, but there were limits to what he would do to keep them out. He would not, for example, permit fences. He had, again, fought in person for his wife, honorably; but it was also a point of honor with him to acknowledge the rights of love and of friendship and to respect his wife's wish to leave. Sincerity was as much a point of honor with him as the safety of his guests. The poacher-rabbit was expelled, if by mistake, according to the rules of Schumacher's game- not his game as the Marquis' gamekeeper but his own game of honor ("A shot in the dark, in the woods, and no questions asked," as he described his honor to his wife). It remains a question for us why the Marquis accepts, and protects, this foreign rule of honor. The answer cannot simply be that it has fulfilled his wishes. If that were all, there would have been for him no rules in the first place. He accepts Schumacher's rule because he is afraid not to, finally unable to confront him and judge him. This reflects an inability, no doubt, to confront his own guilt. But his guilt and his fear have not begun with his implication in this act of Schumacher's. We know from the first scene with the literal little poacher that the Marquis is afraid of Schumacher. There the Marquis had entered into a conspiracy with the little poacher exactly to spite Schu- macher. One result of this is that the poacher feels free, during the masquerade, to ask the Marquis to do him "a little service"- feels free because the service amounts, again, to a conspiracy against Schumacher. The Marquis thus becomes the servant of his servant. The final result is that the Marquis, as if confessing this conspiracy, enters into a conspiracy with Schumacher, and so becomes an accessory against his own authority. (The absence of the little poacher from the final tableau signifies, accordingly, that the Marquis is no longer able to protect him from Schu- macher.) I said just now that a certain criticism of my reading seemed to me to "deny the facts" of the frame I was reading. But the way I have tried to read my way into that frame shows that facts of a frame, so far as these are to confirm critical under-</page><page sequence="56">6z6 THE GEORGIA REVIEW standing, are not determinable apart from that understanding itself. It shows, further, that questions prompted by one frame are not answerable from within that frame alone. Take so plain a matter as the presence of those tubbed cypresses beneath the balustrade. Are they significant, i.e., are they "facts of a frame," so far as these facts are meant to confirm critical understanding? The concluding shot of the film undeniably emphasizes these tubs. They now gather the intensest patches of light within the frame; and they seem to be the source of the light which draws those shadows. Are we to understand in this allusion to footlights a final statement of the terrace as an abandoned stage, and a capping ambiguity about the source of illumination- a question whether it reveals as for an audience in a theater or for an audience in a movie house? A convincing answer would have to take its place among the answers to the other questions this film raises about the relations between society and theater and cinema. That Rules of the Game is interested in theater is about as obvious as that Marx is interested in money. Its adoption of the look and manner of traditional French comedy depicts the social role of theater at its extremest point, the point at which theater and society are absorbing one another, dissolving in one another. I account for its perspective upon this condition as one achieved through Renoir's declared faithfulness to the perspective of cinema. This dialectical step could be summarized as follows: When society has become fully theatricalized (conscious of its rules but inaccessible to their backing, the fool of its own artifice, of its peculiar compacts), cinema reestablishes our sense of reality by asserting its own powers of drama. -This is more or less what I say, in The World Viewed, happened historically (pp. 89- 94). I need not, I think, be told that this is very obscure. My excuse for the obscurity, I mean for voicing the idea in its obscurity, is my intention to counter, or question, the familiar claim that "cinema has changed our ways of looking at the world"- to question this, generally, by suggesting that such a claim is no less obscure than any claims of my own, merely unquestionably fashionable; and to question it, specifically, by claiming that cinema entered a world whose ways of looking at itself- its Weltanschauungen- had already changed, as if in</page><page sequence="57">STANLEY CAVELL 627 preparation for the screening and viewing of film. -Film's easy power over the world will be accounted for, one way or another, consciously or not. By my account, film's presenting of the world by absenting us from it appears as confirmation of something already true of our stage of existence. Its displacement of the world confirms, even explains, our prior estrangement from it. The "sense of reality" provided on film is the sense of that reality, one from which we already sense a distance. Otherwise the thing it provides a sense of would not, for us, count as reality. -Documentary immediacy, should it be desired, cannot, I assume, deny this condition though it may negate it through acknowledging it. This will require defining what it is that you, as this film maker, proposing this immediacy, must acknowledge- your position in it; and it will require defining the position of the audience to whom you are proposing to make it known. Godard's Two or Three Things I Know About Her is a rich exploration of the former of these requirements. (Is it needless to say that the satisfaction of such requirements will not, of itself, insure the quality of the work that contains it?) (It will not count as an acknowledgment of your being late for you to register your knowledge that there is tardiness in the world; nor will it count if you register your knowledge to the company you are leaving rather than to the company you have kept waiting. It must not be an excuse; it need not be an apology. If, however, what you wish to acknowledge is something about us, then you must define our positions accordingly, e.g., presume an acknowledgment from me of your right to speak for me. If you proceed without it, rebuking me for my ignorance or my coward- ice, then you risk, or seek, my rebuke. You may thus achieve dis- sociation from me, the company you are leaving, through a be- trayal. What cause justifies you- not in leaving, but in leaving this way? ) I mention two further issues whose settlement will, I believe, have to enter any account of Rules of the Game that I would find convincing. One concerns the significance it gives to the camera's frontality, say in the shot of the tableau at the terrace; the other concerns the significance of the danse macabre which ends the theatrical inside the chateau. (If someone wishes to say</page><page sequence="58">028 THE GEORGIA REVIEW that the former is a "formal" issue, then I would like to ask what particular contrast he has in mind.) 1. Frontality, or perpendicularity, in this film (as in Grand Illusion) is the angle of theater, both of its establishment and of its questioning. Grand Illusion twice employs a cut from full front to full back, across 180 degrees, on a centered figure. It happens first on the figure of Rosenthal (played by Dalio, who will play the Marquis, a connection openly alluded to in Rules), as he for the first time invites his companion prisoners to partake of a feast he has arranged. The gesture of this cut carries a sense of Rosenthal's pride in his providence, his wish to preside at this festival of his making; but equally, as we find ourselves at his back, a feeling of his vulnerability, his humanity, his sincere willingness to please. Such a gesture opposes any hurried contrast between theater and sincerity. The second occurrence of this front-to-back cut is on the figure of Carette (in Rules, the little poacher) , during his song in the theatrical for the other prisoners. This makes more explicit the frontal acknowledgement of theater and the camera's declaration, as it shoots from behind the scene, showing its facing audience, of its absorption and command of theater; it also establishes a connection between the figures of Dalio and Carette which is elaborated in the later film. This much seems to me relatively uncontroversial. In Rules of the Game, perpendicularity more openly defines the ascension of cinema over theater. A central piece of evidence for this is the great tracking shot of the beaters, headed by Schumacher, as the shoot begins. It is, as it were, shot from the side, from the wings, and it is as if Schumacher, characteristically a bit hunched over, with the tool of his trade strapped to his back, is not so much guiding the action as following it, tracking it, filming it. This idea interests me, beyond itself, for the role it might play in a full reading of the film. Much as I regard it as obvious, I also expect it to be resisted. Must I, as a reader, leave this point to the sheer agree- ment of others, or can it sensibly be argued? 2. If it can be argued, some terms of argument will have to emerge from the other scene of a dance of death, the one inside, for the masquerade. There the camera is at its freest and the characters spill from the stage into the audience, entangling them in the performance. There is good reason to take this as this film's</page><page sequence="59">STANLEY CAVELL 629 way of declaring its cinematic perspective: the audience (Le., the depicted audience) is kinaesthetically assaulted by this per- formance, frightened and thrilled by the Saint-Saëns skeletons and the roving points of light, frightened and alarmed by not quite knowing whether this is or is not a performance (which is the obvious surface of the plot at this point, with Schumacher entangling the audience in his private hunt for his poacher); and the scene is as pure a realization of the cinema's vaunted "patterns of light in motion" (distinctly all black and white) as a movie is likely to admit. Still, we know this dance to be a piece of theater. So the scene reads to me as a parody of a par- ticular theory of cinema. As if to say: if kinaesthetic patterns of light and motion is what you want, theater can satisfy you as well as cinema; it is as specialized a claim for cinema as it would be for theater; as either may, and neither need, explicitly show the walks of life united in the dance of death. (A parody of a par- ticular theory of theater can be heard in the late line from the Marquis to Schumacher: "Get Corneille to deal with the formalities, the telephone calls and all the rest.") The simultaneous spilling over of the stage and spilling over of the scene below-stage, both into the arena of the audience- the simultaneous break-down and break-up of both lively and deadly realms of artifice, forming a chaos of artifice- exemplifies the film's pervasive theme of "accident," and comments upon it. In a theater, the actors appear in person; it is part of the latent anxiety of theater that anything can happen to break the spell- a cue missed, a line blown, a technical hitch. The abyss between actor and audience is not bottomless, unless convention is bottom- less. In a movie house, the actors are not present in person and the screen is metaphysically unbreachable; the abyss between actor and audience is as bottomless as time. This does not mean that accidents are out of the question. One can say, as I have implied, that everything caught by film is accident, contingency. Then one must equally say that every accident on film becomes permanent (like the existence of the one world, in the midst of all possible worlds). -These are consequences of the ontological fact that two screenings of the same film bear a relation to one another absolutely different from the relation borne to one</page><page sequence="60">630 THE GEORGIA REVIEW another by two performances of the same play, I mean two per- formances of the same production of a play. This is the same fact as that a screening of a film is not a performance of it. -There is no essence of the difference between stage and screen. They are essentially different, as like one another, and syste- matically unlike, as tragedy and comedy, or as two stages of society. It can seem an accident of culture (while perhaps a necessity of the art of theater, certain theater) that a theater director relinquishes his influence upon a production; whereas it seems a matter of physical law that the movie director call his work finished and step absolutely aside. One could imagine it otherwise. A theater director might invite audiences only to "rehearsals"; a movie director may insist upon showing only "rushes." Such practices might be guided by particular conceptions each has of his art; and they might serve in the achievement of new forms of success within the works of these respective arts. In Rules of the Game , the movie director's absolute absence from his work (accented if, per accidens, he appears in it) is fictionalized as Octave's departure from its scene of accident. Following his re- enactment of his old teacher, he had told Christine of his longing to have had a public as a "conductor." As a movie director, absence from the public view is accounted for. So Octave's de- parture can declare Renoir's success as a director of movies. Is it also Renoir's confession that he knows himself to be a public failure as a director of movies? Evidently there is a wave of self- pity here. But as usual in the history of comedy, the clown's self-pity functions within the highest ambitions and achievements of his art: it is the natural tendency of his pity for the world, and his pitilessness towards it, refusing his own exemption from it; it expresses his knowledge of the cost in its falling just to him to embody his displacement from society as society's disfigure- ment of itself. Specifically, here, self-pity is an acknowledgment of the writer's hectic sense, at least since the eighteenth century, of the burden of his art, not knowing whether it is the root or the height of his displacement, nor whether it signifies his greater purity or impurity, measured against the state of his public. Renoir identifies himself through Octave as both cause and casualty</page><page sequence="61">STANLEY CAVELL 63 1 of the accident, and therewith identifies himself through Jurieu- the artist as poacher and poached, groundling flyer, a soloist. -The loss of a public is in fact the artist's withdrawal from his public, as a consequence of his faithfulness to his art. The public is lost to art because they are readying themselves for war, for life by the gun. They are also lost because of art, because art maintains itself against their assaults, and because, almost against its will, it unsettles the illusions by means of which civilized people conduct themselves. It is in this loving brutality that Renoir declares film's possession of the power of art.</page></plain_text>
