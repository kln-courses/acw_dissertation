BALOSSI Restelli Abstract: Cooking methods and practises are crucial in defining group identity , in expressing social and kin networks, and in reflecting domestic economies. In this paper I discuss fire installations and fire related utensils from afunctional and typological point of view, throughout the prehistoric and early historic phases of occupation at the East Anatolian site of Ar slantepe, over a period of nearly 2500 years (4200-1750 BCE). Arslantepe, through this long sequence, testifies to the development of hierarchical societies , the origin of primary state and its collapse, groups of semi-mobile pastoral communities and then small towns of farmers. Through the distribution of cooking facilities, their attributes and peculiarities, domestic economies and social relations linked to food preparation and consumption are investigated at the site. Résumé: Les méthodes de cuisson et les pratiques culinaires sont essentielles pour définir Videntité d'un groupe. Elles permettent d'identifier des réseaux parentaux ou sociaux, tout en reflétant une économie familiale. Dans cet article, je présente, d'un point de vue typologique et fonctionnel, les installations associées au feu et les ustensiles utilisés sur le site dArslantepe, en Anatolie orientale, sur une période de près de 2500 ans (4200-1750 av. notre ère). Arslantepe témoigne, par cette longue séquence, du développement des sociétés hiérarchisées, de l'origine de l'État et de son effondrement, de l'arrivée de communautés pastorales semi-mobiles puis de l'existence de petits villages agricoles. Les économies familiales et les relations sociales liées à la préparation et à la consommation des aliments sont ici étudiées à travers le prisme de la répartition spatiale des équipements culinaires et leurs différentes caractéris- tiques techniques.

In traditional dwellings, the hearth covers a central posi- tion, at times also physically, in the life of the household. It is where food is prepared, where the family can find relief from cold and darkness, the place around which men and women can sit and talk, organise, discuss. The hearth embraces a series of events, from daily routinized activities to the most intimate moments of a family, from ritualised ceremonial food and drink preparations to the welcome of guests. In our mod- ern languages moreover, 'hearth' is also a synonym of 'home'. Everyday routine food preparation can in its own right be considered a ritual activity, with its own symbolic qualities (Allison 1999) and without being necessarily a cultic/religious act; it has in fact been amply demonstrated that household rou- tine and 'ritual' are never separate phenomena and in fact both act in the construction of 'family' identity (Fiese 2006). Meals in particular have been pointed out as important moments of daily (thus routine) ritual (Douglas 1972; Marshall 2005; Visser 1993).

Balossi Restelli In Eastern Anatolia the only portable and non-portable hearths rich in symbolic attributes (Diamant and Rutter 1969; Kelly-Buccellati 2004), 1 as anthropomorphic, taurine or phallic figurative representations, are those of Early Bronze Age Transcaucasian tradition. Some scholars believe that such hearths also acted as cult objects, possibly linked to the underworld - dead or ancestors - and that such a tradition is particularly typical in nomadic groups (Takaoglu 2000; Smogorzewska 2004). Apart from the above example, the symbolic imagery of East Anatolian hearths does not appear to be so rich and, whilst hearths are certainly an important element of the house, they do not appear to have acted as cult objects. In the present article I shall analyse hearth and oven typo- logies in context, at the site of Arslantepe, with the intent of understanding if and how these installations vehicle shared identity, an identity that is constructed through everyday prac- tises, amongst which food preparation (Tite 1999). Households, or 'domestic arenas', as K. Hanson (2004) calls them, are culturally loaded concepts and historically specific constructs, characterized by co-residence, spatial enclosure, and common property; they are smaller socio- economic units of the wider community (Blanton 1994; Cahill 1991; Pader 1993; Tsakirgis 1996), not necessarily coincident with family boundaries (Foster and Parker 2012). They are social entities that share certain daily activities, even though not necessarily residing within the same house. Relations between individuals within a household can be very diverse, reason for which their identification is not only complicated in archaeological contexts but in ethnographic ones too. Within a household, immediate families generally share daily meals, thus an aid in identifying specific conjugal ties can come from the identification of the 'eating group', the group of people catered for by a single meal. We know from African communities such as the Akan that the cook- ing hearth also identifies the 'eating group': the term bokyea indicates in fact both the cooking hearth (the locus of food preparation) and the eating group (Hanson 2004). On the basis of this we could suggest that the position and number of hearths within an archaeological context might contribute to the identification of eating groups and consequently of house- holds. One should be careful though, as a house might have various hearths, in different rooms, used for heating and/or for cooking. This is a further point that I shall tackle in the 1.

Turkish terminology, amongst other languages, distin- guishes between fire installations, according to their function: ocak (hearth), tandir (bread oven), firm (oven). Their loca- tion is also different, with tandirs invariably outdoors and often on the street, ocaks in the kitchens and in courtyards, and ovens variably found both indoors and outdoors. In this article I shall use technological choices, dimensions and spe- cific position of the fire installations, together with other clues of food preparation technologies (cooking modes) and ingre- dients (faunai and botanical data) to analyse functional differ- ences between fire installations. Firms and tandirs , differently from hearths, are uniquely linked to cooking activities, reason for which their distribution is not so ubiquitous in Anatolian sites (Parker 2011). This might suggest that the distribution of ovens, next to that of hearths, could be a diagnostic indicator of eating groups, and thus of parental or social relations within the community. Ovens, bread ovens, fixed and portable hearths prob- ably have different functions and are thus complementary to each other in the preparation of all the kinds of foods con- sumed by a household and by the entire community. Their varied distribution may suggest fluidity between private, and communal spaces and activities that needs to be addressed. In the present study I shall attempt to investigate private vs. public food-related lives and activities on the basis of the different distribution of the varying fire installations, within houses, in open-air communal or private spaces. Daily food preparation is generally viewed as a predominantly domestic activity (and often female), thus in the sphere of private life. Studies however have demonstrated that domestic and public are not strongly opposing concepts, but instead there is a dynamic interaction between these two spheres. As J. Hendon (1996: 47) has stated, "household relations and actions are not isolated from soci- ety". In the specific case of food preparation, furthermore, the boundary between private and public is particularly fluid due to the possible presence of public commensals at the domestic meals. Keeping this in mind I shall discuss social units of food preparation and consumption. Paléorient, vol. 41.1, p. 127-151 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2015</page><page sequence="3">Hearth and home. Interpreting fire installations at Arslantepe, Eastern Turkey, from the fourth to the beginning of the second millennium BCE 129 THE CONTEXT OF THE STUDY Fig. 1 - Position of the site of Arslantepe and of the sites and regions mentioned in the text. 1) Pulur; 2) Han Ibrahim $ah; 3) Tepecik, Korucutepe, Norçuntepe, Taçkun kale ; 4) Yeniköy; 5) Sos Höyiik. The site of Arslantepe is a 30 m high tepe (mound), 4.5 ha in size and has been the most important site of the Malatya Plain (fig. 1) for many millennia (Frangipane 1996 and 2004). The site has a long occupation, starting at least with the Halaf period (6th millennium BCE) and continuing uninterruptedly until 712 BCE, when Sargon II of Assyria destroyed the Neo- Hittite town. Later, Roman and Byzantine (a necropolis) occu- pation is also known on the site (Palmieri 1973; Puglisi and Meriggi 1964; Schneider Equini 1970). The earliest excavated levels are dated to the beginning of the Late Chalcolithic and are characterised by domestic architecture (Balossi Restelli 2012a). The following periods, Arslantepe VII and VI A (Late Chalcolithic 3-5), have monu- mental architecture testifying to the development of complex centralised societies and primary state (Frangipane 2012a). Elite residences, a large temple and domestic quarters char- acterise the first of the two periods, whilst period VI A has revealed the most ancient public complex, place of political and economic power, at the back of which were elite build- ings (Frangipane 2010). Its excellent state of preservation, the more than fifty years of excavation and conservation, and the astonishing finds from this structure make it a unique case and source of knowledge on early state formation (Frangipane 1997 and 2009). Both periods VII and VI A have a primary economy prin- cipally oriented towards agriculture (wheat and barley were the main crops) and sheep and goat herding, with a minor role of cattle and pig and a small, but present, hunting activity (Bartosiewicz 2010). After the collapse of this first centralised system, life at Arslantepe (VI B1 period, 3000-2900 BCE) shows radical changes with interesting developments, and alternating occu- pation by agriculturalists and pastoral nomads with strong Transcaucasian connections (Palumbi 2012). Settlement pat- tern in the Malatya Plain indicates great mobility, with an increase in small and short-lived sites (Di Nocera 2008). Villages have wattle and daub huts, but also mud-brick struc- tures and clear traces of social differentiation, with the pos- sible presence of chiefs (Frangipane 2012b; Palumbi 2008 and 2011). No direct control of the economy by the elites is manifested and symbols of power appear to have changed, with a strong emphasis on metals and war imagery, not known before (Frangipane 2001; Helwing 2012). Pottery is strongly influenced by Transcaucasian tradition and metal objects are identical to those of the north-eastern regions. Slowly, a mixed agricultural and pastoral community occupies the site (VI B2, 2900-2750 BCE), and a small village rises along the slopes of the mound, at the edges of a central fortified area, the function of which is still not well known (Frangipane 2012b). Pottery of VI B2 period is mainly Plain Simple Ware of the Upper and Middle Euphrates region, even though the red-black tradition typical of VI B1 is also present (Piccione 2009). The village was destroyed by a violent fire, which contributed to preserve it outstandingly. All these periods are characterised by distinct material cul- ture and architectural features, even though elements of conti- nuity can be followed throughout. After period VI B2 the site is possibly abandoned for a short period of time and when it is reoccupied, in periods VI C and VI D (2750-2000 BCE), Arslantepe is a small village of initially rather mobile communities, which become more and more sedentary through time. At the end of the 3rd mil- lennium, the village of a few extended families of sedentary agriculturalists was gradually transformed into a small town (Frangipane 2012b). The village is for the first time entirely fortified, suggesting, as indicated also by other elements (Di Nocera 2008), a certain degree of conflict within the region, where Arslantepe was no longer the only centre. Period VI D at Arslantepe is a very long one with many phases of rebuild- ing and change, but a substantially constant material culture, partly in continuation with that of VI C. Continuity in material culture is recorded also with the following Middle Bronze Age Paléorient, vol. 41.1, p. 127-151 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2015</page><page sequence="4">130 F. BĀLOŠS! RESTELLI (period V A, 2000-1750 BCE), that unfortunately has only a few domestic structures preserved at the site. Within these more than two millennia of life, the major breakpoints in the life of Arslantepe are at the end of the first state system (VI A, end of 4th millennium BCE) and after VI B2, when metallurgical production (Palmieri et al. 1999), settlement organisation, architecture and pottery production - and, as I will point out in the present article, cooking installa- tions - change drastically (Frangipane 2012b). THE DEFINITION AND IDENTIFICATION OF FIRE INSTALLATIONS Attributes of fire installations at Arslantepe reflect the long and complex events and changes in the life of this site, its external relations and social organisation. Both hearths and ovens are present in all excavated periods at Arslantepe. In all periods there are also burnt patches on the ground, often outdoors, that we have interpreted as fireplaces. In this last case, there is never a preparation of the floor sur- face and I believe that these were extemporary fires. The main difference between a hearth and an oven is in the fact that the hearth is an open structure, where food is put to cook above the fire (or used for heating); the oven instead has a chamber, with one or more openings. Food is cooked inside the chamber and the fire can be put to the side, below or can be removed at the time of baking. Functionally, the difference between hearths and ovens is linked to the way foods are cooked. Hearths were used to cook food held in pots, thus stew, soup, vegetables, gruel, and pos- sibly meat was also barbecued with spits over the fire. With the aid of a griddle, bread-like or 'grilled' foods too could be prepared over a hearth.2 Ovens were instead probably used to bake or roast foods like meat, bread and cakes. Hearths were of course also used for heating. Cooking pots have been found squashed on quite a number of hearths, confirming their use on the open fire. In ovens instead, large pots sherds have at times been found, but only in one domed oven was an entire pot. We could thus imagine that large sherds might have been re-used as oven trays, whilst more proof is needed to affirm the use of cooking pots inside the ovens.3 2.

Data for a comparison of mouth opening with pot dimensions, for example. HEARTHS Nine types of hearths are found at Arslantepe during the more than two millennia from period VIII to VA (table 1 ; figs. 2-5). Type 1 is the irregular burnt patch on the ground. Type 2 (round plastered installation) hearths have roundish mud plas- tered surfaces, approximately 60 cm in diameter, at floor level (table 1), but the hearth floor can also be 2 cm high above the ground (fig. 2: 2). Type 3 (navel round) has a round mud surface with an outer ridge and a central cup shaped depression (figs. 2: 6; 5: 4-5). The plastered fire surface can be at floor level or slightly sunken into the floor. The central small cup shaped depression is com- monly interpreted as the ember holder (Sagona and Sagona 2000: 63). At times a small bowl has been found inside this depression (fig. 2:5). The size of this depression is so small (ca 10-20 cm) and shallow (ca 3-6 cm) that I believe ash would fill it very quickly. We might also hypothesise that cooking pots were placed in it. Alternatively, or together with this, I here suggest that the central bowl and depression could have represented the 'primary' hearth: in this bowl an ember of the original fam- ily fire was transported to its new location and the new hearth and home built around it. This particular type of hearth is found throughout the Upper Euphrates Region, at sites like Korucutepe and Norçuntepe from the Late Chalcolithic levels (Hauptmann 1976: Plate 39-40; Van Loon 1978), and also to the north, in the Southern Caucasus; its wide diffusion suggests possible contacts between these regions at least since the Late Chalcolithic. These hearths will have an even greater distribution at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age, coming to include the south-western 'Amuq region too (Braidwood and Braidwood 1960: 347). In Transcaucasia, instead, at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age these will be replaced by the cloverleaf shaped hearths (Palumbi 2008: 203). The diameter of type 3 hearths varies from 50 to 80 cm, with one case in which the fireplace is more than 120 cm large and another of 158 cm. The central depression has a diam- eter from 10 to 22 cm and a depth of less than 8 cm (table 1). This variability does not appear to be linked with the dimension of the room the hearth is in, with the exception of the two biggest hearths (fig. 5: 2)4 that are indeed in the largest rooms.5 A1000 is the central room of a large imposing building possibly linked with a chiefly presence or a special communal function.6 4.

Oven types: 1) domed, round; 2) on platform, two levels; 3) small oven with a convex roof to the fire chamber interpreted as a parching surface. Rooms A1 1 50 and A592 have many phases of rebuilding to each of which belong different ovens and hearths. * This oven was built in a twin set with a hearth (indicated with * in Table 1 ). Hearths of type 4 (shouldered hearth) are instead completely different: these are oval in shape with a 2-3 cm high plastered platform and a cobble or sherd floor preparation. This prep- aration was not visible, but covered by a mud floor surface; such a preparation can be explained by the thermal resistance of stones and sherds and by their capacity of accumulating and retaining heat. The central depression on the floor surface dis- appears and there is instead a built horseshoe-shaped shoul- der, which occupies, in general, less than half of the perimeter of the hearth's surface (fig. 4). Sometimes, hearths show two or three phases of rebuilding; when this happens, the fixed shoulder, rebuilt every time, becomes smaller at each succes- sive phase, being positioned within the enclosed space of the preceding one (fig. 4: 4-5, 7). Many contemporary sites in the Elazig-Altinova region, as Norçuntepe, Korucutepe, Tepecik, Han Ibrahim §ah, and Taękun Kale, have this same kind of hearths.7 Hearths with two or three shoulders built one inside the other, on the same hearth floor, have been found at some of these sites - e.g., Korucutepe and Norçuntepe - ;8 Arslantepe has none of these. The presence of the shoulder probably also affects the way the fire is controlled and its position on the hearth: the built semi-circular back in fact acts as containment for the fire, and thus the fire could be pushed right to the back of the hearth. In this way the front part of the hearth floor was relatively free and could be used as working area for the maintenance of the fire or for the handling of pots. In the round flat hearths of the previous period instead, the absence of any restriction wall suggests the fire was kept at the centre of the hearth, leaving little space for the handling of pots or fire. This difference probably explains in functional terms the larger size of these hearths in comparison with those of type 3. Type 4 hearths in general measure ca 100 x 90 cm, with the small- est being 60 x 84 cm and the largest 156 x 188 cm (table 1). Furthermore, as will be seen, these are rarely at the centre of a room. Hearth type 5 (double shouldered hearth) is represented only by a single example dated to the very badly preserved Middle Bronze Age period (VA). A single room - even though particularly large in size - with a hearth is well preserved in this period (Di Nocera 1998: 37). This hearth has the back wall (shoulder) and the hearth surface slightly elevated from the ground, as hearth type 4, but the back has a double horse- shoe shape, probably used to cook with two pots contemporar- ily (fig. 4: 6). Its very large size and its central position within the room might suggest a monumental and thus particular character of this hearth and room. The last two types of circular hearths are similar, but I have chosen to distinguish them because of their different combi- nations with other fire installations. Hearth type 6 is always found in combination with oven type 2. In fact it shares with the oven the sherd floor preparation (fig. 6: 1-2). This hearth 7.

Balossi Restelli The last kind of circular hearth (type 7) (horse-shoe shaped) is like type 6, but it is not built against the oven, rather it is found abut to one of the room side walls. This type too has no cobble or sherd preparation under the surface, nor is the surface plastered. As for the previous this hearth has the horse-shoe shaped shoulder occupying approximately 75% of the hearth circumference (fig. 2: 1). Its height is of ca 40-50 cm above the hearth floor. Cooking pots were positioned on this shoulder, as demonstrated by a comparison between maximum diameters of pots and that of these shoulders (Balossi Restelli and Guarino 2010). Interestingly, hearth type 6 is only found in combination with oven type 2 (see below), whilst hearth type 7 only with oven type 1. Two kinds of rectangular shaped hearths are found at Arslantepe. Type 8 hearth is a rectangular mud plastered basin sunken a few centimetres into the floor, with the same central cup-shaped depression typical of thé round navel hearths of type 3 (fig. 3: 2-3; table 1). On two sides of the fireplace are two mud pillars. Two hearths of this kind have been found, but one is very badly preserved. The well preserved one is 120 x 200 cm. The finding of both hearths in a temple structure sug- gests its special character. Another special kind of hearth is type 9, a rectangular platform raised from the floor, this too found in two exemplars, one in a period VI A elite residence, measuring 85 x 66 cm and the other, in the period VII temple, measuring 450 x 250 cm. The small one is built in mud bricks, whilst the large platform of temple VII is in mud. Traces of fire are visible on the top. OVENS Only three types of ovens are present (table 2; figs. 2 and 6). No fire pits have been found at Arslantepe (Thorns 2008), and tandirs , the typical modern bread ovens of the Near East (Parker 2007; Smogorzewska 2012), have not been found in any of the 4th and 3rd millennia BCE phases of occupa- tion. There is a wealth of literature on the structure and use of tandirs9 (Salonen 1964; Crawford 1981; Mulder-Heymans 2002; Martz 2010; Parker 2011). The main unequivocal dis- tinction between the archaeological remains of a tandir and a generic Arslantepe oven is the presence of a stone slab/cobble/ sherd preparation of the baking floor in all Arslantepe ovens. This is never present in the tandirs since there is no need to increase duration of the heat and temperature at the base of these bread ovens, as baking bread is stuck to the sides of the 9. Tannurs in Arabic. tandir and not sat on its base. The ovens thus were most clearly used in a different way than tandirs. Theoretically the walls of tandirs and ovens are also different, as the structure of the tandir is made of thin walled unbaked clay,10 whilst ovens had thicker mud or brick built walls. Type 1 oven is a domed oven built in mud bricks (Martz 2010). Oven diameter generally ranges between 120 and 220 cm and the mouth opening is of approximately 60 cm.11 The latter is used for inserting both fuel and food. Mud plaster is both outside and inside the oven surface and walls. This kind of oven is extremely common and can be found throughout large areas of the Near East since the Pottery Neolithic period. The second type of oven found (type 2) is built in mud, semi-circular or irregularly square in shape, with the internal cooking surface built approximately 10 cm above the room floor (table 2), whilst on the side - apparently always the right one - there is a lower small channel where ashes and fuel were probably kept whilst food was being baked (fig. 6). It is possible that fuel was initially put in the higher part of the oven to heat it well and that the embers were then moved to the side when the oven was ready for the food to be put to bake. Outside the oven, in front of it, there is another small sunken area to collect the ashes and clean the oven; this area is in direct communi- cation with the small lower internal channel (fig. 6: 3). The cooking surface, built higher up, is approximately 60 to 80 cm in width. Oven dimensions interestingly do not increase with this change, rather it is the opposite; these ovens are in general smaller than the round domed ones of type 1. This might be explained by the changed system for inserting and stocking fuel in the oven. Fuel of the type 2 ovens is in practice in a sep- arate chamber - to the side and at a lower level - from that of food, and could be stacked without touching or burning it, thus permitting a smaller size of the oven chamber. The small size of the oven, on the other hand, would have allowed saving fuel. One of these ovens had part of the roof structure still standing (fig. 6: 3). Unfortunately it is only the backside and we thus have to refer to ovens from other contemporary sites to under- stand how the mouth opening of the oven could have looked like. Two well-preserved ovens from Norçuntepe (Hauptmann 1979: Pl. 21, 3 and 22, 1) and from Yeniköy (Koçay 1976: Pl. 105-106, 118) show us the upper part of the structure. The Norçuntepe oven has two distinct openings in the front (but the internal chamber is a single one), one for the fuel/ashes and the other for the food. The Yeniköy oven, functioning in the same way, had a single opening, the width of which occupied 10. Its appearance is like that of unbaked pottery. 11. A few exceptions will be indicated below.

Interpreting fire installations at Arslantepe, Eastern Turkey, from the fourth to the beginning of the second millennium BCE 139 the entire front face of the oven. Other sites that show similar ovens are again those of the Elazig region, such as Korucutepe (Van Loon 1978) and Norçuntepe (Hauptmann 1976: Pl. 31). As mentioned above, most type 2 ovens have the hearth type 6 built abut to the oven (fig. 6: 1-2). 12 A similar case is known from Tepecik (Esin 1976: PI. 83) and one from Pulur (Koçay 1971: PI. 78). Finally, a last fire installation is found in a single exemplar at Arslantepe, which is not properly an oven as I have defined them above. This is a parching oven, smaller than the domed ovens, with a flattish-concave roofed chamber. The fire is inside the chamber, fed from the front, whilst grain or other foodstuffs were possibly put on the flattish upper surface to parch (fig. 2: 1). This installation has been named oven type 3. As there are no tandirs at Arslantepe we suppose that bread was baked in the domed ovens and possibly also with a griddle over the hearth (but in which material was the griddle made?). This might have interesting implications on the type of bread baked, since tandirs can only be used for unleavened breads whilst ovens could be used for leavened breads too. Work is in progress at Arslantepe on this matter.13 STRATIGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF HEARTHS AND OVENS In all periods we find burnt patches on the ground that indicate extemporary fires (hearth type 1). Apart from those, period VIII has the greatest variety of fire installations and features: there are at least two kinds of hearths (hearth types 2 and 7) and two kinds of ovens (oven types 1 and 3), all found within closed rooms (figs. 2: 1-2; 5: 1). These have been exten- sively described elsewhere (Balossi Restelli 2012b). In period VII the navel round hearths (hearth type 3) appear. Ovens are domed (oven type 1), as in period VIII, but they appear to be slightly smaller, ca 150 cm in diameter (fig. 2: 3). No ovens have been found so far in period VI A, but hearths are in all identical to those of period VII (fig. 2: 4). A confirmation of the fact that the dimension of the hearth does not vary with that of the room is the presence of a hearth with a diameter of 77 cm in a room of only 6.6 m2. The dimension 12. In several cases the hearth is not preserved but its existence can be hypothesised on the basis of the outer smoothing of the oven's walls on the side that should have hosted the hearth. 13. Balossi Restelli and Mori, see above note 2. of the hearth thus is rather a 'fixed' one, for which there must have been a general understanding and style. None of these hearths have been found in the public VI A complex. Burnt surfaces, at times slightly depressed, have been interpreted as possible fire installations in this building. The areas in which they have been found though, have no other features that might suggest their use as kitchens or places for food preparation and they might thus have been used for heat- ing; proper cooking areas of the complex are probably still to be brought to light. Period VI A has special fireplaces too, found in the tem- ples and in special rooms. These are the rectangular shaped hearths (basin and platform), types 8 and 9. Type 8 is in the central room of Temple B and possibly also in Temple A. The centre of the main room of Temple A is ruined by a pit, but next to this depression is a pillar as those of the temple B fire- place; the area is particularly burnt, suggesting the presence of a similar kind of fireplace, destroyed by the pit (fig. 3: 1). The earlier Temple C too, in period VII, had clear traces of a fireplace; in that case however, the fire was lit on a platform (hearth type 9), the upper surface of which was recoated with mud several times, bringing the platform to reach a height of approximately 50 cm above the floor in its latest phase of use (fig. 3: 4-5). In its first phase, the fireplace was a rectangular plastered area approximately at floor level, delimited by a mud ridge. The same type of fireplace comes from A747, a room of period VI A within an elite residence interpreted as a place for ritual activity (Frangipane 1994). This was a platform too, but smaller in dimensions (fig. 3: 6). The morphological dif- ferences of these rectangular fireplaces (hearths 8 and 9) in comparison to the round hearths are most evidently linked to their distinct role, use and symbolism.14 Periods VI B1 and VI B2 do not appear to show major changes in domestic fire installations with what is seen in VII and VI A. Hearths are the navel round type 3 ones. The diam- eter of the hearths in period VI B1 appears to be slightly wider, with many cases reaching 90 cm and sometimes also one metre or more, but overall, variability is the same as before. The same can be said for VI B2. Ovens are domed in both periods, as those of period VII, with the internal surface at floor level, and built in mud bricks. Their diameters vary from 1.20 m to 2 m (table 2). In period VI B1 though, there is one oven with a diameter of 3 m, which was probably shared by the community, since isolated in an open space (Palumbi 2012). G. Palumbi has pointed out how this continuity in the shapes of hearths and ovens, together with other local traits in the period 14. Round hearths in domestic contexts, rectangular ones in cult areas.

RESTELLI VI B1 material culture and the absence, instead, of the typi- cal Transcaucasian cloverleaf-shaped hearths, suggests there was no direct occupation of the site by foreign Transcaucasian groups, as previously hypothesised (Palumbi 2008: 234-235); rather, their were intense relations with non local pastoral groups who were probably moving around these territories and with whom the Arslantepe community did share tradi- tions. At the more north-eastern site of Sos Höyük too, in this period, even though there is clear increasing influence from the Southern Caucasian world, features of the previous period, as hearths, are retained (Palumbi 2008). In the neighbouring Elazig-Altinova instead, Transcaucasian influenced cloverleaf- shaped hearths are found rather early in the Bronze Age. With periods VI C and VI D, both hearths and ovens change drastically at Arslantepe. Hearths are always of the shouldered type 4 and ovens are of type 2. This dramatic change is one of the elements, as will be pointed out below, that testifies important transformations at the site with this period (2600 BCE). The following Arslantepe Middle Bronze Age (VA) has yielded no ovens and a single hearth (of type 5). ANDIRONS Next to these fire installations, and at times in correla- tion with these, there are some portable clay objects, in lit- erature variously called andirons, props, pot-supporters or spit-supporters (Diamant and Rutter 1969; Smogorzewska 2004 and 2012). In this article, I call andirons all movable clay objects used within a fire to support pots or spits, whilst I call portable hearths those bigger clay structures that imi- tate the shape of fixed hearth shoulders. Identifying andirons is not always so straightforward, since the shape of some of these suggests various uses, that might not always be linked to fire; some rectangular clay blocks with lateral grooves or others that are pierced might have been used as door weights (weight systems for keeping doors closed or for holding cur- tains). Recently it has also been suggested that pierced clay blocks might have been linked to metal melting: these could be positioned inside a fire and their holes be used for holding and protecting the tips of blowpipes (Tonussi 2014). At Arslantepe, recognising andirons is mostly straightforward, thanks espe- cially to their context of retrieval, except during period VI A, when no andiron-like objects are found next to the fireplaces and the shape does not help interpretation: some quadrangu- lar shaped objects recall various possible functions not only linked to spit holders (this issue shall be discussed below). The shape of andirons at Arslantepe is highly standardised within each period, and thus, as can be seen in Figure 7, highly diagnostic chronologically. The standardisation in shape sug- gests that andirons were strong identity markers, certainly charged with shared meanings. Changes in the style of and- irons are timed like those of pottery (at every change of occu- pation phase) and not like those of hearths and ovens (only once in two millennia). In period VIII, three andirons have been found, two of which in contexts with fire installations and the other out of context. They have the shape of a cone, with a curved top and two deep elongated depressions for fingers, used to hold and move the andiron in and out of the fire (fig. 7: 1). They were probably used in groups of three in order to hold the pot (Balossi Restelli 2012b). Period VII andirons instead have a double horn shape, which is the most typical andiron shape throughout Anatolia (fig. 7: 2-4). Often, on the backside were two long vertical depressions, these too possibly used for moving these objects. They were used in pairs, as suggested by the context in which they were found: in most cases, period VII andirons were found in situ , in pairs, on the hearths. Andirons from period VI A are the most difficult to inter- pret, since specific attributes and their find context suggest for some of them a possible different function. In the residential area, rooms with hearths never have andirons (D'Anna and Guarino 2012). Eight quadrangular objects, six of which.per- forated, one with a central finger impression (beginning of per- foration?) and the other with no perforation at all are the VI A objects that might recall andirons (fig. 7: 5-6). Typologically they are all similar to each other and distinct from those of periods VII and VIII. All but one have been found in the public complex: three in the lateral room of Temple A (Palmieri 1973: Fig. 75. 7-8, 10), one in Temple B, three in one of the storage rooms and the last one in the small ritual room of a private residence (A747). None have been found in or near a fireplace and only four were in rooms where fireplaces were present. The finding, in one case, of two and, in another, of three of these objects near to each other, would suggest their use in combination. The perforation, useful for moving them around with the aid of a stick or metal rod, or for holding spits, could have also been used for tying a rope to them. This, together with the position of two of them near a passageway and the presence of a groove all around the width of another, would make me incline for the use of at least these as curtain or door weights (Palmieri 1973: Fig. 75, 7). Their use in metallurgi- cal activities (Tonussi 2014) is instead ruled out by the context in which they were found. At the moment, thus these VI A Paléorient, vol. 41.1, p. 127-151 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2015</page><page sequence="15">Hearth and home.

D'Anna has pointed out that black soot deposits are generally not found on the very bottom of cooking pots in period VI A, suggesting that pots were positioned well within the fire (D'Anna and Jauss 2015). This might explain the absence of andirons or their small number. In the following period VI B1 only two andiron fragments have been discovered. Both are highly fragmented, but one, found amongst trash in a pit (fig. 7: 8), shows an undeniable similarity with those from Transcaucasian influenced sites (Palumbi 2008: Figs. 2.1: 5 and 2.2: 8). During the VI B2 period, andirons, rare, change again shape; they are rectangular blocks with four horns (fig. 7: 7) and pierced in the centre. Unfortunately, none have the four horns intact and it is thus impossible to test the hypothesis that one was sufficient to hold a pot. The site of Han Ibrahim §ah has a possibly similar andiron, but in that case too horns are broken (Ertem 1974: PL 58, 3). By comparison with period VII, in which nearly every hearth has two andirons, throughout the whole VI B2 village, extended over more than 2000 m2, only two andirons have been found. As in period VI A, here too external soot deposit does not appear on the very bottom of cooking pots (Piccione 2010), suggesting that pots could have been placed directly inside the fire. In period VI C there are no andirons. Their absence is possi- bly linked to the change in the hearths of this period; the horse- shoe-shaped structure at the back of the hearth (hearth type 4) was probably now also used to hold the pots, reducing the need of andirons in everyday cooking. There is however a single mobile hearth (fig. 7: 9): unlike the previous andirons, this is one single large portable hearth structure. Rather meaningfully, it was found in the area of a semi-subterranean round structure, probably used by semi-mobile groups. Portable hearths like these are known from the Elazig region (Koçay 1976: PL 115). In period VI D too, when hearths are the same as in VI C, a single portable hearth was found, out of context (fig. 7: 12), similar to others found in the Elazig region (Esin 1972: PL 109). In this period though, fragments of clay objects that were probably used to hold small pots over the fire have been found in period VI D. These are burnished, fine in paste tex- ture, often decorated with geometric lines in relief, and par- ticularly small in size. Their shape could vaguely resemble stylised feet (fig. 7: 10-11). These burnished andiron fragments possibly held small and fine pots, certainly not the cooking pots of this period (Persiani 2008); the latter sat in the hearth, leaning on, or sitting on, the mud built shoulder. The small andirons might have been used for heating and manipulating small quantities of drinks, foods, or incense, and their fineness and burnished surface suggests this might have occurred in special occasions. Next to these objects, period VI D also has fine textured and burnished pots with a built-in fire stand: pot- stoves (fig. 7: 13). These are found in many contemporary sites of Eastern Anatolia. Period VI D documents a variety of solutions for holding pots over a fire. What difference was there between pot-stoves, the small andirons and the classical cooking pots used over the built-in or portable hearths? Their variability in dimensions, texture and surface treatment might suggest differences in the kind of heated/cooked products (food, drink, incense), in the context (family, intra community, inter community), or in the frequency of use (daily, special occasion). In the Middle Bronze Age levels (V A) an andiron has been found in situ , in A58, the room with the central double hearth (fig. 7: 14), and another one out of context (fig. 7: 15). Their particular shape, suggests they were used for holding spits rather than (or as well as?) pots. Similar fragments have been found at Norçuntepe, from a level dated to the end of the EBA (FB UIC) (Schmidt 2002: Taf. 38). THE USE AND INTERPRETATION OF FIRE INSTALLATIONS The distribution of hearths and ovens within dwell- ings and throughout the settlement can be an important clue to understand food systems and 'cooking social relations'. Ethnographic cases abundantly demonstrate that ovens are often shared between families, whilst hearths are more com- monly found in each house. As I have pointed out above, at Arslantepe, located 900 m asi, within the Taurus highlands, hearths certainly had the important function of heating as well as cooking food; their distribution thus does not solely respond to 'cooking rules and relations'. Ovens instead appear to be more reliable indicators of food preparation areas and can thus help in identifying 'eating groups'. Interesting are the distinctions noted in this sense in the different periods of the Arslantepe prehistoric occupation. The presence of wheat and barley grains and of grinding stones next to many of the oven areas suggests flour must have been the main ingredient of the food baked. Fauna is ubiq- uitous in these layers at Arslantepe and it is thus difficult to demonstrate if - and which - meat was actually cooked in the ovens; the presence, at times, of sheep and goat phalanxes inside ovens suggests the meat of these animals might have been roasted in the ovens.

Interpreting fire installations at Arslantepe, Eastern Turkey, from the fourth to the beginning of the second millennium BCE 143 In specific cases we hypothesise that large sherds found in situ on oven floors could have been used as trays for food being baked. Proper flat tray-like vessels that might have been used in the ovens are instead mostly absent at Arslantepe. It is thus plausible that in the majority of cases no container at all was used. PERIOD VIII In period VIII, the excavated area is too small to give a clear understanding of the social organisation of space; three very large ovens have been found, all indoors and in rooms near to one another (Balossi Restelli 2012a). One of these rooms has the whole paraphernalia of food preparation, with parching ovens, hearths and andirons (fig. 7: 1, room A718). In them, staples were not only baked, but also stored and manipulated, as testified by the abundant grinding tools and by large jars and concentrations of carbonised seeds, which were probably kept in sacks or baskets. Whilst the very large dimension of the ovens (up to 2.2 m in diameter, a size that is rarely equalled again at the site) might lead to interpret them as used by groups of families rather than by a single family, the presence of all these food preparation and storage activi- ties has brought me to interpret them as belonging to single domestic units. PERIOD VII Period VII is extensively excavated and is character- ised by both public and and private dwellings. In the North Eastern area of the mound, small private dwellings are found, composed by one or more rooms, situated in a marginal area of the period VII town (Palmieri 1978). Here ovens are con- centrated together in one area, possibly the baking area, thus shared between families. Fuel must have been stored in large quantities nearby. Since there is more than one oven it is possible that each family used its own, but the presence of a communal baking area would indicate a high visibility and commonality of this activity. On the south-western side of the mound, where elite buildings are found (Frangipane 1993), three ovens were brought to light. Each one belongs to a distinct building level constituted by a single multi-room and rather monumental residence (fig. 5: 2); it was possibly used by the elite residents. Yet the baking room never appears to be inside the residence, but next to it. The expansion of the excavated area will show us if each house had its own oven, or the oven used by larger neighbouring elite units. Whatever the case, period VII suggests the presence of distinct bak- ing areas for different social classes, houses or groups. The partial data collected up to now suggests that the elite family (-ies) might have had its (their) own oven and thus formed one single 'eating group', distinct from that of the non-elite quarters. Archaeozoological analysis suggests furthermore that these eating groups also had distinct diets: elites consumed far more cattle than the common households, where sheep, goat and pig were instead more abundant (Bartosiewicz 2010: 123). The period VII temple appears to have a dedicated oven too, found right at the back of Temple C (in room A953) and interpreted by Paolo Guarino (2013) as possibly used to bake food distributed in the temple during ceremonies. Faunai data indicate here a yet different diet, mainly composed of sheep and goat (more than 80 %). I would tend not to believe that the thousands of bowls found in the temple were linked with oven prepared food, but this too is an issue that could be further investigated. In this period, nearly all rooms of private residences have a hearth, thus a house can have two or three hearths, accord- ing to its size (fig. 5: 2). These are generally at the centre of the room and on the majority of hearths, andirons have been found, at times in pairs. The most interesting case is that of the building in Figure 5 (2). Here room A580 is the largest and also has the largest hearth, possibly 1.2 m in diameter (table 1), in which one andiron was found. The lateral rooms A855 and A856 share a smaller hearth, with three andirons. Pots were thus used on both hearths. Pottery distribution though testi- fies for food preparation only in A855-A856, whilst A580 has mostly beakers, small medium jars for the conservation of liquids, bowls, but no cooking pots (Guarino 2013). The in situ pottery suggests that in the larger room A580 people were probably drinking around the wider fire, whilst cooking was taking place in the other room. The position of the hearth at the centre of the room too is good evidence of the habit of sit- ting around it. The presence of the andiron in the A580 hearth might indicate a soup or a drink (but food too cannot be excluded) being kept hot and at intervals served to the com- mensals sitting around it. The larger hearth might be used in collective events, possibly comprising some form of commen- sality, and its dimension suggests that these might at times be open to non-residents too. It is certainly interesting to note that neither the presence of the andiron nor the greater dimension of the hearth appear to be, in A580, diagnostic of the use of this hearth as the cooking hearth of the house.

Balossi Restelli PERIOD VI A Arslantepe VI A (3300-3000 BCE) is characterised by the public monumental area and by a small number of elite residences (D'Anna 2010; Frangipane 1997; 2002 and 2012a). Unfortunately no ovens have been yet brought to light and the residential quarters are very badly preserved (fig. 5: 3). It is thus at the moment impossible to analyse eating groups. Hearths in the public and residential areas are strongly dis- tinct. Those of the residential buildings are typologically alike those of period VII - navel round (type 3; fig. 5: 5) - whilst the ones from the monumental building are either burnt areas slightly sunken in the floor (type 1), or, as in the central room of Temple B, large rectangular plastered depressions (type 8) (Alvaro 2010: 55). The temple fireplaces are at the centre of the main hall, thus highly visible. The two mud pillars stood in front, at both sides of the fireplace, like guarding it. Pottery distribution has brought M. D'Anna and C. Jauss (2015) to interpret the cen- tral room of Temple B as an area in which food was prepared and consumed. This was certainly a type of food preparation strongly charged with symbolic and ritual meanings; further- more it was large quantities of food that were being cooked, with the largest cooking pots being of 22, 32 and 70 1 in capac- ity (D'Anna 2012). It does not surprise us thus that the fireplace is so different from those in the households. The other 'anoma- lous' fireplace (type 9) in period VI A, as mentioned above, is the one in A747, a small room in an elite residence, interpreted by M. Frangipane (Frangipane 1994) as a small domestic shrine (D'Anna 2010), thus this too with possible ritual function. PERIODS VI B1 AND VI B2 VI B1 and VI B2 show a similar behaviour as that seen in the Late Chalcolithic levels. Typologically hearths and ovens are the same as before (fig. 5: 4) and the distribution of these indicates that hearths are in every house, whilst ovens are not. Each house thus prepared its own family daily boiled or stewed food, whilst baked food was prepared in shared facilities. VI B2 dwellings are composed by one or two rooms, of which one is always big- ger than the other (fig. 8:1). This larger room is the one in which the hearth is found. Differently to what seen in the period VII elite residences, cooking and eating took place in the same room, where the family also found warmth and slept. The second room of the dwelling was probably used as a store (Piccione 2009 and 2010; Piccione, Lemorini 2012). Houses in this period suggest residents were small, nuclear units. Ovens are not concentrated in one place, but rather regularly distributed within the village (fig. 8: 1, in black), not only suggesting that baking and fuel col- lection were shared only by neighbouring houses, but also that visibility of these activities to the whole community was limited. Ovens were inside a small room, which in some cases could be linked to a two-roomed dwelling, but in other cases does not seem to belong to any particular house. Distribution of ovens indicates that two-to-four families might have shared the baking area. Such a distribution suggests that residential families, even though nuclear and autonomous in structure, were grouped into larger architecturally visible units, which might correspond to enlarged families or kin groups. Room Al 186 (fig. 8) had tens of grinders, pestles and mortars next to the oven. One of the families might have been baking for the rest of the kin, or the kin group might have been baking there collectively. As for the foods cooked and consumed, botanical data does not indicate any substantial modification from the previous periods, but proportions of species are difficult to compare. Modes of production must surely have changed since the VI A period, with the collapse of the centralised state system. This might have had an impact on the composition of working and eating groups, but not necessarily on dietary choices. PERIODS VI C AND D In the following VI C and VI D periods the plans of the houses as well as those of hearths and ovens change, but their distribution is not substantially modified. The temporary round semi-subterranean structures used by semi-mobile people pres- ent in both periods, have neither built-in hearths nor ovens. Permanent dwellings instead suggest a rather complex situation. In period VI C we have a single structure composed of at least seven rooms, of which only three completely preserved (fig. 8: 4). All the rooms have hearths. Very interesting in comparison to the previous periods is the position of the hearth in the room: these are now never at the centre of the room, but built towards the side, never right next to the wall, but always off-centre. These hearths were thus not suitable for sitting around them, as I suggested during the Chalcolithic, but mainly for cook- ing. The presence of the fixed shoulder used to hold the pots too demonstrates this and their position is most evidently in the quadrant of the room used for that activity. Generally, next to the walls behind the hearth, are benches possibly used as food and utensil storage area (Sadori et al 2006). The cook furthermore looks towards the corner of the room,15 thus her/his view is 15. The hearth shoulder is invariably on the side nearest to the room walls.

RESTELLI concentrated on the kitchen area and not on what is going on in the rest of the room (fig. 8: 2-3). The hearth is thus now specifi- cally used for cooking, whereas in the previous periods it was also the centre of the house, a place around which to sit and talk or share food and drink. Out of the seven rooms belonging to the VI C structure, only two also have an oven (A607 and A609). The repetition of the cooking hearth and of utensils for food manipulation (pes- tles, mortars, etc.) in each room indicates that these were occu- pied by different nuclear families, but the presence of only two ovens suggests that the latter were shared amongst families. This situation continues in the VI D period, where a larger preserved area has been brought to light (fig. 8: 5). Here we have at least seven levels of occupation (Conti and Persiani 1993; Frangipane 2012b) of which the best preserved is charac- terised by one or two multi-room buildings made up of several rooms, plus other partly preserved structures spread around the excavated area. As in the VI C, I take these rooms to be occupied by distinct nuclear families, due to the repetition of the same installations and features in each of them. Their sharing of the same building probably indicates the existence of kin ties between them, as Frangipane has hypothesised (Frangipane 2012b). All rooms have a hearth, of the same kind and in the same position as those of VI C, and there is a single room in each building with an oven. I thus suppose, again, that all inhabitants of the building used the oven. Norçuntepe has exactly the same house plans and distribu- tion of fire installations in contemporary levels of the Horizont VIII (Hauptmann 1976: Table 60). The Arslantepe structures with the ovens are crowded with cooking facilities, which leave little space for other functions. Interestingly, in the best-pre- served level, the room with the oven is smaller in dimensions than the other rooms. I believe this might be due to the fact that this is the only space with a single function, whilst in the other structures all family life and activities took place. Thus, even though the space was probably shared amongst households, it was not necessarily big in size. Differently to what is seen in the VI B2 period, in the same room with ovens there are always also hearths, suggesting, since all other rooms have a hearth too, that certain food preparations implying even boiling/stewing were carried out communally in these rooms. Furthermore, storage vessels in these rooms indicate a certain degree of food conservation taking place here too. The extended families pos- sibly living in these structures would thus appear to have been sharing also foods: baking facilities were shared, but some boiled foods were prepared commonly too (with the hearths), and primary resources for these foods might have been shared as well. Furthermore, these families must have shared external spaces, since the single rooms in which nuclear families lived are all clustered together and outdoor space does not appear to be delimited; spaces for animals and fuel for example could have been common within the extended household. CONCLUSIONS Throughout most of the history of Arslantepe, ovens appear to be shared between families, even though with vary- ing dynamics regulating these common spaces. The reasons for this were partly practical: ovens need greater quantities of fuel than hearths since the oven mud-brick structure needs to be heated before food can be baked; it would thus seem con- venient to heat the oven once and for all. As was in our own towns a century ago, still today in rural Turkish communities (and in many Near Eastern and African countries) tandirs (bread ovens) are often shared and found in street corners.16 In the earlier phases of occupation at Arslantepe (period VIII), each family appears to have its own cooking facili- ties, ovens included, in a way similar to that known from the slightly preceding neighbouring site of Degirmentepe (Gurdil 2005). With period VII, when we have the first clear indications of strong social differentiation, the beginning of pottery mass production, specialised labour forces and food redistribution (Frangipane 2003), spaces dedicated to food baking appear to be differentiated. Elite families have their own baking area and 'commoners' share one area with two-three ovens on the other side of the mound. The period of centralised political and economic life, dur- ing the VI A, is the one for which we have the least data con- cerning domestic food preparation as the majority of data is related to ideologically charged meals (clearly recognisable hearths are found in the temples and in the special ritual room A747), thus very special commensal events. The absence of ovens in the domestic area does not allow other observations. Period VI B1 food preparation areas fit with the strongly communal life style of the Arslantepe pastoral community: common isolated ovens indicate public baking or roasting whilst daily food preparation (boiling and stewing) was a pri- vate domestic event. At the same time, special dwellings with large hearths were probably used in community gatherings, possibly also involving commensality. 16. In Timbuktu, they are at the centre of road crossings and have become proper bakeries. Paléorient, vol. 41.1, p. 127-151 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2015</page><page sequence="21">Hearth and home. Interpreting fire installations at Arslantepe, Eastern Turkey, from the fourth to the beginning of the second millennium BCE 147 Period VI B2 is not too different, but has stronger evidence of the social and economic relations between the Arslantepe inhabitants, possibly due to the more stable nature of the occu- pation. The distribution of dwellings and baking areas has sug- gested a broad autonomy in home economics of nuclear families at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age (VI B2); only baking facilities were shared, on a spatial basis (the nearest houses shared the oven), which might underline parental relations. From 2750 BCE (VI C-D) onwards it is very clearly kin relations that regulate food preparation activities, but possibly also the management of food resources. Nuclear families are part of extended households, who share various elements of their home economics, which include cooking activities but also storage and possibly more. Thus periods VI C and VI D (EBA II-III) eating groups are probably bigger than those of period VI B2, even though communal commensal events might be limited to specific moments and not to daily events. Interestingly this is also the only moment throughout the more than two millennia long analysed sequence, in which hearths and ovens change shape at Arslantepe. No matter the many, at times dramatic, changes in architecture, settlement layout and organisation, and other material culture, hearths and especially ovens have never been modified before. Since food preparation and consumption are socially pat- terned, and thus intertwined with aspects of identity and eth- nicity (Gumerman 1997), the fact that the main instruments of food preparation remain unaltered throughout this long period of time and through major social, political and organisational changes could be taken as evidence of a certain degree of con- tinuity at the base of the society. Food preparation in a domes- tic context is in the majority of world societies a female task (Murdock and Provost 1973), the secrets of which are trans- mitted from mother to daughter through generations with very little modifications (Stein 2012). With period VI C it is not only fire installations that change, but the space assigned for cooking activities: no longer at the centre of the room but in a corner, with an expressly made hearth, not looking towards the rest of the room. Furthermore economic relations might have changed, as some primary resources appear to be shared between the enlarged kin and not only within the nuclear family. Next to these, also others are the elements that suggest a global transformation in period VI C: the shape and size of houses, the arrangement of the settlement, pottery produc- tion and style, external relations. Furthermore, at the end of period VI B2 the site of Arslantepe appears to be abandoned for some time. M. Frangipane (2012b) has hypothesised the settlement of foreigners with completely different traditions, after this abandonment. Was this the case, it could also explain the transformation of cooking facilities at this stage. Whether to this also corresponds a change in dietary composition is still too difficult to prove, but the changes in morphology of cook- ing facilities (both for boiling and baking) have indeed sug- gested different cooking habits. An interesting observation can also be made regarding the different behaviour of material culture indicators: whereas fire installations do not change at each passage from one period to the other (VIII, VII, VI A, VI Bl, etc.), the main utensils for food preparation as andirons and cooking pots are deeply modi- fied at each cultural change, as a response to profound socio- political and cultural transformations. Material culture indicators thus behave differently: andirons, as pottery, appear to vehicle, through style, strong cultural meaning (Appadurai 1997; Sillar 2000; Tite 1999). Hearths and ovens instead - that do not change stylistically in every phase - probably respond to traditions of use and functional needs rather than solely to cultural choices. Arslantepe ovens are mostly indoors. Exceptions appear to be in the VI Bl, when outdoor ovens have been interpreted as public features, in period VII, with the large oven behind tem- ple C, and with some of the ovens of the common dwellings at the north-eastern edge of the mound. The main indoor or enclosed position of ovens suggests that changes in the social and domestic organisation during the Arslantepe sequence do not appear to have an impact upon the visibility of food prepa- ration activities, which remain private in all cases except with pastoral semi-nomadic groups (VI Bl) and when food distribu- tion takes up a symbolic and ideological meaning. Only food prepared and distributed in the temples becomes a public affair and interestingly hearths have a different shape from those of domestic contexts. Symbolic imagery of Arslantepe domestic fire installa- tions is, to our eyes, minimal. Andirons with horns are pres- ent, but this shape, by various scholars related to the stylised image of the bull, has an extremely practical explanation since the points are also best suited for holding pots. Apart from these there are no anthropomorphic representations on fire installations, as those of Transcaucasian tradition. The stronger symbolism of Transcaucasian hearths might be linked to the mobile transhumant character of these pasto- ral groups, who, in moving continuously their house, possi- bly see the hearth, which can be taken around with them, as the symbol of home. Illuminating is the case of Mongolian nomads, who, when settling down for some time, first build the hearth and the yurt is then built around it; it is further- more invariably the head of the family that places the hearth.

RESTELLI At Arslantepe, where people were mostly sedentary, it was probably other features and structures that symbolically rep- resented the house as the home of the kin and family. Yet, the embedded central bowl in the Late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age I hearths might represent the heart of the fire, moved around from the ancestral house to every new home. The standardised shape of Arslantepe fire installations furthermore certainly contributed to maintain the cultural identity of the household in the most intimate context of domestic space.
