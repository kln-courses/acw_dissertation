<plain_text><page sequence="1">Der Mensch und die Religion. VON GERARDUS VAN DER LEEUW. Basel, Haus zum Falken Verlag, 1941. PP. 200. This book represents a bold, but not thoroughly convincing, attempt to show in brief and highly suggestive compass the necessity of an inter-relation between the disciplines of anthropology and theology. The author's philosophical sources are mainly phenomenological and "existential"; Nietzsche, Scheler and jaspers are frequently quoted. His theological sources are mostly Calvinistic and Barthian, though some attention is given to neo-Thomism as expounded by Gilson and</page><page sequence="2">No. 3.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS 337 Maritain. Abundant and telling use is made of literary examples, from Greek tragedy to Chesterton and "The Green Pastures". The book's style is incisive, at times almost aphorismic; it moves by assertion rather than argument. Its value, therefore, lies in its epigrammatic insights and not in a systematic development of its main thesis. The book's form follows its purpose of relating anthropological and theological viewpoints concerning religion. The anthropology in ques- tion is frankly philosophical rather than physical or cultural. The first part, Mensch und Gott, discusses the development of man (Mensch- werdung) in dynamic interplay with nature, in his play (Spiel), under which the author includes dramatic, mythical and ritual repre- sentation, and in other selected aspects of his physical and psychical behavior. The notions of "soul" and the "image of God" are important here. Van der Leeuw seeks to interpret man in terms of a "spiritualis- tic" naturalism in which his religious activity is no less real a contact with nature and God than are his cognitive, volitional and emotional responses. The human sense of belonging to the world is achieved first in play, then frustrated in the experience of death, questioned by conscience, and recovered in the sacrament. The key-concepts here, which correspond to the three dimensions of human development, are body (Leib), the source of possibility, Soul (Seele), the locus of power, and the creature (Geschipf), "existence toward God". The book's second part, Gott und Mensch, treats these from the theological standpoint, and culminates in a Mythos des Menschen summarizing this threefold relatedness of God to man. Frequent use is made of the author's earlier studies in this field, L'homrne primitif et la Religion and Phiinomenologie der Religion especially. The American reader is apt to have considerable difficulty with the phenomenological habit of shifting discussion from one level of dis- course to another. There is undoubtedly a strongly naturalistic (though not empirical) strain in van der Leeuw's thought, which speaks of religion as "the belongingness of man to the non-human", identifies the theological with the cosmological search, and insists on the neces- sity for "anthropomorphic" thought. But on the other hand he holds that religion is revelational and incarnational, and that we must remain open to the possibility that "theology is not the highest possibility of anthropology but the presupposition of all anthropology" (iio). On this premise God really speaks to men, and faith alone can interpret the togetherness of physical and spiritual as a "two-dimensional reality". What thus began as an attempt at philosophical synthesis turns out, apparently, to be an assertion, with Berdyaev, that "Christology is the only true anthropology" (II3). One must conclude with regret that van der Leeuw's attempt has failed, while at the- same time recogniz-</page><page sequence="3">338 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL.
