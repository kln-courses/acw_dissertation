<plain_text><page sequence="1">KENNETH REXROTH TO LOUIS ZUKOFSKY Louis Zukofsky first contacted Kenneth Rexroth in November 1930, soliciting poetry for the 1931 Objectivists issue of Poetry magazine. Almost two years older than Rexroth, Zukofsky had spent all his life in New York City, where he had received a Columbia M.A. with a thesis on Henry Adams. Like Rexroth, he was deeply invested in philosophy (particularly Aristotle and Spinoza) and was an ardent Marxist. Zukofsky sought to use his issue of Poetry to launch a new poetic "movement," the "Objectivists," and laid out its defining terms in the polemical essay "Sincerity and Objectification" The following year, he edited An "Objectivists" Anthology. "Almost all of the people that Zu kofsky picked as Objectivists"Rexroth recalled, "didnt agree with him, didnt write like him or like one another, and didnt want to be called Objectivists" While Zukofsky published Rexroth in both the Objectivists issue of Poetry and An Objectivists" Anthology, the two men rarely saw eye to eye on issues of poetics, as is evident in the two following letters. In the second letter, the twenty-five-year-old Rexroth responds both to the "Sincerity and Objectification" manifesto and to "American Poetry 1920-1930," a hard-nosed survey of contemporary writing Zukofsky published in January 1931 in The Symposium. The two men remained friendly in later years: Zukofsky spent time with Rexroth when he visited San Francisco in 1958. But while Rexroth would increasingly acknowledge Zukofsky as an important poet, Zu kofsky seems to have paid little attention to Rexroths career after the "Objectivist" interlude. Mark Scroggins ? REXROTH TO ZUKOFSKY 17</page><page sequence="2">16 January 1931 Dear Louis; Three days ago I started to write a few notes to elucidate my poem. I discovered that what I wished to say would take a volume, perhaps many volumes, so I have started on what gives promise for being material for a life's work. I have postponed the attempt to explicitly order my fundamental notions regarding the universe in which I find myself. Seeing about me men, accepted as intelligent, who grow old without ever approaching a real synthesis, living in an age in which constructive thought, if it matures at all, matures late, I have taken it for granted that I could always wait, that 30 or 50 years would find me better prepared to attack the central problems of my thought. I am afraid I have been mistaken. These very problems arise in the tissue of the living experience which daily surrounds me; if that tissue is not to become a web, eventually to trap and strangle the thought which should coordinate its various strands, I must begin that task of evalu ation now. After all, Berkeley wrote his important work before he was 28, Scotus died somewhere in his early thirties, even Dr. Angelicus lived only to the age of 50. To Scotus more than to any other I owe my interpretation of the world, not that I am a Scotist, God forbid. (As I have been writing these last few days the most diverse influences have arisen to name the ideas on my page, from Proclus to Bradley or Royce, from Stoicism to the "organic philosophy." I really had no idea my brain contained such a horde.) It therefore behooves me to imitate his example. I dont know why you picked on Grudin. I seem to remember penciling in a note about him. I felt good about Lou that day and I may have given you the idea I considered him a very important per son, critic, poet. I do think he has one very commendable trait, he has attempted to do something which few others have, to take himself seriously. He has lapses. The tone of his criticism of Val?ry or Russell for instance. Val?ry, particularly in America which is inclined to be a little innocent about such matters, needs a thorough trouncing, Pure Thinkers are a nuisance and an obstruction to purity of thought, but Grudin s method is not the way to go about it (for Grudin, that is). I don t think Grudin a great poet, certainly not a great aesthetician, 18 I CHICAGO REVIEW</page><page sequence="3">hardly a philosopher. But I do think he deserves acclaim for an attempt to "set his lands in order." For some reason we take very seriously the digest of J.S. Mill given us in our high-school science courses; we therefore in later life are forced to ingest an ideology like the amoe bae which delighted us in those courses, enveloping it and attacking it from the periphery inwards. We have even come to consider the ability to go to Chicago without "bounding Illinois" something very mysterious, and "intuition" is the catchphrase of our contemporary mystagogues. This is too bad, but it is the way the human mind has come to function, or think it functions. And this is the fault of Lous aesthetic. He has come up on it like the belt of asteroids held between inner and outer hierarchies of significance by forces which he has been content to characterize as centripetal and centrifugal and then ignore. Either an aesthetic leads straight into solar principles and out to the wandering comets of purely occasional experience or like Bradley s universe it is an entertaining arrangement of "what merely appears," which is "inconsistent if taken as true." For this reason although they possess a real potentiality for the achievement of adequacy, Grudins more "abstract" notions are never mediated satisfactorily with the fac tors of actual experience. His book lacks a valid whence and whither. It suffers from the scientific contentment with "how" and ignores the full significance of an exhaustively pertinent "why." To make such demands of an aesthetic means that the aesthetician is required to follow in the footsteps of the great systematic philoso phers, something few of them have ever felt impelled to do. Aesthetics is embedded in the little system of related questions known as the "Classic Problems," this indeterminate equation system must be given form and meaning, at least in the mind of the aestheti cian, before he can attack the more particular problems of his chosen field. The world of ideas is cluttered up with sign posts, notes, statis tics, census (is it fifth?), methods, observations, "Idle thoughts of idle fellows," and singularly few ideas. T.E. Hulme used to say this and yet remained content with that situation in his own writings till his death. Perhaps had he lived? He seems to have been an evil-tempered beast, maybe its just as well. By chance (looking for Zukofsky s) I came yesterday on a remark of Stravinsky's in a Paris letter of the Dial. "I have never given the public my experiments." Those who would tackle the questions of REXROTH TO ZUKOFSKY | 19</page><page sequence="4">philosophy would do well to follow his example. But again let me say: Grudin is to be commended for recognizing the existence of a problem. For an attempt however faulty, to provide a rational scheme for practice. It is blemished with flippancy, full of perfectly obvious mistakes, fragmentary as even the sketch of an aesthetic, full of notions dragged in from an epistemology which he has never criticized and devoid of coordination with foundation and superstructure, but it represents the attempt of a poet to be conscious about his art. Poor Coleridge was unable to stick with an idea or even with many poems for long, and since him who has even so much as realized that it might profit him so to do? Emerson was one of our (us) greatest poets, and one of our best (us) philosophers but he kept the two activities separate. I recall nothing very trenchant in all his work on the subject of his art. Please do not understand that I think a poet should necessar ily be a philosopher. I most certainly do not. I am quite sure that philosophic notions as such never entered the heads of Theocritus, Horace, Herrick, or of many others less pastoral, and I like these poets very much. But I think Eliot s thesis in "Blake" (echoed by Tate in the preface to White Buildings) is perfectly correct. There are no ready-made syntheses to hand for the contemporary artist. He must get out and make one for himself. After all, this is not an impossible task. All the early Greek thinkers were poets. Plato, Seneca, Abelard, St. Thomas, the history of literature is full of those who achieved a unified expression of their attitude towards reality both implicitly in poetry and explicitly in prose. The most synthetic of the evangelists is the greatest poet of the gospels, St. John, one of the greatest poets in the Old and New Testaments. Neither do I think it necessary that the contemporary poet should thus vest his ideology in the explicit for the admiration of posterity. If he feels so impelled, well and good. If not, the art of poetry offers possibilities inexhaustible for a fully conscious mind. But the consciousness must be there, the synthetic vision at least implied. Then too, there is this consolation, that sympathy with the speculative thinking of a diversity of men is the final touchstone of culture; there are relatively few men at any one time who possess it. The man who is not irritated by the strange machinery of the cosmos of Proclus is rare indeed, and still rarer is he who can untangle the really valuable thought of Renaissance philosophy in Italy from the 20 I CHICAGO REVIEW</page><page sequence="5">exigencies of its confused nomenclature. Poetry is by contrast acces sible to interest for an extremely wide audience. Once the individual has freed himself from provincial bigotries he is at least potentially capable of sympathy with the poetry of all time. The subtleties of the two Summas may escape him but he must be a dense fellow indeed if the Pange Lingua fails to provide him with new realms of meanings. He may find the Sic et Non dry stuff but if the great sequences seems to him purposeless he needs education. (The secular poetry of the late middle age which Pound admires so much owes its inspiration largely to Abelard.) The poet has, after a few perfunctory struggles, acquiesced in the judgment of capitalist civilization: that he is a weak, lazy fellow, incapable of rational thought, merely a convenient dispenser of vicari ous spasms of emotion. The unconscious efficiency with which a class preserves itself is uncanny. The greatest enemy of social stasis is the subterranean transvaluations which go on in the arts, and this enemy operates most efficiently in the art of poetry for the reason that poetry is, or can be, most intimate with the values concerned. Poetry is the symbolic criticism of value and because this criticism can garb itself in even the most random subject, it is specifically inapprehensible. Many a panegyric, written as a set subject for the enthronement of a monarch has been part of the exploration of avenues of thought which has led to the overthrow of his dynasty. Therefore, as the range of value for poetry reduces to a minimum the security of the prevailing ideology approaches a maximum. If everyone contented himself with moaning "Here in the garden where the scented South / Wind chastens melody" our masters could ride us forever. In fact, capitalism was so successful throughout the nineteenth century that every attempt at escape ended in a new emotional cul-de-sac. It was for this reason that the plastic, the least specific of all the arts, led in the overthrow of the Romantic heresy. Music is not specific? It is the most specific of all arts. The amount of variation between individuals in visceral, neural, chemical, motor effects resultant from the hearing of a musical passage is slight. As the savage used the war drum, so Beethoven is used today to drive men into the competitive melee. Music has almost thoroughly prostituted itself to the Goddess of competition, perhaps that is why communists listen to it with so much awe. Breathes there a Bolshevik with soul so dead who has not swooned on Beethovens REXROTH TO ZUKOFSKY 21</page><page sequence="6">superhuman heights? Not that I particularly single out him, almost all modern music is tarred with the same brush. I really mustn't start on another book. So to sum up. It is con sciousness which I wish reintroduced into poetry, not bare awareness of sensa, or "localism," but consciousness of all the implications, the final issues, the guiding purpose. Which means a reintroduction of seriousness, a respect for ends, a banishing of the sentimentality and flippancy between which the vast majority of contemporary poetry fluctuates line for line. Not necessarily "great and noble subjects" though we could stand them, but subjects which, no matter how limited, are thought of as worthy of the writing, as an integral part of that vast complexus of vital significance we call the universe. In reading some of the "minors" of the 17th century this evening it was borne upon me how great a unity underlies their thought. If the literature of the age were to pass away and we were left with one single solid poem by Kynaston, Godolphin, Hall, King, Chirbury, or Quarles, a critic of sufficient insight and possessed with a "capacity for taking infinite pains" could in a measure reconstruct the world of ideas which gave it birth. It is the union of the general with the specific into one characteristic order analogous to the ordered purpose of an organism harmonically related to its environment which is typical of all great poetry. Last night I was reading La Vita Nuova, a world of the sweetest seriousness and most serious sweetness in any language. Who today even dares couple the words "sweet seriousness" without self-con sciousness? God forbid that I should quarrel with you about Adams. William James was of the greatest value to psychology and philosophy. Henry James was perhaps the greatest novelist that ever lived, our debt to Mallarm? is incalculable. But they achieved these distinctions in spite of themselves. The thoroughgoing skepticism produced by the growth of the Servile State destroyed the rational bases of action, and removed any faith in the validity of ends. This is the inevitable conclusion of the philosophy of James. The pragmatic test can never work unless on some occasion, in the future or the present, there be a definite deter mination of what is true on that occasion. Otherwise the pragmatist remains an intellectual Hamlet, perpetually adjourning decision of judgment to some later date. The characters of Henry "wandering 22 I CHICAGO REVIEW</page><page sequence="7">desolate up and down terraces, debating in anguish of soul whether to offer each other cigarettes" are the visible embodiments of Williams philosophy. The fact that Adams wrote a lot of books in which much can be found that is pertinent to topical issues has nothing to do with the lack of vital realization of purpose which his work exhibits. No man of the time was more aware of the inconsequent nature of the reality of his world than Adams himself. That he felt that world unsatisfactory is perfectly true, that he was never able to really find a way to restore its foundations is also true. He remained in the grip of the deified Anangke created by the scientific outlook of his time. The idea that the order of nature was a remorseless mechanism in which whatever was not trivial emerged ephiphenomenally and but for an instant, robbed a mind which possessed great potentialities of the power of realizing them. Surely you do not believe that Adams was one of the worlds greatest thinkers? But he might have been if his reason had not told him that its every achievement was essentially trivial. Duchamp is in somewhat the same position. "LVnivers nest quun d?faut dans la puret? du Non-Etre" is with him the central fact of life (or was five years ago). It is this which makes him disappointing to impulsive sensualists and it is the ability to realize in himself the implications of such a doctrine which raises him above them. As for Hart Crane. I hear all kinds of tales about him. Tales which sound like Rimbaud, by the way. I prefer not to believe these stories, they sound like the products of literary envy, I'll wait till I meet him. But his poetry could easily be written by such a person. What values it contains are so hysterically exemplified that they disappear in the general thunder of emotion. If he would write with an ice pack on his head and sit on another he might lift into clarity meanings of the greatest value. As it is his apparatus, constructed with undue generality of emotional lure wavers between the B?n?dicte or the Canticle of the Sun and Madame Blavatsky. It may embody a supreme affirmation, and it may be just excitement. Hart Cranes resemblance to Rimbaud is primarily technical. That he has ever sought the utter ens of poetry I doubt. That he realizes affirmation as a mode of denial, or denial as a mode of affirmation, I doubt. Like a woman in a train wreck he wards off the ultimate trauma with hysteria. He is of course a good poet. Dont think that because I am not afflicted with the specious REXROTH TO ZUKOFSKY 23</page><page sequence="8">group loyalty of my contemporaries I think them insignificant. Lewis, attempting to take Joyce seriously and to "expose" him pays him a far greater compliment than those who have engulfed him in silly adulation in transition. This also applies to Williams. I am not one of his opponents, when he does something foolish I am only distressed. Williams is a fine guy* I read his poetry. I also read, say, Henry King. I really find as much in King. It is true that I have never been able to get hold of as much of Williams. Also I think he is a terrible influence on youngsters who take his dicta seriously. The poem in the first number of usa is altogether inexcusable. In your former letter you spoke of the value of "nominalism." I forgot to mention it but it has puzzled me extremely. I may have missed a more recent use of the term but for me nominalism means that philosophical conception which arose at the end of the 11th century in the writings of Roscellinus, that universalis sunt nomina, vocis flatus, and found final expression almost 300 years later in Wil liam of Occam. What this has to do with me I can t imagine. Or you may mean the reverse, nomina sunt universalis, a sort of Absolute Symbolism. I am afraid it would take me days adequately to explain what I conceive to be the function of universals, of the role language plays in the indication and coordination of terms. Anyway I am not an Occamist and I do not believe in an Absolute Word in any sense other than that employed in the first chapter of the Gospel according to St. John. You'd think from all his talk about The Word that you were listening to a lot of first-century Gnostics. I may be neck and neck with others, but I do not believe that anyone has pushed the so-called revolution of the word any further than I have in either French or English and still clung to words that could be found in an unabridged dictionary. I have no desire to imitate the Work in Progress because I can still, if I work sufficiently hard, express myself with the materials provided by Funk and Wagnalls. I may eventually find them inadequate and modify them, but I fear I shall never desert them entirely. But the spectacle of a large number of presumably intelligent people us ing reams of paper to convince each other that they don't mean what they say fills me with amazement. I have always tried to find adequate * I think his personal qualifications have led to an overestimation of his literary importance. [Rexroths deletion] 24 I CHICAGO REVIEW</page><page sequence="9">expression for perfectly clear ideas. I have tried to say what I mean and mean what I say. That I do not mean in saying exactly the sort of things that Dryden meant is the result of history; but I have tried to equal him in lucidity. Now for your poems. My library with all my magazines is in sf waiting till I can get enough money to have it shipped. I have no Dials containing work of yours, no H&amp;Hs, except one section of the Adams. Nothing but Paganys 1, 2, &amp; 3. 1st Page 79 #1 [Zukofskys "Cactus, rose-mauve and gray"]: I think the first two lines are unnecessarily static; the intention of course is to get the image of the cactus fixed, rigid, and malleolar, that it may be eventually, at the end of the poem, shifted with maximum empathy. But it seems to me that elliptical metaphor is an insufficiently dynamic way of obtaining stasis (to be elliptical myself). Red is too close to rose, mauve, and grey, something about the color scheme must be changed, green mortuary doesn't accomplish it. The bud must not be merely negated but felt as forc ibly restrained. But when the cactus which I see as hot, grey, green, and opaque in spite of you, is dropped in snow with the tread of the narrator, the effect leaves nothing to be desired. The drama of "brute fact" is showed forth perfectly. Nescience erases it, the cactus, not the drama, like a curtain, and one sees the brain swinging above the snow as containing only the hot vegetable pad lost in a white gloom. Out of which grows distinct the dead hand potent, Hannah "grace," as a woman in a room, order and the focus of order, or instinctive in another kind of whiteness. On blue velvet the cactus is necessarily rose mauve, but the blue velvet convinces me that the flower should have been yellow. Many cactus flowers are yellow and the red is ir repressible, you can't "minus" it. I would have said "Snow/Duration" and although the last three lines are good I would have thought much about altering them. This is "localism" with relevance. It resembles Stevens's "Jar in Tennessee," but although it is not as skillful, it is, or at least seems today, more adventurous, and it hasn't that gourmetizing ooziness of Stevens. Page 21 #11 [Zukofskys "It is well in this June night," "And look ing to where shone Orion," and "Only water?"] : Wickson gets in the way. I is too self conscious altogether, the humor is not in quite the right key. The scene is set, elements may be extracted from it later, but since the "personal touch" interferes it is little better than photo REXROTH TO ZUKOFSKY | 25</page><page sequence="10">graphic. II: There are too many words and they sort of clump about, there seems to be a sort of struggle between the matter and the spirit of the utterance. Orion, miracle of son, miles of beach, coarse grass and ocean waste, green of stars, cucumber, have great possibilities which are inadequately realized. Ill is perfect, I have nothing more to say at all about it. Its all there and the last verse embodies meaning utterly familiar and utterly unique which constitutes great poetry. This is individualism with implications. The first two poems, I feel, could be dispensed with for the achievement of the last. The only essential thing is to set some sort of focus or rather the individuality diffuses out into the landscape and does not survive as a nugget for the final declaration of inclusive relevance. I have written this not out of any desire to "teach" you anything. I have little personal contact with other poets and thus perhaps tend to sound pedantic. But simply because this is the way I would like to think of others attending to my own work. And to point out to you exactly when and where I have found satisfaction, and so far as I can, why. I hope I have not offended you or given you the impression that I think of your poetry as a literary exercise providing material for further literary exercise on my part. Poetry is, I hope, completely vital for me. This is all I seem to be able to find. I thought there was more. But when I go up to sf 11 get the magazines and write about the oth ers. And I most anxiously await "A" and "The." It was the forthright consciousness exhibited in "The" that attracted me. That was the first thing of yours I saw, my subscription to the Criterion having expired just before you appeared. In re Maritain, my objection to that gentleman is strictly private. In the last analysis I am on his side and not on Bretons. I have no quarrel with any specific point in Maritains aesthetic. I would not phrase it that way, but that s a matter of preference. My objection is rather to the talcumed frenchy odour which hovers over it and to its grossly "popular" character. Talcum powder is a cross Frenchmen must bear. Even many of the modern French saints are somewhat lacey. His audience is the salon and the Left Bank, I suppose that is the way to approach them. Even his nationalism is palatable. I doubt if he feels that war has benefited the human race, or that imperialist competition will beget a millennium; likely, if subjected to rigorous 26 CHICAGO REVIEW</page><page sequence="11">cross-examination his nationalism would turn out to be much what Comintern means by Cultural Self Determination. I do not agree that the demand of Breton that poetry "advance our abstract knowledge properly so called" loads the art with "onera importabilia" But how that advance is achieved is not described in a page. And I do not be lieve that a society with a strong sense of functional responsibility can be restored by the Catholic Church. At least not until Capitalism has been overthrown. And I do not believe that the present hierarchy of the church desires any such thing, or would not fight such a move if it became threatening. And I do not believe this hierarchy at all suited to be trusted with a theocracy, or will be until a resentful proletariat has just about trounced it to death. Faithfully, Kenneth ? 10 March 1931 Dear Louis; Although I have delayed so long in writing you, I have been thinking much about the problems presented by your paper in Symposium, the issue of Poetry, and your letter. I have made several abortive attempts to answer you, that is I wrote two different letters and sat down to the typewriter several times. But the letters were unsatisfactory and what with influenza, rheumatism, and the general depression accompanying ill health, I have continuously postponed a third attempt. I suppose I could have written you a chatty "friendly" sort of letter, but I for one am always mildly insulted when I receive such missives, and I write them only to relatives. It is hard to know where to begin. Perhaps in the most funda mental notions I am in radical disagreement with you, but I am not sure. Your manifesto is not exactly written on your shirt front where all who run may read. You may simply have been led to emphasize aspects which I would have touched in passing, and to have relegated to a second position items which I consider primarily important. On REXROTH TO ZUKOFSKY 27</page><page sequence="12">the whole I suspect that our disagreement goes much deeper than this. Both in my life and work I have constantly striven to embody a perfectly definite program. Not exactly a "message," but at least a consistent attitude based on, so to speak, a "body of doctrine" which I have attempted to elevate above the momentary phases of the em piric ego. Not that I have run about asking "posers," only to produce an answer from my sleeve and beat my opponent over the head with it. I have always tried to avoid bringing ready-made answers to the problem of life, but I have always expected the answer to emerge with sufficient labor, to at least be, in the nature of the problem if not of the questioner, potentially capable of such elicitation. And too, I have always considered those factors of experience which endure through the modifications of the body of greater importance than my contem poraries seem willing to grant them. In other words, it has been my intention to keep at the core of the complexus of meaning arising in experience, a real and active rationalism. I am by no means sure that, therefore, I agree with you as to the nature of poetry, the feature of the art most important to the critic, or with the more general attitude implicit in these rather literary notions. First, I shall try to answer your letter, and incidentally, give you some of that information about myself for which you asked. Disembarass yourself of the notion that I am a scholar. I may be intermittently scholarly. I would like to be able to consider myself one but I am far from it. I have tried to live up to my idea of what a poet should be but I am afraid I have not been altogether successful. You say "a synthesis of 13th century thought and the late meta physics." You attribute on the one hand scholarship, on the other a provincialism most incompatible with even very commonplace cultural achievements. Also the description sounds much like Eliot. I have spoken of the late metaphysicals primarily because they are the last, with the exception of Dryden and Pope, who interest me at all. ("Emily" Hopkins, Whitman, Poe, etc., the radicals of the 19th century strike me as guilty of the faults of their contemporaries and of the additional one of perversity; that is not quite true of "Emily" she s a miniature Bront? and so far so good, but a terribly limited world, the focus of its evaluations in the visceral plexus (vide her famous definition of poetry).) Also at the time I wrote you I was reading them 28 CHICAGO REVIEW</page><page sequence="13">evenings aloud. I am very fond of many other poets, even occasionally Milton, in English. And of many both classic and medieval, in Latin. And of Dante. I imagine I have found most in Dante for the very simple reason that there is most there to be found. (I do not believe that I often miss much in any poet, I am willing to grant the claims of even his most enthusiastic admirers, but I find that usually they are content with less than I am.) My tastes, like my religion, bear often a most unfortunate resemblance to Mr. Eliot s. For instance, I agree with him about Chapman, but disagree about Ben, I find few of the faults in Jonson he finds, and I think his criticism is a concession to the popular taste which finds him dull without ever having read him. I am not sure what he thinks about the bard of Avon. His, Shakespeare s, excessively acquisitive mind repels me. Some day some communist with sufficient brains is going to make mincemeat of Shakespeare. French literature usually irritates me. I am afraid I am incurably English in my seriousness. German I cant read, lots of it sounds wonderful but I can make out very little. I intend to repair this de fect as soon as possible. I suspect however I shall still find it sounds marvelous and means little. I like Greek almost unqualifiedly. I am by way of being something of a Hellenist. Also I suspect from what of St. John Damascene and St. Gregory Nazianzus I have read that a great poetry is buried in Byzantine manuscripts. I have never met anyone who knows post-Hellenic literature and I don t know where I could obtain it; this is one of the reasons I would like to live abroad. I have read little Italian besides Dante, I am almost afraid to. As for the Philosophers. I suppose you mean Scotus? I am in the process of out growing Scotus; I still think he is one of the really great philosophers, not as great as St. Thomas, or Plato, or Aristotle, or several others, but much greater than the Neo-Scholastics (who mention, "the Scotists say thus and so," and demolish him in a footnote) give him credit for being. And there are several key notions first explicated by him I find indispensable. And I prefer his qualified intellectualism to the exces sive rationalism of St. Thomas. I think St. Thomas one of the three greatest philosophers, and possessed of a sheer perfection of thought which has never been equaled, but I object to the over-emphasis of the Neo-Scholastics, who tend to consider Thomism, the Truth, and the Catholic Faith as synonyms. I read Hegel with irritation, however I have found his followers suggestive if not satisfactory. I have great REXROTH TO ZUKOFSKY 29</page><page sequence="14">admiration for the philosophy of Plotinus and its final statement by Proclus. I have found much of value in A.N. Whitehead. In other words I have tried to keep myself unprejudiced and to at least make some attempt to grasp the attitude of the given thinker, and not like M. Maritain, tell him what he is talking about. I have one blind spot. I read Mill and Spencer with very little pleasure, in fact I am radically out of sympathy with most 19th-century thought, a natural and com mon bias. I am afraid I was insufficiently clear about my demand for synthe sis. I do not mean necessarily a tabulated synthesis, an itemized brain. If the individual possesses the possibilities for such an achievement, well and good. If not, equally well and good as far as the evaluation of his work as literary fact goes. But there must be that thing to which coordinated general theory if it be really valuable is garment rather than structure, personal synthesis. I am not greatly fond of Pindar, all in all his was a theoretical synthesis, sound enough to be sure, but for me inadequate. Sappho on the other hand was a marvelously co ordinated organism, utterly vital and utterly inter-significant, but her mind was a reflection of an order of movement, a "realm of being" (in a more general sense than Santayana) rather than an ordered realm of meaning. In the last analysis it is being which is important in poetry, meaning is there only as the necessary modality of factual immediacy. The meaning for Sappho was achieved in the achievement of being, as the effulgence thereof. "Uncreated Light." In other words contributive to purpose as an interest complexus indicating satisfaction derivative in large measure from the purpose as funded. This is the nature of the dance, satisfaction in organic fact, and for this reason the dancer is his own best audience, offering to himself a grand hierarchy of sat isfactions, a plenum of organic achievement. And for this reason the dance is the fundamental mode of "expression" per se. Song as Ding an sich is only a dance convention, thus we shout and jump or sing and dance for joy. Here, in these "expressive" arts empathy is the mode of enjoyment, it is einf?hling which is necessary for the appreciation of Duncan or McCormick, not plastic sophistication or musical taste. Since it is easy to feel at least a little and very difficult to understand at all, empathetic notions are the rule in bourgeois aesthetics. Also the worship of the interpreter. It is the singing, not the music which counts. Of course this limits art. Of course this is popular romanti 30 CHICAGO REVIEW</page><page sequence="15">cism. I am not apologizing for it, merely describing it. Baudelaire, I think, foresaw the rise of the actor. However the poet who is both thinking organ and organic thought, drama and act, music and song, surpasses the classifications of Romantic and Classic. The interest, motivation, and the moving purpose may be so functionally unified in their action-interaction relationships that the realms of meaning are significant only as interpretive channels for companion purposes; other people or purposes in the individual are relevant only as history, past or future, for the given satisfaction. I think Whitehead would call this the reduction of symbolic reference to the penumbra of the reflex. That poems can be written this way is doubtful. Whitehead again, if I remember rightly, attributes this utter actuality, actus purus, to the words of Christ (either Symbolism or Religion in the Making). It is however the ideal of all art and it is the mistake of M. Maritains rather incoherent aesthetic that in calling aesthetics the "science of things made" he loses sight of the essentially ideal character of his definition. This has nothing to do with his objections to neocubism as art impossibly purified. He there contradicts his fundamental thesis and involves himself in a discussion of principles of practice of which, for all his urbanity, he is really as ignorant as Wilenski. Aesthetik is the science of made things meaning, or meaning as founded rather than contributive. It is the description of those activities which approach this character but never wholly realize it. Thus, if carried far enough, it constitutes an adequate description of the whole of reality, adequate in the sense of being exhaustive, unsatisfactory in the artificiality which dogs its terms. What our rationalists never understand is that reality is, though always accessible to, yet actually inexhaustible by reason. Life is for the pure rationalist at least potentially static; for this reason the Thomistic heaven is saved from stasis only at the expense of consistency. Reason is a limiting faculty; the cardinal number (Can tor) of its complete satisfaction is relatively low. Love in the Scotist sense is insatiate satisfaction, the cup full to overflowing, the process of achievement considered as interminable, having as its end the last transfinite, the aggregate of aggregates. Meaning is description and description is limited to interests, purpose on the other hand when fully realized is infinitely fecund with interests. Thus the Scotist heaven is infinitely active. Although the process of the Beatific Vision tran scends time, it doesn't possess that attribute of absolute eternity, the REXROTH TO ZUKOFSKY 31</page><page sequence="16">unlimited as its own limit, which is the attribute of God alone. In other words, God is absolute value for Himself; for creatures He is evaluated, or the apprehension of the values of the Absolute. St. Thomas never adequately got the saints out of God except by categorically saying so. Little do, I imagine, MM. Massis and Maurras realize the inherent "orientalism" of their philosopher. So, to come back to the point, the specific individual, the purposive vital fact is greater than its internal meanings. They are there for it as modes involved in its achievements, but they are not necessary in the fullness of their relationships for consciousness, to the realization of these achievements. This sounds rather James-Langeish but that is not my idea. The realm of meanings is really there, really ordered, really part of the process of attainment, but it emerges only partially in the stress of apprehension. It occurs to me that Newman in one of his "Sermons Before the University of Oxford" made a similar distinction between what he called Implicit and Explicit Reason. I have forgotten the substance of his argument. I remember it as being unduly "intuitional." Perhaps not, it is many years since I read the Cardinal. In other words, purposes are directed to ends (other purposes and finally the purpose of God), not to "reasons." On demand, with sufficient labor, the individual should be able to (granting him utter honesty) give all the reasons, justify himself fully. Fortunately we are never called upon, except in our own eschatology, to ever make such an effort, or we should spend our lives so doing. In this sense however all activity (being referred ultimately to the purpose of God in the world) passes before the eyes of Christ as judge. That some person should choose to "give the reasons," to consider as fully as possible the meaning of their activities is simply a fact of human nature. That this activity is for the individual an increase in range of achievement is doubtful. He is in so doing increasing his freedom to choose, but limiting his freedom to do. No one of course avoids either act or mean ing; it is purely a matter of personal emphasis. That these persons, in a sense the "contemplatives" are less valuable to society than the "actives" is not however true. Incidentally this is not the meaning of "contemplation" in theology. The contemplation of the religious is activity of love, a doing in the highest sense. The Mary "who hath the greater portion" is not an Aristotle or a Whitehead and the Martha a 32 I CHICAGO REVIEW</page><page sequence="17">Hippias or an Einstein, but a St. Theresa or a St. Francis and a Napo leon or an Edison, as of course you know. The distinction is moral, not "behavioristic." Aristotle was, I imagine, a Martha; St. Louis, who did an awful lot, a Mary. In re the questions of forms in history. Certainly the plastic of Raphael is a definite order of meaning, but it is not exclusively that. It is an order of meaning for me. It was an order of meaning not identi cal but analogous for his contemporaries. But the particular order is an accident of its history, and not a determinant of its essence. If it were, it, the plastic, would evaporate between brush and canvas. The world-as-history is essentially chaotic because it is devoid of axes of reference, nothing can happen in it. You cant have Pure Relativism because relationship demands relata. The contemporary commotion about congruence in mathematics demonstrates this very well. If you cant establish any grounds, if real comparisons are impossible, you must agree with Eddington and Poincar? that mathematics, physics, and ultimately all knowledge, all being even, are just sweet delusions; if you are amoral, a pleasant game; if moral, self-abuse. Underlying the possibility for analogy in Raphaels plastic is the final fact. The "School of Athens" (or whatever). It transcends meaning, because it is real. In a sense it has nothing to do with meanings, meanings are not brought to it, or put into it. But this is not all. There is real con gruence, or real analogy. My meanings parallel say Winckelmanns exactly as the meanings derived from a mathematical exposition read by a Chinaman and an Englishman. The equation is exhaustible however in its context, the painting is possibly not. For the reason that in the painting the substrate is not a symbol; that is the mistake of neo-symbolism and the cult of the Word; but a thing res vera. As long as man remains man that thing will possess potentialities for significance. If he be a Marinetti he may need education, or operation in his adrenals, but the possibilities are enduring. Of course creatures out of the Amazing Story magazine, with carbon disulphide instead of blood might find the "School of Athens" difficult no matter how great their intellectual powers. Or Shavian Supermen might find it trivial, but I am as skeptical of the evolution of Shavian Supermen as of the evolution of creatures with uranium lymph nodes. I am not sure that I have made sufficiently clear that the ground of reference is not a neutral "thing," but an ordered object containing REXROTH TO ZUKOFSKY | 33</page><page sequence="18">as an essential constituent the same sort of reasonable order exhibited by the mind of the percipient. It differs from the "natural" object, what I would call the "occasional" object, in the inherent apprehensibility of the values to which it owes its existence. In poetry the problem is complicated by the material, i.e., the "material cause," words, which obviously play a symbolic role. Po etry is closest to symbolism and thus most dependent on "affective states." It is the duty of the poet to so construct the poem that the words thereof depend as exclusively as possible on quite constant "meaning," either derived directly from the dictionary or made fully explicit in the context. This does not limit the possibilities for di vergent meanings in the reader, but it assumes a real congruence of "affective states" (Eisenstein, I think, has made this quite clear in the cinema) and a real rationality invariant in the chances of audience. This, I assume, is what you mean by "nominalism." Where I differ is on the emphasis on rational as well as biologic (neural) order. It is a difference of emphasis, but it is the difference between Williamss "localism"?"thank God we have got rid of the great subject,"' id est, poetry without "theme"?and purposive, conscious writing. In the long run pure "nominalism" leads straight to nonsense vocables. Physical order, what you call "counterpoint" etc., can never make a work rational. Chaos is not the antithesis of "order," it is the antithesis of purpose. For this reason the work of Joyce, elaborately fugued, is as important as casual fact or passive dream. The substrate is not just a thing like a stone or cloud of gas, but an ordered world, a microcosm. It is not a rational order in the sense that it is an order of meanings; this is true, granting an impossible concentration in the spectator, or any "object." Even the stone or gas is really an inexhaustible reservoir of meaning, but only the stone finds that inexhaustibility in itself. The perfect religious utterance may conceivably approach this degree of inexhaustibility more than any other aesthetic object, at least for the devout contemplative, al though there exists a rational limit beyond which the satisfactibility of the text defeats its purpose, i.e., when the sacramental devours the subject and object of the relation it was to mediate, so the spirit may be trapped in a syllable, ," or hypnotized by an object, inkpool, or crystal. However, the most perfect aesthetic object conceivable is actually exhaustible, that is, its interests are conditioned by the limited 34 I CHICAGO REVIEW</page><page sequence="19">powers of the observer, but it is not historically exhaustible in so far as it is excellent, id est, it can always be found interesting when returned to, provided sufficient potentialities have been absorbed from the intervening natural experience. This is true even of the vision of the saint, always seen through a glass darkly. There are somatic limits to transfiguration, and, when the individual has reached them, the body, its usefulness, decay. So the death of St. Francis followed shortly upon the bestowal of the Stigmata. But the work of art exists dogged by its symbolic limitations, the coordinator rather than the end of experi ence. The only reason a work of art is more or less inimitable, likewise the only reason why one work of art differs from another, is that the artist approaches its envisagement through channels opened by partitive meanings, the expression of internal purposes peculiar to himself, the conditions of his unique determination, his "place" in the general scheme. For the spectator this uniqueness is possessed in analogy, the meaning complexus which garbs it is at best captured only in part. Also for this reason, those works created in immediacy of vision, functional transfiguration, are remarkably similar. Raphael and Mozart, the two men who have most nearly approached perfect beauty, might almost be the same person. Likewise the amount of adulteration in the "School of Athens" or the Jupiter Symphony is at a minimum which the theorist would, were it not for this evidence, declare impossible. So the artist imitates the work of God, the philosopher strives to submit it to discourse, to make it apprehensible to ratiocination. The philosopher exhibits the working as exemplary procedure, the artist the work as exemplary fact. Ends exist for one as incentives for method, method for the other as the garment of achievement. Aestheticians, attributing unwarranted concreteness to the dis coveries of analysis, have been prone to consider these activities as largely incompatible, if not in the same person, at least in the same work. This is a mistake provocative of the greatest confusion, and too much cannot be said against it. In the given work one or the other aspect may predominate, but the greatest art results from their perfect fusion. We have witnessed a long war on meaning and sense in the arts recently, and that war has ended in if not the complete triumph of the reason, at least the utter rout of its enemies. The attempt to create REXROTH TO ZUKOFSKY 35</page><page sequence="20">self-sufficient microcosms, framed out of the world, leads to a denial of all that can be called specifically human, to the disappearance of values from the world altogether. So man, incapable of the oblivion of the mollusk in life, can satisfy his ambitions for absolute creation only in suicide. Thus it becomes apparent how radical is my disagreement with your essays in Poetry and Symposium. Perhaps it will elucidate our dif ferences still further to take up some of your points more specifically. Thus in your use of the words "objectively perfect," you seem to lose sight of the fact that objectivity is essentially terminal, that it implies a subject and a relation between subject and object. Purely as such, all objects are "perfect." If by perfection one understands independence, the object evaporates. History and contemporaneity are conditions of existence, they can hardly be avoided, but their conscious pursuit leads dangerously near to a desire for superficial up-to-dateness. Experience is not valuable because it is new, it is valuable when it is intense and inclusive. As defined, your criteria, sincerity and objectification, are from my stand point hopelessly inadequate. By reducing the poetic utterance to a complex of Gestalten you confound the mind with a camera, or at the most suffer meaning only in the mind and purpose, intention, only in memory. Of course you use the word meaning, but since mean ing is for you circular, enclosed in the stasis of "perfect rest, complete appreciation," it seems to me to be largely a matter of neural arcs, or at best chemical and physical changes in the soma, id est: "emotions." I would say "perfect activity," for, for me, satisfaction is centrifugal rather than centripetal. The mind, satisfied, gestates, the body only devours insatiably. It is for this reason that any attempt to find termini for value in the irrational is doomed to failure, for the irrational only discovers that the rational may transfigure. The final value of the soma is only death. If by the "totality of perfect rest" you mean structural cohesion, you are guilty of an anthropomorphic fallacy. The contingent organism is incurably transitive, to demand of it the same type of completeness revealed in self-consciousness is to attempt to permit the observer identification with the observed as it is for itself. Only God is thus "inside" things. With your more purely literary criticism I have no quarrel. 36 CHICAGO REVIEW</page><page sequence="21">Your (implied) rather Comtean objection to the generality of my letters embarrasses me: "Anyway, in these sentences, facts." I have been trying in this letter to offer some justification for the activities of the theorist, and for the place of theoria in life. One does not write or think or say "facts" in that sense. Reason is itself a fact, but it does not function "factually," dialectic is not "things" but interpretations. You mention kinship with Spinoza. Surely he was a theorist; the moderate rationalist, scholastic, or other might well call him a theorist run amok. In the face of your accusation of "predatory instincts," the gratuitous imposition of myth in philosophy, your Spinozism rather puzzles me. Spinoza stands historically between Malebranche and Leibniz, both thinkers with whom I am greatly in sympathy, but for me he hardly represents a philosophic mediation between them. The philosopher must consider first how, secondly why, things happen. Adequacy in a philosophy is to be judged by its success in answering both these questions and in revealing them as aspects of the fundamental fact, the real world. As Whitehead says, "one task of metaphysics is the exhibition of final and efficient causes in their proper relation to each other." In the Spinozistic universe there is no particular reason why anything should happen at all. Malebranche suspended the world on its final cause like a fish on a line (vide Ruysbroek and St. Catherine, the vision of the "fish hook of God"); in itself, though quite true, an insufficient description. An overemphasis of the scholastic doctrine of "concurrence." By destroying the real communion of creatures, he made it possible to reduce the universe to a single Infinite Subject and a single finite object. Thence it was easy, in obedience to Occam's Razor, "enfia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatemi to coil up the fish line. In the hands of Spinoza the dichotomy collapsed into the One Self Subsistent. Ultimately he was led, as are all monists, to the denial of all objective reality, and, what is more important, of all possibility of value. That Spinoza was consistently true to the demands of his metaphysic, is, considering its nature, too much to expect. By ignor ing the restrictions of his first principles he was able to do a certain amount of botanizing in the hedgerows of philosophy, and said much that was valuable and profound. But from his own point of view his conduct was immoral. His duty in life was by definition, to escape from the turmoils of delusion to the perfect silence and inactivity of "the peace which passeth understanding." Surely you must realize that this REXROTH TO ZUKOFSKY 37</page><page sequence="22">is myth-making par excellence. The tendency to myth is the tendency to sacrifice adequacy for simplicity, the facts for the interpretation, until, if myth be adopted as the true philosophic procedure, one is left at last with the absolute, transcendent, and incomprehensible Interpretation, the eye of the ultimate vacuum. Granted that this is the great temptation of philosophy, granted that it is the fault of materialism ancient and modern, of neutral pluralism, idealism, of all unrestrained monisms and absolute pluralisms, granted that no philosophy, however adequate, cannot be steam-rollered into monism by the ruthless spectator, I yet fail to see how this condemns that long line of philosophic achievement, the creation of men who resolutely "faced the facts" in the face of the most seductive temptations to solve the problem by ignoring it, and who, even when thus tempted and fallen, yet gave much that is of inestimable value, who as it were faced the facts in spite of the myth. Then too, there have been periods in the history of thought when reality, seen through the lens of myth, though seen distortedly, revealed much that had escaped observers equipped with less ingenious optical devices. ("Solve the problem by ignoring it", this by the way is the essence of the "Three Temptations of Christ") As for Lenin, I dont know. The moral qualities which make a man an historical figure seem to me little deserving of admiration. When mankind acts in mass it acts at its lowest level, and the leaders of such action are but the foci of its most insignificant aspirations. That the good of the mass is an essential good I am hardly so foolish as to deny, that it is ever the highest good, or ever can be, I do not believe. He who seeks an ethic in the pages of history is doomed to disappointment and skepticism. In history, unless we are prepared to sacrifice our integrity, the means lie beyond our control, they may or may not be justified by ends, but those ends are individual values, and those means may be, usually are, morally repugnant in the extreme. So Lenin seems to me to be little else than a clear-minded demagogue. If he ever had the capacity for appreciating Bach it was completely atrophied. In fact, he rather resented the activity of the artist, unless in the specific instance it could be made to serve his own ends. Since art is essentially concerned with ends which lie far beyond those of the CEC, and can be brought to subserve them exclusively only at the expense of its existence, his resentment was only natural. (Don t imag 38 I CHICAGO REVIEW</page><page sequence="23">ine I am so silly as to be talking about the old Art versus Propaganda nonsense, much of the greatest art of the world is propaganda, but it is propaganda only incidentally). That Lenin ever saw much beyond these limited horizons I doubt, he was a marvelously efficient means, and these limitations were the condition of his efficiency. Thus his critics who call him a monomaniac were in a measure right. I admire Lenin for what he was but I do not confuse him with M. Val?ry s Leon ardo. Likewise that his myth should be the means to the perpetuation of the revolution I accept, but I do not accept the myth. Also, since I have no faith in the infallibly good intentions of the cec I rather fear that the myth may at any time be used to cloak activities most unleninistic. I cannot say that I altogether trust Comrade Stalin. Not that I have any sympathies with his various "oppositions." My "united front" does not pretend the difficulties that you imagine. Communism has nothing to do with Marx's half-baked materialist-hegelian hash. I believe in the desirability of communism because I believe in desirability, not because I believe in any of the weird heresies of the 19th century. My notion of the interdepen dence of creatures and their dependence on God might even, by the Spinozist, be said to resemble Spinozas. The rise of capitalism and its mistress protestantism began by attacking that communion, and finally in the 19th century, and after, led to a rampant individualism, a competitive morality which runs a very good chance of wrecking the species altogether. I don t believe that we can return to medieval economy because of the enormous increase in population and the fundamental change in the methods of production, and I believe that Guild Socialists, etc., are but the dupes of capitalism, castrated and harmless. That the means of production should be controlled by the producers seems to me logical and self-evident. And though I might interpret "workers" somewhat more widely than most ortho dox communists, I recognize that, since all other classes are largely prostituted to capitalism, the proletariat are the natural agents of the revolution. They have nothing tangible to gain, I starve under capi talism, and I would starve under a dictatorship of the proletariat for the same reasons. After all I am interested in perpetual revolution in a sense other than Trotsky's?the constant raising into relevance of ignored values. Poetry has for its mission in society the reduction of what the Society of Jesus named "invincible ignorance," and the true REXROTH TO ZUKOFSKY 39</page><page sequence="24">poet is as much to be feared by the proletariat as by the bourgeoisie. I have however much to gain morally, freedom from the horror of a competitive society. I am a communist for the quite irrelevant and unmarxian reason that I think the life of mankind would be happier and richer under an achieved communism. Since I believe the Church to be a supernatural institution, I do not fear that Bolshevism will win its "war with God." One might say the church in ussr deserves what it is getting. Its agelong record of consistent simony is appalling. That St. Basil, St. John Damascene, St. Chrysostom, etc., will ever be forgotten in Russia I doubt, but I sincerely hope that people like Rasputin will. Christianity is not "an ideal after the revolution" with me. I am NOT a neocatholic. I am not interested in Christ because I think him a handy symbol for Culture or The Greek Tradition or Aristocracy or Philosophia Perennis or anything whatever except that he is the incarnate Son of God. My objection to the neocatholics and scholastics is that they seem to have forgotten what the Christian religion is about. I don t give a hoot in hell if man is an Aristotelian and I seriously doubt if God does either. Faithfully, Kenneth 40 CHICAGO REVIEW</page></plain_text>
