<plain_text><page sequence="1">BASIC THEMES AND MOTIVES IN VESAAS' EARLIEST WRITING Kenneth Chapman University of California, Los Angeles I den blanke 2O-ârs-alderen er det noken kvar som skriv dikt. Dâ har ein sa merkeleg lett for â trive til det. Ein synest at ein ber eit reint blad i seg, og pâ det skal det skrivast dikt. Der kjem utan vidare dikt pâ det bladet - av glede, eller av saknad og radl0yse. Og sä er det altfor freistände â skrive det med blyant pâ papir ogsâ, og I0yne det godt bort. Eller kanskje la det sjâ dagens ljos i eit snilt lokalblad.1 gently self-ironizing words tell much about the conditions under which Tarjei Vesaas started writing, and also about his attitude toward his early writing. The local newspapers were indeed kindly toward him, but he very soon began publishing stories and poems in national magazines and newspapers in the larger cities. The general nature of his early writing is well, though perhaps a bit too harshly, described, in his own judgment of his second published novel, Huskuld the Herald {Sendemann Huskuld, 1924): "sa roman tisk at ho er uleseleg."2 This novel, and most of Vesaas' early writing, is most certainly romantic, at times even sentimental, but if one first accepts its romantic nature, there is a great deal of readable material to be found in it. Nor do we have to search long to find the sources of this romantic approach. About a volume of prose poems which was perhaps fortu- nately rejected for publication in 1922, Vesaas has written that they were "stutte prosadikt, slik som den store Tagore borte i India gjorde dei, og med vendingar som avguden Knut Hamsun brukte, og med romantikk som hos avgudinna Selma Lagerlöf."3 As it turned out, other more lasting and benevolent literary influences were at work on Vesaas during these years, but some time had to pass before the heavy overlay of romanticism was worn thin enough for them to show through clearly luPoesi - og tronge tider.

Tagore's influence on the budding writer can be traced to the translations from English of several of Tagore's books made by his teacher at Voss Folk High School, Lars Eskeland. Vesaas writes enthusiastically of both Eskeland as a teacher and of the Tagore trans- lations on which he was working during Vesaas' year at Voss. A detailed comparison of these translations with Vesaas' early prose poems would make a highly interesting, and certainly productive, study. He writes just as enthusiastically about Selma Lagerlöf, especially of Gösta Berlings saga, one of the most unabashedly romantic novels in Scan- dinavian literature. At this stage in Vesaas' development it was cer- tainly Knut Hamsun's early neo-r ornan tic novels (especially Pan and Victoria) which had the greatest influence on his style. In addition to its heavy overlay of romanticism, Vesaas' earliest writing is characterized by frequent, often rapturous and even senti- mental, expressions of religious belief reflecting traditional Christian attitudes. Typical of these expressions are such passages as these from The Farm at Grinde (Grindegard) (1925): "Gud vere med kvar litem heim inni skogen" (p.7) ; and aog eit made bed urn aa faa sovne i det dyre Kristi navn" (p. 136); from Huskuld the Herald: Gud vere med all dyr i skogen (p.72); from Children of Man {Menneskebonn, 1923): "den milde Krist, som med blodet sitt kj0pte liv og helse for alle" (p.23). The title of the play The Dwelling Places of God (Guds bustader, 1925) is a quotation from Revelations 21, and the content is accordingly religious. This tendency toward religious sentimentality in Vesaas' early writing is closely connected with its overall romantic flavor, and can undoubtedly be at least partially ascribed to the same literary sources, but in addition there were probably some environmental influences at work on Vesaas from the strongly pietistic attitudes common at the beginning of the twentieth century in Norwegian rural communities, of which the township of Vinje is quite typical.4 As in the case of ro- mantic influences, these influences from traditional religious attitudes were not lasting, and the excesses which they led to soon disappeared from his writing. Closely related to the romantic and religious strands in Vesaas' 4 Cf. Ragnvald Skrede, Tarjei Vesaas (Oslo, 1947), p. 18; "Om skrivaren," p. 13.</page><page sequence="3">128 Scandinavian Studies early novels, plays, and poetry is his highly unrealistic attitude toward women. There is an ethereal, madonna-like glow about most of these early Vesaas women. Liv Myrejard in Children of Man is even referred to as "Madonna" by the two men who love her. Lis in Evening at Grinde (Grindekveld) (1926) is time and time again referred to as Toremun's "good angel" (den gode engelen hans), and the novel is subtitled The Good Angel. It is parenthetically interesting to note that she is also twice referred to as being his good fetch, tales of fetches being widespread in Norwegian folklore and having their origin in Scandinavian mythology, a fact which only serves to add to the reader's confusion about the function of the religious beliefs expressed in these books. Only Tuve in The Dwelling Places of God, who bears the child of one brother while married to the other, shows any tendency to behave in a non-angelic fashion, but even her behavior and its consequences serve primarily as a vehicle for moralizing on the part of the author. In this respect, too, Vesaas showed rapid changes in attitude, and in his later books, although women are still looked upon as a primary source of all that is good (because of their close connection with the creative processes of birth and regeneration), his early uncritical, ro- mantic portraits of women give way to more rounded, realistic ones. The basic themes of these earliest works are also derived from tra- ditional Christian attitudes: the will to sacrifice oneself for others and the will to do penance. As examples of these attitudes we can take Liv Myrejard in Children of Man and Toremun in The Farm at Grinde and Evening at Grinde. Liv is loved by two men. One of them is Knut Heddejor, the novel's main character, whose mother died while giving birth to Knut. The circumstances under which he was born hekk yver han som ei I0ynleg skuldbyrd. Det kjendest slik for han aa vera kj0pt so dyrt. Og han samla liksom upp i seg det fagre han saag og h0yrde, vov det saman i rare draumar, laga eit morsminne av det, eit bilaete so uendeleg fint og veikt (p. 24). Knut meets Liv under dramatic circumstances: he is lost in the mountains at night in the wintertime and would have died if he had not come across the bloody tracks of another man in the snow. He follows the tracks and comes to a house. The other man, Liv's brother, is dying, and Liv's beautiful, pale face and large, sad eyes make a deep impression on him: "Han saag paa detta d0dsbleike anlet som paa eit</page><page sequence="4">Vesaas' Earliest Writing 129 syn" (p. 55). Knut later tells Liv how he imagines his mother to have been: "Slik som du maa ho ha vore, ja det trur eg, det er som ho ikkje hadde slokna . . . Kanskje hev anden henner teke ham i deg, for aa faa koma attende til sonen sin" (p. 84). He tells Liv that he could not have survived the tribulations of life if he had not met her. Liv is fond of Knut, but really loves another man, Torstein, who also loves her. But Liv feels she must sacrifice her love for Knut's sake. Torstein is puzzled by her attitude toward him, but when he discovers the reason for it, he is happy: Forlat meg Liv Liv at eg tenkte beiskt urn deg i dag ! Eg visste ikkje - aa Herregud nei - aa lat henne faa ei av stj0nnune dine, ei stor og stille stj0nne som kann koma inn til henne, og gjera godt til henne inntil alting brest! For han visste det: Ho gjer det for aa berge han [Knut] ! for aa skaffe fred til han! . . . Ingen ting var vondt lenger (pp. 84-85). Liv's sacrifice makes not only Knut, but also Torstein, happy. Later, after she has died in a blizzard, Knut and Torstein join company and go to Heddejor, where Knut had been reared by his grandfather. Knut, who is a blacksmith, and Torstein then make a large wrought iron cross and carry it on their backs the many miles to Myrejard, to raise it in memory of Liv - and thus find deliverance from all their sorrows and pain. In The Farm at Grinde Toremun, the central character of both the Grinde novels, throws an innocent lamb ( ! ) into the rushing outlet of a mountain pond. He does this in a fit of depression and anxiety, though imagining that he is doing it for the sake of Brit, a girl he has grown up together with and with whom he is falling in love. He is then over- whelmed by remorse and longs to make good his misdeed. He goes into the mountains, looking for lost lambs to save, longing to "taka lambet paa oksli og bera og gjera bot" (p. 155). He spends the summer thus. "Daa han endeleg vende heimyver ... so gjekk han og var den som hev funne tr0yst og hjelp, hev vunne, um enn kviden kann koma attende" (p. 159). And the "agony" does come back. In the final section of The Farm at Grinde, Toremun accidentally kills Brit during a trip across the mountains in a blizzard, and once more he is obsessed with the desire to do penance, although he is totally innocent of any misdeed : "Aa men lide lide, det er det eg maa heretter . . ." (p. 203). Evening at Grinde opens with Toremun in jail, doing penance for a crime he did not commit, and even after it has become quite clear to</page><page sequence="5">130 Scandinavian Studies the authorities that he is innocent (from hearing his feverish babbling when he lies ill in the prison infirmary), he still refuses to admit his innocence and leave. The infirmary nurse, Lis, also tries to persuade him of his innocence, but in vain. She is falling in love with him, and leaves her job when she sees it is possible to convince him. The rest of the novel tells of Toremun's decision to leave the prison and return to Grinde, and of the struggle in his mind between remaining true to the memory of Brit and giving in to his awakening love for Lis, his "good angel," who has devoted her life to trying to win him back to life. The book ends melodramatically, with Toremun being killed when he pro- tects Lis from injury by a blasting charge, without Toremun's conflict really becoming resolved. As in Children of Man, the central themes of the Grinde novels are sacrifice and penance, expressed in traditional Christian terms. Another theme, related to these, is common in all the early Vesaas works: that of a better time to come. It is expressed concisely in a speech from the play The Dwelling Places of God: Men av alt slikt saart kjem lengten, me lengtar og sp0r etter ei betre tid, denne jordi er liksom lengteheimen, alt som lever synest lengt. Og vil me denna betre tid, daa Guds bustad er hjaa kvart menneske, so maa me sjaa dit fram medan me ferdast (p. 69). These earliest plays and novels cannot be said to have been success- ful, despite occasional well-written nature descriptions and a few passages here and there which reveal true poetic talent. The religious themes which they contain, and the characters in terms of which they are pre- sented, are in general treated much too superficially to be either inter- esting or enlightening. The characters are for the most part figures rather than living people, and the religious and romantic clichés which are frequently used to describe their situations frustrate any attempt on the part of the reader to understand them and their plight. What makes these books interesting, and the reason for discussing them in such de- tail, is that their central themes, however unconvincingly presented here, serve as a background for an understanding of the resolution of modern ethical conflicts which Vesaas arrives at in his later works. There are certain aspects of these early works, however, which are interesting in themselves, and which also shed light on the development of his later style. One of the most characteristic features of Vesaas' writing is his tendency to assign unexpected qualities to objects and</page><page sequence="6">Vesaas' Earliest Writing 131 things in the world. An example of this in his later writing is The Shriek in the short story "Three Quiet Men" ("Tre stille menn") ( 1959) , which has the qualities of both living things and fire. But this repre- sents the end stage of a long development which appears to have had its origin in somewhat romantic and anthropomorphic descriptions of nature, for which Vesaas' most immediate model was probably similar descriptions in the novels of the nineteenth-century writer Bj0rnstjerne Bj0rnson. The first chapter of Bj0rnson's novel Arne (1859) is the classic example of this style in Norwegian literature ("Enn om vi kledde fjellet, sa eneren"). A reading of the first paragraph of Vesaas' first published novel, Children of Man, shows that he has made skillful use of his model: Urn ikkje Kjellborgaasen er eit f jell, so er han daa snaud og verhard. Lyngtufsar og kreklebj0rk lever li vet sitt der. Eit einsam t liv. Av og til kann ein rjupeflokk koma slengjande. Kvit og kj0leg urn vinteren, farga og varm um sumaren. Vitjingi er stutt, dei kjem og gjeng, ei skarring og so er det ikkje meir. Kreklebj0rki stend att, ser langt etter den siglande skare, faer tokken av eit liv som er Ijost og romt, eit varkrare liv, men eit utenkjeleg for den som er k0yrd i myr med lange r0ter. Og kreklebj0rki kryp saman, slaer seg ut paa breidda, ein og arman busken t0ygjer seg utyver torva og speglar den kronglutte kroppen sin i Kjellborgtj0nn (p. 5). Besides the personification of inanimate objects evident in this passage, it is interesting also for the presence, in embryonic form, of another important feature of style characteristic of Vesaas' writing: short, elliptical sentences alternating with clusters of sentences strung together without a break. The personification of inanimate objects can serve other purposes than that of mere description in Vesaas' early writing. Another pas- sage in Children of Man illustrates this: So still som skogen kann stände etter sn0fall. Kvart tre og buske ber si kvite byrd, ja dei minste buskane, dei veikaste greinene, alle hev dei sin part aa bera, og dei stend so stille so stille, liksom raedde for aa misse det minste av det dei er sette til aa ta vare paa (p. 101). This passage appears at the beginning of the chapter in which Knut and Torstein leave for Heddejor after the death of Liv in the blizzard. The description of the snow as a burden each branch must bear serves in its context to symbolize the burden Knut and Torstein must bear because of Liv's death, and which is further symbolized by the iron cross which they later bear on their backs. Vesaas' use of</page><page sequence="7">132 Scandinavian Studies objects in nature as symbols in his early works is also illustrated by the image of the mountain in Children of Man. It occurs first when Knut has left Heddejor after saving the life of a girl whom he loved, but who loved another. He feels he must leave the village, and sets out: "Fjellet stod bakum, det var h0gt og kvitt og kaldt, men tindetoppen bora seg inn i skyine, og vart burte der" (p. 38). After Torstein has found out that Liv Myrejard wishes to remain faithful to Knut he leaves Myrejard, where he has been working as a hired hand, and moves to his old home, a little farm beneath the moun- tain peak. This chapter is entitled "Beneath the Peak" ("Under tinden") and opens: Tinden er det som rekk y ver alt og alt. Han er det fyrste soli gyller, og det siste ho fargar naa ho gjeng kveldraud ned. Han stangar himlen med sin stolte nakke, og han kl0yver nordljoset naar det kjem sigande med uversbod (p. 87). When Knut's resolution to keep his relationship to Liv pure falters, he seeks inspiration in the sight of the mountain peak: Men daa var det liksom tinden vaks framfor auga hans, h0g og skarpt skoren, skirare enn noken annen ting. Og framfor denna stolte spir totte han at han, som var eit menneske, ikkje vilde vera den mindre mann, han slengde det mot tinden som i härme: - Aldri aldri skal du sjaa meg gjeva etter der! (pp. 90-91). The mountain peak is used in both these cases to represent the strict ethical demands that Knut and Torstein make on themselves once they have decided to sacrifice their own interests. The image returns in the final sentence of the book, as Knut and Torstein carry their cross across the last stretch of heath to Myrejard: "Ute i synsrandi steig fram ein tinde, h0g og skarpt skoren." Both Knut and Torstein have been able to live up to the ethical demands they have made on them- selves. The use of the mountain peak in this way is a bit romantic within the context of the book as a whole, but it is effective. Harald Naess, thinking of how Vesaas has frequently titled later novels on the basis of their central symbol, has suggested that the novel could very well have been titled The Peak (Tinden),5 and he is certainly right in this. The mountain peak in Children of Man is not as successful a central image as those in Vesaas' later novels, but it is an early example 5 Harald Naess, Et forspk over Vesaas1 prosastil. Edda (1962), p. 160.</page><page sequence="8">Ves aas' Earliest Writing 133 of a technique that was to play an increasingly important role in his writing. Vesaas frequently describes the contact that can exist between man and animals. For him the animal standing in the closest positive rela- tionship to man is the horse, and this motive appears frequently in his books. It appears first, as do so many of his basic motives, in Children of Man. When Liv's brother lies dying, he imagines that death is waiting for him in the darkness outside. Knut feels called on to go out in his stead. His will to sacrifice himself in this way is, however, frustrated when he steps outside and allows himself to be panicked by the screeching of an owl. He flees into the barn, and finds himself in the stable: Han trivia framfor seg med kalde dirrande hendar, der st0ytte han mot noko, det var ei varm fast hestelend. Og det str0ymde med eitt som ein tung tryggleik paa han, han la baae hendane burtpaa, det var ei saele. Hesten kom med snuten, forundra. Knut Heddejor kraup lenger inn i benken, naerare og tettare inn til denna varme levande skapningen. Dynni stod uppe, eit op ut mot natti og det som venta der, jaha, men her var han trygg. Hesten tok til aa ruske i krubba, fann vel nokre straa, han togg dei med god trygge knurp. Knut Heddejor totte det stod som eit gjerde imot alt faelt og vondt (pp. S7-58). In Vesaas7 second novel, Huskuld the Herald, Huskuld stands in a close relationship to the birds living in the woods which surround his tiny farm. He has no company except the birds he keeps alive in the wintertime with the grain he grows on his tiny plot of land: Spurven og meisen ha honom mykje kjaer. Dessa saele ting! Dei kunde svive som dei vilde millom himmel og jord, trong ikkje saa og hauste, det sytte den gode far for: Huskuld i Faltinbu, det var hans lut i livet (p. 7). As can be seen from this quotation, both the sentimental and reli- gious strains in Vesaas' early writing are prominent in Huskuld the Herald. But there is also much more there; in many ways it is one of the best books he has written, and by far the best of his early works. Huskuld's lonely life is broken when a gypsy woman and her little son, Ingebj0nn, come to Faltinbu, hungry and cold. He feeds them and lets them stay the night. In the night the mother runs away, leaving her child with Huskuld. They grow very fond of each other, and when</page><page sequence="9">134 Scandinavian Studies the mother returns for her child in the spring, Huskuld is heartbroken. He sets out to find another child to care for, but it must be one which would have nothing to lose by coming to live with him. He meets many people and sees many children, but none who would not be better off as they are. Discouraged, he is about to return home, when he finds out where Ingebj0nn is. But during his travels he has also met a couple who have lost their only son. He realizes Ingebj0nn will be better off with them, and allows them to take him into their home. He returns home alone. Shortly afterwards, an unexpected and premature frost comes. In order to protect the grain for his beloved birds he covers it with all his blankets and even the clothes off his body. He saves much of the grain, but becomes ill and dies. This is the first of several novels centering around journeys which Vesaas has written. The travellers in these novels receive many im- pressions of life during their journeys, and the effect of these impres- sions on them reveals itself in strange visions and dreams which they have. Soon after Huskuld has come home he wanders aimlessly through the forest after a rainstorm. He comes to a rocky knoll projecting above the forest, and climbs it: Og daa han kom upp, kva var det daa? var det at all heimen hadde skylt seg i lyn og regn, eller kva var det for ein merkeleg klaare! Var det Huskuld, at han ikkje var den same? men det var liksom klaarberg sj0lv han stod paa. Dessa fjelli som jamt raama bilaetet so rundeleg inn - idag flaut dei ut og var til aa sjaa igjenom, laag berre som eit lett him so alt der bak var berrt, det var ein klaare so underleg etter som hindune for augo hans fall (p. 218). What Huskuld sees is that there is a better time coming for the people of the earth, and that they must keep faith and look forward to it, passing the faith on from generation to generation. He hopes that this means that perhaps "Ingebj0nn kom til aa bli med i noko, noko han ikkje kunde vita, men berre hadde kjent der paa klaarberg idag" (p. 221). That same night Huskuld sleeps and dreams that all human troubles "are smoke and shall be no more." (. . . er r0yk og skal ikkje vera til.) This seems to be another reference to Revelations 21, from which also the title of the play The Dwelling Places of God is taken. When, at the very end of the novel one of Huskuld's neighbors, who has heard that Huskuld has found out something important about life during his</page><page sequence="10">Vesaas' Earliest Writing 135 travels, comes to him and pleads, with him to tell him why life is so difficult, Huskuld repeats these words in his delirium: Det er r0yk, sa han, og skal ikkje vera til. (Naboen) kasta seg framstupes yver lega og skulde vel liksom hindre Huskuld i aa reise fraa. Lat det vera, kring Huskuld vart alt so uendeleg lett, og noko kalla paa han og han gjekk burtyver og kom til ein heim som han kjende fraa fyrr. Ei kvinne kom ut der, han kjende henne, aa ja, ho var ljos og h0g som alt paa denna staden, og ho let upp d0rene og bad han tr0 fyre inn (p. 252). That the ending of this novel is reminiscent of the ending of Peer Gynt is not surprising. Ibsen's plays, and Peer Gynt in particular, have always occupied a special place in Vesaas' attention,6 and this is only one of many places in Vesaas' writing where echoes of Ibsen's works can be detected. At this point in his career Vesaas was most influenced by the romantic aspects of Ibsen's writing, but Ibsen's influence was to appear at deeper levels in later Vesaas books.7 Romantic as it is, Huskuld the Herald has one thing in its favor that lifts it above his other novels from the 192O's: the figure of Huskuld himself. As unrealis- tically as he and his environment are portrayed at times, he is com- pletely believable as a human being, and the reader can hardly help but be charmed by his naivete and sincerity. Despite the overall weaknesses of these early works, and the basic similarity of their religious themes and romantic styles, some develop- ment can be seen in them. A good example of this is the development which starts to take place in descriptions dealing with the clearing of land. When this motive first appears in Vesaas' writing, it does so in a highly sentimental form. In his early prize-winning prose poem, "To My Sun-Maiden" (1921) (Til mi Solm0y)8 he gives vent to a series of rapturous feelings while describing his vision of life with an imagined sweetheart: Gard vil eg rydja, i mold vil eg grava - me er i pakt med jordi, ho er vaar mor, ho signar sine s0ner. . . . Sjaa aakeren, - sjaa no er han mögen, no er körnet gult! Aa mögen aaker! Aa gult körn! Det er underet lat vaar kjaerleik festna til eit tuntree med r0ter djupt i heim og gard (p. 57). In a prose poetic sketch entitled "Flowers of the Earth" ("Blomar 6 Cf. "Om skrivaren," p. 15-17. 7 Cf. Naess, loc. cit., pp. 167-168. 8Joleh0gtid (Oslo, 1921), pp. 11-12.</page><page sequence="11">136 Scandinavian Studies yver land") published the following year he talks about "nybrotet, som rann upp daa vilje m0tte kjaerleik - det er vel blomen millom blomar yver land."9 And in this sketch, too, he talks about the young couple planting a tree in the yard (eit tuntre). This short sketch reappears two years later in a slightly altered form in Huskuld the Herald, but one which leaves the romantic attitude toward the clearing of land in- tact. In The Farm at Grinde, however, published the following year, a new and deeper perspective is added. Grinde is a deserted farm when Toremun's parents come to work it, and they must first clear a field. In the beginning everything is still idyllic: Han stod der b0ygd mot jordi og grov og braut og velte saman steinr0ysar, han sveitta, men han var so ung og han künde stände smile med ryggen verkte og soli steikte og steinane var fortunge (p. 9). Even the pile of stones is sentimentalized: Dei totte dei laut halde av henne etter alt slite t ho hadde kosta. Dei peika paa den og den steinen og kjende liksom att kvar einskild - sjaa den! minnest du han? ja og den daa visst kjem eg so ihug (pp. 10-11). A child is born to the couple, and the struggle becomes more serious : Aakeren auka seg, og steinr0ysane auka, dei var store tagalle minnesmerke, men dei sette ogso merke paa han som bygde dei (p. 13). The child dies, however, and a change takes place within the father. Clearing land is no longer the game it was: og mannen tok til brjote jord i eislags 0rske, det galdt aa d0yve det som vilde slaa han ned, slaa att etter noko, det var som jordi titra lite av redsle for han, der han grov med j0nn og makt (p. 14). In Evening at Grinde, after Toremun, the couple's second child, returns to Grinde after finally leaving jail, he, too, begins clearing land as if obsessed: Sonen treiv berre spaden i 0rvaene, slo laus med svart for augo, . . . aldri hadde vel ein nybrotsmann set med slikt anlet utyver arbeidsteigen, kvi kunde ho iikje livne, den gleda som h0yrer til det arbeidet? (p. 109). We are also given a quasi-psychological explanation of Toremun's nature, tracing it back to his father's: 9 Syn og segn (Olso, 1922), pp. 283-284.</page><page sequence="12">Vesaas' Earliest Writing 137 Sonen hadde fenge blaase inn i seg so tungt og vildrande eit sinn, og sidan hadde lagnaden sett inn paa honom, tri ve honom i bringa og slengt honom til marki og gjenge sin veg utan minste forklaaring (p. 109). Toremun is the first of many characters in Vesaas' books who are at the mercy of forces over which they have no control, and against which they struggle, sometimes successfully, sometimes in vain. He shows this side of his nature first in the sequence in The Farm at Grinde in which he throws the lamb into the pond. This section of the novel is one of the most remarkable and haunting scenes Vesaas has ever de- picted, and stands out sharply in the novel, breaking as it does into the sentimental story of the childhood of Toremun and Brit. It must have amazed and puzzled many readers at the time of the novel's publication, but seen from our present viewpoint it is easy to see how it is the starting point of an interesting line of development. How difficult life is for Toremun, and how strong the forces pulling at him are, is well described: Og so b0ygde han hovudet og skyna endaa ein gong kor det er ulikt for ulike mennesker. Ein künde le med den andre var siegen av gaatur, ein künde gange her og lata det bli kveld og natt, og endaa ha eit hjarta som lo i bringa - og ein annen kjende natti slo ut som myrke blomar, og kjende kor ho drog og saug og maktstol, so ein maatte krinse kring henne, og liksom kjenne paa henne, slik ein altid lyt dragasi av det l0ynde (p. 140). He has come out into the night because he felt that he was "some- how being called" (p. 142) ("Det liksom ropar paa meg inatt."), by something that is "calling and asking if I dare." ("Det ropar og sp0r urn eg torer.") And he is fully aware of what is facing him: (p. 141) - "Inatt vil eg faa vita kven eg er." The conflict within Toremun is never clearly defined nor successfully resolved; the desire to do penance for the lamb's and Brit's death' is not deeply enough grounded psychologi- cally and the ending of the story too melodramatic for this. But the anxieties and obsessions which plague him are central human problems, and even though Vesaas was not able to present them convincingly at this early stage of his career, it is clear that the romantic attitudes toward life which characterize his early writing were already beginning to undergo a transformation.</page></plain_text>
