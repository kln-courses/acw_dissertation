<plain_text><page sequence="1">137 Pinter and Chekhov: The Bond of Naturalism JOHN LAHR We begin with the idea that nature is all we need; it is necessary to accept her as she is, without modifying her or diminishing her in any respect; she is sufficiently beautiful and great to provide a beginning, a middle, and an end. Instead of imagining an adven- ture, complicating it, and arranging a series of theatrical effects to lead to a final con- clusion, we simply take from life the story of a being or a group of beings whose acts we faithfully set down. The work becomes an official record, nothing more; its only merit is that of exact observation, of the more or less profound penetration of analy- sis, of the logical concatenation of facts ... "On Naturalism in the Theatre," Emile Zola (1880) Naturalism has its roots in a scientific approach which melds man inextricably to his environment, studying him as a complex amalgam of audible rhythms and spec- tacular mutations for survival. Chekhov, the passionate doctor, applied this discipline to the ailing conventional drama of his time. The demand is made that the hero and heroine should be dramatically effective. But in life people do not shoot themselves or hang themselves, or fall in love, or deliver themselves of clever sayings every minute. They spend most of their time eating, drinking, running after women or men, talking nonsense. It is therefore necessary that this should be shown on stage. A play ought to be written in which people should come and go, dine, talk of the weather or play cards, not because the</page><page sequence="2">author wants it but because that is what happens in real life. Life on the stage should be as it really is, and the people, too, should be as they are and not on stilts.l Although Chekhov was considerably influenced by Zola, his own poetic genius could not accept the Frenchman's dry book-keeping for the world. The same pas- sion for objectivity and clinical analysis of the human animal which gives Chekhov so much of his strength feeds the work of Harold Pinter, who uses the conventions of Naturalism to go beyond them and chart mankind's evolving sense of its own boundaries. Pinter, like Chekhov, has a scientist's distrust of simplifications. "I'm against all propaganda," he told Charles Marowitz in 1967, "Even propaganda for life." His realism refuses to offer bromidic meanings or strained coherence to palliate forces beyond our comprehension. This uncompromising aesthetic took shape even be- fore Pinter began writing plays. Commenting on the work of Samuel Beckett in a letter (1954), he said: . . I don't want philosophies, tracts, dogmas, creeds, ways out, truths, answers, nothing from the bargain basement. He [Beckett] is the most courageous, remorse- less writer going and the more he grinds my nose in the shit the more I am grateful to him. He's not fucking me about, he's not leading me up any garden, he's not slipping me any wink, he's not flogging me a remedy or a path or a revelation or a basinful of breadcrumbs, he's not selling me anything I don't want to buy, he doesn't give a bollock whether I buy or not, he hasn't got his hand over his heart. Well, I'll buy his goods, hook, line and sinker, because he leaves no stone unturned and no maggot lonely... "2 Pinter's impulse is for a supra-realism which can offer a vision of life in its am- biguous entirety, a theatrical hypothesis for an audience to entertain, in which all the facts are presented but never prejudged. Man's dimensions of consciousness, his sense of a stable position in the scheme of things, have changed in this century. Chekhov, for all his hard-headed analysis, wrote out of a pastoral tradition to which the Russian gentry had become insensitive, one whose significance had been put into question by a new urban order. The stage directions of The Cherry Orchard (1903-1904) are explicit- A road leads to Gayev's estate. On one side and some distance away is a row of dark poplars, and it is there that the cherry orchard begins. Further away is seen a line of telegraph poles and beyond them, on the horizon, the vague outlines of a large town, visible only in very good, clear weather ... Chekhov's lyricism-a counterpoint of words, gestures and sound-is always within the larger matrix of the countryside. Pinter's world on the other hand is hermeti- 1Quoted in David Magarshack, Chekhov the Dramatist, (New York: Hill &amp; Wang, 1960), p. 84. 2 Beckett at Sixty, (London: Calder &amp; Boyars, Ltd., 1967), p. 86. 3All Chekhov quotes are taken from: Chekhov Plays, translated by Elisaveta Fen, (Pen- guin Books, 1954). 138 JOHN LAHR</page><page sequence="3">PINTER AND CHEKHOV cally sealed off from nature. His plays are urban fables in which no poplars sway against the distant orchard, no wind underscores human loneliness. Man's earthly garden, like the one in The Caretaker, is cluttered with lifeless, alien objects. DAVIES. Looks a bit thick. ASTON. Overgrown. DAVIES. What's that, a pond? ASTON. Yes. DAVIES. What you got, fish? ASTON. No. There isn't anything in there. (Pause.) DAVIES. Where are you going to put your shed? ASTON, turning. I'll have to clear the garden first. DAVIES. You'd need a tractor, man. When Pinter invokes Nature, it becomes a travesty, not only of pastoral simplicity, but of all those who would seek to recollect it in tranquility. In The Birthday Party, Goldberg tries and fails to make an innocent bower of London's East End: When I was a youngster, of a Friday I used to go for a walk down the canal with a girl who lived down my road. A beautiful girl. What a voice that bird had! A nightingale, my word of honor. Good? Pure? ... We knew the meaning of respect. So I'd give her a peck and I'd bowl back home. I'd tip my hat to the toddlers, I'd give a helping hand to a couple of stray dogs, everything came natural! I can see it like yesterday. The sun falling behind the dog stadium. Ah! This blarney is sensual, precise, and vacuous. Nature has become a cynical ploy, a marginal diversion, a moment of verbal muscle-flexing which balloons it to the proportions of myth (as in Hemingway), substituting an unreal self-consciousness for Nature's inherent spontaneity. In The Seagull, the lake is at first hidden by Treplev's wooden stage, an eclipse of nature by art significant for both Chekhov and his prototype of the young author. The play within the play is the embodiment of the romantic Egotistical Sublime- a stillborn creation if there ever was one. Treplev demands an organic, natural back- ground for something coldly intellectual. This contrast is wryly humorous; but when the curtain comes up on his little play, the lake asserts an undeniable power. Chekhov's stage directions indicate the primordial calm of the background: "The curtain rises, revealing the view of the lake, with the moon above the horizon and its reflection in the water." This setting is perfect for Treplev's theme of cosmic death and rebirth. He will create a new Eden, with its animal delights and verdant profusion transposed from the external world into his own mind. Nina speaks Treplev's words against a background which reminds the audience that Nature still has something significant and sustaining to offer. The men, the lions, the eagles, the partridges, the antlered deer, the geese, the spiders, the silent fishes of the deep, starfishes and creatures unseen to the eye-in short all living things, all living things, having completed their mournful cycle, have been snuffed out. .. In me the consciousness of men is merged with the instincts 139</page><page sequence="4">JOHN LAHR of animals: I remember all, all, all, and live every single life anew in my own be- ing. (I,i) This speech is recalled by Nina in her last meeting with Treplev, stirring memories of a touching youthfulness and a talent never organized by a deeply-felt vision of the world. Treplev kills himself-the lie of romantic egotism now apparent even to him. Even if they escape ultimate destruction, the characters in Chekhov's plays tend to ossify in their rural surroundings. Vanya, the three sisters, Arkadina reflect intellec- tual capacity turned flaccid: Astrov echoes Chekhov's sentiments: I love life as such-but our life, our everyday provincial life in Russia, I just can't endure. I despise it with all my soul. As for my own life, God knows I can find nothing good in it at all. You know, when you walk through a forest on a dark night and you see a small light gleaming in the distance you don't notice your tiredness, nor the darkness, nor the prickly branches lashing you in the face... (II,i) In Chekhov's world, the blessings of nature are omnipresent, but the majority of mankind are unable to mirror the peacefulness and potential grace which surrounds them. In The Cherry Orchard, the Ranevsky family are forced from their family estate by their own class pretensions. They exit to the thud of axes cutting the or- chard, once the symbol of a luxuriant, safe world and now an accusation of their indifference to the environment which once sustained them. Even the final moments of Uncle Vanya reiterate this tension between the individual and nature. Sonia's sweet, vain longings are for an Eden whose visual correlative is outside her door. ... We shall hear the angels, we shall see all the heavens covered with stars like diamonds, we shall see all earthly evil, all of our sufferings swept away by the grace which will fill the whole world, and our life will become peaceful, gentle, sweet as a caress. I believe it, I believe it... The watchman's tapping which fills the silence after Sonia's quiet pleading is the ironic Chekhovian smile. Sonia and Vanya are trapped; they cannot participate in Nature's tranquility. The boredom which pervades the life of Chekhov's characters has a palpable weight, an atmospheric pressure indicating their gradual withdrawal from the sustaining environment. One is, after all, never bored in nature as long as one can appreciate it. Chekhov is writing, then, at the brink of a significant shift in man's attitude toward nature; his characters are both victims of its indifference and witnesses of its glory. This post-Darwinian ambivalence reverses former dramatic conventions of the pastoral. Country life in Russia does not bring the expected psychic release that Celia anticipates in As You Like It when she says, "...Now go we in content/ To liberty and not to banishment." In Illyria or Arden, chaos is charmed into order, disguise and misconception are games which can be happily played out apart from the world. Chekhov revises the idyllic image, evoking complexity from the stereo- type of pastoral security, creating a world which offers no fixed meaning, but only fading shadows of coherence. It is significant that Stanislavski, unable to capture the strong interior rhythms 140</page><page sequence="5">PINTER AND CHEKHOV of Chekhov or understand the momentum created by the counterpoint between situation and environment, wanted to clutter the plays with real things. The effect was to glut the imagination, blurring the careful delineation of objects and sounds Chekhov had indicated in his stage directions. Stanislavski's mise-en-scene for Uncle Vanya is indicative: The play starts in darkness; an August evening. The dim light of a lantern set on top of a post; distant sounds of a drunkard's song; distant howling of a dog; the croaking of frogs, the cry of a corncrake, the slow tolling of a distant church bell. All this helps the audience to get the feel of the sad and monotonous life of the characters. Flashes of lightning, faint rumblings of thunder in the distance. After the raising of the curtain a pause of ten seconds. After the pause, Yakov knocks, hammering in a nail (oi1 the stage); having knocked the nail in, he busies himself on the stage, humming a tune.' Chekhov's impressionistic technique demanded a more selectively focused trompe d'oeil effect, which tricked the audience into making thematic associations between characters and the sights and sounds surrounding them. The script reads simply: "The sun has just set. Yakov and other workmen are busy on the stage behind the lowered curtain; sounds of hammering and coughing." Chekhov's careful choice of key objects, from Treplev's stuffed seagull to Vanya's elegant cravat, created a stagecraft oriented toward delicately accentuated things -a type of theatre from which Stanislavski could generalize a theory of performing. As Eric Bentley has observed in In Search of Theatre, the Chekhovian method ...requires two extraordinary gifts: the mastery of "petty" realistic material and the ability to go beyond sheer Sachlichkeit-materiality, factuality-to imagination and thought... Now, the whole Stanislavski school of acting and directing is testimony that Chekhov was successfully sachlich-that is, not only accurate, but significantly precise, concrete, ironic. . . The art by which a special importance is imparted to everyday objects is familiar enough in fiction; on stage, Chekhov is one of its few masters. . . (p. 333) The breaking string, no matter how non-naturalistic a sound, has a human focus and pertinence; the shimmering lake (The Seagull), the orchard flecked with May morn- ing frost (The Cherry Orchard) still uphold man as the measure of his environ- ment, implying a kind of proportion to reality which lends humanity to objects clearly non-human. In contrast, the object world in Pinter is never so certain; it offers no sounds of general discord and comment-like the breaking string. Nature here allows no solace; the objects crowd with total indifference around Pinter's characters like the chest of drawers in Aston's room. His characters represent a mod- ern consciousness wholly abstracted from its environment. The language, precise and sensual, tantalizes our sense of the real, only to disappear into the dynamics of the momentary situation. Max recalls a present to his wife in The Homecoming: ... I said to her, Jessie, I think our ship is going to come home, I'm going to treat you to a couple of items, I'm going to buy you a dress in pale corded blue silk heavily encrusted in pearls, and for casual wear, a pair of pantaloons in lilac taffeta. Then, I gave her a drop of cherry brandy. Language, however, cannot isolate the past, and neither can memory. Chekhov 'David Magarshack, Stanislavsky: a Life, (Chaunticleer Press, 1937), p. 172. 141</page><page sequence="6">hints at this in The Three Sisters. Olga's first words show the limitations of the human imagination, trying to control facts which are irretrievable: "It's exactly a year ago Father died, isn't it?" The finality of the statement is mocked by the rhetorical question. In the same way, Max's childhood is never as clear as his mem- ory urges it to be. Our father? I remember him. Don't worry. You kid yourself. He used to come over to me and look down at me. My old man did. He'd bend right over me, then he'd pick me up. I was only that big. Then he'd dandle me. Give me the bottle. Wipe me clean. Give me a smile. Pat me on the bum. Pass me around, pass me from hand to hand. Toss me up in the air. Catch me coming down. I remember my father. The language seems sharply particular, but behind Max's ferocious certainty is a world of undifferentiated (perhaps false) shadows. He doesn't remember any- thing. Pinter is obsessed by the arbitrary boundaries man makes for himself: the walls constructed of concrete, of language, of philosophy, which protect him from a protean reality and give him a chance. In one of his early plays, The Dwarfs, Pinter states what he later showed: The rooms we live in... open and shut... Can't you see? They change shape at their own will. I couldn't grumble if only they would keep to some consistency. But they don't. And I can't tell the limits, the boundaries which I've been led to believe are natural... In The Birthday Party, the house which has protected Stanley is turned into a menac- ing jungle. Pinter's attempts to transform the room are crude but effective. He throws the set into darkness during a game of blind man's buff, with the pursuers' flashlights scanning the room. The solidity evaporates. Objects become massive spectres in the dark, threatening to overwhelm the company. The light shines on them, assuring us that they exist, but the objects seem less than real. The walls pro- tecting Stanley now incarcerate him, as Goldberg and McCann force a flashlight into his face until his solidity and reason vaporize. When Stanley is taken away, the room comes back to "normal," only to expand again into uncertainty with the final dialogue- MEG. I was the belle of the ball. PETEY. Were you? MEG. Oh, it's true ... I was... I know I was. It is in The Homecoming that Pinter is able to achieve his most subtle interplay of naturalistic fact and a disturbing fluid reality. Max's living room seems as logical as the human situation within it seems improbable. The stage has been stripped of ex- cess, lacking the jumbled and claustrophobic qualities of The Caretaker or the non- chalant untidiness of the seaside boarding house where The Birthday Party takes place. A mammoth arch, chairs, tables, the back wall broken through to expose a long staircase. The professor-son makes sure we, as well as his wife Ruth, realize this is a controlled environment. What do you think of the room? Big isn't it? It's a big house. I mean, it's a fine 142 JOHN LAHR</page><page sequence="7">PINTER AND CHEKHOV room, don't you think? Actually there was a wall, across there... with a door. We knocked it down...years ago ... to make an open living area. The structure wasn't affected you see ... The room seems certain to the eye, filled with a steel-gray light as solid and re- assuring as a Vermeer painting. It is immediately recognizable; the objects coax the audience into a comfortable acceptance. The audience assumes that the surround- ings describe the characters on stage. But their response is betrayed; the action un- covers elusive truths of sexual fantasy, lust, and impotence. As the play gathers momentum, the audience discovers-without Pinter forcing it-that the room has lost its apparent solidity. The stairway, covered by that monumental arch, takes on an unnatural, seductive, phallic length-an almost sexual potency. Whereas Stanislavski developed the illusionistic "fourth wall" to give The Seagull the shock of reality, Pinter pushes against naturalistic stage conventions for his theatrical surprises. Sam, Max's aging brother, passes out, proclaiming in his last breath that Max's deceased wife committed adultery in the back seat of his cab while he drove. A plot-point is wrapped up; something is explained. But The Homecoming is not a play in which the dead are carted off. The dialogue is Pinter at his best, mocking the "realistic" demands of a theatre which hides man's most in- sensitive instincts. MAX. What's he done? Dropped dead. LENNY. Yes. MAX. A corpse on my floor. Clear him out of here. JOEY bends over SAM JOEY. He's not dead. LENNY. He's probably dead, for about 30 seconds. MAX. He's not even dead. The action goes on around the body. No blackouts. No fine sentiment. People faint in subways or die, other people pass them by or give them a nudge of the boot to make sure they're still breathing. Pinter lets reality comment on itself, never point- ing a finger. In Chekhov's world, the language comments on an environment which demands answers, resolved careers. In all his plays, there are voices that speak of happiness, that yearn for a better world. Even if these goals elude them, their mode of thinking about Nature and Man remains constructively anthropomorphic: But our sufferings may mean happiness for the people who come after us... There'll be a time when peace and happiness reign in the world, and then we shall be remembered kindly and blessed ... Olga, like her sisters, waits for a sign from nature ("...Maybe if we wait a little longer we shall find out why we live, why we suffer..."). Chekhov's own skepti- cism demanded both a world-view and hope. The best [classical writers] are realists and depict life as it is, because every line is permeated, as with a juice, by a conspicuousness of an aim; you feel in addition to life as it is life as it should be ... But what about us? We depict life as it is but 143</page><page sequence="8">we refuse to go a step further. We have neither near nor remote aims and our souls are as flat and bare as a billiard table. We have no politics, we do not believe in revolution, we deny the existence of God, we are not afraid of ghosts... But he who wants nothing, hopes for nothing, and fears nothing cannot be an artist.6 Chekhov chronicles an existential stalemate, a problematic condition rather than a proposed answer. Yet there still remains the comforting solidity of possessions. Even though Lyuba Ranevsky loses her estate, the audience understands when she says, "... My dear bookcase! (Kisses bookcase). My own little table!" While sym- bols often emerge out of the dynamics of Chekhov's dramatic situations (Solyony's hands in The Three Sisters, the stuffed seagull, etc.), there is a logic in their use which, while attesting to the randomness of experience, confesses a comforting sense of artistic order. The object world of Chekhov's plays never imposes itself on the experience of the characters as much as on their imagination. In Pinter, objects and gestures take on a physical potency which illustrates a mute isolation between Man and object. Max swings his cane with a memory of sexual strength. Ruth weaves a mosaic of sensual innuendo, turning a glass of water into a throbbing organ: RUTH. Have a sip. Go on. Have a sip from my glass. He is still. Sit on my lap. Take a long cool sip. She pats her lap. Pause. She stands, moves to him with the glass. Put your head back and open your mouth. LENNY. Take that glass away from me. RUTH. Lie on the floor. Go on. I'll pour it down your throat. LENNY. What are you doing, making me some kind of proposal. Lenny has tried to overwhelm her with tales of violence and sexual conquest. Ruth, however, by turning an object into a threatening invitation, mocks our faith in the neutrality of material things. She offers, one might say, an object lesson on the limitations of Man's sensory perception. Look at me. I... move my leg. That's all it is. But I wear... underwear ... which moves with me ... it... captures your attention. Perhaps you misinterpret. The ac- tion is simple. It's a leg... moving. My lips move. Why don't you restrict... your observations to that? Perhaps the fact that they move is more significant... than the words which come through them. You must bear that...possibility... in mind. Pinter's characters no longer cling to a wistful faith in cosmic coherence. They have been permanently cut adrift from their surroundings. They do not speak of Hope or Happiness; they simply want to survive from moment to moment. Where Chekhov explored the substance of man's life eroding through time, Pinter does something else with that dimension. All of Chekhov's characters come from a definable past, and their futures, no matter how bleak, can be charted. Irena will teach; Nina will act in the provinces; Gaev will take a job as a bank clerk. The language of Chekhov's plays at their most poignant moments is heightened by the future tense, by what will be. Futurity, like the "pathetic fallacy" of seeing nature responding to man, implies a relationship to the world, a chronological order, a 5David Magarshack, Chekhov the Dramatist, (New York: Hill &amp; Wang, 1960), pp. 40-41. 144 JOHN LAHR</page><page sequence="9">PINTER AND CHEKHOV sense of the mind's evolutionary development. Pinter employs no future tenses. His language shows memory a tractable tool, deceiving with seductive clarity. Memory holds no salvation and no value. Man can only live in an anxious, pro- tracted present. All Pinter's dramatic devices (the stylized speech, the weighted silences, the care- ful groupings) encompass the dicta of Nathalie Sarraute and the "new novel" which seeks, like Pinter's stage naturalism, to adapt to a modern environment. His drama moves where the novel (for her) must also go: "... some precise dramatic action shown in slow motion... [where] time was no longer the time of real life, but of a hugely amplified present... "6 Pinter finds the language of music the easiest way to describe his own understand- ing of his plays. Like Chekhov, he orchestrates an elaborate composition of gestures, words, and pauses within the flexible unit of the room. Chekhov had already used the pause with moving dramatic and psychological insight. Lyuba and Gaev's last moment before leaving the estate is made more touching by being beyond words. If Pinter's plays seem to lack the rich tonality of Chekhov's works, it is because, in his view, Nature gives us back no image of ourselves and words, no matter how sen- suous, are finally imprecise. The actor works in a smaller, more tightly con- trolled area of improvisation. Pinter told me in 1967: I am very conscious of rhythm. It's got to happen "Snap. Snap"-just like that or it's wrong. I'm also interested in pitch... I remember when we did The Collection on Off-Broadway a few years ago, there was an American actor who was in big trouble with his part. I told him instead of trying to find reasons for his character- ization, "Why don't you read the part and pay attention to the stress of the words." He did it, and he was fine. The point is the stresses tell you what the meaning is. Saying it up or down can change the whole meaning. It has to be just right. Silence becomes a more active factor in modern life; the past has blurred and the future is unknowable. Pinter's plays exhibit a bold virtue in utilizing this silence, which Chekhov's Naturalism could only vaguely apprehend. It is a realistic device, as well as a cosmic indifference. As George Steiner has pointed out in Language and Silence: "... [when] language simply ceases, and the motion of the spirit gives no further outward manifestations of its being, the poet enters into silence. Here the word borders not on radiance or music, but on night." Pinter, like Chekhov, uncovers a subterranean music. The difference in their tech- niques reflects the difference in evolving realistic appraisals of the world. If Pinter's world seems a smaller, grayer canvas, it is not a limitation of craft, but of the mod- ern world-which leaves Man with less faith in his mind, more fearful of the de- humanizing forces outside it. 6 Gore Vidal, "French Letters", Encounter (December 1967), p. 19. 145</page></plain_text>
