<plain_text><page sequence="1">HERBERT MOLLER THE SOCIAL CAUSATION OF AFFECTIVE MYSTICISM Studies in historical causation have to cope with the nearly intract- able complexity of interlocking events. This study, however, which connects psychological phenomena with demographic con- ditions, is methodologically favored: The hypothesized chain of causation is unilinear and not unduly complicated by intervening variables; and it can be tested through a comparative examination, because the salient facts occurred repeatedly in the course of seven centuries. Affective mysticism, also referred to as Bernardine mysticism, has been prevalent chiefly in Western civilization. Whereas other types of mysticism-transcendent speculations, prophetic and millenary movements-have been ubiquitous, affective mysticism, a loving devotion to the divinity as a person, has been specifically Western. Rudolf Otto, in his book Mysticism East and West, accepted only speculative mysticism as legitimately religious. To him, the teaching of Plotinus, Master Eckhart, and certain Indian mystics represented intuitive knowledge of a transcendent reality, but he condemned affective mysticism as "excited emotionalism" and "intoxicated eroticism."1 However, in Western civilization Bernardine mysticism of love and union had an exceedingly large number of representatives up to the period of romanticism. Since affective mysticism appeared in recurrent waves from the twelfth to the eighteenth centuries, its repeated intensification and subsidence pose a problem of historical causation. Can any factors be discerned that rose and fell contemporaneously and may plausibly be related to it? If such a diachronical concurrence can be established, a causal relationship can be hypothesized and then substantiated by comparative investigations of various geographical areas.

The ideal of withdrawal from reality and of detach- ment from oneself gave way to a greater intensity of feeling, thinking, and observing. Instead of the old demand of outright suppression of emotion and desires the most outstanding theologians and moralists advocated a strong but controlled sensibility.2 One aspect of this change was a new image of Christ and a heartfelt interest in his humanity, in his suffering, and in the emotional meaning the in- dividual believer could find in them. Affective mysticism, however, went further. It grew out of the re-emergence of repressed wishes and fantasies, but distorted by re- gression to the oedipal and frequently the pre-oedipal level of de- velopment. The mystics directed their infantilized desires for love objects at the Christian triune deity and particularly at Jesus, who became the beloved of the individual mystic, albeit a strangely elusive one. The affective relationship with Jesus might be consum- mated in "spiritual marriage" or mystical union, which consisted of states of ineffable elation or voluptuous excitement. Many mystics, however, admitted that they failed to attain these "higher graces" or even remained suspended in a state of emotional aridity, the "dark night of the soul." None the less they observed with empathy the ecstatic transports of others, practiced "mystical prayer," and parti- cipated in the emotional religiosity pervading the mystical com- munities. Regressive desires became manifest in preoccupation with the Savior's blood and tears, in the craving for eating Christ's body (frequent communion), in the contemplation of his sacred heart, and similar phenomena. The eroticized deity could reveal himself as a loving father as well as a helpless infant in a creche or as a radiant youth. The divine object was experienced by some as a female figure, either as Sancta Sophia or as a feminized Christ with an open wound and helpless in his humiliation. On a still more regressive level Christ appeared as a mother figure whose breasts gave blissful satisfaction to the mystic. St. Bernard of Clairvaux (1090-1153) became the most outstanding representative of the new religious sensibility and, specifically, of affective mysticism. In his Sermons on the Canticle of Canticles he commented on the Song of Solomon with incomparably greater in- volvement than Augustine, Gregory the Great, and other earlier R. W. Southern, The Making of the Middle Ages (London, 1953). 306</page><page sequence="3">SOCIAL CAUSES OF AFFECTIVE MYSTICISM authors had done. Bernard introduced a glowing love into the con- templation of the Holy Humanity of Christ. Rupert of Deutz (ca. 1070-1135), abbot of the monastery of Deutz near Cologne, preceded Bernard by two decades. He had already presented Christ as a hand- some young man, and his most stirring visions were laden with sexual symbolism. Like St. Bernard and many later mystics of this type he was fascinated with the wounds of Christ and recurred to this subject in about thirty different passages. In fact, he excused himself for speaking so frequently of Jesus' side wound.3 William of Saint Thierry at Reims, a contemporary and friend of St. Bernard, also wrote a commentary on the Canticles in which he described the elevation of the loving soul toward God culminating in ecstatic love.4 Outstanding among those contemporaries who dwelled on the in- dividual's personal contact with God was Hugh of Saint Victor (1097-1141). He assured his readers: Truly it is your beloved that visits you. He comes to touch you ... not to fulfill your desire but to draw your love. He offers you some first-fruits of his love; he does not tender you the fullness of completed satisfaction. .. He, who one day will give himself to you to be seen and possessed for ever, now sometimes gives you a taste of himself, that you may know how sweet he is.5 Somewhat later in the same century Richard of Saint Victor (d. 1173) described ecstatic experiences. New commentaries on the Canticles, the Scriptural basis for bridal mysticism, were produced by Wolbero of Saint Pantaleon at Cologne (d. 1167), who wrote specifically for the edification of Benedictine nuns, and by Philippe de Bonne-Esperance (Philippe of Harvengt, d. 1183), who lived at Premontre, northeast of Paris, and died thirty years after St. Bernard. Gilson has listed several separate groups of theologians who developed the religious love theme at the same time, among whom Aelred de Rievaulx, Gilbert de Holland, and Isaac de l'Etoile are the best known.6 For the ecology of affective mysticism it is a fact of consequence that all of these writers lived in the circumscribed area of northern France (north of the Loire River), Belgium, northern Burgundy, and 3.

This geographical bunching was not a matter of chance. In this very area a great demand for eloquent preachers in the vernacular languages also testifies to the receptivity of a wider public for this emotionally appealing treatment of religion.7 Foremost among this receptive public were pious women in the new Orders of Premontre, Citeaux, and St. Dominic founded in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.8 Many new convents were founded in this area, but there were never enough vacancies for the large number of pious women. From this lack of nunneries9 resulted the movement of the beguines, that is religious lay women, who usually lived in small groups in urban houses, subject to clerical supervision. Cistercian convents as well as the group living of the beguines originated in the southern regions of the Low Countries in the last decade of the twelfth century.10 From there the movement spread to the Rhine region around Cologne, to Lorraine, and to northern France, where in the early thirteenth century the southern- most beguine houses were established at Orleans and Tours. In 1212, when Bishop Fulco (Foulques) of Toulouse was exiled by the Albigensians and found refuge in the diocese of Liege, he was deeply impressed by the vitality of the religious life among the beguines, because nothing like it existed in his southern French or rather Provencal homeland.1l In the thirteenth century there occurred a notable shift in the geo- graphic distribution of mysticism. In northern France, the movement receded. No Cistercian nunneries were established after 1250.12 Al- though beguine houses were still founded in northeastern France during the thirteenth century, only feeble memories of affective mysticism survived there. No outstanding mystic was writing in that region in the thirteenth century, and the religious lay literature of that area adopted a more ascetic spirit under the influence of the 7.

In the Low Countries, however, the mystical movement of the Bernardine type continued with the old vitality and produced such prominent representatives as Hadewijk (d. ca. 1260), one of the most sublime poets in the Dutch language, Beatrice of Nazareth (d. 1268), and Gertrude van Oosten (d. 1358).13 In Germany, affective mysticism had originated at about the same time as in northern France-surprisingly-in two distant corners of the German language area and independently of one another. In the Bavarian southeast, the oldest known German poetess, Frau Ava, expressed the basic emotion of Bernardine Jesus-love in her writings. She died in 1127, that is eight years before St. Bernard began his sermons on the Canticle.14 Around 1150, an anonymous cleric wrote a paraphrase of the Song of Songs, the St. Trudpert Hohelied, which was based on an earlier work by Abbot Williram of Ebersberg, Bavaria, who died as early as 1085. Written for the edification of Benedictine nuns and chronologically the first German work of mysticism, it represented the soul as the bride of God experiencing mystical union through a reflux into the divinity. These early mani- festations of affective mysticism were already subsiding in the twelfth century. Old Bavaria south of the Danube, Austria, Tirol, and Styria produced no mysticism in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,15 even though the Franciscans and Dominicans came earlier to Austria than to other parts of Germany.16 However, the mendicant orders did not create the mystical movement, as some authors have suggested. They participated in the flowering of mysticism wherever it occurred, and often they even tried to disengage themselves from the pastoral and administrative work that the increase of convents and the spread of the mystical movement entailed.17 In northwest Germany, however, where affective mysticism had begun early in the twelfth century-with Rupert of Deutz-it con- tinued and reached its height only in the thirteenth century, at a time when it had spent itself in France.

Religious establishments for women increased out of proportion to the population, from about 70 in the year 900 to over 500 by 1250. According to Bernard Gui, two-thirds of all Dominican nunneries existing in 1277 were located in Germany. In addition, numerous beguinages were formed.18 Famous among productive mystics in the lower Rhine area were Jutta of Spanheim (fl. 1136), Elizabeth of Schonau (1129-1164), Egbert of Sch6nau (1132-1184), and Christine of Stommeln (1242- 1312), who was surrounded by a large circle of mystics northwest of Cologne. In north-central Germany, most notable were Jordan of Saxony (d. ca. 1237) and Mechthild of Magdeburg (ca. 1210-ca. 1280-90), the greatest German woman mystic, who described her ecstatic visions, The Flowing Light of the Deity, in her native Low German language, not knowing any Latin. In Thuringia lived Mechthild of Hackeborn (ca. 1241-ca. 1310) and Gertrud the Great (ca. 1260-1311), the major medieval representative of the cult of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Further south, in Franconia, Christina Ebner (1277-1356), Margaret Ebner (1291-1351), and Adelheid Langmann (d. 1375) became famous. Also active in the same area were the anonymous author of the Buch von den Sieben Graden (ca. 1320) and Heinrich of N6rdlingen (fl. 1332-51). The regional distribution of these religious manifestations presents a clear pattern. They arose in great force in the west of Germany, along the Rhine from north to south, and fanned out eastward. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, traces of affective mysticism appeared also in eastern Germany, although they never became as numerous and impressive as they were in the west. The great epilogue of medieval German mysticism was written in the Alemannian south- west, from Strasbpurg to eastern Switzerland and the area around Lake Constance. Besides the famous Suso (ca. 1295-1366), there were other luminaries such as Katharina Gebweiler (fl. 1330) and the anonymous poet of Tochter Syon (ca. 1300), whose work was formerly ascribed to the Monk of Heilsbronn. Elsbeth Stagel (d. 1350) reported on the mystical experiences of some forty nuns at T6ss in Switzerland. Several other collections of biographies of nuns were written in this area in the fourteenth century, although they often described events 18.

There were Cistercian and Franciscan convents. At the same time, beguinages had been estab- lished. For the city of Strasburg alone there is evidence for the existence of seventy beguine houses in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The incidence of mystical piety in southwest Germany was comparable in density to that of the Low Countries.20 By contrast, there was no mysticism in western Switzerland. Even eastern Switzer- land never produced an outstanding representative or leader of mysticism, and by the fourteenth century the Swiss writers on mysticism lived largely on the memories of thirteenth-century experiences.21 The bunching of mystics in certain geographical areas at certain periods of time leads to the question of the ecology of affective mysticism. Why did the mysticism of love and union remain limited to northern France, in fact largely to northeastern France? Its geo- graphical distribution did not coincide with linguistic boundaries. In the Germanic language area it was strongest in the west, from the Low Countries upward along the Rhine to Lake Constance. The farther east it spread the more sporadic it became. Why was it so rare and short-lived in old Bavaria, south of the Danube, and in Austria, when it flourished in the north and west ? Also the beguine movement, originating in Belgium, was basically limited to the regions responsive to mysticism. Beyond them, the few beguine courts found in some larger cities like Marseilles were nothing but congregations of indigent women. Affective mysticism was independent of social classes, for there were nobles and commoners, rich and poor, urban and rural people among the mystics. It has been observed by many church historians that women played 19. Friedrich Wilhelm Wentzlaff-Eggebert, Deutsche Mystik zwischen Mittelalter und Neuzeit (2nd ed.; Tilbingen, 1947), 298-99.

However, the preponder- ance of women among the productive mystics as well as among their audience cannot account by itself for the amazing vitality of affective mysticism in some areas and its absence in others. There were devout women and convents all over Europe, but affective mysticism as a cultural movement was confined to the delineated area of northern France, the Low Countries, and certain parts of Germany. The specific characteristic that distinguished these regions of Europe was a prolonged outmigration of males resulting in an un- balanced sex composition of the remaining population of young and middle-aged adults. This situation was quite different from the surplus of elderly women found in most medieval and modern European cities owing to the shorter life expectancy of men and the retirement of some elderly unattached country women to an urban environment. Long-distance migrations, whether warlike or peaceful, have during historical times always carried off more men than women, thus leaving a corresponding number of women in the home- land; and it was precisely in regions of heavy outmigration that affective mysticism arose. Northern France and Belgium were areas of spectacular out- migration beginning in the second half of the eleventh century. In 1066 noblemen and their retainers from Normandy and adjacent French and Flemish provinces conquered England, and many settled there. Northern French knights and soldiers of fortune served the Byzantine emperors as mercenaries. Others, led by Robert Guiscard and his brothers, founded a Norman state in Sicily and southern Italy. People from northern France and Burgundy fought and settled in Spain and Portugal during the reconquista of the twelfth century. Finally, in the Crusades northern French and Belgian knights and soldiers consistently formed more than half of all the participants from Catholic Christendom. The Fourth Crusade was almost entirely a northern French enterprise; so was the Albigensian crusade. These military expeditions and mass migrations were carried out pre- dominantly by younger men, leaving a surplus of women at home. When French expansion came to a halt, affective mysticism also declined. Flemings, Dutchmen, and Germans began their eastward expan- sion, the celebrated "Drive to the East," in the twelfth century and continued it throughout the thirteenth. Mysticism erupted in the Low Countries and in those areas of Germany that participated in 312</page><page sequence="9">SOCIAL CAUSES OF AFFECTIVE MYSTICISM the settlement of the vast regions east of the Elbe and Saale rivers. From old Germany migrants were still moving to eastern towns, especially to Bohemia, in the first half of the fourteenth century. However, after 1250 the eastward expansion was largely carried out by the east-Elbian populations themselves, and less and less by rural people from western Germany. For instance, Brandenburg colonized the eastern Neumark; migrants from Upper Saxony, Meissen, and Silesia settled in East Prussia; Silesian farmers settled in the Sudeten mountains, in northeast Bohemia, and also went eastward beyond the Oder river and to Poland.22 This demographic drift agrees with the interest in mysticism that emerged in the Germanized areas east of the Elbe in the later thirteenth and earlier fourteenth centuries. The Bavarians and Austrians, by contrast, had virtually terminated their earlier expansion by the twelfth century when the linguistic boun- daries between German speakers on the one side and the Italians, South Slavs, and Hungarians on the other remained stationary. Correspondingly Bavaria produced no mystical literature between the St. Trudpert Hohelied (ca. 1150) and the mystical tract De adhaerendo deo composed by the Bavarian Benedictine Johannes von Kastl about 1410.23 Also immediately west of Bavaria, in the region of modern Wirttemberg, there was little emigration and scarcely any interest in mysticism. However, the extreme southwest corner of the German language area, which was the scene of the spectacular mystical productivity of the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, emitted a massive current of emigrants. Few people from this area joined the drive to the East, but a large migration went to Italy. Most important in this movement were the thousands of German knights who served as soldiers and occasionally in other functions in all of the Italian city states, in the Papal State, and also in Naples. They hailed almost exclusively from western and southwestern Germany. Many of these men of the upper and-predominantly-lower nobility (ministeriales) owned property in Italy and married Italian women. Some Italian cities had German churches. Even those knights who finally returned to Germany had spent the middle years of their lives in Italy. While 22. Walter Kuhn, "Die deutsche Ostsiedlung vom Mittelalter bis zum 18.

The Italian cities also attracted many craftsmen, bakers, shoemakers, weavers, building workers, and others. Some of these settled per- manently in Italy, though the majority were transients, as was true of German merchants and students who also came predominantly from southwestern Germany or the middle Rhine area.25 This migration of males to Italy cannot have failed to lower the sex ratio of the younger and middle-aged adults in the Rhine area, and Nadler's observation that in southwest Germany the nobility was more strongly repre- sented in the mystical movement than in other areas,26 jibes with our knowledge of the social composition of the emigrants. When the European expansion of the Middle Ages ended, Ber- nardine mysticism lost its vitality. It is true that there always had been preachers whose interpretation of the unitive experience did not meet the fervent expectations of their hearers. For instance, Eckhart's speculative mysticism is known to have transcended the understand- ing of many of the Dominican nuns to whom he expounded his esoteric ideas. It is doubtful whether Eckhart himself ever experienced the mystical union; most probably he only philosophized about it. He as well as Tauler deprecated the rapturous peak experiences of bride mysticism. However, the later fourteenth and fifteenth cen- turies brought a general shift away from affective, ineffable, and often dogmatically suspect mysticism to an attenuated, intellectualized, theologically correct, and teachable version. In the hands of John Gerson (1363-1429), as Dean Inge observed, mysticism became "arid and formal"; he even warned against reading some works of St. Bernard and Ruysbroeck. With Ruysbroeck (1293-1381), Thomas a Kempis (1380-1471), and Gerard Groote (1340-1384) the praise of amicitia Dei was substituted for the passion of amor Dei.27 Ruys- broeck himself noted that the religious ardor of the beguines had evaporated, even before the fifteenth century when beguine convents became reduced to poor houses.28 The Imitatio Christi became the 24.

In the devotio moderna, mysticism abandoned the dizzy heights of philosophical speculation as well as the ecstatic experiences of union with Christ and climbed down to the healthy mentality of the good people of Holland and Flanders.29 Theologians continued to write about mysticism, but no one succeeded in re- kindling any mystical fervor. Preachers and writers had lost the sense for distinguishing genuine experience from contrived play with traditional mystical terminology.30 The hypothesis that affective mysticism was a psychological re- action to the surplus of women appears plausible from a content analysis of the pertinent religious literature.31 In order to sub- stantiate the presumed causal linkage between these two factors, evidence for the geographical and chronological congruence of Bernardine mysticism and sex-selective emigration has been pre- sented. A friendly critic might grant the plausibility and yet be dis- satisfied with the inability to measure the indicators such as numbers of migrants, sex ratios of migrant and sedentary populations, and exact quantitative distributions of persons receptive to mystical religiousness. Like most investigations of historical causation, this one suffers from a certain "fuzziness." This quantitative indistinct- ness of the evidence, however, is not a serious impediment in a study dealing with broad and massive movements, provided that the subject matter can be examined comparatively in separate investigations. Fortunately for the hypothesis of this study, Clio has been unusually accommodating: She repeated the performance under the changed conditions of early modern times. Affective mysticism revived in connection with the expansion of Europe in early modern times. In the sixteenth century, Spain pro- duced the most magnificent literature of this genre in European his- tory. It is noteworthy that there had been no mysticism in Spain before 29. R. R.

Thousands of soldiers, sailors, administrators, settlers, missionaries, and traders left Spain year by year, and relatively few returned. This sixteenth-century expansion was predominantly mili- tary, exploratory, and adventurous and consequently predominantly masculine.34 Owing to the markedly unbalanced sex composition the spread of mysticism was spurred enormously. Juan de Avila (1500- 1569) and Luis de Granada (1504-1588) made the innovation of using the Castilian vernacular in their mystical writings, as did St. Thomas de Villanueva (1488-1555), who brought mysticism onto the pulpit, because neither the lay public nor the majority of the nuns under- stood Latin.35 Nunneries were founded in large number throughout the sixteenth century and supervised by such outstanding mystics as St. Teresa of Avila (1515-1582), St. John of the Cross (1542-1591), and the Venerable Anne of Jesus (1545-1621).36 The size of the reading public interested in mystical literature can be gauged by the wide distribution of devotional and mystical books, some of which went through many editions. Spain is so rich in mystical literature that the bulk of it has never been printed. Including unpublished authors, Menendez y Pelayo estimated Spain's mystical authors at 3,000. Almost all the Spanish mystics were of the affective type, not speculative thinkers. Many of those who did not have ecstatic 32. E.

In the seventeenth century Spain's international influence and commitments dwindled, and migration assumed the nature of less adventurous family settlements. Furthermore a labor shortage and high wages attracted tens of thousands of Frenchmen from across the Pyrenees. With these social changes the sex ratio of the young adult and middle-aged population became more balanced and, as Peers has shown, Spanish mysticism became stereotyped and lost its creative force.37 When the great age of Spanish mysticism was drawing to a close, a similar flowering began in France. The last three decades of the sixteenth century were marked by a religious resurgence which soon took on a mystical character. Between 1570 and 1610 many of the outstanding works of Spanish mystics were translated into French. So were the writings of St. Gertrude, Suso, and Tauler; and St. Bernard's Expositio in Cantica Canticorum was republished in Latin.38 During these decades the first popular leaders of French mysticism appeared and, as Bremond avers, "a thousand sympathies were ready to sup- port them."39 The earliest prominent personage in this movement was Mme. Acarie (1566-1618), an invalid and ecstatic, who stimulated and directed almost all the leading religious minds of her day, intro- duced the Carmelite Order to France, and organized the Ursulines.40 Frangois de Sales (1567-1622) received his crucial inspiration from Mme. Acarie and from the Baroness de Chantal (1572-1641). His Introduction to a Devout Life (1608), perhaps the most-read book in the French language, consists largely of letters written to women. His only truly mystical work, the Traite de l'amour de Dieu (1614), which deals with the union of the soul with the Creator, was to a large extent based on communications from inspired women. The ascendance of women in the religious life of the seventeenth century, inside and out- side of the convent, has long been noted. While new Orders such as 37. E.

For instance, De Bernieres-Louvigny's Le chretien Interieur (1659) had gone through twelve editions by 1690, 30,000 copies having been sold.42 The vocabulary of the mystics became popular and expressions such as douceur, exces, and sainte volupte appeared in the religious poetry of the period.43 The devotion to the Sacred Heart, recommended earlier by Francois de Sales, received its greatest impetus through the visions of Marie Marguerite d'Alacoque (1647-1690). Among the last generation of the French mystical movement, the most outstanding personages were Mme. Guyon (1648-1717), Bishop Fenelon (1651- 1715), and his great antagonist, Bishop Bossuet (1627-1703); the latter was deeply influenced by affective religiousness but fought its more extreme forms with unflagging energy, in the French church as in himself. For the contention of this investigation it is important to take cognizance of the grass-roots nature of affective mysticism. In France as in Spain it occurred among all social strata, although there is more evidence for literate and upper-class persons than for lowborn and uneducated people. Marie de Valence, a simple and untutored mystic, remained unnoticed until Pere Coton first encountered her in 1599 and, as Bremond remarked, "circumstances put her light on a candle- stick, but many others burned brightly in such obscurity." Among other lower-class persons known by name were Anne LeBarbier, born near Caen, tending sheep in the fields, and Barbe de Com- piegne, "a poor servant girl," who for fifteen years was gripped by religious experiences "without any director but Jesus Christ," until she recognized in Pere Condren the soul leader destined for her. Another servant was Armelle Nicholas, "the good Armelle," who became a nun in a Breton convent. The fact that she could neither 41.

Jeanne Perraud was of an " almost noble" family of Provence, but by trade she was a dress- maker and occasionally lived on alms. The parents of Marie des Vallees were simple laborers, yet she became widely known through her claim of having exchanged her heart with that of Jesus. Madeleine Boinet, who died at Bordeaux in 1650, was employed by sympathetic noble families as a governess for their children.44 Embroiderers were among the religious attached to the Order of the Visitation.45 Marie Dorizey, a farmer's daughter of the Marne region, was able to read the Song of Songs, and believed that all creatures spoke only of the love of God. She was often overcome by moods of elation and ecstasies and made the statement that "the entire universe is one great school of love." Most significant in the present context is the report that sometimes she met other women, who were burning with the same love of God, and they would spend the night talking about their Divine Husband.46 Affective mysticism was less strongly represented in France than in Spain, corresponding to the lesser magnitude of French emigration. In 1697, when the French empire in America had reached its greatest territorial expansion, there were only 15,500 French settlers.47 How- ever, a much larger number of Frenchmen than those who went over- seas migrated on the European continent. One demographic current moved in a southwestern direction to Languedoc, Roussillon, and Spain. Roussillon had become almost entirely French even before it was acquired by the French crown in 1642. Spain had a labor shortage, especially after 1540, which was aggravated in the early seventeenth century by the expulsion of the Moriscoes. Between 1570 and 1620, when the French migration beyond the Pyrenees had reached its greatest extent, Frenchmen in the principality of Catalonia amounted to 10 to 20 percent of its male population. In four Catalan parishes that have been closely investigated, French husbands were 44. Bremond, Literary History, 2:31, 47-50; 3: 453, 486 n. 1, 515. Histoire, 5:120-39, 172-76; 6:342-43.

After 1620 migration to Spain declined rapidly owing to the depressed economic condition of Spain, and many Frenchmen even returned to their homeland.48 Languedoc, however, continued to receive immigrants from northern and central France, the majority of whom were males.49 Correspond- ing to this southwestward movement Languedoc and Roussillon produced virtually no mystical literature.50 Another overland migra- tion proceeded from southeastern France, especially from Provence to Italy. After the epidemic of 1630 high wages in Italy attracted French artisans and laborers.51 Most important, however, was the solid eastward expansion of France. In the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries France occupied militarily and largely acquired politically a belt of territories from Artois, West Flanders, Hainault in the northeast to Franche Comte, Lorraine, and Alsace on its central eastern frontier. The political acquisition, however, was preceded and accompanied by a demographic eastward movement. In fact, this migration proceeded without regard for political boundaries. After 1640 the depopulated areas of eastern France received a continuous influx of people from both northern and southern France. Many villages of Burgundy were repopulated by strangers who were attracted by the reduction of dues and tithes.52 This migratory movement anticipated rather than fol- lowed the re-unification of the Franche Comte with France in 1678 and the occupation of Lorraine from 1670 to 1698 and its final acquisition during the reign of Louis XV.53 In the latter half of the seventeenth century a considerable migration proceeded also to Switzerland, Alsace, and sporadically beyond the Rhine. In part, this migration was economically motivated, especially in the decade after the Thirty Years' War; in part, it followed in the wake of Louis 48. J. Nadal &amp; E.

The peak of this eastward migration seems to have been reached in the 1680s. Traders and government officials followed the French occupation forces and often stayed after the soldiers had left. Even on the east bank of the Rhine many Frenchmen settled and married in the town of Freiburg im Breisgau, which was under French occupation from 1677 to 1698. In the 1690s, 30 percent of the children baptized there had French fathers.54 In accordance with these migrations, affective mysticism in France was regionally limited. It flourished in the southeast: First, in point of time, in Provence, which Bremond has noted was "the most ardent center of mystic activity toward the end of the sixteenth century." Provence and the neighboring Lyonnais, Dauphine, and Savoy remained areas of mystical devotion through the seventeenth and into the early eighteenth century.55 The other part of France that in the seventeenth century displayed a vivid mystical life was the north: Brittany, Normandy, and the Isle de France.56 Areas of a minor mystical surge were the western provinces, from Maine and Anjou southward to Saintonge and the Bordelais,57 from which originated many of the overseas emigrants and also a considerable contingent of the French settlers in Spain and southwestern France. By contrast, there were only slight traces of mysticism in Burgundy and the Franche Comte.58 Mystical religiousness was even less in evidence in Lorraine and Alsace. The regional incidence of affective mysticism agrees broadly with the currents of migration. There are, however, serious obstacles for any attempt to test the geographical correlation between male emi- gration and mystical religiousness more closely. The lives and suc- cessive whereabouts of many minor mystics are known only vaguely or not at all. Paris and its environs would certainly be overrepresented in any compilation of personal names, since several outstanding 54. F.

By contrast, the Massif Central appears to be underrepresented. Virtually no religious experiences were committed to paper in this area of economic and cultural poverty. Marguerite d'Arbouze, who was born in Auvergne in 1580, became known to posterity only be- cause, in 1614, she moved to Montmartre in Paris.59 Another barrier to a geographic-statistical approach is the difficulty of separating out those mystics who practiced affective prayer from other devout persons whose religiousness had a predominantly ascetic or intel- lectualizing quality. In many borderline cases the decision whether or not to include a person among affective mystics has an unavoidable element of arbitrariness. Unfortunately, Bremond, in his monu- mental work, adopted a definition of mysticism so comprehensive as to include all types of religious devotions. In Germany and the Netherlands affective mysticism became a popular movement when it reappeared in the early seventeenth cen- tury. Again, it was synchronous with emigration, but in contrast to France it lasted well inlto the eighteenth century. The Netherlands was an area of powerful outmigration. Relatively few people, to be sure, went to the far-flung Dutch overseas possessions in the Americas, South Africa, and Indonesia. More men served as seamen in the Dutch commercial fleet, which in 1634 boasted 35,000 vessels, and in the French merchant marine. A large number, however, moved permanently overland eastward to northern Germany and farther afield. In combination, all of these outward movements cannot have failed to unbalance the sex ratio among the mnarriageable home population. Western Germany participated only in the eighteenth century in the European overseas expansion. Between 1709 and 1775 close to 100,000 West Germans migrated overseas, the bulk of them to Pennsylvania. A much larger current of German migration, however, led eastward. As the Dutch and the Frisians moved eastward, so did migrants from Westfalia and Lower Saxony, areas which therefore scarcely increased in population in the later seventeenth and eighteenth 59. Bremond, Literary History, 2:356-93. The lack of evidence for mysticism in the Massif Central may find its explanation in a desertion from this poor mountainous region of as many or more young women than men to find employment as servants in the cities. However, the sex ratio of the migrants has not been established.</page><page sequence="19">SOCIAL CAUSES OF AFFECTIVE MYSTICISM centuries. From the Palatinate and Wiirttemberg, people moved to Prussia, Galicia, Poland, and Hungary. Under Frederick II (1740- 1786) 300,000 persons are estimated to have settled in Prussia. Bohemia received many German-speaking people in the seventeenth century, although large numbers of Protestants moved northward after the battle at the White Mountain (1620). Silesia was also an area of both in- and outmigration, depending on local conditions. New German settlers went to southern Silesia and east of the Oder river, whereas the western and northern parts of Silesia were the source of forceful outmigration, especially into Polish territories and Moldavia. Most of the immigrants to the Habsburg possessions came from the Rhine or from southwest Germany. The resumption, after more than 200 years, of this German drive to the East was part of a demographic shift of continental proportions. The more spectacular long-distance movements are best known, as for instance the emigration of Austrian Protestants to Transylvania and to East Prussia, or the movements of German peasants to the Volga and to the Crimea. Most people, however, migrated over shorter distances. The general trend of this myriad of individual migrations was in an eastward direction, beginning sporadically in the later sixteenth and becoming a powerful movement in the seven- teenth and earlier eighteenth centuries. Politically these movements were connected with the rise of Brandenburg-Prussia and the re- conquest of Hungary from Turkish rule. Even though most of these resettlements predominantly involved whole families, there were always many more men than women, with a preponderance of males in their teens and twenties.60 It is noteworthy that affective mysticism arose and spread in- dependently of religious denominations. Among eminent representa- tives of this type of mysticism, Gottfried Arnold (1666-1714) was a Lutheran, Johannes Scheffler (Angelus Silesius) (1624-1677) a Catholic, Tersteegen (1697-1769) a Calvinist, and Count Zinzendorf (1700-1760) a Lutheran, who became a member of the refounded Moravian Church. This irrelevance of denominational differences is especially significant in view of the otherwise strongly divergent intel- lectual and literary developments of Protestant and Catholic 60. The only known sex ratio of German migrants is that of the Pennsylvania German pioneers which was 133.5 males to 100 females.

The emotional readiness for unitive mysticism was prepared in the late sixteenth century, when elements of Catholic mysticism and even of Jesuit piety penetrated Protestant prayer books. This influence came to full fruition in Johann Arndt's Paradiesgdrtlein (1612).62 Affective mysticism burst forth with amazing vitality in the mid- seventeenth century. In the Netherlands, authors such as Jodocus van Lodensteyn (1620-1677) and Hermann Witsius (1636-1708) ex- patiated on the bride relationship between Christ and the soul. Philip von Zesen (1619-1689), an author with a keen commercial sense, wrote several prayer books for women, including in them a goodly amount of religious eroticism. Sicco Tjaden (1693-1736) and Willem Schortinghuis (ca. 1700-1750) were popular mystics and spoke in pietist conventicles in cities as well as in small villages. Women were prominent in the sects founded by Jan de Labadie (1610-1674) as they were among the Hattemists and Verschoorists in the early eighteenth century. Abraham Hellenbroek wrote a Dutch interpretation of the Song of Solomon, Het hooglied van Salomo verklaart en vergeestelijkt, of no less than 2,258 pages in quarto, which went through four editions between 1718 and 1730. Influential in both the Netherlands and Germany were Antoinette Bourignon (1616- 1680) and Peter Poiret (1646-1719), the latter a prolific author, trans- lator, and editor who introduced the mystical writings of the Romanic countries to the German public.63 In western Germany, affective mysticism was strongly represented.

Labadie was invited by Elizabeth, daughter of the elector of the Palatinate, who became abbess of the nunnery at Herford. Early in the eighteenth century, a community cultivating Baroque mysticism was established at Berleburg. Later, Tersteegen became the most outstanding per- sonage of this area where both Catholics and Protestants produced notable mystical poetry.65 In southwest Germany, Georg Philipp Harsd6rffer (1607-1658) stood out in the Nuremberg group of poets as a representative of Jesus-love (Jesus-minne). Affective mysticism usually attached itself to pietism, which was a more comprehensive movement stressing a theology of religious individualism and per- sonal commitment. Particularly in the small towns of Wiirttemberg, women preponderated in pietistic circles. Beata Sturm (1682-1730) has been called the mere angelique of Protestant pietism. Among Dominican nuns in this area Cacilia Mayrin (1717-1749) and Columba Schonath (1730-1787) became widely admired for their ecstatic experiences.66 In eastern Germany, affective mysticism was more sporadically represented, which corresponds to the scanty emigration from these regions. Austria and Bavaria produced only mystical literature of minor importance and quantity with the sole exception of Catharina Regina von Greiffenberg (1633-1694), an Austrian Protestant living in exile at Regensburg, who gave arresting poetic expression to her erotic cult of Jesus.67 The provinces of the Prussian monarchy were demographically mostly receiving areas and harbored little mysticism despite the widespread influence of pietistic theology. There were, however, regional differentiations, which appeared strikingly in Silesia: The areas of old settlement, that is the northwestern region and the neighboring Upper Lusatia contributed profusely to German mystical Baroque poetry.

Other outstanding authors were Johann Heermann, Abraham von Franckenberg, Christian Knorr von Rosenroth, Paul Gerhard, Johann Frank, and finally Count Ludwig Zinzendorf.68 By contrast, there was no mysticism in the southeastern half of Silesia which was then an area of inmigration. German Baroque mysticism was distinguished by an exuberant and often morbidly emotional quality, a mixture of sweetness and cruelty, which culminated in the cult of blood and wounds. This mentality invaded the most popular branch of literature of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the books of devotion (Erbauungsbiicher), which were sometimes adorned with illustrations portraying the soul in female attire standing before her Heavenly Bridegroom.69 The demand for these books of edification became so great in Germany and the Netherlands as to make free-lancing possible. Zesen and Poiret were the first writers to support themselves entirely from their income as independent authors. In the mid-eighteenth century no writer or preacher could compare with Count Zinzendorf, whose audience extended far beyond the German language area.70 As in France and Spain, all social classes were represented among the mystics, from the nobility to the peasantry.71 Angelus Silesius expressed his admiration for the mystical fervor of the untutored in a distich: Wie allgemein ist Gott! Er hat der Bauer-Magd die Kunst wie man ihn Kist, so wol als dir gesagt.72 (God is universal! He taught the peasant maid the art of kissing Him as He taught it to you.)

These females diffused not only more piety, but likewise more genuine and essential religion than all the Scribes and Pharisees, the literary and pedantic wranglers of those times.73 t.2 After the major countries displaying affective mysticism have been covered, the continuation of the geographic game for western Europe would add little to the confirmation of the hypothesis. Several other questions, however, must be taken up to clarify the validity of the causal explanation: Were countries of immigration devoid of affective mysticism? Did any religious manifestations comparable to Bernardine mysticism of love and union occur outside of Western Christianity? What was the place of men and especially of male leaders in a movement predicated on the psychological needs of women? Finally, why did ecstatic experiences of the unio mystica dwindle to the point of near-extinction, although mass emigration was resumed on an even larger scale in the nineteenth century? The explanation of affective mysticism as the result of an un- balanced sex ratio is indeed corroborated by the lack of this type of religiousness in countries of immigration. In Colonial America, which had a statistically known surplus of males, all attempts to establish affective mysticism proved fruitless.74 A similar situation prevailed in Hungary and Transylvania. Pietism had a considerable influence in these areas. Many pietist ministers tried to popularize the "theology of the heart," and some German mystical writings were translated into Hungarian. Affective mysticism, however, did not take root.75 Poland-after some expansion of its population into the western 73.

In the earlier period, of the two major representatives of Polish spirituality, Nicolas Leczycki (1576-1652) and Gaspard Druzbicki (1590-1660), the latter promoted the cult of the Sacred Heart. However, the bulk of the writings of these authors was ascetic rather than mystical. Anna Maria Marchocka (1603-1652), an ecstatic nun of the Order of Discalced Carmelites, reported her religious experiences in the form of letters. They were not published, however, before the twentieth century, nor were the autobiographical writings of other Polish Carmelites of the seventeenth century con- sidered worthy of publication by their contemporaries. Most signifi- cant, however, is the drying-up of these early sources of affective mysticism after the mid-seventeenth century. This is all the more surprising considering the strong cultural influence of western Europe on Poland during this period. Apart from the veneration of the Mother of God, promoted under Jesuit auspices and, with royal backing, developed to a "servitude of Mary," Polish spirituality was ascetic rather than unitive along the pattern of Saints Bernard and Teresa of Avila.77 In the Russian-Orthodox culture area affective mysticism was un- known.78 After Quirinus Kuhlmann, the half-crazed German chiliast, had been burned in Moscow, in 1689, Jacob Boehme's purely speculative mysticism took hold in Russia. German pietism also evoked some interest there but did not lead to any assimilation of its mystical aspects.79 A remote resemblance to the bride mysticism of western Europe, however, can be detected in the sect of the Khlysty. Its poetry represented the soul predominantly as a girl or young woman languishing for a loving communion with God ("Father 76.

The central emotion expressed in this poetry is a yearning for protection and the fear of loneliness and abandonment, modeled after the child's attitude toward his parents.80 The Khlysty preached sexual abstinence and rejected the institution of marriage, but were accused of concluding their religious meetings and orgiastic dances with sexual abandon. Everyone could become divine and could experience the working of the spirit. They believed in the corporeal presence of God the Father or Christ in certain individuals, but many women also assumed leading positions and were regarded as divine mothers or goddesses.81 The origin of the Khlysty is obscure. It seems that the sect was composed of elements of prehistoric Siberian shamanism, Russian-Finnish pagan sorcery, and Christian additions. However, there are no authentic records on the Khlysty before 1716, although by that time the sect had existed and spread widely for at least half a century. In our context it is significant that enthusiastic women were more active among the Khlysty than men and outnumbered them con- siderably, in some areas ten to one. More women than men were prosecuted for heresy.82 The sect spread precisely in the central area of Russia from which free peasants and fugitive serfs migrated to the Ukraine, the lower Volga region, and Siberia.83 These older regions of the Russian empire had then a surplus of women, whereas the Ukraine and southern Russia were "a man's world." As late as 1764, when local statistical information was collected, the settlers of Elizavetgrad had a sex composition of 128.5 men to 100 women. In 1772, the total population of the gouvernement of Novorossijsk had 120.1 men to 100 women.84 It seems that the same specific factor that was operative in the development of affective mysticism in western 80.

Another highly mobile population of eastern Europe were the Ashkenazim. Their migrations, however, did not lead to an un- balanced sex composition owing to their internationally organized marriage brokerage. East European Jews arranged for very early marriages, usually at the age of puberty, leaving extremely few persons unmarried. This conforms with the absence of the tenderness and sweetness as well as the sexual imagery of affective mysticism in the European Jewish religious tradition. "The long history of Jewish mysticism shows no trace of feminine influence. There have been no women Kabbalists."85 Jewish and Muslim mysticism shared the need to overcome the awesome distance between man and the Semitic deity. However, the remoteness of God and His unconcern with human feelings did not set up an insurmountable dogmatic obstacle to emotional closeness. Islamic mysticism, in fact, developed unitive-mystical features in eighth-century Iraq. At that time there existed in the Muslim East enthusiastic women, of whom the most outstanding was Rabi'a, a native of Basra, who died at Jerusalem in 801. "It was the develop- ment of mysticism (Suffism) within Islam, which gave women their great opportunity to attain the rank of sainthood." 86 The thematic content of the poetry ascribed to Rabi'a is very similar to the ideas and feelings expressed by Western mystics of the affective type. Allah becomes the composite figure of father, lover, and bridegroom, and the mystic's yearning for communion with her "Divine Friend" is a frustrating as well as a reparative fantasy. My Beloved is with me always, For His love I can find no substitute And His love is the test for me among mortal beings, When-e'er His Beauty I may contemplate. The striving after union with Thee has healed my soul, O my Joy and my Life abidingly, Thou wast the source of my life and from Thee also came my ecstasy.87 85. Gershom G.

Chronologically this eighth-century mysticism arose during the early period of Muslim conquest and expansion. This may have entailed a surplus of women in Iraq, Syria, and Arabia. However that may have been, Rabi'a was one of the earliest and most revered representatives of Sufism. In later centuries only one Sufi, Ibn al-Farid (1181-1235), wrote religious poetry referring to God as his Beloved. He was an Egyptian who received his religious inspiration during fifteen formative years in Mecca. He retained the form, topics, and imagery of ordinary love poetry in his religious verses.88 Whether any significance can be attributed to the geographical location of these few cases must be left an open question. On the whole, Sufism developed in a different direction, away from the amorous con- templation of particular aspects of the divinity. It was mainly con- cerned with gloomy asceticism and self-purification. Its mystical components, however, were elaborated according to Neoplatonic in- spirations with a pantheistic vision of one reality in which the in- dividual becomes annihilated.89 This brief scanning of the incidence of affective mysticism in eastern Europe and in the Islamic world suggests that our hypothesis may have a cultural bias. It cannot be expected that a surplus of younger women has the same cultural consequences everywhere. Nor should it be assumed that an unbalanced sex ratio is the only cause for regres- sion to the state of a love-craving child and blissful feelings of union with God. This becomes apparent especially from a consideration of certain cults of medieval India that share some thematic similarities with European religious eroticism, but are rooted in entirely different sociocultural environments.90 Even though the concatenation of emigration, surplus of women, and affective mysticism appears to hold good occasionally beyond western Europe, the "cultural climate" must be recognized as another conditioning variable that is indispensable for an adequate description of the causative process. 88.

Of equal importance, however, was the marriage pattern specific to Western civilization. Whereas among most populations of the world marriage is entered into at an early age, the marriage pattern of western and central Europe has been less per- missive but highly flexible. Varying with regional customs and economic conditions, the usual age at first marriage was com- paratively late. It appears that this late average age at first marriage and, furthermore, the existence in Western civilization of a relatively large number of persons who never married promoted in the popula- tion a psychic susceptibility to affective mysticism. To strengthen the validation of our hypothesis it must be shown how the individual psychodynamic phenomena-repressions, frustra- tions, anxieties, conversion hysterias, substitute gratifications in fantasy, and so on-were transformed into a social movement or religious fellowship. One might ask, for instance, why so many men were actively participating in a movement that resulted from a surplus of women. The problem is no more mysterious than is the active or encouraging participation of middle-aged and elderly people in a youth movement. Generally it can be observed that the core of a movement that meets with mounting success acts like a positive catalyst. People with different but related interests adjust to the movement, join it, and make contributions to it. Participation pro- vides individuals with emotional support and a good conscience for their private thoughts and desires; beyond that it can even facilitate public recognition and influence. A culture complex or a historical movement such as affective mysticism can therefore not be adequately understood as a summation of individual psychological phenomena, but must be studied as a process of conceptual and symbolic com- munication and interaction.91 In medieval and early modern Western Christendom a large pro- portion of men as well as women suffered from problems of sexual adjustment to the moral demands of society. Individual difficulties varied, of course, from one person to the next, and just as the most diverse personalities were found among women mystics, men also were variously motivated when they fastened upon the symbolism of affective mysticism. For example, Johannes Scheffler, who never had 91. Marvin K. Opler, Culture and Social Psychiatry (New York, 1967). 332</page><page sequence="29">SOCIAL CAUSES OF AFFECTIVE MYSTICISM a family either in his youth or in adult life, addressed himself to the Savior as his spouse and his child. Gottfried Arnold saw in the Holy Spirit or Wisdom (Sophia) a female personage, his "marvellously beautiful bride." E. C. Hochmann von Hohenau (1670-1721), who was obsessed with androgynous fantasies, insisted that Christ was asexual and elaborated a casuistry of congress between two beings: Animal union, moral but pagan union, Christian union, chaste union, and mystical union.92 The fantasy productions of some male mystics had pronounced homosexual connotations. Participation in the broader movement of affective mysticism permitted these men to deal with their unconscious needs symbolically, through verbaliza- tions within an officially recognized thought system, and thus to find relief without arousing anxiety.93 Others found a chance to com- pensate for their sense of alienation by philosophizing about reunion with "the One," even though their audience of affective mystics had to assimilate this Neoplatonic symbolism to its specific emotional needs. Most important for the growth and vitality of the mystical move- ment was the cooperative involvement of men and women, when complementary needs and abilities became creatively correlated. This can be traced back to the profound interaction of the Bernardine and the feminine currents of piety in the cooperation of Cistercians and beguines.94 Numerous cases have been recorded of dyadic coopera- tion of male and female mystics. The earliest of these relationships was Jacques de Vitry's veneration for Marie d'Oignies, his "spiritual mother," whom he considered a saint.95 Petrus of Dacia, a student of Thomas Aquinas, felt that the love of the ecstatic Christine of Stom- meln permitted him to partake of God's kingdom.96 Among the numerous dyads occurring in Spain, France, and Germany in the six- teenth and seventeenth centuries, the most celebrated is the "spiritual friendship" between Jeanne de Chantal and Frangois de Sales.97 92.

Pere Jean Eudes received in- spiration from Marie des Vallees (1590-1656), "a woman of the people"; M. de Renty was directed by Marguerite de Beaune; and M. Olier, one of the most sought-after confessors, was guided by Agnes de Langeac and several others.98 The eccentric Mme. Guyon (1648-1717) knew from revelation that Pere Lacombe was son as well as father to her. Later Bishop Fenelon confessed that she taught him a method of prayer that expanded his mind; and from 1689 to 1694 he experienced states of euphoria under her influence. These relationships conformed to the syndrome of folie a deux. Most commonly in these cases the women were the ingenious and creative mystics, while the men, often their confessors, guided their emotional and intellectual steps, often keeping them within the bounds of the dogma. The men had the gripping experience of wit- nessing in another person a depth of feeling and an immediate contact with divine forces, of which they themselves were incapable. The women mystics found the satisfaction of sharing their revelations with a respected personage, often a father figure for them, and having their religious experiences and "insights" legitimated. In the majority of cases, however, the women were simply guided by their spiritual directors, who gave them the opportunity to derive relief from talking about their psychic misery. The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were "the golden age of the confessor." 99 Larger groups of mystics had different structures. They might be nunneries, prayer circles, correspondents of theologians, or an entirely unorganized reading public, devotees of favorite authors. Affective mysticism had a leadership of intellectuals, organizers, and publicity agents, typical for an "expressive movement." These persons assumed the task of connecting the movement with the rest of society and providing for some internal cohesion. However, since affective mysticism was not an activist movement, that is, not aiming at social change, whatever leadership emerged catered almost ex- clusively to the psychological needs of their followers or fellow 98.

They helped them to relieve their tensions and promoted a sense of personal expansion in a setting of like-minded people.100 Up to the mid-eighteenth century, persons with widely divergent psychological needs and social backgrounds could be attracted by affective mysticism. Thereafter this ceased to be the case. The sex- selective emigrations of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and the ensuing surplus of marriageable women in several European countries no longer led to the invasion of sexual imagery into religion, much less to a mystical movement providing shared emotional support. What brought on the demise of affective mysticism, together with the termination of various other culture patterns, was the vast sociocultural change of modernization. Intellectual modernization began with the skeptical mentality and the scientific achievements of the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, eventuating in the Enlightenment. Irrationality and an unseemly depth of emotionality were no longer looked upon indulgently. Extravagant behavior in the field of religion as elsewhere was suppressed or at least hidden from public view.101 With this change in thought patterns, theologians like Bossuet, who in earlier times might have joined the ranks of the mystics, came to fear that the publicity of the fantasmal beliefs and claims of the more extreme mystics might harm the credibility and respectability of religion. In France this wary attitude began with Fran9ois de Sales. Bremond credits him with having saved French mysticism from losing itself in morbid manifestations. Jeanne Chantal also warned against "the delusions of mental prayer." Her exhortation to place work in the service of the sick and the young above the extraordinary graces became the accepted attitude of later generations. Even Fenelon, the only churchman of high rank in seventeenth-century France to accept mysticism whole-heartedly, counseled emotional restraint in his letters of spiritual advice.102 Likewise in Germany, in 1693, when 100.

A few years later Johann Heinrich Feustking, Chief Councillor of the Lutheran Con- sistory of Gotha, published a full-length anti-feminist attack on affective mysticism and related phenomena throughout history. He especially denounced Gottfried Arnold as the foremost Pied Piper of "enthusiastic females." 103 The changes in the social role of women concomitant with modernization have so far received little attention. Traditional Western Christianity promoted and rewarded passivity, abnegation, and submissiveness in women. It is true that the real-life situation of many women in the households of farmers, craftsmen, and nobles militated against the psychological subjection of women, in medieval as well as in early modern times. Nevertheless, woman's needs for personal autonomy and her interest in community affairs were in- evitably thwarted under traditional social conditions; but whenever movements for moral revitalization presented new options, women participated conspicuously in them. In contrast to their role in traditional Christianity, women assumed active and often leading positions in the heresies of the thirteenth century, among the Huguenots of sixteenth-century France, among the early Quakers, and in other Protestant circles.104 These movements were harbingers of modern developments; yet prior to the nineteenth century they were narrow in scope and at best would last only a few decades before the forces of traditionalism and male dominance reasserted them- selves. One of the most important aspects of modernization is the in- creasingly significant role of a person's vocation for his life content and self-concept. The fact that most of the women in the several hundred convents in seventeenth-century France were dedicated to teaching or nursing heralded a change in attitudes, although they 103.

The value of work for its own sake was first recognized in the Enlightenment. To be sure, at that time work was personally fulfilling only for a small minority. The replacement of the ideal of the gentleman with that of the pro- fessional person was a slow process. Women especially profited late from the vocational satisfactions that industrial civilization made available. Young women of the working class first gained in factory jobs a modicum of personal independence, which was generally mis- perceived by middle-class observers as a descent into licentiousness. Only much later did industrial society need, and educationally provide for, the more advanced professional skills of women. The gratifications derived from the anthropomorphic interpreta- tion of the Christian deity were increasingly replaced by secular interests. The popular demand for religious books of edification declined as that for novels rose.105 The change to modernity was reflected in the secularization of fantasy gratifications. Pessimistic culture critics have deplored the mounting production of trivial and vulgar literature, plays, and other entertainments and the craving for all kinds of thrills culminating in the desire for "instant mysticism" induced by psychedelic drugs. It is also true, however, that more people than ever before found psychic renewal and repair through music, poetry, artistic creativity, and other forms of "regression in the service of the ego."106 At the same time, interpersonal relations between friends, lovers, and married couples became more sensitive and considerate, at least among the upper and middle classes.107 Since modern man had decided to overcome the imperfections of his life by means of efficacious activity and realistic knowledge, affective mysticism had lost its viability. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries there were still devout Christians practicing affective prayer with ecstatic abandon, but they did so without the community support of the past and confronted by an ever-growing public awareness of its pathological implications.108 When private 105.
