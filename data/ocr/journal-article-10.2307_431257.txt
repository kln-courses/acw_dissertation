NUMBERS INVIGORATE PICTURES Since numbers and pictures are diametric oppo- sites, digital images are at first glance improba- ble players in the drama of culture. An image is a visible percept concretely embodied in a phys- ical object. A number is an invisible concept ab- stractly designated by formal symbols. The aes- thetic principles that guide our appreciation of pictures have no relevance to plying digits, and the mathematical rules that govern reasoned for- mulae have no bearing on understanding art. "Paint by number" is a derisive appellation in the halls of high art, alluding to the idle parlor pastime that mindlessly fabricates vapid objects worthy of artistic ridicule. A "digital image" is trifling if not oxymoronic. Despite this apparent contrariety, computers have rapidly infiltrated everyday communica- tions where they routinely ingest, digest, and re- gurgitate vast amounts of digital imagery, along with many other types of information including text, sound, and numerical data. Computer-as- sisted pictures are filling the theater of civiliza- tion-sometimes surreptitiously'-as they play growing roles in magazines, classrooms, cine- mas, homes, banks, arcades, ... and even in art museums and artist's studios. Indeed, the im- pact on art is sufficiently developed to warrant a cover article in ARTnews announcing that "com- puters are transforming the way images are made, objects are studied, and visitors view pic- tures."1I We read that "the digital revolution, in a rainbow of 16 million colors, has arrived."2 In the short span of two decades, the look of com- puter art has evolved from austere to luscious and it is creating new roles for art as it also sup- plants some of the techniques employed in tra- ditional art making. A computer can streamline and expedite tedious manual tasks to increase the artist's creative potential. But more impor- tant, it augurs novel scenarios for working, play- ing, and knowing that have yet to unfold. For better and for worse, the changes being wrought by our increasing involvement with computers promise to be far-reaching. We are not simply creating a revolution in art, but are overhauling the foundations of culture. The con- sequences of digitizing our discourses encom- pass not only expanded creative phenomena, but also extended interconnections between art and the rest of culture as we interact more frequently and more fully with each other across geo- graphic, political, and cultural boundaries. Eu- rope and Japan have made significant strides to- ward networking their citizens with high-speed digital communication links, and a new govern- ment initiative in the United States seeks a na- tional fiber optic "highway" that will open floodgates of data from around the world and further shrink the circle of the "global village."3 Visual data are paramount in shaping the in- terface as well as supplying the content for this network. Since the amount of information con- tained in images tends to be massive, computer- ized high-bandwidth4 links make it possible to share them as never before. Moreover, pictures are superbly demonstrative and eminently com- putable, transcending the parochial limitations of natural languages. They are now likely to play increasingly larger roles in all types of communication since they are becoming much easier to make and to move. Digital images are no more or less paradoxi- cal than thinking machines. Computers can be enigmatic because they challenge some of the most fundamental tenets of Western civiliza- tion, from ontological presuppositions about what exists to epistemological presumptions about how to find out.5 They also stage riddles The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 55:2 Spring 1997</page><page sequence="2">108 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism to the common sense forged by centuries of ex- perience through the eyes of Western philoso- phy. An automobile that talks to you abrogates the mind/matter barrier but also engenders an unnerving feeling that your quotidian taxonomy is crumbling. Problems about understanding digital technology lurk in the long shadows cast by a still colossal Platonic dualism. Despite the forcefulness of a variety of recent philosophical attacks, everyday language still harbors di- chotomous residues cleaving mind from matter, representation from reality, and emotion from cognition. As a result, we will continue speak- ing about computers in paradoxes until our lan- guage catches up with our creativity. The fortitude of computers in resisting the daunting weight of so much history comes in large measure from the way they are able to amalgamate the affective power of illusionistic images with the ideational responsiveness of au- tomated calculation. Machines that figure can play dual roles. Digital technology challenges dualism by spawning nimble avatars of holism conceived from a cross-pollination of science and art. We are constructing silicon bridges across time-honored mental abysses. Despite its novelty, the digital revolution builds upon long-standing, if sometimes misun- derstood, traditions in the arts. The background out of which digital images vigorously leap is insightfully described by David Freedberg in The Power of Images. He delineates numerous examples from different periods where images have been endowed with a variety of primitive powers, from healing the sick and saving the damned to arousing the lascivious. Quoting Nelson Goodman, he explains how "the domi- neering dichotomy between the cognitive and the emotive"6 has prevented us from recogniz- ing this power. Because of our predisposition to- ward the same dualism that computers chal- lenge, we have failed to acknowledge universal human responses to images throughout history, in many different cultures, both inside and out- side the context of art. At the heart of Freedberg's argument is the re- alization that "representation is subsumed by presence."7 This is explained in an interesting anecdote about how he became angry at the Madonna, and not simply at her likeness, upon being disappointed in a sculpture after a long and arduous hike to see it. He details at great length many other emotional responses to pic- tures that are predicated on seeing through a representation to make its subject present. This is why people pray to a statue or lust after a pho- tograph. In each case, the spectator elides the physical representation to enter the spiritual presence. It is this ability to make the absent pres- ent that allows us vicariously to travel the world from an easy chair and have feelings about it through the voyeurism of magazines and televi- sion. From empathizing with the anguish of the starved, to being awed by the feats of a gymnast, our reactions tell of an experience that is more like having the subject of a representation be- fore us than merely her transported likeness. For Freedberg, the key to understanding the influence images exercise over us is their ability to re-present what they represent. The distinc- tion between representation and reality does not always function as an impediment to being moved by a depicted person or event.8 The artis- tic medium often barricades reality from repre- sentation only for the sake of preserving it. Sometimes an image encourages us to bask in the transcribed presence of its subject as traces of her existence are lodged in a medium that spirits her visage across space and time. By thoroughly studying the history of human responses to images, Freedberg detected many factors that question a tidy separation of intel- lect and emotion and highlight the need "to ac- knowledge the role of sensation in knowledge."9 But computers press this challenge to dualism much more deeply as they interpenetrate the image and the viewer to merge representation and reality in a new way. Computers affect us, in part, because images do. But computers supersede our modern image- drenched culture of magazines and movies be- cause we can influence them to act in response to us. Digital representations not only possess a power to move us borrowed from their analog predecessors, they also contain a vitality which enables them to engage us in unique and per- sonal interactive experiences. If images make their subjects present to us, digital representa- tions make us present to them. The computer opens up our image-saturated culture to a virtual universe composed of numbers that are oddly capable of reaching out to us. Our individual presences are delivered to the subjects of digital representations, and vice versa, as they engage</page><page sequence="3">Binkley The Vitality of Digital Creation 109 us in dialogue. Digital images transcend power to achieve vitality. At the source of all this activity are two closely related transformations: the replacement of ana- log with digital media, accompanied by a shift from mechanical to computational models of technological problem-solving. Two main con- cepts characterize these changes: virtuality and interactivity. II. THE VIRTUAL REALITY OF DIGITAL MEDIA Throughout the ages, analog media have set the stage where artists petition posterity for a place in history. From the earliest cave paintings and stone carvings to the contemporary "mass media" epitomized by television, matter has been shaped into forms as a means of transport- ing messages across space and time. Digital media are relatively new players in the drama of culture, and their methods for managing infor- mation are fundamentally different. Analog media are primed for imprint, while digital ones are structured to symbolize. One is focused on concrete preservation and presentation, the other on abstract storage and manipulation. Al- though digital technologies can be excellent mimics of analog ones, their functionality is more diverse. In brief, analog media are pre- pared to receive and preserve traces of events while digital media are formatted to store and process symbols of numbers. Both types of media can be used to represent reality, but they do it in quite different ways. What is a representation? In visual art contexts, the word conjures up images of pictures. The Mona Lisa represents someone sporting an enigmatic smile; Guernica represents a hideous massacre. In mathematics and science, however, representations tend to be abstractions that are more descriptive than depictive. At their most grand, they are theories; frequently they are di- agrams; and at their humblest they are simply raw data. These are two radically different ways to rep- resent information about the world. A person's appearance is represented in a photograph that qualitatively depicts her visage, while height and weight are represented by numerical measure- ments that quantitatively capture more clinical traits. We can see her in the picture, but we can only infer her from the numbers. She may look gaunt, but her height and weight might lead us to conclude that she is fit instead. Appearances possess an incommensurable particularity that numbers lack, but the generality of mathemati- cal structures makes them tools for inference and frameworks for theory. An analog medium is usually primed into a smooth tabula rasa as preparation for it to re- ceive an imprint of creative activity. The artis- tic gesture maculates a smooth continuum. The resulting echo is an analogue of the reality echoed: it tends to have curves where its source has curves and is straight where the original is. The reason for this similarity is that information is essentially transcribed from one physical ma- terial to another. A direct physical impression moves information from a subject to its analog representation. The camera is the apotheosis of analog representation, as it uses light to trace shapes of objects instantly onto film.10 Simi- larly, analog music recordings on cassette tran- scribe fluctuations of sound waves through the air into fluctuations of electrons which are then transcribed again into varying magnetic fields on tape. Each analog medium is grounded in a particular material substrate where imprints are pressed to transcribe form from one substance to another. Digital representations, on the other hand, take measurements rather than impressions of what they represent: their goal is mensuration rather than maculation. To achieve their trans- aesthetic epiphany, they convert information from material into numerical entities rather than transcribing it from one physical substance into another. For example, analog video transcribes light into electric current, while digital video converts light into pure numbers dissociated from any physical unit. An analog medium transfers shape to produce an analogue of one physical arrangement in another, analogous one. But digital media transform physical form into conceptual structure. A shape or color is con- verted into a number whose symbol is then in- scribed on a ledger so that it can subsequently be ascertained by a machine or a person. The ma- terial out of which this ledger is constructed is incidental to the information stored, unlike the constitutive material defining an analog me- dium. Regnant technologies today use electrons circulating through silicon chips and iron oxide on magnetic disks, but optical disks are rapidly</page><page sequence="4">110 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism overtaking their short-lived predecessors, and optical computers that use light instead of elec- tricity to perform computations and store the re- sults are under development. And based on the promising if surprising results of recent experi- ments, biochemistry may become the next me- dium for even faster computation." All digital media are equally capable of producing identi- cal results since their roles lie in abstract sym- bols and not in concrete materials. It is also rel- atively easy to move from one digital medium to another. For example, one can switch from mag- netic to optical disks by connecting the appro- priate disk drive to your computer. Compare this facility with the notorious difficulty in replicat- ing the look of a painting on the printed page of a book. Of course, one cannot store a number without using some kind of physical object. But the sub- stance itself is of secondary importance in a dig- ital medium since numbers are not inherently material entities. Symbols written on paper or on a computer disk are conventional marks es- tablished by a culture to stand for conceptual ob- jects. A number is an abstraction that can be designated in a variety of different symbolic sys- tems. A number symbol is sometimes called a type, while the various individual inscriptions of it are tokens of the type. The symbol type "II" was the Roman way to record the same number referred to by "10" in the binary system used by computers, which is called "2" in many contem- porary languages. Each time someone writes a particular "2" in pencil, chalk, or ink, a new token is created which instances the same sym- bol type. The inscriptions written onto a digital medium as magnetic blips are tokens of number types, albeit tokens that are usually readable only by a machine. And all of these tokens ulti- mately refer to the same concept, the number two. In contrast, the inscriptions made in analog media record physical traces of events that do not betoken concepts. This is true even when they must be played back by a machine to be seen or heard. For example, a video tape player simply transcribes a magnetic analogue of sounds and images to recreate something perceivable, and does not treat the recorded signals as having any symbolic function. The fundamental purpose of an analog medium is to preserve and present specific per- ceptual displays. These two functions coalesce in the material substance of the medium. Even when storage and display activities are sepa- rated-as in the cinema, which dedicates film vaults and movie theaters to each respective function-they are tied together in a celluloid- based liaison neither can escape. You cannot play a videotape in a film projector, and vice versa. To get from film to video, you need a character- istically analog transcription: you need to video- tape the film. In a digital medium, by contrast, the two functions of storing and displaying in- formation are relatively independent. The fun- damental purpose of a digital medium is to keep track of sometimes enormous collections of or- ganized numbers. These numbers need to be ex- hibited somehow to have meaning, but since they are abstractions, they are not endemic to any particular medium of expression. This is why the contents of a digital medium are com- putable, while those of an analog medium are not. Computation is allowed to happen in the in- terstices digital media create between storage and display. A spark of vitality is ignited in these hidden recesses. The reason digital media are able to nurture this force is that they are de- signed to host busy minions rather than to bear enduring marks. Digital media are both more temporary and more permanent than analog ones. A gessoed canvas and a piece of unexposed film are emp- tied of form as they are prepared to receive an imprint and hold it forever, as best they can re- sist the ravages of time. The analog medium is stripped of irregularity and sensitized to pertur- bation. A canvas can be overpainted or scraped, but it is not intended for repeated use, and once a piece of film is exposed, there is no turning back. But a digital medium is designed precisely to be used over and over again. Instead of being primed as a tabula rasa, it is preformatted with a rigid structure into which any stored informa- tion must be received. A digital medium is an imposing edifice where fresh digits are repeat- edly entertained in assigned locations, much as theater seats receive different theatergoers for each performance. Digital information can be shuttled in and out of a computer with astonish- ing speed and accuracy. Yet despite this es- sentially changeable nature, digital media are paradoxically more, rather than less, resilient. Since they store tokens of numbers rather than</page><page sequence="5">Binkley The Vitality of Digital Creation 111 traces of events, digital images are more imper- vious to the vicissitudes that assail analog im- ages. A few scribbles across the surface of a can- vas will significantly mar its aesthetic qualities, but similar scrawls over a ledger of numbers will not generally affect its utility. Provided the num- bers can still be discerned from their tokens, no information is lost. This is also why there is no "generation loss" in making copies of digital in- formation. Every time a copy is made of an ana- log image, the succeeding copy depends for its fidelity upon the accuracy of transcription. In- variably, some details are lost with each genera- tion, so that after repeated copying the original image has deteriorated. But copying informa- tion from a digital medium does not take place by transcription, by making imprints of im- prints. To copy a digital file, the numbers are read and inscribed anew each time. So each copy, even if it is several generations away from the original, is still an "original" inscription of the information. This does not make digital media impervious to error, it just means that the possible errors are of a different type, namely errors of reading and writing rather than of tran- scribing. It turns out that processing tokens of numbers by computer can be done with consid- erably more accuracy than mechanically or manually replicating traces of events. This is not surprising since discerning a number from a symbol is much easier than matching the color of a swatch.12 Creations in digital media really have no original against which copies can be compared. In this respect, they are quite differ- ent even from the traditional media of literature and music, which use extensive symbolic sys- tems for expression. When writing a novel or a symphony by hand, one produces an original text or score, but this is not so when composing at the keyboard of a computer. Recursive transcription lies at the core of ana- log culture. Most visual information that reaches us in analog media has passed through several layers of transcription. A picture in a book or magazine was transcribed first from an actual event onto a film negative, then onto a film pos- itive, then transcribed again onto an etched printing plate, and finally imprinted onto the page we see. Video signals pass through similar cas- cades of copies to bring a performance from the studio to the home. Modern culture took up res- idence in this echoing theater of mimesis and filled it with the surfeit of images that produced the postmodern crescendo of simulacra. This intrinsic transcriptive nature is perspicu- ously presented in some of Magritte's paintings. His familiar "Human Condition" images capture the elusive epiphany of analog media, where representation and reality become indistin- guishable. But this magic is worked only in the recursive universe of transcription, where the medium of paint is tricked into making a picture of a picture look like the picture itself. Pictures of pictures are a familiar theme throughout the history of art, and they demonstrate the omniv- orous appetite of mimetic media that enabled them to feed on themselves to produce a frenzy of procreation in the modern world. Although the promiscuous proliferation of transcribed vi- sual information has become a wonderful chan- nel for disseminating culture, it has a one-way valve at each analog aperture. Once frozen in a medium, the image is trapped and can only go deeper into mimesis. This is one reason why, al- though analog media are adept at transporting likenesses of their subjects, they cannot reverse the direction to bring viewers any closer. Digital media are able to do this because they do not transcribe, and hence do not recurse in the process of recording information. Information is immediately converted when it enters the dig- ital universe. That conversion process can only be performed once: you can measure a table, but you cannot then measure the measurement. You might measure a measuring tape to check its ac- curacy, but this is no way to replicate the digital information it produces. Once converted from percepts into concepts, from material into num- bers, information is freed from the infinite regress of transcription and may travel back and forth between the user and the used. Computer algorithms often use recursion, but it is mathe- matical rather than physical and serves a com- pletely different purpose that is transactional rather than presentational. By abandoning phys- ical recursion devoted to the service of imper- sonal dissemination, digital media become ca- pable of carrying on individual dialogues with each one of us. Digital media are adept at storing vast collec- tions of numbers, and computers are adroit at manipulating them. But the arcane tokens of these thinking machines are incomplete by themselves. Since concepts are not appearances,</page><page sequence="6">112 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism the curious digital image is unfulfilled without a transformation of numbers into percepts. To get visual information into the computer and onto a digital medium, we require a conversion from objects to numbers. To get it back out again, the converse conversion is needed. Even if our in- terest is primarily in numbers-say for pecu- niary purposes-machine-readable tokens must be translated into human-readable ones be- fore we can comprehend them. These conver- sion processes are usually carried out by spe- cialized pieces of hardware called (oddly enough) converters. There are analog-to-digital converters for input, and digital-to-analog con- verters for output. They typically form the heart of an interface, which consists of a hard- ware/software system for automatically and swiftly moving information back and forth be- tween people and computers (or sometimes be- tween two different machines). The canonical output interface found in most graphics comput- ers takes numbers stored in a specialized por- tion of memory called a frame buffer, and con- verts them into a video image on a monitor. But there are myriad other interfaces for changing numbers into pictures, from printers to cameras to looms. Some interfaces output numbers as pigment on paper, others as photographic film, still others as pen drawings. There are also a host of nonvisual interfaces that turn numbers into sounds or movements. In addition, a variety of converse interface apertures admit numbers abstracted from events. The most common input channels currently in use are the keyboard and the mouse. Scanners and digitizing tablets are also frequently found in graphics settings. As a result of this dependence on interfaces, digital media augment rather than undermine their analog forbears. Although they posses much vigor, computers by themselves have no power. Their vivacious missives remain ever mute without interfaces to the comfortable ana- log media we sentient creatures know and un- derstand. Herein lies another conundrum centering on the identity of a digital image. Its defining essence is a numerical file; yet its specific ap- pearance can vary depending upon the output method that converts these numbers into colors. So while an array of numbers fixes a digital image's identity, they do not fully delimit how it will appear. Many of its detailed aesthetic qual- ities are prescribed by the interface used to out- put it, and no single one has any priority in es- tablishing the correct appearance. When any computer artist creates his works at a computer, he views the images on a cathode ray tube, the "computer screen" that currently functions as the canonical visual output. There they are dis- played as colors of light emitted by glowing phosphor. But if he chooses to output these im- ages as silk-screens, they become pigment- based works with a quite different appearance. Which one is the digital image? Both and nei- ther. The numbers function as the foundation of a visual construct, but they do not completely dictate its appearance. There is no privileged output; all are equally derivative from and de- pendent upon the digital source. Of course, the artist may choose to present the images only as silk-screens, in which case the computer be- comes a tool in the service of an analog medium. But increasingly, creators of digital art are trans- mitting files for interaction as well as display by users on their own computers and output devices over which the artist has no control. The digital image has a virtual existence. It is intangible and invisible, yet we can perceive it through interface portals that change its kernel of numbers into visual presentations. We have heard a great deal about "virtual reality" in the popular press, which revels in describing the fantasy potential of immersive systems. These elaborate paraphernalia encase the user in a co- coon of goggles, gloves, earphones, and a body- suit that propel her into a full somatic experience of virtual universes, complete with monstrous ad- versaries and teleported lovers. 13 Yet the virtual- ity of such experience emerges not from the ex- pensive hardware haberdashery, but from the humble abode of nimble digits. Numbers are the original virtual reality. They are timeless ab- stractions which nevertheless have a profound impact on everyday life as they guide us in building houses and bridges, as well as in de- stroying them. Any time we work with a digi- tally represented universe inside a computer, we are having an experience of the virtual reality mensurated therein. Even when we peer into the small screen of a personal computer, the denizens we encounter there-from T-squares to ninja turtles-are all virtual creatures open to our en- treaties. There are two kinds of "reality" in virtuality.</page><page sequence="7">Binkley The Vitality of Digital Creation 113 One is called the image space, which tends to be lodged in the frame buffer; the other is called the object space, which is distributed less specif- ically throughout the computer's general pur- pose memory. The image space is usually an array of numbers organized as representatives of picture elements, or pixels, which are the in- dividual colored dots of a digital image. Each pixel has a corresponding location in memory where its current color value is stored. The canonical interface converts that number into a color on a video monitor, which is usually spec- ified in terms of its primary components: red, green, and blue. In addition to the virtual images that reside in a computer's image space, it is also possible to conjure up virtual objects which are described by their virtual "physical" properties, such as height, weight, and color. They might also be specified in much more general ways by associ- ating them with mathematical formulae or algo- rithmic instructions that tell the computer how to generate them. Fantastic as well as familiar geographies can be created algorithmically from general instructions rather than by specifying each component separately, as a landscape painter does. Plants can be grown in the com- puter on the basis of parameters set by the artist rather than meticulously painted leaf by leaf. And animals can be evolved from virtual genetic information rather than delineated through indi- vidual physical traits. 14 Once conjured up in the computer's object space, a virtual camera can be commanded to take pictures of these strange new universes and transmit them to the image space which is our portal for peering into virtual reality. III. THE INTERACTIVITY OF COMPUTER SIMULATIONS The virtual reality hovering among ciphers hosted by a digital medium is more ephemeral than the pictorial space canonized by Renais- sance painting and automated by photography. But this digital soiree is also strangely more alive since numbers are able to capture the essence rather than the presence of what they represent. Their mensurated subjects are ren- dered more abstract (virtual) than their macu- lated counterparts in analog media, but they are also rendered more real (interactive) since they can become aware of your presence and respond to you. Because they exist as numbers, they can be continuously subjected to computation based on user input. Once deposited for delectation in solidified swirls of pigment, the analogously depicted world is a static one. A photograph traps the trails left by a fleeting moment in time and im- prisons them in formed matter. These precious objects subsequently follow their own temporal trajectories of potential glory, as well as certain disintegration and decay, despite assiduous care by august institutions. Whatever power the im- ages of these analogized worlds have, it em- anates from frozen apparitions. The transparent window of perspective, for all its lucidity, is nevertheless an impenetrable barrier to our en- treaties. Though the physical objects that medi- ate pictorial space are not entirely impervious to intrusions (which are usually pernicious), their subjects are oblivious to our approach. The openness of pictorial space, despite its in- sularity, is an arduous cultural achievement whose influence is ubiquitous today. Our dis- course in the presence of pictures is often car- ried on as if we were perceiving the robust world they represent rather than a flimsy flat object. Our connection to reality through snapshots and television is familiar, conventional, and appar- ent: we see the face in the image and know the princess is sad. A concomitant belief in the ve- racity of photographs became a cornerstone of modern culture as the transcriptive dispersal of analog imprints permeated our everyday lives. There is no transparent screen between num- bers and pictures. The computerized connection between them is recondite and the numbers themselves remain reclusive. Yet digital uni- verses are oddly more open to us than their anal- ogously rendered forebears. A converse paradox characterizes the inscrutable interface which, despite its perceptual opacity, proffers an open portal inviting us to interact with creatures mys- teriously lodged inside a small gray box. The computer can sense our presence and track our movements. Through a variety of input devices, measurements of our activities can be transmit- ted into a computer, lodged in a digital medium, cogitated mathematically to formulate a re- sponse, and the results output to us. We can en- gage a computer-mediated universe in a contin- uous dialogue. Out of this discourse, we can</page><page sequence="8">114 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism generate convincing pictures that confuse and lie, as well as gripping games that thrill and edify. Digital media are incomplete and useless without an interface to convert them to and from our perceivable world. But they are also unful- filled without a computer to enliven them. They deliver us partners, and not merely pictures. Computers use formulas and numbers in order to simulate environments we can inhabit. In so doing, they do not display before us representa- tions in the traditional sense, but invite us to enter the alternative realities of virtual universes. The computer is not a medium. It transcends media since it uses material symbolically rather than analogically, making its digital representa- tions vital and active. While feverishly manipu- lating tokens, its purpose is to invigorate ab- stractions, and not to sculpt substance. The presence preserved in an analog medium is, by contrast, desiccated and passive. At best, it transports a trace of previous vitality by re- presenting it in a material transcription. But the computed environment makes the representa- tion and the viewer mutually present to each other. The characters residing in a virtual world can receive your missives and semaphores, and respond in like manner. In many ways, the experience feels more like having the subject before us than her mere representation. In discussing the power images can work on us, Freedberg suggests that "response is based on attempted reconstitution of the life of repre- sented form."15 This ancient vision that in- spired mimetic supplication for centuries is brought much closer to realization in replete digital systems than transitory analog glimpses were ever able to achieve. The vitality of pres- ence, and not merely its visage, is captured by computing machines. Virtual digital existence is not a generically reconstituted likeness or make- believe scenario, but a spontaneously created in- tercourse with an individual participant.16 Interactive virtual realities have already found many applications, both practical and pure. One of the earliest and most extensive uses was in flight simulation designed to give student pilots veridical training more safely and inex- pensively than actual flight. As a consequence of their success, much of the funding that pro- moted the early development of interactive computer systems came from the military. But the technology has now become affordable enough to appear in information kiosks at art museums and shopping malls that help visitors navigate and learn. It has also become a stan- dard resource in most design studios, and even shows up in fine art ateliers. The computing assistant initially emulated traditional tools, in much the way cinema first copied the stage. These virtual tools quickly be- came popular, especially in commercial set- tings, because they are faster, cheaper, and more versatile than their manual predecessors. In the second half of the 1980s, the field of graphic de- sign was revolutionized by computers as art di- rectors discovered their cost effectiveness. The computer can instantly draw a straight line or a perfect circle, and just as easily undraw it and change it at the whim of a client. Since the in- formation is virtual, it is infinitely malleable; and since it is computable, it is tirelessly re- sponsive. The virtual environment is circum- scribed by logical rather than physical limits. In- deed, one of the dangers of using computers is that they provide so much flexibility and for- giveness that it is easy to become engulfed in a mesmerizing odyssey of endless tinkering. The pitfalls of working in a virtual studio adumbrate whole new genres of artistic risk. Because they perform in a virtual theater, computers have parted the curtain on a kind of pageantry unapproachable by analog media. Some of these spectacles are the special effects we frequently see in television commercials and in films such as Terminator II or Kurosawa's Dreams. But the most dramatic new player on the cultural stage is the interactive experience found in gallery installations and home comput- ers as well as the Internet. Interactivity epito- mizes the unique contribution computers are making to our culture. Some fine artists have begun presenting works that literally engage us by offering unique and personal encounters with a virtual universe. In 1986, Grahame Wein- bren and Roberta Friedman created one of the first major interactive works, The Erl King, which allows the user to navigate through a cin- ematic world based loosely on the legend, but expanding out from it into psychoanalysis and pop music. Jeffrey Shaw created a very different kind of work in The Legible City (1989), which offers the participant a real bicycle to ride through virtual cities. His computerized metrop- olises are based on real cities, such as New York</page><page sequence="9">Binkley The Vitality of Digital Creation 115 and Amsterdam, but letters from a text, with their heights appropriately adjusted, replace the build- ings.17 The computer is now beginning to revolution- ize the entertainment industry as sales of multi- media titles surpass box office receipts. Because the computer is not allied with any particular medium, it interfaces to all of them with a facility that gives us broad and rapid access to informa- tion for both fun and profit. Interactive computer games have achieved great popularity through their lively combination of fantasy and action. And digital versions of encyclopedias and other databases are superseding their printed counter- parts because of the vastness of their contents and the swiftness of access to specific details. The possibilities of interactive art have only begun to be explored. And the overall enhance- ment of our ability to visualize is having a pro- found impact on science as well as art. Whole new vistas of science and mathematics are opened up by looking through the portal of a computer into a virtual universe. The general holistic thrust of digital representation encom- passes the barriers between art and science, which weaken as our art gets imbued with num- bers and our science gets advanced by art. Virtual reality is both more and less real than analog representations. But we are being chal- lenged to rethink the reality/representation dis- tinction. Our sense of reality is-paradoxi- cally-a concept. It is an idea that has been formed by the history of our representations, and not vice versa. Ian Hacking sums it up this way: Reality is an anthropomorphic creation. Reality may be a human creation, but it is no toy; on the contrary it is the second of human creations. The first pecu- liarly human invention is representation. Once there is a practice of representing, a second-order concept follows in train. This is the concept of reality, a con- cept which has content only when there are first- order representations.1 8 So our sense of reality is determined in large measure by the scope of our representations. By comparison with traditional analog representa- tions, digital representations are virtual since they are embodied in abstract numbers rather than in concrete objects.19 But they are also comparatively real, since they can possess a re- sponsiveness unavailable to analog pictures. Digital representation is forcing us to reconsider what is real and what is not. For lack of a better word, we call computers machines, even as they harbor a vitality previ- ously limited to living organisms. Thinking ma- chines elicit strong emotions of both fear and ex- citement. Grandiose visions of a divine digital democracy carry high hopes and sweet dreams that undoubtedly will never be realized, or will be degraded and abused. And the moralistic homi- lies about a sinister big brother may shroud the makings of a different kind of culture. Amidst the emotions is an underlying reality which intimates fundamental changes in the way culture is prac- ticed and preserved. No one can know yet pre- cisely where the "digital revolution" will lead, but the better we understand its nature, the better we will be able to deal with it and to direct it toward fair and humane purposes. We are facing a daunt- ing phalanx of practical and philosophical ques- tions about access, privacy, copyright, and a host of other issues that are demanding our attention. Since ancient times, things and ideas have been separated. Compare Praxatiles's Aphrodite with Euclid's Elements. One is an expressive and inspiring material object subject to the on- slaughts of people and weather. This does not prevent it from conveying ideas as well as emo- tions. The other is an intellectual construct im- pervious to sticks and stones, but nevertheless dependent in some way upon objects to survive, and capable of arousing sublime feelings. Mar- ble is chipped and worn, eaten by acid as it is pummeled by rain. Theorems are pristine as the day they were conceived, and they will remain that way forever. Yet they are both passive cul- tural products spawned by a human agency that deposited them in the annals of history. And now the distinction between them is not so clear as our creations become agents.

Integrated Services Digital Network (or ISDN) was made available throughout France beginning in 1987 and is now widely used in other countries. ISDN is a system for rapid transmission of digital information over standard phone lines. Fiber optic networks with much greater capac- ity are now being implemented in many locations, particu- larly in Japan, and they are the main focus of the "Informa- tion Superhighway" currently being promoted in the United States by government and industry alike. 4. The "bandwidth" of a communication channel is sim- ply a measure of the amount of information it can convey in a fixed amount of time. Standard telephone lines that use electrical signals have a relatively low bandwidth that is in- sufficient to transmit motion pictures, although it is per- fectly adequate for voice communications. Optical fibers employ light rather than electricity to transport information, and as a result have a high bandwidth capable of transmit- ting several motion pictures simultaneously. 5. The debate over the limits of artificial intelligence epit- omizes the often confusing efforts to make sense of "think- ing machines." See John R. Searle, Paul M. Churchland, and Patricia Smith Churchland, 'Artificial Intelligence: A Debate," Scientific American 262 (January 1990): 26-38. Some of the greatest fears and highest hopes are aroused by visions of a thoroughly computerized future. One of the most provocative scenarios is sketched by Hans Moravec in Mind Children: The Future of Robot and Human Intelli- gence (Harvard University Press, 1988). For a well-articu- lated alternative viewpoint, see John Searle, The Rediscov- ery of the Mind (MIT Press, 1992). 6.

Even if the artwork is an abstract painting, its analog medium still stores at least traces of the artist's gestures, analogues of which are inscribed onto the canvas. 11. See Leonard M.
