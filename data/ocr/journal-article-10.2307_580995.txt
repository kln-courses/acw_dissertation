<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGICAL REPORTS FOR 1969-70 ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1969-1970 The main archaeological news of this year is from Attica; a remarkable series of discoveries in the neighbourhood of Marathon, and the discovery by the American excavators of the Agora of the Stoa Basileios, in the second year of their resumed excava- tions. Reports of these discoveries will be found in their appropriate place below. During the year 1969 and the beginning of 1970 two volumes of the Chronika (Chr) of the Archaeologikon Deltion (ADelt) have appeared (23, Chr I and 2) covering the year 1967. In addition, at the time of writing (July 1970), three more fascicules of AAA have appeared (1969, 2 and 3, and 1970, i), while the Ergon of the Archaeological Society for the year 1969, and two volumes of the Archaeologiki Ephemeris (AE), for 1968 and 1969 respectively, have been published. It is on these publications that the present summary is based for reports of Greek excavators, while for the excavations of the foreign Schools I am once more deeply indebted to the Directors of the Schools and to the leaders of excavations for their cooperation in providing reports and photographs for publication. Readers should note that the most important dis- coveries of 1967-69 were already made known in AAA 1968 and 1969, and consequently included from that source in AR 1968-69; the republication of the discoveries of 1967 in ADelt, 23, I and 2, is not recorded in this issue, since the account in ADelt can easily be discovered. With the anticipation in AAA of the reports hitherto confined to ADelt the other reports in ADelt are now of a more routine nature and the amount of material reproduced from that source is therefore less than in previous years. On the occasion of the Second International Con- gress of South-East European Studies, the Greek National Committee has issued a series of biblio- graphies of articles in Greek in various fields. Of archaeological interest are particularly: Bibliographie hellinique de la Prihistoire (1945-69), compiled under the supervision of Professor N. Platon, and Biblio- graphie d'Archdologie grecque, ipoque hellinique (I945- 69), by Vanna Hadjimichali and Maro Tsoni. ATHENS AND ATTICA National Museum. V. Kallipolites reports on the re-alignment of the Sounion Kouros (E.M. 2720) by N. Perantinos, on the continued work of restoration on the Peiraeus bronzes found in 1959, and on the bronze statuettes found at Ambelokepoi in 1964 (Dionysos, Poseidon, bust of Sarapis; cf. ADelt 20 [1965] Chr I, 103-7) (ADelt 23 Chr I, 8-io). Hadrian's Library. A large-scale cleaning and re- arrangement and restoration of the Library of Hadrian has taken place. The remains of the internal rooms, and the walls of the external apses and other structures have been strengthened and cleaned (ADelt 23 Chr I, 18-I9). Acropolis. A fragment of an archaic column- dedication of c. 500 B.c. rescued from a pile of marbles behind the Acropolis Museum, is published by G. Dontas (AAA 1969, 2, 157-8). Agora. Mr Leslie Shear Jr. has kindly provided the following note on the Excavations of 1970 in the Athenian Agora. 'The systematic extension of the Agora Excavations to the north of the Athens- Piraeus Electric Railway was begun in the spring of 197o, and the present season will continue through August. After careful exploration of the Turkish and Byzantine remains, these were removed to make way for the excavation of the Classical levels. Among other monuments of the classical city, the new excavations have brought to light the remains of the Stoa Basileios, or Royal Stoa, which served as the seat and office of the King Archon. The new stoa lies at the north-west corner of the market square, just at the intersection of the Panathenaic Way and the western street of the Agora and is thus the northernmost of the row of public buildings lining the west side of the square. The identification may be regarded as certain. The topographical position of the building corres- ponds perfectly with Pausanias' statement (i 3- 1-3) that the Royal Stoa was the first building on the right of one entering the Agora along the Panathenaic Way. This is corroborated by an independent line of evidence. The lexicographers, under their entry on herms, record that in the Agora these peculiarly Athenian dedications were to be found extending from the Stoa Basileios and the Stoa Poikile. In the small enclosure in front of the new stoa some 18 fragments of herms have been found. Several of these are the inscribed bases in which the shafts stood, and the dedicatory inscriptions show that they were set up by King Archons. Two of the inscribed herm bases, dedicated by Kings, still stand in situ on the steps of the stoa. The two most surprising features of the new build- ing are its small size and its early date. The tiny structure measures 17 75 m. in length and 7- 18 m. in width. In plan it exhibits the simplest form of stoa with a colonnade of 8 Doric columns along its fagade, and its rear and ends enclosed with walls of fine ashlar masonry. On the interior a row of four Doric columns was arranged along the axis of the building. There is clear evidence that a bench lined the walls on three sides (Fig. x). Doric capitals were recovered from the exterior and interior orders, and their style and profiles suggest a date for the original construction of the stoa about the middle of the sixth century B.c. This date is</page><page sequence="2">4 P. M. FRASER FIG. I supported also by ceramic evidence from the original foundation packing within the building. The stoa was evidently severely damaged in the Persian destruc- tion of Athens in 480 B.C., but it must have been rebuilt along its original lines very shortly after the destruction. In the reconstruction a good deal of old material was brought in from the ruins of neigh- bouring buildings and reused at second hand in the Royal Stoa. The bases which supported the four in- terior columns were found actually to be archaic Doric column capitals which had been cut down for re-use. It was evident that the little stoa had originally only two internal columns, that number being increased to four only in the reconstruction of the build- ing. About the end of the fifth or the beginning of the fourth century B.c. two light porches were added one at each end of the stoa, projecting eastward rather like the wings of the neighbouring Stoa of Zeus. These seem to have been designed for the display of large marble stelai for which slots were provided in the stylobates of the porches. The stoa and the annexes in particular show signs of numerous small alterations throughout antiquity which indicate that the building continued in use at least until the Herulian raid of A.D. 267.' City Area. Miss O. Alexandri publishes in AAA 1969, 2, 257-66, the contents of a family tomb- peribolos of the early sixth century found in 1968 in the Kerameikos area between Achilleos and Kon- stantinoupoleos Streets, and thus close to the Demo- sion Sema. Sculpture found includes several female figures, and a couchant lion. Further work on the proteichisma and moat of the city wall in Nikis Street in 1968 brought to light among the material thrown into the moat when it was filled up after Sulla's sack, a group of funerary monuments of the second half of the fourth century belonging to the family of Aristocles of Melite, and consisting of two stelae and a marble loutrophoros with an unusual representation of a cavalry en- counter in which the dead man, the son of Aristocles, took part (Fig. 2) (AAA 1969, 3, 329-34). The Archaeological Service under Miss O. Alexandri undertook some 8o rescue op- erations within the city area in 1967. New light was thrown on the course of the city wall and, in the outer Kerameikos, on the Demosion Sema, and numerous sections of ancient cemeteries of all periods from the Sub-Mycenaean were also discovered. At- tention may be drawn to three of these operations: (i) (No. 48). In Lekka Street (south-west of Syntagma Square), a large complex of buildings (40 X 58 m.) was uncovered, enclosing all periods from the Classic to the Byzantine, of which the Byzantine structure rested on the ruins of the earlier buildings, of which five phases can be detected. Among the ruins were dis- covered two uncompleted marble female statues (Fig. 3 a,b) of the early fifth century, possibly intended for a temple, work on which may have been interrupted by the Persian invasion; a r.f. kylix of c. 550 B.C., which will be separately published; and two statue bases of Augustus, each inscribed AV-ToKpdTopo0 / Kal'apog Oeoi5 / V5o5 ZeflaatoT (Fig. 4). (2) (No. 87). In Christou Lada Street, a further section of the proteichisma of the city FIG. 2</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1969-70 5 FIG. 3 wall was discovered, in a region where its course is adequately known. (3) (No. 65). In Piraeus Street, work was continued on the large ceme- tery, already partially explored in previous years, and about forty burials from the late Geometric to the Classical period (the majority) were exca- vated. The cemetery contained both cremations and interments, the former in the form of pyres in pits; the burials were either in simple or tile-covered pits, or cist-graves, with three in larnakes. The graves of the Archaic and Classical periods were well furnished with vases (especially b.f., w.g. and r.f. lekythi), terracotta and other objects (ADelt 23 Chr I, 33-99)- Kerameikos. The work of the German Institute in 1967 was concentrated on the area of the Eridanos FIG. 5 channel, where the collection of 4,000 ostraka was found in 1966, outside the Dipylon Gate. Part of a Hellenistic water-course and of a naiskos resting on earlier walls and foundations were uncovered in front of the city-moat (ADelt 23 Chr I, 29-32). The material from the German excavations of the Necropolis of the late eighth to early sixth century has been published by K. Kuibler (Kerameikos, VI/2 Berlin, 1970). In AE 1968, Arch. Chron. 8-52, D.-U. Schilardi publishes a report of the excavation in 1961 by the late J. Threpsiades of the area on the edge of the Plateia Eleutherias, i.e. just north of the city-wall. The main discoveries were from classical pit-graves of the period from 470 to the early fourth century B.c. A large pi-shaped funerary monument had been built very early in the fourth century in the area, partly above one tomb; the horos-stone of the grave is inscribed Hdpo;/Me)atvt/12H . . . (Fig. 5; there is uncertainty about the interpretation of 1. 3). A sub- stantial structure of Classical date was also discovered, but its function is not clear. Schilardi discusses (PP. 34 ff.) the topography of this part of the outer Kerameikos, and the precise location of the 'Erian Gates', and in this connection publishes a report by Miss V. Grace of an excavation carried out by her in 1936 in Lenormant Street. Eleusis. A section of the Sacred Way between the bridge over the Cephisus and the entrance to the FIG. 4</page><page sequence="4">6 P. M. FRASER sanctuary has been uncovered for a length of 38 m. (AAA 1969, 3, 323-9). Minor excavations of 1967 are reported in ADelt 23 Chr I, Io4-I09. Marathon. The dramatic discoveries at Marathon in winter and spring of 1969-70, and the investiga- tions of Professor Marinatos and his assistants, have focused archaeological interest on this area. The following brief note is based on Professor Marinatos' preliminary report in AAA, on his subsequent reports to the Press, and on visits to the sites. FIG. 6 Four separate locations are involved: (i) a large settlement at Plasi, a low hill on the coast some 500 m. north of the Mound. This consists of (a) an archaic peribolos of polygonal stones, possibly belong- ing to a shrine (Fig. 6), and (b) nearby, a Middle Helladic settlement. Sherds found are of all periods from Neolithic to Classical and later. The remains FIG. 7 of the peribolos were already noted in the last century, and associated with the Deme of Marathon. (ii) West of the main Marathon-Kato Souli road, at the entrance to the Vrana valley, c. 200 m. from the main road, in a location called Tsepi Vrana, a large EH cemetery containing carefully arranged and well built cist-graves in rectangular enclosures formed by a single row of homogeneous stones (Fig. 7). (iii) A few hundred metres further up the valley, on the right bank of the water-course, and opposite the chapel of Hagios Georgios of Vrana, a group of four FIG. 8 grave-circles consisting of paved slabs, each about 17 m. across, each circle containing stone-built tombs of MH date; the best preserved of the grave-circles contained a complex of chamber tombs within the inner circle (Fig. 8: early stage of excavation). The discovery of the skeleton of a horse in a separate tomb in this MH complex has aroused great inter- est. (iv) about ioo m. east of the grave-circles a large tumulus constructed entirely of stones and containing two circles of pit-graves (Fig. 9). Eleven graves have so far been found, and the skeletons have been classified by Professor Breitinger of Vienna as those of young men between 20 and 30 years of age, except for one of about 40, and one child of about 12 years of age. The pottery found in the graves is contemporary with that found in the Athenian Soros (b.f. lekythi, skyphi, two loutrophori), and Professor Marinatos has identified the tomb as that of the Plataeans who fell at Marathon, and which Pausanias records as a separate mem- orial. Work has only begun on all these outstanding sites, and future discoveries are eagerly awaited (AAA 1970, i, 63-68; Akropolis, 24 January 1970 (Plasi); Bema, 3 May 1970 (Tomb of Plataeans), Io June 1970 (Tomb of Plataeans) ; Eleutheros Kosmos, I I July 1970, p. 5 (general)). Megara. Miss O. Alexandri reports on the increase to our knowledge of the wall- system and necropoleis of Megara as a result of building operations etc. in the town (AAA 1970, i, 21-9). The excavation of several individual building plots in 1967 brought to light mostly the remains of Late Hellenistic</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1969-70 7 and Roman structures (ADelt 23 Chr I, 1oo-4). Miss Y. Nicopoulou reports the discovery of a necro- polis in the neighbourhood of Mt. Gerania, containing FIG. 9 70 burials, mostly of Classical and post-Classical date, but including one proto-Corinthian grave, with among other vases, a fine cotyle-crater (Fig. io) (AAA 1969, 3, 339-42). Aegina. City. Professor Dr H. Walter writes as follows: 'In 1969 the area west and south of the temple of Apollo were excavated in depth. In the lowest layers, on bed rock, EH house walls and a workshop with ovens, probably connected with metal workings, were found. Below this was a layer containing a fortified settlement of EH date, of which the south- west and the south entrance gate of the eastern defence wall were cleared. The destruction of this settlement, indicated by a burnt layer on the floors of the inner rooms, evidently occurred in EH times. The settlement was not abandoned after the destruc- tion: the damaged walls were modernized and im- proved and the entrance altered. Subsequently these eastern walls were repeatedly repaired and towers and outer walls added. North-east of the temple a late Roman wall of re-used stones, many inscribed, was uncovered; some of the building material comes from an archaic poros building.' Temple of Aphaia. In spring 1969, the German excavations under Dr D. Ohly were concentrated on the area immediately below the north supporting wall of the terrace of the late archaic temenos, and the supporting wall itself. The rocky area north of the temenos was covered with a late fill which contained a number of poros blocks from the terrace wall and also some fragments of the marble sculpture of the late archaic temple. In the inner fill of the north terrace wall itself, which was fully removed, numerous fragments of the older archaic temple were dis- covered, many with well preserved polychromy: frag- ments include monolith columns covered with white FIG. IO also traces of a later destruction which may have been caused by the troubles of the time of Mithridates (ADelt 23 Chr I, 227-34). (2) The Greco-Swiss excavations of 1967 under K. Schefold are described in detail in ADelt 23 Chr I, 235-42 and Antike Kunst, I I, 1968, 91 ff. The archaic fortification beneath the West Gate was further investigated, and the two stages of construction clarified; south of the West Gate, work on the drain system, the covering of which consists largely of re-used tombstones, partially cleared in 1966, was completed, and shown to be linked with the large 'South Building', and the South Building itself was cleared and shown to consist of about twenty rooms grouped round two peristyle courts stucco, capitals, parts of the architraves of the outer (white stucco with red taenia and black regula) and inner (white stucco with red taenia and green regula) orders, large triglyphs and metopes of the outer order, and many other fragments. The earlier archaic temple, probably built c. 570 and destroyed by fire c. 520-10 B.C., and standing on the same site as its successor, was a monumental peripteros with tall columns, an architrave in two stages, and a depth of pediment of 33 cm.; its krepis, like that of its successor, stood on bed rock on the east and on a high foundation on the west, which remained visible. Euboea. Eretria. (I) Exploration of building plots in the area of the ancient city by A. Liangouras continued in 1967. More traces of the destruction- level of 490 B.C. were identified in archaic structures at different points in the town (esp. plot no. i). In one plot (no. 4, partially excavated in 1966: see AR 1968- 69 8) a large number of burials ranging from the seventh to the fifth century was found, in which 'double' urn burials (two vases containing the bones placed mouth to mouth) were frequent in the earliest period, while later tile-covered pit-burials pre- dominated. A more detailed publication of this material is promised. Liangouras points out that in addition to the destructions of 490 and 198, there are</page><page sequence="6">8 P. M. FRASER (Fig. I3); the building seems to have existed with various modifications from the fourth to the second century B.c. North of the West Gate a trial trench brought to light part of a well built archaic wall, and near it, a burnt deposit containing numerous terra- cottas of the fourth century and early Hellenistic periods. Summary accounts of some aspects of the campaign of 1968 will be found in Antike Kunst, 12, 1969, 72-8, which also contains a study by P. Bruneau of the mosaic of the Iseum discovered by Papadakis in 1914, and a discussion by D. Knoepfler of the acropolis. The final reports of the excavations have started to appear: Eretria, Fouilles et Recherches I, P. Auberson, Temple d'Apollon Daphniehoros (Berne 1968); II, I. R. Metzger, Die hellenistische Keramik in Eretria (1969); III, Cl. B&amp;rard, L'Hgr6on d la porte de l'ouest (in the press). FIG. II (3) In AE 1969, 143-78, P. Themelis publishes a series of studies of isolated problems of Eretrian history and topography including (a) the location of and evidence for Mycenaean Eretria; (b) Eretrian topography and the evidence of Strabo for 'old' and 'new' Eretria, and (c) the Eretrian tribes, together with (d) an account of his excavation of a building plot in the city, with reference to Eretrian topography, and (e) an index of identified buildings in Eretria. (4) In AE 1969, 170-6, Themelis publishes an account of a trial excavation carried out by him in 1968 in the north-east sector of Eretria, on the west side of the marsh. In the mud and below the later levels obsidian blades and hand-turned EH II and III sherds were found, and also traces of walls of the same period, which are the first architectural remains of that period recovered in Eretria. Lefkandi. The excavations of the British School at Lefkandi, Euboea, in 1969 lasted from 9th June to 5th July and, as in previous years, were directed by the Assistant Director, Mr M. R. Popham and Mr L. H. Sackett. Mr Popham writes: 'The season's work was intended as a 'clearing-up' operation prior to the final publication of the main 1964-66 excavations and had definite outstanding problems in mind; these concerned two areas, the main occupation site on the hill 'Xeropolis' and the cemetery and possible subsidiary occupation area near the village of Lefkandi. The problems it was hoped to solve and the actual results of the excavations were as follows: 'Xeropolis'. (i) to excavate an additional small area of Trench CC to check the stratigraphy of the Early and Middle Helladic levels which had been rather quickly excavated in the previous season; it was hoped to clear one trench down to bed rock all over. This was achieved, though it took three, instead of the expected one, weeks. The material has yet to be studied, but it looks as though it confirms the general development suggested in the Preliminary Report. At least three EH III building phases were dis- tinguished, the earliest lying on the bed rock which had been cut with runnels and post holes. Some fragments of 'frying pans' suggest some possible over- lap with EH II, and the larger sample of material now obtained of the earliest material will contribute con- siderably towards a better definition of the develop- ment of the pottery. A further LH II grave with three vases was found dug down into the upper MH levels. (ii) to investigate the LH IIIB and the earliest IIIC levels in Trench LL to allow the difference between the two phases of pottery to be more pre- cisely defined. Unfortunately the trial trench hit a complex of IIIB walls including an apparent road- way, so the quantity of material collected was not as great as hoped. Moreover, the area appeared to have been levelled by the IIIC occupants so the latest IIIB levels may well have been removed. A preliminary study of this IIIB pottery suggests it is of the regular type and that it differs considerably from that of the earliest IIIC on the site. For the first time LH IIIC walls were found belonging to an earlier stage than the Phase I complex. These were associated with a type of carinated bowl which only occurs at this stage. Of considerable interest was the finding in these earliest IIIC levels of parts of two hand-made Mycenaean ones. It is possible that these indicate the arrival of some non-Mycenaean newcomers. (iii) at least three building phases were dis- tinguished in the Early Bronze Age III levels, the earliest lying on the bed rock which had been cut with tunnels and post holes. A few fragments of 'sauceboats' and 'frying pans' suggest a possible over- lap with EH II, but contamination, perhaps from the contents of disintegrated mud bricks, is shown by the presence, out of context, of some Late Neolithic sherds. (iv) to extend Trenches IV/V to define the size of the LH IIIC rooms of Phase I and to recover more vases from the destruction deposit there. Consider- able extension of the area failed to find the fourth wall of the two rooms though more vases were found on the floors. On the last day of the dig a slit trench was dug along the line of the existing walls which revealed that the length of one room was 8 m. and the other nearly 7-50 m.</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1969-70 9 (v) to extend Trial W in the hope of finding more LH IIIC, Phase II, material including pictorial sherds which were previously found in this area. Some more fragments of the 'lion crater' were re- covered and the room defined but the expected deposit of Phase II material was not forthcoming. The uppermost floors and walls in this area, the date of which had been in some doubt, were shown to be Protogeometric. Near Lefkandi Village. (vi) to attempt to find the settlement associated with the Sub-Mycenaean and Protogeometric cemetery. A test in a field near the hillock overlooking the sea, called 'Toumba', instead of finding the settlement suggested by the surface sherds, revealed another cemetery. In the small area investigated, 19 tombs and one pyre were found. In general the tombs are later than those of the 'Skoubris' cemetery, though there is an obvious overlap. Only one tomb resembled the usual 'Skoubris' cist- tombs-with side and cover slabs-the rest were rock-cut shafts with one exception which was con- structed, above the rock, of mud bricks. In general the tombs comprised an oblong to slightly oval, deep rock-cut shaft with a ledge to hold the cover slabs which lay above the cist cut out of the rock. There was one clear case of inhumation (Fig. 12); it was the lower burial in a 'double-decker' tomb; the remainder with one or two doubtful instances were cremation burials, in some cases the FIG. 12 FIG. 13 The most outstanding find was that of a barrel- shaped figurine of a centaur, standing some 35 cm. high (cover picture). It was found together with an animal vase above the cover slabs of a tomb; its head, which was missing, had previously been found inside and below the cover slabs of another tomb. A further tomb, in addition to two amphoras containing cremated bones, produced a 'killed' iron sword and a spearhead; these had been previously placed in the pyre and were partly melted which, in the case of the sword, had preserved the imprint of cloth with which it had been in contact in the fire. Of particular interest among the jewellery were two sets of ear-rings and a gold fibula. Clearly this is an extensive cemetery of which we were able to investigate only a small part. The tombs so far excavated seem to range from the second half of the Protogeometric period into early and possibly middle Geometric times. Skoubris Cemetery (dug in cooperation with the Greek Archaeological Service represented by Mr P. Themelis). (vii) to continue exploration of the cemetery in the field of A. Skoubris, where 25 cist graves and I I pyres had been found in 1964 and 1968. A further 38 tombs of the cist or other types were uncovered together with 8 more pyres. The majority of these were cist tombs of a type similar to those discovered earlier, and containing pottery ranging from Sub-Mycenaean to Geometric. Little new material was found in the pyres. cremated remains being contained in amphoras. In several instances one tomb had been cut into, or overlay, another, and in one case a tomb had been used twice with the burials superimposed. The tomb offerings were in general arrayed in much the same way as in the 'Skoubris' cemetery though there were two instances of 'urn burials' and one case where nearly all the offerings had been placed upon the cover slabs instead of on the floor of the tomb. In all some 70 vases were found, many being kalathoi and lekythoi; among the small finds, 26' were of gold (Fig. 13), and bronze fibulae and gold rings occurred most frequently.</page><page sequence="8">Io P. M. FRASER FIG. 14 Exceptional among the tombs was a large well- constructed cist measuring almost 2 by 0o50 m. and set deep in a rock cutting. This contained a stirrup jar, a triple vase and an amphoriskos, two long shoulder-pins of bronze and fibulae of bronze and iron. The rock cutting had been filled and was sealed by a later deposit of rubbish including many sherds from skyphi with compass-drawn pendent semicircles, possibly originating from a habitation site nearby. A number of tombs were stratified. Two groups of later pottery containing skyphi with pendent semi- circles (Fig. 14) were found in the cemetery, one in an open pit grave, and the other in a rectangular rock-cut pit with heavy marble slabs. This proved to be the richest tomb, containing some 35 objects including several dini, many kalathi, two large bronze fibulae with square catch pins, six gold rings and a fine pyxis with knobbed lid and hatched meander pattern, evidently an Attic Geometric import. Once again no skeleton was found in any tomb, only a few fragments of bone, usually in association with the bronze objects. The most valuable result of the excavation of these additional tombs is the discovery of the local sub- Protogeometric skyphi associated with Attic Geo- metric imports.' Nea Lampsakos. P. Themelis has published a frag- mentary fourth century marble statue of Ganymede being carried off by Zeus, found at Nea Lampsakos, south-east of Chalkis; the statue determines the site of the ancient Harpagion, which Athenaeus (6oi e) says was named from the event (AAA 1969, 2, 163-5). CORINTHIA AND ARGOLIS Isthmia. The University of California under Professor Paul A. Clement continued excavations at Isthmia in 1969, in the area of Towers 9, 1o, 13 and 14, and the north-east gate of the Trans-Isthmus wall (Fig. 15). Further excavation of the archaic ceme- tery at the west end of Kyras Vrisi was not possible. Between Towers 9 and Io on the south wall, outside the wall, fragmentary walls of buildings and part of a road leading to the Fortress Fourth Gate were revealed, and a stretch of a wall along the line of the public road cleared; all these structures appear to belong to the Imperial and Byzantine periods. In the area of Tower 14, in the west wall, an early Roman wall, running west of the latter wall, came to an end south of the Tower; a series of cuttings for a founda- tion trench parallel to the early wall were also dis- covered; associated finds in the fill were of the first and later centuries A.D. On the east face of the Fortress west wall a stairway giving access to the fighting platform was investigated, and amphorae of the Byzantine period found. In the inner face of the section of the wall running south from the south pier of the Roman Arch of the gate in the area of the gate itself, some six graves were cleared, some of which were overrun by the wall; finds were meagre, but indicate late Imperial-early Byzantine dates. The marble-paved roadway through the north-east gate was further investigated westward to the area excavated by Monceaux in 1883; its western end was found c. 13 m. west of the inner face of the transverse blocking wall, and it was further continued as a packed earth and stone road. The marble road, and a 'sub-road' associated with it were constructed of architectural blocks belonging to poros-buildings, column drums, capitals, etc.; one block, seen by Monceaux, was a fragment of a reworked Ionic cornice. One very large block (Fig. x6) extending the whole width of the road proved to be a monu- mental stele set up in honour of Lucius Cornelius Corinthus, a HvOa;5Xrs, by his sons; the well-preserved pedimental stele, 2-83 m. high and c. 0o - 90 m. wide, carries, in addition to a representation of the dead man, a list of the victories won by him inscribed in wreaths; a second paving block turned out to be a pedimental stele carrying a list of the victories of an unnamed athlete, whose victories are again inscribed</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1969-70o 1 within the appropriate wreaths. Latin inscriptions were also discovered in the same road. Corinth. Mr C. K. Williams II, writes: 'In 1969 the University of Texas continued its work in the Roman gymnasium of the ancient city under the direction of Dr James Wiseman. The underground fountain that had been discovered in the 1968 campaign has been further examined (cf. Hesperia XXXVIII, 1969, pp. 75-8). This proves to be an underground spring house with wash basins of the Hellenistic period, later re-used by the Romans, apparently as part of the gymnasium complex. In the later Roman period, and work toward the total republication of the archaic temple of Apollo and its predecessor. The spring excavation of the American School of Classical Studies, directly supervised by the Director of the Corinth Excavations, was limited to the area of the Roman forum. Work was done at the west end of the forum, immediately west of Temples G and H, and also in the temenos of the Sacred Spring and immediately to its south (Hesperia XXXIX, 1970, pp. 1-39). A number of graves ranging from Sub-Mycenaean to Geometric were excavated at the west end of the TRANS- ISTHMUS WALL T- THEATER.

On the north slope of Acrocorinth, Dr N. Bookidis continued excavation in the sanctuary of Demeter and Kore (Hesperia XXXVIII, 1969, pp. 297-310). Excavation continued in the sanctuary until the beginning of November 1969. A long flight of steps with landings at intervals has been revealed stretch- ing up the slope toward the central cult area. The landings appear to have been designed to lie in front of the entrances of the separate buildings which lined the two sides of the stairway. The buildings them- selves vary in plan from single dining rooms with kitchens to structures with several rooms, one of which always was a dining room. Dr H. S. Robinson continued his investigations on the north side of Temple Hill as part of his researches FIG. 16 forum, suggesting that the whole area once was an Early Iron Age burial ground that slowly was sur- planted in the Proto-Corinthian period by domestic structures. In the area of the central forum trenches were dug in order to expose and study the Hellenistic race course. The early track seems to have been changed to its more northwesterly axis in the third quarter of the fourth century B.C. Again this year, as during the 1968 season, many examples of imita- tion Cypriot pottery were found immediately under the fill that was brought in during the construction of the new race course. Investigations in the archaic, classical and Hellen- istic levels underlying the forum have encouraged the theory that the classical agora of Corinth may not lie here, but rather somewhere along the north side of Temple Hill (Hesperia XXXIX, 1970, pp. 32-9).' Mycenae. 'Wace's Citadel House.' Lord William</page><page sequence="10">12 P. M. FRASER Taylour writes as follows: 'Owing to the generosity of the Greek Archaeological Society a final permit was granted in 1969 to complete the work of the 1968 excavation, which had produced such spectacu- FIG. 17 lar but unexpected results. The excavation was carried out under the general supervision of Professor George E. Mylonas. All objectives were successfully completed and new and surprising information was obtained. The finds may be said to equal in impor- FIG. 18 tance those made in 1968. The three unfinished areas were the room with the platforms, the room of the fresco, the room of the ivories. Room with the platforms. This proved, as suspected, to be a very large room. Only the north-west corner had previously been excavated, re- vealing a group of platforms of different sizes and levels. This year further platforms were uncovered along the north side of the room. They formed a series of three long steps that abutted at right angles on to a staircase occupying the east side of the room. This staircase leads up to the store- room, in which the clay figures were found in 1968 (Fig. i7). At the junction of plat- forms and staircase was a wooden column (its outline is clearly preserved), and there were two other columns placed at equal in- tervals to the south and in the same axis. A low dais of rectangular form occupied the centre of the room. It may have been a hearth but no signs of burning were found on it. On the platform nearest the staircase a female figure of clay about o - 60 m. high was uncovered (Fig. x8), of the same type as those found in the store-room in 1968; in front of her was a small 'table of offerings' of unbaked clay. There can be no doubt that this is a cult-room (c. 5- 10 X 4- 20 m.). It was approached from the south by another large room, c. 3 by 4- 50 m., in which there appear to be the remains of a staircase in the south-west part of it. To the north of the platforms in the north-west corner of the shrine the natural rock (purposely uncut?) is visible. It was cleared in 1968. Excava- tion in 1969 to the west of it revealed a triangular alcove. In this small area a quantity of broken and incomplete clay figures was uncovered of the same type as those found in the nearby store-room in 1968 (Fig. xg a-b). In the last-mentioned room two com- plete clay snakes and the almost complete bodies of four others were found in 1968. In 1969 no less than seven heads of serpents but with very few fragments of the bodies were discovered in the alcove. Room of the Fresco. A few more fragments that may FIG. 19 a-b</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1969-70 13 belong to the fresco discovered in 1968 were found. No other frescoes came to light but the room when cleared turned out to be of considerable size. In the centre of the room was a hearth of elliptical shape (west-east axis) and at either end of it were post-holes set in clay-built structures. To the north of the hearth, up against the north wall of the room, was a complete, but undecorated larnax. Many complete, but broken, pots were found near it and in the vicinity of the hearth. But the most striking feature in this room (apart from the fresco) was the high bench along its south side. This was c. I m. high and a little less than I m. broad. The bench was built of earth and had a surface-covering of slabs with an outer border of large, undressed stones. When this bench was taken down, it was found to contain a number of complete vases, mostly kylikes, and also a stirrup-jar, piriform jar, a cup, and an alabastron, all belonging to LH IIIB.2 or the end of the thirteenth century. Also within the earth were two fine ivories, one of a head (Fig. 20) and the other of a couchant lion. The reason for burying these treasures inside FIG. 20 the earthen bench remains a mystery, but it is clear that the construction of this feature represents a later phase in the history of this room. The L-shaped room of the ivories lies immediately to the east of the room of the fresco and is in direct communication with it. One arm with west-east axis was excavated in 1968. It contained partly worked ivories and some vases. The other arm, directly towards the south, turned out to be a shrine with a painted figure on a slightly raised dais in the south-west corner of it. Excavation to the north-west of the room of the fresco showed that the principal approach to it was through a small vestibule, square in plan, which had a very wide doorway occupying the whole length of the west side of it, which leads out to the west on to a corridor with north-south axis and another one with west-east axis immediately opposite. In the angle created by these two corridors is a small room, partly excavated in 1966, which may have been a kind of guard room. Beyond is the corridor that follows the line of the Cyclopean wall. Both the room of the fresco and the temple in their final form belong to the last phase of the thirteenth century B.C. There was no direct communication between them.' Argos. The French School continued excavations in Argos in April-June 69 in the 'Refugees quarter' (see grid in BCH 92, 1968, 1021, fig. I, area between square BO.48 and BS.54), and habitation from Middle Helladic times was ascertained without bed rock being reached. A number of structures of Imperial date, one of which showed signs of rebuilding, were in a very confused condition; a half life-size marble statue of Dionysus was found in the destruction level of the building (Fig. 21). At a lower level the FIG. 21 Hellenistic and Classical strata had been largely destroyed. A deep sounding revealed several Middle Helladic and Geometric strata, but traces of Mycen- aean occupation, attested for the neighbouring Aphrodision, were not discovered. In the same area remains of numerous late Imperial structures were found; a very large trench, which contained numerous lamps of the fourth century A.D., had been cut through Geometric and later tombs, possibly with a view to robbing them. Rescue operations were carried out</page><page sequence="12">14 P. M. FRASER north of the round temple in the Agora and part of the paving of a large monument, probably of the fourth century A.D., provisionally identified as a monumental arch giving access to the Agora, was found. Other operations, south of the hypostyle hall, clarified the stratigraphy of the area and brought to light late Roman installations; further work in this section is envisaged in 1970. Tiryns. The German Institute continued work in 1968 and 1969 on the lower enceinte, and in parti- cular in the region of the two water-conduits in the west wall discovered by N. Verdelis in 1962 (17 and 18 on the map in Kristen-Kraiker,5 p. 383). To the left of the entrance to the south conduit a building of two rooms with walls preserved to over 2 m. height was constructed against the wall (Fig. 22). It had FIG. 22 been violently destroyed, and the sherds under the floor in the destruction-fill belonged to LH IIIB. To the right of the entrance was a smaller and badly damaged building already abandoned in Mycenaean times. East of this a hall with a curved south- western angle with inner dividing walls of later date was discovered. Under the mud floor a Metope- style skyphos fragment was discovered. There was no pottery in the destruction fill, which is to be assigned to the period after the end of LH IIIB. From these discoveries it may be concluded that the lower enceinte wall was constructed at the latest in the LH IIIB period, and that the buildings in this area so far encountered were of the same period. The Mycenaean settlement in this area was destroyed immediately after the construction of the buildings-- probably still in LH IIIB. Further excavation in 1968 yielded mud floors with LH IIICI sherds. To this phase, which indicates a fairly intensive settlement of the area, is also to be assigned a room cleared in 1968 in the western wall south of the south conduit. This too seems to have undergone violent destruction. In the excavation of the northern conduit in 1968 Pre-Mycenaean levels were discovered immediately Cave has now appeared in Hesperia, 38, 1969, 311-81. ARCADIA TO ELIS Gortynia. Psophis. The excavation of Miss Ch. Kardara at the shrine of Aphrodite Erykine continued (A.S.). Part of the upper structure of the telesterion was discovered (cf. AR 1968-69 15), and also parts of the foundations of two small temples, a thesauros with part of its covering, and a well preserved foun- tain, and the stadium was located north of the sacred road discovered in 1968. Small finds included terra- cotta statuettes, chased bronze objects, and bronze fibulae (Ergon 1969, 86-90). Peneius Valley Rescue Operation. Following the British School's survey in 1967 of its sector of the Peneius Valley, Elis, rescue excavations were con- ducted in 1969 at Easter (31 March-I 2 April) by J. E. Jones, R. A. Tomlinson, P. A. Rahtz, and R. Howell, at Kostoureika and Keramidia, and in the summer (19 August-12 September) by J. E. Jones at the latter site. At Kostoureika the Hellenistic farm- house located on a low hill in a 1967 trial, was cleared excavation suggested a possible hiatus from Mesolithic to Neolithic in this part of the cave. Good specimens of both monochrome and patterned early neo- lithic pottery iere found. Mesolithic remains consisted almost exclusively of chipped stone tools of obsidian and flint, including microliths. The neo- lithic sequence revealed by the excava- tions of Pits A and F/FI in 1967 and 1968 was correlated by uniting the two areas; as a result of excavation of a deep deposit an excellent stratigraphic sequence of Late Neolithic was obtained. Pottery included matt-painted ware, 'Urfirnis' ware, monochrome burnished and other coarse ware. Radiocarbon dates from material discovered in pre- vious seasons cover a span from the middle of the tenth millennium (Palaeo- lithic) to the fifth millennium (Neo- lithic). A Preliminary report of the 1962-68 campaigns at Halieis and of the 1967-68 campaigns at the 'Franchthi' above the rock. An early Helladic level of destruc- tion contained a burnt house with some whole EH II vessels, and numerous Neolithic artefacts. Under the floor of the house more EH II pottery was found. Epidaurus. A valuable study of the public works of the sanctuary in the fourth and early third centuries B.c. has been published by A. Burford: The Greek Temple builders at Epidaurus (Liverpool Univ. Press 1969). Buildings, costs, accounts, contracts, etc., are all studied in detail. Porto Cheli. 'Franchthi' Cave. During the 1969 campaign of Indiana University and the University of Pennsylvania in 'Franchthi' Cave, areas inside the cave were extended to facilitate examination of the deep levels. Pit H, containing Mesolithic and earlier remains, was expanded to the south, and the new</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1969-70 15 but found to have been preserved only at one corner, and ploughed out elsewhere. The dating was amply confirmed by the finds. The building was an isolated farmhouse, built of mud-brick on stone foundations (which incorporated some re-used material such as a well-cut block with a rebate as a corner stone), and roofed with Laconian type glazed tiles. A large deposit of Early Helladic II sherds indicated a much earlier occupation-the earliest recorded in the BSA survey area-although no structural remains were discovered. So this knoll on the edge of the flood- plain of the valley-a common choice of site in this particular area-bears traces of three occupations separated by over two thousand years, namely an Early Helladic one, a Hellenistic farmhouse, and a modern, rather humble and now ruinous farm build- ing. A little to the north, at Hagios Athanasios, on a hill slope with a scatter of Hellenistic-Roman sherds, two trials revealed disturbed foundations at one point, and at another, uphill, the remains of a circular kiln (3-30o m. diam.) with a reddened fire- baked floor and a collapsed clay dome. At Keramidia, part of a fairly large settlement in a small dry valley was explored. A complex of build- ings included a square room with a plaster floor (4 50 x 5oo00 m.) and a westerly walled enclosure (c. 10 50o x 9' 50 m.) with a rectangular open, plaster- lined cistern in the south-east angle, an embedded pithos-base in the north-east corner, a rectangular stone and mortar floor-foundation (c. 6 - oo x 4 00oo m.) in the north-west quarter, and another, square and smaller cistern and a second deep-set pithos-base in the south-west quarter. Along the east side of the plaster-floored room was an open area with an extent of flagstone paving at its north end, overlain in part, when found, with a fall of large Laconian tile frag- ments. Further to the east were remains of other walls, less well-preserved but suggesting a more open area, with a trodden floor of tile fragments and stones, another embedded pithos-base, and a small hearth. Two trials cut near the north-east edge of the same field produced sherds but did not reveal structures. Finds included 23 bronze coins, mostly Roman Imperial, glass fragments, iron nails, iron slag, and potsherds, including a Classical red-figured one, some black-glazed, and Hellenistic sherds as well as Roman. These indicate that the buildings cleared had been of Roman date, but suggest long occupation of the site. North-east of the complex, on a lakeside hill, were also exposed the disturbed foundations of a small building, perhaps a little church, together with five shallow burials outside it, two having roof-tiles cover- ing skeletons laid with their feet to the east. The survey carried out in 1967 by the American School of Classical Studies in the area allotted to them in the rescue operation occasioned by the construction of the Peneius High Dam (cf. already AR 1968-69 16, for the excavation of Agrapidochori by the University of Colorado, and for a map of the whole area, see AAA 1968, i, 46; ADelt 23 Chr I, i75) noted 13 sites in the area, almost all of late Roman or Byzantine date, and one Prehistoric (Palaiochori). That of the Austrian Institute was confined to the acropolis hill of Armatova, in the junction formed by the confluence of the Ladon and the Peneius, but no remains were found, and only Hellenistic domestic pottery in one of two trial trenches. The team of the French School, surveying the alluvial plain north of the Peneius, probably in the region where the river once ran, in the area of the village of Xenies, discovered a Hellenistic pit-grave, but most of the pottery found in trial trenches was of mediaeval or more recent date. The German Institute, operating in the area between Agrapidochori and Suli, reported that traces of Classical habitation were found, and also of a pre- historic (MH ?) settlement, an early archaic shrine or grave-peribolos, a Roman settlement and two mediaeval churches, but, apart from one grave, only sherds were discovered. The Italian zone was also north of the Peneius, in the neighbourhood of the village of Daouti (west of Xenies). The area was unproductive of remains but on an eminence west of Xenies sherds of all periods, predominently Hellenistic, were found. Below the hill one or two graves, includ- ing one of the Frankish period, were discovered, and north of the hills behind Daouti and Xenies, at Langadhia, three tombs were found in the face of the river bank (left unopened); these and others nearby were of late date (see ADelt 23 Chr I, 175-94 for these reports in detail). City of Elis. Work on the theatre of Elis under Dr N. Yalouris in 1969 (A.S.) was concentrated on the area in front of the western parodos, where in previous years a large rectangular structure, probably of the Roman period, had been found. The internal walls of this were stuccoed, and there were numerous frag- ments of different coloured plaster. The purpose of the building is not yet clear. Sherds of b.f. and r.f. vases of the fifth century were found at a depth of I - 60-2-25 m. Work also continued on the theatre itself, and the relation of the koilon to the orchestra was studied by Mr F. Coope of the American School (Ergon 1969, 80-5)- At Franconesi (3 km. east of Olympia) a large Roman necropolis associated with the panhellenic sanctuary was excavated in 1967. It contained over 50 unrifled graves, some in loculi, richly furnished with terra- cotta and bronze objects; one child's grave contained a single natural egg in an excellent state of preserva- tion. The tombs containing loculi had paved entrances, and were covered inside and outside with plaster with line-decoration. The tombs are prob- ably those of officials of the shrine, for tombstones found on the site record the names of Olympic competitors (ADelt 23 Chr I, 164-5)- Olympia. P. Themelis publishes (AAA 1969, 2, 248-56) a number of clay figurines of Minoan type which have come to light by chance in and around Olympia, the authenticity and possible origin of which he discusses. Messenia. Messene. Professor Orlandos recom- menced excavations in Messene (A.S.) in 1969 after an interval of four years. Attention was concentrated on extending the excavation of the south and west sides of the tetrastyle complex in the agora, and the bases of some of the columns of these two sides were discovered. West of the West Stoa a well preserved drain was discovered, extending from the temple of</page><page sequence="14">16 P. M. FRASER Artemis to the south isodomic analemma, where its mouth was located (Fig. 23). In the north stoa the earth forming the bed of the water-course which crossed the agora was removed (see Ergon 1969, 200 ff. for the re-routing of the water-course) and the north FIG. 23 supporting-wall exposed. The excavation of the area close to the north-west corner of the stoa-complex brought to light architectural fragments which prob- ably belonged to the adjacent Caesareum. In the earth deposit of this area fragments of inscriptions of Im- perial date, and a small headless statue of Cybele were discovered. The second phase of the excavation consisted of opening a trench from the lower terminal point of the monumental staircase in a southernly direction, i.e. towards the centre of the courtyard of the tetra- style structure. In the centre this trench encountered the krepis and dedicatory bases of a large excellently constructed Hellenistic temple oriented on the line of the eastern entrance of the complex (Fig. 24); few architectural fragments were found, other than pieces of the stone sima with lion-head, and a number of poros column drums, etc., which evidently belonged to an earlier poros temple on the same site. The dedicatory bases and exedrai on the north (I2) and south (5 to date) sides were uninscribed, the inscrip- tions having been cut on upper members of the bases, now lost. Among a number of inscriptions found in and around the excavations reference may be made to the statue-base of a Roman legatus, Gn. Manlius L. fil. Agrippa, and, among the sculpture, a head of Hermes of the third or fourth century A.D., and a roughly contemporary or even later statue of a man wearing a short chiton, I "5 m. high (Ergon 1969, 97-132). FIG. 24 Messenia. Nichoria. The first campaign of the University of Minnesota Messenia Expedition under Professor W. McDonald on the ridge of Nichoriea;-at the junction of the Kalamata-Korone and Kalamata- Pylos roads, aimed at testing the eroded hill top for habitation. Over 60o trenches and pits were dug, and house-walls, floors, etc., were encoun- tered, and it is calculated that approximately 8o per cent of the acropolis was built over during the LH II period. A substantial 3-roomed building in the south-east sector is the only build- ing certainly of post-Geometric date. Pottery recovered from the site during the campaign covers periods from EH II to Geometric, but there is no assurance that the site will provide an uninterrupted sequence over this extensive lapse of time. Laconia. Sparta. In AAA 1969, 2, 220 ff. A. Delevorias discusses a statue of Pan of the early Roman period, recently identified in the maga- zines of the Sparta Museum. CENTRAL GREECE Boeotia. Tanagra. Professor Marinatos has published a preliminary report on the figured Mycenaean larnakes recently discovered in tombs at Tanagra (Dedeza). Thirty-two cham- ber tombs were excavated (A.S.) and of these one (no. 6) yielded sixteen larnakes (Fig. 25) each containing a single burial. Vases and statuettes in them were of LH IIIB-C date. Along with the larnakes were found remarkable painted terracotta plaques, consisting of a flat lower, extremity in the shape of a double-horn, from which projects a disc of the Mycenaean 0l-type, above which is a bird-like figure with a long tail. The lower portion had a tong for insertion into the lid of the</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1969-70 17 larnakes (Fig. 26). The larnakes themselves have either floral decoration or representations of human FIG. 25 figures (female mourners with hands raised, etc.) in the dress known from other examples; in one larnax FIG. 26 the female figures are portrayed as busts seen through windows (Fig. 27). One larnax (from grave 22) bears a representation of a bull-fight (Ergon 1969, 5-i i; cf. id. AAA 1970, I, 61-2). Thebes. In AAA 1970, I, 62, Professor Marinatos publishes a brief preliminary note on the Linear B tablets recently found in the Palace area in Thebes, close to the place of the discovery of the Babylonian cylinder-seals a few years ago. In 1967 over forty rescue-excavations took place FIG. 27 Levadhia. E. Vallas and N. Pharaklas give a further report on the identification of the under- ground chamber on Mt Prophetes Elias at Levadhia, which they identify with the seat of the oracle of Trophonios, as reconstructed after destruction at the time of the Herulian invasion (AAA 1969, 2, 228 ff.).

Vatin, Middon de Phocide (Paris 1969). THESSALY Larisa. Excavations in 1968 by D. Theocharis in the area of the acropolis of Larisa (Vasilissis Sophias Street 5-1I1) brought to light the remains of the ancient theatre, of which 14 rows of seats of one kerkis and part of the proskenion are preserved. Many of the seats are inscribed. Theocharis dates the theatre to the late Hellenistic period (AAA 1969, 2, 167-72)- within the city area, under the then epimelete N. Pharaklas. In the centre of the town the material was predominantly Byzantine, but in lower levels Mycenaean and earlier finds were made. (No. 2) A complex of Mycenaean walls was found in Kadmou Street, in the centre of the city, below which were MH and EH walls. Fragments of Mycenaean frescoes were also discovered. In the suburbs of the town and surrounding areas (Kastelli, Sphagia, Agioi Theodoroi, Pyri) a Mycenaean chamber tomb was discovered on the hill of Mikron Kastelli, the east part of which was formed of the natural rock of the hill; in the dromos was a small pit with offerings and bones; vases included four stirrup jars. On the same site a classical level yielded r.f. vase fragments (No. 14). A substantial Byzantine building with courtyard was uncovered in the extension of the Gymnasion on Mikro Kastelli (No. 16). The lower levels contained Mycenaean sherds (ADelt 23 Chr I, 207-24).</page><page sequence="16">18 P. M. FRASER EPIRUS Nome of Ioannina. Dodona. Professor S. Dakaris' work at Dodona (A.S.) in 1969 continued to be concentrated on the south part of the Bouleuterion destroyed by the Romans in 167 B.C. In the internal west wall a staircase corresponding to those found in 1968 on the eastern side (AR 1968-69 21) leads to the seats of the Bouleuterion on the upper floor. East of the altar of Charops (see AR 1968-69 21) were dis- covered below the Hellenistic floor the remains of a large elliptical structure c. 9"5 m. long, in which were found sherds dating from the Bronze Age to the fifth century. The structure itself was probably built in the Early Iron Age, for immediately below the foundation was discovered a LH III biconical whorl FIG. 28 and, at foundation-level, a fragment of a cantharoid cup with geometric decoration of the north-west Greek type. Above the ruins of the Bouleuterion were the foundations of a Late Roman building, with which were associated a large number of murex-shells and fragments of glass vessels, bronze and bone instru- ments, especially small knives and chisels. The building was evidently used for the manufacture of purple dye (cf. CIL III, 536, 1-7). Other finds included a small bronze shield, a manumission decree of the early second century B.C., and a large bronze inscribed plaque, not yet deciphered; the manu- mission decree attests two new ethnic units, Oapyavalo; and KadOpto; (Ergon 1969, 19-29). Nome of Ioannina. Zagori. Vitsa. Excavation of the large necropolis continued in 1967 (cf. AR 1968- 69 22), and its western boundary was shown to be limited by the adjacent natural rock. In the necropolis 34 more tombs were opened, of which six were of the fifth and of the fourth century, 4 archaic, SI geometric, and some half dozen protogeometric; all were inhumations. One protogeometric tomb is of particular interest (T. II13) since its contents, especially the bronze, showed links with contemporary FIG. 29 material in the tombs of Vergina. A small part of the nearby settlement with remains of Classical and Archaic dwellings was also investigated (ADelt 23 Chr 2, 287-291). Other minor sites investigated in the area of Ioannina and Metsovo are recorded by Mrs Vokoto- poulou, ibid., pp. 291-6. These include the partial investigation of a small Neolithic cave at Castritza, and the discovery of prehistoric, Classical and later remains and sherds at Volonesi on either bank of the Arachthos, an area which has previously yielded Hellenistic tombstones and also bronze vessels. Nome of Preveza. At Michalitsi, north of Nicopolis, excavation of the grave peribolos and naiskos dis- covered by Professor Dakaris in 1963 (ADelt 19 [19641 305-9) continued in 1969 and numerous architectural fragments were found, in- cluding an Ionic capital, and fragments of sculpture which include an almost com- plete lion of the fourth century (Fig. 28); fourteen graves were found in the neigh- bourhood of the peribolos (AAA 1970, I, 41-5). IONIAN ISLANDS Kerkyra. Mon Repos. In 1967 work was concentrated on the Archaic temple in Sector VI, identified as the Heraion. Stretches of both the late Archaic and Classical perimeter walls were identified. It was confirmed that this temple had almost entirely disappeared by the end of antiquity as a result of rebuilding in Classical and subsequent times. It ap- pears probable that it was built in about 600 B.C. and that the Classical temple was built on its foundations at the end of the fifth century. A stratified deposit of the fifth century behind the later perim- eter wall was rich in fragments of Archaic and Doric capitals of different types and column-drums of local yellow limestone. The capitals resemble those of</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1969-70 19 the temple of Artemis, and probably belong to the Archaic temple. Numerous roof tiles were also dis- covered in the same deposit, and the face of one carries a finely worked kouros-style head (Fig. 29). Fragments of the columns and other architectural members of the later temple, some incomplete, were also found. The fragmentary face of a marble kouros of c. 570-560 (Fig. 30), possibly of Samian origin, was also found in the area of the archaic temple. FIG. 30 FIG. 31 Outside the Archaic peribolos investigation of the open temenos (sec. V) begun in 1966 (see AR 1968-69 22) continued. Epigraphical material shows that it was dedicated to Apollo, and the pottery indicates that it was constructed in the late sixth century and continued in use throughout the first half of the fifth. A deposit between this temenos and the Archaic peribolos was extremely rich in bronze objects, utensils, urns, terracotta statuettes and vases; some of the bronze objects were inscribed 'AndA (tv d KopKvpaiog (Fig. 31) and it is clear from the number of bronze urns that Apollo was worshipped here as god of war; noteworthy are two 'Celtiberian' fibulae (Fig. 32), and a tiny ram (length 0-035 m.) and a scorpion (0-058 m.) which evidently formed parts of handles of bronze vessels (Fig. 33 a, b). Many other fine archaic bronze and terracotta fragments were also found. Of pottery the main types of vessel are small cotylae and aryballi of local manufacture of the late sixth and early fifth centuries, together with Attic b.f. lekythi. In the ancient necropolis at Garitsa a small excava- tion, to be published separately in due course, result- ing from the chance discovery of two funerary pithoi, brought to light a section of the Archaic ancient cemetery, the burials of which were all in pithoi, in graves covered by roof tiles. Most of the pottery was of local manufacture of the late seventh and early sixth century and the excavation provides an oppor- tunity for a detailed study of the development of this ware (ADelt 23 Chr 2, 303-19). ?11i" i-iigi~i~iiiiiii~ii~i~ i 'i~ i iiii~ i i -iiiiii iii-iiiiiiiiiii - .....: ?.... ??: -::::::--i--:-i~~iiii zii-i .. ... iiiil iaii ii ii i -ii ii i ii c:i- i:il:i :-ii-:ii-i:: i:: : ::::: : ::: :_ -: :::---:::-i-:::;- - :::_:-::-:-::;: :- .::_:::-_::: . ::_ i i ii i iiii i~ii Fii 3 FIo. 32 Leukas. The cave of'Asvotrypa' near Fryni has been partially investigated and yielded EH and MH pottery. In the historic period the cave was a shrine of Pan and the Nymphs, and numerous dedi- cated objects were found in hol- lows in the rock and stalactites, including a fine female terracotta head of the late fifth century, and an archaic group of the circular dance of the Nymphs. The finds on the whole resemble those found by D6rpfeld in the shrine of the Nymphs at Hagia Kyriaki on Nydri (ADelt 23 Chr 2, 321-2).

Petsas has published in MaKE6ovtKd, 9, 1969, 101-216, a survey of the activity of the Archaeological Service in Macedonia during the years 1966-67, together with a detailed bibliographical analysis of Macedonian studies. The main archaeological dis- coveries have been reported in ADelt and elsewhere and I give references both to the original publication and to that in MaKE6OVtKd. This is a most valuable contribution to the ever growing field of Macedonian studies. CENTRAL MACEDONIA Thessaloniki. Excavation of the southern stoa of the Agora continued in 1967, but no important dis- coveries were made. In road-widening operations in Hagios Theodoros Street, by the Letaean Gate, a number of tombstones which had been re-used in the construction of the gate were found, including a well preserved pedimental stele with a relief of the de- ceased, a Roman sitting in a chair with an attendant facing him, and with the inscription (above relief): drse HontL-te Xalpe/Kal ar HolRd, Ti; OT' ed; (below relief): C.-Popillie-Salve-et-tu-quiquis-es (Fig. 34). In Philiki Hetaireias Street remains of the Roman wall, and also of the Galerian Hippodrome were discovered (ADelt 23 Chr 2, 328-34; MaKe OVtKd 9, 149 if.). Nome of Pieria. Rytine. A number of small bronze objects of various dates were found almost on the surface of a hill outside the village in 1967, including a kouros (Fig. 35) (ADelt 23 Chr 2, 340; MaKEOotKa', 9, 190)- FIG. 35 Dion. Further work was carried out in 1967 on the large semi-circular Odeion and the orchestra, parts of the parodoi, the stage and the external circular wall were cleared (ADelt 23 Chr 2, 342-4). FIG. 34 FIG. 36a, b</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1969-70 21 Nome of Kilkis. A late archaic kouros was dis- covered in 1967 in the area of Europos in Paeonia, the first known specimen from Northern Greece (Fig. 36 a, b). A trial excavation at the place of discovery, close to the acropolis of the ancient city, yielded no results (ADelt 23 Chr 2, 338-9; MaKE6OVLKd 9, 178-9). WESTERN MACEDONIA Edessa. Ph. Petsas continued his excavations in the lower city of Edessa in 1968, and the circuit of the town-walls with two gates was traced. Petsas pub- lishes an amusing inscription found in the excava- tions (Fig. 37), in which Xoipog (either a pig or a FIG. 37 human of that name) laments his death in cryptic words which seem to indicate that it, or he, had come from Dalmatia, and had been run over en route. The epigram is inscribed around and below a representa- tion of a hooded figure driving a cart drawn by four horses; beneath the wheels of the cart is represented a crouching, frightened pig, and under the horses' hoofs a dog leads the way. The monument has excited lively controversy, particularly as to whether 'Choiros' is a pig or a man. Though both views can be sus- tained by arguments, and some subsidiary points remain obscure, it seems unlikely that a riddle could be carried to the lengths required to support the sup- position that 'Choiros' was a human. In any case the author clearly enjoyed his calembour. (AAA 1969, 2, 186-91; cf. Koumanoudes, ibid. 1969, 3, 422-3; Makaronas, ibid. 424-9; Marinatos, ibid. 1970, I, 8I-4). Verria. Chance excavations in the middle of the town brought to light a dedication of the city to FIG. 38 Excavations also continued on the room in Basilica P on which work began last year. This also contains two excellent groups of mosaics, one consisting of two series each of three medallions and the other 35 series each of ten medallions, both with representations of aquatic birds, fish, rosettes, baskets, etc. (Ergon 1969, 49-68). Heracles Kynagidas, 'H ndo'~ 'HpaK.EI/Kvvayt6at, ~nta- in letters which seem to be of the fourth century B.c. (ADelt 23 Chr 2, 346). Nome of Florina. Mikre Prespa. The excavations of N. Moutsopoulos of the Basilica of St Achilleios on the island of Mikre Prespa continued in 1969 (A.S.). Beneath the north part of the narthex 35 tombs of Byzantine date (twelfth-thirteenth centuries) were found, while beneath the altar several earlier layers of structures were found, and also a quantity of Byzantine coins and bronze objects. In the eastern and southern sectors clearing and repairing opera- tions were carried out in, and adjacent to, the basilica, the excavation and preservation of which is now completed (Ergon 1969, 29-38). EASTERN MACEDONIA Nome of Serrai. Aidonochori. Excavation of the heroon (AR 1968-69 24) continued in 1967, and the destruction deposit level, and inscribed fragments of a revetment of a house of the fourth century, dis- covered (ADelt 23 Chr 2, 358). Amphipolis. E. Stikas continued in 1969 his excavations of Basilicas A and F by the mouth of the Strymon (A.S.). In and around the south aisle of A the remainder of the series of splendid mosaics, which had been partially uncovered in 1967, was brought to light. The designs are mainly square and circular panels containing representations of individual birds, fish, etc., surrounded by meanders and floral patterns. The excavation of the narthex was completed, and the existence of an exonarthex, the floor of which was covered with more medallion-mosaics with animals, fish, etc., established. South of the exonarthex, by the north-west wall of the narthex, part of a room with vivid and life-like mosaics consisting of series of medallions with more representations of animals was uncovered (Fig. 38). Work continues on this room.</page><page sequence="20">22 P. M. FRASER Nome of Drama. Sitagroi-Photolivos. Excavations were resumed at the prehistoric settlement mound of Sitagroi-Photolivos in 1969 by Dr A. C. Renfrew and Professor Marija Gimbutas under the auspices of the British School at Athens. During 1969 attention focused on two aspects of the project: (i) sampling of material for special study, and (ii) the recovery of structures. (i) Sampling. One principal aim of the season was to obtain further samples of material from the various phases, especially I, II and IV. Excavation was resumed in Square KL (phases I and II) and Square SL (phase IV) for this purpose. In consequence Dr'S. Bokonyi now has more than 30,000 identified bones from the site. Flotation for grain was con- ducted on samples from every phase, with extremely good recovery conditions. (ii) Structures. Several features of interest were uncovered in the squares dug for sampling purposes. In KL the uncarbonised remains of a wooden beam nearly three metres long were found; in SL two large complete pithoi in a destruction deposit contained considerable quantities of carbonised grain and acorns; in ML a small well-preserved oven. FIG. 39 Two squares, io X Io m., at the top of the mound (PO, QO), were investigated further. The walls of an Early Bronze Age house were detected there during 1968. During the 1969 season the apsidal end to the north and the wall-end to the south were obtained; this house was some 18 metres long. Beneath and to the north, the well-preserved burnt remains of a house from the early phase of the Early Bronze Age were unearthed. The plaster floor, interrupted at the south west by a shallow pit, and FIG. 40 the base of the walls were preserved. The apsidal end to the north, giving a length of 8 m. and width of 6 m., was clearly indicated by soft soil filling what was apparently a narrow trench. The house was of the timber frame type, with central post, smaller uprights being set on the inside of the roof supports and plastered with pis6 mud. The room in the apse was separated from the main square room by a partition (Fig. 39). Entrance was apparently from the west. Numerous complete and restorable vases were found, and the apse room contained grinding equipment, grain bins, a bread oven and a further oven of unusual construction whose func- tion is now being studied. This well- preserved structure gives a clear picture of house-type in north Greece: it re- sembles structures of comparable date at Ezero (in Bulgaria) and at Vucedol (in Yugoslavia). Nome of Kavalla. Philippi. The ex- cavation by St. Pelekanides of the 'Octa- gon' church continued in 1969 (A.S.). A number of fresh sections of the build- ing were cleared, including the 'open- air' sequence of rooms, and the construction of the southern gate and entrance porch and its relation to the main east-west road across the Forum were investigated (Ergon 1969, 38-49)- M. P. Ducrey of the French School has carried out a fresh survey of the rock-cut reliefs of the Roman period on the acropolis of Philippi, some of which have been destroyed since the last war. In so doing he has discovered io new reliefs, some excellently preserved, including one of Artemis (Fig. 4o). THRACE Mesembria. Excavations under A. Vavritsas con- tinued in 1969 (A.S.), and three houses in the fortified settlement close to the sea and associated with the city wall were excavated, in two of which were small spaces enclosed by stones apparently serv- ing a cult purpose. Pottery from the houses was of all periods from Neolithic to West Slope and</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1969-70 23 FIG. 41 Megarian. Further excavation was carried out on the western part of this settlement, where structures had been uncovered in previous years, one of which contained an oil-press. The most northernly of these rooms contained a large number of Laconian roof tiles, prehistoric sherds, and a terracotta statuette. A number of inscribed and non-inscribed re-used funerary stelai, evidently removed from the nearby necropolis, were found over the whole area. The foundations of a tower at the south-west and north-west corners of the settlement were also cleared (Ergon 1969, 69-79). A shrine of the rider-Hero named "'Hpcv A?3)vwAdnhr; has been discovered on the foothills of Mt Pangaeon by the village of Kepia. The shrine, though not yet excavated, has yielded numerous reliefs and inscriptions (Latin and Greek) relating to the hero (AAA 1969, 2, 191-3). A damaged funerary stele from Pagouria (ancient Stryme) representing a seated and a standing figure, of the second half of the fourth century (Fig. 41), and a female head from Komotini are published in AAA 1969, 2, 194-5. CYCLADES Andros. Zagora. The excavations of the Geometric settlement at Zagora on the west coast, by the Univer- sity of Sydney directed by A. Cambitoglou, begun in FIG. 43 Ano Koufonisi. Ph. Zapheiropoulos publishes a brief account of his excavations in autumn 1969 of two Early Cycladic cemeteries on this island between 1960 and continued in 1967 (AR 1967-68 I7), were again continued in 1969 (A.S.). More rooms and courtyards, mostly smaller than those cleared in pre- vious campaigns were uncovered on the plateau, and a FIG. 42 number of stone bases of wooden supporting posts for the roofs were found (Fig. 42). Further work on the temple showed that it was built during the sixth cen- tury, presumably after the settlement was abandoned. South-east of the temple, on the slope below the plateau, more houses and part of an ancient road were found; part of the fortification wall with a gate near the south end was also excavated (Fig. 43). Ceramic dis- coveries include a fragment of a relief pithos with a rep- resentationofan archer (Fig.44) (Ergon 1969, 13 1-41).</page><page sequence="22">24 P. M. FRASER FIG. 44 Naxos and Amorgos. Finds from one cemetery included two figures of the Folded-arm type, and from the other numerous 'Urfirnis' vases of Early Cycladic I Period (AAA 1970, 1, 48-51). Delos. J. Marcad6 has published an important detailed study of the hellenistic sculpture found on Delos, Au Musde de Dilos (Bibl. it. franf. d'Ath. et de Rome, 215, 1969). Kea. Hagia Irini. Supplementary excavations were carried out in 1969 by the University of Cincin- nati under J. Caskey. On the eastern side of the promontory tests round the north-eastern tower revealed foundations of bed rock deep under water, and confirmed that this part of the defences was added at an early stage, probably at the very begin- ning of the Late Bronze Age. On the western side, the early fortifications exposed in 1968 were further explored, and a series of superimposed walls and FIG. 45 associated structures belonging to the earlier phases of the Middle Bronze Age were examined. It has now become evident that at that time the ground rose steadily from the shore on the west towards the central ridge of the promontory, which was exten- FIG. 46 sively levelled in the final period of prosperity and the construction of the defensive works must be sought in lower ground. On the other hand Early Bronze Age walls were encountered at unexpectedly high FIG. 47 levels. The clearing out of House E, south of Tower W (Fig. 45), and also of House F, lying outside the gateway in the wall DJ, provided evidence of other remains of the earlier period, before the construction of the fortifications. The interpretation of these complicated remains, and their chronology, is difficult, but it is striking that from the earliest time onwards into the Middle Bronze Age buildings, roads and strong projecting structures were concentrated into the region of the much later spring chamber discovered in 1966, and it seems likely that the chief source of water lay here from the beginning. Pottery belonged to the standard repertory of EH II, sauce-boats and small saucers, and also highly burnished black and red- brown wares, mainly cups, shallow bowls and tankards, represented in the earliest layer yet known at Lefkandi (Fig. 46). The dark</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1969-70 25 burnished Early Cycladic wares with incised or im- pressed decoration were scarce. Among vessels with painted decoration, one in the form of an animal hold- ing a bowl, and apparently begging for it to be filled, is noteworthy (Fig. 47); an almost identical piece has been found on Syros. Keros. On this islet, the proto-Cycladic settlement, partially excavated in 1963, was further investigated; fragments of Cycladic idols, marble vases, obsidian blades and a quantity of incised sherds were found (ADelt 23 Chr 2, 381). Naxos. Excavations by Professor Kontoleon in 1969 (A.S.) took place in various regions. At Aplo- mata rescue-operations in the Mycenaean necropolis led to the clearance of a tholos-tomb on the edge of the sea containing a few small vases and remains of large, stirrup-jars. A well, constructed of clay, close to the south edge of the tomb has not yet been fully cleared; it has so far yielded small Hellenistic and Roman remains as well as organic matter. System- atic excavation this year was confined to the south- east corner of the neighbourhood of the 'square stoa', and it was possible to determine the relationship of the eastern and southern stoas to each other (Ergon 1969, 141-50). Thera. (a) Akroteri. Professor Sp. Marinatos' third campaign at Akroteri (1969) (A.S.) consisted mainly of preservation and technical work: a new road was built, a museum and laboratory constructed, and a Dexion roof of several hundred metres, con- structed over the whole area. During restoration work in the Northern Sector (A) (Arvaniti) new houses appeared, and preliminary work in southern area (B) 'Bronou A', separated from (A) by a road, has revealed the presence of upper storeys of houses. In sector (F) more well-preserved parts of houses were uncovered, which were apparently later turned into workshops. More excellent pottery was re- covered, including a fine kymbe (Fig. 48) and a jug I':---::" ":l':i ::::icilii:'i':iiiii iiiiii:::-:::: .:::--:- -:- -:: :::::: ::::::::::::::::::: : ::" :::::: ::::::::: :: : :: : ::'iiii :. :::::::::::::::,?.i~--::: ?_ ::::::-:-- iii-i:i ii~i ?i.:i:::i .,:::_, :::: ~ ~ ~ IG 48::::::: with representations of grapes (Fig. 49), and very many fragments of frescoes, some with representations of natural size blue monkeys (Ergon 1969, 150-64; AAA 1970, , I, -5); cf. also for the season of 1968, Marinatos, Excavations at Thera, II (Btfl. -r7 E;v 'AOYv.

AR 1968-69 29) and twenty-two pyres were cleared. As previously, the funerary gifts were largely black-glaze kylikes and skyphi, and a few Corinthian kotylai, but also included a few b.f. iai~i FIG- 49 kylikes.

OTHER AEGEAN ISLANDS Samos. Pythagoreion (Tigani). Dr W. Martini writes: 'In 1969 one of the best preserved ruins of the ancient city, the so-called 'Roman Ruins' or 'Imperial Palace', was investigated with a view to determining the dimensions of the entire complex. It lies in the extreme south-west corner of the ancient city (xviii on Fabricius' map of Samos, reprod. in T61le, Die</page><page sequence="24">26 P. M. FRASER Antike Stadt Samos, Abb. 21). The building was badly damaged on the east side; on the south side, a wall serving as foundation probably belonged to the ancient city wall; and on the west side courses of a well-preserved external wall were cleared (Fig. 51). FIG. 51 The earth accumulation inside and outside the build- ing contained many Late Roman and Byzantine sherds and lamps and glass fragments. Within the building the accumulation contained numerous fragments of floor mosaic and marble wall-facings. Beneath the accumulation in the south west portion of the building was a layer containing sherds dating from the Geometric to the Early Byzantine period. In front of the building on the south side was an arched hall c. 50 m. long, of which the front facing the sea was constructed with niches; the relation of the hall to the main building is not clear. The south west sector of the main building which was limited by large columns was cleared, and the plan of two rooms determined: an eastern room with vertical walls, a window on the north side, an arched opening to the neighbouring western room, and a wide opening to the south, and a western room, the wall surfaces of which were interrupted by a series of round and rectangular niches. Parts of vaulted architectural fragments of plastered stone and bricks which lay in the ruins indicated that the columns were linked by moulded arches and the rooms covered with brick vaults. On the south side the columns enclose deep niches, the short sides of which were marked by deep arched openings; similar apertures have already been observed between the columns of the west side. These openings, as well as some vertical terracotta pipes all round the walls, just below the present level of excavation, probably belong to a hypocaust system, and suggest that the whole structure was a bath, probably of the Late Imperial period.' Twelve operations in building plots were carried out by K. Tsakos in the town. In one deposit, remains of a stoa were uncovered, consisting of lion- head drain-spouts, fragments of the geison and part of a Corinthian capital. In a house in the same plot, a well preserved geometric mosaic came to light. In the plots remains of numerous rooms and walls mostly of late Hellenistic and Roman date were found (ADelt 23 Chr 2, 375-80). Samos. Two volumes of the publica- tion Samos appeared in 1968: H. Walter, Friihe samische Gefdsse (Samos v) and G. Schmidt, Kyprische Bildwerke aus dem Heraion von Samos (Samos vii), as well as a guide to the ancient city by R. Tlle, Die Antike Stadt Samos (Mainz, 1969). Thasos. Excavations and trials were continued by the French School in 1969 over a wide area. The excavation of the Apostolides property, begun in 1967 (cf. AR 1967-68 20), was continued by J.-J. Maffre and 0. Picard, and in one trial trench (Divanakis property) the southern external wall of the archaic house (Fig. 52) identified in 1967 was discovered below some Hellenistic fill. A considerable amount of decorated archaic pottery was discovered. Else- where O. Picard opened a trench in- side the walls, about Ioo m. east of the Gate of Silenus. and the interior face of the wall was exposed to a height of more than 4 m. This face is constructed mostly of small blocks of gneiss and marble, in contrast with the imposing outer face. Trial trenches were also made outside the rampart where part of a Hellenistic house was discovered in the neighbourhood of the Poseidion. FIG. 52 Samothrace. Supplementary excavations in the Sanctuary of the Great Gods in Samothrace were carried out for the American School of Classical Studies by the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University between II July and 14 August 1969. Two areas excavated in previous campaigns were further investigated: the Propylon of Ptolemy II at the eastern border of the Sanctuary and the Stoa at the western border. Although the work was limited both in extent and objectives, it provided important information, on the one hand, for the reconstruction of the unique Propylon of Ptolemy and its approaches,</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1969-70 27 and, on the other, for an outline of the history of a still poorly understood area of the Sanctuary. Propylon of Ptolemy II. Activities were confined to the river-bed north and west of the building's founda- tion, where modern accumulations of earth cover both fallen superstructure of the Propylon and the scanty remains of a destroyed channel, which, in antiquity, led the river toward the sea, after it had passed through the vaulted passage of the Propylon's foundations. Numerous fragments of the Propylon's super- structure were recovered in the area. Of particular interest are additional fragments of Corinthian capitals and of the anta-capital decorated with griffin and stag. It is now evident that the western porch of the Propylon, in other ways identical to its eastern counterpart, substituted Corinthian columns for Ionic, and a figured anta-capital for the simpler mould- ings on the east. The architect of the Propylon was thus one of the first in Greece to employ Corin- thian columns on the exterior of a functional building. Stoa. Previous excavation had shown that the steep slope in front of the Stoa, to its east, preserved remains not only of a complex system of terracing to support the hill but also of a number of buildings at different levels between the Stoa and the central stream of the Sanctuary. In order to investigate the nature and chronology of these structures, two trenches were dug to gain a cross section of the hillside and each structure was examined in more limited tests. The results showed that what had been thought a relatively bare portion of the Sanctuary was, in fact, actively developed from Classical times throughout the history of the Sanctuary. The terracing of this area, between the site of the Theatre at the south and the end of the ridge at the north, was repeatedly revised both before and after the construction of the Stoa. The buildings associated with the successive systems of terracing have not yet been fully explored and their plans and functions remain uncertain. It is now clear, however, that monumental buildings stood in the area from Classical times until well into the Roman period. The northern end of the area was occupied by a rectangular stoa-like building some 22 m. long and more than 6 m. wide, oriented obliquely to the later Stoa. Only a small portion of its original area has been uncovered, but sufficient to show that the build- ing had a long history. A small sample of the fill of the original construction contained pottery of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C., and suggests a date in the second half of the fourth century. Immediately south of this building appeared the north wall of a second similar structure, contemporary with it; though in character and orientation it corresponds to the first, neither its extent nor its plan has yet been determined. It may have been de- stroyed as early as the second century B.c., and in early Imperial times an unrelated structure occupied the area. Of this later building only a tile-paved courtyard, c. 5 m. wide, and a rubble wall have yet been cleared. A Roman Doric capital found nearby may belong to a colonnade around the court. FIG. 53 these rooms, dated the building securely to the early part of EM II. The pottery in the debris above the floor was still chiefly early EM II, though a few EM III sherds occurred high up, and right at the top there were very slight traces of a wall associated with MM pottery at one point. Interesting features of the EM IIA building were two slots, perhaps for wooden beams, and a rectangular 'drain' at ground level in the wall of one compartment. Below part of this building, running under the wall, was a large shallow pit, which contained much pottery; ranging in date from Late Neolithic to Early EM II, but much of it EM I type. Below this, and elsewhere immediately below the floors of the build- ing, were Late Neolithic levels. A depth of nearly three metres has been reached in The fragmentary state of the evidence allows no firm conclusion about the function of this area in the life of the Sanctuary, but the absence of characteristic cult furniture and of votives suggests that it may have served rather for the comfort of visitors than any ritual purpose. CRETE. CENTRAL CRETE Knossos. Neolithic settlement. The aim of the excavations carried out by Professor J. Evans under the auspices of the British School at Athens in 1969 was to extend the results achieved during previous work from 1957-60 and work was carried on simul- taneously in three areas, the West Court, the Central Court, and a sounding near the South House. West Court. In the west Court two 4 m. squares were laid out and these were later joined into an area of 9 x 4 m., which was carried down by the end of the season to the top of the Middle Neolithic deposit. The masonry located in the trial trench just below the surface-paving belongs to part of a well-con- structed building with several long narrow rooms whose walls still stood just over I m. high. Pottery, including a fine spouted basin decorated in red paint (Fig. 53), which was found on the eastern floors of</page><page sequence="26">28 P. M. FRASER the west Court sounding and work will be continued here next season in the lower levels. Although, un- fortunately, no EM I occupation level was located, and the transition from Neolithic to Minoan is not directly attested, the contents of the pit does provide evidence of occupation on the site prior to EM II. Central Court. Four 5 x 5 squares were laid out immediately to the south of the 1957-6o sounding, with the aim of recovering as much as possible of the plan of the apparently large building, which was located in 1960 in the south-east corner of the sound- ing, out of which only a small part could be explored at that time. This building, which belonged to Stratum IIIA (end of M.N.), proved to be II m. long (north to south) and probably about the same east to west, though this is not certain since the eastern extremity lay outside the area excavated. Its plan differs from that of any of those found in the 1957-6o excavations. The outer walls are massive (up to I m. thick) while the interior seems to have contained a series of small compartments divided by lighter walls, some of which may have been roofed (patches of possible paving, not normally found indoors). One seems to have been used for weaving, or at least for storing weaving equipment (clay loom-weights and shuttles) (Fig. 54). FIG. 51 The general layout of this building is comparable with that of the LN remains by Sir Arthur Evans in 1923-24, cleared on the surface of the Central Court and a few metres further West. On the other hand, it is roughly contemporary with the one-roomed 'House A' of the 1957-60 sounding, which suggests that there may have been very considerable variety in the buildings of any one period. The western half of the excavated area lay outside this building and no other substantial remains of walls were found in it, though a thick lense of yellow clay suggested the presence of another building a little further to the West. This would seem to confirm the evidence of the earlier sounding that the buildings were well spaced, with an open area at least 5 m. wide between them. In the south-east corner of the area a wall evidently belonging to another large building was uncovered, and this was found to lie immediately over traces of walls belonging to the building just described. Its orientation, however, was somewhat different. Whereas that of the earlier building agreed with the orientation of the MN and EN II buildings found in the Central Court and the northern trial trench of 1957-60, this wall was laid in the same direction as the north to south walls of the EM II building found in the west Court. Taking into account the evidence we have that the buildings of each phase were normally oriented in the same direction, and that there was considerable conservatism in this matter, the sudden change thus documented may prove to be of considerable significance. Above these two buildings no other connected building remains were identified in the 2 m. of deposit between them and the level of the central Court. Most of this deposit had the character of a fill or tip, perhaps one used over a fairly long period. After the destruction of the two buildings, this ground may well have been considered too uneven for further occupation until levelled. Much of the pottery from these tip levels seems to represent a more advanced stage of Late Neolithic than any represented in the 1957-6o soundings, and several decorative traits were noted which are also characteristic of the Phaistos Neolithic (though not the use of crusting). Similar traits were noted also in pottery from the LN levels in the west Court. M. R. Popham has published an im- portant historical study, based on his unrivalled knowledge of the Late Minoan pottery of the site: The destruc- tion of the Palace at Knossos, Pottery of the late Minoan IIIA Period (Stud. in Medit. Arch. xii, G6teborg, 1970). Amnisos. Excavation of the Mycen- aean houses west of the hill of Palaiochora was carried out in 1967. The well built remains of a house in the sand and be- neath the surface of the sea in the eastern sector were investigated: the structure was in the first place of MM III/LM I date, but underwent modifica- tions in LM IIIA2. In the west sector remains of other houses were cleared (ADelt 23 Chr 2, 404-5)- Mallia. A further campaign was carried out in 1969 in quarter Mu, west of quarter Delta by J.-C. Poursat on behalf of the French School. Investiga- tions of this large proto-palatial area were con- centrated close to quarter Delta, near the point where the 'Hieroglyphic Deposit' was found in 1968 (see AR 1968-69 36). To the east a series of three rectangular rooms was uncovered which formed the basement of an upper story supported by columns. To the south-west further rooms were cleared. The most important single find was of a tablet of accounts,</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1969-70 29 with four inscribed faces, two in hieroglyphs, and seven seal impressions including one hieroglyphic. The final account of the 196o-66 excavations of the Agora of Mallia has now been published by H. and M. Van Effenterre, Mallia, Centre politique (I), L'Agora (Etudes cretoises, xvii, 1969). Hagios Myron (Vrysi). Investigations at this Minoan necropolis (A.S.) yielded funerary pithoi and larnakes, and vases of the Pre-Palatial period, including pithoi with 'bridged' lips, jugs with a truncated mouth and plastic 'eye' and projections in the centre of the body, and an anthropomorphic vase in the form of a woman carrying a jug in her left arm; all these belong to the transitional phase between EM II and MM IA (Ergon 1969, 192-3). FIG. 55 Area of Moni Hodegetrias. Investigation of tombs in this region, begun in 1962 and carried forward in 1966, continued in 1967 (cf. AR 1968-69 37). The existence of a considerable LM III settlement was established at Vathi, about 2 kms. north-east of the tombs at Kephali; considerable stretches of walls, and three treads of a staircase were discovered. East of Kaloi Limenes, on the site of the ancient Lasaia, a considerable Hellenistic-Roman settlement with necro- polis was discovered to have been rifled; a classical stele of Pentelic marble was discovered in the sea (Fig. 55) (ADelt 23 Chr 2, 405-6). EASTERN CRETE Zakros. The excavation of Professor Platon on the Palace continued in 1969 (A.S.). The main activity FIo. 56 two small rooms (M and N) evidently used as oil- repositories, the contents of which were untouched; one of them contained in addition to the usual domestic ware a small stone pithos (Fig. 56) with three relief zones and twelve tongue-shaped lugs or handles. Other store-rooms were excavated and also contained quantities of small vases. Platon gives a detailed account of this and of the other buildings on the site and their relationship to one another and their phases of development (Ergon 1969, I72-90). Lato. In continuation of the work of 1968, MM. P. Ducrey and 0. Picard of the French School cleared the area of the terraces and stairways of the this year was again concentrated on clarifying the structures on the terrace on the slope of the north-east hill and on the investigation of the area of the main gate, the road leading to it from the harbour and the structures close to the gate, which con- tained quantities of shavings and cores of steatite and some bronze tools, and were evidently workshops. The road widened as it turned the side wall of the workshops, while the facade of the rectangular structure north of the road was adjusted to front the road; only one part of this structure could be investi- gated, but this revealed a building of the early Palatial period full of vases and pithoi. One small room contained typical earlier Palatial vase-styles, while another contained, in addition to regular early Palatial pottery, two large barrel-shaped pithoi with relief decoration. The excavation of the slope of the hill confirmed the hypothesis that it was mainly occupied by annexes of the actual palace; five such groups of buildings have so far been investigated. In parti- cular, the partially excavated 'strong building', so named from its powerful Cyclopean external walls, was further excavated, and its three main entrances shown to be on the east side, its north side containing</page><page sequence="28">30 P. M. FRASER FIG. 57 great temple (Fig. 57) and clarified the stages of their construction. In the west part of the lower terrace the structure discovered in 1968 was cleared and identified as a rectangular exedra. The stairways of the agora were also further explored and the prytane- ion cleared (Fig. 58). WEST CRETE Chania. Castello. Excavations of this site con- tinued in 1967, activity being concentrated on a plot south of the Plateia Hagias Aikaterinis, and diagonally opposite the area excavated in 1966. Half the plot was excavated, and the existence of parts of rooms of the post-Palatial period established. An undisturbed layer of LM IIIC date was uncovered, comprising a wall beneath which sections of the walls of two rooms were found containing a wide variety of sherds including LH IIIB, and 'Ephy- raean' cups of Knossian manufacture (ADelt 23 Chr 2, 413-I5). In 1969 excavations continued as a com- bined Greek-Swedish operation. Large quantities ofsherds and vases of MM II-LM IIIA were found in a pit found in 1968, including 'Ephyraean' goblets from Knossos, globular Minoan flasks and imported Cycladic and Mycenaean specimens. Fe- male clay figurines with one hand in front under the breast and the other behind the back were also found, as well as some frag- ments of polychrome fresco. In the trial exca- vation at the east end of the Plateia a late LM IIIB wall was discovered, and revealed undisturbed stratification as far as the late MM level. The absence of LM II and LM IIIA levels, characteristic of the excavations here, may be solved next year: the LM II and LM IIIA pottery is abundant and of good quality. The new trench west of the old excavation area not far from the harbour square yielded a pit with pottery of different periods, the oldest being EM Pyrgos ware, Hagios Onoufrios ware and Vasiliki FIG. 58 DODECANESE Rhodes. Excavations of building plots continued in 1967. More information regarding the road system of the ancient city and of the facades of buildings facing the roads in the late Classical and early Hellenistic periods was collected. In particular, excavation of the OTE site at the corner of Amerikis and 25th March Street, which yielded fragments of Panathenaic amphorae and was therefore probably already built in the earliest period of the city, revealed ware; the bulk of the pottery was MM. The latest find was a black-figure sherd of the sixth century (AAA 1970, I, 100oo-2). Cave of Platyvola. Investigation of this cave was completed in 1967 by the excavation of two levels not explored in 1966. Level III yielded a rich series of pre-Palatial and early Palatial sherds some of which, belonging to small single- handled footless cups, bear a close resemblance to vases found on Kythera. Level IV contained only bones, and it appears that this inaccessible level was used as a cemetery. Outside the cave, almost on the surface, geometric and classical sherds were found (ADelt 23 Chr 2, 415-16). Kastelli Kisamou. Parts of a house with mosaic floors, discovered in roadworks and described as unique in the island, were cleared in 1967. In one room (A) the design consists of a geometrical pattern of meanders surrounding triangles and rectangles containing representations of birds, animals and plants, and in the other (B) a band of geometrical design surrounds a large square divided into nine zones containing pattern compositions and representations of plants; in the centre a centaur and a lion. The building is dated to the third and fourth centuries A.D. (ADelt 23 Chr 2, 416-17).</page><page sequence="29">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1969-70 31 FIG. 59 a good stretch of a building facade and also the west wall of an underground structure (Fig. 59). A number of funerary altars and stelai were also found in various excavations. Operations in Athenagora Street revealed the remains of a factory for making glass beads, which Mrs Weinberg (ADelt 23 Chr 2, 441-2) says is unique in the classical period; some 40,000 beads were recovered of many different types and colours, some containing gold leaf, and she con- cludes: 'These, the first gold-glass fragments found anywhere in Greek lands, suggest that this type of FIG. 6o glass, highly prized in the ancient world, was manu- factured on the island of Rhodes.' Important remains of the city wall came to light in the area of the Acandia harbour: the foundations of a tower, two sections of the wall 45 m. and 30 m. long, and a splendidly constructed ancient drain inside and FIG. 61 FIG. 62 parallel to the wall, spanned by an arched bridge 8 m. wide (Fig. 6o). Isolated sec- tions of the south and north fortifications were also found. A few tombstones were discovered in the necropolis area of Hagios Ioannis (ADelt 23 Chr 2, 432-48). Mr Konstantinopoulos has published a summary account, with plan, of the street- grid of ancient Rhodes, bringing up to date the fundamental work of J. Kondis (AAA 1970, I, 48-51). Cos. The Museum has been enriched by two dedicatory reliefs to the Graces, found in 1966 at Mesaria, 6 km.west of the city of Cos. On one the Graces are dancing round a low altar, while in the top corner the head of Pan peeps out from a rock; in front of the Graces stands the dedicant. Below is the inscription [--?]evo; Xapi-caatv er0oKdiFLotg aVeOKEyVi ELtOdvivp vid' Xdpto; ar[rasev], probably of the late fifth century B.c. (Fig. 6x). The second shows four Graces standing front- ally, with a small figure represented below, reclining in a cave. The inscription on the fascia above the relief reads, in letters the second century B.C., JAatKpdrai Haaia Xdptatv (Fig. 62). The British School at Athens P. M. FRASER</page></plain_text>
