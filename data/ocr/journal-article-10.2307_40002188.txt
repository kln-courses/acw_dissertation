<plain_text><page sequence="1">"HAIL! GLADDENING LIGHT": A NOTE ON JOHN KEBLE'S VERSE TRANSLATIONS John K. Hale LyraApostolica (1836) was one of the earlier and less contentious products of the Oxford Movement. Equally with the Tracts it sought to revive the Church of England by a return to the spirituality of the early Christian centuries. A natural way to achieve this return was to translate devotional lyrics from these centuries, and John Keble stands out among the contributors to Lyra Apostolica for such work. Among his translations the outstanding one is "Hail! Gladdening light," for the magnificence of the original Phos hilaron lifts Keble's poetic performance. By the same token, however, it was no more possible then than now for a translation to render exactly a great original, to capture entirely its inward spirit. It is instructive to compare the Greek with Keble's English, not simply to see what he omits or changes, and imports from his own sensibility and that of his age and culture, but also to speculate that by these omissions, alterations, and importations the version foreshadows the future of the Oxford Movement, the decisive parting of the ways between Keble and his fellow-contributor Newman. Keble's Greek text reads: phos hilaron hagias doxes athanatou Patros ouraniou hagiou makaros Iesou Christe elthontes epi tou heliou dusin idontes phos hesperinon humnoumen Patera kai Huion kai Hagion Pneuma Theou axios ei en pasi kairois humneisthai phonais hosiais Huie Theou zoen ho didous dio ho kosmos se doxazei and a literal prose construe of the passage is: Jesus Christ, gladdening light of the holy glory of the immortal Father who is heavenly holy and blessed, as we come to the sun's setting and see the light of the evening star we sing to the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit of God. You are worthy to be praised in song at all times with reverent voices[?]5 Son of God, giver of life; for this, the universe gives you glory. The hymn is the only Christian hymn extant from before 300 A.D., and was sung at the lamplighting ceremony in the catacombs.1 It has no discernible *For this information and for other help I am grateful to Erik Routley, the noted Congregational minister and scholar and hymnodist, to whose memory this writing is dedicated with gratitude and affection. 92</page><page sequence="2">The Greek text has filled and empowered Keble's imagination, as many details prove. "Gladdening," for hilaron, is strong and unexpected and Anglo-Saxon: alternatives like "joyful" or "glorious," used by some later hymnodists, are weaker and tamer, more Latinate and limp. "Of His pure glory poured" is a vigorous enough metaphor, light being poured in a stream like water, perhaps the Water of Life. "Holiest of Holies," also not in the Greek, is a spirited hyperbole, going one better than the Biblical "Holy of Holies," the innermost shrine of the Temple of Solomon. Rhyme is another addition to the Greek, and "poured/Lord" is only one instance of Keble's good rhyming, strong in sound and corroborative in sense. And to praise his rhyming is to see that his rhythm is better. Fundamentally iambic, the verse is left free to find the length best for each part of the sense, to expand and contract according to the needs of the act of contemplation itself. Notice particularly the confident swelling of praise from the short line 8 to the vision of the long last line. Nevertheless, even in such successes we can perceive impoverishment and distortion. "Holiest of Holies" for example seems on further reflection a gilding of "Holy of Holies" - a vulgarizing like the overinsistent upper- JOHN K. HALE / 93 meter or division into stanzas, most likely because it was sung by a solo voice. It should be thought of as a passage of prose, an ecstatic prose with impassioned odelike transitions. (I have set it out in nine lines merely because Keble did.) The thought, notwithstanding this freedom of form, has clear shape and order. It moves from the "light of the holy glory" to the "light of the evening star" to the "glory" {doxazei echoes doxes from the beginning) returned by the created universe to its creator-source. Along the way the thought also moves about dancelike among the persons of the Trinity. The whole effect, then, is unadorned and self- forgetting. It embodies that extraordinary certainty of communion with the outpoured glory of the Divine which the Oxford Movement sought to win back for their own age. Much of the ecstatic circling of thought is regained by Keble - much, but not all. He is moved in other directions too, sometimes by self-chosen exigencies of meter and rhyme, sometimes by thoughts of his own or of his period which cloud the intensity and purity of the Greek version. Keble's poetic translation reads Hail! Gladdening LIGHT, of His pure glory poured, Who is th' immortal FATHER, heavenly, blest, Holiest of Holies- JESUS CHRIST our LORD! Now we are come to the sun's hour of rest, The lights of evening round us shine. We hymn the FATHER, SON, and HOLY SPIRIT divine! Worthiest art Thou at all times to be sung With undefiled tongue, SON of our GOD, GIVER of life, alone! Therefore in all the world, Thy glories, LORD, they own.</page><page sequence="3">94 / VICTORIAN POETRY casing of the names of the Trinity. Likewise, "of His pure glory poured" is not simply a vigorous metaphor but a sound required (like the inverted word order) by the rhyme with "LORD." Also noticeable is the awkward connection of "His" with "Who"; the effortless interdependent genitives of the Greek original contrast with these syntactical awkwardnesses of the uninflected English translation. "Translationese" in diction, and contriv- ance to gain rhyme, are widespread. Keble mistranslates phonais ("With undefiled tongue") to make the rhyme with "sung," and cheats by adding "-ed" to gain the sixth syllable: the self-imposed exigencies of meter and rhyme do after all embarrass Keble. More important, they distract attention from the vision they are meant to assist. Is it in fact clear enough that the hymn is addressed to Christ throughout? Questions arise even about the resounding finish: in "Thy glories, LORD, they own," who exactly are "they"? and do they "admit" the glories (grudgingly) or "possess" them (in what sense, and is it not too late and too distracting to imply that the worshippers share the glories)? As this last example may suggest, however, Keble's alterations of the meaning are more interesting than his stylistic diminutions since they reveal more of his personal vision and of the spirituality of his milieu. Take the lines, "Now we are come to the sun's hour of rest, / The lights of evening round us shine." The lines are not at all weak in themselves, yet their strength is not that of the original at all. I thought, till I found the Greek, that it would be; that the touching, perhaps naive anthropomorphism of the sun - even the sun - needing to rest stood for the ordinary (human and animal) need to rest, as perhaps a late and unconscious reminiscence of Homer's chariot of the sun bathing at the end of the day in the springs of the ocean. But the Greek has no anthropomorphism here at all; only the solemnity of the setting of the sun. Keble has elaborated and allegorized, has shifted the focus away from the outward phenomenon toward the human receiving of that phenomenon. Similarly in the next line the Greek version speaks of a single light, the phos hesperinon, which means the evening star though it echoes the phos hilaron of the opening and connects with the light being lit at the service while the singer sings the words. Keble lessens the echo by introducing "lights," plural: these may be the stars in general, or human lamps in general, but either obscures the particular of the Greek. And he makes these lights surround us, instead of simply being seen by us: he emphasizes the seers at cost to the seen. Especially if the "lights of evening" are the lamps in people's houses, there is a change to a weakly social, mainly temporal reference from the original contemplation of the single celestial light. I confess to disliking the imported human-centered- ness, the cozy piety of the lights of Home, which thrust aside the rapt adoration of the Greek original.</page><page sequence="4">JOHN K. HALE / 95 But does this change from the self-abandoning to the self-conscious typify Keble's spirituality, or his kind of Anglicanism, or his age at large, or (going wider still) an English as opposed to Greek spirituality? The last possibility is suggested by a writer on Greek hymnody: While in the English hymn the Scripture fact or type or doctrine is the text or motto, and the body of the hymn consists of the human blessings, warnings or enlightenments that flow from it, the mind of the Greek poet rests and delights in the Revelation itself, and leaves the human references subordinated, hinted, or even unexpressed. Visible everywhere, this contrast is most marked in the absorbed rapture with which the Greek poet hymns the Divine Perfections and the Incarnation, when compared with our self-regarding mode of praise.2 Julian's comment is certainly true. Even though he speaks of poetry, and of Greek hymns at large (and phos hilaron is Roman despite its Greek), he pinpoints the intrusive humanness of lines 5-6, and of line 10 also. But other possible explanations may be true as well. English hymns are not inevitably "self-regarding" in their mode of praise: witness our medieval lyrics, the carol tradition, and texts by some of the seventeenth-century poets. Witness also the best of Newman's religious verse, "Praise to the holiest in the height," from The Dream ofGerontius (1865). Here is no self-consciousness, no swerving from the contemplation of the divine to the social. Instead, Newman's words epitomize that union of the individual soul with God, "solus cum solo," which was to him the essence of religion.3 He of course found it out in the Catholic Church, Keble in the Anglican. But it is an intriguing sidelight, on nineteenth-century life and thought as well as poetry, that where Keble might have seized on it for the Tractarian Movement, in this poem from Lyra Apostolica, he muted it. 2John Julian, D.
