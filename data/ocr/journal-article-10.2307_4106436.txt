<plain_text><page sequence="1">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. By MR. C. A. MACE, PROF. G. F. STOUT, DR. A. C. EWING, and PROF. C. D. BROAD. I.-By MR. C. A. MACE. I. I PROPOSE to discuss certain doctrines of Prof. Stout concerning causal process*; but before getting down to details I should like to be reassured as to my interpretation of the general thesis in the exposition of which these doc- trines appear to occupy so central a place. There are, I think, two general issues with which Prof. Stout is largely concerned. The first is this. To many of us the world in which we live presents itself as predominantly a world of merely material things. It contains minds also, but these minds are limited and, apart from certain very dubious exceptions, they exist only in indissoluble attachment to material things of a very distinctive kind, i.e., to living organisms and perhaps only to organisms of a fairly complex constitution. We see, at any rate, nothing at all highly suggestive of the presence of mind in the independent behaviour of inanimate things. There are, however, some philosophers who hold that in this we are mistaken. Mind, they believe, has a more extensive range of operation ; some of them would say that it permeates the whole realm of being. The second issue may be roughly stated as follows. There are certain doubts, of the kind suggested by the reflections of Hume, concerning the logical foundations of science. It is not so much that those who have been infected with these doubts are in the least inclined to believe that scientific laws are in fact false, but that they * For these views I rely chiefly on the treatment of the subject by Prof. Stout in his Mind and Matter.</page><page sequence="2">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 23 find it difficult to formulate in a clear and unobjectionable way the logical character of the arguments by which their validity is established. These difficulties arise in a particu- larly acute form in connexion with the interpretation of assertions about causal connexion. These two issues are commonly supposed to be inde- pendent. A philosopher might hold that nature is per- vaded with mind and yet have no suggestion to make concerning the foundations of our beliefs concerning causal laws. Conversely, he might believe himself to have a sound logical doctrine pertaining to the basis of science without committing himself to any assertions concerning the place of mind in nature. But if I understand Prof. Stout aright, he would deny this independence. His escape from scepticism concerning inductive generalization is based upon an analysis of causal process which, if correct, would entail that mind or something " akin to mind " is operative wherever one thing acts or tends to act upon another. In outline, the argument would seem to run as follows. The essential features of causal process are to be found in facts of the kind which we express in the form : " So and so tends to do something," e.g., a stretched bow tends to unbend. In the case of scientific statements of this kind it is, perhaps, sufficient to say that they are equivalent to some assertion of the form : If p happens then q will happen, e.g., if the archer moves his hand, then the bow will unbend. But this analysis, Prof. Stout suggests, is wholly incorrect when the word " tendency " is employed in its natural and every- day sense-as the " plain man " would use it. It is not merely that in this latter usage we should need to substitute other antecedents or other consequents in the hypothetical statement. No single hypothetical statement and no set of hypothetical statements will give the analysis in question. On the contrary, the intrinsic nature of an active tendency is to be positively apprehended in the manner in which we apprehend colours and sounds. It is so apprehended primarily and directly in the motor experiences involved in our own doing and enduring. Whilst a motor process</page><page sequence="3">24 C. A. MACE. involves a very complex sense experience, what alone gives it the character of action or active tendency is the presence of the will to move, where " will " is taken in the wide sense of conation or appetency. If this be in fact what the plain man is judging when he asserts that a stretched bow tends to unbend, and if he in such a case ever judges correctly, it follows immediately that the view which would restrict the presence of mind to centres of organic life is radically mistaken; but how precisely this affects the methodological issue remains to be further explained. My first difficulty-one that prevents me either accepting or rejecting with conviction the conclusion of Prof. Stout's argument-is that I do not clearly see how much or how little this analysis is intended to imply. "Volition," " conation " and " appetency " are terms that in current psychology usage are inadequately defined. They cover experiences and processes ranging from complex deliberative actions down to sequences of behaviour which appear to be almost automatic. My part in this discussion, therefore, will largely consist in the endeavour to determine the character of some of these processes in somewhat greater detail. I propose to select one example of the more complex volitional operations and one from the other end of the scale. II. Let us examine first a highly complex conation-one of a type that I propose to describe as an " explicit and specific volitional act." Consider an action such as that of shutting and fastening a door under conditions in which it is not merely habitual or otherwise automatic, but requires thought. Suppose that through some defect in the latch I am compelled to fold a piece of paper to form a wedge in order to achieve my end. Suppose, further, that the employment of this device is not merely a repetition of something that I have done before, but constitutes a genuine act of deliberate and intelligent contrivance, just</page><page sequence="4">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 25 as it would have been, presumably, had the action been performed by one of K6hler's apes. In this situation we have a complex experience which issues in a sequence of the form el, e2, e3 ... E where E represents the terminal desired situation (the fastened door) and e1, e2, e3 . . . the phases of the process leading up to E (the selecting and folding of the paper, its spatio-temporal adjustment to the door, &amp;c.). In so far as the process conforms to what I am describing as an explicit and specific votional act, the following facts at least will be the case : (1) The sequence e,, e2, e3 . . . E will be in its specific nature thought of orforeseen by me in a sense in which " being thought of" is equivalent to being imagined, supposed or conceived as a possibility, and in a sense in which all these expressions entail that what is thought of is " present to mind." (2) el, e2, e3 . . . E will be consciously desired by me in a sense of " desire," which I should employ if I were asked what I was trying to do and said, on introspection, "I desire to fold this paper so as to make a wedge which when placed in such and such a position will stop the door from flying open."* These two facts are not independent, since the sense in which el, e2, e3 . .. E is desired by me is one which entails that el, e2, e3.. . . E is present to my mind. I wish to * It should be noted that these two features are present only in so far as the action conforms to the requirements of my definition. Of course, no action ever is of this nature. We probably never do desire that a certain end state determinately conceived should be brought about by an equally determinately conceived sequence of events. Our volitions are always more or less indeterminate in conception. We desire that an end state of a certain sort should be brought about by a certain sort of means which are also more or less vaguely described. The conception of an explicit and determinate deliberate volition is, however, of value as an ideal limit to which our actual conscious volitions more or less approximate.</page><page sequence="5">26 C. A. MACE. stress this fact because in one of the most important senses of the word " conation " the assertion that anyone is having a conative experience is one that entails that he is expe- riencing a desire in this sense. I am therefore anxious to know whether it is also in this sense that Prof. Stout is using the word. If he is, then he should, and I think would, in consistency assert that when the plain man judges that a stretched bow tends to unbend he is judging something which entails that some one (other than the archer) desires something in a manner which further entails the presence of foresight. I gather that this is in fact a part of Prof. Stout's view, though, of course, it is not part of his view either that the bow itself desires and foresees anything or that what is desired and foreseen is anything corresponding to E, the literal terminal state of affairs to which the active process leads. But whilst in consistency Prof. Stout should and would assert this, it is not what he chiefly stresses in his analysis. What he wishes chiefly to stress can, I think, best be seen by inquiring how my volition actually brings E about. There are some accounts of voluntary action which appear to read simply as follows :-I foresee el, e2, e3 . .. E, I desire e,, e2, e3 . . . E. Then either I perform a peculiar kind of mental act corresponding to the imperative " Let it be so," or I merely abstain from entertaining contrary possibilities before my mind and the sequence of events occurs in fact. In some accounts of this type it is not necessary even for me to desire el, e2, e3 . . . E. On the extreme form of the ideo-motor theory of volition the occurrence of a mental image of a physically possible bodily act is the sole essential mental condition of the occurrence of that act. But I am fairly well satisfied that Prof. Stout would not admit the truth of this kind of view. It omits something that is vital on his analysis of conation- the experiences we have in actually exerting muscular effort. We can perhaps, in some manner, conceive the operation of a Divine Will in creating a world without actually pushing or pulling things about. But such a conception would be radically contrasted with the experience</page><page sequence="6">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 27 of active tendency which is in any way relevant to the analysis of causation. I would suggest that there are three ways in which the sensory content in the experience of effort is relevant to the doctrine which Prof. Stout wishes to defend. In the first place, the conception of a purely mental antecedent such as an image or a "wish" causing a physical consequent is precisely one of the things which Prof. Stout is concerned to deny. To assert that a purely mental event, my desiring E, issues in a purely physical event, so far from throwing any light upon causal process in general, is itself utterly unintelligible. The sequence to be invoked to illuminate causal process is one in which a certain psycho-physical antecedent is involved. In the case of such an action as that of shutting a door, Prof. Stout would hold, if I have rightly understood him, that the muscular sensations serve, among other things, to present the character of the antecedent which produces this effect. Poltergeists apart, it is only embodied selves that can shut doors. But in order to know that I am shutting the door I do not have to look at myself doing so. Whereas the door and its movement may be in large part presented by visual data, I, the agent, and the event in me which initiates the movement are primarily apprehended through bodily sense data, and of these the muscular sensations are the most important. Secondly, the modal sense quality characteristic of motor experience is one which common sense refers to external objects such as bent springs and heavy weights. There is a sophisticated view according to which the quality of strain is supposed to appear only in the body of the percipient ; but this is sheer sophistication and, Prof. Stout would say, fails adequately to describe even the appearances in the case. Just as the warmth of a warm bath seems not to be located in our own bodies, but to pervade the whole bathful of water, so the quality which the physiological psychologist may refer to the proprioceptive senses appears to pervade, or to be located in, the physical objects which we push and pull about. When struggling along with a</page><page sequence="7">28 C. A. MACE. heavy bag the weight and the " pull " of the bag appear to be in the bag itself. This character is with ease distin- guished both from the strain located in the muscles of the arm and from the pressure located on the surface of the hand by which the bag is held. Even though this be an entirely illusory projicience, the fact itself must be admitted. It provides, at any rate, an important part of Prof. Stout's analysis. But, though important, it is not, I think, the crucial point. We might agree with the first point, viz., that the agent in a transaction of the kind under consideration is an embodied self, i.e., presented through muscular sensations as a material as well as a mental being. We might agree to the second point-that the physical objects against which we exert ourselves sensibly appear to exert themselves against us in the sense of being centres of strains and pressures apprehended in terms of the qualities of motor sensations. We might even go further. We might agree that the purely scientific view of a physical transaction is essentially abstract and incomplete, and that a " complete " description would involve the attribution of the so-called secondary qualities to physical things. And if we agreed that common sense not only tends to suppose that physical objects are literally and independently coloured and noisy, but is right in doing so, there would be nothing very revolutionary in supposing that it is in like manner right in supposing them to be pervaded by qualities similar to those which we apprehend through the proprioceptive senses. But supposing we granted all this, what I by no means see so clearly is that we should be committed to the belief that the interactions of physical things entail the presence in what is commonly regarded as inanimate nature of something akin to our own striving. What I do not see is that when the stretched bow tends to unbend anything is involved of the nature of appetency or conation. It would seem, however, that Prof. Stout's analysis of motor experience is intended to carry this third implication. But I confess I can only guess at the manner in which this more important consequence is supposed to follow,</page><page sequence="8">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 29 and I state my guess only for the sake of receiving elucida- tion through correction. Psychologists have frequently commented upon the unique relation of our " motor presentations" to the will. Whilst lights and sounds, tastes and smells, come and go in relative independence of our wishes, motor sensations are directly under the control of the will. The sensations of muscular contraction vary in concomitance with our wishes, and are thus directly expressive of conation in the relevant sense with which we are concerned. If, therefore, it could be maintained that this relation is invariable, this fact in conjunction with my previous admissions would substantiate Prof. Stout's funda- mental contention. The argument would then run as follows : In performing an action such as that of pushing a heavy weight I have the following experiences: (i) I experience a complex of motor presentations (sensations of muscular effort) which exhibit a detailed correlation with a complex conation (the desire that such and such movements should occur). This may be stated in the form: I experience a sequence of stresses and strains expressive of my striving. (ii) There appears also to be a set of opposing stresses and strains located in the object which I am trying to move. (iii) As I experience the stresses and strains located in me as correlated with the conation of which they are the expression, so the counter-stresses and strains located in the external object are " taken to be " similarly correlated with and the expression of a counter striving. Presumably on the basis of such experiences I should tend to judge, when I visually apprehend two physical objects in similar relations to those between myself and an object that I am trying to move, that the interactions of</page><page sequence="9">30 C. A. MACE. these physical objects involve corresponding stresses and strains correlated with corresponding strivings. I will content myself, at this stage, with brief comments on this position. The argument does not, of course, profess to be demonstrative. Primarily it consists in a psycho- logical analysis of what, under certain conditions, appears to be the case to some percipient. We cannot even say that it offers an analysis of our everyday experiences of action. On the contrary, we may be surprised by the conclusion reached. But this would be explained by the consideration that we are not the percipients in question. We are surprised because we are to a greater or less extent sophisticated by scientific theory. More strictly, the analysis professes to be an account of what the plain man judges so far as he remains free from sophistication, or of what we, in fact, judge only in so far as, by an effort of abstraction, we allow ourselves to be influenced only by the immediate data of the case freed from the influence of scientific opinion. Granting that it is possible to define conditions under which the plain man does in fact so judge, would he not be grossly deluded ? To this I understand Prof. Stout to reply : " If you think so, show how the mistake arose ; the burden of proof rests with you." My own view is this. I am impressed by the psycho- logical analysis according to which common-sense judg- ments concerning material things are based in part upon data from the proprioceptive senses. But I am not at all happy about what appears to be the inference from this to the presence of conation in a sense according to which if a spring is the locus of a strain, then someone or something must be wanting something and in some measure must have present to mind what is wanted. But I may quite well be mistaken in supposing that Prof. Stout really wishes to make this inference. Admittedly, this interpretation has been suggested by the analysis of a complex form of conation, whereas what is really asserted may be better ascertained from the analysis of much simpler cases. It is, however, in my opinion, precisely such simpler</page><page sequence="10">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 31 cases which shew more clearly eertain features which enable the plain man to decide when the operation of a tendency is, and when it is not, indicative of the presence of something akin to our own striving. III. The term " conation " has been employed by psycho- logists not only with reference to a certain type of experience, but also with reference to a certain type of process, viz., what is described as a conative process. Those who attach importance to the concept of conation do in general hold that a conative process is invariably associated with conative experience, but if this is so it must, I think, be defended on empirical grounds; the one does not entail the other. That this is so becomes clearer if it be agreed that what psychologists commonly mean by a conative process is identical with what philosophers more usually describe as a teleological process. The latter term belongs to a philosophical tradition, the former to a psychological tradition. At first sight it might appear that a conative or teleo- logical process might be defined in the manner in which Dr. Broad defines a teleological system.* That is, we might define it as any process which brings into existence or terminates in a " teleological system," or more generally in a " teleological state of affairs." The latter would be defined by the two requirements specified by Dr. Broad, viz., (i) the state of affairs must have the characteristics which might have been expected if it had been arranged by some intelligent being to fulfil a purpose he had in mind, and (ii) further examination reveals additional features in this state of affairs in accord with this hypothesis. Such a definition does not, of course, imply that the state of affairs does in fact realize an actual purpose, but that it has certain features which would be present in a state of affairs which did in fact realize a purpose. * The Mind and its Place in Nature, p. 82.</page><page sequence="11">32 C. A. MACE. A definition of this kind, however, is difficult to apply without letting in cases which one wishes to exclude. Given a meteorological system involving a distribution of rainfall which encourages certain plants and tends to destroy others, this system would have precisely the features which might be expected if it had been designed by a being who preferred the existence of the former to that of the latter. And if there be any class of plants which are, in fact, favoured by the distribution of rainfall in the world and another class that is adversely affected, there is no doubt that further investigation would reveal facts which accord with the hypothesis. The difficulty, in general terms, is that given any state of affairs or any system it is possible to conceive some purpose with which the existence of that system or state of affairs would accord. Even a completely chaotic world-one that precluded the possi- bility of a scientific account of its structure--would conform to the conditions, since this kind of world would admirably fulfil the purpose of a creator who wished to bewilder his creatures and to check the growth of an immoderate intellectual conceit. Are there not, by the way, theologians who hold that this is in fact the case ? Perhaps the difficulty could be met by the specification of further conditions, but I prefer not to define a teleological process by reference to a teleological system, but to define the system by reference to the process. Thus we might say that a teleological system is one that is constructed by a teleological process (usually also for use in a teleological process). Whether organisms are covered by this defini- tion as well as artificial machines requires special discussion, but they, too, can be defined by reference to such processes, and in a manner which indicates their important dif- ferences from artificial machines. An organism is a system some of the activities of which are teleological processes, whilst the activities of a machine never are. This, of course, puts the whole burden on the definition of a teleological process. This type of process is, I think, to be defined by reference to its form. Consider a sequence of action of the kind which has</page><page sequence="12">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 33 been very persistently studied by psychologists who have concerned themselves with animal behaviour. The case of Thorndike's cat is a classical example. A hungry cat is placed within a cage from which it can escape by clawing in a suitable manner at a ring suspended in the cage and connected with the latch of the door. The cat engages in a variety of apparently random movements of loco- motion, clawing and biting at the bars of the cage and so forth until, in the course of these movements, it happens, more or less by chance, to perform the operation which effects its release. If the cat is returned to the cage this procedure is repeated. But with continued repetitions of the situation it is found that there is a progressive decrease in the time required for the cat to effect its escape. This is due to the fact that movements which, in fact, do not contribute to its release, recur less frequently and movements which do contribute to release occur with increasing frequency or earlier in the series. This general tendency has been observed in an immense variety of cases, and in this manner even complicated chains of action may be learned. In a sequence of this kind there are three features of interest : (i) It is evoked by a negative condition E' and is such that the introduction of a contrasting condition, E, at any time in the sequence would terminate the process in question. (ii) It is such that (so far as E may be present in varying degrees) any action which increases the degree of E tends to be continued or repeated, whilst any action which decreases the degree of E tends to be discontinued. (iii) It is such that with repetition of the process con- stituent actions which favour E tend to be stabilized whilst actions which are adverse to E tend to be eliminated, with the result that the process as a whole approximates to a form in which it consists of a set of component actions performed in a certain C</page><page sequence="13">34 C. A. MACE. order which (a) performed in that order are suffi- cient to produce E and (b) are such that the omission of any action would prevent the occurrence of E. Any train of actions conforming to this description would, I think, be commonly described as a conative or teleological process. The definition makes no claim to economy or elegance, and some qualifications and amend- ments might be necessary to cover special cases, but I trust that it is sufficiently near the mark to indicate the sort of process with which I am concerned. Certain observations may serve to correct some of the defects in its description. In the first place, I think it would be generally agreed that the definition really does apply to something, and that what it applies to is a train of activity of a peculiar and distinctive kind. Secondly, and this is a point I wish to emphasize, the definition does not directly entail the presence of con- sciousness. It is theoretically possible that a purely physical process might conform to the description. Nevertheless, I am tempted to believe that this, in point of fact, is the kind of process which Prof. Stout in his discussion of active tendencies chiefly has in mind. At least, if I am permitted to interpret his statements as referring to a process of this kind, I find so much more in his doctrine which I can understand and with which I can agree. Prof. Stout speaks of an active tendency as finding expression in a process which exhibits a characteristic unity, and of this as a kind of unity which varies in degree. He suggests that a tendency of this kind does not admit of analysis in terms of anything that could be expressed solely in hypothetical statements. In our awareness of it we apprehend its intrinsic nature in a manner which is similar to our awareness of colours and sounds. We apprehend in it, further, something which is akin in nature to our own experience of striving. These statements so far as they apply to the kind of active tendency exhibited by a conative</page><page sequence="14">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 35 tendency, as I have defined it, are all statements with which I feel strongly inclined to agree. My difficulty with Prof. Stout's references to the unity of processes expressive of active tendencies is that such processes seem to me to have more than one kind of unity. They have the kind of unity which is expressed by saying that they do not consist of " loose and separate events," but there is a different and further kind of unity implied in speaking of the peculiar unity exhibited by an active tendency " in its development in the direction of its own fulfilment." This kind of unity, in part at least, consists in that which I have endeavoured to define as characteristic of processes initiated by an E' and terminated by an E. This unity certainly varies in degree, and its several degrees are represented by the successive forms assumed in the transition from the initial relatively random form to the final more systematic form of the process. Moreover, whilst such processes can be defined in a manner which does not entail the presence of mind, it is, I am prepared to believe, highly probable that they occur only where mind is operative. I confess I do not see at all clearly how this can be established, but I am fairly satisfied that the presence of the form in question in any process constitutes the principal criterion on the basis of which we do, in fact, attribute experiences to the lower animals and to persons other than ourselves. One fact to which I attach significance is that both in the final and in the initial forms of the process, when the behaviour in question is our own, we find a curiously detailed corre- spondence between the features observed in the behaviour itself and certain features in the experience as introspectively cognized. To E there corresponds an object of appetition, and to E' an object of aversion, and in the final form of the process the successive actions constitute an e,, e2, e3 . . . &amp;c., of which it could be said that they are precisely the means which an intelligent being might select in order to obtain what he desired. It is in this sense that we may say that even an instinctive behaviour cycle is carried through as if it were the expression of a design. And c2</page><page sequence="15">36 C. A. MACE. although the prior history of this cycle shows that it has not in fact been designed, this prior history does encourage us to believe that it is at all stages of its development the expression of (short range) pre-cognition and desire. It shares a similarity of form with various kinds of conative experience less developed than the explicit volitional act. Let it be granted, then, that some arguments can be adduced in support of the hypothesis that mind is present whenever a chain of activity is observed which assumes a teleological form ; what would follow ? This would afford an extremely important consideration in any attempt to ascertain the range of incidence of mind in Nature, and would almost certainly commit us to the admission of its operation in many places where biologists, at least, are extremely loth to ascribe it. And, for my own part, I am quite prepared to believe that on this issue Prof. Stout is right. This admission commits me to a substantial measure of agreement with his thesis, but two substantial differences remain : (i) I do not find the required criterion present in the behaviour of stretched bows and of springs which are tending to unbend. If the plain man is tempted on the basis of his own motor experiences to ascribe conation to the counter-forces with which he has to deal he is, I think, able to correct this first impression by the patent absence in the behaviour of material things of the most important features of teleological form. The unity of an active tendency, it has been agreed, varies in degree; but the range of variation, I would suggest, is completely covered within the limits provided by the commonly accepted phenomena of life. The limits of life are the limits of teleological form. (ii) It would follow that the facts with which Prof. Stout is concerned can be invoked in explanation of causal process only in the special case in which a causal sequence assumes the teleological form. It throws</page><page sequence="16">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 37 no light on causality in general. On the contrary, some simpler notion of causality is already pre- supposed in the very definition of teleological form. A teleological sequence is a more or less economical arrangement of causes in a manner which secures the realization of an end. I propose to devote the final section of this paper to a brief discussion of what I take to be the relation between these two types of process-the merely mechanical and the teleological. IV. With regard to the causal relation in general-mechanical causation*-the chief problem, to my mind, is to state wherein precisely what is commonly called the " regularity " view is wrong. That this view is mistaken-in its simplest form, at any rate-almost everyone agrees. A more satisfactory analysis must, I think, comply with at least the following conditions. To assert that a causes b is to assert (i) that a is associated with b (in the statistical sense of " association "), but it is to assert something more. Further, it is to assert (ii) that A is correlated with B (when A and B are " determinables " of which a and b are relatively specific determinations), but again it is to assert something more. These two conditions are equivalent to the assertion that it is significant to say that a is associated with b or that A is correlated with B and yet a is not the cause of b nor b the cause of a. What we principally have in mind when we assert that two variables are correlated and neither is causally depen- dent on the other is the fact that they neither stand in a certain relation of adjunction nor are they directly * I employ the expression " mechanical causation " merely as a convenient equivalent for " causation as the notion is commonly employed in science," not in the stricter sense of " purely dynamical causation."</page><page sequence="17">38 C. A. MACE. connected by any intervening chain of events-at most they are joint effects of a common cause. It would, there- fore, seem to be presupposed in statements of this kind that " continuity " is an essential element in the analysis of causal connexion. This continuity is usually conceived in spatio-temporal terms, but I do not think that merely spatio-temporal continuity will suffice. There is also continuity of a qualitative kind. If a is the cause of b, then b must exhibit a species of qualitative continuity with a. This condition, perhaps, appears to be more evident when stated in a contrapositive form. If b is an effect of a and exhibits qualitative discontinuity from a, then some factor other than a must be included among its causal conditions. In the case of a ball rolling smoothly along a level surface the movement from p2 to P3 is suffi- ciently accounted for by the prior movement from p, to p2 when p1, p,, p3 are in a straight line, but if the movement from p2 to p3 exhibits an abrupt angular deflection from the path p1 to p2 we invoke some other factor, such as an irregularity in the surface, to account for this discontinuity. Commonly the additional factor invoked is the antecedent " nature " of the medium to which the effect in question is referred and of which it is conceived to be a " state." A series of disturbances occur in the outer air, is followed by a corresponding sequence of disturbances in the auditory nerve, which again is followed by a corresponding sequence of auditory sensations. In virtue of the features in respect of which the three series of events are similar (their " formal " properties) and of their temporal continuity, we are tempted to regard each succession as the effect of its predecessor, whilst their differences are attributed to the intrinsic nature of the media in which they occur. In the passage from sound waves to auditory neural impulses this procedure is fairly plain sailing, for we have indepen- dent sources of information with regard to the nature of the air and of the nervous tissues. In the transition from the second to the third phase we lack this independent information. In consequence, we are led either (with Prof. Stout) to deny that the sequence is of the purely</page><page sequence="18">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 39 causal type or to adopt some such desperate expedient as that of Ward in postulating a pre-existent psychoplasm to the intrinsic nature of which the discontinuity is to be referred. But I doubt whether correlation, even when supple- mented by continuity, is sufficient to provide a complete analysis of causality, as the term is commonly employed. On this matter I find myself in substantial agreement with Dr. Ewing in his contention that an analysis of causal connexions reveals the presence of relations of entailment.* I differ, if I do differ, only in regard to the grounds on which this view appears to be maintained. If I understand him correctly, Dr. Ewing does not think that, apart from certain dubious glimmerings of intuition in psychological cases, we ever directly apprehend any necessary connexions between causes and effects. They would be directly evident only to a superior intelligence. We, on the other hand, are justified in believing such relations to be present only by reason of a somewhat roundabout argument with reference to the conditions under which scientific know- ledge is possible. To me it seems a little queer that the plain man should be so convinced (as Dr. Ewing and I agree he is) that there are necessary connexions between causes and effects if, in point of fact, he never sees them. For my part, I am prepared to let the case for necessary connexions stand or fall according to the direct evidence available. I think I can see, in certain cases, how these relations are involved. It is, I think, of fundamental importance in this matter to distinguish the cases in which causal connexion is problematically inferred from those in which we observe causal sequence in a more direct way. Those who deny the presence of necessary connexions are, I suspect, unduly influenced by the former cases. We believe that sunshine is the cause of the growth of flowers and that poison is the cause of death, and in such cases we certainly do not observe any necessity in the effect. But we equally certainly * A Defence of Causality, Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Vol. XXXIII.</page><page sequence="19">40 C. A. MACE. in these cases do not see at all clearly how these effects are brought about. If there be any necessity in a causal sequence, it is likely to be seen only where we are in a position to know precisely what we are dealing with and what exactly is happening when these things undergo change. Of such favourable conditions a familiar example will, I think, serve as illustration. I am presented with two convex sense data, one red (A) and another white (B), and generally of the appearance which would lead me to suppose that I am looking at a couple of billiard balls. A is stationary at a place p, and B is approaching this place with considerable velocity. What can I demonstrably infer with regard to the development of the situation if and when B reaches the place p ? Those who deny that causality involves necessary connexion rightly point out that I certainly cannot demonstrably infer that A or B will behave as in point of fact billiard balls do behave under such conditions. But that is not to say that no effects whatever are entailed. One thing, at least, I do know and know demonstrably, and that is that " something is bound to happen." It is impossible that both the participants in the situation will retain all their present characters unchanged. It cannot be that A will continue to be red and round and of such and such a size and occupy the place p whilst B remains white and round and of such and such a size and endowed with movement of such and such a velocity in such and such a direction Stated positively, what is entailed is some effect which could be expressed in an alternative proposition concerning a change in one or more of these properties. Either A or B will change its size, shape, colour, state of motion or rest. One relevant consideration is that under the conditions as so far defined I do not know what A and B " really " are. They may be ivory balls. They may be lumps of coloured plasticine. They may even be illusory patches of colour of a kind that might be projected into the field of vision by a stereoscopic cinematograph. If this were</page><page sequence="20">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 41 in fact the case, and if the illusion has been arranged by Mr. Walt Disney, almost anything may happen. The balls may disappear in smoke or be transformed into a bunch of flowers. But even so, some things are impossible. Not even Mr. Disney can produce a situation in which precisely the same place is simultaneously occupied by two contrasted colours. So much of the effect, at any rate, is necessarily predetermined. To simplify, suppose-though it be impossible-that the description of the situation which I have given is, in point of fact, exhaustive of the nature of the entities with which we are concerned. Suppose, that is to say, that I am presented only with two convex sense data completely divorced from any connexion with any material thing. I think I can now see that what is bound to happen is something which could be expressed in a proposition with fewer alternatives than that which was entailed on the original supposition that I was partially ignorant of the nature of the entities involved. If I know clearly what I mean by " red" and " round" and what I mean by a " sense datum," I think I can see that some of the conse- quences that I had contemplated as possibilities will not be able to occur. In fact, I think I see what must happen when the white sense datum comes to the place occupied by the red sense datum. They will fuse to form a single datum intermediate in tint between white and red. This knowledge is possible because, ex hypothesi, we have elimi- nated all other properties from the situation which might have disturbed our calculations. Consider next the inference to be drawn when some of these potentially disturbing properties are admitted to be present. Let it be granted that the two convex sense data do in fact present two spherical material things. It seems to be clear that now certain new possibilities are open and others definitely excluded. The two patches of colour will not fuse to form a single patch without change of shape or size, but what will happen remains largely indeterminate. The two objects may coalesce like putty; they may split into fragments like glass; disappear like</page><page sequence="21">42 C. A. MACE. bubbles or move like billiard balls. If the precise character of the substances be determined, the range of alternative possibilities within the necessary effects will be correspond- ingly decreased. This is so because in some of these cases at least, the production of such and such effects is entailed by the defining properties of the entities involved. It is of the nature of a material thing to be " impenetrable," i.e., to occupy space in some sense that entails the impossi- bility of two material things being in the same place. It is of the nature of ivory not to behave like putty, and of putty not to behave like glass. It is, of course, open to anyone to object that in this account we have merely replaced the de facto association between cause and effect by an equally de facto association between two properties of the same thing. On the regularity view we had a merely uniform sequence of the manifestation of some property of ivory and of the property of moving in a certain way on impact. On the view here expressed ivory is defined in terms, say, of such properties as its coefficient of elasticity by which its movement on impact is entailed, but we still have merely a de facto association between its coefficient of elasticity and the other properties by which it may be identified. Moreover, if on the regularity view there can only be a problematic inference from the fact that x is an ivory ball to the conclusion that x will move in such and such a way, whilst on the view here defended this inference is demonstrative, we are, none the less, left with the purely problematic inference from the presence of certain properties in an object to the conclusion that the object in question is made of ivory. To this I can only reply that even though this be so, it is, at any rate, something to have the de.facto association located in the proper place, and if there be a problem of inductive inference it is, at any rate, something to have that problem also properly located. And surely the con- clusion here drawn is in accordance with our ordinary judgments. If we observe a brick moving in the direction of a window pane we are certain that if the brick passes through the window the glass will be broken. If we found</page><page sequence="22">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 43 the brick on the other side and the pane unbroken, we should accept the fact not as an illustration of an exception to a mere de facto generalization, but as a demonstration of the conclusion that either what we took to be a material brick was not such, or that the window was not filled with material glass, or that the path of the missile had not been that which we had supposed it to be. I conclude, then, that what we ordinarily understand by causal connexion involves in its analysis (i) association between specific characters, (ii) correlation between the variables of which these specific characters are precise determinations, (iii) spatio-temporal and qualitative con- tinuity, (iv) relations of entailment between the defining characters of the cause factors and some, at least, of the characters in terms of which the effect is defined. These elements, I believe, are necessary, and perhaps sufficient for the analysis of what I understand by " mechanical causation." It remains for me briefly to indicate the relation between causation in this more general sense and causation which assumes the teleological form. I have already suggested that a causal sequence assumes what may fairly be described as a teleological character whenever a sequence of events occurs which satisfies certain conditions, viz.: (i) that for the sequence in question there is a possible state of affairs, E, such that its intro- duction at any stage terminates the process ; (ii) that phases which promote E are repeated or continued whilst those that are adverse to E are discontinued ; (iii) that with repetition the process approximates to a form in which every phase is relevant to the production of E. In this final state the process as a whole has a character which is often (though, I think, very misleadingly) expressed by saying that the end determines the means. All that can properly be meant by this statement is that had the E been other than what it was the sequences el, e2, e3, &amp;c., 'would have been different. This, I think, no one would wish to question. It will, perhaps, sufficiently elucidate the view I wish to defend if I conclude with two observations as to the</page><page sequence="23">44 C. A. MACE. relations between mechanical and teleological causal process in the senses in which these terms have been employed. In the first place, it is obvious that on this view mecha- nical and teleological causation are not to be conceived as alternative or opposed processes. On the contrary, to assert that a process exhibits teleological causation entails that the end in question and each of the intervening phases of the process are mechanically determined. In the contemplation of vital and mental processes there are, then, two complementary types of " explanation." We can " explain " the process mechanically and we may " explain " it in teleological terms. These are not, in such a case, opposed explanations, but two distinct senses of the word " explain." Of this, perhaps a crude example may suffice. A train runs regularly from London to Edinburgh. The fact can be explained, and completely explained, in the relevant sense of " explain " by reference to the structure and mode of action of locomotives and the disposition of lines and points on the way. But precisely the same fact is " explained " by the consideration that people frequently wish to travel from one place to the other. Although it is common and, in general, legitimate to express the teleological explanation in terms of conscious desires, it is equally possible and frequently important to express the explanation in behaviouristic terms. The definition of a teleological process here adopted was expressly designed with this intention. There is, moreover, in principle no overwhelming difficulty in accounting for the fact that " mechanical " sequences admit of organization in teleological form. On this point I suspect that there is no divergence between the opinion here expressed and the doctrines of Prof. Stout. I believe that he also would hold that the mechanist is right in holding that it must be possible to give a " mecha- nical " account of vital processes and wrong only in supposing that it is not possible and desirable also to give a teleological account of these processes. This leads to my second observation. Although I wish to hold that whenever we can give a teleological explanation</page><page sequence="24">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 45 of a process we must also be able to give a mechanistic explanation, I do not see any reason to suppose that the converse is true. I admit that it is possible that every mechanical causal sequence is either some part of a larger sequence which is characterized by teleological form or is part of a sequence which in the course of its repetition tends, in the way characteristic of the kind of processes I have considered, to approximate to the final teleological form. Possibly this is part of the doctrine which Prof. Stout wishes to maintain. If so, I cannot see any way in which this belief can be refuted, but, for my own part, I see no reason to suppose that it is true.</page><page sequence="25">II.-By G. F. STOUT. I BEGIN by distinguishing three questions : (1) Is action or active tendency indispensable in causal process ? Assuming that it is so, the second question arises (2) Is there any relevant conception of active tendency, except what we derive from what we ourselves experience in being active ? Assuming that the meaning of the word " active " is ultimately derived from this sort of experience, we may pass to the third question : (3) Can action and active tendency exist without being experienced ? These three questions have a certain logical order. The first can be discussed and ought to be discussed before proceeding to the second, and the second before proceeding to the third. I shall in this paper confine myself mainly to the first two, and only in the end make a brief reference to the third. There is still, however, another question, which is logically prior to those I have enumerated, and indeed to all others concerning the nature of causal process. The most fundamental issue, which ought to determine our whole attitude to all others, is whether a cause is as such a reason, so that if we had a sufficiently comprehensive and accurate knowledge of what really takes place, we should see how and why the effect follows from the cause with logical necessity. In Hume's language, is there a necessary connexion between cause and effect? Mr. Mace has not neglected this most vital question, though he treats of it only at the end of his paper and not in its proper place, at the outset. Mr. Mace in agreement with Dr. Ewing accepts what I may call the rationalistic view. So do I, and I need not here repeat what he says in defence of it.</page><page sequence="26">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 47 I shall, however, briefly indicate my own position in my own way. I accept the rationalist view, because it seems to me the only alternative to the so-called regularity view-that which reduces causal inference to a mere psychological habit or instinct. There can be no ground for denying the regularity view which is not a ground for accepting the rationalistic position. When we say that B is caused by A, why should we mean anything more than that B follows A ? Because on this assumption there is no reason why B should follow A; there is only a bare temporal sequence. But if there is no reason why B should follow A, then in a new instance in which an A occurs, there is still no reason why it should be either certainly or probably followed by B. Hence there can be no valid inference forestalling actual experience that B will follow or is in any degree likely to follow. Nor are we logically in a better position if we suppose that B's have been found to follow A's frequently and uniformly, unless we take for granted, as we naturally do, that there is a sufficient reason for the uniform repetition in past instances. In the absence of such a reason, the belief that on a new occasion B will again follow A is absolutely a leap in the dark and not an inference at all. It is entirely groundless. Even if Berkeley, Hume, and Mill were right in holding that the order of the physical world shows no trace of necessary connexion-if this order consisted only in th6 mere succession and co-existence of loose and separate items, which might have been arranged in any other order or in no order at all-I could still not accept this stupendous miracle as ultimate fact requiring no further explanation. I should rather be driven to assume with Berkeley and the Occasionalists before him and Leibniz after him, that there must be a cause of the system as a whole, a cause which must be of such a nature as to account for the nature of its effect. But I agree with Mr. Mace that we can and do have insight into necessary connexion within the field of natural process without needing to refer, to a super- natural agent. Such insight is in general, and perhaps</page><page sequence="27">48 G. F. STOUT. always, only partial and imperfect, but it is no more partial and imperfect than from the nature of the case it ought to be, in view of our inevitable ignorance of what actually takes place in causal process. Further, it increases in range and precision with the advance of science, and increases in such a way that the question arises, what form would it take if our knowledge of causal process were completely adequate ? In other words, what is the limit to which our knowledge gradually approximates, without perhaps ever ultimately attaining it ? The gradual approxi- mation is best illustrated by the distinction between empirical laws and more ultimate laws from which, as applied under varying special conditions, a variety of empirical laws can be deduced. It is admitted even by Hume that so far as we can thus deduce more special from more general laws, we have rational insight. But it is urged that in the long run we have no other evidence for the more general laws themselves than the particular data of observation and experience. This is true, but it seems to me to be irrelevant to the point really at issue. We are not asking what kind of evidence is required to prove a causal law, but what kind of law it must be to justify us in regarding it as ultimate-ultimate by its own nature and not merely in relation to our ignorance. In other words, how must a causal law be constituted in order that by its intrinsic nature it should neither require to be deduced from more ultimate laws nor be capable of being so deduced ? To this question there seems to me to be a simple and straightforward answer. Every causal law asserts that under certain conditions, certain consequences follow. To show that the supposed conditions really exist, empirical evidence is always indispensable ; but the empirical evidence need not be required in order to show that the consequences follow. This may be evident from the nature of the case, either directly or through a train of demonstrative reasoning. When it is evident in this way, so that the appeal to empirical evidence is required only to establish the real existence of the conditions, then the law is ultimate ; it neither can be nor need be deduced from more universal</page><page sequence="28">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 49 laws. It may be that this conception of an ultimate law is an ideal that can never be fully attained by us; but we may and do approximate to it. Compare, for instance, the Newtonian law of gravitation with that of Einstein. The condition for Newton is, roughly speaking, the existence of bodies in space having mass, and the consequence is that they attract each other in the way he asserts. Both the existence of the supposed condition and the proposition that the consequences follow from this condition rest on empirical evidence. The Newtonian law is therefore not ultimate. It is in Kantian language synthetic a posteriori. But Einstein, if he does not reach the ideal of ultimacy, at least comes much nearer to it. He starts by assuming a certain constitution of space-time, from which a law practi- cally equivalent to the Newtonian can be deduced without reference to empirical evidence. Empirical evidence is still indispensable, but it is only needed in order to show that the assumed conditions really exist, not to show that the consequences follow. I remember reading in a little book by Bertrand Russell that from Einstein's point of view the most fundamental principles of physics become identical propositions. Whether this is true or not I do not decide, but if it is true it means that they are what I call ultimate laws. I may here add another point, which it seems to me strongly supports the rationalistic position. So far as special laws are deducible from more general laws, this makes a highly significant difference in the conditions which give weight to the empirical evidence. Frequency of repetition counts for less, and detailed precision in the agreement between deductively anticipated facts and facts as ascertained by observation and experience counts for more. Compare, for instance, the empirical law that water rises to a certain height in the common pump, and the more universal law that all fluids rise in the Torricellian tube until their weight balances with the pressure due to the weight of the air. Here the single fact that mercury in a single instance is found to rise precisely to the height required by the law, gives it an evidential value which is D</page><page sequence="29">50 G. F. STOUT. independent of repetition. This means in general that empirical facts support the general principle more cogently in proportion as the general principle gives a rational explanation of them. This ought to be so on the rationalist view of causation. On the custom view, it is an unaccountable accident. I have taken my illustrations from the field of science, but I agree with Dr. Ewing that ultimate laws are to be found in our mental life. I may here give an instance which shows clearly that there can be necessary connexion between matters of fact. A man in following a train of reasoning, when he sees that certain premises entail a certain conclusion, must, if he accepts the premises, accept the conclusion also. Now in this case there are two sorts of necessary connexion : the first is that by which the premises entail the conclusion. This is not a connexion between occurrences in the man's mind. On the other hand, there is also a necessary connexion between the man's belief in the premises and his belief in the conclusion. This is a connexion between occurrences in the man's mind. It is undeniably a necessary connexion between matters of fact. Before leaving this topic, I must add a word about the hardened prejudice with which the rationalist view has to contend at the present day. This prejudice is comparatively modern. The rationalist position was taken for granted as a matter of course by Descartes, Leibniz and Spinoza, and in general by earlier thinkers. The fashion of rejecting it without further examination arises from an uncritical acceptance of the arguments of Hume, who did subject it to a searching scrutiny. But Hume's argument is through- out founded on the uncritical acceptance of certain dogmatic assumptions concerning what he takes to be the primary data from which all our knowledge must be derived, and I presume that his followers accept these assumptions- at any rate, they ought to do so. There is, however, a very important difference between Hume and those who claim to be his disciples. Hume holds, and I think proves, that his initial assumptions are quite incompatible with</page><page sequence="30">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 51 any logically tenable account of causality as a principle of inference in matters of fact. For this, necessary connexion appeared to him indispensable. His difficulty was that he could find no idea of necessary connexion, at any rate no really relevant idea of necessary connexion between matters of fact, and this difficulty he never overcame or supposed that he had overcome. What he calls a sceptical solution of his doubts is really a solution which leaves the doubts quite untouched. His successors, on the contrary, such as J. S. Mill, have attempted to derive from Hume's premises a logical theory of induction-an attempt foredoomed to failure. They seek a logical basis of induction, whereas Hume denies that there is or can be any such logical basis. I now turn to my first question: Is active tendency indispensable to causal process ? I' approach this question from the rationalistic point of view. For those who are content with the regularity view, what I have to say will lack point; but my argument ought to appeal to those who, like Mr. Mace and Dr. Ewing, hold, as I do, that a cause is not a cause except in so far as it is a reason. What I have to urge is that active tendency-what Hume loosely calls " power " or " force "-is essential to causal process, if causality is to be regarded as a principle of rational inference in matter of fact. Consider the case of the stretched bow. We say that there is a tendency for the bow to unbend. According to Mr. Mace, the word " tendency" stands for nothing actual. It merely repre-' sents the hypothetical proposition, if the archer removes his fingers, the bow will as a matter offact unbend. This account of the matter is the only account which the regularity view permits, but. it will not bear examination from the rationalistic standpoint. If we strictly exclude and do not surreptitiously intr6duce the conception of active tendency, the initial situation before the archer removes his hand is simply that the parts of the bow are in a certain position relative to each other and the surrounding things. But there is no reason in the nature of this initial situation why, when the archer removes his hand, it should change at all, or, if it does so, why it should change in one way rather D2</page><page sequence="31">52 G. F. STOUT. than in any one of an infinity of alternative ways which are also geometrically possible. It is not merely that we are ignorant of the reason; there is no reason which we can either know or be ignorant of. On my view, on the contrary, there is a reason, which we may hope to know with more or less adequacy. The initial situation is such that the bow is actually tending to unbend, so that when the pressure of the archer's hand is removed this tendency is released and, so far as other conditions permit, fulfils itself. The tendency actually exists before it is fulfilled, and would exist even if it were never fulfilled at all. It is actual in the same sense in which the process of unbending is actual when it takes place. If we reject this conception of active and actual tendency, causal inference is not logically inference at all. We have to give up logic for a very dubious psychology. All that we are justified in asserting is that in past instances we have found customary conjunction to be followed by expectation. At least this is all we can say, if we refuse to face the further problem, the problem with which Hume dealt in enquiring into the origin of our idea of necessary connexion. In this part of his work, he not only recognizes, as I have done, that active tendency, which in his own language he calls " power " or " force," is indispensable to the rational character of causal process, but even identifies it with necessary connexion. His difficulty is that he can find no idea of power which will fulfil the required function-which will, if I may so express myself, deliver the goods. Granting that some idea corresponds to such terms, he has to determine what it is. In accordance with his primary assumptions, this can be done only in one way : there must be an original impression of which the idea is a fainter copy. Holding, as I believe rightly, that this cannot be an impression of sensation, he concludes that it must be an impression of reflection. But the only impression of reflection which seems to him to account for its origin, is a very far-fetched one, and seems to me to be an invention of Hume's own. After repeated experience of the sequence A-B, we are not only led to expect B when A occurs,</page><page sequence="32">but there is also a peculiar impression accompanying the expectation: we feel inclined to pass to a belief in B, we feel carried from the belief in A to the belief in B. This peculiar " sentiment," of which I can find no trace in my own introspection, is according to Hume the only source of our idea of power, and therefore of necessary connexion. But clearly, if this is the source of our idea of power, we have no right whatever to give it any objective significance. Objective events do not feel inclined or impelled to follow each other because we feel inclined or impelled to believe that one follows another. Hence the only idea which on Hume's view corresponds to what he calls " active power " and I call " active tendency" is quite incapable of filling the logical gap in causal inference. I insist on this point, because apart from it I claim that Hume is on my side. What for him barred the way to a rationalist view of causatson, was just his failure to find a really relevant conception of active tendency. Otherwise he was a thorough- going rationalist. His scepticism is scepticism from a rationalist point of view. It was from this point of view that he made havoc of the empirical philosophy. I hold then that active tendency is required to fill a logical gap which would otherwise destroy the validity of causal inference. If we have a notion of active tendency that can fill this gap, we are justified in using it. But have we ? If so, what is its nature and whence do We derive it? I answer that its source and the key to its nature is to be found and can only be found in the experience we have when and so far as we feel ourselves active. We all distinguish between our doing and what happens to us. Now, Hume also sought and failed to find the source of the idea of " power," which he desiderates, in the control of the will over bodily movements and the course of mental process. I have dealt with his arguments elsewhere.* Here it will be sufiicient to say that the doctrine which he opposes was formulated by him in a crude and untenable form, determined partly by his own dogmatic 53 * Mind and Matter, Book I, Chap. ii, § 4.  MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION.</page><page sequence="33">54 G. F. STOUT. assumptions, partly by the superficial way it had been formulated by some previous philosophers. My next step, therefore, must be an analysis of what we experience in being active in contrast with being passive. I hold that in ordinary waking life we are never entirely passive; but to illustrate what I mean by being active, we may select such relatively definite examples as my endeavour, successful or unsuccessful, to recall a name, to form a plan, to come to a practical decision, to solve a problem, to compose a sonnet, to catch a butterfly, to thread a needle, to swim against the tide, to win a race. This is a very miscellaneous list. But all the items in it have a common character which is both necessary and sufficient to make them instances of what I do in contrast with what I undergo. In all of them something is being sought after or striven towards, whether it is attained or not. There is an urge towards something. I am in a certain situation and I want the situation changed so as to satisfy the want. Let us give the name conation to this distinctive character of active process. A process taking place in me is my action so far and only so far as it is conative ; but the conative character of the process, considered by itself, is a mere abstraction. The concrete action involves the operation and co-operation of a multiplicity of non-conative factors-sensations, perceptions, conceptions, images, judg- ments, questions, and suppositions. Within the total process such factors come into play successively and simul- taneously in very various and variable ways and degrees. In the attempt to thread a needle, the sight of my hand and the needle in their varying relations to each other, and the thought of the thread passing through the needle's eye, are essential factors in the whole action. Apart from the working of such factors there is no action at all. They Aeem to constitute not merely part of the action but the whole of it. Yet they lack the essential character which is distinctively characteristic of what is experienced in being active: they are non-conative. The sight of the needle and thread does not endeavour to thread the needle and is not identical with the endeavour to thread the</page><page sequence="34">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION, 55 needle ; and this holds equally of any combination of such factors. How then can their operation constitute, as it seems to constitute, not merely part but the whole of the process ? I can find only one possible answer to this question: it is only under one limiting condition that the working of the multiple factors taken severally forms part of my action, and taken collectively forms the whole of it. This is true so far and only so far as they enter into a process which on the whole has a certain conative character-e.g., the seeking to recall a name or to thread a needle. It is this pervasive character of the process which connects its several phases and stages into the unity of one action. So far as the manifold factors would not operate at all or would operate differently apart from the conative process, or in a different conative process, their working does not form part of what I experience as my doing. To borrow a term from physics, we may say that the working of the manifold factors constitutes my action strictly so called, only so far as they enter into a conative .field, comparable to a gravitational field or an electro-magnetic field. We can express this by distinguishing between two sorts of tendencies. There is on the one hand the conative tendency pervading the whole process and unifying its variable stages and phases; this we may call a primary tendency. On the other hand there are the manifold tendencies thwarting or counter-acting each other, as these come into play successively and simultaneously in the course of the action. Seeing that these enter into my action only so far as they belong to the conative field, they may be called secondary or derivative tendencies. Both derivative and primary tendencies are indispensable to what we experience in being active. Either, if we attempt to separate it from the other, is an impossible abstraction. The word " ten- dency " then becomes meaningless, and the scientific thinker rightly refuses to have anything to do with it. Yet there are motives in themselves praiseworthy which have led many psychologists to consider only what I have called derivative tendencies, and to ignore the conative field which they presuppose. Psychology aims at detailed</page><page sequence="35">56 G. F. STOUT. analysis and explanation, but it is only in the multiplicity of derivative tendencies that detail is to be found. There is therefore a strong temptation to consider these only, and to regard conation, so far as it is recognized at all, as only one of these among others. Psychologists who yield to this temptation are also influenced by what they suppose to be the analogous procedure of physical science. This is illustrated, for instance, by Hume's assimilation of the law of association to the Newtonian law of gravitation. Just as Newton's attraction did not presuppose a gravita- tional field, Hume's association did not presuppose a conative field. In the third place, these psychologists are rightly repelled by the untenable form in which doctrines of subjective activity have frequently been stated. Such motives account for Associationism and other theories which have of late been so vigorously attacked by the Gestalt psychologists. In order to complete my account of what I experience in being active, I have to add a condition which for me is of vital importance, though I can here only touch on it in passing. My action, as I experience it, is never merely mental to the exclusion of my body; I am always aware of my body as essentially involved, through motor-sensations of tension and release, through organic sensations of freshness and fatigue, and through those organic sensations which enter into the constitution of the various emotional states and, in general, of pleasure and pain. In these and also in other ways, what I experience in being active is always experienced as a process in my embodied self. This holds good for the forming of a plan or the reaching of a decision, as well as for the execution of the plan or decision. It is thus true, for instance, of the process by which I work out in my head what I say in this paper, as well as for the writing of it with my pen. There is in this respect no breach of continuity when I pass from the first stage to the second. Indeed, it is in the first stage that I have found the bodily experience most obtrusive. On the other hand, no bodily sensations, taken apart from conation, can suffice of themselves to constitute what</page><page sequence="36">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 57 I experience in being active. At this point I come into conflict with Mr. Mace. He suggests that motor sensations of strain and pressure may of themselves yield an experience of active endeavour. In reply I would point out that this view is incompatible with plain facts. When a nurse shifts the position of my body and limbs in bed, while I refrain from interfering, I experience sensations of pressure and tension essentially similar to those that I should experience if I moved my body myself. Yet I do not feel as if I were doing so; on the contrary, I feel very passive indeed. Although the sensations of strain and pressure are felt by me, I do not feel myself straining or pressing. The only relevant action of which I am aware is that of refraining from interference with what the nurse does. My motor sensations only serve to inform me that the limb which is being shifted belongs to me and not to somebody else. Berkeley and Hume seem to be clearly right in holding that mere sensations, abstractly considered, cannot yield any conception of active tendency, not even of those tendencies which I have called derivative. Why, then, do we speak at all of sensations of strain and pressure ? The reason is not to be found in the intrinsic quality of the sensa themselves, for these, as Berkeley said, are " visibly inert." The sensations are characterized as sensations of strain and pressure only because of the special part they play in conative processes in which we as embodied selves strain and press. Even if we suppose the intrinsic quality of the sensations to be very different, they would still be for us sensations of strain and pressure if they entered in the same way into the constitution of the conative field. After this analysis of what I experience in being active, I pass to the question-How far am I justified in ascribing to other things active tendencies analogous to my own ? So far as this paper is concerned, my pivotal reason is that, apart from active tendency, causal inference loses all claim to cogency. Whatever else I have to say is supplementary. First of all I have to point out the essential importance of the distinction between primary and secondary tendencies.</page><page sequence="37">58 G. F. STOUT. In observing the external behaviour of bodies other than my own, the detail which presents itself is an expression of secondary tendencies, from which I have to gather the primary. Now where I am dealing with other men and the higher animals, this is comparatively easy. I can satisfactorily interpret their behaviour by regarding them as embodied selves, just as I am an embodied self. Anthro- pology shows that the primitive mind is easily led to interpret the behaviour of even plants and inanimate objects in the same way-e.g., trees, streams, stones, volcanoes-but we cannot do so. When I say that there is a tendency of the bent bow to unbend, I do not mean that the bow is an embodied self which strives to unbend. I no more ascribe a primary tendency to the bow itself, than I ascribe a primary tendency to the archer's hand when he restrains the bow from unbending. The archer, not the hand, is for me the embodied self. Similarly, the tendency of the bow to unbend is derivative and presupposes a primary tendency belonging to a wider field of' which the bow is part. But how are we to delimit and define this wider field ? Here I confess that I am very much in the dark. Fechner may possibly be right when he argues that the earth is an embodied self. If it were so, we could not reasonably expect more evidence of it than Fechner himself supplies. We should be very much in the position of a blood corpuscle, if this were an embodied self, in relation to the whole organism within which it has its being. I admit, however, that such speculations are fanciful. Setting aside vital processes, which I shall deal with later on, I fall back on the position that if primary tendency is not to be found elsewhere, it must belong to physical nature as a whole. I have to add that the more remote the primary tendency is, the less insight we have into its nature, so far at least as we have only detailed experiment and observation to rely on. But the less insight we have into its nature, the less guidance it affords to us in the scientific task of predicting and controlling the course of events, such as is afforded in foreseeing the conduct of our fellow-men by insight into their character and motives.</page><page sequence="38">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 59 Hence from the scientific point of view we may be justified in ignoring primary tendency, except in men and animals, and perhaps also in what Mr. Mace calls teleological processes. But if science for its own purposes is justified in ignoring primary tendency where it cannot definitely trace it, it by no means follows that it is also justified in denying its existence. The logical position is here very similar to that concerning the status of the so-called secondary qualities. It will be seen that I do not rest my case merely on inference by analogy. Besides the pivotal logical argument on which I have already insisted, I attach importance also to the argument from continuity or solidarity. My action, strictly so called, consists always only in an endeavour or striving. The result, whether successful or unsuccessful, never depends wholly on me. My action is, and is experienced as being, only a partial stage in a wider process which expands continuously into the world process. The world process in general, then, must be so far akin to what I myself experience in being active as to make this continuity possible. Mr. Mace approaches the problem in a quite different way. For him the only justification we can have for reading into nature any analogue of our own action as embodied selves consists merely in inference by analogy, founded on likeness between our behaviour and the observed behaviour of other things. He finds an analogy sufficiently close to justify the inference only in a certain type of process found in living organisms and nowhere else. This he calls " teleo- logical process." Wherever teleological process is found he thinks it at least highly probable that a mind is operative, belonging to the organism which displays it. This leads him to give mind a much wider range in nature than is ordinarily recognized, and so far he agrees with me. But he holds that there is no good reason for extending the inference by analogy beyond the phenomena of life. " The limits of life are the limits of teleological form." I have to enquire whether Mr. Mace, going so far as he does with me, can reasonably refuse to go much further.</page><page sequence="39">60 G. F. STOUT. Let us first examine his account of teleological process. With his positive account of such process I agree, as far as it goes. But he seems to me to be wrong in refusing to consider the nature of the product as a clue to the nature of the process. He does this on the ground that " given any state of affairs or any system it is possible to conceive some purpose with which the existence of that system or state of affairs would accord " (p. 32). Here he seems to me to miss the point. He does so because he makes no distinction between immanent and transcendent teleology. Teleological process is immanent inasmuch as it has results which issue from it, so far as it is successful, within the embodied self and not beyond it. To use Aristotle's favourite illustration, the plan formed by the architect in his own mind is an immanent result of his mental activity ; the house produced in accordance with the plan is a transcendent result. In the case of the cat attempting to escape from the cage, the immanent result is a development in the perception of a certain kind of situation, and in correlated modes of behaviour. The development is in the direction of a certain systematic order which did not exist before. Features of the situation which were previously loose and disconnected are selected and co-ordinated with each other. In this case we cannot, perhaps, point to any permanent modification of the environment as the external expression of immanent teleology. But consider what happens when a bird builds a nest. Here there is at the outset no definitely preconceived plan of the nest. But there is a vague anticipation which gradually becomes more and more definite as the work advances. Now, the immanent teleological order has its source in the intrinsic nature of mental activity, so far as this is successful. We are here in presence of an ultimate law which neither can be nor need be traced to any more universal principle. Mental activity, so far as it is successful, produces a teleological system within the embodied self. The external order corre- sponding to this internal order is only the continuation and completion of the internal order. Further, there is no other universal principle which yields a rational explanation</page><page sequence="40">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 61 of this kind of order. There is no other ultimate law from which it can be seen to follow. It is true that the same sort of order may, within rather narrow limits, be found independently of mental activity. We then say that it is a coincidence. Its general nature is not accounted for by the general nature of the process which gives rise to it. Thus in the process of shuffling cards, the cards may come to be arranged in the exact order of their suits, and it is possible that this may happen three times running. But this is only one of innumerable alternatives which the general process of shuffling admits of. If it happened, we should feel certain that some skilful person had manipulated the cards. We may then accept this sort of order in the external world as a most important clue, though not always an infallible clue, to the operative presence of mind, or at least of an unconscious analogue of mind. Mr. Mace refuses to use this clue. None the less, even from his own point of view, he finds in teleological process, as occurring in living organisms, evidence for the probable existence of mind over a far wider range than is ordinarily recognized. This raises the question how far he is prepared to admit that teleological process extends. Does it include plant life as well as animal life ? Does it include vital adaptation in general, of the kind which vitalists and neo-vitalists insist on ? Does it, for instance, include the processes through which the organism combats disease and injury-processes which are sometimes spoken of in very anthropomorphic terms by biologists? I take it that Mr. Mace intends to include all this. But such action evidently cannot be ascribed to what we ordinarily recognize as the embodied selves of men and animals, to say nothing of plants. Does Mr. Mace, then, mean to introduce the conception of a subliminal self which is concerned with vital adaptation in general, in distinction from what we recognize as the voluntary behaviour of men and animals ? On questions of this sort Mr. Mace is very vague. But in general I gather that in some way or other mind is involved in what is most peculiarly distinctive of vital process, in</page><page sequence="41">62 G. F. STOUT. contrast with the processes that take place in inanimate bodies. On this basis we have next to consider whether he is justified in drawing so hard and fast a line between the animate and the inanimate. To me it seems that this bifurcation of nature is untenable. In the first place, we have to note that the superficial contrast between life and dead matter can no longer be maintained in the face of modern science. What to a superficial view appears as stagnation is in reality incessant agitation, and the process shows everywhere definite patterns comparable to what we call organization in living beings. This is shown, for instance, in the constitution of atoms and molecules, and in their chemical relations, more especially in the chemistry of the carbon compounds. In the second place, vital process is itself inseparable from the world process. It is through and through a transaction between the living organism and its environment, and involves no occurrences which are not mechanical, physical or chemical. In fact, vital process is a partial phase in the wider process which embraces what we call inanimate nature. In the third place, we have to consider the origin of life. Either it has no origin and is everlasting, or it originates from inanimate matter. On the first assumption we must hold that the world process is essentially so constituted as to maintain vital process in face of the dangers and difficulties which living things have constantly to encounter. I can see no rational way of explaining this except by supposing a primary tendency in nature to maintain vital processes. On the other hand, if living organisms issue from a state of affairs in which there is no life, then on the rationalist view of causation there must be a fundamental likeness of nature and continuity of existence between them. This must be so if we set aside special creation or emergent evolution, which is only special creation in the disguise of a pseudo- scientific formula. I admit that it does not follow from such considerations that there are or can be embodied selves of the same special type as those of men and animals, connected with non-</page><page sequence="42">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 63 living matter in the same way as these are with living organisms-embodied selves with which we can enter into social or quasi-social relations, or whose motives we can understand, as we can those of our fellow-men, or even those of animals. But this is not the point at issue. What we start from is the general distinction between primary and secondary tendencies; but within this general schema there is room for immense differences in the special form which it takes. If, for instance, the primary tendency belongs to the whole of nature, it must express itself in ways immensely different from those which characterize the embodied self of a man or a mouse. Further, if the primary tendency involves the operative presence of mind, the mind which it involves must be immensely different, in its nature and in its conditions, from ours. It will be said that all that I have shown is that the existence of primary tendencies apart from living organisms is possible, or at the utmost that it is so far probable as to make it an interesting question whether they exist or not. But what positive reasons have I for believing in their existence ? How am I to answer Mr. Mace when he says that he " cannot see any way in which this belief can be refuted," but can " see no reason to suppose that it is true " (p. 45) ? I have already urged that without the conception of active tendency causality supplies no logical basis for inference in matter of fact. I have also urged that secondary tendencies presuppose primary tendencies, and that primary tendencies involve either mind in the proper sense or some unconscious analogue of mind, such as von Hartmann assumes in his Philosophy of the Unconscious. But I do not depend merely on this argument. There is another, equally important, which I have developed at some length in my Mind and Matter* and can only briefly mention. This also presupposes the rationalist view of causation. The principle on which it proceeds is that no transition from one state of affairs as cause to another state of affairs as consequence is intelligible unless there is what * Mind and Matter, Book II, Chap. vi.</page><page sequence="43">64 G. F. STOUT. Mr. Mace calls qualitative continuity between what precedes and what follows; and this means, as Mr. Mace explains, that what is new in the subsequent state as compared with the prior state consists in a new determina- tion of a determinable common to both. From this it follows that mind in the strict sense, as involving experience or consciousness, cannot be accounted for as a result of causal conditions which do not already include it; for experiencing is an ultimate determinable, and cannot be conceived as a determinant of any other determinable. In order that mind should come into being in the course of natural process, mind must already exist and be opera- tive. But the action of mind involves the distinction and relation of primary and secondary tendencies. Hence this distinction and relation of primary and secondary tendencies does not first arise in connexion with living organisms, but is fundamental and original in the constitution of nature as a whole. This argument, if it proves anything, proves the existence of experiencing or conscious mind and not merely of an unconscious analogue of mind. But it is worth considering whether this conception of an unconscious analogue of mind and of mental action is tenable at all. To me it seems that it is not. I should say that an unexperienced conation is as absurd as an unexperienced pleasure or pain ; and in my opinion (though this is not so clear) the,same holds for sensa. It is very generally admitted that many sensa-e.g., the drunkard's pink rats-exist only in being experienced, and that therefore their existence is consti- tuted by being experienced. Now, I have the greatest difficulty in understanding how something, in all other respects identical in nature with an experienced sensum, should have its existence constituted in a totally different way-that in the one case its existence should consist in being experienced and in the other it should be quite independent of being experienced. I sympathize with Berkeley (though I think his language is unfortunate) when he asserts that an idea (= experienced sensum) can only resemble an idea. But there is an even greater difficulty,</page><page sequence="44">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 65 which seems to be quite insuperable, in supposing some- thing which is in all other respects identical with a conation to differ from it only in not being experienced. The purpose of this paper will have been fulfilled if I have succeeded in showing that the general view advocated in it, which is essentially akin to that taken by the greatest philosophical thinkers of past generations,* is not now dead and done with, but is still a live alternative, to be seriously kept in mind by philosophers. * Of all the philosophers of the past I find myself in most sympathy with Spinoza and Leibniz.</page><page sequence="45">III.-By DR. A. C. EWING. THE two previous symposiasts and myself agree in holding the, no doubt very disputable, view that the cause logically entails the effect in such a way that it would be in principle possible, with sufficient insight, to see what kind of effect must follow from examination of the cause alone without having learnt by previous experience what were the effects of similar causes. We should also, no doubt, agree in holding the converse proposition that the effect entails the cause in this sense of " entail." This does not mean that "A causes B " or " A is the effect of B " means the same as "A logically entails B," but only that entailment is one of the relations into which the complex relation of causation can be analysed. Further, in view of the interesting and able paper read by Mr. Porteous before the Aristotelian Society,* I must add that, when I say " entail," I do not mean to cover only " formal entailment," or what he calls " logical entailment." If we distinguish, as he does, " logical" entailment as depending wholly on the form of propositions from " onto- logical necessary connexion," which depends partly on content, I agree that it would not be justifiable to regard the cause as logically entailing the effect or vice versa. I do not maintain that a proposition asserting a causal law could be evident to any mind whatever, human or super- human, merely from the form of propositions about the kind of events connected by the law, as the connexion between " All men are mortal, and Socrates is a man " and " Socrates is mortal " is evident. If we distinguish form and content in this way, I must insist that necessary causal connexions are connexions of content. We have many examples of necessary connexions of content which we can discover a priori, e.g., that shape entails size or that being a Euclidean triangle entails having angles the sum of which is equal to * Proc. Arist. Soc., 1934-5, p. 149 ff.</page><page sequence="46">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION 67 two right angles; and there is no reason whatever to suppose that we can discover a priori all the necessary connexions of content that might be discovered a priori by beings with greater powers of insight or more varied experience than ours. Mr. Porteous's paper, however, suggests to my mind two reasons why people may be inclined to reject our " entailment " view of causation through misunderstanding. In the first place, they may see clearly that there can be no relation of entailment based on logical form between cause and effect, and then conclude that there is no relation of entailment between them at all, while there still might be such a relation in respect of content. And, secondly, they may, like Mr. Porteous, think of entailment as a relation that holds only between propositions, not between facts, events, characteristics, realities. But surely they must admit, at any rate, that, if the proposition " S is P " does entail the proposition " S is Q" so that the second follows a priori from the first, and if P and Q characterize real things, there must be a relation between P and Q as characteristics of things such that P is logically impossible without Q. Otherwise the inference of "S is Q" from " S is P" would be invalid altogether. So the objection reduces to saying that I ought not to have used the word entailment for the second relation, that between characteristics, as well as for the first, that between propositions. This is a question of terminology, in which I should willingly defer to my critics if only I could think of a better word. A bigger question of principle is raised by those who would attack my view on the ground that there can be no deduc- tive inference to new facts not included in the premisses, but I shall not enter into the point as all four symposiasts would, I think, agree in rejecting this view on its own merits (or demerits), apart from the question of causation. Further, I had better, perhaps, remark by the way that I do not wish to decide or discuss the question whether we are to regard causality as a relation between facts, or events, or characteristics, or things (substances). I suspect, perhaps wrongly, that this is largely a verbal matter. Certainly, if we regard causality as, say, a relation between E2</page><page sequence="47">68 A. C. EWING. facts, there will in all cases of causation be a corresponding relation between the characteristics which are constituents of these facts, this relation being definable in terms of the causal relation between the facts, and, again, a like relation between the events about which these are facts and between the things (if any) to which the events happen; and the same will occur, mutatis mutandis, if we regard it as primarily a relation between events or things or characteristics. In that case I am not sure whether it matters much which of these four closely connected and interdependent relations we call causality. The principal circumstance which has set people against the " entailment" view, or what Prof. Stout calls the rationalistic view, of causation is the fact that they seemed unable to discover any single case in which they could see that the cause entailed the effect or any single causal law that was either self-evident or logically demonstrable. My reply to this is that the fact that we cannot see a connexion does not prove it to be absent; that, since we never know the whole cause, it is not in the least surprising that we cannot see it to entail the effect; and that, although we never know a causal law a priori in the strictest sense, there are degrees of a priori intelligibility, and we can sometimes see apart from experience that one sequence of events would be more intelligible than another, at least in the psychological sphere. The last point, I think, may be made most clearly by pointing out that anybody who denies this would have to assert, e.g., that, apart from empirical evidence, it would be just as reasonable to suppose that if a person whom A loved were to die in agony in the prime of his life A would be likely to be intensely delighted as that he would be likely to be grieved, and that we had no right to think belief in the propositions " All men are mortal " and " Socrates is a man " any more likely to cause belief in the proposition " Socrates is mortal " than to cause belief that there will be another Ice Age or that the moon is made of green cheese. So far, I think, the two first symposiasts and myself would be in agreement. Where we differ is only that they are slightly more ready than I</page><page sequence="48">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION 69 am to claim the possession of a priori insight into causal connexions, and, in the case of Prof. Stout, to draw metaphysical conclusions from this. Prof. Stout, assuming that the cause does entail the effect in the sense indicated, contends that this would be impossible if there were not in the cause taken as a whole the property of " active tendency" in a sense in which this statement cannot be reduced to merely hypothetical propositions about what would happen under certain circumstances. He further holds that this notion of active tendency is only intelligible if we suppose the presence of conation, and deduces from this conclusions of great importance for metaphysics. Regarding these he very modestly says in the concluding paragraph that " the purpose of this paper will have been fulfilled if I have succeeded in showing that the general view advocated in it is not now dead and done with, but is still a live alter- native, to be seriously kept in mind by philosophers." If this is all he claims, he has indisputably achieved his purpose. All I can say is that, while his view or something like it may very well be true, he has not yet succeeded in convincing me that I may assert it with confidence to be so. Now I admit it to be at least a very plausible doctrine that we can only see an a priori connexion between cause and effect in cases where there is present conation (in Prof. Stout's sense), but he goes further than this. He holds, and to establish his view by this argument he must hold, not only that this conation is present, but that it is necessary to constitute the connexion, that it is only in virtue of it that the connexions we see hold at all. His instance of a priori connexion between belief in premisses and belief in a conclusion (p. 50) would seem to contra- dict this, for belief in the premisses is not itself a conation and does not exercize a conation; but I suppose he would meet the objection by means of his distinction between primary and secondary tendencies and argue that there is some conation present in all cases of inferring, and so in all cases where belief in a conclusion is entailed by belief in premisses. But I still do not feel easy about this.</page><page sequence="49">70 A. C. EWING. Granted that conation is present and that I should not have thought of the premisses or of their connexion with the conclusion if I had not had some end in view, however vaguely (including under this the end of finding out the truth for its own sake), Prof. Stout's view would not follow unless it were only because of this conation that the belief in the premisses entailed the belief in the conclusion, and it does not seem to me obvious that this is true. If it were the conation, and not the special character of the beliefs quite independently of this, that was responsible for the necessary connexion, it might even be objected that it was a case of " wish-fulfilment " in the technical, depre- ciatory sense, and not of genuine inference. So it would seem that we have here a case of a priori causal connexion in which the connexion does not depend on conation. If, as is often supposed (though it does not seem to be indubitable), conation is present in all psychological states, and if we can only see a priori causal connexion between psychological as opposed to merely physical states, it follows that we can only see this causal connexion in cases where conation is present; but it does not follow that conation is, so to speak, the connecting link which alone makes it possible, or that we can only see it because conation is present. The conation might be sometimes a mere accom- paniment of the causal connexion which we see, not an essential factor, and in that case the argument that we can only see causal connection where conation is present would not begin to prove that causation would not occur anywhere without conation. But I must grant that in all the cases of alleged insight into causality in the psychological sphere, with this one solitary exception of the connexion between belief in premisses and belief in a conclusion, conation is not only an accompaniment, but an essential factor in the causal connexion, and this suggests that it might be possible to produce a further analysis of this one anomaly that would square it with the other cases. But how this could be done I have not the faintest idea. I am not, therefore, quite prepared to say that it is the presence of conation which makes causal connexion possible,</page><page sequence="50">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION 71 even in all the cases where we ourselves seem to be able to see the connexion. But, even if I granted this, we should still have to bridge the gulf between saying that we can only see causal connexion in such cases and saying that it can only hold in such cases. The fact, if it is a fact, that we can only see causal connexion to hold if conation is present does not prove that it can in fact only hold if conation is present, though it certainly increases whatever probability attaches to the latter assertion. But I am not prepared dogmatically to limit the kinds of logically connected characteristics in reality to those which we can see to be logically connected; that would be claiming omniscience. But no doubt Prof. Stout means to say not only that we cannot see causal connexion in any other cases, but that we can see that it cannot hold in any others, that we can see positively that causation entails conation. But I am afraid I do not see this at present, though I have a feeling that the reason may be simply because I have not the required philosophical insight, and I should be very grateful for any further course of argument which might help me to see it to be true. It is certainly something that a great many philosophers have thought they saw, although the doctrine has not, as far as I know, been stated by anybody else with the admirable subtlety with which Prof. Stout has stated it. I agree that conation must be conscious if by this is meant not " introspected " but " felt " or " experienced," though I should at once dissociate myself from his corresponding view about sensa (p. 64), so the issue is whether causation does really presuppose conation. If it does, what we call the physical world must certainly either be itself conscious or depend on some conscious mind for its existence. It remains to consider an auxiliary argument brought by Prof. Stout for this view of causation. Taking the case of a stretched bow, he argues that " if we strictly exclude and do not surreptitiously introduce the conception of active tendency, the initial situation before the archer removes his hand is simply that the parts of the bow are in a certain position relative to each other and the</page><page sequence="51">72 A. C. EWING. surrounding things. But there is no reason in the nature of this initial situation why, when the archer removes his hand, it should change at all, or, if it does so, why it should change in one way rather than in any one of an infinity of alternative ways, which are also geometrically possible. It is not merely that we are ignorant of the reason ; there is no reason which we can either know or be ignorant of." But this assumes that, if we exclude " active tendency," the only causally relevant characteristics are relative positions. Have we a right to say this ? It is logically impossible that relative position can be the only charac- teristic of the bow at any time. As Prof. Stout himself has insisted elsewhere, it is in general logically impossible that there should be things with only " primary " qualities, although it does not necessarily follow from this that all or any of their other qualities are the same in kind as those we perceive in sense-experience ; and, knowing as little as we do about physical objects, we cannot exclude the possibility that the primary qualities which we regard as causally efficacious, when combined with other qualities unknown to us, may entail the observable effects, while they cannot entail them when taken by themselves, even though these other qualities may have no resemblance to conation. But Prof. Stout has several other arguments for his view of the world beside the doctrine that causation entails conation, and perhaps some of these may " do the trick." As regards the argument from teleological process and Mr. Mace's comment that " given any state of affairs or any system it is possible to conceive some purpose with which the existence of that system or state of affairs would accord," it seems to me that the question is one of degree. Suppose that in a game of bridge one of the players had four or more spades in his hand three times in succession ; this would be a distribution favourable to the presence of spades in his hand, but it would not justify any suspicion of manipulation. But suppose that in three consecutive hands he had all the spades, the probability of this apart from manipulation is so small as to justify the strongest</page><page sequence="52">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION 73 suspicions. Similarly in nature the occurrence of a few circumstances rather more favourable to the production of a given result than to others would constitute no basis for an argument from design. As Mr. Mace points out, no possible universe could be equally favourable to all conceivable results. But it does not follow from this that the accumulation of a large number of circumstances, the combination of which would in the absence of purpose be vastly improbable, all favourable to the realization of certain results, might not form the basis of an argument from design, whether the argument be directed to the establishment of purpose in particular living beings or to the conclusion that the whole physical universe was designed by Mind. But there is not space to discuss such a big topic, nor again shall I go into the argument that no transition from cause to effect can be intelligible unless "what is new in the subsequent state as compared with the prior state consists in a new determination of a determinable common to both," as Prof. Stout himself only refers to this important and powerful argument briefly here and does not discuss it. I hope that in the discussion Prof. Stout will say some- thing more about his argument " from continuity or solidarity " (p. 59). I am afraid that at present I fail to understand it. Does he suppose that we immediately apprehend this continuity between our actions and the world-process (or that part of it which connects specially with our actions) ? And, if so, is that not to make the strange and audacious claim that we immediately apprehend physical objects, though independent of us, to be in their real nature mental ? If not, how are we aware that they are continuous with our activity in any sense which implies their being " akin to what I myself experience in being active ? " We may be aware of them as being continuous with our activity in the sense of being relevant to it, but this need not imply qualitative likeness. I agree with Prof. Stout that the mere sensory qualities present in experiences of strain and pressure can never give us an experience of active endeavour, though I should not</page><page sequence="53">74 A. C. EWING. have thought from my reading of his paper that Mr. Mace meant to maintain that they did; but I should like very tenta- tively to throw out the suggestion that we may be directly conscious of causation in being passive as well as in being active, the difference being that, while in the latter case we are conscious of our state of mind and perhaps body as cause, in the former we are conscious of it as effect. I am inclined to think that, if somebody seized me by the collar and forcibly led me out of the room, I should be as directly conscious of being determined by external causes as I am of causing events when I will to do something. In neither case am I conscious of the whole cause, but in both cases I seem to be conscious of a " causal tendency," only in the one case my mental state contains consciousness of it qud part-cause, in the other qud part-effect. The imme- diate experience of being effect is, perhaps, even more common than the immediate experience of being cause. Now in cases where I manipulate a physical object which thwarts or partly thwarts my efforts, as when I try to lift a weight which is too heavy for me, I certainly seem to be aware of causation both in the active and in the passive way, both as agent and as affected causally by the resistance of the object. I admit that it is more difficult to decide what it is precisely of which I am aware in this experience. It does not seem a sufficient account to say that I am immediately aware of my mental states and organic and kinaesthetic sense-data as causally determined; I also seem to be immediately aware of the movements of my body as being affected causally by something other than my own volition, but I feel much more hesitation in asserting this than in asserting that I am sometimes immediately. aware of a causal connexion between mental states. However, it does seem to me that the only reason why anybody should think sensations of stress and strain to be relevant to causation must be because they are commonly associated with an awareness of ourselves either as actively causal or as passively affected by causes or both. The relevant point, I think, is not that we naturally tend to locate the stress in external objects as well as in our own</page><page sequence="54">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION 75 body, though this is no doubt true, whether our doing so is justifiable or not, but that these feelings are accompanied by what seems to be an awareness of ourselves, mind and body alike, not only as acting causally but as affected by external causes. We also seem clearly to have a passive experience of causation rather than an active one where the mental state of believing a conclusion is determined by the mental state of believing its premisses, though the cause here is not external either to our body or to our mind. We are con- scious not of making ourselves believe, if it is a genuine belief at all, but rather of being forced to believe the conclusion by our belief in the premisses. I think that Hume was not wrong in supposing that, when we are inclined to expect something because of past experience, we often have an immediate consciousness of a sort of necessity. Only I should say that this feeling of necessity is not a mere sensation or emotion, but the consciousness of being causally determined, and therefore cannot be used to explain away causation, because it is itself a real immediate experience of causation. I do not, indeed, think that in all these cases of passive causation I see a logical relation between my state and the causes affecting it so that I could infer some of the latter a priori, but that I am aware of myself as necessarily determined without being aware a priori, though I usually am aware empirically, of what determines me. There is no contradiction in supposing that I can be aware of something as necessarily determined without always being aware of what determines it. But I cannot agree with my two predecessors in admitting a priori insight into causal connexion in the physical world. After careful examination of Mr. Mace's instances I still doubt whether there is anything known a priori in them except that two physical objects (or two different colours, &amp;c.) cannot occupy the same space, and I do not think that this is the sort of proposition which could fairly be used to support our view of causation as including entailment. No doubt we know a priori that no cause can produce</page><page sequence="55">76 A. C. EWING. a self-contradictory or a geometrically impossible result, but to know this is not to see any logical connexion between cause and effect, and I do not see that my knowledge that no cause can make two physical things (or two colours) occupy the same space is a case of insight into causation any more than my knowledge that no cause can make 2 -- 2 things equal to five things or two straight lines enclose a space. This knowledge does, no doubt, limit the possible effects of a cause, but this is not because of anything in the cause or in its mode of causation. There is a difference between saying that C cannot cause E because E is itself impossible and saying that we can see that the nature of C entails that it cannot cause E. And, when I examine the accounts of the matter given by Mr. Mace and Prof. Stout, I still do not feel in the least convinced that, when we have abstracted non-causal connexions such as mathematical laws, laws concerning space and the laws of deductive reasoning, there is any a priori element left in our study of the physical world except those general principles which are presupposed in all induction, and one or two slightly less general principles about causation, such as the principle that mere lapse of time apart from events in the time cannot be a cause and perhaps the principles of" continuity " and " generic resemblance " formulated by Mr. Wisdom in his recent book, or something like these. And we know at the best so little about what physical objects are like in themselves that it would be very surprising if we could see any such a priori connexion between the physical causes and the physical effect. If we do not know what the cause is like, we cannot possibly expect to see a priori what sort of effect it is going to produce, even though a mind which knew what it was like might do so. Mr. Mace suggests that it would be unaccountable that the plain man should be so convinced that there are necessary connexions between cause and effect if he could never perceive such a connexion in any particular instance, and this raises an important logical point, for it is a commonly accepted position that we must " see the</page><page sequence="56">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION 77 universal first in particular instances," as it is often expressed. How could we ever have the idea of causal entailment at all if we did not see the entailment to hold in any particular case ? If, as I claim, we have a priori insight into some psychological cases of causal connexion, this meets the difficulty adequately; but we must also remember that entailment is not a relation peculiar to causality, and every sane person has encountered many perfectly clear instances of entailment outside causation altogether. This is sufficient to enable us to understand what is meant by entailment and assume its presence intelligently even in cases where we cannot see it for ourselves. The human mind has undeniably a strong inclination to suppose that everything which occurs has some reason, whether this be a self-evident principle or a pragmatic postulate or the supreme logical principle of " coherence ", and the meaning of " reason " and the ideal of rational explanation are supplied partly by the psychological cases of causal explana- tion through motives and partly by the cases outside causation where we do succeed in giving reasons and proofs which satisfy the intellect. (Even the savage has some idea of entailment, for even he knows, at a very elementary level, what it is to see the force of proofs or arguments, while also knowing that motives can furnish an intelligible explanation of human action.) I do not deny that the " entailment " (or rationalistic) view of causation has to face difficulties; so has every philosophical view. Of these difficulties I am profoundly conscious, but I still hold to the view. My chief reasons are, firstly, that I can attach no meaning to a causation in which the effect is not necessarily determined, and. I can attach no meaning to a necessary determination which would leave it perfectly possible for the necessarily deter- mined event to be different without contradicting either its own nature or the nature of that which determines it; and, secondly, because I, like Prof. Stout, hold that such a view is the logical presupposition of any inductive argument, and that, unless it is admitted, all the uniformities in nature observed by us are merely a gigantic series of</page><page sequence="57">78 A. C. EWING. coincidences so improbable that a gambler who staked his money on the hope of having all the trumps in his next hand would be almost prudent compared to a person who should expect their continuance. For I can see no middle term between supposing that there is a rational ground for the repetitions observed in nature and supposing that they are mere coincidences (unless indeed we supposed that all non-human causation was the direct act of God, done for no reason but purely arbitrarily, and that no physical event ever affected causally any other physical event, a theory which would hardly be palatable to most opponents of the rationalistic view). However, I shall not expatiate on the reasons in favour of the view, but rather say a word about two of the diffi- culties, which can be treated together. In the first place, it may be asked how it can be the case that inductive methods presuppose a relation of logical entailment between the cause (C) and the effect (E) when, as I have admitted, the physical scientist does not see that C entails E in any cases and yet goes on with his work quite successfully; and, secondly, it may be asked how it is that causal inferences are always only probable, while inferences based on logical entailment are never merely probable but always certain, except in so far as the person who draws the inference may have committed a fallacy or the premisses are uncertain. My answer to the first question is that, though the scientist does not see the connexion, his inductive arguments logically presuppose its presence. For he certainly argues from cause to effect, and how can he possibly be justified in doing that if they are not connected by any relation of entailment ? Nobody can legitimately accept arguments in which the premisses do not entail at least the probability of the conclusion. (Of course, on any view the premisses " all cases of C are followed by E " and " this is a case of C" entail the conclusion " this is followed by E," but I am not referring to the relation of entailment between these, which is non-causal. I am claiming that the major premiss cannot itself be justifiably asserted without assuming the presence of a relation of entailment. For to say that all</page><page sequence="58">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION 79 cases of C are followed by E is itself to say that we can always infer from the presence of C that E will follow, unless indeed it is merely a generalization about past instances, in which case it cannot justify any prediction. To insert the general major premiss is only to put the question further back, not to avoid it altogether.) If we are to argue from C to E, it would seem that C must entail E. But we do not see that it does entail E, so how can we use causal arguments at all in regard to the physical world? The answer is that, while it is necessary, if we are to argue from C to E, that we should have grounds for supposing that C entails E, it is not necessary that we should ourselves see the entailment to hold. We may have less direct reasons for supposing it to hold. Let us take a case that is in one respect, though not in all, analogous to causal reasoning. If I knew that a given figure was a right-angled triangle in Euclidean space, I should have no hesitation in inferring that the square on its hypotenuse was equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides, although I do not see the relation of entailment now, for, while I learnt the proof at school, I have now forgotten it and do not even remember seeing the validity of the proof, though I suppose I once saw it. Yet I can still make the inference because it is rational for me to assume, even without knowing the proof, that it is most unlikely that all geometricians would have been agreed about such a relatively simple point for so long if there had really been no relation of entailment at all. And the same would hold even if the proof were not only forgotten by me, but quite beyond my capacity to understand. Only note that, when we assume the presence of entailment on such indirect grounds, the conclusion is for us no longer certain, but merely very probable. I do not at present, strictly speaking, know that the square on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides. I should only do that if I either knew the proof and saw its validity at this moment or remembered with certainty having done so in the past.</page><page sequence="59">80 A. C. EWING. Now causal inference is also, I think, based on our assuming an entailment without seeing it to hold, though we assume it not on the authority of people who have seen it but for different reasons, and it is this fact that the entailment is only assumed, not seen, which makes causal laws only probable (as far as we can see). We assume the presence of a particular entailment constituting a causal law on the strength of past experience according to the ordinary tests recognized in inductive logic. We may, e.g., use an argument from inverse probability based on the fact that one particular kind of event has followed another so often that if there were no relation of entailment it would be a monstrously improbable coincidence, or again an argument by elimination, of the type of Mill's methods or these as amended by subsequent logicians, to the conclusion that C is the only possible cause of E (this, no doubt, assuming, as we all in practice assume as if a priori, that E has some cause). We by general admission assume particular causal laws on some grounds like these, and to assume a causal law is to assume that from C we can infer E, i.e., it is to assume an entailment. We suppose, e.g., that E has a cause and that, if C has sufficiently often* been followed by E, there is probably a relation of causation, involving entailment, between C plus some other circumstances more or less unknown (call them xy) and E, or, to put it in another way, that C entails E under conditions xy. We also, although we d6 not know fully what xy are, may have reason to think that the conditions xy are usually fulfilled because E has occurred so often when C did, or that they are likely to be fulfilled in a particular new case because the circumstances as far as we can observe are similar to those of the former cases or for some other reason, and then we suppose that E will probably occur in the new case also. E.g., there is very * I am bound to state this rather roughly for the sake of brevity. I do not mean that the mere number of occurrences is the only or chief inductive criterion, and the emphasis is on " sufficiently," not on " often". (Where the evidence of previous experience as to what is relevant warrants it, " once " may be " sufficiently often " to establish the conclusion.)</page><page sequence="60">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION 81 probably a causal law such that the striking of a match causally determines a flame under conditions which even a chemist could hardly specify completely, but which we find to be usually fulfilled, since matches usually do produce a flame when struck. I therefore think that, if I strike a match, I shall probably cause a flame. Uncertainty arises because we do not see the particular entailments which constitute causal laws, but have to suppose them on inductive grounds, and because we do not know all the conditions which entail E. The position in regard to a causal law is as if we had found an arithmetical law to hold for, say, 99 out of the first 100 whole numbers we tried, while unable to give any proof of the law or of a modified form of it which covered the 99 cases and excluded the hundredth. We should then be justified in concluding that the law probably held for most whole numbers, unless we had selected the hundred in a way which left it likely that the application of the law to them might be due to some character which they (or 99 of them) had in common but did not share with all numbers, e.g., if they were all even. We should assume that there were certain unknown conditions besides being a whole number which entailed conformity to the law when they occurred and which did occur with most, though not with all, numbers. Similarly, I assume that there are certain partly unknown conditions (besides being a match) which entail the occurrence of a flame, and which are fulfilled in most cases when we strike a match, and this makes my prediction of the flame not certain, but probable. Even in those psychological cases wvhere we to some extent see causal connexion a priori uncertainty remains, because we are not quite clear exactly (only very vaguely) what law we do see to hold and because we do not know the circumstances fully. In this way, I think, the rationalistic view may be defended against the two above-mentioned objections. Now if this rationalistic view of causation is right, and if psychological causation is alone intelligible, and if that is not due to our mere inability to understand other kinds, the consequences for metaphysics will clearly be very F</page><page sequence="61">82 A. C. EWING. important. If we use " mental " extremely widely to cover every being who has experiences at all, it would even follow that all events were either, in their real nature, mental events (panpsychism) or dependent on a mind. Hence the plausibility of Prof. Stout's view, which has as its ultimate object, I suppose, nothing less than a proof of God, for it is to the second rather than to the first of the two alternatives mentioned in the last sentence that Prof. Stout inclines. I hope that this view will be further developed in the discussion, but at present I must confine myself to the assertion of the rationalistic view about causation and not draw any metaphysical conclusions from it except that the world is much more like a logical system than is usually supposed nowadays. Causation has proved a veritable thorn in the flesh to most philosophers, both rationalists and empiricists, and by puzzling Hume and stirring Kant from his dogmatic slumbers it even led to the destruction of metaphysics twice over, but if Prof. Stout is right it can, on the contrary, serve as a basis on which to establish a metaphysics securely again.</page><page sequence="62">IV-By C. D. BROAD. INTRODUCTION.-Before embarking on a philosophical discussion of Causation it is desirable to draw certain distinctions. I begin by distinguishing between Causal Propositions and Principles about Causation. By a " causal proposition " I mean any proposition which asserts of something that it is causally connected with something. Such propositions may be singular, e.g., " The death of Harold at Hastings caused the defeat of the English Army" ; or they may be universal, e.g., "Friction causes rise of temperature." The latter are called Causal Laws. By a " principle about causation " I mean a general principle about causal propositions. Examples would be: " Every event is causally determined," " An effect and its cause must be manifestations of different determinate values of the same supreme determinables," and so on. Next I will distinguish three questions. (1) Can causal propositions be analysed; and, if so, what is the right analysis of them ? (2) Are there any causal propositions which I know or have grounds for rationally believing? (3) Do I know, or have I grounds for rationally believing, that there are some true causal propositions ? In future I will use the phrase " rationally cognize " for "know or have grounds for rationally believing." It is very easy to confuse the second and the third questions with each other, but they are quite different. If the second is answered in the affirmative, it follows that the third must be answered affirmatively also. But the converse of this does not hold. I might rationally cognize the proposition that there are some true causal propositions, and yet there might not be a single causal proposition which I rationally cognize. Suppose, e.g., that it were a self-evident principle about causation that every event is causally determined. Then I should know that there must be some true causal propositions. But there might still be no causal propositions which I rationally cognize. This F2</page><page sequence="63">84 C. D. BROAD. example suggests that there is a fourth question to be added to our original three, viz., (4) Are there any intuitively or demonstratively a priori principles about causation ? It is clear that there might be such principles even if there were no intuitively or demonstratively a priori causal laws. Let us now consider the connexion between the first question and the second. It might be that, if causal propositions were analysed in a certain way, it would necessarily follow that there would be no causal propositions which I rationally cognize. If I feel certain that this analysis is correct, and I see this consequence, I ought to admit that there are no causal propositions which I rationally cognize. If, on the other hand, I feel certain that there are some causal propositions which I rationally cognize, and I see this consequence, I ought to reject this analysis, even though I cannot think of any alternative to it. But there is a third, and much more uncomfortable, possibility. I may feel quite certain that this is the right analysis so long as I do not notice that this answer to the first question would compel me to give a negative answer to the second. I may feel equally certain that the second question must be answered in the affirmative so long as I do not notice that such an answer would compel me to reject what seems to be the right analysis. If I am in this situation, the only honest attitude for me to take is that of complete doubt and suspension of judgment about both questions. Similar remarks would apply, mutatis mutandis, to the connexion between the first question and the third or the fourth. INDUCTION AND CAUSAL ENTAILMENT.-I think that all the other symposiasts would claim to have rational cognition of some causal propositions, though I am not sure that they would all claim to know some causal propositions. One important line of argument, which is explicit in Prof. Stout's paper and is not questioned by Dr. Ewing or by Mr. Mace, may be fairly stated as follows. (i) In many cases past experience of a certain kind makes it rational for me to conjecture that a particular which I have not examined</page><page sequence="64">85 MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. will have a certain characteristic + if it has a certain other characteristic +. (ii) This would be impossible unless such past experience made it rational for me to cc)njecture that there is a causal law connecting the occurrence of + in any particular with the occurrence in it of +. (iii) If the " regularity analysis " of causal laws were correct, no past experience, however extensive or of whatever kind, would make it rational for me to conjecture that there is such a causal law. (iv) Therefore the regularity analysis of causal laws must be rejected. (v) There is one and only one alternative to the regularity analysis, viz., what I will call the " entailment analysis." (vi) Therefore the entailment analysis of causal laws must be accepted. Professor Stout then drawws certain consequences from this, which the other two symposiasts do not admit to follow. For the present I shall ignore this further step, which is peculiar to Prof. Stout. I will consider the rest of the argument, which is, so far as I know, accepted by the other two symposiasts. One preliminary comment is obvious. Prof. Stout should have shown us quite clearly that, if the entailment analysis is accepted, past experience of the right kind and amount will make it reasonable for me to conjecture that there is a causal law connecting the occurrence of + in any particular with the occurrence in it of +. Suppose that this cannot be shown. Or suppose it can be shown that, even if the entailment analysis be accepted, past experience will not make it rational for me to conjecture that there is such a causal law. Then, if the rest of the argument is valid, only two alternatives are open. Either: (a) I was mistaken in thinking that past experience will ever make it rational for me to expect that a particular which I have not yet examined will have + if it has +; or (b) there must be some alternative to the regularity analysis beside the entail- ment analysis. This is not merely captious criticism. In the first place, McTaggart, who accepted the entailment analysis, professecl to show that it does not provide a rational basis for inductive inference; and his argument is certainly not prima facie unsound. Secondly, W. E. Johnson, who rejected the regularity analysis, did not accept the entailment</page><page sequence="65">86 C. D. BROAD. analysis Having lodged this preliminary protest, I will turn to clauses (ii) and (iii) of the argument. It seems to me quite certain that clause (ii), as it stands, is false. If past experience of a certain kind and amount will ever make it rational for me to conjecture that a considerable percentage of the as yet unexamined instances of + are instances of +, and will make it reasonable for me to expect that the next one that I meet will be a fair sample of the class of instances of +, this will suffice to make it reasonable for me to expect that the next instance of + will be an instance of +. It is not in the least necessary that the past experience should make it rational for me to conjecture that there is a causal law connecting the occurrence of + with that of +. The artificial example of drawing counters from a bag, noting the colour, and conjecturing the colour of the next to be drawn, is enough to refute clause (ii). No one supposes that we have to assume that there is a causal law connecting the characteristic of being a counter in a certain bag with the characteristic of having a certain colour. Yet, if c.onjectures about the next instance can be justified in any case, they can most easily be justified in these artiScial cases. Nevertheless, I think that this step in the argument can be defended. Even in the artificial cases of bags and counters past experience justifies conjectures about the percentage of +'s which are + only on certain assumptions. We must assume that the +'s which were Q will remain so, and tllat those which were not + will not become so. We must assume that the examined +'s were a fair sample of the whole contents of the bag; that the bag is not so large that there are some parts of it which we cannot reach; that the +'s which are + do not specially stick to our hands; znd so on. Now, in the first place, some of these assump- tions are justified only if we have already established certain laws of nature by induction. And, in the second place, some of them certainly break down when we try to extend the argument from the artificial case to the investiga- tion of nature. It is certain that I cannot have observed any i's which do not yet exist or have not yet happened;</page><page sequence="66">7 MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. that I cannot have observed any which were very remote in past time or very distant in space; and so on. So defenders of clause (ii) might fairly say: " Unless you can establish certain causal laws by induction you cannot justify some of the assumptions which you have to make in order to apply induction to artificial cases like bags of counters. And even then you cannot apply to nature the statistical inductive arguments which you can legitimately apply to the bags of counters; for the assumptions needed for such arguments clearly break down when applied to nature. Therefore, either inductive evidence will justify you in believing certain causal laws of nature or it will not justify you in believing any propositions either about nature or about artificial systems like bags of counters." Let us henceforth take clause (ii) in this amended form. We can now pass to clause (iii) in the argument, viz., that, if the regularity analysis of causal laws were correct, no past experience, however extensive and however regular, would justify me in believing any suggested causal law. It is not necessary at the moment to go elaborately into the refinements with which the regularity analysis would haeve to be stated if it is to avoid certain prima facte objections to it. For our immediate purpose it will be enough to state it in the following rough outline. Any causal law is a statement of the form: " 100 per cent. of the instances of + which have been, are, or will be, in the history ofthe universe, respectively have been, are, or will be, instances of i." I shall shorten this into the more manageable form: " 100 per cent. of the +'s in nature are +." Now it is quite certain that, if my only premise is " I have observed N +'s, and 100 per cent. of them were +," there is no valid form of argument by which I can either prove or render probable the conjecture that 100 per cent. of the i's in nature are +. But there are two very important points to be noticed here. (a) If this be granted, it follows a fortiori that there is no valid form of argument by which, from the same single premise, I could prove or render probable that the presence of + in anything entails the presence in it of +. The proof of this is simple, and, so far as I can see,</page><page sequence="67">88 C. D. BROAD. quite conclusive. It is as follows. The proposition " The presence of 0 in anything is inconsistent with the absence of 4 in it" entails, and is not entailed by, the proposition " 100 per cent. of the O's in nature are 4." The former is therefore a logically more sweeping proposition than the latter. Now it is logically impossible that evidence which will not justify one in accepting as certain or probable the less sweeping of two propositions will justify one in accepting as true or probable the more sweeping of the two. If L is a true causal law, and the entailment view of causal laws is correct, it follows that the proposition which the regularity view offers as the analysis of L is true, though it is not the analysis of L. On the other hand, if the regularity view of causal laws is correct, it does not follow that the proposition which the entailment view offers as the analysis of L is true. Hence evidence which would not suffice by itself to prove or render probable the proposition which the regularity view takes to be the analysis of L must afJrtiori be insufficient by itself to prove or render probable the proposition which the entailment view takes to be the analysis of L. (b) Of course it remains possible that I may rationally cognize another premise P, such that the conjunction of P with the proposition " I have observed N c's, and 100 per cent. of them were 4 " would justify me in conjecturing that the presence of 0 in anything entails the presence of 4 in it. But then it also remains possible that I may rationally cognize another premise Q, such that the conjunction of Q with the proposition " I have observed N O's, and 100 per cent. of them were 4 " would justify me directly in conjecturing that 100 per cent. of the O's in nature are 4. I propose henceforth to substitute for the phrase " the presence of 0 in anything entails the presence in it of 4 " the shorter phrase " 0 conveys 4)." And I propose to substitute for " 100 per cent. of the O's in nature are 4 " the shorter phrase " b is always accompanied by 4 " This being under- stood, the discussion proceeds as follows. Anyone who wants to use the argument which we are examining ought to substitute for clause (iii) the following set of four clauses. (iii, a) The empirical premise that</page><page sequence="68">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 89 100 per cent. of the N O's which I have observed have been 4 does not, by itself, justify me in conjecturing that 0 is always accompanied by 4. (iii, b) A Jortiori this empirical premise, by itself, does not justify me in conjecturing that 0 conveys 4. (iii, c) I do not rationally cognize any proposi- tion Q, such that the conjunction of Q with my empirical premise would justify me in conjecturing that 0 is always accompanied by 4 but would not justify me in conjecturing that 0 conveys 4. (iii, d) I do rationally cognize a certain proposition P, such that the conjunction of P with my empirical premise would justify me in conjecturing that b conveys 4 and would therefore a fortiori justify me in con- jecturing that 0 is always accompanied by 4. My position, so far, is that I accept (iii, a) and insist that (iii, b) follows from it. The question for me turns, therefore on (iii, c) and (iii, d). In order to show the reader what sort of propositions I have in mind when I talk of P and Q, I will ask him to consider the two following propositions. (1) " Every characteristic of any particular is conveyed by some other characteristic (simple or compound) of that particular." (2) Every characteristic of any particular is an invariable companion of some other characteristic (simple or compound) of that particular." Proposition (1) entails, but is not entailed by, Proposition (2). But this is quite compatible with Proposition (1) being self-evident to a certain person and Proposition (2) not being self-evident to him. Let us suppose that Proposition (1) is in fact self-evident to me, whilst Proposition (2) is not. If I found Proposition (1) self-evident, I should know that in each of the N instances of 4t which I have observed there must have been some characteristic or set of characteristics (not necessarily the same in all) which conveys 4. Since all the N observed instances of 4 were also instances of 0, it might perhaps be legitimate to conjecture that it was 0 which conveyed 4 in all the N observed instances. If so, it would follow that it is equally legitimate to conjecture that any instance of f will be an instance of 4. If Proposition (2) is not self-evident to me, I could not use it in a similar way to justify directly the conjecture that 0 is invariably accompanied by 4). But</page><page sequence="69">9o C. D. BROAD. suppose that Proposition (2) were self-evident to me. Then I should know, as an immediate consequence of it, that in each of the N instances of + which I have observed there must have been some characteristic or set of characteristics (not necessarily the same in all) which is always accompanied by +. Since all the N. observed instances of + were also instances of i, it might perhaps be legitimate to conjecture that + is a characteristic which is always accompanied by +. I should then have reached the same conclusion directly, instead of reaching it indirectly as a consequence of a previous conclusion about conveyance. I am not, of course, saying that either of these propositions (I) and (2) is self-evident, or that the first is and the second is not. Nor am I saying that the suggested arguments which use them as premises are valid. I am merely asking the reader to make certain suppositions on these points, in order that he may understand what I have in mind in clauses (iii, c) and (iii, d) of my amendment to clause (iii) of the argument which we are examining. It is now evident that anyone uho uses this argument is bound to do two things. (a) He must indicate to us some general principle about the conveyance of characteristics in nature, which we can rationally cognize, and which, in conjunction with suitable empirical premises, will justify us in conjecturing that a certain characteristic (simple or compound) conveys a certain other characteristic. (b) He must show that we do not rationally cognize any general principle about the invariable accompaniment of characteristics in nature, which, in conjunction with suitable empirical premises, will justify us in conjecturing that a certain characteristic (simple or- compound) is invariably accompanied in nature by a certain other characteristic. My position about this is that I agree as to (b), but am still anxiously awaiting enlightenment about (a). I will now restate the argument in an amended form, and will indicate what I accept in it and what seems to me doubt- ful. ( I ) JVo fact of the form: " I have observed N instances of + and they have all been instances of + " will justify me in making a conjecture of the form " A certain unobserved</page><page sequence="70">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 91 instance of 0 is probably an instance of 4 " unless some facts of the first form will justify me in making conjectures of the form: " Probably b is always accompanied by f." This clause has to be stated in the above rather complicated way in order to allow for the fact that one may be justified in strongly expecting that the next counter to be drawn from a bag will be red, in view of the observation that several have been drawn and have all been red, and yet may not be justified on the same evidence in conjecturing that all the counters in the bag are red. I accept clause (1), when thus stated. (2) No fact of the form : " I have observed N instances of 0 and they have all been ( " will suffice by itself to justify a conjecture of the form: " Probably 0 is always accom- panied by 4." Some additional premise is needed; and, if I am to make use of it, I must rationally cognize it. I accept clause (2). (3) I do not rationally cognize any proposition which, in conjunction with an empirical premise of this form, would justify me in making a conjecture of the form : " Probably 0 is always accompanied by 4," but would not justify me in making a conjecture of the form : " Probably 0 conveys +." Speaking for myself, I admit clause (3). (4) Empirical facts of the form under consideration do sometimes justify me in making conjectures of the form: " A certain unobserved instance of 0 is probably an instance of 2." I do not feel at all certain of this clause when I reflect on its implications, though I cannot help constantly actipg as if I believed it. (5) Therefore I do rationally cognize some proposition which, in conjunction with empirical facts of this form, would justify me in making conjectures of the form: " Probably 0 conveys b." I do not feel at all certain of this conclusion. It is difficult enough to state any proposi- tion which would do what is wanted of it if I did rationally cognize it. Something like Keynes's Principle of Limited Variety would seem to have the best credentials for the post. It is still more difficult to believe that one rationally cognizes any proposition which would do what is wanted of it.</page><page sequence="71">92 C. D. BROAD. Thus my position may be summed up as follows. I accept the first three clauses; and I admit that they, in conjunction with the fourth, entail the fifth. I therefore admit that the fourth implies the fifth. But the fifth seems so doubtful that the only result is to make me feel doubts, which I might not otherwise have felt, about the fourth. If someone should now say to me: "After all, you may rationally cognize some proposition of the kind alleged in the conclusion of the argument, although you have never succeeded in disentangling it and getting it clearly stated," I should, of course, agree that this is possible. But the more heartily I agreed the more inclined I should be to go back on my acceptance of clause (3). My ground for admitting that I do not rationally cognize any principle which would justify me in conjecturing that + is always accompanied by + but would not justify me in conjecturing, on the same empirical evidence, that + conveys +, is simply that I cannot think of any principle which would answer these conditions and is rationally cognized by me. It is not that I can positively see that there could not be a rationally cognizable principle which fulfilled the positive and the negative condition. I think that Prof. Stout and Dr. Ewing would perhaps claim to see this. If so, the fact that they cannot formulate the principle which the conclusion asserts that they must rationally cognize would not cast any doubt on clause (3). It would therefore not tend to invalidate the argument for the conclusion that they do in fact rationally cognize such a principle. But suppose that one's only ground for accepting clause (3) is failure to formulate any principle answering to the conditions, and that there is no positive insight that the conditions could not be fulfilled. Then the admission that I might rationally cognize a principle without being able to disentangle it and formulate it weakens my ground for accepting clause (3) just as much as it strengthens the conclusion against an obvious prima facie objection. This completes my discussion of the argument from the validity of inductive inferences to the entailment view of causation. It seems to me to be a very important argument,</page><page sequence="72">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 93 for the following reason. Suppose that all the premises were accepted; and that the conclusion, which undoubtedly follows from them, were drawn. Then we should have done something much more important than merely showing that the regularity view of causal propositions is inadequate. Direct inspection and reflexion might, perhaps, convince many people that the regularity analysis fails to state what they have in mind when they are thinking of a causal law. But a person who admitted this might answer: " Very well. But we have not the least reason to believe any causal law in any sense of that phrase but the sense which it would have if the regularity analysis were correct. Anything more, or anything different, that we may have in mind when we think of causal laws is, so far as one can tell, just baseless superstition which we must hand over to the genetic psychologist for explanation." Now, if the argument which we have been discussing were accepted, this answer could not be made. The argument would show, not only that there is something involved inr the notion of " causal law " which the regularity view ignores, but also that we have reason to believe certain causal laws in a sense of" causal law " which the regularity view fails to analyse. REGULARITY ANALYSIS AND ENTAILMENT ANALYSIS.-It seems to me fairly certain on inspection that I do not mean by " causal laws" propositions of the form " 0 is always accompanied by " limited by conditions about spatio- temporal and qualitative continuity and decked out with psychological frillings. And it seems to me fairly certain on inspection that I do mean by " casual laws " propositions which involve the assertion that one proposition in some sense entails another, i.e,, that the truth of one is in some sense incompatible with the falsity of the other. Whether I have any reason to believe that there are causal laws, and whether there are any causal laws which I have reason to believe, are, of course, two quite different questions from the question : " What do I mean by a causal law ? " And they are left quite open by the negative and the positive statements which I have just made in regard to the latter question. I</page><page sequence="73">94 C. D. BROAD. propose at present to confine myself to some comments on the two alternative types of answer to this question about meaning or analysis. (1) I have an uncomfortable feeling that the most impressive arguments for either kind of analysis are the objections against the other kind. The regularity analysis seems unplausible on inspection, and difficult to reconcile with the supposed validity of inductive arguments. So we are inclined to favour the entailment analysis until we look into it. When we do so we find perhaps that it does very little towards helping to justify inductive inference. And we certainly find that it is not very plausible to identify causal entailment with either of the two kinds of entailment which are commonly admitted to occur, viz., the purely formal necessary connexion between the premise and the conclusion of a valid deductive argument, and the conveyance of extension by shape or of certain geometrical properties by certain others. Yet we not unnaturally hesitate to join W. E. Johnson in postulating a special kind of connexion between attributes, which is " less necessary " than ordinary conveyance and " less contingent" than constant accom- pa/niment ; to use phrases which are, perhaps, as absurd as they look, and yet do seem to express what one feels to be needed. And so, to avoid the unplausibility of one form of the entailment view and the possible nonsense of the other form of it, we may be inclined to favour the regularity view. " How happy could I be with neither," as Macheath might have said if he had had to philosophize about causation. (2) The other symposiasts have not explicitly distin- guished between laws of coexistence of attributes in a substance and laws of sequence of events. It did not seem to be necessary to draw this distinction in discussing the connexion between induction and causal entailment, but it is desirable to draw it now. Laws of co-existence, on the regularity view, are of the form : " Every continuant in nature which has 0 also has '." On the entailment view they are of the form : " The presence of f in any continuant is incompatible with the absence of , from it."</page><page sequence="74">95 MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. Laws of sequence, on the regularity view, would be roughly of the following form. " (a) There have been, are now, or will be events which are manifestations of the characteristic + in circumstances of the kind C. (b) Corresponding to any such manifestation of +, there has been, is now, or will be (according to whether it is past, present, or future) one and only one event which is a manifestation of a certain other characteristic + and which stands in a certain relation R to that manifestation of +. (c) If e and e' be any two manifestations of + in circum- stances of the kind C, then the manifestation of + which corresponds to e, in accordance with the last clause, will be a different eorent from the manifestation of + which corresponds to e'." This looks rather complicated, but I am sure that nothing less complicated will do. The relation R always involves immediate temporal sequence of the +-event on the +-event with which it is correlated. In the case of purely physical causation it involves spatial coincidence or adjunction of the two events. In the case of purely mental causation it involves, perhaps, the concurrence of the two estents in a single mind. Laws of sequence, on the entailment view, would involve a proposition of the following form. " (a) If e is any mani- festation of + in circumstances of the kind C, it necessarily follows that there is one and only one event which is a manifestation of a certain other characteristic + and which stands in a certain relation R to e. (b) If e and e' be arAy two manifestations of + in circumstances of the kind C, it necessarily follows that the manifestation of Q which corresponds to e, in accordance with the last clause, svill be a different event from the manifestation of Q which corresponds to e'." The same remarks apply to R as were made in the immediately previous paragraph. (3) These statements of the two kinds of law, as they would be on the two types of analysis, bring out one point very clearly. The suggested analogy between admitted cases of non-formal entailment, in geometry, e.g., and the alleged cases of causal entailment breaks down almost completely for laws of sequence. All the admitted instances</page><page sequence="75">96 C. D. BROAI). ot non-formal entailment are instances of what I call " conveyance " of one characteristic by another. They are all concerned with the co-existence of attributes in substances. Laws of sequence, on the entailment view, would all involve entailment between instantial propositions. For they would all assert, inter alia, that the occurrence of an event of one kind entails the occurrence of another event of a certain other kind. There is not the least analogy between such entail- ment and the conveyance of one characteristic of a substance by another. (4) This leads me to think that, even if some form of the entailment view be true of laws of sequence, the form of it which is suggested by both Prof. Stout and Dr. Ewing is too stringent to be at all plausible. Dr. Ewing says: " It would be possible in principle, with enough insight, to see what kind of effect must follow, from examination of the cause alone without having learnt by previous experience what are the effects of similar causes." (My italic^s.) Prof. Stout makes similar assertions. Now, even if some form of the entailment view were true, this extremecon- sequence would not follow. Let us grant that a person who had observed a number of different manifestations of + to be immediately followed by as many different manifestations of +, correlated each to each with the former, might be able to see that any manifestation of + must be immediately followed by a correlated manifestation of i. It does not follow that, if only he were acute enough, he could see this before he hAd observed and reflected upon at least one instance of the sequence. Unless Q and R are involved in the analysis of i, as black is in that of negro, it seems obvious that he might have observed a manifestation of + at a time when he could have had no idea of i or of R, and therefore at a time when he could not even have entertained the suggestion that manifestations of + must be immediately followed by R-correlated manifestations of +. And yet, when ex- perience had put him into a position to understand and to contemplate this proposition, and had suggested it to him, he might be able to see that it must be true. In the case of the conveyance of one attribute of a substanceby</page><page sequence="76">97 MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. another attribute of it, the situation which I have envisaged could hardly arise. But, in the case of sequences, it ob-iously might arise. (5) If sse are to befair to the regularity view,we must recognize that it could, and presumably would, distinguish betsseen ultimate and derivative laws. Derivative laws are laws shich follow as necessary consequences from one or more other laws. There are several diffierent ways in which this could happen, and it will be worth while to enumerate some of the more important. (i) Suppose it is a law that + is always accompanied in nature by +, and suppose it is a law that Q is always accompanied in nature by -/. Then it necessarily follows that + is always accom- panied in nature by . This will be a derivative law as compared w ith the two which together entail it. (ii) Suppose it is a law that + is always accompanied in nature by y. And suppose it is a necessary proposition that any- thing which had Q would have co. Then it necessarily follows that + is always accompaniecl in nature by . This w ill be a derivative law as compared with the law which, in conjunction with the necessary proposition, entails it. The following are the two most obvious examples. (a) Q might ho a determinate under the cleterminahle o). Or (b) Q might be a conjullctive characteristic of the form X p; and it might be possible to see or to prove that anything which had both X and !1 would nebebsarily have c2), though not every- thing that had i; or everything that had , would necessarily have o). (iii) Suppose, as before, that there is a law that + is always accompanied in nature by ti And suppose it is a rbecessary proposition that anything ss hich had -/ would haxe +. Here again the two most ob-vious examplos would be (a) if ; were a determinate under the determinable +, or (b) if-/ were a conjunction of two charactoristics, )&lt; and [1, about svhich we could see directly or pro-ve that anything which had both of them would neces.sarily have +. Here two different cases can arise, which it is important to distinguish. (a) We might know that there are instances of X in nature. Then we could at once infer the law that X is G</page><page sequence="77">98 C. D. BROAD. always accompanied in nature by 4. This law would be derivative, and would be of precisely the same kind as the other laws, ultimate or derivative, which we have so far considered. We may describe all the laws which we have so far considered as " instantial laws." By this I mean that they are not of the purely negative form: " There are no particulars in nature which have 0 and lack 4 " ; but they are of the form : " There are particulars in nature which have 0, and none of them lack 4." If the regularity view be accepted, all ultimate laws of nature must be instantial, and many derivative laws will be instantial. Now it has been said that there are non-instantial laws of nature. E.g., it is a law that, if two perfectly elastic bodies were to collide, the total kinetic energy of the system would be the same before and after the impact; and this is not an instantial law, since there are no perfectly elastic bodies in nature. It has sometimes been made an objection to the regularity view that it leaves no room for non-instantial laws of nature. I will now pass to the second possible case, and I will show how far and in what way the regularity view can deal with non-instantial laws. (p) We might not know that there are instances of-X in nature, or we might positively know that there are not. At the same time we may see that it would be impossibl6 for anything to be an instance of Z without being an instance of 0. Under these circumstances we should be inclined to assert the law : "If anything were x it would be 4." What would this mean on the regularity view ? It could not be identified with the instantial universal proposition : " There are instances of Z in nature and none of them lack 4," for this is known to be false if it is known that there are no instances of 7 in nature. It could not be identified with the purely negative proposition: " There are no particulars in nature which have 7 and lack 4," for this is a mere truism if it is known that there are no particulars in nature which have 7. Lastly, it could not be identified with the proposition : " The presence of 7 in any particular would be incompatible with the absence of 4</page><page sequence="78">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 99 from it," for this would commit us to the entailment view. What then does it mean on the regularity view ? The answer seems fairly plain. On the regularity view to say: " If anything had 7 it would have " has the following meaning. It means that there is an instantial law of nature, or a set of such laws, such that it, or they, in conjunction with the supposition that there are instances of 7 in nature, .formally entails the proposition: " There are instances of 7 in nature, and none of them lack 4." Take, e.g., the proposition that kinetic energy would be unaltered in total amount by any collision between perfectly elastic bodies. What it means, on the regularity view, is this. There are instantial laws of nature (viz., the Conservation of Momentum and the special laws about impact) which, when conjoined with the supposition that there are perfectly elastic bodies and that they sometimes collide, formally entail the instantial universal : " There are cases of collision between perfectly elastic bodies, and in none of them is there any change in the total kinetic energy of the system." The conclusion is false and one of the premises is false, but this is irrelevant. What we are concerned to assert is that this false conclusion is a necessary consequence of the conjunction of a certain false instantial supposition with certain true instantial laws of nature. It is clear, then, that upholders of the regularity view can distinguish between ultimate and derivative causal laws, and that they can give a plausible interpretation to derivative non-instantial laws. On this point the differences between the upholders of the regularity view and the up- holders of the entailment view are the two following. (i) On the regularity view the ultimate laws will be brute facts ; whilst they will be intrinsically necessary propositions, true in all possible worlds, on the entailment view. (ii) On the regularity view all ultimate laws will be instantial; whilst, on the entailment view, there might be laws which were non-instantial and yet ultimate. Plainly both parties could set before them the intellectual ideal of trying to find a minimal set of ultimate laws which would account for all the observed facts up to date, and they G2</page><page sequence="79">100 C. D. BROAD. would both feel legitimate intellectual satisfaction in pro- position as they reduced this minimal set more and more. If the regularity view is true, insight is being gained, in the negative sense that the number of independent brute facts to be accepted is being reduced, and in the positive sense that one is seeing necessary connexions betweEn facts which are themselves contingent. On the entailment view, and on it only, a further kind of positive insight is conceivable, and it is therefore conceivable that an additional intellectual satisfaction could be enjoyed. For, on this view, the ultimate laws of nature would be intrinsically necessary propositions, " holding in all possible worlds," and therefore it is conceivable that they might become self-evident to us, like the axioms of pure mathematics. (6) So far vve have confined our attention to laws of the crudest kind, viz., those which assert merely of one determinable characteristic 56 that it is invariably associated with a certain other determinable ;. Suppose that there are n determinates, )1) (ffi2) . . . ¢)n) under the determinable +, and that there are n determinates, +1) i2) . . . tJgJnn under the determinable +. Then the more refined kind of laws assert that every instance of any given determinate )r under + is an instance of a certain one determinate under i. They assert that, if ¢)r and +5 are two different determinates under +, then the determinate under Q which invariably accompanies ¢sr is different from the determinate under 6 svhich invariably accompanies 05. When the determinates under + and under 6 are measurable magnitudes, lasvs reach a further degz^ee of refinement. A law then asserts further that there is a certain one mathematical function, characteristic of + and +, such that the number which measures any deter- minate Qr under + is this function of the number which measures the determinate ¢&gt;r which tJrJr invariably ac- companies. A law expressible by a mathematical equation of the form i _ F(+) would have to be stated as follows on the regularity view. " (i) Every determinate under + is invariably accompanied by a certain one determinate under i. (ii) The determinate under + which invariably</page><page sequence="80">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 10 1 aceompanies any one determinate ¢&gt;r under + is different from the determinate under i which invariably aeeompanies any other determinate under +. (iii) There is a eatain one mathematieal operation F, sueh that, if ¢tr be any deter- minate under +, and t4)r be the determinate under Q which invariably aeeompanies ¢&gt;r) then the number whieh measures tpr ean be obtained by performing the operation F on the number which rneasures ir.! The same law, on the entail- ment view, would be stated by substituting throughout the word " conveys " for the phrase " is invariably aeeompanied by," and the phrase " is eonveyed by " for the phrase " invariably aeeompanies." Now there are two remarks to be made about sueh laws. (a) It seems very doubtful whether there is any interpreta- tion whieh ean be put on elause (i) by the regularity view which would not make that elause either false or trivial. If it is interpreted instantially, it implies that there are in nature instanees of every determinate under +. Now in many eases the number of determinates under + is enormous, and perhaps even infinite. It is extremely doubtful whether every possible pressure or temperature or volume has had or will have an instanee in nature. Yet no one would thinli that this was any reason for doubting a well-established formula eonneeting the pressure, the volume, and the temperature of gases. If, on the other hand, it is interpreted non-instantially and yet in aeeord with the regularity view, it becomes trivial as regards arly determinate under + whieh has no instanees in nature. If there are no partieulars in nature whieh have the determinate Nbr) it follows of course that there are no partieulars in nature whieh have Xr and laek a certain determinate l4)r ubder Q. But this is entirely trivial. We want to be able to say: " If there were a partieular whieh had + in the form ¢r (whieh there is not), it wouldllave + in the form QJr (though no partieular in faet does) ". The entailment view can give a meaning to sueh statements whieh does not reduce them to trivialities. So far as I ean see at present, the regularity view eannot. (b) It is extremely diffieult to suppose that we rationally eognize any prineiple whieh, in conjunetion with suitable</page><page sequence="81">102 C. D. BROAD. empirical premises, would justify us in believing a functional regularity but would not justify us in believing a corresponding functional entailment.) I therefore agree with Prof. Stout that, unless there are laws of functional entailment and we have grounds for believing some of them oh empirical evidence, we have no ground for believing any law of functional regularity on empirical evidence. On the other hand, even if there are laws of functional entailment, I could have no right to believe any of them on empirical evidence alone. I should have no ground to believe any of them unless I rationally cognize some principle which, in conjunction with suitable empirical premises, would justify such a belief. Unfortunately I cannot formulate any such principle which I could claim, with the least conviction, to be sufficient for this purpose and to be rationally cognized by me. My conclusion is as follows. Either (a) I do rationally cognize some principle which, in conjunction with suitable empirical premises, would justify me in believing certain laws of functional entailment, although I cannot elicit or formulate any such principle ; or (b) no empirical evidence, however regular, varied, and extensive, gives me the slightest ground for believing a law even of functional regularity. I should tend, primafacie, to reject (b), as contrary to common- sense and to my own unquestioning convictions when not philosophizing about induction. But, when I realize that rejecting (b) entails accepting (a), I become more and more doubtful as to what I ought to hold. ARE ANY CAUSAL PROPOSITIONS COGNIZED " A PRIORI" -? We must begin by defining our terms. To say of a proposi- tion p that it is " known a priori by M " is equivalent to the following statement. " (a) The proposition p is a necessary one. (b) M knows that it is necessary; either by direct inspection of it, or by seeing that it is a necessary consequence of certain other propositions which he sees by direct inspec- tion to be necessary." Now the proposition p might be either primary, i.e., not about any other proposition, or it might be secondary, i.e., about some primary proposition q. If p is secondary, it might be of the form : " The proposition q is more probable than not, given the datum h." If I</page><page sequence="82">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 103 know this secondary proposition a priori, and I am acquainted with the datum h, I may be said to " have a priori grounds for believing q." We can now define the statement : " M has a priori cognition of the proposition x." It means: "M either knows x a priori or has a priori grounds for believing x." We have seen that it is impossible that any causal law should be rationally cognized by induction unless certain principles, which we have not managed to formulate, are rationally cognized. I think it is evident that these principles, if rationally cognized at all, must be cognized a priori. But the question remains whether any causal proposition is an object of rational cognition to any human mind. The connexion between this question and the questions which we have been discussing in the earlier part of the paper is the following. If the entailment view of causal propositions is correct, they are propositions of such a kind that they might conceivably be known a priori, though it is, of course possible that none of them is in fact known a priori. For, on the entailment view, they are necessary propositions ; and therefore it is conceivable that someone might be able to see or to prove the necessity of some of them. If the regularity view of causal propositions is correct, they are propositions of such a kind that they could not con- ceivably be known a priori. For, on that view, they are contingent propositions. Having cleared up these preliminary matters, I will now make the following remarks on the question at issue. (1) We are always liable to think that we have a priori knowledge of a synthetic proposition when really we are having such knowledge only of a trivial analytic proposition which we have confused with the former owing to some trick of language. The following would be an example. It might be said that I know a priori that it is impossible for me to be now remembering an experience e unless I formerly had the experience e. Now this is true in the sense that the phrase " remembering e " is commonly used in such a way that no experience of mine would be called a " memory of e " unless I had formerly had the experience e. But, in</page><page sequence="83">104 C. D. BROAD. that sense, it is analytic and trivial. If, on the other hand, it is taken to mean that I could not have had an experience which is psychologically indistinguishable from a memory of e unless I had experienced e beforehand, the proposition is synthetic and interesting, but is almost certainly not known a priori. (2) Prof. Stout's claim to know a priori certain psycho- logical causal propositions connected with inference seems to me very interesting. If he claimed to know a priori that the proposition : " I am now believing p and seeing that it entails q " causally entails the proposition " I shall believe q in the immediate future," several objections might be made. I might lose consciousness in the immediate future or be struck dead. Or the effect might be that I begin to doubt p or to doubt whether I saw that p entails q. Lastly, it seems to me conceivable that, if none of these things happened, I might still avoid believing q if it were very distasteful to me. But I think that the claim can be stated in a way which will avoid these objections. Suppose we put it as follows : " So long as I am having the experience of believing p, of seeing that p entails q, and of considering whether q is true, it is impossible that I should be having the experience of disbelieving q." When the proposition is put in this form, it does seem to me to be self-evident; and, so far as I can see, it is not merely analytic. It is, of course, a proposition asserting simultaneous causation ; whether an equally plausible example of an apparently self-evident and synthetic proposition involving causal sequence could be produced I do not know. (3) Dr. Ewing holds that there are " degrees of a priori intelligibility." He is content to claim that we can see " apart from experience " that some kinds of sequence (among mental events, at any rate) would be " more intelligible than others." Prof. Stout says that insight into necessary connexions among natural processes " is in general, and perhaps always, only partial and imperfect." But it is no more so, he adds, " than, from the nature of the case, it ought to be in view of our inevitable ignorance of what actually takes place in causal process."</page><page sequence="84">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 105 It seems to me that this notion of " degrees of a priori intelligibility " or of " partial and imperfect insight into necessary connexions " needs more explanation than it has received. I am going to try to clear it up. Let us call any instance in which a number of conditions c1 c2 . . . c, are simultaneously fulfilled in a certain relation S to each other a " concurrence " of these conditions. Let us suppose that any concurrence ofc, c2 . . . c,, entails the simultaneous or immediately subsequent occurrence of one and only one event of a certain kind e which stands in a certain relation R to that occurrence. Let us further suppose that, if C and C' are two different concurrences of these conditions, the R-correlated e-event whose occurrence is entailed by C is different from the R-correlated e-event whose occurrence is entailed by C'. Finally, let us suppose that there is no selection from c1 c2 ... c,, such that the propositions enumerated above are true of this selection. Then I shall say that c1 c2 . . . cn are a " Smallest Sufficient Condition " of e. I shall say that any one of these conditions, or any selection consisting of several of them, is a " Relatively Necessary Condition " of e. Now it is possible that there might be a number of alternative Smallest Sufficient Conditions of e. If there is any condition common to all the Smallest Sufficient Condi- tions of e, I shall call it an "Absolutely Necessary Condition " of e. It is quite possible that there should be no Absolutely Necessary Condition of e. On the other hand, it is possible that there might be several Absolutely Necessary Conditions of e. If so, I shall call the most numerous set of conditions common to all the Smallest Sufficient Conditions of e "The Greatest Absolutely Necessary Condition " of e. If e should have only one Smallest Sufficient Condition, every factor in this will be an Absolutely Necessary Condition of e, and e's only Smallest Sufficient Condition will be identical with e's Greatest Absolutely Necessary Condition. Now even if e has several alternative Smallest Sufficient Conditions, and if it has no Absolutely Necessary Condition, it might still be possible to arrange e's Relatively Necessary</page><page sequence="85">106 C. D. BROAD. Conditions in what I will call an " order of dispensability." Suppose that e has N alternative Smallest Sufficient Con- ditions, and has no Absolutely Necessary Condition. Suppose that a certain condition c1 is present in m of these, and that a certain other condition c2 is present only in k of them, where k is less than m. Then there would be a per- fectly good sense in saying that whilst c1 and c2 are both relatively, and neither absolutely, necessary conditions of e, c, is a " more dispensable " condition of e than c1 is. To be an absolutely necessary condition of e is the same as to be a condition of e which has zero dispensability. Now what is called " The Law of Universal Causation" may be stated as follows. " (i) Every kind of event has one or more Smallest Sufficient Conditions. (ii) Every occurrence of an event of a given kind e is due to one and only one occurrence of one and only one of the Smallest Sufficient Conditions of e. (iii) If E and E' are two different occurrences of an event of a given kind e, then the occurrence to which E is due and the occurrence to which E' is due are different occurrences of the same or of different Smallest Sufficient Conditions of e." This is a principle about causation which many people would claim to find self-evident, even if they did not claim to find any causal proposition self-evident. I have defined " Smallest Sufficient Condition," and the other notions which are correlated with it, in terms of the entailment view of causation. But it would be possible, no doubt, to define them in terms of the regularity view ; and a person who accepted the regularity view might find the Law of Universal Causation self-evident just as much as a person who accepted the entailment view. On the other hand, a person who accepted the entailment view, and who further claimed to find certain causal propositions self- evident, might nevertheless not find the Law of Universal Causation self-evident. We must now apply these considerations to the question of " degrees of insight" into causal connexions. Let us assume that a person accepts the entailment view of causa- tion and finds the Principle of Universal Causation, when stated in terms of entailment, self-evident. The former</page><page sequence="86">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 107 assumption is certainly true of all the other symposiasts ; they have not made any explicit statement on the second point, but I think it is safe to assume that Prof. Stout and Dr. Ewing, if not Mr. Mace, do find the Principle of Universal Causation self-evident when stated in terms of entailment. Consider the following five propositions. (i) "c is a relatively necessary condition of e." This is equivalent to the proposition : " There is at least one Smallest Sufficient Condition of e which contains c as a factor." (ii) " c is an absolutely necessary condition of e." This is equivalent to the proposition: " Every Smallest Sufficient Condition of e contains c as a factor." (iii) " c1 c2 .. . . Cm is the Greatest Absolutely Necessary Condition of e." This is equivalent to the proposition : " c 2 . . . c, are all contained in every Smallest Sufficient Condition of e, and no other factor is contained in every Smallest Sufficient Condition of e." (iv) " c1 c,... c, is a Smallest Sufficient Condition of e." This is equivalent to the proposition : " Each of the condi- tions c1, c2, ... c, is a relatively necessary condition of e, and their concurrence in a certain relation R to each other is a sufficient condition of e." (v) " c cc2 .. . c, is the only Smallest Sufficient Condition of e." This is equivalent to the proposition : " Each of the conditions c1, c2 ... c, is an absolutely necessary condition of e, and their concurrence in a certain relation R to each other is a sufficient condition of e." It is evident that (i) is a weaker proposition than (ii) and that (ii) is weaker than (iii). It is also evident that (iv) is weaker than (v) and that (iii) is weaker than (v). I do not think that any direct comparison can be made between (iv) and either (ii) or (iii). But it follows immediately that (i) is the weakest and (v) is the strongest of all these propositions. The mildest possible claim to a priori knowledge of causal laws would be the claim to know a priori some propositions of the form (i). This claim is certainly made by Prof. Stout and Dr. Ewing. The boldest claim would be the claim to know a priori some propositions of the</page><page sequence="87">108 C. D. BROAD. form (v). I do not think that any of the other symposiasts make this claim. An important intermediate claim would be to know a priori some propositions of the form (iv). This would involve knowing a priori some propositions of the form (i). For, if I know a priori that c, c2 . . . c, is a Smallest Sufficient Condition of e, I ipso facto know, with regard to each of the factors, that it is a relatively necessary condition of e. I am not sure whether Dr. Ewing claims to know a priori any proposition of the form (iv). But the example of the psychological law about inference would seem to imply that Prof. Stout claims to know some propositions of this form a priori. Now the growth of insight into causal connexiens, which Prof. Stout talks about, might take two forms. It might be extensive, i.e., we might get to know a priori more propositions of a certain form than we knew before. Or it might be intensive, i.e., we might pass from knowing a priori only pro- positions of a weaker form to knowing a priori certain propositions of a stronger form. Even if we do not do this, we might pass to knowing a priori that certain propositions of a stronger form are more and more highly probable. I am not sure whether Prof. Stout would claim that insight grows intensively as well as extensively, And, if he claims that it grows intensively, I am not sure whether he would claim that this intensive growth of insight is of the first kind or that it is only of the second. (4) Propositions of the form : " c is a relatively necessary condition of e " might be rationally cognized in two different ways, which might be called " the direct way " and " the indirect way " respectively. And the direct way might take two different forms. (i) It might be that, without ever having observed a transaction in which an occurrence ofe was due to a Smallest Sufficient Condition in which c was a factor, I could know a priori that c is a relatively necessary condition of e. If so, I should know this in the direct way. (a) Supposing this to be possible, I might be able to know a priori that c is a relatively necessary condition of e merely by reflecting on c and without needing to have observed an occurrence of e. Dr. Ewing seems to claim such know-</page><page sequence="88">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. 109 ledge. (b) It might be that I should need to have observed occurrences of e in order to give me the idea of e, but that, when I reflect on both c and e, I can know a priori that c is a relatively necessary condition of e. This seems to me to be a much more reasonable claim. These are the two forms of the direct way of rationally cognizing that c is a relatively necessary condition of e. (ii) Suppose I observe a certain occurrence of e, and suppose I know the Law of Universal Causation. Then I know that this occurrence of e must have been simultaneous with or immediately successive to a certain one occurrence of one or other of e's Smallest Sufficient Conditions, and that this occurrence of e must stand in a certain relation R to this occurrence of this Smallest Sufficient Condition of e. Suppose I know that the relation R involves spatial adjunc- tion or coincidence between the occurrence of an event and the occurrence of its Smallest Sufficient Condition in the case of physical events, and that it involves occurrence in the same mind in the case of mental events. If e is an event of a physical kind, suppose that a certain condition c was fulfilled in the immediate neighbourhood of this occurrence of e just before it happened. And suppose that, so far as I know, the situation in the immediate neighbour- hood of this occurrence of e immediately before it happened differed from the situation in this neighbourhood a little while ago only by the fulfilment of c. Then it would be reasonable to conjecture that c is a relatively necessary condition of e. This could never be more than a reasonable conjecture. For, even if I know that only circumstances in the immediate neighbourhood of a physical event can be conditions of its occurrence, I could never know that the observed fulfilment of c immediately before the occurrence of e was the only change that had taken place in the immediate neighbourhood of this occurrence of e immediately before e happened. This is what I mean by the " indirect way " of getting rational cognition of a proposition of the form:" c is a relatively necessary condition of e." It certainly cannot be said to give a priori knowledge of any causal proposition.</page><page sequence="89">110 c. D. BROAD. But it can be said that it gives us rational belief in certain causal propositions, which is based partly on a priori know- ledge of causal principles and is not reached by problematic induction. CAUSATION AND CONATION.-I propose to say very little on this topic, partly because I have had to say so much about the other parts of our subject, and partly because I find myself in almost complete agreement with the remarks which Dr. Ewing and Mr. Mace have made about Prof. Stout's theory. What I wish to add is this. In defining the notion of" Smallest Sufficient Condition," and the other notions connected with it, we had to mention two kinds of relation, S and R. S is the relation which a number of simultaneously fulfilled conditions must have to each other if they are to be factors in a single occurrence of a single Smallest Sufficient Condition. It might be, called a " Co-operative Bond." R is the relation in which each occurrence of e stands to one and only one occurrence of some one of e's Smallest Sufficient Conditions; each different occurrence of e being correlated by R with a different occurrence of some one or other of e's Smallest Sufficient Conditions. It might be called a " Consecutive Bond." It is plain that the Co-operative Bond involves more than mere spatial coincidence or adjunction in the case of purely physical conditions, and that it involves something more than mere occurrence in one and the same mind in the case of purely mental condi- tions. Similar remarks apply to the Consecutive Bond. Now any ideas that we may have of co-operative bonds and consecutive bonds must presumably be derived from instances in which we were acquainted with an occurrence of a Smallest Sufficient Condition followed immediately by the occurrence of the event which it caused. Plainly one's own conative processes are the most striking and important instances of this kind of process with which we are acquainted. It is therefore highly plausible to hold that we derive from our acquaintance with them the idea of a number of factors co-operating or conflicting with each other and thus forming a single Smallest Sufficient Condi-</page><page sequence="90">MECHANICAL AND TELEOLOGICAL CAUSATION. Ill tion. And it is plausible to hold that we derive from the same source the idea of a certain event being the event which is determined by a certain occurrence of a certain set of co-operating and conflicting simultaneous conditions. It is from the qualities and relations and changes of particulars with which we are acquainted that we must ultimately derive all the ideas by which we think of things and processes with which we are not acquainted. The ideas of spatial characteristics, of extensible qualities, and of motion and qualitative change, which we ascribe to physical objects, are derived ultimately from the spatial characteristics, the sensible qualities, and the sensible motion and qualitative change, which are manifested to us by the sensa that we sense. Similarly, when we think of physical things and processes as causal factors which co-operate and conflict and thus constitute total causes of certain physical events, the ideas which we use must ultimately be derived from instances of co-operation, conflict, and consequence with which we are acquainted. And the most striking, if not the only, instances with which we are acquainted are our own conative processes, whether successful or thwarted. Therefore, when we think of the external world under dynamical categories, we are no doubt using conceptions derived ultimately from our acquaintance with our own conative processes ; just as, when we think of the external world under spatial and kinematic and qualitative categories, we are using conceptions derived ultimately from our acquaintance with visual, tactual, auditory, and other sensa. Both procedures are psycho- logically inevitable ; and, if either is epistemologically justifiable, there is no reason to think that the first is so and the second is not. On the other hand, we must remember how extremely remote a concept, which is ultimately derived from certain features in objects with which we are acquainted, may be from the sensible or introspectable characteristic which is its ultimate source. Contrast, e.g., the notion of a generalized non-Euclidean N-dimensional manifold with the visual field and the spatial characteristics which it presents to our</page><page sequence="91">112 c. D. BROAD. inspection. The co-operative and consecutive bonds and their terms, which are involved in purely physical causation, may be as remote from those which we find in our own conative processes as the generalized non-Euclidean N-dimensional manifolds of the abstract geometer are from the visual fields which are the ultimate source of his spatial concepts.</page></plain_text>
