<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK LIST 409 be fully heard and evaluated, and it is to be hoped that the publication of this collection, drawing attention to the coherence of his programme, will facilitate this. [H.G.M. WILLAMSON] 0. KAISER, Gottes und der Menschen Weisheit. Gesammelte Aufsdtze. BZAW 261. viii + 321 pp. DM 168. W. de Gruyter, Berlin, 1998. The volume is a collection of fifteen previously published studies (all in German) by the professor emeritus of Marburg University, written between 1987 and 1997. The essays deal with questions regarding biblical and Greek wisdom and centre around the main insight of the finitude of human existence and the infinitude, transcendence and immanence of God. The titles of the essays are as follows: "Die Ersten und die Letzten Dinge"; "Einfache Sittlichkeit und theonome Ethik in der alttestamentlichen Weisheit"; "Der Mensch, Gottes Ebenbild und Statthalter auf Erden"; "Erwagungen zu Ps viii"; "Ps xxxix"; "Schicksal, Leid und Gott. Ein Gesprach mit dem Kohelet, Prediger Salomo"; "Determination und Freiheit beim Kohelet/Prediger Salomo und in der Frihen Stoa"; "Die Botschaft des Buches Kohelet"; "Beitrage zur Kohelet-Forschung"; "Anknupfung und Widerspruch. Die Antwort der judischen Weisheit auf die Herausforderung durch den Hellenismus"; "Was der Freund nicht tun darf. Eine Auslegung von Sir xxvii 16-21"; "Der Tod des Sokrates"; "Die Rede von Gott am Ende des 20. Jahrhundert"; "Die Bedeutung des Alten Testa- ments fur Heiden, die manchmal auch Christen sind". Detailed indexes of biblical ref- erences as well as authors, persons and items conclude this useful collection. [A.C. HAGEDORN] M. KLINGBEIL, Yahweh Fighting from Heaven. God as Warrior and as God of Heaven in the Hebrew Psalter and Ancient Near Eastern Iconography. OBO 169. xii + 361 pp. Universitatsverlag, Freiburg/Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, Gottingen, 1999. The title of this book perfectly describes its contents: Klingbeil compares the metaphors used in the Psalter with pictorial representations of ancient Near Eastern deities. He begins by surveying theories of metaphor and then charts the occurrence of various metaphors in the Psalter. The Warrior motif occurs almost exclusively in Books 1 and 2, with few in Book 3 and none in Books 4 and 5. There follows a detailed study of selected passages from Psalms xviii, xxi, xxix, xlvi, lxv, lxviii, lxxxiii and cxliv, concluding with more interesting charts of word distribution which show that there is virtually nothing in common between the texts apart from the divine name. The final part is a fasci- nating close inspection of 93 depictions of divine figures in ancient iconography, cov- ering far more than just warrior figures. Klingbeil concludes that the psalms employ a limited set of metaphors for God, of which two-thirds are anthropomorphic (p. 304). He cautiously offers an interesting conclusion: "As a compilation of hymns and songs, it is reasonable and possible to assume a rough chronological order for the Hebrew Psalter... If one correlates the decreasing frequency ... of the divine warrior metaphor, it appears that the metaphor lost its popularity..." (p. 305). He speculates about the possible dating of these psalms in view of the fact that the relevant iconography dates from the 9th to 7th centuries, and notes that this warrior motif, important in the "early" psalms, was also important in the Book of Revelation. It would have been interesting to see a similar study of anthropomorphisms, perhaps in relation to the demise of the monarchy and the survival of its ideology in Christianity. The Older Testament again? [Margaret BARKER] A. VAN DER KooIJ, The Oracle of Tyre: The Septuagint of Isaiah 23 as Version and Vision. SVT 71. x + 214 pp. Brill, Leiden, 1998. In preparing the text of Isaiah for Biblia Hebraica Quinta (BHQ), van der Kooij has produced this monograph that pro- vides a contribution both to the exegesis of the Septuagint of Isaiah and to the eval- uation of the Septuagint for text-critical purposes. Van der Kooij locates himself within the field of Septuagint interpreters, in the tradition of Z. Frankel from the nineteenth century and L. Prijs and J. Schaper from the twentieth, as emphasizing the exegetical</page></plain_text>
