W. Herschel, son of astronomer William Herschel and an eminent scientist and philosopher of science himself, Emerson reflected on science's implications for religion. "Calvinism suited Ptolemaism. The ir- resistible effect of Copernican Astronomy has been to make the great scheme for the salvation of man absolutely incredible."3 It was not simply Calvinism that Emerson was calling into question; tacitly, it was his own liberal Unitarianism, which had divested itself of orthodox theology but retained the spiri- tual anthropomorphism at its core. "Between 1500 and 1700," Daniel Walker Howe observes, "an intellectual revolution" ini- tiated by the physical sciences "displaced man from his central position in the universe and replaced anthropomorphic pur- posive explanations of events with mathematical models.

"We know not and we cannot conceive of any other justice or goodness than we learn from our own nature/' William Ellery Channing wrote, "and if God have not these, He is altogether unknown to us as a moral being. He offers nothing for esteem and love to rest upon; the objection of the infidel is just, that worship is wasted: 'We worship we know not what/"5 In emphasizing a "likeness" of man to God predicated cir- cularly on a conception of Goďs likeness to man, Unitarians suppressed whatever doubts they may have harbored about the anthropomorphism of their beliefs. While rejecting the old Ptolemaism of the Fall and Atonement, they fashioned a neo- Ptolemaism still more human-centered in binding the "will and government" of God to "those great and fundamental prin- ciples of morality written on our souls."6 Even a radical like Theodore Parker, who dismissed the "personal and anthropo- morphitic Conception" of God as "a phantom of the brain that has no existence independent of ourselves," clung to a divine Father not unlike Channing's in his perfected human qualities of "Wisdom, Justice, Love, and Holiness."7 Emerson the minister cut this parental cord. The day after his May 1832 journal entry on astronomy, he preached a sermon 4 Daniel Walker Howe, The Unitarian Conscience: Harvard Moral Philosophy , 1805-1861 (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1970), p. 27. 5William Ellery Channing, "The Moral Argument Against Calvinism," Works (Boston: American Unitarian Association, 1879), p. 464. 6Channing, "Likeness to God," Works, p. 465, and "Moral Argument," p. 291. 7Theodore Parker, A Discourse of Matters Pertaining to Religion (London: Trübner, 1876), pp. 107, 109.

Chan- ning himself had been wary of science's "perilous tendency" to peer into "the infinite, the unsearchable, with an audacious self-reliance" that held "nothing too sacred for investigation." While acknowledging that the "new lights" afforded by science had enlarged the universe and heightened a sense of divine magnificence, he saw nature revealing a "Universal Sovereign" beneficent in his general purposes but wanting the affections of "a tender father, interested in the individual."8 Astronomy in particular discomfited Channing, Emerson reported after hear- ing his 1823 lecture "Evidences of Christianity," for a "universe of matter in which Deity would display his power &amp; greatness must be of infinite extent &amp; complicate relations and of course too vast to be measured by the eye &amp; understanding of man" (JMN, 2:161). In his own sermon, Emerson adopted a different stance. "In all ancient speculations," he told his congregation, "men were accustomed of course to take man for the type of the high- est beings. . . . Even God himself, the infant religion of all nations has clothed in human form. . . . Astronomy corrects all these boastful dreams." Echoing Herschel, he continued, "When the solar system had been correctly explained to us we found ourselves journeying in a comparatively small opaque planet around a single star and quite too inconsiderable to be noticed amid the millions of burning suns which the tele- scope revealed." Within such a universe, the earth could no longer be taken "as the only object in the care of Providence." Eager to convert loss into gain, Emerson stressed the educa- tive function of astronomy: it corrected theology by discredit- ing old superstitions of "mystic sacrifice" and "atoning blood," and it instilled in humanity a "more generous consideration of God's government" and a more capacious appreciation of his design. Yet how from this cosmic immensity could one derive 8Channing, 'The Present Age," Works, p. 161, and "Evidences of Christianity," Works, p. 212.</page><page sequence="5">EMERSON AND GODLESS RELIGION 577 the "affectionate" and "adorable Being" of Unitarian belief? And what could such a universe have to do with the Sermon on the Mount? Theologically, the most that could be said about "the new and astonishing facts in the book of nature" was that they left Christian morality alone. "Does [astronomy] take one charm from the lowly grace of Christ? does it take away any authority from his lips?" In effect, Emerson has come to terms with the discoveries of astronomy by distinguishing the cosmo- logical from the ethical, the outer from the inner, the Father (or not-Father), creator of a boundless universe like HerschePs that might include beings with "an organization wholly differ- ent from man," from the Son (no longer a Son), the source and center of Christian morality.9 By 1834, having resigned his pulpit, Emerson had dispensed with the anthropomorphic Father altogether. "If the triangles had a god," he noted wryly, "they would paint him with three sides. And men take man of course for the type of the highest beings &amp; suppose whatever is intelligent &amp; great must be like him in nature. Astronomy gives the lie to all this" ( JMN , 4:26). And a year later, "The human mind seems a lens formed to concentrate the rays of the Divine laws to a focus which shall be the personality of God. But that focus falls so far into the infinite that the form or person of God is not within the ken of the mind" (JMN, 5:83-84). Emerson's disavowal of a personal God was, for his contem- poraries, the most alarming of his infidelities. "Take away the Father of the universe," wrote Henry Ware Jr., Emerson's for- mer colleague and mentor at the Second Church, "and, though every ordinance remain unchanged, mankind becomes but a company of children in an orphan asylum."10 Emerson had an- ticipated a response like Ware's when he wrote months earlier, "What shall I answer to these friendly Youths who ask of me an account of Theism &amp; think the views I have expressed of the 9 Ralph Waldo Emerson, Sermon 157, Complete Sermons of Ralph Waldo Emerson, ed.

I say that I cannot find when I explore my own consciousness any truth in saying that God is a Person, but the reverse. I feel that there is some profanation in saying He is personal" (JMN, 5:457). Emerson could thrive without an anthropomorphic God so long as he believed that the universe was consonant with human intelligence, its laws teleologically convergent upon mankind, and morality omnipresent at their core. Unlike Transcendental- ists like Parker, who located "the religious element" in "the con- stitution of man,"11 Emerson was a would-be Copernican who looked outward as well as inward and strove to transform "the worship of the fathers which enshrined the law" in the person of Jesus into "a worship which recognizes the true eternity of the law" inscribed in the universe itself and accessible to human mind.12 While not in its entirety like us, the universe existed/or us. His Copernicanism, in other words, was anthropo centric - a Ptolemaic Copernicanism. Hume, whom Emerson had read in college and labeled the "Scotch Goliath," had argued that "the farther we push our researches" into nature, the more we are "led to infer the universal cause of All to be vastly different from mankind, or from any object of human experience and observation."13 Yet science had to be met, Emerson believed, and, if possible, made an ally. "The Religion that is afraid of science, dishonours God &amp; commits suicide," he wrote in 1831. "It acknowledges that it is not equal to the whole of truth, that it legislates!,] tyrannizes over a village of God's empire but is not the immutable universal law" (JMN, 3:239). Reconciling the laws of nature and the laws of morality in a postanthropomorphic universe would be a priority through- out Emerson's career.

Could one hold fast to a religion of immanent moral law without the stay of a divine Father, or would "Ptolemaic Copernicanism" prove an oxymoron in fact as it was in name? Through the early to mid 1830s, Emerson would immerse him- self in the leading sciences of his day - astronomy, chemistry, geology, botany - hoping to "humanize" them by demonstrat- ing that the laws of nature were indeed ethical in character and manifestations of an anthropocentric design if not of the old anthropomorphic Designer. Religious Atheism I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes his crea- tures, or has a will of the kind that we experience in ourselves. Neither can I or would I want to conceive of an individual that survives his physical death. ...

In Religion without God , published posthumously in 2013, Dworkin writes with a cultural agenda - to define "the religious point of view" as distinct from notions of a personal God and thereby to "lower . . . the temperature" of the battle between secularists</page><page sequence="8">58o THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY and believers.14 Hume had attempted something of the sort two and a half centuries earlier, finding common ground be- tween the theist and atheist in their shared belief in an "original principle of order" congruent to some degree with human in- telligence. Yet Hume had also insisted that the natural order was distinct from the moral order, which was entirely a human construct. Dworkin, a self-described "religious atheist," reaches further; he dispenses with God yet continues to maintain that "inherent, objective value permeates everything," that "human life has objective meaning or importance," and that "everyone has an innate, inalienable ethical responsibility" to live "well" - "well," along with kindred words like "sound" and "true," as determined not by revelation, tradition, utility, or social con- sensus but by a species of intuition (Dworkin calls it "faith") that turns out to be a naturalization of early twenty-first-century liberal humane values.15 Dworkin's values may be estimable, but if they have not their source in a personal God, where are they grounded? Dworkin would draw morality from the sublime beauty and symmetry of the universe as described by scientists like Einstein and Steven Weinberg - his book grew out of the Einstein Lectures delivered at the University of Bern in 2011. But while Ein- stein considered "cosmic religious feeling," as he called it, the highest and deepest form of religion, experienced by "religious geniuses of all ages" and superseding the various forms of an- thropomorphic religion, he did not, as Dworkin claims, believe that "some transcendental and objective value" runs through the universe.16 He was quite explicit on this point: "There 14 Ronald Dworkin, Religion without God (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2013), p. 9. Aside from suggesting latter-day formulations of godless religion, this sec- tion develops three themes directly pertinent to the discussion of Emerson that follows: the problem of relating cosmology to ethics; the role of sanctification in establishing that relationship; and the difference between two kinds of sanctification, one rooted in the intellect's perception of universal order and symmetry, the other in the heart's response to this perception. 15 Hume, Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, p. 218; Dworkin, Religion without God, pp. 9, 10, 14, 18. 16 Albert Einstein, Ideas and Opinions, ed.

[The scientist's] religious feeling takes the form of a raptur- ous amazement at the harmony of natural law, which reveals an intelligence of such superiority" as to dwarf "all the sys- tematic thinking and acting of human beings," moral thinking included.17 Nobelist Weinberg, a non-religious atheist, is even more em- phatic about the disjunction between ethics and "the world- view of science," which he characterizes as "rather chilling." "Not only do we not find any point to life laid out for us in nature, no objective basis for our moral principles, no corre- spondence between what we think is the moral law and the laws of nature, of the sort imagined by philosophers from Anaximan- der and Plato to Emerson. We even learn that the emotions that we most treasure, our love for our husbands and wives and children, are made possible by chemical processes in our brains that are what they are as a result of natural selection acting on chance mutations over millions of years."18 Paul Davies terms a universe like Weinberg's, and "probably" of a "majority" of scientists, "Absurd," using the word ontologically, not pejora- tively: a universe in which "life in general, and human beings in particular, are an irrelevant embellishment in a vast and mean- ingless cosmos, the existence of which is an unfathomable mys- tery."19 And indeed, there is something Camus-like in the final words of Weinberg's 2008 "Without God," a Phi Beta Kappa oration delivered at Harvard 171 years after "The American Scholar." "Living without God isn't easy," Weinberg says, but "there is a certain honor, or perhaps just a grim satisfaction, in facing up to our condition without despair and without wishful thinking - with good humor, but without God."20 The problem that concerns Dworkin and Einstein (not Wein- berg) is the relationship between religious atheists' belief in an 17 Einstein, Ideas and Opinions, p. 40. 18 Steven Weinberg, "Without God," New York Review of Books, 25 September 2008, p. 76. 19Paul Davies, The Goldilocks Enigma (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2008), pp. 261- 62. 2°Weinberg, "Without God," p. 76.</page><page sequence="10">582 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY impersonal "'force' in the universe greater than we are" and their convictions about the moral life implied by that force.21 Every religion "addresses two fundamental human concerns," cell biologist Ursula Goodenough observes: "How Things Are and Which Things Matter." In contrast to those who would broker peace between scientists and theists by confining the former to matters of fact and the latter to matters of value, Goodenough sees "the role of religion" as that of "integrating] the Cosmology and the Morality, to render the cosmological narrative so rich and compelling that it elicits our allegiance and our commitment to its emergent moral understandings."22 This was the role Emerson assigned to religion as well. The question is whether morality can be made to "emerge" from cosmology and, if so, how. Goodenough's own admirable book The Sacred Depths of Nature (1998) is what Melville in Pierre called "more the ex- cellently illustrated re-statement of a problem, than the solution of the problem itself."23 Its twelve chapters on "the dynamics of Nature," from "the level of molecules, genes, and cells"24 through subjects like awareness, sexuality, and death present a clear, concise, and deeply engaging synopsis of how life began, how it operates, and how it evolved and continues to evolve, with each section followed by a spiritual meditation, usually from the Judeo-Christian tradition. The structure of the book is part of its appeal but also a sign of its fracture: the chapters themselves are thoroughly materialistic, the meditations lyrical or quasi-mystical, and the ligature that joins them a glowing appreciation of the intricacy of things available only vicariously to the nonscientist and belonging to a book more aptly titled "Feelings Engendered by Biological Investigations of Nature." 21 Dworkin, Religion without God, p. 2. 22Ursula Goodenough, The Sacred Depths of Nature (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), pp. xiv, 4.

Hume also recognized continuation but only in its outward manifestations, a proto-Darwinian survival of the fittest that appalled him: "blind nature, impregnated by a great vivifying principle, and pouring forth from her lap, without dis- cernment or parental care, her maimed and abortive children." Goodenough understands nature intimately in its generative workings and finds them miraculous, yet in the negatives of her creed - disbelief in a supernatural God, disbelief in a cos- mically inscribed moral law, disbelief in personal immortality - she seems not so very distant from Hume. Richard Dawkins, of The God Delusion (2006), calls her "really as staunch an atheist as I am."25 Dawkins exaggerates. Goodenough's naturalism earns its modifier "religious" but not without trial and not through the medium of the science by which she intellectually lives. She recounts how, as a college student gazing up at the night sky during a camping trip, she was moved to a sense of "bleak emptiness" as she recollected the words of Weinberg: "The more the universe seems comprehensible, the more it seems pointless." She eventually came to terms with the depths of the universe and the recesses of the atom by regarding them as "a locus of Mystery" - the root mystery being, of course, "why there is anything at all, rather than nothing" - but her feelings about that mystery are not of the rapturous kind she has for animate nature. Perhaps this is because she is a life scientist, not a physicist.26 Yet laypersons passing from her book to a primer on cosmology or particle physics may also experience a sense of ontological dislocation. Amoebas are creatures whose 25Goodenough, Sacred Depths of Nature, p. 171; Hume, Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, p. 202; Richard Dawkins, The God Delusion (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2006), p. 13. 26Goodenough, Sacred Depths of Nature, pp. 10, 11.

A hundred billion amoebas do not challenge our beliefs about our privi- leged position in the universe; the hundred billion galaxies of the known universe, each with billions of stars and containing as many as forty billion planets potentially hospitable to life (as was recently reported), very well may. William Ellery Channing felt that threat with astronomy, even in the 1820s. In Nature, Emerson uses the sublimity of the night sky to sug- gest the "reverence" that "all natural objects" awaken "when the mind is open to their influence" ( CW , 1:9), but the stars may as readily evoke the terror Melville's Ishmael feels in the presence of the "heartless voids and immensities of the universe" that stab "us from behind with the thought of annihilation."27 The fraction "Myself (or humanity) over The Universe (infinity)" is a limit approaching zero. In its search for an ever more inclu- sive unity, science, from an ethical point of view, is centrifugal. Goodenough cannot think her way to a master theory of the universe analogous to her biochemical "Epic of Evolution" - no one has and, as Weinberg recently remarked, possibly never will - but she circumvents the intellectual problem of explain- ing the cosmos by appealing to a mode of cognition outside the domain of science; she feels: "As I allow myself to expe- rience cosmic and quantum Mystery, I join the saints and the visionaries in their experience of what they called the Divine." Would she also call it "the Divine"? While acknowledging the subjective authority of mystical states, Goodenough is inclined, like William James in The Varieties of Religious Experience, to regard them as "wondrous mental phenomena." Yet also like James, she believes that the origin and status of mystical experiences - from God? from the unconscious? from the firing of neurons? - is not what finally matters. What matters is their effect upon us, inwardly and in behavior. Though disclaiming 27 Herman Melville, Moby Dick; or The Whale , ed. Harrison Hayford, Hershel Parker, and G.

And unable by temperament or conviction to direct this feeling toward a supernatural Being, she expresses it in "earthly relationships, fragile and mortal and difficult as they are."28 "A quasi-mystical response to nature and the universe is com- mon among scientists and rationalists. It has no connection with supernatural belief," Richard Dawkins states flatly.29 Not per- haps with the anthropomorphic God Dawkins rejects, yet it may provide a critical affective link between cosmic wonder and morality. Calvinists had a word for the process of self- transcendence Goodenough describes - sanctification: the al- teration of being that follows from the illumination wrought by divine grace. Something like "sanctification" seems to be what Einstein was getting at when he sought to relate the ethical side of his religious belief to the cosmological side. Ethically, a "religiously enlightened" person is "one who has, to the best of his ability, liberated himself from the fetters of . . . selfish de- sires" and is actuated by "superpersonal" motives, regardless of any connection "with a divine Being"; cosmologically, "true reli- giosity" originates in an apprehension of "something we cannot penetrate, our perceptions of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which only in their most primitive forms are accessible to our minds." In the highest science, Einstein believed, the ethical arose as a psychospiritual overflow of the cosmological. Unlike Dworkin, Einstein did not claim that the laws of the universe are intrinsically moral, correspond analog- ically to human morality, or substantively underwrite it; their "morality" consists in how they work upon the mind and sen- sibility, lifting the perceiver beyond egotism to what Einstein biographer Walter Isaacson calls "an admixture of confidence and humility . . . leavened by a sweet simplicity." In this respect, Einstein said, science "not only purifies the religious impulse 28Goodenough, Sacred Depths of Nature , pp. xix, 13, 102, 140.

Einstein's synthesis of science and religion was the grail Emerson initially sought in the wake of his 1832 ser- mon on astronomy. When Einstein asserted that "a legitimate conflict between religion and science cannot exist," it was on the condition that such coexistence must exclude the reality claims of "historical religions" with their belief in a God who 30 Einstein, Ideas and Opinions, pp. 44, 45, 11, 38, 49. Walter Isaacson, Einstein: His Life and Universe (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2007), p. 384. Einstein's "sanc- tification" has a more exclusively intellectual cast than Goodenough's; even Einstein believed that his "passionate sense of social justice and social responsibility . . . con- trasted oddly with [his] pronounced lack of need for direct contact with other human beings and human communities" ( Ideas and Opinions, p. 9). Goodenough's "sanctifi- cation," while originating in the mind, produces a warmth of heart that informs her relationships with others. Jonathan Edwards had a term for this quality as it extended outwardly to Creation at large and constituted the essence and distinguishing mark of true virtue: "benevolence to Being in general" (Edwards, "The Nature of True Virtue," Ethical Writings, ed. Paul Ramsey [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1989], p. 594). The distinction between these two kinds of sanctification - a spectrum of shadings rather than a categorical opposition in kind - will be important with Emerson in and after the Divinity School Address.</page><page sequence="15">EMERSON AND GODLESS RELIGION 587 might intervene in nature to answer prayers.31 Having put such a God behind him by the mid- 1830s, Emerson would not have objected to Einstein's codicil. His problem, rather, was that he was not himself a scientist, knew the scientist's religious awe only at second-hand through men like Herschel, and was preeminently a moralist in search of a ground of anthropocen- tric law. For that justification, he looked in the early 1830s to natural philosophy, the parent of science and still, he felt, its proper guardian. "The Idea according to which the Universe is made is wholly wanting to us; is it not?" he observed in May 1834. "We have no Theory of animated Nature" (JMN, 4:287, 288). Four days later Emerson returned to the subject in his lec- ture "The Naturalist." The "highest question of philosophy, Why and How any thing is," once reserved for the theologian or metaphysician, he now assigns to the naturalist, who must avoid the methodological extremes of both the poet, who "tends to lose himself in imaginations and for want of accuracy is a mere fabulist," and the empiric, who tends to focus myopically on detail to the exclusion of inquiry's broader aims.32 The ideal method might begin with the "intimations of the inward Law of Nature" suggested by the naturalist's taxonomical cabinet, such as Emerson had seen the preceding July in the Jardin des Plantes in Paris, but its ultimate object would be the ap- plication of scientific knowledge to a knowledge of man, "the centre from which all our speculations depart" and to which they return (EL, 1:71). "Shall I say that the use of Natural Sci- ence seems merely ancillary to Moral?" Emerson remarked in September 1834. "I would learn the law of the diffraction of a ray because when I understand it, it will illustrate, perhaps suggest, a new truth in ethics" (JMN, 4:322). "Illustration" is the key to Emerson's 1836 Nature , whose effort to unify natural and moral law makes no show of be- ing scientific but is unapologetically speculative and aphoristic. 31 Einstein, Ideas and Opinions, p. 46. 32 Emerson, "The Naturalist," Ttie Early Lectures of Ralph Waldo Emerson, vol. 1: 1833-1836, ed.

Conceived initially as a shorter work, Nature was to be complemented by "another essay, 'Spirit"' (L, 2:26). As the book neared completion, Emerson acknowledged "a crack in it not easy to be soldered or welded" (L, 2:32). Merton M. Sealts Jr. locates the crack ("soon mended," he argues) in the chapters "Idealism" and "Spirit," but a deeper, less remediable crack was inherent in the very impulse behind the book, which sought, like theologies before it, to "reconcile direct revelations of the moral law (or intuited certainties), with a faith in the natural law (or the evidences of experience)."33 The primary sites in which Emerson undertakes this work of reconciliation are the chapters "Language" and "Discipline." With a nod toward Swedenborg ("the laws of moral nature an- swer to those of matter as face to face in a glass") and Madame de Stäel ("the axioms of physics translate the laws of ethics" [CW, 1:21]), Emerson sets out to read the world symbolically, as if nature were a transparent window. In theory, as Walls says, the notion of correspondences "healed the moral gap by making mind and nature aspects of one another"; in practice, Emerson's method of healing in "Language" is to analogize and, like the old Puritan typologists, to ascribe his analogies to the fabric of reality as woven by "the will of God" (CW, 1:22). The analogies themselves turn out to be commonplace: "An enraged man is a lion, a cunning man is a fox. . . . Who looks upon a river in a meditative hour, and is not reminded 33 Laura Dassow Walls, Emerson's Life in Science: The Culture of Truth (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 2003), p. 25; Merton M.

Throw a stone in a stream, and the circles that propagate themselves are the beautiful type of all influence" (CW, mS).34 Emerson is subtler in "Discipline" when he turns from nat- ural facts to natural processes as they teach "lessons" for mate- rial living, which "Reason" then "transfers" by analogy to moral life, divine Intelligence having fashioned outward things so that "they educate both the Understanding and the Reason" (CW, 1:23). The problem is that the imputed authority of Reason can easily slip into the whimsicality of fancy. "Read Chem- istry a little," Emerson reflected in his journal, "&amp; you will quickly see that its laws &amp; experiments will furnish an alpha- bet or vocabulary for all your moral observations": "Thus very few substances are found pure in nature. There are metals like potassium &amp; sodium that to be kept pure must be kept under naphtha. Such are the decided talents which a culminating civ- ilization produces in illuminated theatres, or royal chambers; but those souls that can bear in open day the rough &amp; tumble of the world must be of the mixed earthy &amp; average structure as iron, &amp; salt, atmospheric air, &amp; water" (JMN, 5:233). No chemist would think to make such a connection, nor would any poet other than Emerson, and even he only at a particular mo- ment. "Who can guess how much firmness the seabeaten rock has taught the fisherman?" (CW, 1:27), he asks in Nature, an analogy he himself would ridicule a few years later: "Draw the moral of the river, the rock, and the ocean. The river, the rock, 34Walls, Emerson's Life in Science, p. 48. Thoreau in the early 1850s, under the influence of Swedenborgian J. J. Garth Wilkinson, was also much taken with the power of analogies to disclose higher truths, but Thoreau was more attentive to the particu- larity of things and more skeptical about the intrinsic relationship between metaphor and metaphysics. In "The Pond in Winter," he sounds the depths of Waiden Pond, generalizes his findings into a hypothesis for estimating the deepest point of any pond, then passes by analogy to the kind of moral knowledge that concerns him most: "Draw lines through the length and breadth of the aggregate of a man's particular daily be- haviors and waves of life into his coves and inlets, and where they intersect will be the height or depth of his character." But Thoreau knows he is speaking figuratively; a fact in physical nature has prompted a meditation on moral nature; he does not identify the work of the fabulist with the handiwork of God. Henry D.

In his relation to the material world, Emerson in Nature is essentially a poet masquerading as a metaphysician. He would remain an analogist throughout his career, with or without the guise of science; but his preference, his hope, was always that science could be enlisted in the service of an emergent reli- gion. In 1836 he read Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology, and although he characterized it (unfairly) as "only a catalog of facts" (L, 2:41), its project intersected with his growing interest in the notion of "classification." "Science immature is arbitrary classification," he remarked earlier that year; "Science perfect is classification through an Idea" (JMN, 5:i46).36 Lyell's defi- ciency, and that of other "immature" scientists, was that though they offered a wealth of explanations for the specific operations of nature, they had no unifying theory that embraced all rele- vant phenomena and resonated outward to the moral sphere. The fruit of Emerson's thinking on this subject was an 1836 lecture "The Humanity of Science," whose title indicates both the terms of the problem and Emerson's desired resolution of it. Science, Emerson told an audience primarily of non- scientists, is "the arrangement of the phenomena of the world after their essential relations," on the understanding that all classifications are imperfect, provisional, and subject to more accurate and inclusive formulation.37 This much accords with scientific theory as Emerson found it in Herschel and with prag- matic ideas of truth later advanced by William James. Yet where is the humanity of such science? In what way does a world "sat- urated with law" testify to "the omnipresence of spirit," which 35 Ralph Waldo Emerson, The Later Lectures of Ralph Waldo Emerson, 1843-1871, ed. Ronald A.

"The highest moral of science," he contends, "is the transference of that trust which is felt in nature's admired arrangements ... to the social and moral order" (EL, 2:39). The trust required for this is not trust in nature, whose material order speaks for itself, but trust in the act of transference. "In most of his essays," Lawrence Buell observes, Emerson reaches "a point when he seems to forgo strenuous thought in order to make a leap of faith."38 This is the point in "The Humanity of Science." If Emerson can refer to nature as "overflowed and saturated with humanity" (EL, 2:33), it is because for the pur- poses of this lecture he has identified "humanity" with intellect and reiterated science's belief in the lawfulness and compre- hensibility of natural processes. That is as far as his argument can take him. In the end, all he can legitimately affirm is that "nature proceeds from a mind congenial with ours" (EL, 2:33), a conclusion not unlike that of his bête noire Hume, " that the cause or causes of order in the universe probably bear some remote analogy to human intelligence ,"39 He cannot show that science invites a leap from the natural to the moral or in any way lends support to it. The "crack" he recognized in Nature has not been mended. Although Emerson "continued to read widely in science" throughout his career, as Walls says, 40 his serious writing about science peaked in late 1836. Authoritative on its own terms, science could not carry him where he wanted to go, and in 1837-38 his mental life began to divide in two. Intellectually, in "The American Scholar" (1837), he enlarged upon his idea of classification as the instrument through which the mind brings chaos to order, asserts dominion over the forces of nature, and in doing so unlocks its own latent capacities. Spiritually, in the Divinity School Address (1838), he returned to origins and came forward as what he always fundamentally was, a 38Lawrence Buell, Emerson (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2003), p. 208. 39 Hume, Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion , p. 227. 40 His "most intensive reading in science" occurred in the period 1830-34 (Walls, Emerson's Life in Science, p. 62)</page><page sequence="20">592 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY religionist inspired by a mystical or semi-mystical vision that was his personal equivalent of the scientist's awed apprehension of universal order. Conversion (1827-28) Consider once more the sublime moment in which a man first enters into the realm of religion. The first specific religious view, which penetrates his mind with such force that his sense for the universe is brought to life through a singular stimulation and is now forevermore set in motion, certainly determines his religion; it is and remains his fundamental intuition in relation to which he will view everything, and it determines in advance in which form eveiy element of religion must appear to him as soon as he perceives it. - Friedrich Schleiermacher, On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers (1799) "To have religion," Friedrich Schleiermacher wrote in 1799, "means to intuit the universe."41 This is what Emerson seems to have done early in 1827 as he journeyed south to Charleston and St. Augustine to regain his health, despondent at hav- ing to defer his ministerial career as his peers went about establishing theirs. "Every man," he later remarked, "has had one or two moments of extraordinary experience, has met his soul, has thought of something which he never afterwards for- got, &amp; which revised all his speech, &amp; moulded all his forms of thought" (JMN, 8:10). Languishing in the alien South, his "best hopes set aside," his "projects all suspended" (JMN, 3:60), Emerson began to record a tendency of thought that had been germinating in the shade of his ambition for sev- eral months. "Understand now, morals do not change but the science of morals does advance," he announced on 4 January 1827. "We see that we are standing on a higher stage; that we are instructed by a better philosophy, whose greater princi- ples explain to us the design whilst they comprehend the petty 41 Friedrich Schleiermacher, On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers, trans, and ed.

Marshaling his thoughts as though delivering a sermon that would astonish its listen- ers for its "appearance of novelty," Emerson goes on to unveil a new idea of sin and retribution and of the mechanics and meaning of salvation. "Instead of denouncing a future contin- gent vengeance [heaven and hell] I see that vengeance to be contemporary with the crime" (JMN, 3:62). Virtue is literally and immediately its own reward, vice its own punishment, and temporal experience morally self-regulating and self-sufficient. "I lead a new life," he wrote that April. "I occupy new ground in the world of spirits, untenanted before. I commence a ca- reer of thought &amp; action, which is expanding before me into a distant &amp; dazzling infinity. Strange thoughts start up like angels in my way and beckon me onward" (JMN, 3:78). We cannot know for certain what Emerson experienced in 1827, but evidence in his private and public writings points toward a spiritual illumination of the kind Schleiermacher de- scribes. Like a religious convert, or rather a religious founder, Emerson seems to have felt himself carried graciously across an impassable divide and set down in a wondrous new country uniquely his to explore and report upon. Schleiermacher calls such a moment "the natal hour of everything living in religion," "the birthday of [a person's] spiritual life" - and, in what will prove a fateful prophecy with Emerson, the "fundamental in- tuition in relation to which he will view everything." The object of vision for Schleiermacher is a universe of "infinite fullness" permeated by "laws" that "embrace everything, the largest and the smallest," within a "divine unity" in which "everything is ornately connected and intertwined." This is the universe of science without the scientist's facts and equations: "See how attraction and repulsion determine everything and are uninter- ruptedly active everywhere, how all diversity and all opposition are only apparent and relative, and all individuality is merely an empty name."42 To the visionary who glimpses this universal order, all things, "even the most natural and usual," appear as 42 Schleiermacher, On Religion, pp. 32, 107, 106, 36, 35, 36. Emerson would also latch onto the principle of attraction and repulsion, or "polarity," and make it "the</page><page sequence="22">594 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY miracles; the personality of God as an "existing and command- ing" figure recedes before the grandeur of the universe itself; and ideas of personal immortality come to seem "completely irreligious." "To be one with the infinite in the midst of the finite and to be eternal in a moment, that is the immortality of religion."43 Each of Schleiermacher's constituents of vision would find its counterpart in Emerson, but along a notably different axis. Although "revelation" for Schleiermacher is everywhere the same, it is received by individuals according to what is "original and new for them" within the parameters of religious life in their culture.44 Schleiermacher himself distinguished religion from metaphysics, which seeks to "explain the universe," and morals, which seek to "perfect it," impulses he saw proceed- ing from a narrow anthropocentrism that regarded man as "the center of all relatedness." No New Englander of Emerson's time could have thought in such a way. Explaining the world, perfecting it, and centering it upon the private drama of the self and the communal drama of the millennium had been of the essence of New England religion from the beginning, beyond differences of sect and theology. In its unremitting concern with behavior and "universal immediate retribution," with a de- ity who "reward[s], chastis[es], and punish[es]" individuals and with individuals who reward, chastise, and punish themselves in the deity's name, New England belief and praxis were dis- tinguished by a moral conscientiousness that even iconoclasts like Emerson and Theodore Parker internalized as a matter of course.45 keystone that divided, connected, and stabilized the arc of the universe" (Walls, Emer- son's Life in Science, pp. 127-65, quotation at 127). 43SchIeiermacher, On Religion, pp. 49, 53, 54. As Emerson phrased the idea in his journal and, later, in "Self-Reliance," to "be happy and strong" was to "live with living nature in the deep present above time" (EL, 3:284; Ralph Waldo Emerson, Essays: Second Series, ed.

Almost from the start, compensation had been his vehicle for redressing (or denying) the "uneven balance of condition &amp; character" in "this world" ( JMN , 2:343) an&lt;3 thereby affirming divine beneficence, but by early 1826 it began to assume an additional, psychospir- itual dimension, as lapses from "the severity of virtue" came to appear more "surely" and "deeply" damaging to oneself than to others (JMN, 3:5). God has "devised no fallible police, no contingent compensations," Emerson declared with confidence a year later, shortly after his conversion. "He secured the ex- ecution of his everlasting laws by committing to every moral being the supervision of its own character[,] by making every moral being the unrelenting inexorable punisher of his own delinquency" (JMN9 3:70). As an idea that antedated his revelation of 1827, compensa- tion was for Emerson what Calvinist theology was for Jonathan Edwards, the préexistent structure of thought through which he refracted his vision and within whose terms he came to understand it. Although religious vision was noncognitive, inef- fable, incommunicable to others, and evanescent for oneself - "you might as easily preserve light or electricity in barrels" as try to embody the "truths and laws" of religion "in some out- ward form" (EL, 2:92, 93), Emerson quipped in 1837 - embody them he did in inward form in a theory of compensation whose claims of perfect justice in the material world and scrupulous moral accounting in the soul joined metaphysics to morals in a radically new understanding of religion. In June 1827, he of- fered an initial report of his discoveries in a sermon, his fourth. Compensation "is but the expression of the Justice of God run- ning through the Universe, that every defect in one manner is made up in another, that every suffering is rewarded, every sacrifice is made up; every debt is paid" (CS, 1:83). A year and half later (November 1828), he returned to the thought, proposing to "write a sermon upon the text men are made a law unto themselves. . . . Do you not see that every misfortune</page><page sequence="24">596 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY is misconduct; that every honour is desert; that every affront is an insolence of your own? Don't you see that you are the Uni- verse to yourself. You carry your fortunes in your own hand" ( JMN, 3:142, 144). It would take Emerson nearly a decade to develop that ser- mon. Early on, as a minister, he was constrained by the in- tellectual boundaries of the Unitarian pulpit, which provided an occasion and outlet for his emerging ideas but confined him within an idiom of God, Jesus, and immortality that he was increasingly shedding in his notebooks. But the delay also stemmed from uncertainties within himself. Even before he read Herschel and pondered the implications of astronomy, he had been initiated into a larger, more impersonal universe than Unitarianism could accommodate. Herschel himself, while holding to "an instinctive, perhaps deliberately unexamined, be- lief in a benign Creator," was led by "his own observations," as Richard Holmes says, to realize "how extremely - appallingly - distant, both in time and space, that Creator must be."46 Emer- son felt the distance as well. At times he wondered whether God existed at all and, if he did, how he might "be different from what he is represented" (JMN, 3:69). In framing the issue as such, however, Emerson was still operating within the cate- gory of "God," for he had nothing conceptually to replace God with; his metaphysics had not caught up with his intuitions. His involvement with science in the 1830s was fundamentally a search for an objective correlative that would explain, confirm, particularize, and clarify the nature of what he intuited and establish a warrantable bond between natural law and moral law. By "The Humanity of Science" he had begun to sense that empirical science, however successful in evidencing the congru- ence of mind and world, could not be "humane" in the higher way he required. For the essential thing - the moral law that sacralized nature and transformed knowledge into reverence - he would need to rely on the source and substance of his own primal vision. 46 Richard Holmes, The Age of Wonder: How the Romantic Generation Discovered the Beauty and Terror of Science (London: HarperCollins, 2008), p. 450.</page><page sequence="25">EMERSON AND GODLESS RELIGION 597 Godless Religion (1837-40) It is seen and felt by all the young that the entire catechism and creed in which they were bred, may be forgotten with impunity. . . . The next age will behold God in the ethical laws. - Emerson, "Religion" (1840) Flanked by the 1837 and 1840 lectures "Religion" (the lat- ter a rehearsal for "The OverSoul" [1841]), the Divinity School Address (1838) is the manifesto in which everything spiritually alive in Emerson's thought comes together after long gesta- tion in a gospel founded on all-pervasive moral law. "The spirit only can teach" (CW, 1:84), Emerson proclaims in Hutchin- sonian fashion, two hundred years after the trial, excommuni- cation, and banishment of Anne Hutchinson and close to the spot where the trial had taken place. Speaking from the spirit, Emerson sets out to show his audience of prospective ministers what true religion is. He would lead them back to the experien- tial origin of belief and make each of them what he himself, in enunciating his gospel, effectively becomes, "a newborn bard of the Holy Ghost" (CW, 1:90). Replying to a letter from Henry Ware Jr., Emerson pro- fessed "not [to] know what arguments mean in reference to any expression of a thought" (L, 2:167), yet with the possi- ble exception of "The American Scholar," no performance of his is so carefully structured. A strong topic sentence governs each of its first twelve paragraphs; together, they form an ab- stract of its theological argument, after which the sections on historical Christianity and revitalized preaching function like the "reasons" and "application" segments of a Calvinist ser- mon. Paragraphs 1-3 trace a spiritual ascent. First there is the senses' pleasure in the beauty and perfection of the natural world, then the mind's grasp of its network of "outrunning laws" (the work of classifying intellect), and finally the minďs and heart's opening to "the sentiment of virtue" (CW, 1:76, 77). On this last level, with the phrase "a more secret, sweet, and overpowering beauty" (CW, 1:77), Emerson joins affect to understanding and leaves the domain of science for that of semi-mystical vision. In lineage, the "sentiment of virtue" is not</page><page sequence="26">598 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY an offshoot of the Unitarian moral sense; in its "reverence and delight in the presence of certain divine laws" (CW, 1:77), it is, as Lawrence Buell says, "a secularized descendant of Jonathan Edwards's 'divine and supernatural light.'"47 Emerson, of course, would have denied any such seculariza- tion. What separates his "reverence" and "delight" from that of Edwards and most other religionists is its crystalline charac- ter. "Reverence" is the intellectual aspect of vision, the mind's response to the substance of what is intuited; "delight" is the attendant exultation of the heart. Both are essential to any re- ligious vision, but the balance between them may vary. For Schleiermacher, "intuition without feeling is nothing," and it is "the strength" of one's "feelings [that] determines the degree of religiousness." This is where sanctification plays a critical part for him, linking the cosmic to the ethical in a "heartfelt rever- ence in the face of the eternal and invisible" and a "heartfelt love and affection" for others.48 For Emerson, by contrast, the cognitive side of vision was always primary, and "the heartfelt," though deep and genuine, more coolly akin to a "mindfelt." When Margaret Fuller told him that her "god was love, his truth," he agreed that he was "most at home [with the latter], that he liked the pure mathematics of the thing,"49 a term he often used for the elegant symmetry of his science of ethics. In its awed intellectuality, Emerson's religion was closer in tenor to Einstein's - a reverence arising from "the rationality made manifest in existence"50 - than to Schleiermacher's, which drew warmth, efficacy, and a promise of continuation from the trans- formation of the entire being. In moments of "Revelation," Emerson would write in "The OverSoul," "the power to see, is not separated from the will to do," but "obedience proceeds" from "joyful perception" (CW, 2:167). The problem with a rev- elation so thoroughly sourced in "seeing"- so idea-dependent 47 Buell, Emerson, p. 167. 48 Schleiermacher, On Religion , pp. 31, 29, 45. 49"Margaret Fuller's 1842 Journal: At Concord with the Emersons," ed.

This was the situation Einstein faced when the comprehensiveness of his general theory of relativity was thrown into doubt by quantum mechanics' introduction of un- predictability, irrationality, and the seemingly unscientific and ungodlike element of chance, ideas that Einstein resisted for as long as he could before reluctantly trying to accommodate them.51 Emerson's own developing ideas would presently lead him into equally destabilizing domains, but not as yet. In paragraphs 4-12 of the address, "joyful perception" comes to center upon the law of compensation as it "worketh everywhere, righting wrongs, correcting appearances," and making each individual "the Providence to himself' (CW, 1:78). A living apprehension of this law was, for Emerson, "the essence of all true religion," a sentiment "divine" with respect to its outward object, "deify- ing" for the perceiver, and generative of the various forms of social worship, which inevitably came to betray it (CW, 1:77, 79). The history of religion was thus a recurrent protest of the spirit against its ossification in outward forms; as such it was timeless and cyclical. Beginning with Luther, however, religion was also progressive, a gradual (or sometimes abrupt) disman- tling of trappings and dogmas that led, Emerson felt, to his own incipient religion of ethical law, the next and perhaps the crowning stage in "the reform of the Reformation" he envi- sioned in January 1827, near the time of his conversion (JMN, 4:70). The Divinity School Address ends in a prophecy of this religion-to-come, with Emerson assuming the role of a John the Baptist awaiting "the new Teacher" who shall fully enunci- ate "those shining laws" (as he himself cannot) and show "the identity of the law of gravitation with purity of heart" (as he had tried to do in Nature). The union of the cosmologica! and 51 "For Einstein, and indeed for most classical physicists," Isaacson observes, "the idea that there could be a fundamental randomness in the universe . . . was not only a source of discomfort, it undermined the entire program of physics" ( Einstein , pp. 320-35 at 324).</page><page sequence="28">6oo THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY the ethical, the moral architecture of the universe and the par- ticulars of daily experience, is the crux of Emerson's godless religion. Peripeteia (1841-44) Power ceases in the instant of repose; it resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new state, in the shooting of the gulf, in the darting to an aim. - Emerson, "Self-Reliance" (1841) For it is only the miraculous vanity of man which ever persuades him that, even for the most richly gifted mind, there ever arrives an earthly period, where it can truly say to itself, I have come to the Ultimate of Human Speculative Knowledge; hereafter, at this present point I will abide. Sudden onsets of new truth will assail him, and overturn him as the Tartars did China; for there is no China Wall that man can build in his soul, which shall permanently stay the irruptions of those barbarous hordes which Truth ever nourishes in the loins of her frozen, yet teeming North. - Herman Melville, Pierre (1852) As a literary performance, the Divinity School Address is among Emerson's finest; as a set of propositions about the na- ture and workings of reality - "thefts never enrich; alms never impoverish; murder will speak out of stone walls" (CW, 1:78) - it is as vulnerable to the onslaught of facts and events as a knight without armor. By the time of "Experience" (1844), Emerson would concede as much: "the world I converse with in the city and in the farms, is not the world I think ,"52 The problem went deeper than he allows, since the thrust of the essay's sections on Temperament, the foremost "lord of life," and on Subjec- tiveness, Temperament's epistemological accomplice, has been to compromise the world he thinks.

In "Compensation" (1841), Emerson had argued that a man "needs to thank his faults," for "like the wounded oyster, he mends himself with pearl" (CW, 2:68); now limitation is lim- itation, and lives are skewed, hobbled, or otherwise go astray without any compensatory pearls. Godless religion, as he pub- licly admitted as early as "The Transcendentalist" (December 1841), has become a matter of "flash-of-lightning" moments vouchsafed between long periods of relative darkness, unsus- tained by any form of sanctification, and cherished in memory against the prevailing "buzz and din" of everyday experience (CW, 1:213). Among the primary facts that seemed to controvert belief were those involved with laissez-faire capitalism. Nature's "dar- lings, the great, the strong, the beautiful," Emerson concedes in "Experience," "are not children of our law, do not come out of the Sunday school," or "punctually keep the command- ments" (CW, 3:37); they move commandingly in a world of force distinct from the world of virtue, and yet outwardly they thrive. Emerson had long disdained capitalism as "a system of selfishness" antithetical to Christian ideals (CW, 1:148), but as capitalism asserted itself more forcibly in the early 1840s - and with a harder edge due to advanced technology in the mills, the coming of the railroad to Concord, increased competition, and the abundance of cheap immigrant labor - he needed to make peace with it or relinquish his belief in the moral operation of nature.53 In "The Young American" ( 1844), he did both at once. Set- ting aside his residual identification of law with Christian virtue, Emerson redefined the good in terms of an evolutionary me- liorism that sacrificed the individual to the group and present generations to future ones. The cost of ascribing to nature a long-term teleologica! beneficence rather than an immediate 53For a fuller discussion of Emerson's "detente with capitalism, see my "The Radical Emerson?"

Emerson could reconcile laissez-faire economics with moral law only by reconceiving nature as itself laissez faire and viewing capitalism as its temporarily chosen instrument. Benign in the span of ages, nature's "grinding economy" (CW, 1:231) was pitiless in its daily operation; its ends were not recognizable human ends, its "charity," Emerson allowed, "not our charity." "Our condition," he wrote, "is like that of the poor wolves: if one of the flock wound himself, or so much as limp, the rest eat him up incontinently" (CW, 1:231). By 1844, natural law and moral law have split asunder and left godless religion suspended over a widening chasm. Emer- son would return to evolutionary meliorism years later in "Fate" (i860), but ontological tough-love was uncongenial to him and would always be a choice of last resort, forced upon him by ex- perience. There was another path available to him in the early 1840s, less grimly deterministic. Having delivered his religious credo in the Divinity School Address, then withdrawn from the fray to become "a chartered libertine free to worship &amp; free to rail" (L, 2:167), Emerson could set the subject aside and turn to what privately absorbed him most, his journey into new intellectual territories. "We grizzle every day. I see no need of it," he remarked in 1840. "Whilst we converse with what is above us, we do not grow old but grow young" ( JMN , 7:380). He would repeat those words in "Circles" (CW, 2:189), the last of the 1841 Essays to be written, the most prospective, and, in this respect at least, the greatest. Unlike its companion pieces, "Circles" has little to say about the "soul," except as a synonym for the active "self," or about the "moral sentiment" and God. The world it envisions is a naturalistic one, "fluid and volatile," ceaselessly unfolding according to laws of its own, and "spiri- tual" chiefly in that the advances of the individual and the race seem prompted by a kind of tropism responsive to "the in- struction flowing from all sides" (CW, 2:179, 189). Nowhere in</page><page sequence="31">EMERSON AND GODLESS RELIGION 603 his writings does Emerson better illustrate what George San- tayana called "the transcendental method in all its purity": "He opened his eyes on the world every morning with a fresh sin- cerity, marking how things seemed to him then, or what they suggested to his spontaneous fancy."54 Much of the material in the 1841 Essays is an elaboration of notebook entries and lectures, some dating back as far as the early 1830s; "Circles" is a more accurate index of the direction Emerson's thought was taking in 1840-41 - toward a life of "sacred" becoming in which "every moment is new" and "nothing is secure but life, transition the energizing spirit (CW, 2:189). "The way of life is wonderful," the essay proclaims; "it is by abandonment" (CW, 2:190). As he wrote these words, Emerson could hardly have known where "abandonment" would lead him. Delivered at Water- ville (now Colby) College in August 1841, five months after the publication of the Essays , "The Method of Nature" reads like "Circles" spun wildly out of control. The "fluid and volatile" universe of the earlier essay has accelerated into a "torrent" that sweeps everything before it, not least human beings who pre- sume to fix it in thought or flatter themselves it exists to serve them (CW, 1:124, 125)- The title of the address recalls Nature, but its occasion of a "literary anniversary" (CW, 1:120) and opening remarks on the role of the scholar also invite compar- ison to "The American Scholar." In the 1837 oration, Emerson had praised the great classifiers who convert the raw facts of experience into usable truths; now he concedes fragmentation: "there is no man; there hath never been" (CW, 1:122). The prospect in "Circles" of limitless self-expansion has turned to disenchantment. "How tardily men arrive at any thought! How tardily they pass from it to another thought" (CW, 1:122). And how seldom, if ever, they attain to depth. "All men's thinkings run laterally, never vertically" (CW, 1:122). Metaphysically, Emerson continues to regard nature as the material expression of mind, but he has ceased to claim its 54George Santayana, "The Genteel Tradition in American Philosophy," in The Es- sential Santayana , ed.

His faith in the world's inscribed meaning has given way to humility before a "perpetual inchoation" in which "every natural fact" (formerly symbol of a spiritual fact) is seen as "an emanation, and that from which it emanates is an em- anation also, and from every emanation is a new emanation" (CW, i:i24).55 In this new, radically kinetic universe, eveiy- thing is in process of "becoming somewhat else; is in rapid metamorphosis," and "those who hold fast to one thought, and do not flow with the course of nature," will be "crazed" (CW, 1:124, !26, 124). The would-be allegorist of 1836 has become a vitalist whose cognizance of nature's headlong energies has left his anthropocentrism in ruins. While no less perfect than before, nature gives no sign of being organized to serve hu- man beings or even of being intelligible to them; our capacities are inadequate to gauge the dizzying "length of [its] line, the return of [its] curve" (CW, 1:126). Five years earlier he had asked, "to what end is nature?" (CW, 1:7) and answered confi- dently, we are its end. Now he denies nature any single iden- tifiable end; it exists for its own infinite self-fructification and "obeys that redundancy or excess of life which in conscious be- ings we call ecstasy" (CW, 1:126), spawning "new firmaments without end" (CW, 1:125-26) like bubble universes within modern cosmology's mysterious multiverse. What this want of discernible method amounts to we cannot guess beyond sus- pecting it has only peripherally to do with us. "'I have ventured so great a stake as my success, in no single creature,'" Emer- son has nature say; "T have not yet arrived at any end"' (CW, 1:126). "In proportion as we advance," Alexander von Humboldt ob- served of "intellectual progress," "the field to be traversed ac- quires additional extension" and "is bounded by a horizon which 55 Robert D. Richardson, in Emerson: The Mind on Fire (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995), p. 348, traces "emanation" to Emerson's 1841 readings in Neoplatonic philosophy. The essential point is how Emerson appropriates it for his own purposes.</page><page sequence="33">EMERSON AND GODLESS RELIGION 605 incessantly recedes before the eyes of the inquirer."56 "The Method of Nature" represents such an "advance" for Emerson but not, for the purposes of his godless religion, a salutary one. The Copernican universe of Galileo, Newton, and Herschel has run amok. Having long ago rejected anthropomorphic religion, Emerson, impelled by the logic of his thought after "Circles," seems to have vaulted himself beyond anthropocentric religion. Like Humboldt, who, according to Walls, viewed the laws of nature as "amoral," wanting "destination," and "vastly larger" than human interests and purposes,57 Emerson now sees hu- manity as displaced from the teleological as well as the spatial center of the cosmos. "If man himself be considered as the end, and if it be assumed that the final cause of the world is to make holy or wise or beautiful men," he writes, "we see that it has not succeeded" (CW, 1:125). Rather, human beings are them- selves instruments of an obscure purpose that employs them with a "wasteful hospitality" (CW, 1:125), bringing them forth whenever nature has some "work to be done" or when some "link was wanting between two" of its "craving parts" that they uniquely might supply (CW, 1:128). They fulfill their proper role and themselves become modest partakers of nature's ec- stasy when they recognize its demand on them and consent to serve as "vents for the current" of its onrushing life (CW, 1:130, 129). In a remarkable act of severance, Emerson has left nature to run its precipitous course while holding on to only so much of it as inspires individuals to fill their contributory parts. David Jacobson sees "The Method of Nature" as central to Emerson's 1841 "turn from humanism to anti-humanism."58 Emerson has indeed (for a time at least) shed his cosmic anthropocentrism, yet he can still maintain, on different grounds, that "the fact of facts is the termination of the world in a man" (CW, 1:127). 56 Alexander von Humboldt, quoted in Laura Dassow Walls, Seeing New Worlds: Henry David Thoreau and Nineteenth-Century Natural Science (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1995), p. 85. 57Walls, Seeing New Worlds, pp. 85, 86, 92. s8David Jacobson, Emerson's Pragmatic Vision: The Dance of the Eye (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1993), p. 191.</page><page sequence="34">6o6 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY Precisely because we can not fathom nature, we must give it a general assent and domesticate the small corner of it we col- onize. "The universe does not attract us until housed in an individual. Who heeds the waste abyss of possibility?" (CW, 1:127). Although we can no longer consider ourselves nature's focal point, we are nonetheless, Emerson continues to insist, our own. This is not "anti-humanism" so much as revision- ary neohumanism, or ethical Ptolemaism asserted against the backdrop of a universe expanded beyond all comprehensible bounds - a godlessness without visible religion, humanistic by default. Cosmologically Emerson's most prescient essay - a contem- porary scientist might feel at home with its universe - "The Method of Nature" has no close antecedent in his writing and no obvious successor. Its argument is tortuous, its nervous en- ergy difficult to characterize or explain. The established con- tours of Emerson's universe seem to have blown apart, and he is at once exhilarated and dismayed to find himself in a vaster, more unfamiliar space than he had ever imagined. His discomfiture may be a sign of growth - "only as far as [people] are unsettled, is there any hope for them," he had written in "Circles" (CW, 2:189) - but now, instead of carrying him deeper into his original vision, growth has led him away from it into terra incognita. Challenges to belief often begin with some outward disillu- sion and work their way inward to the emotions; with Emerson the reverse seems to have been true: a psychological crisis pre- cipitated a philosophical one. Richardson alludes to Emerson's "low spirits" in 1841, about the time of the Essays' publica- tion.59 Emerson's editors situate the Waterville address at a "low point in a time of personal crisis" (CW, 1:117). Privately his life during this period was marked by dissatisfactions with his character and vocational role, by frustrations within his mar- riage, by the demands of his relationships with Margaret Fuller and the group of friends she brought into his orbit, and by the importunities of reformers (abolitionists, Brook Farmers) 59 Richardson, Emerson: Mind on Fire , p. 345.</page><page sequence="35">EMERSON AND GODLESS RELIGION 607 that he come forth from his scholarly seclusion and join them. Intertwined with these circumstances was a consciousness of depleted energies, demoralizing for anyone but especially so for a man who viewed success as an unfailing adequacy to the perceptual moment.60 "Live without interval: if you rest on your oars, if you stop, you fall. He only is wise who thinks now; who reproduces all his experiences for the present exigency," he wrote in an 1839 lecture, a paragraph following the sober counter-statement: "After thirty a man begins to feel the walls of his condition which before the soul did over flow" (EL, 3:89, 88). "The Method of Nature" is the work of a man who feels his private limitations and looks to the transpersonal for energy, infinitude, and a ground for affirmation. In "Circles" he had qualified his claim of perpetual self-transcendence with an ac- knowledgment of "this infirm faith, this will not strenuous, this vast ebb of a vast flow! I am a God in nature, I am a weed by the wall" (CW, 2:182). "The Method of Nature" returns to this idea before reassessing the ways of the universe and humanity's place in it. The connection between the personal and the cosmological is emotional, not logical. Nature seems bewilderingly vast, furious in pace, and humanly alien because Emerson no longer has confidence in his power to compre- hend it steadily. "The wit of man, his strength, his grace, his tendency, his art," he writes in a newly chastened spirit, "is the grace and the presence of God. It is beyond explanation" (CW, 1:122). And later, "There is virtue, there is genius, there is suc- cess, or there is not. There is the incoming or the receding of God: that is all we can affirm, and we can show neither how nor why" (CW, 1:127). The lines anticipate the more familiar ones in "Experience": "The ardors of piety agree at last with the coldest skepticism, - that nothing is of us or our works, - that all is of God. ... I can see nothing at last, in success or failure, than more or less of vital force supplied from the Eternal" (CW, 2:40). Emerson has not returned to something 60 See Stephen E. Whicher, Freedom and Fate: An Inner Life of Ralph Waldo Emerson (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1953), p. 98.</page><page sequence="36">6o8 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY like an anthropomorphic God; he is speaking figuratively of a power so alien to consciousness and will that it is experienced as if from outside. When "we say that our virtue &amp; genius are unconscious, that they are the influx of God, &amp; the like," he re- flected in April 1840, we mean "merely relative to us; we speak, we act from we know not what higher principle, and we de- scribe its circumambient quality by confessing the subjection of our perception to it, we cannot overtop, oversee it, - not see at all its channel into us" (JMN, 7:344). All Emerson can assert of these mysterious powers is that they are not his to com- mand, and after years of living as a pensioner dependent on their ebbs and flows, he is ready to concede that the condition is permanent and irremediable, indeed that it has worsened. When psychic energy wanes, the universe it brings forth and animates threatens to collapse, like Berkeley's universe deprived of Berkeley's God. Reassigning "ecstasy" from the endogenous individual to endogenous nature - indeed, redes- ignating nature's force as "ecstasy" in place of the earlier "inchoation" - was a form of strategic adjustment for Emerson. It enabled him to preserve his faith in nature's systemic benefi- cence even as he allowed that such benefit might not accrue to himself, to any individual, or perhaps even to the human race. Measured against his claims only months earlier in the Essays, it was a pyrrhic victory won through drastic retrenchment.

Reading Humboldt's Cosmos</page><page sequence="37">EMERSON AND GODLESS RELIGION 609 soon after its first volume appeared in America in 1845, Emer- son marveled at Humboldt's "extended centre &amp; expanded wings," yet almost immediately he felt obliged to reiterate his words from "The Humanity of Science" of nine years earlier: "the moral of science should be a transference of that trust which is felt in nature's admired arrangements ... to the social &amp; moral order" (JMN, 9:270). Without a "confidence that the Law provided for every exigency," he added, "... we should rush to suicide out of the door of this staggering Temple" (JMN, 9:27i). "Experience" had ended with an intractable problem - the disjunction between the world of thought and the world of material reality. As if in sequel, Representative Men, delivered as a course of lectures in 1845-46 and published with revisions in 1850, begins at precisely this point: "Two cardinal facts lie forever at the base [of philosophy]: the One, and the two. - 1. Unity or Identity; and 2. Variety," with every mind inclining "by temperament and by habit" toward one or the other.61 The implied aim of the book is to work toward a reconciliation that "has not yet appeared" - specifically, to "draw the line of relation that subsists between Shakespeare," the poet of variety and student of the world, "and Swedenborg," the unifier who "saw the poetic construction of things, and the primary relation of mind to matter" (CW, 4:3, 53, 80). Emerson's list of exemplary men initially included only five (Plato, Swedenborg. Montaigne, Shakespeare, Napoleon); the sixth, Goethe, was a late addition but also, for Emerson's pur- poses, a crucial one. More than anyone Emerson had encoun- tered in literature or life, Goethe realized his ideal in "The American Scholar" of "Man Thinking" (CW, 1:53). "A thou- sand men seemed to look through [Goethe's] eyes," he wrote in the Dial essay "Thoughts on Modern Literature" (1840). "He learned as other men breathe. . . . He was not afraid to live. ... All conventions, all traditions he rejected. And yet he 61 Ralph Waldo Emerson, Representative Men: Seven Lectures , ed. Wallace E.

Hereafter cited as CW 4.</page><page sequence="38">6io THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY felt his entire right and duty to stand before and try and judge every fact in nature."62 It was not what Goethe knew or aspired to that impressed Emerson most; it was how his mind worked. He was the ultimate classifier, distilling the age's "miscellany of facts" (CW, 4:156) into unifying principles and embodying the "humane science" Emerson sought as a groundwork for and illustration of the identity of natural and moral law. When in 1834 he began to think seriously about classification and a "Theory of animated Nature," it was Goethe's "Metamorphosis of plants" that came to mind (JMN, 4:288; see also JMN, 5:220). What Emerson himself could theorize about, Goethe did, and in areas so diverse - "there is nothing he had not right to know; there is no weapon in the armoury of universal genius he did not take into his hand" (CW, 4:163) - as to make him seem the type of humanity that nature and history had been striving to produce and the potential augury of a post-Transcendental godless religion. Because Goethe so admirably filled the role of scholar and served Emerson's immediate purpose of reconciling mind and world, it is surprising that "Goethe, or the Writer" should turn critical in its later pages. Privately, Emerson's resistance may have been the self-protectiveness of an ego living in the shadow of "the high-priest of the age" (JMN , 5:202); even Emerson's actual friends had to be kept at a distance lest in "talk[ing] with them and studying] their visions" he should "lose [his] own" (CW, 2:126). His more substantive objection to Goethe concerned the absence in him of any "overarching religious or metaphysical system."63 Inquisitive about the world's parts, Goethe seemed insensible to the grander laws that disposed and regulated them. Though a seeker of unity in nature, Goethe "has not worshipped the highest unity," Emerson complained, and "is incapable of a seifsurrender to the moral sentiment" (CW, 4:163) - an idea Emerson will continue to invoke at •"Ralph Waldo Emerson, "Thoughts on Modem Literature," in vol. 12 of Complete Works of Ralph Waldo Emerson (Boston: Houghton MifHin, 1904), pp. 322-23. 63Gustaaf Van Cromphout, Emerson's Modernity and the Example of Goethe (Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1990), p. 117.

Epistemologically, the distinc- tion between Goethe and Emerson is roughly that between, in Walls's terms, an '"empirical holism,'" which "work[s] toward a vision of that whole through the interconnectedness of in- dividual details," and a "'rational holism,"' which "embrace[s] the whole in a visionary moment and [sees] details in that moment's light."64 More deeply, the distinction for Emerson was between godless religion and what amounted to natural- istic humanism, or no religion at all. "The worldly tone" he found in Goethe's "tales" - reading Wilhelm Meister , he was "charmed with the insight" but "never transported above the dominion of the senses ... or armed with a grand trust" ( JMN , 7:367) - reflected for him the ethos of their author, who "loved the world out of gratitude" for its pleasures (CW, 4:165) and whose efforts to possess it by sense and intellect embraced the whole of nature but never, in Emerson's view, reached beyond it. As scientist and humanist both - Copernican in his free inves- tigation of phenomena, Ptolemaic in his search for their relation to humanity - Goethe might have been presented as a proto- type for "the transformation of genius into practical power" that Emerson had anticipated in "Experience" (CW, 3:49). Goethe could inhabit a world like the one in "The Method of Nature" and, without leaping to total unity or despairing of its elusive- ness, bring a range of its particulars to speculative local unity, as in his theory of the leaf, which Emerson calls "the leading idea in modem Botany" (CW, 4:158). For Emerson, however, local unity was not sufficient. "Yes, O Goethe! but the ideal is higher than the actual," he protested in the Dial essay.65 In Representative Men, the idealist and "the Puritan" in Emerson 64 Walls, Emerson's Life in Science, p. 1. Walls elsewhere sees Goethe's "obsession with unity," though having "an imperial edge," as "imperial," or totalizing, in its ultimate aim - a "rational holism" in contradistinction to Humboldt's "empirical holism" (Seeing New Worlds , p. 35). Right or wrongly, Emerson saw Goethe differently because his own notion of unity was a perfect synthesis of the natural and moral. By Emerson's measure, if not by Walls's, Goethe was someone who worked from the bottom up, through nature, rather than from a holistic vision of universal Law. 65 Emerson, "Thoughts on Modern Literature," pp. 329-30.</page><page sequence="40">6i2 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY combine to exorcise Goethe, whose version of godless spiri- tuality was unacceptably earthy in both its intellectual and its behavioral (specifically, sexual) neglect of moral law.66 In an undramatic but significant way, the chapter "Goethe; or, the Writer" represents a watershed in Emerson's develop- ment. Rejecting an open-ended quest for knowledge that at- tends closely to the world, frames unifying natural hypotheses, but never claims to apprehend moral unity, Emerson casts his lot with an a priori idealism that will increasingly estrange him from experience and rarefy his work. Having been examined and found wanting, Goethe joins each of his five predeces- sors, who (with the partial exception of Plato) have also failed, either for neglecting the real (Swedenborg) or for living too exclusively in and for it (Montaigne, Shakespeare, Napoleon). The effort to reconcile mind and matter has been abandoned. Emerson ends Representative Men just where he began it, in the spiritual limbo of "Experience" and with the call for a res- olution he himself has been unable to provide: "We too must write Bibles, to unite again the heavens and the earth" (CW, 4:166). The bible Emerson himself would aspire toward in the late 1840s and 1850s was essentially a recapitulation of his old bible of the 1830s. Between his lecture hall delivery of "Representa- tive Men" and its publication as a book, Emerson gave a series of talks in London in 1848 titled Mind and Manners of the Nineteenth Century, the first three of which - "The Powers and Laws of Thought," "The Relation of Intellect to Natural Sci- ence," and "The Tendencies and Duties of Men of Thought" - he viewed as comprising "a course on the 'Natural History of the Intellect'" (LL, 1:130). Modeling himself, he says, on the disinterested observation of the naturalist, Emerson envisions a "science of Intellect" commensurate in authority with the physical scientist's (LL, 1:132, 139). After more than a decade he has returned to the subject of "The Humanity of Science" 66 As Emerson told Thomas Carlyle years earlier, Goethe's "bad morals" offended "the Puritan" in him, a view Emerson continued to harbor (Emerson to Carlyle, 20 November 1834, The Correspondence of Emerson and Carlyle, ed. Joseph Slater [New York: Columbia University Press, 1964], p. 107).</page><page sequence="41">EMERSON AND GODLESS RELIGION 613 (a lecture he repeated in England) but with a heightened im- patience with scientific facts (an "already unmanageable mass of experience"), scientific method, and scientific neglect of the "laws of the world" that underlie the various disciplines and govern all human activity ( LL , 1:138, 137). The aim of his al- ternative science will be the "translation" of material facts and principles into "an universal cipher, which will be found to be rules of the intellect, and rules of moral practice" (LL, 1:138). What follows from this is another exercise in analogizing, or what editor James Elliot Cabot aptly called "anecdotes of the spirit."67 Phenomenon A (mental) is capable of being described in the language of phenomenon B (physical), therefore the two intrinsically correspond and "spring from one root" (LL, 1:55). The mind can be said to go through stages of "germination," "growth," "crossings, blights, [and] parasites," just like plants; "under [its] every thought, is a newer thought," as "under ev- ery leaf, is the bud of a new leaf'; chemical particles relate to each other by affinity," as do thoughts; "the contagious influ- ence of chemical action" resembles the "contagious" character of "the moral states of men"; and so on (LL, 1:139, 158-59). It is hardly surprising that Emerson's model for mental activity should not be the naturalist, as in "The Humanity of Science," or the intellectual classifier, as in "The American Scholar," but the poet, whose "act of Imagination" is the channel to the "ethereal currents" of the universe and whose employment of "a good symbol or image ... is worth more than any argument" (LL, 1:162, 163). It is hard to account for Emerson's backsliding within stan- dard interpretations of his career - his movement from Tran- scendental optimism to an awareness of limitations or from early idealism to mid-career pragmatism. No reader given un- dated copies of the Intellect lectures would place them where they belong. Has Emerson forgotten or suppressed the trajec- tory of his thought? Stalled in his efforts to synthesize idea and fact, was he intellectually temporizing even as celebrity 67 James Elliot Cabot, preface to Natural History of the Intellect, quoted in LL, 2:45-</page><page sequence="42">6I4 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY made increasing demands on him? His editors speak of '"Ralph Waldo Emerson'" as a "public persona he both adopted and was forced into by his audiences" ( LL , i:xviii). This may have been especially the case in 1848 as he presented himself to the British public and, wanting fresh ideas, found it convenient to don the vestments of "Emerson" and meet the expectations of a Transcendental occasion. Alternatively, was Emerson liv- ing on the remembrance of past vision as it imprinted itself on him, bound him to phrases like "the moral sentiment," and foreclosed the kind of forward experimentation he celebrated in "Circles"? "Well it took you up, &amp; showed you something to the purpose; that there was something there," he recalled wist- fully in 1852. "Look, look, old mole! there, straight up before you, is the magnificent Sun. If only for a second, you see it."68 The after-image of that second would persist through decades. The Conduct of Life ( i860) is Emerson's last concerted at- tempt to heal the breach between mind and world and reformu- late a godless religion in light of his subsequent experiences and ideas. The book opens in "Fate" with a confession of befuddle- ment reminiscent of "The Method of Nature": "We are incom- petent to solve the times. Our geometry cannot span the huge orbits of the prevailing ideas, behold their return and reconcile their opposition."®9 Nor, he says, can we reconcile "the im- movable limitations" imposed by "Fate, or laws of the world," with the "liberty" and "significance of the individual" felt in- stinctively by the mind (W, 6:3, 4). Despite such disclaimers, it seems unlikely that Emerson's book will not undertake to re- solve these problems. Its declared subject, at any rate, is moral: how best to conduct ourselves in the face of them (W, 6:3). In contrast to the ethereality of the Intellect lectures, The Conduct of Life deals graphically with violence, pain, tragedy, and at least short-term cosmic indifference. Nature's "grinding economy" from "The Young American" (CW, 1:231) reasserts itself in "Fate" in the tyrannies of biological life: outwardly, 68 Emerson in His Journals, ed. Joel Porte (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982), p. 436. 69 Ralph Waldo Emerson, The Conduct of Life, vol. 6 of Complete Works ( Centenary Edition) (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1904), p. 3.

The universe in "Fate" is as vast and manifold in purpose as that in "The Method of Nature," but its "ecstasy" has become "ferocity," mirroring (and perhaps engendering) the "trace of ferocity" in the economic system (CW, 1:126; W, 6:8, 65). That Emer- son can nonetheless call nature a "terrific benefactor" indicates some grand "counter-statement" to come that will "make all square" (W, 6:8, 202). His more immediate counter-statement in "Fate" - "Intellect annuls Fate. So far as a man thinks, he is free" (W, 6:23) - has a twofold application. On a practical level, it refers to science's progressive dominion over nature, which converts "every jet of chaos which threatens to exterminate us . . . into wholesome force" (W, 6:32); on a philosophical level, it calls for a depersonalized lucidity that "throws us on the party and interest of the Universe, against all and sundry; against ourselves as much as others" (W, 6:25-26). Walls sees the Emerson of this period as "no longer stalled on the bewildering staircase of 'Experience'" and able to "look ahead to continued ascent up the ladder of destiny."70 If so, he has traveled light and left the baggage of his humanity on the bottom rung. The gospel that "he who sees through the design, presides over it, and must will that which must be" (W, 6:27) is affirmed at a fearful human cost. As if to test the reader's mettle and his own, Emerson makes the "Beautiful Necessity" we are asked to worship as imbeautiful as possible: "The whole circle of animal life - tooth against tooth, devouring war, war for food, a yelp of pain and a grunt of triumph, until at last the whole menagerie, the whole chemical mass is mellowed and re- fined for higher uses - pleases at a sufficient perspective" (W, 6:48, 36). Who can live at such a remove, or want to? Emerson takes perceptible satisfaction in citing universal prédation, then neutralizing its horrors from an Olympian height, but in fact he is struggling to reconcile three phenomena - cosmic unity, moral law, and lived experience - that can be joined only in 70 Walls, Emerson's Life in Science, p. 175.</page><page sequence="44">6i6 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY pairs: 1) cosmic unity and moral law only by ignoring the visi- ble brutality of experience; 2) cosmic unity and experience only with the sacrifice of moral law; and 3) moral law and experi- ence only by constructing a human ethics against, rather than on the basis of, the workings of nature. "Melioration" is the key to Emerson's attempted synthesis, but the belief that things are getting better and will ultimately be best exacts the concession that they are imperfect now and that the misfortune of human beings is to inhabit the world before it is ready to answer to their needs. Emerson has come to terms with nature's inhos- pitality by reframing the traditional argument from design as an evolutionary one that conceives natural evil as "good in the making" (W, 6:35), which is to say, good is not yet. Bleak and austere as it is, Emerson's faith has an integrity, like Calvinism; it does not deny unpleasant facts, offer bro- mides for pain, or claim that all goes well, only that it goes as well as it can go in this middling stage of evolution. This is the Emerson whose grim affinity with postbellum Darwinists and Social Darwinists is spiritualized by a confidence in benign teleology and soothed (for the individual who can manage it) by a willingness to "rally on his relation to the Universe, which his ruin benefits" (W, 6:47). Yet Emerson cannot or will not let go of earlier belief; he would have a pitiless evolutionary universe and he would have omnipresent moral law. Tough- minded in its opening chapters ("Fate," "Power," "Wealth"), The Conduct of Life becomes increasingly tender-minded as it unfolds. The chapter "Worship" (the sixth of nine) is the pivot on which the book turns. "A just thinker will allow full swing to his skepticism" (W, 6:201), Emerson writes as he prepares to reel his book safely in with the "counter-statement" that has lain in waiting all along (W, 6:202). "Skepticism" recalls "Montaigne, or the Skeptic" in Representative Men, and in the progression of its argument "Worship" amounts to a reiteration of the earlier essay. Its turnabout line, "We are born believ- ing," echoes "We are natural believers" in "Montaigne" (W, 6:201; CW, 4:96), after which both essays move to affirm that "against all appearances the nature of things works for truth and right forever" (W, 6:219; CW, 4:104). In time, Emerson</page><page sequence="45">EMERSON AND GODLESS RELIGION 617 says, history will vindicate this leap of faith; meanwhile, dur- ing the transition state between the lingering old religion (now unbelievable) and the religion to come, we must rely on our in- tuition of those abiding "'moral'" and "'spiritual'" laws, which, "be they seen or unseen, pervade and govern" everything (W, 6:207, 214&gt; 215)- In his faith (or is it denial?), Emerson re- sembles Einstein in his attitude toward quantum mechanics. "Even as experience repeatedly showed quantum mechanics to be valid," his biographer notes, Einstein "remained a realist" who believed in "an objective reality . . . that existed whether or not we could observe it."71 Emerson also calls his faith in unseen order "realism" (W, 6:215). Emerson concludes "Worship" with his long-standing prophecy of "a new church founded on moral science, . . . the algebra and mathematics of ethical law" (W, 6:241). For the physical sciences - "these geologies, chemistries, astronomies" that "leave us where they found us" (W, 6:284) - he has only scorn. He is no closer than he was in "Experience" to rec- onciling what he sees with what he thinks , but with the dis- paragement of science in the penultimate chapter, "Beauty," he has effectually given over the attempt. He has ceded the realm of facts to science, or rather he will use facts selectively as they prompt speculation or otherwise furnish stones for his sermons. "No object really interests us but man," he says in "Beauty," "and in man only his superiorities; and though we are aware of a perfect law in nature, it has fascination for us only through its relation to him, or as it is rooted in the mind" (W, 6:286). Emerson has come around to a new Ptolemaism and assumed the epistemological identity of the poet. His key- word is "imagination," a faculty that shows "every thing" as potentially convertible "into every other thing" and that finds "a joy in perceiving the representative or symbolic character of a fact, which no bare fact or event can ever give" (W, 6:304). In place of science, essential in "Fate," Emerson now makes beauty "the form under which the intellect prefers to study the world" (W, 6:287). "All high beauty," he adds, "has a moral 71 Isaacson, Einstein , p. 333.</page><page sequence="46">6i8 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY element in it" (W, 6:306), so that in seeing the universe with the eye of the poet, he is able to unite the true, the beautiful, and the good. "Beauty" is so affirmative that it comes as a shock that Emer- son should close his book with "Illusions," an essay that goes far toward deconstructing it. Illusions, he says, are universal. "The child walks amid heaps of illusions," but rather than fade in the light of maturity they are replaced by later ones "in all parts of life"; "we begin low with coarse masks and rise to the most subtle and beautiful" (W, 6:312, 313, 318). Does Emerson class his own beliefs among the latter? In its focus on dreams, hallucinations, moods, and the imprisonment of the self within its own hall of mirrors, "Illusions" recalls "Experience," but now Emerson appears largely content that things should be so. "If life seems a succession of dreams," he writes, "yet poetic justice is done in dreams also" (W, 6:322); perhaps it is done in dreams only. That "the intellect is stimulated by the statement of truth in a trope, and the will by clothing the laws of life in illusions" (W, 6:324) suggests that truths and laws do exist but that they become vital to us only when decked out by the poetic imagination. The seer who once beheld the laws of the universe with the immediacy of a "transparent eye-ball" (CW, 1:10) now celebrates "the structural, beneficent illusions of sen- timent and of the intellect" (W, 6:319). To the question with which his book opens, "How shall I live?" (W, 6:3), Emerson seems to offer an answer prophetic of Wallace Stevens's: "The final truth is to believe in a fiction, which you know to be a fiction, there being nothing else. The exquisite truth is to know that it is a fiction and that you believe in it willingly."72 Gods in Elysium (18 58-60) The notion of God . . . , however inferior it may be in clearness to those mathematical notions so current in mathematical phi- losophy, has at least this superiority over them, that it guarantees an ideal order that shall be permanently preserved. - William James, Pragmatism ( 1907) 72 Wallace Stevens, "Adagia," Opus Posthumous: Poems, Plays , Prose (New York: Knopf, 1957), p. 163.</page><page sequence="47">EMERSON AND GODLESS RELIGION 619 Sailing home from Europe with Emerson in 1873, Charles Eliot Norton was struck by "the limits of his mind. His op- timistic philosophy has hardened into a creed, with the usual effects of a creed in closing the avenues of truth. He can accept nothing as fact that tells against his dogma. . . . He refuses to believe in disorder or evil. Order is the absolute law; disor- der but a phenomenon; good is absolute, evil but good in the making."73 The process of closing down that Norton describes actually began much earlier, long before Emerson's faculties started to desert him, as they did about the time Norton met him. The Emerson of the late 1840s and afterwards can be lively, observant, and pithy - his 1862 essay "Thoreau" is a mas- terpiece of insight and vigorous expression - but in much of his later work he is living in a mausoleum of petrified ideas. A more relaxed, palpable Emerson appears in an address he gave in 1858 on "Country Life," the first of six lectures on "The Natural Method of Mental Philosophy." Like some of Thoreau's natural history essays of the late 1850s, the talk is a celebration of nature in and around Concord - of its climate ("the finest . . . in the world"), its topography (variegated but not unpleasantly rugged), its plants and orchards, and its status as a "middle landscape" between wild nature and the domesticated city and town (LL, 2:52, 54, 56).74 "Country Life" is a genial, unassum- ing performance until the very end, when it takes its place as a preface to Emerson's "mental philosophy." Walking with Emerson years earlier, Margaret Fuller noted his indifference to nature as nature: "he does not care for facts, except so far as the immortal essence can be distilled from them. He has little sympathy with mere life."75 Nature in "Country Life" similarly proves of interest to him "only" (a word he uses thrice in a paragraph) as it constitutes "a mirror in which man is reflected colossally" (LL, 2:66). Although "Swedenborg, or Behmen, or Plato" may have erred in fixing precisely "what rock, what sand, 73 Letters of Charles Eliot Norton, 3 vols.

In the lectures that follow, Emerson argues yet again for the "fundamental fact" of Creation, "the correspondence of the human being and the world" (LL, 2:75); he recapitulates the Intellect lectures of 1848, down to exam- ples and individual words; and he reasserts his Swedenborgian claim in Nature that "the symbolism of nature exists, because the mental series exactly tallies with the material series. And who enunciates a law of nature, enunciates a law of the mind" (LL, 2:88). "I cannot conceive of any good in a thought which ends and stagnates" (LL, 2:92), he adds, oblivious, it seems, to the extent of his own stagnation. The editors of the later lectures speak of Emerson's habit in the mid- 1840s and afterwards of shuffling the leaves of his texts, reassembling previously used material, revising old passages, interspersing new ones, and thereby producing lec- tures "incrementally" by "organizing them around discrete thoughts occasionally strung together with transitional prose" (LL, l.xxiv). Such practices may be understandable in an ag- ing lecturer much in demand and combining efficiency with spontaneity by fumbling with his papers on the lecture plat- form, speaking with pauses, and creating at least the illusion of "'thought taking form before one's very eyes'" (LL, i:xxviii), however predictable that thought might have been. Review- ers generally accommodated Emerson, treating his repetitions kindly "as part of a continuum of thought" across his career and only rarely noting, as one British critic did, that he had run out of ideas and was refurbishing old ones.76 The early Emerson would have had little patience with the repetitions of the later. "The truest state of thought rested in, becomes false," he wrote of religious illuminations in 1837: "thought is like manna, that fell out of heaven, which cannot be stored. ^Ronald A.

With few exceptions ("Fate" is one), Emerson did little philosophical gathering after the "Representative Men" lectures of 1845-46.77 As late as "Natural Religion" (1861), he was still proclaiming the underlying truth disclosed to him half a lifetime before: "The progress of religion is steadily to its identity with morals" ( LL , 2:183). In "The Genteel Tradition in American Philosophy" (1913), Santayana sketches a counter-type to the stale idealist he sees regnant in the academy, "a romantic adventurer" with "a new philosophical vista": This spirit grows; it buds and sends forth feelers, sounding the depths around for such other centres of force or life as may exist there. It has a vital momentum, but no predetermined goal. It uses its past as a stepping-stone, or rather as a diving-board, but has an absolutely fresh will at each moment to plunge this way or that into the unknown. The universe is an experiment; it is unfinished. It has no ultimate or total nature, because it has no end. It embodies no formula or statable law.?8 In substance and language, Santayana might have been re- ferring to the Emerson of "Circles"; in fact, his adventurer, at once "radically empirical and radically romantic," is William James.79 Might Emerson have become such a figure himself, one for whom the religion of his Transcendental period, en- shrined in the 1841 Essays, was merely a "diving-board" for further adventures of the mind? In "The Method of Nature," he springs forward and seems on the verge of taking a Jamesian plunge decades before James - of becoming Copernican with respect to the universe revealed by science, Ptolemaic with respect to human purposes, values, and activities. After char- acterizing religion as "a monumental chapter in the history of human egotism," James turns around and asserts that egotism 77 1 am referring to Emerson's religious and metaphysical thought, not to his in- volvement in abolition and reform or his response to the Civil War, about which much excellent work has been done. 78Santayana, "The Genteel Tradition," pp. 536-37. 79 Santayana, "The Genteel Tradition," p. 537.</page><page sequence="50">622 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY "is the one thing that fills up the measure of our concrete ac- tuality. . . . The axis of reality runs solely through the egotistic places."80 Emerson in the 1840s and afterwards felt much the same: "a great deal of God in the Universe [is] not valuable to us until we can make it up into man" (JMN, 9:208). Obliged to choose between fidelity to cosmic immensity and the usably human, Emerson, like James, chose the human. The differ- ence is that Emerson was by temperament and conviction a monist, James a pluralist - the former, in James's view, "taking the world's perfection as a necessary principle" beyond the flux of time and predetermined in its end, the latter taking it hap- pily "only as a possible terminus ad quern," dependent in great part on human efforts.81 The universe of "The Method of Na- ture," "serving innumerable ends without the least emphasis or preference to any" (CW, 1:125), is pluralistic - exhilarating to a romantic adventurer like James in its fecundity, indeterminate- ness, and possibility of "real losses and real losers,"82 frightful to the idealist Emerson for those very same reasons and for its want of a recognizably human face. A "bipolar Unity" (action and reaction; the balanced gains and losses of compensation) was necessary and fitting, in Emerson's view, but if the uni- verse were a distinct "two," "Me and it" (or Me and a plurality of its), "then is there the Alien, the Unknown, and all we have believed &amp; chanted out of our deep instinctive hope is a pretty dream" (JMN, 7:20o).83 James himself was not immune to the terrors of anarchy. The Copernican nature described by science, with its "driftings of the cosmic atoms," its "aimless weather," and its absence of any "distinguishing ultimate tendency with which it is possible to feel a sympathy," appalled him at moments nearly as much as it did Emerson.84 In the face of a universe that "may indeed ^William James, The Varieties of Religious Experience (1902) (New York: Library of America, 2010), pp. 440, 447. 81 William James, Pragmatism (1907) (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1975), P- 135. 82James, Pragmatism, p. 142. 83 Walls also discusses this passage ( Emerson's Life in Science, p. 144). 84James, The Varieties of Religious Experience, pp. 439-40.</page><page sequence="51">EMERSON AND GODLESS RELIGION 623 burn up or freeze," he, too, shows himself a wishful Ptolemaist, finding consolation in the thought of a God "still mindful of the old ideals" - whose ideals? one is tempted to ask - "and sure to bring them elsewhere to fruition." "Where [God] is," he adds, sounding remarkably like Emerson, "tragedy is only provisional and partial, and shipwreck and dissolution not the absolutely final things."85 It may be that human beings are not cut out to be thoroughgoing pluralists or Copernicans; perhaps, as James says, "this need of an eternal moral order is one of the deepest needs of our breast";86 perhaps in the end the romantic adventurer must also cling to what might turn out to be pretty dreams. In a college essay of 1821 responding to Hume's unrefuted skepticism, Emerson had taken his stand with dreams: "If this only be fact, mankind will be content to be deceived; if the system of morals which we hold to be true be a dream, it is the dream of a god reposing in Elysium; and who would desire to be awaked from the sublime deception?"87 As if to bookend his intellectual career, he concluded The Conduct of Life with something resembling another dream: "And when, by and by, for an instant, the air clears and the cloud lifts a lit- tle," we see "the gods still sitting around [us] on their thrones" (W, 6:325). As always, such a glimpse is serendipitous, im- perfect, and evanescent. In the past, however, in the Divinity School Address particularly, the glimpse had been a glimpse of something . By i860 the substance of revelation had grown hazy, and faith had attained its most distilled form, faith in faith and little more. Paradoxically, this may have been what commended Emerson to later audiences, who had only the cloudiest idea what his words meant but were moved by what Cabot called "the open vision of things spiritual across the dis- figurements of the actual" that "shone from him, unmistakable 85James, Pragmatism, p. 55; see CW, 4:105.
