<plain_text><page sequence="1">COVERING EJ What you may think you see on this month's EJ cover is a house of cards built, somewhat improbably, on a hap- hazard stack of books. And so you do. Except neither the cards nor the books are "real"-they are copies made of porcelain with overglaze transfers. As one com- mentator says, "Richard Shaw used illusionistic painting and silk-screened decals to transform this remarkably realistic three-dimensional still life. The sculpture's el- egant arrangement of ev- eryday objects is a study in tension, balance, and fragility" (Margaret Blythe Rennolds, 1988, American Art in American Museums, New York: Abrams). We admired that "ten- sion, balance, and fragility" as well as the playfulness, ambiguity, and suggestibil- ity of House of Cards #3. Precisely because of these characteristics, we thought it would be an appropriate emblem for ajournal issue de- voted, in large part, to the topics "Culture and Crit- icism" and "Classic Texts and Contemporary Readers." About the Art and the Artist House of Cards #3 is an example of what is sometimes called illusionism, "realism," Super Objects, or trompe l'oeil in art. In painting, trompe l'oeil (Fr: "deceive the eye") refers to the representation of a subject, usually a still life, with such verisimilitude that the viewer is at least momentarily deceived as to the actuality of the ob- jects depicted. One of the ancient Greeks is said to have painted grapes so realistically that birds tried to eat them. A recent exhibit of Richard Shaw's work, called "Illu- sionism in Clay," contains such incongruities as a plate of beans with bits of newspaper in it and a plate holding among other papers a copy of Whistler's Mother and a fragment of a Dear Abby column with only the word Barbie showing in the headline. About the Artist's Technique In the introduction to the catalog of the "Illusionism in Clay" exhibit, Joseph Pugliese describes Shaw's tech- nique: He produces the objects themselves through a meticulous mold-casting process. Through a process of transfer printing, he applies the precise graphic design to these porcelain "objects." But what is achieved by this elaborate deception- except a momentarily arresting tour de force? Pugliese provides one response: What comes out of all of this is a synthesis of inspira- tions resulting in fresh, curious and provocative im- ages, humorously inventive and unexpectedly sug- gestive. The classic still-life of a casual pile of books, some letters, a pipe may also be a covered jar. The house of cards so delicately poised seems balanced only for a moment. Dilapidated objects which seem gleaned from trash heaps are resurrected as awk- wardly parading anthropomorphic images. This art that exalts the most mundane objects, that invites thoughtful examination, and as Richard Shaw dem- onstrates, is "a way to make poetry." At first Shaw's technique fools the eye 'just enough so that you look harder to recognize what's really there, and to see how impeccably the sculptural image matches the familiar thing, or set of things, it represents" (Bill Berkson, March 1989, Art in America). Eventually, how- ever, his work points to the world of objects in which we live, suggesting that we observe what is around us more keenly: "By removing ordinary articles from their usual contexts, Shaw stimulates viewers to look more closely at things in their everyday world" (Jonathan L. Fairbanks and Kenworth W. Moffett, 1984, Directions in Contempo- rary American Ceramics, Boston: Museum of Fine Arts). Finally, however, the work seems to take on metaphoric significance: "As one puzzles over the books with appar- ently meaningless titles [and other such objects] one ponders their elements and what meaning the aggrega- tion of things has beyond their singular presence. At such a moment, the artist has us both optically and men- tally, and his hold is difficult to break" (Pugliese). Thus, Shaw's "realism" encourages at least three sorts of seeing: (1) we see the work; (2) we see the world it repre- sents; and (3) we "see" what it means. About Metaphor and Our Theme Such "meaning," as reader-response critics have taught us, results from the unique collaboration of each viewer with the artist. We suggest that you show your students this month's EJ cover and let them tell you what they see and what it "means." Later you might even ask them to speculate why it would have been chosen for the cover of a magazine for English teachers, especially one dealing with literature and criticism and with classics and con- temporary readers. Our experience suggests that they are likely to notice several things: The fragile house of cards is built, some- what precariously, on a casual stack of leather-bound books. The base book is entitled Pleasure Island, and an- other is STEEL BOATS Can't Sink. The playing cards, associated in our minds with chance, gaming, and "the luck of the draw," appear to be arranged in no particu- lar order. How long, they wonder, would such a house stand in the real world. In art it is preserved forever-or at least as long as the porcelain is preserved. If your students look long enough and talk about it thoughtfully enough, they are likely to find themselves contemplating both the permanence and the fragility of the arts-including the art of the book. One could even argue that the three ways of "seeing" outlined above are roughly analogous to the processes by which we respond to "representa- tional" literature. November 1989 9</page></plain_text>
