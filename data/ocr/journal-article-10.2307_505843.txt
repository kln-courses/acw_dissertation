<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeology in Israel SAMUEL R. WOLFF Excavation activity continued at an increased pace in Israel in 1991, despite political events in the region (fig. 1).1 Two hundred forty licenses, including rescue operations, were issued by the Israel Antiquities Au- thority. The construction boom in the country created many excavation opportunities, while tourist devel- opment spurred other projects. Work on tourist proj- ects such as Beit Shean, Tiberias, and Sepphoris continued while large-scale projects were begun at Akko and Caesarea. While projects initiated with tour- ist development in mind result in the conservation or restoration of the site, those excavated in front of the bulldozer are often slated for demolition. Many suc- cessful compromises were reached between the IAA and developers, resulting in the creation of several archaeological parks, for example at Pisgat Ze'ev and Shu'afat Ridge, both in North Jerusalem, and the "Wine City" in Ashkelon. In addition to their responsibilities in the field, the Conservation and Preservation of Monuments De- partment of the IAA sponsored or cosponsored two major local events. One, an international conference entitled "Akko. The Preservation of a Medieval Living City," sponsored by the IAA, served as a prelude to the development project being carried out at that site. The second, a course entitled "Conservation of Ex- cavated Sites and Materials," was presented by the Getty Conservation Institute and the IAA. The course, attended by archaeologists from various local institutions and policymakers in the IAA, succeeded in defining the responsibilities of excavators and ex- posing them to proper conservation and preservation techniques of objects and sites. The Dead Sea Scrolls received much publicity in the past year (see V. Hurowitz's contribution below). In response to critics, the IAA reported that it and three foreign authorized institutions where photo- graphs were officially deposited-Hebrew Union Col- lege, Cincinnati, the Ancient Biblical Manuscript Center at Claremont, and the Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew Studies at Yarnton-have de- cided to grant access to the photographs of the Dead Sea Scrolls. In addition the IAA, in collaboration with the editor-in-chief, has reorganized access proce- dures, increased the numbers of scholars engaged in this research project, and set a limited timetable for their assignments. The publication rights of these assignees will be observed, although further appli- cant-researchers will also be granted access to the photographs for research purposes. Egyptian diplomats have brought up the issue of the return of archaeological artifacts from Sinai that remain in Israel's possession. All archaeologists agree that the finds should be returned. Some excavators, such as Ze'ev Meshel (TAU), excavator of Qadesh Barnea, are prepared to return their finds immedi- ately, while others, including Eliezer Oren (BGU), Director of the North Sinai Survey, express the need for more time and financial aid to work up their material for publication. The Egyptians have thus far shown restraint by not demanding an immediate so- lution to this problem. In another political matter, although of a local nature, plans were announced to construct a housing complex atop the City of David, the earliest inhabited section of ancient Jerusalem and one of the most important archaeological sites in the country. Archaeologists are hopeful that the new gov- ernment will forbid any building on this site. BIBLIOGRAPHY Site and Survey Reports. Masada III: The Build- ings.

A handsome catalogue, entitled At that Time the Ca- naanites Were in the Land (Tel Aviv 1990), was written by Irit Ziffer. In addition, a special "hands-on" exhibit was mounted for the benefit of the blind featuring a special selection of archaeological objects exhibiting various forms and textures. The Bible Lands Museum, Jerusalem, created by Elie Borowski to house a portion of his impressive private collection, opened its doors to the public in April 1992. CURRENT EXCAVATIONS EPIPALAEOLITHIC Nahal Neqarot Rockshelter. A one-week excava- tion was conducted at the Nahal Neqarot rockshelter in the Central Negev (south of Maktesh Ramon), in December 1991. The excavations were directed by A. Belfer-Cohen (HU), I. Gilead (BGU), A.N. Goring- Morris (IAA), and S. Rosen (BGU), who supplied the following report: The site is strategically located on one of the up- permost, northern tributaries of Nahal Neqarot, close to one of the main passes into the nearby Maktesh Ramon. The closest permanent water sources avail- able at present are located some 5 km away to the southwest at Be'erot Oded. The rockshelter faces east, and the occupation area is permanently located in the shade. A total of some 20 m2 were collected and excavated in two areas, revealing that occupation sediments reached a depth of at least 60 cm. Lithic densities of debitage and tools were considerable throughout the sequence to bedrock and can be assigned almost ex- clusively to the Epipalaeolithic period. The flint is in pristine condition and possibilities for conjoins were noted. Preliminary field observations indicate that the bulk of the remains can be ascribed to the Ramonian entity; microliths were abundant, especially the dis- tinctive Ramon point, and many tools were made by the microburin technique. Of particular interest is the presence of quantities of scrapers on thick blades featuring "Aurignacian"-type retouch. These are quite different from most Epipalaeolithic scrapers described to date from the southern Levant and yet there can be no doubt that they form an integral part of the assemblage. At the base of the occupation a Geometric Kebaran component appears to be indi- cated by the presence of rectangles and trapezes, while the uppermost part of the sequence featured helwan lunates in one area, and large, abruptly backed lunates in the other. These may indicate the presence of small Terminal Ramonian and Late Natufian components. A single Neolithic arrowhead was also noted, in ad- dition to sparse Byzantine and bedouin remains. Other finds included numbers of marine molluscs, particularly dentalium from both the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. Several stone tools and at least one bone tool were also recovered. The faunal assemblage recovered should provide much-needed data in an area where preservation is usually poor. Charcoal was recovered in some quantity and will provide samples for dating the sequence and for identification of the species used for fuel. The successful results of this trial excavation clearly reveal the potential of the site, the only prehistoric rockshelter to have been excavated to date in the Negev. See Mitekufat Haeven 24 (1991) 164-68. The same issue contains brief reports on the 1991 seasons at Tabun Cave and Amud Cave. (Mitekufat Haeven, as of volume 24, is also known as the Journal of the Israel Prehistoric Society.) NEOLITHIC Kfar Hahoresh. Trial investigations were con- ducted at the PPNB settlement of Kfar Hahoresh in the Nazareth Hills during the summer of 1991 by Nigel Goring-Morris (IAA). He reports the following: The results revealed that the settlement extends over an area of some 6-7 dunams. The principal trench revealed a series of at least three large struc- tures with lime-plastered floors, and occupation sed- iments attaining a thickness of up to 1.5 m. One of these was excavated systematically, revealing a quad- rilateral chamber or structure at least 6 x 7 m in size. The remains of at least two other structures with plastered floors were also noted on the disturbed surface of the site. Several burial pits were discovered sealed beneath the floors of the structures in the trench sections. Two of these contained at least partially articulated human and animal remains, in one case wild cattle, in the other gazelle. In a third instance the burial pit was lined with plaster and, in addition to at least partially articulated human remains, a complete but headless gazelle and a well-preserved painted and plastered human skull were found. The latter is currently undergoing excavation and restoration at the French Archaeological Mission at Emmaus. The skull closely resembles others from Jericho, Beisamoun, Ain Gha- zal, and Tell Ramad, and lacks the lower mandible, but this is the first instance that plastered skulls have been found west of the Rift Valley. The apparent coassociation of human and animal burials has not been previously documented in contemporary con- texts. Furthermore, the fact that these are sealed be- neath plaster-floored structures may provide data</page><page sequence="5">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ISRAEL 139 concerning ritual practices and their function as foun- dation offerings. The lithic and other finds indicate that Kfar Ha- horesh was occupied during the mid-seventh millen- nium, during the PPNB period, and is probably con- temporary with the nearby site of Yiftah'el. Of partic- ular interest in the faunal assemblage are the goat remains, some of which may provide evidence for incipient domestication. The results of the preliminary investigations have thus revealed that much of the settlement indeed remains in situ, and that preservation of organic re- mains is excellent. The site provides tremendous po- tential for investigating the economic shift from purely hunter-gatherer to farming, herding, and hunting lifeways at this time, as well as previously undocumented aspects of the ritual systems employed by the occupants of this small upland settlement. See Mitekufat Haeven 24 (1991) 77-101. Brief re- ports on excavations at Ohalo and Nalial Zehora also appear in Mitekufat Haeven 24. CHALCOLITHIC Horvat 'Usa. A rescue excavation was undertaken by Nimrod Getzov (IAA) at this tell site located on the edge of the Plain of Akko, ca. 8 km east of Akko. He reports: Excavations were conducted in three areas, two on the tell (a, b) and one some 300 m east of the tell (c). Twenty-one strata were discerned, providing evi- dence for occupation in the Neolithic (including the Yarmukian phase), Chalcolithic, Early Bronze I, Mid- dle Bronze II, Late Bronze II, Late Persian, Hellenis- tic, Roman, Byzantine, and Middle Ages (Early Arabic, Crusader, Mameluke). The most significant finds were from the Early Chalcolithic (fifth millen- nium), Late Roman (third century), and Byzantine periods. Early Chalcolithic (Pottery Neolithic) rem- nants of stone pavement and buildings were found, as well as pits dug into virgin soil (fig. 2) containing sherds with red paint on a light background, dark- burnished ware, and Wadi Rabah-type ceramics. Later phases were characterized by open, thick-walled bowls with high base and tiny lug handles, and hole- mouth jars. In all phases bowrim store jars, ribbon handles, and v-shaped bowls were present, and flint sickle blades were common. Gilat. Excavations continued at Gilat in 1991 under the direction of Thomas Levy (HUC) and David Alon (IAA). Additional evidence for the interpretation of the site as a cultic sanctuary was uncovered, as re- ported by Levy: A total of 40 violin-shaped stone figurines have been discovered. Petrographically, they are made of different rock types that originate from the northern Negev, Transjordan, the Judaean mountains, and the Sinai desert. Absence of evidence for the on-site man- ufacture of these objects leads us to believe that they were brought to Gilat in their finished form. The recent excavations were also instrumental in highlighting the dynamics behind a major shift in the architectural layout of the main cult area at Gilat. The Fig. 2. Ijorvat 'Usa.

(Courtesy Hebrew Union College and the Jewish Institute of Religion, Jerusalem) site contains four major strata. During initial excava- tions, in stratum IIc/III, a rectilinear room and court- yard were found with anthropomorphic and zoomor- phic statuettes accompanied by 70 other cult-related artifacts. These statuettes represent a deep concern with herding and the fertility of herds. The motifs are especially meaningful considering that the "sec- ondary products revolution" occurred during the fourth millennium in Palestine. The stratum IIc/III architectural complex was de- stroyed. In the following stratum (IIb), the main cult buildings were shifted farther west (fig. 3). The IIb complex included two rectilinear buildings associated with a plaza and large hearth, a large (4 m diam.) circular platform, two concave collecting basins lined with mudbrick, and storage silos. These were all bounded by a rectilinear room and courtyard unit where a large violin-shaped figurine fragment was found. One of the highlights of the 1991 excavation was the discovery of the earliest Levantine dog burial in its own individual plot. Two dogs were buried in a shallow pot deep in stratum IIIb. One of the skeletons was completely articulated and the other consisted of only the skull and mandible. The articulated dog was carefully placed on its right side with the front paws slightly extended and crossed and the tail tucked between its back legs. Especially noteworthy is an exquisite cylindrical ceramic jar placed as a burial offering near the dog's hind legs. The importance of the Gilat dog is highlighted by ancient Near Eastern archaeological data and by com- parison of the dog with 30 human burials found in the sanctuary. Of the human interments at Gilat, only one had a burial offering. This emphasizes the special treatment awarded the dog. Intentional dog burials at Gilat may anticipate the more advanced dog cults associated with healing in the ancient world. Ramot Nof (Beersheva). A rescue excavation was conducted by P. Nahshoni and J. Ustinov on behalf of the IAA in an area situated on the northern out- skirts of modern Beersheva. They report: Seven areas were excavated, of which four (A, C, F, and G) yielded remains of buildings and pits that relate to an agricultural settlement in the area from the time of the British Mandate. The agricultural character of the Late Byzantine remains, which in- clude walls and cisterns (areas D, E, and G), is similar to that of the Mandate period. In area B, which was unfortunately damaged by building activity, 12 pits containing material from the Besor phase of the Chal- colithic period (for which see I. Gilead in Levant 22 [1990] 60-62) were excavated. The pits, whose di- ameters ranged from 1.0 to 1.8 m and depth from 0.50 to 1.80 m, were dug into the natural loessic soil. The assemblage consisted of holemouth jars, storage</page><page sequence="7">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ISRAEL 141 jars, flint cores, tools and debitage, and a chalk violin figurine. This is the first site in the Beersheva region where finds from the Besor phase have been identi- fied. Tell Abu-Matar (Beersheva). Isaac Gilead (BGU), Steven Rosen (BGU), and Peter Fabian (IAA) report on salvage excavations conducted in the winter of 1991 at the site of Tell Abu-Matar in the Haserim neighborhood, a new building project in western Beer- sheva, on the northern bank of Nahal Beersheva: Tell Abu-Matar was the first of the Beersheva Chal- colithic sites excavated by Jean Perrot in the early 1950s. Those excavations revealed a concentration of underground structures and poor remains of above- ground stone walls. The goal of the salvage excava- tions was to check the areal extent of the Chalcolithic site and possible other remains in order to determine whether the site could be released for building devel- opment. Systematic excavations were opened in three fields (A, B, and M) and sections were mechanically cut where there were no surface remains. The Chalcolithic assemblages are located in areas A (near Perrot's excavation) and M. Excavations in area A yielded a relatively large number of wall sec- tions and an installation for copper processing with an oven, numerous pieces of slag, fragments of cru- cibles, and a few pieces of copper ore. Approximately 3 m west of the oven was a concentration of artifacts, probably utensils for copper processing. In area M, remains of stone and brick walls, pits, copper ores, and rich ceramic and lithic assemblages were found. The preliminary results are summarized as follows: 1) The settlement, i.e., underground structures, pits, and remains of stone and brick walls, covered an area of at least 15 dunams. The complex of underground structures uncovered by Perrot was an important component of the site, perhaps a central component; however, the site is also comprised of other compo- nents of a different nature. 2) There is more than one phase of aboveground construction, but there is no evidence to indicate that these constructions are, as a rule, later than the underground structures. In general, it is not possible to construct an overall strat- igraphic framework for all parts of the site. Occupa- tion phases observable in one part of the site are not readily linked to other parts. 3) In spite of the limited nature of the exposures, a relatively large number of walls were discovered. It is especially important to note that some were mudbrick walls without stone foundations. This suggests that above-surface dwell- ings may have been much more widespread than originally thought. 4) The remains of the Chalcolithic period, especially the walls of the houses, were dam- aged by intensive occupation in later periods. This must be considered in any attempt to define the size and nature of the site. A preliminary report was published in Mitekufat Haeven 24 (1991) 173-79. EARLY BRONZE AGE Tell Yaqush. The second season of excavations was conducted by Douglas Esse (University of Chicago) in 1991. He reports: The excavation focused on exposing more of a large EB III building complex and investigating the extent and nature of the EB I occupation of the site. It now appears that the EB I settlement is the largest on the site. The EB III is restricted to the southern slope of the site. Several areas were opened on the summit of the tell where burnt mudbricks had been noticed on the surface. Excavations revealed late EB I architec- ture with rounded corners, and numerous restorable vessels. The EB III building complex also contained many restorable vessels and small finds. Among the notable finds were a number of EB III miniature votive vessels, animal figures, and a seal impression. The stratified ceramic finds included all types of Grain-Wash ware (EB I), metallic, and Khir- bet Kerak wares (EB III). Large numbers of flint blades, stone bowl fragments, groundstone tools, and animal bones were recovered. Heavy- and light-frac- tion samples were also recovered by flotation. These data continue to underline the agricultural nature of the site's subsistence base. For a brief report on the results of the first season see The Oriental Institute Annual Report 1988-1989 (1990) 27-31 and Excavations and Surveys in Israel (ESI) 9 (1989-1990) 113. Horvat 'lllin (Lower). Eliot Braun (IAA) reports on a rescue excavation of a late prehistoric settlement threatened by modern development of the town of Beth Shemesh: Six principal strata were encountered within ap- proximately 1,650 m2 of exposure of the terraced, western slope of this ridge, the easternmost and high- est of the rolling hills of the Shephela. The top two strata (I-II) consist of stone constructions that prob- ably functioned as terrace walls. The first evidence of true settlement, dating to the late EB I period, was encountered in stratum III (fig. 4). The remains of several complex structures of rectilinear aspect were revealed. Typically, external corners of these build- ings were rounded within and without. Other com- mon EB architectural features encountered in the stratum III constructions include broadroom cham- bers, steps leading down to sunken floor levels, inter- nal benches lining walls, sunken stone-lined basins, and the use of large flat stones as pillar bases.

Nissanim. A second season of excavation took place in September 1991, directed by Ram Gophna (TAU) and Yuval Yekutieli (BGU). They report: A total of 80 m2 has been excavated to date. Four EBA strata (2-5) were distinguished under the sur- face layer (stratum 1). From stratum 2, dating to EB III, a floor and a large pit were uncovered in area A. Stratum 3, dating to EB IA, consisted of piles of stones that were used in some way. In addition, the burials from the 1989 season, previously assumed to belong to stratum 2, are now assigned to stratum 3. A stone wall, 1.10 m wide, and the floors adjacent to it belong to stratum 4, also dating to EB IA. To stratum 5, dating to the beginning of EB IA, belongs a floor covered with sherds, flint, animal bones, stones, and partially burnt bricks, as well as two pits excavated in 1989. MIDDLE BRONZE AGE Tel Dan. Avraham Biran (HUC) supplied the fol- lowing report: Investigations of the stone structure uncovered in previous seasons at the northern section of the site were continued in 1991. The stone fill between the buttresses ends in a wall 2 m high. At its foot is a surface of basalt chips. Under this surface a wall built of 10 courses of basalt boulders was uncovered. It is 2.06 m high and 3 m of its length was exposed. At the base of the wall is a cobbled surface below which is a fill of basalt boulders sloping northward. A few EBA sherds were found in this fill. The layers of earth forming the MBA ramparts were laid over the com- plex stone construction. If, as is possible, sections of the stone construction predate the layers of earth, these may represent the remains of the EBA fortifi- cations. See A. Biran, Dan. 25 Years of Excavations at Tel Dan (Jerusalem 1992). Nahal Zimri (North Jerusalem). Yitzhak Meitlis (IAA) reports on one of several salvage excavations conducted near Pisgat Ze'ev, a northern Jerusalem neighborhood: Under the Iron Age II and Byzantine terraces (see below), a Middle Bronze Age settlement was revealed. The size of the settlement, probably founded in the beginning of the 17th century, is estimated at ca. 4 acres, although most of it was not excavated. Exca- vations concentrated on the upper part of the settle- ment. In area B, the southernmost of the four excavated areas, shaft tombs typical of the Intermediate Bronze Age were excavated. These tombs were already emp-</page><page sequence="9">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ISRAEL 143 tied, probably in the Iron Age. Near the tombs a number of "cup-marks" were cut into the bedrock. A large public building, ca. 400 m2 in area, was excavated in area C. It was subdivided into nine rooms, some of which were hewn out of bedrock and some built of stone. Although such structures are known in public buildings of the period, this is the only one of its kind known from an agricultural set- tlement. In area C1 a complex of rooms from the Intermediate Bronze Age was excavated, above which MB II rooms were built. Remains from area D include an MB II room in which a tabun, cooking pot fragments, and animal bones were found. North of this structure a curved wall ca. 25 m in length was excavated. This wall, which was in use during the Intermediate Bronze Age and the MB II, may have been used for an animal pen. The artifacts include large quantities of ceramic ves- sels, including a high-quality Tell el-Yehudiyeh ware juglet. The ceramic assemblage from Nahal Zimri is paralleled by many known assemblages from the cen- tral hill country. The pottery and 14C analyses show that the site continued until the first half of the 16th century. Petrographic analysis revealed that the ceramic vessels were produced in this mountainous region. No im- ported wares were found. In addition to ceramics, stone vessels and flint sickle blades point to the agri- cultural nature of the settlement. Bones of goat and sheep, with fewer cattle and pig, suggest that these animals were part of the inhabitants' diet. A few frag- ments of worked bone were also recovered. No evidence of violent destruction was discerned at the site. The settlement appears to have been aban- doned in an orderly fashion, perhaps for reasons of security or economic hardship. LATE BRONZE AGE/IRON AGE Hazor. Amnon Ben-Tor (HU) reports on the 1991 season at Hazor, sponsored by Hebrew University, the Israel Exploration Society, Complutense University of Madrid, and Ambassador College of Pasadena, Cali- fornia: The excavation of the two main areas opened in the upper city in the first season (1990) was continued and expanded upon. The investigation of the ceme- tery located to the east of the site was completed. Remnants of the Israelite period of occupation were unearthed in the upper city. These include the city wall, constructed in the ninth century, most probably under the reign of King Ahab, as well as dwellings built parallel to it. Two phases of destruction, char- acterized by evidence of intense fire and a thick layer of collapsed debris, were discerned. The earlier de- struction was probably caused by the earthquake men- tioned in the Bible (Amos 1.1) that occurred during the reign of Jeroboam II. The second destruction is most probably the one caused by the Assyrian con- quest of the northern part of the Kingdom of Israel, including the city of Hazor, in 732 (2 Kings 15.29). Remnants of occupation dating to the Israelite pe- riod, as well as to the Middle Canaanite period, were encountered in the trial excavation conducted by us to the east and outside of the fortified confines of the city of Hazor. The most remarkable discovery in this area was a small cemetery, dating to the ninth-eighth centuries, comprising some 25 burials. The deceased were all cremated and their ashes and bone remnants were placed in various types of clay vessels and in- terred. The location of each burial was marked by a small, uncut tombstone. Small burial gifts such as arrowheads, beads, and the like were placed with the deceased. A preliminary study of the bone remnants indicates the interred included men, women, and chil- dren. We are at present unable to answer the most interesting question, namely, that of the relationship between the buried population and the inhabitants on the tell. Were the deceased part of the general pop- ulation of Hazor? Did they belong to a separate group? Were they complete strangers? During the 1991 season we also uncovered, in the upper city, remains dating to the Late Canaanite pe- riod of occupation. These were encountered in an area that was unoccupied during the Israelite period. Part of a large building with massive walls built of mudbrick was cleared. The plan and function of this structure have yet to be determined. It is evident, however, that we are dealing with a public building. A number of huge, complete storage jars (fig. 5) were uncovered under a thick layer of ash and debris, indicating a sudden and violent destruction. This ca- tastrophe represents, most probably, the final destruc- tion of Canaanite Hazor, dated to the 13th century. The scope, date, and exact cause of this event are of great interest to archaeologists as well as historians and biblical scholars, since it may very well represent the conquest by the settling Israelites (Josh. 11.14). The single most important find of the 1991 season was a small inscribed clay tablet dating to the first half of the second millennium. The deciphering of this document has only begun, but it is already evident that it deals with economic matters. Many of the doc- uments uncovered in the contemporary archive of the city of Mari, on the Euphrates, deal with economic/ commercial matters, and several of the Mari docu- ments indicate the far-reaching economic activity of Hazor. The newly discovered tablet from Hazor may represent the Canaanite side of that correspondence.</page><page sequence="10">144 SAMUEL R. WOLFF [AJA 97 Fig. 5. Hazor. Pithoi inside a public building of the Late Canaanite period. (Courtesy Hebrew University Institute of Archaeology) Since the excavation in the '50s and '60s conducted by Y. Yadin, the presence of a royal archive at Hazor has been considered highly probable. The tablet dis- covered during the 1991 season may very well belong to such an archive, which we hope to uncover in future seasons. IRON AGE Tel Dan. A. Biran (HUC) reports: Excavations in the central area brought to light considerably more information about the site follow- ing the Assyrian conquest. Two Iron Age phases from the end of the eighth to the beginning of the sixth century were identified in two domestic structures separated by a cobbled alley. The stone walls are flat- topped and in some places the outline of the mudbrick superstructures was found. The cosmopolitan assem- blage of pottery vessels included storage jars, cooking pots, and one special trumpet-based krater. Also un- covered were additional sections of the eighth-century flagstone piazza. Another stamped jar handle with the name "Immadi-yo"-meaning "God is with me"-was found. This is the third Immadi-yo handle discovered at Dan. Tel Dor. Ephraim Stern (HU) reports: Three areas were excavated in the 1991 season at Tel Dor, one in the center of the mound and two on the eastern side. In the central area, strata from the late 11th and 10th centuries were excavated, reaching the city of the Sea Peoples (the Sikils), which was covered by a heavy destruction layer. On the eastern side of the mound, excavations continued to uncover the wide stone-paved passageway leading from the outer gate to the inner one of the Israelite Kingdom period (fig. 6). The first remains of the outer gate itself were discovered. In the second eastern area, the Roman barracks located near the eastern gate were cleared. Nearby, a pit was found containing over 150 ballista stones, some of which were inscribed with numbers indicating their weight. Of the season's finds, mention should be made of the rare 11th-century Cypriot vases and cylinder seals (e.g., fig. 7), bichrome "Philistine" pottery sherds, and a rhyton from the Persian period.

Shlomo Bunimovitz (Bar Ilan University) and Zvi Lederman (Harvard University) report on the second season of excavations (1991) sponsored by Bar-Ilan University: The most outstanding and intriguing find of this season has been a complex system of huge fortifica- tions exposed in area C, a new trench 3 X 30 m cut down to bedrock by a bulldozer into the tell's north- eastern shoulder. More than 10 m back from the tell's edge, a massive wall built of four stepped courses of large boulders has been exposed across the trench. This wall, founded on a ledge of bedrock, seems to concur with D.

In order to con- firm this conclusion a tunnel, one of Mackenzie's un- derground tunnels by which he investigated the site's fortifications, was unearthed along the outer face of the wall. Surprisingly, a short distance behind Mac- kenzie's wall a second wall and a bastion built of large flat stones founded on huge boulders were discovered (fig. 8). A fill sealed by a sloping sterile layer of white chalk was found between the two walls. Obviously the lower wall served as a revetment for the upper line of fortifications. The only way to reconcile all this new information with Mackenzie's own observations con- cerning his Strong Wall is to assume that he erro- neously joined the two lines of fortifications into one, presented in his plans. This intriguing assumption will be examined in the near future by studying Mac- kenzie's field diaries in the PEF archive, and by reex- cavating a few remnants of the wall near the South Gate and at the eastern slope of the site. Although the chronology and history of each element within the defense system revealed in the 1991 season need ... . .. tow "0 0, 1 Fig. 7. Tel Dor.

Iron Age II upper wall and bastion in area C. further study, it is already clear that during Iron Age II Beth Shemesh was defended by far more impres- sive and complex fortifications than previous exca- vations led us to believe. Similar fortification systems comprised of an upper wall, glacis, and a lower re- vetment are known from other Judahite cities, e.g., Lachish, Timnah (Tel Batash), and Tel Halif, dated to the eighth century. In order to learn more about Iron Age II town planning at the northern confines of Beth Shemesh, the southern part of area A (the main stratigraphic section) was enlarged. As it turned out, most of the remains belonging to the upper eighth-century town in this new excavation area (area B) had been washed down the slope of the tell. However, a spacious 10th- 9th century building, probably of a public function, was discovered (fig. 9). The building, of which only a part has been exposed as yet, is characterized by thick stone foundations for its brick walls, impressive plas- tered or flagstone-paved floors, and rows of heavy stone monoliths. Careful analysis proved the contin- ual use of this building up to the town's final destruc- tion. The importance of this observation, which adds credibility to similar observations by the Haverford College expedition at other buildings at the site, ex- tends beyond Beth Shemesh. It may supply an ade- quate explanation for the elusiveness of the ninth century in many Judahite sites by pointing to unbro- A$kA Im- Fig. 9. Tel Beth Shemesh.

Grain silos in area A. ken settlement continuity as the main reason for the alleged ninth-century "hiatuses" at these sites. Work at the main stratigraphic section, area A, concentrated this season in exposing more of the 12th-century building discovered in 1990. It is clear now that this large building had an impressive eastern entrance that led into an open court where a few fireplaces were found. The adjacent room was beau- tifully paved with large river pebbles, much worn and shiny from traffic. Next to this room an intriguing flat stone was found standing on its short side within a circle of small stones, probably a cultic masebah ("standing stone"). The heavy destruction wrought on this building seems to be identical with Mackenzie's "Red Burnt Stratum" of the early Iron Age and with the destruction in stratum II identified by the Hay- erford College expedition. The present expedition, however, would date this destruction to the end of the 12th or the beginning of the 11th century, earlier than suggested by both former excavators of the site. Nahal Zimri (North Jerusalem). Yitzhak Meitlis (IAA) supplied the following report: A farmstead from the seventh century was exca- vated for three seasons in Nah.al Zimri, north of Je- rusalem. This type of farmstead is referred to in the Bible as a hyr (Lev. 25.31). The farm is comprised of three main elements: the house, water source, and winepress with tower. The four-room house is unique in that its floors and walls were hewn from bedrock (area B). A cave under the northern part of the house was used for storage space in the early phase and was sealed over in the house's later (main) phase. The ceramics from the two phases were identical. Half of the vessels were storage jars, probably indicative of the inhabitants' needs. The water supply was fed by a channel that diverted water from the slope into a pool, which in turn drained into a large cistern. Near the water supply was a terrace wall. The winepress and small tower were discovered in area H. The winepress was reused in the Byzantine period when it was covered with a white mosaic floor. Nahal Yattir. The site is located on the west bank of Nalhial Yattir, ca. 10 km east of modern Beersheva. The size of the site is estimated to be 45 dunams. Excavations have been carried out annually since 1986 under the direction of Yehuda Govrin (IAA) and Steven Derfier (Hamline University). Four areas have been excavated. In area A, five stone-lined storage silos (fig. 10), each averaging ca. 2 m in diameter and 1.5-2.0 m in depth, were excavated in 1990 along with three buildings (one building was excavated in a previous season). In one building five clay loom -..Mmgmm 1 ,l0* Fig. 11. Nalhal Yattir. Limestone amulet of Egyptian god Thoth.</page><page sequence="14">148 SAMUEL R.

In the other building a stone- lined silo with a corbeled roof was discovered in a corner of the courtyard. In area B, a four-unit house was excavated in 1990 and 1991. It is similar in plan to one found in a previous season in area D. The ceramic finds date to the 10th century. Also found were stone spindle whorls, loom weights, hammerstones, grinding stones, and a limestone amulet of the Egyptian god Thoth, the baboon god of wisdom and science (fig. 11). The main feature in area C is the fortified Persian-period structure whose plan has much in common with that of Persian fortresses of the type found in the Negev highlands, along the route connecting Qadesh Barnea and Arad. The excavators identify the site with Moladah, which is mentioned in the Bible as a town in the inheritance of Simeon (Josh. 19.2; 1 Chron. 4.28) and as one of the Negev towns to which the Jews returned from the Babylonian exile (Neh. 11.26). For a summary of the first three seasons' work see Atiqot 20 (1991) 13*-23*, in Hebrew with English summary (178-79). IRON AGE II-EARLY ROMAN Har Mispe Yamim. Rafael Frankel (HU) reports the following: The finds from Har Mispe Yamim illustrate the character of a Phoenician temple of the Persian and Hellenistic periods, and shed some light on the cult practiced. The temple is part of what was probably a sanctified compound (fig. 12) on the peak of a moun- tain spur from which there is a remarkable view. The temple consists of two rooms. The entrance is in the north wall of the main hall in which there are three simple pillar bases and two altars. One altar originally B Fig. 13. Har Migpe Yamim.

(Courtesy Israel Museum) had three steps that were later filled in and covered with a stone slab, perhaps implying that sacrifices replaced offerings on the altar. The main finds were large numbers of juglets and bottles, many whole but others clearly brought to the temple broken and often lacking the rim or even consisting of a base only. While the larger storage jars were of a distinctive local ware, the juglets and bottles were of wares found at sites in the Jezreel Valley and the coastal plain, suggesting that they were brought by worshippers from afar. Some sheep/goat skulls were found in the floor of the temple but most of the animal bones found in and around the temple were broken into small pieces (ca. 10,000 fragments). Of those definable bones, 94.2% were sheep/goat, 5.6% cattle, and 0.2% pig. Among the finds were bronze ornaments, a large iron circlet, and several fine bronzes: an Egyptian situla on which was engraved a Phoenician votive inscription to Ashtoreth, suggesting that she was the deity worshipped at the site (fig. 13); a couchant ram (fig. 14); a pouncing lion cub (fig. 15); and an Apis bull (fig. 16). These objects, together with a slate Fig. 17. Har Mispe Yamim. Slate statuette of Osirus, Horus, and Isis. (Courtesy Israel Museum) statuette of Osirus, Horus, and Isis (fig. 17) found near the altar, were probably votive offerings and not objects of worship. Pisgat Ze'ev D-Mesudat HaGeula (North Jeru- salem). Yonatan Nadelman (IAA) reports on the ex- cavation in 1990 of a fortified compound that was occupied continuously from the seventh century to the time of Vespasian: The seventh-century site was probably a rural farm- site that provided food for nearby Jerusalem. The site continued to be inhabited (cf. Jer. 39.10; 40.12) after the Babylonian destruction of Jerusalem in 586 and the subsequent exile of Judah's population to Baby- lon. Pottery types and fabrics represent a clear con- tinuity and development from the pre-exilic period. The region was resettled in the Persian period (Ezra 2.23-24; Neh. 7.27-28, 12.29). The major construc- tion activity revealed at the site was from this period (late sixth-fifth centuries). A well-constructed road ran along the northern wall to a simple gate. Casemate walls enclosed a compound ca. 1 acre in area (ca. 70 X 60 m). Within the compound a hewn treading floor and collection vat attest to local wine production.

Decorated front of ossuary no. 6. (Courtesy Israel Antiquities Authority) tiny fourth-century silver coins were recovered, one with an owl and "yhd" imprinted on it, the other with a winged lynx and the name "yl.hzqyh," a governor of the province. An extensive settlement from the last century of the Second Temple period was uncovered, continuing the earlier Hasmonean phase. The original casemate wall of the Persian period was still in use. The most impressive architectural features are the remains of two collapsed vaulted ceilings made of carefully cut and dressed stone. Significant remains of hewn bed- rock for floors and walls attest to the skill of the stonemasons in coping with hillside construction. The finds from this period are local in character. Remains of scores of chalk stone vessels may point to the exis- tence of a factory at the site. Their importance in Jewish ritual purity surely hints at the concerns of the compound's population. One coin from the fourth and final year of the FirstJewish Revolt was recovered (69/70). The destruction of the site is attributed to the Roman conquest of 70. The site was abandoned until a lime pit was con- structed above the earlier ruins, probably to be related to the nearby sixth-century monastery (Pisgat Ze'ev C, see Hadashot Arkheologiyot 97 [1991] 60-62, in Hebrew). The site and the nearby monastery were badly disturbed following the Arab conquest. EARLY ROMAN Shalom Forest (Jerusalem). In November 1990, Zvi Greenhut (IAA) excavated an important tomb in the East Talpiot neighborhood of southern Jerusa- lem. The tomb was a typical Second Temple tomb with kokhim, or niches that held burial ossuaries. Twelve ossuaries were recovered, six of which were complete. Several of the ossuaries bore carved deco- rations and inscriptions (figs. 18-19). The inscriptions read "Miriam daughter of Shim'on," "sm," "Shalom," "qp'," "Yehosep son of qp'," and "Yehosep son of qyp'." The last three inscriptions bring to mind the name of Caiaphas (18-36), mentioned by the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus and in the New Testament -Old 7SOON /"j .......... ......... Fig. 19.

Also of importance is the discovery of a coin of Agrippas I dated 42/3 in a skull that was found in the ossuary with the "Miriam daugh- ter of Shim'on" inscription. This discovery provides proof for the existence of the Greek pagan practice of placing a coin in the mouth of the deceased as a payment to Charon, the ferryman who carries the spirits of the dead across the river Styx to Tartarus. This is the only evidence for this practice to have been discovered in Jerusalem (for a parallel at Jericho see R. Hachlili and A. Killebrew, BiblArch 46 [1983] 147- 53). For the Caiaphas tomb see 'Atiqot 21 (1992) 63- 87, and Biblical Archaeology Review 18:5 (1992) 28- 44. Akeldama (Jerusalem). Gideon Avni and Zvi Greenhut (both IAA) excavated an exceptionally elab- orate Second Temple-period tomb complex on the southern flank of the valley facing the walled city, at the site of the Akeldama Monastery. Three caves were found, the entrances of caves 1 and 3 coming off of a hewn courtyard, and of cave 3 via cave 1. Cave 1 consisted of a forecourt, two burial rooms with kokhim, and an additional vaulted room flanked on three sides by burial troughs. Eight ossuaries and many glass and ceramic vessels, including lamps, were recovered from this cave, as were a few gold ringlets. Cave 2 consisted of a central burial chamber with 10 kokhim and two additional rooms found at a lower level (fig. 20). The finds from the central chamber suggest that it was first used as an ossuary in the Second Temple period and was intensively reused in the Byzantine period for wooden coffin burials. Several outstanding os- suaries and a rare stone coffin were found in room B. Cave 3 was special in its decoration and quality of its carving. It consisted of four rooms, two chambers with kokhim and a splendidly decorated passageway leading to a room where the ossuaries were collected. The walls of the passageway were decorated with carved and colored geometric patterns (fig. 21). The original burial complex apparently dates to the first century; caves 1 and 2 were reused in the Roman and Byzantine periods. See Hadashot Arkheologiyot 97 (1991) 68-71 (Hebrew). Upper Nahal Hever Cave. A natural karstic cave was recently discovered near one of the upper tribu- taries (called Wadi Qunetra) of the Nahal Hever, lo- cated in the Judaean Desert. The cave showed signs of recent robbing, prompting the IAA to organize a brief salvage excavation, directed by David Amit (IAA) and Hanan Eshel (HU) who provided the fol- lowing summary: Evidence was found for occupation in two periods, the Chalcolithic and the Bar Kokhba Revolt. From the Chalcolithic period, finds included pottery, flints, and basalt bowl fragments. Most of the finds were from the period of the Bar Kokhba rebellion (the so- called Second Revolt). They included an abundance of pottery, the majority consisting of store jars and</page><page sequence="19">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ISRAEL 153 i, ..... .......... ..................!~iii Fig. 21. Akeldama, Jerusalem. Cave 3, room C, looking toward room A. (Courtesy Israel Antiquities Authority) cooking pots. Three types of lamps were identified: Herodian, the "southern lamp," and the round Ro- man type. A rich collection of glass vessels was also recovered. The most important find was a silver te- tradrachm (fig. 22) dated to the third year of the rebellion (134/5). On the obverse the facade of the Jerusalem Temple is depicted, along with the name Shim['on], the given name of Bar-Kokhba. On the reverse are the four species--lulav (palm branch), hadas (myrtle), "araba (willow), etrog (citron)-with the inscription "of the freedom of Jerusalem." While coins of this type were previously known, this is the first one to have come from a scientific excavation. A few ostraca, mentioning the contents of the jars upon which they were written, were also discovered. The cave was most likely occupied by refugees fleeing the Judaean Mountain settlements, much like those who dwelled in caves in the lower Nalhal Hever fled from the region of En-Gedi. ROMAN-BYZANTINE Panias (Caesarea Philippi). Panias (also referred to as Banias) is situated at the foot of Mt. Hermon. Its spring issues from the cave of Pan (see below) and is one of the main sources of the Jordan River. The site is mentioned by Polybios as the location of a battle between Antiochos the Great and the Egyptians and is referred to in the New Testament (Matt. 16.13; Mark 8.27). Herod the Great built a temple to Au- gustus at Banias, according to Josephus. Herod's son Philip enlarged and beautified the city, which he re- named Caesarea Philippi. Two excavations, both sponsored by the IAA, are in the field at Panias, one directed by Vassilios Tzaferis (ESI 9 [1989-1990] 3- 4; Qadmoniot 23 [1990] 110-14, in Hebrew), the other by Zvi Ma'oz (ESI 9 [1989-1990] 85-86; Ijadashot Arkheologiyot 97 [1991] 2-4, in Hebrew), who pro- vided the following report on his most recent exca- vations at the sanctuary of Pan. Preliminary results of the excavations at the sanc- tuary of Pan indicate that this extensive cult area 8r 94 Fig. 22. Upper Nahal Hever Cave. Silver tetradrachm of Bar Kokhba, 134/5.

(Courtesy Israel Antiquities Authority) developed eastward over a few centuries by adding various structures and courts along the rock scarp at the foot of the mountain (fig. 23). In the Hellenistic period the cult was limited to the natural grotto in the west end of the area. Herod erected in front of the grotto a temple for Augustus comprising a naos and a decorated entrance to the cave that itself con- tinued to serve as the focus of the rites.

(Courtesy Israel Antiquities Authority) first century, an open-air shrine for Pan and the nymphs was constructed to the east of the Augusteum. The shrine consisted of an artificial cave housing the statue of Pan, fronted by an altar for burnt offerings. This shrine was approached by a sloping ramp from the southeast. In 148/9 two niches were added on the rock face to house statues of Echo and Hermes. A tabula ansata located to the left of one of the niches carries a mutilated inscription (fig. 24) that reads: "For Pan and the nymphs, Victor son of Lysimachos with his children dedicated a likeness in stone of Hermes child of Maia, son of Zeus, having vowed it, the year 150." To the east of this shrine another temple was erected, in the first half of the second century, prob- ably dedicated to Tyche. Above the temple's west naos wall a Greek inscription, incised into a ceramic cook- ing pot lid, was found (fig. 25). It is as yet undeci- phered. Further east a shrine for Nemesis was arranged, probably in the early third century (the Agrippas inscription of 222 provides the terminus ad quem), consisting of a rock-carved niche fronted by a paved court and approached by a street from the south (fig. 26). Later in the third or fourth century, service buildings were added to the east of the Nem- esis shrine, enclosing yet another court paved with a W.4~ !iiii~iii4 R Fig. 26. Panias.

On the pavement a few votive sculptures were found, inside a seventh-eighth century installation, including a marble statue of Hercules (Phoenician Melqart, fig. 27) and a broken limestone sculpture of the Dea Syria (Atargatis-Allat-Venus) seated between lions. The sanctuary of Pan was probably active to the end of the fifth and beginning of the sixth century, with the Augusteum finally being burned as late as the sixth century. Much fieldwork and research is still required in order to refine and elucidate the complex history, architecture, and cult of this outstanding sanctuary. Horvat 'Usa. N. Getzov reports that the Roman stratum was characterized as a potter's settlement and consisted of a large building made of ashlar stones, a potter's kiln (fig. 28), and kiln debris with amphora fragments. The potter's settlement continued into the Byzantine period. Kilns from this phase were exca- vated in 1963 by A. Ben-Tor. Sippori (Sepphoris). The Hebrew University team, directed by Ze'ev Weiss and Ehud Netzer, reports on a seventh season of excavations at $ippori: Four areas were excavated. Work in area 86.1 was intended to complete the plan of the Roman mansion that yielded Dionysiac scenes in a mosaic floor in earlier seasons. Excavations concentrated on the east- ern and southern portions of that building, yielding Fig. 28. Horvat 'Usa. Potter's kiln from the Roman period.

Detail of the mosaic with Nile scenes from a fifth-century building. two rooms, a peristyle courtyard, and a corridor paved with a mosaic with geometric patterns. After its fiery destruction, the building was revamped in the Byzan- tine period, with a miqve (ritual bath) being among the new features. These alterations disturbed the orig- inal building, which prevented the excavators from reconstructing its southern part. This later occupa- tion, which was less intensive than the previous phase, lasted until the end of the Byzantine period or per- haps into the Early Arabic period. A second area (66.1) yielded portions of a stone- paved street that possibly was bordered by columns on each side. Traces of ruts cut by wagon wheels were found in the stone. In the third area (85.5) a large Byzantine building, which may have been a ware- house or industrial zone, was uncovered. It yielded a large hall, 9.4 x 6.2 m, which was paved with a white mosaic floor and divided by a row of pillars. Large pithoi and two miniature wine amphoras were found in the fiery ruins of the hall. The fourth area of excavations (67.1) was the most impressive, producing a large fifth-century structure with six rooms, all of which were paved with mosaics. Most of the mosaics formed geometric patterns, but in one room, measuring 6 x 7 m, a "Nile Day" scene was uncovered (fig. 29). A central feature of the mo- saic is a "nilometer," a water measure used to mark the depth of the Nile, with the figures of a man standing on a kneeling woman while chiseling the height of the meter on the nilometer. Near this scene is a depiction of the personification of Egypt reclining on a fruit basket and holding a cornucopia filled with fruit. Other motifs include the Nile flowing out of the nostrils of a bull, a procession of horsemen, a figure bearing a torch, a depiction of the famous Alexan- drian lighthouse, and animal hunts. The mosaic is distinguished by the imaginativeness of its designer. Near the Nile scene another mosaic floor was found with the figure of a centaur. Excavations will be re- sumed in 1992. See Qadmoniot 24 (1991) 113-21 (Hebrew). Horvat Sumaq. Excavations continued in 1991 un- der the direction of Shimon Dar (Bar-Ilan University). He reports: Work continued in the eastern complex, located to the east of the synagogue (fig. 30). It consists of an insula of public buildings. The walls of this complex, which measures ca. 37 x 18 m, were further defined. Pottery and coins date the initial phase of the complex to the fourth and beginning of the fifth centuries. The complex was reused, with alterations, during the Middle Ages. In addition to the eastern complex, another work- shop was excavated (building 20), the fifth of its kind</page><page sequence="24">158 SAMUEL R.

The excavation was not completed. Neverthe- less, the excavator believes that this and the other buildings functioned as tannery and textile work- shops. Shuni. Shuni lies along the southeastern slopes of Mount Carmel, nestled in the valley of the Nadiv. The excavations are sponsored by the Jewish National Fund and the IAA. Eli Shenhav (Jewish National Fund) reports: Some identify the site with Shami or Shumi of the third century, as known from the published diary of the year 333 of a Christian pilgrim from Bordeaux. A small Roman theater was excavated, whose inner diameter was 20 m. The orchestra surface of the theater was found intact. It was tiled with local lime- stone pavers (0.5 x 0.3 m). A large marble slab (0.9 x 0.9 m) found in the center of the orchestra was ap- parently used as an altar. The cavea faced east, an uncommon feature in Roman theater construction. A number of water pools were excavated alongside the theater. All the pools were paved with colored mosaic floors and connected by an aqueduct that led from Umm el-Alak (Tel Sur). On the eastern side of the theater a huge semicircular swimming pool, paved with a mosaic floor, was excavated. Together with the theater this pool formed an amphitheater-like circle. A statue of Asclepius, god of healing, was also found, indicating that the site was an asclepium-a sort of Roman hospital-that served as a resort for the people of Caesarea as well as pilgrims seeking health spas and participants in the famous wild water games of Mayumas, which probably took place in the swimming pool. Other finds include the paved sacred road that led to the springs of Shuni, the tetrapylon built next to the nymphaeum, and the temple of Asclepius with its seven-column facade. The hostel for pilgrim guests was situated to the south of the temple. In the sixth century, when the tendency was to root out all remnants of idolatry that still existed, the entire complex was converted into an olive oil factory. The crushing apparatus consisting of the basin (yam) and crushing stone (memel) was found. The floor of the crushing area was paved with small stones set into silt, enabling the animal or man operating the crusher to work without slipping. Presses with weights were found on either side of the crushing installation. A double stove was attached to a press and was appar- ently used to separate the oil from the watery pulp. These olive presses are similar to the late Samaritan screw presses that were in use from the sixth century until the eighth century. See Qadmoniot 23 (1990) 58-62 (Hebrew). BYZANTINE-EARLY ISLAMIC IHIorvat Karkur 'llit. A third season of excavation was conducted at Horvat Karkur 'Illit under the di- rection of Pau Figueras (BGU). He reports: Excavations centered around the baptistry hall, the northern pastophorium, and the synthronos of the Byz- antine church complex revealed in earlier seasons. The baptistry hall is divided in two parts. The square room to the east is separated from a longer rectan-</page><page sequence="25">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ISRAEL 159 Fig. 31. IHorvat Karkur '11it.

In the center of the longer hall is the baptismal font. The northern pastophorium, the room at the northwest angle of the church building, had a pressed earth floor (65 x 50 cm) upon which crushed large amphoras were found (fig. 31). Some of these jars showed a row of purposely made small holes around their shoulders, apparently serving to release gases during the fermentation process of wine man- ufacture. Remains of three quasi-semicircular steps of a synthronos were found between the perimeter wall of the church and the place where the altar stood. The area between the synthronos and the eastern wall of the church may have been used as a storeroom. An additional tomb was discovered under the pavement of the church along the southern side of the central nave and presbytery. The total number of tombs dis- covered so far inside the church amounts to five (pos- sibly six), though only three of them have been excavated. Tell Abu-Matar (Beersheva). I. Gilead, S. Rosen, and P. Fabian report on the discovery of a monumen- tal building in area B (fig. 32): The building, at least 250 m2, is comprised of sev- eral levels. On the main level, three adjoining parallel long wings were found. A reused tombstone with a Greek inscription was discovered abutting the thresh- old between the two western rooms of the central wing. The stone derives from the tomb of a man named Sa'adalas and the date on it, according to the Beit Guvrin chronology, is 537. In addition, an incised cross was discovered on a floor slab nearby, also Fig. 32. Abu-Matar. Monumental Byzantine building in area B, looking east, sixth-seventh century.

The combined architectural, epi- graphic, and ceramic evidence shows an elaborate set of buildings dating to the end of the Byzantine period. The main part of this complex was built in the final decades of the sixth century, with the repairs and changes in the walls and floors witnessing continued use through the beginning of the seventh century. The earlier phase of the structure appears to date from the end of the fifth and beginning of the sixth century. Excavations also revealed a farmhouse dating to the eighth-ninth centuries above the Byzantine complex. Third Wall (Jerusalem). A salvage excavation was conducted by David Amit and Samuel Wolff (IAA) in area D of the Third Wall sites, located to the north of the Damascus Gate. (For a summary in Hebrew of the results from areas A and B, which were excavated in 1990, see IHadashot Arkheologiyot 97 [1991] 63-65). Iron Age II, Early Roman, and especially Byzantine pottery was recovered from leveling fills deposited on bedrock; some of the miscellaneous bedrock cuttings may be attributed to the earlier periods. The most important discoveries at the site were an Armenian monastery and church, whose best-preserved phase dates to the mid-seventh century. A seven-line Ar- menian inscription set in the center of a mosaic floor is the most securely dated early Armenian inscription discovered so far in Israel, and as such will serve as a benchmark to date the others (fig. 33). The single- apse church with accompanying crypts was discovered to the north of the residential complex where the Armenian mosaic was found (fig. 34). Three addi- tional Armenian inscriptions were found in this area, two of them carved into stone (tombstones) and one incised into a complete large bowl. The evidence from this excavation, in combination with the "Bird Mosaic" (also with an Armenian inscription, located some 50 m to the southeast), establishes without doubt a sig- nificant Armenian presence to the north of the walls of the Old City at the time immediately following the Arab conquest. Wadi Tawahin (Eilat). U. Avner and D. Nahlieli (both IAA) report on the recent excavations at Wadi Tawaliin (the "Millstone Valley"), located 4 km north- west of Eilat: The site of Wadi Tawalhin was first described in 1934 by F. Frank as a barite production site. In 1988, geological research showed indications of gold in the area. Recently, during ajoint project of the Geological Institute, Jerusalem, and the IAA, the site was re- surveyed and partially excavated. Systematic sampling for chemical analysis was taken from rocks and sedi- ment and materials from the excavation. The archaeological remains, scattered over an area of 500 m along the wadi, consist of 17 subsites with the remnants of 12 single-room buildings (3-5 m wide), 14 work stations, 23 tents, and a small cemetery. Stone implements discovered to date include 31 bot- tom millstones, 40-80 cm in diameter, numerous fragments of both bottom and top millstones, 46 an- vils, and many stone hammers of various shapes and sizes.</page><page sequence="27">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ISRAEL 161 ... ... ... 2', Ar I.

WOLFF [AJA 97 powder was collected that consisted of more than 90% quartz and 20 ppm gold, while the rocks and sediment contained up to 9 ppm gold. The powder, then, was obviously the product of crushing and milling the gold-bearing quartz. Since no mining trenches were found in the site, the gold-bearing quartz must have been dug from the wadi sediments. The pottery collected from the surface and exca- vation dated exclusively to the early Islamic period, the eighth-tenth centuries. Two charcoal samples an- alyzed by I. Carmi of the Weizmann Institute dated to 970 and 980, respectively (calibrated). No indication was found at the site for the process of separation and purification of gold from the pow- der. According to al-Hamdani, who wrote an essay on gold and silver in the 10th century, this was achieved by repeated washings with water and completed by using mercury. This process most probably took place by the seashore 5 km away. Contemporary gold mines with similar architecture, implements, and the presence of gold are known from the eastern Arabian peninsula. Wadi Tawahin and another nearby site are the only gold production sites to have been discovered to date in the Levant. From ancient sources and excavations we know that during the Umayyad to Fatimid periods, Alia, located at nearby Aqaba, was an important port town and station for caravans, and that the southern Araba was densely settled. It is also known that gold played an important role in the early Islamic economy and culture. There- fore, gold mining and production may have contrib- uted further to the importance of the area in this period. DEAD SEA SCROLL RESEARCH Victor Avigdor Hurowitz of the Annenberg Re- search Institute, Philadelphia, kindly provided the following summary of current Dead Sea Scroll re- search: In 1991-1992 there were no new finds of written material from the area of the Dead Sea and Qumran, [except for ostraca from Upper Nahal Hever Cave; see supra 153-SRW]. An excavation near Qibbutz Almog was conducted intermittently during the spring of 1992 by Vendyl Jones of the Institute of Judaic-Christian Research in Arlington, Texas. The goal of this excavation was to find the ashes of the red heifer prescribed for puri- fication of corpse-defilement (Num. 19; Babylonian Talmud Tractate Pdrdh). The site for excavation was chosen on the basis of Jones's interpretation of pas- sages in the Copper Scroll. A slightly fragrant red material was uncovered in the excavation and sent to Marvin Antelman, a chemical consultant at the Weiz- mann Institute of Science, Rehovot, for analysis. It was found to contain some qualities to be expected in incense made from components prescribed in Rab- binic sources. The excavation has been terminated by the IAA due to Jones's lack of professional qualifica- tions and the expiration of proper permits (see the Jerusalem Post of 1, 4, 5, 10, and 21 May 1992 for reports). A major upheaval in the publication process of the Dead Sea Scrolls took place in 1991-1992. In Septem- ber 1991, Huntington Library in San Marino, Cali- fornia, announced its intention to permit any scholar access to its microfilmed copies of the Scrolls. Shortly thereafter, Ben Zion Wacholder and Martin G. Abegg of Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati produced a volume of unpublished Scrolls (4Q Damascus Docu- ment and 4Q Mishmerot Ha-Kohanim) reconstituted by computer from a provisional concordance that had been prepared as a working tool by the official Scrolls team and distributed to select libraries throughout the world. In October, the IAA lifted its restrictions on the use of unpublished photographs of the Scrolls. In November 1991, the Biblical Archaeology Society, headed by Washington D.C. attorney Hershel Shanks, published two volumes of reduced and not always legible photographs of all the Scroll fragments stored in the Rockefeller Museum (see G. Vermes, "Qumran Publications," Journal of Jewish Studies 43 [1992] 99- 100). The IAA and E.J. Brill now plan to publish microfilm copies of all the Scrolls. Catalogues and inventories of the material still not officially published have appeared in various journals and monographs (see, e.g., E. Tov, "The Unpublished Qumran Texts from Caves 4 and 11," Journal of Jewish Studies 43 [1992] 101-36). Despite the movement toward immediate publica- tion of new material, reworking and improving upon previous scholarly work and long-known texts have not abated. The Damascus Document, discovered in the Cairo Genizah and published by Solomon Schech- ter in 1910, has finally been published in full form (high-quality photographs and transcription into He- brew characters with textual apparatus) by Elisha Qimron of Ben Gurion University (M. Broshi ed., The Damascus Document Reconsidered [Jerusalem 1992] 9- 49). A much-needed and long-awaited concordance of the vast amount of already published material was produced by J.H. Charlesworth, Graphic Concordance to the Dead Sea Scrolls (Tuibingen 1991). Another volume in the Dead Sea Scroll publications appeared: E. Ulrich and P. Skehan, with J. Sanderson, Qumran Cave 4:IV, IX: Paleo-Hebrew and Greek Biblical Manu- scripts (Oxford 1991). See also Judean Desert Scrolls. Forty Years of Research, which is edited by Magen</page><page sequence="29">1993] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ISRAEL 163 Broshi, Shmaryahu Talmon, Sara Japhet, and Daniel Schwartz (Jerusalem 1992, in Hebrew). There has been much popular interest in the pub- lication of the remaining Dead Sea Scrolls. Numerous articles on the subject have appeared in newspapers and tabloids ranging from the New York Times to the National Enquirer. Especially prominent, not only in its following but also in generating public furor over the Scrolls' publication, has been the popular Biblical Archaeology Review. There have also been several tele- vision and radio programs on the Scrolls broadcast over the course of the past year and many synagogues have hosted Dead Sea Scroll scholars for individual lectures, seminars, and courses.
