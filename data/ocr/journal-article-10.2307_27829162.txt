<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kenneth D. Roeder Episodes in Insect Brains How do animals select modes of behavior adapted to immediate circumstances? A mechanism is sought by probing the brains of insects It must have been in far antiquity when a man first noted that a de capitated insect might live and con tinue to show complex behavior for many days, whereas similar treatment of an animal more like himself would cause immobility and death in a few minutes. Today we know that the immediate cause of this difference is relatively trivial. The life-support centers, especially those regulating respiration, are concentrated in the vertebrate brain, whereas in insects they are distributed in other parts of the central nervous system. The wider significance of this difference is due to the divergence of insect and vertebrate nervous systems quite early in animal evolution. The insect sys tem became a segmented string of ganglia near the ventral surface of the body while that of vertebrates develops from a neural tube lying near the dorsal body surface. Their functional histories also fol lowed separate paths, insect seg mentai ganglia retaining a consider Kenneth D. Roeder is professor of physiology in the Department of Biology at Tufts University.

Insect body segments can be said to have retained "states rights" not only in respiratory control but also in many postural, locomotor, sexual, and grooming mechanisms. A single isolated body segment of the cock roach with its resident ganglion can even learn to avoid placing its feet in a position where they have pre viously received a noxious stimulus (Horridge, 3). In spite of this local independence, the behavior of insects deprived of their brains gives the impression that they have been converted into auto mata. It is the purpose of this paper to examine the physiological basis for this impression and also to investigate the part played by an insect's brain in selecting from its segmental repertoire of action patterns only those that favor survival of the species under a given set of conditions. In spite of the different histories of insect and vertebrate nervous systems, both groups depend on the same neural principles. Thus, these matters are basic to all behavior mechanisms. The insect central nervous system The nervous systems of Crustacea, spiders, and insects derive from the nervous systems of worm-like an cestors (Fig. 1, A). The obvious value of having well-developed sense organs at the front end of the animal re sulted in a concentration of sub servient nerve cells in the anterior body segments. These segments sub sequently telescoped (Fig. 1, B), leaving their ganglia partially fused into two masses, one lying above and one below the esophagus (Fig. 1, G). The term "brain" when applied in common to both insects and verte brates implies no degree of homology. It refers merely to that part of the nervous system contained in the head?that body region that first meets mates, food, and danger. The dorsal or supraesophageal part of the insect brain consists mainly of three pairs of partly fused nerve masses, the optic lobes, the antennal lobes, and the protocerebral lobes (Fig. 2). The optic and antennal lobes make up the largest part of the supra esophageal complex in insects that have well-developed visual and ol factory senses. Little is known about the nature of the transactions per formed within these lobes, but it is assumed that they are primarily concerned with processing sensory information and passing the product on to the protocerebral lobes. The protocerebral lobes join the sub esophageal part of the brain by con nectives passing on either side of the esophagus. The subesophageal com plex consists of fused ganglia associated with the mouth parts. Besides supply ing these appendages, it may have certain general functions of its own as well as serving as a connecting link between the brain and the ventral chain of ganglia distributed through the body segments. This very cursory glance at the anat omy of the brain makes it clear that the two major senses guiding the orientation of insects both funnel their information through the proto cerebral lobes. This suggests that the protocerebral lobes, perhaps acting in concert with the subesophageal complex, are in a position to serve as the main control center that deter mines whether the creature shall run, fly, groom, feed, or mate under ap propriate conditions. Of course, these behavior choices also depend upon 378 American Scientist, Volume 58</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1. Hypothetical stages in the evolu tion of the insect brain. A, worm-like ancestor.

The state of the nervous system is determined also by hormones and metabolites. When one attempts to catalog the various behavior modes available in the repertoire of a given insect and, at the same time, considers the fluctuat ing barrage of information contin ually impinging on its central nervous system from this receptor array, it really seems quite astounding that the insect generally does only one thing at a time. And for long periods of its day it appears to be doing nothing at all! How is the choice of action or nonaction determined? It is easy to dream up a model having built-in instability and several modes of action, each mode provided with positive and negative feedback, mu tual inhibition between modes, and so on. But however complex, a model points only to one among many pos sible solutions and does not describe a mechanism. Direct information about the working of a system of this sort can be obtained only by interfering with its mechanism and by intercepting the input and output of its components. In the case of the insect brain, prog ress has been slow because the proto cerebral ganglia of a moderately large insect such as a cockroach are only about one millimeter in diameter. Ablation studies The fact that the insect central ner vous system is made up in large part of a chain of anatomically discrete ganglia that can be surgically sep arated from one another prompted a large number of ablation studies dur ing the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Behavior was observed and measured before and after excision of specific ganglia. The most notable experiments are those of A. Bethe (/). Work done before 1930 has been fully reviewed by Ten Cate (2). These studies showed that the complex sequence of muscle actions, as well as the frequency and phase variations of appendage movement required by activities such as stepping, walking, running, jumping, grooming, flying, and mating, are coordinated in the segmental ganglia. Recently, D. M. Wilson (24) found that the motor impulse rhythm generating wing-flap ping in locusts not only originates in the appropriate segmental ganglia but also is truly endogenous and indepen dent of sensory input for its organiza tion. The same appears to be true for complex copulatory movements made by the male praying mantis (7). These actions may occur spontane ously in a headless insect, and in some cases in isolated body segments, in a perfectly coordinated form. The most notable change following separation of the insect brain from the rest of the central nervous system is seen in the relative incidence of certain types of actions. The normal habit of a praying mantis is to climb to the top of a plant stem where it waits for hours, moving only to strike at and capture a passing insect with its specially adapted forelegs. Blind ing or loss of its antennae do not change its behavior (except, of course, to eliminate the strike), but removal of the protocerebral lobes causes a mantis to walk. Forward locomotion is continuous, and stepping does not cease even when the insect runs into an obstruction. The grasping reflex of the forelegs, normally used only in prey capture, is also continually present. Any object, such as a twig, coming in contact with the raptorial forelegs is grasped and held indefinitely (8). The usual result of these two actions taking place simultaneously is that the mantis becomes hopelessly en tangled among twigs and grass stems?grasping holds it back while locomotion pulls it forward?and it must be concluded that their coinci dence makes behavioral nonsense. In the intact insect, walking and grasp ing must be subject to an inhibitory or "either/neither" type of control from the brain?walking, or grasping, or neither. When this control is removed the insect's behavior is dominated simultaneously by both action pat terns. Other insect behavior patterns are subject to similar control. Male man tids make continuous and fully co ordinated copulatory movements after removal of the subesophageal gan glion (7). Decapitated female moths continuously lay eggs (6). Rowell (20) has shown that grooming movements made by the forelegs of a locust are normally suppressed by the rest of the central nervous system, mainly by the ganglion supplying the hind legs. In the mantis, control by mutual sup pression even extends between sup pressive centers in the right and left halves of the protocerebral lobes: when these parts of the brain are separated from one another but each remains connected to the rest of the central nervous system, the insect can neither walk forward nor grasp? it can only make intention movements indicative of both actions (8). Exten sive experiments by Huber (4) show that singing behavior in crickets is coordinated in the thorax and subject to similar control from the brain. These findings suggest that choice of a behavior relevant to a given situation may be determined not merely by "switching it on" but also by suppress ing other behavior modes that are not relevant under the circumstances. In insects this suppressive function is most evident in the brain, although it extends to all levels of neural organiza tion. When the main "choice-making" mechanism is removed, the uncon trolled release of competing behavior modes gives the impression of auto matism. Ablative methods may have served to reveal a general principle underlying the control of insect behavior, but beyond this they are unsatisfying. They are based on negative reasoning ?the role of a ganglion is deduced from its absence. If finer methods could be developed ablation might reveal details of specific mechanisms, but insect ganglia are small and sur gery on this scale is crude, disrupting an unknowable number of neural circuits beyond those of immediate interest. Electrocautery and radio frequency thermocoagulation have been used to produce lesions, and while they make it possible to produce finer defects, these have undefinable limits and permit only the same sub tractive reasoning. Ideally, it should be possible to "listen in" to the traffic of nerve impulses in specific brain pathways without disrupting them. However, even the finest probing electrode does some damage as it passes through the tangle of neuron connections in search of significant signals, and our frag mentary anatomic knowledge of spe cific connections between different re gions makes this method a hit-or miss procedure.

With these limita tions in mind, I shall discuss experi ments searching the brains of moths for signals that direct the evasive be havior of these insects in the presence of bats. Acoustic evasive behavior of moths Insectivorous bats make ultrasonic cries and use the echoes to find their way and their prey as they fly in dark ness. Certain moths have ears sensi tive to these sonar pulses and make evasive maneuvers when they are ex posed to ultrasonic pulse trains simu lating the sounds of their predators (9, 23). The ear of a noctuid moth, situated on the side of its thorax, is a simple acoustic detector, containing only two sense cells, which differ by about 20 db in sensitivity (78). The more sensitive acoustic sense cell is known as Al, the less sensitive as A2. The nerve impulse signal from each of these sense cells measures small differences in sound intensity. It con tains no information on differences in pitch but is maximally sensitive in that region of the acoustic spectrum that covers the cries of bats (Fig. 3). Its properties are reviewed in an earlier issue of American Scientist (79). Since publication of that article it has been shown (9) that moths' evasive behavior is of two sorts. Steered turn ing-away accompanied by flight ac celeration takes place when the sounds are faint; non-directional and ap parently unpredictable diving, jink ing, and falling occurs when the sounds are intense. It seems probable that turning-away behavior is steered by a differential in the nerve signals delivered by the more sensitive sense cell (Al) in each ear. Steering is ac complished by changes in the tension of small muscles altering the angles of the wings (75). Non-directional diving and looping have not been studied so fully, but these actions are almost certainly initiated when both acoustic sense cells in both ears are stimulated, perhaps maximally, by the cries of a nearby bat. This erratic behavior may be caused by saturation of Al and A2 in both ears. It could be due to exces sive feedback in the steering system accompanied by partial or complete suppression of the wing-flapping sys tem. The survival value of these two kinds of response becomes evident on com paring the ranges of a bat's sonar and a moth's sonar detector. Bats appear to receive an echo from a moth sized object that is consistent enough for tracking only when the range is less Fig. 3. Spectral distribution of sound in tensities recorded in the field (black line) and the relative acoustic sensitivity of a moth (Feltia subgothica) at the same frequencies (purple line). Intensities are shown in arbi trary decibel units. All sounds from 5 to 100 kHz were recorded with a B &amp; K microphone and taped over a 5-minute period about 8 : 15 p.m. on August 22 in a partly wooded area where bats commonly feed. The microphone was approximately 5 feet from ground level and directed up ward. The tape section was subsequently accumulated in a spectrum analyser and the curve (black line) drawn from its tracing. The moth belongs to a species commonly active at this season and the specimen was captured in this area. Sensitivity of the tympanic response at different frequencies was determined as described (71). The 3ounds below 15 kHz were produced mainly by insects; those between 23 and 50 kHz came from passing bats. The acoustic response of the tympanic organ can be seen to maximize bat cries and minimize insect sounds. than about 10 feet; moths can detect the cries made by cruising bats at more than 10 times this range (77). A bat has sufficient speed easily to overtake most moth species in a straight chase, but the predator is less able to make sharp turns because of its greater bulk. Thus, turning and flying away at speed is an effective tactic for the moth only when it is still out of sonar range and unde tected, while erratic sharp turns and dives have survival value when the moth is close enough to be tracked by its predator. Details are discussed else where (73, 74, 75). Attempts to find out how this evasive behavior is organized and controlled by a moth's central nervous system ran inevitably into a difficulty that has already been touched upon. Attempts to unravel behavior mech anisms are bedeviled by the fact that analysis of the system cannot be carried out without some interference with its normal operation. This limita tion, which is analogous to the un certainty principle of physics, is due to the experimenter's need not only to isolate parts of the mechanism in order to assess their contribution to the working of the whole, but also to place the whole system under con trolled conditions where external vari ables can be manipulated inde 1970 July-August 381</page><page sequence="5">pendently. These are never the condi tions of "normal operation" under which the system became adapted to promote survival of the species. It is only too easy to find evidence of this "uncertainty principle." It seems safe to assume that if a moth's ears are to have survival value, the insect must react in one way or another every time it detects a bat's cries as it flies about its natural business in darkness and under other undefined conditions that make up its natural surroundings. Some illumination had to be used in observing and photo graphing the tracks of moths in response to an ultrasonic source in the field (9, 70), and this must have biased the results in some degree. For instance, some moths were seen to fly directly into the light source without responding to ultrasound. In spite of this obvious defect in the method, 80 to 90 percent of the moths not so diverted were observed to react to the ultrasonic source (70). Further details of avoidance behavior were then sought by bringing moths into the laboratory and inducing them to fly while attached to a support. Their turning tendencies were mea sured aerodynamically when they were exposed to sounds coming from known directions (75). Light could be eliminated from this situation, but additional information was obtained only at the cost of greater interference of other kinds. Only about 20 percent of the moths that would fly steadily under these conditions would then make consistent attempts to turn away from the sound source. Among these were individuals that might turn away as predicted dozens of times on Fig. 4. Comparison of tympanic and brain re sponses to acoustic stimulation in Heliothis zea. A, response of tympanic sense cell Al to 30 kHz pulse at test intensity (3-5 db one occasion only to show no response to the acoustic signal on another. No formula or circumstance could be found that would bring performance levels in the laboratory up to those observed in the field. A still greater degree of restriction ac companied by considerable surgical insult was imposed when a micro electrode was inserted into the thoracic ganglia in search of the neural transac tions concerned in avoidance behavior. These still more stringent experimental conditions permitted the detection of an entirely stable and reproducible response from the acoustic sense cells and a less stable response from second order interneurons. But as the search was carried further "down stream" in the central nervous sytem for units coupled to the input signal, relevant responses became more labile and transitory, and the trail was finally lost (72, 13). The level of restraint necessary seemed entirely to prohibit significant changes in the pattern of motor impulses directed to the muscles known to be concerned in turning away, even when no part of the inter vening neural mechanisms had know ingly been disturbed. One is forced to conclude that some other unspecifiable and nonspecific input or internal state had been so altered by experi mental conditions that the avoidance response to ultrasound had been completely suppressed. Naively, one is tempted to question why a moth should choose to avoid a distant "bat" when so strapped down and in such dire straits ! Difficulties of this kind led me in search of their causes, not with any hope of outwitting the biological above threshold). B, the same at an in tensity of +10 db. Center trace, rectified version of sound pulse; lower trace, 1 kHz. C, response of brain interneurons to stim "uncertainty principle" but rather to discover whether this lability in be havior was somehow connected with specific neural transactions in a moth's brain. Signals in a moth's brain Control of evasive behavior by the brain was suggested by Treat's (23) observation that although decapitated moths still respond to ultrasound their reactions are fragmentary compared with normal evasive behavior and generally require high sound inten sities. This suggests (1) that the pri mary neural connections for acoustic behavior reside in the thoracic seg ments where the ears and wings are located and (2) that these primary neural mechanisms derive enhance ment or facilitation from the brain. This mechanism of control appears to have the opposite sign from that exerted by the mantis brain over walking, grasping, and sexual be havior. In the present case it could be argued that decapitation causes merely a lowering of central excitatory state by removing input from the eyes and other head sense organs. However, this explanation seems unlikely since moths in stationary flight show turning-away behavior in darkness (15) and after loss of their antennae. In any case, since the simple acoustic input as well as the behavior it engenders have been reasonably well defined (10, 15, 18), it seemed worthwhile searching in the brain for nerve responses re lated to acoustic stimulation. Probing a moth's brain requires considerably less drastic surgery than probing its thoracic ganglia, but the insect must again be restrained. Its head, in particular, must be held ulus strength similar to that in A. D, the same at +10 db.

In the experiments to be described, one ear was usually destroyed, and the moth was exposed to ultrasonic pulses of an intensity just sufficient to produce a consistent brain response (test inten sity). This reduced the acoustic input to its simplest possible dimension?nerve impulses from acoustic sense cell Al. As sound pulses reached the ear at 1/sec, the neuropile (the central region where neural transactions are thought to take place) of the proto cerebral lobes was searched for elec trical events correlated with the acous tic stimulus. Other sound intensities used are referred to the test intensity. It was my intent to use "spike" re sponses to faint sound pulses as indicators of the excitability of brain neurons under various conditions. The probability that this excitability is altered by the testing process itself was reduced by repeating the test acoustic stimuli only once a second. This is one-tenth of the repetition frequency to which a moth would be exposed in nature from the cries of a distant bat and, hopefully, caused only minimal amounts of adaptation and habituation. In any case, while under this routine, moths continued to show responses to sound pulses of test intensity for as much as 8 hours. Most of the experiments were carried out during the evening hours, when moths are commonly active under natural conditions. Acoustic responses of the brain Figure 4 compares the train of nerve impulses generated by acoustic sense cell Al in response to pulses of about test intensity (A) and an intensity 10 db greater (B). The manner in which this minimal acoustic input encodes in tensity differences has been discussed elsewhere (70, 79; see 70, Fig. 1). This signal, coming from both ears, is capable of steering turning-away, ap parently operating through neural cir cuits in the thoracic ganglia (72, 73). The acoustic signal is also relayed to the moth's brain, where it elicits spike responses of the type shown in frames G and D of Figure 4. The brain region where these spike re sponses to acoustic stimulation were most commonly encountered is shown by the black square in Figure 2. One or more neurons discharge spikes on both the right and left sides of the brain when the stimulus is delivered nionaurally. Some units respond phasi cally?that is, they discharge spikes only at the onset of a 30 msec sound pulse. Others are tonic, firing through out the pulse. Two tonic units, dis tinguished by their differing spike heights, are shown in frames C and D of Figure 4. Beyond the fact that the single sense cell generates re sponses in several brain units, there is little sign of integration or transforma tion of the input signal. However, when such brain responses were ob served over extended periods, they sometimes underwent interesting changes. This required observation and com parison of the succession of brain responses recurring 1/sec over periods of several hours. Responses were re corded on magnetic tape as the pre pared moth lay undisturbed and usually in darkness. Compression of the huge amount of data was ac complished by reducing each sequence of spikes to a row of dots, each row being laid down just below that pre ceding. This dot display was pro jected on a storage oscilloscope. Each frame of dots encompasses (vertically) a period of 1 to 3 minutes, and still retains and compares information on the latency, pattern, and number of spikes in individual responses. In Figures 8 to 10 the raster is measured in milliseconds on the horizontal axis and in seconds (one between each row of dots) on the vertical axis. Observation of about 150 of these brain interneuron preparations for periods of from 2 to 8 hours apiece re vealed three interesting modes of behavior: facilitation produced by more intense or more frequent sounds, differential suppression of units by sound pulses of increasing intensity (77), and lapses in acoustic responsive ness (16). The incidence of these modes could not be predicted, but in preparations where they did occur each could be elicited a number of times. Since they seem to relate to the question of an attention mech anism in the brain they will be pre sented in some detail. Facilitation. In some cases it was noted that when a loud sound lasting about one second, or a brief sequence of short pulses at 10/sec, was interpolated in the 1/sec sequence of test pulses, the brain interneurons showed signif icantly increased responsiveness to subsequent test pulses that persisted for a number of seconds (Fig. 5). Since the acoustic sense cells show the opposite effect?that is, a brief (less than 1 second) period of adaptation or decreased sensitivity under such conditions?this facilitation of the brain response cannot have originated in the sensory mechanism of the ear. It seems possible that facilitation might be significant in improving moths' ability to discriminate the pulse sequence (about 10/sec) emitted by an approaching bat from other short random sounds of the night, and it may, therefore, represent another Fig. 5.

It has al ready been shown (Fig. 3) that addi tional discrimination between bat and insect sounds is available at the sensory level. Differential suppression. It was found in 19 out of 65 preparations that if the sequence of pulses at test intensity was replaced by pulses of higher intensity, certain tonic units in the brain would show the expected increase in number of spikes, while other contiguous units would be partially or almost com pletely suppressed (17). This differential effect is illustrated in Figure 6. The unit generating large spikes and that generating small spikes both show an increasing re sponse from 0 (test intensity) up to +20 db. At +30 db the "large" unit discharges fewer spikes, partic ularly in the central part of its re sponse, while at +40 db only the initial large spike remains. In con trast, the "small" unit shows increas ing numbers of spikes over the whole 40 db range. Differential suppres sion in another preparation is shown graphically in Figure 7. Since one ear had been destroyed for these experiments the input re sponsible for differential suppression must have come solely from the Al and A2 acoustic sense cells in the surviving ear. Earlier studies (10, 18) showed that these two sense cells differ in sensitivity by about 20 db. Al may be said to be capable of encoding in tensity differences in its spike response over a range of low to moderate in tensities; A2 performs similarly from moderate to high intensities?a range within which the Al signal is saturated and incapable of further increase. Al and A2, operating in tandem, thus provide a combined signal from which intensity differences can be dis criminated over a range of 40 to 50 db. Presumably, comparison of these signals, as generated by the right and left ears, informs an intact moth of the range as well as the bearing of a cruising bat, and this in turn deter mines the nature of its evasive action. The present study was limited to monaural moths for simplicity's sake, and raises two questions. How do differences in the sensory input at dif ferent intensities relate to this differ ential performance of brain inter neurons? How is this differential per formance related to acoustic evasion responses? There seems to be only one logical answer to the first question. The response of the "small" unit (Fig. 7, dashed line) increases in quasilinear fashion over a 40 to 50 db range of sound intensity. Therefore, impulses from both Al and A2 in the single ear must, when their signals impinge on the "small" unit, summate so that their synaptic effects combine and overlap over the whole intensity range. The "large" unit (solid line) shows a parallel increase at low to medium sound intensities so that it must also be synaptically excited by signals in Al. Its spike response be gins to decline at moderate sound intensities (where Al begins to saturate and A2 begins to generate impulses), which could only mean that the aug menting A2 signal causes increasing inhibition that is superimposed on a constant level of excitation generated by the saturated Al signal. This hy pothesis is supported by the fact that the first spike of the "large" sequence persists after the rest have been sup pressed (Fig. 6, +40 frame). It is reasonable to expect the first "large" spike to escape suppression since the first Al impulse will arrive slightly before the first A2 impulse at most sound intensities. In summary, then, the signs of the connections are: "small" unit, from Al + from A2 + ; "large" unit, from Al + from A2 ?. The second question, that regarding the relation of differential suppression to evasive behavior, can be given only a hypothetical answer. The effects of decapitation (23) suggest that the moth brain modulates evasive be havior by potentiating it. This modulation is visualized as some form of regeneration or positive feedback from the brain to local neural cir cuits in the thorax concerned with connecting the ears to appropriate 384 American Scientist, Volume 58</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 7. Differential suppression of brain responses in Pseudaletia unipuncta. Right ear has been destroyed. Stimulus pulse (40 kHz, 30 msec) was increased in steps from test intensity (0 on horizontal axis) to +45 db. At each step the stimulus was repeated at 1 /2-sec intervals and the number of large and small spikes in 5 responses counted and averaged (vertical axis). The small spike response {purple line) increases linearly to +45 db. The large spike response to in creasing intensity {black line) becomes nega tive above +20 db. muscles. It is convenient to divide these muscle groups and the neural circuits that organize their activity into a "steering mechanism" that controls wing angle and extension on the two sides of the body, and a "drive mechanism" that flaps the wings up and down so as to propel the insect. They are analogous to the rudder and the propeller of a vessel. The steering mechanism depends on a differential (right/left) signal and must include a loop containing nega tive feedback, as do all steering sys tems. Let us suppose that the "small" unit encountered in the brain regu lates the amount of negative feedback applied in the steering-system loop, and that this amount bears some proportion to its signal. Then, at low sound intensities (equivalent to a distant bat) the negative feedback will be moderate, bringing about steered turning-away with minimal hunting and over-shooting. At high sound intensities (as from a nearby bat) many "small" impulses will be gen erated, making the level of feedback in the thoracic neural interactions excessive. One might expect that steered flight away from the sound source would then be replaced by overshooting on turns, spiraling, and looping. The same reasoning may be applied to the drive mechanism that flaps the wings. The "motor" here is a single massive bank of muscle that moves the wings on both sides as a single unit. Only amplitude and frequency of flapping can be varied. Wilson (24) has shown that the flight drive mechanism of locusts is truly endog enous, continuing to deliver prop erly timed excitations to the "up" and "down" muscles after being totally deprived of input from sense organs or the brain.

In Wilson's experiments it tended to operate at subnormal frequencies and amplitudes, but could be potentiated by nonspecific stimula tion. Insects decapitated in flight will continue to flap their wings, but it is difficult to start sustained flight move ments in a moth that has been pre viously decapitated. It seems possible that the "large" neuron of the present experiments may control one source of this potentiation. If this is so, when a moth detects a distant bat and is still out of sonar range, its signal might be responsible for the increased flight speed seen as the moth turns and flies away from its predator. Loud sounds, as from a nearby bat, will partially or completely suppress ac tivity in the "large" neuron, with drawing this potentiation or even replacing it with inhibition of the drive mechanism. This effect is likely to be erratic as the moth whirls and jinks relative to the sound source, accounting for the medley of flight bursts intermingled with passive fall ing. This fragile hypothesis will not be pursued further, but it gains some support from lapses in acoustic respon siveness sometimes shown by the same brain neurons. Lapses in acoustic responsiveness. When I first began observing acoustic re sponses in moth brain interneurons I was puzzled and irritated by their occasional and sudden bouts of in stability. I am still puzzled, for I found this instability to be their most in teresting property. Consequently I have spent several hours following this behavior in each of over one hundred preparations in the hope of understanding the conditions and significance of lapses (16). Examples of these episodes in respon siveness are shown in Figure 8. They commonly began to occur an hour or so after placement of the electrode, and might recur at indeterminate intervals for another hour or so. Each might last for a few seconds or many minutes. Frame A in Figure 8 shows several abrupt transitions in responsiveness to the test stimuli, each lapse lasting a few seconds. In other cases there was a more gradual waxing and waning. Most lapses seemed to occur spon taneously. But if the moth had been undisturbed and in darkness, a lapse could sometimes be precipitated by movements made in dim light in view of its compound eyes (Fig. 8, C and D, at square indent). Light flashes were less effective. Once so initiated, a lapse might continue for seconds or minutes after darkness had been restored. Brief exposure to a loud sound (Fig. 8, D, at V indent) often terminated a lapse initiated by visual stimulation, restoring regular re sponses to sound pulses of test in 1970 July-August 385</page><page sequence="9">T.-RM .7M o E 0 . v 4. 4 iv see 0 00 iM BB B BaWX 41 N mv nP l N*4IoA Mlb 40 41 T-gk Fig. 8.

However, if the brain units were already responding to test sound pulses, interpolation of a loud sound (Fig. 8, B, at V indent) had no further effect on excitability. Here it is note worthy that a lapse occurred "sponta neously" about 15 seconds later. The fact that louder sounds tended to increase the sensitivity of brain units to faint test pulses made it difficult to determine the actual decrease in acoustic sensitivity that marked a lapse. It appeared to be from 5 to 15 db. The restoring effect of loud sounds clearly relates lapses to facilitation. In some cases differential suppression was noted in brain interneurons that at another time in the same specimen showed lapses. It must be emphasized that, contrary to the impression that may have been created by presenting these selected examples, most lapses related to no evident circumstance. Light and sound might act as de 2?, Heliothis zea, a single loud sound (at V indent) causes a prolonged brain response (line of dots across the frame) but does not interrupt responses to the test pulses. About 15 seconds later there is a spontaneous lapse (bottom of frame). C, Pseudaletia unipuncta, brain responses to test pulses cease on move ments being made (square indent) in view of moth's compound eyes. Lapse continues for about 10 seconds after movements cease, to be followed by a short period of acoustic scribed in one case, only to be in effective in another. This behavior suggests that the elec trode was in contact with some part of an attention mechanism in the moth's brain. Rowell and Horn (21) found in the brain of a locust inter neurons that showed similar episodic responsiveness to visual stimulation and concluded that they formed part of an arousal mechanism. In the free animal such mechanisms might be expected to promote one mode of be havior over others. Therefore I at tempted to find out what moths were doing during these episodes in acoustic responsiveness, although I was not overoptimistic because of the severe restrictions placed on behavior by the experimental conditions. It was noticed that moths often strug gled and sometimes rhythmically vi brated their indirect flight muscles as responsiveness and another lapse before responsiveness is resumed. D, Heliothis zea (same specimen as in B), weak acoustic response (top of frame) ceases on visible movements (for duration of square indent). Acoustic lapse continues for about 20 seconds and is terminated by a loud hiss (V indent and train of spikes across frame). The responses to test pulses that follow appear to be stronger than those occurring before the lapse. Compare with Fig. 5. if attempting to fly. A second elec trode was implanted among the muscles that flap the wings in order to get a measure of this activity through the muscle potentials. This part of the study is incomplete and has not been published in full. However, the results of two experiments are signif icant in the present context. In the first experiment the moth had been inactive for 90 minutes and then began to generate a continuous se quence of flight muscle potentials lasting 13 minutes. As usual, its left ear was exposed to faint test pulses 1/sec, and acoustic responses of brain interneurons were recorded through out the experiment. During the "flight" period there were several lapses in acoustic responsiveness, dur ing which the brain interneurons fired in bursts of about 20/sec. Frame A of Figure 9 shows one of these episodes in a dot pattern.

This is followed by a period of more than 1 minute when there is a con sistent acoustic response with a latency of 12-15 msec. Next there is an acoustic lapse, the brain units vol leying at a faster rhythm not syn chronized with the sweep (diagonal pattern). At the bottom of the 3 minute frame the brain units return to an acoustic mode after a few sec onds of indeterminate activity. In Figure 9, frames B to E show single sweeps selected from the episodes sum marized in the dot pattern. Each sweep includes a record of concurrent flight muscle potentials (upper traces) and a signal marking the test sound pulse (lower traces). The rhythmic suc cession of flight muscle potentials con tinues throughout the transitions of brain activity (middle traces) from an acoustic response mode (B) through an indeterminate phase at the V in dent in A (C), synchrony of brain bursts and muscle potentials (D), and finally a return to the acoustic mode (E). This "either/or" type of brain ac tivity first suggested that the brain units were at one time being driven minute "flight." B-E, single sweeps selected from this episode: upper traces, muscle potentials recorded from thorax; middle traces, brain electrode; lower traces, stimu lus signal. B, from upper section of dot display. C, from transitional phase of brain by sensory input from the ear and at another time by sensory input gen erated by the vibrating thorax. In a second similar experiment the same brain behavior was recorded, but the moth appeared unable actually to get its "flight motor" started. This points to a still more interesting con clusion. In this case the moth struggled briefly a number of times, but the muscle electrode did not register a rhythmic sequence of muscle potentials, as in the first case. Yet neurons in contact with the brain electrode made a num ber of transitions from discharging in the acoustic mode to bursts recurring rhythmically at about 23/sec. One of these episodes is summarized over a 3-minute span in the dot pattern (Fig. 10, A). It is very similar to that recorded from the "flying" moth (Fig. 9, A). In two sweeps (Fig. 10, B) selected from the first part of this episode the upper trace shows no sign of excitation reaching the flight mus cles, yet the brain neurons appear to be active at the expected wingbeat fre quency. After nearly a minute this behavior terminates in a brief and irregular burst of flight muscle po activity marked by V indent in A.

After a few seconds of indeterminate brain activity the brain neurons re turn once more to the acoustic re sponse mode (lower sweep in C) and continue thus for an indefinite period (both records in D). Except for the brief irregular burst of muscle po tentials, there is no rhythmic flight muscle activity throughout the period. The same sequence?acoustic mode, flight mode, brief muscle burst, and return to acoustic mode?was repeated a number of times in an hour of tap ing. As I listened to these brain and muscle signals coming from two loud speakers I could not help being re minded of a self-starter (23/sec "flight" rhythm in brain) turning over a balky automobile engine that even tually fired briefly (muscle potential burst) but could not be brought to the point of being self-sustaining. After a variable interval (acoustic mode of brain units) the process was repeated all over again.

In passing, it must be noted that this inability was probably due to the restrictive conditions of the experi ment, a somewhat ironic commentary on my earlier complaints about the bias introduced by these restrictions! A system oscillating at presumptive wingbeat frequency can be "turned on" in the moth's brain. This brain "flight oscillator" is capable of opera tion during inactivity of the endog enous thoracic oscillator, shown by Wilson (24) to be the immediate cause of excitation of the flight mus cles. Therefore the brain oscillator is not driven by the thoracic oscillator, although the two oscillators may be coupled (Fig. 9). This suggests that the brain oscillator may serve at one B-D, three pairs of sweeps selected from this episode: upper traces, muscle potentials in thorax; middle traces, brain electrode; lower traces, rectified signal of acoustic stimulus.

C, upper sweep from transitional period marked by V indent in A; a burst of arhythmic muscle potentials shows on the upper trace. time as starter and at another as pace-maker for the thoracic oscillator. Evidence in support of these two func tions comes from the effects of de capitation, after which flight con tinues but tends to run down and is restarted only with difficulty. The intermittent activity of the brain oscillator during steady flight move ment suggests that activity of the thoracic oscillator may tend to wane without occasional support from the brain (Fig. 9). If the results are con sidered in terms of attention, it would seem this was at times directed to maintaining (Fig. 9) or initiating (Fig. 10) flight, and at others toward detecting ultrasonic pulses. Conclusions The closing paragraph of our earlier Lower sweep was recorded a few seconds later after return of acoustic response. D, two sweeps recorded from lower part of A during phase of acoustic responsiveness. E, 1 kHz time mark for all records. The only flight muscle activity during this episode was the arhythmic burst shown in C which lasted about 1 second. paper in American Scientist (79) listed a number of questions regarding moth hearing. Most are still unan swered, but progress has been made in defining the conditions (77) and na ture (75) of acoustic avoidance be havior as well as some of its neural mechanisms (72, 73). This work has been reviewed at length (74). Prog ress has mostly followed paths pointed out by circumstance, and much un finished business remains by the way side. For instance, we still know little about the fine structure and the nature of acoustic transduction in the tym panic sense cells, or about the execu tive neural connections whereby their signals are converted to turning-away or to diving. The present direction was taken because many years ago the behavior of the praying mantis made me curious as to how a given action 388 American Scientist, Volume 58</page><page sequence="12">pattern is selected or "turned on" to the exclusion of others. In this paper I have tried to sidestep introspective and semantic pitfalls surrounding the matter of attention by dealing only with insects and their nerve cells, and by asking about the nature of the mechanism that limits an insect to one action pattern at a time. Perhaps this mechanism may seem self-evident, but it becomes less so after one has listened to the barrage of impulses continually streaming into the central nervous system over just one of an insect's sensory nerves. Is much of this information discarded? If so, how are decisions made about what information is important and what is irrelevant? A mantis deprived of its protocerebral lobes performs continuously and simultaneously two actions?grasping and walking?in a combination that makes behavioral nonsense. An intact mantis has also the third alternative of performing neither action, which it does most of the time. This sug gests that the protocerebral lobes insure one-thing-at-a-time, at least with respect to these three behavior modes, by means of what may be called an either-or-neither mechanism. Once begun, either of these actions, or the non-action, becomes self-rein forcing and at the same time suppresses the others. Stated otherwise, the mechanism includes regeneration and reciprocal inhibition, a principle long familiar at other levels of neural organization. It is best known in the organization of vertebrate spinal reflex mechanisms (Sherrington, 22) and in the ganglionic layer of the vertebrate retina (Kuffler, 5) where it explains the importance of edges and the ac centuation of contrasts in the visual field. But what of the mantis? What suppresses both actions in an inactive but intact insect? How is the either-or decision reached? The experiments with moth brains do not yet answer these questions. However, the methods and the ma terial have points in their favor. First, the acoustic input is sufficiently simple to permit adequate definition of the information it contains, and the be havior is subject to reasonably ade quate description. Second, by dealing with the behavior of brain neurons rather than the behavior of animals one escapes the anthropomorphism that so easily beclouds one's judgment. Brain neuron behavior, categorized here as facilitation, differential sup pression, and lapses in acoustic re sponsiveness, suggests that neural cir cuits loop to the brain from the tym panic sense cells, and that signals in these circuits serve as sources of re generation or positive feedback to executive motor centers in the thorax. The lapses suggest that these regenera tive effects are applied at certain times and not at others. The obser vations that a single loud sound may sharpen or restore acoustic sensitivity and that visual stimulation may cause the acoustic response to lapse fit into this concept. These changes in acoustic responsiveness may endure for many minutes, suggesting that they are central nervous transactions and not peripheral sensory phenomena. Episodes of acoustic unresponsiveness are not occupied by neuronal "silence" but by seemingly random spikes or by rhythms having other modes. One of these modes appears to be the rhythm of wing-flapping, which may occur either intermittently but in synchrony with the thoracic oscillator that actually executes the wing-flap ping, or it may take place at times when there is no overt attempt being made to fly. Thus, the brain neurons in this case were being driven either by acoustic signals, or by the brain flight oscillator, or by unidentified input. This, together with the facts that brain flight bursts were not con tinuous during steady wing vibration and that they could occur also in the absence of wing vibration, seems to show that we were in contact with a mechanism of attention or arousal that operates by positive reinforce ment of segmentally generated be havior patterns.
