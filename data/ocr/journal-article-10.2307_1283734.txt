<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE UNENVIABLE DILEMMA MR. JUSTICE WILLIAM JOHNSON AND THE UNENVIABLE DILEMMA* A. J. Levin t POLICY of judicial avoidance, otherwise referred to as "judi- cial restraint," has clearly been the dominant trend in the United States Supreme Court since Mr. Justice Holmes began to sit upon that bench at the beginning of this century. There has been an inclination to explain this change as revealing a tendency of the Court to follow a policy of laissez-faire toward the legislative and executive departments, and to stop at this formalistic explanation' of this important aspect of the judicial function. The Court's increasing awareness of its own lack of technical competence in dealing with the many complex govern- mental problems, which are being assigned daily to other governmental agencies for consideration and solution, has been largely overlooked.2 The realization by the Supreme Court of its inexpertness, unprepared- ness and inability to function well, rather than its lack of power and jurisdiction, is the real key to an understanding of what has been called * Attention is called to Morgan, "Mr. Justice William Johnson and the Constitu- tion," 57 HARV.

REV. 213 at 237 (I940). 2 Since this article was written, the Supreme Court on December 20, I943, de- cided the case of Dobson v. Commissioner, 64 S. Ct. 239. In that case, probably the most significant opinion yet decided by the Court on the reviewing function in relation to the findings of an administrative body, the Court, by Mr. Justice Jackson, acknowl- edged at p. 245 the superior competency of the Tax Court in dealing with tax problems. "It deals with a subject that is highly specialized and so complex as to be the despair of judges. It is relatively better staffed for its task than is the judiciary." He decried the evils of diversification of appellate authority which multiplied conflicts "by treating as questions of law what really are disputes over proper accounting" and pointed to the mass of decisions which are "a menace to the certainty and good administration of the law." (P. 245). Shortly thereafter on January 3, 1944, the Court decided the case of Federal Power Commission v. Hope National Gas Co., 64 S. Ct. 281, where Mr, Justice Douglas for the majority of the Court said that the administration of the Natural Gas Act had been entrusted by Congress to the Federal Power Commission rather than to the Court, and where the Commission has allowed a return for gas production after con- sidering allowances and expenses, the Court certainly cannot say they are inadequate unless ". . . we are to substitute our opinions for the expert judgment of the administra- tors to whom Congress entrusted the decision."

The legal historian, therefore, will find it enlightening to go back to the opinions of Mr. Justice William Johnson who, at the very beginnings of our constitutional history, at- tempted for almost thirty years-although without success-to arrive at a functional interpretation of judicial power. I HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF "JUDICIAL RESTRAINT" A. Fitness of Court to Deal with Governmental Problems The first opinion which Justice Johnson rendered after his acces- sion to the bench of the United States Supreme Court in 1804 was a concurring opinion in Huidekoper's Lessee v. Douglas in I805. This was a case in which the State of Pennsylvania had challenged the valid- ity of land warrants from which the Holland Company had derived its title to millions of acres of land. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court held against the company; but this decision was reversed. In the opin- ion for the Court, Chief Justice Marshall upheld the rights vested by the warrants and sustained the position of the company. Johnson's opin- ion, though brief, expressed a view about the nature and scope of the judicial function from which he never departed during his thirty years as a member of the Court. "It may appear singular," he observed, "that a deficiency, of a single day perhaps, should produce so material an alteration in the rights or situations of the warrantee. But the Legisla- ture of Pennsylvania was fully competent to make what statutory provisions they thought proper upon the subject; and the court is no further responsible for the effect of the words which they had used to express their intent, than to endeavor to give a sensible and consistent operation to them in every case that can occur."" Likewise, Johnson reasoned in a later opinion, the Court must exercise restraint lest it in- terfere with the proper exercise of the executive function. Whether the Court was to be the instrument "to compel another branch of the government to make good the stipulation of treaties is a very different question," he declared in The Cherokee Nation v. Georgia.4 He then added the keynote of his attitude-"Courts of justice are properly ex- cluded from all considerations of policy, and therefore, are very unfit 8 3 Cranch (7 U.S.) I at 72 (1805).

Adams, 223, 236, 237 (1875). 804 [Vol. 42</page><page sequence="3">instruments to control the action of that branch of the government, which may often be compelled, by the highest considerations of public policy, to withhold even the exercise of a positive duty." Johnson's unwillingness to hamper other departments of govern- ment did not spring from a purely legalistic conception of the sepa- ration of powers, nor from a desire to avoid responsibility, nor an eagerness to achieve judicial self-effacement by insistence upon sharp lines of jurisdiction. A careful reading of his opinions acknowledging a superior competency and fitness in the other departments of govern- ment reveals a rather startling prescience of the problems of judicial review which were later to arise. "When hardships shall arise," we find him saying in United States v. i96o Bags of Coffee,6 "provision is made by law for affording relief, under authority much more competent to decide on such cases, than this court ever can be." Surely, here the concern is not with authority, jurisdiction, power or restraint based upon self-effacement, but upon the more practical question of the fitness of the Court for the task be- fore it. In other words, Johnson's refusal to extend the Court's scope of activity was based upon a scientific conception of what the function of the Court must be under the circumstances of constitutional limita- tion. Whatever his innermost feelings may have been, when he com- pared the relative impotence of a reviewing appellate court with the more dynamic function of the legislative and executive departments, there is nowhere in his writings a lament over the fact that the judiciary controlled neither "the purse nor the sword." Johnson accepted the opinion of Marbury v. Madison,7 which had been announced but two years prior to his first opinion, but always viewed very critically the right of the Supreme Court to declare the acts of Congress unconstitutional and void.8 He saw that under the Constitution the relationship between the Court and other agencies of government presented what he termed an "unenviable dilemma."9 He did not conceive it as his judicial task to undo this dilemma.

THE UNENVIABLE DILEMMA 805 I944 ]</page><page sequence="4">MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW prudence as part of the science of society and of human relationships as a whole. In the new scientific experiment of constitutional govern- ment Johnson saw the judicial function as one which was limited by the choice of the people. His deep respect for the Constitution did not permit him to assume a capacity to deal with all problems of gov- ernment. He would have considered such an assumption a judicial pretension of wisdom not warranted by the Constitution. Competency and fitness were worthy standards in a democratic society. B. Constitution and People a Restraint on the Legislature The American Congress was evolved out of the omnipotent British Parliament, local colonial assemblies, Indian councils, and thousands of years of man's effort toward representative and democratic government. Johnson was keen to sense the novelty of the American arrangement, characterized by the existence, on the one hand, of positive powers and functions reposed in the legislature by the same Constitution which, on the other hand, restrains them. In Fletcher v. Peck,10 one of his very earliest and one of his ablest opinions, Johnson warned the Supreme Court of the dangers and problems involved in judicially defining the limits of legislative action under such a system. There was no real counterpart for a restraint of abuse of function or power by the British Parliament, which could even abolish Magna Charta. Here was some- thing new which had to be carefully appraised. While the Congress was an historical outgrowth of despotism "the American legislative bodies have never possessed, or pretended to, the omnipotence which constitutes the leading feature in the legislative assembly of Great Britain, and which may have led occasionally to the exercise of caprice, under the specious appearance of merited resentment." Nor was the Constitution the only restraint upon arbitrary actions, for there are not only laws and a Constitution, but also situations which set bounds to caprice in deliberative assemblies "when under the influence of strong passions or wicked leaders." 1 Great Britain at the time of the American Revolution had directed a combination of parliamentary and crown despotism toward the Amer- ican Colonies. Johnson's strong distate for such tyranny and arbitrary 10 6 Cranch (io U.S.) 87 (I8Io). 1 Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. (I9 U.S.) 204 at 231 (I8 2). Compare Mr. Justice Reed's statement in Jones v.

Ct. 1231 (I942). The case was subsequently overruled. 806 [ Vol. 42</page><page sequence="5">THE UNENVIABLE DILEMMA power did not lead to his complete disavowal of the need for some co- ercive power somewhere.12 In a democracy, the people could be counted upon to watch out for the encroachments upon their liberties by those in whom authority is reposed. Democratic government necessarily in- volved a substitution of the more diffused authority of popular govern- ment for personal sovereignty. There was no other course, then, but to have supreme confidence in the people who were successors to the personal sovereign. Reliance could be had on "the good sense of a people, who know that they govern themselves, and feel that they have no interests distinct from those of their government."'1 Congress was a "deliberate assembly, clothed with the majesty of the people," 14 a new kind of majesty for those times. Questions which arose between an in- dividual and the community could be disposed of in only one way and that was by "a reference to the positive legislation or received principles of society... the security of the individual lies in exerting his influence to obtain laws which will neither expose the community unreasonably, on the one hand, nor restrain one individual unjustly on the other."'5 He saw realistically that conflicts were bound to be numerous and that means of resolving them were required. "In the eternal struggle that exists between the avarice, enterprise and combinations of individuals, on the one hand, and the power charged with the administration of the laws, on the other," he declared in one of his earlier opinions already referred to, "severe laws are rendered necessary to enable the executive to carry into effect the measures of policy adopted by the legislature." 1 Nor was he fearsome lest legislative discretion would necessarily lead to tyranny. "Nor indeed, is there much to be alarmed at in it, while the same people who govern the states, can, where they will, control the legislature of the United States";" and, "whatever might be proper to be done by an amendment of the constitution, this court is only, at present, expounding its existing provisions." 18 12 Great Britain's attitude toward the American colonists was expressed in the statement that she held "their lives, liberties, and fortunes at the will of a despotic parliament."

Legislature and Executive the Active Bodies The dynamic bodies under our constitutional form of government are the legislative and the executive; and government will thrive or deteriorate depending upon the action or inaction of these instruments. Johnson-in the face of strong opposition from Chief Justice Marshall and the other members of the bench-felt, as Holmes did later, that the judiciary was not entrusted, under the framework of the Constitu- tion, to solve all of the actual or imagined antinomies of individual and social conflict. Even though courts act affirmatively by their judgments and decrees, their active function is the deciding of actual cases and controversies. This leaves the so-called "legislative" function of the court as a by-product of the litigiousness of contesting individuals. This is illustrated by Johnson's remarks in the famous case of The Nereide 19 where he was discussing the principle of reciprocity in international law. "... There is a principle of reciprocity known to Courts admin- istering international law; but I trust it is a reciprocity of benevo- lence, and that the angry passions which produce revenge and retaliation will never exert their influence on the administration of justice. Dismal would be the state of the world, and melancholy the office of a judge, if all the evils which the perfidy and injustice of power inflict on individual man, were to be reflected from the tribunals which profess peace and good will to all mankind. Nor is it easy to see how this principle of reciprocity, on the broad scale by which it has been protracted in this case, can be reconciled to the distribution of power made in our constitution among the three great departments of government. To the legislative power alone it must belong to determine when the violence of other nations is to be met by violence. To the judiciary, to administer law and jus- tice as it is, not as it is made to be by the folly or caprice of other nations." 20 In his admiralty and prize opinions we find some of his most vigorous and keenest legal thinking. In the Mary and Susan,2 where the ques- tion of notice before capture was being considered, Johnson announced a theory of legal omnipotence which he correctly traced to its source in the exercise of personal sovereignty: "... Instruction, ex vi termini is individual. Instruction to A, independent of legal privity or identification, is not instruction to B. Not so with laws: their power floats on the atmosphere we 9 9 Cranch (13 U.S.) 388 (I815). 20 Id. at 432. (Italics the Court's). 21 I Wheat.

Necessity, or convention, or power, has given them a legal ubiquity, co-extensive with the legislative power of the gov- ernment that enacts them. Notice here is altogether unnecessary, unless made so by the law itself. It is the sic volo, sic jubeo, of sovereign power, of which every individual subject to its juris- diction is presumed to have notice, though time and distance stamp absurdity on the supposition." 22 It was within the right of the legislature to control the courts, rather than the reverse. Johnson's desire for independence of the ju- diciary, for which he fought so strongly, sprang not only from his intense love for freedom and individualism but also from a correlative recognition of the appointed function of the legislature and its right to protect its own independence against undue restraint by the courts.23 His approach was both objective and subjective. Should a practice of inter- national law "ever be found materially detrimental to acknowledged national rights, it may be disavowed or relinquished; or should our own legislative power ever think proper to declare against the right, it can impose a law upon its own courts. But until it shall be so relinquished, or abrogated, we are bound to apply it with all the beneficial conse- quencies that it was intended to produce."24 While a policy of departmental independence called for being on guard against "the most tyrannical licentiousness" and abuses of power, Johnson did not overlook the effect of the very positive desire of the citizen to have power exercised in his favor. "But if there is one maxim which necessarily rides over all others, in the practical application of government," he cautioned in his able opinion in Anderson v. Dunn,2" "it is, that the public functionaries must be left at liberty to exercise the powers which the people have intrusted to them. The interests and dignity of those who created them, require the exertion of the powers indispensable to the attainment of the ends of their creation. Nor is a casual conflict with the rights of particular individuals any reason to be urged against the exercise of such powers. The wretch beneath the gallows may repine at the fate which awaits him, and yet it is no less certain, that the laws under which he suffers were made for his security.

His was a more realistic and practical approach than the assumption by some that every depar- ture from an imagined absolute perfection in the administration of gov- ernment could be adequately dealt with by the courts. One of such means was to hold the legislature strictly and literally to the language of its declaration. This method later found favor with Mr. Justice Holmes and now, in the main, prevails on the Supreme Court. The Court now asks first what the Congress did do and not what it could do.27 A. Changed Concept of Notice in Democracy The dynamic origin of particular rules of judicial interpretation is not found stated in the law books or in the opinions of courts. Basically, the reaction is one arising out of communication. Anthropologists tell us that the assault from ambush by surprise or at dawn, when the vic- tims are asleep, is,a common characteristic of primitive mentality. The requirement of notice preceding aggressive action came only with the advance of culture. Due process of law requires notice because it is the very core of all civilization. Tyranny and secrecy have always been allied. Originally, the subject determined at his peril what the sov- ereign wanted.28 In the course of time the sovereign was compelled to announce his intentions and his edicts had to furnish some intelligible advance notice. Since in a democracy the legislature was the successor of "sovereign" power, the same reasons which would exact clarity in 26 Id. at 226 and 228. 27 See Federal Trade Commission v. Bunte Brothers, 312 U.S. 349, 6I S. Ct. 580 (I94I). 28 Justice Holmes in his essay on "Theory of Legal Interpretation" fails to point out the change which democracy brings about in this regard since he emphasizes only the jeopardy of the subject who fails to learn of the sovereign's intent. Holmes says that when "we are dealing with the commands of the sovereign the only thing to do is to find out what the sovereign wants. If supreme power resided in the person of a despot who could cut off your hand or your head if you went wrong, probably one would take every available means to find out what was wanted." HOLMES, COLLECTED LEGAL PAPERS, 207 (I920). 8io [ Vol. 42</page><page sequence="9">THE UNENVIABLE DILEMMA the mandates of the despot would operate to require the lawmaking body to unequivocally state its statutes and ordinances, but the emphasis in a democracy is on communication of what the sovereign must do to make itself understood and not what the citizen must fear. The oracles of ancient Greece, those early authoritative institutions which were partly religious and partly political, often resorted to studied ambiguity to avoid giving notice of the choice of a specific course of action, thereby safely avoiding responsibility by confusing those who sought their ad- vice. Johnson thought it better not to depart from the literal significa- tion of words than to involve consequences inconsistent with "the very nature and very idea of legislation."29 Chief Justice Marshall, too, believed that a law was "the best expositor of itself";"3 with Johnson, as with Holmes a century later, the external standard, the sticking to the generally understood meaning, were lodestars of judicial guidance rather than the exception. And Johnson and Holmes also used the same words to describe their mental processes. In examining the lan- guage of an authoritative body exercising governmental power Johnson found the first task to be to determine what the "words imperatively require," what were the unequivocal directions which gave notice of the sovereign's intent.31 He was quite willing to attribute the whole dif- ficulty in a situation to the obscure wording or doubtful construction of an act of Congress.32 It would be correct to say that he did not believe that the ancient injunction that the letter killeth and the spirit giveth life could operate as a universal principle of hermeneutics. In his vehe- ment dissent in United States v. Palmer33 it is quite clear that he felt that adherence to the letter might on occasions be needed to save life; and, indeed, he went as far as to say that he would not consent to take a life upon a comma more or less in obedience to any court and would rather as an alternative resign his commission. Death would have fol- lowed in the particular case by extending the construction of an act of Congress. Johnson differed with the majority who were willing to in- 29 Huidekoper's Lessee v.

"This is fair reasoning; and in any case but one of life and death, it might have some weight. But in no case, very great weight; because, in that respect, a legislature is subject to no laws in the selection of the course to be pursued."34 B. Technical Precision in the Use of Words Ambiguity is what got him into serious controversy with Jefferson who had appointed him. Gilchrist v. Collector of Charleston,3 decided on circuit, marks one of the most notable stands taken by a judge in be- half of an independent judiciary. In this case Johnson opposed Jeffer- son's enforcement of the Embargo Acts, but it must be added that he did not relish the embarrassing position into which he was placed and the loss of friendship it might involve. In his reply to Attorney Gen- eral Rodney's letter of criticism of his opinion he put his finger on the real source of the difficulty. He even suggested a remedy. "The act," he protested, "prescribes certain terms and modes of process; but it would be as rational to suppose the existence of form without substance, as that these forms and modes of process could be adopted without rela- tion to the cases in which they are known and practised in the several states. Should the want of technical precision in these acts have involved the court in error, the reply is, that the introduction of philological cor- rectness into our laws at some stage of their progress would save the courts much trouble and much odium. This might be done before they pass from the hands of the executive."36 The confidence which the people reposed in the legislature, he felt, warranted a commensurate employment of care in the performance of their duties by the legisla- tors. Here again the emphasis is on competence and fitness but with the criticism directed to another department of government. Recently, Jus- tice Frankfurter has been most persevering, likewise, in constantly repeating the need for aiming at a standard of competence in matters governmental. "To require the various agencies of the government who are the effective authors of legislation like that now before us," he has stated, "to express clearly and explicitly their purpose in dis- lodging constitutional powers of states-if such is their purpose-makes for care in draftsmanship and for responsibility in legislation. To hold, as do the majority, that paralysis of state power is somehow to be found in the vague implications of the federal renovated butter enactments, is 84 Id. at 639. 35 IO Fed. Cas., p. 355, No. 5420 (I8o8). 36 Id. at 363. 812 [ Vol. 42</page><page sequence="11">to encourage slipshodness in draftsmanship and irresponsibility in legis- lation." " Johnson was undoubtedly correct. To enact legislation which is unnecessarily ambiguous is to place a burden of interpretation upon the court which, for all practical purposes, would then exercise legislative power in supplying the omissions. This temptation and burden Sir Henry Maine recognized some years later when he remarked that "if the legislature does not legislate, the courts of justice will have to legis- late; for, indeed, legislation is a process which perpetually goes on through some organ or another wherever there is a civilized Govern- ment, and which cannot be stopped."38 The judge often does only what the legislators should have done better. It is not asking too much that Congress express itself clearly when it wishes to take explicit action. I. Meaning in Relation to Actual Events But Johnson's search for "the technical signification of the terms"39 used should not lead one to think that he was a believer in "mathe- matical nicety" or "delusive exactness" which Holmes often found it necessary to deprecate. In the case of freehold or other fixed property rights the need for literal or strict interpretation was usually greater in order to insure stability of titles. More frequently the problem is not 37 Cloverleaf Butter Co. v. Patterson, 315 U.S. 148 at 178, 62 S. Ct. 49I (1942). See also Mr. Justice Murphy's recent dissenting opinion in United States v. Gaskin, 64 S. Ct. 318 decided January 3, 1944, where he said: "We are dealing here with a criminal statute, the penalties of which circum- scribe personal freedom. Before we sanction the imposition of such penalties no doubts should exist as to the statutory proscription of the acts in question. Otherwise indi- viduals are punished without having been adequately warned as to those actions which subjected them to liability. "It is doubtful whether an arrest not followed by actual peonage clearly and un- mistakably falls within the prohibition of ? 269 of the Criminal Code .... And in order to reach the opposite conclusion, this Court labels the statutory language as 'in- artistic' and as lacking in 'strict grammatical construction.' It then proceeds to rewrite the statute, in conformity with what it conceives to have been the original intention of Congress, so as to penalize 'whoever . . . arrests . . . any person for the purpose of placing him in a condition of peonage.' I cannot assent to this judicial revision of a criminal law. Congress alone has power to amend or clarify the criminal sanctions of a statute. "Apologia for inadequate legislative draftsmanship and reliance on the admitted evils of peonage cannot replace the right of each individual to a fair warning from Congress as to those actions for which penalties are inflicted. Punishment without clear legislative authority might conceivably contain more potential seeds of oppression than the arrest of a person 'to a condition of peonage.'

Complete particularity without some extrinsic aid is virtually an im- possibility. Ita lex scripta est as applied to the legislative power is only a safeguard which is no longer needed if the law is repealed. The room for the "spirit" lies not in disregarding the words but rather in applying them to the circumstances and the object of the legislation and in dis- covering their effect and relation "to the actual subject."41 Our abhorrence of literalism and phariseeism shows that words, standing alone, have no moral, emotional or dynamic content residing in them. Neither words or ideas are living organisms; and it is unfor- tunate that the poetic prose of Justice Holmes42 has led Justice Frank- furter 43 and many others 4 to this unscientific belief. A century and a half ago the Englishman, Horne Tooke, the founder of modern ety- mology, cautioned that we must rid our minds of such metaphors and boldly asserted that "words have no loco-motive faculty, that they do not flow like rivers, nor vegetate like plants, nor spiculate like salts, nor are generated like animals."45 Words are means of communication. 40 Chotard v.

The need of society to correct its errors of the past or to reimplement its ideas is a problem in mental processes which we do not have to project onto a biological hypothesis. There can be no dispute as to the ordinary meaning of the word "void" yet its meaning in a statute can vary greatly within the ranges of the objects of the legislation-and is in many situations as changeable as the mind of the judge.46 It is not necessary to follow the pattern of primitive animism which assumes life in inanimate objects in order to discover that the same words can be given new meaning in new settings. Nor is there any psychodynamic basis for assuming that the animistic projection of our own feelings upon the means used to express them has any real existence on the out- side. The affect, while it may attach to the words and ideas, is always in us. C. Legislature the Principal Communicant The compulsion of the dogma of the separation of powers was traceable to the express provisions of the Constitution which left the whole subject of legislation entirely to the legislature, including all matters of policy and wisdom. But this very separation declared the legislature as the principal communicant, the issuer of laws in the legal advisory process, leaving to the judiciary-except in rare instances- the task of interpreting what the legislators have said. Any substantial inquiry into the wisdom of the laws would transform the judiciary into the communicant. The communicant is surely more able to speak his own mind than is another for him. If it is the duty of the legislator to speak on the subject of laws and the duty of the court to interpret and apply, the starting point is the legislator's words and there can be no question of relative competence and fitness in the performance of this allotted function. So, even if the legislature intends a general meaning for the words used and this is apparent, such general meaning is the literal meaning in the situation. This is illustrated by Johnson's re- marks in United States v. Pirates.47 "The reasonable presumption is," he stated, "that the legislature intended to legislate only on cases within the scope of that power; and general words made use of in that law, ought not, in my opinion, to be restricted so as to exclude any case within their natural meaning. So far as those powers extended, it is 46 See by the writer, "The Varying Meaning and Legal Effect of the Word 'Void'," 32 MICH. L. REV. IO88 (I934).

Because the legis- lature represented the principal energy force of government, he held strongly to the opinion that the scope of the authority of Congress and its constitutional power were not to be literally or narrowly restricted. It was one thing to resort to strict construction in reading the words of a statute but entirely another thing to determine what was the extent of the right of Congress under the Constitution to enact the laws of the land. "In attempts to construe the constitution," he unreservedly an- nounced in his stimulating opinion in Gibbons v. Ogden49 on the com- merce power, "I have never found much benefit resulting from the inquiry, whether the whole, or any part of it, is to be construed strictly or liberally. The simple, classical, precise, yet comprehensive language in which it is couched, leaves, at most, but very little latitude for con- struction; and when its intent and meaning are discovered, nothing remains but to execute the will of those who made it, in the best man- ner to effect the purposes intended. The great and paramount purpose was, to unite this mass of wealth and power, for the protection of the humblest individual; his rights, civil and political, his interests and prosperity, are the sole end; the rest are nothing but the means." Mere "verbal criticism" was to be rejected. The inferences to be drawn from the whole Article containing the vesting of the commerce power were that the power over commerce was exclusive, and the power of Congress over navigation was not an incident of commerce but was to be con- sidered "as the thing itself; inseparable from it as vital motion is from vital existence." Johnson's method of constitutional interpretation proves that few judges can uniformly employ a rule of strict or broad construction with reference to the Constitution. More frequently the judge is uncon- sciously consistent. If he attempts to confine the constitutional power of the legislature to narrower limits, he will tend to compensate by 48 Id. at 196. 49 9 Wheat. (22 U.S.) I at 223 (I824).

Johnson combined the two in rather good balance. The abler constitutional lawyers are beginning to see in the artificial contrasts of such terms as "strict" or "loose," "liberal" or "conservative" the unscientific pitfalls which lead to confusion.50 III SEPARATION OF POWERS This native ability to objectively evaluate, despite his southern attachments, the needs of a federal government in relation to the in- dividual states, led him to express ideas of federal power under the Constitution which were stronger than those of Chief Justice Marshall. It was because here, too, he saw a greater competency in the federal government than existed under the Articles of Confederation that he argued against "prostrating individual security, at the feet of either the one or the other government." 5 In the following passage dealing with the commerce power, one will recognize attitudes which have recently been restated with force by members of the Supreme Court. "... The states were, unquestionably, supreme; and each pos- sessed that power over commerce which is acknowledged to reside in every sovereign state... there is no necessity to appeal to the oracles of the jus commune for the correctness of that doctrine. The law of nations, regarding man as a social animal, pronounces all commerce legitimate, in a state of peace, until prohibited by positive law. The power of a sovereign state over commerce, therefore, amounts to nothing more than a power to limit and re- strain it at pleasure. And since the power to prescribe the limits to its freedom, necessarily implies the power to determine what shall remain unrestrained, it follows that the power must be exclusive; it can reside but in one potentate; and hence, the grant of this 50 "You will not conclude from what I have said that I think these decisions in- consistent or that I would see the course of adjudication set in some more rigid mould. Were that my purpose I should not base my thesis upon a summary so inescapably brief. On the contrary, I put these illustrations to show that the Gilbertian dichotomy between liberals and conservatives hardly suffices for appraising the work of the present Court."

"State rights, or United States' rights are nothing, except as they contribute to the safety and happiness of the people. For them, both governments are formed and made mutually to check and control each other, that they may work solely to the one end, the hap- piness of the individual."53 For such broad objectives dynamic inter- pretations were required. Institutions, even when seemingly new, employ old symbols to describe them. So, as we have already seen, we find Johnson speaking of the aggregate of power in every body politic as a "despotism" which, in constituting a government the body politic, "distributes that power as it pleases, and in the quantity it pleases, and imposes what checks it pleases upon its public functionaries." 54 And this was equally true of the distribution of power within the separate states of the Union. For example, the necessity of vesting specific powers in the courts was not a matter of judicial inquiry. If the reason which influenced the state legislatures was "that they held themselves competent to afford the necessary relief, by the exercise of legislative powers, where is the re- striction in the constitution that controls them in thus extending or ap- plying the powers with which they hold themselves to be constitution- ally vested? They are sought in vain." 55 Not only could the legislature 52 Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. (22 U.S.) I at 227 (1824).

(30 U.S.) 457 at 467 (I83 ) which considered the effect of the Virginia and Kentucky compact where Johnson disapproved a literal and rigid construction when it would present the anomaly of one sovereign state governed by another. On the other hand in Green v. Biddle, 8 Wheat. (z2 U.S.) I at 0I3 (I823) he declared that if the strict construction of one of the articles be departed from "we are left to float on a sea of uncertainty, as to the extent of the legislative power of Kentucky over the territory held under Virginia grants; that if, obliged to elect between the assumed exercise, and the utter extinction of the power of Kentucky over the subject. It would adopt the former; that every question between those extremes, is one of expediency or diplomacy, rather than of judicial cognizance, and not to be decided before this tribunal. If compelled to de- cide on the constitutionality of these laws, strictly speaking, I would say, that they in no wise impugn the force of the laws of Virginia, under which the titles of land- 818 [Vol. 42</page><page sequence="17">THE UNENVIABLE DILEMMA establish what courts it pleased but it could, if it thought proper, vest "the whole equity jurisdiction, not specifically disposed of, in a board of commissioners, instead of vesting specific powers in such a board," where there is no constitutional provision inhibiting such an act of legislation.56 Seemingly inconsistent statements are reconcilable when read in the light of Johnson's ambivalent conception of the new experiment in constitutional government. So we find him at one time asserting that "forms of administering justice, and the duties and powers of courts as incident to the exercise of a branch of sovereign power, must ever be subject to legislative will, and the power over them is unalienable, so as to bind subsequent legislatures";57 and at another complaining of the improper exercise of legislative power as in Satterlee v. Matthew- son: 58 "What boots it," he asks, "that I am protected by that constitu- tion from having the obligation of my contracts violated, if the legis- lative power can create a contract for me, or render binding upon me a contract which was null and void in its creation? To give efficacy to a void contract, is not, it is true, violating a contract, but it is doing in- finitely worse; it is advancing to the very extreme of that class of arbi- trary and despotic acts which bear upon individual rights and liabilities, and against the whole of which the constitution most clearly intended to interpose a protection commensurate with the evil." 9 Yet, in these two views we have two sides of the same question of legislative func- tion.60 holders are derived, but operate to enforce a right acquired subsequently, and capable of existing consistently with those acquired under the laws of Virginia. I cannot admit, that it was ever the intention of the framers of this Constitution, or of the parties to this compact, or of the United States, in sanctioning that compact, that Kentucky should be forever chained down to a state of hopeless imbecility-embarrassed with a thousand minute discriminations drawn from the common law, refinements on mesne profits, set-offs, etc., appropriate to a state of society, and a state of property, having no analogy whatever to the actual state of things in Kentucky-and yet, no power on earth existing to repeal or to alter, or to effect those accommodations to the ever-varying state of human things, which the necessities or improvements of society may require." 56 Lessee of Livingstone v.

While Congress, as the successor of sovereign power, had to be assured of the capacity to act for the common good to avoid the petty irritations of clashing localized interests, a belief in judicial fallibility rather than omnipotence seemed to be Johnson's prime qualification as a judge who was to pass upon these questions. The assumption that judges without facts to go by could more effectively and competently than the other departments deal with the problems of government was not shaken until the year 1908 when the Supreme Court decided the case of Mul- ler v. Oregon.62 In that case the Court for the first time said that it could take judicial notice of facts of common knowledge in order to find out if there was a basis for legislation. But even that case, though it seems now inevitable, was the fortuitous result of the pressure of social events upon the judicial machinery. A rule of evidence came to the rescue of our constitutional system. Thus, what really happened was an extension of judicial competency and fitness by resort to the technical legal mechanics then available. Because he realized the limitations of the judicial function while he steadfastly asserted the independence of the judicial department, he re- fused to match power for power with the legislative and executive de- partments, or to partake of the idea that under our Constitution the unscientific state of affairs was to prevail that power checked by power will per se result in good government. Even when the conflict was one between private individuals, he consistently recognized the right of the parties to deal amongst themselves, to make their own contracts unless there was a supervening social reason why the individual right had to be modified. The relationship of contract between two parties may be said in a real sense to create the smallest unit of government. The Court is not a party to the agreement of the parties to the contract in its inception but enters into the scene at a later stage. The Court acts upon what the parties have embodied into language form by their inter- communication and must, in the main, accept such communications as it finds them. "We are not to inquire into the reasons which govern them in forming such contracts, or competent to judge whether any other mode of complying with a contract may not be as convenient to them as l6 Ramsay v. Allegre, 12 Wheat. (25 U.S.) 611 at 616 (1827); and Johnson's unpublished opinion in The Amanda on Circuit, Charleston, S.C. City Gazette of January 18, 1822. 62 208 U.S. 412, 28 S.

The dynamic reason for noninterference, therefore, is here of the same origin as his unwillingness to obstruct the free activities of legislators and executives. The courts are supposed to sit in judgment upon the communications of others in relation to facts and do not create or choose the events, experiences and communications upon which their judg- ments operate. The temptation to do what is not within the Court's function is what leads to the rationalization of decisions by means of court opinions, to contradictions between action and statement. That Johnson should lean in favor of legislative power would ap- pear to be a necessary consequence of his constitutional thinking, but it is also explainable upon psychological grounds. The transition from a government by a personal sovereign to the more abstract idea of popu- lar sovereignty was not for Johnson or for anyone else simple in fact or theory. One can imagine by comparison what changes the mind of an ancient Greek would have to undergo to accept a transfer from an anthropomorphic Zeus to a monotheistic deity. Since the Supreme Court was restricted by the Constitution in the exercise of its own power, it was natural to expect an identification with power in that body which was the direct agent of the sovereign people and was capable of the widest exercise of power. The power to act had been traditionally exercised by the king and his colonial governors and the residue of a personal element was preserved by the adherence to the concept of sovereignty, an abstract surrogate of personal government. But it was, obviously, not the old fashioned sovereignty since a legislature, constituted under a constitution, can exercise no powers "inconsistent with the instrument which created it. The will of the people had decreed otherwise, and the interests of the individual cannot be affected by the exercise of powers which the people have forbidden their legislature to exercise." 4 This, of course, is a far cry from Johnson's remark that the legislature was omnipotent.65 Nevertheless, we find at this very point the most painful realization of the unenviable dilemma in which a court finds itself, when it must remain comparatively inactive while the sovereign acts. It is this very same dilemma, so basic in all of life, which most clearly explains Lord Coke's violent quarrel with his sovereign, who sought to undermine the jurisdiction of the common law courts. 63 Lanusse v. Barker, 3 Wheat. (i6 U.S.) IoI at 144-145 (1818). 64 Green v. Biddle, 8 Wheat. (21 U.S.) I at 98 (1823). 65 United States v. The Pirates, 5 Wheat. (18 U.S.) 184 at 198 (1820). THE UNENVIABLE DILEMMA 82I 1944 }</page><page sequence="20">MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW The fact, however, that Johnson disapproved of the "gradual ad- vancement to absolute despotism" 6 in the colonial governments, that he deprecated the exercise of caprice in deliberative assemblies, fur- nishes us clues to his frank confession of judicial fallibility-kings and legislators are fallible and so, likewise, are judges. Hence, he did not yield to the temptation to exercise the power which others had abused. That he knew the weaknesses of personal government did not render him as a judge ipso facto more competent and fit to perform the same tasks which others had not done well. The judges were not equipped to step into the shoes of those who had been appointed by the Constitution to the task of actually governing. IV COMPETENCY OF ADMINISTRATIVE BODIES It must follow, as a next step, that judges are not yet prepared to invade the functions performed by technical administrative agencies and departments. The quarrel between the judiciary and such agencies has been rationalized into a fight for power; but really the greater com- petence of administrative bodies with their available technical experi- ence and knowledge-is being matched against the courts which depend mainly on their traditional position and make but little effort to improve their function. As far back as 1884 Mr. Justice Matthews affirmed Johnson's way of looking at the problem when he complained of the invasion by the courts of the sphere of the more competent Patent Office which had been allotted to it by the Congress: ".. The questions of fact arising in this field find their answers in every department of physical science, in every branch of me- chanical art; the questions of law, necessary to be applied in the settlement of this class of public and private rights, have founded a special branch of technical jurisprudence. The investigation of every claim presented involves the adjudication of disputed ques- tions of fact, upon scientific or legal principles, and is, therefore, essentially judicial in its character, and requires the intelligent judgment of a trained body of skilled officials, expert in the vari- ous branches of science and art, learned in the history of invention, and proceeding by fixed rules to systematic conclusions."67 66 I WILLIAM JOHNSON 34. 67 Butterworth v.

The largest group of judges thinks in terms of judicial power and col- lective solidarity of the judicial department. It is feared by these judges that the traditional power of the courts will be weakened by turning over any portion of their former powers to other agencies. The federal district judges, as contrasted with the federal judges of the higher courts, have been most insistent in their adherence to the notion of judicial power. An excellent illustration is the controversy which ensued when the American Law Institute proposed its Youth Correc- tion Authority Act, the most outstanding step forward in criminology and penology which has yet been formulated. Section I3 (g) of the proposed act provides that in case of imprisonment for a period of time less than life, the judge shall commit the offender to the Authority. The district judges refused to recommend such a bill to Congress for the reason that it took the sentencing power away from the courts and as a result a bill has been recommended which leaves it discretionary with the judge to sentence the youthful offender to the custody of the Authority. This means, of course, that power is made supreme over competence. Typical of such an attitude are District Judge Merrill E. Otis's remarks opposing cutting down the sentencing power of the courts: "I never heard of a judge," says Judge Otis, "who would not gladly make use of every aid Congress may see fit to give him. In that rare case where a medical or psychiatric report would be useful, the judge will be glad to use it. If it is desirable that judges should know what sentences other judges impose, the administrative office or the department of justice can give them that information. ... If the judges should read books on penology, give them the books. They will be read and understood."68 The assumption that reading a book is an adequate substitute for a scientific body of criminologists is hardly borne out by what is found in Frederick Joseph Gaudet's enlightening mono- graph on Individual Differences in The Sentencing Tendencies of Judges.69 Then there are those who believe that the competence of the courts will be enhanced by improving the procedural aspects of the law, that 68 Otis, "Proposed Federal Indeterminate Sentence Act," 25 AM.

Undoubtedly, such steps were much needed and important advances have been made in the simplification and improvement of legal procedures in the last quarter-century. Sir Henry Maine once spoke of the power of "alter- ing rules when they chafe." '7 New rules of procedure for the most part usually do not embody any really novel or dynamic approaches in the functioning of judicial process. A third point of view recognizes that the courts have traditionally been the referees, the umpires, the arbitrators and the resolvers of conflict but that they have been hampered by an inadequate presenta- tion of all the facts applicable to a sound solution of controversy. Not only the parties but society as a whole is affected by many such con- troversies, particularly in the field of constitutional law and in other instances where public interests are more directly involved. A recent act of Congress,7 which provides for a certification of cases involving con- stitutionality of an act to the Attorney General of the United States who is permitted to intervene on behalf of the United States, partly takes care of some of such situations. But these judges, who have been reading the complaints of the Su- preme Court on the manner in which matters of public interest are pre- sented, want a more dynamic presentation of facts, so that they will not be compelled to be bystanders to injustices to society as a whole. They seem to sense that it is inevitable that, unless they increase their com- petence, their functions in time will be completely taken over by more competent agencies. Hence, they realistically seek to check this trend by self-improvement. An outstanding example of this attempt to better the functioning of the courts is the opinion of District Judge Wyzanski in a recent case in the District Court of Massachusetts.72 In this case the court per- mitted the United States to intervene in a private suit on a patent li- cense agreement which contained a provision that the defendant would pay royalties and also agree not to sell valves at a price lower than the minimum price set forth in a schedule.

In permitting the intervention, the court said: "Where he presents no new questions, a third party can con- tribute usually most effectively and always most expeditiously by a brief amicus curiae and not by intervention.... "Recent investigations have stressed the extent to which pri- vate patent infringement suits have been used to promote unlawful concentration of economic power.... the private defendant is often helpless adequately to present its case against a monopolistic use of a patent... the experts of the Temporary National Economic Committee recommended that 'provision...be made [for] ... the intervention of the Government in private suits,' Monograph No. 3I, supra, p. 15I. "... there is the danger that the very possibility of intervention may . . . constitute . . . a harassment depreciating the value of patents. That harassment would be undesirable. And yet it is im- portant to remember the ultimate issue that faces patentees is not whether, but where, the public authorities will challenge the use to which patents and licenses have been put. Already there is dis- cussion of a special administrative tribunal as a new forum for the adjudication of such challenges. ... And if the judiciary's tradi- tional place in anti-trust law is to be preserved, it is none too early for the Courts to modify their procedures so that there may be a more realistic trial of the complex issues of economic fact and in- dustrial policy raised in controversies involving alleged unlawful use of patents. Unless we are content that the problems of anti- trust enforcement... be removed from strictly judicial trial and entrusted to administrative tribunals immune, except for egregious errors, from full judicial review, judges must be willing to hear from more than the conventional parties in an adversary proce- dure, to receive expert suggestions from specialized governmental agencies, to accept economic testimony appropriate for laying down a broad rule of industrial government...and to frame decrees suited to the character of the many dimensions of the problem re- vealed.

"It would be a dangerous undertaking," Justice Holmes once warned, "for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the work of pictorial illustrations, outside of the nar- rowest and most obvious limits." 74 Obviously, it is still more dangerous for persons trained only in the law to constitute themselves as final judges on the more vital subjects of human behavior and relationships. The growth of administrative boards certainly demonstrates that Justice Holmes's warning has been heeded by the legislatures and the people, but has not met with suf- ficient favor with the judges and the lawyers. Occasionally we find expressions which indicate new developments. A short time ago Mr. Justice Frankfurter in a concurring opinion in Williams v. North Carolina,75 a case involving the full faith and credit clause as applied to a decree of divorce, warned of the present limited competence of a court for the consideration of the social aspects of a question: "For all but a very small fraction of the community the nice- ties of resolving such conflicts among the laws of the states are, in all likelihood, matters of complete indifference. Our occasional pronouncements upon the requirements of the Full Faith and Credit Clause doubtless have little effect upon divorces. Be this as it may, a court is likely to lose its way if it strays outside the modest bounds of its own special competence and turns the duty of ad- judicating only the legal phases of a broad social problem into an opportunity for formulating judgments of social policy quite be- yond its competence as well as its authority." 76 "Whether judges are equipped by outlook or training to be entrusted with the responsibility for developing and passing judgment upon the rules governing industry is of course another and by far the more interesting question, but curiously enough it has been least discussed in the literature on the subject."

Congress for many years has been delegating responsibility and authority to subordinate agencies, since it cannot accomplish all of the tasks of government. Rate-making for railroads, as an example, is a legislative function, but it has been delegated by the Congress to the Interstate Commerce Commission and by the state legislatures to their various administrative bodies for over half a century. Rate-making does not lend itself to efficient handling on the floor of Congress. Prac- tical necessity brought about the creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission. In the words of Mr. Justice Reed, Congress, when it created this commission, found it more efficient to delegate certain functions "to those whose experience in a particular field gave promise of a better informed, more equitable, adjustment of the conflicting in- terests." 7 It would follow a fortiori that the Court possessed "neither technical competence nor legal authority to pronounce upon the wis- dom" of the course taken by the Interstate Commerce Commission.78 Both Johnson and Jefferson thought in terms of ability and talent, where others were thinking in terms of power. "Untrained people," warned Sumner, "form strong convictions from notions which have been long and firmly held without evidence, and they offer to others the firmness of their own convictions as grounds for accepting the same to discharge the duties cast upon them by patent legislation. The scientific attainments of a Lord Moulton are perhaps unique in the annals of the English-speaking judiciary. However, so long as the Congress, for the purposes of patentability, makes the deter- mination of originality a judicial function, judges must overcome their scientific in- competence as best they can. But consciousness of their limitations should make them vigilant against importing their own notions of the nature of the creative process into Congressional legislation, whereby Congress 'to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts' has secured 'for limited Times to . . . Inventors the exclusive Right to their . . . Discoveries.' Above all, judges must avoid the subtle temptation of taking scientific phenomena out of their contemporaneous setting and reading them with a retrospective eye." The ambivalence of Justice Frankfurter's position is, however, displayed in his dissenting opinion in Federal Power Commission v. Hope National Gas Co., 64 S. Ct. 28I, decided January 3, I944, where he insisted, at p. 299, that it was decided more than fifty years ago "that the final say under the Constitution lies with the judiciary and not the legislature," and, also at p. 299, that Congress had given "only limited authority to the Federal Power Commission and made the exercise of that authority subject to judicial review." 77 Gray v. Powell, 314 U.S. 402 at 412, 62 S. Ct. 326 (I94I); also National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 3I9 U.S. I90, 63 S. Ct. 997 (1943). 78 Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Board of Trade of Kansas City v.

It is not answered by resorting to other prejudices. The overinsistence on traditional judicial solidarity is a legal prejudice because it calls for the exercise of the judicial function in terms of power and jurisdiction rather than aptitude and fitness. There seems to be a feeling prevailing amongst many judges that, if technical com- petence is developed in others, the whole judicial structure will come crashing. This is obviously a defensive reaction conforming to the psy- chological pattern that the intensity of a defense is often proportional to the insecurity. Such fears do not worry the Right Honorable Win- ston Churchill, Prime Minister of Great Britain, and the leader of the Conservative Party, who, in one of his addresses, recently warned that in the future "you cannot conduct a modern community except with an adequate supply of persons upon whose education, whether humani- tarian, technical or scientific, much time and money has been spent." Separation of power under the Constitution has heretofore also meant separation of knowledge. Judicial self-restraint and avoidance were inevitable because the courts had proceeded upon the assumption that intuition can take the place of training. Interestingly enough, in the quaint old Duc of York's case decided in England in 1460, more than three hundred years before the American Constitution, the judges were willing to confess to what courts today are still reluctant to admit. Richard, Duc of York, had brought a writing to the chancellor desiring the writing to be opened to the lords spiritual and temporal assembled in Parliament, claiming title to the crown of England, France and Ire- land. The lords felt that the matter "was so high and of such wyght and poyse" that it was not for the king's subjects to enter into com- munication thereof without the commandment, agreement and consent of the king. After seeing the king, they referred the matter to the king's justices and in the king's name commanded them to search and find what was required to be laid against the claim and title of the duc. The report of the case tells what the justices replied: "Wherunto the same Justices, the Monday, the xx day of Octobr' then next ensuyng, for their answere uppon the seid writying to theym delyvered seiden, that they were the Kyngs Justices, and have to determyne such maters as com before theym 79 WILLIAM GRAHAM SUMNER, FOLKWAYS, C. 5, ? 221 (I913). 828 [Vol. 42</page><page sequence="27">1944 } THE UNENVIABLE DILEMMA 829 in the lawe, betwene partie and partie, and in such maters as been betwene partie and partie they may not be of Counseill; and sith this mater was betwene the Kyng and the seid Duc of York as two parties, and also it hath not be accumtumed to calle the Justices to Counseill in such maters, and in especiall the mater was so high, and touched the Kyngs high estate and regalie, which is above the lawe and passed ther lernyny, wherfore they durst not enter into eny communication therof, for it perteyned to the Lordes of the Kyngs blode, and th' apparage of this his lond, to have communi- cation and medle in such maters; and therfore they humble by sought all the Lordes, to have theym utterly excused of eny avyce or Counseill, by them to be yeven in that matier..." 80 Here we see lack of learning realistically confessed in order to furnish a refuge from conflict with kingly power. This is a well-known pat- tern-that when there is a feeling of inadequacy there is either flight or a compensating quixotic conflict with power or both in combination. Winston Churchill's recent prediction, made in his Harvard ad- dress on September 6, I943, that the empire of the future will be the empire of the human mind, recalls Thomas Jefferson's vow of "eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man." And President Franklin D. Roosevelt has lately reminded us that "men are not prisoners of fate, but only prisoners of their own minds." 8 Such statements may very well cause us to remember that at the beginning of the nineteenth century a justice of the Supreme Court, whom Jefferson greatly admired and respected, began, with such means and understanding as were at his disposal, to apply the sci- ence of the human mind in the solution of the problems which courts must deal with. It may even cause us to wonder at the remarkable insight which prompted Johnson in advance of his time to declare that men conceal their motives of action which "maintain an influ- ence over our conduct, the full force of which we are ourselves un- conscious of."82 Though he did not then know the answer, he did realize that the study of mental processes and human behavior was necessary. More will be needed in the future than is supplied by the notion of the judicial function which-to borrow a phrase from Johnson-con- siders it the prime occupation of the courts "to secure individual right 80 House of Lords, 1460 (Rotuli Parliamentarum, 375) I EUGENE WAMBAUGH, A SELECTION OF CASES ON CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 3 (I914). 81 In Pan American Day address delivered April 14, I939. 82 I WILLIAM JOHNSON 112.</page><page sequence="28">MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW from being crushed in the shock" 3 of conflicting social forces. This is merely power politics applied to the judicial function. Until the judges and the lawyers overcome their resistance to accepting the science of the law as part of the sciences which deal with human behavior and its mental processes, many subjects will be "too high" for them and just so long will the "unenviable dilemma" continue to baffle them. But this dilemma need not be a permanent one if we will only attempt to understand it, to resolve it, and to fathom the dynamic causes which distinguish wisdom from authority and advice from power. 83 Burton's Lessee v. Williams, 3 Wheat. (16 U.S.) 529 at 534 (I8 8). While there may exist differences of opinion as to whether the Supreme Court is not more competent at this time to deal with personal rights than the various legislatures, there can exist no real psychological basis for distinguishing between the rights guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment and the rights guaranteed by the First Amendment. Pierce v. The Society of the Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S. Ct. 571 (I925). Much of the confusion has resulted from the fact that legal procedure has fixed limits as to what facts may be presented in a controversy which usually involves a more complete pers- pective of the relationship of the individual welfare to the public interest. This means, of course, that too much reliance must needs be placed in subjective evaluations. Per- haps, at the present time, there is no other answer than the frank statement of Justice Jackson in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 3I9 U.S. 624 at 640, 63 S. Ct. 1178 (I943). "But we act in these matters not by authority of our com- petence but by force of our commissions. We cannot, because of modest estimates of our competence in such specialties as public education, withhold the judgment that history authenticates as the function of this Court when liberty is infringed." But society cannot be content with such a conception for future ages. 830 [ Vol. 42</page></plain_text>
