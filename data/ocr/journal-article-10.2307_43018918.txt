<plain_text><page sequence="1">Heretics. By Peter Wild. (Madison, Wisconsin: Ghost Pony Press, 1981. 16 pages, $2.00.) Bitter oots. By Peter Wild. (Tucson, Arizona: Blue Moon Press Inc., 1982. 15 pages, $2.00.) Peter Wild apparently wants to be taken seriously as a poet, having had at least eight pamphlets of poetry (that I know of) published by numerous small presses (the most recent being Heretics and Bitter oots) ; and his poems appear frequently in little literary magazines across the country. Nevertheless, the earliest of his two recent pamphlets, Heretics , is little more than an exam- ple of how surrealism (upon which Wild has consistently depended in most of his work) can be pushed so far that the poems become verbal cartoons, mercurially resisting any serious reading. The manner by which Wild perceives and relates to nature is hypertensely anthropocentric (the stereotypical voice of which might be that of Hughes's "Wodwo"), and this perception reveals itself in poems that are frequently anthropomorphic. In other words, Wild seems to be a poet who would willy- nilly paint a funny face on a jar he stumbles upon in the woods of Tennessee (though in his case the woods would be in the Southwest). For example, in Heretics we are told of a "spouting whale out there / grinning . . ." ("Jeal- ousy") ; of "sharks . . . , / with lights dangling from their heads . . ." ("Sal- tines") ; of cacti which, "for years having their own thoughts," and suddenly surrounded by chunks of firewood, "look down, / heretics just caught, astounded . . ." ("Heretics") ; of clouds which become for Wild "school-girls," "newsboys," and then "prisoners playing baseball / ... / swelling up with their own cigarettes" ("Weather"); and of the sun as "that taskmaster" ("Movies"). The few humans depicted in these poems also suffer the poet's cartoon distortions. For example, we are told of an old woman's "hydrophobic daughter galloping out / to chase the redcoats down the road on all fours" ("Farm") , and of "somber diarrhetic Druids . . . / tripping on the dried Span- ish moss of their beards" ("Skin Diseases") . The problem with all this is that the poems seem like inside jokes - and, for their images, ludicrous ones at that.</page><page sequence="2">378 Western American Literature While Wild succumbs to the surrealist's weakness of relying on invention rather than making discoveries, he also seems content to say what sounds substantial without actually taking time to think and be sure it is. For instance, what are we to make of "fog that surrounds ... [a] neighborhood / like a gambler with faith . . . "? Unfortunately, since Wild is not employing his critical faculty nearly enough during the composing process, even invention is occasionally abandoned for the easy echo. Witness, for example, "Movies," the final poem of Heretics , where we are reminded of one of Dylan Thomas's most famous lines (i.e., "After the first death, there is no other," from "A Re- fusal to Mourn the Death, by Fire, of a Child in London") , when Wild asserts that "after the first life / there is another. . . ." Furthermore, there are strong, recurrent echoes of Richard Hugo and James Dickey in Wild's most recent pamphlet, Bitteroots. This second is a more unified collection of poems than Heretic s, for the poet's central concern seems to be the depiction of his southwestern landscape as a backdrop to everything else chat occurs in the poetry; and his regional identity connects one poem to another in tone and texture. Nevertheless, aside from a few sensitive and controlled poems (e.g., "Delirious Heartache," "The Doctor and His Wife," and "Daisies"), in this collection also Wild too fre- quently allows the easy phrase or line to serve in place of hard-won statements of significance. Cliches are often the result. We encounter, for example, explorers who, "having enough of it," are at their "wits' end" ; the poet him- self, waking one morning with a hangover, describes himself as "bug-eyed" ; two hikers spend days in a "never-never land"; and two other hikers are so cold that their "bones rattle." Wild is also repetitious, telling us in one poem about a man "going round and round" in the woods ; and in another poem a "forlorn" hiker's eyes "went round and round." In one poem we are told that mountain "peaks leap up and down" ; and in another the lanscape is dotted with "peaks jumping up and down." As in Heretics , Wild continues to move by a kind of simile-hunting lockstep from the actual into the invented and surreal; and he presents his readers with such things as a "furry rainbow" and "grinning" cows that look "like homosexual baseball players." In "Farm," the first poem of Heretics , the woman who has the "hydro- phobic daughter" grumbles: "A worker should be / worthy of his hire. . . ." Well, this applies to poets also. And like the fence she is dissatisfied with and having replaced, there is too much that is "slipshod" in both Heretics and Bitteroots for me to recommend them. DAVID A.
