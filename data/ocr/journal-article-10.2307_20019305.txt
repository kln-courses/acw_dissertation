<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rel. Stud. 24, pp. 463-482 ROBERT ELLIS GOD AND 'ACTION' That God has acted in history has been, and usually still is, a central Christian affirmation. Its explication has been sought after in a number of ways: by investigating God's relationship to the world, by considering the nature of miracles, by poring over what might be called historiographical problems, by discussing the interrelation of divine and human wills. Each of these approaches has its own worthy place, as do several others. However, what seems to be the obvious preliminary task has often been given less generous space, and is sometimes completely neglected. For how can one use the verb ' to act ' of God at all without first enquiring what we commonly mean when we use it in any other context? without gaining a prior under? standing of what its use seems to imply and entail? This paper attempts to examine the concept of action. It does so with the conviction that such an examination will illumine our use of the concept in a theological context and that, further, it may offer hints as to the way we ought to use the word in such a context. We must be careful to indicate the scope and aims of such a study. We do not seek to resolve in this short space all the problems encountered in the philosophy of action. Instead we will search for some general principles which seem widely accepted and which may be specially relevant to our purpose. The paper is in two sections. In the first we will listen to the scholars and examine the issues, summarising our conclusions as we proceed with a list of 'Theses on Action'. In the second we shall speculate as to the theological application of our findings. 1 Every change is an act or an event, doing, happening. This common dis? tinction provides a useful starting point. Broadly speaking, the difference between an act and an event is that in an act I (or some other agent) do something, whereas in an event something happens to me, or 'just happens'. When I strike a gong, I move and act; when I am struck on the jaw and fall, I am moved but do not act.1 More precisely, an action is only full explicable (and made distinguishable from an event) by an intention.2 To refer to an 1 Such a physical blow may produce a 'reflex action': such a designation is misleading for our discussion. 2 This basic fact is well attested throughout the literature, and a corroborative note would be a bibliography.</page><page sequence="2">464 ROBERT ELLIS act is to refer, at least by implication, to an intention : ' all and only actions have descriptions under which they are intentional'.1 Talk of actions and intentions in this way has sometimes given the im? pression that an intention is a prior, causal entity which precedes and brings about its action. Gilbert Ryle's The Concept of Mind2 argued most strongly against this, and has become a standard - if now slightly dated - work. Ryle argues against what he calls 'the dogma of the ghost in the machine'. He says that if any outward deed has to be preceded by a prior theoretical operation, we would become embroiled in an infinite regress which would leave us paralysed. 'When I do something intelligently, i.e. thinking what I am doing, I am doing one thing not two. My performance has a special procedure or manner, not special antecedents'.3 Ryle's account suggests, helpfully, that when we say 'Are you doing x intentionally'? we are also saying 'Do you know what you are doing, in doing #'? The more a man knows what he is doing, the more he is free and responsible as an agent : the more he acts with definite and clearly formed intention.4 To act is to have an intention - to do something intelligently. The more clear and prominent is one's intention, the more perfectly one is acting.5 Ryle's account was not without its problems however. It seemed too deterministic, too behaviourist. He also seemed ambiguous in his attitude to what we might call 'mental acts'-those actions not involving outward movement, like a sum one does in one's head.6 A much more recent theory which seems to avoid these difficulties has been tendered by Jennifer Hornsby. She says that the statement 'All actions are bodily movements' is sometimes true and sometimes not. 'Move' belongs to a class of verbs which may be used transitively or intransitively, and the different usage is sig? nificant. Action can sometimes be identified with the body's movements in the transitive sense (bodily movementT), but never in the intransitive sense (bodily movementj). It is often possible to answer the question 'what did he do'? by describing some bodily movementT. 'MovementsT cause the body to movex. And actions are movementsT. Thus all actions that are movementsT occur inside the body'.7 Actions that are not bodily movementsT can obvi? ously be spoken of in this way also.8 Without making the intention a prior and inner action, Hornsby has made room for purely internal or mental acts. 1 Donald Davidson, 'Agency', in Agent, Action and Reason ed.

At this stage in our study our purpose will be best served by turning to the ' classic ' modern account of intention - that of Elizabeth Anscombe. Her treatment exposes several key issues. Her case is that intention is neither an antecedent act, nor merely a descriptive term (as Ryle seemed sometimes to urge). It is a form of explanation with its own logic answering to the question 'why?'.1 She is as sure as Ryle and Hornsby that intention is not a prior, interior, causal act. She holds this opinion despite several impressions created by our use of language. We speak of expressing an intention, for instance implying a spatial metaphor. What distinguishes an action as intentional is that it is an action to which a certain sense of the question 'why?' is given application. The 'sense is of course that in which the answer, if positive, gives a reason for acting'.2 This means that when we call an action 'intentional' we are not mentioning any extra feature attached to it, for intention is never (she says) a performance in the mind, and one cannot trace an action back to an intention which initiates or causes movements which occur.3 Already we are in a position to begin our list of'theses': (i) intention is what makes an action an action, rather than an occurrence; (ii) intention is not a separate, prior event causing the act, but rather an integral part of the act. It is, in some ways, its direction; (iii) to intend an action is to be thinking about it. Action, in other words, is rational, thoughtful behaviour. Further development is required. A concept closely allied, and often confused with, intention is that of motive.' Philosophers often distinguish usefully between these notions, while in more casual speech they are sometimes interchanged. Motive has a wider reference than intention. Anscombe states that motives may explain or interpret action, but they do not determine them.4 Neither should motives be confused with what Anscombe calls 'mental causes'. A 'mental cause' is a perceived event which results in a response or action. Anscombe seems to conceive of a mental cause as some sort of 'trigger'. I may be angry at someone, but what makes me angry now (mental cause) is some reminder of their offence. A mental cause need not be a purely mental event (such as a thought, feeling, or image), it may be a physical event which triggers off some mental event - such as when a particular knock on the door reminds me of someone.5 A reference to a mental cause is usually a reference to 1 Intention (Oxford, 1957), pp. 11-28. 2 Ibid. p. 9 3 Ibid. pp. 28-30. Examples could be used which purport to show that sometimes intentions never seem to get beyond our minds - even though they sometimes * shape ' other actions. 4 We might argue that motives limit actions, and thus function as material causes. Motives limit actions by defining the limits of an agent's interest and involvement. 5 At this juncture I see no need to ask whether mental and psychological causes must be distinguished from each other. We allow Anscombe's label to stand.</page><page sequence="4">466 ROBERT ELLIS something past, and this (says Anscombe) is perhaps the source of confusion with motive. There are, roughly, two sorts of motive. Backward-looking motive, like revenge (' I killed him because he killed my brother') ; and motive in general, or 'interpretive motive' ('he did it out of friendship'). A backward-looking motive is distinguished from a mental cause by Anscombe by the involvement of the notions of good and harm (as in revenge, for example), though we may consider her line between motive and mental cause to be drawn in a some? what arbitrary fashion - and the criteria of good and harm seem difficult to apply.1 But she states helpfully, 'I call a motive forward-looking if it is an intention'.2 This provides us with a useful, if crude distinction. In Kenny's words, It is sometimes said that when a reason for acting refers to something prior, or contemporaneous with the action, it is a motive ; when it refers to some future state of affairs to be brought about by the action, then it is an intention.3 Intention, then, seems to be a concept which usually has a future reference. It refers to a particular state of affairs which the agent desires to realize.4 It may be useful to make a further distinction between motive and in? tention. As will already be presumed from our linking of intentionality with 'thinking about', intention must be conscious. An unconscious intention is a contradiction in terms. Motive, however, need not be conscious. Indeed, while all the scholars seem to be agreed that we cannot fail to be aware of our intentions (though we may not articulate them properly), our motive may remain a mystery to us - or at least the subject of some confusion. This necessary consciousness of intention may still obtain even when we have not consciously formed our intention.5 Another key concept in the description of action is that of volition. 'Vol? untary' and 'intention^/' are not synonyms, (a) An act may be voluntary but not intentional if no thought is given to the act, for example doodling.6 (b) Something can be voluntary but not intentional if it is a known con? comitant result of an intetional act which can only be avoided by abandoning the act. That something would be voluntary in the sense that we acted knowing it would happen, but involuntary in the sense that we might have wished otherwise. In either case it is not intentional. The ethicist's Law of Double Effect is a good example of this phenomenon. A surgeon performs an abortion to save a mother's life, and in so doing kills the foetus. He did not intend to kill it, even though he knew the operation to save the mother would 1 Anscombe, pp. 2iff. 2 Ibid. p. 21. 3 Kenny, p. 86; cp. pp. 84, 92, 144.

(d) But every intentional act must also be voluntary (by definition), though it is also in a sense involuntary if for some reason we regret having to do it. 'Reluctant' may be a better word here than 'involuntary'. Duty affords a convenient example. Doing my duty as minister may mean my going to a meeting instead of to a football game: I regret to do it, am in a sense coerced by my obligation, and yet go to the meeting intentionally. We must now, for a moment, retrace our steps. When we looked briefly at the work of Hornsby we saw the beginnings of her position that actions were events inside the body which had an external issue. She goes on to characterise every action as 'an event of trying or attempting to act'.' Trying to act is intentionally acting, though not all tryings reach the 'surface of the body '.' Whereas we usually only say 'he tried to x' if there is an element of doubt of denial in our report, Hornsby thinks that success is a sufficient condition for the term's usage. Agents try to do something in every case where they set out to do it and succeed. One of the advantages of this notion of an act as a trying (or intending) is that it enables us to see that the possibility of failure may be part of our concept of action. 'Within the concept of action', writes Stuart Hampshire, 'lies the distinction between an attempt and an achievement.... One cannot fail to intend to do something'.4 Let us shift the focus of our study for a moment and examine a cluster of issues which may prove theologically important, asking whether an agent may be held responsible for an act which fails, i.e. one which has an outcome other than the intended one. Austin Farrer says that when we plead an error or an accident we say that we did not 'do' something in the full sense of 'do'. He considers this a sound legal excuse, as legal responsibility depends upon wilful intention.5 This might seem much in accord with our stress on the intentional nature of action, but in fact to accept Farrer's statement and universalise it to cover all contexts of 'responsbility' for action would be a rather misleading simplification of the position. It is true that the law seeks to establish the mens rea (intention) as well as the actus reus (act done), but the law recognises that lack of intent to do the act done is not the whole story - if it were, juries would never convict of manslaughter. Here a defendant is found culpable even though he did not intend the outcome. Two examples may make the matter clearer. A driver runs down a pedestrian because his car has gone out of control. ' So far as I know, this 'Law' has not been invoked directly in theodicy. 2 Hornsby, p. 33. 3 Ibid. p. 34, where the question of unactualized intention is tackled. 4 Hampshire, pp. I 70f, I82f, I92f. Of course, to try to act in some way is sometimes actually to act in another: Hornsby, pp. 38-44. 5 Austin Farrer, The Freedom of the Will (London, I958), p. 257. Cp. Anscombe pp. 9I-3. 18 RES 24</page><page sequence="6">468 ROBERT ELLIS Is he responsible? (a) Where the inability to control results from previous (intentional) behaviour which was within his control, then he is responsible. If our driver is drunk, and drank himself so, then he is responsible for the injury. (If his drink had been 'laced' the situation is more ambiguous.) (b) Where the driver's inability to control is no fault of his own, but he could have avoided putting himself in a hazardous situation, he may still be found responsible. Perhaps the driver is an epileptic, or has a heart condition, and has been advised not to drive. Taken ill at the wheel, he is responsible, (c) But it may be that the circumstances are in every way beyond the control of the driver. Perhaps in this case he was overcome by fumes from the engine. If anyone is responsible, it may be the car manufacturer, or the driver's garage. The principle which seems to emerge is that where matters are properly and genuinely beyond the agent's control, he is not to be held fully responsible. It is tea time in our other example. I reach over the table to take some cake, and spill the milk jug over my wife's new dress. Is her wrath justified? After all, I did not mean to do it. Few would have much sympathy for me, but why? This act was in no way voluntary, but I am only spared responsi? bility for an 'involuntary action ' if the involuntary aspect of the act is beyond my control. In the action of reaching over the table, there was some intention, albeit not for spilling the jug. Such a side-effect of spilling may be due either to a lack of thinking through the logistics of obtaining cake (I ought to have realized that my sleeve would catch the jug), or to sheer carelessness (I might have worked everything out for the manoeuvre, only to exhibit total incom? petence). Either way, I am responsible for the spilling because firstly, at no time was a relevant circumstance out of my control - we will assume that I did not start at a loud crash from the street - and secondly, I was conscious, rational, and acting intentionally. This illustration parallels the murder/ manslaughter distinction. If these two examples clarify certain issues, a third extends our coverage yet further. Someone might act intentionally and in good faith, and yet still be 'found guilty', be held responsible. A man might run away with a woman from the office. He does not know that she is married, and that he has helped break up a family's life. He did not intend it, and perhaps he would not have acted in the same way if he had known all the facts. The exact extent of responsibility in this rather far-fetched example and in other more probable ones, seems to depend upon factors difficult to quantify, i.e. whether, and how seriously, an agent seeks to discover all details relevant to his action. The situation is complicated by the problem of knowing exactly what is relevant, something more obvious in some situations than others.1 Lack of intention is not enough to absolve an agent of responsibility - 1 The law, of course, says that ignorance is no defence.</page><page sequence="7">GOD AND ACTION 469 intention, that is, for the particular resultant state of affairs. P. J. Fitzgerald is nearer the mark than Farrer, when he indicates that the law will not convict on an involuntary, rather than on an unintentional, act - but still qualification is needed, as our examples have shown. We have already seen that 'involuntary' is not the same as 'unintentional', so that this statement of legal requirement seems broader and more satisfactory.1 But intention does still need careful consideration, for if lack of it is not needed to convict, one cannot usually claim credit for an act without having had an appropriate intention in performing it. If a jury is to find someone guilty of larceny, they must be satisfied that the defendant intended (at the time of taking) perma? nently to deprive the owners of their property ; for a jury to convict of murder, it must be satisfied that the defendant intended to take another person's life. The need of intention in ascription of responsibility can vary, according to the act under consideration. Many criminal definitions, like the two just mentioned, have 'intention' built into them. Certainly, in ordinary everyday affairs no one credits another with a good act unless positing some intention on their part. Intention radically alters the character of an action which may appear to be just the same as another: this is what is so unsatisfactory about theories which totally externalize action. Again a simple illustration makes the point. Three men are walking down Cornmarket Street in Oxford, all going towards Carfax and each of them carrying a carving knife. Externally, the three acts appear identical, but if we consider the intentions of the three men we will realize that the acts are radically different. One is walking to an appointment in the High Street with an associate whom he intends to stab to death. He may perhaps be arrested for just this intention which he is beginning to actualize. True, all that he has done so far is walk along the road with a knife, but if the police knew of his intent they would be able to arrest him. Legally the first man is punishable even now.2 Legally the act is punishable ; morally it is despicable. The second man is walking back to his car in St Aldate's. He had been planning (intending) to stab his associate to death outside the Ashmolean Museum, but has been filled with feelings of forgiveness, and has changed his mind. Perhaps he can still be charged for his intention often minutes ago. Legally the act is ambiguous; morally, the act of his walking up the Cornmarket with a knife is praiseworthy, for a 'sinner has repented'. (This may show, incidentally, that useful though a legal model often is in discussing problems of action, it is not universally helpful.) The third man has just bought a new carving knife so that he may 1 In A. R. White, The Philosophy of Action (Oxford, 1968), p. 120. 2 While intention is not causally prior, yet the intention to murder precedes the completed act. There clearly come a 'point of no return' in our actions. Intending properly begins to change my acting immediately I start intending it, so that in some sense it is being actualized as soon as it is intended. Knox, Action (London, 1968), p. 97: 'The decision to act is the beginning of the action, not the last step before the action starts'. 18-2</page><page sequence="8">47? ROBERT ELLIS carve the joint more easily, and is walking back to his bus-stop. Legally this act is above reproach; morally, it seems neutral. This example highlights how intention changes the character of an act; or more precisely, how intention largely constitutes an act for what it is. We are now in a position to clarify two more issues which arise regarding the nature of intention. The first is this : one can act intentionally by not doing anything at all, as when I remain sitting when the Queen enters the room. When one does not do something intentionally, or when one can have been reasonably expected to have done something, one can be held responsible. Theologically, we might be talking of sins of omission. The second point is that of habitual action. Suppose someone were to say of an action 'that act is not intentional, it is only routine ' ; would they be justified in the assumption that the two predicates were mutually exclusive? A brief example will show that they are not. A man thinks about jogging each morning before break? fast : he thinks it will do him good. For a week or two he considers the relevant questions for his decision. He chats with his wife about re-scheduling break? fast; he talks to his doctor about health risks and gains; he examines a map for an appropriate route; he costs running kit, etc. Then he decides that he will jog each day. Let us suppose that this decision was made one year ago, and that he is now running every day as a matter of routine. Is his running intentional? Of course, it is. He no longer wrestles with the question, no longer assesses evidence pro and con, but he still jogs intentionally, even if habitually. Life would be too much for most of us if we had to make every routine decision over and over again. Indeed, if our runner agonised afresh each day we might think him somewhat ill. Life would soon degenerate if he went through his arguments again and again, and lay awake at nights worrying. True - he may get up one morning and see two feet of snow, or feel unwell, and decide not to go out that day. But such fresh intentions are the product of extraordinary circumstances. A further summary seems in order, (i) Intention is what makes action an action in the full sense of the word; (ii) intention is not a prior cause, but an integral part of action; (iii) to intend an action is to be thinking about it; (iv) intention (unlike motive) has an essential future reference, it seems; (v) intention must be conscious; (vi) we are given an intention as a proper answer to certain questions 'why'? asked of an action; (vii) 'intentional' and 'voluntary' are not synonymous, though they overlap to some extent; (viii) the concept of action may include within it the recognition of possible failure; (ix) habit or routine does not preclude that that activity is inten? tional; (x) agents may be deemed responsible for the effects which are intended by them or which (if unintended) they might have been reasonably expected to avoid, i.e. if the effects were not beyond the agent's control. Some of these ' theses' wilj obviously prove more important than others, but for the moment we list them all equally.</page><page sequence="9">GOD AND ACTION 471 Before our examination of ' action ' can be complete there are still a few vital concepts to examine. The first is that of'basic actions'. This notion was first mooted by Arthur Danto, who contended that there are some things that an agent does which do not first require him to do anything else ; other acts, however, require another 'doing' for them to be done. If an agent performs a basic action he performs nothing first that causes it to happen.1 For Danto, bodily movements are a primary instance of basic action. Each agent has his 'repertoire' of these basic actions which he can perform without first doing another action. Danto's seminal essay has received much attention, though his definitions now seem somewhat crude. There have been several 'refinements' of his position, one of the most significant of which is that of Jennifer Hornsby. She distinguishes between two notions of ' basicness ' in action : causal and ideo? logical.2 We do not normally talk of a man's doing something causing his doing of something else, so what is 'causal basicness'? Two examples throw the issue into relief. I might (intentionally or not) cause myself to write to a friend by summoning up an image of him. This causes my writing the letter. Summoning the image is 'more basic' than writing the letter. But when I enter a dark room and put on the lights, we do not say that I cause myself (intentionally or not) to turn on the light by flicking the switch. Hornsby goes on from this to adduce three types of basicness : causal (where one action depends causally upon another), preparatory (where two actions are related not causally, but where one is done in preparation for another - e.g. I get my key in order to unlock the door), and compositional (an action may be composed of parts which are in turn actions - to make a cake I perform a series of prior acts). Thus Hornsby seems to 'split' the ideological type into two kinds. This more sophisticated theory hinges upon the way in which one action can be described in different ways, like one act being both flicking a switch and turning on a light. Later on we will see how this language of ' basic actions' may be a useful tool in speaking of God's action. And it will also be important to be able to describe one event-action in different ways. This phenomenon is shown us very effectively in Anscombe, in an example quoted in the literature very frequently. In her illustration a group of Nazis are gathered in a house for a meeting, and a person unknown has put a slow acting poison into the water-tank - by the time they know they are being poisoned, it will be too late. A man is pumping water into the house. What is he doing? He is: moving his arm (A); operating the pump (B) ; replen? ishing the water supply (C) ; poisoning the Nazis (D). All these descriptions are correct, and all the 'actions' are intentional, i.e. each is intended. It is conceivable that in certain circumstances someone might only be doing 'A', 1 Arthur C. Danto, 'Basic Actions', in White, op. cit. pp. 45, 51. 2 Hornsby, pp. 66f.</page><page sequence="10">472 ROBERT ELLIS for instance - that's to say that someone might only be intending A. If we ask the question 'why?' in this situation we could get four answers (A,B,C,D), each one depending on the previous ; four intentions relating to four acts, or (more precisely) four descriptions of the same act. If we were to look for one intention, or one description of the act performed by the agent it would be normal to proceed along the sequence of descriptions to the fullest and most adequate account - in this cse, to 'D' (assuming that he knew the water to be poisoned and the house to be inhabited - in other words, that he really was poisoning the Nazis). ' D ' is the intention with which the other ' acts ' were done. This intention 'swallows up' the previous intentions, so that we can answer 'D' to a question about 'A', while 'B' and 'C tell us how 'D' was done. Some intention may fall outside the sequence 'A'-'D', for example if the man also pumps out the rhythm of'God save the Queen' as he pumps. The important thing is to note that our pumper is doing only one thing: poisoning the Nazis by replenishing the water supply by operating the pump by moving his arm. One doing, not four. 'Moving his arm' is what Hornsby calls the causally basic action. But 'by' is an important word. As Hornsby indicates, we use the word 'by' to form more complex verbs out of other verbs and verb-phrases. Thus the full description above is one complex verb description, the preposition 'by' showing that only one 'doing' takes place. More complex verbs give a fuller account of action. While operating the pumps, there was nothing that the pumper was doing which could possibly count as his poisoning the inhabitants unless it was operating the pump. One action then is capable of many descriptions, and further, these descrip? tions might show the action in different lights. One person may enjoy the actions under one description but not under another. Our pumper may find the physical exertion invigorating, but the poisoning even of Nazis distaste? ful.1 The same 'doing' may look different according to the description or perspective adopted. But we have only discussed one sense in which an action might be said to be complex, i.e. causally complex description. There is another sense of complex, in Hornsby's terms the 'ideologically complex', with a sequence of doing : it may be that for our purpose this type of ' complexity ' may be more significant. Something that we do may be one act, and yet involve a succession of doings or acts- 'sub-acts', if you like. Very often (indeed this is hardly surprising if we take the social nature of human existence into account), such a complex item will be made more complex yet by interaction with other entities and agents. The more complex an action is, in this sense - i.e. the more 'others' involved - the greater the risk of failure (which as we have seen, may be 'built into' action itself) increases. Let me illustrate my meaning, (a) I resolve to sit down. This act involves 1 Oedipus may have enjoyed making love to Jocasta, but not to his mother. The example is Kenny's, pp. 130fr.</page><page sequence="11">GOD AND ACTION 473 myself and a chair. It is relatively simple and the number of things that can go wrong is limited. I may break a leg, or slip, or the chair may be too flimsy to take my weight, but normally the risk is minimal, (b) I may resolve to teach my dog to sit down on the command ' sit ! ' The action of ' teaching my dog to sit ' is more complex than my sitting. Dogs have limited freedom and a certain personality (if you will pardon the anthropomorphism). In the park I must contend with the elements, and with other dogs who will distract Fido from his classes. But, if I have the requisite skill, and if my dog has more or less average propensity for training and discipline, I should succeed, (c) I may resolve to teach my dog to sit by persuading my wife to teach Fido. Now my wife will encounter all the problems mentioned under (b), but before she even comes to them there is the problem of persuading her to do it. Perhaps she is scared of dogs, or agoraphobic, or too busy, or lacking the know-how, or maybe she just does not want to do it! Each time a new element is introduced the action becomes more complex and more risky. This risk is magnified when we deal with free (human) agents. My wife has much more a will of her own than Fido, and is also in a position to apply subtle pressures on me if she does not want to conduct dog-training classes - she may refuse to cook dinner. From these trivial examples the point emerges. Another needs to be noted. We often speak of one person acting through another person or many others. That is, A performsp through the agency of B. In one sense/? is B's act, but we usually think of it being much more A's act. Thus I buy my wife a book for her birthday. I make the purchase by giving specific instructions and cash to a friend. He goes to the shop and hands over the cash, yet the book is my present which I bought. In a similar way we say ' Mrs Thatcher renegotiated Britain's terms of membership with the EEC. We all know that most of the finer details and much of the 'wheeling and dealing' was done by other officials at her behest and guidance. These officials are still responsible for the settlement in a real way (as my friend is responsible for the purchase), though their action may have been limited somewhat by the terms of reference dictated to them. But we still say that it is Mrs Thatcher's act - indeed much more hers than theirs. This is a complex action and one with greater risk of the agent's intention being thwarted because they are entrusted to others. Indeed, we often only talk of the responsibility of my friend or the negotiators for their acts if they botch and fail to actualise the intention of their instruc? tors. If the wrong book is purchased (provided that I gave the correct and clear instructions), it is my friend's fault; if the correct book is bought, it is to my credit. It is J. R. Lucas who points out that outside of philosophy text books, the word 'agent' is commonly reserved for one who acts on behalf of another.1 In terms of the basic/complex distinction which we have been 1 'Freedom and Grace' in his Freedom and Grace (London, 1976), pp. 6f.</page><page sequence="12">474 ROBERT ELLIS adumbrating, Mrs Thatchers basic action was to brief her officials; but her complex action was the renegotiation of terms, even if others (the 'agents' in Lucas' sense) did the actual bargaining. We must attempt to trace responsibility in the case of complex actions too. Mrs Thatcher is responsible for our new EEC terms insofar as they reflect her intentions for the renegotiation. To be responsible for one's own complex action is properly to have one's simpler actions identified as the cause of an upshot; to be responsible for one's simpler actions is only to be properly identifiable as their doer.1 The problem becomes much more ambiguous in the case of failure. If Mrs Thatcher's renegotiation were judged a failure, would she be responsible? If the conclusion was as she had intended, then of course she would be. If not? Either she might be held responsible for aiming unrealistically, or for not briefing her team well enough. But it is just as likely tht the 'fault' will lie with that team, or with the hard-nosed attitudes of the other sides. If on the other hand, the agreement turns out to be much better than she had hoped for or aimed for, then she can hardly take any credit at all. If she was to ask for a -?$b refund, and the Germans open the talks by offering ?j.5b, Mrs Thatcher may be wise to make political capital from the new terms, but they would not be 'her's'. Where we draw the line between one action and another is often somewhat arbitrary. Particular intention can mark off particular action, so that when intention is realised (or when it fails finally) we know that an act is complete. This is another aspect of the importance of intention : it marks off one act from another, so far as it is possible to do so. But often our dividing of life into particular actions is only an expediency. We can nearly always find a 'bigger', more inclusive and complex action description under which to bracket another complex action, and such ever more complex descriptions are commonplace in everyday life. How far was Mrs Thatcher's renegotiation a ploy to achieve good press reports? How much are popular press reports a ploy to 'get away with' more unpopular policies? How far are such policies a means to something else - ' national economic recovery ' ? And so one could go on. In this context we see that intention can play the role of unifying our action and so our whole lives. If someone acted without consistent intention we should describe their behaviour as abnormal. Intention, as well as serving to mark off actions from each other, also provides some continuity and consistency in our action, and gives our actions a certain trajectory.1 There is a sense in which intention, as a continuous expression of character, inte? grates our experience. This experience of intention as integrating our whole lives may lead us to consider our whole lives as, on one level, one highly complex action with a continually modifying intention. This may be too 1 We borrow this definition of responsibility from Joel Feinberg ('Action and Responsibility' in White, op. cit. p. 109), thinking it convenient rather than exhaustive. 2 Hampshire, p. 72 and also p. 133; Farrer, p. 289; MacMurray, pp. 166-9.</page><page sequence="13">GOD AND ACTION 475 speculative, but perhaps in certain individuals' biographies such a descrip? tion may not stretch credulity too far. Such individuals would be much admired and respected, one presumes, and perhaps Christological claims have always implied such a cohesion of action and life. As actions grow ever more complex (with more and more interacting 'agents'), it may be possible to see how MacMurray sees the world as one action and a unity of intention1 - God's. 'The world as one action' is a familiar assertion in the screed on the providential economy of God. How specific is intention as a rule? Kenny says that intention relates to a particular state of affairs in the future,2 and it seems inevitable that when we intend something we have in mind a state of affairs different from that currently existing. A certain specificity, though possibly within certain limits rather than 'spot on' at first, is implied in the very use of the word. 'Intending this' is intending this and not that, else the term seems mean? ingless. It is true that I might, as Hampshire says,3 state may intention roughly, but we should not allow ourselves to be misled by this. At each stage before proceeding, before acting, intention must be determinate. For ex? ample, we say ' X built the hospital ' (a very complex act with many ' agents ' : the only stone X touched was the foundation stone at the opening). He contracted out the design to experts, but they were to work within certain limits. They decide at each step what precisely they will do next; if they do not it will never get built. Insofar as they decide to build the Nurses lodgings in a way which X did not intend specifically, then those lodgings are not Xs act, even if the project as a whole is. Or suppose I say, ' I intend to go to town today, either to read in the library or to watch the football.' What sense does this make? Insofar as it makes any sense at all, it may state my priorities or preference (if a certain book is available,..., if not...), or it may tell that I intend to go to town, but that I have not yet made up my mind, what to do there. But I will have to decide and intend one or the other before either gets done. The first part of our paper draws to a close, and it remains to summarise for the final time our tentative conclusions by adding to, and completing, the lists already given. We will enumerate fifteen theses concerning action, of varying importance and offered with varying degrees of confidence. It is my contention, which I hope to validate and explore briefly in the later part of this paper, that these propositions may yield a rich and suggestive resource for speaking of God's action, (i) Intention is what makes an action an action in the full sense; (ii) intention is not a prior cause, but an integral part of action ; (iii) to intend an action is to be thinking about it; (iv) intention seems to have an essential future element; (v) intention must be conscious even if imperfectly formed or articulated; (vi) we are given intention in reply to 1 Cf Ian T. Ramsey, Models for Divine Activity (London, 1973), ch. 2. 2 Kenny, p. 86. 3 Hampshire, p. 121.</page><page sequence="14">476 ROBERT ELLIS certain questions ' why ' ? about an action ; (vii) ' intentional ' and ' voluntary ' are not synonyms, though they overlap; (viii) the concept of action includes within it the recognition of the possibility of failure; (ix) habit or routine can still be intentional ; (x) agents are deemed responsible for effects which they intend, and for those for which they have no reasonable 'excuse'; (xi) some of our actions may be called 'basic', others 'complex' - though these terms may be used fluidly; (xii) one action can be described in different ways and from different perspectives ; (xiii) the more complex the act the greater the risk of failure, of it not realising its intended effects; (xiv) one agent may act through another agent's free agency, and yet we still say that the act is properly and mostly the act of the first agent, and in certain cases the first agent may be held responsible for the failure of a complex act; (xv) intention must be at least fairly specific, and before acting, completely determinate. 11 The foregoing discussion was, deliberately, diverse. Thus it sought to range widely and formulate its theses on what it is that we imply when we refer to an agent and an action. If we are to go on using the concept in our theological conversations we need to bear in mind the fruits of such analyses as have just been offered. Much is made of the inadequacy of theological language. We speak of God analogically, if at all. No theology could surely exist on this side of Neo-Orthodoxy without realising the enormity of the task of applying human concepts to divine reality. When human concepts are applied to God which aspects do we refuse to apply, and which do we press home? Such issues come to the forefront when considering the agency of God. The purpose in this section is to see whether the theses adumbrated earlier may illuminate what we mean when we speak of God's action, and in what way they might do so. Before we begin this 'application' however, one or two other points need to be made. In our analysis of action we formulated no thesis insisting on a necessary bodily referrent for an action. Such was omitted with good reason: 'It is a familiar observation in recent philosophy that the concept of agency cannot logically be reduced to that of bodily movement'.1 Purposes, aims intentions, cannot be grasped in a purely physical way; it is one thing to say that an action requires some sort of physical locus, but it is quite another to say that a bodily movement always fulfils that role. In some actions no physical change takes place. Peter Donovan points out that some 'actions' cannot be individuated simply by pointing to a human agent because complex mech? anical and institutional machinery are drawn in: as in a pilot's forced 1 Peter Donovan, A Philosophical Analysis of the Doctrine of Providence, with reference to the theology of H.

Some theologians have wished to speak of the world as God's body in order to provide this 'bodily referrent' for divine action and involvement,1 but there may be good reasons for proceeding with the utmost caution. If we do start talking of the world as God's body we might undercut his transcendence or independence in some way. The world does not display the degree of unity which a human body possesses. A body has an external environment as an important feature of its definition : what would be God's external environ? ment if the universe were his body? Since, in a discussion of'action', it seems that a bodily referrent is not absolutely necessary it seems to invite trouble to push the point either way here. We need not commit ourselves. It may well be a helpful metaphor, in certain respects, to speak of the world as if it were God's body, but no more need be said on the question here.2 It is also as well to note that one of our propositions bears an important corollary which was also touched upon earlier. Thesis (x) 'Agents are deemed responsible for effects which they intend ' carried with it the corollary that an agent may not claim credit for an effect unless it was intended by that agent. This is another way of saying that the agent must have done something without which the act would not have been, at least in its present form. This is an important point to remember with respect to God's action. Without God's act, this event E would not be as it is, or was. Our account of God's action must make sense of this - how God 'contributes' to an act which we call his, and how he makes it what it is. The need to draw out this issue arises because of the very loose way in which some theologians are willing to speak of God's action. For them, a particular event is perceived as bearing meaning or significance, as expressing the character or purpose of God in some way. Yet such assertions can be made to sound very good without possessing any meaningful content. The suggestion that God had particular intention for a particular outcome is not given prominence, let alone is there any discussion of how God might effect such an intention.3 If we are going to speak of an action as God's action we have to explain it in terms of his intention and his effecting that intention. This leads us into the next issue which arises. Some argue hard for agnosticism concerning the ' mechanics ' of divine action.4 Peter Donovan shows the path which leads to the desire to ask for an explanation of these mechanics : if God cannot employ the ' normal ' means of agency, can we continue to ascribe action to him without some other explanation?5 Donovan advocates agnosticism and reminds us that there are other actions (e.g. basic actions, speech acts) for which we can offer 1 Process theologians have been in the forefront of late in these developments. W. D. Hudson's work is also notable, as is Grace Jantzen's recent fine study God's World, God's Body (London, 1984). 2 Process theologians offer such a 'locus' in God's consequent or concrete nature. 3 The work of Schubert Ogden, Gordon Kaufman and Maurice Wiles is in my mind. 4 Austin Farrer, Faith and Speculation (London, 1967), p. 66. 5 Donovan, pp. 2i4f.</page><page sequence="16">47^ ROBERT ELLIS no modus operandi. He ends up saying that God's actions are 'basic actions' in Danto's sense, i.e. that there is no causal mechanism involved - God just does them! If this appears to be a position adopted arbitrarily it is an impression heightened by the qualifications which he goes on to add.1 While Donovan warns well of the dangers of trying to spell out too much the means of divine action, his 'solution' is representative in its inadequacy. Clutching at straws as he is, it is difficult to know whether he has opted for a pious Fideism, or a rather unholy playing with words. We may in fact want to question the assumption that God does not use the ' normal ' means of agency, though in raising this question one would also want to raise an implicit distinction between 'form' and 'substance'. One of the attractions of the conceptuality offered by Whitehead and the Process theologians is the way in which it enables us to conceive of God's action as formally the same as all action - indeed, of 'action' being the root of all reality. Elsewhere I have explicated Whitehead's theory of action, and more fully interpreted the results of my analysis of action using the concepts and terminology of the Process Theologians.2 To assert that God's action may be understood as formally the same as our own is to assert also the funda? mentally analogical nature of our theological language, but may not necess? arily prejudge the question of the application of that language. Clearly, if we are to apply a number of theses to God, then we may need to say something about the sort of God to which we are attributing the theses. A full-blown doctrine of God at this point is as impracticable as it is un? necessary. We shall proceed with an undefined, general concept of God and ask what might be implied about his action were we to speak of it in terms of the propositions adumbrated in the previous chapter. Thus for God to be said to act in the fullest sense (i.e. fuller even than human action, as ours is fuller than any so-called 'natural agency')1, he should have (i) an intention for a particular state of affairs. God's act (ii) is his intention for an event (in Whiteheadian terms we might be talking of the 'initial aim'). We need hardly say that God is able (iii) to think about his acts far more rationally and with much greater vision than we. God's intention has (iv) future reference i.e. (xv) it is directed to a specifically desired state of affairs: he intends this, not that. God (v) is conscious of his intention, and (vi) state? ments of his intentions are the way of giving answers to questions 'why?' asked of certain events, (vii) All God's intended acts are voluntary, indeed it is difficult to give a satisfactory account of how God might be constrained. The only ways in which God's acts can be considered involuntary are perhaps (a) because of states of affairs in the world which God wishes were 1 Ibid. pp. 2i9f. 2 Unpublished D.Phil, thesis, University of Oxford 1984, 'Can God act in History? A Whiteheadian Perspective. ' 3 Farrer, Freedom of the Will, chs ix and xv.</page><page sequence="17">GOD AND ACTION 479 not so, and which he must ' take into account ' in acting - this is certainly not a strong sense of'involuntary'; (b) if the best for a given situation which God is able to intend for it will still bring inevitable discord and suffering. Again, this is hardly a strong sense of involuntary. God is responsible (x) for all events which occur according to his intention for them and as a result of his intention for them. Such an act is his act (as the renegotiation of terms is Mrs Thatcher's act). He is also responsible for effects which he could reasonably have been expected to have prevented from occurring, i.e. if they are not beyond his control. An agent is responsible if what he did made the act what it was. For an act to be God's act he must have intention for it and have made it what it was. Mrs Thatcher would not be credited with renegotiation unless she had been the impulse and force behind the agreement. Clearly, such an analysis has a clarifying effect on our theodical discourse. Of course, it leaves crucial questions untouched, but it opens up others. This discussion of responsibility and credit does not have of itself anything to say about what God might be ' reasonably expected ' to do or to prevent, though later theses may. In the examples of the last paragraph we have been assuming (xi) the distinction between basic and complex actions. God's basic actions are the simple offerings of himself to his creatures in love, in which he may offer (though it will not often be acknowledged consciously) his intention and influence. God acts in this basic way on every existing thing at every instant. He loves everything instantly, without doing anything else. Such an action is, as it were, irresistible : he does it to us whether we like it or not, whether we notice it or not, and he goes on doing it. Such would be the content of much of our talk about providence. But God also acts in a complex way, involving the realising of his intention through other free agents. This insight is a common one in theological discussion, though it is not always made with conceptual clarity: we are here talking about 'Double Agency'. God can act (xiv) through the free agency of another, and yet we may still say that it is properly and mostly his act. And (xiii) from the point of view of Moses the Red Sea escape was one thing; from God's, and the Egyptians' view, it was something else. By one description, Moses led the people out, by another God did so; by one description it is perhaps an act of judgement, and by another one of salvation. We must recall what was said concerning the nature of complex actions : they bring with them the increasing possibility of failure (viii, xiii). Some will not countenance such a suggestion in this context. R. H. King is an example. His study of ' action ' is stimulating and insightful. He even comes somewhere near our idea of more complex acts being more fraught with risks.1 But he does not try to develop the distinction he makes between large-scale and 1 The Meaning of God (London, 1968), p. 62.</page><page sequence="18">480 ROBERT ELLIS small-scale acts in relation to God. And he seems to rule out in advance any thought of God 'failing' in any sense. If Stuart Hampshire is right that 'within the concept of action lies the distinction between an attempt and an achievement',1 and if the possibility of failure is 'written into' action, then traditional theology faces a stiff challenge if it wants to go on using the concept. Especially when we propound a theory of God's complex action in history, using a variety of free agents, then the task seems to demand our recognition that as acts get more complex, they also get more 'risky'. What are we to do? Some would analogise the problem away. The 'concept of analogy', they would say, 'removes any human limitations when applying a concept to God'. But is this really so, and how do we recognise a truly human limitation? Is the possibility of failure to actualise an intention a human limit, or is it knit into the very fabric of action? And does it make a difference if that 'failure' is caused by incom? petence on the part of the agent, or the breakdown of cooperation of other free agents in a complex action? Clearly the former would not seem an appropriate allegation to lay at God's door; the latter is a rather different case. Ian Barbour turns aside from the agents model of God on this very question - that it prohibits, he assumes, creaturely freedom.2 But if our theses (viii) and (xiii) are anywhere near the mark, Barbour may be misguided : the very thing he sees as threatened by the agency model may be integrally preserved within it. MacMurray says that The possibility of action depends on the Other being also agent, and so upon a plurality of agents in one field of action. The resistance to the Self through which the Self can exist as agent must be the resistance of another Self.3 This would seem to indicate that it may be useless to attempt a conception of God's agency unless we envisage this agency as operative among other autonomous agents. Perhaps there is another way to apply analogy, rather than hacking our concepts about at will. We could apply it a fortiori to God. Thus, for instance, King would be right to suggest that God's agency is superior, or universal in scope, but not to consider that in some respects (i.e. perfect efficacy of both basic and complex acts) it is totally unlike ours.1 God's basic actions cannot fail, but his complex actions are inevitably more precarious. We suggest then, that 'action' may well include within it the notion of possible failure and the reader will have already surmised our willingness to apply theses (viii) and (xiii) to God. Perhaps the one thesis which does not seem to ' fit ' is fairly innocuous, and may be applied in a modified form. It is not so much that (ix) (relating to habit 1 Hampshire, p. 170. 2 Ian C. Barbour, Myths, Models and Paradigms (London, 1974), p. 161. 3 MacMurray, p. 145. 4 King, pp. 90fr.</page><page sequence="19">GOD AND ACTION 481 or routine) does not apply, but that it seems irrelevant. It is not clear whether it can be meaningful to talk of divine routine or habit at all. One presumes that God is aware of his intentions and of what he is doing. But there is a sense in which we may be confident even here: God's aim and intentions are constant, and he is always acting (basic) and seeking to act (complex) according to his constant love. What this paper has sought to do is to tease out the various components of the concept of action as we use it in ordinary speech. We saw that that concept is a rich, multi-faceted one. To some extent that analysis, standing on its own, may be of use when read through a ' theological eye'. In the later part of the paper we tried to locate some of those components in our talk about the divine agency. Some topics close to the heart of the issue have not been mentioned,1 others have received scant attention. Some of the more 'controversial' results of our investigation have been dwelt on a little more, and in some respects they reflect other movements in theological trends. Some will draw back from such a detailed anaysis of what is after all an analogy. Others will see that if we are really serious about God-talk, and determined that it be not plainly equivocal, then we must either use the concept of action in a recognisable, and continuous, sense - or perhaps abandon its employment altogether. Neither path may be easy. 1 E.g. the question of temporality - see R. G. Swinburne, The Existence of God (Oxford, 1979), pp. 936?.</page></plain_text>
