<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORICAL SOCIETY OF NIGERIA VOL. IV NO. I DECEMBER 1967 A LIST OF SITES, BUILDINGS AND OTHER ANTIQUITIES DECLARED TO BE MONUMENTS UNDER THE ANTIQUITIES ACT FROM FEBRUARY 1956 TO DECEMBER 1964 by K. C. Murray Department of Antiquities the Monuments are numbered consecutively according to the order of pub- lication in the Official Gazette from which the descriptions (in capital letters) have been copied. The dates following each official description is the date of designation as a monument. The further descriptions have been compiled, from sometimes rather inadequate information, in the official files of the De- partment of Antiquities. References to any published descriptions have been included or added. 1. THE STONE-BUILT CAUSEWAY AT FOROF, NEAR BOKKOS IN PLATEAU PROVINCE, TOGETHER WITH AN AREA OF LAND INCLUDING THE STREAM, WITHIN A RADIUS OF THREE HUNDRED FEET OF THE CENTRE OF THE CAUSEWAY. (16.2.56) 2. THE STONE-BUILT CAUSEWAY AT TADING, NEAR BOKKOS IN PLATEAU PROVINCE, TOGETHER WITH AN AREA OF LAND INCLUDING THE STREAM WITHIN A RADIUS OF THREE HUNDRED FEET OF THE CENTRE OF THE CAUSEWAY. (16.2.56) 3. THE STONE-BUILT CAUSEWAY AT BATURA, NEAR BOKKOS IN PLATEAU PROVINCE, TOGETHER WITH AN AREA OF LAND INCLUDING THE STREAM, WITHIN A RADIUS OF THREE HUNDRED FEET OF THE CENTRE OF THE CAUSEWAY. (16.2.56) The origin of these three structures is obscure but the evidence suggests that they were built certainly before the arrival of the Ron tribe in the Bokkos District, a date considered to be between 1 50 to 200 years ago. The present inhabitants, who are (or were) capable of maintain- ing the causeways in good order, have a tradition that these were in existence when their ancestors came into the country. The remains of some thirty bridges or causeways could still be seen in 1956 including one example of a high level bridge. The three monuments are fifty miles from Jos and can be reached by road or motorable track. (C. K. Meek: The Northern Tribes of Nigeria , London, 1925, Vol. 1, pp. 56-57). 161</page><page sequence="2">4. THE CAIRN OF STONES AT THE FOOT OF PANSHANU PASS, NEAR MILE 31 ON THE JOS-BAUCHI ROAD, KNOWN AS KW ANDON KAYA, WHICH WAS SET UP BY THE ARMY OF THE EMIR OF BAUCHI, YAKUBU I, TO COMMEMORATE THE SUBMISSION OF THE PAGAN TRIBES OF THE PANSHANU HILLS, AND THE SURROUNDING LAND WITHIN THREE HUNDRED FEET OF THE CENTRE OF THE CAIRN. (16.2.56) This monument is remote from any village, although within a few feet of the main Jos- Bauchi road. The following is an extract from a letter written in October 1951, from the Emir of Bauchi : "I enclose a note on the origin of the heap of stones at the foot of Panshanu Pass. As you see, they were collected there before the battle, by the side which eventually lost. "The story of the origin of Kwandon Kaya (Basket of Loads) The people of Kwandon Kaya were serfs from Toro and Tulai who collected themselves together in these hills (Panshanu), some even came from Dass. When they saw that they had become strong and were living in a place which was difficult to attack, they revolted against their district head, Sarkin Yaki (War Chief). The then Sarkin Yaki was Usmanu, and it was in the reign of the Emir of Bauchi, Ibrahimu, that the revolt took place. They became so difficult that even the road could not be followed at night or during the day. It was then that Sarkin Yaki Usmanu approached them and pitched his camp at "Dutsen Sutumi". When they saw that they were strong, they decided to fight it out. They said "anyone among us who can take a bow should bring a stone here." The reason why Sarkin Yaki conquered them was because where he pitched his camp was where their farms were; and so he kept on pulling off their corn. They remained for a year without corn, and hunger overcame them until he conquered them. When he conquered them, he brought booty to the Emir of Bauchi. He captured 2,400 people and the rest escaped and went back to Dass. Now, this is not the only heap of stones, for when the motor road was being constructed the bigger heap was used up. This, in fact, is the small heap. This is the origin of Kwandon Kaya." 5. THE HOUSE AND COMPOUND AT KEFFIN MADAKI, 28 MILES NORTH OF BAUCHI, KNOWN AS GIDAN MADAKIN BAUCHI, WHICH WAS BUILT IN 1860 BY THE CELEB- RATED MASTER-BUILDER BABBAN GWANI OF Z ARIA. (16.2.56) The main hall (and some other buildings) within the compound of the Madakin Bauchi are the work of Babban Gwani, who about the period 1850-60 was renowned in Hausaland for his skill. He died in Birnin Gwari in about 1862 at the hands of his patron who would tolerate no other ruler acquiring a house finer than his own. The building when declared was in an excellent state of preservation, despite receiving practically no maintenance. Recently, however, a great deal of work on it has been carried out by the Department of Antiquities. The zaure or entrance hall is a room 31 ' x 28' and has a flat roof supported on four massive square columns. Nine bays are formed by the heavy beams which link the columns and the adjacent walls. The beams and roof are constructed in azara timbers and mud. The babban gwani or main hall is fitted with leather-covered doors. On the east side of the main hall is an ante-room. It is approximately 20' x 15', and its roof is supported with one central beam. The walls surrounding the structure vary in size. The south side perimeter wall is approxi- mately 44' long and 15' high, and has been perodically restored. The north-east perimeter wall is about 3 1 ' long and 20' high. Adjacent is the Mosque, the construction of the interior of which is similar to that of the zaure of Gidan Makama, Kano. 162</page><page sequence="3">6. THE ROCK SHELTER CONTAINING POLYCHROME CAVE PAINTINGS IN THE HILL KNOWN AS DUSTSEN MESA AT BIRNIN KUDU IN KANO PROVINCE, AND THE LAND WITHIN A RADIUS OF THREE HUNDRED FEET OF THE ROCK SHELTER. (16.2.56) Birnin Kudu is approximately 84 miles south-east of Kano, on the main arterial road to Bornu. In January 1954, the Chief of the town of Birnin Kudu reported a small painted rock shelter to a touring Administrative Officer. It was in this manner that Nigerian rock paintings were brought to attention. The first group of paintings, on the hill known as Dutsen Mesa, is only about a hundred feet from the old motor road, and even closer to the pedestrian path. A masonry wall surmounted by a mesh screen has been built by the Antiquities Department to prevent the paintings from being touched. The paintings, four main styles and four sub-styles, are exclusively of domestic cattle with the exception of a single enigmatical drawing which may possibly be a sketch plan of a cattle kraal. Two main types of cattle are pictured: a long-bodied, long-legged humpless breed with long spreading or converging, sometimes lyre-shaped horns, and a short thick-bodied, short- horned humpless breed. Tentatively, they have been identified as hamitic long-horn which is now extinct in Nigeria. It is believed that this hamitic stock left its mark on the characteristic long-horned Zebu cattle of today and on Brachyceros , the short-horned humpless cattle, also known as Muturu. Muturu are found today among the Pagan Tribes inhabiting the hills of the Jos Plateau, similar hill regions of Northern Nigeria, the tsetse-infested rain forest regions of the south of Nigeria, and parts of the riverain provinces. In February 1954, two other groups of paintings were found; In April 1955, a fourth group, and in June 1955, three groups, making a total of seven near Birnin Kudu. The paintings pro- bably belong to the period of transition from Neolithic to the Metal Age. Within a hundred feet of Dutsen Mesa there have been discovered more than ten groups of rock gongs, which are huge natural exfoliations of rock which rest or are wedged in a position favourable to the production of musical notes. It is believed that in most cases the rock gongs were used as ensemble instruments by several players. Further rock gong sites have been located stretching across Northern Nigeria through the Provinces of Sokoto, Zaria, Kano, Plateau, Bauchi and Bornu, to the Northern Cameroons. Rock gongs were used during ceremonies, for entertain- ment, in connection with religious beliefs or, during war-time to warn the farmers of enemy attack. (B. E. B. Fagg. The Cave Paintings and Rock Gongs of Birnin Kudu. Proc. /// Pan- African Congress on Prehistory , London, 1957, pp. 306-312.) 7. THE FIRST MINING BEACON TO BE ERECTED IN NIGERIA, WHICH WAS SET UP AT TILDEN FULANI, AT MILE 14 ON THE JOS-BAUCHI ROAD, BY THE LATE LT.-COL. HENRY WILLIAM LAWS, C.M.G., D.S.O., ON 19TH SEPTEMBER 1905, TOGETHER WITH THE LAND WITHIN A RADIUS OF ONE HUNDRED FEET. (16.2.56) The beacon, which had been overgrown ar.d forgotten, was re-discovered at the end of 1953 when the Plateau was celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the arrival on Christmas Eve 1903 of the first expedition into the closed country of the High Plateau; closed that is to the Fulani and other people who had been at war with the Hill Pagans for as long as anyone could remem- ber, and to the Europeans who were identified with them. The beacon was set up by Colonel Laws, accompanied by his assistants, R. A. Archbold and S. W. Carpenter. It is built of burnt brick with a cement rendering, and bears the initials of the three men, the name of the Mining Company, the Niger Company, and the date 1905. A permanent shelter in masonry, corrugated iron and thatch is built over it with funds supplied by the United Africa Company Limited, successors to the Niger Company, whose mining division sent Henry William Laws to pioneer the minesfield. 8. THE STEEL FOOT BRIDGE, ORIGINALLY ERECTED BY THE LATE LORD LUGARD AT ZUNGERU, IN 1904, AND RE-ERECTED IN 1954 IN THE KADUNA GARDENS. (16.2.56) The footbridge is an interesting example of engineering before the coming of railways and roads to Nigeria. 163</page><page sequence="4">9. THE BUILDING KNOWN AS "iLOJO BAR", NOS. 6 ALLI STREET AND 2, BAMGBOSE STREET, LAGOS, AND THE COMPOUND IN WHICH IT IS SITUATED. (5.4.56) This building, owned by Mr D. A. Olaiya, has probably the greatest architectural interest of all old buildings in Lagos. It is in a moderate state of repair but will require a considerable amount of maintenance in the near future. It was built about one hundred years ago, one of the first modern style buildings put up by Nigerians shortly after Lagos became a colony, by a slave family returning from Brazil. It is one of the most striking of the Brazillian style houses in Lagos with attractive arched doorways and windows, fine iron balustrades and a statue. The Brazilian style has influenced much of present day architecture in Yorubaland. (W. Murray Jacks; "Old Houses of Lagos", Nigeria , No. 46, 1955, pp. 96-117). 10. THE HILLS KNOWN AS KUFENA NEAR ZARIA, AND AN AREA OF FARMLAND WITHIN 300 FEET OF THE FOOT OF THE HILLS. (17.7.56). The original site of Zaria. At the foot of Kufena hill is a town wall, said to have been built either byBakua or her daughter, Zaria. Bakua is thought to have been the 22nd ruler mentioned in the Zaria Chronicle and to have died in the early sixteenth century. Her daughter Zaria, according to Hogben, built the present Zaria town. On the hill there are traces of early inha- bitants said to be the Gwai i who were driven off by Bakua. They include remains of old habita- tions, grinding grooves, rock gongs, and a series of cups in the rock said to be an old mancalla board. There are caves containing archaeological material in one of which a small terra cotta head was found. It is reported that engravings on the rock were destroyed by soldiers in an attempt to remove them. (S. J. Hogben: The Muhammadan Emirates of Nigeria, London, 1930, p. 88) 11. THE BUILDING IN KATSINA KNOWN AS THE "GOBIRAU MINARET". (15.8.57) This minaret, an ancient Mosque built by the Habe, is said to be three hundred years old. The remains of the original minaret are within the reconstruction built in 1927 by F. de F. Daniel. 12. THE RELICS OF THE STEAMER "DAYSPRING" AT JEBBA STATION. (15.8. 57) Although culminating in disaster at Jebba on October 7th 1857 the voyage of the "Dayspring" of only 77 tons, with Baikie, Glover and Crowther on board, was the first trading venture to come to the northern parts of Nigeria by way of the Niger River, which was entered by St. John's River on July 15th, 1857. The achievements of the voyage seen in retrospect are described by Hastings ( The Voyage of the Dayspring , Bodley Head, 1926) as "a complete and detailed chart of the Niger from the sea to Boussa, a journey linking Jebba to Lagos, and a record of good relations established, so far as they went, with the important state of Nupe and the pagan district of the Borgu people. Much useful information of the country and its tribes was collected, and botanical and zoological specimens gathered during their stay. The successes then outweighed the fail- ures, and the whole was a distinct advance in knowledge." MacGregor Laird himself, who was the prime mover in the "Dayspring" venture, pointed out that its wreck was the immediate cause of the establishment of the overland route from Rabba to Lagos, a route later followed by the Railway from Lagos to Jebba. The relics are on the platform of Jebba railway station. 164</page><page sequence="5">13. A STRIP OF LAND, ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE IFE-ILESHA ROAD, AT THE PLACE ON THE EDGE OF IFE TOWN AS ITA YEMOO, MEASURING APPROXIMATELY 1,585 FEET BY 400 FEET, AND FOLLOWING THE BUILDING LINE OF THE IFE-ILESHA ROAD FROM BEACON NO. 2156 IN A SOUTHERNLY DIRECTION TO THE POINT WHERE THE INNER WALL MEETS THE IFE-ILESHA ROAD. (20. 2. 59) At Ita Yemoo in November 1957 whilst the foundations for a new building were being dug some outstandingly fine examples of Ife bronze work were discovered. Fortunately, the Direc- tor of Antiquities, Mr B. E. B. Fagg, happened to be at Ife at the time and he took immediate steps to protect the finds and the site. The Department carried out excavations and sunk small trial pits over a considerable area and found, besides a number of terra cottas and pottery pavements, that the whole area was an important archaeological site. One piece of pavement has been uncovered and a roof built over it. (Frank Willett: "Ife and its Archaeology", Journal of African History, Vol.1, 1960, pp, 23 1-248) 14. THE OLD WEST AFRICAN FRONTIER FORCE FORT SITUATED AT OKUTA AND THE AREA WITHIN THREE HUNDRED FEET OF THE PERIMETER OF THE WALL OF THE FORT. (23.4. 59) This fort was built in about 1900 for the defence of Borgu. It overlooks Okuta town and commands a fine defensive position. 15. THE OLD WEST AFRICAN FRONTIER FORCE FORT SITUATED AT YASHIKERA AND THE AREA WITHIN THREE HUNDRED FEET OF THE PERIMETER WALL OF THE FORT. (23. 4. 59) This fort, which is smaller than Okuta Fort, was built between 1897 and 1900 to defend the Borgu frontier. The remains are quite substantial and consist of a stone-built fort, 30 yards square, with guard posts at three corners. The stone was originally faced with mud, most of which has been washed away. There are traces of mud huts inside the fort. 16. THE ROCK PAINTINGS DUTSEN ZANE, NEAR GEJI IN JEMA'A DISTRICT OF BAUCHI PROVINCE AND THE AREA LYING WITHIN SIX HUNDRED FEET THEREOF. (23. 4. 59) This group of rock paintings, the second to be discovered in Nigeria was reported to Mr H. Sassoon, District Officer Bauchi Division, in November 1957. There are two groups of paintings on the main wall of a large open cave which offers shelter from the weather and there- fore protection for the fragile pigment of the paintings. Altogether there are about fifteen paintings and, although partly defaced by people striking the rock to recover the powdered pigment for magical purposes, the deep red paintings are clearly visible on the protected rock wall which faces south. There are the remains of what appears to have been some human figures and cattle, horses, antelope and monkeys. Very little can at present be said of their age though, if the presence of a horse can be establi- shed beyond doubt, they would seem not older than about 800-850 years. Geji iš just north of the Jos-Bauchi trunk road some twenty miles before reaching Bauchi. (Hamo Sassoon: "Cave Paintings recently discovered near Bauchi, Northern Nigeria", Man , 70, 1960). 165</page><page sequence="6">17. THE ROCK PAINTINGS DUTSEN DAMISA, NEAR GUMULEL IN ZUNGER DISTRICT OF BAUCHI PROVINCE, AND THE AREA WITHIN A RADIUS OF SIX HUNDRED FEET THEREOF. (23.4.59) As a result of the discovery of the rock paintings at Geji, a further group was reported in January 1958. These paintings are about five miles from the Geji Group and consist entirely of cattle. They are in a better state of preservation than those at Geji, although not of such a high standard artistically. 18. THE THREE LARGE AND TWO SMALL TUMULI AT DURBI TAKUSHEYI IN MANI DIS- TRICT OF KATSINA PROVINCE, TOGETHER WITH THE ANCIENT BAOBAB TREES KNOWN AS 'KUKA KATSl' AND THE SITE OF THE FORMER TREE KNOWN AS 'KUKA KUMAYO'. (23. 4. 59) One of the large tumuli was opened many years ago by Sir Richmond Palmer when Resident. Associated with the tumuli were two remarkable baobab trees, known as Kuka Katsi and Kuka Kumayo. These trees were certainly many hundreds of years old, and the fact that finds of antiquities have been made around their bases suggest that they have had religious associations. One of the trees 'Kuka Kumayo' has fallen and disppeared but the other is still standing. The tumuli and the baobab tree and the site of the second baobab tree are venerated by the people of the district as relics of their ancestors. The tumuli are most easily reached by walking from the wind-pump at Mile 17 from Katsina on the Daura Road. From here they are about three miles to the south. 19. THE HOUSE AND COMPOUND IN KANO KNOWN AS MĀKAMA^ HOUSE (GIDAN makama). (23. 4. 59) The Gidan Makama is on an ancient site and dates back to about 1 750. It is one of the oldest buildings in Kano. The construction of the building reflects its ancient tradition and unspoiled architectural character. The large compound is divided into three enclosures, each of them entered by a separate monumental gate-house ( zaure ) set along the road in the northern peri- meter wall ( garun gida). Three zauruka and two western groups of buildings preserve the earth- enwork traditional structure. The flat roof of the gatehouse is surrounded by a continuous parapet with thick-set finials called zanko at the corners. Another pair of zankwaye decorate the top of gemu. Gemu means beard (a slightly projecting Hausa beard), and this name has been given to a number of structural elements that are corbelled or cantilevered; here the term^eww means a slab of masonry projecting from the wall and bracketed over the lintel. The gemu rises up to the parapet level and forms a flat canopy above the door. The ceilings of the gate-houses are supported by pillars, which are rectangular and quite heavy, and taper towards the top and are headed with capitals. Each capital is extended further back at the top of all foursides by short brackets of azaras forming a cross, which support the beams of tauyi , whose outer ends are laid on the corbels set in the walls. The whole system was devised so as to lessen the span of azaras used in construction. The courtyard, filin kofar gida , is reached by an inner door of the gatehouse. It is enclosed on both sides by low walls and at the back by a vestibule of the main cluster of rooms. The first interior is called soron ajuye takalmi (building where shoes are put down by the visitor) or otherwise soron yara (building for boys, young servants of the Makama who usually slept there). The soron ajiye takalmi is about 21' x 12' and was originally lit by a couple of narrow windows set in its western wall, which shelters them from eastern winds and rain. The ceiling has three azara cross-beams, each of which are supported at the walls by quadrantal corbels made of azaras and plastered. The soron fadanci is a large reception room devoted to social occasions. It is there that the Makama received his guests in a formal setting. The architect so designed the structure as to offer an unimpaired view of the whole interior. A spendid type of domed roof was adopted for this reception room, while four arches give the impression of crowning the square interior. The building, situated in the south-east cornerof the large square in frontof the Emir's Palace and at the western end, south side of the Nassarawa Road, has been repaired and reconstructed by the Department of Antiquities, and contains the Kano Museum . 166</page><page sequence="7">20. THE HOUSE AND COMPOUND IN DIKWA, BORNU PROVINCE, KNOWN AS RABEH'S HOUSE. (23. 4. 59) This house was the residence of Rabeh, a general who came from the Sudan and made him- self ruler of Bornu in about 1893. After destroying Kukawa, the old capital of Bornu, he estab- lished his headquarters at Dikwa where a great fort was built. From there he made himself mas- ter of Bornu but in 1900 the French defeated and killed him at Guiba in Bornu. 21 THE HOUSE AND COMPOUND IN BENIN KNOWN AS CHIEF OGIAMIEN'S HOUSE (26. 5. 59) This is a fine example of a Benin style house with an elaborate system of courtyards and alters. It is probably unique in being an important chief's house which was built before the 1897 expedition and which was not touched by the big fire which occurred at that time and destroyed most of the city. 22. THE STATUE IN OPOBO REPRESENTING KING JAJA AND THE LAND LYING WITHIN A RADIUS OF ONE HUNDRED FEET THEREOF. (14. 8. 59) King Douglas Jaja the First was one of the chiefs from the Opobo section of Bonny who founded Opobo Town in 1870. He later became King of Opobo Town, a position which he held until deported in 1887. After spending three years in the West Indies, he was granted a royal pardon, but died on his way home at Teneriffe on 7th July, 1891 . He was buried in Opobo. The statue was made in England and erected in 1907, the expenses being borne by the Opobo Chiefs and by some of King Jaja's European friends. 23 THE HOUSE AND COMPOUND IN CALABAR KNOWN AS THE 'OLD RESIDENCY', TOGE- THER WITH THE CONTENTS THEREOF. (14. 8. 59) The ground floor is in use as the Divisional Office. The first floor is at present a rest house and is, with its furniture and fittings, virtually an historic house museum. 24 THE HOUSE AND COMPOUND IN CALABAR KNOWN AS THE 'OLD CONSULATE' (14. 8. 59) This is a fine example of a late 19th century house which is still equipped with much of its original furniture and fittings. Its main historical interest lies in its association with the early days of the Consuls in Calabar. The following extracts are from correspondence in the Public Record Office, relating to the Consular Buildings at Fernando Po in old Calabar between the years 1861 and 1874. F. 0. 2/98. Consular Property. (Niger Coast) 1884-1895. Memo respecting Houses for Consular Offices in the Oil Rivers, West Coast of Africa. From Edward Hyde Hewitt, Consul. London May 9, 1884. "As there are no houses to be obtained in the above District either by purchase or on lease it is essential that Consular residences should be provided from England. The Traders in the Rivers have mostly houses sent out from England. The houses are built on iron columns 12 or 14 ft. high - the framework is made of single iron - the roofs of corrugated iron - the walls and bulkheads of red or pitch pine ... I find the cost of three houses will be about £2,400 . . . There should be one Consular Officer in the Cameron River, and one at Duke Town, Old Cala- ber. . . I think the Senior Consular Officer should be stationed in the Cameroon country. .." Draft. First Commer of Works-Immediate. F. O. July 18. 1884. Sir, I am directed by Earl Granville to state that the Lords Commers of the Treasury have con- sented that houses should be provided out of the public funds for the Consul on the West 167</page><page sequence="8">Coast of Africa whose headquarters are in the neighbourhood of the Oil Rivers and for the Vice Consul who will be stationed in the same district. . . Consul Hewett who is now in his way to his post on the West Coast. . . was inclined to think (after a visit to Liverpool and interviews with experts) that £4,300 would cover the expense. . . He insisted himself that Messrs Woodin Turner &amp; Co. of Liverpool could best undertake the work and obtained from them an estimate for three houses which amounted to £3,400. It is hoped that the matter may be settled as soon as possible, as Consul Hewett has at present no house or office at the place where he intends to live and the Vice Consuls cannot start until accommodation is provided for them. The following further information was provided by the Librarian of the Colonial Office, London :- (1) In "Diamond Jubilee, the story of the Calabar hospitals 1897-1957", there are two refer- ences one on p. 12 and the other on p. 17: - (a) "There was yet no Government in Calabar. The High Commissioner for the Niger Coast Protectorate lived in Fernando Po and paid regular routine visits to the river, descending on Calabar in his Man O'War, sometimes sent for by the Missionaries, more rarely by the chiefs! In the early 80's probably 1884, the first Permanent Building on dry land was put up. A big house prefabricated in Britain - as were some of the bigger King's houses at the time - was shipped out and erected on the face of the hill overlooking the river, at the other end of the town from Mission Hill. Calabar now had its Consulate, and its first occupant was Consul Hewett. Thus as an administrative centre, Calabar acquired an air of stability and what was perhaps thought of at the time as permanency." (b) "By the mid-nineties a few more buildings has sprung up on dry land in Calabar, all situated on Government Hill. The building now housing a branch of the Bank of West Africa went up after the Consulate, Government House, or as we now know it, the Old Residency had been built, and a little farther up, the first wooden building of the Hope Waddell Training Institute stood on its lovely and imposing site, overlooking the river." (2) In 1888 Vice Consul Johnston (as he was then) submitted a report on the Oil Rivers District to the Marquis of Salisbury and in this report there is the following statement "There are some thirteen large factories and trading establishments belonging to British firms in Old Calabar, and two or three in Creek Town. Her Majesty's Consulate is a large, commodious, but very ugly building, placed on a commanding site about 310 feet above the river." 25 THE HOUSE AND COMPOUND AT NO. 19 BOKO STREET, CALABAR, KNOWN AS CHIEF EKPO bassey's house. (14.8.59) This is a fine example of a prefabricated timber house which was built by Chief E. E. Bassey in 1886. 26 THE HOUSE AND COMPOUND IN OBASAGBON KNOWN AS CHIEF ENOGIE AIKORIOGIE'S HOUSE. (1.6.61) This house is mainly composed of a courtyard which is all that survives of the original building which was probably built in the second half of the nineteenth century. The courtyard is believed to be unaltered in plan or in structure since it was first built. There are many features in the building which indicate direct links with the architecture of Benin. These include horizontally fluted walls, the central impluvium and the carved decoration of the timber-work. There are also two important features which are not now know in Benin: these are the symmetry of the plan having the main entrance door and the main altar on a longitudinal axis; and the eight very heavy mud pillars supporting the side lintel walls. These pillars measure 2 feet 6 inches by 4 feet in plan, and are 8 feet high. Considering the probable date of the building, it seems probable that some of the pre- punitive expedition interiors of the palace of the Oba of Benin contained pillars similar to those of Obasogbon. 27 THE TOWN WALLS OF BENIN AND THE SITE THEREOF, COMPRISING THE LAND LYING WITHIN FIFTY FEET OF THE CREST OF THE WALLS ON THE INSIDE AND WITHIN ONE 168</page><page sequence="9">HUNDRED FEET OF THE CREST OF THE WALLS ON THE OUTSIDE: PROVIDED THAT ALL EXISTING BUILDINGS SITED WITHIN FIFTY FEET OF THE CREST OF THE WALLS ON THE OUTSIDE SHALL BE DEEMED LAWFULLY ERECTED AS LONG AS THEY EXIST. (1. 6. 61) These are the most impressive city walls in the southern part of Nigeria. At their highest point the walls are 30 feet high and the ditch 30 ft. deep making a total incline of 60 ft. Unfor- tunately, in the past few years, the walls have been extensively used as a source of building materials. 28 CARVED STONE FIGURES OF MAGHABE (19. 3. 63) 29 CARVED STONE FIGURES OF ALOK (19. 3. 63) There are numerous circles of interesting carved stones in the Cross River Area; two of these circles of stones are situated on the Ogoja-Ikom main road, near the villages of Maghabe (Mile 111) and Alok(Mile 112). Little is known about the history or significance of these carved stones, but they are still revered by the local people. The quality of workmanship and the rarity of such an art form in this region give the stones considerable interest. Although there is considerable variation in details, all are alike in that they represent the head and torso of a bearded human figure. They appear to have little signifi- cance for the present inhabitants of the area, although one of them had been used recently for a sacrifice. There is a belief among some of the inhabitants that these stones mark the graves of the "Ntuls", the priest-chiefs of the Atam people. They may, of course, have been carved much earlier and merely adapted as grave-stones by the Atam people . . . Stone is apparently no longer carved. (From a report by Miss Rosemary Harris.) Partridge, C. : Cross River Natives , 1905 ; Talbot, P.A. : The Peoples of Southern Nigeria , 1926 ; Harris, R. : 4 'A note on the Sculptured Stones in the Mid Cross River Area of S.E. Nigeria", MAN, 1959, 137; Allison, P.A. : "Carved Stone Figures in the Ekoi country in the Middle Cross River", MAN, 1962, 15. 30 CHIEF OKOROJl'S HOUSE, AROCHUKU. (19. 3. 63) Very few Aro buildings survive from the last century, but the few that are still extant pre- sent a highly developed constructional skill, have beautifully formed facades and interiors, and possess highly successful architectural details and decoration. The Chief Okoroji who built this house, probably at the time of his prosperity in the 1880's died before the Aro expedition. The plan of the house is simply an inner room and an outer verandah (along one wall of the room), and the most striking features of the building are its height (it is built on a plinth) and the length of its roof in the front. The house has a very interesting verandah, has low caves and mud benches, a pair of slave chains hang from the ceiling, and the rafters are ornamented with rows of animal skulls tied with decorative cane bindings. The inner room is even more impressive, being almost pitch dark and crowded with family heirlooms. The centre-piece of the room is a shrine made of a pile of fine large coiled manillas (with flattened ends) and crowned with a ship's bell. Around the walls are rows of china plates, serving dishes and covers, and pewter dishes and bowls. There is a profusion of pewter and china mugs, beakers and tankards. The ceiling of the room is hung with a variety of lanterns and ship's lights and other bric-a-brac. Elsewhere in the room there were a few cannons, swords and guns. All of these miscellaneous European articles appear tobe late nineteenth century English or German trade goods and souvenirs. There are some brass spiral manillas, very good specimens of a rare type. These are represented on wood-carvings in the area by a fluted design. 31 IGBARA OKE PETROGLYPHS. (19. 3. 63) In 1959 during the levelling of a plot on which a new house was being built in Igbara Oke a large rock was uncovered and found to bear incised designs. Nothing is known of the signifi- cance or age of these designs which include what appear to be a fish as well as a narrow triangle and other patterns. Igbara Oke is 17 miles from Akure on the road to Ilesha. The rock is oppo- site the Christ's Apostolic Church School and about 10 yards south-west of the main road. 169</page><page sequence="10">32 SHADAWANKA ROCK PAINTINGS. (19. 3. 63) A large cave containing paintings was discovered in January 1961 on a hill at Shadawanka by Mr John Watkins, an Education Officer from Bauchi Secondary School. Although the condition of the paintings is poor, it is possible to distinguish drawings of wild animals and many enigmatical signs including ladders and what resembles a rising sun symbol. The cave itself is formed by a huge overhanging rock which gives ample shelter from above, but the rock floor is on such a slope that storm water can flow through the cave, thus making it unsuitable for permanent occupation. Exploratory excavations confirmed that no impor- tant occupation layer exists but there is evidence in the remains of pottery and quartz arrow points and arrow barbs that the cave must have been used occasionally by the people living in a neolithic settlement previously discovered at the foot of the hill. It is still used as a shelter during heavy rain, and there are sounding rocks and a rock slide not far away where children come to play. Shadawanka is three miles north of Bauchi, and the cave is visible from the main road. 33 STONE FIGURES OF OFARO. (19. 3. 63) At the old site of Ofaro, formerly in Lafiagi Emirate but now in llorín Emirate, there is a small rock-shelter containing two figures carved in the same style as those at Esie. The figures are 24" high and are carved in a soft stone. Both are at present complete. Little is known of the history of these figures except that they are said to have been brought from Esie before the time of the first Olu of Ofaro, the present incumbent being the thirty- fourth Olu. They are still venerated by the local people. Owode Ofaro is reached via Oke Oni- gbin. (F. de F. Daniel: "Stone Figures at Ofaro", Nigeria , No. 18, 1939, pp. 107-108.) 34 OBU HOUSE, ELU OHAFIA. (19. 3. 63) The Ndi Anaga meeting house is unpretentious from the outside. Its structure is very simple: a large verandah closed by earthen walls at both ends and one longitudinal side, and the other side open towards the compound. The monumentality of the building is due to the magnificent effects created by three rows of richly carved posts supporting the roof and dividing the interior into three narrow aisles. The pillars are carved with representations of warriors, masqueraders and women carrying loads, combined with geometrical or perhaps stylised botanical patterns. 35 CHIEF OCHU KALU'S HOUSE, NDI OKEREKE ABAM, NEAR BENDE. (19. 3. 63) The building is considered locally to be very old; it was certainly erected before the Aro Expedition of 1901-02. The approximate dates suggested by various members of the family vary greatly, but the general layout of the buildings and traditions linked with some of its rooms indicate its ancient origin. Due to the poor quality of the local building earth, the ori- ginal construction has been in many places replaced or restored on the original plan and this makes dating still more difficult. Finally, certain irregularities in the plan seem to indicate that the present building has grown gradually and not necessarily as a homogeneous conception. The core of the building and its most striking feature is the central court, a fairly regular rec- tangle about 21 X 26 feet enclosed by four wings or blocks of rooms of approximately equal width (about 12 feet). This uniform width is due to the structural limitations of the roof con- struction although the east and south blocks happen to be divided into two parallel rows of rooms. The roofs of the wings overhang only slightly the outer walls of the building, but project seven feet over the central courtyard thus forming four verandahs surrounding it. The eaves of these verandah roofs come within about three feet of the ground and collect rainwater into the central impluvium, which is bordered with stones. The water is evacuated to the outside by an underground channel. This plan bears certain resemblances to similar courtyards in Onitsha and Benin, but it must be remembered when considering the traditions of Benin-Onitsha re- lationship, that the groups west of the Cross River have Owerri rather than Onitsha affinities. 170</page><page sequence="11">The most cherished and most jealously guarded part of the Mgbaja is a small room in the east corner of the south wing, where ritual sacrifices took place. The room has three doors: the main door leading from the central court; a door to the left of this entrance, set high up in the wall just above the ceremonial couch on which the priest reclined and providing access for the priest to his room in the east wing; and a door above the sacrificial altar at the back of the room leading. to the cell in which the victim was kept. The structure of the building is earthen daub on a wattle framework. The eaves of the implu- vium roofs are supported by short, heavy posts, set in blocks of earthenwork and the ridges by forked poles set inside the partition, walls and part of their structural frame. There are three decorative doors, two of them richly adorned in the manner typical for Ohafia and imita- ting (not structurally) the panelled appearance of the framed doors. In the entrance room in the west wing there is a beautifully carved post supporting the ridge beam and adorned with antelope horns. 36 OMO UKWU OF THE NDI EZERA CLAN, OHAFIA. (19. 3. 63) The Omo Ukwu (or temple) of the Ndi Ezera Clan is a most impressive structure, not only because of its great size, but also because of the carved figures with which it is adorned. The posts and beams supporting the beautifully constructed roof are about 12 inches in diameter, the internal pillars of imposing dimensions are richly carved, and the walls are painted in geometrical patterns. The main glory of the building is the collection of twenty-two carved figures, some of them over life-size, standing around the walls of the interior, along the façade of the verandah and forming a group in the centre of the temple. This formidable group consists of three figures standing side by side, the central figure carrying in its arms the effigy of the deified ancestor, the patron of the temple. The building has been described by G. T. Jones in The Nigeria Field , Vol. 4, October 1937. 37 THE ROCK PAINTINGS OF DUTSEN HABUDE AT BIRNIN KUDU, KANO PROVINCE, NORTHERN NIGERIA, CONSISTS OF TWO ROCK SHELTERS AND HAVE MANY PAINTINGS OF LONG-HORNED HUMPLESS CATTLE. (5. 8. 64) Dutsen Habude is the most spectacular and best preserved of the rock-painting sites of Birnin Kudu. The two rock shelters are on different levels. Two of the paintings of cattle on the ceiling of the upper shelter are the best examples yet known in Nigeria. The age of the paintings is unknown but is of the order of many centuries. A protective wall was built around the site in 1961, and the key to this is held by the Sarkin Kudu, who will supply a guide to visitors on request. 38 THE RIVER-SIDE SHRINE AND SACRED GROVE OF OSHUN AT OSHOGBO, WESTERN NIGERIA, TOGETHER WITH THE SHRINE, ITS GROVE, THE SURROUNDING LAND WITHIN A RADIUS OF 400 FEET FROM THE NORTHERNMOST CORNER OF THE SHRINE BUILDING. (5. 8. 64) The shrine is set in a clearing in the midst of a beautiful grove with majestic trees. The building is an impluvium courtyard surrounded by a verandah, the roof of which is supported by painted earthwork pillars. The site, a large area of land traditionally sacred to Oshun, is between the Oshun river and the Suspension Bridge Road. 39 THE SHRINE OF OSHUN IN THE KING'S MARKET AT OSHOGBO, WESTERN NIGERIA, TOGETHER WITH THE SURROUNDING LAND TO A DISTANCE OF 25 FEET. (5. 8. 64) The shrine opposite the palace is said to be on the site of the house of the first Ataoja of Oshogbo. It is built as an impluvium courtyard, of which there are very few examples left in Oshogbo. The building contains an important collection of very old wood carvings. 171</page><page sequence="12">40 CARVED STONE FIGURE SITUATED AT IGBAJO IN OSHUN DIVISION, WESTERN NIGERIA. IT IS 24 INCHES HIGH, MOUNTED ON A BASE EMBEDDED IN THE GROUND DEDICATED TO ESU WHICH STANDS BY THE ROADSIDE IN THE CENTRE OF THE TOWN. (5. 8. 64) The carving is dedicated to Esu. It is in good condition except for a deep cut above the left elbow, said to have been inflicted during a war with Ilesha, which could be one of a number of wars about the middle of the last century. According to the Owa of Igbajo, there were once two other such stone carvings. One of these was stolen about fifteen years ago and the other was badly mutilated by Christian fanatics more recently. (P.A.Allison: "A Carved Stone Figure of Esu from Igbajo", MAN, 131, 1964). 41 SHIRA ROCK PAINTINGS FOUND IN THE SHIRA TOWN IN AZARE DIVISION OF BAUCHI PROVINCE, NORTHERN NIGERIA. IT IS WITHIN A RADIUS OF THREE MILES OF THE TOWN AND THE LAND COVERING A RADIUS OF 300 FEET OF THE CENTRE OF EACH SITE. THERE ARE TEN DIFFERENT SITES CONTAINING ROCK PAINTINGS. (5.8.64) These rock paintings were first reported in 1959. Mallam Garba, a local farmer, has since located ten sites with rock paintings and rock-gongs in the ring of hills around Shira. Of the ten sites, nine have stylised, anthropomorphic figures painted in red, probably with the finger, on the underside of large, mushroom-shape boulders. These boulders are propped up by a natural formation on smaller rocks, many of which show signs of use as rock gongs. It is believed that the paintings and rock-gongs had to do with initiation ceremonies although the present local population claim to know nothing about them. The tenth site is in a rock shelter, consists of several rather faint red paintings of cows and calves. 42 IJARA STONE FIGURES SITUATED AT IJARA IN ILORIN PROVINCE, NORTHERN NIGERIA, AND MADE UP OF A GROUP OF EIGHT STONE FIGURES WHICH ARE RELATED ARTISTICALLY TO THOSE OF ESIE. (5. 8. 64) The carvings are arranged in a small circle with one in the middle. They are carved in light- coloured chrystalline rock and are all headless, though three detached heads more or less fit three of the bodies. All the figures are male and are seated on stools. The largest would have been about 30" high when complete. Ijara is situated 3 miles along a branch road which leaves the main Ilorin-Egba road at Oke Onigbin. (P. A. Allison: "Newly Discovered Stone Figures from the Yoruba Village of Ijara", MAN , 115, June 1963.) 43 THE ANCIENT CITY OF SURAME IN SOKOTO PROVINCE, NORTHERN NIGERIA. ALTHOUGH ABANDONED ABOUT 260 YEARS AGO, THE WALLS STILL STAND TO A HEIGHT OF 15 TO 20 FEET. IT INCLUDES THE LINE OF THE MAIN ROADS OF THE AREA LYING WITHIN A DISTANCE OF 300 FEET ON THE CREST OF THE WALLS. (5. 8. 64) Muhammadu Kanta Sarkin Kebbi whose empire is said to have included Yauri, Nupe, Kano, Katsina, Gobir, Zaria, and Agedes, founded Surame in the early 16th century. The town was in existence for 184 years 4 months and 20 days, and was abandoned about 1700 when the capital was moved to Birnin Kebbi. It lies north of Silame, which is 25 miles west of Sokoto on the opposite side of the Sokoto River. As it is within a Forestry Reserve, it has been protected from the ravages of agriculture, and traces of house walls and hut-foundations are clearly visible. An ancient Baobab tree marks the site of Kanta's house and well, to which magic properties are attributed. 172</page><page sequence="13">Three miles south of Silamc is Gungu also founded by Kanta. It is now the site of a modern village and the whole of the area has been cultivated for a considerable period so nothing remains except a considerable bank marking the line of the defensive walls. C. K. Meek describes the walls of Surame: "At Surame, in Sokoto Province, the town is encircled by seven stone walls built it is said by Kanta, founder of the kingdom of Kebbi, which are still wonderfully preserved after the lapse of four hundred years. These walls are ten miles in circumference, and are built of stone, the interstices being filled up with laterite gravel and red mud, which had evidently been brought from a distance. Mr Daniel reports that the walls show regular courses of masonry to a height of 20 feet. At one point in the wall there is a gap which had been filled in with solid masonry 30 feet high, and is still in a remarkable state of preservation. It is said that persons doomed to death were flung down from this wall, and probably strangled with a rope fixed round their necks. The Surame walls may be the work of the same people who built the famous walls of Lobi in French territory, and of those who built the bridges of the Ba-Ron district." (C. K. Meek : The Northern Tribes of Nigeria, London, Vol. I, p. 57, 1925.) 44 HABE MOSQUE AT MAIGANA, ZARIA PROVINCE. (15.12.64) The Mosque is believed to be three hundred years old and is mostly in ruins. A minaret 31 feet high still remains. According to tradition, the Emir would risk death if he looked at this Mosque. Maigana is an old walled town, now a village, fourteen miles from Zaria on the Jos Road. 45 THE OLD IGA BUILDING IN IGA IDUNGANRAN. (15. 12. 64) The Oba of Lagos lives in a modern building constructed in 1959 as an extention to the oldest remaining parts of the traditional palace, which is said to date from the reign of Oba Akinsemoyin (r. 1704-20), for whom it was built by the Portuguese in return for trading rights in Lagos. The old Iga is constructed according to the traditional plan, widespread in Southern Nigeria, of a series of small open courtyards or impluvia, the internal design of which is in the particular style of Benin architecture. While the Portuguese may in fact have financed the building, it is clear that they did not interfere with traditional building methods, except perhaps to provide pottery roofing tiles. These are said to have been used as a fire precaution although they have long since been replaced by corrugated iron sheeting. Of the old building, three impluvia and some adjoining rooms remain each, except for the throne room, containing tombs of deceased Obas. 46 ATE OGU TUMULUS NEAR THE PALACE OF THE ATA OF IDAH, KABBA PROVINCE, NORTHERN NIGERIA. (15.12.64) Ate Ogu is a large earth mound behind the houses that border the west side of the main road leaving Idah for Ankpa. It is associated with the traditional section of Idah and not with the modern parts of the town. In relation to the division of the old town into indigenous quar- ters (occupied by the Igala Mela families) and royal compounds (occupied by the titled relatives of the Ata) the mound is closest to the latter section. Its name implies that people were killed there in the past, or alternatively, that it was a site for ogu sacrifice which is usually the last rite in the traditional sequence of funeral ceremonies. In explanation of the name it is said that Onoja Oboni, a legendary Igalagiant, once employ- ed his army to build on this site a tower that would reach the sky and enable him to carry war up to heaven. But the tower collapsed and buried most of the workers, leaving the mound in its present form. A less common story is that the mound forms the ruins of a former tower, similar to one called Odogo in the Ata's present compound and is associated with Agenapoje, an early female member of the present dynasty. 173</page><page sequence="14">47 TSOEDE'S TOMB AT GWANGWADE, NORTHERN NIGERIA. (15. 12.64) The burial place at Gwangwade, near Salka in Kontagora Division, of Tsoede the legendary hero of the Nupe people came to light during the archaeological survey of the Niger Dam area. There is little doubt that this is the same Tsoede who was responsible for the distribution of the bronze figures of Jebba and Tada, since the story of his early life, with his flight from Attagara and subsequent return to the chieftainship of the Nupe, was related in some detail by the old men of Gwangwade, though without mention of the bronzes. Tsoede died at Gwangwade from a wound received when returning from a friendly trial of strength with Sarkin Yauri. The people of the village claim to be descended from his followers and have in their possession a pair of iron stirrups which are said to have belonged to him. The tomb itself is a circular building of mud and thatch about twelve feet in diameter with its floor built up to about three feet above ground level. It stands beneath a baobab tree in the centre of a circular compound surrounded by a mud wall, at present in a bad state of repair, with a small entrance hut. Ceremonies are performed regularly in the doorway of the tomb. About one mile to the north-north east there is a rock with a small hollow said to be a footprint made by Tsoede when he stopped to bathe his wounded leg. This mark, though of some interest, is probably of natural origin. 48 OSHUN SHRINE AT AFIN ATAOJA, OSHOGBO, WESTERN NIGERIA. (15. 12.64) The third of the main shrines to Oshun in Oshogbo is in the palace. It is the repository for all the more sacred ritual objects connected with Oshun, including a series of brass figurines. 49 SUNGBO'S SHRINE IN IJEBU-ODE, WESTERN NIGERIA. (15. 12. 64) The shrine is described by Mr Peter Lloyd in his paper "Sungbo's Eredo", published in Odu , No. 7, (lbadan, March 1959, pp. 15-22). "Sungbo's grave lies in the land of Oke Eki (now a quarter in Oke Eri from which the priest of the shrine must be chosen); this site no woman may approach for fear of death. The grave is popularly said to be a miraculous place hung with cobwebs where no grass ever grows. It is, in fact, situated in a grove a few yards inside the eredo east of the Ijebu-Ode-Oru road. A thick mass of creepers covers the arena which is swept bare of leaves, and on which grass is indeed unlikely to be found growing. There is no shrine or other monument to mark the supposed site of Sungbo's burial place. Annual sacrifices are here made to Sungbo." The eredo is a great earth rampart surrounding the town of Ijebu-Ode. 50 CHIEF NWOKOLO'S HOUSE AT UKEHE, EASTERN NIGERIA. (15. 12.64) This large mud and thatch building is the old family residence of the Agunechube family. The compound consists of an entrance gate, shrines, and the chief's principal abode called Obu-Usheu. The walls of the latter are impressively decorated not only with traditional wall patterns in black, but also with scores of beautiful rare enamel plates mainly of Portuguese origin. The architectural and historic value of the house is very considerable. The whole compound is beautifully planned and some of its secondary buildings are very interesting but its chief glory is the Obu-Ushue which is a nearly perfect example, of this particular type of building. At the same time, probably because of the high social status of the founder, the main features of design are more than usually lavish in scale and decoration. 174</page><page sequence="15">51 ROCK PAINTINGS CALLED DUTSEN MURUFU AND DUTSEN SANGO AT BIRNIN KUDU, KANO PROVINCE. (15.12.64) These are two more of the sites of rock paintings at Birnin Kudu in Kano Province. Dutsen Murufu lies just south of the main road on the east side of the town and has a representation in white paint of a short-honed bull together with other fainter paintings and a magnificent series of rock-gongs. Although the present population is almost exclusively Muslim, there is a custom probably deriving from earlier times whereby young girls before their marriage go to the site and spend a whole day there. Dutsen Zango lies one hundred yards north of the main road opposite the residence of the Sarkin Kudu and contains a further important series of paintings and rock-gongs. These two sites are now physically protected by walls, entry to which can be gained by application to the Sarkin Kudu. 52 HABE MOSQUE AT BEBEJI, KANO PROVINCE. (15. 12. 64) The Mosque is said to have been started around 1770 and to have been built in three stages. The northern part was rebuilt twenty-five years ago. The Mosque is still in use. Bebeji is on the Kano-Zaria dry season road.</page></plain_text>
