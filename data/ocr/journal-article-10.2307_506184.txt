HALL Abstract The Sanctuary of Hera on the eastern limits of the Argive Plain has, in recent years, figured prominently in accounts seeking to describe the process of Greek state formation. There has been a general consensus that the establishment of the sanctuary in the Geomet- ric period served to delimit the territory of the nascent city of Argos and to establish Argive domination over the Plain, to the detriment of the neighboring com- munities of Mycenae and Tiryns. This article reexamines the evidence for the Heraion and its position within the Argive Plain from an explicitly interdisciplinary point of view, drawing on archaeological, historical, linguis- tic, and mythological data. It attempts to demonstrate that the territory of Argos was not coterminous with the entire Argive Plain in the eighth century B.C.; that there were distinct cultural differences between the east- ern and western sides of the Plain; that the Heraion is accommodated more easily within the religious and cultural traditions of the eastern Plain; and finally, that there was no major change in this state of affairs until the mid-fifth century B.C.* INTRODUCTION Frangois de Polignac's La naissance de la cite grecque, published in 1984, has proved to be a persuasive, and increasingly pervasive, contribution to the con- tinuing debate about the origins and development of the Greek polis. For several decades now, classical archaeologists have been exercised by the problem of how to recognize what is essentially a sociopolit- ical phenomenon in the material vestiges of the past. Certainly, earlier views that the appearance of urban- ization could act as a sufficient index for the process of polis formation appear increasingly misguided: the case of the polis of Sparta, settled in villages, is instructive here.' Polignac looks to the archaeology of sanctuaries- a field of evidence promoted by Anthony Snodgrass, who viewed the establishment of a central state sanc- tuary, and particularly the construction of a monu- * An earlier, embryonic version of this article was de- livered to the Classical Archaeology Seminar at the Uni- versity of Cambridge in November 1992.

Map of the Argive Plain mental temple, as the reflection of a new sense of community, in which the shared cult to a divinity of the polis might act as a badge of identity for the nascent citizen body. The fact that it is the second half of the eighth century that witnesses a shift away from the deposition of offerings - especially metal objects--in graves to their investment in sanctu- aries is often taken to indicate that this was the crit- ical period for the formation of the polis, with its emphasis on the neonate political community rather than individual households.2 Unlike Snodgrass, however, Polignac focused his attention not on the central state sanctuaries, but on the "extra-urban" sanctuaries, situated in the coun- tryside. It is the establishment of these in the second half of the eighth century that marks out for the first time the limits of the chora, the territory that is in- separable from the urban habitat in any definition of the ancient polis. The emplacement of the rural sanctuary forges a "cultic axis" between urban (or semi-urban) core and rural periphery, and this "cultic axis" is physically reinforced by the solemn proces- sion (pompe), which periodically leaves the town for the sanctuary on the occasion of the divinity's festival.3 Excluding Athens for its atypicality, Polignac identifies several extra-urban sanctuaries: for in- stance, the Samian Heraion (Samos); the Sanctuary of Hera at Perachora (Corinth); the Sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas (Epidauros); the Sanctuary of Hya- kinthos at Amyklai (Sparta); and the Sanctuary of Zeus at Nemea (Kleonai).4 Polignac's archetypal ex- ample, however, is the Sanctuary of Hera located eight miles northeast of Argos and symbolically bound to the metropolis by the martial procession of armed youths and maidens that left Argos for the Heraion on the occasion of the goddess's festival.5 The estab- lishment of an extra-urban sanctuary to Hera on the 2J.N.

Once in possession of the Plain, the territory of Argos con- forms to the "ideal and natural setting" for a polis, namely, an urban nucleus focused on a citadel (the Larissa), and overlooking a small plain surrounded by mountains (fig. 1).6 The importance attached to the role the Heraion plays in Argive claims to domi- nate the Plain is not a view unique to Polignac, and is held by many other scholars, even if they differ from him over matters of method or detail.7 The innovation and imagination of a thesis can be gauged by the degree of reaction that it provokes, and there have been many criticisms of Polignac's theory.8 One might legitimately wonder whether the application of generalizing models presupposes a certain "typicality" on the part of poleis that may prove to be illusory in practice.9 Likewise, the model is essentially structured from a Classical perspective, whose application to the Geometric period need not be methodologically valid.1' At a more empir- ical level, there is by no means any unanimity over Polignac's interpretation of many of the extra-urban sanctuaries that he identifies." Ten years on, Polignac has accommodated many of the objections of his critics, and retreated some- what from his earlier, overschematized position. He now concedes that the Heraion was not exclusively Argive from its foundation, but rather acted as a meeting place for the various communities of the Plain until the 460s B.C., when Argos destroyed Mycenae and Tiryns.-2 Distanced from the major centers of power, the Heraion served as a locus for competition and the display of preeminence: "Thus two rivalries find expression in the common sanc- tuary: one between the aristocracies of different small towns in the region, in which the Argives rapidly gain the upper hand, and the other extending the competition which the basileis at the head of the prin- ciple [sic] groups and power networks, and indeed other members of those groups, display in each com- munity and particularly at Argos."'3 This retreat is, however, qualified by his reassertion that "the re- arrangement of the sanctuary and of its cults at the end of the eighth century carries a clear imprint of Argos and establishes the fundamental town/sanctu- ary axis of the Archaic and Classical city, without other cities being excluded thereby from the cult."'14 The reasons for this reassessment are not elab- orated, though they appear to be dictated more by dialectic than by a renewed inductive strategy. In this article, I reexamine the historical, archaeological, linguistic, and mythological evidence for the Heraion and its position within the Argive Plain, and show that what we assume to be the "received doctrine" on the Heraion is, in fact, a vast, artificial edifice constructed from individual inferential bricks, each of which is open to more than one interpretation. By deconstructing this edifice, and examining each of these constituent presuppositions, I show that a reordered configuration produces a rather dif- ferent scenario, in which the Heraion does indeed emerge as a shared sanctuary, though one at which Argive participation is even less conspicuous than most scholars are prepared to admit. 6 Polignac 42. 7 T.

HALL [AJA 99 I begin by arguing that the view assuming the ter- ritory of Argos to be coterminous with the Argive Plain is influenced more by our modern notions of what constitutes the "typical" polis than it is by any ancient testimony, and that we may have underesti- mated the role of the other communities of the Plain (especially Mycenae and Tiryns) in the Archaic and Early Classical periods. This reassessment of the po- litical geography of the Plain consequently threat- ens the status of the Heraion as the principal extra- urban sanctuary of Argos, and I proceed to examine the role of the Heraion within the cultic geography of the Argive Plain. First, however, it is necessary to sound a note of caution concerning two complicating factors that tend to distort the ancient evidence, especially the literary testimony. The first problem is one of geographical termi- nology: the ancient authors exercised little precision in their use of the terms "Argos" and "Argive" This indeterminacy of meaning had already been noted by Strabo, who postulated that the term "Argive" in the Homeric epics could denote not only the city of Argos, but also the Peloponnese generally, as well as the whole of Greece.15 It is well known that in the Homeric epics, the Greeks who fight against Troy are frequently referred to collectively as Argeioi (Argives). In time, the terms "Argeia" and "Argolis" came to be applied to the geographical region cur- rently known as the Argolid and embracing the mod- ern Eparchies of Argos, Nauplia, and the Hermionid, but in epic and in the transmission of myth, "Argos" could be used to denote the whole Argive Plain.16 At first sight, this might appear to vindicate the supposition that the chora of Argos was coterminous with the entire Argive Plain. Nevertheless, while "Argos" is named in the Homeric epics as the do- main of the Argive king Diomedes, it is also described as the kingdom of Agamemnon, who is based at Mycenae.7 Similarly, Eurystheus, who had occupied the palace at Mycenae before Atreus and Agamem- non, is deemed a worthy lord over the "Argives," and Proitos, based at Tiryns, is said to be the ruler of the demos of the "Argives."18 I have argued elsewhere that the contradictions generated by attempting to accommodate the dynasties of the Atreids, Perseids, and Proitids within the mythical landscape of the Argive Plain are due to genealogical variants circu- lating among competing groups in historical times, but the important point to observe is that the word "Argos" could be used to signify the Argive Plain gen- erally, rather than the specific territory associated with the city of Argos.19 Indeed, according to Strabo, the word actually means "plain," which would explain why several towns named Argos appear elsewhere throughout Greece--Stephanos of Byzantium lists no fewer than 11 examples.20 In other words, it is more than likely that the town of Argos took its name from the Argive Plain, rather than vice versa. Given this, we must recognize the possibility that references to the cult of Hera Argeia may have a wider signifi- cation than simply the city of Argos.21 The second problem is the remarkable Argive pro- pensity for rapid mythological reinvention. This ten- dency on the part of the Argives to overvalue their past and to blur the distinction between myth and history is not unique, and is a characteristic that finds some parallels in fifth-century Athens, though it is a trait that served to distinguish Argos from her Corinthian and Arcadian neighbors in the north- eastern Peloponnese.22 I would suggest that much of the information we possess for the Archaic Argolid has already been subjected to Argive reinvention in 5 Strab. 8.6.5.

THE EVIDENCE FOR ARGIVE DOMINATION OF THE PLAIN The communities that emerged from the collapse of the Bronze Age palaces were, by all accounts, iso- lated and introverted. The only sites in the Argive Plain at which Submycenaean material is attested are Argos, Asine, Dendra (Midea), Mycenae, Nauplia, and Tiryns.23 Argos itself appears to have been a col- lection of villages, rather than an urbanized metrop- olis, down to as late as ca. 700 B.C.24 There is, how- ever, a common opinion that before the end of the eighth century, Argos was articulating her claims over the Plain, symbolized by her establishment of the Heraion. The supposition of early Argive domina- tion of the Plain is based on the Argive destructions of Asine at the end of the eighth century and Nauplia at the end of the seventh, reported Argive campaigns against Sparta, and the attempts of the Argive tyrant Pheidon to recover the "Lot of Temenos." It is nec- essary to subject each of these arguments to close examination. Pausanias reports that, in the generation prior to the First Messenian War, the Argives under their king, Eratos, marched on Asine and tore the city down to its foundations, sparing only the Sanctuary of Apollo Pythaeus; the Asinaians boarded their ships in flight, and were given permission to occupy a refugee settlement on the Messenian coast.25 Herod- otus may appear to act as earlier support for this tradition when he refers to the Dryopean settlement of Messenian Asine (modern Koroni)--the popula- tion of Argolic Asine is always described as ethnically Dryopean - though he makes no mention of a trans- fer of population.26 The attack was not, according to Pausanias, unprovoked: it was retribution for the Asinaians' cooperation in an incursion into the Argolid launched by the Spartan king Nikandros. The archaeological evidence certainly supports the idea of an assault on Asine at about the time of the First Messenian War, that is, the last third of the eighth century.27 Charcoal mixed with wall-fill in wall 3 on the Barbouna Hill and evidence for sec- ondary burning of pottery in a deposit by wall 2 sug- gest that these walls had collapsed in a violent de- struction before the end of the Late Geometric phase. If the apsidal Building B on the summit of the Bar- bouna Hill is correctly identified with the Sanctu- ary of Apollo Pythaeus, then contrary to what Pau- sanias says, it too was a casualty: fragments of burnt mudbrick indicate a destruction in the LG IIb phase (ca. 720-710 B.C.). On the other hand, Building B is almost immediately succeeded by the rectangular Building A, where associated material suggests a period of use from the very end of Late Geometric or Subgeometric (ca. 710-690 B.C.) through to the fifth century, so there may have been some continuity of cult practice if not of architectural installations.28 Nor is there serious doubt concerning the iden- tity of the attacker. It is probably not coincidental that at about the time of the construction of Build- ing A, a sanctuary was established to Apollo Pythaeus on the Deiras ridge in northern Argos.29 Vollgraff believed that the cult at Asine had been introduced from Argos, due to Bacchylides' apparent reference to the Argive seer Melampous constructing an altar 23 Foley 23. 24 P.

Jeffery, Archaic Greece: The City-States c.700-500 B.C. (London 1976) 130, n. 2.

HALL [AJA 99 and temenos to "the Pythian" at Asine.30 More plausible, however, is the view that the introduction of the Asinaian cult of Apollo Pythaeus to Argos sym- bolized Argive domination over Asine.-31 The reason for the Argive attack is problematic. Kelly has argued that Sparta is unlikely to have had either the inclination or the ability to have launched an incursion into the Argolid as early as the second half of the eighth century, and it may be that the story of Asinaian aid to a Spartan invasion is merely an aition to account for the toponym on the Mes- senian coast, whether or not its population was orig- inally drawn from the Argolid.32 It is Kelly's opinion that Asine was destroyed because it alone offered spirited resistance against Argos's ambitions to domi- nate the Plain.33 Other scholars similarly connect the destruction of Asine with expansionist policies on the part of Argos, and it is sometimes argued that the very ability of Argos to launch a campaign against Asine presupposes the previous subjugation of com- munities such as Tiryns, Midea, and Nauplia that lie on the overland route.34 Asine is anything but a typical settlement for the Argive Plain. Its location on a coastal promontory immediately marks it out from sites such as Argos, Tiryns, or Mycenae. Furthermore, geoarchaeologi- cal research, carried out by Zangger, has revealed that it possessed not one, but two harbors.35 The first is still visible on the western side of the promon- tory; the second was situated north of Kastraki (the acropolis of Asine) in what is now the fertile Asinaian Plain, but was part of a shallow bay in the Neolithic period, when the coastline was approximately 700 m further inland than today. The harbor was essen- tially a backshore lagoon, created by a beach barrier that formed to the east of Kastraki during the Early Bronze Age as a result of longshore currents that redeposited up to 3 m of eroded material. It is highly likely that this small lagoon still existed in the Early Iron Age: the final alluvial deposition that has created the Asinaia of today occurred only from Roman times, and a colluvial deposit containing abundant Protogeometric to Hellenistic pottery was found to have filled the depression north of Kastraki after the Hellenistic period. That this inner harbor provided an important focus for the Asinaians is suggested by the apparent disposition of the walls on the Barbouna Hill. It now seems that wall 5 in Mycenaean necropolis I was part of a fortification circuit on the Barbouna Hill, con- structed and destroyed shortly afterward in the Late Geometric period.36 The western sections of the cir- cuit stand at an elevation of about 75 masl, but on the eastern side of the hill, facing the lagoon, they come down to 15 masl. This seaward focus of atten- tion is also reflected in the archaeological record of Asine. In contrast to the marked absence of imports in the Argive Plain proper during the Geometric period, the material culture of Asine shows some affinities with Attica, Crete, and the Cyclades.37 Asine's coastal situation is paralleled at other Dryo- pean settlements in the eastern Argolid peninsula- for instance, Hermione, Halieis, and Troizen, all of which have good harbors-and it is interesting to note that the fifth-century Athenian historian Pher- ekydes described the Dryopes as a Xio,1rptp&lt; OV 6 EOvog ("a piratical people").38 As Asine is situated on a rocky promontory, with a commanding view of the straits between the mainland and the small offshore island of Rhodi (fig. 2), it is tempting to speculate whether the settlers were, in fact, pirates whose con- tinued harassment of shipping in the Argolic Gulf was responsible for provoking the Argive attack. Cer- tainly, the Argolic Gulf was still frequented by pirates as late as the fourth century B.C.39 In any case, there is little justification in regarding the destruction of 30 Bacchyl. fr. 4, 50-53; Vollgraff (supra n. 29) 32. 31 W Barrett, "Bacchylides, Asine and Apollo Pythaieus," Hermes 82 (1954) 439; Billot 35, 97. 32 T.

View from Kastraki of the straits between Asine and Rhodi island Asine as the opening shot in a policy of Argive ter- ritorial expansion, especially since the Argives seem not to have resettled Asine after their attack.40 The literary evidence for the Argive destruction of Nauplia is similarly late. Pausanias relates that the Naupliotes were expelled by the Argives for sup- porting Sparta in the Second Messenian War, and were granted a settlement of land at Methone on the southwest coast of Messenia. Strabo, following the fourth-century historian Theopompos of Chios, mentions the hospitality of the Spartans and the fact that the Naupliotes withdrew to land under Laconian control.41 From the evidence of Pausanias, the date of this expulsion should fall sometime toward the end of the seventh century, and the event is normally treated as a further example of Argive aggressive ex- pansionism, perhaps with the aim of securing a good harbor.42 The evidence of Pausanias and Strabo may have been treated with a good deal more respect than it deserves. Although the archaeological record for Nauplia in the Early Iron Age is very sketchy- due, in part, to the superimposition of the modern town - there is, as yet, no evidence for the sort of destruc- tion witnessed at Asine.43 Nor is the desire for a deep-water harbor a convincing motive: the tendency in the Archaic period was to beach ships rather than to berth them in a deep-water port, and Argos almost certainly already possessed access to the sea at Temeneion (in the vicinity of modern Nea Kios).44 The similarities between the destructions of Asine and Nauplia deserve more attention.45 Both com- munities occupy fortified promontories controlling the entrances to the Argolic Gulf, and both were sup- posedly expelled by the Argives for pro-Laconian tendencies and settled by the Spartans only 25 miles from one another in the Akritas Promontory of Mes- senia. It has already been noted that the Laconian connection is questionable in the case of Asine; to extend it also to Nauplia verges on the incredible. strategies. In antiquity, piracy was barely separable from the right of seizure (a5Xrl), which was considered ajustified act of gaining recompense for an injury suffered:J.K.

HALL [AJA 99 Everything points to another foundation aition ex- plaining the apparent non-Messenian origin of the inhabitants of Methone, but modeled by assimilation on the existing aition for Messenian Asine. The Methonians may well have come from Nauplia, but the most plausible date for this is, as I argue below, the middle of the fifth century, when many other Argolic communities abandoned their homes in the Argive Plain. Given that the earliest possible known source for this story is Theopompos, it is extremely tempting to imagine that it was coined after Epa- minondas's foundation of Messene in 369 B.C., when the new imperatives of incipient statehood would have prompted the Messenians to inscribe ethno- graphic actualities into an official record of the myth- ical and historical origins of Messenia.46 Strabo provides one other piece of information sometimes used as circumstantial evidence for the Argive destruction of Nauplia. In describing the east- ern Argolid, he speaks of an amphictyony, based on the island of Kalaureia (modern Poros). The origi- nal members of the league were Hermione, Epi- dauros, Aigina, Athens, Prasiai, Nauplia, and Minyan Orchomenos (in Boiotia), though Argos later con- tributed on behalf of Nauplia, and Sparta on behalf of Prasiai.47 The admission of the two latecomers is explained by Sparta's assuming control of Kynouria (where Prasiai is situated) by the mid-sixth century at the very latest, and by Argos's destruction of Nauplia at the end of the seventh century.48 The number of theories built upon this solitary (and late) notice is alarming. Despite the inclusion of Minyan Orchomenos, Kelly is undoubtedly right to discount the view of earlier scholars, such as Karl Otfried Mfiller or L.R. Farnell, that the amphictyony was a Late Helladic trading league.49 Nevertheless, his seventh-century date for the amphictyony rests on questionable premises. He argues, reasonably enough, that the amphictyony could not have existed prior to the earliest post-Mycenaean archaeological evidence at the Sanctuary of Poseidon on Kalaureia. Thus a terminus post quem is provided by the earli- est votives-bronze figurines, a gold armband, an Italiote fibula, and a Middle Geometric sherd- which should date to the eighth century, though Kelly pushes this terminus post quem down to ca. 680 B.C., the date at which Protocorinthian pottery begins to be deposited in bulk at the sanctuary.50 This in it- self is not really remarkable: the pattern of initial dedications in the eighth century, followed by an in- crease in Protocorinthian material, is witnessed in many sanctuaries throughout Greece and cannot be used to argue positively for the existence of the amphictyony in the seventh century. What is needed is a terminus ante quem, and Kelly finds this in the supposed Argive destruction of Nauplia in the late seventh century; in his view, the amphictyony was originally formed as a defensive (and ultimately un- successful) league against Argive expansionism.51 Yet, if its existence during the Archaic period is predi- cated on the Argive destruction of Nauplia, then clearly any attempt to use it to prove the historicity of that destruction is guilty of circularity. In fact, the only independent terminus ante quem for the Kalaureian amphictyony is a Hellenistic in- scription, discovered in the Sanctuary of Poseidon in 1894, which mentions both the amphictyony and the hiaromnamon who presided over its administra- tion.52 It is often assumed that this incarnation of the amphictyony is an archaizing revival of an earlier confederation, but there is no compelling reason to believe in an Archaic predecessor.53 That there is an archaizing tenor to the amphictyony is a com- mon enough phenomenon in the Hellenistic period, and finds a parallel in the so-called "Themistokles Decree," a third-century document masquerading as the decree Themistokles gave for the evacuation of Athens in 480 B.C., which may not, in fact, be un- connected with the amphictyony.54 The Hellenistic period is also a suitable context for the appearance 46 For the foundation of Messene: Diod.

It was at this period that the city gained a long-lost prominence in Boiotia after its refoundation under Alexander, and the strategies that it employed in its appeals to a glorious past are illustrated by the reuse of the famous Late Helladic tholos tomb, commonly known as the Treasury of Minyas.55 If the Kalaureian amphictyony did not predate the Hellenistic period, then it is reasonable to see the supposed transference of membership from Prasiai and Nauplia to Sparta and Argos, respectively, as a narrative device designed to lend greater histori- cal depth to the amphictyony's foundation myth. Its function is both to evoke an epoch when Prasiai and Nauplia were independent poleis rather than sub- ordinate komai, and to explain why the inland set- tlements of Sparta and Argos find themselves among the ranks of maritime cities such as Athens, Her- mione, Aigina, and Epidauros. This may testify to the eventual absorption of these smaller commu- nities within the larger states of Argos and Sparta, but does not provide any evidence that the process had already occurred in the Archaic period. Herodotus (1.81.1-2) writes that in the mid-sixth century, "a quarrel had broken out between the Spar- tans and the Argives concerning the region called Thyrea. Thyrea was part of the Argolid, but the Spar- tans had appropriated it and were holding it by force. The mainland to the west as far as Malea, the island of Kythera, and the other islands once belonged to the Argives." Sparta and Argos eventually decided to settle their differences by fielding an army of 300 champions each. The result was indecisive, but in a "rematch," the Argives were heavily defeated, leav- ing the Spartans in possession of the Thyreatid, the coastal plain on the eastern seaboard of the Pelopon- nese, dominated today by the town of Astros.56 The "Battle of the Champions" is regarded as be- ingjust one of a series of clashes between Argos and Sparta over the Thyreatid, as recounted by later au- thors. The first is supposed to have occurred early in the ninth century during the reign of the Spartan king Labotas.57 The second is dated by Eusebius to 719/8 B.C., and may or may not be the same event as that described as occurring late in the reign of the Spartan king Theopompos.58 Better known is the Battle of Hysiai, in which the Argives were re- putedly victorious over the Spartans. Pausanias (2.24.7) records the battle as having been fought when Peisistratos was archon in Athens and in the third year of the Olympiad in which Eurybotas won the stade race at Olympia. Dionysios of Halikarnassos (3.1.2) dates the victory of a certain Eurybates (as- suming that this is the same character as Pausanias's Eurybotas) to 672 B.C., thus giving a date of 669 B.C. for the Battle of Hysiai. If Argos was able to possess, from time to time, the fertile coastal plain of the Thyreatid, then it might not be unreasonable to expect her to control the whole of the Argive Plain, closer to home. Needless to say, however, the evidence cannot be taken at face value. The references to earlier clashes in the ninth and eighth centuries are almost certainly spurious for the same reasons as those given in connection with the destruction of Asine, namely, the inability and disinclination on the part of Sparta to involve herself in long-distance campaigns at such an early date. Similarly, Herodotus's statement about the orig- inal extent of Argive territory is almost certainly de- rived not from any historical source, but from Homer's attestation that Agamemnon was ruler of "many islands and the whole of Argos.'59 Nor is the historicity of the Battle of Hysiai free from suspi- cion: Kelly wonders whether Pausanias's guides are confusing this battle with the destruction of Hysiai by the Spartans in 417 B.C.60 The importance of the Battle of Hysiai has, no doubt, been exaggerated, but despite Kelly's doubts, it is perhaps not impossible that the Thyreatid did witness the occasional clash between Argos and Sparta in the seventh century. A fragment of Tyrtaios, purporting to mention a battle between Spartans and Argives, is sometimes cited in this connection, although the mention in the same line of what might plausibly be restored as "Arcadians" would rather in- dicate an event associated with the Second Messenian War.61 Nevertheless, it is important to distinguish between Argive-Spartan clashes occurring outside the 5 The monument inside the Treasury of Minyas, which takes the form of a pi-shaped statue base, may well date to the Hellenistic period, though the tomb was certainly the seat of an imperial cult in Roman times: H.

HALL [AJA 99 territory of both poleis and a concerted policy of territorial acquisition. The archaeological material from the Thyreatid shows surprisingly little Argive influence in the Archaic period and it was the Laconian, not the Argive, script that appears to have been in use in the middle of the sixth century.62 Marie-Frangoise Billot makes the point that Argive and Spartan policy at this period was only territorial in the sense that Argos was seeking to maintain, and Sparta to extend, not their territory but their sphere of influence.63 Tomlinson and Billot argue that Argive domina- tion over the Plain was made possible by the tyrant Pheidon, who aimed to recover all the cities of the Argive Plain and the eastern Argolid, originally as- signed to the mythical king Temenos.64 The starting point for this view is a passage of Strabo, possibly derived from the fourth-century historian Ephoros of Kyme, which tells how Pheidon recovered the whole "lot" (Xfitq) of Temenos, which had been di- vided into a number of parts (gLpip).65 The "lot" is assumed to refer to the manner in which the Pelopon- nese was divided among the Herakleidai upon their return to southern Greece. According to Pausanias and Apollodoros, it was decided to allot the poleis of Argos, Lakedaimon (Sparta), and Messene to the three principal branches of the Heraklid family, headed by Temenos, Kresphontes, and Aristodemos (though in some versions, Aristodemos had already died, leaving twin sons, Prokles and Eurysthenes). The distribution was to be decided by drawing lots from a water bucket, but by means of deceit Kres- phontes cheated and won Messenia as his share.66 One could have more confidence in the belief that Pheidon conquered the Argive Plain if we could be certain when he ruled. He is, after all, credited with intervention at Corinth, Sikyon, and Olympia, so Mycenae, Tiryns, and Midea should have been easy to capture. Opinions on when he is to be dated, how- ever, are divided among three alternative periods: the second half of the eighth century (constructed from Pausanias, Aristotle, Plutarch, and Ephoros); the middle of the seventh century (based on infor- mation from Strabo and Eusebius and a textual emendation of Pausanias); and the late seventh or early sixth century (derived from Herodotus).67 Yet, the adoption of any one of these alternatives im- mediately disqualifies Pheidon from having accom- plished many of the actions attributed to him. In short, it has to be admitted that most of the infor- mation we possess for his tyranny is no more reli- able than that for Lycourgus of Sparta, and that it has undergone an immense amount of contamina- tion in later accounts. Nevertheless, even were we to accept the historicity of Pheidon's appeal to the "Lot of Temenos,' there is scope for a slightly different interpretation from the one normally given. The story of the trick-motif concerning the drawing of lots only appears in late variants of the myth. The division of the Pelopon- nese among the three Heraklid families (without the trick-motif) is certainly older, but the emphasis ap- pears to be different.68 Whereas modern scholars tend to stress the spatial element of the division whereby the Doric Peloponnese is carved up among the territories of the Argolid, Laconia, and Messenia (and, interestingly enough, omitting Corinthia), the earlier ancient sources do not. It is not the territories of the Argolid, Laconia, and Messenia that are al- lotted, but the poleis of Argos, Sparta, and (origi- 62 For the history and archaeology of Kynouria and the Thyreatid: P.

In the Apollodoran version, Kresphontes received the remaining polis of Messene, because his lot was of earth and not stone, and so dissolved in the pitcher. Pausanias, on the other hand, has Kresphontes and Temenos conspire against the sons of Aristodemos: because the lot of Prokles and Eurysthenes was sun-baked rather than fired, it dissolved in the pitch- er, leaving Kresphontes with the choice of Messene or Lakedaimon.

Once this is recognized, then it becomes clear that Xl~it in this context need not mean "that which is won by lot," but may have its more specialized connotation of "that which is ap- portioned by inheritance"; it is not by accident that Ephoros/Strabo used the word jtpoq to describe the dissipation of the hXfjtg, since this term can also mean "inheritance." Whatever the date of Pheidon's rule, his appearance among the ranks of tyrants is evi- dent proof that the legitimacy of that rule was ques- tionable. His appeal to the "Lot of Temenos" might therefore be viewed not as a prescription for the ex- tent of Argive territory but as an attempt to legiti- mate, through ancestral appeal, his own sole heredi- tary rights to power in Argos itself. THE EXTENT OF ARGIVE TERRITORY The arguments thus far have been essentially nega- tive. I have attempted to show that most of the as- sumptions concerning the extent of Argive territory are capable of more than one interpretation, and that the standard reconstruction is generally fash- ioned by later authors and by our own expectations as to the form a polis should take. It is now time to turn to more positive indications that the extent of Argive territory in the Archaic period has been con- sistently overestimated. In 1962, during restoration of the walls of the cita- del at Tiryns, the Greek Archaeological Service un- covered two syringes, or pipes, along the northwest side of the Lower Citadel. Each led to an under- ground spring and had been constructed in cyclo- pean masonry in LH III as part of a policy of water provisioning, also witnessed at Mycenae and on the Athenian Acropolis. The pipes had gone out of use at the end of the Late Helladic period, but during the Archaic period, inscriptions concerning various ritual acts were carved on their exterior, particularly on the covering slabs.70 The 23 fragments are of immense epigraphical importance, establishing for the first time that the alphabet used at Tiryns was related to the Argos- Mycenae group and not the Kleonai-Phleious group as previously thought.71 The inscription is not, how- ever, without its historical importance, because it makes reference to both a 864ioq and an &amp;taia. A itoq is the regular Doric form not only for "people" generally, but for the "sovereign people," or "popu- lar assembly." Since, in this inscription, the 86toq is empowered to choose a meeting place, it is also likely that it was able to take action at those meetings.72 'Aktiaf, on the other hand, while being the Doric form of the Attic 'Hiaia (or 'jury panel"), is also regularly attested as the West Greek equivalent to F1KKrlcta, or "assembly."73 The existence, then, of a sovereign popular body and an assembly in the years around 600 B.C. suggests very strongly that Tiryns was independent from Argos at this time.74 This conclusion receives some confirmation from a verse of the Palatine Anthology. Purporting to be part of a Delphic oracular response, it is first cited by Ion of Chios in the mid-fifth century, though was dated by Parke and Wormell to the first half of the seventh century, and describes the "linen-corseleted Argives, 69 Since Argos can mean both the city and the Argive Plain and Lakedaimon can mean both Sparta and Laconia, this would have been difficult to determine had it not been for Pindar's inclusion of Pylos (later substituted by Messene). 70 Published in N.

It is found with this meaning in SEG 13.239 (Argos, ca. 475 B.C.); IG IV.497 (Mycenae, Hellenistic); IG IV2.1, 60 and 96 (Epidauros, third century B.C.) and IG IV.479 (Nemea, third century B.C.). 74 Verdelis et al.

Foley 127 prefers to see Tiryns as a community dependent upon the polis of Argos, but her argument rests on the absence of clear set- tlement evidence for Archaic Tiryns and the fact that the Tirynthian alphabet is related to that of Argos. The first is an argument from silence: the area around Tiryns is rela- tively unexplored by contrast with Argos precisely because the latter is still heavily urbanized, thus leading to a far greater number of rescue excavations occasioned by build- ing work and the maintenance of an infrastructure: Hall (supra n. 9). The second argument, also followed by An- tonaccio 104, fails to recognize that although the Tiryn- thian script is similar to that of Argos, it is certainly not identical. The syrinx inscription provides evidence for the concurrent use of different letter forms to represent the same phoneme, and is generally more innovative than the con- temporary script of Argos: Hall (supra n. 24) 167-68.</page><page sequence="12">588 JONATHAN M. HALL [AJA 99 goads of war" as living between Tiryns and Arcadia "rich in sheep."'"75 Clearly, this passage makes no sense if Tiryns is subordinate to Argos: Argos is be- ing defined as not being Arcadia and not being Tiryns. In ca. 494 B.C., King Kleomenes of Sparta decided to launch an invasion against Argos, supposedly act- ing on a response from Apollo's oracle at Delphi. According to Herodotus (6.76-83), after failing to gain favorable omens to cross the river Erasinos, south of Argos (fig. 1), he decided instead to ship his troops across the Argolic Gulf and to disembark them near Tiryns. An Argive army set out to meet the Spartans at a place named Sepeia, near Tiryns, and after a period of time the Spartans attacked, routing the Argives and driving many of them into a nearby grove dedicated to the toponymic hero, Argos. Promising ransom, Kleomenes managed to entice about 50 Argives to leave the grove, where- upon they were promptly killed. The remaining men were burnt alive when Kleomenes ordered his helots to set fire to the grove. Upon hearing that the grove was named Argos (after the hero), Kleomenes is sup- posed to have complained that Apollo's prophecy that he would "take Argos" had been fulfilled even before reaching the actual city. Herodotus goes on to say that Kleomenes therefore dismissed all but 1,000 of his men and went on to offer sacrifice at the Heraion, where, upon being forbidden to do so as a stranger, he had the priest of Hera flogged.76 Plutarch and Pausanias do not mention the incident at the Heraion, but have Kleomenes march on the city of Argos itself, where he was forced to retreat in the face of resistance mounted by slaves and women, organized under the poetess Telesilla.77 The passage is an extremely difficult exercise in exegesis, not least because the emphasis of Herodotus is not on early Argive history, but on the character of Kleomenes. It is, in fact, one of four hypotheses given to account for why the gods punished him with the insanity that resulted in his horrific suicide, by self-mutilation, ca. 490 B.C.78 One might interpret Kleomenes' sacrifice at the Heraion as a symbolic mainmise on Argos,79 but the Herodotean passage does not actually support such a reading. When, on his return, he was summoned before the Ephors on a charge of having accepted a bribe not to take Argos, the Spartan king argued that he was afraid that his unwitting destruction of the grove of Argos may have already fulfilled the meaning of the oracle, and that he was therefore unwilling to take further action until he had consulted the god again. Since the Heraion was the most important sanctuary in the Argolid, it is not surprising that Kleomenes went there to see if the gods would grant him some kind of sign. Nor was he disappointed; while sacrificing in the sanc- tuary, a flame shot out from the breast of Hera's cult statue. Kleomenes managed to convince his judges that had the flame appeared from the head of the statue he would have felt encouraged to attack Argos, but since it only came from the breast the oracle had already been fulfilled.80 In strictly narrative terms, the decision to go to the Heraion is intimately connected with Kleomenes'failure to take Argos. In any case, the Heraion incident bears all the hall- marks of not always having been an integral part of this episode. The motif of Kleomenes persisting with a sacrifice in defiance of religious prohibi- tions against xenoi appears elsewhere in Herodotus (5.72.3-4), when he ignores the attempts by the priestess of Athena Polias at Athens to bar him from offering sacrifice on the Acropolis. Furthermore, it is directly contradictory with the alternative tradi- tion followed by Plutarch and Pausanias: in Herod- otus, the Heraion episode functions as an excuse for not attacking the city of Argos, whereas in Plu- tarch and Pausanias it is redundant, because Kleo- menes did attempt to attack the city. Plutarch makes it clear that he is not following the Herodotean ver- sion, since he casts doubt on the commonly cited casualty figure for Sepeia of 7,777; Herodotus 75 Anth. Pal. 14.73. See H. Parke and D. Wormell, The Delphic Oracle 1 (Oxford 1956) 82-83. 76 It is interesting that Hdt. 6.81 specifically refers to a priest, since we normally hear of a priestess at the Heraion: e.g., Hes. fr. 124 Merkelbach/West; Akousilaos FGrHist 2.26; Apollod. Bibl. 2.1.3 (Io); Thuc. 2.2.1; Paus. 2.17.7, 3.5.6 (Khrysis); Thuc. 4.133.2-3 (Khrysis, Phaeinis). It is possible that this reference provides some information on the ad- ministrative personnel at the Heraion, though it is more likely that it reveals the dubious nature of Herodotus's sources for this episode. 77 Plut.

Gordon ed., Myth, Religion and Society (Cambridge 1981) 187-200. 78 The four hypotheses are 1) it was a punishment for having bribed the Pythian priestess into denying King Demaratos's legitimacy (held by the majority of Greeks-- including Herodotus); 2) it was a punishment for having laid waste the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore at Eleusis (the Athenian version); 3) it was a punishment for having burned down the grove of Argos (the Argive version); 4) it was the tragic consequence of adopting the Scythian habit of drinking wine neat (the Spartan version). 79 As does Polignac 87. 8so I-dt. 6.82.1-2.</page><page sequence="13">1995] HOW ARGIVE WAS THE "ARGIVE" HERAION? 589 (7.148.2) had put the figure at 6,000. The fact that the Heraion incident appears in a version that is at- tested earlier provides no argument for its authen- ticity, especially since it is prefaced by a Delphic or- acle that explicitly refers to the "victory of the female over the male." What is interesting for the purposes of this article are the details of Kleomenes' assault, since Herodo- tus (6.76.2) records that the Spartans landed in the chora of Tiryns and Nauplia-not Argive territory. It is also clear that the Spartans met no resistance from the Tirynthians and Naupliotes, perhaps be- cause they were aware that they were not under di- rect threat from Kleomenes. Instead, an Argive army had to advance out into the Plain and meet the Spartan army at Sepeia. Evidently, the local inhabi- tants of Tiryns and Nauplia had no military obli- gations to the polis of Argos and, in light of the evi- dence already presented, it would appear unlikely that they had any political obligations either. There is one further example that suggests inde- pendence on the part of the communities of the east- ern Plain. Argos did not participate in the Greek resistance against Xerxes' invasion in 480 B.C. There were rumors that the Persians had proposed a treaty of neutrality with Argos on the basis of a fictive shared ancestry, and some even claimed that Argos had invited the Persians to invade, but the Argive apologia (which Herodotus accepts) claimed that while the ostensible reason for non-participation was the Spartan refusal to share command and to grant a 30-year truce, the underlying genuine reason was a chronic lack of manpower as a result of the crushing defeat at Sepeia.81 Nevertheless, although the Ar- gives remained aloof from the resistance, Mycenae provided 80 hoplites at the Battle of Thermopylai in 480 B.C., and Mycenae and Tiryns fielded a joint force of 400 hoplites at the Battle of Plataia in 479 B.C.2' Despite its position of neutrality, Argos was powerless to prevent the participation of Mycenae and Tiryns, and the appearance of their names on the Serpent Column at Delphi and the statue of Zeus at Olympia can only have served to exacerbate the absence of the name of Argos. There are, then, four instances throughout the Archaic period at which the communities of the east- ern Plain appear to have enjoyed political indepen- dence: sometime in the seventh century? (the Pala- tine Anthology); ca. 600 B.C. (the Tiryns inscription); ca. 494 B.C. (Kleomenes' invasion); and 480 B.C. (the Persian Wars). Some scholars, such as de Ste. Croix, have attempted to posit several fluctuations in Argive domination of the Plain, arguing that Kleomenes freed Mycenae and Tiryns from Argive control in 494 B.C., but there is no literary testimony that the eastern cities were freed in the 490s, nor again that they had succumbed to Argive domination in the sixth cen- tury (after the Tirynthian inscription).83 In light of the evidence currently available, there is littlejustifica- tion in assuming that the territory of Argos extended across the whole Argive Plain until the destructions of Mycenae, Tiryns, and Midea in the 460s B.C.84 The consequences of this territorial acquisition soon made their mark in the epigraphical record. In the period 460-450 B.C., Argive citizens were defined, for the first time, according to a phratronym, and it has been argued that this is not simply an epigraphical phenomenon but represents a radical institutional reform in the mid-fifth century.85 While some of the phratries appear to take their names from Argolic heroes (Kleodaidai, Temenidai, Daiphonteis, Melanippidai, Amphiareteidai), others are formed from specific localities (Arakhnadai, Pholygadai, Paionidai, Arkoidai, Kerkadai).86 Whether or not Argive citizens were originally assigned to phratries on the basis of residence, it would be strange if the localities from which certain phratries derived their name did not belong to Argive territory.87 The ap- 81 Hdt. 7.148-52. 82 Hdt. 7.202, 9.28.4; Diod.

The earliest evidence for phratronyms appears in an unpublished inscription that lists the phratries belonging to the phyle of the Hyrnathioi.

There are, for example, no attested ex- amples of a member of the Arakhnadai living at Arakhnas: Charneux (supra n. 85) 221. Nevertheless, the principle of partible inheritance makes it difficult to retroject this observation back to the mid-fifth century.</page><page sequence="14">590 JONATHAN M. HALL [AJA 99 Fig. 3. View of the Argive Plain from the Larissa. The pale line running from left to right across the center of the figure is the Inakhos River. pearance, then, among the phratronyms of the Heraieis and the Naupliadai should provide evidence that the land around the Heraion (later known as the kome of Prosymna) and around Nauplia was Argive by the period 460-450 B.C.88 It is probably not too fanciful to believe that it was the acquisition of ter- ritory like this, together with the incorporation of more people into the Argive citizen body, that ne- cessitated such a radical institutional reform in the first place. Determining territorial boundaries for the Archaic period is always somewhat anachronistic, not least because the apparatus of control in the ancient polis was more personal, dominating social relations rather than abstract spatial concepts.89 It was, after all, membership in the political community that gave entitlement to land, not vice versa. I would suggest, however, that in the Archaic period the plots of land worked by those who were part of the political com- munity of Argos did not generally extend across the Inakhos River, which divides the Argive Plain into its eastern and western halves (fig. 3). The river is a natural boundary of sorts, in that its seasonality makes it notoriously unstable. Even today, it tends to flood, on average, every 15 years, sometimes with catastrophic results.90 There is, of course, no need to be dogmatic about this "boundary," particularly if the communities of the Plain were living in peace- ful coexistence. In less settled times, however, grad- ual encroachment across the Inakhos for the pur- poses of cultivation would have proved unwise as long as a potentially hostile Mycenae controlled the mountains overlooking the northeastern corner of the Plain. All the evidence suggests that Mycenae maintained her independence until the mid-fifth cen- tury, and so it would be reasonable to expect the Inakhos to have acted as a de facto, if not de iure, eastern boundary to Argive territory. Are there any indications, however, that might substantiate this proposition? Attempting to calculate how much land an ancient population needed is always problematic, especially since we have no reliable figures for the population of Argos.91 The 20,000 capacity of the Hellenistic theater at Argos is of little help, since by that time a series of synoikismoi had swelled the ranks of the citizen body; in any case, Hellenistic Argos was the locus for a number of festivals attracting visitors from outside the Argolid, the most notable of which was the Nemean Games.92 Herodotus's figure of the 6,000 Sepeia casualties (assumed to be virtually the whole of the adult male population) is generally consid- 88 For the names: M. Pierart, "Phratries et 'k6mai' d'Argos," BCH 107 (1983) 270. 89 In addition, as Antonaccio (supra n. 7) points out, political, cultural, subsistence, and cultic boundaries need not be coterminous. 90 E.

An estimate of 4,000 adult male citizens would not seem unreasonable. For fourth-century Athens, it has been argued that an adult male citizen body of 20,000 to 30,000 would yield a total population of 150,000 -a ratio of 1:5- 1:7.5, which when applied to an Argive citizenry of 4,000 would result in a total population of between 20,000 and 30,000.94 There is little doubt, however, that Archaic populations were considerably smaller than fourth-century ones, not least because the cities of the Late Classical period housed greater num- bers of metics and slaves. A figure of 20,000-25,000 for the total population of Archaic Argos should probably be regarded as an absolute maximum. Today, the city of Argos supports a population of a little over 20,000, and the western half of the Plain (i.e., to the west of the Inakhos River) a total of about 31,000 inhabitants, though the comparison may not be terribly useful, since a sizeable proportion of the population is engaged in service industries, such as banking and tourism.95 Tomlinson has estimated that the ancient city of Argos could have provided space for an urban population of about 10,000.96 This would entail a rural population of landowners who did not live in the city, a supposition made all the more likely by the discovery of rural sites of the Archaic period, such as Akhladokambos and Skhinokhori (fig. 1).97 Lehmann calculated that while the Argolid as a whole could only support an average of 29 inhabitants per square kilometer, the Plain itself might support 585 inhabitants per square kilometer.98 On this calculation, a population of be- tween 20,000 and 25,000 would require only 34-43 km2, or less than a quarter of the total area of the Argive Plain. Thus, even with a broad degree of lati- tude in calculation, it is not at all impossible that the land west of the Inakhos was sufficient for the population of Archaic Argos. The land to the south of the city may not have been quite as fertile as it is today, since - as at Asine - it had been a backshore lagoon prior to being filled in by alluvial deposition in the Early Bronze Age, but there is a large extent of very fertile land to the northwest of Argos, stretch- ing toward the modern villages of Skhinokhori and Lirkia, that is shielded and, for the most part, over- looked by the Larissa acropolis.99 It is well known that one of the many functions of myth is to explain topographic disposition in the present by inscribing it in the legendary past, and the extent of Argive territory proposed above finds its mythical reflection in two unrelated episodes.'00 Both involve couples who are used to define the northern and southern limits of the Argive chora. The first is a fragment from the Argolika of Hellanikos of Lesbos, which describes the division of inheritance among the sons of the Argive king Triopas.'o0 Ac- cording to Hellanikos, Pelasgos received a tract of land as far as the Erasinos River and including the Larissa acropolis, lasos received the land stretching toward Elis, and Agenor inherited his father's horse. The inequitable settlement, whereby Pelasgos and Iasos shared the inheritance of land while Agenor received only a horse, may be explained by the fact that, according to the scholiast to Euripides' Orestes (1246), Pelasgos and Iasos were twins. In this particular myth, the role of Agenor is rela- tively unimportant: indeed, this much could be de- duced by the fact that he belongs to a group of figures whose names are essentially descriptive (Agenor means "heroic" or "manly"), and to whom virtually no tales are attached.102 The emphasis is, instead, on Pelasgos and Iasos who function, in the first place, 93 W.G.

HALL [AJA 99 as rationalizations for why Argos is described vari- ously as "Pelasgian" and "lasian," but also serve to demarcate the territorial space of Argive territory through the motif of the partible inheritance.'103 Wilamowitz attempted to correct "the land stretch- ing towards Elis" to read "the land as far as the Inakhos River," but the meaning is essentially the same, since Hellanikos is not referring to literally all the terri- tory between Argos and Elis, but to the territory lying "in the direction of Elis," which must have followed the Inakhos valley as it winds its way northwest- ward from the Plain in the vicinity of the villages of Skhinokhori and Lirkia. The twins' inheritance, then, identifies the two areas of cultivation that have already been proposed: the land stretching south- ward to the Erasinos River and-beyond it-Lerna, and the sheltered Plain to the northwest of Argos. This motif of a mythical couple being used to define Argive territory is repeated in the story of Hypermestra and Lynkeus, the daughter and son-in- law of Danaos. Hypermestra, as one of the daughters of Danaos, is intimately connected with the Erasinos/ Lerna region: it was near Lerna that Danaos landed, and it was at Lerna that his daughters dedicated a stone statue to Aphrodite and buried the decapitated bodies of their murdered husbands.104 But Hyper- mestra, like Pelasgos, is also associated with the Larissa acropolis, and it is from here that she lit a beacon to communicate her safety to Lynkeus, who, alone of the sons of Aigyptos, had escaped to Lyrkeia (probably to be situated at the modern Skhinokhori rather than Lirkia).'05 Finally, there is the evidence of Orneai, which is situated in the Plain to the northwest of Argos, but on the further side of the Inakhos River. Interestingly enough, Orneai appears to have retained its inde- pendence until 416 B.C.1'06 In 418 B.C., it was allied to Argos, but two years later it was occupied by the Spar- tans who settled Argive exiles there. This prompted an attack by the Argives and the Athenians and the town of Orneai itself was destroyed.'07 The Orneatai were apparently incorporated into the Argive citi- zen body, and the site of Orneai became a kome.'08 The example appears to reinforce the conclusion that a concerted policy of Argive expansion into the Plain did not occur before the fifth century B.C. On balance, then, the evidence points to a less ex- tensive Argive chora than is normally assumed. In general, for most of the Archaic period we can take the practical boundaries of Argive territory to be the Artemision range of mountains to the west, the Erasinos River/Lerna region to the south, and the Inakhos River to the east and north. The situation changes in the 460s with the destructions of Mycenae, Tiryns, and Midea (and perhaps also of Nauplia) on the eastern side of the Plain, though this process was only finally completed with the subjugation of Orneai in 416 B.C. In the light of this informa- tion, it is clear that the establishment of the Heraion on the eastern side of the Plain cannot be associ- ated with the demarcation of Argive territory in the eighth century. In what follows, I shall concentrate on the sanctuaries of the Plain, and in particular the Heraion, to demonstrate that this evidence con- firms the picture sketched so far and to suggest a different role for the Heraion within the cultic sys- tem of the Argive Plain. THE CULTIC GEOGRAPHY OF THE ARGIVE PLAIN The Procession of Hera Argeia For Polignac, the most important visual symbol linking Argos and the Heraion is the procession of armed youths, maidens, and cattle that left the city for the rural sanctuary. As he now recognizes, how- ever, we cannot be at all certain that the establish- ment of the festal procession (and the associated games) coincided with the establishment of the sanc- tuary. While the earliest known temple at the Heraion is unlikely to predate the seventh century, the votive material appears earlier.109 The earliest sherd to be 103 For the description of Argos as "Pelasgian" and "Iasian"; Hom.

However, a date of the first half of the seventh century was given by P. Amandry, "Observations sur les monuments de l'Heraion d'Argos," Hesperia 21 (1952) 225 and has recently been redefended by I. Strom, "The Early Sanctuary of the Argive Heraion and Its External Relations (8th-Early 6th Cent. B.C.). The Monumental Architecture," ActaArch 59 (1988) 191. The suggestion of a sixth-century date in B. Bergquist, The Archaic Greek Temenos: A Study of Structure and Function (Lund 1967) 19-20 has, as far as I am aware, received no overall support. H. Drerup, Griechische Baukunst in geometrischer Zeit (ArchHom II, G6ttingen 1969) 57-89 and Antonaccio 95-98 argue that the "cyclopean" terrace on which the Old Temple stands should have been purposely built for the temple in the</page><page sequence="17">1995] HOW ARGIVE WAS THE 'ARGIVE" HERAION? 593 illustrated in the publication is of MG II (ca. 780-740 B.C.), but Str0m has argued that Protogeometric pot- tery may be implicated by the report of high-footed bowls."1 Likewise, the earliest pins and fibulae found should also date to the Protogeometric period."' This early date for the pins and fibulae suggests three possibilities: 1) they belong to a non-cultic context; 2) they are "heirlooms," dedicated up to three cen- turies after their manufacture; or 3) they provide some tentative evidence for dedication as early as the Protogeometric period. As far as the first alternative is concerned, such items of personal jewelry are extremely rare in do- mestic contexts in the Argolid and should therefore originate in either burials or dedications."2 The Heraion was not, however, the site of an organized cemetery in the Early Iron Age, and no Protogeo- metric burials are attested."" The second alternative would be more credible if it were a matter of more valuable objects such as bronze bowls, but one may legitimately wonder whether it is entirely plausible that small, functional items such as pins would be handed down from generation to generation over a period of two to three centuries. The third alternative is normally dismissed due to the now orthodox view that archaeologically vis- ible cult should be the exception, rather than the rule, throughout the "Dark Ages" until the "Greek renaissance" of the later eighth century B.C. Yet, in- dications of Dark Age cult have long been known on the Athenian Acropolis and Mount Hymettos in Attica, in the Idaian and Diktaian caves on Crete, at Amyklai in Laconia, Agia Irini on Kea, Kameiros on Rhodes, Aitos on Ithaca, and the Samian Heraion; the earliest material from the Sanctuary of Posei- don at Isthmia dates back to the mid-llth century and recent excavations at Olympia may suggest a similarly early date for the commencement of cult there.114 To argue that the absence of dedications at the sites of future sanctuaries precludes earlier cultic enactment is to commit what Snodgrass terms the "positivist fallacy," which conflates what is archae- ologically visible with what is historically signifi- cant."5 Pierart and Polignac have both pointed out that the archaeological appearance of dedications in the later eighth century may indicate not so much the beginning of cult activity but a mutation in rit- ual behavior, which results in the deposition of greater numbers of imperishable votive objects, while Higg has suggested that metalwork was dedicated in sanctuaries at an earlier date than pottery."16 In light of this, it is not impossible that the earliest pins seventh century, though C.W Blegen, "Prosymna: Remains of Post-Mycenaean Date," AJA 43 (1939) 427-28 had argued for a late eighth-century date for the terrace. Wright 186-92 and Foley 135-36 follow Blegen's dating and suggest that the terrace may have supported an earlier mudbrick temple, possibly represented by a Subgeometric terracotta archi- tectural model. For the model: K. Miller, "Gebiudemodelle spatgeometrischer Zeit," AM 48 (1923) 52-68; G. Oikono- mou, "'O SK -To0 'Apysiouo Hpaiou o ltitvoq OiKioKOq KWaU&amp; veav ouaurtnk~ipootv," ArchEph 1931, 1-53; P. Courbin, La ceramique geometrique d'Argolide (Paris 1966) 248. However, scepticism over whether the model represents a temple at all is expressed by K. Fagerstr6m, Greek Iron Age Archi- tecture: Developments through Changing Times (SIMA 81, G6te- borg 1988) 29; Strom (supra) 191; Morgan and Whitelaw 84, n. 25; and Antonaccio 97. Finally, a Mycenaean date for the terrace has been proposed by H. Plommer, "Shadowy Megara,"JHS 97 (1977) 76; Plommer, "The Old Platform in the Argive Heraeum,"JHS 104 (1984) 183-84. 110 Str0m (supra n. 109) 175; Antonaccio 90.

This story is placed in the mouth of the Athenian lawgiver Solon, in a di- dactic lecture to Croesus of Lydia. Kleobis and Biton were two youths of Argos, whose mother was the priestess of Hera. When the time of the procession came around, the oxen who were to draw the priestess's cart along the processional way from Argos to the Heraion had not yet arrived from the fields, so Kleobis and Biton took up the yoke and pulled their mother 45 stades to the Heraion. On their arrival, their mother requested the goddess to grant them the greatest mortal blessing, and the two youths entered the temple where they fell into a deep and 117 Strom (supra n. 109) 176.

This folktale is usually adduced as evidence for the great (albeit mythical) antiquity of the procession from Argos to the Heraion.119 Yet, the meeting between Solon and Croesus almost cer- tainly never took place and, in their commentary to the Histories, How and Wells noted that the epi- sode is more characteristic of Herodotus's "mentalite" than it is of Solon's.120 Certainly, the motif of being blessed with eternal sleep after exertion in the service of the deity is not exclusive to the Kleobis and Biton tale, and recurs in the story of Trophonios and Agamedes, who were granted this peaceful end after having built the first stone temple to Apollo at Delphi. If Plutarch is right to attribute the Delphi variant of the motif to Pindar, then it may actually slightly predate the Kleobis and Biton story.121 In short, there is no independent evidence that the Kleobis and Biton myth had enjoyed any long-lived currency by the time Herodotus picked it up, either in Argos or, more probably, in Delphi. Herodotus ends his story of Kleobis and Biton by remarking that the Argives set up statues of them at Delphi, and it is principally for this reason that the two "Delphi kouroi" are traditionally associated with the myth (fig. 4). The first of these kouroi was discovered in May 1893, about 2-3 m northwest of the Treasury of the Athenians; six months later, the base was recovered on which were traced the letters -]t&amp;EESg EoltFes hapystog ("-medes the Argive made [me]"). The kouros was originally entitled the "Apollo of the Argive school" and dated to the early sixth century B.C. However, with the discovery the follow- ing May of five fragments of a similar (though not identical) figure only 10 m to the south of the first, the Apollo identification was dropped. Despite earlier suggestions that they might be representations of the Dioskouroi, the conservators of the Delphi Museum decided that the "farmers' boots" that they appeared to wear and the muscular stress of the arms, indicating that they might be dragging or pushing something, identified them as the Archaic statues of Kleobis and Biton mentioned by Herodotus. It was for this reason that, despite the virtual illegi- bility of the fragmentary inscribed base to the sec- ond kouros, which was discovered in 1907, a fanciful restoration of the inscription was made: A. [K),optq Kai Bi]`Tov itv ita-rdpa oara6ioq [TsTp6?ovTa] B. [nwtv-] dyayov rt81 uy6t [huno66vrsq] [...]!68;q itnotss hapy'ioq.122 [Kleobis and Bi]ton [submitted] to the yoke and led their mother [forty-] five stades. [-]medes of Argos made [it]. In 1982, this identification was challenged by Vatin, who claimed to read the inscription HOAYAEYKH[E] running up the left thigh of "Kleobis," thus arguing that the two statues represented not Kleobis and Biton, but Kastor and Polydeukes, the Dioskouroi.123 Although this particular inscription is often thought to be somewhat illusory a number of scholars are now returning to a Dioskouroi identification. Faure confessed that he could not read the inscription on the thigh, but he did defend the identification by proposing a new reconstructed version of the inscrip- tions on the two bases: B. "r[oi]v favdotv r"oiv Atubq [T6v6E] Ho[,]uot~i6; EnofCEE hapysioq. A. At]tdq hutto[tv ?'Apirtoo'ys]&amp;ov r6vO' EtoIfs[s 'Apy6ioq. B. Polymedes the Argive made [this] for the twin lords, the sons of Zeus. A. [Aristogeiton the Argive] made this for the twin sons of Zeus.124 Noting the importance of cults to the Dioskouroi in both Delphi and Argos, Faure argued that a small unidentified building of the early sixth century, with which the two statues appeared to be associated, should be a shrine to the twin sons of Zeus.125 In the final event, the inscriptions on the bases of the Delphi kouroi are so worn that any arguments based solely on epigraphical considerations must remain inconclusive. There may, however, be some iconographical support for the Dioskouroi identifica- tion. In claiming the kouroi as Kleobis and Biton, the conservators of the Delphi Museum pointed to what they interpreted as farmer's boots: unlike most kouroi, the details of the feet and toes are not carved. There are, however, other very striking attributes. Ridgway has pointed to striations on the legs and arms that are reminiscent of greaves and arm-guards. 119 E.g., Morgan and Whitelaw 84. 120 WW.

Remains of Archaic temple beneath the church of Profitis Ilias, near Agios Adrianos She also noted that the epigastric arch resembled a corselet, and Croissant has remarked on the simi- larities between the torso of"Kleobis" and the corse- let deposited in the Panoply Tomb (T45) of Argos.126 While musculature resembling corselets is not unique to the Delphi kouroi, the observation is very sug- gestive and if at all meaningful would point to an identification of the youths as warriors rather than farmers. More illuminating is a parallel provided by a bronze coin, struck under the emperor Commodus at Troizen. Its reverse depicts a group of two kouroi, identified from Pausanias as the Dioskouroi, made for Troizen by the Archaic sculptor Hermon.'27 Re- vealingly, the kouroi on this coin display the very stylistic characteristics normally regarded as being regionally specific in the case of the Delphi kouroi, notably their flexed arms, short torsos, and over- developed thigh muscles. Neither the Herodotean notice, then, nor the Delphi kouroi provide firm evidence for an Archaic procession linking Argos with the Heraion. The earliest unequivocal evidence connecting the city of Argos (as opposed to the Argive Plain more gener- ally) to the Sanctuary of Hera comes in Pindar's 10th Nemean Ode, normally dated to ca. 464 B.C.128 Cults of Hera in the Argive Plain Although the "Paris School" ofJean-Pierre Vernant has made an undoubted contribution to the study of religion in Greek antiquity, its emphasis on "Greek" thought or "Greek" religion has tended to obscure a fact known to earlier scholars, namely, that reli- gious beliefs and practices varied from region to re- gion.129 For instance, the importance attributed to the Dioskouroi in the Peloponnese in general, and at Sparta in particular, is not equaled everywhere in Greece, and the Iphigeneia worshipped at Brauron and Hermione is a far more fearful and divine be- ing than the girlish figure that myth remembered as the daughter of Agamemnon. In this section, I argue that religious beliefs and practices varied even within the Argive Plain. The eastern half of the Argive Plain accorded a particular honor to the goddess Hera. The obvious example is the Heraion itself, but it is important to view this sanctuary within a more extensive cultic system to Hera, focused on the eastern half of the 126 B.S.

Myth told how the Kanathos spring near Nauplia was the scene of the annual renewal of Hera's virginity.'30 Six miles to the northeast of Nauplia, on the Profitis Ilias hill near Agios Adrianos, are the remains of a small peak sanctuary, which may also have been dedicated to Hera. Beneath the church were excavated the foundations of a small structure, oriented east-west, which appears to date to the Archaic period (fig. 5). Apart from some Late Hel- ladic material, a votive deposit of sherds, figurines, pins, fibulae, miniature skyphoi, and a small bronze phiale points to a date in the seventh century. Nearby, a small cave yielded a further deposit of ceramic and metal objects among traces of fire and ashes. Of par- ticular interest is the square catchplate to a lead fibula of the mid-seventh century. It portrays a woman, in profile and wearing a long chiton and polos, facing a man who clasps his cloak. The icono- graphical attributes (particularly the polos), together with the fact that the relief finds parallels at both the Heraion and the Sanctuary of Hera Akraia at Perachora, have suggested to Alexandri that the woman is Hera.'3' The appearance among the Profitis Ilias votives of a bronze phiale is also noteworthy. Table 1 shows the distribution of certain artifacts at sanctuaries either known or suspected to be dedicated to Hera. What emerges is that the bronze phiale is a typical dedication to Hera, unattested at sanctuaries to other deities in the Argolid.132 Opinion is generally divided as to what determines the composition of artifactual assemblages within sanctuaries. In a study of Apollo sanctuaries in the Peloponnese, Dengate has argued that the sorts of objects dedicated are dictated by the nature of the cult and the identity of the divine recipient.'33 Cer- tainly, the types of artifacts found in the Sanctuary of Artemis at Brauron in Attica reflect Artemis's con- cerns with transition rites and particularly the Arkteia ritual that was enacted at Brauron. Similarly, the appearance of bronze horses and bulls among the dedications at the Sanctuary of Poseidon on Kalaureia, or the martial dedications at the Sanctu- ary of Enyalios at Asprokhoma, near Mycenae, would appear to be determined by the nature of the deity to whom they were offered.134 On the other hand, artifacts such as skyphoi and aryballoi, which Dengate considers characteristic vo- tives to Apollo, also appear in Argolic sanctuaries dedicated to Hera, Demeter, Artemis, and Athena, suggesting that divinities cannot simply be identified from votive offerings.'35 The appearance at the 130 Paus. 2.38.2. 131 E.

HALL [AJA 99 Heraion of what are often described as "feminine" dedications, such asjewelry or hydriai, may say more about the donors than the divine recipient, just as "masculine" dedications, such as kraters or tripod cauldrons, evoke male activities rather than the nature of Hera. In fact, the two viewpoints need not be mutually exclusive. If we make the reasonable assumption that the choice of divinity to whom dedications are offered is seldom accidental, then there may prove to be a certain correlation between votive types, the dedicating group, and the divinity honored. That is to say, while the sorts of objects dedicated may ultimately be determined by the composition of the dedicating group, it is the dedicating group itself that chooses the cult to which such dedications are to be offered. Without positing a direct and unmedi- ated relationship between votive types and divini- ties, the evidence of table 1 does suggest that there is a degree of significant correlation between cer- tain artifacts- particularly bronze phialai and clay wreaths- and Hera cults. By the beginning of LG I (ca. 740 B.C.), the citadel at Tiryns was witness to an important cult, to judge from two large deposits of material.'36 Whether a narrow, rectangular structure built directly on the Late Helladic megaron is a Geometric temple, as Schliemann and Gercke thought, or an LH IIIC hasty reconstruction, as Blegen and Kilian preferred, is a matter of dispute.'37 There is some disagreement as to the identity of the deity worshipped on the Tiryns citadel. When the syrinx inscriptions were first discovered,Jameson suggested that the citadel cult may have been dedi- cated to Athena, since she is the deity who appears to preside, with Zeus, over the group mentioned by the regulations.'38 In a more recent article, however, he seems less anxious to defend this identification. Instead, he has suggested that the terracotta masks discovered in a bothros on the citadel should, by analogy with masks found in the Sanctuary of Artemis Ortheia at Sparta, be connected with an ado- lescent ritual in honor of a female divinity and a male hero. The hero intimately associated with Tiryns was Herakles (see infra), whose name, "glory of Hera," should suggest that Hera is his divine partner.139 It is unfortunate that the extant fragments of the syrinx inscriptions do not mention Hera by name. On the other hand, it is Hera who is consistently associated with Tiryns more than any other deity in the literary tradition, and it is her name that ap- pears on the base to a bowl of the Classical period, found on the citadel.140 The identification may be strengthened by the appearance of wreaths and pomegranates among the votives (table 1), and by the striking parallels between many of the votives at Tiryns and those at the Heraion; indeed, an argu- ment has been made that the terracotta figurines of seated goddesses at Tiryns are meant to evoke the cult statue of Hera.141 A location for the Athena cult, on the other hand, is probably better sought in the vicinity of the eastern gateway to the citadel, where two Archaic votive bronze helmets, a fourth-century terracotta head of Athena, a fragment of a miniature shield-band, three seventh-century kantharoi, and the rim of a black-glazed krater, bearing an inscribed dedication to Athena, were found.142 The case of the citadel sanctuary at Mycenae 136 From the original excavations, Schliemann recovered a large quantity of votives from the southeastern corner of the citadel walls. These included about 100 miniature Protocorinthian vases such as skyphoi, oinochoai, and pyxides, as well as a large number of undated vases such as kantharoi, one-handled cups, cooking pots, and bowls. Apart from pottery, a large number of terracotta figurines (seated and standing females, horsemen, and more unusual types); bronze bowls, pins, and rings; iron pins; and a lead wreath were found: A.

The poorly preserved remains visible today are of a Hellenistic non- peripteral temple, oriented north-south. An earlier seventh-century temple certainly existed, since some of its architectural members and roof tiles were in- corporated into the later structure, and there is evi- dence for massive terrace walls dating to the Geo- metric period. Further information, however, has come to light in the form of a notebook for the 1939 excavations of the citadel, kept by Stubbings.143 Be- neath a tightly packed clayey layer (level 2), which probably served as a bedding for the Hellenistic temple foundations, was a black earth layer (level 3), which contained two bronze pins, four bronze rings, a bronze disc, three iron rings, an iron nail, and pot- tery fragments of both painted and incised ware.144 The presence of the bronze and iron artifacts strongly suggests a cultic rather than a domestic function. The finds themselves are of immense interest for the dating of pre-Archaic activity on the citadel ter- race. One of the bronze pins found in the black earth layer falls under Kilian-Dirlmeier's type 1B, which is rarely found in contexts later than Early Geomet- ric.145 Furthermore, Stubbings noted the occurrence of high conical bases of cups, as well as a sherd dec- orated with a hatched triangle: both indicate strongly the presence of Protogeometric pottery.146 The pre- liminary evidence, then, might suggest that the citadel sanctuary at Mycenae, like the Heraion, dates back to the Protogeometric period. If the black earth layer represents a destruction level, as Stubbings sug- gested, this probably occurred before the last quar- ter of the eighth century, since although Protocorin- thian material is attested in level 2, it is not recorded for level 3.147 There is no direct evidence for the deity wor- shipped on the citadel at Mycenae. The sanctuary is often attributed to Athena on the basis of a bronze plaque, dated ca. 500 B.C. or a little later, which carries an infuriatingly enigmatic inscription: 4 pahtaptiaq MulKaveaOsv nap' AlOavataq s;q iroXoqI LtKSTa EYEVTO ro ' Avrta Kat Iouplfta. itv 86 Avrtlag Kat KtOtog KaiolXPOv.

Let Antias, Kithios, and Aiskhron be [thejudges?]"- or, alternatively-"Antias, Kithios, and Aiskhron ab- solved him").148 The translation is still a matter of great dispute. Fraenkel believed that the mention of Athena and the city/citadel should identify the sanctuary on the acropolis at Mycenae as that of Athena, though Voll- graff realized that the Sanctuary of Athena need not be in Mycenae at all, and suggested that Phrahiaridas is a citizen of Mycenae who is now returning there from a sanctuary of Athena, perhaps the one on the Larissa at Argos.149 In any case, the inscription pro- vides no conclusive evidence connecting a cult of Athena to the citadel of Mycenae. If one had to seek another identification for the citadel sanctuary at Mycenae, that of Hera imme- diately suggests itself, especially since a boundary stone to a sanctuary of Hera, dated ca. 500 B.C., was discovered to have been reused as a dividing block 143 I am grateful to the Managing Committee of the Brit- ish School at Athens and to Lisa French and Nancy Klein for permission to cite information from this notebook prior to Klein's publication of the citadel sanctuary.

The sketch is not accurate enough for total certainty, but the closest parallel for the motif would appear to be on a Protogeometric lekythos excavated by Wace in a trench close to Grave Circle A in the 1920s and illustrated in V.R.d'A Desborough, Protogeo- metric Pottery (Oxford 1952) pl. 28B, no. 112.

HALL [AJA 99 for the western basin of the Hellenistic Perseia Foun- tain House, some 100 m west of the Lion Gate.1'5) In the Iliad, Hera is intimately associated with Mycenae, and it has been argued that the massive Late Helladic relief that surmounts the Lion Gate represents Hera through the aniconic depiction of a pillar flanked by two lionesses, animals that were particularly associated with the goddess.'151 Given this close association, it might not be terribly sur- prising to find Hera's sanctuary crowning the sum- mit of the acropolis, as at Tiryns.152 The evidence is highly circumstantial, but there are some indica- tions that would not contradict such an identification. First, in the excavations of 1939, a fragment of a terracotta ox, perhaps of the Archaic period, was discovered on the northern "Prinaria" terrace im- mediately below the temple; an ox would be an ap- propriate dedication to a goddess who had particu- lar associations with cattle, and who is described in the Homeric epics as "cow-faced."'"153 Secondly, there is the well-known fragmentary limestone relief, found on the acropolis, and deriv- ing from the Archaic temple. Dating to the last third of the seventh century B.C., it depicts a woman re- moving a veil (anakalypsis).154 The gesture is fre- quently associated with brides by the Classical period, but it is hard to believe that such an early relief de- picts a mortal bride, especially since other fragmen- tary reliefs from the same series are replete with mythical imagery. If we assume that the relief rep- resents a goddess, then the normal candidates would be Demeter or Hera. Since, however, Demeter is in- frequently represented in Greek art before the middle of the sixth century, and since Demeter cults are rare in the Argive Plain, compared with the east- ern Argolid, it is reasonable to assume that the re- lief depicts Hera.155 Finally, a sherd that appears to carry a dedication to Hera has recently come to light among the ma- terial from the Citadel House, an area in which vast quantities of soil and sherds, washed down from the upper slopes of the acropolis, had accumulated.156 It should be reiterated that absolute certainty on the identification of the citadel sanctuary is currently impossible. The balance, however, does appear to tip slightly more in favor of Hera than of Athena.157 We cannot know whether it was a hypaethral sanc- tuary or whether there was some form of early cult building. Wace reported removing some "Geometric huts" from the citadel, though the examples of Eretria and Tegea demonstrate that there is no clear archi- tectural distinction between early temples and domiciles.158 Mycenae and the Heraion are linked by more, how- ever, than a shared cult to Hera. In the Late Bronze Age, a road ran south from the citadel of Mycenae, crossing the Khaos ravine by means of a viaduct in cyclopean masonry. It then skirted the eastern foot- 150 A.

Notable parallels for anakalypsis rep- resentations of Hera appear on the east frieze of the Par- thenon and on a metope of Temple E at Selinus. In the former (and probably latter) case, her appearance within the sculptural program bears little connection with the dedication of the temple itself. On the other hand, it seems increasingly apparent that the Mycenae relief is not sim- ply one of a series of metopes, and may instead belong to a dado frieze, in which case the theme may have had a greater iconographical significance. 156 Lisa French (pers. comm.).

Terrace wall of roadside shrine at Prosymna hills of the Argive Plain, arriving at the Heraion.159 The road was undoubtedly being used in the Late Geometric period, since two roadside shrines were established at this time close to its two termini. The first occupied a terrace approximately 700 m north- west of the Heraion (fig. 6). According to Blegen, who excavated it, the topsoil contained Classical and Hel- lenistic sherds, while a 20-cm deposit of burnt debris, black earth, and carbonized matter in the center of the terrace was found to contain fragments of bronze, iron, and ceramics. Deeper earth along the north- eastern and southwestern sides of the platform yielded a large number of votives, the overall char- acter of which was remarkably similar to the artifac- tual assemblage of the nearby Heraion.160 The earliest ceramic dedications seem to start in the Late Geometric, with Protocorinthian shapes par- ticularly well represented, though a simple arched fibula may be earlier.161 That the shrine was dedi- cated to Hera is virtually certain, due both to a ded- icatory graffito to the goddess on a black-glazed sherd, and to the appearance of the votives- terracotta seated goddesses, horsemen, horses, loomweights, wreaths, and bronze mesomphalic phialai (table 1).162 The second roadside shrine is the so-called "Aga- memnoneion,' close to the Mycenaean viaduct and about 1 km from the citadel at Mycenae. There are two phases of activity here. The first begins in the Late Geometric period, and is signaled by a large number of Late Geometric pedestal kraters, Proto- corinthian cups and kotylai, Archaic Argive kan- tharoi, Corinthian pyxides, alabastra, kotylai and oinochoai, and terracotta figurines of seated god- desses, horsemen, and horses. This phase comes to an end with the destruction of Mycenae in the mid- fifth century, and a second phase is initiated with the resettlement of Mycenae in the Hellenistic period. Inscribed dedications to Agamemnon are only attested for the second phase, but Cook163 ex- pressed his confidence in pushing back the identifica- 159 Blegen (supra n. 109) 428; Wright 192, n. 7; Antonac- cio 1987 (supra n. 112) 110, n. 91; Morgan and Whitelaw 85; Antonaccio 104; Antonaccio (supra n. 7) 68, n. 58.

HALL [AJA 99 tion to the earlier phase due to what he saw as the predominantly masculine tenor of the votives, par- ticularly the kraters, kantharoi, and the 20 fragmen- tary horses, which he postulated had become de- tached from their riders, thus giving an original ratio of about 50 female to 45 male figurines. Parallels are usually drawn between this shrine to the Homeric king of Mycenae, the Menelaion at Therapne near Sparta, the Odysseion in the Polis Cave on Ithaca, and the shrine to Phrontis at Sounion. In fact, not one of these supposed instances of cult to Homeric heroes can be sustained, at least with regard to the period of the earliest dedica- tions.164 The evidence of a cult to Phrontis in the Sanctuary of Athena at Sounion rests on nothing more substantial than a far from explicit passage of the Odyssey, and the archaeological evidence cited is not convincing.'65 In the Polis Cave, the earliest inscribed dedications are not to Odysseus (who is not the named recipient of cult until the Late Hel- lenistic period), but to Athena, Hera, and the nymphs.166 The case of the Menelaion is more problematic. Although Menelaos's name appears on a bronze aryballos, dated to 675-650 B.C., he is only mentioned in terms of his kinship to Helen and it is to her, not him, that the aryballos and a sixth-century harpax are dedicated.'67 Menelaos is not the named recipi- ent of dedications until a little later: either the early fifth century, when his name appears on a blue lime- stone stele, or possibly the sixth century, if that is the date of an unpublished graffito scratched on the rim of a bronze phiale.168 In any case, it is difficult to know whether the Helen and, later, Menelaos who received dedications are necessarily to be identified with the Homeric figures, or with more ancient La- conian deities; Herodotus (6.61) calls Helen a god- dess, with a shrine at Therapne, while Isokrates (10.63) notes that the two were worshipped not as heroes, but as gods. It is tempting to think that the "Mene- laion" was originally a shrine to the Laconian deity Helen (the sister of the Dioskouroi), with whom Menelaos gradually came to be associated, perhaps as a result of the spread of the Homeric epic, which imposed a more Panhellenic uniformity on essen- tially diverse local myths.169 If the phenomenon of Homeric hero cult is not as early as has often been maintained, then the ex- istence of a Late Geometric shrine to Agamemnon deserves to be challenged, especially since studies in the mythology of the Argolid suggest that Agamemnon's association with Mycenae may not pre- date the Homeric epic.170 A casual suggestion, made by Spyridon Marinatos, that the "Agamemnoneion" may be a shrine to Hera should not be dismissed out of hand.171 First, the assemblage of votives pro- 164 See generally A.M.

Schematic plan of the Heraion, ca. 400 B.C. vides no proof that they were dedicated to a male divinity. If the 20 fragmentary horses did not orig- inally carry riders (which is likely), then the incidence of female figurines outnumbers male ones by about 2:1, a ratio that broadly conforms to the normal pat- tern for Argolic sanctuaries of both gods and god- desses. Kraters may evoke the masculine ambience of the symposium, but are also found at the Heraion, the Sanctuary of Athena on the Larissa, Argos, and the Sanctuary of Hera at Tiryns; the same is true of kantharoi.172 In fact, the early votives are sugges- tive of a Hera cult (especially on the basis of the wreaths and horse figurines [table 1]) later remodeled as a hero cult to Agamemnon.173 Secondly, the "Aga- memnoneion" functions as the symmetrical doublet to Blegen's terrace shrine.174 Both are roadside shrines close to early and major sanctuaries (the cita- del sanctuary at Mycenae and the Heraion), one of which is suspected, and the other known, to have been dedicated to Hera. Up to now, no "Sacred Way" from Argos to the Heraion has been archaeologically identified for the late eighth century. The road from Mycenae to the Heraion, however, does seem to fulfill this function, and it is interesting in this connection to consider Strem's views about the pavement of the Old Temple Terrace at the Heraion (fig. 7). She argues that the function of the pavement, confined to the western and southern sides of the terrace, was to display the more monumental votive offerings, such as large bronze cauldrons.175 After crossing the Revma tou Kastrou, the Geometric road approached the Heraion from the northwest before following the contours just to the south of the temple to arrive at its eastern end: the display of costly votives on the south and west sides of the Old Temple terrace would thus be particularly visible to those taking this road. The cult of Hera was, then, from an early date a central part of the cultic system of the eastern Argive 172 See generally Morgan and Whitelaw 89. 173 Horse figurines are found in sanctuaries of Hera at the Heraion, Perachora, Samos, Tiryns, and Delos: E.

The sanc- tuaries at Agios Adrianos, Mycenae, Tiryns, Blegen's terrace, and the Heraion are all founded in places where Late Helladic activity is attested. At Mycenae, the original terrace used for Geometric activity ap- pears to have been oriented east-west on the mega- ron.176 At Tiryns, the building used for cult activity (whether purposely built or reused) occupied a cor- ner of the Bronze Age megaron, reusing some of its walls and column bases, and a Late Bronze Age well- altar was incorporated within a Late Geometric square limestone altar.177 Whether Hera had been worshipped in these areas during the Bronze Age is not easy to ascertain, though it seems highly prob- able. Certainly, the multiplicity of her functions in the Argive Plain, which involve agricultural and pas- toral fecundity, marriage, adolescent transitions, and war, as well as the annual renewal of her virginity, suggests a very different deity to the one that the Homeric epics consigned as consort to Zeus.78 Hera's early and essential importance on the east- ern side of the Plain is not, however, reflected in Argos.179 As yet, no archaeologically detected Hera sanctuaries have come to light at Argos, though there are two extremely likely candidates. The first is a three-chambered building (Building e), excavated by Vollgraff within the southern bastion wall on the Aspis hill.180 It is probably Archaic in date, to judge from associated ceramics and terracotta figurines of seated goddesses. Close by was a further deposit of Archaic material, including fragments of terra- cotta horses, wreaths, fruit, and small vases. Vollgraff attempted no identification, but the terracotta horses, 176 Stubbings (supra n. 144) 40. Conversely, the Archaic and Hellenistic temples were oriented north-south. 177 K.

Foundations of the Archaic temple to Athena Polias within the Frankish and Venetian fortifica- tions on the Larissa hill, Argos wreaths, and fruit suggest a Hera dedication (table 1). On his journey to the top of the Larissa acropolis, Pausanias mentions a sanctuary of Hera Akraia, which has normally been sought beneath the convent of Panagia tou Vrakhou, on the eastern flank of the Larissa. Nevertheless, Vollgraff was unable to find any traces of ancient remains in this area, and the fact that Pausanias (2.24.1) mentions this sanctuary in as- sociation with those of Apollo Pythaeus and Athena Oxyderkes suggests that it is to be found above them on the Aspis rather than on the Larissa (fig. 8). Vollgraffs three-chambered building is, then, reason- ably identified with the Sanctuary of Hera Akraia.181 The second candidate for a Hera cult at Argos came to light as a result of rescue excavations in southwest Argos, in a plot belonging to the Bonoris brothers (now in the courtyard of the Fifth Ephorate for Byzantine Antiquities). Beneath a Roman Im- perial house with mosaic floors was found a fifth- century poros edifice, which may be either an altar or a small shrine. The site was used in the Early and Middle Helladic as well as Geometric periods, though the earliest tangible evidence for cultic activity comes with the appearance of votives in the late seventh century, including kotylai, terracotta figurines of goddesses, clay spools, wreaths, and loomweights stamped with designs such as a naked warrior wear- ing a helmet, or a veiled woman's head.182 Any sus- picions aroused by the nature of the votives should be confirmed by a sherd inscribed HE[PAE EMI?]. The site lies to the southwest of the currently excavated part of the ancient agora, and matches Pausanias's description (2.22.1) of a sanctuary of Hera Antheia in, or close to, the agora. What is notable about these two possible Hera sanctuaries at Argos is that they are neither as old as the principal sanctuaries on the eastern side of the Plain, nor do they occupy a position of such cen- tral importance. Instead, the earliest archaeologically attested cult at Argos is that to Athena Polias on the summit of the Larissa. The temple foundations pre- served today within the Frankish and Venetian de- fenses date to the early sixth century (fig. 9), though the earliest votives date back to the Middle/Late Geo- metric transition, with a few Protogeometric sherds also attested.183 181 Vollgraff 1907 (supra n. 180) 160-61.

HALL [AJA 99 The most important (and reputedly earliest) cult at Argos was that of Apollo Lykeios, whose sanctu- ary was situated in the agora, in the southwest area.184 The sanctuary has not yet been discovered, though it is comparatively easy to hypothesize its location from three reference points. A late rebuild- ing of the Classical square hypostyle hall (on the west- ern side of the current archaeological site) was found to have reused fragments of a triglyph altar bearing a proxeny decree originally destined to be displayed in the Sanctuary of Apollo Lykeios; other blocks had evidently once carried inscriptions on bronze plaques, and this recalls Thucydides' testimony that the Sanctuary of Apollo Lykeios was the principal location for the display of public inscriptions.'85 The discovery, in the nearby Karmoiannis Plot, of a pillar that had once served as part of the enclosure of a sixth-century heroon to the Seven against Thebes cannot be dissociated from Pausanias's description of several monuments connected with the Seven in the vicinity of Apollo's sanctuary.186 Finally, a square Archaic building in a plot of land across Odos Gounari yielded two tortoise shells, one pierced to form the sounding board of a lyre, and is highly remi- niscent of Pausanias's description, within the Sanc- tuary of Apollo Lykeios, of a statue of Hermes with a tortoise that "the god has caught in order to make a lyre."''87 The obvious location for the Sanctuary of Apollo Lykeios should be within the triangle described by these three monuments, and it is almost without doubt beneath the present Karmoiannis Cafe at the entrance to the modern archaeological site. The im- portance of this, as yet invisible, sanctuary should not, however, be doubted, since it is the representa- tion of the Wolf Apollo that appears on all the early coins of Argos: Hera's head only appears for the first time on a coin struck in 421 B.C. to commemorate the alliance between Argos and Elis.188 The central- ity accorded, then, to the cult of Hera at the Heraion and the sanctuaries of the eastern Plain is not echoed in the city of Argos itself, and this observation can be strengthened by a closer examination of the archaeology of the Heraion itself. The Archaeology of the Heraion Str0m has argued for archaeological differences between the Heraion and Argos, noting that the monumentality of the building program at the Heraion, which begins shortly before 700 B.C., is not matched in the city of Argos itself until the begin- ning of the fifth century.'89 Moreover, while some bronzes found at the Heraion appear to originate from North Syria and Phrygia, there are no genuine North Syrian or Phrygian imports at Argos, whose only external relations seem to be represented by a small amount of Cypriot material.'90 Str0m wonders whether sanctuaries were themselves responsible for acquiring certain classes of objects for ritual, rather than votive, use, and whether the absence of such material from Argos excludes that city's involvement in the acquisition and transfer of the Near Eastern bronzes to the Heraion.'9' We cannot completely rule out the participation of certain Argives in the circulation of the Near Eastern bronzes, but we can say that there is no tradition, at Argos, of depositing in graves or local sanctuaries the types of objects dedicated at the Heraion. This apparent diversity in dedicatory behavior between Argos and the Heraion finds some parallels in the distribution of pins and fibulae found at both locations. The commonest type of bronze pin found in 184 Thuc. 5.47.11; schol. Eur. Or. 6. Paus. 2.19.3 says it was the oldest sanctuary in Argos, reputedly founded by Danaos. 185 Thuc. 5.47.11.

The ID is by far the most popular type of pin dedicated at the Heraion, accounting for slightly over a quarter of all Geometric and Archaic pins there.'93 It is also common in Geometric graves at Argos, where more than half of the pins deposited can be classified as 1D.194 There is not, however, a notable tendency to dedicate pins at sanctuaries within Ar- gos itself. Among the votive deposits of the Aspis and particularly the Larissa, only 14 published ex- amples are attested, and of these, as many as nine could belong to the Early Archaic as much as the Late Geometric period. More strikingly, there is not one single published example of the otherwise pop- ular ID type among the votive deposits of Argos.195 At Mycenae, by contrast, the ID appears in both graves and votive deposits.196 Fibulae are much less common than pins, but the majority of those that have been published from Argos fall under Blinkenberg's (Attic-Boiotian) class VIII, characterized by its large, square catchplate; indeed, it is quite likely that this "Boiotian" type was actually manufactured in Argos.197 The class VIII fibula also appears among the Heraion material, but it does not account for a large proportion - only ca. 5% of all identifiable fibulae. Instead, the most popular types at the Heraion are the class XII (Asia Minor) fibula, which accounts for about a third of the classifiable assemblage, and the Ring fibula, which accounts for just under a quarter.198 It is interesting to note that it is the class XII fibula that appears among the material from the citadel sanctuary at Mycenae.199 There is, then, evidence for different patterns of dedicatory behavior between Argos and the Heraion. It might be argued that the appearance of the 1D only among grave goods in the city of Argos but among votives at the Heraion represents the com- monly accepted shift of investment from cemeteries to sanctuaries toward the end of the eighth cen- tury.200 Nevertheless, this does not adequately ex- plain why Argives should choose to dedicate the 1D at the Heraion but not at contemporary sanctuaries closer to home, especially since there is evidence for the dedication of the ID at Mycenae. The possible similarity in dedicatory behavior at the Heraion and Mycenae is hardly surprising in light of the evidence presented earlier, and receives further support. It is hard to divorce cult activity at the Heraion 192 Kilian-Dirlmeier (supra n. 145) 93-94, 104; P.Jacobs- thal, Greek Pins and Their Connexions with Europe and Asia (Oxford 1956) 3; Foley 82; C. Rolley, "Argos, Corinthe, Athenes: identit6 culturelle et modes de d6veloppement," in Pi6rart 39. 193 The fragmentary nature of the material dictates that precise figures are difficult to arrive at, though there ap- pear to be slightly more than 1,200 Geometric and Archaic pins at the Heraion. If, however, one counts only Geomet- ric pins (excluding from analysis types that may begin in Late Geometric but persist well into the seventh century), the 1D accounts for 360 out of 503 instances, or 71.6%. Figures are based on Waldstein (supra n. 110); Blegen (supra n. 109); Caskey and Amandry (supra n. 86) 165-221; Kilian- Dirlmeier (supra n. 145). 194 Of 89 occurrences, the 1D accounts for 50. It is found in the following graves: Bakaloiannis Plot T90; Bonoris Plot T175; Makris Plot graves 2, 3, and 5; Museum Site T176; Panagos Plot grave 1; Papanikolaos Plot grave 1; Papapara- skevas Plot T263, T266; Phlessas Plot graves 3 and 5; South Cemetery T6, T16; Sportsground; Theodoropoulos Plot. 195 Types attested instead are XVIA, XVIIIB, and the multiple-headed (Mehrkopfnadeln) types A, C, and K: Kilian- Dirlmeier (supra n. 145) 141, 148, 165, 172, 196. While the Mehrkopfnadeln sequence begins in Late Geometric and per- sists well into the seventh century, the XVIA and XVIIIB should be broadly contemporary with the 1D: Kilian- Dirlmeier 145, 150, 298.

This shift in investment is often associ- ated with the rise of the polis and explained in terms of a greater emphasis on koinonia, or "community," which dic- tates that the communal, public space of a sanctuary be- comes a more appropriate locus of display than the pri- vate space of the grave. The opposition may, however, be a little overstated. Foley 96 points out that in the Argolid, the Late Geometric period sees a simultaneous increase in the numbers of metallic objects in both graves and sanc- tuaries. In seventh-century Attica, it is not strictly true to say that graves cease to be used for the display of "sym- bolic capital." Instead, there is a shift from an emphasis on grave goods deposited inside the tomb to more elab- orate monuments and rituals outside the tomb: see Whitley (supra n. 169) 217-18. Similarly, if any credence can be given to the testimony of Ps.-Dem. 43.62 and Plut. Solon 21.4-5 that Solon legislated against lavish funerals, it might be inferred that the seventh century witnessed a shift of emphasis from mortuary disposal to funerary ritual.</page><page sequence="32">608 JONATHAN M. HALL [AJA 99 from the practice of tomb cult at the Bronze Age chamber tombs in the immediate vicinity of Prosym- na, especially since bronze phialai, which are such an important diagnostic of Hera both at the Heraion and at other sanctuaries (table 1), are so prevalent among the offerings at the Prosymna tombs.201 Whitley has argued that the occurrence of Late Geo- metric tomb cult at Bronze Age tombs on the Deiras ridge at Argos and at Prosymna serves to emphasize the two poles of the "cultic axis" that Polignac has sought to establish between the city of Argos and its rural sanctuary.202 In Whitley's opinion, tomb cult at Mycenae arose as a slightly later reaction against Argive provocation.203 In fact, the archaeological evidence sketches a rather different picture. Certain characteristics are common to the artifactual assemblages of the Deiras, Prosymna, and Mycenae, for instance, the presence of oinochoai, kraters, and skyphoi, or terracotta figurines of seated goddesses and whorls. Yet, when it comes to metal artifacts, there is a much greater similarity between the types of artifacts deposited in the tombs at Prosymna and those recovered from Late Helladic tombs at Mycenae, particularly with regard to bronze pins, rings, and bowls. The Deiras tombs, conversely, are extremely poor in Geometric metal artifacts. Furthermore, Whitley's chronologi- cal framework, whereby Mycenaean cult was a later, reactive response to simultaneous tomb cults on the Deiras and at Prosymna, may need to be reversed. The earliest votives at chamber tombs on the Deiras do not predate the later phases of Late Geometric, whereas chamber tomb XXV at Prosymna may offer evidence for cult activity as early as MG II.204 Some Protogeometric fragments in chamber tomb 522 at Mycenae may be intrusive, but in light of the early date of cultic activity on the citadel at Mycenae, they may equally argue for earlier, rather than later, com- mencement of tomb cult there.205 The Heraion in Myth In describing the Argive sack of Mycenae in the 460s B.C., Diodorus Siculus claims that the reasons for the attack were twofold: Mycenae refused to be subservient to Argos, and continued to lay claims to the rites of Hera.206 Diodorus goes on to say that the people of Mycenae also believed that they should administer the Nemean Games, which at first sight appears so improbable that it might lead us to discount the whole report, not least because Diodorus was writing some four centuries after these particu- lar events. It is, however, almost certain that he is here, as elsewhere, following a fourth-century source- probably Ephoros - because after describing how the Argives sold the Mycenaeans into slavery, he states that the city of Mycenae was destroyed and "has remained uninhabited until my own day."207 This would be more true of the fourth century than the first century B.C., since Mycenae was reoccupied in the Hellenistic period. In fact, the supposed dispute about the adminis- tration of the Nemean Games may not be quite as ridiculous as it appears. These games were in the hands of Kleonai until some time in the mid-fifth century when they were transferred to Argive con- trol, but the foundation myths of the Games do sug- gest some competing claims. The foundation of the Nemean Games is variously attributed to three heroes: Amphiaraos, Adrastos, and Herakles.208 Amphiaraos and Adrastos are descended respectively from Melampous and Bias, two of the three co-ruling kings of Argos who originated from Central Greece and succeeded to the throne of Argos by marrying two daughters of Proitos.209 Both are also associated with the abortive attempt to march on Thebes in order to restore Polyneikes to the throne. The myth of the "Seven against Thebes" was central to Argive identity, and was frequently monumentalized within the city itself. The first-known monument is the pre- 201 For dedications in the Prosymna chamber tombs: Blegen (supra n. 113); C.W.

He became, of course, a Panhellenic hero from the Archaic period onward, but despite his birth in Thebes, the Iliad (19.121-24) makes it clear that, were it not for the duplicity of Hera, the Argolid, espe- cially Tiryns, would have been his by birthright, and the evidence connecting Herakles, Alkmene, and Amphitryon to the eastern half of the Argive Plain is so strong that the rootedness of Herakles in this location can hardly be doubted.21 His maternal great-grandfather, Perseus, was firmly associated with Mycenae, where he was the recipient of some sort of cult by at least the third quarter of the sixth cen- tury B.C.212 What is striking is the absence of monu- ments to Herakles in the town of Argos itself.213 The promotion, then, of the Perseid Herakles' claim as founder of the Nemean Games against the claims of the Proitid Adrastos and Amphiaraos may be a reflection of the dispute between Argos and Mycenae that Diodorus describes. In the case of the Nemean Games, Mycenae probably remained con- tent with rhetorical posturing, but with regard to the Heraion there does seem to be more likelihood that some element of truth lies behind Diodorus's statement, especially since Mycenae's role in the cult of Hera Argeia does survive in some other late sources. Strabo (8.6.10), talking about the geography of the Argive Plain in the mythical past, comments that the Heraion was a sanctuary common to both Argos and Mycenae, while Diktys of Crete (Belli Troiani 1.16) has Agamemnon of Mycenae sworn in as gen- eral of the Greek expedition at the Heraion. The most instructive example, however, is that of Io. The story of Io is found in its most developed form in Apollodoros, though it had already been re- counted in the Hesiodic Catalogue of Women and by Akousilaos.214 Io was the first priestess at the Heraion and the object of Zeus's seduction. In order to conceal her from Hera'sjealous persecution, Zeus turned her into a white cow, but Hera recognized the subterfuge and asked her husband to give her the heifer, whom she had bound to a tree under the surveillance of Argos Panoptes. When Argos was killed by Hermes, Hera sent a gadfly that drove the metamorphosed Io mad and, after a series of wander- ings, she eventually arrived in Egypt, where she as- sumed again her human shape. The episode had already become popular in vase painting by the third quarter of the sixth century, and in the fifth century Herodotus used a rationalized version of the tale, attributing Io's arrival in Egypt to her seizure by Phoenician pirates.215 lo stands at the junction of two genealogies: she heads one that is situated in Egypt and Libya, as well as closing another one that is rooted in the Argive Plain and is terminated with her transforma- tion into a cow and her flight to Egypt. West suggests that Io's Egyptian/Libyan stemma is one of the later stages of development of the Catalogue, and it is not unlikely that this particular eastern adventure was elaborated in the context of the Greek settlements at Naukratis and Cyrene in the second half of the seventh century.216 The Argive episode, on the other hand, should be older: although Homer does not directly recount the story of lo, his use of the epithet "Argeiphontes" (slayer of Argos) for Hermes (II1. 2.103) suggests strongly that the myth was known to him. Some versions of the myth have Io as the daughter of the river Inakhos and may more naturally suit the eastern genealogy that Io heads. The other vari- ants, however, have her as born of human parents. For Pausanias, Apollodoros, and the scholiast to Euripides' Orestes, her father is lasos, who is the son of either Argos or Triopas.217 Yet the earlier ac- 210 Paus. 2.20.4, 2.21.2, 2.23.2. 211 Hes.

HALL [AJA 99 counts of the Catalogue and Akousilaos name her father as Peiren/Peirasos.218 The absence of Iasos in these two earlier accounts would suggest that he has replaced Peirasos as the father of lo, but before ques- tioning the reasons for this substitution, it is nec- essary to determine when it took place. Pausanias (2.16.1) has lasos and Agenor as the two sons of Triopas, while the scholiast to Euripides has the twins Pelasgos and Iasos, together with Agenor and Xanthos, as the four sons of Triopas. The common source for both accounts must be the notice of Hel- lanikos of Lesbos discussed earlier, which makes Pelasgos, Iasos, and Agenor the three sons of Triopas.219 The evidence would suggest, then, that it was Hellanikos of Lesbos who first substituted Iasos for Peirasos as Io's father. The reason for the substitu- tion probably lies in the fact that Peirasos was closely associated with the eastern side of the Argive Plain, particularly Tiryns. Plutarch recounts that it was Peirasos who founded the cult of Hera at the Heraion, and Pausanias notes that an Archaic pearwood sta- tue of Hera that he saw in the Heraion had origi- nally been dedicated by Peirasos in the Sanctuary of Hera at Tiryns, but had been transferred to the Heraion after the Argive destruction of that city.220 The myths of Peirasos and lo, then, articulate the close association of the Heraion with the eastern side of the Plain and were still enjoying common currency at the onset of the fifth century when Akou- silaos was writing. Following the destruction of Ti- ryns and Mycenae, however, Io was wrenched from her Tirynthian ancestry and given an Argive father. The first writer to coin this new myth was Hellanikos of Lesbos, whose Catalogue of Priestesses of the Heraion was almost certainly commissioned according to Argive dictates. The Heraion in Epigraphy Among the many inscriptions to have come from the Heraion, a bronze plaque bearing a Sacral Law is of particular interest.221 It dates to ca. 575-550 B.C. and prescribes the penalties that are to ensue if anyone "violates the vows" of the Argive Plain, con- triving death or any other evil. A magistrate named a damiourgos is mentioned as being responsible for administering the law. Damiourgoi are also attested at Argos in a religious capacity, but at Argos they are nine in number.222 At the Heraion, on the other hand, provision is made for when there is no damiourgos at all, so the implication is that, at the administrative level, there is little connection be- tween the Heraion and the city of Argos. This bronze plaque also provides evidence of a completely different nature- the dialect used for official inscriptions at the Heraion. In earlier studies of the Greek dialects, Argolic was treated as an es- sentially homogeneous dialect spoken, with some minor variations, in all the cities of the Argive Plain and the eastern Argolid.223 More recent work in Greek dialectology has emphasized that the eastern and western Argolic dialects can be isolated from one another on the basis of a number of linguistic innovations.224 In fact, it would not be at all surpris- ing to find some minor dialectal differences even between cities within the Argive Plain and the east- ern Argolid. The task is not easy, mainly because the sample size of inscriptions is rarely large enough to permit firm generalizations, but within those limi- tations there does appear to be some evidence for dialectal variation between Argos and Mycenae. A linguistic process known as the "second com- pensatory lengthening" probably took place in the course of the ninth century B.C.225 This involved the simplification of certain intervocalic -ns- or termi- nal -ns clusters to a simple -s with a compensatory lengthening of the previous vowel. In the eastern Argolid, a long, closed j or 6 phoneme was used to represent the lengthened vowel: the preposition *ens became is (spelled E; in Archaic inscriptions, but Eig after the adoption of the Ionic alphabet ca. 400 B.C.), while the masculine plural accusative ending of the definite article *tons became ti.s (spelled To; in Archaic inscriptions, but Toug after 400 B.C.). The Argive Plain, on the other hand, seems to have ignored the second compensatory lengthening. Bar- tonek and FernAndez Alvarez have noted that west- ern Argolic, instead, either preserved the -ns-l-ns 218 Hes. fr. 124 MerkelbachlWest; Akousilaos FGrHist 2.26. 219 Hellanikos FGrHist 4.36. 220 Plut. fr. 10 Bernadakis; Paus. 2.17.5. 221 IG IV.506; SEG XI.302; C.

In all the Archaic inscriptions definitely assigned to Argos, the preservation of the cluster is found: so Xa%?o~agavq on a late seventh- century bronze aryballos, found at Sparta but in- scribed in the Argive alphabet, or Xpovo0o in the pre- viously mentioned Sacral Law from the Larissa.227 With one very dubious exception in the fifth century, this tendency continues through into at least the third century B.C.228 In the Argive Plain of the Archaic period, it is only Mycenae that forges a linguistic in- novation by simplifying the cluster: for instance, tapojivaglovaq in a fragment of a Sacral Law, dating to ca. 525 B.C. and incorporated into the Hellenistic Perseia Fountain House, or Xpoo[Oo] in a fragment of another law, found on the citadel of Mycenae and dated to 550-525 B.C.229 The evidence of the syrinx inscriptions reveals that Tiryns, like Argos, retained -ns- clusters. This need not, however, be very relevant. The retention of the cluster represents a linguistic archaism, and it is a fundamental principle of linguistics that archaisms assume far less significance than linguistic innova- tions.230 Moreover, it has already been noted that when it comes to letter forms, Tiryns displays a cer- tain amount of innovation compared with Argos. What is more illuminating is that the bronze plaque from the Heraion, with its use of rag &amp;paq instead of Tavq &amp;pavq, shares this particular linguistic in- novation with Mycenae. CONCLUSION: THE MID-FIFTH CENTURY The expansion of Argos and the destructions of Mycenae, Tiryns, and Midea in the 460s B.C. had a far-reaching effect. They were almost certainly the trigger for widescale institutional changes and a re- organization of the phratry system, and they should also be viewed as prompting the remodeling of the Heraion and its festivals. We know from Thucydides (4.133) that the seventh- century temple was burnt to the ground in 423 B.C., when the priestess of Hera, Khrysis, inadvertently allowed a lighted torch to ignite some garlands while she slept. The destruction can possibly be traced archaeologically by a burned level of charred wood and mudbrick on the Old Temple Terrace, and it is generally assumed that the building of the second temple on the terrace below was occasioned by this disaster (fig. 7).231 Amandry, however, has re- examined the architectural remains and concluded that the South Stoa, constructed on the terrace be- low the second temple, actually dates to the middle of the fifth century- earlier than was previously thought.232 This has important consequences for the dating of the second temple of Eupolemos, be- cause the back wall of the South Stoa acts as a re- taining wall for the terrace on which the second temple stands, while its associated steps provide a monumental access to that terrace, suggesting that there were already plans being drawn up in the middle of the fifth century to remodel the sanctu- ary, regardless of the conflagration in 423. Nevertheless, this remodeling extended beyond a mere architectural face-lift. From the Classical period through to the third century A.D., epigraph- ical testimony bears witness to the games of Hera Argeia. These were originally celebrated at the Heraion under the title of the Hekatombaia and then, from the end of the third century B.C., were transferred to the city of Argos under the name of the Heraia; in the Early Imperial period, the games were known by the name of Aspis, signifying the shield that was awarded as the prize. The games were part of the Panhellenic athletic "circuit": an athlete, honored at Delphi between 440 and 420 B.C., lays claim to three victories at the Hekatombaia, along with victories at the Olympic Games, the Pythian Games, the Isthmian Games, the Nemean Games, the Panathenaia, the Asklepieia, and the Lykaia.233 226 Bartonik (supra n. 224) 100-101; Fernindez Alvarez (supra n. 224) 51, 65. 227 For the bronze aryballos: IG VI., 231; SEG XI.678; Jeffery (supra n. 62) 168, no. 3. 228 The exception is actually an epitaph recorded in the AnthPal 13.14, and so need not preserve the exact form of the original. 229 Perseia law: IG IV.493; SEG XI.300; Jeffery (supra n. 62) 171, no. 1.

HALL [AJA 99 What is interesting is the date of the earliest prizes for these games. A bronze hydria, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and car- rying the inscription rtap' hpaq 'Apysiaq haf8,6Oov ("From the games of Hera Argeia"), should be dated to the decade 470-460. Another bronze hydria with a similar inscription, which was found in a tomb at Sinope and is now in the Ankara Museum, dates to the same period, while a third hydria in the Ny Carls- berg Glyptotek, Copenhagen, with an identical in- scription dates to the period 450-430.234 The sud- den appearance of these inscriptions from the 460s onward may imply a reorganization of the festival of Hera, and should be viewed in the same context as the earliest literary evidence that indisputably con- nects the Heraion with Argos: namely, Pindar's 10th Nemean Ode of 464 B.C. (supra). As part of the re- organization of both the sanctuary and the festival, it would not be too fanciful to suppose that the Argives commissioned Pindar to glorify the new cultic order. This is also undoubtedly the context in which Hellanikos's engineering of Argolic myths detached Io from the ancestry that served to connect her to the communities of the eastern Plain, and gave her instead an Argive father. Certainly, after the destruc- tion of Mycenae and Tiryns, Argos emphasized her control over the region by usurping her former neigh- bors' mythology. At some point in the fourth century B.C., the Argives made a dedication at Delphi to com- memorate the alliance forged with Epaminondas of Thebes to liberate the Messenians. The Monument of the Argives was an exedra-like structure that sup- ported statues of Danaos, Hypermestra, Lynkeus, Abas, Akrisios, Danae, Perseus, Alektryon, Alkmene, and Herakles.235 What is striking is the adoption of the Perseid heroes, Perseus and Herakles-more properly, as we have seen, associated with Mycenae and Tiryns, respectively- in contradistinction to the usual Argive emphasis on the Proitid dynasty. In- deed, it was statue groups of the Proitid heroes who marched against Thebes that faced the Monument of the Kings across the Sacred Way at Delphi.236 This usurpation of Mycenaean and Tirynthian myths is witnessed even more forcibly in the Roman Im- perial period, when Argos was accustomed to award to eminent notables "the honors of Herakles and Perseus.237 With the destruction of Mycenae, the sequence of votives at the "Agamemnoneion" comes to an abrupt halt.238 It may also be significant that al- though some cult activity lingers on at Blegen's ter- race shrine until the fourth century, there is a sharp decline in the number of votives in the course of the fifth century.239 One might draw the conclusion that the old "Sacred Way" between Mycenae and the Heraion went out of use. This is, however, the exact date at which a new "Sacred Way" leading from Argos to the Heraion may appear in the archaeological record. Recent excavations in a field close to the vil- lage of Khonikas (Neo Ireo), approximately 1 km west of the Heraion, have brought to light the re- mains of a monumental colonnaded poros building. The excavated part is 78 m long, and on architectural and ceramic grounds, it should date to the first half of the fifth century B.C.240 The excavator has won- dered whether it is to be connected with the "hippo- drome" known from a funerary inscription, though the inscription actually dates to the late sixth cen- tury; in any case, there is no need to suppose that the "hippodrome" was anything other than a large, open area on flat ground below the Heraion.241 The building is probably better viewed as part of the new program of monumentalization taking place at the Heraion, and almost certainly stood on the new "Sacred Way" that connected Argos with the Heraion, symbolizing Argos's newly won control over the sanc- tuary and her new-found domination over the Plain. In short, the simultaneous concurrence and rapidity of the many changes affecting the Heraion 234 Amandry (supra n. 92) 212-16. 235 E.

Paus. 10.10.3-4 states that these monuments were dedicated after the Battle of Oinoe, normally attributed to the mid- fifth century. Amandry (supra n. 92) 234, however, dates the monument to the third century B.C. 237 IG IV.606; Jameson (supra n. 139) 222. 238 Cook (supra n. 163) 34. 239 Blegen (supra n. 109) 412. On the other hand, the decline in numbers of votives in the fifth century is not uncommon throughout Greece. It is therefore difficult to know whether this observation is due to a local explana- tion or is part of a more common Panhellenic trend. 240 A. Onasaglou, "AvaQocaptKgq spyacisq.

The de- cade 470-460 marks a very real structural change, rather than the culmination of the practice of elite emulation and competition in which the basileis of Argos gradually asserted their preeminence at the expense of their Mycenaean and Tirynthian rivals. The combined evidence of literary accounts, myth- ological aitia, archaeology, and linguistics suggests that, from the time of its foundation until the 460s B.C., the Heraion was not the exclusive extra-urban sanctuary of Argos, but rather something approach- ing a confederate sanctuary for all the communities of the Argive Plain, particularly those of the eastern side of the Plain where Hera was accorded a greater veneration. The exact administration of the cult re- mains unclear, though the evidence suggests a very strong input from Mycenae, from where the earliest pompai on the occasion of the festival of Hera Argeia may have started out. It is only with the de- struction of the other communities of the Plain in the mid-fifth century that we may strictly call the Heraion 'Argive."
