<plain_text><page sequence="1">Irrationality and the Plurality of Philosophical Systems by Paul Ricoeur* Summary Beginning with the paradoxical fact of the plurality of philosophical systems, the irrational- ity of this situation is examined, first, from the point of view of two solutions - the Hegelian solution and that which dissolves the paradox by denying that systems are exclusive of one another - judged to be inadequate; and then from the viewpoint of the contrast between the claims of genuine philosophy and its actual historical practice. The idea of system is examined from the perspective of Spinoza's Ethics and, finally, M. Gueroult's idéalisme intégral serves as a guide in exploring the result of subordinating the historical features of philosophical activity to its systematic features. Résumé Partant du fait paradoxal de la pluralité des systèmes philosophiques, l'auteur examine l'irrationalité de cette situation d'abord du point de vue de deux solutions - celle de Hegel et celle qui résoud le paradoxe en niant que les systèmes s'excluent mutuellement - solutions qui sont jugées inadéquates; puis du point de vue du contraste entre la véritable philosophie et sa pratique historique effective. L'idée de système est examinée dans la perspective de l'éthique de Spinoza et, enfin, Y idéalisme intégral de M. Gueroult sert de guide pour explorer les conséquences d'une subordination des aspects historiques de l'activité philosophique à ses aspects systématiques. Zusammenfassung Angesichts der paradoxen Situation der Pluralität von philosophischen Systemen wird die Irrationalität dieser Situation untersucht: zunächst vom Gesichtspunkt zweier Lösungen - näm- lich der Lösung Hegels und derjenigen die darin besteht, die Unvereinbarkeit der Systeme zu leugnen -, die beide als inadäquat verworfen werden; dann von einem Standpunkt aus, der zwi- schen den Ansprüchen echter Philosophie und deren tatsächlicher historischer Praxis unterschei- det. Der Begriff des Systems wird aus der Perspektive von Spinozas Ethik untersucht und schliesslich wird M. Gueroults integraler Idealismus als Führer verwendet, um das Ergebnis einer Unterwerfung der historischen Züge philosophischer Tätigkeit unter ihre systematischen Züge zu durchleuchten. * 19, rue d'Antony, F-92290 Chatenay-Malabry. Dialéctica Vol. 39, N° 4 (1985)</page><page sequence="2">298 Paul Ricoeur Part I . The Problem The kind of irrationality linked to the plurality of philosophical systems does not result so much from the fact that each system is held as true to the exclusion of others, but from the fact that, unlike technological, economic, or scientific systems, past philosophies are never cancelled out, suppressed, abo- lished in spite of their obvious oppositions. The nature of this paradoxical fact requires specific scrutiny. Remarks: That, in order to raise a problem, some presuppositions should have to be assumed as facts seems unavoidable: no questions come from nowhere. This acknowledgement will be vindicated by the very de- velopment of the argument (see below III, 4, a, concerning the contin- gency of philosophical choices; this limiting condition applies, of course, reflexively to the present discourse). It is assumed, in this way, that the problem under consideration becomes most critical - and in this sense, paradigmatic - when philosophy is characterized by some form of systematic organization (III, 1, a). Section 1. There is no paradox for common sense, which sees in the con- tradiction between philosophical systems a symptom of the vanity of the philosophical endeavor. Remarks: That philosophy starts with a critique of common sense and prejudices is well-known since Socrates. This remark will appear less trivial once we have made explicit the operation of reduction (III, 1, b) which al- lows speculative discourse to posit itself as distinct from all other dis- courses, and first and foremost from that of common sense. Section 2. There is no paradox for those founders of philosophies (Descartes, Kant) who consider the history of previous philosophies as a mere history of errors. Remarks: This self-understanding of the founders of new philosophies is both ill- founded and understandable. On the one hand, the breaks with the past look less radical than the innovators may have thought, when considered after the passage of time (this has been shown, precisely, in the case of Descartes and of Kant by most historians of philosophy). This suggests that discontinuity constitutes only one aspect of the histor-</page><page sequence="3">Irrationality and the Plurality of Philosophical Systems 299 ical development of philosophical activity. On the other hand, the claim to break with the past seems to be linked to an important feature of this activity which will be characterized later as a thetic act (posi- tional act) (III, 2, a). The nature of such a concatenation of philo- sophical acts is a problem in itself. But it is assumed here as a fact that there is a concatenation of some kind. Section 3. There is a paradox for those historians of philosophy who consider their discipline as an intrinsic part of philosophy and for those phi- losophers for whom the history of philosophy is one of the necessary condi- tions of philosophical activity. For both of them the past of philosophy is never a passé dépassé . Such is the fact which will also serve as my starting point. The irrationality of this situation appears when a philosophical legi- timation is sought for this fact which appears to be constitutive of "the living experience of philosophy in the course of its history" (Martial Gueroult, La philosophie de l'histoire de la philosophie , Paris, 1982). The question is wheth- er this irrationality is only an initial one, and therefore an enigma which can be resolved, or whether it is a terminal one, and therefore an enduring paradox, which requires more than a speculative solution. But which kind of solution? Remarks: The basic fact which is held here to be the starting point of the entire discussion is the link between philosophical activity, ceaselessly resumed, and its history. Only philosophers may write a history of phi- losophy, and no one can be called a philosopher who does not insert his or her own endeavor into a history which preceded him or her and which will go on beyond him or her. The very existence of historians of philosophy who are themselves philosophers and of philosophers who continue to discuss Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Kant, Fichte, Hegel provides the alleged fact of this introduction with a plau- sibility which qualifies the arbitrariness of the chosen starting point. Now, it is this intrinsic connection between philosophy and its history which generates the paradox to which this essay is devoted, i.e. the fact that in philosophy nothing is ever acquired once and for all, but noth- ing is ever completely cancelled out. Part II. Inadequate Answers Two solutions deserve to be discussed. For the first one the problem is genuine, but admits of a speculative solution. For the second, the problem is improperly posed and should be formulated otherwise.</page><page sequence="4">300 Paul Ricoeur Section 1. The Hegelian solution is the most seductive: all systems are equally true as both historical and logical moments of an ultimate synthesis which at the same time abolishes and retains them in the return to itself of Absolute Spirit. a) The claims of the Hegelian solution are particularly strong: the history of philosophy is held from the start to be an intrinsic part of philosophy. No important philosophy is declared obsolete, each one is acknowledged as a coherent and self-consistent set, i.e. as a system. All the philosophies of the past are thought together in terms of their mutual relationships; their dif- ferences are made meaningful. Their succession is removed from the realm of contingence and raised to the level of necessary connection. b) But the experience of philosophy alive in its history is denied as radi- cally by Hegel as it is by those who hold only one philosophy to be true: what is preserved from successive philosophies is not their intricate inner articulation, but a prevailing idea which impoverishes the scope of their preciseness. The unilateral ideas to which past systems are reduced are not even acknowledged for their own sake, but for the sake of their opposition to and of their way of combining with others. Finally, the ultimate synthesis is thought in terms of a science and the Stufengang of systems is assimilated to scientific progress. In this way, the intelligibility of history is dissolved in an eternal present. The outcome of Hegel's attempt to legitimize the very existence of the history of philosophy is the destruction of the fact of the experience of philosophy alive in its own history, inasmuch as it makes unthinkable the emergence of new systems after Hegel. Section 2. An alternative solution would be to deny that systems are utterly exclusive of one another, because this mutual exclusion would make incom- prehensible their belonging to the very experience of the history of philo- sophy. a) Arguments close to those of D. Davidson in "On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme" would be in order here: philosophers, the argument would say, actually agree more often than they are prepared to admit about what may be called the "common real", even if they interpret it differently afterwards. Numerous identical terms keep recurring in these interpretations (being, thought, truth, etc.); opposing philosophers share many common issues (abstraction, the mind-body problem, freedom and necessity, etc.). Even solutions are never completely separate from one another but keep over- lapping, generating the partial agreements required for the identification of disagreements. The strength of this position is to take translatability as a</page><page sequence="5">Irrationality and the Plurality of Philosophical Systems 301 criterion for the acknowledgement of the differences themselves and to com- pel one to think of differences in connection with similarities and identities. b) But the argument is less convincing when philosophical systems are at stake. First, each system determines in a new way what stands for reality. Secondly, if the same terms return, it is thanks to the polysemy of the philo- sophical glossary, a polysemy which is reduced each time in a different way by the given system. Furthermore, if problems and issues look similar, it is by reason of their kinship with common sense and their imperfect reformulation in the terms of the philosophical system at stake. Finally, even partial agree- ments become misunderstandings when compared to the exactness of systems. Once more the experience of philosophy alive in the history of philosophy is betrayed, inasmuch as this experience takes into account the coherence and the self-consistency which generate the differences between systems. Part III . The Hermeneutics of Theoretical Practice The irrationality of this situation needs to be examined thoroughly in terms of the conditions of its possibility. It proceeds from the contrast be- tween the claims of every genuine philosophy and its actual historical status. Section 1 . The basic claims of philosophy are identical to its task : a) What a historian-philosopher holds to be philosophy has the structure of a systematic organization (even if, with Kant, we make the distinction be- tween system and systematic). Remarks : By distinguishing between system and systematic, I intend first to ac- knowledge the right to take more or less radical steps to achieve the task of systematizing philosophical discourse. For example, many Platonic dialogues remain aporetic and therefore fall short of the project of sys- tematicky asserted several times by Plato himself {Rep. VII. Letters VII, etc.). Furthermore, I want to reserve for subsequent discussion (Part III, section 2 - 4) the distinction between critical and speculative philosophy: the former is systematic in the sense that the presentation of the conditions of the possibility of objective knowledge generates an architectonic of Reason, i.e. a complete and completely articulated set of conditions. Before being able to deal with the paradoxes arising from this plurality of systematic modes of philosophizing, I have chosen to illustrate the claims and tasks linked to the idea of system on the basis of a single phi- losophy: Spinoza's Ethics , which I take as the paradigm of speculative</page><page sequence="6">302 Paul Ricoeur philosophy. The first fifteen propositions of Ethics I make explicit the verb involvere - to envelop, to implicate - applied to the whole of the internal relationships interconnecting speculative discourse. Definition III may be taken as the exponent of the rule of self-consistence of the logical operations achieved in Ethics I, according to which substantia is in se and perse . The unicity of substantia is attested to only by that of system that encompasses those operations; it is the whole set of defini- tions, axioms, and propositions - i.e. an articulated, continuous, indivisible discourse, unlimited from without and in this sense infinite - which states the adequation between the being and the meaningful- ness of the one substance. Proposition VII, according to which "it belongs (pertinet ) to the nature of substance to exist" simply develops (involvit) what was meant by Def /: "By causa sui I understand that the essence of which implies (involvit) existence; i.e. that the nature of which can only be conceived as existing". Taken out of its context, Prop. VII is mistakenly held to be a kind of ontological argument, a proof of God's existence pertaining to a rational theology. Brought back within the context of Ethics I as a whole, the term "existence" denotes no reference already constituted outside speculative discourse, no external "positing" (no Setzung , to use Kant's characterization of Existenz) added to a universe of essences, themselves already con- stituted as intelligible entities of their own. In this sense Prop. VII does not fall under Kant's refutation of the ontological argument: the terms essence, existence, as well as substance, are entirely redefined by the progression of the speculative discourse, in such a way that there is no room (nullus locus) for any distinction between essence and existence for that which is held to be substancia . The demonstration of Prop. VII merely achieves the semantic construction of the concept of substance in Ethics I. The "logic" of speculative discourse cancels out the semantic autonomy of the terms as well as that of the propositions themselves. (The Preface to the Phenomenology of Spirit by Hegel, speaking of the Selbstdarstellung - the self-exposition - of the system, provides the appropriate commentary to the "logical" status of what it calls speculative proposition ). b) Each system proceeds from the reduction of the direct referential claims of both scientific knowledge and ordinary language; this reduction implies that each philosophy defines anew that which stands for reality1. 1 Carnap1 s argument according to which philosophy is not first-order discourse does not deny it all meaning but further expands its power of generation and articulation within an autonomous logical space.</page><page sequence="7">Irrationality and the Plurality of Philosophical Systems 303 Remarks : The case of Spinoza's Ethics deserves to be considered once more. We have already alluded to the operation of reduction implied in the constitution of philosophical systems when we spoke of the reformula- tion of the terms "substance", "essence", and "existence" in and by the system. If, among other things, existence designates no reference already constituted outside speculative discourse, the ultimate condi- tion of this reformulation must be found in the reduction of the "gram- mar" of natural language, to the extent that it ascribes to existence an already taken-for-granted meaning, and furthermore, to the extent that its suggests (gives way to the grafting of) metaphysical hypostases, such as those that Kant denounces under the all-encompassing term of "transcendental illusion". In this regard the distinction that Carnap makes, in the Logical Syntax of Language , between material mode of speech , source of pseudo ob- jects-sentences, and formal mode of speech, may be held to be a good didactic introduction to the reduction achieved by speculative dis- course. But Carnap did not consider that a new kind of discourse - a speculative discourse - might be liberated as a result of his distinction between first-order and second-order discourse. This is why his distinc- tions have, for us, a purely didactic function, to the extent that specula- tive discourse, considered as second-order discourse, differs largely from any logical meta-language due to its self-constitution. Husserl's concept of reduction provides another didactic introduction, more appropriate to the kind of reduction achieved by speculative discourse, but still inadequate to that which is properly speculative in this dis- course. Let us take the measure of the radicality of the reduction applied to the "grammar" of natural languages and to the metaphysical entities grafted upon it and considered the products of first-order dis- course. Thus, in spite of its title - de Deo - the treatice on substance, on the one, necessarily existing, infinite, eternal substance, achieves the reduction of all theogonies, of all metaphysical theologies, as abusive extensions of a first-order discourse. According to a philosophical reading, which breaks with a mere history of ideas, where the discon- tinuity between discourses is overlooked, Spinoza's substance abo- lished all the substantialist fictions which claim to comply with the "grammar" of natural languages. One starts philosophizing when one loses the support of ordinary sentences and the safety provided by our acquaintance with the grammaticality of ordinary discourse, following Chomsky's linguistics. One must learn the language and the "gram-</page><page sequence="8">304 Paul Ricoeur mar" of philosophy, by producing them each time anew. Under this re- ductive condition, the speculative proposition constitutes its own proof within the framework of speculative discourse: verum is index sui et falsi . It is in this sense that Spinoza holds the discourse on substance to be self-contained: the index sui character of the discourse is adequate to the causa sui character of the substance. All the concepts produced by the discourse on substance should be interpreted according to the same rule of reduction. The concept of infinity reduces all external multiplicity (vs. the internal multiplicity of modes) and amounts to an innumerable, although completely defined, plurality. In the same way, eternity has nothing to do with endless time, not even with mathematical and logical timelessless. As for necessity, being no longer opposed to possibility and contingence within the same discourse, as in assertive discourse, it implies the reduction of all modal logic. (We shall return to this point when we discuss Spinoza's notion of mode). The most striking example of reduction is provided by the critique of finality in the Appendix to Ethics I. With anthropocentrism, it is the whole apparatus of the metaphysical discourse on God which collapses. Finality then appears as linked to possibility and time, which are reduced together in the discourse on necessity which is self-contained and without an outside. c) Each system becomes in this way a distinctive object of thought whose ambition is to express the greatest wealth of determinations (theoretical, practical, aesthetic, etc.) and to constitute a self-consistent whole. Remarks: For the third time, it is from Spinoza's Ethics I that I intend to borrow what seems to me to be paradigmatic for all speculative discourse. Prop. XVI-XXXVI display the productivity of a discourse which at the same time claims to be demonstrative. The verb exprimer e summarizes this new feature (as the verb involvere did for the self-implicating cha- racter of the demonstration). These propositions attest to the wealth of determinations implied by the one, infinite, eternal, necessary sub- stance in terms of modes . The choice of this term shows immediately the extent to which the infinitely varied productivity of what is in se and conceived per se is linked to the reduction of the perverse use of the "grammar" of natural languages in metaphysics. Since the relation of "expression" makes use of only one modality - necessity - necessity itself has lost its place in a paradigm of modalities derived from the</page><page sequence="9">Irrationality and the Plurality of Philosophical Systems 305 structure of natural languages. It should be noticed, by the way, that the relation of causality undergoes a parallel transformation connected to a similar reduction: for external causation, according to ordinary language and to Galilean science, a notion of immanent causality is substituted, which makes sense only within a second-order discourse of a speculative type. Correlatively, the systematic character of discourse, as described above, is stripped of its tautological overtone: involvere now means development, i.e. a formation of newness. Prop. VII, which declared the inclusion of existence within essence, is enriched thanks to the modal development, to the extent that necessary existence is the epitome of modal development. Efficiency completes systematic- ky. Two corollaries deserve to be underscored. First, freedom is redefined along with necessity; severed from all psychologism, the concept of freedom is equated with immanent causality (a synonym of the in se of substance) and with necessity understood (a synonym of the per se of what is conceived of substance). In summary, one can say: freedom is equivalent to causa sui . Secondly, the idea that only two attributes of substance are available to our discourse - space and thought - allows us to add and to integrate to the discourse on substance whatever can be conceived of on the level of modes with respect to space and thought, without transgressing the self-sufficiency of speculative dis- course. The scope of these two corollaries is of the foremost importance for the very concept of system: it appears as being both complete , according to its broad features, at the end of Ethics I (to the extent that the theory of modes incorporates everything which is and which is conceived in alio into the discourse of what is in se and perceived perse) and open to the developments of Ethics , Books II to V, which present in the fields of neighboring discourses - physics and noetics - the productive power of speculative discourse. These four books bear witness to the capacity of speculative discourse to reconstruct, step by step, the principles of those discourses that it has previously reduced, and to its capacity to redefine what, for it, stands for reality, noetic as well as physical. If the reduction of immediate reference in natural languages and in the empir- ical sciences was the condition for the autonomy of speculative dis- course, the power of "expression" belonging to this discourse is dis- closed by its capacity to transform the other discourses, including ethical and political discourse. This power of disclosure and trans- formation displayed by speculative discourse in the field of other dis-</page><page sequence="10">306 Paul Ricoeur courses is the equivalent of and the substitute for reference on the level of first-order discourse. It is due to this disclosive and transformative capacity that Spinoza's Treatise deserves its title: Ethics , crowned by the marvellous propositions about the amor intellectualis Dei that conclude Book V and the Ethics itself. Section 2. The contrast between the legitimate claim of philosophies and their actual historical status may be described in the following way: Remarks: What is at stake for thought under the three headings of thetic (posit- ing) act, of specific strategy , and of infinite in uno genere, is the sin- gularity of each philosophical system and, accordingly, the very pos- sibility of the plurality of philosophical systems. Before dealing in detail with each of these three themes, it is worthwhile to underline the topic of this section, i.e. the contrast between the legitimate claim of systematic philosophies, and their actual historical status. To bring this contrast to the level of thought, is to extract from it the antinomy that it seems to imply. The intrinsic connection between philosophy and the history of philosophy (something that we considered a fact in Part I) appears indeed as an antinomy to the extent that the three features which served to delineate the claim and the task of a speculative philo- sophy seem to exclude history. Conversely, as soon as one holds the history of philosophy to be but one aspect of a history of ideas, and the latter to be an aspect of the history of mentalities and ideologies - as non philosopher historians rightly do - the history of philosophy shares the fate of a history of events within the framework of a history of peoples and of civilizations. No bridge seems able to span the gulf between system and history. If, then, the problem itself remains, i.e. that which, following Martial Gueroult, we have called the living experience of philosophy in the course of its history, philosophical activity must be thought as an activ- ity capable of a history of its own, one that does not borrow its temporal features from the history of peoples and of civilizations, not even from the history of ideologies and mentalities. What is at stake in the three paragraphs of the present section is the notion of a history proper to speculative thought (or, to use Gueroulťs language, to "phi- losophizing thought" - pensée philosophante). a) Each philosophical whole is generated by a positing ( thetic ) act which makes the internal necessity of each system into an ex hypothesi necessity. This thetic act attests to the finitude of philosophical thought.</page><page sequence="11">Irrationality and the Plurality of Philosophical Systems 307 Remarks: The notion of thetic (or positing) act, which we put side-by-side with that of systematic articulation, is not extrinsic to the latter. The case of Spinoza's Ethics suffices to show this. When Spinoza writes: per sub- stantiam intelligo . . . par modum intelligo . . ., the use of the verb int ei- ligere in a finite tense and in the first person expresses the commitment of a philosophizing subject, the positing of an act of thought, homo- geneous to the implicative operations denoted by the verb involvere. Of course, the competence of the speaker who says intelligo is neither psychological nor cultural. The next part of Def. 3 manages to reduce the subjective character of the term intelligo by the hoc est which fol- lows: (per substantiam intelligo id, quod in se est, et per se concipitur: hoc est id, cujus conceptus non indiget conceptu alterius rei, a quo for- mari debeat). The weight of the definition is shifted from the verb intel- ligo to the substantive conceptus . Nevertheless, if speculative discourse belongs, on principle , to no particular psychological subject, such a dis- course constitutes a responsible act by reason of which this system is posited as an integral whole: this system and not some other one. The birth of a system has therefore to be considered as an event of thought, as a thought-event, which displays its own temporality, even though, by a second step, this temporality is absorbed within that of mentalities and ideologies, perhaps with the effect that it discloses some hidden features of the surrounding culture or even transforms it. (See above, Part III, section 1, c). This temporality, specific to a thought-event, relies on the idea of a beginning , of an inaugural gesture, thanks to which one philosophy dif- fers as to its origin from another. Examples? Plato's Socrates starts by defining virtues as moral essences akin to mathematical essences; his inaugural gesture, according to Aristotle, amounts to a "separation" of essences from empirical facts. Descartes begins by doubting and posits his cogito ergo sum as the first truth by a reflective act applied to doubt raised to its hyperbolical extreme. Kant starts with the question of the conditions of the possibility oía priori synthetic judgments. Hegel opens his Great Logic by positing Becoming as more concrete and more com- plete than the abstract ideas of Being and Not-Being, etc. From the fact that this or that system begins in a particular way and not otherwise, it results that the necessity which interconnects the whole development will be an ex hypothesi necessity, i.e. under the hypothesis of this beginning. This first determination of the singularity of philosophical systems does not at all enhance the genius, that is the idiosyncrasia of the indi-</page><page sequence="12">308 Paul Ricoeur vidual author of the system. Such an apology of individuality would re- main on the same empirical plane as the themes of evolution, or of progress, or of the education ( Bildung ) of the human species. The sin- gularity in question is that of the system itself, i.e. of its inner law, not that of its author. This will be confirmed by the next theme, that of dif- ferential strategy. b) The singularity of the initial thetic act expands to the systematic config- uration itself, which may be characterized in terms oí* specific strategy2 (with all the polemical connotations implied by this metaphor): thus, the order of reasons displayed by the Cartesian system starting from the first truth of the Cogito is one strategy; the generation of finite modes in Spinoza's Ethic as the necessary expression of the causa sui unique substance is another strategy; the production of a priori synthesis in Kant's Critique due to the mediation of productive imagination and its schematism is still another one; the Hegelian dialectic and the reciprocal mediation between Logic, Nature, and Spirit is itself a specific strategy among others, etc. Remarks: The notion of strategy will be interpreted later (III, 4, c) as concerns its polemical (and even bellicose) overtones. Only its role in the internal constitution of systems will be considered in this section. The notion of strategy provides a continuation, a duration for the thetic act, to the extent that the idea of a beginning is more closely related to that of an instant. The question, therefore, is not that of a psychological durée , i.e. of the measurable time required by the composition or the under- standing of a philosophical work, but that of the rule-governed trans- formations through which a stretch of thought is brought from its be- ginning to its end, thanks to the ordering of its inner multiplicities. In this way the strategy of a work aims at extending the power of the be- ginning to the work as a whole. I will add a few examples to those already given in the Summary. The first one concerns the role assigned to time as such by the strategy itself. As is well known, there is a deep affinity between the discontinuous order of intuitions and reasons that govern the Cartesian demonstra- tion, the theory of continuing creation ("création continuée: to preserve the world is to create it at each instant), and the discontinuity of time itself. With Spinoza, time is excluded by the power of instantaneous 2 G. Granger's concept of style would be an appropriate synonym to characterize the singu- lar nature of the solution provided by a singular work of thought in response to a singular histori- cal conjuncture, as it is itself grasped by a singular thinker.</page><page sequence="13">Irrationality and the Plurality of Philosophical Systems 309 integration possessed by all the demonstrations, a power that defines substance and the discourse on substance as eternal. Time comes back with Kant, but according to the "transcendental determinations" {Cri- tique A 138 ff . , B 177 ff .) which connect the properties of time with those of the Schemata (time-series, time-content, time-order, scope of time, ibid., A 145, B 184): in this way the mediation by the schemata is also a temporal mediation in every a priori synthesis. Hegel's system gives way to time in all natural, psychical, cultural, and absolute modes of Becom- ing, but the Aufliebung of all oppositions in the Begriff amounts to an absorption of time in the eternal present of absolute thought. This first series of examples shows that it would be wrong to oppose to one another the isolated declarations of philosophies concerning time, in order to expose their contradictions. It is only in terms of the global strategies that the, as it were, local discordances must be assessed. The differences affecting the fate of modalities follow the same rule; this fate is actually in accordance with that of time. The most spectacu- lar discrepancy is provided by the exclusive preference accorded necess- ity in Spinoza's Ethics and that accorded possibility in Kant's Critique. But the possible that Spinoza denies is not the one that Kant extols. It is the global difference of strategy between a speculative philosophy of an apodictic kind and a critical philosophy concerned with the limits of knowledge which governs the different treatments applied to modalities. With Spinoza the possible is reduced with the modal logic of natural languages; with Kant the modality of possibility is transformed by being tranferred from general or formal logic to transcendental logic. Once more it is inappropriate to oppose in a punctual way Spinoza's coronation of necessity and Kant's coronation of possibility. One of the most perplexing discrepancies concerns the fate of finality among philosophers. Descartes admits real but inscrutable "ends" presiding over the order of things, whereas Spinoza reduces every kind of finality as anthropomorphic. But this does not prevent Leibniz from speaking of possible worlds and of ascribing virtualities to his monads. With Kant, teleology returns under the aegis of reflecting judgment. This last example raises the question that will be discussed later (Part III, Sec- tion 4, c): i.e. how is it possible that one philosopher reduces or trans- forms a concept, an entity, a thesis, that another philosopher introduces or preserves? c) In this way each system is infinite in suo genere thanks to the singularity a) of its initial thetic act, b) of its further strategy.</page><page sequence="14">310 Paul Ricoeur Remarks : In order to complete the inquiry into the paradox of the historical sin- gularity of philosophical systems, let us consider once more the thesis that each system aims at expressing the greatest possible wealth of deter- minations (III, 1, c). With Spinoza, we have identified this criterion with that of immanent productivity or efficiency. This is true of all great philosophies, which are de omni re scibile , about everything knowable, but each in accordance with the unique perspective of its thetic act and of the strategy it selects to continue the positing act. This is why it is so tempting to make punctual comparisons between systems, concerning alleged "eternal problems", such as mind-body relationships, freedom and determinism, the place of man in the uni- verse, happiness and wisdom, and so on. What is overlooked here is that each philosophy determines, by reason of its immanent efficiency, its way of dealing with the basic problems raised by ordinary discourse and by physical and noetic sciences. In this way each philosophy de- termines its own horizon of completion and, accordingly, what it holds as really real ( ontos on , as Plato used to say). What we just called the horizon of completion of a philosophical system amounts to a way of ending, in the same sense as the idea of a thetic act amounted to a way of beginning, and the notion of strategy to a way of proceeding, of duration in a speculative sense. A philosophy is individualized by its way of projecting its own horizon of completion, which amounts to "the maxima synthesis of possible determinations" (Gueroult) of which this philosophy is capable. The kind of self-certainty that characterizes the way of ending is different each time. The amor intellectualis Dei , according to Spinoza, is not identical to the self-restraint practiced by Kant, even if we take into account the horizon of rational hope that his practical philosophy displays. And this rational hope itself differs greatly from the speculative wisdom which puts Hegel's absolute knowledge within the same family of thought as Spinoza's intellectual joy. It is this difference affecting the horizon of completion of the phi- losophical systems which allows us to say that each one is infinite in suo genere . Section 3. This contrast between the systematic features of the existing philo- sophies and the singular nature of the thetic act which generates them and of the strategy which develops their initial step would be overcome if the philo- sophy of the history of philosophy could comply with the following condi- tions (as stated by Gueroult):</page><page sequence="15">Irrationality and the Plurality of Philosophical Systems 311 Remarks: What is at stake in this section is what we have called, since the beginning of this essay, the intrinsic connection between philosophy and its history. The contrast which has been acknowledged between the theses of Part III, Section 1 and those of Part III, Section 2 would be overcome if this connection could become an object of thought within a speculative synthesis which would be at the same time the presupposi- tion and the outcome of a determined philosophy, a speculative philo- sophy of the history of philosophy. Every great historian of philosophy has a more or less explicit philosophy of the history of philosophy. That of Gueroult is not only utterly explicit, but is itself speculative. This is why we have chosen it as the best touchstone concerning the ra- tionality and the irrationality of the relation which obtains between phi- losophy and its history. At the end of this section we shall underscore the main advantages that Gueroulťs idéalisme intégral may claim in comparison with Hegel's philosophy of history. We may add once more: the utter respect of the inner complexity of each philosophy, a complexity that is never reduced to some dominant idea, which could be more or less easily in- tegrated within a system complying with the criteria considered in Part III, Section I and interpreted in a more dialectical way in Part III, Sec- tion 2 and 3. It is the constraint generated by this dialectical approach that makes still more exigent the conditions for overcoming the par- adox that the two previous sections have sharpened. The solution proposed by Gueroulťs idéalisme intégral may be characterized in broad terms as the subordination of the three historical features delin- eated in III, 2 to the systematic features delineated in III, 1 . a) If the thetic act could be released from its contingency, subjectivity, and temporality, and construed as an inner requirement of the system itself, in the way that the third genre of Knowledge, in Spinoza's Ethics Bk. V, is held to be eternal and at the same time "difficult" Ç arduus ). Remarks: We have already attempted to strip the thetic act of all psychologism, to sever it from any appeal to the genius and to the idiosyncratia of the au- thor of philosophical systems. Gueroulťs integral idealism wants to go farther. It intends to overcome the antithetical character of the polar- ity, system-act. The system is the thetic act. The thetic act is the system. The speaking subject who utters speculative discourse is not a historical subject who would receive his or her competence as a speaking subject</page><page sequence="16">312 Paul Ricoeur from belonging to the history of mentalities and ideologies, and more fundamentally, to the history of peoples and of civilizations. It is as though the system were able to think itself, thanks to a reflectivity derived from the very characteristics of the system, i.e. its being self- implicating and self-sufficient. The most striking example is that of the eternal character of the third kind of knowledge, the level on which Spinoza's discourse is situated as a result of its first definitions. This example is not an isolated one. Even the Cartesian Cogito - in the Meditations at least - , despite the fact that it is true only each time it is uttered, is supported by an intellectual intuition which transcends the particular history of the man René Descartes. The Ich denke of the Transcendental Deduction B is no one, i.e. not a first-person in quest of a second person, as is the case in the field of ethics. Finally, Fichte's Ich and Hegel's absolute spirit are not persons. It is the same kind of status that Gueroulťs thetic act claims, within a tradition that is finally more Fichtean than anything else. b) If the inner necessity of a given strategy could be raised to the level of a Platonic Idea . Remarks: The second implication of Gueroulťs idéalisme intégral makes room for a plurality of philosophical systems, by raising systems to the level of "intelligible objects", made eternal by the reflectivity of the thetic act that posits them. It is in this sense that Gueroult speaks readily of "philosophical reality" or "realities" (63). It is in this way, too, that the past is never a passé dépassé for a philosophical history. The succession of systems is cancelled out. A philosophical history such as this deserves to be called a "dianoématique" , to the extent that history is a reversible journey (dia) by way of intelligible objects (noemata). If the first condition evokes Fichte, the second one evokes Plato and his "polytheism" of Ideas. The third condition concerns the transfer of the term reality to philo- sophical systems, at the expense of the so-called "réel commun". c) If the various strategies of philosophy could be construed as different, non mutually exclusive, and compossible within one and the same divine understanding. Remarks: What makes philosophical systems not only different but mutually ex- clusive? It is, according to Gueroult, the illusion - as unavoidable, as transcendental illusion according to Kant - that systems, when com-</page><page sequence="17">Irrationality and the Plurality of Philosophical Systems 313 plete, are held to be copies of an Archetype ( Original) which would comprise all the determinations achieved by the system. Then, if some system is considered adequate to a previous reality, it has to be the only one true system. The major contribution of idéalisme intégral consists in the integral conversion of the idea of reality, once the illusion of adequation to an Original has been exposed. It has already been shown that speculative discourse is a second-order discourse which reduces the modal values of the first-order discourse. Idéalisme intégral radicalizes this reduction to the point of canceling all ties with the referential func- tion of first-order discourse. (By the way, the distinction between first- order and second-order discourse is foreign to Gueroult). The reality of philosophical systems implies nothing other than the idea of a "synthèse maxima des déterminations possibles" (o.e. 116), a notion we have already introduced. (Ill, 1, e). In order to equate the idea of the greatest possible wealth of determinations of which a system is capable with philosophical reality, one has only to add the conviction that everything that is external has become internal and that the whole is self-sufficient. The sense of reality is then nothing else than the self-cer- tainty which is the coronation of the self-sufficiency of the system, the intellectual feeling of completion, say, the intellectual bliss that one may enjoy when one reaches the last propositions of Ethics , Bk. V. One must therefore conclude that there are as many realities in things as there are in the different systems (Gueroult, o.e. 101). In this way integral idealism may claim to be the only system that leaves room for a further continuation of the history of philosophy. At the same time that it grounds the undebatable reality of systems, it puts an end to their conflict. The positive counterpart of exposing illusion is acknowledging an infinite system of compossibility, which may be equated with a divine understanding (Gueroult goes so far as to suggest that "the systems are . . . the unique possible ground for a proof of the existence of God . . ."). Here, we no longer think of Plato (read Sophist 253 d) but of the phi- losopher of the compossible possibilities, i.e. Leibniz (a Leibniz with- out the idea of the best of all possible worlds, an idea that would send us back to the initial aporia!)3. 3 Gueroult gives no reason why philosophers shift from the self-certainty of completion to the illusion that a complete system is the copy of an original architype. Are we faced here with a kind of philosophical hybris whose origin would be as inscrutable as that of evil according to Kant? By speaking of an unavoidable illusion, Gueroult seems to suggest that it is the inner con- straint seen in its result that induces the projection of the maxima synthesis of determinations in a transcendent model. We shall later offer an alternative interpretation of the " sentiment de réal- ité " linked to the fullness of the development of philosophical systems.</page><page sequence="18">314 Paul Ricoeur If these conditions were fulfilled, as in Gueroulťs "idéalisme intégral", a philosophy of the history of philosophy would be available, one that would do justice, better than Hegel does, to the history of philosophy, since it would impose no progressive order to the succession from one system to another; it would not take itself to be the synthesis that puts an end to history but would instead leave open the possible emergence of new systems in the future. Section 4ē Unfortunately, the finitude of understanding prevents the fulfil- ment of these three conditions Remarks: My objections to Gueroulťs philosophy of the history of philosophy are obviously influenced by the post-Heideggerian hermeneutical philo- sophy. Nevertheless, the profound respect with which the idéalisme intégral proposed by Gueroult is received and discussed complies with H.-G. Gadamer's self-characterization, when the author of Truth and Method starts the second part of his work with these words: "We, who are more concerned with Hegel than with Schleiermacher..." Post- Heideggerian? Maybe. Post-Hegelian? Certainly. Martial Gueroult himself compels us to go through Hegel, beyond Hegel, and . . . beyond Gueroult. a) The contingency of philosphical choices seems to remain irreducibly opaque (no one is able to give a perfectly transparent account of the thetic act by which he or she happens to be engaged along this or that philosophical road). Remarks: The first claim of idéalisme intégral to be questioned is the attempt to hold the thetic act which starts a philosophy to be a requirement inter- nal to the system itself. When we speak of the contingency and of the opacity of philosophical choices, we have, of course, in mind Kierke- gaard's rejection of Hegel's absolute knowledge, the marxist and post- marxist critique of ideologies, the teachings of psychoanalysis, and those of a sociology of knowledge. However, I should like to protest against the facile use of such heterogeneous arguments, which them- selves have their own complex presuppositions, as we learn from K.O. Apel and from J. Habermas, and which, assumed in a non critical way, are likely to damage any philosophy that wants to avoid the snares of historicism. A naive use of such arguments merely overlooks the problem raised by the reduction achieved by speculative thought as regards the "grammar" of natural languages in order to establish itself as a second-order discourse and to liberate itself from the metaphysical</page><page sequence="19">Irrationality and the Plurality of Philosophical Systems 315 hypothesis grafted upon this "grammar". It is in the heart of this reduction that the paradox ultimately resides. For my part, I hold to be legitimate the intention that animates the great philosophies, i.e. the attempt to free themselves from historical temporality. I even believe that every great philosophy succeeds partially in doing this. It is this partial achievement that makes a philosophy indivisible. But, as Mer- leau-Ponty used to say about Husserl's reduction, reduction is both necessary and impossible. Speculative discourse, as second-order dis- course, continues to borrow from first-order discourse and, above all, from the metaphysical hypostases grafted upon it. Reduction is always imperfect. This is why the singularity of the thetic act is an impure sin- gularity, I mean, a mixed one, blending the inner freedom linked to im- manent necessity and the constraint produced by external connections. The major symptom of this mixed singularity is the role of homonymy in philosophy. By this I mean the constraint consisting in the need to give the same names to the entities articulated by speculative discourse and those which this discourse reduces. Let us return once more to Spi- noza's Ethics. The preservation of the old substantialist and theological language is a source of endless equivocation. The same dis- course that reduces all rational theologies continues to call God the dis- course of the one substance, perhaps because the unicity of this dis- course itself deserves to be called by a proper name. But, then, how are we to prevent the proposition: "God exists necessarily" from becoming entangled in the theological disputes of the age, as confirmed by the accusation of atheism or of pantheism. The fate of modalities (necessary, contingent, possible, impossible) raises a similar problem: speculative discourse, we said earlier, breaks with the modal logic of assertive discourse but reuses any one of these reduced categories (see Spinoza, Leibniz, Kant . . ). It is as though the second-order discourse of speculative thought found words lacking. The consequence is that the singularity of a given philosophy depends on the kind of entities, modali- ties, and connections that it reinterprets, while canceling its previous use in ordinary discourse, in the sciences, or in opposing philosophies. b) The modality of necessity ex hypothesi of the strategy displayed by a system seems to be insuperable and seems to resist any transposition into an anhypothetical Idea (in the sense of Plato's Republic VI-VII). Remarks: As concerns the specific strategies displayed by the systems, another kind of mixture prevents them from being raised to the level of Platonic</page><page sequence="20">316 Paul Ricoeur Ideas. I am referring to the mixture between apodictic and rhetorical argumentation. The late Professor Perelman devoted an important part of his work to exposing the hidden rhetorical devices underlying the appearance of apodicticity. In a different manner, Gadamer's her- meneutical philosophy vindicates the phronetic rather than epistemic character of a large number of philosophical arguments, mainly - but not only - in ethical and political matters. As Aristotle's Metaphysics suggests, first principles cannot be proven; hence the recourse to an arbitration between the best received opinions. The relationship be- tween the properly speculative apodicticity and the geometrical appa- ratus of proof 0 more geometrico demonstrates) raises an even more dif- ficult problem. Because philosophical discourse is a discourse, it is ultimately addressed by someone to someone else; this allocutionary character entails strategies of persuasion inseparable from the demonstrative strategies of the system considered as a great monologue. c) The polemical stance of all philosophical systems, including that of the present philosophy of the history of philosophy (which denies scepticism, dogmatism, intuitionism, etc.) seems to be no less insuperable. Remarks: The polemical character which obscures the ideal of compossibility partly reflects, on the allocutionary (or dialogical) level, the opacity of the initial choices and the rhetorical component of philosophical argu- mentation. A final glance cast on the imperfect and incomplete state of reduction, which makes possible the autonomy of philosophical discourse, will help us to understand why the dialogical status of philosophical discus- sion always betrays its ideal of homología , Verständigung , mutual agreement. In every philosophy, the speculative discourse is in conflict not only with the "grammar" of natural languages but also with what appears to it in other philosophies as a concession to the metaphysical entities generated by the confusion between second- and first-order dis- course. In this way, for Spinoza, Descartes' definition of substance, which allows a plurality of substances, proceeds from an incomplete reduction of the substantialism received from Aristotle and the scho- lastics. If, as we said earlier, the difference between philosophical systems depends partly on the links that they keep with previous modes of thought, it is unavoidable that the entities that this or that philo- sophy preserves (while transforming them according to the inner law of</page><page sequence="21">Irrationality and the Plurality of Philosophical Systems 317 its development) look like survivors from another age, if not mere pre- judices and superstitions, from the point of view of some other philo- sophy. A symptom of this disquieting situation is the unbelievable injustice with which a new philosophy condemns the one that is, as it were, the closest to it in the conflictual process. Think of Aristotle's assessment of Plato, of Spinoza's way of dealing with Descartes, of Hegel's treatment of Kant and Fichte. What one philosophy reduces is what another preserves. This is why each philosophy claims to reduce what appears to it to be imperfectly reduced or wrongly preserved. Along with these reasons, directly derived from 4a and from 4b, there is another more specific reason for the polemical stance among philo- sophies, one that concerns the self-sufficiency of systematic thought. We saw what price Gueroult is prepared to pay for the sake of this self- sufficiency, i.e. the denial of any claim of adequation with respect to a reality held to be the "original" of which the system would be the exclusive copy. It is this transfer of the concept of reality to the system itself which defines the philosophy of the history of philosophy as " idéalisme intégral". It seems to me that the eclipse of the concept of truth as adequation leaves open several other options. No philosophy can claim to include the exterior in the interior. Even if speculative dis- course has no outside (extra Deum nulla substantia ), there are other discourses than speculative discourse. The ideal of including everything must be intertwined with a patient work of intersection , which connects the speculative discourse with discourses constituted outside of it. This is what all the great philosophies have actually done, in connection with logic, mathematics, physics, biology, psychology, sociology, etc. The consequence as concerns the ideas of reality and existence is important: philosophical discourse can as little deny the naive realism of natural language as astronomy can prevent us from seeing the sun rise and set. It is perhaps the referential function of ordinary language that pre- serves our undeniable " sentiment de réalité ". There is no need to imagine some adequation between the real according to philosophical discourse ("to synthèse maxima des déterminations possibles ") and what is held as real by all the other kinds of discourse (natural and artificial languages, ordinary and scientific discourses, etc.). The ques- tion is no longer that of an adequation between a model and a copy, but of a dynamism of disclosure and transformation displayed by the philo- sophical real and the common real. This intersection between a speculative discourse and the other dis- courses implies that our " sentiment de réalité " joins to the sense of</page><page sequence="22">318 Paul Ricoeur completion that each system generates by exhausting its power of deter- mination, a sense of incompletion, i.e. the wise recognition that no system can comply with the criterion of identity between the interior and the exterior, the criterion that Gueroult puts at the top of the conditions of possibility of the reality of systems4. This may be the main reason why philosophies remain in conflict, not only as regards their way of beginning (thetic act) and their way of continuing (strategies), but also in terms of their horizon of completion - and incompletion. The impossible claim of this " idéalisme intégral " lies in its pretence of being the only thought capable of exposing the illusion common to all philosophical systems, that of providing in an exclusive manner a true copy of an original prior and exterior to the determination of reality in and by each system and, in that way, to be the first system immune from any transcendental illusion. Remarks : The conclusion with which this fourth section ends is twofold. On the one hand the idea of compossibility remains as a regulative idea in all philosophical discussion. It is this idea which keeps the conflict be- tween systems on the level of discourse, i.e. which prevents this conflict from crossing over the borderline between discourse and violence. On the other hand, no speculative philosophy of the history of philosophy is able to overcome the contrast between the Idea of the compossibility between systems and the actuality of conflict. Hence our search for an answer pertaining to a pragmatics of philosophical discourse. See sec- tion 5. Section 5. " Que faire ?" (as Lenin would say!) I suggest that we return to our starting point, i.e. the experience of the his- torian-philosopher, and that we focus on the practical side of this experience. I mean on the very practice of speculative thought. This practical dimension finds an appropriate expression in the notion of an interest of reason, which is familiar to Kant's readers. This interest seems to be unavoidably broken into two pieces: a) On the one hand, I can assume in an imaginative and sympathetic way the thetic act and the strategy that generate a specific philosophy, without 4 "Cette identité de l'intérieur et de l'extérieur dans la pensée philosophante est donc la condition recherchée de l'auto-suffisance.

By doing this, I remain aware of my inability to make utterly transparent the motives underlying my affinities and dislikes. The most I can do is to fight against my biases and, thanks to this leap into a foreign (and often hostile) thought, to learn to defamiliarize myself, without ever being able to make my horizon of anticipation merge with that of the work under consideration. b) On the other hand, I can (and must) engage myself in a philosophical endeavor with the conviction of an assertive force, - and acknowledge the opacity of my choice, the hypothetical character of my strategy, and the irre- ducibly polemical condition of philosophical conversation. The practice of theoretical thought seems ultimately to rely on a split inter- est - an interest divided between the comprehension of other systems of thought and the assertion of one's own philosophical preferences. In this respect philosophy does not differ radically from art. The competent amateur may appreciate works of different, if not opposite, styles; the genuine creator can and must do only his or her own work. Because it is the same reason which is divided within itself, the history of philosophy remains a philosophical enterprise and philosophy has to be born out of the meditation of the great philosophers, i.e. the systematic thinkers. But, because this interest is a split interest, the irrationality of the plurality of philosophical systems is not only an initial enigma but an enduring paradox.
