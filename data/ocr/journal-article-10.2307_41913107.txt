<plain_text><page sequence="1">[1] 121 A RARE MEDITATIONAL SCULPTURE FROM TAMIL NADU* In the South Indian state of Tamil Nãdu, around the city of Thañjavur, there are a group of small temples belonging to the Nãyak period ( c . early XVII century)1. They are not very well known, mainly because of their scarce artistic relevance. However some of these temples house interesting sculptures, as in the case of Rãja Gopãlaswamy and Šivendra temples, located not very far from the city and both dedicated to the god Visnu. They are placed within the same sacred area, delimited by a massive rectangular wall. Access to the sacred area is, as usual, through a tall gopura. Rãja Gopãlaswamy temple consists of a man- dapa and a square vimãna preceded by a vestibule (&lt; antarãla ). A flat roof, sur- rounded by a double- eave moulding {kapota), covers most of the shrine except for the portion overhanging the vimãna , where the crowning superstructure ri- ses. Three diminishing tiers {tala) adorned by barrel-vaulted elements {sãlã) su- stain a dome-shaped stkhara topped by a pinnacle {stupì). The vimãna portion of the semi rectangular main body of the temple is cadenced with pilastered ni- ches - a typically Southern architectural feature- that once must have contained deities. At the rear of the Rãja Gopãlaswamy temple there is the Šivendra temple, consisting only of a rectangular hall, carved out from the rock. As I've said above, both temples house some interesting sculptures, nine in total, belonging to the Nãyak period. All the works reproduce the same iconography with slight variations, na- mely a standing male deity in grey-black stone (h. 1 m) set on a small pltha of various forms and size (figg. 1, 2, 3). In seven of these sculptures, the deity has * This article is taken from a research entitled "Šaiva Iconography in Tamil Nadu" which was car- ried out under the supervision of Prof. K.M.

A powerful branch of the Nãyaks ruled the Thañjavur and Madurai areas of what is today's Tamil Nãdu, cfr.

The right hand behind holds the cakra , the left hand behind holds the conch {saňkha). The god wears a tall kirïta-mukuta ending in a pinnacle and, on either side, there are three groups of upturned flames. His forehead is marked with the third eye. He wears round earrings, a flattened choker and the yajnopavïta which crosses the body from the left shoulder to the right hip. A transparent dhoti with a double belt girds the hips down to the feet. A variant of this standard iconography shows a difference in attributes: the forward hands are held respectively in abhaya-mudrã and in varada-mudrã , while each of the two hands behind bear lotus flower buds whose stalks pass between the god's outstretched fingers (fig. 4) Another sculpture represents an eight-armed god (fig. 5). The forward ri- ght and left hands hold respectively a lotus flower bud and a knife; the upper ri- ght hand behind and the corresponding left hand hold the cakra; both the mid- dle right hand behind and the corresponding left hand bear conches, while the lower right and left hands hold respectively a lotus flower bud and a knife. All the figures occupy a central position on a large stone yantrcč : a disc {cakra) with smooth surface and decorated border, displaying two interlocking triangles which form a six-pointed star, carved towards the centre of the disc. Where the points of this star-shaped polygon meet the border of the cakra , six groups of stylised flames project beyond the rim rather like fiery extensions of the points. This is an interesting depiction because, as Zimmer points out3, the cor- ners of evenly shaped figures of yantras have an important role since here ap- pear the sacred syllables {mantra), from which partial aspects of the divinity emerge, once those syllables are fixed upon in meditation4. The particular sculpture we consider here does not make the seed-sylla- bles ( bïjamantras ) visible but, as evidenced by the position of the six groups of flames, the divine essence is manifested precisely at the apex of the star-shaped polygon, in the form of flaming energy, as is also underlined by tongues of fire licking out from the god's kirïta-mukuta. 2 Hindu rites usually involve the use of stereotyped sacred formulas, either verbal {mantra) or vi- sual {mandala y y antra, cakra ). The different use of these symbols, the way they operate and their interac- tion have been the subject of many speculations. Regarding the ritual use of the sacred diagrams and the image of deities worshipped in them, see: Colas 1986: 83-95; Brunner 1986: 11,31. 3 Zimmer 1984: 67. 4 The sacred syllables or formula {mantra) constitutes the subde body of the deity as known to the ear and mind, whereas the visible and tangible image is the gross manifestation of the god for sight and touch. Cf. Zimmer 1968: 112.</page><page sequence="3">[3] A Rare Meditational Sculpture from Tamil Nadu 123 In all the iconographie variants the divinity's features don't reveal signifi- cant artistic achievement. The figure is stiff and the anatomic features are har- dly refined, nor are the iconographie elements detailed. The image reveal some of the characteristics of Nãyak sculpture: little attempt at individualization, nar- row smiling face, open eyes and protruding canine teeth. However, from an iconographie and symbolic point of view, the work merits further analysis. In fact, given the many characteristics typical of Visnu, the deity placed wi- thin the yantra can be identified with this god, although the co-presence of some of Šiva's attributes, such as the third eye, the yajnopavïta 5 and, especially, the bull Nandin (fig. 6), suggest that the divinity is a composite iconography that combines both Visnu and Šiva in an unusual iconographie syncretism de- parting from the canonical scheme. Actually, during the daily liturgy which is conducted in the garbhagrha of the Rãja Gopãlaswamy temple and which invol- ves services at specific times of the day, the brahmin officiant considers an ob- ject of cult the combined deity of Visnu and Šiva. In fact, two female divinities constantly appear on either side of the deity, even in the garbhagrha of the tem- ple, that would represent the female counterparts - or the šakti - of both Šiva and Visnu (figg. 7, 8). Really, during the Nãyak period in Tamil Nãdu, besides the large number and the variety of the iconographies displayed, it isn't unusual to find sculptu- res showing a peculiar iconographie syncretism, sometimes rather negligible, sometimes rather accentuated. There are, in fact, mürth exhibiting few ele- ments belonging to other iconographies - as the case of some LaksmI images wearing the tall Visnu tiara with the Unga of Šiva sculptured on it6 - or more complex representations, where the attributes and the iconographie elements belonging to different deities, coexist in such a way and manner as to constitute a veritable composite deity. This is the case of the Visnu/Šiva image in question or the four-handed Krsna/Visnu image holding the flute, the conch and the ca- kra (fig. 9). These syncretistic iconographies departing from the canonical schemes would seem to belong to a peculiar artistic trend, connected to a complex reli- gious and cultural context, which is not yet very well known and therefore de- serves to be further explored. Turning now to the sculpture in question, certainly it represents a combi- nation of Šiva and Visnu cults as expressing harmonizing tendencies between these two religious paths, but in certain iconographie elements, it seems to im- ply a further syncretism, which would extend its iconologica! meaning. 5 The yajñoravita, Siva's peculiar attribute, is however worn by several deities. 6 Two of these Lakçmï images, are located respectively in the Rãja Gopãlaswamy temple (Thañ- javur district) and in the Parvata Girišvara temple (Kunnandur Koil taluk).</page><page sequence="4">124 Tiziana Lorenzetti [4] First of all, the yantra on which the deity is sculptured consists of an up- ward pointing triangle interlocked with a downward pointing one to form a star-shaped hexagon encircled by the cakra, representing the energy vortex which delimits the whole universe. The triangle is the primal symbol of cosmic location; since space cannot be bounded by less than three lines, the triangle is conceived as a crystallization of the expansive rhythm of the cosmos, the first symbolic form which emerges from the chaos preceding a new life process7. In the symbology of the y an tras, the upward pointing triangle represents the male principle, while the down- ward pointing one is the emblem of the creative matrix of the cosmos, the pre- serving female principle (Kãmakalãvilasa Tantra w. 22, 24)8. Their interpéné- tration symbolizes the fusion of polarities, male and female, Šiva and Šakti ( Ka - íikã V urãna I, 66, 60-6 1)9, expressing at the same time the perfect state of unity and the cosmic development. "The two seed-point white and red are Šiva and Šakti who, in their secret mutual enjoyment, are now closing together, now opening out in manifestation. They are the cause of word ( vãk ) and meaning (&lt; artha ), now penetrating, now separating from one another "{Kãmakalãvilasa Tantra v. 6). Most Indian divinities such as Visnu, Krsna, Sürya, Durgã and Kâlï, have their own yantra , which is accompanied by the mantra belonging to each parti- cular manifestation. The subtle correspondence among the divinity, the mantra and the yantra, is also underlined in the Kulãrnava Tantra, on which that is written: y antram mantramayam proktam devatä mantrarüpim / "it is said that the yantra consists of mantra. The deity's nature is mantra " (Kulãr- nava Tantra VI, 85). And moreover: sarïram iva jïvasya dïpasya snehavat priye/ sarvesãm api devãnãm tathã y antram pratisthitam II "as the body is for the living being, as the oil is for the lamp, so the yantra is for all deities" (. Kulãrnava Tantra VI, 87). Given this correspondence, the image of the deity may be depicted in the centre of the symbolic diagram as an aniconic symbol or, as in the case under consideration, as an anthropomorphic image. 7 Cf. Madhu Khanna 1994: 32. 8 The inverted triangle of the yantra is the central nucleus of most yantras devoted to the goddes- ses and is the emblem of the great goddess Kail (Cf. Madhu Khanna 1994: 32). 9 Cf. Woodroffe 1951: 419, 424, 425; Danielou 1964: 353, 354.</page><page sequence="5">[5] A Rare Meditational Sculpture from Tamil Nadu 125 According to some scholars10 the combination of y antra and deity image represents a dynamic structure, which expresses both the cosmic emanation and its opposite movement that of reabsorption, which the adept follows using the ritual diagram. Whether or not the image of the divinity is shown, the centre of the god Visnu's yantras displays two interlocking triangles, one upright, the other inver- ted, (figg. 10, 11) which, as we noted above, symbolise of the static male and the kinetic female (or sakti ), both of which Visnu includes. Indeed, especially this particular divinity shows an ambivalent sexual na- ture, emphasised in the yantras dedicated to him by the presence of the two in- terlocking triangles, but also by the presence of the double lotus flower to sym- bolise the god's unfolding creative power, or his sakti11 , often depicted with pe- tals pointing towards the border of the diagram. In fact, in the figure of Visnu, the god and his female counterpart emerge in turns, alternating major roles, as is also clearly evidenced in certain puranic myths, where Visnu takes on the ap- pearance of a woman, (e.g. Kürma Purãna I, 15, 120-123; ibidem II, 37, 1-162). Visnu's inherent bisexuality isn't foreign to other divine figures. A very com- mon element in hindu mythology is, in fact, sex-reversal of some gods and god- desses in terms of a sequence or a cycle of alternating sexual roles (e.g. Mbh. I, 70, 20; ibidem III, 126, 5-29)12, which has developed into sexually ambivalent icons. Nevertheless, the image of Visnu cannot be considered merely ambiva- lent, as is the case with other divinities. Indeed, we find myriad meanings con- verging within it, thus also associating this god's image with the creative power par excellence , the Cosmic Mother, the sakti of Šiva. This idea pervades Indian mythologizing to the extent that many myths, especially in the Tamil culture, invoke Visnu as the female half of Šiva (e.g. Kantapurãnam VI, 20, 135; ibidem II, 32, 27 -40) 13 , or tell how the seed of the Great God was deposited in the womb of Visnu (e.g. Linga Purãna II, 54, 24-26), often associated with the inexhaustible womb of the world (e.g. Kürma Purãna II, 37, 9-11). In the Tamil tradition, in fact, the upper part of the pedestal (&lt; avadeyar ) which supports the linga 10 COLAS 1986: 87-91; Chenet 1986: 7. 11 In Indian symbolism, the lotus flower is one of the principal archetypal symbol of the creative female principle. The whole of creation has its beginnings in the primal lotus, which feeds and supports it. Just as the primeval waters are the origin of all things, so the lotus is symbolic of these waters and re- garded as their female generative organ. (Cf. Bosh 1994: 119-124; Zimmer 1990: 90-102). At a deep level, the lotus is a symbol of the citaded of the heart, the seat of the Self, which is revealedin meditation. {Chan dogy a Upani$ad VIII, 1, 1-3). 12 Cf. Shulman 1980: 294-316. 13 Cf. Shulman 1980: 309.</page><page sequence="6">126 Tiziana Lorenzetti [6] and which is emblem of the yoni, is supposed to represent the god Visnu14. Indeed, in virtue of Visnu's role as cosmic preserver and his connection with the primeval waters from which the different phenomena and elements of the Universe arise, the god can be associated with the Mother-Goddess, even in terms of y antra symbology15. Just as Visnu bears the cosmos within, like unborn new life and preserves and supports existence, so the universal female principle produces and sustains life. Actually, the creative female principle, identified in the goddess of lotus Padmâ-Laksmï, is nothing more than a transformation of a part of the substance eternally contained within the god's cosmic body16. In the DevJ-mãhãtmya , in fact, the Goddess, the "mother of the whole world "is equa- ted with the Visnu's energy, his illusive power. (. Mãrkandeya Purãna XCI, 2,4; XCIII, 2). To take up again to the sculptural work from Rãja Gopãlaswamy temple, both the gods Šiva and Visnu, seamlessy fused in one composite image, appear on the two interpenetrating triangles of the yantra . Moreover, in the deity's hand we see the lotus flower, symbol of feminine fertility, which underlines a female presence. All this seems to express on the one hand a combination of Šiva and Visnu cults while, on the other hand, considering Visnu's female property, it manife- sts the eternal embrace of cosmic opposites male/female, where the male prin- ciple can be identified, as usual, with god Šiva, the female one with Visnu. Thus the female property of Visnu appears to be manifested in this iconography in the primary role as Cosmic Mother and, actually, in Tamil myths the connec- tion between sex-reversal and motherhood is well known17. To sum up, the sculptural art of the Rãja Gopãlaswamy and Šivendra tem- ples, combining in a peculiar way Šiva and Visnu iconographies, reveals an unusual iconographie syncretism that would seem to belong to an artistic trend, not yet well explored, current in Tamil Nãdu during the Nãyak period. But the composite image, sculptured on the centre of the two interlocking triangles of the yantra, also expresses a complex visual and symbolic synthesis pregnant with manifold meanings. It manifests the play of Šiva / Šakti-V isnu polarities revealing twofold sym- bolic significance deriving, in the first place, from Visnu's sexual ambivalence. On one hand, in fact, there emerges a combination of Šiva and Visnu cults, on the other - considering Visnu's female property - a visualisation and intimate 14 Cfr.

Moreover, the presence of the female principle manifested - as we have seen - by Visnu's female part, would seem to imply connections with Šakta cults. We have to consider, in fact, that the cult of the female principle is parti- cularly widespread in Tamil culture18, as confirmed by the erection of indepen- dent sanctuaries dedicated to the feminine form of the deity, as well as by the presence of minor temples dedicated to the Goddess, constantly set beside the main shrine, as from the XI century19. It is also interesting to note that in Šaktism the use of the y antra takes on a significant role, and its introduction in Šaiva ritual might, as some authors sug- gest20, be attributable to the amalgam of these two cults, particularly frequent in Southern India. The combination of linear yantra and sacred image, revealing a two-fold formal language - the immediate, concrete language of the anthropomorphic forms and the more recondite, abstract language of geometric symbolism - make this sculptural work an effective aid in meditation or visionary experience of the divine. This rare sculpture, therefore, in its iconographie syncretism, conveys a greater richness of meaning referring to a whole religious, ritual and cultural context, that should be better investigated.

However, the Pârvatï' s devotional figure saw the gradual convergence of characte- ristics belonging to the autochthonous divinities, protectors of the villages (, grãmadevatã ), so that in Tamil territory the bride of Siva receives and absorbs ancient heritages and ancestral cults and becomes also, and indeed predominantly, Amman , the Mother. Eventually she became the object of such fervent popular de- votion as at times to overshadow her consort, whose image dominated the main temple structure. (Cf.
