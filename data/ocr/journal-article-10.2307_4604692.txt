This is an attractive little book charmingly put together by an inter- esting storyteller.

She thinks of animals parading along the beach, or rather of the people who are listening to the story walking along the shore and seeing what the animals are doing in their regular duties. The parade begins with the plankton, goes on to sponges, jelly fishes, star fishes, worms, clams, snails and other mollusca, crustacea, tunicates, and there are many lively little incidents told which make it quite a fascinating trip. There is a table of contents, but no index. The book attracted the reviewer, but he is sorry that the writer found it necessary to endow all of the sea creatures with an anthropomorphic point of view. Hardly a page fails to show some human interpretation which would not stand up under criticism. "As the tide goes out the jelly fish move out to sea with it. They are not going to take any chances on being stranded on the shore without water to drink." "This is a trick the anemone plays on his enemies so that they will not admire his beauty and eat him up." There are many who would not care to impress children with such an extremely teleological way of looking at animals. The book is in- terestingly done but not at all critically written. A.
