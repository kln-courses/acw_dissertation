Press cuttings and comments cover 1.6.89 to 31.5.90 but coverage of Greek periodicals (except Ergon 1989) had to be stopped before the Easter rush. I have been sadly disorganized in arranging the necessary work for this last eight months and as well have had much to relearn about sites which I have not visited for 20 years. With my own difficulties in mind, I illustrate this issue of AR with a plan of the 'nomes' of Greece and lists of the Archaeological Epho- rates based on them. I also include some site plans (or references to them) which have appeared and which I feel may prove of use to the reader and to the visiting student. I gratefully acknowledge the help of members of the BSA staff and students who have worked on sections of this report for me, Penny Wilson-Zarganis, Nigel Spencer, and particular- ly Iphigeneia Touravitou and David Turner. All howlers must, however, be blamed on me. My thanks above all to Theo Koukoulis who lent me his personal copy of the ADelt without which the report could not have been compiled. The patience of the Editor, Dr Lyn Rodley, has been, as always, magnifi- cent; it is to be hoped I shall not try it so badly in future. Photographic illustration is perhaps low, but the competing timetable of the Chronique des Fouilles published in the BCH means that the cream (in fact every illustration that I had chosen to use!) has already been used elsewhere; the illustra- tions here therefore come directly from the excavators. ADelt 36 Chr deals with rescue work in 1981 and this is included in considerable detail where it concerns finds that will not be reported elsewhere; other items are noted. The reports in this issue are clouded by the severe earthquakes of the winter of 1981. PAE for 1984 has appeared and other good reports of area work are included in local publications (e.g. Kretiki Estia, Lesbiaka, et al.) and concern more recent years. Press reports have been included, but the warning as to their frequent inaccuracy must be repeated; they are signposts to finds, little more, except for the rare longer articles by con- scientious reporters. Unfortunately no further issue of AEMTH has reached our library though press reports of the Institute of Balkan Studies conference in October have contained much interesting and up-to-date material. The proportion of news interest devoted to the North continues and the importance of this area in the overall archaeological scene cannot be overemphasized. We may note the appearance of a new French series called Etudes Franco-Helleniques of which the first issue was devoted to the publication of the conference held in memory of Demetrios Lazarides, the long serving Ephor at Kabala who was later Director of Antiquities. The Arkaiolog- ike Ephemeris for 1987 has appeared, a volume devoted to the celebration of the 150 years of the Archaeological Society. It is a splendid issue and we offer, once again, all congratulations on their age and achievements. The following Greek periodicals which reached the BSA Library between 1/6/89 and 28/2/90 have been extracted for this issue: Anthropos 8 (1981), 9 (1982), 11 (1984-86); Archaiologia 31, 32, 33, 1989; Archaiologike Ephemeris 1987; Archaiologikon Deltion 36 Chronika B.1, B.2, 1981; Archeion Euboikon Meleton KZ', 1986-7; Enalia 1, B', October 1989; Kritiki Estia 2, 1988; Lesbiaka IB', 1989; Makedonika 26, 1987-8; Parousia A', 1982; Praktika tes en Athenais Archaiologikes Etaireias 1984; Trikalina 9, 1989. No attempt has been made to incorporate material published in Horos 6, 1988, which should be consulted by all epigraphers. Among issues noted widely in the press, there is much concern for the preservation and restoration of the Acropolis, particularly the Parthenon. The Museum at the Makrigianni hospital displays the background material to this on-going debate and both the project and those concerned with it have won international acclaim during the year, notably the Leonardo da Vinci prize. Also of concern has been the damage to ancient theatres caused by moder usage. Conservation has become a major issue and it is reassuring to see the notices of 'listing' and the emergence of care for buildings of all periods. The interest in traditional crafts and practices is also growing, as is the corpus of literature concerning this side of Greek history. Other fields of interest include: Two articles on Women's Studies in Parousia I, 1982, one by K. Mentzou-Meimari on 'Women in Greek Inscriptions' and one by S. Lambropoulou on 'The Condition of Women in Ancient Greece'. An interest- ing and, as always, well illustrated issue of Archaiologia (32) deals with the Trireme and other nautical matters. Museums. Two extensions are underway in Athens, to the Byzantine Museum and to the Benaki, the latter a massive scheme which will more than double the storage and exhibition space without destroying the appearance from the street (objections from neighbours have recently arisen). The other important programme is roofing and a museum at Bergina (about which there has been much press comment). The newspapers report plans for renovation at Delphi, the unique character of the museum at the Aphaia Sanctuary on Aigina, the opening of the Byzantine Museum in Kastoria with a notable collection of icons as well as frescoes and wooden sculpture, and the restoration of the Refectory at Osios Loukas to house frescoes and architectural carvings (though not yet in action in June 1990). The break-in to the Corinth Museum in the early hours of Easter Thursday, which was in fact only the last and most immediate of a series of Museum robberies, has brought home to all the vulnerability of the antiquities of Greece. Measures to reinforce guards and take additional precautions are current- ly under study, and there has been much press discussion of the problems of guarding antiquities, both on site and in Museums. Exhibitions. Two major exhibitions have been mounted using material from Greek Museums: Mind and Body which started at the National Museum and has since moved on to Lausanne, and Eros Grec in Paris. The catalogues of both are academic works in their own right and accompanied by superb illustrations. Conference topics have included the Centenary of Schlie- mann's death, Ancient Macedonia, the Drama plain, Thessaly, Argos, Bronze Age Trade, et al.; the Third Thera conference took place in September 1989. Deaths. We report with sadness the death of two venerable figures of foreign archaeology in Greece: Eugene Vanderpool of the ASCS and Lord William Taylour of the BSA.

ATHENS AND ATTICA Athens. The 3rd Ephorate reports the heavy earthquake damage of 1981 particularly to buildings housing local archaeological collections (ADelt 36 Chr 8-40). Earthquakes damage also placed an immense burden on the staff of the 1st</page><page sequence="4">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 5 Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities. The extent of damage was assessed and recorded while initial measures were taken to protect the monuments. The old mansion which serves as the Ephorate's headquarters at Polygnotou 2 suffered cracks to the masonry; consequently stabilization work was undertaken on the building. The Restoration Service of the Ministry of Culture helped in this work (ADelt 36 Chr 76). National Museum. The ADelt 36 Chr P1. 1 gives a vivid picture of the damage to some of the 500 vases which suffered in the earthquake of February 24, 1981. Acropolis. The effect of the earthquake of 1981 on the Parthenon and the Theatre of Dionysus is told in chilling technical detail by M. Korres (ADelt 36 Chr 4). The removal of the last remaining metope of the Parthenon to the Museum and its replacement by a copy caused much press comment (passim 28/9.11.89) as did the replacement, after the comple- tion of this part of the conservation, of the last architrave block later in the year (Ethnos 3.3.90). G. Dontas describes the work of the Archaeological Society on the Acropolis in AE 1987, 301-10. Agora. In 1989 the American School carried out excava- tions in the area north of Adrianou, in property lot no. 1379/26. The remains of Byz houses, 9-12th Cts AD, were investigated. Rubble walls, floor levels, pithoi, and wells were uncovered, overlying the late Roman remains. The houses are of modest construction and few small finds were uncovered. One important exception to this picture of general poverty was the discovery of a handsome gold coin of Romanos III (1028- 1034 AD). Library of Hadrian. In 1981 restoration work on the supporting wall on Dexippou produced important evidence about alteration to the inner peristyle. Excavation by the Byzantine Ephorate below the floor of the narthex of the Church of the Ag. Asomatos sta Skala, disclosed a cruciform tomb with part of its decoration and trace of an inscription (ADelt 36 Chr 4-5). The press reports excavations by A. Choremi in 1989 which proved the building was founded on the W, on 2nd Ct BC houses. Finds included inscriptions and statuary, notably a colossal headless Nike. Pnyx. A article by E. Touloupa (Nea 1.3.90) highlights the encroachment on this important area in recent years. Thesion. At the church of Ag. Marina restoration work was conducted under M. Krasagaki on the chapel at the SE comer carved into the rock. The most recent altar was removed, revealing a section of a monolith column which had served as the original altar base. The modem wooden templon screen was removed and the traces of its predecessors discovered. All moder wall surfaces were removed. Painting layers were found on the surface of the rock wall. The preserved wall- paintings are found on the S wall and extend to the middle of the conch. The enthroned Platytera with Christ is in poor condition unlike the well-preserved archangel in imperial raiments. Poorly preserved portraits of Ag. Basileios and the other Hierarchs appear on the S wall under which was found a painted but illegible inscription. In the main church six layers of wall-painting were found, extending from modem times back to the 13th Ct. One of these bears an inscription giving the name of a painter Demetrios, known from another church as having been active c.1610. Work continues (ADelt 36 Chr 79-80). Inside the walls: Aktaiou. In the NE corner of a plot here in 1981 3 G tombs were discovered as well as part of a C structure (?workshop) and water channels of the 5th and 3rd Cts BC. Though the tombs had been disturbed in C times, one produced both a cinerary urn and a bronze oinochoe (19-20). Poulopoulou and Ephestion. Investigation of a plot here in 1981 revealed two LR water cisterns overlying part of a C structure, a HL well/reservoir (filled with interesting debris from nearby potteries including at least 5 Panathenaic amph- orai bearing the inscription TQN AOHN HOEN AOA2N and a LR storage emplacement (20-3). Praxitelous and Miltiadou. Traces of LA usage in this plot investigated in 1981 were covered by a red surface containing a few C and HL but mainly ER sherds. A LR (4th Ct AD) structure was later built but disturbed to the floors in Ott times (14-5). Tripodon. Part of the anc. Odos Tripodon and of the city drainage system has been uncovered in a late Ott/Othonian house being restored on the modem street of the same name. Other HL, R &amp; Byz finds include the base of a choregic monument, an olive press and pithoi (Mesembrine 19.12.89). Ypereidou (Plaka). Excavation in this plot in 1981 was restricted by danger to the adjacent buildings; finds were limited to an EHL storage jar and LR and post-Byz installa- tions (pithoi, drains, built well etc.) (15-6). Plat. Ag. Theodoroi. Excavations around the church produced nothing of note and the square was subsequently remodeled (ADelt 36 Chr 82-3). Plat. Karytse. The find in 1981 in rescue work of a storage pithos and part of a N-S road is reported. Of 7 surfaces, the lowest dated to LA and all the others to R (13-4). Plat. Kotzia. The press refers to a small leather bag, from the LC grave of a youth, as the most interesting find of this large excavation. The young man was also buried with his tortoise shell lyre (AR 1988-89, 15) 77 astragaloi, his strigil, two bone styluses, and six pots (Ethnos 8.8.89). The future of the archaeological remains in this area, originally destined for an underground carpark, has been widely discussed. Plat. Lysikratous. M. Korres reports work in 1981 which cleared part of the anc. Odos Tripodon (see above) with some of its surface and the adjacent buildings. The width of the road was shown to be 8.5m though narrowed by two small bases on the W. The structure lying W of the road is clearly a public building, possibly a stoa, which, though shallow, could have had considerable length along the road. It can be dated to the 4th Ct BC. Notable is the slope of the road down to the S (5- 7). Plat. Syntagmatos. The start of work on the Metro station has caused much press comment and many official visits. Actual R remains are reported: the head of a satyr and part of a structure (Kathemerine 8.2.90). Outside the walls: Kerameikos.In 1989 excavation by the German Institute under U. Knigge continued inside Building Y behind the Sacred Gate. The 1986-88 clearance of the overlying LR houses and workshops (AA 1989, 81) allowed the excavation of the underlying building. Sections of the four perimeter walls of a building were found, the size of which was about 300 sq.ms. The examination of the 1-1.50m pottery-packed fill of the inner room was the aim of the excavation. The upper surface levels of this sandy fill, dating to the beginning of the 3rd Ct BC lay directly under the R floor of the 3-5th Ct AD. There were no remains of buildings or levels dating to the period between the 3rd Ct AD and the 4th Ct BC; the meaning of this is not yet clear. The fill covered two</page><page sequence="5">6 E. B. FRENCH buildings of C date, which it had been possible to examine in only sections before now. The sandy fill contained a huge amount bf and rf pottery belonging to thousands of vases, such as kantharoi, skyphoi, pyxides (Fig. 2), cooking pots of all types, amphorai, including stamped examples, lamps and coins. The majority of the pottery belonged to the 4th Ct BC, although a few kantharos sherds could possibly date to the first decade of the 3rd Ct BC. The fill also contained some outstanding terracottas, including moulds, perhaps for metal jewellery (Fig. 3). Fig. 2 The extraordinary amount of pottery can only be interpreted as resulting from the general destruction of the settlement at Athens, a catastrophe which occurred from natural causes at the end of the 4th Ct BC, and for which there is evidence in other places in the Kerameikos. The origin of the sandy fill in which it was found remains unclear. The C buildings uncovered date, in the present state of our knowledge, from the end of the 5th Ct to the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC. It is planned to excavate these in 1990. Demetrakopoulou and Aglaurou. A LG tomb was dis- covered in 1981, consisting of a large burial ur to contain the cremation. The urn had plastic snakes as handles and on the lip and bore a chariot scene. Other finds included pottery, iron and lead objects and fragments of bone (19). Dryopon. In a plot investigated here in 1981 as well as part of a R (2nd Ct AD) wall, two layers of clayey soil produced quantities of bg pottery (4th-2nd Ct BC) and pot supports showing that these come from a pottery in the neighbourhood (19). Olympiou. Clearing in a plot here in 1981 proved that this area was used only as an open area or roadway in LR times (19). Pallenaion. A trial excavation here in 1981 revealed a HL pottery with two kilns, of which one was lifted and taken to the Museum at Areos 3 (23). Panepistemiou. In 1981 opposite the University the clearing of a large block enabled wide excavation. At the SW of the plot a trampled layer indicated a E-W roadway containing sherds G,A,E 5th Ct BC. Otherwise the finds comprised 81 tombs and 2 other burials all of R and LR date. Notable are structures associated with Ts 1,8 (10-13). Plataion and Prophetou Daniel. At this site in 1981 part of the paving of the road leading from the Kerameikos to the Academy of Plato with, in places, traces of wheel ruts was cleared (23). Tsame Karatassou. A trench dug along this street in 1981 by the water company disclosed a R bath in an excellent state of preservation. It had a central square covered by a brick-built dome and surrounded by semicircular niches, similar in plan to that by the Theatre of Dionysus. The exact construction date could not be determined (17-8). This example can be added to the 24 R baths listed by Travlos, the result of the good water supply ensured by Hadrian. National Garden. In 1981 the find of a large pithos some 7m NE of the large ECh basilica (N of the Olympeion) led to further investigation. A LR building with water cistern was the main discovery but traces of earlier and later usage were identified (16-7). Cleaning and reinforcement work was made on the ECh catacombs underneath the National Garden (ADelt 36 Chr 79). Plaka. A press report echoes public disquiet at the long delay in restoring the Benizelou house at Adrianou 96, the one remaining house of the 18th Ct and a building of great historical interest (Kathemerine 11.3.90). 1st Cemetery. The city of Athens intends to start conserva- tion of the important sculptures in this cemetery (Epikairotita 10.3.90). Greater Athens. B. Petrakos and his assistants for the 2nd Ephorate report in detail on some of the rescue work of 1981 in greater Athens and Attica (ADelt 36 Chr 41-73). Ano Glyphada. The following are reported for 1981 (47): A C wall boundary wall on Iteas (O.T.45); part of a roadway with supporting walls in good condition and an adjacent semicircular construction on Tyrtaiou and Skra (O.T.450); a rough terrace wall on Ioanninon (O.T.347) with a stone pavement nearby; 2 walls (undatable) with a fill of fine pebbles between them on Paphou (O.T.491). Daphne (the SE suburb not the W site). On Olgas (the road in from the E airport) in 1981 during construction work two cist tombs were found, containing white-ground lekythoi, a papyrus roll, metal objects, wooden ?dish, other pieces of wood and of ?leather, fragments of tortoise shell (47). Galatsi. Cleaning and reinforcement work was done to the structure and wall-paintings of the Omorphe Ekklesia (ADelt 36 Chr 79). Glyphada. For 1981 wall traces are reported (47-8) notably in a cutting in the road made by the DEH; the remains are individually without meaning. Kaisariani. The monastery underwent extensive restoration work supervised by E. Manolessou, particularly in the refec- tory and bath complex. Parallel moves were made to realise a systematic restoration programme for the monument (ADelt 36 Chr 77). Kephisia. Walls and drains of the R period are reported from 1981 at Othonos and Kokkote (56). Marousi. E. Delinikola supervised restoration work on the church of Ag. Demetrios, with important signed 17th Ct wall- paintings by the painter-priest Demetrios. Blocks from a possible older structure were discovered in the north wing (ADelt 36 Chr, 76). Peristeri. The destruction of marble sarcofagus in building work is reported (ADelt 36 Chr 46); two vases are described. Piraeus. (AR 1988-9, 15-6 with refs.) In 1981 the new museum, arranged by Prof. G. Despine, was opened. From 1981 G. Stainchaouer (41-4) reports the important excavation of over half a block of the ancient city prior to the</page><page sequence="6">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 7 construction of the Law Courts, a unique opportunity to record the city grid and to study stratified occupation of C, R and EByz. Two house complexes and part of a third, of the four the block would have contained, with the two side alleys were cleared; though R in construction they made use of C/HL walls as foundations showing that the grid was almost identical. Each house was 28.30 x 22.20m in area; the N was typically R in layout and detail while the S retained several earlier features. Shops were incorporated facing the main street, the houses being entered from the alleys. Both were decorated with wall painting, representing marbling and architectural detail, except for one room in the partially cleared NW house where the pattern was of hexagons and octagons containing emblemata. Of particular interest is the probability that the N house was later divided into two appartments (with possibly a third on a higher level reached by the preserved stairways) turning the house into an insula. In EByz one house of good quality was constructed over the remains. Movable finds included sculpture fragments (the head of a Herm, a statuette of Kybele) and inscriptions (one a 1st Ct ?AD market regula- tion). A quarry apparently used for the adjacent Themistokean wall was studied in the area of the Gymnasion of Kallipole (44) and another, overlaid by EHL building, was cleared on Neorion (46). At Tsamadou and Praxitelous a C wall was uncovered, of interest because this site is just N of the supposed site of Hippodamos' Agora (46). An EHL house or workshop was excavated on Zanne (44). There were numerous finds of C/HL cisterns and wells, several reused as refuse pits, and parts of drainage systems. In the grounds of the Biomech- anike Schole was a plastered burial chamber with 'mosaic' cement floor (44). Rouph. In 1981 the discovery during building work of a Doric column capital in R levels led to excavation in which an EH II settlement was found (with no trace of EH I), immedi- ately underlying the R, comprising rectangular houses of several phases, yards and workshops (46-7). Trachones (anc. Euonumos). (AR 1981-2, 12; 1982-3, 11) 0. Tzachou-Alexandri has presented the results of her excava- tion on the 4th Ct BC theatre at a lecture at the Archaeological Society. This building is unique in retaining the original rectangular form of the orchestra, perhaps because it was abandoned through drainage problems and not later modernised (see also Politika Themata 4.5.90.). ATTICA Aigosthena. Heavy damage in the second earthquake (with epicentre in the Alkyonides) and the after shocks is illustrated (8). Ano Boula. Here there are reports in 1981 of many stretches of ancient roadway, including wear traces in the rock and repairs; various surfaces are noted. Beside one section were Fig. 3</page><page sequence="7">8 E. B. FRENCH o o00 200 M Fig. 4 two funerary inscriptions HAYAH and EZlANAPOX IEANAPOY AXAPNEYE. Another inscription is reported built into the wall of a house IBEIO EYEAMEN. Such individual wall traces as were found were largely undatable, though at Dragatsaniou and Patmou remains of 2 walls may link to the adjacent settlement and shrine. At the junction of Athenon and Kabalas, adjacent to the site of work in 1973-4 (AR 1979-80, 14) more of the C structural complex was excavated in 1981, five rooms/areas and a court. On L. Bares a large portion of a R complex was excavated without elucidation of its function; among finds were an inscribed R lamp AOY KIOY, a wine-press not in situ; and an inscribed block (not originating here) reading EAIAAE- KE (50). Aulaki. Unauthorized building by the shrine of Apollo with detrimental result is reported (Nea 1.3.90) but is denied by the Ministry (Nea 14.3.90) who emphasize the archaeological importance of the area. Bari. In 1981 investigation of some 15 stremmata of the new DEH substation, revealed sixteen stretches of terrace walling running along the contours of the hill. Similar ones exist to the NE and in the area of the Military College. It is suggested that these link to traces of a structure (C by the sherds) and water channel on the hill to the S which may be a farmstead. This lies ca. 500m N of the Bari House excavated by the BSA (53- 4). </page><page sequence="8">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 9 At Dilopho on L. Bares (opp. the American School) part of an undated building complex was excavated in 1981 (54). At Blachika on Sokratous and Erakleiou a portion of the cemetery was discovered in 1981 containing 8 urns (children) on the E, from the end of the 6th Ct BC, 12 pyres on the W, mainly 6th Ct BC but with one early 5th (many bf vases) and slightly later, and 2 sarcophagi of later date (54-5, one illustration). Bouliagmeni. Controversy has arisen concerning building near the Temple of Apollo Zoster which itself lies within a beach complex; the adjacent priest's house is no longer visible (Eleutherotypia 9.6.89; Ethnos 15.11.89). In 1981 two separate sections of roadway (R and LR) were cleared in the same plot (Athenas/Polumnias/Borreou O.T.284- A) (53). Daphne. The Byzantine monastery underwent extensive conservation work to the building fabric and mosaics after the earthquakes, and was closed to the public (ADelt 36 Chr 77). Kalamos. E. Manolessou reports completion of structural reinforcement work on the Byzantine church of Ag. Nikolaos (ADelt 36 Chr 76). Eleusis. K. Preka reports her work in 1981 on the complete reorganization of the storerooms, an excellent and much needed task (9). Among chance finds, the result of laying telephone and electricity lines, largely LR but with occasional bg sherds two areas proved of special interest. On Nikolaidou an ER road was found with the adjacent buildings on either side dating from the 2nd-1st Ct BC. On Benizelou and Thebon another pebbled roadway led to a mill; a 3rd Ct AD lamp was found in a niche in an adjacent wall (25-7). G. Mylonas writes on 'Eleusis and the Eleusinian Mysteries' in AE 1987, 385-96. Kalybia. E. Koilakou reports extensive restoration work on the church of Ag. Petros, where the wall-paintings were thorough- ly cleaned by Sot. Koutabouli. A rare inscription dating them to 1232 also provided the name, place of origin and profession of the donor. Fragmentary traces of an older layer of painting were found (ADelt 36, 79). Kamaraiza. In cutting a new road the Forestry authorities discovered two C tombs, one cist and one rock-cut; if these are part of a cemetery it must extend not along the road but into the forest (56). Keratea: Ennia. The find of a trachyte mortar in the sea at a depth of 10m off this area is reported (Apogeumatini 5.9.89). Laurion. At the end of Kallia on a height above the sea (marked Chapelle Epannimondas on an old map), remains of an ECh three-aisled basilica were found in 1981. The narthex was floored with a handsome mosaic in good condition with ivy curling in a large central roundel. Many architectural members were found (capitals, bases etc.). The 2nd PR and C Ephorate passed the site to the Ist Byzantine who covered the mosaic but did not continue excavation (55). Marathon. The digging of a trench by the OTE across the area in 1981 produced finds in 3 areas: at Plasi (Odos Ag. Marinas) an ECh basilica and on Sophokleous C walls; and at Skitziza part of a tile grave (56-7). At Arnos investigation of an area with surface sherds led to the find of a C wall but nothing more; the sherds appear to be wash from the known site to the NW (58). Megalo Kabouri. The Ephorate reports for 1981 ten stretches of terrace walling and traces of roadway in O.T.287/7; sherds in the area date to HL and R (53). Megarid. The press reports local protests about further development and pollution in this area, which includes important archaeological areas (Prote 12.3.90). Megara. P. Zorides reports in detail with a useful map (Fig. 4) on 22 rescue excavations in the town in 1981 (28-40). Traces of buildings of C (#21), 4th Ct (#1, #12) and LR/EByz (#4) offered little interest but three areas revealed the basement structures well-known in Megara, of 5th Ct (#5) and HL (#13, #14). #14 was in particularly good condition and preserved the ladder, largely monolithic, by which it was entered. The use of these basements (thanks to finds in Eretria by P. Themelis, AR 1980-1, 9) is known to be for agricultural storage and chthonic worship, here thought to be related to Demeter, the city's second deity after Apollo. Water channels appeared in several plots (some of which interrelate #19, #9 with #17). The latter runs parallel to a roadway of R date, possibly part of Hadrian- ic improvements. Two sections of the city wall were uncovered, another round tower (#6) of the 5th Ct BC giving clear evidence that the upper structure was of brick, as the Peisistratid constructions at Eleusis and Athens. At #16 the foundations of a second square tower were cleared. Many tombs were discovered, partly in the known W (#19) cemetery, where 19 HL tombs apparently disturbed by earthquake were cleared, and in the S, with 12 tombs, mainly sarcophagi of the 5th Ct BC to HL. At #2, 9 tombs (5 sarcophagoi, 3 cist and 1 built) of 4th - 1st Ct BC were cleared. T2 had fragments of a marble funerary stele, one of which bore the inscription AEEIE.... At #3, near a single HL tomb lay a large section of a sculptured grave stele showing a man in himation holding a stick in his left hand. Beside him stands a child holding out something indistinguishable in his right hand. At #7 were 3 undated tombs; at #8, 8 HL and 1 A; at #9, 2 7th Ct BC; at #10, 1 LA; at #18, 3 LHL/ER of which 1 contained a young woman accompanied by 15 glass tearbottles, 8 bone pins, 5 earpicks et al.; at #20, 11 tombs of G to 5th Ct BC. At #15 there was found the torso of a male statue in marble wearing chiton and himation of ECh date, similar to the other known from Megara (AJA 29 (1925), 34). The monastery church of Ag. Ierotheos (12th Ct with important frescoes) was saved from damage thanks to restora- tion work undertaken in 1980 under C. Skarmoutsos; vaulting of the hegoumenion suffered, however (ADelt 36 Chr 77). Pera Bryse (on the road to Alepochori). In 1981 144 tombs in an extensive HL cemetery were excavated by B. Basilopou- lou. The burials were individual but often disturbed. Finds included figurines, lamps, pottery and bronzes (ADelt 36 Chr 40). Nea Palatia. The excavation of an extensive cemetery in 1981 is reported in detail by L. Kraniote but unfortunately without illustration. There were 8 clear enclosures (A-H) containing 60 (I-LX) burials and 7 (I-VII) pyres dating from early 5th Ct BC to R with poor finds compared with cemeteries only slightly further N (59-64).</page><page sequence="9">10 E. B. FRENCH Oropos. 18th Ct wall-paintings from the collapsed church of Ag. Nikolaos were removed and restored in the Ephorate's laboratories. These include a fine full-length St. John the Baptist and an enthroned Christ Pantokrator. They will be displayed at the new museum at Skala Oropou (ADelt 36 Chr 80). Parnetha: Kalogreza (Alsoupole). A cist grave was disclosed in 1981 by building work containing 5 vases (undated) and two pieces of metal (58). Porto Rafte. K. Skarmoutsou reports on excavations on the 'Driblia' site, where a large LR bath complex was found. Five rooms on a NS axis were built with rubble bonded with strong mortar. These included a praefurnium and caldarium. Only half the furnace, with its characteristic alternating groups of round suspensurae, was uncovered at the site's S extremity. No conclusion has been made as to the type of bath complex this was (frigidarium, laconicum or apodyterion etc.) Finds included fragments of wall-painting, small bronze objects, a great number of clay plaques and tegulae harnatae and terracotta ornamental objects, all dated to the 4th Ct AD. Although a provincial building of undistinguished construction, this represents the first building of its type to be found in the area (ADelt 36 Chr 83). Ramnous. B. Petrakos writes on the work of the Archaeologi- cal Society 1813-1987 in AE 1987, 267-98 and the report of his work in 1984 appears in PAE 146-211. In Ergon 1989 1-8, B. Petrakos gives an account of his latest work. In the Peribolos of Phanokrates 15 burials were excavated, 9 cremations, 5 tile-covered and 1 cist. Three were shown to belong to young men by the presence of strigils and astragaloi. Offerings of pottery also occured outside the periphery of the tumulus. The shrine of an unknown deity was cleared NE of the temple of Nemesis with traces of an altar, though previous excavation has made dating and other interpretation imposs- ible. A small tile-built water container shows that the worship required water but that the deity merited only a rough installa- tion. Work on the E Gate of the fort, unknown until recently, was rewarding both in the condition of the remains and the number of inscriptions recovered (texts given). Skala Oropou. On Kapodistrias in 1981 sections of a large HL stoa were cleared. The presence of floors, drains and washrooms indicates commercial use, as do finds of clay and lead weights (58-9). Sounion. A group of 14 5th-4th Ct amphorai, said to have been found underwater by fishermen 30 years ago, were confiscated by the police (Eleutherotipos 16.11.89). Thorikos. At the 51-52 Km of the Athens/Laurion road a washery was discovered in 1981 near a similar complex found previously (AR 1976-7, 15) (55). Work by the Belgian team under H. Mussche in 1989 concentrated on the theatre cemetery where 29 tombs grouped around small funerary monuments in the terrace formed by the great A N-S wall were cleared (urns, cists and 9 pyres) (Fig. 5). The grave goods were poor but allow dating to A and early C. Above one funerary monument was an iron smelting furnace (late, exact dating not yet possible) in good condition. To the W a section of the quarry for the theatre was found with evidence of the stone working, holes for wedges and even part of an iron wedge. In a heavy overburden of imported soil was plentiful coarse pottery, G to 6th Ct BC but also, surpris- ingly, HL, R and pre-Byz, which presumably indicates occupation, or more probably mining activity, during these periods. Two new fragments of the 4th Ct inscription giving details of theatrical presentations at Thorikos were found in the same deposit. Fig. 5 ISLANDS OF THE SARONIC GULF, ETC. Aigina. E. Papastaurou reports on rescue work in 1981 (ADelt 36 Chr 65-71). Twelve disturbed tombs (some subterranean chambers) of the late 6th and 5th Cts BC were found on Meristos and on Chalikaki-Meristos (Odos Ag. Paraskeues) 61 hastily dug and closely aligned graves (in 11 rows) of the early 5th Ct BC. Vases and some finds were recovered from the tombs and one of the graves had a marker inscribed (or rather scratched) EYAFPO and was unrobbed. This contained two burials one above the other and head to toe. Other under- ground chambers, in the main probably tombs but one certain- ly a storechamber, were found at Kampos Mylon, on L. Leouse, and on Aphaias; all seem to be C. Also C was a water channel found across a plot at Koutroubesi. A quarry at Ag. Photios (Odos Strategou Petrite) may on sherd evidence have</page><page sequence="10">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 11 been in use from C to Ott times. To LR date 4 well-built tombs approached from ground level by steps found at P. Kappou and Kolokotrone. On Paulou Aiginetou two phases of Ch building were disclosed to the later of which belong a mosaic pavement and an adjacent floor of white plaster. More pavement had been found nearby (ADelt 26 Chr 67). Dokos. Large scale work on this unique site (AR 1976-7, 17; 1977-8, 16) was resumed in 1989 and was widely reported in the press as well as at a packed public presentation (see also Enalia IB, Oct. 1989). It now seems quite certain that it is a wreck, from the position of the finds on a steep slope, and from the fact that many are intact. A pierced stone recovered near the entrance to the bay is thought to be an anchor, shed before the wreck, but it seems small and has only a small attachment hole. Lead rhomboi, assumed to be from Thorikos, were retrieved. On the island are surface indications of EH and Myc settlement. Kythera. M. Lazares reports on restoration and repair work on the medieval fortresses at Chora and Mylopotamos funded by the National Tourist Organisation (ADelt 36 Chr 77-8). These involved substantial reinforcement of the fortress wall masonry as well as of the churches enclosed therein. At the Chora fortress, the retaining wall of the approach was reinforced and repaired. Within the fortress external and internal restoration was undertaken on the small chapel adjoining the metropolitan church of the Myriodotissa where damp was threatening the good-quality wall paintings. Repairs were also made to the walls and fabric of the much decayed single-naved tiled church of Ag. Ioannes Prodromos. The Mylopotamos fortress contains 7 churches, some with important wall-paintings of the 16th-17th Ct The roofs of Ag. Ioannes Chrysostomos and Agioi Kosmas and Damianos were secured. A. Valmas and A. Portelanos supervised the restora- tion of the fine 18th Ct poros bell tower of the Myrtidion monastery. Restoration work was made on the wall-paintings in the churches of Ag. Demetrios at Kampianika and Ag. Sophia at Mylopotamos. At Palaiochora, major restoration work was undertaken on fallen wall-paintings at the church of the Panagia while PostByz icons at the churches of Ag. Eirene at Leibadi, Sotera at Pitsinianika and Archistratego at Mylopotamos underwent conservation. An inventory and photographic record of all icons in Kythiran' chapels was made (ADelt 36 Chr 80). A short geophysical survey was carried out at Palaiochora in 1989 by R.E. Jones for the team under G.E. Ince and Th. Koukoulis (BSA). Its purpose was to try and locate buried structures in areas of the site where there were particular questions arising out of the architectural survey, already completed (AR 1988-89, 61). It was appreciated from the outset that the geophysical survey would not be simple. Several factors, either singly or in combination, were expected that might create problems; these factors included sloping ground surfaces and the fre- quency of collapsed walls on or close to the surface, as well as the occurrence of sometimes thick vegetation. Nevertheless, it became possible in 1988 to identify three areas which not only posed clear architectural questions but where geophysical survey seemed practically feasible. It was decided to apply the technique of geophysical survey which experience has shown to be the best method for archaeological sites in Greece, namely earth resistance measurement using the twin probe array. The probe separation was with a few exceptions kept at 0.5m, the depth within which the building features were sought. Area 1 lies to the N of the kastron wall and between buildings 10 and 11. Some 300 readings were taken. Three major resistance features are discerned. Feature A, 10m in length, lies roughly parallel to the kastron; at its NW it seems to represent merely an extension of the building stone rubble piled up against the wall of the kastron, but as it progresses SE its shape appears more like that of a wall. Feature B, the weakest in intensity, is amphorous in shape but may represent a fragment of wall. The third, Feature C, is associated with the visible line of building stone on the W edge but also has an interesting octagonal stretch, 4m long. Area 2 is a small flat area to the N of building 16. Some 40 readings were taken at two probe separations, 0.5 and 1.0m. Very variable resistance readings were encountered in the middle of the area at 0.5m probe separation, indicating a lot of building rubble close to the surface. At im depth, however, the picture simplifies: there is one possible wall structure, only 2m long, projecting from the outer wall at right angles. Area 3 lies immediately S of Church 6. 160 measurements were taken in this area, which is relatively free of builing remains; it may indeed have been cleared for cultivation purposes earlier this century. Several resistance features are apparent. The principal and most interesting one runs across the area, roughly in a NE-SW direction. There is a short wall - like the anomaly at the N end, whose extent has not been fully mapped in this survey. At the S end an anomaly associated with the visible wall is observed. In the centre of the area there are two other anoma- lies; their shape suggests they are sections of a collapsed wall. For pottery collection the site was divided into 25 collection areas, some identical to the area of a particular building or church. Inaccessible areas and areas that produced no sherd material were noted. Apart from Area XVI (3 bags) and Area XXV (2 bags) each area produced one bag of sherds. For study (by P. Armstrong-Catling), the material was then divided into glazed finewares, glazed coarsewares and unglazed coarse- wares, and each group was dealt with separately. The glazed finewares showed a preponderence of Italian imports; in particular there are some notable examples of North Italian Sgraffito and Ramino-Manganese-Rosso Ware of the late 14th and early 15th Cts. All sherds in this group were catalogued, all feature sherds were drawn. There was a small number of glazed amphorai and cooking pots; all feature sherds of these types were drawn. Material representing c. 230 pithoi and c. 363 amphorai had been collected. In the time allowed it was not possible to catalogue these individually. A further class of find noted amongst the ceramic material was black glazed (ie. ancient) tile. Poros. From the area of the Temple of Poseidon the back fragment of a marble statue and a marble plaque, probably from a throne with a swan, were taken to the Museum in 1981 (71). Salamis: town. On L. Salaminos the find in 1981 of four tombs is reported (no date given though some finds mentioned) (65). Batsi. The find in 1985 by I. Dekoulakou of a HL relief giving the canons for standard measurements, now built into the church of Ay. Demetrios (Fig. 6), is reported (Kathemerine 6.8.89). See also AJA forthcoming. Kynosoura (Tymbos Salaminomachon). (AR 1988-9, 20) Some further work here in 1981 is reported (64).</page><page sequence="11">12 E. B. FRENCH in pithoi, 3 children in smaller vessels and 1 cist (below the pithoi). These lay over a layer of bones presumably collected for reburial. Among the bones were 2 oinochoai, a jug and an aryballos, a bronze pin, and a fragmentary iron ring; in a burial brushed to one side on the floor of another lay a bronze bowl, and from the pithoi came 2 skyphoi, 2 bronze pins and small bronze buckle. To the N of the graves a G wall of large unworked blocks apparently marked the edge of the burial area. In the middle and at the S of the plot the G layer consisted of small pebbles in which were found two pits, from one of which were recovered the many fragments of two G kraters, one showing women dancing, the other non-pictorial. A trial at the NW showed an underlying EH level. To the S of the agora, below the HL and R structures the G levels of another plot produced a pithos burial without grave goods and a cist tomb from which came a gold clasp, an iron sword with ivory handle, an iron dagger broken in two, and three iron rods, but no pottery. Fig. 6 Troizena. From 1981 there is reported the chance find just outside the walls of the anc town (and 150m from known R tombs) of a grave stele of the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC broken at the edges showing a standing female figure (73). ARGOLIS Ag. Triada (formerly Merbakas). Attempts continued in the important church of the to uncover and conserve the original LByz wall-paintings. A fine series of cycles and portraits decorate the church, some of them rare in the repertoire (ADelt 36 Chr 142-3). Argos. The 4th Ephorate report excavation of 40 building plots in 1980-81 (ADelt 36 Chr 85, 107-114) and describe some in detail. On Odos Parodos Theatrou were found EH apsidal walls and SE of the Aspis tombs and occupation levels of MH and LH. An ER tomb, robbed in antiquity was found on the E slopes of the Larisa; 1 tile-covered LR tomb and 7 Byz in two groups, one associated with a grave monument came to light on Odos Diomedous. E of the monument was a Byz kiln (a later phase than the tombs). On the corner of Odos Erakleous at the base of the Aspis, many tombs (50 MH, 55 HL, 47 R) were excavated by Ch. Piteros. In MH the area was carefully arranged with layers of pebbles and red sandy soil to distin- guish the burial areas. Though all the tombs were typical ordinary burials of their period, the large number has given much useful information. Among the grave goods, an MH cup imitating Kamares ware and a small group of R glass vessels are of particular interest. On the S side of the town, near the agora, at the corer of Odos Atreos, a extensive building plot revealed continuous occupation in well-built and spacious structures from HL to Byz times. On the S side was a paved road of the 4th Ct AD, 6m wide, with a small drain running down the middle. Other stretches of road uncovered in rescue work link with this and allow the line of major roads both N-S and E-W to be reconstructed. Several LR tombs of children and an osteotheke were found as well as 1 tile-covered and 2 built graves which rested on or were cut into the road. G and A levels with sherds but no structures were reached at the N. Two G cist tombs were also revealed. Among finds a re-used Corinthian capital and a Hebrew inscription in a tabula insata are noted. The same building complexes continued in the adjacent plot to the N (Odos Danaou), and below them 7 more G graves: 3 adults Fig. 7 In the SE suburbs of the present town, almost certainly outside the wall of the ancient city, a plot was excavated with HL graves. An ER roadway, 2.5-3 m. wide, extended N-S before bending SE. Also ER are a structure, probably a tomb, and surrounding burials with which were associated many small objects: bronze coins, bone and bronze pins, a buckle, fragmentary figurines and lamps. A small simple gold ring was found in foundations of the built tomb. In another plot in the SE, in an area where antiquities are rarely found, there came</page><page sequence="12">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 13 to light the foundations of a R structure over which passed a built drain, also R. Immediately SW of the Museum, a rich G cist grave with 2 burials was discovered, with many pots over the slab covering (6 small oinochoai, 2 pointed pyxides, 1 amphoriskos, 1 jug, 1 cup, 2 skyphoi, a bronze bowl and bronze headband); inside were found: a small oinochoe, cylindrical and ovoid pyxides, an iron plate and rod. Among the actual accoutre- ments were a bronze buckle, bronze pin, 5 bronze rings, 4 iron pins and 2 iron rings. Fig. 9 In the baths P. Aupert investigated the complex antedating phase I. It dates to the 1st Ct AD only slightly preceding the large Temple I, but following a series of HL structures. The main building is 17.2m long and at least 12m wide, surrounded by annexes and almost certainly faced by steps at the E. In the fill were many terracottas (notably Fig. 10, a temple miniature with 3 figures) which could indicate an area of cult. Fig. 8 The French School in 1989 continued excavation in four areas. Just N of the agora in the Karmogiannis plot, A. Pariente worked in 3 sections: (1) N. of the Pillared Hall, in AP74, 4 further burials of the late cemetery (still not closely datable) and some of LR were uncovered. 15 iron nails indicate at least 1 coffin. In the gravel layer (?a street) into which the tombs had been cut, three successive surfaces of pebbles and mortar were cleared. Further work is planned in this area. (2) Investigation was planned of the junction (AN 74) of the Stoa krepis with the R building to the N (Fig. 7). The later burials prevented excavation below the R levels this year but important information of R building methods was gained; the S wall and its tile-covered drainage channel (Fig. 8) were built in foundation trenches cut through a thick HL fill which were then filled with stones and mortar. Below the fill lay the reddish layer with burning antedating the building which had been noted previously in AM74. Associated were unusual baked clay'blocks (?bricks) which will be investigated in 1990. (3) Work inside the ?Stoa had hoped to disclose interior features and the date of the structure. Apart from a stuccoed poros capital recut as a basin and too small to belong, no material was found. The N wall is not preserved, presumably being replaced by the S wall of the R building. Two or three levels of poros chips from the ?dressing of the Stoa contained no dating evidence. Lower levels of red clay contained sporadic G sherds. R reuse of earlier stone, particu- larly the poros foundations is widely evidenced. On the Aspis G. Touchais carried out a season of study and conservation particularly of the MH. An intermediate architec- tural phase was identified, interestingly showing that a change of building technique occurred before this, the first phase using orthostats at the base, the later two only horizontal masonry (Fig. 9). The collapse of 2 trees previously left in AI33 allowed cleaning of the city wall, of which the internal facing (as well as the external in AI35) proved to rest on a heavy LMH wall. Fig. 10 In the theatre J.-Ch. Moretti carried out cleaning in the cavea which revealed the system of supporting the awning. The wooden poles were planted in large square holes (c. 34cm square by 30cm deep) cut into the backrest of the 1st, 11th, 23rd, 37th, 48th (Fig. 11), 61st and 74th rows; in the last two rows they alternate with smaller, shallow ones (24cm square by 27cm deep). In the 71st row there is a series of small (14xl7cm) roughly circular implacements which probably held the stakes by which the stays for the final row of poles were held. 3 trial trenches were dug to try to find the edge of the lower maenianum and information about the area prior to the building of the theatre. No sign of the S side of the cavea was found amid a series of fill levels dating no later than the 3rd Ct BC. Similar levels were found at the N, here full of rock chips from the cutting of the seats. The original soil level had</page><page sequence="13">14 E. B. FRENCH not been reached at a depth of 3m below the present ground level, proving that supporting fills were necessary on both N and S; furthermore the internal and external fills balanced one another without a supporting wall, except for one stretch found in another trial (Fig. 12). This section was of large rectangular limestone blocks with mortared and outlined joints. Opus caimenticium was used both as support and as foundation. This wall abuts a HL dry-stone retaining wall for the cavea fill. A test was made to determine the date of the mosaics at the end of the pulpitum in an area at the N where the tesserae were not preserved. Below the mortar layer fragments of ES B11 allow dating to the middle 2nd Ct AD. A further test reached the floor of the first stage building, later cut (2nd Ct AD) by a trench filled with broken pottery and stone and covered with a fill supported by a polygonal wall resting on this earliest floor. Fig. 11 Asine. Excavations by the Swedish School under R. Hagg and G. Nordquist in 1989 on the lower Barbouna slope at Asine - the last for the foreseeable future - reaffirmed the results from the excavations of the 1970's (Hagg and Hagg in AAA 8 (1975) 151-160; Excavations in the Barbouna area at Asine fasc. 1, 2, 4). A continuation of the LH IIB/IIIA wall system was revealed to the east of the earlier excavated walls. In the W a PG bothros was found, containing sherds, bones, shells, stones cracked from fire, and mudbrick. The finds show that a PG settlement existed on the lower Barbouna slope. Further S was discovered a G floor layer with the remains of at least two kraters, a small pyxis and a large undecorated vessel, all datable to LG (Fig. 13). A R road, running roughly E-W and consisting of nine layers was also examined. Above it were the traces of two post-R road surfaces. A deep shaft was taken down from the Myc level in order to check earlier stratigraphy. In the upper layers of this shaft were found strata belonging to the Myc settlement. Further down were mixed MH/LH layers into which a LH bothros had been dug down. At a slightly lower level appeared the top of a c. im deep stone-filled shaft of a LMH cist grave. This well- built cist was orientated roughly N-S, and covered with three conglomerate slabs. It contained a very well preserved skeleton. In the S part of the cist, by the head and the upper part of the skeleton, were found 3 Matt Painted vessels, 2 drinking cups and a jug. The grave had been dug down into EH and N strata. This is the first time that N material has been found at Asine. Fig. 12 The Berbati-Limnes Archaeological Survey. B. Wells for the Swedish Institute reports: "The conclusions reached in 1988 of modern routes of communication being of considerable age was strengthened as three open-air sites of the Late Pleistocene (c. 14.000 bp) were documented in the Kleisoura area in addition to a number of FN/EH ones. Several findspots of this latter date also dominate a road from Limnes southwards over the mountain passes and into the Argive plain, a thoroughfare which was apparently of importance until quite recently. Along this road were also found two Myc loci which, together with two contemporaneous sites on the Berbati valley bottom, must have constituted small farmsteads as is evident from the querns and the fragments of large pithoi found on them. Small C farmsteads were registered in the mountainous Limnes area but there then again follows a long hiatus until in late antiquity/early medieval times the valley bottom appears to have attracted the greatest attention. Agricultural installa- tions, including a 6th Ct AD olive press and numberous saddle quems were found. From Frankish/Venetian times one findspot in a secluded small valley above Prosumna in the Limnes district yielded much glazed pottery." Braserka. K.

(For the Greek team, K. Demakopoulou excavated the W Gate): "Excavations were carried out inside the W gate and inside the E Gate, where the surface was cleared from debris. It is hoped that next year's excavations in the area will clear a possible staircase between the E Gate and the Inner Gate. The excavation of a room inside the Inner Gate was completed. It was full of ashes and burnt mudbrick. The fire was so intense that many of the pots on the floor had been deformed by the heat. The pottery in the ash layer dates from LH IIIB2. A foundation trench for the Citadel Wall was found. It confirmed earlier observations that the Citadel Wall was built in LH IIIB2. Excavations continued on a terrace immediately below the summit of the Acropolis, where pure MH layers were found. The skeletons of two babies, a child and an adult were found. EH sherds were also collected. A long trench was excavated on one of the lowest terraces. An extensive layer with R and Med sherds was found here, with a MH Helladic layer preserved at the bottom. The finds confirm earlier results that the Citadel was inhabited in the 4th Ct AD and later, thus supplementing Pausanias' statement that Midea was deserted in his days." Epidauros: Apollo Malleatis Sanctuary. B. Lambrinoudakis reports on his work in 1984 in PAE 229-32. Work on the conservation of the remains and care of the site as well as detailed on-site study for publication were carried out by B. Lambrinoudakis and are reported in Ergon 1989, 12- 22. In particular the HL terrace wall was completely cleared of debris fallen largely from the stoa and altar above. A second supporting wall built after the disasters of the 1st Ct BC was found and proved of interesting construction. The stoa was not rebuilt after this destruction but remained a ruin for some time before being destroyed. Two tests NE and SE of the C entrance were made after stone piles had been moved. Roadways of various periods and drainage systems were discovered, linking to the usage of the temple area. Investigation of the Cistern of Antoninus was also con- tinued. Of importance to the interpretation of the late phases of the cult was the find in the Cistern of many small pyres with offerings of animal bones, and lamps of late Imperial date, probably showing that the Cistern was used for Mystery rites at this period. Major cleaning and conservation was also carried out in the remains of the R period which had filled up since the original excavation by Kabbadias. Traces of alterations in the 3rd Ct AD were identified and again traces of nocturnal rites with lamps were found. Similar work was also carried out in the Nymphaion. During cleaning for conservation of the prehistoric settement on the top of the hill, the R peribolos wall was again cleared, and proved to belong in the first instance to a date before the disaster of the 1st Ct AD.

No intact burials were found but all the tombs contained bones and finds (inc. 29 LH IIIA-B pots, 2 leaf spearheads, 2 sealstones, 16 conuli, etc.) heaped at the sides (ADelt 36 Chr 99-100). Other finds in the area included LR walls into which was built a stele showing a dog and 46 tombs, part of an large HL/R cemetery, containing mainly extended single burials. The use of wooden coffins is suggested by the presence of iron nails and pegs. Interesting are 9 female figurines found above one tomb, of which five are naked and seated of 2nd Ct BC type, and a grave relief showing a child holding a bird - reused as the wall of one grave.

Among finds from the widespread rescue work in 1981 reported by A. Banaka-Demake for the Ephorate are R walls, the hypocaust and wall paintings of a R. bath which continued in use into EByz times, two wells filled in by R and Byz times. HL remains were also widely found includ- ing part of a painted terracotta sima. In the plot of K. Kondyli, were found pieces of a marble Amazon, probably a 3rd Ct BC copy. At Koule NE of the Asklepeion, amid masonry, were found parts of a pebble pavement; other finds ranged from a stamped Cor amphora of 450 BC to a 5th Ct AD lamp. Notable was a votive altar of the Dioscuroi of the terracottae arulae type. A few R tombs largely without grave goods are also reported; one at the site Ag. Anna, had a marble slab at the opening on the E; this type is well a well known ECh type. A portion of geometric mosaic pavement was also found in this area and at the west of the plot a base of Attic marble presumably from a building extending W into the next plot. A further portion of the anc. road running E-W with structures on either side was investigated in the plot of G. Vlachos by the mod. Theatre/stadium: two poros column capitals were among the finds. Nearby in the plot of A. Anagnostakis a length of wall of considerable interest was uncovered; it was built of layers of field stones alternating with layers of baked bricks. On the W face at uneven intervals were 'dead-end' rectangular and square openings which must at one phase have held the wooden beams for a wooden ceiling. Signs of burning were found. From an earlier phase there is evidence of a stone paved floor. At the SW corer was found a marble Corinthian capital of Flavian date, corresponding to those of the outer columns of the Temple of Commodus in the Roman agora. In the same plot there was uncovered a R house (1st Ct AD) lying behind the N shops/stoa which surrounded the road running E-W from the anc. theatre (excavation 1973 of the ASCS). In the plot of P. Demakos was found a poros sar- cophagus containing bf pottery datable between 530-470 BC (ADelt 36 Chr 85-90). The excavations of 1989, under C.K. Williams of the ASCS, "were focused upon the SE corer of the precinct of Temple E, just W of the R forum and SE of the Archaeological Museum. The excavation of 1989 expanded the area already excavated around the tower-like construction at the S end of the W Shops. This massive foundation was less a design element for the W Shops than it was necessitated as a support for the E end of the S stoa which projected beyond the natural ridge on which the temenos of Temple E had been sited. Thus the architect was forced to construct a heavy basement wall and to fill it with earth up to the temenos floor level. As the hillside rose toward the W, however, less need existed for the massive substructure and thus the Romans reduced the size of the foundations, starting at 8.15m W of the front of the W shops. The S foundation wall of the stoa at its easternmost was about 1.40m. thick and reduced thereafter to a width of Im, but with buttresses, the two easternmost of which were exposed this year. The stoa was oriented E-W with its colonnade facing N, opening into the temenos of Temple E. It had a single row of axially placed interior columns, now attested only by the three easternmost exposed pier foundations, and no added rooms along its back wall. No superstructure was found in situ this year. Indeed, none of the substructure is preserved to a height of more than 1 m below the estimated level of the floor. Variations in building techniques suggest that there are two phases of construction in the stoas enclosing Temple E. The rebuilding is easily identifiable in the fabric of the W Shops, for the later construction is rubble and concrete, and, where ashlar, the blocks are very carelessly laid. The excavation of 1989 has cleared enough of the S end of the W Shops to show that the northernmost of three E-W foundations associated with the S stoa had been bonded into the later back wall of the W Shops. This trench, which once contained the foundation of the later front facade of the S stoa, this year was explored for about 3m of its length. Its northern edge is about 3.20m N of the corresponding edge of the earlier stylobate of the S stoa. Thus the width of the enlarged, later stoa, can be restored as having been about 11.80m wide. Post-temenos occupation: the W Shops appear to have survived intact down to the earthquake of 365 AD, after which the shops were reconstructed but the S stoa appears to have been radicaly redesigned. Interior columns 2 and 3 of the S</page><page sequence="16">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 17 stoa were removed and the general floor level was lowered about 1.5m. A wall with a doorway in its midsection was built across the width of the stoa where column 2 earlier had stood with a threshold block in the wall laid with its top at 83.29m above sea level. A second N-S wall was constructed at 1.60m W of the one with the door, making a N-S corridor here which probably gave access to a roadway that had run E-W along the S side of the stoa since the ER period. A room immediately W of the corridor was found to have had three superimposed earth floors. Little pottery was found on any of its floors: two coins were recovered from each of the three floor levels, the latest of which was minted between the years 395 and 450 AD. All were sealed under a stratum of fallen roof tiles. No stratum of later ECh date separated these levels from the LByz levels above. No attempt appears to have been made to rebuild the complex after the roof fell. One simple grave was found, however, which had been dug into the tile debris of the room; no grave goods were found, but the tiles that were used to cover the grave may have been gathered from the 5th Ct ruins into which the burial had been sunk. It appears that the grave had not been dug long after the complex was abandoned. Byz occupation and later levels: The area over the SE corner of the temenos of Temple E seems to have been occupied in the Byz period only after the E and LR ruins of the area were mined and the foundation trenches of the S stoa of the temenos were filled by debris. This activity started perhaps in the middle of the 11th Ct. The Byz glazed wares recovered from the various tipped fills within the trench which originally had contained the foundations for the first stylobate of the S stoa represent the accumulation of 50 to 80 years. The material is being analysed for various statistics. For example thus far the analysis has shown that glazed wares are about 1.5% of all Byz sherds in lots of about the time of Alexius I. Statistics will also show, it is hoped, the popularity of various types of glazed wares at various time within the LByz period. Strangely enough the Byzantines constructed their walls upon the soft back-fill of the trenches that they had just robbed of blocks. Thus the new suburb of the Byz city took on the orientation that the R city had previously had here, but at a slightly higher elevation. The Byz occupation appears to have been made in two phases. In the walls at the N comer of the excavation, i.e. in grids 75:E-F, one sees a floor level and associated door with threshold at an elevation of 84.37. The ground level was raised to an elevation of 84.96 to 85.10Om. in the second Byz phase. The Byz structures of the second phase appear to have been used by the Franks for as much as a half of a century, altered and repaired as need dictated during which time the occupants discarded their waste in newly dug bothroi. Probably in the third quarter of the 13th Ct, possibly slightly later, the Byz structures were cut down and then sealed under two to three compacted gravel surfaces that are to be associ- ated with a shed or stoa of the humblest sort. This stoa was open to its W with the roof supported at irregular intervals by columns, all spolia, including reused marble capitals of various dates, at least one marble Ionic base and reused monolithic shafts, some granite, some white marble, all of varying sizes and heights. The most interesting of the marbles, perhaps, is a reused capital with dolphins carved in the upper tier over a bottom tier of leaves. It can be dated to the late 2nd or early 3rd Ct AD, and probably came, originally, from the facade of the Temple of Neptune at the W end of the forum. Activity in this open-air complex can be attested down to the middle of the first quarter of the 14th Ct, judging by the large amount of Frankish coins which was found scattered along the eastern edge of the hard-packed gravel, many of which were purposefully cut into small segments. The latest coins found in this level are issues of Isabella and Philip of Tarento. A red, almost sterile, soil covered the gravel. This sherdless red soil must have been brought in as part of a man-made project from some outlying districts. It may have been deposited in the Venetian period and be related to the earth- work fortification projects that the Venetians planned else- where in the area for the defense of Corinth. A number of modem graves were found that had been dug down into this red fill. All of the graves were laid with heads toward the E; few had grave gifts, and, apparently, only a few of the deceased were buried in wooden coffins. This graveyard, although modem, has not been used within the memory of the modem inhabitants of Ancient Corinth." Derbeni. During road alteration, remains of a R bath were uncovered (ADelt 36 Chr, 93-4). Geraneia:Prathi.

Excavations in the Sanctuary of Poseidon in 1989 by the University of Chicago team under E. Gebhard "revealed vital information towards reconstructing the history of the sanctuary during the thirteen centuries of its existence, from a beginning in the middle of the 11th Ct BC to decline in the 3rd Ct AD. The work was largely stratigraphic, concentrating on the areas immediately adjacent to the temple of Poseidon and on the Rachi Settlement S of the sanctuary. The Sanctuary: one area of excavation centered on the sacrificial terraces E and S of the long altar in front of the Temple to Poseidon. The terraces, one over the other and extending ever farther to the E from the edge of a conglomer- ate plateau supporting the temple and altar, served to enlarge the area available for ceremonial activities such as the sacri- ficial meal. Three terraces belong to the G and A periods. Two more were formed later: one after the first Temple of Poseidon was destroyed by fire about 470 BC, the other after its C successor was badly damaged in 390 BC. In the last two cases the terraces were supported by debris from the damaged buildings. The final surface, laid out in the mid-4th Ct BC, stretched over 33m E of the long altar, and it had a N-S extent of over 35m. Large numbers of cups, from the PG through the A periods, were recovered in the layers of ash and burnt bone overlying the terraces and in the surfaces of the terraces themselves. To judge from the very small size of the fragments and the lack of abrasion on them it seems likely that the vessels were deliberately broken after they were used and that they were discarded very close to the place of sacrifice. Terracotta horse and rider figurines were also recovered in the</page><page sequence="17">18 E. B. FRENCH same context. The presence of Myc IIIB, IIIC and Submyc pottery should be noted, but there is no indication of prehis- toric cult activity. The first stadium in the sanctuary was built in the second half of the 6th Ct BC by creating yet another terrace to support a racetrack in the uneven terrain SE of the temple. The track in turn was supported along its NE side by a layer of earth and field stones, with a further embankment of compact red soil sloping up on the outside. The stadium terraces, which overlay the SE end of the A sacrificial area, had a combined width of 23m. On the N side of the temple Prof. Broneer had uncovered a series of roads that he dated from the A period through R. In the course of the current project the probable route of that road between the Isthmus and the sanctuary has been traced, and large sections of the road where it passed along the N side of the Temple of Poseidon have been uncovered. The road from the Isthmus led to the border of the sanctuary that, in the time of the Emperor Domitian, was marked by an arch that was later incorporated into the NE Gate of the Hexamilian Fortress (c. 405 AD). Once within the larger sanctuary the road passed N of the theatre and S of the Greek bath and probably the gymnasium complex (the latter not yet identified), to the point where it rose to the level of the temple plateau and passed within 15m. of the temple itself. This road must have been a very ancient pathway, because it follows the only available route through the steep valleys and gorges that cut into the E part of the Isthmus. In the C and HL periods it was supported on terraces with retaining walls. Furthermore, the current excavations have revealed that another road was constructed in the 4th Ct BC to link the sanctuary more directly with the Corinthian harbor at Kenchr- eai. The new road separated from the route to the Isthmus at a point immediately N of the Temple of Poseidon, taking a more E-W direction and then turning S to the Rachi Valley and the old route to Kenchreai. Where the road dropped sharply down from the temple plateau both at the N side and the E, the careful bedding and heavy foundations built for it provide an interesting example of Greek engineering. five heavily travelled road surfaces were uncovered at the NE corner of the plateau, one following the other and moving successively N until the R destruction of the sanctuary in 146 BC. It is important to note that at no point is there any sign of a boundary marker that would have separated the sacred space of the temenos and its temple from the roads that ran so close to its N flank. When the temple was eventually surrounded by stoas in the mid-2nd Ct AD special openings were provided for the E-W track to continue its normal course, linking the Isthmus and Kenchreai to the city of Corinth and the road to Argos. The idea presents itself that the cult of Isthmian Poseidon had a special meaning for the traveller by land, perhaps stronger than its ties to the sailor at sea. The present excavations on the Rachi settlement have brought to light architectural elements from more than one fine building that was probably erected on the Rachi ridge S of the sanctuary during the 5th Ct BC although the foundations for them have not yet been clearly defined. A cult place with attendent manufacture of terracotta figurines occupied the highest point of the hill from the 6th Ct BC and continued through the HL occupation of the site. In the 4th Ct BC a series of multi-room working complexes were built on the hill and a long, narrow building divided into five rooms ran along a street at the N side. Two new working complexes were excavated this season. They provided information about the planning and function of the structures, as well as material relating to the date of their construction and subsequent destruction by fire in the last quarter of the 3rd Ct BC. Each complex had its own storage chamber cut out of bed-rock and roofed with Corinthian pan tiles. Although most of the contents appears to have been removed before the fire, a number of architectural pieces, perhaps awaiting reuse, amphoras, figurines, and much cooking ware and fine pottery were recovered from them. Food was evidently being prepared and consumed in the area, so, although the structures revealed in the excavations appear to be workshops, they must have included living quarters, possibly in a second storey. The high quality of the decorated drinking cups and plates suggests a prosperous community. Its destruction by fire in the latter years of the 3rd Ct BC was, however, not the end of habitation on the hill. Careful excavation of the destruction debris this year has made it clear that the collapse of the roofs over the contents of the rooms was followed by a period of clean-up. The ceramics discovered in the destruction deposits offer potential for a broader typology and a more firmly based chronology for ceramics of the later 3rd Ct BC. Further study of the Rachi settlement this year has made it clear that its orientation was definitely to the S, overlooking the road to Kenchreai. The bulk of the working complexes, connected by numerous staircases cut into the bedrock, are located on the S slope of the hill. They thus took advantage of the winter sun and were somewhat sheltered from the fierce N wind. Furthermore, the customers they very likely served would have been found on the road to the busy Corinthian harbour town of Kenchreai. Excavations this season have produced sizable quantities of PG and G pottery from deposits in all areas, but especially in the SE terrace. Evidence for activity at Isthmia during the transition from the BA to the IA has been greatly increased with the recovery of Myc III C and SubMyc material. Signifi- cant new finds have also increased our knowledge of the LG and EPCor periods. Although most vessels used at Isthmia were Corinthian or Attic in origin, we have found evidence for Lakonian imports during the 8th Ct BC. At the same time the increased body of Argive monochrome vessels that bear no relation to dining activity suggests the dedication of pottery other than that used for the sacrificial meal. The predominately G deposits associ- ated with the SE terrace have also permitted a close study of the less well-known coarse vessels used in the sanctuary. The A pottery recovered this year has broadened our understanding of the centuries associated with the building of the A temple and the founding of the Isthmian Games. The overwhelmingly predominant shape is the kotyle, with associ- ated kraters, indicating the feasting and drinking connected with sanctuaries. Constantly present in quantity are miniature vessels that were used as dedications. Although the earliest PCor period is well-represented, continuing the prosperity of the G period, there does appear to be a lull until, towards the middle of the 7th Ct, there is a rise in activity, both feasting and dedicatory. This is strikingly contemporary with the construction of the A temple and the years leading to it. From then, activity seems to continue throughout the 7th and 6th Ct; only falling off after the first quarter of the 5th Ct, evidence of the effect of the fire in about 470 BC. For the R period new finds in a stratified context have clarified the early stages of development of the special series</page><page sequence="18">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 19 of ritual/votive vessels used in the cult of Palaimon. A date no earlier than c. 60 AD for these is now indicated by associated fine imported wares; the main series spans little more than a century. Phialai with a slip coating predominate in the earliest phases (along with lamps of Broneer type XVI). By 100 AD they are outnumbered by the special wheelmade lamps made for the sanctuary. Precise dates have now been established for the various versions of the latter, enumerated by Broneer in Isthmia III; the earliest examples consistently bear a thick whitewash coating. New are a number of ornamental (animal head) handles from paterae, clearly copying standard ER metal ware ritual vessels. In the NW part of the sanctuary in connection with the road beds, sealed contexts have finally appeared for the 2nd Ct BC relief bowls found scattered over the site. There are also some useful groups of the period 50-75 AD associated with the roads in the same area. Some earlier 1st Ct AD material is present here and elsewhere on the site, but the earliest struc- tures do not occur until around the time of Nero's visit in 67 AD. These finds, like the other R pottery from the main sanctuary, are basically domestic in character, closely matching finds from Corinth." Work in 1989 by the Ohio State/ UCLA team under T. Gregory focused on "continued study toward publication of previously excavated material and initiation of a project to catalogue and analyse the human skeletal remains from the excavation. In addition, a long term project of conservation in the Roman bath was begun. As well as work on the context pottery from the R bath, study was initiated on its decorative scheme, including preliminary analysis of all inventoried architectural pieces. One room at least was elaborately decorated with an entire series of engaged marble Corinthian pilasters. Pieces can be ident- ified which were cut to fill corers (internal and external) and around thresholds. The capitals of these took various forms, including at least two with a dolphin emblem. Substantial remains of two kinds of stucco decoration from sections of vaulted masonry will allow reconstruction of at least some of the vaulted masonry. The most complete evidence for interior decoration comes from Rooms III-V. Here a full reconstruction of the marble floor paving and wall veneer (in at least four distinct colors) and the moulded jambs, both arched and rectangular, will be possible. This year a preliminary study of the inventoried and non- inventoried pieces of Slavic pottery from the Roman bath was carried out. This resulted in the identification of 100 pieces of Slavic Ware, from nearly every room of the bath. This material did not concentrate along the interior of the Hexamilion, as had been expected, but it was found in large numbers at the S end of the bath as well. Preliminary investigation suggests that this material can be connected with poorly preserved traces of architecture above the destruction level of the bath and associated with other types of pottery not otherwise well known in the Corinthia that presumably dates to the same period (presumably 7th Ct AD). A comprehensive program of conservation was initiated in the Roman bath, under the direction of B. Marinos of the Fourth Ephorate. Conservation started with a thorough survey of the current state of the building and a review of conserva- tion needs. This was followed by cleaning of the building and removal of weeds growing in the bath. Conservation was begun on the mosaic in Room VII, a white mosaic with black rectangular border, which was in immediate danger of destruc- tion. Loose tesserae were replaced and cracks filled: a large hole in the S part was filled using a specially-constructed aluminum frame, and a brick wall was built along the W and S sides of the room, with a new deep bedding of rubble and mortar. In Room VI preparation was carried out for lifting and conservation of the figural mosaic in 1990. M. Giesen began a full osteological examination of the approximately 200 burials excavated at Isthmia since 1967. These burials came primarily from the W cemetery (6-5 Ct BC) and from the fortress (5th Ct AD and later). Information about stature, age, and sex was obtained, as well as data concerning pathologies and any other anomalies. In all, 88 burials (ie. individuals) were evaluated, representing 67 different graves. Of these, 22 burials could be identified as female, 12 as male; 53 were adults and 14 children. Prelimi- nary examination raises several interesting questions; the apparent preference for male burials in the W Cemetery (13 to 6) and the surprising presence of females and children in the Fortress, especially in the area of the NE Gate (4 males, 5 females, 9 adults 10 children)." Kastania. The church of the Dormition (single-naved with five-sided Bema apse) was declared a historical monument (ADelt 36 Chr 180). Korakou.

Landscaping work was carried out in the stadium under the direction S.G. Miller (ASCS). There were three basic components of this work: (1) The asphalt National Highway from Nemea to Corinth-Argos was cut, and it and the heavy deposits of earth beneath it were removed by machine. About 2,900m of earth were so removed. (2) The N of the stadium was enclosed with some 240m of wire fencing which con- nected to that erected longer ago around the S end and gates were placed on the E and W on the line of the previous asphalt. (3) Earth fill over the ancient race track and over the line of the Sacred Way was removed. W of the track and just N of the entrance tunnel earth was removed to the ancient levels. No trace of seats for spectators was discovered, but farming trenches of ECh date (6th Ct AD) covered the area and may have eliminated such traces. Along the E side of the track the running surface was uncovered next to the water channel between the 300 and 400 foot markers, and the whole of the ancient surface along the E side has thus been revealed. At the W end of the entrance tunnel the line of the Sacred Way which connected the stadium with the Sanctuary of Zeus was established in general terms. After extending W for about 7m, it turns to the N and must continue N for some consider- able distance in accordance with indications on the modem surface. It was discovered to have been cut through by a trench with a water channel of unknown destination of the 1st Ct AD. Several of the terracotta segments of this water channel were discovered within this trench, but no longer in their original positions. The line of the Sacred Way is established by a relatively thin layer of pebbles and gravel in a hard earth surface,</page><page sequence="19">20 E. B. FRENCH bordered by the soft bedrock through which the road was cut in the latet 4th Ct BC. At a distance of about 12m NW of the W end of the entrance tunnel, it is interrupted by a trench which appears to represent the SE comer of a building the walls of which were totally robbed out. A single poros limestone block remains askew in this trench, and it is surrounded by a layer of fallen roof tiles and decomposed mud brick. Limitations of time prevented more work in this area, and the full extent, nature, and date of this building are unknown. It is, indeed, possible that its date belongs to that time in the later HL period when the Games had been moved to Argos, the stadium in disuse, and before the cutting of the water channel of the 1st Ct AD. In other words, this building (of which only the negative impression now remains) may not be relevent to the workings of the stadium. Moveable finds from all the above work included 16 bronze coins ranging in date from E HL to Byz, 14 tiny fragments of a bronze statue, two lamps of ECh date, a Doric capital, and several fragments of roof tiles from the Early Temple of Zeus. When and why they were brought to the stadium is not apparent. Nemea Valley Project. Work continued in 1989 under the auspices of the ASCS. The fieldwork consisted of survey to revisit sites discovered in previous seasons and to study some areas not adequately covered in the past, including the slopes around the site of Tsoungiza. 17 new sites were collected and five old ones were revisited. Headway was also made on the study of the EH and early Myc remains from Tsoungiza. From the survey the finds of the historic periods, especially those from the site of Flius and the Byz material, were studied; study of the chipped stone from the survey was completed for publication. Perachora. The tripartite domed basilica of the Taxiarchs, with wall-paintings dated to 1767, was totally destroyed by the earthquake of 1981. As far as possible the paintings were removed from the ruins and transferred for conservation to the Ephorate's storerooms at Ancient Corinth. Similar work was undertaken at the churches of the Dormition, Ag. Demetrios, and Ag. Nikolaos in the vicinity of Perachora. Ag. Nikolaos (domed single-nave) was the katholikon of a small monastery and while spared collapse, work was needed to secure the structure. Inside, there are signed Byz wall-paintings of the 13th Ct (ADelt 36 Chr 173-74). Skaloma. Some 70m E of the area of Myc ChT's (AR 1988- 89, 24) where tomb robbers had disturbed a Myc ChT, rescue work showed that the tomb had in fact been destroyed in A times by a structure the heavy foundations of which rested on the tomb floor. Two fragmentary A pithoi were also found (ADelt 36 Chr 90-2). Pissia. After the earthquake of 1981, wall-paintings (PostByz) from the churches of Ag. Paraskeue and the Metamorphosis were removed from the badly damaged structures. The church of Ag. Athanasios (dated wall-paintings 1638) in the same area was preserved thanks to earlier conservation work (ADelt 36 Chr 174). Sikyon. K. Krystalle-Botse reports on her excavations here in 1984 in PAE 241-2. The site is marked on the map (opp. p. xiv) of sites investigated in Ergon 1989 but is not included in the text. Sikyon-Basiliko. The Ephorate decided that the church of Ag. Triada (single-naved, octagonal domed with three apses) which suffered widespread cracks and fissures in the earth- quake of 1981 should be preserved. The dome of the church of Ag. Nikolaos in the same village collapsed, but the remain- ing structure was sound and a restoration project is underway (ADelt 36 Chr 175). Stymphalos. H. Williams reports on his work in 1984 in PAE 243-7. A geophysical plan by St. Papamarinopoulos is pub- lished in Ergon 1989, 22. This is the result of experimental work in a new technique of seismic waves (developed original- ly for petroleum exploration) in collaboration with H. Williams and W. Slawson of the Canadian Institute. The AS has generously transferred the excavation rights on the site to the Candians, who plan further work in 1991. ARKADIA (5th Ephorate) Astros: Paralia (or Kastro). Trenches to check the results of surface exploration were opened by P.B. Phaklares (ADelt 36 Chr 131-2). The end of the peninsula is crowned with a medieval fort and there are traces of the C wall built by the Aiginetans (Thuc. IV 57.1). EH to Byz was known from the site and sherds of all periods were found in the trials, as well as traces of walls, obsidian artifacts, the neck of a glass vessel and many shells. Deliberate movement of soil connected with the fort was observed. Work was undertaken at the monastery of Loukou (ADelt 36 Chr 142-3). The single-naved church of Ag. Giorgios contains badly preserved 13th and 14th Ct wall-paintings, one of which (the Virgin) has been cleaned and restored. An important addition to the corpus of Byz churches in the region is the church of the Taxiarchoi at Skortsinos. Dating from the 14th Ct, it contains extensive cycles of high quality wall- paintings of that period (ADelt 36 Chr 145). Lebidi. Work was undertaken on the church of the Dormition of the Virgin (ADelt 36 Chr, 142-3). Lousoi. V. Mitsopoulou-Leon, for the Austrian School, continued work on the Temple of Artemis Hemera (AR 1988- 89, 33 and refs). A new working plan was drawn and this allowed some correction to details; the construction system was studied, in particular the method of laying the blocks. It was noted that the north wall was laid from either end and finished with a keystone at the middle. Among architectural pieces, now stored in Kato Lousoi, are Doric capitals of at least two types: the larger belong to the columns of the E facade and the smaller to the colonnades at the sides. Investi- gation of the foundations of the W wall showed that the rock was levelled before building and the blocks were laid on it and packed with limestone chips. Examination of the earth below the wall between the cella and the opisthodomos seemed to show a threshold and thus the opisthodomos was in reality an adyton. A bronze hand (Fig. 14) was found in a cranny beside the W. wall together with a coin of Pheneos dating between 421-362 BC. Prastos. Work was undertaken on the small churches of Ag. Demetrios and Ag. Athanasios (ADelt 36 Chr 142). Xeropigadi: Pyrgos or Anemomilos. This site on the W side of the headland Poumos, N of Anabolos (anc. Dini), lies near the Argos-Astros road. Remains of two anc. structures are reported by P. Phaklares (ADelt 36 Chr 133). Cleaning of the</page><page sequence="20">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 21 larger and excavation in the smaller showed that they had been watch towers or forts, the former probably C, the latter HL, from the finds of bgl ware and a coin of Argos. Fig. 14 LAKONIA (5th Ephorate) Lakonia Survey: The seventh season took place in 1989 and brings to an end all work except geophysical and final study of the pottery. Study of the finds. The main aim of this season's work was to continue the analysis of the pottery and chipped stone artifacts. The development of type series in the PR, A-C, HL, R, and Byz-Ott ceramics was completed. N material is restricted to the Late/Final stages. Although it is not extensive, we have characterized a series of large deep- bowl types with plain rims, and various pithos shapes. This material fits in chronologically with the chipped stone assem- blage. The EH assemblage is a rich one, derived from some 45 sites. Many of the pottery forms belong clearly with the main run of EH pottery elsewhere in Greece: sauceboats and bowls with incurving rims in the fine wares, for example, and the coarse basins in household fabrics. Nevertheless, certain specific Lakonian characteristics are emerging: the tall pedestal bases for fine bowls (already known from Waterhouse and Hope Simpson's survey work in Lakonia and from the Hagios Stephanos excavations) do not seem characteristic of the Argive, Corinthian, Attic or Boeotian repertory. The 'T'- rimmed profile for coarse basins, so common elsewhere, is very rare in the LS material. Not least because of the regional nature of the EH pottery, but also because of the condition of the surface finds, chronology has been a problem. Thick red- slipped fabrics have been assigned conditionally to EH I; the bulk of the pottery would appear to be EH II, but so far EH III has not been successfully defined in Lakonia. An attempt at seriation has produced some promising results, and it is hoped to extend this by a computer study at Nottingham. Study of the MH and LH pottery has also reached the stage where only study of the comparative literature remains to be done. Again an extensive range of fine and coarse vase types has been distinguished. In the MH repertory Dark Tempered, Dark Burnished, and Dark Lustrous Painted ware are all present. Finds of the MH-LH I transition are of some interest, with the oatmeal Minoanizing and fine white-slipped wares (also known from Hagios Stephanos) featuring. LH III kylikes and deep bowls are frequently coated monochrome, a feature also encountered in material from the Menelaion excavations. Unfortunately, there is hardly any patterned Myc pottery. The A and C ceramics produced a number of new types, though most sherds could be allocated to those established in the first study season. The pottery falls into five basic cat- egories: (i) fine table wares, bg, mostly consisting of small- medium open shapes (cups, skyphoi, mugs, bowls, lekanai, etc.) but including some large shapes (column kraters and other krater types); (ii) painted closed shapes, all medium-large (hydriai, stamnoi, ?amphorai, jugs, oinochoes); (iii) basins and mortaria in semi-fine/semi-coarse fabrics; (iv) cooking wares in semi-coarse fabric and in a wide range of forms, none of which can as yet be reconstructed in its entirety (but large and medium shapes are present); (v) pithoi (in a distinctive coarse fabric which continues into the HL period), normally decorated with applied 'rope cordon' and showing a range of rim forms. Parallels for much of this material are not found in the standard publications of Lakonian A-C pottery, most of which derives from sanctuary or cemetery contexts. Publication of the Survey's material will certainly contribute to a much better understanding of the pottery typical of Lakonian domestic contexts. In general, there seems to be little pottery that can be dated earlier than c. 550 BC, and probably none before c. 600, a point of great interest for the history of the region. In the period c. 550-425 the first two categories of pottery have a strongly Lakonian flavour (column kraters, hydriai, mugs), often distinguished by the application of ridges on the neck and/or shoulder. From the late 5th Ct on, the influence of Attic pottery is apparent, and many typical Lakonian forms disap- pear. This represents a major cultural break, whose historical context has yet to be defined. The significance of the pottery fabrics has not yet been fully considered. There are some indications, however, that cooking wares were produced at some specific centre specializing in their manufacture; this is suggested by the basic uniformity of their fabric, something that would not be expected had they been produced in a large number of local workshops. Late C ceramics are particularly well represented, as is the HL. The pottery does not allow a hard and fast line to be drawn between the two periods, and the same is true of the transition from LHL to R. In all, the HL pottery appears to be mostly local, there being only a few certain imports such as Megarian Bowls. The R ceramics are chiefly plain ware. Red slip is uncom- mon and is extremely worn; it has the same fabric as plain ware, suggesting that more slipped vessels may originally have been present. The main fabric represented is similar to one found at Corinth, and is presumably of Peloponnesian origin. Several of the shapes appear to be imitations of imported fine- ware types; nevertheless, there is a striking absence of imported fine ware within the rural catchment of Sparta, though imports from the Aegean, Italy, and the Levant are well attested from excavations in Sparta itself. Most of the pottery - fine table ware as well as household ware - can be attributed to E and MR by the combination of shapes and fabrics. There is considerable overlap with products of the HL period, with similar forms and fabrics in fine wares, cooking wares, amphoras, and tile.</page><page sequence="21">22 E. B. FRENCH On the other hand, little overlap is observed with the Byz period. There are a number of forms, particularly in the table wares, for which parallels outside Lakonia can be found, making them datable, if not closely. There are no finds indicative of the Byz Dark Age; indeed, the next ceramically recognizable period is MByz, and the 11th Ct in particular. The MByz painted and sgraffito red wares, which occur in such huge numbers throughout the Empire in the 11th and 12th Cts, are very rare in the LS area. They appear on five sites only, out of a total of 112 Byz-Ott sites; it is significant that these are the five largest sites. Frankish pottery, common at Mistra, is entirely absent from the LS area. The LByz period, like the Middle, is poorly represented by glazed fine wares. Those that exist are predominantly local products: slip-painted with added green glaze, glaze-painted, and painted incised wares. A local variation of slip-painted, which probably spans the LByz and Ott periods, has been identified; its clay surface is prepared with a red wash, creating a greater contrast than usual between the background and slip. Amphorai make up the largest proportion of the material on the Byz and post-Byz sites. From the detailed sampling of one large site, and the collection of c. 2,000 sherds from it, it has been possible to establish a classification of these amphoras which will not only make a substantial contribution to understanding other medi- eval sites in our survey area, but will also have a broader application for the study of Byz pottery in general, since so few unglazed wares are published. All of the c. 1,500 chipped stone finds, comprising mostly obsidian and some ground stone artifacts have been studied. A Late or Final N facies has been recognized, especially at site LS48. Distinctive types include tanged arrowheads, end- scrapers, and side/end-scrapers; the discovery of cores suggests that obsidian was worked on the sites, and the technique is characterized by pressure-flaking and much retouch. A number of polished stone axes have been recovered from different places; they are broadly similar in morphology and material, but the types of stone are sufficiently varied to suggest a non- homogeneous source (possibly local river-stones?). EH sites have produced large numbers of obsidian tools, with prismatic blades especially common; the tanged arrowheads no longer occur. Cores have been found, again suggesting manufacture at the sites; the blades show little retouch. Occasional scatters or single finds away from sites tend to consist of complete blades, suggesting intact artifacts lost in the fields. Querns and grinders are also particularly prominent in this period. They are made most frequently of local schist, and tend to be of a flat or saddle shape. Polishers of a brown-red ?quartzite are found at both LN I and EH sites. Very little obsidian has been recovered from MH or LH sites. The c. 300 small finds of different periods, including terracotta figurines, loom weights, a few coins, and other objects have been studied. The crude figurines from the sanctuary site of Messapian Zeus (LS415 at Tsakona, see below) formed an important part of the work. Types included ithyphallic males, females, and some animals. As well as inscriptions on stone mentioned by earlier scholars and rediscovered by the Survey, there are several new docu- ments from the A to R periods, most of which probably came from Sparta: they include at least two fragments of early Imperial rescripts. In addition, a schist grave stele bearing the name Hybrion was found in the N of the survey area, and a fragmentary A dedication was recovered from a hilltop near Chrusafa. Several new stamps on tile and brick were noted, including one which permits an emendation in the text of Pausanias' description of Sparta. Inscriptions from the monas- tery of Ag. Saranda, many previously published by Sakellarop- oulos, were re-transcribed and in some cases the texts were improved. Finally, 'vernacular' texts such as dates on houses and threshing-floors help give a picture of epigraphic usage across the Survey area in recent periods, suggesting interesting parallels and contrasts with ancient times. The Site Catalogue, which is to form an essential part of the publication has been completed in first draft. Particular attention was paid to land use, soil data, and landform descrip- tions. Computerization of the site data and other information was completed. Amyklai. Th. Spyropoulos reports (ADelt 36 Chr 126-9) on investigations in the area, notably of an extensive EH to R settlement SW of the main site and of 6 LH IIIA-B ChTs at Spelakia typical except for very short dromoi. In trials on the settlement immediately below the Ag. Kyriake shrine, two construction phases, LH IIIA and B, were identified. The importance of this area (see also BSA 55(1960)74-6) which may be the palace site of Lakonia is emphasized. Angelona: Bastiza. A cemetery of Myc ChTs has been excavated. One large square chamber was well preserved, with two skeletons from the latest interments in situ on the right of the entrance. Traces of other burials and offerings were found by the walls and in the middle and by the back wall were a slab-covered cists, the latter containing 3 LH IIIB pots (ADelt 36 Chr 130-1). Aphyssou: Tsakona. H.W. Catling for the British School reports: "The site had been located and identified as a sanctu- ary by the Lakonia Survey in 1985. It lies on the deeply scarred sedimentary ridge which overhangs the N side of the road from Sparta to Chrysafa. It is 5kms ENE of Sparta, a similar distance NNE of Afyssou, within whose village lands it lies. The sanctuary lies approximately on the 420m contour, with wide views to all points of the compass. From it the location of the Athena Chalkioikos and Orthia sanctuaries in Sparta are clearly visible, as are the Menelaion and the Amyklaion. It comprises a rounded hilltop some 50m E-W by 30 N-S, with saddles E and W connecting it to adjacent hilltops of the same spur, steep slopes N and S dropping into the valleys which define the spur on either side. When first found, the hilltop and N slope were covered in quite dense srcub, making detailed examination difficult. Many handmade terracottas were found, particularly on the N slope. From what could be seen of the summit it seemed likely that there had been a building there, of some architectural interest, since surface material recovered included fragments of architectural terracottas. The character of the surface finds suggested occupation from the 7th Ct BC, and that the site continued in use in R times. A year after the site's discovery, the grazier who enjoys the use of the land (once part of the estates of the nearby Monas- tery of Ag. Tessarakonta, now state land) deeply cultivated the hilltop with a tractor plough, causing serious damage to the site. This was observed by the Lakonia Survey who reported the damage to the Ephorate. In its turn, the Ephorate ordered the grazier not to do any further work on the site. In July 1988 a series of extensive fires destroyed hundreds of stremmata of olive trees and scrubland, from Sellasia S into the village lands of Afyssou. The Tsakona ridge was engulfed in this fire, and</page><page sequence="22">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 23 what remained of the scrub on the hill after cultivation was destroyed. It was apparent last autumn that if anything further was to be learned about the site, immediate excavation was imperative. The surface finds suggested the effort and expense of an excavation would be fully justified. The objectives of the excavation were to establish the plan, nature and chronology of whatever building had stood on the hilltop, to recover votive material in its archaeological contexts, and, if possible, identify the deity honoured by the sanctuary. To differing degrees, these objectives were realized. The site was in an unattractive state when the excavation started, scarred by deep plough furrows and disfigured by the blackened skeletons of the bushes burnt last year. Higgledy- piggledy lines of stone hinted at the position of erstwhile walls. To the W, on the lip of the saddle separating the hill from its W neighbours, three stones breaking surface in a line hinted at a peribolos wall; they had been noted by the Lakonia Survey. To them we shall return. A grid of 5m squares, whose axis took careful account of the likely axis of the buried building was laid out encompass- ing the steep slopes on the N and S sides. Excavation was directed to stripping off as much topsoil as possible as soon as possible to define the building quickly and establish further excavation priorities. Open-area techniques was adopted, no baulks, consequently, being left. This proved the correct decision. The scanty remains were difficult enough to comprehend in this open system; they would have been unintelligble half-covered by a network of lm, or 0.5m baulks. With very few exceptions, deposits were shallow, overlying the weathered cobbly conglomerate of which much of the hilltop stereo was composed. The results may be summarized as follows: the hilltop was almost certainly devoted to the cult of Zeus Mesapeus (which finds further confirmation in a 1987 stray find 300m W of the hilltop, publication of which by R.W.V. Catling and G. Shipley is in press for BSA 85). The earliest object identified is part of the decorated shaft of a G bronze pin. But there is no G pottery and little if any EA. The use of the site seems concentrated in the later 6th Ct BC into the 4th Ct BC, with a R revival in the 3rd-4th Cts AD. A rectangular building some 20m E-W, 5m N-S occupied the centre of the hill, following its natural axis. It had an E facing entrance and may have been divided into pro-thalamos and thalamos. The walls, 0.55m wide, had originally been built of schist slabs, laid either direct on bedrock, or, in places, in a shallow-cut foundation trench. The floor, where it could be identified, seemed to have been made by a skim of marl to level off the roughness of the pebble-tops in the conglomerate. A number of internal post-holes was found in the E half, on axis, suggesting the method by which the heavy roof of Lakonian tiles will have been supported. This roof had been embellished by terracotta disk akroteria and painted terracotta antifixes. Parts of ridge tiles were identified. In the W half of the building, Lakonian bg (mugs, stemless cups, spherical aryballoi) of the 4th Ct BC type was found. The E half of the building contained a broad rectangular cut depression in the stereo found filled with dark soil containing many handmade terracottas, plain miniature aryballoi and fragments of mould-made lamps, among them several with vine leaves and clusters on the shoulders akin to material from the Athenian Agora dated 3rd-4th Cts AD. There were signs of clumsy repair to the N wall of the original building at this point, and it seems possible that activity in the R period began amid the remains of a ruined shrine. An intrusive burial, which postdated the R 'pit', had cut through the E end of the S wall of the original building. There were no grave-goods. Later in excavation we began to investigate the supposed peribolos wall at the W edge of the site. Surprisingly this proved to belong not to an enclosure wall, but to a second building, terraced into the NW angle of the hill (Fig. 15). Only its S half is preserved, but in a much better state than the shrine building. Under rubble collapsed from its walls was a roof fall of large Lakonian tiles, for the most part found lying flat. Those overlay two successive floors and their makeup. The building's identity is unknown, though a dining room is one possibility. Fig. 15 Trenches were opened on the steep (1 in 3) N slope and the shallower S slope to observe the manner in which the site had degraded. Much votive material (terracottas, miniature vases, other pottery) and comminuted roof tile came from these trenches, and it is clear from this, and general surface indica- tions that a mass of material covers the whole N slope and, to a lesser extent, the S slope. The identification of the site as a shrine of Zeus Mesapeus rests on the discovery of several fragmentary tile stamps (Fig. 16), the best preserved of which reads: AAMOCIO/MECC.... Taken with the surface find of 1987 referred to above, this seems well in favour of the identification. Fig. 16 The site must have once been quite rich in votive offerings if we can judge from the surviving scraps. Of two inscriptions</page><page sequence="23">24 E. B. FRENCH found, one (sadly, very worn), of the 6th Ct BC, perhaps refers to the dedication of a statue. The second is cut on the fragment of a stone halter, dedicated by someone whose name begins KYNOZ. Of 30-40 catalogued bronzes (which included small frag- ments of sheet metal), five are arrowheads, one a very fine javelin head, several others join to make up a small part of shield facing. Another shield fitting was found. Iron objects include one or two weapon fragments. A very fine gem (Fig. 17) was recovered - a red stone, with white flecks on its back, pierced for mounting on a swivel, with intaglio of a curly- haired archer wearing tunic and kilt, bow in one extended hand, two arrows in the other. Fig. 17 More than 2000 complete or fragmentary handmade terracotta statuettes were recovered. These are grotesques, of which a majority portray standing, sitting or squatting ithy- phallic men. There are a few naked women, some prominently displaying their genitals, some pregnant. There is a very small number of mould-made terracottas. There is surprisingly little pottery, nearly all of it very shattered. The spherical aryballos appears to be the commonest shape; large vases are very rare, though fragments of a reeded bg hydria were noted in the ancilliary building." Bresthena. Restoration and conservation work was undertaken at the church of the Panagia (layer found beneath the upper 18th Ct paintings) (ADelt 36 Chr 140). Geraki. Restoration and conservation work was undertaken at the church of Ag. Basileios; important but much damaged wall-paintings were provisionally dated to the 13th or 14th Ct (ADelt 36 Chr 139). Gytheion. Near the theatre in the Samiotis plot, in spite of difficulties with the high water level, LR structures continuing those from the adjacent Liverakis plot (AR 1988-89, 31) were found. A notable find was a large marble threshold. In the area of the barracks more was uncovered on the W of the public building considered a bath by the previous excavator. Notable are a inscribed marble statue base, presumably that of the athlete previously discovered, and another broken inscription which would have covered two adjacent slabs, presumably the base of the large headless toga'd R statue found nearby in the same level. Immediately below was a female statue, also headless, half life size and next to it part of a marble Latin inscription. R graves in two (at least) three-arched built tombs with graves around them as well as 3 pithos burials were found in the area of the Ergatikes Katoikies. The S structure was well preserved with an entrance marked by limestone slabs and pilasters. In the same area the W and S wings of a LR building were excavated; the S, which was divided by 7 pilasters into 8 compartments for water and had foundations for columns, seems to have been a Stoa. The N had at least two niches for statues (the hand of one just under life-size was found), and in an adjacent passage the fragment of a geometric mosaic pavement. The building, which is assigned to the 4th Ct AD, was almost certainly public as it lies at the point on the Acropolis suitable for a public building of this size. It would have been destroyed in the earthquake of 375 AD, of which signs were obvious in the displacement to the N of one wall. Two fragments from marble Ionic capitals were found. On Dirou three sides of a strong rectangular structure, open on the E, were excavated. No finds were recovered. By the W wall was an open and robbed tile grave (ADelt 36 Chr 125-6). Kokkinia: Kastraki. (Anc. Akriai) (AR 1988-89, 31) The continuation of Greek-French work on this site is reported by J. de la Geniere. Exploration of the platform and consideration of the orientation of the remains with the mountain behind makes the identification of the shrine of Meter Theon certain. A small structure with 4 Doric columns on the facade can be dated to the 6th Ct BC. Later (HL/ER) a chamber with colonnade on two sides was built in front. Offerings include libation tubes mounted with birds (Fig. 18), cups with holes in the base (Fig. 19), and many inscribed tiles (Fig. 20). Kokkinorachi. The find of a LR or ECh private bath with marble internal revetments and paving is reported (Nea 1.11.89). Fig. 18 Leukochoma (pr. Karaspai). Previously unpublished churches of Ag. Georgios (Post-Byz) and Ag. Paraskeue (Byz) were reported, both of which contain wall-paintings in poor condi- tion but of artistic merit (e.g. the Archangel at Ag. Georgios) (ADelt 36 Chr 144-5). Longanikos: Ag. Georgios. The wall-painting of Ag. Georgios removed from this Byz church in 1980 was restored and set up in the church of Prophitis Ilias (ADelt 36 Chr 138-39). Koumousta (Pentabloi).

Constantine and Helen and Profitis Ilias. These date from the Ott period and contain 19th Ct wall- paintings. The finely carved wooden templon balustrade at Profitis Ilias is worthy of note. The single-naved church of the Panagia a little outside the village dates from the 13th or early 14th Ct and contains some fine wall-paintings which are in urgent need of conservation (ADelt 36 Chr 144).

The task of making a thorough record of the monastery church of the Pantanassa with a view towards a full restoration programme was entrusted to a private architectural practice. Retouching of the wall-paintings continued together with mechanical cleaning of the Post-Byz paintings in the hema. The Annunciation (pre-18th Ct) on the west wall of the nave has been removed for restoration after which it will be replaced. A temporary work-room was set up in a section of the church of Ag. Demetrios to facilitate the restoration and conservation of many removed wall-paintings which had been stored there for many years, most of these being attached to large and heavy slabs. The provenance of most of these is uncertain, although they are all from Mystras. Fourteen Post- Byz icons were added to the Mystras Museum's collection. In the village of Mystras extensive restoration work supervized by M. Philentra was undertaken on the Salbara residence donated to the Greek State to house a Museum of Folk Arts and Crafts. The building is a two-storeyed early 19th Ct mansion in stone and wood (ADelt 36 Chr 135. 137). Peristeri: Solakos. In a hill cut by the road from Ampelochori to Brontama a robbed Myc ChT was found and excavated. There are indications of others on the same hill (ADelt 36 Chr 129). Sparta. Th. Spyropoulos gives an account of 4 rescue excava- tions within the town (ADelt 36 Chr 121-125; the references given to the OT grid are included here). By Artemidos Orthias (OT 102) the extensive remains of a R bath were excavated which must have extended under the plots to W and S. To the E the structure had been much disturbed by a later building. At the E edge of the plot a small store was cleared which must belong to a shrine; the finds dated from G to ER. In a plot on Triakosion (OT 124) the remains of 2 R walls and 2 drains (either from a courtyard or the street) were found. Some of the finds from Artemidos (OT 115) are C, notably a large built drain running N-S across the area, the outer wall of which was later used as a part of a strong structure, and two square buildings to the W of the later wall. Other structures in the area are R. 4th Ct bf and plain pottery included part of a bf lekythos with the lower part of a human figure. On Thermo- pylon (OT 140) a well preserved 3rd Ct AD cruciform building was excavated; earlier levels revealed on the N the W wing of another cruciform building (KI) itself resting on another structure; a similar "Pi" shaped structure lay on the E (K2); K3, of which the NE corner and adjacent walls were excavated, seems to have served the same purpose as the later cruciform building, since a small oblong terracotta plaque set in the wall echoes the tiled passage of the later structure; K4 to the S was poorly preserved, though two Ionic bases enclosed by the water channel align with it. The cruciform building itself was built in opus testaceum with a tiled floor of which only one tile is preserved in situ; on this lay the lower part of a tile pier like those of a hypocaust. Neither the extent of this feature nor its purpose could be determined. The room was, however, a catch-pit for water which ran through a channel from the E face of the S wing; this linked with the cylindrical water channel found to the SE outside the building. The W section of the cross was narrowed by pilasters and on its N wall was a small tiled outlet. Byz pottery accompanied an overlying wall. Fig. 20 Acropolis. G. Waywell and J. Wilkes for the British School report on the 1989 season: "The two adjacent chambers of the Stoa which were selected for investigation (designated RS XI and RS XII. reckoning from the E end of the structure) lie</page><page sequence="25">26 E. B. FRENCH roughly at the mid-point of the visible surviving remains, and are distinguished from the rest of the barrel-vaulted compart- ments by their semicircular apses which extend northwards into the 1.75m thickness of the retaining wall set against the SE spur of the Acropolis hill. The building was constructed of fine-quality concrete with a core of heavy, rounded stones, and a facing of new-fired brick. The layout was carefully symmet- rical, with walls and piers turning at right-angles, and the two apses of RS XI and XII consisting of perfect semicircles of c. 1.75m radius. The upper wall surface of each apse is decorated with three brick-faced niches, of which the central one is semicircular and half-domed (radius 48cm), and the outer pair rectangular and arched (width 46cm, depth 50cm). Orifices in the upper back wall of each semicircular niche are likely to have been for water outlets fed by narrow conduits that extend back and upwards into the hill behind. Some 29cm below the bottom of the niches, a brick-built ledge, 35cm in width, springs forward, being carried all the way round the semicircu- lar plan of the apse and extending down to the original floor level some 1.10m below. Although described as a 'seat' by Traquair (BSA 12 (1905-6) 417), this ledge is likely to have been the support for a marble basin or distribution trough to receive the water pouring from the outlets above. The half- domes of each apse, which are fully preserved, have been skilfully constructed of brick-faced concrete, with a course of extra-large bricks at their springing points and 'key-stones' of transverse bricks at the apexes. Evidence of surviving brick- work on the W side of RS XII suggests that these central two bays had cross-vaulting, apparently also in brick, although the southernmost piers which supported this have yet to be uncovered. From these details of design and construction, the date of the Stoa is likely to be sometime during the 2nd Ct AD. The original decor of the two compartments consisted of high-quality marble revetment in a variety of colours, and a floor of marble slabs. Virtually all of this had been robbed from the building, but sufficient traces remained in niches and angles to indicate its character. Evidence surviving on the projecting ledge in RS XII proved that rectangular panels of marble 2cm thick and 22cm wide had been pressed against a curving bed of mortar and deliberately fractured along the centre line to adhere more closely to the curvature of the apse. At the level of the arches of the niches, lines of marble plugs c. 4cm in diameter had been inserted into the bricks and mortar and secured by iron clamps. Similar devices were employed in the R Baths at Argos and elsewhere in the region. Their purpose was evidently to secure the heavier elements of architectural ornament that were attached to the wall in the vicinity of the niches. Several other marble dowels were found on the surface of the brickwork both within and outside the apses below the springing of the half-domes. The fill of the two chambers was excavated to the level of the original floor within roughly half of the area under investigation (which measured 11x7m altogether). Stratified deposits survived to a depth of more than 3.5m, and consisted of the remains of several phases of occupation from the R period to modem times, the latest feature being the sounding carried out by the British School at Athens in 1905 (BSA 12 (1905-6)417), located in the apse of RS XI. Some time after the marble had been stripped from the Stoa, the lower walls and floor were coated with pink, waterproof plaster (opus signinum), possibly to serve as a cistern in the LR period. In the angles of RS XI the fillet of pink mortar was found to cover small fragments of marble wall revetment still in position. The floor of this phase had been laid on a bedding formed from fragments of brick, tile and marble slabs set on edge, and the top surface skimmed smooth with a thin coating of pink plaster. The original function of the two apsed compartments remains to be fully elucidated. Original partition walls of brick-faced concrete survive on the E edge of RS XI and the W edge of RS XII, with a square niche set into the former. Between the compartments, however, it appears that no continuous partition existed. Instead the line of division terminated in a short brick pier. In a later phase, subsequent to the laying of the floor of pink mortar, a partition wall the width of the brick pier was constructed of white plaster and brick fragments, probably during the MByz period. The MByz period (11-12 Cts) seems to have seen consider- able activity and reconstruction within the Stoa. It was at this time apparently that the remains of the Stoa in the S of the area were incorporated in a building decorated with figured fresco painting. The walls of this church-like structure were partly founded on the brick and concrete of the original Stoa, partly new constructions of rough stones, the upper courses of which were of mud-brick, of which the disintegrated remains were readily discernible both in the excavating and in the sections which survive. Evidence of the frescoes suggests they were extensive, running round the sides of a stone pier close to a threshold block in which was preserved the iron seating for the door pivot. Fragments of a finely painted bearded male head, about three-quarters life size, which had slipped from the wall, were removed for safekeeping to a storeroom of the Byzantine Ephorate in Sparta. Work in this area was then deferred until next season to allow full examination of this important building. It is possible that it may be the monastery of Ag. Nikon Metanoeites referred to in his Vita (ed. O. Lampsides in suppl. vol. to Archeion Pontou), where mention is made of a two-storied stoa facing two ways which formed part of the structure. Associated with this phase, in all probability, was a deposit of human bones, consisting of at least seven adult skeletons, placed in a pit cut through the original floor of the Stoa in the apse of RS XII. No grave goods or other finds were associated with the bones, which were covered with a large slab of blue schist. Full excavation of this area was also deferred until next season. The bulk of the pottery and other finds from the deep stratigraphy belongs to the MByz period, and represents a valuable sequence of deposits for the post-R history and occupation of Sparta. Numerous fragments of ancient architec- tural stones were recovered from later walls in which they had been reused, including two Doric capitals and an inscribed block, perhaps from a statue base. The larger of the Doric capitals, finely carved from a single block of marble, has a distinctly archaising appearance, with broadly speading echinus and narrow upper column diameter, although its R workman- ship is indicated by the mouldings below the necking rings. If this capital belonged to the original period of the Stoa, as is possible, it would seem to represent a deliberate attempt to evoke the appearance of a LA predecessor. The inscribed block reads IAQ HAPON in lettering 4 cm high, which appears Hellenistic Greek in style and date. It has been provisionally read as AOPA nAPII2N, (by the Gift of the Parians), and it has been noted that its metre would fit into the second half of a pentameter line. Anathyrosis on the upper surface suggests the inscription block formed part of a longer dedication, perhaps a statue base."</page><page sequence="26">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 27 Ag. Ioannes. Restoration and conservation work was undertaken at the church of the Dormition of the Virgin (ADelt 36 Chr 139). ACHAIA (6th Ephorate) Aigio. Among other HL and R remains (roads, drains, work- shops et al.) excavated in 1981, the 6th Ephorate under I.A. Papapostolou report particularly (ADelt 36 Chr 167-71): On K1. Oikonomou remains of R walls and part of a mosaic pavement; on Aigialeos the caldarium, tepidarium and two other rooms of a R bath complex with well preserved hypocaust and floor. Here HL foundations were preserved at a lower level. To the E parts of another R bath were already known (AR 1987-88,28); both sections are doubtless part of the public bath complex for the city. Tombs are noted: ECh in the grounds of the arms factory (EBO) and 2 C tile graves on the N of the old Athens-Patra highway at the 164km, one of which contained a bronze mirror and a rf lekythos. Ano Soudanaiika: Ag. Konstantinos. A badly damaged small R cist grave was found in 1981 (166). Ano Sychaina. 7 Ch graves without grave goods, 5 tile- covered and 2 stone-built with part of a surround wall were excavated in 1981 (166). Drepano. S of the Panagia Church a G pithos was found in 1981, burial with the opening to the E covered with a rounded sherd. The pithos is decorated with applied bands. This forms part of the EG (early 9th to middle 8th Ct BC) cemetery previously known (ADelt 26 Chr 185). An ECh child's tile grave was also found (166). Kallithea (Laganidia, AR 1988-9, 41). The eighth season of work in 1989 by Th. Papadopoulos for the AS and the University of Ioannina is reported in Ergon 1989, 23-4. Three further ChTs (V-VII) were found in the area of the Tholos. Unfortunately all the chambers had collapsed; more than 30 burials were recorded in all, in layers and swept to the side. In the dromoi were sherds of a variety of vessels (kraters, kylikes, et al.) while the actual burials were accompanied by more than 25 pots of various types (SJ's, amphorai, alabastra, pyxides, cups, ring vases, kernoi, et al.), as well as bronze tools and weapons and a significant number of small objects (beads of glass, faience and agate, sealstones, pins and a single lead ring). From the finds Ts V, VI and VII can be dated to LH II- IIIC. Lack of money prevented the search of the other tombs which almost certainly exist here. Klaus (Koukoura). A second season of work in 1989 by Th. Papadopoulos for the AS and the University of Ioannina is reported in Ergon 1989, 24-5. Two tombs, B and F, of which the latter had fallen in. On the floor lay one primary and three secondary burials with 14 pots and some small objects (beads and conuli). Tomb B was better preserved and contained 17 burials (A-N) of which 9 were in 4 pits in the floor of the tomb (2 covered with slabs). The finds included more than 60 pots and small objects, notably a large two-handled bowl containing five small pots which rested on one of the covering slabs. This rich cemetery also contains more tombs which are in danger of looting and destruction. Kephalobryso. The find of 14 whole and 4 fragmentary Myc vases by clandestine excavators is reported (Nea 7.3.90). Kotroni Sychainon. Part of a R (2nd Ct) tomb enclosure was found in 1981, containing 3 tile graves and 1 built. A tile grave outside the enclosure contained a lamp, a small cup and a jug (166). Krene: Drimaleika. Following the robbing of 2 Myc ChTs with 13 LH IIIB-C vases, E. Papazoglou excavated the sites and cleared a third unrobbed tomb. 4 contemporary burials were found in situ on the floor and against the E wall a group of 13 LH IIIC pots. One burial was accompanied by a silver ring, a bronze sword of NAHE II type, a bronze spearhead, a bronze clip and a small ivory comb. The sword preserved traces of the decorated scabbard. At a lower level were found the remains of 10 further burials which had been swept together and 9 LH IIIA2-B pots (166). Leibartzi. The stone L. Oikonomide mansion (before 1820) was declared a historical monument (ADelt 36 Chr 181). Lousika. The press reports the find of Myc (12th Ct BC) tombs. (Exormese 18.12.89) Mentzena. Clearing and partial excavations at the church of the Dormition (at the 18th km on the Patras-Kalavryta high- way) uncovered the entire original narthex of the Byz basilica made of rough-hewn limestone blocks with mortar. This was contemporary with the original structure which is now much changed. A trench was opened up in the narthex (5x 1.50m) and revealed three graves (fluctuating dimensions: 1.20-1.60m long, 0.35-0.40m wide, 0.40-0.45m deep) facing W to E. The dead had been buried with crossed and bound hands on the chest. Grave 1 provided an silver Ott coin, 2 had no offerings and 3 contained a bronze ring. A coin of William de Ville- hardouin (c. 1250, cf. Schlumberger XII, 10) was found in the NW corer of the trench. Four groups of household ware were also identified (ADelt 36 Chr 181). Mintilogli. Proposals were made to preserve the Metamorpho- sis church, a three-aisled basilica with a three-sided external sanctuary apse - included in it are blocks from an earlier structure (ADelt 36 Chr 181). Patra. The 6th Ephorate under I.A. Papapostolou gives a full and well-organized report (ADelt 36 Chr 157-72) for 1981 of the rescue work in this major R city. Public Buildings: At I. Blachou and Kanare work continued on the large complex, probably baths/nymphaium (AR 1988-9, 41). It seems likely that this is the structure mentioned by Spon and Wheeler in 1676. An earlier rectangular cistern lay to the N of the later apsidal one. In EByz times the area was used as a church and later for burials. Houses: Among others the following are specially noted: On Neophytou in a house of the 2nd-3rd Ct AD, two rooms had mosaic pavements, one with a gladiatorial scene. Two other areas had marble facings and elaborate arrangements for water. A destruction level dated by lamps to the L 2nd/E 3rd Ct AD was found in one room. On Ag. Demetriou sections of another house were adorned with a floor of regular marble slabs surrounded by mosaic and another with a mosaic of the Three Graces.</page><page sequence="27">28 E. B. FRENCH On Cheilonos Patreos further sections of the LR house previously excavated on Niketa (AR 1985-6, 34) included the marble impluvium with the base of an Ionic column at one corer. ER and HL walls were revealed at lower levels. On Niketa remains were more fragmentary but included a row of three Ionic column bases and a marble-lined cistern with rectangular column bases at the corers which had originally been merely mortared. At a lower level HL walls appeared here also. A headless marble statuette of a seated Asklepaios was recovered. At Korinthou-Miaoule and Tsamadou, the work was completed on areas 4 and 5 of Building 1 (AR 1979-80, 35) revealing all the mosaic pavement and the small cistern. Streets: More of the pebble-laid street with large drain was revealed on Niketa (AR 1985-6,34) with a row of bases for brick columns in front of a wall on one side. Here a headless statue of Artemis was found (157). Other sections of roadway can be dated to the 2nd Ct AD (at Asemake Photela and Panachaikou, faced by a building with handsome geometric mosaic pavement), the 3rd-4th (on Charalambe) and a kalder- imi of Turkish times running NS to the Kastro which seems to have remained in use until the introduction of the city plan of Bougaris (1858). Below the stone surface lay a disturbed Myc ChT. Other structures: At Peisistratou-Kalabryton-Demetrako- poulou four independent cisterns of hydraulic cement were uncovered. On Kabakare the remains of pithoi and kilns indicate a workshop as do similar finds on P1. Georgiou. Cemeteries: On Norman the W part of the N cemetery of the anc city lying on either side of a 8m wide road leading SW-NE was excavated. 6 single HL graves of the 2nd Ct BC were cleared. To the 1st Ct AD belong a row of built tombs at a low level, X1,X2 and X6, of which X2, a stone-built exedra, is unique in Patra. The ends of the wings are decorated with bucrania. X1 is decorated in opus reticulatum. Many burnt burials in pottery and lead urns accomapnied by rich grave goods were excavated. By LR the road level had risen enough to cover the facades of the earlier built monuments and rough terrace walls between them supported the roadway. Roitika. At Papagianne 9 an ECh basilica was uncovered. The excavations had originally been conducted by the 6th Prehistoric and Classical Ephorate, but were turned over to the Byzantine Ephorate when a fine mosaic floor was uncovered. Only the E and N parts of the tripartite basilica (12.70x9.50m) were excavated, the remainder being under the road and an adjoining plot. Traces of a synthronos were found, as well as the altar base and the engainio. The walls (0.65m. thick) bore traces of holes for marble revetments while the apse had 3 antae. The mosaic floor was encountered at the E part of the N aisle and had been covered by clay slabs. The mosaic's underlayer was thick and strong. Decoration was framed by a large square with a central circular section within which was a smaller square with four smaller squares adjoining at each of its corers. A wavy band divides the square group from the inner-most circle. Between the square frame and the circle, marine motifs appear (fish, squid, shells and lilies with wave motifs). The mosaic is dated to the late 5th or early 6th Ct and is now in the Ephorate's storerooms at Patra (ADelt 36 Chr 184-85). Phelloi Aigialeias: Seliana. A report was made by A. Moutz- ales on the katholikon of the monastery of the Agioi Apostol- oi. The single-naved, timber-roofed church (originally domed) has a bema apse with a three-sided exterior. Dog-tooth bands run around the outer wall of the apse and parts of the N and S walls. The narthex is contemporary with the main church and communicates with it through three doors (dimensions of church: 12x3.5m). The floor is paved with red baked-clay plaques (side 0.18m) and the templon screen (1730) was decorated in 1743. Wall-paintings are by the well-known Naupliote painter, Demetrios Moschos. The cell complex is located S of the church and consists of ground and upper floor compartments communicating externally through means of an upper outside gallery. Fractures and cracks were intensified by the earthquakes (ADelt 36 Chr 184). Rio. Sections of the fortress were cleared and soil deposits removed, especially at the SW rampart where the entire stepped approach was uncovered. A reservoir was discovered underneath the rampart (ADelt 36 Chr 176). AITOLIA-AKARNANIA (6th Ephorate) Astakos. An impressive neo-classical 18th Ct building (Christos Pharos residence) in the centre of the village was put under a preservation order. Its tripartite facade highlighted by pilasters and antae, and surmounted by 3 pedimental terminals, as well as the interior wall-decoration of cherubs and garlands (said to be the work of an Italian from 1875), attest to the wealth and rising social position of the Greek middle class in the provinces at this time (ADelt 36 Chr 291). Platigiali. The press (notably Kathemerine 22.10.89) has waxed eloquent over the fate of the submerged EH settlement (AR 1988-9, 56 with refs.) and the environment if a plant for chemical waste is built at this site, which lies in another bay some 12 Km S of Astakos itself. Belbina Naupaktias. The rescue excavation in 1981 of a burial enclosure by K. Axiote is reported (ADelt 36 Chr 171). It was 'i' shaped of good masonry, though only the founda- tions and one course of blocks on the E and S remain. Inside were a lobby and two burial chambers. Kato Basilike. (AR 1988-9, 56) Work by A. Paliouras of Ioannina University under the aegis of the AS continued in 1989 (Ergon 1989, 40-3). Excavation was completed on the SW area outside the ECh basilica where the altar of the M Byz church had been found. Other tests were made where surface traces existed: one without finding any structure, the other proving to be a complex with copious C-HL pottery. The excavation of the large pottery kiln by the sea proved most important. The galleries were covered with brick arches every 20cm. Large grills for the pots must have been placed between the galleries and on the two brick outer walls. The field to the N of the kiln shows the vast pits from which the clay had been dug. The lack of pottery nearby suggests exports of the products immediately by sea, perhaps to Patra on the opposite coast. On the lower S slopes of the Ag. Triada hill, again by the sea, there were found many sherds of LC and EHL, not only local but including imports; traces of metal working (not a full metal workshop) were also noted. Mytika: Archontaria Cave. Investigations in 1981, following clandestine excavation in this cave (excavated by E. Mastro- kostas, ADelt 22 Chr 323) produced 9 N sherds (ADelt 36 Chr 172).</page><page sequence="28">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 29 Ag. Sophia. Excavation of the Basilica here in 1984 by P. Vokotopoulos is reported in PAE 129-30. Naupaktos. Work on an extension to the Town Hall uncovered LR ruins in which were two coins of Theophilos (829-842), an important indication that LR structures were still standing during the early 9th Ct, the period when Greece was reincorporated into the administrative and military life of the empire. A LR and ECh cemetery was found on the Ki. Satalne plot to the W (and extra muros) of the city. 14 graves were uncovered, 8 of which were Chr. Most were square with tile or rubble walls. The only burial offering of note found was a pair of fine blue glass-paste bracelets with animal and geomet- ric motifs. The fact that other ECh graves have been found in this area points to it probably having been the town's cem- etery. A trial trench 3xl.10m abutting the wall of the upper fortress N of the church of Profitis Ilias uncovered a floor 1.30m down which proved that ceramic plastic decorative elements (Kufic motifs, dog-toothed cornice bands etc.) originated in a 11th Ct building, probably a church, directly associated with another structure slightly S which was later converted to a bath house (ADelt 36 Chr 293). Papadates-Mataragka Trichonidos. In an area known for burials a HL larnax grave was investigated in 1981. It had been robbed in antiquity but pieces of a bronze pin were recovered (172). Peristeri Trichonidos. A fountain building here was found to have been almost completely destroyed by the village. Other antiquities noted in the area in 1981 include a settlement at Ellenika with walls preserved, and the cemetery (171). Thermos. (AR 1988-9, 56) Excavation by I. Papapostolou for the AS continued in 1989 and is reported in Ergon 1989, 38- 40. The W stoa has now been almost completely cleared. Only the stylobate, the bases of the internal columns and the strong lower section of the W wall (which served also as a terrace wall) were of stone. The nature of the floor cannot be deter- mined. There were 60 outer columns of wood and 40 internal, also wooden. The external walls at the ends projected some 7m in a manner common in W Greece (Cf Kassope, Molykr- eio, Nea Pleurona) but only at the N was there a closed room. At the W and S traces of a built bench were found. Within the area of the W stoa a curved wall earlier than the stoa (Pr-A) and a small later structure were discovered. Work was begun on the larger E stoa. Excavation in 1984 by Th. Papadopoulos is reported in PAE 125-8. Tsougkri Drymona Trichonidos. An acropolis site was identified here (N of Thermos) in 1981, on a steep hill. The one possible approach is guarded by a wall with tower. There are traces inside of a building and outside of the cemetery. Of this, tomb robbers had destroyed 3 cist graves. Work on the site was planned by the Ephorate (171-2). Ithaka. The find of undisturbed tombs of the 2nd Ct AD in the grounds of the Naval Academy is reported. finds included terracotta lamps, coins, a buckle and glass tearbottles. (Rizo- plastes 6.12.89) The start of the reinvestigation by S. Symeonoglou in 1984 is reported in PAE 109-21. The 1989 season (reported in Ergon 1989, 136-7) was devoted to the study of the pottery in the Museum some 60% of which was unpublished. It is largely an important collection of PG and Orientalizing material from the Apollo sanctuary. The products of a local workshop were identified. Kephallenia: Karya. Byz wall-painting was found in the ruined church of Ag. Andreas (Virgin Blachernitissa with archangels and hierarchs in the bema apse.) The paintings have been dated to the late 12th or early 13th Ct and are now in the Argostoli Archaeological Museum (ADelt 36 Chr 177). Kontogennada. Work on the Byz church of Ag. Georgios under the direction of M. Theochari (AS) is reported in Ergon 1989, 138-40. This was concentrated this year on the conserva- tion of the walls and cleaning of the frescoes, and on recording the detail that this revealed. It was feared that damage would ensue from damp and further measures are needed to deal with this problem. Phanies. The ruined church of the Dormition was found to contain Byz wall-paintings, most notably a Virgin and Child in a fiery mandorla depicted as the Burning Bush, a rare Sinaitic theme. Excavation and conservation work has been planned (ADelt 36 Chr 177). Poulata Samis. The church of Ag. Spyridon, one of the finest buildings in the Ionian island style, was intensely studied and its contents recorded as it has been allowed to fall into decay. On the castle of Ag. Georgios, clearing was undertaken and trees removed that had played a role in damaging the walls (ADelt 36 Chr 177). Same. Traces of a workshop and lime kiln are reported (ADelt 36 Chr 172). ELEIA (7th Ephorate) Ag. Triada: Palaiokoukobina. The find of a recently robbed Myc ChT is reported (Ethnos 19.12.89). Chlemoutsi. Removal of soil deposits continued at the fortress in halls A, E, and F. A reservoir was cleared to the E while the original ascending stairway was discovered in front of the same hall. In fortress A, the two-light window was restored, and the fireplace in F secured. The original stone paved way was discovered and restored where damaged between the outer and inner gates (ADelt 36 Chr 176-77). Daphniotissa: Paliokklesi. In 1981 a bulldozer half-destroyed a rectangular built HL tomb from which pottery, a bronze mirror, a gold ring and a gold olive leaf with the inscription IIAAAGA (A. Lazarides in ADelt 36 Chr 151). Anc. Elis. From the Acropolis, W of the church of Ag. Ioannis, part of the base of a marble perirranterion is reported from 1981 (G. Hatzi in ADelt 36 Chr 155) and from E of the building housing the local museum comes an A Doric capital in poros. At Kalybia rescue excavation in 1981 revealed another part of the R cemetery with 5 tile-covered cist graves. At least 3 more appear in the sections. Four are stone built and 1 of tiles. Two re-used pieces of a dedication base were noted. The tombs like others of this cemetery offer little evidence of burial customs and contained few offerings. One vase dates the</page><page sequence="29">30 E. B. FRENCH group (150). Also in this district K. Zachos reports a tumulus, apparently PR (155). The foot of a marble perirranterion was handed in from Paliosukia; other finds from the Elis area are a grave stele with pediment and a handsome R bronze lamp (156). Glarentza. Soil deposits were cleared from the Castle during a campaign to locate the circuit walls, especially to the E where traces are obscure. This was done to establish the archaeological zone in the are prior to planned tourist develop- ment in the neighbouring village (ADelt 36 Chr 185). Kojyri. An unusual sandstone Corinthian capital with human figures uncovered some years earlier was handed in to the Ephorate in 1981 (ADelt 36 Chr 154) (published by E. Papakonstantinou in Et. Eliakon Mel. I, 1982). A seated male figure is identified as Hades flanked by Cerberus and a seated female, Persephone. This is a unique piece and illustrates the statement of Strabo (VI,25,2) about the worship of Hades in this area. Manolada. Rob. and G. Xenos continued conservation work on the church of Palaiopanagia with the reconstruction of the dome (cf. ADelt 35 Chr, 205-8) and initiation of work on the bema apse. The difficult task of restoring the plastic brick decoration was successfully accomplished with every care to recreate the original details. The three-light window on the E face was secured together with the S pilaster respond. The alternating dog-tooth cornice of the outer walls was also restored. Since the E wall was found not to be original, but a later modification, it was secured by means of concrete skirting support to the main structure. The dome tiles were removed, cleaned and replaced after waterproofing of the dome surface. The central three-light window was restored according to extant parallels and a new simple double colonette inserted since the original was not available (ADelt 36 Chr 176). Miraka: Kryabrysi. A rescue excavation in 1981 of a well- cut Myc ChT and four later cist graves (3 covered with conglomerate slabs) is reported by G. Hatzi (ADelt 36 Chr 149-50). This forms the sixth in a series of Myc cemetery sites at Miraka but a settlement has not been identified. On the floor of the dromos were a steatite 'conulus' and sherds, patterned and plain, some of the latter from rounded and carinated kylikes. The lower part of a kyklix was also found in the entrance. In the walls of the dromos on either side were niches blocked with rough stones; with the burial in one was a tall alabastron. A cist with burial remains, partially covered with a slab was found in the dromos floor. The tomb chamber had been robbed except for one cist in the floor containing burial remains and a whole stirrup jar. Further burial remains were found at the E. The later burials were without finds and are thus undatable. Two contained single burials but over the cover slabs of a third were bones and 6 skulls; the fourth was empty, though the cover slabs were still in place. Neochori Kyllenes. The building of a new coastguard station in 1981 destroyed an A burial pithos from which 5 pots have been restored including 2 LCor pyxides (Cor. is rare in the region) and an E Attic lekythos of the Deianara type. Parts of 2 bronze pins and a clay spool were also recovered. Nearby another A pithos burial was excavated containing a small two- handled skyphos; below lay a stand (A. Lazarides in ADelt 36 Chr 150-1). Olympia. The Ephorate lists the chance finds handed in from the district in 1981 with details of their find spots (ADelt 36 Chr 153-4). Notable are: 2 pieces of a bronze Cor helmet and a number of coins. Excavations under the general direction of H. Kyrieleis (German Institute) continued in the area of the Pelopion in summer 1989 It is now certain that the Tumulus was sur- rounded by a closed stone circle (ie. with no entrance) and covered with limestone slabs. The Tumulus can now be dated from the associated pottery to EH II. The apsidal houses IV and V date to EH III. (Fig. 21) Fig. 21 During the excavations it was possible to examine an undisturbed section, the so-called 'Black Level'. The most important finds from here consisted of fragments of at least two large LH IIIC Late or SubMyc kylikes, ribbed stems from vases of the same type and bases from PG vases. Although this pottery was not stratified within the 'Black Level' but mixed with G pottery, it nevertheless demonstrates that there was continuity of cult at Olympia from the LBA. Further excavation took place N of the Prytaneion as part of the project 'Olympia under the Roman Empire' directed by U. Sinn. The dating of the first building phase to the time of Nero remains unchanged. Directly after the first brief period of use, the Pavillion was enlarged for more permanent use; into the centre and surrounded by a square basin was set a large mosaic. In the mid 2nd Ct AD a second alteration occurred during which the intercolumniation of the portico was closed. At some unknown date the N wing was separated from the Pavillion and a number of shallow basins constructed, which were interconnected by pipes and surrounded by a water channel (Fig. 22). Their function is still obscure. Two new inscriptions should be noted: the first on the base of a votive statue mentions the known Daippos of Sicyon, the son and student of Lysippus, the sculptor; the second consists of another fragment from the inscription on the victory statue of an Elian woman named Kasia (IvO 233). The new piece</page><page sequence="30">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 31 Fig. 22 contains the ennumeration of the Olympiads. Kasia was a victor during the the 200th Olympiad (ie. in the year 21 AD). Lithari. (4km E) A bulldozer has revealed 2 Myc ChT's, of which 1 has been fully excavated; 5 burials heaped aside, in a pit and in the dromos, pottery, glass jewelery, bronze rings and bracelets, and a sealstone showing a stag were recovered (Apogeumatini 17.11.89). Phigaleia. K. Tsakos reports (ADelt 36 Chr 154) that IG V,2:425 formerly built into a house has been moved to the Olympia Museum. A considerable number of coin finds are also reported (154-5). Th. Karagiorga-Stathakopoulou as chairman sends a report on the work of the Committee for the Preservation of the Temple of Apollo Epikourios at Bassae. The Committee was set up in 1982 and comprises specialists of all relevant disciplines. The poor stability of the building and the extreme seismicity of the area made necessary the construction of a special scaffold (Fig. 23) to protect particularly the upper section from earthquake damage. To give protection against the weather, which has caused much disfigurement and damage, a temporary covering was deemed necessary, erected in 1987. This consists of a diaphanous fabric which covers the whole building and also allows work for a much longer season than would otherwise be possible. A Faraday lightning conductor has been placed on the roof. For workrooms, three anc. structures to the NW of the temple have been roofed and supplied with electricty and water. The collection of architec- tural blocks has been moved farther from the temple and arranged by categories. Measures needed for the immediate safety of the monument, drainage and fire protection, were completed in 1988-89. The real danger from earthquake, and the necessary conservation to the stone fabric are under study at present.</page><page sequence="31">32 E. B. FRENCH Platanos: Dendroulia. In 1981 during the cutting of a field road sherds dating from MH to LH IIIC were found. Similar material was found on the hill at Dendroulia which is presum- ably a settlement site (ADelt 36 Chr 151). Fig. 23 Samiko: Kleidi. New areas of the PR cemetery, some 180m S of the known tumulus (AR 1966-7,11), were discovered during building work in 1981 and were excavated by E. Papakonstaninou (ADelt 36 Chr 148-9). Tumulus I contained at the N a child's grave without offerings, surrounded by small stones (or in one case part of a large pithos) except for one slab by the head and Ts VIII and IX at the base of the foundations of which the former had not been destroyed and comprised two contracted skeletons without offerings. In the middle of the adjacent Tumulus 3 was the biggest of all the graves, VII, of three huge slabs containing two skel- etons lying on their right sides and two MH III vases. The stratigraphy showed that the deep yellow soil of the tumulus over the graves was overlaid by a heavier sandy soil brought in by water and mixed with a mass of small Myc sherds, mainly from Keftiu (Vaphio) cups. The Tumulus antedated the grave and had originally been the site of pithos burials. Tumulus 2 lay to the S with three graves radiating around a central point. The largest, XI, was similar in structure to VII but had two 'altars' one at either end near which were found 2 Myc pots, a Keftiu cup with a swallow (sic), and an LH II feeding bottle which seems to indicate some form of cult or ancestor reverence. TXI contained 2 skeletons on the floor, other human bones, 3 MH III pots, a stone whetsone and spearhead. TX had only swept-up human bones with 3 MH III pots, a bronze knife with three studs, an obsidian spearhead and a clay whorl, while a group of 5 more heaps of bones and 3 more pots were found at the level of the cover slabs. TIII, which had been damaged along one side by the building operation, was smaller and less well built contained only one contracted skeleton. There were signs that this tumulus too antedated the grave and had contained pithos burials. Between Tumuli 1 and 2, stones, sherds and animal bones indicate the site of a fourth tumulus. Tumulus 5 is the area of the modem threshing floor and the surround of that is the anc. enclosure, a semicircle only as the slope makes further edging unnecessary. It is noted that this burial complex is unique in Elis and surpasses in size those of Triphilia. Trypete: Kastro. (Anc.?Styllangion) A section of a LA terracotta sima from here of Cor type was placed in the collection of the primary school in 1981 (ADelt 36 Chr 154). It dates from ca. 500 BC and illustrates the high quality of the architectural decoration in this area in this period. MESSENIA (7th Ephorate) Aetos: Pousia. A rectangular HL tower with entrance on the S reported in 1981 is illustrated (ADelt 36 Chr 155). Ano Kalo Nero. By the road to this village 200m from the junction with the Pyrgos-Kyparissia road in 1981 a bulldozer destroyed a group of built cist tombs. Bg pottery was col- lected. Other antiquities were noted in the area (A. Lazarides in ADelt 36 Chr 153). Basiliko. (Anc. Dorion) Part of a Ch marble column capital bearing a cross was discovered by the site guard (ADelt 36 Chr 155). Dibari. Near the NW edge of this lake by the road from Petrochori to Boidokoilias deep ploughing in 1981 destroyed a number of tombs (largely open pyres). Adjacent excavation by N. Kaltsas uncovered 14 graves of a HL cemetery presum- ably belonging to Koryphasion. The cemetery compares with others of the immediate vicinity (e.g. Tsopani Rachi (AR 1961- 2,10, 1962-3,19, 1963-4, 11) and Gialoba). The burials included 2 pyres, 3 open burials, 2 urns, 1 damaged pithos and 6 built tombs. The pottery finds from the latter were extensive and overall the range was typical but rich (ADelt 36 Chr 152). Kopanaki. The widening of a road within the village in 1981 brought to light indications of a structure which was then excavated by N. Kaltsas (ADelt 36 Chr 151-2). Three large complete rooms and parts of two others, probably belonging to a house, were cleared. The building was destroyed by fire and dates to the second half of the 6th Ct BC, the first of this date to be excavated in Messenia. Where the destruction levels were reached they gave interesting evidence of daily life and of the structure of the house (clay and beams from the roof). Whether this is a farm or part of a large settlement, and its relation to earlier finds in the region, is as yet unclear. Korone: Portes. The finds from 5 HL tombs discovered in a quarry outside the town were handed over to the Kalamata Museum. They comprised a wide range of pots, as well as metal artifacts. Lepreon: Ag. Demetrios. K. Zachos (ADelt 36 Chr 152-3) reports the continuation in 1981 of his excavations. Surface pottery collection had produced, as well as EH, sherds of MH, LH, C and Byz. The EH structures, stone foundation courses only, lie close to the surface. Fragments of tiles, a hearth rim with impressed decoration and copious pottery were found. The pottery is largely EH II of known types but includes a fruitstand and some pieces presumably EH I. Small finds comprise obsidian and flint blades, bone tools and the head of a ram figurine. N levels with good pottery evidence lay directly on the rock but produced neither stratigraphy nor</page><page sequence="32">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 33 architecture. These can be associated with the FN material of the Attica-Kephala culture. The EH levels had in places been disturbed, notably at one point by later finds of tiles, a glass vessel and 2 Frankish coins. Mauromati. Part of a R marble sarcophagus decorated with bucranium, garland, ears of corn and pine cones has been found, as were part of a marble statue, bronze coins, part of a bronze mirror (AdDelt 36 Chr 155). Messene. (AR 1988-9, 37-40) A well-illustrated article on recent work here appeared in the magazine Takydromos of 3.5.90. The 1989 season (the third of the current work for the AS by P. Themelis) is reported in Ergon 1989, 30-37. An intact statue of Artemis of R date (copy of LC/EHL bronze orginal) was found. Other statues have been found previously here and it is thought that all adorned niches. Among other work, the clearing of a fountain building (with statuary and inscriptions) was started by a colossal stoa in the Agora area. Excavation in the so-called Prytaneion showed that it is in fact an EHL Bath complex. A hoard of 70 HL bronze coins was found and a decree of the Naupaktians in honour of APIXT- IAOX TIMOFENOYX. Work continued in the areas of the Stadium, the Temple of Asklepios, the Sebasteion and Odeion (both now shown to be earlier than the 2nd Ct BC). On one of the columns of the large LR stoa (some 80m in length) is inscribed the name of the priest of Ithomian Zeus, the agoranomos and the hypagoranomos with the date. In the theatre further clearance of the staircase produced a statue of Artemis and other sculptures. A new small shrine was cleared 500m NW of the shrine of Artemis Limnatis, which bears the inscription OHPYAOCENIKAIOIAAC on the krepis. Methone. Substantial restoration and stabilization of the W section of the S wall of the fortress (c.1500 AD) was under- taken by the Ephorate. The Venetian W sea wall, much damaged by the elements, and the last section before the N tower, were likewise reinforced. At the point where this section of the wall meets the south wall of the inner fortress (castel da terra), the foundation course was found and it was decided that a concrete krepidoma should be erected along it (16m long and 5m high) for preservation. Excavations were made in and around the 'pavillion' building which appears in Francesco Grimani's map of c.1700 (deposito per polvere). The S wall and part of the roof have collapsed and the remaining sections are in danger. Original building features (threshold, paved courtyard etc.) were discovered together with a LMed Latin inscription fragment (ADelt 36 Chr 136-7). Schiza Is. Archaeological investigation of the first chamber of the well-known caves produced evidence of PR occupation, notably EH but probably also earlier and certainly later. Petalidi. In 1981 a small marble plaque was found in the Kastro and handed in to the Kalamata Museum with the inscription (IAOMOYXE /XAIPE /ZHIEA ETH/IA. The foundations of a R structure, probably a bath, were uncovered in 1981 at Loutra by the sea (1 km N of the town). A number of important architectural fragments are preserved (ADelt 36 Chr 155-6). Philiatra. A cross-roofed single-aisle church (Orlandos type A3) of the Ascension was reported with fragments of poorly preserved Byz wall-paintings. Three layers of wall-painting were found, the earliest dating to the 13th Ct A fallen frag- ment of wall-painting was taken to the Mystras museum. Construction is of finely wrought large blocks built in the cloisonne manner, with little mortar although changes have frequently been made to the fabric (ADelt 36 Chr 140-1). Psari (Triphylias): Metsiki. The presence of a Myc tholos tomb (7.9m in D) was confirmed, built of the local limestone slabs. One section is preserved to 1m but the superstructure has largely collapsed. Sherds date from Myc and earlier periods. Barelakou. Various damaged tombs (undated) in the area are mentioned (ADelt 36 Chr 156). Raches (Triphylias): Mestou. Sherds of LC and R were collected following tractor ploughing (ADelt 36 Chr 156). Routse, Myrsinochori. For the AS, G. Korres reopened (after 32 years) the excavations of Sp. Marinatos, concentrating in 1989 on the Kalogeropoulou Tumulus and Tholos 1 (Ergon 1989, 26-30). The former proved to have no enclosure wall and a further cist grave with MH material, a burial pithos without offerings and a rectangular deposit for bones contain- ing 4 skulls and some bones were uncovered. Much damage had been done to the site since previous work, which made detailed investigation difficult. Interesting conclusions about the relation of the tumuli to existing EH settlements has emerged. Cleaning of the floor of the Tholos revealed a pit containing a group of metal objects (sword of type A, an unusual wreath, silver fragments, small gold pin, and the handle of a bronze cup). Excavation outside the tholos showed how it was built. 5 new ECh graves of the cemetery already known on the right of the dromos were also found. Strephi: Lykoremata. Clandestine excavation destroyed a slab-covered cist tomb containing apparently 2 skeletons. Pottery, unpainted HL, was recovered. Others tombs are doubtless to be found in the area (ADelt 36 Chr 155). Stoupa (Mani). A. Lazarides reports (ADelt 36 Chr 153) that erosion by the sea has revealed parts of a R structure (walls and part of an unusual pebble mosaic). Trials revealed a further structure. Glass as well as pottery (mainly plain) and tiles were recovered. KERKYRIA &amp; THESPROTIA (8th Ephorate) Kerkyra. The water mills of the island are discussed by A. Sordinas (Anthropos 10). Thesprotia: Titani. Excavations started in 1985 by K. Preka for the 8th Ephorate which includes this area have revealed spectacular finds. From 1987 some 2,500 seals from papyri with unique inscriptions in miniscule as well as mosaic pavements and other finds 'rivalling those of Bergina' are reported (Exormese 6.8.89). BOIOTIA (9th Ephorate) The Ephorate reports work in 1981 in ADelt 36 Chr 186-195. Boeotia Survey. After a two-year break, the Cambridge- Bradford Boeotian Expedition (BSA) took the field again in</page><page sequence="33">34 E. B. FRENCH 1989. The Cambridge party under A.M. Snodgrass had as its goal the completion of the encirclement of anc. Thespiai, by covering the S and E approaches of the city, which had been reached from the N and W, and itself surveyed in detail, in previous years. The results essentially conformed to expecta- tions: a ring of LR farm sites surrounded the then much reduced urban centre at a distance of a few hundred metres, but the only C sites within 1.5kms were those of cemeteries and single graves. The background material was, for the first time, systematically dated as well as quantified. The Bradford party under J.L. Bintliff began work in the Expedition's second or control area, the territory of anc. Hyettos some 25km to the N. Results here conformed to the experience of the preceding seven seasons near Thespiai and Haliartos, save that the C climax was more pronounced and later material scarcer. Part of the operation took the form of a rescue survey of a stretch of land that was about to be bulldozed for open-cast mining: the main feature here was a deserted Med settlement, but extensive BA traces, including probable cist-graves, also came to light. The areas surveyed lay close to the acropolis of Hyettos on the E and N. This operation was itself cut short by the discovery of a remarkable situation on the shores of Lake Ylike, lying between our base and the Hyettos area. Here the waters of the lake, which had risen by some 35m at the time of the draining of the nearby Kopais basin in the 1890's, have fallen steadily in the last few years; by the summer of 1989, they had begun to reveal several of the notable remains on the Klimatari peninsula, jutting into the lake, which had been reported by 19th-century travellers. Not only was the conspicuous Frankish tower again on dry land, but it proved to be associated with a regularly planned contemporary settlement. This in turn overlay substantial C remains, with squared blocks and rock- cut steps, perhaps belonging to a sanctuary. The quality and quantity of the surface material, washed clean by the waters of the lake for nearly a century, was quite exceptional. A short distance away lay the cemetery associated with Med village, and here were also visible the uppermost houses of a settle- ment of E and MBA date. Even this year, the lake level was still some 18 metres above its original, pre-1890 elevation and clearly many more remains still lie under water. The necessarily hurried investigation of this remarkable site was carried out in collaboration with the Ephorate of Antiquities for Boeotia, represented by A. Andreiomenou and A. Christopoulou, by special permission from the Director- General of the Archaeological Service. The material was deposited in Thebes Museum with a view to further study and subsequent joint publication. 1989 may prove to have been the only year for some decades when the site was accessible for study. Ag. Blasios (anc. Panopeus). On the almost inaccessible Acropolis (4th Ct BC) there is a small single-naved chapel of Ag. Blasios. Mortar and plaster cover both masonry and wall- paintings, although a small fragment of the latter appears to be provincial in character. A plaque inscription dated 1647 appears above the main entrance. More work is needed on this monument (ADelt 36 Chr 82). Akraiphia. (AR 1985-6, 40 with refs.) Excavations by the Ephor, A. Andreiomenou, were continued in 1981 (187-8) after a break of 3 years. 138 tombs were cleared, 102 on the W side of the National Highway, and 36 on the E. Though of the types already known, this year the majority belonged to the 6th and 5th Cts BC with fewer of the 4th. Notable were 47 unroofed cists (5th Ct) with a projection at the base of the sides to hold the coffin; the fire was lit under this. Most tombs were unrobbed and contained mainly vases (Corinthian, Attic and Boeotian) and Boeotian figurines as well as bronze and glass jewellery, iron swords, clay plaques, bronze and iron clasps, pins, lamps etc. Some of the very handsome collection of pottery is illustrated. The 1989 excavations by A. Andreiomenou for the AS (reported in Ergon 1989, 44-8) were confined to the left (W) of the road in the area of the football stadium of the town. The first period of work uncovered 64 tombs, mainly A and C; 2 however were stone built tombs of the last quarter of the 9th Ct BC (normally rare in the area) with both pots and bronzes, including a pair of brooches which retained the full play of the pins, one a figure of eight, the other 'double spectacle'. and a decorated bracelet. Among the few 7th Ct BC graves, all urns, one (#125) a giant pithos contained a PCor kotyle and 2 bronze, 2 iron brooches. Burials placed in urns continued throughout the first third of the 6th Ct BC, accompanied by large numbers of vases (#126 by 47 middle Cor pots and #150 by 34 aryballoi and alabastra) many with outstanding decora- tion. As well as vases and figurines, the burials contained rich collections of bronzes. At the beginning of the second quarter of the 6th Ct BC a new type of tomb appears and continues for some 80 years. This is a deep rock-cut pit with 'shelves' part way down to hold the roof slabs; pottery is on occasion found on the roofing. In the 5th Ct BC the pit becomes shallow and there is no roofing, but the coffin rested on the 'shelves' to allow the fire beneath. These are the only tombs with cremation and they are confined to the first half of the 5th Ct BC. The wide range, importance and richness of the offerings in the 6th Ct is emphasized with pottery from Boeotia, Corinth and Attica, Boeotian figurines, bronze ornaments, iron swords, beads, bone and steatite objects et al. In the later tombs, in addition to pottery and Boeotian figur- ines, were burnt pins, organic materials, lamps, strigils, astragaloi and pieces of clay plaque from the decoration of boxes et al. Alalkomenes. The find of many architectural fragments (sections of fluted columns in poros) here (4km N of Koron- eia) in 1981 indicates the presence of a temple site (Ch. Piteros in ADelt 36 Chr 195). Alonnesi Alykes. A Sampson (ADelt 36 Chr 194) reports the identification of an EH II settlement on this small promontory. Bagia. The church of Ag. Nikolaos is single-aisled and timber- roofed (9x5m) with a three-sided apse built on an older structure of similar shape, but with a semi-circlular apse. The cloisonne masonry of the earlier wall, extant up to 1.5m. but mostly buried, indicates a Byz date (alternating clay slabs and stone courses with large re-used blocks) and needs special attention. The Ephorate thus halted planned rebuilding and decided on repair of the existing church with a grant from the Ecclesiastical Council (ADelt 36 Chr, 82). Following the earthquake of 1981 it was discovered that the chapel of Ag. Nikolaos to the NW of the village was built on an ancient structure. At one comer lay a tomb slab with the inscription: ' Aptoo6puax /* Ent /MÂ£c,zapb6 /'Hpcoflr (194). Bathi. The threat to the bay by plans for the new aluminium factory is well described (Bema 4.6.89).</page><page sequence="34">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 35 Delesi. In a plot by the sea a deep layer of pottery and pieces of well-preserved wooden stakes were discovered in 1981. The vases are both utilitarian and of commercial types, plates and transport amphorai. It would appear that the sea level was lower in antiquity. The finds seem to be a deposit dating from the 4th Ct BC to EByz and not from a wreck (193). Gla. Excavations by S. Iakovidis in 1984 are reported in PAE 142. Volume I of the new publication, concerning the excava- tions by Threpsiades, has been published by the AS. Kallithea. Surface remains of ECh and Byz structures are reported as well as HL/R (including a well). This settlement may have a connection with drainage channels on the neigh- bouring hill (ADelt 36 Chr 194). Kapareli. Ch. Koilakou reports that the three-apsed single- naved timber-roofed Ott. church of Ag. Nikolaos contains four Cor column capitals and two double-colonettes (ADelt 36 Chr 81). Kithairona. Remains of a domed-cross monastery church and cells, much damaged by the earthquakes, can be found at at an altitude of 600m and 5km from Plataies (ADelt 36 Chr 81-2). Serious static problems at the monastery church of Osios Meletios were rectified, especially at the vaulting of the cross- arms. Damage to masonry of the chapel of Ag. Paraskeue off the refectory was also repaired (ADelt 36 Chr 77). Koroneia. About 150m S of the Med tower a R inscription was unearthed by a mechanical excavator which was taken to the Chaironeia Museum (ADelt 36 Chr 195). It reads: Xapp- oKp/l ; /rI Â£plt//viq; /Xa/1pa3t/to. A C wall was also uncovered on the W slope which may form part of the W wall of the city. Leibadia: Ag.Triada. Ch. Koilakou reports on the remains of a Med wall, with traces of many step-holes (8x1.70m), possibly a fortification, in the middle of a small plateia above the metropolitan church. The inner side bears traces of the springing of a barrel vault (ADelt 36 Chr 81-2). The small single-naved three-apsed katholikon of the now defunct Taxiarchoi monastery at the large spring of the Potzas river is important for the ancient blocks, mostly funerary stelai, incorporated therein, mostly on the S and E walls. Other spolia from an ancient place of worship can be found in the newer curtain wall along the S side. According to N. Papachatze (AE 1981, 40-41), a R shrine to Herakles was located on this site. Oinophyta. Above the W door of the cemetery church of Ag. Paraskeue is a R white marble sculpture, a male figure in himation (ADelt 36 Chr 195). Plataies. Built into the church of Ag. Nikolaos which was destroyed by the earthquake was a block with a Ch inscription on 2 faces: a.

(GAC G39) Surface finds of EH I, II and LN are reported as well as stone implements (ADelt 36 Chr 194). Outside Plataies left of the road to Kapareli is a two-domed church of Ag. Athanasios built with mostly ancient blocks. After the earthquakes of 1981, the fallen moder wall-paint- ings revealed an earlier, possibly Byz, layer beneath (ADelt 36 Chr 81). Skourta Plain project. The fourth and final season of the survey of the Skourta plain was conducted in 1989 by M. and M.L.Z. Munn (ASCS). "Explorations begun in 1985 and 1987 were extended into new parts of the plain and surrounding valleys, so that by now a representative portion (approximately 25%) of most of the inhabitable areas of the three koinotites of Pyli, Skourta, and Stefani have been examined intensively. 66 sites were discovered or studied for the first time in the course of this highly productive season, yielding a total of 120 pre- modem sites studied by our survey since 1985. The survey should have identified all major settlement sites (over 5 ha) and a representative sample of smaller sites in the study area. A summary of the chief conclusions to be drawn from the four seasons can be made. The EN era sees settlements dispersed throughout the area, on magoulas within the plain itself and on hilltop sites around the plain (A10, B6, B10, B14, B21, B33, B50, B60, B63, Ci). After an interval in which only one MN site is certain (A8), many of the same sites and still more hilltops around the plain are occupied in the L and FN eras (A10, All, A25, A50, B6, B19, B20, B25, B33, B47, B50, B50, B54, B63, J6). EH I pottery is found on several of these sites, but one of our more remarkable findings is the absence of clear EH II-III material on any sites in the area of the Skourta plain. Only at Daphnoula (A50), on the banks of the Asopos river, well N of and below the plain, have EH II forms such as sauceboats and urfiris wares been found. The settlement void in this upland area during a period which sees important developments in adjacent lowlands parallels a void in the later G and A periods. Preliminary indications suggest no environmental explanation - the landscape has been remarkably stable - so cultural factors must be responsible. As with the later settlement void, the absence of EH II habitation sites is probably due to the influences of developing regional states in Attica and Boeotia, where population was concentrated in dominant political and economic centers. MH settlement is established on two summits overlooking the plain (Al, A10), one of which, Panakton (Al), becomes the most substantial LH site in the area. A fortified MH settlement is also established on a peak in rugged country beyond the NE edge of the plain (J1), between the Mazareika and Vountima valleys, in which other settlements are estab- lished in the LH era (B21, J2 also B33 in the Tsoukrati valley). The remoteness of this NE sector, and the great natural strength of the MH site and a nearby LH IIIC citadel (J2), suggest that the inhabitants of these glens and crags sought to protect and separate themselves from peoples beyond the peaks that surrounded them, perhaps because they were ethnically distinct and economically more or less independent of the Myc Greeks who dominated the plains. Traditions of Pelasgians in these mountains at the end of the BA raise the possibility that these may have been Pelasgian sites. Once abandoned, in the LH IIIC or PG eras, most of these sites in the NE sector are not again inhabited for well over a millennium. Elsewhere, within the more accessible expanse of the Skourta plain itself, LH settlements are established on many sites which are later again important in the C era (Al, B4, B7, Bll, B18, C17, cf. A50, C3).</page><page sequence="35">36 E. B. FRENCH A substantial PG settlement at Panakton and a small amount of PG material at a handful of other sites (A2, B10, B33) mark the end of habitation in the area of the Skourta plain for four centuries. Only in the Kokkini valley to the S is there continu- ous habitation from the G through A eras (C3). This absence of habitation corresponds to the formative period of the C poleis of Athens and Thebes. The centralization of political power and economic activity in these poleis and their satellite communities in Attica and Boeotia left a settlement void in the mountainous boundary between them. The area was by no means unused, however, for literary evidence attests that these mountains, and the area around Panakton in particular, were common grazing land. The remarkable concentration of Cor, G and A pottery found at the peak sanctuary to Zeus on the summit of Pares (remarkable by contrast to the scarcity of such material at the contemporary peak sanctuary on Hymet- tos), as well as similar material found at the cave of Antiope on Kithairon near Eleutherai (both sites outside our survey area), suggests that shepherds from the Corinthia, along with Boeotians and Athenians, made regular use of this communal upland pasturage. In the later 6th and early 5th Cts BC, the re- establishment of settlements in the Skourta plain at Panakton (Al), Stefani (C17), and Ayios Dimitrios (B18) represent Athenian encroachment upon this common pasture land. Likewise, the Athenian deme at Oinoe and the absorption of Eleutherai into Attica are part of a process of Athenian aggrandizement resented by the Thebans, and probably by their Corinthian allies of the Peloponnesian War era. Fig. 24 The fortress at Panakton secured the Athenian presence in this area. Destroyed during the Peloponnesian War, it was rebuilt before the middle of the 4th Ct, and became a regular ephebic garrison post (attested by the inscription found there in 1988). By the second half of the 4th Ct individual farmstead sites were being established in great numbers around the outside the plain (A14, A15, A28, A33, B2, B3, B4, B9, Bl1, B20, B22, B23, B26, B31, B32, B34, B36, B38-43, B51, B53, C1, C7, C11, C15, C18, C25, C26). This phenomenon reached its height at the turn of the 4th to the 3rd Cts BC, a time when Thebes had been reduced to comparative insignificance. Athens, meanwhile, though fallen in power abroad, was successfully dominating this hinterland. The course of the HL era sees a shift in the settlement pattern. Most of the small sites established in the 4th-3rd Cts do not outlast the 3rd Ct. Panakton itself seems to be aban- doned around the turn of the 3rd to the 2nd Ct BC. The boom in Athenian economic interests in this area was apparently comparatively short-lived. In turn, a series of small hamlets along the N edge of the plain are inhabitated from the 2nd Ct BC into the R imperial era (B10, B20, B25, B30, B38, B49, B60). It seems likely that Tanagra, whose prosperity during this period is attested, exploited this hinterland after Athens. The LR era of the 4th-6th Cts AD sees a renewed interest in settlement in this area. Sites inhabited since the later HL era continue to be occupied while new sites (individual farmsteads or small hamlets) spread over the rest of the area (All, A14, A18, A36, B7, Bll, B18, B21, B24, B34, 37, B44, B46, B57, B62, C1, C3, C17). The areas of Eleutherai and Oinoe are known to thrive also in this era, after having been abandoned for some centuries. This prosperity comes to an end within the second half of the 6th Ct AD, probably in connection with the Slavic invasions. Nothing is known of settlement in the area for at least three centuries. A single coin of Leo VI found near Skourta (B40) suggests some habitation by the end of the 9th Ct, but datable pottery does not become abundant until the later 11th Ct. By this time the monastery of Hosios Meletios was established on Kithairon, and the well known influence of this monk and his followers in this underpopulated part of Attica is archaeologically attested in our area. MByz sites are dispersed throughout the area. All are associated with chapels, and many if not all of them are likely to have been among the many dependencies of the monastery of Meletios (A20, A30, A42, Bll, B20, B21, B30, B40, B49, C17). Settlements of the MByz era all continue into the era of Frankish domination, during which period many new settlements are established (Al, A4, All, A12, A16, A29, B10, B31, C3). Frankish towers at Pyli (A12) and at Panakton (Al) attest the interests of powerful lords in the arable land of the plain, and probably in the protection of the direct route between Thebes and Athens which ran across it. It was at this time, possibly under the Catalan Duchy of Athens of the 14th Ct, that the Albanian population was first introduced to the area. Numerous sites are known to have been occupied in the course of the three and a half centuries of Turkish domination, but the numbers alone do not imply continuous prosperity or growth in population. As much as 50% of the sites occupied in the Frankish era were abandoned either at the beginning or within the first half of the Turkish era. At least 25% of the sites founded in the Turkish era were occupied for no more than a few generations before being abandoned (A24, A27, A34, B23, B25, B35, C9, C16, and the villages of Ayios Vasileios B57 and Kapsospiti B13 in the hinterland of Skour- ta). Three of the five modem villages (Stefani, Prasino, Panakto) were first founded, or were relocated, towards the end of the Turkish era. The population at any given time, therefore, was probably never significantly more than in other eras where a moderate number of sites is attested, and probably never as much as it was at the height of the C-EHL boom. The total population of the five modem villages of the plain in the late 19th Ct is recorded at just under 1200, and this figure may provide a notional estimate for the number of people who lived in the area at the peak of EHL prosperity. At the present day close to 3000 people claim one of the villages of the plain as their home (though many make their livelihoods elsewhere)." Tanagra. (AR 1977-78, 36; 1984-5,30) The press reports lectures by A. Andreiomenou on her excavations of rich A</page><page sequence="36">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 37 tombs and a vast votive deposit of vases and figurines appar- ently (from graffiti) from a shrine of Herakles. The tombs show relations with Corinth and Attica as well as local pottery and figurine production. Some of the A figurines are of new types and many preserve their polychrome painted decoration. Metal objects were not as plentiful as at Akraiphia. As the tombs were single burials but contained large numbers of pots (310 in one) the importance of the finds for comparative chronology is great. Fig. 26 The figurines of the 5th Ct are of typical well-known types: the seated goddess, animals, birds and above all a naked youth standing on a base (a type which characterises the third quarter of the 5th Ct in Boeotia) and the draped kore. As well as vases and figurines, some A tombs produced small finds: paste beads (monochrome or 'eye'), a few bronze ^B^^^ _ ^^^^l~~ ~oornaments etc. Some male burials included an iron knife or sword. Fig. 25 Dr Andreiomenou kindly sends a report on the continuation of work in this area in January 1989. "135 new tombs came to light, most of which had been pillaged at the end of the last century for their 'Tanagra' figurines. These were large cist ; tombs of poros blocks (Fig. 24). The unpillaged tombs were simple graves of the 6th and 5th Cts BC and some children's .- :. . " lamakes and urns, all rich in offerings. The oldest date back to :: i!,;â the beginning of the 6th Ct and contained many MCor vases, a few Boeotian bg and a very few Attic bf, e.g. a bowl of the Polos painter of 580 BC. The Cor pots were mainly spherical aryballoi with rich and varied decoration: a row of hoplites with shields in various types, lotuses in a cross shape, anti- thetic lions or lions facing other animals, sphinxes, sirens, birds (Fig. 25), rams, bulls etc. There was also a series of aryballoi with antithetic horses and some with human figures and comasts. Two bore mythical scenes and are very close to the work of the Boar Hunt Painter (Fig. 26). The tombs of the 6th Ct, apart from the many bg vases from local workshops, included painted Boeotian pots of various ; types such as the typical bird kylikes, skyphoi with schematic plant designs, Boeotian bowls etc. The A figurines from Tanagra are from a local workshop, of first class workmanship, well-baked and therefore unliable to crumble. The majority are plank-like women with mouse or bird faces (Fig. 27) and horse and rider figures (Fig. 28) with occasional representations of colts (Fig. 29). Those from the first thirty years of the 6th Ct are often bg or linear, but we have a series of horse/rider groups with polychrome paint beautifully preserved. The plank figurines of the last thirty years of the century have fully modelled features, and wear a high polos; the polychrome Fig. 27 painting is very well preserved.</page><page sequence="37">38 E. B. FRENCH The tombs of the last thirty years of the 5th and the first thirty years of the 4th Cts produced very many Boeotian kylikes with floral designs or shadow figures (Fig. 30), and many pyxides decorated in the same way. There were also figurines (see above) but also small finds: bronzes, folding mirrors, cosmetic implements, strigils etc. Finally there were clay plaques with rosettes and floral patterns which would have decorated chests which have decayed away. In all this last season of excavation has produced over 1,000 vases and figurines and many small objects which will enrich the museum collections of the Ephoria and which will throw light on several problems of Boeotian chronology." Excavations in 1984 by Th. Spyropoulos are reported in PAE 143-5. Fig. 28 Thebes: The possible areas of the Palace are concisely discussed by K. Demakopoulou (Ep. tes Et. Boiotikon Meleton I 1, 1988) Some of the many rescue excavations within the town in 1981 are reported by the Epimeletes B. Aravantinos, K. Piteros and A. Sampson (ADelt 36 Chr 188-193). For convenience the catalogue number in Symeonoglou, The Topography of Thebes is given where possible. On Dirkes adjacent to the rich plot previously investigated (#166 AR 1978-9, 23) only a small portion of the area remained unlevelled but produced evidence of destruction possibly by earthquake and followed by fire. In a cavity in the floor lay an important group of fallen pottery, LH I in date of 'Mainland' and Cycladic Polychrome ware (? the first such find in Central Greece) and two utilitarian vessels (unfortunately not illustrated). In a bothros amid ash and animal bone with EH and MH sherds was part of a 'frying pan'. At Amphionos and Oidipodos a typical range of strata were revealed: at the base a rich MH level containing Minyan ware, bone tools, obsidian and flint blades and flakes and stone tools or projectiles; above this in one area the Myc destruction level and in another wall fragments of LH IIIB; an adult burial accompanied by an iron pin and a pair of thin bronze earrings is dated to SubMyc but forms part of the cemetery by the E tower of the Electra Gate excavated by Keramopoullos and others (#7). Fig. 29 At Oidipodos and Kaloktenous on the S of the central Plateia, the finds were all Byz including a large storage pithos and a deep well partly rockcut and partly built. The pottery too was mainly Byz (including much utilitarian ware) but with some Myc admixture. On Antigones the expected Myc levels had been destroyed by later construction and tombs. Notable was a 6th Ct AD pebble pavement with floral design in light and dark. This too had been disturbed by later tombs, Crusader and Frankish. On the rock lay an EH hearth of unbaked clay with a foliate rim. Just off Iokastes and c. 60-70m S of the Proitides Gate (#9) sections of the Frankish, HL (4th-3rd Ct BC) and Myc city walls were discovered. Notably the Myc does not rest directly on the rock. Slightly further S undisturbed EH II-III-MH levels were found. Two MH graves were found: a cist with adult and small child in crouch position and without offerings and one enclosed by bricks, again without offerings but containing a collection of bones. In another nearby plot no sign of the city walls appeared but part of a R building was cleared amid wash of all periods of the occupation of the city. At the E end of Oidipodos by the supposed Omoloides Gate investigation followed illegal excavation by the owner. A small Byz church was half destroyed but was to be excavated by the Byzantine authorities. Below R remains, at a depth of 6m Myc levels in good condition were reached. On a roadway, partly paved, which ran between two structures, there lay a thick destruction level including many Myc roof tiles (cover and pan) and varied domestic pottery. The adjacent building II bore heavy signs of the destructive burning particularly to the walls; Room Gamma contained a bath built into the floor, much pottery, a stone mould with rosette, and a variety of stone implements; Room Delta contained many small stirrup jars, 18 conuli, a bronze double axe, a bronze knife, ivories and burnt grain. Both these rooms would seem to be workshops. The destruction is dated to the end of LH IIIB2. The excavation was not completed in 1981. By Plat. Ag. Ioannes, 3 trenches revealed, below post-Byz levels, Byz walls, a much relaid roadway and part of the Byz city's drainage system. Burning in one area suggests a kiln.</page><page sequence="38">ARCHAEOLOGY, IN GREECE 1989-90 39 Fig. 30 Below in one trench lay an undisturbed but mixed LH/MH level. N of the Museum at the edge of the scarp the find of large rectangular limestone blocks seems to indicate the Myc city wall, possibly in situ, possibly fallen. Two Myc strata are apparent and the wall does not rest on the rock. The slope makes excavation here very difficult and detailed dating was not possible. The Ephorate decided against the demolition of the small single-naved timber-roofed church of Agia Triada W of the Dirkis rivulet, due to the important archaeological nature of the area. Some spolia are included in the bema window and scattered in the grounds. The church is the starting point for Vlach wedding processions, an important Theban custom (ADelt 36 Chr 82). Thespies. Part of the anc. cemetery was excavated by the Ephor, A. Andreiomenou, in 1981 c. 1600m S of the modem village (ADelt 36 Chr 186-7). On the W were 5 rectangular A tombs. Only #2, a child's grave, was unrobbed; this contained a rich assortment of offerings mainly C pyxides, figurines including a two-horse chariot with two colourful female occupants, bronze jewellery and 5 large iron nails presumably from a coffin. Also A was the burial ur of a young man, #10 at the E. The other 9 burials lay in two groups and date from the end of the 4th Ct BC. Only #11, 12, and 13 had escaped robbing; from these came bg and plain pottery, W. Slope ware, tear bottles with spherical bodies, 2 figurines, a lamp and other items. Toumpi. This important N site (identified by D. French) is reported in detail by A. Sampson (ADelt 36 Chr 194). Ylike: Boubali. On the N shore of the lake R tombs and, on the nearby slope, traces of a HL settlement appeared, until recently covered by the water. An oil press was found. At Syngena there appeared remains of an extensive C and HL settlement. Both settlements were agricultural, exploiting the valley which became a lake after the drainage of L. Copais in the last century (and is now a reservoir for Athens) (ADelt 36 Chr 194). Zaltsa. The remains of anc. Boulis have been identified on a height 2km from here, above the Corinthian gulf. The area only recently approachable by road accords exactly with the description of Pausanias (X, 37). Traces of a wall were noted on the top and habitation on the S slope. EH, MH, C and HL pottery was identified. The site of a temple is suggested (ADelt 36 Chr 193-4). PHOKIS (10th Ephorate) The 10th Ephorate report their work in 1981 in ADelt 36 Chr 231-6. Amphissa. In a plot adjacent to one where an ECh mosaic pavement had been excavated in 1969 (ADelt 24 Chr 215) test excavation in 1981 revealed part of a structure of the same period and at a lower level a preR building. Of interest is the stamp on a tile built into the former: AK KE IB A. Small finds and sherds of all periods were plentiful, particularly R and LR but preceded by G, Cor, C and HL. Finds from other areas of the town included a series of structures of R to ECh of which the last had a mosaic pavement, and R walls using material from the city walls. Nearby in another wall (probably LHL/ER) was a block with the inscription [...]Z-IONO[...] (232-4). Antikyra. The find in 1981 is reported of 3 burials with collected bones over them. A bronze ring and a bronze brooch were found in the fill. Associated sherds are LR but it is suggested that these are ECh burials, connected with the site at Palatia (235). The French School survey in 1989 comments on the density of later sites in this region (as compared with the Desfina peninsula to the W). Above Aspra Spitia and near the aluminium plant, farmsteads were identified. A. Kourenta-Raptake reports the finding of ECh remains: an ECh basilica on the D. Argyre plot with a mosaic floor in the nave, now taken to the Delphi museum for conservation. On the D. Sampane plot rescue excavations brought to light the upper levels and walls of an ECh settlement. Large blocks</page><page sequence="39">40 E. B. FRENCH from an HL structure were re-used in its construction. Moder destruction hindered the identification of the buildings' use. H and PR levels were found underneath, on which the 10th Ephorate of PR and C Antiquities at Delphi will report. On the A. Maurochalibide plot, a LR house with 8 rooms was uncovered. Ancient material had been reused in its construc- tion, especially in its antae and lower wall courses. Evidence of frequent repairs is also apparent. Parts of unfluted columns were found, bronze coins of the 4th Ct AD, part of a funerary stele inscription and a relief table-stand depicting Leda and the Swan; work continues (ADelt 36 Chr 80,83). Four trenches were cut into the sides of the drainage ditch, 3 on the N, 1 on the S. The surface had been much desturbed by deep ploughing but luckily was mainly dump from earlier work; below this was an undisturbed MH level overlying a level of exceptional burnt destruction. Some architectural evidence could be recorded. Wall 16 was of unusual width and was founded on a built ossuary, similar to an MH cist tomb (see K. Romaios, Ep. tes Et. Boiotikon Mel. I (1988) 347-54). Other walls were recorded in the same level in the sides of the drainage ditch. There is thus strong evidence of a flourishing MH settlement on the S and E sides of the mound at least. Chrisso: Ag. Barbara. A stretch of Lesbian masonry with many traces of anc. building is reported from 1981 (232). In the French School's survey project in 1989, exploration of the valley of the Pleistos produced several new traces of anc. occupation including an olive press at Ag. Paraskeue. Fig. 31 Bralos: Palaiochori. Survey was carried out in 1989 by D. Rousset (French School). The site is identified by two inscribed blocks bearing 3 honorifics of Kytenion. A square tower (Fig. 31) is preserved on the hill and is the source of spolia in the village. Four funerary inscriptions are recorded: Atov Kkeay6pa; EE...TAZ; " icKvo;; AyÂ§6- aupo; yr\yES. Aapo()tvrS;; (Figs 32, 33). Fig. 32 Chaironeia: Toumpa Balomenou. Excavation was restarted by Ch. Tzabella-Evjen for the AS in 1989 (Ergon 1989, 49-52) following the destruction of walls at a depth of 1-1.7m, some 9m S of Soterides during excavations for the cutting of a drainage ditch. Fig. 33 Delphi. From 1981 are reported 6 Chr tombs, tile-covered, which form part of the W cemetery of the anc. city (231-2). Damage to the stadium by modem presentations is noted (Bema 18.2.90). In 1989 the French School began a study of the territory of Delphi's neighbours and of the Amphictionic League with a view to making an accurate topographic record of past finds and fast disappearing material. To the W two towers were found at Tritaia: Elleniko and near Ag. Euthymia which cannot have been border guardposts, and one at Semiakaki: Panagia (Fig. 34) which may have been. A habitation site was identi- fied near Ag. Konstantinos.</page><page sequence="40">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 41 Distomo. (Anc. Ambrossos) Excavation by the Ephorate on two sites in 1981 is reported (234-5). On the SE slopes of the acropolis a bath complex of the 1st Ct BC/lst Ct AD with hypocaust systems preserved in two area was cleared. The N entrance to the central area had remained in use until the destruction of the building in the 3rd/4th Ct AD. Beneath lay part of the 3rd/4th Ct BC city wall, some 2.25m wide. On the W an area with many surface traces, which was wanted for development by the OTE, was investigated. Surface pottery included material from G to LR. Excavation which revealed an extensive ECh complex was handed over to the Byzantine Ephorate. of the site. At Magoula thick MH strata were revealed immediately below surface levels (ADelt 36 Chr 235). Medeon: Ag. Theodoroi. An area near tombs previously explored to N and NE of the acropolis was cleared in 1981 for fear of grave robbing. Two disturbed tombs without finds were found (235). Pyra: Kommatakia. A well-built tomb with two chambers identified in 1981 is described. Bones were found and in the W chamber 1 skull, 3 in the E. From the pottery and a silver obol of Sikyon, it appears that the tomb was in use throughout the 4th Ct BC (236). Strouza. (Anc.

Kalligas for the Ephorate reports on the difficulties of 1981, for the island suffered badly from heavy rains as well as the earthquakes (ADelt 36 Chr 197-202). In spite of this 43 rescue excavations were undertaken and 108 building operations supervised. Amarynthos. E. Sapouna-Sakellaraki has excavated on this important site in 1989 with finds which included many votive figurines of wide ranging types dating from A to ER times. Items of glass, bronze and lead are also reported. The area was occupied continuously from EH to LByz (Passim 31.10.89). From 1981 various traces of anc structures are reported in the area as well as some EByz tombs (202). K. Skarmoutsos reports the finding of LR-EChr remains in the town (Barabouti plot): foundations of a semi-circular apse destroyed at the middle of the curve, decorated marble templon fragments (foliate motifs) and a threshold, all possibly part of a basilica; also a rubble wall without mortar and very little use of ceramic inclusions. Four types of grave were also found: (a) tile-lined rectangular graves made with firm stucco walls and covered with large plaques; only limited bones, sherds and three human skulls were found; (b) tile graves covered by large (0.76x0.42cm) tiles with LR sherds, coloured glass fragments, bones and ash; (c) long tile graves of human size covered with narrower tiles, in one of which was found a complete human skeleton; (d) children's graves in the natural</page><page sequence="41">42 E.

At Ag. Andreas 4 C tombs were found (202). Chalkis. From 1981 the following are reported (198-9): On Meg. Alexandrou remains of private LHL houses were found with walls of largely reused material; coarse pottery and a few whole lamps and tear-bottles were recovered. Further remains of the same complex were found on an adjacent site as well as part of the city drainage system. On the lower slope of Ag. Photeine were found PG tombs and a LR burial ur of Gaza type (5-6th Ct AD) with the bones of a child. On Kato Panionion (OT 389) 2 parallel HL walls resting on rock were uncovered. In OT 393 was another HL wall and at a higher level part of a R structure of large poros blocks, proably a public building of the harbour installations (known at Ag. Stefanos). Another R wall was revealed on Kiapekou (Kamares district). In the same district a thick level of HL pottery accompanied part of a house wall and of a street. On this was founded a vast R structure, probably two-storeyed; the destruc- tion level contained many animals bones and shells, doubtless from a kitchen. At Gyphtika, in the grounds of the 10-llth Demotikon Scholeion, excavation continued of a rock-cut refuse pit (lying near the entrance to a R structure) to a depth of 4m without reaching the base; pottery of 3rd-2nd Ct BC (including West Slope ware) was recovered. On Rodopes a plot adjacent to the R pottery workshop (AR 1985-6, 20) was investigated; the workshop extended across the plot to the W where it was bounded by the anc. road. An open terracotta water channel led to a small square tank, proably for working the clay. A road and small kiln of R date were uncovered. The whole area was filled with the debris of the workshop. On Aliberiou (OT 394), on a plot where in 1953 an inscribed tripod base had been found, further (slight) building work was carefully monitored; a small section of LR wall, coarse pottery and fragments of a marble pilaster capital were found. Else- where on the same street part of a R house was cleared; finds included the lower part of a female statuette. Immediately over the rock lay a thin (10cm) G level. On Artemisiou and Plagarakiou 2 LR graves were uncovered, one destroyed, one containing an unpainted trefoil-lipped jug. Work was carried out in 2 extensive areas of the city's cemeteries, near the N shore (HL) and on Bataria hill (HL &amp; R). E. Manolessou reports restoration work on the church of Ag. Paraskeue (ADelt 36 Chr 78). N. Papadakes publishes 'Inscriptions from Chalkis' in Archeion Euboikon Meleton 27 (1986-7), Eretria. The Swiss School has held an exhibition in the new gallery of the Museum under the title 'Eretria: 25 years of Swiss archaeological excavation in Greece'. Evidence from this exhibition is used by N. Xenios in a article interpreting the architecture in Archaiologia 33. Plans for a new road in the area have however caused some disquiet (Nea 1.11.89). K. Reber for the Swiss School reports on excavation in 1989. "Work was concentrated on House IV (built E 4th Ct BC and destroyed L 3rd) where problems of its entry were solved and the E sector cleared. The function of the various rooms of this sector is not certain (the W is a standard house) but the presence of several drainage systems and paved floors suggest a workshop or industrial area. Among finds are 34 coins, relief vessels (notably a krater with the head of a satyr (Fig. 37) and a votive inscription to Arsinoe Philadelphos, which indicates a speedy spread of the cult after her death." Swiss work 1985-88 is summarized with an excellent site plan in Antike Kunst 32(1989) pt 2. Fig. 37 P. Kalligas had published an account of work in the town in 1981 (AE 1983, 106-36; (AR 1985-6, 20-1) but ADelt 36 Chr 200-201) adds: in OT 727 two HL walls with much pottery (4th Ct to LHL); in OT 141 part of a HL house with a badly damaged mosaic floor; in OT 98 (continuation of previous work) part of a HL house and a new section of the big stone- built drain. A LG wall was found at a lower level at the W of the plot. The head of a 5th Ct BC female terracotta figure was recovered. In OT 812 as well as another HL building and a further section of anc. roadway with considerable pottery of the usual types, the find of a number of broken terracotta figurines and the moulds for figurines and figures make it likely that a workshop lay in this region. Just N of the Temple of Apollo Daphnephoros (OT 663) lay further HL house remains and a group of 8 burials of the 1st half of the 5th Ct BC. 4 were in stone sarcophagi, the rest in cists of slabs or tiles. The contents were extremely rich and varied: pottery (lekythoi, pyxides, alabastra), terrracotta figurines, jewellery including a very fine gold pendant showing a lion attacking a deer. In OT 814 in the stream bed to the N and SW of the Museum 4 tombs were investigated: 2 HL (one containing a gold headband), 1 R and 1 undatable. A another robbed HL cist was found nearby. In the E cemetery 2LR tile-covered graves were found. The excavations by P. Themelis (AS) in 1984 are reported in PAE for that year. Chalioteika. Architectural blocks in limestone and marble were found in 1981 in an uninhabited house (201). Magoula. In 1981 a number of anc. architectural blocks were placed in the forecourt of the church of Agioi Theodoroi (201). Malakontas. In 1981 a 5th Ct BC cist grave containing 3 wgr lekythoi and an iron strigil was found. A PR site was</page><page sequence="42">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 43 identified at Plakakia together with traces of a HL farmstead (201). Mamoula (Kallithea). A rich HL cist tomb was found in 1981 containing 39 gold leaves from a wreath, a silver pin with a bird head, bronze pins and brooches, iron objects, 7 tear-bottles and other pottery. A destroyed HL tomb was excavated near the chapel of Ag. Ioannes (201-2). Glypha. Protests by the Et.Eub.Mel. at the proposal to site a chemical factory in this bay are reported (Kathemerine 12.9.89). Karystia. The primary objectives of the Canadian team under D. Keller and M. Wallace in 1989 were "to continue the study of the artifacts and recorded information resulting from the excavations and survey work on the Paximadi peninsula and to begin a new survey phase to locate and record ancient roads and land routes N and E of the peninsula. The pre-moder land route survey, which is intended to aid understanding of the history of communications between the Paximadi sites, anc. Karystos and the remaining area of the Karystia, began by following the mule-trails shown on 1:5000 topographical maps. All trails covered by foot were described and colour coded on a field map. Find spots which were discovered on or near the trails were recorded, but large tracts of land were not intensively covered as in the earlier Paximadi intensive survey. Although it had been planned to begin this first stage of the three-year effort NW of the Paximadi peninsula, logistical and environmental factors caused the initiation of the project by working eastward toward Platan- istos. The survey teams recorded 35 new find spots. These find spots have not been analyzed yet, but initial field records indicate that at least half of them will prove to be ancient sites. Among these newly discovered sites are: a R marble quarry, two C round towers, at least four N habitation sites, and a number of HL and R agricultural/habitation sites. An important road identification was one 30m section of paved road, quite possible R, along the mule trail leading from Karustos to the ancient port of Geristos (modem Kastri)." Karystos. E. Manolessou reports restoration work on the Bourtzi monument (ADelt 36 Chr 78). Plakare. Traces of anc. structures are reported (202) which seem to be part of a small temple, altar etc. PR finds are noted from the S slope of the hill (D. Keller of the ASCS). Lefkandi. In 1981 in addition to the regular Greek-British excavation (AR 1981-2,15-7) P. Kalligas (ADelt 36 Chr 200) reports the find of 2 PG graves and a possible refuse pit with PG pottery (199-200). Manika. E. Sapouna-Sakellaraki describes 'New tombs at Manika' in Archeion Euboikon Meleton 27(1986-7), while A. Sampson reports on his work in the EH cemetery in Anthropos 10. Panagitsa Chalkidas. A HL tomb is reported Skyros. N. Delinokolas reports excellent consolidational work by G. Parakate to secure dangerously eroded sections of the walls and surface area above the monastery of Ag. Georgios (ADelt 36 Chr 78). Conservation work on the wall-paintings of the church of Panagia Kastrou was begun (ADelt 36 Chr 81). Phylla. E. Manolessou reports restoration work on the Miaouli residence (ADelt 36 Chr 78). NORTHWEST GREECE (12th Ephorate) Work in 1981 is reported in ADelt 36 Chr 271-81. Ammotopos. Excavation (1981) and conservation work was carried out in House A by Ioannina University and the German Institute (278). Ariste Zagoriou. At the site of Papoules an attempt at an illegal excavation was reported in October 1981. Official excavations revealed a cist tomb covered with stone slabs, while the skeleton lay on a stone slab floor; the pottery was of a PR date (273). Arta. P. Chrysostomou and P. Papangele report on rescue excavations during 1981 in the town. Part of the poros base of an Ionic column was discovered at Tzabela and Makrygianne. At Kommenou and Mourgkanas part of a building block of anc. Ambrakia was investigated, in the S end of the town, including a narrow street, running E-W with an open drain, and on either side parts of two houses. In House A, S of the street, three rooms and part of a fourth were discovered, with a well- trodden clay floor, and in two of the rooms a layer of tc tiles with clear traces of a fire destruction. House B con- sisted initially of a large area, later subdivided into three smaller spaces, where clay idols, pottery and a HL lamp were recorded. Another room (D2), and part of the paved courtyard of the house were also discovered, with the remains of the stone base for the wooden staircase leading to the first floor of the building, as well as a large rubbish pit full of discarded, mainly C pottery; the upper levels of the fill included mostly HL sherds. Earlier finds from this plot, dated to the A period, are deposits antedating the C town plan, while the two houses can be dated in the HL period, with earlier C phases. The house ST with the paved courtyard and the well, in the Bandalouka plot, under excavation since 1980, yielded a rich destruction layer in the SW room, containing roof tiles, remains of the superstructure, and a large amount of HL sherds, as well as concentrations of miniature vases with clear traces of burning, which might suggest some ritual practice. The investigation of the E part of the house suggests that the original rooms of the HL period were later enlarged; evidence to the same effect was also found under the later paving of the courtyard (pebble floor, drain). Under the foundations of the HL house, walls of the C period and A pebble floors below them were recorded. Part of the road network of anc. Ambr- akia was revealed during excavations on Arachthou (274-7). Dodone. Conservation work was continued in 1981 at the Stadium, (E Terrace wall), revealing two staircases leading to the upper tiers, one to the SE, the other to the NE comer of the T wall (279-80). Work on Prytaneion O (AR 1988-9, 57) by S. Dakaris for the AS in 1989 is reported in Ergon 1989, 63-7. The building of this and the Bouleuterion E2 at the end of the 4th or beginning of the 3rd Ct BC had necessitated enlarging the sanctuary to the W and moving the temenos wall. A new wing (01) was added to the N side of the former at the end of the 3rd Ct, with 3 nine-bedded rooms and service rooms and the Ionic stoa (excavated by Karapanos) at the E. The 1989 season</page><page sequence="43">44 E. B. FRENCH saw the clearance of almost all of the peristyle court and the NW section of the prytaneion itself. The HL court had all the stylobate preserved for the 4x5 Doric columns, replaced after the R destruction of 167 BC by a wider but less well finished set, 4x7. The prytaneion com- prised a large room with 7 series of benches at the N for the founders of the Alliance and later (234-168 BC) the Koinon of the Epirotes. Some architectural anomalies in the plan and the alignment of the altar are probably the result of partial retention of older structures. The prytaneion shows traces of two R building phases not yet closely datable, through lack of sherd evidence and because the architectural elements were later taken for the ECh basilica. Thus after the 4th Ct AD the building ceased to be used as a Prytaneion. Finds include simple pottery and coin blanks (indicating a mint in the area). Ephyra Messopotamou. The joint investigation by Ioannina University and the AE on the Myc acropolis and the tumuli continued in 1984 and is reported in PAE 122-4. Ioannina: University Campus. The continuing investigation of the ancient cemetery (from 1976-81, AR 1988-9,57-8 with refs) revealed 12 new burials, including 4 tile-roofed tombs, 2 urn burials and 5 adult burials under stone piles. The most interesting finds (reported by I. Andreou) in two of the adult burials, (one male, one female), included metal tools, pottery and jewellery (271). Kassope. The joint excavation by the AS, Ioannina University and the German Institute continued in 1981, where Houses 5, 6 and 7, as well as the Katagogion and the N Stoa of the Agora were investigated (278). Kato Merope. SW of the village, at the site of Mnemata, the presence of at least five cist tombs were reported in 1981, while the surface pottery suggests a HL date (273). Konstaniane. 10 km. north of Dodone, systematic repair and restoration on the church of the Taxiarchoi, a three-aisled basilica with an unusual transverse barrel vault cutting across all three aisles. Important murals in poor repair can be found inside (Last Judgement) and outside (Archangel); work was undertaken to protect these from further damage due to damp (ADelt 36 Chr 283-6). Kontinoi. The Post-Byz single-naved wood-roofed chapel with a later narthex addition (both now covered with a single pitched roof) was found to contain some important Russian icons (including a fine Vladimir type Virgin and Child) attesting to the districts' link with Russian traders in the 16th - 17th centuries. The icons are now in the main church of the village of Karadema (ADelt 36 Chr 289-90). Ktismata. During building operations N of the church, part of a poros wall and Cor sherds were reported in 1981, as well as a limestone Doric capital. At the site of Poria, a cist tomb was revealed (273). Lagkiottisa Melias. O. Gratziou draws attention to the importance of protecting monuments such as the parish church of the Birth of the Virgin (spacious single-nave dated to 1886) which preserve evidence for provincial art of the period that was quite opposed to following Athenian patterns under the 'Munich' school (ADelt 36 Chr 290-1). Leukas: Kaligoni (E of Rd between Leukas and Nydri) Part of the foundations of a HL wall were discovered in 1981 in a plot lying at the N end of the anc. town which is been only partially revealed because of its proximity to the modem settlement. Conservation work was carried out on part of the polygonal fortification wall (278). Karyotes (Spasmene Bryse) A group of 8 tombs (three tile- roofed, the rest cist), were reported during work in 1981 on the water supply to the town, all part of the S cemetery of anc. Leukas, already located and investigated (AR 1973-4, 24; 1975-6, 17-8). All the tombs contained offerings; 6 were of HL while the remaining 2 were C. Sections of HL walls were reported E of the road between Leukas and Nydri (277-8). Nikopolis. Sections of walls, tombs and part of a R road were discovered in September 1981 during work connected with the water supply of Prebeza. The tombs were cist or tile-roofed and badly disturbed. Along the coast, walls of R date appeared at surface level, while at the site of Paliokastro Tsoumou, part of a R funerary building was discovered, and was partly excavated. It consisted of a room, partially basement, containing a few sherds. Conservation work was carried out on part of the R wall, a R villa, the Nymphaion, and the Odeion (277). A number of interesting finds from the area were brought in to the Nikopolis Museum in 1981, including 4 inscriptions (texts given) (279). A large building complex was uncovered during clearing work around the metropolitan church of the ECh city, SE of basilica B. Similar clearing NE of basilica A brought to light the apse of an EChr basilica, the sixth to have been found at Nikopolis (ADelt 36 Chr 286). Restoration work was under- taken on the mosaic floors of basilicas A and B but due to poor restoration, much was covered with fibre-glass and plastic and re-covered. Perama. The chance find in 1981 in building work of iron spearheads was followed by the collection of other items including bg ware of the 4th Ct BC probably from tombs (279) Philippias, Mone Pantanassa. (AR 1988-9, 60) Further work was undertaken in 1989 by P. Vokotopoulos for the AS (Ergon 59-62). Excavation of the Sanctuary and the NW and SW corers of the cruciform building and the W corer rooms. Frescoes showing the lower part of the 6 Hierarchs with a painted screen below, and other decorative motives were found. These have been protected by the erection of a wooden roof over the Sanctuary. A tomb was found below the floor of the SW corer room. Another 20 cist tombs were uncovered N of the building, with some pottery of the 16-17th Cts. Moveable finds were scarce except for some excellent pieces of architectural sculpture. Work on the N stoa was completed. Pogoni: Tumuli. E. Andreou reports the completion (1981) of the excavation of Tumulus A at the site of Paliouries (Mt Koutsokrano) during which a total of 7 burials were investi- gated, while 23 burials had been already excavated in 1980. Tumulus A (12m D,lm H), earth-built on the rocky limestone, included 30 burials, 9 of which radiated out from the centre, the rest being irregularly placed; they were all rectangular box- shaped tombs, containing a single burial, lying on its back,</page><page sequence="44">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 45 while only five tombs were covered with stone slabs. The majority included only one or two offerings, while four included no offerings at all (18 tombs had been looted). The remaining offerings date the tombs to the llth-10th Cts BC. Tumulus B (8m D, 0.50m H) lying only 5m S of Tumulus A, is also earth-built, but most of the structure has been eroded. It seems that it originally contained 13 burials, five radiating out from the centre, the rest being irregularly placed. Three of the five burials investigated this season were found within a circular stone-built circle, including one contracted burial (271-3). SOUTHERN THESSALY (13th Ephorate) The 13th ephorate reports on work in 1981 in ADelt 36 Chr 249-254. Alikes. (SE of anc. Demetrias) Part of the foundations of a HL building was cleared in 1981; its position away from the town, near the sea, and the quantity of everyday ware recorded, suggest that it was probably part of the courtyard of a farm- house or villa, or even a rural shrine (250). Belestino. On Alkestes, NE of Bakale Magoula, L. Chatzi- angelakes and A. Eustathiou conducted a trial excavation in 1981, on a plot in a central position within anc. Pherai. In the 9x12m area excavated, fragmentary remains of various successive building phases were discovered, which date from HL to Myc. The better preserved features included HL walls and part of a Myc structure made of small unworked stones bound with clay. The deposits are rich in portable finds of all periods (pottery, clay figurines, bronze coins). Part of a cemetery was discovered under the architectural remains (4 burials) dated to the MBA and the PG period. It seems that this part of anc. Pherai was occupied from Myc down to HL (2nd Ct BC), and that the same area had been used as a cemetery in different periods. At D. Makres and Xanthou (SE part of anc. Pherai) L. Chatziangeles uncovered part of the foundations of a structure and part of an open marble drain of LHL date (249). Bolos. On Papakyriaze during a rescue excavation in 1981, three building phases were recorded below a disturbed surface layer, 2m thick; the excavation reached a depth of 5.10m below the modem road surface. In the first phase three walls were recorded, forming two areas, X1 and X2, part of a paved floor, and part of a clay hearth. The second phase, which was covered by an intensely burnt layer (30cm) lay in area X1. Below this layer, a second clay hearth was revealed, and part of two walls, forming three areas, X1, X2, X3. In X2 a third clay hearth was discovered, and also part of a pithos. X3 apparently did not belong to the building; in here was dis- covered a small cist tomb with a paved floor. Third, at a depth of 4.50m, certain modifications were observed in the two walls, while in area X1, below a thin burnt layer two more clay hearths were recorded. The pottery dates the first phase to a transitional EPG-SMyc period, (fragmentary dark-coated skyphoi etc.), while the two other phases belong to the same cultural period, LH III,(3 kylikes, 2 SJs, etc). Due to the importance of the finds as part of anc. Iolkos, the remains of the last two phases have been preserved for the public in the basement of the modem building (252-3). N. Ionia. Moder drainage works along the roads in N.Ionia, NW of Bolos, revealed a large part of the ancient cemetery of anc. Iolkos. A long and extensive excavation was undertaken by Z. Demos-Malakasiotes, A. &amp; Ch. Intzesiloglou and L. Chatziangelakes in 1981, under very difficult conditions as the tombs lay at a great depth (up to 5m below street level) while in most cases the burials had been partly destroyed by the excavating machinery. Approximately 120 tombs were investigated, of different periods from Myc down to ECh. Myc tombs: Small cists of small flat stones, or of a larger rectangular shape, built in the same way, and covered by schist plaques (1 pit grave) containing individual, contracted burials though in some cases previous burials were attested, pushed aside; very few offerings were recorded. PG-G tombs: Long, rectangular, made of schist plaques; single burials, lying on their backs, with a great number of rich offerings (up to 10 clay vases, some on the covering stones; gold, bronze and iron jewellery). A-C tombs: Relatively few, of various types; sarcofagoi of stone, small cist tombs, rectangular built tombs, or simple pit graves. Multiple burials lying on their back, with very few offerings, mainly pottery. HL-ER tombs: Mainly tile-roofed, hut-like and simple pits, covered with schist plaques; one or two burials, lying on their backs, and one cramation placed in a cylindrical marble burial urn, with very few or no offerings. LR-ECh: Tile roofed, hut-like, or large rectangular built tombs of stone and mudbrick, including single or multiple burials, lying on their backs, with very few offerings. One marble tombstone bore the inscription EYNELII NEA. At the same time, further tombs of the same cemetery were discovered in the same area of N. Ionia in a building plot on Bryoulon and Maiandrou (252). Kallithero. During drainage works, parts of houses (4th-3rd Ct BC) were discovered in 1981, belonging to the E part of anc. K(allithera. The finds included four bg skyphoi, of Attic style, and an inscribed pithos rim with the name of the potter, Sotiridas, in retrograde. Elsewhere part of a house of the 2nd half of the 3rd Ct BC was reported, occupied until the 2nd Ct BC, including a large storage space with pithoi (253-4). Metropole. A marble inscribed plaque was reported during the demolition of a house in 1981, broken on all sides. Six lines were preserved ...ovuv[0fm r.../...e]v 0ovatxo te[p6t- .../... coooxeyvovr .../...X(opat q)poptla Tc.../...- K]oIV(OC toTx O0v[atov.../...Mqlxp]o0oXlT[r[6v- ..., referring to a treaty of alliance between the anc. Metropole and a town probably called Thoni, (Ithomi, or Thomi), which could be identified in a treaty mentioned by Strabo (9.437). The style of the lettering suggests a date within the last quarter of the 3rd Ct BC, or within the first quarter of the 2nd Ct BC if one considers the increasing importance of Mitropolis within the Thessalian Commonwealth and the abandonment of smaller towns like that at Kallithera (254). Nea Anchialo. (Phthiotic Thebes) (AR 1988-9, 53-4) Excava- tions in 1984 are reported by P. Lazarides (PAE 131-41) and he also describes the whole work of the Archaeological Society at the site in AE 1987, 313-35. The 1989 season is summarized in a well illustrated report in Ergon 1989, 53-9. Work was concentrated on the middle section of the Basilica complex where three buildings (4th, 5th and 6th Cts AD respectively) are built one above the other. Traces of an even earlier phase were found at the S; with it were associated fragments of frescoes. Fragments of fresco from Basilica B</page><page sequence="45">46 E. B. FRENCH were found at the N. The relationship of the phases was studied in detail in this centre sector. Excavation work continued in 1981 under the supervision of A. Dina (ADelt 36 Chr 262-9). A general programme of conservation, clearing and limited restoration (e.g. column in Ag. Demetrios basilica) was undertaken, especially in the wake of the earthquakes of July 1980. The N. aisle and apse of the Martyrion basilica were investigated and partly uncovered (cf PAE 1981, 81-2). Amongst the finds were fragments of: a two- sided perforated templon screen wall, marble revetments, floor mosaic, tesserae, wall-paintings, nails and sherds. On the Theocharakis plot on Ag. Georgios, remains were found of what appears to be a poorly constructed occupation from the early 7th Ct AD. Reused building materials, cisterns, a drainage system and ECh sherds, but also a small Vandal coin were found. Many graves of all types common to the region (cist, tile, and tile-covered cist graves) were found throughout the site, most dated to the 5th and 6th Cts AD. Few grave goods were found: one glass phial (0.16m) in grave 96 on Liakopoulou. G. Soteriou uncovered the remains of an ECh basilica (the ninth found on the site) at the intersection of 30th July and Al. Papagou, an area within the ancient walled boundaries. Walls and mosaic floor fragments were found. The floor was of mosaic (well-preserved aniconic decoration) and marble insets (small octagonal tiles). Ten graves were discovered, one tile grave and 9 slab-lined cist graves; these would indicate that after the basilica's destruction in the 7th Ct AD, the site was used as a cemetery. Architectural details point to a 5th Ct date for the structure. A section of the ancient city wall (1.60m wide) was discovered at the depth of 0.83-1.08m. It was constructed of unworked stones with abundant limestone mortar. In the Christou plot on Rallis, remains of anc. ?buildings were uncovered: roughly worked stone and limestone mortar walls, successive floor levels, and some architectural members (unfluted columns and slabs). On Ellenikes Aeoroporeias more structural remains were found including some 57 walls, remains of 14 floors and 21 drainage pipes, nine of clay piping. Two LR drilled acanthus column capitals were also found along with three complete unfluted columns, a double column capital, two column bases, bronze coins, lamp frag- ments and many ECh sherds. A decorated sarcophagus (shields and geometric central pattern) without its lid, but containing many bones including 10 skulls, was found in the Polymerou plot on 30 July (ADelt 36 Chr 262-8). Pagases-Demetriada. Part of the SE cemetery of the town was uncovered in 1981, 15m beyond the S side of the fortifications; ten burials were investigated, five of which were ur burials placed in pits (child burials) dated in the LHL period (249). Petromagoula Bolou. The new PR settlement of Petromagoula (not to be confused with Petra Magoula GAMS H17), built on sloping ground, lies SW of Bolos, in the N part of the site of anc. Demetrias, between the PR sites of Pefkakia and Dimini; its N limit was the sea, while its S limit was the acropolis of Demetrias. Work began in August 1981, when the N part of the settlement was accidently destroyed while the area was being prepared for the laying out of railway lines. Excavations were conducted down to the natural subsoil, in order to establish the chronological sequence, the development and the connections of this settlement with the surrounding sites. Abundant material was recorded, including pottery, sea shells and animal bones, useful for the ecological reconstruction of the life of the settlement. The surface deposit (40cm) included very few sherds and bones and no architectural remains. Below this to the natural subsoil, the pottery consisted mainly of mono- chrome ware of varying clay colour, while the surface of most pots was covered by a red, brown or brown/grey slip. Another pottery type was the decorated ware, comprising only a small percentage of the total, the majority being incised with a few impressed ware, while painted pottery was entirely lacking. Motifs include triangles, spirals,and other geometric patterns. The pottery can be divided into storage ware, transport ware (liquids), cooking ware, mostly phialae and pithoi. Architec- tural remains are reported from a depth of 50cm onward, the majority in a fragmentary condition; they included parts of two stone built walls one built in fishbone masonry. S of this wall and at a depth of 73cm a clay floor was reported; on it pottery was found in situ. Another wall was recorded at a greater depth (2.10m), made of large stones and apparently related to two circular structures. Finds included flint and obsidian blades, stone axes, polishers, clay spindle whorls, buttons, bone and metal pins and points et al.; no idols were recorded. Seafood comprised the majority of the food remains, while animal bones (sheep, goat, bovid) formed only a small proportion of the total. In brief, it seemed that the Petromagoula settlement underwent a considerable develop- ment in the end of the Neolithic period, the Rachmani phase, down to the EBA. The finds suggest that the economy was based on activities connected with the sea involving contacts with other neighbouring and distant settlements (the islands, Macedonia, Balkans) (250-2). Pyrgos Kieriou. The W part of the village (2km NW of Sophades) was apparently built over the E part of the anc. Kierion. Only limited investigations had been conducted in the ancient town, by V. Milojcic (AA 1960, 167-8), at the hill where a PR settlement was identified with Are (Strabo 9.435). The 1981 rescue excavations were mostly of a stratigraphical nature, and continuity of habitation was confirmed from G to R, the high quality of the pottery in particular suggesting the importance of Kierion in the area. In one plot, part of a Lac cover tile with a stamp was found in a rubbish pit, bearing the name of the potter, Timokleous. In the same pit seven clay moulds for idols, busts and plaques were also discovered including the left side of a male bearded head, which could be identified as Poseidon (254). Thaumakos. Investigatory work into the ECh basilica on the Palaiokklesies site (also known as Anathema or Mnemata) was recommenced after a break of some nine years (ADelt 28 Chr, 323-5). Important evidence was found to complete the basil- ica's plan: the narthex was 4.70m wide, cutting across the entire width of the basilica (17.90m) and there were two outer doors in the W narthex wall almost at its edges to the N and S; two further doors existed on the N and S narrow narthex walls. The latter communicated with square rooms projecting from the side walls of the basilica, but their dimensions and exact shape have not yet been established. The narthex communicated with the N and S aisles by means of a single door each, while a two-arched opening seems to have linked it with the nave. The entire floor was covered with mosaic decoration. Although the entire S stylobate was uncovered, its much worn condition did not enable the column base locations to be established. At a distance of 10m. from the W wall of</page><page sequence="46">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 47 the central aisle and 0.80m from the S stylobate, the site of the two-step ambo (4.20m long) was uncovered. Architectural members were found (column capitals, unfluted column drums, two-sided carved templon balustrade etc.) The church belonged to the three-apsed basilica type known in Greece by examples at Dodone and Paramythia (AE 1929, 203-6; ADelt 36 Chr 269-70). Fig. 38 PHTHIOTIS (14th Ephorate) The 14th Ephorate reports on the work of 1981 in ADelt 36 Chr 204-230, a length reflecting the load of building requests which followed the earthquakes, some 810!. Achinos. Rescue excavation in 1981 in four areas is reported by the Ephorate (222-4): a HL structure with in one place a bronze and wood door pivot preserved, and other finds of C and earlier; a large HL complex where, after a destruction, a foundry was installed and at a higher level LR structures; a R building complex (a tiled floor is noted) dating from the 1st Ct to the 4th AD with assorted finds; 2 tombs, one containing 7-8 skulls and associated bones (no pottery was recovered though both were undisturbed). Achladi: Almyropotamos. At the 244 km of the Ethnike Odos (Lamia-Larisa section) a HL fortification was declared an archaeological area in 1981 and investigated. It would have commanded the narrows to Oreoi and the coastal road. Pieces of large pithoi, including 2 with decorated bands, were notable amid much everyday pottery and iron objects (inc. spearheads and knives) (224-5). Atalante. The Ephorate reports for 1981 (214-8) the excava- tions of HL building complexes, drainage systems and two kilns. Finds including coins were numerous; some later material was also recovered, notably a Byz complex on the road to Atalante-Skala. In one area sherds date the walls back to the 5th Ct BC. Just outside the town on the road to Leiban- ates 2 C larax burials were found, one of which, a child's burial, contained many vessels and Boeotian figurines. Elateia. Joint Greek-Austrian excavation under Ph. Dakoronia and S. Deger-Jalkotzy on a ChT cemetery of LH IIIC/SubMyc c. 1.5km SW of the acropolis took place in 1988 and 1989 and is reported by the former: 35 tombs of two types, in rows, were cleared. The earlier (LH IIIC mid/late) are well-cut of standard type with niches in the dromos and pits in the chamber (Fig. 38); there are plentiful pottery offerings particularly with the collected burials (Fig. 39). The later (the end of LH IIIC/SubMyc) are poorly cut without niches and have few offerings. Notable however is the presence of handmade pottery (Fig. 40) and Transitional ware ('Zwischen- ware'). A few tombs show use in G also. Though most were contracted burials, some few were cremations placed in pots in the chamber, belonging to the latest phases of LH IIIC. Some reusage in HL and R was documented. Fig. 39 Exalophos: Smize. The collection of N sherds from the site known for its MH structures (AR 1987-8, 34) is reported in 1981 by A. Onasoglou. They included the rim of a bowl with a matt red net pattern on white and examples of Larisa ware with white on burnished black; figurines and obsidian blades were also collected (228). (Anc.) Halai. A surface survey/ was carried out by J.E. Coleman, Cornell University and W. M. Murray, University of South Florida (ASCS). Work was entirely concerned with the two sites of Halai and Mitrou, both of which had been investigated during the survey season of 1988 (AR 1988-9, 47- 8). "At Halai, tracts were walked in the area of the ancient city outside the acropolis. By the end of the season all accessible land had been surveyed. Recording for the 1:50 plan of the acropolis was completed. Detailed study of the walls at the edge of the sea to the NW of the acropolis confirmed that they belonged to an ancient system of fortification rather than shipsheds. Tests were carried out with a magnetometer to determine whether the inland stretches of the wall can be identified by means of magnetic anomalies; they were largely negative. Workers also studied an ancient stone quarry at Groupoustelles, about 2km N of the acropolis; this quarry had been investigated by the Archaeological Service a few years ago and unfinished columns came to light there during excavations for the foundations of a house during the winter of 1987-1988. At Mitrou surface visibility was poor in the tracts that were not covered in 1988 and little more was done. Nevertheless,</page><page sequence="47">48 E. B. FRENCH our coverage as it now stands is sufficient to provide a reasonably accurate picture of the site. Observations were also made on group of tombs which had been opened by looters in the scarp above the W shore of the islet during the winter of 1988-1989. Recurrent looting at Mitrou indicates the urgency of the need for further work to document the site. The shoreline adjacent to Halai and Mitrou was photo- graphed from a small unmanned balloon at heights ranging from c. 50-200m. Some submerged structures are immediately recognizable in the photographs and further study may reveal others". Fig. 40 Lamia. The members of the Ephorate report for 1981 (204-10) rescue work throughout the town, largely HL; among others: on Mesolongiou a heavy Byz or post-Byz wall; on Esaia and Zalongou part of a massive HL wall and at a lower level a burial pithos; from the same plot came a plaque with the names of freedmen. On Othonos the construction of a block of flats allowed work next door to the plot explored in 1977 (AR 1985-6, 43). Finds included: more of the complex with the water-tank; part of a polygonal wall and an ashlar wall of the late 5th- early 6th Cts (on pottery evidence) with evidence of HL and R occupation in the area; a hoard of 45 bronze coins of Thessaly (1st Ct BC), the Aetolian League (279-168 BC), and Larissa Kremaste (302-286 BC). An HL tomb on Metso- vou with 4 burials and numerous gifts, mainly pottery is listed with, on Androutsou, the remains of a structure with part of one pithos and the settings for others, apparently a storeroom; pottery from the area was HL. Tombs are noted on Parodos Ekklesion, on Eslin and Sophokleous, on Amphiktyonon (3 HL with many gifts), on Thermopylon (10 LC with pottery and bronzes); here in TIII a lamp showing a standing Hermes holding a caduceus and a purse over an altar with the inscrip- tion of the potter nIPE[IM]OY. Leibanates. Excavations in five sectors are reported for 1981 by the Ephorate (219-221): an undated building complex but with glass vessels and kiln holders among the finds; 5 C burial pithoi, their openings to the E containing bg pottery and bones; another tomb of similar date much damaged; at Gkremina where clandestine excavations had taken place, a tomb with pottery and 2 coins of Opountian Locris; excavation (as yet unfinished) nearby uncovered a shrine deposit with many offerings; at Tselepak where the 9th Ephorate in 1970 (ADelt 25 Chr 240) had excavated, the mouths of three other storage pithoi were located on the shore and a cylindrical well structure. It contained a hoard of 1,083 bronze coins of the 4th Ct AD. Lianokladi Station. In 1981 building work uncovered an unknown cemetery and rescue excavation cleared 32 graves, 23 of tiles and 9 pit or cists. The bodies were laid out W-E with the hands crossed on the breasts. There were no offerings; a brooch in T15 would have been attached to the clothing or wrapping. They are assigned to MByz. The nearest town would have been Ypati (anc. Neai Patrai) (225-7). Mazi Malesinas. Work continued on the three-aisled basilica of Ag. Georgios with its mosaic floor and wall-paintings, where the walls up to Im high and the foundations were discovered. Fragments of unfluted columns and glazed sherds highlight the church's importance (ADelt 36 Chr 270). Megaplatanos: Palaiokastra. (AR 1985-6,41-2.) 12 more tombs of the C cemetery were excavated in 1981 (221), comprising both pithoi and clay larnakes, after disturbance by mechanical excavations and subsequent tomb robbing. Some finds were rescued. Nea Monasteri. A PG cist tomb found in 1981 with the deadman laid on top of slabs and accompanied by three vases in the local grey 'bucchero' and a pin with pommegranate head is described by A. Onasoglou (227). Paralia Pelasgias. At Ag. Dynamis, W of a track leading from the shore to the town, finds made during deep ploughing led to the excavation in 1981 of a three-aisled ECh basilica. The centre aisle was floored with geometric mosaic with central roundel; the side aisles were tiled. (225). Panagitsa Elateias. Continuation in 1981 of the work on the cemetery started in 1979 (AR 1987-8, 35) is reported (221-2). 14 further MG and C tombs with rich finds were cleared. Raches. A BA settlement is reported in the press (Dem. Logos 7.10.89). Stylida. For 1981 (210- 4) the Ephorate reports the find of 14 tombs, 2 PG (the first PG finds in the town) and 12 ECh on Zese Dibriote (Myc and Submyc sherds with C, LR and Byz were found as well as many PG); of a PG tomb under another undated on Kostropizou and Akhinou; of 4 C tombs with some offerings on Lamias; of a cist tomb with 4 burials and bg pottery on Metropleos and Phalaron; of 3 ?R tombs (II &amp; III are a double tomb) on K. Petride with few finds but some structural interest; of house walls with 3 courses preserved on 28'es Oktobriou with finds of LC-EHL. Tragana. A Onasoglou publishes in detail in ADelt 36 1-57 tombs found in 1981 (note correction to the press report quoted in AR 1981-82 28). Ypati. The find in 1981 of part of a large Byz complex is reported. The chief room was over 10m long with a marbled floor; a smaller adjacent room had a floor of decorative tiling. A bronze coin of Emmanuel III (c. 1050 AD) was found in cleaning the walls. A portrait head, probably of L Hadrianic or E Antonine date which has been taken to the Lamia Museum is described by A. Onasoglou (227-8).</page><page sequence="48">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 49 Work continued on the ECh baptistery with quatrefoil font and fine geometric-pattern mosaic floor in the Schiza plot (ADelt 36 Chr270). NORTH THESSALY (15th Ephorate) The 15th Ephorate reports on work in 1981 in ADelt 36 Chr 255-61. Among the chance finds reported for that year are several interesting inscribed grave stelai (texts given, 260-1). Argyropouli Tyrnabou: A PG Tholos tomb was discovered c. 200m N of another Tholos located in 1965. The Tholos tomb cemetery belonged to the Homeric town of Ilone (Limone); at Pano Argyropouli there are clear indications of MH and Myc habitation. The Tholos was entered on the W through a dromos (only partially excavated) built in dry stone masonry of small stones. The dromos narrowed towards the doorway; the floor of beaten earth sloped down in the same direction; PG sherds were found in the fill. The doorway consisted of two stone slabs placed upright on either side and projecting at both ends, while the threshold itself was also a stone block. The entrance was blocked by two small dry stone walls, one on either side, the outer reaching the top of the tholos. The vault was built of large stone blocks bound with clay, up to a height of 1.40m, above which smaller stones were used; all were dressed on the inside. The floor of the tomb was of beaten earth and over it lay a thick deposit of sand and clay deposited by the elements which had disturbed the original position and caused the breakage of the eight clay vases accompanying the burials. They included inter alia two handmade jugs, two handmade kantharoid skyphoi, three amphoriskoi, and two small metal rings. Part of the cremation pyre was located in the E part of the tomb, with many scattered bones, while the larger bones had been buried in a shallow pit. It seems that the cremation preceded the building of the tomb, since part of it continued outside (255-257). Among chance finds handed in is are 2 bronze phiale, one decorated with racing chariots (260-1). Gonnoi. In previous rescue excavation in 1977 part of a large rectangular building with many portable finds (including sculptures and votive stelai) was identified as a shrine to Asklepios-Hygieia. During a second season of excavation a further section of the building was revealed. The five external walls and three internal dividing walls were built of stone, while the other two internal walls were later additions. The inner face was covered with painted plaster, and on the inside of the building remains of two floors were discovered, one mosaic floor, and one of well-trodden clay. Two building phases were identified, EHL and R (clay floor); the shrine was apparently used from the mid -4th Ct BC and was destroyed in R times. Two interesting pieces of sculpture are worth mentioning: the lower part of a relief, and the torso and legs of a headless boy, wearing a chlamys (257-259). The Grevena Project (ASCS) reports as follows: "In 1989 we investigated a total of 167 sites. Most of these sites were newly discovered this year, although a few known from prior seasons warranted further investigation. With these additions, the number of sites located by the project now totals 267. The primary goal of the archaeological survey is to record the major sites within the nomos of Grevena. No period of occupation has been ignored, so that we have recovered remains from Pal times through the period of Ott rule. Since we thought that 1989 would be our last field season, we tried to finish visiting all of the villages within the nomos. We accomplished this task with only a few exceptions: namely, the villages of Ag. Giorgios (Dasohori), Disselakkio, Gilofos, Prosvoro, Pistiko, Lipsi, Trikorofo, Dasillio and Kritharakia. As in past years, information from local villagers has been our best guide to the location of ancient sites, although in some cases our increasing familiarity with the landscape has allowed us to discover sites unknown to the locals. The earliest pottery recovered this year belongs to the EN period. Major sites with pottery of this period are located near the villages of Taxiarchis, Felli, Despotis, Karpero, and Vatolakkos. M and LN sites, as in past years, are scarce. EBA remains are few and seem to be from late in the period, as for example at Pilori, Amygdalies and Taxiarchis; but the MB period is now well documented with material from Diporo, Mirsina, and Vatolakkos, to name only a few sites. A small number of sherds of the Myc period come from multi-period sites such as at Mirsina and Vatolakkos, sites which have produced EIA material as well. Major sites of the HL period include a number of well- fortified hilltops along the western edge of the nomos, as for example at Mesolouri and Perivoli. Other large sites of this period, many also on isolated hilltops, can be found at Diporo, Mirsina, Dasohori and Deskati. ER material continues to be difficult to segregate from the HL, but remains of the LR period are quite numerous, as for example at Dasohori, Mirsina, Poros, Rhodia, and Emilianos. A number of sites produced material that must belong to LByz times, including Pigaditsa, Megaro. During the past several hundred years, many such villages were abandoned, their inhabitants joining with people from neighboring villages to settle the sites that we see occupied today. Magnetometer and resistivity meter surveys were conducted at two sites, Ag. Petros/Mirsina and Panaghia/Itea. At the former site very large anomalies were located inside the moder cemetery, close to the surround wall. Because of the size and shape of the anomalies, they are likely to represent buried structures, although the possibility that the magnetome- ter anomalies were created by metal contained in the modem wall must not be ignored. At Panagia/Itea several anomalies were documented on the artificially flat hilltop. The recent discovery of two cisterns here seems to explain the anomalies recorded by members of our team last year. Professor Mary Savina continued her project of establishing a chronosequence of soil development within the nomos. It has become clear that the colour of the soil and the amount of carbonate leaching are good indicators of the age of most soils, and thus can be used to establish a terminus ante quem for the sherds contained within them. It proved possible to obtain four pollen cores, two from elevations above 1000m. and two from sites in the Grevena basin itself. The vegetation in these areas was also studied in order to aid in interpretation of the pollen record. Dr. Oliver Rackham continued his study of the paleoecology of the region, both on the identification of plants and on the problem on erosion and its causes. Ethnoarchaeological studies of the pre-mechanized (i.e. pre- 1960) agricultural economy of the nomos were completed. One of the goals this season was to understand the effect of World War II on agricultural production.

Tumulus Z lies in the S limit of the extensive cemetery of anc. Krannon, at the site of Mauropetra (Doxara, Larisa) which has been systematically looted over the last two years. As a result, the immediate excavation of the tumulus was decided by the Ministry of Culture; the site was dug by a trench system (3 trenches) down to stereo (6.40m). The fill which covered the tumulus, consisting of pebbles and earth, did not yield any traces of cist or built tombs, while in the third trench evidence for quarrying of a flaky sandstone was observed, a material widely used at anc. Krannon, for funeral stelae. It was suggested that this material was used for the construction of tombs in tumuli in the surrounding area (259- 60). Lykoudi (Elasona). Two PG cist tombs were reported as part of the cemetery of anc. Azoros. The first contained one burial accompanied by a skyphos, a jug, an amphoriskos, and an iron ring. The second also contained one burial, accompanied only by one skyphos (257). Fig. 41 Mount Chassia range. Survey by the French School (L. Darmesin for the University of Lyon) continued in 1989, concentrating in two areas. (1) the Syrosas valley: this area proved very rich and important settlements, one fortified one not, were found at the two ends of the valley, with a fortlet (?for communication) between. Occupation from C to Byz was noted. The names of the anc. cities have not yet been deter- mined. (2) N and NE of Trikkala: 2 small C fortlets (reused in Byz times) and a HL sanctuary as well as a R aqueduct and at Rhizoma traces of a R settlement with bath were identified. The absence of any C habitation sites in this sector is puzzling and may reflect the influence of Trikkala and its cults. Peneios River. A study of the stratigraphy of the Peneios River was carried out in 1989 by C. Runnels for the ASCS in order "to identify the locations of sites that produced the Pal stone tools found in the 1987 surface survey of Thessaly (AR 1987-88, 38). Once located, the sites were correlated with the stratification visible in the banks of the Peneios River. 7 new findspots were discovered along the Peneios River W of Larisa, and 8 1987 findspots were re-examined. A total of 135 stone artifacts were collected. The banks of the river were searched upstream and downstream from the known findspots in order to locate the sources of the stone artifacts and fossil bones. A rubber boat was used to reach the cut banks of the river where exposures of artifact-bearing layers exist. By this means it was determined that FS 15, which is the richest Pal findspot in Thessaly, was in fact a site rather than a collection of redeposited artifacts. This conclusion was based on the fact that artifacts were not found upstream or downstream from this site. The study of FS 15 revealed that the river is exposing a layer of stream gravels from the bottom of the river sequence at a depth of c. 9m. This bed of stream gravels is extremely rich in un-eroded stone tools and fossil animal bones. A 1987 site located to the W of Larisa near the Stena Kalamakiou, FS 17, was re-investigated in 1989, and a significant new collection of stone tools was made. The site is found in a layer of stream gravels lying near the top of the river stratification, c. 4m below the present surface. The artifacts from FS 17 are similar to those from FS 15. Both sites have an industry with a mixture of M and UPal tool types, much like the Szeletian industry of Hungary. It is probable that there is only one lithic industry represented in the river deposits, and not two as was thought by Milojcic. All 7 new FSs produced MPal artifacts. FSs 43, 45 and 46 are the most important and they significantly enlarge our understanding of the Thessalian MPal. These three findspots are sites that are sources, along with FSs 15, 17, 42, for the stone tools found in the river bed. They are found in strata of artifact-bearing stream gravels exposed in cut banks in the approximate area of FS 3, c. 4m below the present surface. The tools from these findspots closely resemble those found in FSs 15 and 17. FS 15 is at the bottom of the stratification exposed by the downcutting of the river, and FS 17 comes from near the top of the same sequence. FSs 43, 45, and 46 are also near the top of the sequence and are 3-4km downriver from FSs 15 and 17. The new sites produced stone tools identical with FS 17 and the sites are also similar in depth and lithostratigraphy. This fact allows us to date the 1987 and 1989 findspots from the upper end of the river sequence. A U\Th date of c. 27,000 +\- 8,000 BP was obtained from a soil directly above FS 43, proving that all of the river findspots may be older than 27,000 BP, and may be older than 35,000 BP. The most important find in 1989 was made at FS 30 on a Pliocene terrace of the Peneios River. This findspot was discovered in 1987 at the entrance of the Stena Rodias, N of Larisa. It was concluded that this place was an atelier where MPal stone tools were manufactured from flint cobbles obtained from the old terrace. An entirely different lithic industry was discovered in 1989. Flake tools of high quality</page><page sequence="50">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 51 Fig. 42 quartz were found with flint chopping tools eroding from a thin soil that covers this terrace. The quartz tools were found in this soil at a depth of 0.80m in a section exposed by road building. One of the quartz artifacts is a fragment of a large bifacial tool, possibly a handaxe. Although these artifacts may be classified as Pal, they do not resemble the MPal artifacts found elsewhere in the Peneios sequence. These new artifacts more closely resemble the LPal industry found in the Yar Imburgaz Cave. It is thus possible that FS 30 is an open-air LPal site of unknown date. The river began to incise these deposits more than 200,000 years ago and it is possible that this site dates to that period or later. The Pliocene terrace is only a small remnant of the surface that has been eroded by the Peneios River. Other sites of this period along the river are unlikely to be preserved, and a more detailed study of FS 30 is imperative. Three quartz tools from the vicinity of the village of Megalo Monastiri were collected in 1987. This area consists of highly eroded hills of Pliocene age. It was selected for investigation because of the chance discovery there in 1984 of the fossilized remains of an elephant but the work was not completed. This discovery of quartz tools from the same area as the fossil elephant encourages me to believe that artifacts similar to those from FS 30 exist in the hills around Megalo Monastiri. As a consequence, a new investigation of this area is war- ranted. In summary all of the findspots in the Peneios River banks belong to the MPal and probably date to between c. 55,000 and 30,000 BP. The findspots are not the result of reworking or redeposition of large living sites or base camps. The MPal hunters left tools and discarded weapons at kill-sites and temporary hunting stands and camps. These sites were located on gravel bars in the river. The river has shifted its channel many times in the last 100,000 years, burying the MPal sites when it changed its course, and re-exposing them when it again moved its bed. A single industry, the Thessalian MPal, is found in the layers of stream gravels exposed in the present river channel. The depth of the deposits ranges from 9 to 4m below the modem surface. There is little change in the industry from the bottom to the top of the sequence, although large tools on good quality jasper are perhaps more numerous in the lower levels. A new industry, which is provisionally termed the Rodia industry, was identified at FS 30 near the entrance to the Stena Rodias. There is also evidence of MPal activity at the same site. The Rodia industry is different from the MPal industry of the Peneios, and it is possible that it is LPal." Spelia. Six 4th-5th Ct BC tombs were excavated at the site of Kokka, all cists orientated N-S; most were at least partly destroyed in modem times (259). Trikala region. In Trikalina 9 (1989) 123-130 old finds of inscriptions noted only in local newspapers are brought together and republished.

(AR 1988-9, 72-3) The third season of the collaborative excavation between the Thessalonike Ephorate (I. Vocotopoulou) and the University of Tasmania (J. Carington Smith) took place on this hill-top site in autumn 1989. On behalf of the collaboration, J. Carington Smith reports: "Tests in the settlement immediately south of those exca- vated in 1988 partially uncovered two rooms of a large, well- constructed building, dated to the later phase of the EIA by a fragmentary bowl with knobbed handles lying on its floor. The building's present length surpasses 10m. It was built over an earlier, absidal, structure (Fig. 41). In the EIA cemetery 78 graves have been discovered, os which 41 are cists, 23 pithoi, and 14 shallow pit graves. Cremation appears to have been the sole rite, and the seat of the main pyre may have been located beneath the oval peribolos mentioned in last year's report. A find of outstanding interest from an early 9th Ct BC pit grave was a miniature clay boat with a well-defined raised prow and stem and an extended keel. Finds from other tombs included iron spear- heads, a large curved iron knife, bronze fibulae (Fig. 42), and pottery both of local northern EIA types and forms known from Euboea and related areas." lerissos.

The line of the city wall dividing Potidaia from Kassandra was determined. The placing of a church of Ag. Nikolaos on the Byzantine walls, greatly to their detriment, is reported (Nea 1.2.90). Fig. 44 Torone. Excavations continued in 1989 as a collaboration of the Athens Archaeological Society and the Australian Archaeological Institute, under the direction of Alexander Cambitoglou (see also Ergon 1989, 73-8), who reports: "Excavations were again focused on Promontory 1, known from Thucydides as the Lekythos. The work this season was concentrated in a series of trenches laid out towards the SE end of the promontory and represents a continuation of the project begun in 1986 and continued in 1988 (AR 1986-7, 37-9, AR 1988-9, 74). In addition, a new trench (TR 74) was dug towards the N end of the promontory which showed that cultural levels here were far less well preserved than those elsewhere. In TR 61/62, below the original floor of the large semi- circular tower of LByz date (Fig. 43) and the underlying C phases reported in AR 1988-89, 74, A levels were revealed. These comprised a series of poorly preserved wall foundations and associated floor levels, below which a substantial layer of fill was partially cleared. The latter brought to light three massive pithoi in situ, representing part of a large storage complex. Although further excavation is required to determine their exact date, study of the material recovered from the clay packing around two of the pithoi would indicate a Sub-PG date. In TR 63/65 the interior and exterior of the large cistern (Fig. 44) first uncovered in 1986 were further investigated. The plan of the cistern was completely revealed, showing it to be a circular structure some 4m in diameter. The material associated with the cistern would suggest a construction date in the HL period or slightly earlier. A LR amphora burial of an infant was also excavated in the upper levels of the trench, while the HL levels brought to light many architectural fragments thought to derive from the Temple of Athena mentioned by Thucydides. Conspicuous among the latter were a number of limestone guttae (Fig. 45) which must derive from a Doric building of A date. Excavations were also continued in Trenches 69 and 74. In the former, the foundation trenches of a comparatively well preserved domestic structure were cleared showing it to be of LC or EHL date. In TR 74 the PR levels, especially those of</page><page sequence="52">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 53 Fig. 45 the EBA, were further investigated. The most important discoveries of 1989 were made in the area of TR 67/68, where the C and post-C levels had been thoroughly explored in previous seasons. Two broad phases of the MBA were uncovered. In both, stone socles for mud-brick walls were revealed, along with successive floor levels and hearths; fragments of roof-tiles were encountered in both phases. The various deposits comprising the two phases yielded local varieties of Minyan pottery, a small quantity of imported Minyan, as well as coarse ware pottery and other small finds (Figs. 46, 47). Significantly, fragments of at least one Early Myc closed vessel of LH II date were recovered from the later of the two phases, which otherwise yielded material of MBA character. A minimum of 15 other fragments of LH I-II pottery (Fig. 48) were encountered in later levels, out of original context. This material represents the earliest evidence in Macedonia of contact with the Myc world; the earliest previously known Myc pottery in the N being of LH III A2/B1 date. Well-preserved EBA levels were encountered below those of the MBA. Part of a stone socle for a mud-brick wall was uncovered, along with at least three associated floor levels, each with hearths. A good deal of EB pottery was recovered, so too other small finds, including the terracotta figurine of a female figure and clay objects of unknown use (Fig. 49). The 1989 excavations have established a well-stratified sequence throughout the course of the BA, of which the middle and early stages of the LBA yielded evidence for marked contacts with Central and Southern Greece and the Aegean."

Many reports concern the important finds of E. Poulaki-Pandermali in the region. Excavations starting in 1985 and continued in 86-87 (AR 1986-7, 34) have now revealed both an extensive EIA cemetery and a Myc one at Spathes. Other Myc cemeteries have been found at Leptokaria, Ag. Demetrios, Stena Petras and probably at Ag. Panteleimon. Finds include much pottery of both canonical and local types, bronze weapons and jewellery including amber. Nea Michaniona. The presence of tombs has been reported at various times near the Anthoupolis area, while in a ChT of R</page><page sequence="53">54 E. B.

Excavations hopefully to be assisted shortly by EEC money, have uncovered evidence for a long occupation by Christians from ECh extending into Ott times. More work has to be done (Thessalonike 21.9.89). Pydna. (AR 1988-9, 68-9) M. Beses, at the Macedonia/Thrace conference, reports the find of 114 tombs (EIA to 4th Ct BC). The importance of the harbour to its 5th Ct BC status was stressed, on the basis of the rich tombs of this period; imports of Attic pottery, jewellery and weapons are particularly notable. One 5th Ct burial in a wooden sarcophagus was accompanied by a full set of weaponry, as well as pottery (Nea 20.1.90). Another fuller account has appeared in Kyriakatikos Rizosplastes 6.5.90. Rentina. (AR 1988-9, 69) Work by N. Moutsopoulos under the aegis of the AS continued in 1989 (Ergon 1989, 78-9). This year the fortification of the Byz settlement was investigated; the method of construction proved unusual. The link of the covered stairway leading to the complex of cisterns at the base of the hill with the acropolis wall was cleared by the S gate. From study to date, the internal lay-out of the settlement and the phasing of its structures has been achieved. Fig. 46 Nea Eukarpia. Part of a LR or ECh building was uncovered (302).

BA and C sherds wre reported from disturbed layers at the Toumpa of Ydatopyrgos (302). Thessalonike. A considerable number of building plots were investigated in the city during 1981, some of which were rescue excavations (299). Three plots were of particular interest due to their proximity to the Palace of Galerius and the agora. Part of the cryptoporticus of the hippodrome (at 7 Hippodromiou) was discovered, 7.50m L, although the superstructure was destroyed. The excavation of the S part of the Palace of Galerius and the entrance way leading from the R Harbour to the palace was completed (ADelt 24 Chr 296; 29 Chr 678), involving two building phases, the later one includ- ing a section of a polychrome mosaic floor and frescoes. On Amynta sections of walls of various periods were discovered, including LHL, R, ECh. On Rengoukou an inscription with Greek and Latin text was found in a secondary context (covering a tomb in the W R cemetery) reporting repairs to the Isis temple.</page><page sequence="54">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 55 Fig. 49 Kathemerine (11.6.89, 21.3.90) reports the handing over to to 9th Byzantine Ephorate of the former Yedikule prison. Part will be preserved as a memorial, but the structures will be studied, conserved and used. Arguments between the Church and the Archaeological Service about usage (affecting its preservation) in Ag Demetrios are widely reported. Excavation in the R agora (P1. Dikasterion) has been initiated by the city in order to make an underground car park; the work is under the supervision of the Ephorate but is not without anxiety. On Langadas a multi-roomed ECh tomb complex has been excavated by D. Makropoulou; an important find is a statue of the Good Shepherd (Nea 22.12.89). A large and substantial Byz cistern was reported from Olympiados by D. Nalbantes at the Macedonia/Thrace conference (Kathemerine 23.1.90) and illustrated (Play Boy 1.3.90). The need for urgent conservation to the Arch of Galerius is seriously discussed (Kathemerine and Eleuther.Typos 2.3.90). At the Macedonia/Thrace confer- ence G and P Belene report the definite location of the previously elusive stadium just NW of the Palace of Galerius between P1. Ag. Sophias and Apellou. (Thessalonike 20.1.90) N. Gioles publishes an article in Parousia I (1982) on 'The Dome Mosaics of the Rotunda (Hagios Georgios) Thessalon- ike: An Iconographic Parallel'. 1989 saw the foundations being laid of the new Byzantine Museum. Excavations on the site on Tsirogianni St. brought to light 88 R tombs, including a burial chamber which will be preserved. 60 built tombs, some with very interesting epigraphical information, were uncovered on the Municipal Hospital site (Thessalonike 21.9.89). At the Stoa Chortiate important and undisturbed stratigra- phical levels extending from R to Ott periods were discovered, and will provide invaluable information for dating (Thessalo- nike 21.9.89). In 1981 particular attention was paid to structural reinforce- ment works on monuments that had suffered in the earthquake of 1978. This was done with financial and material support from the Service for the Rehabilitation of Earthquake Victims in North Greece (ADelt 36 Chr 305-09). The churches of Ag. Antonios, tou Sotira, the katholikon of the Blattadon Monastery (where layers of murals going back to the Byz period were discovered), the Bardarios fortress, the Rotonda (church of Ag. Georgios), where restoration work is expected to finish in 1990, the Turkish 'Paradise' baths (Bey Hamam), the Yeni Hamam (undergoing extensive restoration), the Yahudi Hamam, the tower of Ag. Basileios, and the church of Ag. Panteleimon. At Ag. Sophia conservation work was undertaken on the dome and apse mosaics. Investigations of the parian marble pillars showed that the intercolumniations of the N colonnade had at one staged been blocked with a 1.05m. high balustrade, except for the last to E, and that the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th intercolumniation of the S aisle had likewise been blocked. Two windows facing onto the prothesis and the diakonikon from the sanctuary were found to have become redundant after the roofs of both were heightened. A mural on a tomb in the S aisle was restored (ADelt 36 Chr 307). Important ECh evidence for the basilica complex originally under Ag. Sophia was uncovered at 3 Keramopoulou. On the N part of the plot, part of a courtyard with a cloister was uncovered. 2 brick built pillars of the stoa were supported by 2 parallel stylobates and a floor of large marble plaques 1.70x0.80m. In the fill of this floor, ECh and Byz glazed pottery was found. Rooms and floors of various phases were found to the S. Room A (5.60x6m) was vaulted, as was room B with which it communicated, B's barrel vault being trans- verse to A's. A square cistern (2.50x2.50x1.60m) with blind arches on the E and W walls had been covered with a large marble plaque. The cistern and rooms A and B represent phase 1, probably that of the 5th Ct basilica. The 2nd phase can be traced in three steps at the base of the cistern, perhaps for a</page><page sequence="55">56 E. B. FRENCH change of use (storeroom?) and dates to the 7th Ct (ADelt 36 Chr 312). Other remains associated with Ag. Sophia's predecessor were found including an underground chamber (6x1.65m) which, prior to full excavation, was thought to have been the beginning of a stoa from the courtyard of Ag. Sophia to the holy fountain of St. John the Baptist. 395 so-called 'Barbarian' coins were found in its fill, indicating that the area was probably holy (ADelt 36 Chr 312). Extensive repairs and works of structural reinforcement were made on all main sections of the land walls and towers. The White Tower, so long left to decay, now houses a fine Byzantine Museum (ADelt 36 Chr 307-09). Work continued at the funerary basilica on 3rd September (cf AA 35 (1980) Chr 386) by E. Marke. The funerary side-chapel uncovered during the previous excavations to the S of the basilica is cross-plan with 11 graves and may represent the original martyrion before the founding of the basilica (AE 1981, 53- 69). ECh remains were uncovered in other parts of the city including important evidence for the little known East Wall demolished in the 19th Ct and the Asomatos Gate known from the literature (ADelt 310-313). An important LR/ECh grave complex was discovered under the plot for the Theological School extension. Successive burials are clearly apparent. A grave with a circuit wall, the only found in Thessalonike, was found (cf. family graves at Nea Anchialos PAE 1955, 136.) 12 graves of three types (cist, tile and vaulted, the latter sparsely decorated with aniconic motifs) were found. An area for cremation was found near graves 6 and 7 at the N where 4th and 5th Ct AD sherds and lamp moulds were found while the wider area produced LR and 3rd to 5th Ct AD sherds and 3 terra-cotta figurines on the N side. Xerochori. The find of the skull of 'Ouranopithakos Makedon- ikos' dating from 9-12 million years ago (some 10 million years older than the Petralona example) by G. Kouphos and L. de Bonis is reported. The environment then would have been of 'savannah' type (Epikairoteta 12.12.89 et al.) Zagkliberi-Sarakina-Nea Apollonia. Small finds and rescue excavations in the area indicate the presence of R tombs, including two funerary stelae (302). WESTERN MACEDONIA The 17th Ephorate reports work in 1981 in AD 36 Chr 315-27. Ag. Paraskeue (Kozane). The entrance to a built single ChT of the R period was reported in 1981 at Tsakeli, and extensive excavations were planned for the following year (326). Aiani. (AR 1986-87 40 with refs.; 87-88 49-50.) The press reports continued large-scale excavation at this important site, noting particularly the long spread of the cemetery which includes tombs of the 6th Ct BC and HL. Rich and interesting offerings were found in unrobbed graves of each period (Thessalonike 7.9.89 et al.). Asomata Berroias. The discovery in 1981, as the result of deep ploughing, of a group of 5 earth-cut HL tombs is reported. The tombs were full of earth, the covering slabs were all missing; each contained one burial in an extended position with few offerings (324). Bergina. Two cist tombs were reported in 1981 during conservation work on Romaios' Macedonian Tomb, made out of poros blocks, with paved floors (324). Publication of the city of Aigai is contained in Egnatia 28. The proposed foundation of a Museum to house the Bergina finds has been widely reported in the press. At a public lecture in Athens, widely reported, and at the Macedonia/Thrace conference, M. Andronikos described his latest finds. The most notable is a unique series of 25 (or 27) lifesize female terracotta heads with traces of paint and two male (one young, one old) from a cist grave of the 5th Ct BC, perhaps representing deities connected with funeral rites; a link with Demeter and Kore and the Samothracian deities is suggested. In all 4 graves of women of the 6th and 5th Cts BC with rich finds were cleared (Nea 27/31.1.90). A summary of the 1989 season is given in Ergon 1989, 67-73; excavation was carried out in 5 areas: the area of the palace and the theatre; the Acropolis; the shine of Eukleia; in a HL house; the A and C cemetery. Work in 1984 is published in PAE 66-70. Berroia. In 1981 a cemetery of rock-cut chamber and pit tombs of rectangular shape, including a square built structure, was discovered on Ploutarchou by D. Zagorianos and P. Tsatsopoulou. The cemetery, 4th-2nd Ct BC, lies N of the N fortification walls of Berroia, where other such tombs have been reported in the past (ADelt 29 Chr 714-7, ADelt 35 Chr 408-9). Tomb T, a square stone built structure, was approached by a dromos, leading to the actual doorway, while on either side of the latter, which is now blocked by two stone blocks, two Doric monolithic half-columns on poros bases were discovered. The door was probably originally wooden, but there is no evidence for the roofing of the tomb. A partially destroyed poros funerary platform lay in the NW corer of the chamber which though full of earth contained the bones of, at least, three skeletons. This 3rd Ct BC monument combines architectural elements of the rock-cut chamber tomb and the Macedonian Tomb. The rock-cut ChTs also included a dromos, occasionaly with steps leading down to the chamber itself, which was of irregular plan and usually contained funerary benches/platforms, or niches and a number of offerings (pottery, jewellery). The pit graves contained extended burials and a few offerings dated to the 3rd Ct BC. Part of a stone HL wall was discovered by B. Allamane on Hippokratous, with a N-S direction, probably part of a large building complex between Prophitis Elias and Kappos. At right angles to this wall, part of another wall was observed, and in the angle formed by the two walls, a huge pithos full of earth, a few bones and sherds. An intact subterranean rock-cut tomb of EHL date was discovered on Sophias by Th. Sabbopoulou; it contained three funerary platforms and five burials. The offerings included pottery, a pair of iron scisors and other tools, as well as many organic remains, now in Berroia Museum (322-4). Edessa. 40 R slab-covered rock-cut tombs have come to light during building work for a new police station. A few items of jewellery accompanied the burials. A single inscription mentions ZQOnlOPOX (Avriani 31.7.89).</page><page sequence="56">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 57 On Kioutacheia in 1981 a group of nine tombs was reported, one of which was tile roofed, the rest being rock cut graves, covered with schist slabs. The dead lay extended, with no offerings. A cist tomb was reported at Monasteriou and Phlorinis, also without offerings (322). Longos. Investigation, especially in the SE section of the settlement, was continued in 1981 to the E and W of the 1980 area by A. Vavritsas and P. Tsatsopoulou. Sections of LR walls, parts of drainage and water supply systems, pithoi and, in some areas, clay floors were discovered, but the finds gave no indication of the function of the areas. At the same time, conservation and photography continued. A subterranean rock- cut, single-chamber tomb, with a considerable number of offerings, including gold earings and silver coins of Alexander the Great, was discovered during work W of the National Road from Edessa to Thessalonike (322). Panagitsa. During road works at Ampelia, a cemetery of 12 LR tombs was located in 1981 by P. Tsatsopoulou, 8 cist and 4 simple pits. The offerings included bronze jewellery, with a marked absence of pottery (322). Giannitsa: Arabessos. A two-week excavation was carried out at Kato Bourdistes by P. Adam-Belene. In two trenches the wall foundations for two contiguous areas were reported, Area 4 and Area 1. At the W and S side of Area 1, two long and narrow spaces were discovered; in Area 4, a hard plaster floor was reported, with broken roof tiles over it, while in Area 1 a clay floor was found. In the NE corer of Area 1 traces of burning, 2m in diam., were observed between two burnt mud bricks, as well as a number of whole pots (two amphorai, one trefoil-lipped oenochoe, a cooking pot, two small skyphoi, etc). An earlier foundation was located under the NW comer of Area 1, dated by a rare silver coin to the 1st Ct BC-lst Ct AD (mint of Rome). N of Areas 1 and 4 extend two further areas, only the S section of which was excavated. In the other test trenches only portable finds were recorded, including pottery, glass, bone, metal objects, dating the whole site to the 3rd-4th Ct AD, with an earlier 1st Ct AD phase (321). Mandalo. The stratigraphical investigation of the Sitzan- Tepe Toumba, conducted by Prof. Kotsakis, K. Papanthemou, K. Papasteriou and Th. Sabbopoulou, revealed the presence of an important PR settlement dated to the end of the N period and the EBA. In the deposit down to a depth of 5.16m, in a 2x11m trench, 52 successive layers were observed. The walls of the buildings were of pise, strengthened with wooden posts, and wooden floors (320-1). Kato Kleines. Remains of a R house with a mosaic floor, decorated with geometric motives was discovered in 1981 by G. Akamates and M. Bogiatzes (325). Kopanos Naouses. A group of 18 rock-cut tombs, rectangular in plan, as well as two cremations in pots placed inside pits were reported by B. Allamane in 1981 from lkm SE of the large Macedonian Tomb at Kapsoura. Almost all had E-W orientation and were full of earth; most of the covering stones were missing. They contained one or rarely two burials in an extended position. The quality of the funerary pottery was generally bad, and very few pieces could be restored; a few coins dated the cemetery to the 4th-3rd Ct BC. A group of 14 other similar tombs of the same period was found in the same area. A rectangular area with a plaster floor was discovered at Kamara, on which many terracotta plaques were found, probably part of a floor or wall decoration; excavations were to be conducted in 1982 (325). Marina Naouses. At Gallika a marble cist tomb was reported in 1981 by M. Siganidou, with no funeral offerings (324-5). Pella. (AR 1988-9, 76-8.) The press reports the excavation by M. Akamate of 15 HL cist graves in which the dead had gold mouthpieces inscribed with their names. Work in 1981 concentrated on the S agora where a structure with central court and four columns 4m high was cleared. These will be re-erected, as few areas of the site have standing monuments of this height. The find of two marble 4th Ct herms, one Hermes one Aphrodite, by G. Akamatis is also reported. House walls of the first town and the paved road leading to the harbour (on Lake Giannitsa) give important evidence of the siting of the earlier settlement. Work continued also on the Palace, which covered 60,000 sq.m and was originally entered by a porch 15m wide whence a series of rooms led up to the main area. A new section of the N wall of the city gives the limit of the Palace on that side (Nea 6.10.- 89). Acropolis: The excavation and detailed planning of the Acropolis started again in 1981 after 19 years, especially in the SE sector, where the NE end of a colonnade was uncovered, while to the E the E apse was completely cleared. To the S of the excavated area there are remains of a collonade with a stylobate made of local limestone, only partly preserved; a stone drain passing under the stylobate leads to a small semicircular structure. N of the peristyle lies a large stoa (43x9m), ending in the usual apses; only the foundations of the N stoa wall are preserved and thus the position of the original doorways is uncertain. N of the stoa, there is a large chamber, the N wall of which has been preserved to a considerable height. The architectural remains dated to LHL are part of a large building complex. During investigation outside, the foundations of a large building were found, dating to the 4th Ct BC (sherds,coins). Excavations continued on the pottery workshops (ADelt 35 Chr 395-6) to determine the plan of the building, and to study the LHL pottery. The existing remains consist of a series of 14 rooms arranged in pairs (prothalamos/thalamos type) with a door to the W; W of these rooms a single area was uncovered, running down their length, N-S. A stylobate lies further to the W and a deep earth-cut, covered drain. The rooms belong to a Stoa, not yet fully revealed. The finds from the destruction levels of the rooms are abundant, including pottery, over 100 moulds for relief skyphoi, amphorai, marble statues, etc. Section I, Square 2: The excavations N of the site that had been stopped in 1963 were continued in the hope that a more detailed picture of the houses at Pella would emerge. In the highest levels of a thick deposit (fill), much everyday pottery was found, including bronze coins of Philip II and one gold coin of Alexander the Great. Although the architectural remains were not satisfactorily preserved, a most interesting concentration of human skeletons at the entrance to the W part of the house, suggests an earthquake destruction. Cemetery. The excavation of the cemetery (end 5th/begin- ning 4th Ct BC), which had began in 1980 (ADelt 35 Chr 394- 5) continued. A large tomb of the beginning of the 4th Ct BC was excavated, cut into the rock, with uneven staircases at the E and S sides. It contained a female skeleton in the extended</page><page sequence="57">58 E. B. FRENCH position, while rectangular niches were found in the four corers of the tomb, including a few nails from the bier; a little pottery and jewellery was also reported. SW of the village, a large part of the Pella gymnasium plot was investigated. 13 test trenches were excavated, the majority yielding negative information although an entire room with a floor was eventually uncovered; S of this floor the paved courtyard of a house with a well was reported. 4 test trenches confirmed the presence of a road (6m wide) connecting this area to the Hippodameian town plan. Section IV Square 2: The excavation of the House with the Frescoes which had stopped in 1980, continued. The investiga- tion of the areas to the W of the peristyle was completed, revealing two large rooms with rectangular central hearths, while a number of other smaller areas were also uncovered, possibly part of the house, or a shop. A large female bust in clay and two large kantharoi were reported from the layer of tiles. Excavations also continued from last year W of the house, where the destruction layers were removed and a difference of level (80cms) was observed between the floors of this and the House with the Frescoes; part of a clay, covered drain runs through three continuous rooms. Walls, a floor and a threshold block of an earlier 4th Ct BC date were reported in the space N of the entrance to the House with the Frescoes. Finally, the excavation of a room S of the peristyle was completed; it appears to have been a raised platform with a single column in the centre, covered with red plaster. One of the most important finds of the excavation is a well-made stone peristyle, S of the House with the Frescoes; on its surface traces of four columns on each side were revealed, while on its lower S side the base of a well, or a cistern, like the Delian examples seems to belong to an earlier phase. E cemetery: Brief excavations were conducted in the so- called E cemetery; the burials belong mainly to the period of Philip II. Two cist tombs were discovered; in one, traces of fire were detected and gilt clay plaques were reported. The upper part of the inside of the tomb bore painted bands, the floor was covered with red plaster; on the S side, an offering bench was found. In the second tomb, three rock-cut steps were reported, while the burial itself was disturbed and looted. The interior was covered with white plaster and red bands, while the corpse appears to have been placed on a bier of wood and reeds. The offerings in the two pits included gold and bronze jewellery and clay vessels. House with the Porch: During work in 1976 for the water supply of Thessalonike, walls of a house were revealed in a test trench, which was later excavated (AD 31 Chr, 258). The house was similar to the one found in the 1973/4 excavations by Prof. Oikonomou. A hoard of 307 copper Rhodian coins (187-168 BC) was discovered under the floor of one of the rooms. The excavation which had been prematurely stopped, was resumed in 1981, revealing other areas of the house, as well as a second house E of it, dated to the LHL period. Although it was not well constructed, among the clay and pottery finds was a clay head of Herakles (315-20). Work in 1984 (including the find of a hoard of Athenian tetradrachms) is published in PAE 75-94. New inscriptions from Pella are published by M. Lilimpake-Akamate in Makendonika 26 (1987-8) 51-62. Palaia Pella: Rural Shrine. The excavation here, started in 1980 (ADelt 35 Chr 398), was completed in 1981 year. The investigation was limited to the interior of the circular enclos- ure, uncovering the floor of thick clay, into which 20 offering pits had been dug, mostly circular, in which animal bones and some bronze coins were found. In the centre there is an altar, renewed many times; the majority of the offerings came from around and on this altar (mostly clay idols of animals, humans, human parts, and a few pots). The shrine, which was devoted to Demeter and Kore, with accompanying worship of Artemis, and possibly other deities as well, was dated to the 2nd Ct (187/168) BC (320). Ptolemais. A marble funerary stele with relief decoration as well as two marble capitals were reported from Kardia. Chance finds (stone sculptures) were reported from Ano Kome as a result of deep ploughing, while a variety of antiquities were handed in from Elate (326). EASTERN MACEDONIA The 18th Ephorate reports on work in 1981 (ADelt 23 Chr 328-46). Alistrate. The presence of an anc. town is indicated by reports of tombs dating from the 4th Ct BC to HL and R, as well as funerary stelai and a R sarcophagus (345-6). Amphipolis. A considerable number of chance finds were taken to the Kabala Museum in 1981, including HL, R and ECh funerary stelai, an interesting R inscription in which Aulos Anthestios is honoured by the priest and followers of Isis, and part of a dedication with a list of names (345, texts not given). The work in 1984 is published in PAE 33-9. Excavation for the AS took place in 1989 on the gymnasium with K. Lazarides continuing the work of her distinguished father (Ergon 1989, 79-88). Detailed work on the xustos confirmed conclusions made previously (AR 1988-9, 81-2). A notable find was one of the starting gates, marked by poros blocks with sockets, set at an angle. Other blocks showed the position of string to delimit the sides of the track. The archeological evidence can be linked to description in an inscription found before the war. To the N a large and varied deposit of pottery can perhaps be associated with the cult of patron gods. The clearance of the paradromis was laborious but of extreme interest; this type of good-weather track is otherwise known only from Delphi. Its starting gate and settings for track marking strings were also found. N of the xustos a new building was cleared, 27.5x6.5m, with 3 rooms and entrance on the N. Four building phases were identified, of which the first two can be dated by coins to the 4th Ct BC and to ER. The area between the new building and the xustos forms a passage 2m wide which continues to the E and forms a peribolos to the new building, perhaps a stoa. Deposits of C and HL material show the importance of the complex. Work on Christian Amphipolis continued for the AS in 1989 under Ch. Bakirtzes (Ergon 1989, 88-90). The clearance of the W fortification was completed; towers existed at both the SW (tower B) and NW (tower 6). The former, at the end of the ECh period, was turned into a cistern; the latter was used either as a dwelling or for storage, as there is evidence of wooden roofing after the collapse of the upper part. Notable is the absence of any entrance in this W wall; thus Basilica Gamma also has no W entrance but one on the S. Further work on the clearance and stratigraphic investigation of</page><page sequence="58">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 59 Basilica Gamma was also undertaken. No later occupation level was found over the building after it went out of use at the end of the ECh period. It would seem that almost all its architectural elements were taken for use elsewhere. 728 fig. ). The main interest focuses on Sector V.A where at the W architecture of MN is overlaid by early LN levels. From the former, which was destroyed in a violent fire, came an oven containing a vessel still holding lentils, with an adjacent storage vessel containing over 1 kg of carbonised wheat (Fig. 50). A fixed millstone was found in another structure to the W, which again shows the heavy destruction level (Fig. 51). At the E of the sector, amid a general wealth of material, an important level of early LN produced a low platform bearing beads, a bovid horn, a female figurine, an incised bowl (Fig. 52), graphite painted ware, black on red ware, Maritsa ware, many animal jaws and a pounder. See also the account by Ch. Koukoule-Chrysanthake in Ergon 1989, 90-7. Fig. 51 Drama: Charitomene. The well-known large inscribed sarcophagus was moved to the Philippoi Museum (346). Photoleibos. A HL settlement was found at Islan Tepe by A. Samartzidou (346). Fig. 50 Chrysopolis. A. Dunn (BSA) reports on the end of the survey of visible remains in the Strymon delta. Comparisons were made between survey and magnetometer results which helped establish the lost course of the eastern part of the enceinte. The spur on the S wall may have been part of cross-wall system in a moat, the fore-walls now having disappeared (cf. the Theodosian walls in Constantinople). The magnetometer evidence indicated that a moat may have existed and could have been fed by the river some 200m. from the W wall. A revision to earlier plans must be made now that the existence has been certified of a postern gate on the S wall. Traces of a building to the N of the site may be the remains of an Athon- ite metochion tower. A geomorphological survey is still considered important to establish Chrysoupolis' origins which are still obscure. These may be explained by geomorphological changes in the S which made the site especially advantageous during the Med period (widely defined) as opposed to earlier or later periods (ADelt 36 Chr 365-7). Dikili Tash. (AR 1988-9, 83) Work by a joint Greek-French team continued in 1989. In a longer report R. Treuil describes work in Sectors II and V A (for a plan see BCH 112 (1988) Fig. 52 Eleutheropolis. In the modem cemetery at the foot of the acropolis (Paliampeli) (ADelt 34 Chr 332), a cist tomb of EHL times was reported, containing a hoard of 41 bronze coins (now in the Kabala Museum). On the hill N of the acropolis, a 5th-4th Ct BC inscribed funerary stele of schist was found, with the first inscriptional mention of the town of Phagresios (Herodotos' Phagre): Z(oCitKp&amp;Ti; /Kp coiKtva /Daypfato; (343-4).</page><page sequence="59">60 E. B. FRENCH Philippoi. The press reports the latest work by E. Psourkout- idou-Nikolaidou on Basilica Gamma by the Museum (AR 1988-89, 84). The three-aisled church, built in the early 6th Ct AD with many notable features, underwent radical rebuilding late in the century. Recent work has uncovered an ECh bapistery with lobby and two chambers which, transformed into a church, was in use until the 12th Ct AD. At Krinides Philippon excavations for the extension of the football grounds in 1978 (ADelt 23 Chr 292) had revealed walls; this year the investigation of the area was completed. It was confirmed that the area lies outside anc. Philippoi, E of the Acropolis. Three building phases and fragments of walls from two further phases, as well as seven tombs were reported. The dating of the structures ranges between LHL (Area la: plaster floor, walls), and R (Areas lb,2a,3: walls and two water reservoirs). Of the 7 LR tombs, in Areas 9b,and 9c, two were cist, the rest tile-roofed, with very few offerings. The only complete building complex discovered (Areas 4-8 and cisterns) is dated to the 5th-6th Ct AD; the walls were plastered on the inside, while the walls and floor of the reservoirs were covered with successive layers of hydraulic plaster. Their construction and arrangement is similar to that of the wine presses at Boirani, Drama (AE 1973 Chr 36-49). The debris piles found in the area may be connected with earlier buildings. Chance finds are reported from the modem village, includ- ing inscribed funerary stelai (no texts), sarcophagi,and column fragments of EHL date (341-2). Kourkoutidou-Nikolaidou opened a trench (16x8.50m) in the N part of the narthex of basilica E. There was a unified destruction layer 2.20m above the floor of the central aisle with masonry rubble and broken architectural members; 13 cist and 4 random graves were found therein. Evidence shows that the cemetery came into being when fill had been in place for some time, thus pointing to a 7th Ct destruction level. Part of the ambo balustrade was used in one grave, although no grave goods were found. Tomb 10 may contain burnt remains of a skimboda or bier used to carry and inter the dead. In the church itself, a ?9th-10th Ct mural of Ag. Akindynos. An interesting feature is the rectangular chest-shaped grave marker with walls of flat stone and broken marble plaques set upright in mortar to form a pattern. This may represent a family grave of the 8th-9th Ct. Graves on original floor are dated to the 7th Ct and include a family grave defined by a surrounding wall and including a column 0.85m. with a cross, which probably should be interpreted as a monument for the entire family, similar to later Byz grave markers (ADelt 36 Chr 363-5). Galepsos. A surface survey was conducted in 1981 by the Ephorate (B. Poulios) at the cave of Arkoudotrupa on Mt Pangaion, N of Galepsos; it was limited to the first two chambers of the cave, where a most interesting although disturbed deposit was recorded. The cave was apparently used from the EBA; the pottery (including well-known types such as fluted ware) equates with phases IV-V of Sitagroi, and EBA I-II of Dikili Tash. In addition 6th Ct BC-R pottery was possibly related to the worship of Dionysus. These EBA deposits may be the earliest habitation phase at Pangaion (344). Kabala. The old Tokos residence, formerly the town hall, was appropriated to house the Byzantine Ephorate's offices and fully repaired and restored. The pi-shaped two-storied Ott E. Pelteke house on Mehmet Ali 16 was also restored (ADelt 36 Chr 363). Nea Kerdyllia. (Anc. Argilos) A cist HL tomb was found near the second Macedonian tomb (ADelt 33 Chr 296); a 5th Ct BC tile-roofed tomb was probably part of a larger cemetery (345). Nea Peramos. The discovery of the A temple at Oisyme (AR 1987-8, 54-5) is reported with finds including the marble hand of a kore, pottery of the 7-6th Cts from Thasian workshops imitating Chian Orientalizing wares and 5th Ct Attic pottery. Below the floors are remains of EIA handmade wares and flint blades. This gives credence to the statement of Stephanos of Byzantium that the Thasian colony was founded on the site of Homeric Aisyme (Th. 697) (Akropolis 27.5.89). Thessalonike (12.7.89) also mentions work on the city wall. Nea Zichne. An A-C settlement was located at Bigles, 6-7km SW of the village by S. Samartzidou (346). Nikokleia. C and HL settlements have been located in the area, and a number of pots from illicit excavation confiscated (346). Ophrynio. The excavation at Tsardakia, begun in 1980 (ADelt 35 Chr 424), was completed in 1981. The basement of a large poros building, entered from the ground floor, was uncovered; the ceiling probably wooden, was supported by four octagonal poros piers, fully preserved, while the actual walls are mostly destroyed; the floor was paved. The finds included pithos fragments, storage amphorai, kantharoi, plates, and a hoard of bronze coins of Antigonos Gonatas, which date the destruction to the 3rd Ct BC. These were probably the basement store- rooms of a farm, or an inn on the anc. road going E. A Roman funerary stele was taken to the Kabala Museum (344-5). Oreskeia. A relief from the area of the anc. town was taken to the Kabala Museum (346). Pangaion. A joint research project of IGME and the Ephorate was started in 1981, related to the anc. metallurgical workings on Pangaion and their relation to the various surounding settlements. The first stage of this research included the systematic surface survey of the area, for the location of mines and settlements, especialy on the SW side of the Mt, where a number of new shafts were located. No diagnostic pottery was recorded in the shafts, except post Byz material related to the EOtt occupation of the area (344). Serres: Ag. Nikolaos Kamenikaia. The find at Besiktepe of the otherwise unknown 13th Ct AD metochion of the Chilan- dar Monastery is reported by P. Samsares in Makedonika 26 (1987-8) 191-220. Strymoniko. A cist tomb was reported with pottery dated in the second half of the 4th Ct BC (346). Terpni. A R stele with dedication to Zeus and Hera, a relief, and an Ionic capital were reported from the acropolis of Ag. Mandelios, where a LC, HL, and R town has been located (346). Thasos. Joint Greek-French work on the harbour, a cooper- ation between the Ephorate of Underwater Archaeology represented by A. Simosi and J.-Y. Empereur continued in 1989 for a 5th season (AR 1988-9, 97 for refs). Work was</page><page sequence="60">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 61 largely concentrated on NE section where both the quay (of handsome cut blocks Fig. 53) and the outer breakwater were further investigated. Dating of the former is secure to the 5th Ct BC on the evidence of diverse but contemporary pottery types. In tracing the lower levels pottery of the A period was discovered for the first time (EGk and parts of 2 Clazomenian amphorai). Near the 'Red Light' investigation continued of a wall made up of much spolia including an important inscribed statue base refering to Pompey (Fig. 54, no text given). Fig. 53 In collaboration with the Ephorate at Kabala, the French School completed work on the kiln site at Psari in the SW of the island. The Parian influence in the pottery is particularly important (Kathemerine 28/1/90). The excavations in the anc. town and the cemeteries were continued in 1981 and are reported in detail with plans by the Ephorate (328-41). Near the Herakleion and the Hypostyle Chamber a plot was expropriated where a test excavation in 1979 and 1981 had revealed the presence of R house remains above a 4th Ct BC phase. Among the portable finds from new work by M. Karamberi, are 55 bronze coins (4th-3rd Ct BC, R &amp; LR), small metal objects, pots, large marble fragments, etc. Near the S wall and the modem cemetery of Limenas an area was excavated by M. Karamberi. Part of a R cemetery, with impressive monuments, only the bases of which survived, was discovered; the superstructure had been robbed out and scattered. At the foundation level, a group of child burials was found and a second group of similar tombs below (tile-roofed, cists, urns). The marble funerary monuments included two with inscriptions: ...THXIMQNTOY FYNH.../...TAZKEYAZ- AXA TOOE... and EIPHNHAPHAOZFYNHAE/ MHTPOAfPOYTOYNEIKHDOPOY/ NEIKHDOP- OMHTPOAQPOYYIO, four platforms, a small looted sarcophagus, three marble enclosures, and a large cist tomb with 13 skulls in the S section. In addition to these, 11 cist tombs were found, with very few offerings, 14 tile-roofed tombs, four graves, and three open burials, all dated between the st-4th Cts AD. In the Koutsoukos plot where a large area had been exca- vated in 1977, 1979 and 1980 (ADelt 32 Chr 241-2, 34 Chr 322, 35 Chr 419), two building phases were reported by B. Poulios. To the first phase, dated to the 6th-5th Ct BC, belong parts of seven walls, 20 Thasian amphorai and two hydriai, found upside down. To the second phase, dated to the 4th Ct BC, belong nine walls, four of which were reused from the earlier phase. Among the finds are included an intact bg kyathos, with a graffitto reading KIInO, under the base, and part of a bg plaque incised with AP. In the Georgalis plot a new trench (6) was opened by trench 2 of 1979 (ADelt 34 chr 329). Three phases could be distin- guished. The first phase, dated to LHL-ER, includes an open marble drain and a water supply system of clay. The second phase (R) comprised a road with an extensive covered drainage system (a continuation of the road on the line of the Heracles/- Dionysus Gate) with house walls on either side. The third phase (LR), includes two walls, a marble threshold, and a small built drain. Fig. 54 By the agora (and the Museum) an area with two succesive building phases of R date was cleared by A. Tasia, the earlier one represented only by fragmentary remains; the later R phase is more interesting, including a house with an open interior courtyard, a central hearth, and an underground built drain at the SE side. A considerable part of the paving of the yard is preserved, including the doorway and threshold. A group of rooms to the NW and S of the courtyard was also investigated, as well as part of an interesting mosaic floor. The finds include large amounts of R pottery, 80 bronze R and LR coins, a marble female head, part of a marble basin, etc. SE of the agora and Odeion part of a road was uncovered between two parallel walls, including an underground drain. Parallel to the road, a paved area was discovered, probably a yard, which continued to the next plot. Part of an apsidal construction, belonging to a circular building of this LR phase, also continued E. SW of the Odeion a section of the R building found in the plot next to the Odeion, was found by S. Samartzidou. It</page><page sequence="61">62 E. B. FRENCH consisted of a paved courtyard with a stylobate and areas to the NE and SE of the yard; drums of two unfluted columns and three small capitals from the peristyle, as well as an open drain were also reported. Next to the N exterior wall, part of a paved road was found as well as an underground drain, connected to the E road of the agora. Kinoira Gold Mines. The 'Klisidi' peak, towering over Palaiochori Koinuroi, itself investigated in 1979/80, was part of the common research program conducted by IGME, the Max Plank Institute at Heidelberg, the local Ephorate, and the French School. This year's research included a general surface survey of the area, 'Phanos' and 'Klisidi', for the location of other mine shafts and a specialized physiochemical research project in a mine shaft located in 1980, (BCH 106 (1982) 413). In the surface survey a considerable number of anc. mine shafts were located (TG El TG El0), an indication that many more may yet be found. Characteristic is the concentration of shafts and metallurgical debris at the hill E of the TG 80 El mine, recalling Herodotos description (VI 47); they are dated to the 4th-3rd Ct BC. The investigation in the TG El mine, revealed that the entrance way to the shaft was a small vertical opening, continuing into a long corridor running downhill. The floor of the main chamber is now 8m deeper than the corridor level, although part of it was covered by the collapsed roof. From this chamber started other shafts, while ancient chisel marks are still visible. From the pottery it would seem that the earliest use of the mine can be dated back to the 6th-5th Ct BC. Lead/Copper Mines of SW Thasos. The research project, which had started in 1979, investigated ancient mine shafts at the sites of 'Boubes', 'Kourlou', 'Koumaria', and 'Skries', in the area of Limenaria-Marion. At 'Boubes' modem mining has destroyed most ancient evidence; a settlement was located 2km E. of the mines at 'Bambakies', dated to the 4th Ct BC. At 'Kourlou', more evidence has been preserved, but no diagnos- tic sherds were found. At 'Koumaria', although modem mining has destroyed most evidence, excavations were conducted in the interior of an anc. mine shaft (K54-10, 4th-3rd Ct BC). Of the same date is the building complex, 60m E. of the shaft, probably the living quarters for the miners. At 'Skries', extensive mining operations for the production of lead and copper in the area were apparent; a tower near the debris could be dated by surface sherds from the 4th Ct BC down to R times. An ochre mine at 'Tzines' was reported, lying 7m above the modem mine level; inside the chamber many bone and stone tools were found. An investigation of the copper mines with reference to the copper objects from Kastri was organised by the Ephorate and IGME. The most important ores lie in the Makryrache region. In the interior of the shaft, which reveals advanced mining techniques (stairs, niches for lamps), a layer of tile fragments and Thasian pottery with traces of fire was found. Thermoluminescence dating places the pottery in the HL period. Antiquities were reported from Potos (4th-3rd Ct BC building, ?tower), and at Skala-Maries (tower, 4th Ct BC-R). Interesting remains were found of a LR structure consisting of a pi-shaped colonnade with an equal number of stoas on each side and a podium at the W wall. The central courtyard (13x11m) remained open. An honorific inscription to a citizen Dionysodoros was reused in the construction: O AHMOE /[T]ON AIONYZOAQPOY /THZ ENEKA KAI AIA TAS TOY /nANTOS AYTOY FENOY[E] /.]N FONEf2N EI THN nOAI[N] /[EY]EPFEZIAZ. Three levels were identified: a (top) destruction layer dated to 4th Ct (R and LR pottery and coins); an earth layer +/- 70cm with no trace of human habitation; and a layer Post-Byz to present (mostly pottery, Ott coins) above. Of special interest are two parts of a terracotta wall-crown with egg and dart decoration below and painted meander pattern in grey and black above. This must have originated in an older neighbour- ing structure. A 2nd Ct AD male statue fragment and part of an ECh templon balustrade probably from the neighbouring transverse basilica were also found (ADelt 36 Chr 357-61). Zabarnikeia. Possible remains of the site mentioned in Byz monastic acta of the late 11th Ct were discovered 25 km W of Mikro Souli, Serres, at a small Byz single-naved church adjoining a Byz tower. Architectural members re-used include a milliarium of the Egnatia Odos (ADelt 36 Chr 357). THRACE The 19th Ephorate reports on work in 1981 in ADelt 36 Chr 349-54. Abdera. (AR 1988-9, 84-5) The clandestine excavation of 2 sarcophagi is reported (Nike 3.3.90). The 1978 excavations (PAE 76-9), W of the gateway where part of an extensive Ch cemetery was uncovered, were continued in 1981. The Ch tombs already investigated (PAE 1979, 101-5) were removed and another group of 19 tombs revealed, most of the same type (cist) as the previous group. The tombs were built over or among LR/ECh ruins; when this lower level was further investigated, the N continuation of wall A was revealed, belonging to the same building and associated with a clay drain and a floor base W of A. In this floor, a large pithos was reported, 1.10m in diam., only the bottom half of which was preserved; another section of the floor W of wall D is partly covered by a burnt destruction layer. It seems that here, after the destruction and abandonment of the C fortifications, some makeshift structures were built in the W Gate area, in LR-EByz times, reusing the old material. In the next phase, when the site was not habitable any more, the area was used as an extensive cemetery of mainly cist graves, later than the 9th Ct AD. Among the very few finds recorded, from the various periods, were 4th-3rd Ct BC coins (Abdera, Thasos), a 2nd Ct AD lamp, and a clay bust of Dionysus. A destruction layer reported in the area of the N tower, with Cor tiles, can be dated to the 4th-3rd Ct BC (coins, stamped Thasian amphorai). At Touzla-Giol in the necropolis of Abdera roadworks revealed three poros and two clay sarcophagi, only one of which was partly intact (female burial). In the same area another large clay sarcophagus was reported, with a pedimental lid and initialized by the maker (M). The interior was full of earth; the skeleton was covered by a thick layer of sand. This type of sarcophagus can be dated to the 4th Ct BC. Two other poros sarcophagi were reported at the site of Tsakal Tepe, both looted (349-51). Work in 1984 is published in PAE 1-11 (note the PCor pottery). In 1989 Ch. Koukoule-Chrysanthake continued her work for the AS (Ergon 1989, 97-105) in the area outside the NW corner of the N enclosure where the shrine of a female deity marked by hearth/altars, with overburden of HL tombs, had been</page><page sequence="62">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 63 identified.The monumental stair, now completely cleared, served also as terraching for the shrine; it was later covered by the deposit from the shrine with masses of offerings; there are now nearly 10,000 miniature hydriai. A 2nd Ct BC tile- covered grave and a cremation in a bg hydria overlay the shrine and the steps, giving a terminus ante quem for the destruction of the shrine. The shrine deposit has now been fully cleared; it does not extend N of the stair. Deterioration in the condition of a horse burial (with an iron spearhead in the neck) found in 1982 (AR 1984-5, 50) necessi- tated the lifting of the bones, and the clearance of the grave. Items of iron harness were found. In the complex on the Makres land, discovered in 1983, work was resumed to investigate the destruction level in area b of building II. This can now be dated to the second half of the 4th Ct BC and belongs to the second phase of building II. The excavation was not completed but work was carried out too on the earlier phase (also 4th Ct), when area a was larger and had stone paving. There is also evidence of 5th Ct occupation in the area which is near the harbour. Geophysical work was also carried out by the University of Thessalonike, notably in the area of the supposed harbour. Alexandroupolis. E. Skarlatidou reported the discovery in 1981 of ten tile-roofed tombs, some of which were badly destroyed. T IV , a female burial, contained much jewellery (dated by coins of Constantius II, 346-354 AD). Ts VI and X were also rich in offerings (4th Ct AD, 1st Ct AD respective- ly), while T VII was a two storey tomb, the W part of which was destroyed; the upper part was empty, while the skeleton lay in the lower section and can be dated to the 2nd-4th Cts AD. Finally, TIX contained two adult burials, one over the other, covered with pebbles; the 27 coins found in the tomb date the burials to 360-363 AD. The number of roof tiles scattered all over the area, suggest the existence of more tombs. One more tile-roofed, two storey tomb was uncovered in another plot, containing an adult burial, with a bronze disc shaped object at its feet. The discovery of 11 tombs in the two plots, suggest the existence of an extensive cemetery of the 1 st-4th Cts AD, under the modem town, which has been already identified as anc. Salis (351-3). Didymoteicho. The N section of the fortification wall of anc. Plotinopolis, for a length of 7.90m, was uncovered by E. Skarlatidou. Here it turns N, forming a corer, while the whole structure can be dated to the 4th-5th Ct AD. It would seem that a fortification wall was built along the N side of the hill in EByz times, but a little later, the danger from the N (Goths) caused the construction of a proper fort in the 3rd-4th Ct AD (353-4). Komotini. The opening of a Byzantine Museum is announced in the press (Thessalonike 26.10.89). Makri. Reports have appeared of recent finds at this important prehistoric and historic site. PR levels, unlike the later, were undisturbed and produced both architecture and finds (pottery, figurines, obsidian blades) (Eleutherotipia 28/8/89). The ancient name of the town, part of the Peraea of Samothrace, is not yet identified. Maroneia. (AR 1988-9, 86-7) Work in 1984 is published in PAE 31-2. In 1989 E. Pentazos for the AS was unable to conducted new excavation (Ergon 1989, 105) but confined himself to surface survey in the area. In addition to the 36 known sites, 4 fortified settlements, 9 unfortified and 6 farmsteads were identified, as well as 6 cemeteries and other antiquities. Study of the finds has begun to allow dating. Ag. Charallambos. (AR 1988-9, 87) Th. Aliprantes con- tinued his excavation for the AS in 1989 (Ergon 1989, 106-7) particularly to the NE of the N aisle of the church which must have been the Cathedral of the MByz bishopric. Marble slab flooring was cleared in the N aisle; the public cistern and lavatory, built in 1974, was removed from over the narthex. Many finds came from the area outside the church, notably frescoes, architectural fragments (including a 1 lth-12th Ct AD lion's head) and quantities of varied MByz pottery. The most important find, however, still to be elucidated was a vaulted structure in two sections, integral with the church, again at the N. Mesembria. (AR 1988-9, 87) The press reports the discovery of an extensive complex lying near the A Temple of Apollo identified last year, but dating to periods later than the Temple. Notable is the quantity of inscribed sherds, which must be linked to the cult (13.9.89). Work in 1984 is published in PAE 18-30. Polystylo. Work in 1984 is published in PAE 12-17. Porto-Lago. Work continued on a E.S.F. and C.G.H.B. funded project for the location of Byz coastal settlements and three borings were made to establish pottery and mollusc stratigra- phies (cf. Activite Byzantine. Rapports des missions effectuees en 1981. E.S.F. 57-104). Rhodoleibos: Ekklisoudes. A LR settlement was uncovered 1 km S of the village at the foot of Mt. Pangaios (ADelt 36 Chr 357). Rizia (Ebrou). Work on this EIA site in 1984 is published PAE 95-106. Samothrace. Study of materials from excavations in the Sanctuary of the Great Gods by a team under the direction of J.R. McCredie for the ASCS took place in 1989. Studies were conducted in the storerooms of the museum and on the site, as follows: Western Hill. The actual-state plan and sections (scale 1:50) of the area excavated in 1986-1988 were completed. A survey of the marble blocks discovered on the Western Hill between 1965 and 1988 was completed, and additional members belonging to the doors of the neorion were identified. Study of the architectural terracottas of the neorion and reconstruction of that building's sima and antefix were completed. Study of the wall stucco of the neorion was completed, which yielded a general understanding of its scheme, although the material is too fragmentary to permit a detailed restoration. The Byz glazed pottery was collected from the dozens of context groups in which it was stored. It proved to belong to a limited number of vases, several of which could be partially restored. Stoa. The actual-state plan of the Stoa was compared with the remains, to verify that it accurately records dowling and other technical features. All blocks belonging to the eutynteria, toichobate, and wall binders of the Stoa were surveyed, to</page><page sequence="63">64 E. B. FRENCH verify that no technical features had been overlooked. Final preparation of the publication of ceramics from the fill of the Stoa was completed and new photographs of the material were made. Nike Monument. The ceramics and stucco recovered during conservation of the monument's retaining walls in 1983 were surveyed and studied. The results of earlier excavations were reviewed in the light of more recent discoveries in the Sanctu- ary, and a tentative history of the Nike Monument and its appearance were developed. In the Museum all fragments of under life sized marble sculpture were surveyed, in connection with the study of a fine, late Hellenistic head recovered in 1988. Two decrees recovered in 1986 and 1988, which deal with relations between Maroneia and the Roman Emperor Claudius were studied and improved texts prepared. The press reports the find by D. Matsas of a major 4th Ct amphora workshop with two kilns on the beach by the Baths of the island. The many wasters bear the usual handle stamps and prove that not only the wine but the containers were local produce (Nea 26.10.89). NORTHEAST AEGEAN ISLANDS Chios: The press reports (6.7.89) on the discovery of 6 HL tombs on Kountouriotou containing skeletal remains and jewellery. The discovery of R marble sculpture (Nike, seated Cybele, head of Athena and a young man, stele with Artemis carrying a torch, protome of Zeus Ammon, et al.) in current work by the Ephorate is widely reported in the press (inc. Auge 10.4.90). At Mesta the church of Palaios Taxiarches (Byz or Genoese vaulted single-nave with stucco cross-dome on N aisle) was found to contain quality murals dated by donor inscription to 1503 (Deisis and Archangel Michael) under more a recent lime mortar layer. Conservation work is underway (ADelt Chr, 386). Lemnos: Chloi. Work under L. Beschi of the Italian School continued in 1989 with the study of the material from two trials which produced pottery of LC/HL and LG/first half of the 7th Ct BC respectively. The latter deposit, a deliberate accumulation, after destruction or earthquake showed clear stratigraphy which has allowed the formulation of important stylistic and morphological criteria for the study of the pottery development. Lesbos. The work of the Ephorate in 1986 and 1987 is reported in detail in Lesbiaka 12 and summarized here. Skala Eresou. 1986: In a rescue excavation near the shore, NW of the Acropolis, c. 100m NW of the stream bed that runs to the shore, there was found part of the city wall, 5.1m long and 3m wide, in the pseudo-isodomic style. On what was the edge of the anc. city to the N at Ag. Andreas and Samphous, a R bath was uncovered. Parts of the hypocaust and the floor above it were preserved. On Bouboulinos there was found part of an ECh building with mosaic floor showing geometric patterns and crosses. 1987: from the area of Ag Paulos, NE of the acropolis, came a representation of Cyblele in low relief. Methymna. 1986: NE of the moder town, where one of the cemteries of the anc. city lay, were found 4 clay sarcopha- gi. 3 of these had been robbed completely and damaged. The whole skyphos and idols in the other were dated to the 4th Ct BC. Also dug up in this area were 2 grey ware vases of the A period, 2 bf lekythoi, a small jug, a tall painted open vase and 4 brooches of Asia Minor type (exact dating not given). 2 other graves of irregular stones were uncovered. These had 4 bronze brooches, a bronze necklace, part of a bronze and gold ear-ring and a tall skyphos (no dating given). NE of the Kastro, part of an wall was found 3 courses high of isodomic construction. (This may be part of the wall labelled 'y-y-y' by Buchholz (N. Spencer, BSA).) 1987: Opposite the primary school were HL graves. In the SW of this area a group of 8 cist graves was found with no funerary gifts. They were made of small stones and were lying above the clay sarcophagi of earlier graves. Below one of these graves was found for the first time the PR stratum of the city where grey ware sherds and bone tools were found. In the Dabia area during road widening there were found 5 graves with clay sarcophagi with pottery dated to the second half of the 6th Ct BC, including Attic bf. In this deposit there was also a bronze mirror. Mytilene. 1986: N of the theatre at the rear of the Ag. Kyriakes cemetery, a further part of the N section of the city wall was uncovered (8.2m long and 3.49m wide). The outer face was of rectangular blocks while the inner is of polygonal blocks of grey limestone, dating to the 3rd quarter of the 5th Ct BC. 21m N of here, outside the line of the city wall, is a proteichisma wall faced with small irregular blocks which in many places is built on graves of the anc. graveyard which lay outside the city wall. Lower in the town itself part of the C city wall was found on Ekatoneson, 10m long and 3.7m wide. The lowest course of this wall (third quarter of the 5th Ct BC) is built on bedrock, of rectangular limestone blocks. In the Epano Skala area of the town (near the N harbour) on Longou, a structure of small dimensions was found with to the N the store of a temple, full of animal bones, sea-shells, idols of different periods and pottery spanning from A to R. On Theolutou a R building that had been first seen in 1981 was now fully excavated. It had two successive mosaic floors, dated merely to 'R times'. On Kioutacheias there was already known an ECh house with mosaic floor; this was cleared and revealed an underground stoa. There was a tradition that at this part of the city there had been an underground passage from the castle; the stoa dates to R times. On Kampa 2 cist graves of the end of the 2nd Ct BC were found, dated by the find of an oil jar and a bronze mirror (no pottery reported). 1987: Epano Skala, on Longou at a depth of 3.5m part of an apsidal building was uncovered; the walls were of small irregular stones and mud was used as the joining material. A cross-wall of larger stones cuts across the building. A PG amphora and 3 grey ware vases were found. This is the same plot which had the temple storage room (see above) which had pottery from all periods from the 10th Ct BC to 2nd Ct AD. On the hill of the Acropolis by the Kioski was found the temple of Aphrodite; the finds dated mainly from 1st Ct BC- 1st Ct AD. A statue of Aphrodite and 25 bronze coins were found. Near the S Harbour (on Maniate) a cist tomb was found, cut in the bed-rock, orientated N-S. In the SE corer there were sherds of a grey ware amphora of the first half of the 6th Ct BC. Gifts to the Mytilene Museum in 1987 and 1988 include pieces of statuary and stelai of various periods, a small Ionic capital, a 3rd Ct BC Rhodian amphora (all found in or close to the city), 3 PR vases from B. Tampakepros (no provenance given); a necklace of gold and semi-precious stones found in the sea between Lesbos and Lemnos. Excavations by H. Williams for the Canadian Institute in 1989 were conducted at two sites. In the area of the Demeter</page><page sequence="64">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 65 Sanctuary: "The upper levels of the new trenches uncovered more elements of a series of superimposed Turkish structures dating back to the 16th Ct to the late 18th; three distinct levels lie on top of each other, all beneath the open square that seems to have been left after earthquake clean up about 1800. The architecture and associated finds, mostly ceramic but a large quantity of tobacco pipes, add further to our knowledge of Turkish Mytilene. The presence of a gold coin, probably 18th Ct, is unusual given the total absence of other Turkish coins from the site; European, Chinese and Persian ceramics testify to the apparent prosperity and sophistication of at least some of the inhabitants. The need to excavate the Turkish levels carefully slowed down progress on revealing the Demeter sanctuary but is at least putting historical archaeology on a firm basis at last for the NE Aegean. Unfortunately the Turkish buildings and Byz predecessors have eradicated all traces of activity after c. 50 AD everywhere so far excavated on the castle. Indeed it is puzzling that no find from the mid-ist to 10th Cts has yet been made in the castle although there is ample evidence from the lower town that Mytilene was a flourishing metropolis through- out much of this period and that even in the nadir of the Dark Ages it was a major centre of Byz activity on Lesbos. New trenches were opened both N and S of previously excavated areas with the expectation of further remains of the sanctuary and its structures. As earlier discoveries ran into both scarps the completion of their uncovering was expected; what was unexpected was the discovery of a large rubble foundation to the S, apparently the remains of yet another altar, and a smaller ashlar foundation to the N, perhaps the same. Between the hearth altar and the step altars found in earlier seasons a small rectangular rubble platform was uncovered. It could have served as yet another altar or could have been a base for something like a table of offerings. The southernmost feature was of a rectangle with what appears to be a semicircular feature on its E side; immediately S of it were the remains of both an earlier kalderimi and, above it, the 19th Ct one that still forms the main road through the castle. The pottery associated with the lowest level of the new feature is LC-EHL although there is some Turkish material from garbage pits that had been dug down to bedrock. Again, above it is a layer of late 1st Ct BC - mid 1st Ct AD that seems to mark the end of the sanctuary. This level appears to extend right across the site as if it had been brought in as a levelling course. It is marked by a variety of local and imported fine wares and lamps as well as coarse and kitchen wares. While there is no physical evidence to support the identification of the new feature as certainly an altar - few traces of burning, for example - its location and shape seem to support this possibility. The northernmost feature is equally difficult to identify with certainty: again it is a rectangular foundation on line with the definite altars. Close by is a votive pit, partly built up and partly cut out of bedrock, that contained three phialai similar to others found in the sanctuary and some miniature hydriai, the typical offering (along with terracotta figurines). Excavation to the W in search of structures associated with the altars uncovered the usual sequence of Turkish-ER-HL/LC. Earlier seasons had revealed a large rectangular one with rubble walls still 0.5m high in places as well as scattered walls from others, some puzzlingly placed back to back. Further excavation of the latter revealed in fact that one 'wall' was in fact a bench 50cm wide on the inner face of the wall. Two rooms with these benches were uncovered; unfortunately neither is complete but they find their best parallel at Corinth where over 20 such dining rooms have been identified in the Demeter sanctuary on the slopes of Acrocorinth. The large room is partly divided by a N-S wall but no trace of a floor level appeared (few floors have been isolated in any of the castle trenches); on the other hand several rich deposits of terracotta figurines that had been buried together during periodic clean outs of the sanctuary (possibly originally at another place) enhanced our knowledge of the local coroplastic industry further. More male figures and even a model terracotta meal added new types to the burgeoning corpus. Two folded lead curse tablets with eight or nine lines of text (still unread) were also found in this area. Perhaps the most significant find in the castle this year, however, seems to have come from the periphery of the sanctuary: in a 5x5m trench dug 10m to the N of the altars in the hope of finding a temenos; wall bedrock was reached after nearly 3m of Turkish earthquake debris under which lay R and HL fills. In the fill above and around bedrock, which is very irregular in this area, were numerous fragments of broken up andesite A Ionic and Doric columns. From the former were also several large pieces of a horizontally fluted base element and a small piece of bead and reel moulding that went either between base and lowest column drum or top drum and capital. A Ionic architecture is of course extremely rare and the large size of the base element - 83cm across - implies a building, almost certainly a temple, of considerable dimen- sions. The presence of several Doric flutes in the same material and scale may even suggest a temple of mixed orders. At nearby Assos there is an andesite Doric temple with an Ionic frieze outside and it might not be surprising therefore to find one at Mytilene in the late 6th Ct BC." The other area of concentration this year was "the middle Byz church revealed straddled by the 19th Ct mosque in 1986. Much of its E end was excavated to bedrock in order to determine if any Demeter sanctuary material might be found there and to attempt to determine the form of its S side. While several undisturbed Byz burials were uncovered, no evidence was found that the sanctuary extended this far S. The excava- tion at the SE corer revealed a 4.5m deep cistern that may have been added when the church was converted to a mosque after 1462; unfortunately the cistern contained only cleanup debris from the late 18th Ct earthquake that destroyed the church/mosque. Joint excavations with the Ephorate continued at a large site near the N Harbour in the lower town where further work was carried out on the LC city wall, a large R peristyle building with extensive HL industrial dumps below it and A buildings below them, and R to C remains below a recently removed large public toilet on the edge of the site. Just below the paved level of the Greek stables that occupied the site after 1923 we excavated a number of 19th Ct Turkish burials; below them were remains of a well-built wall that to judge from assocated pottery is the first medieval structure that we have found in the lower site. Most of it lies under the adjacent moder road (Dikili). Below it we reached the corer of a modest building of the HL period, one of a number of simple structures that seem to have occupied the space between the city wall around the original island settle- ment and the channel that separated it until the Middle Ages from the mainland. On the other side of the site (Nikomedia) there was direct access to levels of the early 1st Ct AD; below this were mortared foundations of what seems to be a number of</page><page sequence="65">66 E. B. FRENCH adjacent rooms of uncertain purpose, containing complete Attic bg drinking vessels. As sondages in the adjacent city wall confirmed a 4th Ct BC date - early or late is still not clear - the nature of this part of the site at the time of the famous Athenian siege of Mytilene in 427 BC is still unclear; ground water levels made a complete investigation of the foundations of the wall difficult until permanent pumps were installed late in the season and it is conceivable that the wall we see today was just rebuilt in the 4th Ct. A few more metres of the city wall as it ran into the E edge of the site were recovered; it had been robbed out to its lowest course above anc. ground level and modem disturbances extended down nearly 3m in places. The masonry was polygonal in its lowest courses. below them, A. From the packing itself, however, was recovered some Candarll ware usually dated to c. 300 AD thus establighing a much later date for at least the installation of the floor than had hitherto been believed. Puzzling too was the presence of a number of small Turkish sherds in what is visibly a completely sealed late R level. Pyrra: Achladeri. SW of anc. Pyrrha at Geniotos lay the necropolis. Here was found a child burial deposited in a PG hydria. 2 fragments of iron spearheads were included in the vessel and grey ware sherds were found nearby. CYCLADES, ETC. The 21st Ephorate reports on earthquake damage to the monuments, and on its other work in 1981 in ADelt 36 Chr 368-80. The 2nd Byzantine Ephorate reports on conservation and recording throughout the Archipelago (ADelt 36 Chr 381- 5). Fig. 56 Andros. The Bisti tower at Apatouria, one of the few Post- Byz structures of this type to survive on the island, was restored. A Byz display was organized for the Archaeological Museum at Chora, including 30 Byz and Post-Byz relief architectural members, some of fine quality with lion, griffin and acanthus decoration (ADelt 36 Chr 381-5). Fig. 55 Limited excavations also took place in the R peristyle building at the other side of the site. Pumping allowed limited further testing of the A levels in the W Room that produced further Wild Goat style pottery of the late 7th Ct BC in a level associated with a roughly built stone wall at right angles to the fine later 6th Ct BC ashlar that eventually was reused as a foundation for the R building. Similarly in the area outside the E Room a drop in water level allowed excavation to virgin soil (or mud) and the recovery of considerable amounts of 6th Ct BC local grey wares. Perhaps the most significant of these small scale excavations were in the N Room where two further sondages were carried out by cutting the thick, hard, well-built mortar packing for a marble pavement that had been covered by a 50cm thick abandonment level of tiles and pottery datable to the first half of the 4th Ct AD. Once again directly below the packing were HL levels and traces of walls and cobbled pavements and Delos. In 1989 the French School worked in three areas. Cleaning of the Theatre (AR 1988-9, 88-9) by J.-Ch. Moretti revealed that the koilon had been built by separate contractors working from the two ends. Minor differences in their work became apparent (Figs. 55, 56). In a final season of excavation on the Farmstead 'aux jambages' (AR 1988-9, 89) by M. Brunet it was possible to work out the original plan of the building and trace the various alterations. New work was initiated by A. Famoux by the apsidal building (39), with the aim of restoring the surrounding paving slabs, investigating their relation to the building and producing a new stratigraphic sequence for Myc level (known from the S). The paving was lifted and excavation beneath sucessfully carried out revealing important information about the area, but dating will only be possible when the material has been studied. In Ergon 1989, 160-6, Ph. Zapheiropoulou reports on the work of conservation and restoration undertaken by the Greek authorities.</page><page sequence="66">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 67 Ikaria: Chrysomilia. At Ag. Triada, a rectangular marble building of isodomic masonry was reported in 1981; marble architectural remains were scattered over the slope, some of them reused in the moder church; it was probably part of a HL tower (379). Kamari. (W of Phouroi) A settlement of 'late antiquity' was reported in 1981, with remains of buildings extending to and into the sea; rectangular rooms are visible through the shallow water. On the hill, at the Taxiarchoi church, unfluted granite, poros, and marble columns are noted, brought from a major structure on an adjacent hill (now lost); there is evidence for grave robbing in the area (379) Kambos. (Anc. Oenoe) The anc town has not been found though known from inscriptions and coins; although the plot excavated in 1981 lies near the area where the 4th Ct BC town is supposed to be, the architectural remains found (two walls at right angles with a courtyard in the middle and 3 other rooms) were probably part of a building of a later date (378- 9). Phournoi. A marble sarcophagus was partly excavated in 1981 and was then covered up, awaiting future excavation; it was probably part of a cemetery. NE of Kambos, at Ag. Georgios, remains of an anc. acropolis were identified (HL,R) in 1981; at the top and on the W side, walls and rectangular houses were preserved. On the W side of the hill, outside the walls, rectangular cut- tings/niches were recorded; on the S side, a circular base was cut in the rock. Finally, in the area surrounding the wall, there are foundations of buildings and inscriptions on rocks: OEEQN /ZAMOOPAKQN /KQN, and ...NOAOTO/...AIXKOY /...EPMHI (378). Nas. Ergon 1989, 126-30 reports the reopening of excava- tion at the site of the temple of Artemis Tauropolos. Two seasons of work had been carried out by L. Politis in 1938-9 but the finds had largely disappeared during the war. F. Zapheiropoulou for the AS carried out a short season in 1989 on the two main areas recorded. The Temple at the N seems originally to have had only one room and then been expanded to 3; many Cor and marble roof tiles, architectural fragments, figurines and pottery (5th/4th Cts BC) were found. By the Foundation, as Politis called it, the clearance of debris was difficult but lower levels rich in 7th Ct Orientalizing material were reached. Luristan and other E bronzes, much pottery as well as charcoal and animal bones attest a rich cult centre. The many marble architectural fragments concentrated here (by the moder lime kilns) show that the marble used for the buildings was not local. Pyrgos Drakanou. Immediate conservation was reported as necessary on the circular tower and the fortification walls of this important fort after the 1981 earthquake (379). Kimolos. Wide-scale restoration and structural reinforcement was carried out on the Med castle (ADelt 36 Chr 381). Melos. The catacombs have been listed as 'International Heritage' by UNESCO (Eleutherotypia 3.9.89). In spring 1989, a survey was conducted by G. Sanders, Assistant Director of the BSA. 35 known sites of EC, LG/A, R and Post-R date were selected for study. Habitation pottery was found at certain EC cemetery sites and three EC stone axes were found. Obsidian scatters suggested that blade production was a specialized industry limited to a small number of sites. G sites were disappointing but one A site, Kambos, proved to be a late 6th Ct pottery workshop and at a second, Emborio, late 7th and early 6th Ct pottery was found including column kraters, plates, cooking wares and several sherds of a relief stand. Two C Tower sites were planned. At Zephyria, an inscribed marble epistyle block, from the monu- ment of Mithridates on Delos was found. Many LR industrial sites were examined showing evidence for large scale extrac- tion from the 4th to 7th Cts. Three sites showed evidence of occupation into the 9th Ct. A large number of EByz reliefs and church furniture were recorded. 13th Ct pottery at Anokastro and 14th at the Zephyria quarries are indicative of their date. Immediate attempts were made to forestall damage caused by rain to the catacombs (ADelt 36 Chr 381). Mykonos: Chalara. A water reservoir was reported by O. Chatzianastasiou consisting of a rectangular rock-cut basin, covered with granite slabs. 3kms SW of this, a rectangular building built of rectangular blocks of granite, possibly a tower, was noted (380). Naxos. In the E mountainous area a PR fortification has been excavated by G. Mastroropoulos, a double wall some 70m long with external semicircular towers (Nea 26.10.89). Cave of Zeus. An account the progress of this important excavation is given in Kathemerine 3.9.89. Town. S. of the moder cemetery a chance find of a tomb (Ti), with marble lining, was excavated by B. Lambrinoudakis. The deposit in a nearby plot (part of the extensive G-R cemetery which encircles the anc. town) was covered by a layer of sand which contained fragmentary HL idols and sherds of various periods. A total of 15 burials including inhumations, ur burials and cremations was discovered, in cists and simple pits. E of T 1 a pyre was recorded, with fragments of idols underneath, while to the S, three funerary urns were buried in a hollow, surrounded by a semicircle of stones and containing a number of offerings; the pots were full of earth. The majority of the tombs were cists, lined with stones and plaster, or without lining, covered by slabs; the offerings included bronze mirrors and aryballoi, dating the burials to HL times. These burials lay in the periphery of the plot, while in the centre large pots, lying on their sides, were placed in small hollows (377-8). In Ergon 1989, 122-5, B. Lambrinoudakis and F. Zapheiro- poulou describe the work necessary to preserve the important Myc city and G tomb and cult area under the public square in front of the Cathedral. Four positions for support pillars were chosen where least damage would be done, though some destruction was inevitable. The results of this effort are extremely important; such methods of preservation of antiquities in the middle of a moder town has been rare in Greece. The difficulties are made clear as is the determination with which the project was achieved. Work by the Byzantine Ephorate concentrated on mural and icon conservation and an important survey to photograph and catalogue the Med remains of the Castle. At the church of Ag. Ioannes at Adesauros, three wall-painting phases were found beginning in the 9th Ct AD (aniconic so-called Naxian 'iconoclast' type) in the sanctuary and apse, 13th Ct in Apse (Theotokos), and 14th Ct (Deisis) (ADelt 36 Chr 382).

Koukounaries. (AR 1988-9, 90.) In Ergon 1989, 117-21 D. Schilardi summarizes the importance of this site and and describes his work for the AS in 1989. The site is the most important on the island, lying on a hill at the SW side of the Bay of Naouse, adjacent to the EC cemetery at Plastera. The importance is threefold: (1) the presence of a fortified LH IIIC site (2) the continuity of occupation from Mycenaean to A, evidenced by finds of PG, G and EA, (3) the presence of the sanctuary of Athena in the town plan of 700 BC. Excavation concentrated on the temple terrace on the SE of the hill. The temple was of house plan with two columns and an internal bench. There are many alteration phases extending down to the 4th Ct BC. Below both the temple and the open-air shrine is evidence of earlier EC and LC occupation. A built rectangle without finds may be a PG tomb but worship is firmly attested from middle G. Many finds came from the shrine deposits, notably G, A and C pottery and a lead snake head, possibly from Athena's shield decoration. In the lower section little new chronological evidence was found but the area was certainly occupied in EC I, contempor- ary with the adjacent cemetery. Pholegandros. Preservation of two churches is reported, Taxiarchoi and Ag. Sophia (Chora) which is typical MByz with interesting features (Eleuthere Ora 20.5.89). Samos: Heraion. Excavations in 1989 by the German Institute under H.J. Kleinast took place in the pronaos of the second dipteros. The aim was to determine the date of the temple and to examine the interior arrangement of the so-called Rhoikos Temple. Trenches were laid out at right angles to the N wall of the pronaos in order to achieve the best evidence for the construction and the stratigraphy. Discoveries under the foundations of the Rhoikos Temple showed that construction began after 575 BC while the antefixes from the roof were finished about 560 BC. The building was short-lived and owed its destruction not to fire but to inadequate foundations. The new building was laid out 40m to the W so that its foundations could avoid those of the earlier building. A foundation trench im deep and 4.5m wide was dug, filled with sea sand and covered with limestone chippings. The huge foundations were built on this. However, this solid substructure was used only for the cella, not for the inner and outer peristyle. The excavation showed that the foundations for the cella of the second dipteros were probably laid in the 3rd decade of the 6th Ct, but there was then an interruption of 20-30 years in the building programme. This shows that the foundations of the cella can be connected to the reign of Polykrates, but that the subsequent construction of this huge temple did not take place before the end of the 6th Ct. BC. Fig. 57 shows a cutting in the pronaos of the second dipteros, with on the left the floor and slab lay-out of the Rhoikos Temple, in the centre, levels of fill with the floor slabs of the pronaos of the second dipteros and on the right, foundations of an anta. Pythagoreio. The press complains of the building of a hotel in the outer reserved zone of the anc. city, accompanied by a horrifying photograph (Bema 11.3.90). N Necropolis: a rock-cut tomb, the second in this necropolis, was excavated in 1981 at the E side of the Ambelos hill. Its entrance is on the E; a dromos and five steps lead down to the chamber. The doorway was originaly blocked by stone slabs and consisted of two doorjambs and a lintel. The chamber is of a rectangular plan and has a vaulted roof, while the interior includes the characteristic bench and a narrow passageway reached by two further steps. Although it had been looted, offerings were found both in the chamber (clay idols, pottery, iron nails, bronze jewellery) and the dromos fill (pottery, idols) dating the tomb to the 2nd-lst Ct AD (368). The Kalograias plot was reexcavated by M. Marthare, and the old trenches (ADelt 26 Chr 459-461), where part of the water supply system had been discovered, were reopened. Immediately opposite this plot part of the main cross road of the town had been discovered and its continuation was found in the new excavation (4.4m wide x 25.7m long). Since only part of the stone paving has survived at the NE end, the water supply system and the drainage system under the road could be investigated. All along its W side, a well preserved water pipe has survived and another one further E. The house remains are connected with the road by staircases, thresholds, and small drains leading to the main drain. Two buildings with various phases were discovered, one including parts of a mosaic floor. The date of the road and most of the buildings range between the R Imperial to Mid Byz times (368-72). In the Maitos plot a small section of a white plaster floor and two walls of different building phases were reported (372). In the Cultural Centre plot a test trench revealed part of a wall and under a R level, a paved floor, continuing to the N and E (372). Siphnos. 17th Ct secular wall-paintings in the A.

N of the Evangelistria church, extensive remains of the trapezoidal walls of the anc. town were reported in 1981, the N and E sides being the better preserved. The masonry is not uniform, some sections being hastily built with unworked stones, while in other sections the stones were rectangular, particularly on the N where there are three rectangular towers; five more towers are visible on the E side (380). Thera: Akrotiri. Because of preparations for the Third Thera Conference no excavations took place in the summer of 1989 but Ch. Doumas reports on other work under the aegis of the AS in Ergon 1989, 114-7. A geophysical study was initiated which should give information necessary of the safety of the site and for new roofing methods. A map is being prepared. Mending of pottery continued as did conservation of the frescoes of Xeste 3; the text of the volume on those of the West House has gone to the publishers. Attention is called to two points: the entomological study showing that none native species are present, possibly brought in with grain shipments; the possibility that the destruction took place in the 17th Ct BC rather than c. 1500. Phtellos The excavation of the Myc building uncovered in 1980 (AAA XV (1982) 86-101) was continued in 1981; Area II being now properly investigated down to floor level, and resulting in interesting conclusions concerning the plan of the building and the constructional methods of the MCyc period. Area II communicates with a third area, Area III, on the E, which is now mostly destroyed; it was probably circular or elipsoidal, while communication among the three areas was through narrow corridors and staircases; the latter were probably structurally useful. In Area II the stone layer, discovered in 1980, continued to floor level. Kamari. Ch. Televantou reports on what is known of the anc. town of Oia, one of the two ports of ancient Thera, the other being Eleusis, both identified with the modem beaches of Kamari(N) and Perissa(S) respectively. The site name Oia was mentioned in association with the Palaistra on an inscribed column located in the church of Ag. Nikolaos on the S side of the beach, as well as one series of of four marble inscribed blocks associated with a large building excavated in 1856, identified with the Palaistra; the latter is now impossible to locate. Surface finds include statues, architectural elements, ancient walls, and a rock cut tholos structure, identified as the Nymphaion (373-5). In the Kyriazis plot remains of buildings and a road with houses facing its S side were uncovered in this plot. In the SE section, there is a staircase with two steps leading to a paved area (A) with a bench lining its S wall, while a second interior staircase is preserved to the W, leading to the upper storey; a built well was also recorded. A further paved area at a higher level was uncovered to the W, and a second entranceway led to area B, provided with a beaten earth floor; nearby to the W, a staircase with three steps probably led to a third entranceway or a side street. The well-preserved walls suggest the existence of at least two building phases, continuing into the next plot. The portable finds consist of sherds and a single inscribed limestone plaque, which date the complex in the LR times E...AIAAX /.AEANEFPADEN YHOFPAMMAT./ .ANTInATPOY TOY AAMOAAMA./..AXOY KNIA- 10. (375-7). DODEKANESE AND AMORGOS The 22nd Ephorate reports on work in 1981 in AD 36 Chr 409-10. Amorgos: Markiani. A second season of excavation on this inter-university project representing the Universities of Athens (C. Doumas), Ioannina (L. Marangou) and Cambridge (A.C. Renfrew) was directed in the field by the latter two. They report: "Excavation centred upon the area (Terrace 1) immedi- ately to the S of the summit where trenches 1 and 2 were opened in 1988. Work continued further down the slope (to the S) in trench 3, where excavation of exclusively ECyc deposits was completed. On the N side the existence of a fortification tower was confirmed, and its ECyc date documented. During the season extensive clearance of the dense vegetation covering much of the site was undertaken, revealing early terrace walling and other features on the S, and allowing study of the possible lines of the defences to the E. At the N the line of the defences is now established: at the S and W the natural escarpment of the site apparently offered sufficient security from attack. In trench 1 the vertical walling in the rock fissure was investigated and its ECyc date documented. This walling and the buildings beneath were partially covered by deposits of pottery of a late phase of the EBA (the Kastri Group) which had evidently fallen from above (where such deposits are no longer preserved). Likewise at the top, but in earlier levels, overlying the bedrock in situ material of an early phase of occupation was recovered assignable to the Grotta-Pelos culture (EC I). In subsequent levels frying pan sherds of Kampos type were found (earliest level T7 layer 10), and also a few Urfimis sherds (earliest context T7 layer 6). The principal buildings investigated were below the summit, on terrace 1. There, to a circular structure adjacent to (S of) the wall in the fissure, was added a rectangular room, with which comes pottery of what may provisionally be described as an intermediate phase. The finds have yet to be studied in detail. But the character- istics of the early ceramic group are clear. It resembles closely the material from the earliest levels at Phylakopi in Melos and at Grotta in Naxos. Rolled rim bowls and tubular tunnel lugs predominate in a thick ware, often heavily burnished, which shows mainly inclusions of calcite, probably marble. (A technical study is being undertaken by Dr. Sarah Vaughan.) It is particularly significant that the stratified materials from Trench 6, in association with the fortification wall, which have now received preliminary study, are exclusively of this nature. The conclusion follows that Markiani was fortified in the EC I (Grotta-Pelos) period. It therefore represents the earliest known fortified site in the Cyclades." Minoa. (AR 1988-9, 88.) Excavation for the Archaeological Soceity by L. Marangou continued in 1989 on this site which now shows occupation from the 10th Ct BC through R Imperial times. In the lower town work on the G building showed its extent and produced pottery of high quality, making the religious character certain. A sealed level of PG and a G bastion on the fortification with cuttings for a wooden stair are notable. On the peak, work on the shrine was completed. Following cleaning of the site in general, many finds came to light in the 'Council Chamber', including fragments of wall painting, inscriptions (one with the name of 'ApaivOrlS</page><page sequence="69">70 E. B. FRENCH tIh)XaXt4ox), much pottery of various periods and two R Imperial seals with heads the Dioskouroi (Ergon 1989, 108- 114). Karpathos. A large (25x16m) 6th Ct simple basilica and a small ?bath were found to the S (ADelt 36 Chr 423). At the Panagia Marmarine church at Arkasa a large number of ancient architectural marbles were found reused in the structure (425). Kos: town. (409) On E. Benizelou and Ag. Paraskeues part of the Minoan-Myc town was uncovered in the Seraglio area in 1981, with 5 architectural phases: MM to the end of LH IIIC (= Morricone's Town IV). The most important finds include two potery kilns, belonging to the MM and the LMIA periods. E of the Theatre part of a LR building was uncovered, including a courtyard with peristyle to the E. Various rectangu- lar areas were reported to the E, while an altar type structure was located to the N; it seems that this was a religious area. On E. Benizelou and Korais part of a building was uncovered to the SW of the fortifications, with 5 building phases ranging from the HL to ECh. It was probably a metal workshop, at least in the later phases. On Gregoriou E'and S. Thymanakes the anc. road was reported running N-S in the SE part of the town, dating from HL and R times, as well as part of a R house. Graves were located in the cemeteries around the town, mostly built cist tombs, of the HL and R periods. Re-used ancient marbles are reported in a single-naved church at Kako Prinari (ADelt 36 Chr 425-6). Kardamaina (anc. Alasara). A 5th season of excavation by staff from the University of Athens under the aegis of the Archaeological Soceity is reported in Ergon 1989, 131-135. Work concentrated on opening new trenches to reveal more of the LR and ECh town and excavation below the ECh levels in previous trenches. Much important chronological and architec- tural information was recovered; a heap of everyday pottery, mainly amphorai, seems to belong to the store of a potter's workshop; another pottery-filled pit of which several are known from the site confirms this system of tidying the anc. town. Mesaria. Two built cist LHL tombs were uncovered in 1981 (409). Palio Pyli. A programme of aerial photography of this Byz castle was undertaken in 1989 by M. Theochari for the Archaeological Soceity (Ergon 1989, 166). Leipsoi. Re-used ancient marbles are reported at Ag. Nicholas at Apalonia, the Panagia at Kouselios, Ag. Panteleimon and Ag. Spyridon at Katsadia (ADelt 36 Chr 426-8). Rhodes: Acropolis. Thanks to the completion of expropriation and other measures, it was possible for the Archaeological Soceity to initiate a programme of work. G. Konstantinopoulos undertook, as a first stage, the cleaning of an area of 4000 sq.m in the N of the area (Ergon 1989, 136). During wide-scale clearing and cleaning of monuments, by the 4th Byzantine Ephorate in 1981, excavations were carried out at Malona (basilica A) WE of the coastal Charaki estate. A simple wooden roofed tripartite basilica (24.50x 18.50m) was found. The stylobates rest on foundations of a more ancient structure. An additional structure mid way along the N wall (7.80x4.10m) may have been a baptistry. To the E of this another structure terminating in an apse to the E may have been an anointing chamber linked to the baptistry. Some complete architectural members were found: Ionic and Corinthianizing capitals, a cushion capital and circular pavil- ion-like decorated balustrade from the templon (ADelt 36 Chr 412-3). Lardos. Excavations at the church of Panagia Katholoke found remains of two earlier basilicas by the apse. At 0.90m at the outer section of the apse, the remains of the EChr apse were uncovered on yet an earlier basilica apse. Basilica A (the earliest) may have been a 4th Ct three-aisled wood-roofed simple basilica (total length 24m). After its destruction, basilica B was built on the same plan but at a smaller size (ADelt 36 Chr 413-4). Mesanagras. A large EChr basilica complex was found at on the SE heights of Koukouliaris (on the Palaioekklisies site). Basilica G (12.90xll.80m, tripartite with built stepped synthronos and fine mosaic floor) is flanked by many ante- chambers and, to the SE, another basilica (A). A third possible basilica (B) may exist under G. The side aisle alone extends to the apse while areas to the N and S of the apse would original- ly have been outside the building. The colonnades consisted of 5 columns each supporting 6 arches. The whole complex seems to have been deserted since the 7th Ct (ADelt 36 Chr 415-9). Reports on small Rhodian churches (ADelt 36, 419ff.) include Ag. Georgios at Arnitha (13 Ct murals), Prophitis Abbacoum at Paradeisi (c. 15th Ct murals), Prophitis Amos at Kalythies, Ag. Anastasia at Monolitho (?date, extensive painting programme), Ag. Petros at Apollona (18th Ct), the Metamorphosis at Martisa (17th Ct), Zodochos Pege at Sianna (14th, 17th-18th Ct murals) (ADelt 36 Chr 419-23). Plemmyri-Lakhania. Authorisation to build a large hotel complex over the ancient cemetery here has caused widespread disquiet (Epikairoteta 3.3.90). Telos. ECh and Byz marble members were found incorporated into the Monastery of Ag. Panteleimon 7km from Megalo Chorio. In the fortress of the same island is the half-ruined single-naved church of the Taxiarchoi, built from reused ancient blocks. The vision of Peter of Alexandria is depicted inside in a Post Byz mural layer, but evidence points to an earlier Byz level beneath (ADelt 36 Chr 431-4). CENTRAL CRETE The G. Rethemiotakes of the 23rd Ephorate reports for 1981 in ADelt 36 Chr 389-90. Ag. Triada. Excavation by V. La Rosa, Director of the Italian School, continued in 1989 in two areas: (1) In building W, a rhomboid apparently without entrance abutting on the S the Casa dei Vani Aggiunti Progressivamente (Hs VAP, House of the Successively Added Rooms). A series of trials on the S produced levels from LM IIIB to MM IIB. Building W is built during LM IIIA2 and as part of the major Postpalatial building period, forms one side of the 'Agora'. It was probably only approachable from Hs VAP. (2) By the Tomb of the Gold Objects, the scene of excava- tion in 1903 by R. Paribeni which produced some well known finds. The new work which exposed an area of 260 m2 showed that the building consisted of 5 rooms not 4 and was linked to another (with columns on the W facade) by stairs and path- ways. Both buildings are abandoned in LM IB. 13 levels from</page><page sequence="70">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 71 EM to LM IIIA2 were identified but no architecture of the Protopalatial period. Archanes: Phourni. An account of work in 1987 (AR 1987-8, 65) is given by E. Sapouna-Sakellaraki and I. Sakellarakis in Kretike Estia 2, 317-20. Komopole. An area with MM III-LM I sherds was investi- gated but proved to be wash from higher up the hill (where pithoi had been discovered previously). A PG burial pithos was found in rescue work. Karnari. Deep ploughing revealed LR tombs; an important find in a secondary context was a dedicatory inscription refering to the Kouretes (321). Tourkogeitonia. Work by E. Sapouna-Sakellaraki and I. Sakellarakis in 1989 is reported in Ergon 1989, 141-7. Areas 4, 23-27 were opened up (Fig. 58) while work in other areas stopped at the upper storeys of the final M destruction (after removal of Myc, HL, R and Byz). Area 24 was also stopped at this level on the find of massive poros blocks which indicate that the architectural scheme of the ground floor was repeated at the higher level. The E wall of corridor 23 is of outstanding quality and surfaced with white plaster which may prove to carry wall-paintings. Areas 25 and 4 were excavated to the floor; on a bench in the former were 2 complete porphyry lamps (a pottery vessel lay on top of one), and in the NE corer a conical vessel; 2 steatite seals had fallen from the upper floor. In the centre of Area 4 around a burnt wooden object were two cylindrical vessels, one decorated with spirals the other with plants; beneath these were many other vessels, largely jugs but including a SJ with plastic decoration et al. Small finds too were remarkable including faience, ivories and two sections of tusk. Among other finds along the W wall was a lump of imported red jasper. Astritsi: Ellenika. A LR farm with storerooms was partly investigated in 1981 (389). Episkopi Pediadas. New sites reported in 1981 included: a MMIII-LMI settlement at Patrona, a LM settlement on Ag. Elias, and M sherds from a small cave (390). Kalybotopos. A ChT, roughly circular, was discovered in 1981. It contained two rectangular larnakes, with pitched lids, containing a single burial each. The pottery (SJ, Kylix) dates to LM IIIB; the offerings include a few pieces of worked ivory and bronze (389). Giouktas. The 1989 season of work in two areas by A. Ioanidou Karetsou is reported in Ergon 1989. 147-152. Building B (N of the temenos and 50m from the entrance), which seems now certain to be part of the installations of the sanctuary, consists of 2 phases, MM IIB-MM IIIa and MM IIIB, both of which were destroyed by heavy burning. The architecture of the second phase is of high quality and the building contained quantities of pottery, mainly domestic heavy wares but with some fine specialized religious types. Stone objects included a chlorite lamp, another alabaster 'oorstop', mortars, pounders et al.. Except for a male votive figurine all finds were practical. In the sanctuary itself clearing of Rooms III and IV was completed, the former had been disturbed by the work of the OTE but the latter was untouched, producing 45 large groups of pottery and 250 small objects, mainly animal figurines of various sizes, but with 12 bird and 10 human. There were 40 4 r-- i I' Fig. 58 new pieces of wheeled bovids and 4 patterned heads (these from LM I-IIIA2-B levels). A foundation deposit was dis- covered by the terrace wall IV, at the NE comer of Room III consisting of 37 conical cups and 3 jugs; there were also traces of libations in the soil. Three fragmentary stone altars were also found here as well as small finds including a stone bird probably once attached to a vessel. Work on the mending and study of finds has progressed and notable is a headless Sphinx figure reminiscent of those from Ag. Triada which proves the continuation of the sanctuary into Myc times. Gortyn. Work by the Italian School under the Director, V. La Rosa, continued in 1989, concentrating on the Praetorium complex. To the W a stretch of the paved R road was cleared but tests beneath showed that it was founded on a gulley which must have encircled the site on this side in A times. On the S part of the Praetorium itself, in the caldarium of the 2nd Ct baths (in room 13), the method for heating the walls was found in situ. Chronological details were established of the effect of the earthquakes of 618 and 670 AD. After the latter the city was largely abandoned but there may have been some slight reoccupation. Herakleion. The find on the rubbish dump of 5/6th Ct AD architectural pieces (door, column capital and base) coming from the road by the shore within the town is reported (Epikairotita 16.12.89). A programme to save the walls is widely discussed. The press (Kathemerine 24.10.89) has attempted to urge on the long-awaited establishment of a Nautical Museum in the small fort on the breakwater (Koules/Rocca al Mare). The plan to build a plant for waste recycling not far from Knossos as the crow flies caused much unease among those unacquainted with the topography. The Ephorate has done much within the last year to rationalize development. To Bema (2.7.89) reports on the underwater excavation by M. Anagnostopoulou and colleagues from the Ephorate of Underwater Archaeology in 1987, 88 and 89 on the French ship 'La Therese' which sank with all hands off Dia in battle with the Turks in 1669. The work promises important informa-</page><page sequence="71">72 E. B. FRENCH tion on shipbuilding and naval history of the 2nd half of the 17th century. See also Enalia Ib, Oct. 1989. Idaion Cave. I. Sakellarakis describes the 100 years of excavation by the AS culminating in his own recent work in AE 1987. The 1989 season is reported in Ergon 1989, 153. Work was concentrated outside the cave (26m E of the entrance and 6m NE of the altar) in a stratigraphic study and in preparation for needs of future excavation. Two levels were distinguished both of HL/R date: the upper contained many stones and pottery, lamps and bronze objects; the lower contained burnt material and pebbles but no larger stones, fine pottery, a few bones and bronze objects. Bricks and a poros block were found, presum- ably from some structure. Objects turned in by local residents include the head of an A bronze figure, a lead astragalos, and a bronze coin of Domitian. Kanli Kastelli: Kourende. A small eliptical ChT with two dromoi, was excavated in 1981, probably part of the M settlement of Lykasto. Remains of a disturbed burial were found on the floor, but no offerings (389). Kasanoi Pediados. A MM-Post M settlement was located in 1981 to which doubtless belong the previously excavated ChTs (ADelt 27 Chr, 621). R remains were found nearby (390). Kastelli Erakleiou. The press reports the excavation by G. Rethemiotakes of an extensive structure with a shrine on the N containing an varied and impressive group of religious vessels (Eleutherotipia 27.9.89). Kastelli Pediados. G. Rethemiotakes describes his finds of 1987 in Kretike Estia 2, 327-8. The lowest levels produced sherds of MM IB-IIA without architecture; above lay a large Neopalatial complex including a court or lightwell, apparently a 'town house' which was destroyed by heavy fire. The presence of cooking and utilitarian wares and tools is func- tionally significant. In the same area were Postpalatial levels of LM IIIB and IIIC, the later with an apsidal building as at Brokastro. The A levels, mainly pits, contained pithos frag- ments of the known local types. Finally LByz houses and the foundations of a Venetian square tower were cleared which had largely destroyed the M levels at the N. Katophygi Pediados. Two small Tholos tombs and a pit grave were destroyed in 1981 during road works (389). Kato Syme (i.e. Syme Biannou). A. Lembesi publishes a brief report on her work in 1987 at the sanctuary of Hermes and Aphrodite (Kretike Estia 2, 332-3). A fourth architectural phase of the Neopalatial period was identified. The procession- al way and general imposing character of the complex are stressed. A bronze male statuette in M pose but naked is to be dated to the transition from BA to IA. 82 M stone vessels include tables of offering, one with a Linear A inscription. Excavation did not take place in 1989 (Ergon 1989, 140-1) but work concentrated on study of the finds and preservation of the shrine itself. Keratokambos Biannou. Several new sites were reported in 1981: an extensive MM III-LM I settlement; a farm or small settlement of the same period; a walled HL settlement, with an earlier MM III-LM I phase (390). Knossos: N cemetery. A. Basilakes reports on the excavation in 1987 of 8 R tombs of which 1 is of the mausoleum type known only in the Knossos area at this period; it was rich in finds, some of which are briefly listed (Kretike Estia 2, 323-4). Kounaboi. A PG burial urn was found in this neighbourhood in 1987 (Kretike Estia 2, 328-9). Krousonas. N. Demopoulou-Rethemiotake reports finds handed in to the Ephorate from this area: 7 PG/G clay animals from Bolokas and an almost complete M potter's wheel from Achladias (Kretike Estia 2, 329). Lyktos. A number of published inscriptions were taken into safe keeping in 1981 and other new ones were discovered, notably a dedication to Hadrian (389): AbtxoKparotca Kacoapa /0fOeo Tpatavot nap0tiKo) / 1tov 0eo0 NepoOca bt /vov Tpata- vot- ASptavo) /aoepaoctrv 2pxteppfl pUtyiGT- ov /6fpcapxtKf; 4o)oatiac / r6v It'fntctov r6 y' /AiTrtCtov c6h; 6t&amp; TCpCO / TOK6a:pou 'AKExt,pou /Mevortou. Malebyzoi: Korphoi. A M Villa or a complex of farm houses was located in 1981 (390). Matala. Ta Nea (25.7.89) reports group LR burials in the well- known caves, accompanied by lamps. The chance is discovery is now being investigated by a team from the Ephorate and the University of Crete who are studying the whole region. Other finds from the area include a M tomb (Kouse), HL tombs (N. of Festos), a M. tower-like structure and an EM settlement (Aphratia), and a HL structure (Ag. Ioannes, Phaestos). Poros. N. Demopoulou-Rethemiotake reports briefly on her work in 1987 at this harbour site with cemetery (Kretike Estia 2, 325-7). The excavation of a large rock-cut tomb used mainly in MM IIB and in LM IA &amp; B was completed. Postpalatial sherds around the entrance are thought to derive from the adjacent settlement. In spite of ancient disturbance, one burial was found in tact (with more than 250 whole pots) and elsewhere many items including pieces of wooden sarcophagi or beds were collected. The assemblage is of great importance. Trypete. The press reports that A. Basilakes has continued his work on this important EM settlement (AR 1986-7,57, 1988- 9,101) bringing the total of rooms now cleared to 42 (conser- vation has taken place). Finds include more pottery and many large stone implements, as well as two steatite seals with geometric designs and a complete bronze pin. A report on work in 1987 is published in Kretike Estia 2, 331-2. EASTERN CRETE K. Davaras reports work in 1981 in the 24th Ephorate (ADelt 36 Chr 405-6). No excavations took place for lack of funds but much conservation work was carried out in the Ag. Nikolaos Museum. I. Tzedakis and his colleagues report their work in 1987 on the M road system in Kretike Estia 2, 342-3. Notable is the identification of guard posts throughout the area included in the pilot project, leading to the supposition that the road system was planned and organized as a whole.</page><page sequence="72">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 73 Basilike. Ergon 1989, 141 reports that no excavation took place in 1989 but work was concentrated in the workroom and on publication. Brokastro. A report of the survey carried out by J. Moody and B. Hayden (ASCS) in 1986-7 is published in Kretike Estia 2, 350-3. Bryses Mirampellou. The head of an interesting hollow clay idol, like those from Karphi and elsewhere, and two miniature LM IIIC-SM pyxides were discovered in 1981 (405). Diaskari (Bigla Makrygialos). The legal problems that have ensued following the grant of the building permit (now revoked) for a hotel on this important M site have occupied much space in the press. Itanos. 27 rock cut HL tombs are reported near the ancient city (Kathemerine 1.6.89). Kato Zakro. N. Platon gives a brief account of work in five areas of the town and palace in 1987 (Kretike Estia 2, 341-2). SE of the Palace, the rising passage beside Rooms XL and XLI was followed to the E to the point where a boundary wall had been found previously. The descent to the Built Fountain (LXX) was fully investigated as well as the area of the well at the SW comer of the SE surround where many Canaanite jars had been found; much Neopalatial pottery including Canaanite jars and other containers for liquids. At House F on the NW slope, excavation continued on the E and W sides of embankment IV, N of the building. Much pottery, mainly LM IA was recovered and various stone tools. At House N on the NW slope, the excavation was limited to the immediate S of the building. Rooms of the Protopalatial period period were cleared, one of which had a red painted floor. Work on the paved road, running on the E side of Building on the NW slope and continuing N, produced more of the paving and of the substructure. The area of a wooden stair at the N of Building E was also investigated. On the SW slope (Ag. Antonios) excavation in House Aa produced pottery (bowls and conical cups) and an assortment of artifacts in the small triangular area XV. Notable was part of a stucco frieze with spirals like that from the Palace. A poros cistern lay in the middle and the area had many signs of burning. It is suggested that the area was used for waste late in LM Ia. In House Z the excavation of the two N rooms (A and B), begun in 1963, was completed. The S side of B was an elaborate polythyron with six bases. Room r to the S of A had a handsome mosaic floor, and contained a large jug and sections of pithoi. S of B and E of F there seems to have been an extensive courtyard. Kabousi. W. Coulson, G. Gessell and L. Day (ASCS) report their work in 1989: "Twenty-three new trenches were opened on the lower settlement at Vronda, while work continued in seven trenches partly excavated in previous seasons. Building G of the Southwest Area, which is indentified as the shrine of the settlement, and the area to the SW of it were extensively explored. S and W of Building G more fragments of cult equipment were found, including snake tubes and terracotta figures of goddesses with upraised hands. The limits of the deposit on the S and W have now been determined, and all of the material has been removed. Reconstruction and study of the shrine material has shown that there were at least 17 goddesses. Although no full goddess has yet been put together from over 2000 fragments, progress has been made in piecing them together into larger sections, and the full profile of one goddess has now been restored. Further exploration occurred within Building G itself. There are two rooms: the N room produced the deposit of whole snake tubes, kalathoi, and terracotta plaques at the end of the 1988 season, and the S room was disturbed by a LG burial. In the Area W of the Summit 7 new trenches were opened up around Building I to determine the extent of this structure, and trenches opened last season were further excavated. The terrace wall which forms the S boundary of the building was uncovered, and the E wall of Rooms 1 and 2 was established as the E boundary of the building. A large wall on the N may have served as the N limit, but further excavation is needed to determine if the building continues in that direction. On the W, however, the walls continue, and the W boundary is not yet firmly established. The area was disturbed by at least 3 burials. Grave 23 was a LG cist with several cremations, similar to graves on the summit. Grave 24 was not a built structure, but a room containing the unbured bones of a child possibly suffering from tuberculosis. Grave 28 was a large cist which utilized one of the small rooms of Building I. It contained many cremations, but few grave offerings; only a few iron tools and weapons were found, a bronze fibula, and 6 large cups. Along the W side of the summit, Building C was further explored. The S boundary was uncovered, with a large, well- preserved terrace wall to the S of it. The area between the terrace wall and the W boundary of Building C was relatively level, although it had ridges of bedrock projecting through it; possibly the area was used as a street. Excavation to the S of the southernmost wall of Building C showed that this wall formed the S boundary. No architecture existed S of the wall, just bedrock with a few stones which may have been used to fill the crevices in the bedrock. It seems likely that a street ran S of Building C, and that the inhabitants of Vronda walked not on neatly paved or cobbled streets, but on bare and uneven bedrock On the N side of the summit, removal of a balk brought to light another LG Grave (21). This grave was an irregular cist which contained three cremations on top of a pithos burial. The pithos itself held the bodies of an unburned child and two cremated adults, along with a kalathos, two cups, and an oinochoe. Beneath this grave were deposits of undisturbed LM IIIC pottery, including a large kylix fragment. Fig. 59</page><page sequence="73">74 E. B. FRENCH Sixteen new trenches were opened on the upper settlement on the Kastro, while work continued in eight trenches partially excavated in previous seasons. Excavation on the West Slope concentrated in eight rooms on three terraces. To the S of Room 8 on the middle terrace, two rooms were exposed. The northernmost room appears to have undergone three phases of construction. In its earliest phase, the room consisted of two lateral NS walls on the E, forming a buttress for the upper terrace. The inhabitants made ample use of the bedrock in the E as an interior wall face supporting field stone construction. At the end of Phase I, a catastrophic event, perhaps an earthquake, caused the collapse and bowing of the upper course of the room's E walls and the slippage of the S wall. This event necessitated the construction of a secondary wall along the E. Phase III consisted of a major rebuilding of the room and the narrowing of its EW dimensions. The entire E half of the room was filled in, including the doorway of Room 8. The fill of this third phase dates to LG and appears to be the final phase of the use of the room. On the upper terrace at least three rooms were cleared. In one of these the lowest floor level contained LM IIIC pottery, including fragments of a larnax. The other yielded a stratified ceramic sequence from LM IIIC to LG. The three trenches opened on the E Slope revealed a megaron-type building of the LG period situated on a long, narrow terrace. The structure has an open front porch, a narrow vestibule, large central room with a bin in one comer, and a trapezoidally shaped back room. The back walls of the structure to the W, which also serve as the retaining wall of the upper terrace, are exceptionally well built and preserved in places to heights of between 2.50m to 3m. In the walls of the central room, holes are visible for beams supporting the floor of an upper storey. On the False Peak the NW Building in this area now consists of five rooms, ranging in date from LM IIIC to LG. The earliest phase, LM IIIC, was found on the lowest floor level of Room 2; the associated pottery included two deep bowls and sherds with bivalve decoration and accumbant and pendant loops. The lowest floor in Room 3, to judge from the associated pottery, appears to date to the PG period. Three other architectural phases, spanning EG to LG, also belong to this room. The building, therefore, appears to have been occupied continuously from LM IIIC to LG. Three trenches were opened on the steep S slope of the Kastro some 100m S of the settlement on the summit. Here at least two rooms of a LG building were uncovered. The presence of this complex at such a distance from the structures on the summit indicates that the Kastro settlement was quite large in LG times. Mallia. (AR 1988-9, 99) The French School continued the work of renewing the covering of areas needing protection. The opportunity was taken while the buildings were uncovered of obtaining a new series of air photographs of the whole area. The new roofs are now in place over the magazines to W of the central court and over the Hypostyle court; that over Quartier Mu is in course of erection though not without incident. In Quartier Mu, J.-C. Poursat supervised the excavation of the 39 emplacement trenches required for the roof. The fact that they lay just beyond the outlines of the major structures meant that they offered a unique opportunity to check the extent of the complex and to test remains of earlier (Protopal- atial) and later (Neopalatial) phases of occupation, both widely found. Of particular note was a stratum of EM IIA, found in Fig. 60 many trenches, containing pieces of a grey-black ware not previously found in the Palace area. A destruction level of MM IB-MM II found N of the 'Atelier de Sceaux' produced abundant material (Fig. 59). The latest pottery yet found in Quartier Mu is a group of LM II (Fig. 60) very similar to material from the Unexplored Mansion at Knossos. In trial 22 it was possible to explore the foundation of Building VI (Fig. 61); the find of a mould for metal working (Fig. 62) allows the function of this building to be identified. Fig. 61 To the N of the 'Atelier de Sceaux', A. Famoux continued the exploration of the LM levels. Among further abundant finds are half a female figurine (Fig. 63) and a group of 47 complete vessels (Figs. 64, 65). It may be noted that the LM III structures overlie LM I directly although LM II has been found further E. S. Muller embarked on a Survey to record known and surface remains over a wider extent than the actual archae- ological area. The impetus was the impending construction of a hotel at Ag. Barbara and the digging of a sewer N across the plain from Ag. Nikolaos. Pottery density methods, used in the Boeotia survey of the BSA, were adopted. Nothing between LM III and LR was identified except a few ?G sherds NW of Ag. Barbara. The Minoan material was largely recovered from the higher rocky areas, the Byz from soil patches and concen- trated around the chapels. One concentration of M material included surprising quantities of heavy wares and many loom</page><page sequence="74">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 75 weights of both types (Fig. 66). A M roadway running NE-SW was traced for 700m (Fig. 67). Fig. 62 Mochlos. A program of cleaning and excavation was carried out in 1989 on the island of Mochlos under the direction of K. Davaras and J.S. Soles. The two large and famous tombs on the western side of the island (I, II, III and IV, V, VI) were cleaned, and at the suggestion of N. Papadakes provision was made with the guard of the site to spray the area with chemi- cals over the winter to prevent weeds and bushes from growing in the spring. Cleaning was also carried out in several rooms of the Prepalatial houses in Block A and in one house of Block D in the Minoan settlement. No finds were made during this cleaning. At the same time unexcavated areas on the island were divided up in a 5m square grid; 14 trenches were opened in the area of the Minoan settlement and 4 were opened in the area of the Prepalatial cemetery. In the cemetery, 3 tombs were discovered; though not apparently dug by Seager, they were all badly plundered, probably during antiquity. They included one monumental tomb, destroyed all along its S side, which contained a smaller and earlier tomb at one end and a pit with an earlier cremation burial at the other end. Finds included EM II, EM III and MM I potsherds and a cylinder seal of haematite which was imported from N Syria. One of the other buildings in the cemetery contained a staircase descending from the entrance level and may have been used in the funerary cult, not as a tomb at all. In the settlement, parts of 4 Neopalatial houses were exposed. One of these, the facade and staircase of which were built in ashlar masonry, dated to the LM IB phase and contained a layer of volcanic ash beneath its floor level with LM IA pottery beneath the ash. It is the first conclusive evidence from Crete itself that the volcano on Thera erupted towards the end of the LM IA pottery phase and that Minoan civilization continued to flourish on Crete through the subse- quent LM IB phase. A second house was found to contain remarkable stratigraphy, with ten successive floors dating from LM IB on top to MM III on the bottom, and should be of great importance in clarifying the sequence of Neopalatial pottery styles. Still a third house is remarkable for its large size and most of the 1990 season will be devoted to its excavation. In one area of the settlement, remains of LM II and LM IIIA reoccupation were found. On the coastal plain, the Minoan buildings in the modem village of Mochlos and at Palaia Bardia were investigated with a view to future cleaning and excavation. Fig. 63 Neapolis: Nispita. Traces of three new ?early Greek settle- ments were identified in 1981 at the sites of Phlachtou Lakkoi, Karphi and Ag. Photia (405). Palaikastro. The British School under L.H. Sackett and J.A. MacGillivray carried out in 1989 a conservation and study season. Work was undertaken to prepare the pottery from previous seasons for final study. Soil samples were also sorted and the final study of the environmental and dietary material has been started; bone material is ready for study. On the site, work was restricted to the cleaning and conser- vation of Building 1 (AR 1988-9, 104 Fig. 142). All remaining baulks and post-LM I accretions were recorded and removed (with two minor exceptions), so that the building has been restored to its original LM I plan, now revealed fully for the first time. The foundations of all walls, internal and external, were revealed and the masonry conserved with koresani. In two places along the building's S facade (where late stone robbing had taken place) restoration of one course in sandstone ashlar was undertaken, principally to support rare areas of original floor which were preserved higher than the top surviving course of the facade. Elsewhere erosion, re-occupa- tion in LM II-IIIA1 and robbing in LM IIIB and later had penetrated at least to the original floor level. Sections and elevations were drawn throughout the building and wall foundations were protected by the laying of a clean gravel fill to the level of the LM I floors. Kouremenos.

A terrace wall on the top of the hill was dated to LMIA and belongs to a radical reshaping of the area for, doubtless, major structures, one of which was excavated though in bad condition. Sherds of EM I and MM prove the length of occupation of the site. Survey and sampling programmes linked to the excavation are described. Psathi. This area has been declared an 'Archaeological Zone' (Nike 21.3.90). Pseira. In 1989 the excavation continued, under the direction of K. Davaras and P. Betancourt, "on the main peninsula where the Minoan settlement is located as well as in the FN to MBA cemetery and at the location of two Minoan dams. Excavation in the Minoan town concentrated on the Plateia House, a large building at the N side of the town square. The eastern wing (Wing BV) was completely excavated. This wing was built at the end of LM IA, in a phase of remodelling which gave the building its final form. Most of the ground floor of the wing consisted of a single large room connected to the remainder of the house by a door at the NE. Painted pottery on the floor of the room showed that it was destroyed at the end of LM IB. Excavation beneath the floor revealed two earlier architectural phases at this point in the town, one Excavation in the Minoan cemetery was the main focus of the season. Eleven tombs were excavated. Although none of the tombs had its roof still intact, and most had been excavated by the Seager excavation of 1907, much new information was recovered. Parts of several of the tombs were previously undisturbed. Of the eleven tombs excavated, one was a house tomb (T 16), two were small caves of the type called rock shelters (Ts 14 and 15), one was a cist grave built of vertical slabs (T 7), one was a cist grave with its lower part cut in the bedrock and stone walls added at the upper part (T 6), and six were roughly rectangular cist graves of built walls or of built walls backed against the naturally occurring bedrock, with occasional vertical slabs added within the walls. Although no jar burials were actually excavated, the fragments of a large jar of a type normally used for burial were found. Excavation of two dams built during the Minoan period began this year. The structures were walls approximately three meters thick, with two faces. They were built across ravines and probably retained water and eroded earth for agricultural purposes. The dams are preserved about three meters high." Siteia. On final completion, the new Museum of Siteia was finally handed over to the Ephorate in 1981 (406). Trypetos. N. Papadakes reports (Kretike Estia 2, 335-6) on the excavation of the HL town (AR 1987-8, 74). Finds include coins of Praisos, Knossos, and Lato as well as bg jugs, and a variety of small items. An A pithos with decorative bands (apparently Rhodian) was discovered placed in a cavity by the 'eroon'; next to it was a bronze cup with long handle. WESTERN CRETE I.

Rescue excavation in 1987 revealed 2 domestic complexes of the 7th Ct AD (Kretike Estia 2, 315-6). Agrokipiou. 3.5km E of the town of Chania, a small cave was uncovered, consisting of at least two chambers decorated with stalactites. Excavation was conducted in the first chamber (7m xl3m) where the undisturbed deposit (2m thick), contained small finds in contexts associated with pyres. These included lamps (end 5th Ct BC to 1st Ct AD), kyathoi (4th Ct BC), as well as female seated idols (5th-4th Ct BC), and a large number of animal bones, an indication of sacrifices to the deity, which must have been connected with fertility in general (399). Alikianos Kydonias. A M burial pithos, placed in a stone built pit was accidentally discovered in 1981 during works for the water supply system (401). Apodoulou Amariou. 1981 was the second period of excava- tions at the site 'Frangou to Louri. Two further small LM III Tholos tombs with collapsed roofs were uncovered by I. Tzedakis and M. Pologiorge. Tholos Tomb 4 was a rock cut tomb with a blocked entrance-way and a lintel block, while the chamber itself included four SJs, one bronze knife, all outside the actual larnax, dating the burial to the end of LM IIIB. Tholos Tomb 5 was similar, ovoid with a blocked entrance- way, while the walls were preserved to a greater height (1.39m). The dromos was probably destroyed through deep ploughing. Three burials were identified, two in box shaped larnakes, the third on the earth floor of the tomb. The offerings include small SJs, a kylix, a pyxis, 34 faience beads, a few bronze objects et al., dating the tomb to LM IIIA2-IIIB (402- 3). Aptera. Excavation in 1987 here by the Ephorate under M.

Tzedakis and his associates on the cemetery in 1987 and the roadway of the cemetery is reported in Kretike Estia 2, 296-7. 7 new tombs bring the total to 187. Finds were similar to those of previous campaigns but the characteristic of broken kylikes and cooking wares in the dromoi may be noted. A small paved area covered with broken kylikes may indicate an area of cult; this area was linked to the dromos of one tomb by a channel. Atsipades: Korakias. This Minoan peak sanctuary was excavated in 1989 by the Knossos Curator of the BSA, A. Peatfield: "In the first week a detailed site plan was drawn. The excavation revealed 80-90% of the sanctuary area. It was found to be limited to the E edge of the W Upper Terrace, and to the E Lower Terrace, rather than covering the whole Korakias peak. Fig. 67 In planning, the E edge of the Upper Terrace had already been noted for a surface pebble scatter. Excavation showed that the pebbles were not a floor, but were thickly scattered through the votive layers, which were full of sherds and figurine fragments. The rounded, water-worn pebbles are not local and were brought here in Minoan times. Here, too, a small circular feature was revealed, completely lacking in finds, in contrast to the area around it. The feature in turn lay over a hollow (perhaps man-made) containing a concentration of finds. The greatest density of sherds on the site surrounds the circular feature. Clearly this pebbled area was of special importance within the sanctuary; perhaps it was the main liturgical area. Activity here seems to have involved libations, probably focused on whatever was in the hollow and later filled the feature. On the Lower Terrace, finds were concentrated in the rock clefts just below the Upper Terrace. Many finds were in situ, placed or thrown (broken) into the clefts. Beyond the clefts the finds fell off dramatically towards the E edge of the Terrace. On a sub-terrace E of the Lower Terrace a large cleft held many finds, including relatively complete human figurines. This secondary votive area is probably attributable to the good view E down to the valley. The figurines are of the types characteristic of Minoan peak sanctuaries (animals, humans, and human votive limbs). The</page><page sequence="77">78 E. B. FRENCH animal figurines are predominantly of cattle, medium to large in size, some hollow. Absent are miniature figurines of other domestic species. There are both male and female human figurines, which, though similar to other peak sanctuary figurines, display some regional variations. Votive limbs of the usual types (torsos, legs, arms) are few, while apparent phalloi, rare from other peak sanctuaries, are the commonest single type. The pottery is very fragmentary. The commonest shapes are handled and handleless cups; bridge-spouted jars are also frequent. While most sherds are plain, there is some decora- tion, usually a blue or thin red wash. The blue wash is characteristic of West Cretan MM. A few sherds of plain barbotine were found. Two almost complete cups were discovered, placed upside-down; these are similar in fabric to EM pottery from Chania. This suggests that the Atsipades sanctuary began in the Prepalatial period. Whether it also continued into the Neopalatial is still uncertain, though there is some indication of use in MM III. Not a single bone was found. Only in the pebble area on the Upper Terrace was any ash or carbon found. Samples of earth were taken for sieving or chemical analysis, which may reveal evidence of animal sacrifice or ritual meals. This westernmost definite peak sanctuary conforms in its topography, finds, and therefore cult, to peak sanctuaries elsewhere in Crete. The differences (notably the lack of bones and carbonized material and the numbers of phalloi) do raise questions about local variations of practice. The vast numbers of finds from what is clearly a small and parochial shrine, will help us towards an understanding of the role and importance of the peak sanctuary cult generally in Minoan culture."

A brief report on the Greek-Swedish excavations in 1987 (AR 1987-8, 75) is included in Kretike Estia 2, 275-7, with a good plan and interesting reconstruction. The same volume (279) publishes an account of two groups of M tombs, as well as those of the 4th Ct BC. During 1989 the Greek-Swedish Excavations Under I. Tzedakis, E. Hallager and S. Maroulake carried out a rescue excavation on Kanebaro on behalf of the Ephorate. They report: "The municipality of Chania replaced the old Turkish drainage in the street and a trench of 96x0.8m was excavated to the depth of 1.50m for the new drainage. Concerning the later history of the town the most welcome find was the first discovery of architectural remains from the Byz/Arabic periods. Remains from several LM III buildings were discovered and the most exciting find from this period was a fragment of a Linear B tablet (Fig. 68) of a type similar to the wheel tablets found at Knossos and Pylos (to appear in Kadmos 29:1 (1990)). Among other finds may be mentioned a terracotta model of a chariot, and a fragment of a bronze ingot found on a LM IIIA floor. Furthermore from these deposits, but probably of earlier date, came an unusual clay sealing with an impression from a signet ring depicting a bull- leaping scene. Extensive remains were unearthed from the Neopalatial period, mainly in the form of fallen ruins from the destruction which ended the period, and surfaces of a square and streets with their sometimes heavy packings. In the very western part of the trench was found the continuation of the LM I square noted in the previous Greek-Swedish Excavations. In this square - bordered at the southern side by fine ashlar walls (Fig. 69) - was found part of a circular structure which seemed to be of the same type as those discovered at Knossos (BSA 79 (1984), 307-323). Being mainly an outside area the finds were sparse, although several complete loom weights and hundreds of conical cups were collected. From the Protopalatial period only a few fragments of walls and floors were observed. The majority of finds were vast deposits of broken pottery found in pits and levelling deposits for the later constructions. The most remarkable find from the Prepalatial period was the remains of a building presumably destroyed by fire in MM IA. Part of two rooms at different levels were noted. In one of the rooms was found an intact jug (Fig. 70) and in the other fragments of at least three storage jars. This building sealed the EM remains and from this period may be noted a small fragment of animal rhyton and a clay sealing - the second, only, in Crete from the Prepalatial period." Press reports also mention the find of a 'light-well'. Chania Town (1981): Splatzia. Though previously it had been suggested that the M settlement of Kastelli extended E to within the limits of the old town, excavations in the Liolios plot uncovered only Turkish remains (395). Spelia Ag. Ioannou. A test excavation was carried out at this known cave by M. Tsipopoulou, at the E end of the town. The cave consists of 3 chambers, only the first of which shows any signs of human habitation, and was entered from the NW. Scattered EM sherds appeared under the surface debris, while</page><page sequence="78">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 79 Fig. 69 further down clear LN layers were reported. They included habitation remains, open hearths surrounded by small stones and covered with pots, animal bones, stone/bone tools, as well as carbonized wood, sampled for analysis. In the same layer, at the N corer, remains of a burial were found, probably in a contracted position, but very badly preserved. A better preserved burial is reported in the next layer, from the middle of the chamber, containing a male inhumation. The pottery has not yet been properly studied, but includes characteristic open, hemispherical, burnished vessels. This is the earliest known habitation site at Chania (395). On Giampoudake and Chatzidake an undisturbed HL rock- cut tomb (4th-3rd Ct BC) was excavated by I. Tzedakis, S. Markoulake and B. Niniou-Kindele. It consists of a stepped dromos leading to an underground entrance, an interior corridor (plastered) and 9 longitudinal burial chambers (loculi) at right angles to the corridor and sealed with stone doors; a handwritten inscription with the names of the 14 dead was found over each door. 37 intact pots, mostly of local manufac- ture, 21 figurines, gold and silver objects, jewellery, etc. were recovered. This type of tomb (Loculus) was widely used along the N. African coast in HL times as well as in Cyprus is frequent in the Kydonia cemetery (396). On Tzanakake M. Tsipopoulou reported the discovery, in rescue excavation, of four different superimposed architectural phases. The remains of the first phase (end of 5th Ct BC), sealed by a burnt destruction layer, included a pointed amphora placed in a pit, and a section of an earth floor. The second, the most important phase in this site (1st Ct BC), includes Rooms 1-2 of trench A, a wall with a threshold at trench F, and three sections of floors, all covered by a thick destruction layer. The walls were plastered and the floor of Room 2 was of beaten earth. The remains of the third phase (3rd Ct AD) included a built pit, lined with clay and a number of walls, the former full of red earth, with strong traces of fire and many sherds. Finally, the remains of the fourth phase (7th Ct AD) included a cist tomb, containing five skeletons in an extended position, and two coins of 657 AD. In lower levels EM sherds, but no architectural remains were reported (396-7). Eleutherna. Work in 3 sectors in and up to 1987 is reported by the excavators in Kretike Estia 2, 298-305. Sector I at Katsibelos on the lower slopes at the E, excavated by P. Themelis comprises a R house and an ECh basilica of which plans are given. In Sector II (Th. Kalpaxes) at Pyrgi (on the peak) a large ECh complex has been cleared while at Nesi excavations have revealed the propylon of an extensive rectangular enclosure. From fragments of Doric architecture, many with good traces of colour, the structure can be dated to c. 400 BC. Inscriptions on the walls date from about a century later and give many names of deities (previously unknown) and show relations with other towns. Finds include animal figures. In Sector III (N. Stampolides) work continued in 1987 on the outer walls at the W and on the cemetery, where a funerary monument accompanying pyre K and two primary cremations were cleared; finds included imports from Athens and Corinth as well as Rhodes (or Egypt), an early funerary stele and the lower part of a middle Daedalic kore with painted decoration preserved. Frangokastello: Worries about environs of Frangokastello have appeared in the local press. Kastelli Kisamou. (AR 1988-9, 108.) Part of a long and narrow cistern, continuing E and W, was uncovered in 1981 by S. Markoulake in a plot E of the cathedral adjacent to where a mosaic pavement had previously been found. The walls, built of river stones, tiles and cement, were covered with a thick layer of collapsed and broken tiles, while the interior, includ- ing the floor was surfaced with waterproof plaster (402) In rescue excavations in 1981 by M. Pologiorge in a part of town where the R cemetery is located (ADelt 34 Chr, 393; 33</page><page sequence="79">80 E. B. FRENCH Fig. 70 Chr, 370), more tombs were discovered, dated in the 2nd-3rd Ct AD. They were mostly of the vaulted type, including 1 with tile roof and 1 urn burial, made of stone and mudbrick, with a plastered interior and benches lining the walls; the actual burials were generally found in pits. The architecture of three examples is described in detail (399-400). A Museum entitled 'The Crete which has disappeared' has been opened at Kastelli Kisamos thanks to the efforts of Th. Tourloupakis containing a lovingly assembled collection of the materials of daily life from all areas of Crete. Kisamos. Kretike Estia 2, 283-5, publishes an account of work on the area of the Kentro Ygeias where earlier work had revealed mosaic pavements of the 4th Ct AD; in 1987 conser- vation on these allowed testing beneath which revealed superimposed pottery kilns, the earlier of the 1st Ct AD specializing in lamps, the later (following a heavy destruction) in amphorai, probably for export as the anc site would have been nearer the sea. This evidence allows the founding of the later city on this site to be dated to the 1st Ct AD. Other R remains were cleared during rescue work in 1987. Chairethiana. A cemetery of R tombs investigated in 1987 is reported in Kretike Estia 2, 290. Melidone. The tourist popularity of the cave necessitated investigation in 1987 (Kretike Estia 2, 305-7). E. Gabrilake- Nikoloudake reports on excavation in front of the entrance in the second part of the cave where the surface was level and sherds plentiful. The lowest level on the rock was deep and contained EM and N sherds; the layers above were characterised by MM IIB-LM I sherds with two 'altars' of rough stones, and a LM III pyre surrounded by conical cups. Wash with later finds was widespread. Around a stalagmite was a concentration of figurines of A and Daedalic to R date. Trials elsewhere in the cave to test this stratigraphy showed that other pyres, not exclusively LM III, existed and may have originated in usage other than cult (lack of special finds). A gap in usage seems apparent between LM III and A. Mesi: Lismata. Two LM III ChTs with larnax burials were reported by I. Tzedakis. Although they had not been looted, deep ploughing had destroyed them almost entirely. The better preserved was circular in plan, (1.70m diam.), and contained a sherd from a larnax with a Linear B ideogram. The burials are dated in the LM IIIA/B period (402). Monasteraki. Work by the University of Crete (A. Kanta) on the site of the German excavations during WWII is briefly reported (Kretike Estia 2, 313). A large Protopalatial complex of, to date, some 50 rooms has been cleared; the storage function is clear from the nature of the pottery and the presence of sealings. Destruction was by fire following a great earthquake; there was no further habitation until HL times. Mone Gonias (W side of Chania bay). The restoration of this 17th Ct building by the Byz Ephorate is reported; the Monast- ery's collection of icons and other treasures will be displayed when the work is finished (Aletheia 30.11.89).

Conservation work was carried out in 1981 on the foundations of House 1, while a surface survey was conducted in the Raphioli region, in the area surrounding the 1980 excavations; the results were not encouraging (398). Panormo. Rescue excavation revealed an area with M domestic wares (notably tripod feet) but without bones or tools; part of a figurine is the only other find (Kretike Estia 2, 310-1). Phalasarna. (AR 1988-9, 108-9.) The 1989 season under E. Hadzidaki and F.J. Frost (ASCS) was brief but the time was used advantageously on two important surveys. The entire line of the acropolis and harbour fortifications were traced for the first time, clearing brush thoroughly where necessary to locate corers accurately. In several locations structures or towers attached to the curtain walls were noted where none had been suspected before. Surveying and measuring the walls has produced an accurate map. In some cases the map has clarified the purpose of structures in the fortifications; in others it has raised new questions. A magnetometer survey was conducted by S. Papamarin- opoulos (University of Patras Laboratory of Geophysics and Seismology) with a team of graduate students. The readings produced have not yet been entirely translated into a map analog but the raw numbers show several obvious clusters of anomalies in both the harbour and the N basin which will be targeted for excavation in 1990.</page><page sequence="80">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 1989-90 81 In addition conservation was begun on the plastered cistern attached to the S tower. Experts from the Chania Museum began the laborious task of scraping hardened silt off the painted surface of the cistern. Only one or two patches of paint had been noted at the end of the 1988 season and had been reported as dark blue; the paint (or perhaps a sealant) is in fact black. The conservation workers also began clearing the last layer of silt from the floor of the cistern, which is made of pebbles set in plaster. Small-scale excavations were conducted in the area of the cemetery in 1981 by B. Niniou-Kindele, where a group of 28 tombs, 23 of which had been looted. They were cists but included one larnax burial, the pottery dating the group in the EHL period (401). Work on the harbour (now on dry land) and the cemetery in 1987 is reported in Kretike Estia 2, 287-90, with a plan of the whole site. Phylake Apokoronou. 1 km NW of the village, an important LM III Tholos tomb was excavated in 1981 by I. Tzedakis, the third in the Chania area (the others being at Stylo Apokoronou and Maleme Kydonias). A long, narrow dromos leads to a rectangular chamber with pyramidal roof. The tomb was cut into the rock and the chamber walls were of dressed stones; partly articulated bones lay scattered everywhere, including those of an adult and a child, while there are traces of a pyre from an animal sacrifice. The number of burials cannot be determined until the bones are studied. The offerings include gold and silver jewellery, ivory (pins, inlays and a comb) and sealstones of the highest quality. One burial at least was dated to LM IIIA2 and LM IIIA and B pottery was found in the dromos (398-9). Polyrrenia. Work was restarted on this important HL site by the Ephorate after 49 years (Kretike Estia 2, 285-7). Part of N wall, in pseudoisodomic masonry, was cleared adjacent to the semicircular tower noted by Halbherr. The wall was later incorporated into housing both inside and outside. Rock cut tombs were also investigated. Sempronas. The excavation of an ECh tomb is reported by P. Drosinou in Kretike Estia 2, 279-80. Sougia Selinou. (Anc. Syia) Small scale excavation was conducted in 1981 to locate and record the remains before the laying out of a new road. Sector I: 7 stone walls of a single building were revealed, forming a long (9m) corridor and 3 others surrounding a small plastered cistern. Sector II: Part of the roof of a built cistern was still visible, consisting of a long and narrow chamber, with a vaulted roof; a system of clay drains runs through the walls, channelling the water to the main chamber. To the W of the cistern, a rectangular well was discovered, communicating with the main chamber and dating to the R period (401-2). Sphakaki. (W of Stauromenos) Three 3rd Ct BC tombs (rectangular pits) were uncovered, part of a dense cemetery; the settlement probably lay at Roussa, N of Sphakaki (traces of walls, etc). The single undisturbed burial contained a skeleton in an extended position (404) Sphakia Survey (AR 1988-9, 109) A surface survey was begun in 1989 under the sponsorship of the Canadian Archae- ological Institute at Athens by J. Moody and L. Nixon: "The base for the first two weeks was the village of Anopolis, from which was surveyed the Anopolis Ridge and areas near Agios Ioannis. In the third week, work was centred at Agia Roumeli and on the coast near Agios Pavlos, but mainly at Livaniana and Loutro. For the next ten days most of the team concen- trated in the Madhares, with a base at Katsiveli. The rest spent the time revisiting sites and doing extensive work in the general area of Anopolis. After a week in Askyphou, the survey concluded with two weeks work in the Frangokastello area. The main results of the summer 1989 season can be summarized as follows: Agia Roumeli/Tarrha: reconnaissance in the touristic village on the W side of the river revealed PR material for the first time (a tripod foot, ?MM) as well as more IA material. A transect inland confirmed the presence of abundant PR and later material in the area W of upper Agia Roumeli. Madhares: until 1987, no archaeologist had ever looked for sites here; the results that year showed that further work would be worthwhile. The Madhares transects walked in 1989 have revealed some ten new sites; six of these have PR material, including Final N/EM. HL/R (and later) sherds were also found. Loutro/Phoinix: most of the peninsular was surveyed intensively at 25m. intervals. The E harbour is certainly where the village is (and where the ferries dock); the W harbour seems not to be in the bay called Phoinix, but in a small area to the S, now above sea level, as suggested by Ogilive in the 1950s. There are almost no sherds near Phoinix; but structures and sherds of R date were found around the edge of the suggested W harbour. The pottery from Loutro includes PR; some C/HL; and large quantities of R (Samian) and LR pottery (African Red Slip, Phocaean Red Slip). There is almost no ancient pottery later than the 7th Ct AD. Dr. E. Khatzidaki kindly permitted the examination of some of the pottery recovered from the sea in the E harbour, where the bottom has been disturbed by the car ferry in use since 1987. This material includes R, Venetian, and Ott pots, often complete vessels. Anopolis: this summer much of the Anopolis ridge - the centre of the ancient city - was surveyed intensively at 10m intervals. All of the pottery found on the ridge (in 1987 and 1988 as well as 1989) was examined. It is now clear that in addition to the PR, C, HL, R and later material there are A (and some possible G) sherds here. Askyphou: transects here confirmed the presence of PR material, and revealed a signifi- cant amount of LR pottery, particularly in the moder neigh- bourhood of Goni. Frangokastello Area: intensive work in this area revealed the existence of several PR sites and an abundance of LR material. There may also be a C/HL site in the vicinity of Patsianos. Extensive work also located sites elsewhere, e.g. in the mountain plain of Asphendou. Other Results: The geomorphology of the White Mountains does not seem to suggest actual glaciation, in contrast with the Ida Range where the effects of glaciation can be seen. But the White Mountains would certainly have been a periglacial area. One effect of the Ice Age in Sphakia would have been the compression of environmental zones, which would have limited the range of available habitats for plants and animals. Examination of the post-R pottery confirms that sherds of the 2nd Byz period are extremely rare. Pottery of Venetian date is relatively common; fragments of a vessel, possibly from Venice itself, were found this spring in the village of Samaria. Similarly, pottery of Ott date is abundant, with imports from various places (eg. 4anakkale). Finally, work on the site catalogue continued with the revision of old entries and the addition of new ones. Sherd densities have been manually plotted for all areas surveyed intensively in 1989. Detailed environmental data have also</page><page sequence="81">82 E. B. FRENCH been collected, as in previous seasons. The study of vernacular architecture progressed with selected structures in each area being drawn and photographed. Work on a list of villages (deserted and still occupied) has begun; there will also be an appendix on mitata (the Madhares)." Stauromenos: Sinanes. Small scale excavations were con- ducted in the area in 1981, where five pots had been found by E. Kokolakes in 1978. A cave-like tomb was uncovered, full of rubbish; the finds were negligible (a few sherds, carbonised wood, a broken human skull). Higher up the hill a circular structure was located (403-4). Surbritos: Kephala. (BSA 59 (1964)72) Continued excavation in 1987 of LM IIIC remains overlaid by R is reported (Kretike Estia 2. 312-3). Zoniana: Sentone cave. Tourist usage necessitated investiga- tion in 1987, reported by E. Gabrilake-Nikoloudake in Kretike Estia 2, 309-10. The results of some 16 test trenches can be summarised: in the outer chamber (1) (from the surface) modern, (2) with glazed sherds and glass, (3) copious N sherds, (4) level with patches of laid stones and gravel; in the second chamber (1) a little modern material, (2) burnt level, with above it, R stone vessel fragments and 1 coin, (3) again widely burnt but containing handmade black burnished wares, presumably N. LN occupation and R usage are thus proved; some LM III material was also identified. E.B.
