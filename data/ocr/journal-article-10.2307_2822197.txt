<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMPHIBIANS AND REPTILES OF CALIFORNIA. Califor- nia Natural History Guides #31. By Robert C. Stebbins; illustrated by the author. University of California Press, Berkeley, Los An- geles, and London. $2.75 (paper). 152 p. +8 pl.; ill.; no index. 1972. This book is highly recommended for students between 11 and 15 years of age who are interested in the herpetofauna of California. The first sec- tions give the young naturalist a fine introduction to field methods. General habitats for collecting and collecting methods are described. A nice dis- cussion of the rationale and utilization of note- taking, including warnings against anthropomorph- ism, is presented. Methods for maintaining captive animals are described, but Stebbins stresses con- servation, includes a list of endangered species, and points out that captive animals should be released if they do not feed well in captivity, or after a suitable amount of observation has taken place. Ample space is devoted to information on the general natural history and taxonomy of the herpetofauna. Two pages, which should be useful to the young naturalist, are devoted to aids in identification (scale location and the like). I was especially pleased that Stebbins referred the reader interested in more information to an advanced field guide. The remaining portion of the book is devoted to descriptions, ranges, habitats, food preferences, and habits of the resident species and includes illustra- tions of interesting behavioral responses, such as the</page><page sequence="2">SEPTEMBER 1973] NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 515 defensive posture of the California newt and the guarding of eggs by arboreal salamanders. The book is profusely illustrated and includes a number of very nice color plates. I feel that this book will receive a wide reader- ship among the young girls and boys interested in studying the California fauna. RICHARD P.
