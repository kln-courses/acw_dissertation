KEY WORDS: rock art; ritual: Central Australia. INTRODUCTION Rock art studies throughout the world have explicitly or implicitly invoked ritual as an activity associated with the production of rock art but the articulation between the structure of rock art assemblages and ritual behaviour is rarely made clear. In this paper we describe and apply a method for identifying ritual focused on the rock art of central Australia. We define ritual following Rappaport (1999, pp. 24-26) as 'the performance of more or less invariant sequences of formal acts and utterances not entirely encoded by the performers.'

More recently, 'neuropsychological' explanations involving shamans and altered states of consciousness experienced during ritual activities have been seen as the source of the subject matter depicted in rock art and have been widely adopted (e.g. Glottes and Lewis Williams, 1996; Lewis-Williams, 1981, 1997, 2001; Lewis-Williams and Dowson, 1988; Turpin, 2001; Whitley, 2000, 2005). While not always made explicit, ritual is also implied as the context in which art assemblages were created during 'aggregation' (e.g. Conkey, 1980, 1985; Gait-Smith, 1997; McDonald and Veth, in press) or 'information exchange' (e.g. Gamble, 1982; McDonald, 1994; Smith, 1989). The quite reasonable inference in many of these studies is that rock art results from ritual activity but it may well be that not all art recorded at such locations was produced for ritual purposes or during ritual performance. The ability to separate parts of rock art assemblages that formed an integral part of ritual performance from those created in different social contexts, would provide a clearer understanding of the role of rock art in ritual practices. The ready acceptance of ritual as an explanation for the production of rock art runs counter to other branches of archaeological research where ritual has been treated somewhat warily with critics labelling the term 'a catch-all for "odd" or otherwise not understood behaviour' (see Howey and O'Shea, 2006, pp. 261-262; Insoll, 2004, pp. 1-2). Ethnographic studies that associate rock art with ritual activities have provided researchers with a rich source from which to formulate hypotheses, and may well account for the general acceptance of ritual explana tions in this branch of the discipline. But archaeologists have rarely analysed the ethnographies to identify the particular signatures of ritual in rock art. Towards the close of the nineteenth century, ethnographers Baldwin Spencer and Frank Gillen (1899) published their first book on the customs and beliefs of central Australian Aboriginal people. This, and subsequent publications (1904, 1912,1927), included first-hand accounts of Aboriginal explanations and interpre tations of rock art assemblages in central Australia. These accounts, supplemented by correspondence between Spencer and British anthropologist James Frazer (Marett and Penniman, 1932; Mulvaney et al, 1997), became highly influential and were the source of generalisations about 'primitive' cultures and belief sys tems (e.g. Frazer, 1901, 1920, 1974) and rock art researchers drew on them when seeking explanations for the production of Upper Palaeolithic cave art in Europe (e.g. Cartailliac and Breuil, 1906, pp. 201-225). As Ucko and Rosenfeld (1967, pp. 116-138) observed, French researchers such as Reinach (1903), B?gouen (1929) and Breuil (1952) used ethnographic parallels based on the premise that both central Australian Aborigines and Palaeolithic cave artists were hunter-gatherers and were therefore likely to have had similar 'primitive' belief systems. Further, the researchers perceived similarities between European subject matter, where animals were the focus of analysis, and the totemic belief systems of central</page><page sequence="3">Rock art and Ritual: An Archaeological Analysis of Rock Art 307 Australian Aborigines in which each person related to a species of animal or plant. Comparisons between the contexts in which rock art was produced were also used to substantiate claims for similarities, as access to European cave art was physically restricted and access to the most sacred central Australian rock art sites was culturally restricted. Drawing on these perceived parallels, researchers inferred that Palaeolithic cave art, like central Australian rock art was produced as a form of 'sympathetic hunting magic' (Ucko and Rosenfeld, 1967; Bahn and Vertut, 1988, pp. 149-158) presumably in ritual circumstances. Significantly, later ethnographic research in central Australia (e.g. Edwards, 1966,1968,1971 ; Gunn, 1997; Meggitt, 1962; Mountford, 1948, 1960, 1968, 1971, 1976; Myers, 1986; Strehlow, 1947, 1965,1970) supported Spencer and Gillen's contention that much of central Australian rock art, at least in the recent past, was incorporated into belief systems. Nevertheless, there are few documented cases where the nature of the relationship between ritual and the production of rock art or the role of rock art in ritual activities is explained (but see Gould, 1969; Mountford, 1968, 1976). Ethnography has continued to provide useful information from which hy potheses relating ritual to the production of art in Palaeolithic Europe have been formulated. Conkey (1980) developed a theoretical framework that addressed the relationship between the form and structure of art assemblages and the aggregation of people in the past, which she applied to Upper Palaeolithic European art. Her framework had its genesis in the ethnographic observations of Yellen (1977) and Lee (1979) amongst the IKung San of southern Africa in which the primacy of ritual as the reason for aggregation was emphasised. Conkey hypothesised that art at aggregation sites, where affiliated groups of people came together, would be characterised by a greater diversity of design elements and structural prin ciples than dispersion sites that were essentially campsites in foraging territory where small groups of people engaged in subsistence practices. Conkey (1980, p. 610, 612) argued that the activities or processes that would contribute to, or even be 'central to,' the integration of the larger groups 'are likely to be ritual and cultural in nature'. She further stated that these activities 'are unlikely to leave direct archaeological indications'. We suggest that new theoretical frameworks for understanding ritual and methods for identifying it archaeologically are re quired if the social dynamics that link aggregation and ritual to particular rock art assemblages are to be understood. A more recent and very influential theoretical framework formulated from ethnographic sources has been become known as the 'neuropsychological' model (Lewis-Williams, 2001, pp. 332-357). Lewis-Williams (1981, 1997, 2001) drew on ethnography derived from observations of shamanic performances during rit uals in South America (e.g. Reiche!-Dolmatoff, 1978) and southern Africa (e.g. Bleek, 1935) to formulate a theory from which he sought explanations for the form and content of southern African rock art. He has subsequently extended the theory to Upper Palaeolithic cave art of Western Europe (Gottes and Lewis-Williams, 1996). Lewis-Williams and his colleagues (e.g. Lewis-Williams and Dowson,</page><page sequence="4">308 Ross and Davidson 1988; Clottes and Lewis-Williams, 1996) argue that in many ritual circumstances, people may enter trance or altered states of consciousness and that this is generally a characteristic of those people who are called 'shaman'. During altered states of consciousness, these people report 'seeing' geometric forms?although the vi sions are generated within their visual system, rather than through energy entering the eye from outside. For this reason, these visual effects are referred to as 'entoptic phenomena'. As well, there are indicators of two deeper trance states that can be identified in 'visual' forms characteristic of each phase or state although the forms themselves may be culturally derived (e.g. Lewis-Williams, 1981, 1997, 2001, p. 332; Lewis-Williams and Dowson, 1988; Noble and Davidson, 1993; Turpin, 2001; Whitley, 2000, 2001, 2005). Despite this cultural training of the entoptic phenomena, it is said that the lack of external stimulus means that there are purely neuropsychological results of entering a trance state. This neuropsychological model has been used to explain the content and composition of vast bodies of rock art throughout South Africa, Western Europe and America. The art is thought to reproduce images seen in trance states, often induced during ritual performances. We know of no ethnographic literature that describes the production of art during ritual, nor evidence that ties art produced after altered states of consciousness to the images witnessed during trance. Nevertheless, Lewis-Williams (2001, p. 333) pointed out that Reichel-DolmatofT (1978) has shown that people who go through trance states can continue to experience entoptic after images for several months after the trance event. This being so, it may well be that trance states induced during ritual might provide the mental template for some rock art assemblages but the rock art itself could have been produced well after the ritual, rather than as an integral part of ritual performance itself. The paucity of specific ethnographic evidence for the inducement of trance states through any physical or psychological means, or of the use of mind al tering drugs during Australian Aboriginal ritual performances in the recent past, is likely to have played at least some part in discouraging the adoption of the neuropsychological model within Australia (but see Bednarik, 1984; Clottes and Lewis-Williams, 1996; Sale, 1992; Chippindale et al, 2000). Pituri (Duboisia hopwoodii) or native tobacco (Nicotiana ssp), commonly chewed by central Aus tralian Aborigines, are only mild stimulants and are not psychotropic (Watson, 1983) and while ethnography documents some instances of food deprivation or social exclusion, these reports do not suggest that participants achieved an altered state of consciousness. Within Australia over the last two decades, interest has turned towards the ceremonial or ritual context in which rock art was produced although research questions have not been couched in these terms. The association of rock art with ritual has resulted from two separate, but interwoven strands of archaeo logical inquiry. The first has been the adoption of a theoretical perspective that sees art as a form of communication used as an adaptive strategy in the me diation of social relations through information exchange (e.g., Davidson, 1989;</page><page sequence="5">Rock art and Ritual: An Archaeological Analysis of Rock Art 309 Gamble, 1982; McDonald, 1994; Morwood, 1987; Smith, 1989; Wobst, 1977). The second has been the concept labelled 'intensification' where changes in the late Holocene archaeological record were attributed to growing social, economic and technological complexity (Lourandos, 1983) but see Bird and Frankel (1991) for a critique of the social evolutionary paradigm and the archaeological data on which Lourandos' assumptions are based). Implicit in the understanding of increased social complexity has been the exchange of information at large ceremonial gath erings. The argument about intensification of social relations has rested on arch aeological evidence such as numbers of sites, numbers of artefacts at sites and evidence of specialised techniques of food processing (e.g. Bird and Frankel, 1991, p. 9; Flood, 1980: Lourandos, 1983; Morwood, 1987; Smith, 1988, p. 43). But it has also been argued from increased numbers of art sites and greater ev idence for regional diversity of art (e.g. David and Chant, 1995; Ta?on, 1993). The introduction of new technology is seen as providing the resources necessary to facilitate the ethnographically documented gathering of large groups of people for ceremonial activities but the specific role that rock art might have played in these ritual activities or in 'social complexity' has not been articulated in either archaeological or ethnographic studies. While ethnography has provided stimulus for the formulation of theory as sociating rock art and ritual, it has also provided ample examples of rock art assemblages produced in secular contexts (see for example Layton, 2001, p. 312), cautioning against adopting the 'blanket explanation' (Bahn, 1998, p. 242) that all rock art was produced in association with ritual. Ritual, by any definition, involves performance of particular types but there are no identifiable depictions that reliably predict ritual activity. This paper, therefore, develops an argument from Rappaport's (1999) anthropological analysis of the universal form of ritual showing that an analysis of the structure of art assemblages provides the best means of identifying ritual activity associated with the production of rock art. Un derpinning this approach to the study of rock art is a set of assumptions about the structured nature of a corpus of rock art where the relationships between the motifs themselves and the physical and social contexts in which they were produced are a cultural construct and therefore meaningful. The focus of our approach then moves from the image alone to the relationships we perceive between the art and the contexts in which it was produced (Hawkes, 1977, pp. 17-18). This situates our study within structural approaches that have evolved over the past 40 years (see Conkey, 2001, pp. 273-310 for a comprehensive historical review). In this way, we address questions about the relations between social practice, in this case ritual, and rock art. Conkey (1985) recognised the potential of identifying ritual communication in the structure of past material culture, particularly rock art and portable art objects. These identifications will depend on the particular contexts of the materials and on their structural properties. Formalised repetitive, rule-bound systems for the creation of material</page><page sequence="6">310 Ross and Davidson forms, and formalised repetitive rule-bound contexts for the use of these forms are those features most likely to characterise material ritual communication. If archaeologists adopt a regional and diachronic perspective..., they can theoretically identify,... relative amounts or degrees of ritual communication. . Conkey 1985, p. 305 Conkey (1985, p. 305) warned that the relationship between structure, context and ritual outlined above should not be taken as a tested proposition or general law applicable to all societies. The more recent work of Roy Rappaport (1999) has elaborated Bloch's (1986) research on ritual and, in his synthesis, Rappaport described what he identified as 'the unique structure of ritual' universal to ritual whatever the content of individual performances. In this paper, we use Rappaport's synthesis to identify that 'unique structure of ritual' and go on to discuss a method to identify the relationship between rock art and ritual. We explore the potential of the theoretical framework by investigating the structure, the spatial distribution and chronological phases of the central Australian rock art assemblage throughout the arid zone. As outlined above, rock art research and ethnographic accounts suggest that some parts of the rock art assemblage played a role in negotiating interaction throughout the arid zone through information exchange in ritual or on ceremonial occasions. Until now there has been no way that these aspects of the assemblage could be identified, nor could the role that rock art may have played in such activities be assessed. Layton (1992, p. 1) defines art minimally as 'deliberate communication through visual form'. In searching for evidence of ritual behaviour, we are propos ing a method for understanding art by investigating the communicative inten tions of the artist, the visual form itself and, potentially, the message received by the viewer. This tripartite concept of art emphasises the interaction between the 'human agents and the material' (Davidson, 1995, p. 892, 1997, p. 128) and demonstrates that the understanding of the art form, not the art form itself, is the communicative link between artist and viewer. An analysis by observers of the art form and the context of its production thus provides the best means of assessing aspects of how the art system operated. Such an approach to prehistoric art 'lifts the heavy semantic load' (Wobst, 1992) because it is the relationships between art and the contexts of its production that inform, rather than just the content of the art itself (Conkey, 1989; Morphy, 1999, p. 21). Conceptualised in this way, we see art as the end product of a practice rather than as an object, and thus it remains connected to the participants (Conkey, 1989, p. 153). As Davidson (1995, p. 892,1997, p. 128) emphasised, it is through human agency that marks become meaningful; without the cognitive capacities of both the artist and the viewer, even highly structured marks would remain meaning less and not art. Therefore, patterns observed in archaeological data must be put into their context before we can formulate hypotheses about the actions of the artists.</page><page sequence="7">Rock art and Ritual: An Archaeological Analysis of Rock Art 311 RAPPAPORT'S THEORY AND ITS APPLICATION TO ROCK ART STUDIES American anthropologist, Roy Rappaport undertook lengthy research in Highland Papua New Guinea where he developed a deep interest in ritual (see Flannery, 1976 for other aspects of Rappaport's research adopted by archaeol ogists). His final publication moved beyond the ecological functionalism that was central to much of his earlier research on ritual amongst the Maring (1984; Robbins, 2001), to concentrate on the 'unique entailments of ritual's form' (1999, p. 31 ) and presented a theoretical argument about the nature of ritual and religion in all human societies. Rappaport's synthesis aimed to broaden understanding of ritual in every human society and isolate and illuminate the structural form com mon to all ritual. It is this concern with the structure of ritual rather than with the content of individual rituals that makes his research so pertinent to archaeological investigation. We propose a formal archaeological methodology aimed at identi fying ritual elements in rock art assemblages based on the structure Rappaport outlined. By identifying these features within central Australian rock art assem blages we argue that ritual was one social context in which rock art was produced in the distant past. Most significantly, this establishes a relationship between ritual behaviour and the production of rock art. Rappaport (1999, pp. 24-26) defined ritual as 'the performance of more or less invariant sequences of formal acts and utterances not entirely encoded by the performers' and argued that while this definition is broad and inclusive it never theless gives primacy to the 'features common to rituals always and everywhere'. Significantly, as this definition is to be related to a body of mostly prehistoric rock art where meaning cannot be retrieved, the definition 'does not stipulate what ritual is "about" or what it is "for"'. Rappaport (1999, p. 26) contended that the definition identifies not only the elements of ritual but that also stipulates enduring relations or structure among these features. He emphasised that while 'none of the elements constituting the structure are unique to ritual, the relations among them are.' Some additional explanations of the terms and concepts outlined in the defini tion of ritual are required. While Rappaport supported his definition with detailed discussion on what does not constitute ritual, we will focus here only on the iden tifiable forms of ritual. First, the definition stipulates that the performers of rituals do not specify all the acts and utterances constituting their own performances. 'They follow, more or less punctiliously, orders established or taken to have been established by others' (Rappaport, 1999, p. 32). Commonly, ritual actions are those that are sanctioned or canonised, in the view of the participants, by supernat ural powers (Rappaport, 1999, p. 38). The fact that these actions were evidently established by others, who are not present, makes a supernatural explanation more plausible.</page><page sequence="8">312 Ross and Davidson Second, Rappaport (1999, p. 33) described the constituting elements of the ritual as 'formal acts' and explained that 'ritual sequences are composed of con ventional, even stereotyped elements' such as 'stylised and often decorous gestures and postures and the arrangement of these elements in time and space are more or less fixed.' That is, they are regularly repeated at specified times at special places. The emphasis here is on behaviour that displays decreasing spontaneity and increasing formality. Third, Rappaport (1993, p. 36) deemed it necessary to add the phrase, 'more or less', to the definition of ritual as he allowed that a certain amount of variation is inevitable through time with the preference, introduction, rearrangement or discard of elements by performers undertaking rituals. The acceptance of the inevitability of some change does not detract from the central importance of the concept of invariance in Rappaport's definition. He concluded that the notion that the essential aspects of ritual were being maintained was always a consideration of those participating. The centrality of the concept of invariance in ritual was explained by Rappaport (1999, p. 41): Ritual displays or even flaunts its invariance, for in its very invariance it manifests or represents a specific order to which individuals ipso facto conform in performing them. Finally, the term, 'acts', implies that ritual differs from such things as myth in that performance is an intrinsic element. Ritual is not an object or an outcome but an activity undertaken by human performers and the 'manner of saying or doing is intrinsic to what is being "said" and "done" ' (Rappaport, 1999, p. 38, see also Finnegan, 1969; La Fontaine, 1977). Further, not only are performers involved in ritual activity, there are likely to be others present at proceedings and these people will participate in proceedings rather than being separated as a passive audience or as spectators with no influence on the outcome of proceedings. The roles of participants in ritual, however, may be highly differentiated and preordained and potentially, participants 'may leave the ritual performance with their statuses in some way formally transformed' (Rappaport, 1999, pp. 39-40). To summarise, the key features of the structure that Rappaport identified in ritual are: 1) Invariance 2) Repetition 3) Specialised time 4) Specialised place 5) Stylised behaviour/stylised form 6) Performance and participation 7) Form which can hold and transfer a canonical message If rock art were an integral part of ritual as has been suggested for parts of the central Australian assemblage, we hypothesise that these features should be</page><page sequence="9">Rock art and Ritual: An Archaeological Analysis of Rock Art 313 evident in the structure of the assemblage. Other 'check lists' have catalogued the characteristics or indicators that archaeologists could expect to find when inves tigating past ritual contexts (e.g. Renfrew, 1994, p. 51), which incorporate many of the seven features. In practice, Rappaport's concepts provide the most tangi ble features to identify ritual specifically in rock art assemblages. Significantly, Rappaport insisted that all the features of this ritual structure needed to be present. Ritual is commonly held as a form of communication (Insoll, 2004, p. 10). Rappaport (1995, p. 51) argued that, as such, its role in a given culture must be studied in tandem with other means of communication (see also Robbins, 2001, p. 592) in order to identify factors that are specific to each. Nevertheless, Rappaport largely ignored the role art of any type might have played in ritual. Rock art is the form of evidence of communication most familiar to archaeologists concerned with the past of hunter-gatherer societies. In considering ritual as a form of communication, Rappaport identified two types of messages. The first type is 'self-referential' or 'mundane' and as such 'concerns the current physical, psychic or social states of the performers' (Rappaport, 1999, p. 53). It can convey information about individual participants or about groups involved. The messages communicated are related to the here and now of the ritual and are conveyed using what Rappaport, following Peirce (1986), called indexical signs or indices. Rappaport (1999, p. 55) described an index as 'perceptible aspects of events or conditions signifying the presence or existence of imperceptible aspects of the same events or conditions'. In the standard examples, a rash might indicate the measles or smoke a fire. During ritual, a particular person leading the singing might be identified, on that basis, as the senior custodian, or another person may bestow gifts to indicate that the obligations of reciprocity are being acknowledged. In this way, the status or relationship of the individ ual or group is demonstrated. Self-referential or mundane messages concern the immediate, particular vital aspects of events (Rappaport, 1999, p. 53). The second type of message conveyed in ritual has been labelled, 'canonical' by Rappaport (1999, pp. 52-55). Canonical messages, while transmitted by ritual participants are not encoded by them. Rather, they are invariant messages about the nature of the world that participants take from ritual order and beliefs. They are concerned with nature, society or the cosmos and are not confined to the present or to a physical space. Hence, this type of message represents 'the general, enduring, or even eternal aspects of universal orders' (1999, p. 53, emphasis in original). Canonical messages are carried by the invariant aspects of ritual, which, because of their abstract nature, can only be founded upon symbols. Symbols as defined by Rappaport (1999, p. 54) are 'signs associated by law or convention with that which they signify.' If rock art were associated with ritual, the motifs would provide ideal 'sym bols' in which to convey the canonical messages identified by Rappaport. But just as it is not possible to recover the meaning of individual rock art motifs, it will not be possible to interpret the canonical message in an archaeological context; such</page><page sequence="10">314 Ross and Davidson meanings must, by definition, be learnt within a particular cultural convention. Neither are self-referential messages carried in indices likely to leave an archae ologically identifiable signature except in the broadest terms. Rappaport (1999, p. 31) concluded that: It seems apparent... that ritual is not simply an alternate way to express any manner of thing, but that certain meanings and effects can best, or even only, be achieved in ritual. Ritual is without equivalents or even... satisfactory alternatives. If, as Rappaport claims, 'ritual is an act basic to humanity', a theory which provides the means to identify ritual in rock art assemblages from hunter-gatherer societies will be far reaching and should provide the means to develop an under standing of the ways rock art was used in such activities. Rappaport is not alone in recognising ritual form (see e.g. Bloch, 1986; Smith, 1987, see also Insoll, 2004 for a review) but for the purposes of clarity, we have avoided lengthy discussion over particulars of the form that ritual takes and based our approach on Rappaport's synthesis. DEVELOPING A METHOD TO ANALYSE RITUAL IN CENTRAL AUSTRALIAN ROCK ART In central Australia, knowledge of the ritual significance of particular (but not all) rock art motifs is incorporated into present day Aboriginal ideology and detailed ethnographic accounts of Aboriginal beliefs and practices dating from the late nineteenth century provide additional interpretations of a small number of individual motifs. Yet the relationship between rock art forms and the behavioural contexts in which each form was produced remains unclear, with custodians attributing the origin of assemblages to supernatural beings, the Dream time An cestors (e.g. Edwards, 1966, p. 36). The antiquity of the totemic belief system of the Australian Aboriginal Dreaming and the associated ritual practices recorded in ethnographic accounts, have been the focus of a recent study by David (2002). David reviewed the exca vated evidence from four rock art complexes (Smith, 1988) in the eastern region of central Australia (Fig. 1), identified with ritual in the ethnographic records of Spencer and Gillen (1899, 1904, 1912, 1927) and Strehlow (1947, 1965, 1970). Like Smith, David (2002) concluded that rituals associated with these sites had a time depth dating to between 1,400 and 600 years ago. Further, Smith (1988) contended that the introduction of seed grinding technology evident in the ar chaeological record during this time provided the economic means to facilitate large-scale gatherings. A concomitant increase in ochre fragments in excavated sediments was interpreted as indicating that the use of ochre, usually associ ated with ritual activities, had become more common (Smith, 1988). While David</page><page sequence="11">Rock art and Ritual: An Archaeological Analysis of Rock Art 315 (2002, p. 50) recognised that rituals are 'frameworks for actions that are... socially mediated ... codified... performed... aimed at achieving something... and con sciously engaged' he did not show how ritual activity could be identified nor did he consider the role that the extensive rock art assemblages at all four of these locations may have played in ritual activities although he did consider assemblages in the other regions in the north of Australia. Going further, David (2002, p. 59) seemed to rule out the very possibility that rock art may have been integral to ritual performances citing a reconstructed version of a ceremony at one of the sites where Kimber and Smith ( 1987, p. 236) stated that the only traces of ritual likely to remain, even after a short time, are stone artefacts and hearths; they ignored the evidence of rock art. The extensive pigment and engraved assemblage found in central Australia provides an ideal database from which to investigate the hypothesised ritual struc ture based on Rappaport's argument. There are hundreds of rock art sites located in the gorges of the rugged central ranges and clustered on isolated rocky outliers within the vast sand ridge deserts, which together comprise the central Australian arid zone. In order to identify the structure of the rock art and to establish chrono logical and spatial patterning in the assemblage, one of us (JR) recorded a broad range of contextual data from 52 site complexes ( &gt; 20,000 motifs from 285 rock shelter and open sites) located across the ranges (Fig. 1) and sandridge deserts (Fig. 2) in the southern region of the Northern Territory (Fig. 3) (Ross, 2003). In order to identify Rappaport's ritual structure within the central Australian assemblage, it was necessary to formulate a methodology that enabled us to assess whether the required features were present (Ross, 2003). Some features were identified by recording or measuring particular elements from within the rock art assemblage, while other features were substantiated using associated lines of evidence. Invariance Invariance in ritual form results from the strict adherence to prescribed or sanctified set of rules that give the ritual act credence (Rappaport, 1999, pp. 36 37). Acts associated with the transmitting of messages encoded by the supernatural (canonical messages), in particular, are undertaken in a highly conventionalised way resulting in standardised performances, activities or objects. Therefore, in variance in the production of rock art associated with ritual could be reflected in the art assemblage in a number of different ways: the selection of motifs; in the means of producing the motifs; and in the physical context in which motifs were produced. These three attributes were recorded and analysed. Some variation in ritual form can result from individual or group decisions concerning aspect of the ritual that are not perceived by participants as sanctified. These variations would differ from ritual to ritual but, because of the imprecise</page><page sequence="12">316 Ross and Davidson ; ^JH&amp;Ti -V ^ *?$&amp;* **U S&amp;fi**^ :-3&amp;; ?S^fRE';'' Flg. 1.

Central Australian rock ait sites. nature of the rock art chronology in central Australia it is unlikely that such small changes will be identified at the scale of the archaeological record. As the identification of stylistic groupings within the central Australian assemblage was based on the similarity of form and context, it follows that within each group, motifs must share a degree of invariance. The degree of invariance depends, in part, on the tightness of the definition we employed for each group as well as the time period over which the group was produced. Invariance was compared between motif classes, technique used and the context of production. Repetition Repetition is tightly aligned with invariance in the identification of ritual activities. An act or performance needs to be repeated numerous times in the same form if it is to be considered a formalised act adhering to a prescribed form. Rappaport calls this 'punctilious performance'. If rock art were associated with ritual behaviour, we would expect to find repetition of a particular suite of motifs in a similar context within a particular location or in the same form within other similar locations depending on the distribution of the particular ritual.</page><page sequence="15">Rock art and Ritual: An Archaeological Analysis of Rock Art 319 Repetition has also been identified as an element commonly used within indi vidual rituals as an aid to heighten awareness and stimulate the senses (Rappaport, 1999, pp. 228-229). Used in this way, we would expect to find repetition of indi vidual motifs or groups of motifs on the same panel or face. The use of repetition in a number of other ways would also result in individual motifs clustering on a single panel or in a restricted area. The use of repetition has long been used as a didactic tool to aid learning when facts need to be remembered verbatim (Merrill, 1983). Strehlow (1970, p. 115) recorded an Aboriginal man in central Australia recalling his learning experiences where the use of repetition was adopted; 'my elders kept on repeating these ceremonies time and again in my presence: they were afraid that I might forget them'. Educational theorists like Merrill (1983, p. 323) contend that repetition is the essential element of rote learning and can be aided by mnemonic devices, which can include actions, intonations or visual prompts. The use of rock art in this manner was documented during fieldwork when a senior Aboriginal Custodian, on seeing a large concentric circle on a rocksheiter ceiling, recounted a complex story about the travels and activities of an Ancestral Woman (Ross, 2003). It may well be that rock art motifs were produced as mnemonic devices in association with the teaching of aspects of ritual or ceremony so that similar motifs viewed at a later date would assist the person to recall the information accurately. If motifs were produced as mnemonic devices each time a teaching session was repeated, panels with clustered motifs would result, or alternatively, existing motifs would have been re-emphasised by re-marking or rubbing. Repeated production of any motif at a particular place suggests that there may have been some benefit that accrued to the artist producing the motif, which might account for its recurring production. If this were so, repetition in the rock art assemblage should not be seen as 'redundancy'. Redundancy, in communication theory, is measured by the quantity of repetition in the message (Layton, 1991, p. 145). Repetition or redundancy is seen as a measure of the inefficiency of the mode of communication to transmit the desired message with as little imperfection as possible. This is why repetition is important in instruction. Novel information always tends to be imperfectly internalised in the first instance. Given that initial explanations which divulge the meanings of rock art motifs to the human viewer or participant have to be verbal, repetition of the production of motifs would not be necessary once the meaning had been voiced. If however, production of the motif itself were perceived as a vital ritual action and the audience a supernatural one, repetition might be seen as a means of ensuring that the message was received. In this case, the producer would have no immediate interaction with the intended audience to gauge if the message had been received so that numerous repetitions might be needed to ensure the desired outcome rather like the offering up of daily prayers in religious communities today so we are told. The production of rock art as a means of communication leaves a permanent (or near permanent) mark, which provides tangible evidence to both the supernatural audience and other community</page><page sequence="16">320 Ross and Davidson members that the ritual has been enacted. Repetition is a central structuring feature of ritual form. In recording rock art repetition can be recorded at three levels: (1) repetition of motifs across the region; (2) repetition of motifs within a site complex (group of sites closely associated in space and context); (3) repetition of motifs on individual rock panels. Specialised Time Rappaport (1999, p. 33) argued that 'rituals are regularly repeated at times established by the clock, calendar, biological rhythm, ontogeny, physical condi tion, or defined social circumstance'. In reviewing the archaeological data as sociated with rock art complexes in central Australia, there is little evidence to indicate which of these factors would have governed the timing of ritual. The one exception is the presence of large numbers of grindstones located in the camping areas associated with gorge complexes or on surface deposits within rockshelters. The presence of grindstones indicates that the availability of ade quate resources (in this case, seeds), in sufficient quantities to feed large numbers of people over the period required for ritual activities, was a factor regulating aggregation. Spencer and Grillen (1899, pp. 169-170) and Strehlow (1970, p. 95) have pointed out that the reliability of water and availability of food resources at centres used for ritual purposes influenced the timing of ceremonies in the recent past. Myers (1986, p. 78) recorded that Pintupi ceremonies were held in winter after rain or into spring (August-September) but only when specific seeds were available and clay pans filled with water. Hamilton (1987, p. 45) noted that in the Western Desert ceremonies would be held either in hot times when large numbers of people and animals fell back on the reliable waters or at the end of autumn if rains had been good as this would be the period of major grass seed availability. A review of rainfall records for central Australia shows that rain is more likely to fall during the summer months. However, the records also demonstrate that rainfall is highly unpredictable so that large gatherings like those recorded in the ethnographic period (e.g. Hamilton, 1987; Myers, 1986; Tindale, 1974) could not have been planned on a regular seasonal basis. Smith (1986, 1988) has argued that in the last 1,400 years or so, large aggregations of people were financed by the utilisation of seed resources. He based his argument on the timing of the introduction of grindstones in excavated deposits and the abundance of surface grindstones at locations known as ceremonial sites in the ethnographic record. The optimum time for such meetings would obviously have been when abundant seed resources were available at the end of summer and autumn following good rains. It is likely that prior to 1,400 BP, aggregations of people would also have depended on other favourable seasonal conditions even though they would not have been reliant on seed grinding technology. Therefore,</page><page sequence="17">Rock art and Ritual: An Archaeological Analysis of Rock Art 321 the timing of earlier gatherings was also likely to be opportunistic, but, without seed resources, gatherings may have been limited to smaller groups of people or a shorter period of time than those recorded in the ethnographic record. Although the timing of the aggregation of people in central Australia would have to have been opportunistic, it is likely that people in the past would have taken advantage of the reliable availability of grass seeds after rainfall to meet neighbouring groups to ensure that social networks were maintained. Therefore, if the performance of ritual was one reason for aggregation, the timing of ritual activity was likely to have been undertaken whenever seasonal conditions allowed and, while this may not have been at regular intervals, people would have expected to meet with others in favourable seasons. Examples of all rock art styles identified in the central Australian region were located at complexes where there are dense scatters of occupation debris associated with the assemblage and in locations which would have provided food resources for people to aggregate. In addition, all rock art complexes recorded could have provided adequate water resources for aggregation in favourable seasons. The timing of ritual in central Australia would have been constrained by the climate and, to that degree, the timing of ritual would have been predictable. Specialised Place Rappaport (1999, p. 33) contended that rituals would be performed in speci fied contexts or places. A number of similarities in the characteristics of locations where rock art has been produced in central Australia have been identified, which suggest that many of these places may be considered to be 'specified contexts'. First, comprehensive surveys showed that rock art was not present at many lo cations where topography and resources provided what would appear to be ideal locations for its production (Ross and Abbott, 2004). The absence of rock art (and little associated archaeological evidence indicating occupation) in some places and its production in locations elsewhere with similar resource availability, suggests that some locations were selected for the production of both painting and engrav ing. These selected locations may therefore be considered 'specialised places.' Second, the analysis of patination, superimposition and relative weathering of the central Australian assemblage has demonstrated that once a place has been marked, additional motifs are likely to be added to the site over an extended period of time (Ross, 2003, p. 269). The addition of motifs at particular locations is demonstrated at all the large engraved sites with the accumulation of thousands of motifs in some gorges and hundreds of motifs at a number of the painted and stencilled sites. Some of the larger engraved complexes have examples of all the stylistic groups of motifs indicating that these locations have remained the focus for the production of rock art over an extended period of time.</page><page sequence="18">322 Ross and Davidson The repeated production of rock art within a restricted area indicates that once a place is marked with rock art, it is drawn into the cultural framework of those who produce and view the rock art and in this way often became the locus for future rock art production. The analysis of the structure and composition of rock art complexes shows that the number of sites and the size of motif assemblages vary markedly between complexes (Ross, 2003). Although it cannot be assumed that the size and compo sition of the assemblage correlates directly with the significance of the location at any particular time, it may provide some indication of places that were peripheral to ritual activities. Three general types of rock art complexes were identified al though each shares some characteristics with the others: Type 1, large open sites containing engraved assemblages, often with associated pigment art; Type 2, mul tiple rocksheiter sites containing pigment art, often with a small assemblage of engravings; and Type 3, small complexes made up of one or two spatially discrete engraved or pigment art sites with few motifs that, perhaps, represent a single episode of rock art production. The significance of particular areas within rock art complexes may have changed over time. Ethnographic accounts indicate that specific rockshelters, engraved panels or even single motifs hold sacred significance over other aspects of the rock art assemblage at the same complexes. However, as Spencer and Gillen (1899, p. 632) pointed out, the form of motifs alone does not provide a measure of their sacred significance so that it is difficult to draw conclusions on a finer grained level about the significance of specific motifs within each complex at different periods of time. The repeated production of a motif class on a single rock panel or face gives some indication of the significance of particular motifs; a measure we have used to identify areas of concentrated production and possible ritual activity. Panels or faces where multiple repetitions of motifs occur are likely to have been considered 'specified contexts'. Similarly, the dense overlay of motifs on particular rock faces or panels suggests that these places too, may hold particular significance within the complex. Engravings on some faces in the region are so dense that it is now impossible to identify individual motifs suggesting that marking of this panel was either undertaken by large numbers of people or carried out frequently. The third aspect, which suggests that locations may be considered 'specified contexts' is illustrated by contemporary Aboriginal beliefs. Bradley (2000, p. 29) emphasised the significance of ritual being undertaken at special places where the sacred world is revealed. The sacredness of particular locations is recounted in ethnographic and present day accounts of the central Australian landscape. Strehlow (1947, pp. 25-26) explained that the landscape: ... was transformed into its present shape through the labours of the great totemic ancestors. Each totemic centre has a cave or a soak or a waterhole which marks the spot whence the original ancestor first issued forth; and.. .all his succeeding deeds are ineradicably recorded</page><page sequence="19">Rock art and Ritual: An Archaeological Analysis of Rock Art 323 in the landscape which was changed into its present form by his all-powerful, creative presence. Although the documentation of present day beliefs has not been the focus of this paper, it is clear that knowledge of the activities of the Totemic Ancestors at each of the larger rock art complexes is retained by Traditional Custodians. Great significance is attached to each site but many of the more sacred stories relating to each location are known to only a small number of the most senior Elders. Visits to some sites are restricted to senior males and formalised behaviour is adopted when approaching the most sacred areas (Dick Kimber personal communication). This range of behaviour demonstrates that some rock art complexes are considered to be highly 'specialised places' by Aboriginal people today. However, we cannot assume that the current Aboriginal belief system provides adequate explanations for the entire rock art assemblage representing thousands of years of production. But the repeated production of single motifs at major rock art complexes, currently perceived as sacred places, attests to the significance of these places over an extended period of time. Formal or Stylised Behaviour or Image In adopting the term, stylised, we mean to identify aspects of the assem blage that are formalised or conventionalised and that oppose the informal or spontaneous (Rappaport, 1999, p. 34). Stylised behaviour and image differ from those used in day to day activities in that the focus is on key elements of the performance or image while other elements perceived as less significant are re duced or eliminated. Therefore, stylised images in rock art result from stereotypi cal or formalised behaviour, which produces rigid conventionalised motif forms. Motifs produced as part of ritual performance during which formalised or stylised behaviour has been adopted, may take two different forms. The first motif form may have an iconic reference but the motif will be produced so that the iconic elements are reduced or simplified to include only those necessary to communi cate information to the selected audience (see Davidson et al, 2005; Ross, 1997). The absence of an obvious iconic relationship between the motif and that which it signifies can be seen as an advantage in situations where ritual encodes concepts and ideas not related to the real world. The identification of the iconic relationship between the motif form and the object or idea it signifies may not be apparent in prehistoric rock art assemblages. The second motif form may be elaborate and highly formalised, producing images that may have visual indices (such as a halos in religious paintings) to differentiate them from day to day images. Therefore, stylised behaviour will produce iconography that is formalised in a manner where the image could either be reduced to a simple motif or be highly elaborated.</page><page sequence="20">324 Ross and Davidson Significantly, the motif form of the majority of the central Australian rock art assemblage, excluding animal tracks is not representational but geometric. Formalised or geometric symbols have been used to encode information in a way that is not obviously derived from nature (see Munn, 1973). Although the iconic reference is not obvious in the geometric aspects of the rock art assemblage, we would argue that, using Rappaport's description, all geometric motifs with their simplified or formal structure and the invariant form in which they are repeated could be classified as stylised images. Without the potential limitation of iconic ity, geometric motifs can encode a wide range of meanings, some simple, some complex (e.g. Morphy, 1980). Complex supernatural concepts can be encoded in a single motif. The meaning of geometric motifs must be explained to people unfamiliar with the system (Morphy, 1987, p. 31). The fact that the meaning of geometric art must be learnt before it can be understood makes it particularly suited to any communication system in which access to information is restricted. Some aspects of restricted meaning are likely to have been encoded in the performance of ritual that resulted in the geometric motifs. Each geometric motif can have many layers of meaning at the same time (Morphy, 1987, 1991; Munn, 1973), with the meaning of each layer restricted or revealed as desired according to the audience. Spencer and Gillen (1899, pp. 144-151; 1912, pp. 207-217) demonstrated the multi-layered levels of meaning of geometric motifs utilised on churingas (sacred stones) in central Australia and, although it is not documented by ethnographers, such multi-layering of meaning must have been embedded in the coeval rock art assemblage as well. Performance and Participation Performance is one of the distinguishing features of ritual identified by Rappaport (1999, pp. 37-^46). He contended that ritual is a joint practice rather than a solitary one. First, the production of rock art is an activity, so the existence of rock art implies the performance of that activity. Second, we have argued that rock art is a form of communication, which potentially transmits a message to a viewer. What is difficult to determine archaeologically is whether the audience was present at the time of production and, if so, what role they might have played in the production of rock art, or in later activities associated with rock art. Aspects of the morphology of the topographic location of rock art panels, sites and complexes, which could have played a role in restricting audiences or conversely, exposing rock art to all comers were documented: 1) topography; 2) orientation of art panel; 3) access to art panel; 4) location of art on panel. The morphology of the immediate locality in which rock art was produced provides some indication of the size of the potential audience. The area of floor space in each rocksheiter was measured and sketch plans of all gorges prepared in order to determine if space adjacent to</page><page sequence="21">Rock art and Ritual: An Archaeological Analysis of Rock Art 325 rock art panels was adequate for participants to gather (Ross, 2003, pp. 276-278). The relationship of rock art panels within each site complex to general habitation areas and water sources was also plotted so that the potential viewing audience could be assessed. For example, motifs beside scarce water reserves are likely to be seen by the entire population, while motifs in clefts difficult to access might have a restricted audience. Orientation of, access to, and location on an art panel, provided additional information about the visual dominance of motifs. The areas adjacent to much of the central Australian rock art assemblage are not adequate to facilitate the large scaled ceremonial gatherings recorded in the ethnographic record. Such gatherings, involving large numbers of people (100 or more), would require a vast area if all participants needed to view the art simultaneously. However, participation in individual ritual activities may have involved much smaller numbers. Spencer and Gillen ( 1899) published photographs of rituals enacted at the end of the nineteenth century that show small groups of 20 or fewer participants indicating that, while large numbers of people gathered for ceremony, the actual number participating in individual rituals may have been quite low. Prior to the widespread introduction of seed grinding technology, numbers of people participating in ritual would have been constrained by resource availability and therefore smaller groups would be expected to have aggregated. Re-marking, repainting, outlining and abrading of existing motifs provides the strongest archaeological evidence for participation by people, other than the original artist, in the production of rock art. All were documented. While these four types of interaction with the art assemblage leave an archaeologically visible trace, simply rubbing the motif with a hand during ritual, as has been documented in the ethnographic record (Mountford, 1968, pp. 69-70) does not leave a mark. It is likely, therefore, that the amount of interaction between participants and rock art motifs is under-represented in our recordings. In addition, areas that have an abraded appearance may have been rubbed innumerable times so that the interaction with some motifs could represent multiple episodes of rubbing or re-marking. Motif Form That Can Hold and Transfer a Canonical Message For Rappaport (1999, p. 54) canonical messages are those transmitted by the participants in ritual but only when such messages had already been defined by convention. It is this coding in an index that enables canonical messages to carry supernatural meanings. All rock art motifs are symbols in that they are signs associated by convention with that which they signify (Davidson, 1999), so all can potentially hold canonical messages. There are other structural characteristics that can be used to identify which particular elements of the rock art assemblage are likely to hold and transfer canonical messages. As they are concerned with enduring concepts relating to the natural order of the cosmos, the motifs are</page><page sequence="22">326 Ross and Davidson seen as symbols of the seemingly unchanging nature of the information encoded. Therefore, if a rock art assemblage were to encode canonical messages, we would expect to find both invariance and persistence in the form and context of the motifs involved. Persistence was recorded in motif classes and the context of production. The degree of invariance evident in the assemblages has been already been addressed so we will restrict our discussion here to persistence. Several physical qualities inherent in all rock art contribute to its persistence and make it ideal for the communication of canonical messages. Once a motif has been engraved on a hard rock surface, it can remain visible and unchanged for many thousands of years in a desert environment. Even painted motifs on stable and protected surfaces may outlive many generations of humans so that motifs can be retained or rein corporated into later systems of communication. This makes rock art particularly appropriate for use in strategies that involve a concern with the past when 'the past is used to validate the edicts of the present' (Wobst, 1992, p. 15). Such a concern for the past is evident today where the actions of the Ancestral Heroes during the Alcheringa (Spencer and Gillen, 1899, 1912, 1927; Strehlow, 1947, 1965, 1970) provide explanations for present day world order in central Australia. Additional qualities inherent in rock art assemblages reinforce its position as an ideal medium for messaging. Rock art, once produced remains where it was produced, thus providing an ideal visual means to communicate information pertaining to the relationship of people to place. Other forms of communication lack the same quality of permanent locus and it is this very quality that 'lends an impression of solidarity' to the assemblage (Wiessner, 1990, p. 110). The geometric form of much of the central Australian rock art assemblage may have been a factor in the persistence of some motif forms across millennia. If the messages encoded in geometric motifs bear little or no iconic reference to their meaning, meanings can be changed to suit the situation or audience, but, of particular importance for the persistence of a rock art assemblage, new meanings can be attributed to a motif thus reincorporating the motif into a later communication system long after the original meanings have been lost (e.g. King cited in Walsh, 2000, p. 1). Thus the meanings of motifs that remain visible over many thousands of years may have been preserved, revived or totally revised (Davidson, 1999, p. 121; Davis, 1990, p. 24; Ross, 2005). While a particular meaning may become redundant, new meanings can be devised to replace the old without the motif dropping out of use. Such a system would have been ideally suited to the high-risk environment of central Australia where major drought events would have resulted in lengthy disruption to the distribution of people in the landscape or even periods of abandonment in some areas (see also Poirier, 1992 for the same view of ceremony). An example of the revival of meaning is evident in the recent past. The post-contact period in central Australia led to disruption of traditional life and ethnographers record that they were unable to find knowledgeable informants to interpret engraved rock art assemblages (e.g. Worsnop, 1897, p. 45). It may be</page><page sequence="23">Rock art and Ritual: An Archaeological Analysis of Rock Art 327 that informants could have withheld information in the past. Today, large portions of the rock art assemblage in central Australia can be interpreted by Aboriginal Custodians (see for example Gunn, 1995). It may well be that a revival of interest in rock art following increased tourism in central Australia and the recognition of Aboriginal Land Rights and Native Title has led to the reincorporation of the rock art assemblage within the framework of understanding maintained by Aborigines across other media. The reincorporation of existing motifs where the human origin is unknown, means that the message encoded in the motifs can very easily be attributed to the supernatural and the messages identified as canonical. In a similar way, words persist in sacred songs long after their meaning is lost as the use of Latin in the Catholic Mass showed. Strehlow (1971, p. 186) in his comprehensive analysis of the Aboriginal songs of central Australia revealed that the Arrernte (Aranda) once possessed a special and very extensive vocabulary used exclusively in verse, which could not be translated 'exactly' even by the performers. A number of words and phrases from the songs recorded by one of us (Ross, 2003, p. 283) could not be translated by a present day authority on the language (Cliff Goddard personal communication, 2002). Goddard classified the unknown phrases as 'archaic' words commonly found in songs associated with ritual song cycles. Verses of the songs are learnt by rote, little by little as the person becomes more senior. Participants in ritual singing learn the verses believed to have been passed down from the Ancestral Beings since time immemorial, so that words no longer in common use in everyday situations remain embedded in song. It is not the prerogative of humans to change words (or motifs) that have been encoded as elements of the Dreaming (see also Rosenfeld, 2005, p. 171-184). ROCK ART AND RITUAL? Analysis of the field records in this framework showed that much of the entire central Australian assemblage, across all media, is characterised by panels of repeated motifs (Fig. 4) produced using a similar and persistent vocabulary of core motifs (Ross, 2003, 2005). While there are no direct dates for any parts of the rock art assemblage as yet, results from a number of relative or indirect dating methods including analysis of motif superimpostion, relative weathering, subject matter and style as well as consideration of geological indicators and associated excavated evidence, indicate that rock art has been produced over an extended period of time. The earliest engraved motifs are likely to have been produced in the late Pleistocene or early Holocene (Rosenfeld and Smith, 2002; Ross, 2003; Chapter 6). The most recent assemblage, produced in a wide variety of techniques (painting, drawing, printing, stencilling, pecking, pounding or incising), includes depictions of camels and horses demonstrating that some rock art at least, was produced after European settlement of the region from the 1860s.</page><page sequence="24">328 Ross and Davidson Fig. 4. Repeated circles and tracks, Roma Gorge. As rock art has been produced in central Australia over thousands of years, it is unlikely, considering that the archaeological record attests to considerable changes in many aspects of human behaviour (Smith, 1988; Thorley, 1998), that the same rituals would have continued in the same form over such an extended period of time. Therefore, we might expect to find rock art associated with a number of different ritual forms with different ritual contents so that although these should share the same structuring features, they may not necessarily encompass the same sets of motifs or contexts of production. Nine distinct stylistic groups of motifs were identified in the central Australian assemblage based on form and subject matter, methods of production and the physical contexts in which they were produced (Ross, 2002, 2003, p. 259-260). The stylistic groups vary in size and encompass different but not necessarily discrete chronological periods; some coexist, some are sequential, some are broad and inclusive and some are small and particular, some span thousands of years and others only a few hundred. Here we will restrict our discussion to a sample of three of the stylistic groups, which we have compared with the ritual model. &lt; The first group of motifs (Group i) are amongst the oldest components of the rock art assemblage and are likely to be many thousands of years old (Ross, 2003, p. 259). Motifs are patinated and frequently depict animals such as lizards, birds and unidentified quadrupeds. Each motif has been produced by creating an infill of discrete peck marks rather than by pecking or abrading an outline (Fig. 5).</page><page sequence="25">Rock art and Ritual: An Archaeological Analysis of Rock Art 329 Fig. 5. Group i motifs: bird, Orange Creek. The second group, (Group ii), are painted formal motifs, often bichrome, produced in a form larger than other components of the assemblage and with a distinctive clustering pattern of distribution throughout the region (Fig. 6). The motifs evident today are likely to have been produced over the last five hundred years or so (Ross, 2003, p. 259). The final group, (Group iii), consists of hand stencils, hand prints and hand outlines (Fig. 7). The production of this stylistic group is likely to have had its origin more than 1000 years ago (perhaps much longer) but many examples, especially hand prints and outlines, were produced into the very recent past (Ross, 2003, p. 259). Rappaport (1999, pp. 31-32) argued that 'no single feature of ritual is peculiar to it' but that it is the 'conjunction of its features that it is unique'. The presence of one, or a few of the features listed in the previous section would not be sufficient to make claims about the association of rock art and ritual behaviour. Instead, it is the interrelationship of all aspects of ritual behaviour that should be evident in the each of the stylistic groups before such associations can be suggested. Group i Motifs Comparative analysis showed that there are a number of structural features common to all ritual behaviour that cannot be identified in Group i motifs.

Group iii motifs: handstencils, Watarrka.</page><page sequence="28">332 Ross and Davidson repetition is not a strong feature with intaglio lizards the only motifs repeated within individual rock art panels or within art complexes. Neither did the pro duction of intaglio motifs persist over an extended period of time as would be expected in a conventionalised practice. Nor could evidence for participation of others in activities associated with these motifs such as re-marking or re-use be established. In fact, the location of several of these motifs in inaccessible places, high on cliff faces suggests that immediate interaction with these motifs by par ticipants or performers would have been extremely difficult. In the absence of all the structural features universal to ritual, we cannot argue that the Group i motifs were produced as part of ritual activities. Group ii Motifs Repetition within individual rock panels and within site complexes is a strong feature of Group ii motifs. There is a distinctive pattern of motif repetition across the region although different motifs are visually and/or numerically emphasised at particular locations. However, selection of motif classes in this group all fall within a core vocabulary of formal motifs that could encode a canonical message and all motifs were produced across the region. Sites where these motifs are recorded are those associated with ritual in ethnographic times (see also Gait-Smith, 1997) so that the locations can be classified as specialised places where people congregated at specialised times. In addition, most Group ii motifs have been re-marked in some way indicating continuation of a convention and participation of others at the sites. For example, examination of large striped motifs at Emily Gap, revealed layers of repainting (Fig. 8) while panels of spoked circles at Rainbow Valley have been outlined with numerous drawn lines. As all the structural features associated with ritual can be identified in this group of motifs, it can be argued that this assemblage is likely to have been produced in a ritual context. Further, it might be suggested that the distinctive distribution of Group ii motifs with a localised focus on one particular motif, suggests that the content of ritual practices associated with each different motif are likely to be localised. But the consistency in the structure of Group ii motifs indicates that the actual rituals are likely to have taken a similar form in the areas where these motifs are found. Group Hi Motifs Hand stencils, hand prints and hand outlines have a number of distinctive structuring features. Rappaport (1999, pp. 54-105) argued that 'self-referential' messages would be transmitted to others during ritual using 'indices' and these would carry information concerned with the current physical or social state of the participants. Messages that carry self-referential information must, however, vary to some degree if they are to carry information relating to the immediate states of</page><page sequence="29">Rock art and Ritual: An Archaeological Analysis of Rock Art 333 Fig. 8. Group ii motifs: evidence of repainting, Emily Gap. the performers otherwise differences between individuals could not be discerned. The variation in the shape of individual hand motifs and the location of the motif provides the means for others to identify the producer. One view is that individuals producing hand motifs were 'signing the land' (Bradley, 1997) in a very personal way that could be acknowledged by those present at the time and by a limited number of others who either recognised the particular hand on a later occasion or by those to whom authorship had been divulged. As hand motifs are indices denoting the producer, they would be an ideal medium to transmit self-referential messages related to ritual. But these would be rituals associated with matters 'of this world' (mundane ritual) rather than rituals pertaining to the supernatural. As hand motifs are obviously produced by individuals, it is unlikely that authorship of them would have been assigned to supernatural powers in the past. Indices must be repeated frequently enough to become a convention. The extensive panels of hand motifs produced in a similar manner in rockshelters and overhangs throughout central Australia demonstrate that the production of hand motifs is highly conventionalised. Superimposition analyses demonstrate that the production of Group iii motifs has persisted over an extended period of time in a similar manner. While, in some cases, hand motifs have been produced as part of small assemblages in individual rockshelters, and may represent a single artistic episode, these rockshelters form part of larger rock art complexes indicating that the places chosen for the production of these motifs were not selected randomly</page><page sequence="30">334 Ross and Davidson so could be thought of as specialised places. Analysis showed that locations where Group iii motifs were produced, contrary to some other parts of the central Australian assemblage, were likely to contain evidence of general habitation such as grindstones, hearths and stone tools. The presence of children's hand motifs at many of these sites indicating that access to these sites were not restricted and supports the contention that handstencils are likely to relate to mundane ritual. While motifs resulting from hand prints and hand stencils do not differ markedly from the actual shape of the hand, Ross (1997, pp. 113-114) argued that hand stencils are stylised (cf. Rosenfeld, 1993, pp. 9-10) as artists choose where to place the hands, whose hand to represent, how to display the fingers and what colour of ochre to use. This means that although hand motifs are representational, they can encode information about the producer and can be described as stylised as outlined by Rappaport (contra Forge, 1991). Drawn hand outlines are more loosely representational and are typically characterised by the depiction of extremely broad fingers with the outline closed at the wrist. This conventional depiction may have evolved from the frequently observed habit of outlining existing stencilled or printed hands. Outlining of pre-existing motifs of all types was documented in the central Australian assemblage and is seen as a form of re-marking or participation. The production of multiple hand motifs from different individuals at particular sites (up to 400 hand stencils) attests to the participation of many individuals in this practice and/or the repetition of this ritual act. The indexical quality of hand motifs and the presence of all features universal to ritual and the widespread nature of this practice enables us to argue that hand stencils, hand prints and hand outlines are likely to have been produced in self referential (or mundane) ritual contexts practised throughout arid central Australia. In summary, analysis of the relationship between the structural features of the central Australian art assemblages and the content and contexts in which they were produced has enabled us to differentiate between aspects of these assemblage that may be associated with ritual activities and those that are not. Further, the application of this method has enabled us to argue that while both Group ii and iii motifs were likely to have been produced as part of ritual actions, changes and differences in the content and form of these parts of the assemblage suggest that the form of ritual may have changed through time and that different ritual forms may have been practised contemporaneously. CONCLUSIONS Identification of Rappaport's seven features of ritual structure necessitated the development of a range of specifically directed analytical methods. While some of these were relatively straightforward others proved more difficult to assess in the central Australian assemblage.</page><page sequence="31">Rock art and Ritual: An Archaeological Analysis of Rock Art 335 The success of the method was somewhat dependent on the original classifi cation of stylistic groups within the central Australian assemblage. It was easier to identify 1 ) invariance and 2) repetition in groups that were narrowly defined stylis tically and chronologically. Broad general stylistic Groups consisting of a large range of motifs produced over extended periods of time frequently included some motifs that could not be classified as ritual as all seven ritual features could not be identified. Such broad general Groups are not discussed in detail in this paper (see Ross, 2003) but should be easier to analyse once we have a clearer understanding of the chronology of the whole corpus of rock art in central Australia. The identification of 3) a specialised time for the performance of ritual in a hunter-gatherer community dependent on unpredictable resources was difficult to establish and relied upon the surface and excavated archaeological evidence of eco nomic and social activities undertaken at art complexes in the past. Identification of a specialised time for ritual in other parts of the w7orld where hunter-gatherers depended upon an annual seasonal round may be less problematic. Clear cut spatial patterning in the relationship between rock art and other archaeological evidence in central Australia demonstrated that particular locations were preferred over others for the production of rock art. This association of archaeological evidence enabled us to identify 4) specialised places with relative certainty. At one level, repetition of the invariant motifs is inevitably associated with specialised place because repetition cannot otherwise be identified through rock art. Application of the concept of 5) stylised form or behaviour, although clearly established in some of the rock art Groups, proved challenging with others. Our preference is to include as art 'gestural marks' (cf. Rosenfeld, 1999) frequently found alongside other parts of the central Australian rock art assemblage. Gestural marks comprise random pits, battered edges and abraded rock faces. While not included as one of our three stylistic Groups discussed in this paper, they provide an apt example of the limitations encountered in identifying Rappaport's features. Ensuring that the term 'stylised form' was used consistently eliminated some of the more spontaneously produced gestural marks described in the ethnographic record as an integral part of some ritual activities in central Australian (Ross, 2003, p. 297). In these cases, the application of Rappaport's seven structural features has not provided a means of identifying what ethnography records as ritual behaviour. Evidence for 6) participation in acts and performances such as rubbing motifs with ochre and touching motifs or surfaces associated with rock art (especially Group ii motifs) is unlikely to leave a clear signature in the archaeological record. Such activities have been witnessed in the past at rock art sites in central Australia in association with ritual activities over the last century or so (e.g. Dick Kimber, personal communication). Other interactive performances relating to art panels are also likely to be invisible to viewers today. Identification of 7) a motif form that can hold and transfer a canonical mes sage was straightforward. As rock art, like all art, is a system of symbols where</page><page sequence="32">336 Ross and Davidson 'symbols are related to their referents arbitrarily but by convention' (Davidson, 1999, p. 122), all motifs can potentially hold and communicate a canonical mes sage. Finally, taphonomic processes associated with all rock art assemblages espe cially those with considerable antiquity may camouflage some structural features associated with ritual. It therefore seems probable that the structural criteria ap plied to rock art will underestimate the assemblages produced in a ritual context. There are a number of strengths in this method of investigating the rela tionship between ritual practices and the production of rock art. Both ritual and rock art are seen as practices involving communication. If ritual is a method of communicating information, it is logical that the practice will involve motifs or objects that can communicate such information. Rock art therefore provides an ideal database from which to investigate ritual behaviour in the past. In recog nising that there will be differences between the contents of individual rituals, the method we have proposed seeks to identify those aspects of the ritual that are universal. In doing so, the focus of the analysis is placed on the relationships rather than the individual content of each rock art assemblage so that the method can be equally applied to varying assemblages without concern for meanings of particular motifs. This is especially relevant to the analysis of prehistoric rock art assemblages as their meanings cannot be recovered. Finally, the method is broad enough to facilitate the identification of two different types of ritual behaviour, one relating to ritual sanctioned by the supernatural and the other relating to more mundane or self-referential ritual.
