<plain_text><page sequence="1">Drawing as Reasoning: Stephan von Huene's Getty Talk Astrit Schmidt-Burkharat In April 1991 the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities issued an invita tion to a lecture (fig. 1). The invitation took the form of a flier with single words and short blocks of text arranged rhythmically between two Greek crosses, which can also be read as plus signs. The headline in Dada-ish, sloping, scattered text starts with "OFF Center." This is followed by three typographically isolated words: "Scandal!"—"Urgent!"—"Rem edy! " But what is it that needs to be remedied? The real scandal, as the flier suggests to us, is the undercover activity of Stephan von Huene, who has been a fellow at the Getty Cen ter since February. It turns out that the artist, in the guise of a genuine scholar, has been disturbing the peace in the research idyll on Wilshire Boulevard in Santa Monica. So the public is exhorted to call the interloper to account at his lecture, in the hope that things may return to normal again. And so it was, that on 22 April Huene stepped up to the lec tern with a sheaf of drawings (fig. 2).1 The Intro sheet immediately and pointedly informs the audience that Huene is not frank and honest: "split / tongue / lies!" (fig. 3). However, this high-spirited, rhetorical opening is not just a playful linguistic maneuver, of the kind favored by Marcel Duchamp; the real intention is to undermine standard academic logic and to foster insight through paradox. Two slide projectors begin to hum.2 Huene Introduces Huene Ever since John Cage's legendary Lecture on Nothing (1949), the lecture perfor mance has developed into a tradition in American intellectual life.3 The point of Huene's artistic camouflage was to establish a position for himself from which he could present his acoustic-kinetic sound sculptures and installations. Highly complex in both their conception and construction, they had occupied him from 1964 to 1990: Kaleidophonic Dog (see fig. 5; 1964-66), Tap Dancer (1966-68), Washboard Band (1967-68), Rosebud Annunciator (1967-69), Totem Tone I-V (1969-70), Text Tones (1977-80), Die Zauber flote (1985), Erweiterter Schwitters (1987-88), and Lexichaos (1990). His role as an artist scientist allowed him to pursue a two-track strategy. When there were aesthetic issues to deal with, he could retreat to the position of the artist.4 At the same time, with his high-tech ambitions and active interest in linguistics and communications science, in psychology and acoustics, he could lay claim to a rigor that went far beyond what a painter or sculpture would normally be expected to achieve.

It was not his style to read from a polished manuscript. Instead he presented and discussed a dozen diagrams, each of which was the outcome of preparatory studies in graphic form. These schematic drawings are fascinating as much for their scientific appeal as for their persuasive visual rhetoric. The puzzle of the enigmatic appearance of these diagrams is easier to solve if we take into account not only the type of work that went into them but also the type of thinking that was behind them. In fact the real background to these thought-sketches is the idea of the mind map. Use Your Head The mind map is a special memory system in mnemonics, presented by Tony Buzan in the form of popular science in his book Use Your Head (ist ed., 1974; rev. ed., 1982) and backed up with the latest findings in the cognitive sciences and research on the human brain.5 Research in cognitive science has shown that the left half of the brain is dominated by linear arithmetic, that is to say, rational processes, while the right half is given over to spatial-pictorial and emotional processes. Although special skills can be developed through training, the real possibility of top-level intellectual achievement depends on both halves of the brain acting together in a synthesis of verbal and visual thinking. And this is precisely where Buzan steps in with his mind map and its combina tion of text and image.6 Buzan sets out a specific order for the construction of a mind map (fig. 4): First, there is the iconic center that characterizes the memory diagram and pictures the main theme. Second, starting from this leitmotif, different fields are explored via elemen tary chains of concepts, and keywords are grouped systematically. To assist the process of memorization, Buzan advises the user to write in block capitals. Third, every word is underlined, and the lines are linked to one another. Fourth, the main theme, which already occupies the center of the map, may also be made visually more memorable by the use of color. Arrows, symbols, geometric figures, and so on all help to heighten the visual impact of the diagram.7 If these instructions are followed, the ensuing mind map—as a hub of ideas—can be used to create a detailed representation of any subject matter. Within its spatial topol ogy, semantic chains of keywords can lead out in different directions. This expandable, linear articulation of ideas is based on an arboreal system. Buzan talks of trees, main branches, and ramifications.8 The vertical stages that the tree establishes as it progresses from below to above are recoded in the mind map as a hierarchy leading from the center to the periphery. The keywords lead step-by-step from the general to the particular. In this way it is possible to put into perspective the unfolding logic from important to sec ondary within the mind map. 120 GETTY RESEARCH JOURNAL, NO. 3 (201l)</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 4. Mind map of memory. From Tony Buzan, Use Your Head, rev. ed. (London: Ariel, 1982), 99. © Tony Buzan 1982. All rights reserved www.thinkbuzan.com Getty Talk Having first experimented with Buzan's method in 1989, in the following year Huene started to use mind maps as his main medium of intellectual reflection: first at his eponymous presentation of Lexichaos, then at the "Interface Symposium," and finally in Getty Talk. On 7 December 1990 he sketched a concept for his work during his three month stay in Los Angeles. An important feature of this was the idea of extending a two dimensional mind map into the third dimension. As Huene told his Californian gallerist, Peter Goulds: "I plan not only to do research but to build some new works in relation to the research I do. At this point I cannot tell you much about the nature of the works I want to do except that I am working on some kind of an extension of Tony Buzan's ideas (small 3 dimensional models) about Mind Mapping." Although at this point Huene had only a vague notion of the artifacts that were to materialize from his research, he already had definite plans for them: "Despite my vagueness I was wondering if you may be interested to collaborate with me and show these works at the end of my stay?"9 Goulds did not take up this suggestion, and Huene did not pursue the idea of making models. At the Getty Center Huene set to work on a series of mind maps, in two dimen sions only, that would serve as an outline for his upcoming talk, scheduled for an hour (see figs. 3,6-8). Getty Talk, as he titled this series of thirteen sheets, marked a turn ing point in his diagrammatic work. As far as the form of these diagrams is concerned, Schmidt-Burkhardt Drawing as Reasoning 121</page><page sequence="6">Huene abandoned the horizontally oriented mind map that Buzan had developed for the topography of recollection because it could be extended on both sides. In Getty Talk the classic landscape format is rotated by 90 degrees. This rotation to a vertical orientation cannot solely be put down to his use of writing paper for this representation of his argu ments—like Joseph Beuys and Martin Kippenberger. It seems rather that the "portrait" format of the Getty Center's writing paper was exactly what he needed as a symbolic frame for his presentation, with one diagram for each work. In terms of the structure of the diagrams, Huene adheres to the practice of mind mapping. The iconic center of each of the Getty Talk sheets is an image of a three dimensional sound sculpture, with cross-hatched shading.10 Around these central emblems are networks of words — fan-shaped, stepped, twigged, or in a cluster. The writing is unembellished, typographically neutral. The straight lines, which Buzan used for underlining keywords, have become curves or arcs, which in turn give these diagram matic drawings a dynamic feel that was more in keeping with Huene's emphatic delivery. In the speech and text bubbles, which are often done in thick, colored felt pens, we find the what and the how of the work. At the same time, the ever-expanding concept trees create multiple connections that, not least, bespeak Huene's intellectual curiosity. The centrifugal force of the keywords generates thematic interpolations that not only reflect back on the work from various different directions but also help bind it together as a single, complex artifact. With the aura of these singular works mutating into semantics, a context arises in which the diversity of the interconnections comes to light. Added to which, Huene is not above adorning significant phenomena with narrative motifs. This visualization was also an end in itself. The variety of directions in the writing and the expansive linear structures give these diagrams an ornamental appearance. As aesthetically designed thought-sketches with a clear leaning toward optical equilibrium, Huene's mind maps were also always intended as autonomous drawings. And the title page and introduction look very much as though Getty Talk was intended for publica tion in due course (see figs. 2,3). Huene numbered the individual sheets; the header and footer already existed on the Getty Center writing paper. Even if Huene's diagrams meet certain artistic aspirations, they nevertheless seem somewhat schematic. At the same time, in their extreme brevity these drawings make such an impact that it is tempting to read them as a first and last statement. Due not least to their semantic density, these small-format sheets require concentrated scrutiny. I shall demonstrate this with refer ence to one work in particular. Kaleiaophonic Dog Huene's Getty Talk followed a chronological sequence and started with a com prehensive presentation of his first work in the genre of sound sculptures. Three mind maps are devoted to Kaleidophonic Dog (fig. 5). The emphasis that Huene thus placed on this work compared to the other eight, each of which is reduced to just one diagram, had to do with that early experience; moreover, Kaleidophonic Dog had been owned by the 122 GETTY RESEARCH JOURNAL, NO. 3 (201l)</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 5.

Hamburg, Estate of Stephan von Huene. © Petra von Huene, Hamburg Los Angeles County Museum of Art since 1973.11 Like all mind maps, the first sheet on Kaleidophonic Dog reads clockwise (fig. 6). The first segment, in the position of one to two o'clock, is a description of the object, outlined in red. The historical background to the piece takes up over a quarter of the diagram; two blue lines separate this section (three to seven o'clock) from the other thematic segments. In this second segment, Huene refers to automats from the sixteenth century onward and to futuristic sound art, as in Luigi Russolo's Intonarumori (1913), and rounds off this brief prehistory of sound sculpture with a contemporary reference to "mechanical music" (Theodor W. Adorno).12 124 GETTY RESEARCH JOURNAL, NO. 3 (201l)</page><page sequence="9">Huene's own life story is also very relevant to the making of Kaleidophonic Dog. As the son of German immigrants living in Los Angeles, he became acutely aware of the deep abyss between outside and inside—between the language of society ("English") and the language of his own family ("German"). This, in turn, led to his own innately divided linguistic disposition toward "split language," which he had already referred to with the symbolic, split tongue in his Intro mind map (see fig. 3). However, the "auditory dimen sion" allowed language, free of semantics, to operate as pure sound—the most important artistic leitmotif for Huene. Looking back, three main driving forces can be identified in his sculptural work: first, the inherent sound of mechanical music that can be regarded as a productive process; second, the kinesthetic quality of music; and, third, the connection between language and music, with music, as a kind of "meta language," occupying a more elevated position than the spoken word (nine to twelve o'clock).13 At the time some of Huene's more critical fellow artists felt his kinetic sound sculp ture was somehow "out of control," not least because the dog is lying on its back. This impression was entirely in keeping with the work, considering that Kaleidophonic Dog— as Huene explained on sheet 2—was conceived as an artistic counterpart to Pavlov's dog (fig. 7).14 In his famous experiments, the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov had investigated the responses of domestic animals to conditioned and unconditioned stimuli and was able to prove that reflexes could be conditioned by both visual and aural signals. In 1904 he was awarded a Nobel Prize for this work. Huene presented a sketch of his own recalling this experiment that was conducted according to a rigorous, methodical procedure. A dog sali vates as Pavlov gives it a piece of meat; at the same time a bell sounds. The scientist shows that the acoustic signal alone is enough to cause the dog's saliva to flow; this appears as a second step on Huene's diagram. Pavlov's dog became the classic symbol of conditioning, which—as a measurable and hence objectifiable response—led to the founding of a whole new branch of psychology, namely behaviorism.15 Against the backdrop of a neutral, scientific phenomenology, Kaleidophonic Dog is in no sense a mere artistic guinea pig. In fact, this work is about another reality, far removed from both civilized society and wild nature, and raises the question as to the conditions under which a dog really would be able to talk (ten o'clock). Huene then proceeds to further develop this fantastic imaginary experiment in his mind map, and in doing so justified the implicit ambiguousness of the upside-down position of the dog with reference to findings achieved by means of "automatic writing," namely that affirmation and negation were inextricably connected. "Yes"—or "sey," if you read it backward—already contains its own negation. And, along the same lines as this ana grammatic reversal, the dog lying on its back means that Kaleidophonic Dog is also always standing on all fours. However, it is the next sheet that seeks to answer the central question as to what internal mechanisms are controlling this canine creation (fig. 8). The technical center of this wooden, kinetic sculpture is built into the pedestal. And here there are a number of perforated strips that control the dog's movements and its kaleidophonia.

Additional mechanisms subsequently generate movement and sound. The pattern of perforations can be read as a form of notation. Every punched hole rep resents either a motoric or acoustic signal. While the perforations along the vertical axis 126 GETTY RESEARCH JOURNAL, NO. 3 (201l)</page><page sequence="11">401 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 400 Santa Monica, California 90401-1455 Telephone 213458-9811 Fig. 8.

Hamburg, Estate of Stephan von Huene. © Petra von Huene, Hamburg mark a specific movement and the activation of a musical instrument, the perforations along the horizontal axis mark the synchronized interplay of gestures and sounds. Three arrows indicate the direction of Huene's thinking. The invention of a per forated tape system that could be used to produce sounds, which became known as the "player-piano system," blessed the nineteenth century with the automatic piano (five o'clock).17 Like Kaleidophonic Dog much later on, the player piano was driven pneumati cally by a pressure equalizing system. In connection with the history of the technology, Schmidt-Burkhardt Drawing as Reasoning 127</page><page sequence="12">Huene even goes one step further back, by including a cam disk along with the tried and-tested perforated tape system, and adds the word "cambs" (sic).18 This reference to cams calls to mind the world of artistic automata that flourished in the eighteenth century, such as the anthropomorphic mechanisms like "writing dolls," whose graceful movements would never lead the observer to suspect the highly complicated mecha nisms controlling them (three to four o'clock). With a reference at the left-hand edge of the sheet to programmable electronic memory chips, so-called EPROMs, Huene also points to the latest developments in digital technology that were finding their way into computer hardware. The cam, with its irregular outline, stands for analog technology; by contrast, the EPROMs rely solely on digital signals. In the line meandering around the words "eraseable prog, memories," we see the graph-based symbol for the binary code for on and off signals. This line points the way forward, insofar as the time would come when Huene took his early, cam-driven, kinetic sculptures and retooled them by replacing somewhat accident-prone mechanisms with more stable computer programs. In the lecture itself, Huene made no mention of the connection between him self and Adorno that exists on paper at least. Adorno had talked of the fetishization of recorded music.19 Through the recording of all kinds of sounds that can be listened to as often as one likes, a "new approach to music" had been opened up. However, Huene's "fetish"—selected from all the new technological possibilities and the consequent theoretical prospects—was the EPROM. Using a dedicated reset channel, EPROMs made it possible to continuously play a number of perforated tapes of different lengths. Unlike the long-playing record, which in Adorno's view had been "submitted to the pitiless eternity of the clockwork," acoustic loops lead to the desired by-product of the "cyclical phasing" of individual compositional elements. In the long term, EPROMs cre ated chance effects. This, in turn, meant that from now onward aleatoric sound was all but preprogrammed. Retroactive Conceptualization For Huene, drawing was intrinsic to his customary process of artistic reflection. Working with pencil and paper was his way of thinking.20 Thus his adoption of Buzan's mapping methods as a form of applied art was an entirely consistent step; it allowed him to give his thought processes a directional structure as a visually perceptible form and to take control of these by committing them to paper. This resulted in a logical conjunction of display and abstraction, partly in the expectation that this would help to clarify his conceptual preparatory work both for himself and for others. However, the art historical spectrum that informed Huene's rapid sequence of diagrams was wider than a first impression might suggest. A glance at a whole range of modernist phenomena—Bauhaus, Beuys, Maciunas, and so on—shows how scientific imaging and modes of representation can migrate into art, extend it, and change its meta phors.21 The case of Duchamp demonstrated very early on that when extra-artistic forms of representation are adopted, account also has to be taken of any possible ironic refrac 128 GETTY RESEARCH JOURNAL, NO. 3 (201l)</page><page sequence="13">tion. Getty Talk is also part of this parascientific tradition, but only to a certain extent, because Huene was striving for an extended form of artistic drawing that he hoped would ensue from his adaptation of quasiscientific diagrams. Placing remarkable trust in the epistemic, productive power of the diagram, Huene outlined his concept of drawing in a grant application he submitted in 1994 to the Rockefeller Foundation in Bellagio, Italy: I am thinking of a different type of drawing, a kind of drawing that helps me on the one hand understand what I am doing, in the process of doing it, and on the other hand a generative drawing that helps me produce ideas. The multi levels and varied materials I work with to produce (sound, obj ect, vision, word) make it almost imperative that I work directly, empirically, when I construct my sculptures. I am working on the development of a drawing form that assists me in understanding what I am doing, to assist me in understanding the decisions I am making, which in turn will help me generate new ideas. I have been study ing the drawings developed by The Physicist Richard Feynman to assist him in understanding Quantum Mechanics, the diagram type of drawing developed by Tony Buzan to assist in memory and learning where words, pictures and signs are used together, the Renaissance drawings of mechanical devices by Leonardo and Francesco di Giorgio and the diagrams of the sociologist Parsons where cross configurations were formed with the name of two variables at the end of each arm of the cross. Then between these variables ideas were generated, some where between graphic representation and word. I will then bring this together with my training in Drawing. To make ideas clear, to make ideas solid, to make ideas in depth, and to make ideas colorful.22 Although Huene was not awarded a Rockefeller grant—despite, or perhaps pre cisely because of, his advanced concept of "generative drawing"—with his pronounced leaning toward structural clarity, he was by now an expert in the matter of the diagram matic representation of knowledge. And his references are by no means restricted to Feynman, Buzan, da Vinci, Francesco di Giorgio, and Parsons. Among Huene's materials there are over seventy different types of diagrams concerning color systems alone. In addition to this, he collected figurative illustrations by the mystic alchemist Robert Fludd and tree diagrams. Another source of information on logical diagrams and the genealogi cal method was the mathematician—not the author—Lewis Carroll.23 Huene's interest in creating a structural overview prompted him, at his Getty Talk, to retrospectively establish the ontological basis of his work and to reinforce the genuine implications of his aesthetic production by analyzing the works themselves. In doing so, he concentrated not on the inspired idea but rather on illustrating the conditions that led to the making of the sound sculptures and installations—as though reflecting on his own art objects. Mediating his art in this manner and creating meaning through explanation also served to legitimize his work. Yet Huene was not driven by a desire to present the Schmidt-Burkhardt Drawing as Reasoning 129</page><page sequence="14">ultimate interpretation. In fact, this recontextualization of his work could perhaps best be described as retroactive conceptualization. As a memorable design for an aesthetic project, Getty Talk takes the form of a diagrammatic panorama of an artist's oeuvre in which he creates a hierarchical arrangement of its most important arguments in order of significance. And here Huene relied on his skills of induction, deduction, and associa tion. His presentation was inductive in that he identified the roots of his works in various different spheres of knowledge. It was deductive in that he inferred the circumstances of its making. And it was associative in that he picked out a series of key points from the wide range of topics that were to preoccupy him all his life. And, in the process, his own concept of art emerged all the more clearly. For all his fascination with Buzan's diagrams and methods, Huene was well aware that mapping inevitably simplifies things.24 The philosophical anthropologist Gregory Bateson had clearly identified the limits of "mapping onto."25 Nevertheless, Huene continued to favor this method; after all, his interest was in developing a drawing form that would allow him, during the process of drawing, to rethink artistic decisions and to generate new ideas. The mind map perfectly met this need. Thus it seems fair to describe Huene's adaptation of the mind map for artistic purposes as a "conceptually resonant chart," to borrow the words of the American critic, writer, and artist Richard Kostelanetz in his groundbreaking anthology of alternative forms of representation published in 1975.26 The phrase "conceptually resonant charts" here refers to rationally laid out territories for thinking and reading, to diagrammatic representation that can be used to engage in reflection. In this very specific sense, Huene's mind maps can also be regarded as diagrams with conceptual resonance. The intended use of these diagrams is bound up with their function. In the con text of Huene's lectures, these mind maps served as a written "means of articulation" (Hans Blumenberg). The semiotics of the shape of the text use a shorthand that serves to provide a mnemonic overview. The diagrams are sketches for the lecture, mapping out the speech act that becomes a performance once it is underway. Huene's diagrammatic drawings as the modus operandi of an iconic-graphic rationale can be decoded as linear, logical, or narrative sequences.27 As an ensemble, they yield concepts but not a continu ous text—rather a semantic spectrum that represents the various facets of a life's work. Huene's interest lay in developing a chain of consequent reasoning. And as the concepts interrelate, they form a complex, overarching structure. The mind maps open up topo logical thought-fields, which, in turn, reveal explicatory patterns. As the narrative mode of the visual aids and the pictoriality of the theory converge, they make a twofold appeal to our powers of imagination. As a recording process, the mind map lends knowledge a constant presence; as a medium of reflection, it encourages critical thinking; as retroac tive conceptualization, it holds insights in readiness for the next discourse. 130 GETTY RESEARCH JOURNAL, NO. 3 (201l)</page><page sequence="15">Astrit Schmidt-Burkhardt is a lecturer at Freie Universitat Berlin.

Bateson, Mind and Nature, 50 (footnote): All description, explanation, or representation is necessarily in some sense a mapping of deriva tives from the phenomena to be described onto some surface or matrix or system of coordi nates. In the case of an actual map, the receiving matrix is commonly a flat sheet of paper of finite extent, and difficulties occur when that which is to be mapped is too big or, for example, spherical.... Every receiving matrix... will have its formal characteristics which will in principle be distortive of the phenomena to be mapped onto it. In Huene's heavily annotated copy, there is a cross marking this footnote. 26.
