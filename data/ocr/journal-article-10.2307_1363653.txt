It is seldom that a book combines notable pictures, scientific accuracy, and literary style, yet Horst Siewert's "St6rche"' has this distinction. A number of his studies have already appeared in the Journal fiir Ornithologie, chiefly on the great birds of prey; he now gives us a book on the. home life of the two storks. The tale of the rare, shy Black Stork that lives in deep forests has a special appeal. From day-long vigils in a blind in a tree top the author learned that the female did most of the incubating, the. male taking her place for some hours each morning. When the young were three weeks old, the parents relieved each other in two and a half to four hour shifts, bringing, however, a total of only five meals, two in the early morning and three late in the day. With the White Stork the female incubated all night, but during the day the birds changed places at intervals ranging from one to four and a half hours, the male assuming the larger share of the task. There is not a trace of nature faking nor of anthropomorphism here; on the contrary, instead of glossing over the fact that the Black Storks let one of their babies die of cold and hunger on the rim of the nest, the author uses the incident as an occasion to discuss bird mentality. In connection with the White Storks he brings up the vexed question whether bird language is uttered with the, intention of communication, or is always an expression of emotion. The scientific value of the book is atfested by the fact that 16 pages of the observations on Ciconia nigra are reprinted in the last Journal fiir Orni- thologie. Too often the object of nature photog- raphy appears to be chiefly entertainment; here on the contrary every one of the 80 pictures is significant of some phase in behavior, for Horst Siewert's purpose was primarily that of understanding the life of his subjects. In "Der Vogel Schnarch", Gerd Hein- rich' tells of the adventures of himself, his wife and sister-in-law in the high mountains and terrible swamps of Celebes, a two years' expedition which resulted in a rich array of new forms of both birds and mammals for the American Museum of Natural History and the Zoologisches Museum and Zoo of Berlin. With vivid description of the primeval forests and strange birds and beasts, and occasional flashes of humor, the author recounts dif- ficulties and rewards, discouragements and triumphs and the final capture of the two rare rails, Habroptila wallacei and Arami- dopsis plateni,--"der Vogel Schnarch." The undaunted courage of all three par- ticipants, and their dogged determination to achieve the allotted task, give an ex- ample of devotion in the service of science which may well serve as inspiration to the rest of us. These books, despite their low price, are masterpieces, each in its own phase of bird study.-MARGARET M. NICE. 1 1932. Berlin: Dietrich Reimer; 208 pp., 80 pJs. 4.80 RM. :1932.
