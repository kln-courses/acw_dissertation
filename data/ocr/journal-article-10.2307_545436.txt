INTRODUCTION A stylized tree with obvious religious significance already occurs as an art motif in fourth-millennium Mesopotamia, and, by the second millennium B.C., it is found everywhere within the orbit of the ancient Near Eastern oikumene, including Egypt, Greece, and the Indus civilization.' The meaning of the motif is not clear,2 but its over- all composition strikingly recalls the Tree of Life of later Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist art.3 The question of whether the concept of the Tree of Life actually ex- isted in ancient Mesopotamia has been debated, however,4 and thus many scholars today prefer the more neutral term "sacred tree" when referring to the Mesopotamian Tree.5 * The substance of this paper was presented at the XXXIX Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale in Heidelberg, 8 July 1992. The present version has benefited from oral comments received later from T. Abusch, Farouk al-Rawi, J. C. Greenfield, W. G. Lambert, J. Reade, M. Weinfeld, and D. Weisberg; the responsibility for all the interpretations and errors remains, however, entirely mine. I apologize for the massive footnote apparatus, which was unavoidable in order to provide the necessary documentation and background information; those who find it disturbing are advised to skip the notes and to read the text first.

York, "Heiliger Baum," in RIA, vol. 4, pp. 269-80, with the bibliogra- phy of earlier studies, ibid., pp. 280 ff.; see also C. Kepinski, L'Arbre stylise en Asie occidentale au 2e millinaire avant J.-C. (Paris, 1982). The Harappan forms of the Tree, attested in pottery, glyptic, and script since 2400 B.C., display Proto-Elamite and Akkadian influence. The earliest Egyptian examples date from the sixteenth century and reveal an affinity with contemporary Babylonian forms (see Kepinski, L'Arbre stylisd, vol. 3, nos. 924-36); they appear to represent an import from the Levant connected with the Hyksos invasion and Egypt's expansion under Tuthmosis I, as also indicated by the Osiris myth explicitly associating the Tree with the city of Byblos. The earliest Greek examples (ibid., nos. 891-94), from the fifteenth century, are even more pronouncedly Babylonian. 2 See n. 26 below. 3 For examples, see Roger Cook, The Tree of Life: Image for the Cosmos (London, 1978), passim (for example, pl. 46, The Great Cross of the Lateran, early Christian, with confronted animals; pl. 49, Christ on the Tree of Life, by Pacino da Bonaguido, early fourteenth century; pl. 47, Tree of Life with confronted centaurs, Saracen Mosaic at Palermo, twelfth century; pl. 52, Menorah as Tree of Life, He- brew Bible, Perpignan, 1299; pl. 19, Tree of Life and Knowledge flanked by two bulls, India, Vigayanagar period, 1336-1546).

Its formal development through the Middle Assyrian period can be traced from dated seal impressions and datable seals; see the studies of Moortgat and Beran in ZA 47 (1941), 48 (1944), and 52 (1957). The earliest exam- ples which can be dated with certainty are a seal im- pression in a text (KAJ 144) dated in the eponymy of Tukulti-Ninurta (1243 B.c.; for the impression, see ZA 47, p. 77), two ivories from this king's palace at Assur (Kepinski, L'Arbre stylise, vol. 3, nos. 414 f.), and the wall paintings of Kar Tukulti-Ninurta (ibid., nos. 448 f.; see W. Andrae, Farbige Keramik aus Assur [Berlin, 1923], pls. 2 f.). An uninscribed seal of unknown provenance (Collection de Clercq, 342bis) containing a precursor of the Assyrian Tree is usually dated to the late fourteenth century on sty- listic grounds (see Beran, ZA 52, p. 160, fig. 31); note also the seal impression in KAJ 247 (ibid., fig. 30, from a fourteenth-century archive). 7 See, for example, Danthine, Palmier-dattier, figs. 373 (Cyprus), 472 (Byblos), 487 (Nerab near Aleppo), 499 (Susa), 802 (Gezer), 927 (Naukratis), 930 (Egypt); F.

Flandin, Monument de Ninive (Paris, 1849-50), vol. 1, pl. 80, and vol. 2, pls. 116, 119, 139, and 144. 14 The pre-Assyrian Tree already was a complex motif subject to considerable detail variation in its component elements; by mixing the traditional ele- ments with Assyrian innovations, one could, in prin- ciple, produce an unlimited number of tree variants. Nevertheless, considering the predominantly sche- matic nature of most Neo-Assyrian representations, the extent of attested variation is surprising. As ob- served by Reade, Iraq 27 (1965): 126 f., "so far as can be ascertained, no two full-size trees [in the pal- ace of Ashurnasirpal II] were identical"; the same applies to the hundreds of examples on seals, disre- garding obviously mass-produced items. Thus it does seem that there was a conscious effort to make every representation of the Tree look different. See also n. 63 below.</page><page sequence="4">164 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES its characteristic features" stand out even in the crudest examples and make it generally easy to distinguish it from its predecessors. Essentially,16 it consists of a trunk17 with a palmette crown'" standing on the stone base'9 and surrounded by a network of horizontal or intersecting lines20 fringed with palmettes, pinecones, or pomegranates (fig. 1).21 In more elaborate renditions, the trunk regularly has joints or nodes at its top, middle, and base22 and a corresponding number of small circles to the right and left of the trunk (fig. 2).23 Antithetically posed animal, human, or supernatural figures usually flank the 15 Apart from the surrounding network already re- ferred to in n. 6 (see further n. 20 below), these in- clude the winged disk hovering above the Tree (see n. 25) and significant changes in the inventory of the flanking figures (n. 24) and in the iconography of the winged disk and the trunk (n. 22). The systematic in- troduction of these features is clearly not a matter of style but, rather, indicates a profound change in the symbolism of the Tree (see also n. 66 below). 16 In view of the great number of variants, it is impossible to give a universally valid, compact de- scription of the Tree; the one given here is an ab- straction combining the most typical features of the Neo-Assyrian representations of the Tree. 17 In elaborate renderings, the trunk is occasion- ally divided by vertical striae into three parallel col- umns. This tripartite trunk may correspond to the three-stemmed tree of some representations (see Ap- pendix A). 18 Occasionally the palmette crown can take the form of a flower, a disk, or a wheel; see Appendix A, and cf. fig. 6 with n. 63 on the significance of these variants. 19 The base is usually represented as a mountain, rock, or stone block. It can also be omitted alto- gether, but its place is then taken by the lowermost joint of the trunk. On the symbolic meaning of the base (material world, netherworld), see pp. 180, 187 with n. 98, 192-93, and 198 below. 20 The number, direction, patterning, and rendi- tion of the lines can vary considerably. In the reliefs of Ashurnasirpal II, they resemble streams of water, while in the reliefs of Sargon II and contemporary seals they resemble interlacing cords in a net; else- where, they recall rungs in a ladder (see n. 98). In each case, they effectively reduce the tree to an inte- gral part of a larger whole. On the symbolism of the line network, see n. 55 below. 21 Hitherto commonly taken as fertility symbols (cf. RIA, vol. 3, p. 626), but as Farouk al-Rawi in- forms me (oral communication), in Iraq pinecones and pomegranates are traditionally symbols of unity. In Christian symbolism, the pomegranate represents "multiplicity in unity as the Church, with the seeds as its many members" and, secondarily, "regenera- tion and resurrection" (J. Baldock, The Elements of Christian Symbolism [London, 1990], p. 108); see also A. de Vries, Dictionary of Symbols and Imagery (Amsterdam, 1974), p. 371 ("unity in multiplicity; concord; fertility-growth and resurrection"). The fringe would thus have served to stress the underly- ing unity of the design enclosed by it. It may, how- ever, have had other connotations as well. This is suggested by the fact that the position of the cones and pomegranates in the fringe could be taken by palmettes, a universal symbol of regeneration, self- renewal, and victory over death (see Baldock, Ele- ments, p. 105, and de Vries, Dictionary, pp. 356 f.). Note that both pomegranate and pinecone carry simi- lar symbolic meanings; see above and, for the latter, de Vries, Dictionary, p. 367, s.v. pine ("immortality, lon evity; victory"). 2 The standard number of nodes is three per trunk. They are usually depicted as three superim- posed horizontal bands holding together the three- columned trunk (see n. 17 above); they could be reduced to mere lines, and, in some variants, the en- tire trunk could consist of three superimposed nodes only. In trees with an elaborate crown and base the top and bottom nodes could be omitted as superflu- ous, while the middle node was more consistently retained. For the four-noded trunk occurring as a variant of the standard three-noded trunk in the re- liefs of Ashurnasirpal II, see n. 52 and pp. 188-89 below; note that trees flanked by the king never have four nodes and that the extra node may lack the cus- tomary volutes (see, for example, Paley, King of the World, p. 96, fig. 12b, second node from top). 23 In the sculptures of Ashurnasirpal II, these cir- cles are embedded in the loops of the volutes emerg- ing from the nodes and thus are clearly associated with the latter in a triadic arrangement. There are normally two circles per node, one on each side of the tree (see J. Stearns, Reliefs from the Palace of Ashurnasirpal II, AfO Beiheft 15 [Graz, 1961], pls. 40, 69, 70, 73, 78, 81, and 84 [three nodes, six cir- cles]; pls. 11, 17, 18, 26, 31, 34, 75, and 80 [four nodes, eight circles]). In some representations, addi- tional volute pairs appear in the empty spaces be- tween the nodes (ibid., pls. 7, 9, 13, 28, 33, 57, 59, and 65, and see also fig. 2). These additional ele- ments must not be confused with the volutes emerg- ing from the nodes; note the different vertical alignment of their loops in Stearns, Reliefs, pls. 13 and 59. On the meaning of the circles and volutes, see n. 25 below.</page><page sequence="5">THE ASSYRIAN TREE OF LIFE 165 tree,24 while a winged disk hovers over the whole.25 Even the most schematic represen- tations are executed with meticulous attention to overall symmetry and axial balance. II. THE TREE: ITS SYMBOLISM AND CONCEPTUAL STRUCTURE THE BASIC SYMBOLISM OF THE TREE What did this Tree stand for, and why was it chosen as an imperial symbol? There is considerable literature on this question, but despite the most painstaking analyses of the iconographic evidence, on the whole, little has been explained.26 This is largely due to the almost total lack of relevant textual evidence. The symbolism of the Tree is not dis- cussed in cuneiform sources, and the few references to sacred trees or plants in Meso- potamian literature have proved too vague or obscure to be productive.27 24 The flanking animals consist of goats, ibexes, gazelles, and stags, all associated with sexual po- tency and animal instincts, but also with regeneration (the ibex specifically with Ea, the god of Wisdom and Life). While extremely common in earlier peri- ods, they are rare in Late Assyrian representations, where their place is largely taken by various kinds of protective genies and/or the king, the latter often por- trayed in a mirror image on both sides of the Tree (on private seals, the royal figure could be replaced by that of the private individual). The genies, mostly depicted in the act of sprinkling the king and/or the Tree with holy water, largely consist of mythi- cal sages (apkallu) serving the god Ea (see F. A. M. Wiggermann, Mesopotamian Protective Spirits [Groningen, 1992], especially pp. 65 ff.). Neither the mirror-imaged king nor the mythical sages are at- tested as flanking figures before the emergence of the Lake Assyrian Tree, so they certainly represent gen- uine Assyrian innovations. 25 The association of disk and tree already occurs in Mitannian art, but the Assyrian representations differ significantly from their Mitannian counterparts both regarding the position of the disk and its ico- nography; see W. G. Lambert, "Trees, Snakes and Gods in Ancient Syria and Anatolia," BSOAS 48 (1985): 438 f. Iconographical innovations not found in the Mitannian disk include streamers hanging from the disk, often extended to enclose the tree; a feathered tail; a god riding in the disk; and a volute on its top, resembling those emerging from the nodes of the trunk (see Appendix B pp. 201-2 be- low). The streamers may terminate in forked light- ning bolts, circles, or palmettes. The god in the disk regularly raises his right hand in benediction and may hold a bow in his left hand; in some representa- tions, he is accompanied by two smaller gods riding on the wings of the disk. As pointed out by G. Con- tenau, "Note d'iconographie religieuse assyrienne," RA 37 (1940-41): 160, the blessing gesture recalls the symbolic representation of God the Father in early Christian iconography; see also de Vries, Dic- tionary, p. 235; Baldock, Elements p. 98; and n. 93 below. It should be noted that the triad of gods and the volute on top of the disk are in complementary dis- tribution: whenever the former appears, the latter is lacking. Hence the volute with its loops seems to be an icon for the gods accompanying the central figure. On some seals, the place of the accompany- ing gods is taken by two juxtaposed circles; on oth- ers, the whole trinity, including the central god, is replaced by three juxtaposed circles (see Appendix B, pp. 201-2 below). This strongly suggests that the triadic arrangements of circles, volutes, and nodes on the trunk (see n. 23 above) also stand for trinities of gods. 6Revealingly, apodictic statements about the meaning of the Tree are carefully avoided in recent studies, though there appears to be a general consen- sus among experts that it was related to fertility. Cf. Reade, Assyrian Sculpture, p. 27: "Its exact meaning escapes us, but it could be taken as representing in some way the fertility of the earth, more especially the land of Ashur"; similarly York, RIA, vol. 4, p. 279; Paley, King of the World, pp. 234 f.; H. W. F. Saggs, The Might That Was Assyria (Lon- don, 1984), pp. 234 f.; Lambert, "Trees, Snakes and Gods," p. 438. Steams (Reliefs, p. 71) suggests that "the meaning of the tree was as changed as its form and that its precise intent.. . had become, like other mystic symbols of all ages, obscured under the accu- mulation of religious experience." M. Roaf, Cultural Atlas of Mesopotamia (Oxford, 1990), p. 226, tersely states "the significance of the motif is not clear." Kepinski's voluminous study of second-millennium iconography of the Tree, L'Arbre stylise, does not deal with the meaning of the motif. 27 A case in point is G. Widengren's important study The King and the Tree of Life in Ancient Near Eastern Religion (Uppsala, 1951).

After Meuszyriski, Rekonstruktion, pl. 6</page><page sequence="7">THE ASSYRIAN TREE OF LIFE 167 Two fundamentally important points have nevertheless been established concerning the function of the Tree in the throneroom of Ashurnasirpal's palace in Calah. Firstly, Irene Winter has convincingly demonstrated that the famous relief showing the king flanking the Tree under the winged disk (Slab B-23, fig. 3) corresponds to the epithet "vice-regent of ASSur" in the accompanying inscription.28 Clearly, the Tree here repre- sents the divine world order29 maintained by the king as the representative of the god AS'ur, embodied in the winged disk hovering above the Tree.30 Secondly, it was observed some time ago that in some reliefs the king takes the place of the Tree between the winged genies (fig. 4).31 Whatever the precise implications of this fact, it is evident that in such scenes the king is portrayed as the human personifica- tion of the Tree.32 Thus if the Tree symbolized the divine world order, then the king because part of the textual evidence he quotes is not pertinent and none of it demonstrably pertains to a "Tree of Life." See, however, n. 128 below. 28 Winter, "Program" (n. 13, pp. 26 ff.). As pointed out by M. T. Larsen, The Old Assyrian City State and Its Colonies (Copenhagen, 1976), p. 119, "vice-regent (is's'akku) of A''ur" was a traditional epithet specifically referring to the king as "interme- diary between the god and the community." On the spelling of the epithet with the SANGA sign, see M.-J. Seux, "Remarques sur le titre royal assyrien i''akki AS'ur," RA 59 (1965): 103-4. 29 Cf. me-gal-gal an-ki-a = usurdt game u erseti (GI.HUR.ME9 AN-e U KI-tim), lit. "the designs (Sum. "the great offices") of heaven and earth," ACh Sin 1: 2 and 6, and Tablet V of Enfima elis, where the words usurdtu, "designs," and parsi., "offices," refer to the organization of the divine and the material world by Marduk (lines 1-5 and 65-67); note also the mystical work I.NAM GI.HUR AN.KI.A (see nn. 66, 87, 89, and 100 below) explaining the "designs" of the world by gematric techniques (see n. 66 below). 30 Winter, "Program," pp. 16 f. In discussing the composition of Slab B-23 and its crucial position be- hind the royal throne, Winter makes a telling compar- ison to the Gothic tympanum: "Compositionally, the organizing principles are clear: axial symmetry gov- erns the placement of the tree at the center; the repe- tition of figures on either side maintains the axial and absolute balance. The priority of figures moves into the center and then up: from the "genii" at the far sides, to the king in his role as maintainer, to the cen- tral tree, and then to the god in the winged disk, set precisely on the axis. It is no different from the orga- nization apparent on the faqade of a Gothic cathedral, for example, as a key to the theological structure of medieval Christianity (italics mine): basal quatre- foils, as at Amiens, containing earthly and didactic themes; apostles flanking the central door, as the aspiration of men; the figure of Christ on the trumeau at the middle of the central portal as the highest achievement of man; then, directly above all, the scene of the Last Judgment on the tympanum, leading ultimately to an elevating visual as well as religious experience. The theological priorities are as clear there, then, as one may suggest them to be on slab 23 of Assurnasirpal." The overwhelming "sacramental" aspect of the throneroom reliefs is also stressed by Sa Vs, The Might That Was Assyria, p. 234. York, RIA, vol. 4, p. 278, referring to J. Eng- nell, Studies in Divine Kingship in the Ancient Near East (Uppsala, 1943), pp. 26 f.; A. Moortgat, Tam- muz (Berlin, 1949); and Widengren, The King and the Tree of Life, pp. 43 ff. Conversely, it could be ar- gued that the Tree takes the place of the king in the scenes where it is being purified by the apkallu ge- nies. The apkallus were the mythical equivalent of court scholars (ummanu), whose primary function was to protect the king and attend to his moral integ- rity, i.e., "purify" his soul. See my remarks in LAS, vol. 2, pp. xx f., xxiv f., 40 ff., and 335, and, in more detail, my article "Mesopotamian Astrology and As- tronomy as Domains of the Mesopotamian 'Wis- dom'," in H. Galter and B. Scholz, eds., Die Rolle der Astronomie in den Kulturen Mesopotamiens: Bei- triige zum 3. Grazer Morgenlaindischen Symposium 23.-27.9.1991 (Graz, 1993). 32 The king is portrayed as a flourishing tree offer- ing shelter to his subjects in a Neo-Assyrian letter written by a prominent court scholar (LAS 122:14; for many other examples of the verb gamahu refer- ring to the growth of trees, see CAD, s.v., pp. 289 ff.). As pointed out in LAS, vol. 2, p. 108, this pas- sage resembles Daniel 4, where the tree allegory is explicitly related to the moral conduct of the king: In the Book of Daniel (ch. 4), King Nebuchadnezzar dreams of a great tree "in the midst of the earth" around which all the "beasts of the field" [see n. 24 above] and "birds of heaven" congregate. Then he sees "a watcher and an holy one" come down from heaven crying: "Hew down the tree, cut off his branches, shake off his leaves and scatter his fruit... and let his portions be with the grass in the earth. Let his heart be changed from a man's and let a beast's heart be given unto him." Daniel interpreted this tree as represent- ing the King himself who, in modemrn psychological terms, had identified his limited and personal self with the divine Selfhood which his kingship symbolized. (Cook, Tree of Life, p. 109; note the illustration from the Bible of Rodan [sixth century] reproduced ibid., closely resembling the Assyrian Tree). For</page><page sequence="8">168 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES himself represented the realization of that order in man, in other words, a true image of God,33 the Perfect Man.34 If this reasoning is correct, it follows that the Tree had a dual function in Assyrian imperial art. Basically, it symbolized the divine world order maintained by the Assyrian king, but inversely it could also be projected upon the king to portray him as the Perfect Man. This interpretation accounts for the prominence of the Tree as an imperial sym- bol35 because it not only provided a legitimation for Assyria's rule over the world,36 but it also justified the king's position as the absolute ruler of the empire.37 The complete lack of references to such an important symbol in contemporary written sources can only mean that the doctrines relating to the Tree were never committed to writing by the scholarly elite who forged the imperial ideology but were circulated orally.38 The nature of the matter further implies that only the basic symbolism of the further references to the King as Tree in Mesopota- mian sources, see Widengren, The King and the Tree of Life, pp. 42 ff.; cf. also pp. 195 ff. below. Note also the famous anthropomorphic tree from Assur (A. Parrot, Nineveh and Babylon [London, 1961], fig. 9). 33 References to the king as the image (salmu) of God abound in the Neo-Assyrian royal correspon- dence; see, for example, "the father of the king my lord was the very image of Bel, and the king my lord is likewise the very image of Bel," LAS 125:18 f.; "You, O king of the world, are an image of Marduk," RMA 170 = SAA 8 no. 333 r. 2. Note especially LAS 145: "The king, my lord, is the chosen of the great gods; the shadow of the king, my lord, is beneficial to all . . . The king, my lord, is the perfect likeness of the god." For the king as the image of ?amal, see LAS 143:17 ff. and the passages cited in the relevant commentary (LAS, vol. 2, p. 130). The concept is first attested in the Tukulti-Ninurta Epic (AfO 18, p. 50, late second millennium B.C.). 34 "Perfect Man" (eflu gitmalu is well attested as an Assyrian royal epithet; see Seux, Epithetes royales akkadiens et sumeriens (Paris, 1967), p. 92 and also p. 231 (qarratdu gitmalu, "perfect hero"); note SAA 3 no. 25 ii 16 (sarru gitmalu, "perfect king"), and cf. LAS 144 r. 4 f.: "What the king said is as perfect as the word of god," and ABL 1221 r. 12: "The word of the king is as [perfect] as that of the gods." The concept of "perfect king" goes back to the early sec- ond millennium (the time of Hammurabi); see Seux, Epithetes, pp. 97 and 331; see also n. 138 below. 35 The need of visual symbols to epitomize com- plex ideologies is too obvious for elaboration here; cf. the role of the cross as a symbol of Christianity or that of the sickle and hammer as the symbol of com- munism. A stylized rendition of the Tree of Life, the Menorah, was the symbol of Judaism in the first cen- tury A.D. and still functions (on, for example, the ros- trum of the Knesset) as a state symbol in modern Israel. On the Menorah, see L. Yarden, The Tree of Light: A Study of the Menorah, the Seven-branched Lampstead (Uppsala, 1972). 36 Verbal justification of this claim is a regular feature of Assyrian royal inscriptions since the early thirteenth century B.C. See, for example, RIM 1, p. 233 ("Tukulti-Ninurta, king of the universe... whose name ASSur and the great gods faithfully called, the one to whom they gave the four quarters to administer and the one to whom they entrusted their dominion"); for further examples, see CAD, s.v. b~li~tu, p. 203. 37 Note that piety and blameless moral conduct are the most prominent qualities justifying the king's rule in Assyrian royal inscriptions; see Seux, Epi- thetes, pp. 20 f. Cf., for example, the continuation of the inscription cited in the preceding footnote ("Tukulti-Ninurta ... the attentive one, appointee of the gods, the one who gladdens the heart of Aslur, the one whose conduct is pleasing to the gods of heaven and earth"). 38 That is to say, primarily the chief scribe (also called "the king's scholar") and his "department." On this important state official, see O. Schroeder, "um- manu = Chef der Staatskanzlei?," OLZ, 1920, pp. 204-7; H. Tadmor in F. M. Fales, ed., Assyrian Royal Inscriptions: New Horizons (Rome, 1981), pp. 30 ff.; see also my article "The Forlorn Scholar," in F. Rochberg-Halton, ed., Language, Literature, and History: Studies Presented to Erica Reiner (New Haven, 1987), p. 257; S. J. Lieberman, "A Meso- potamian Background for the So-called Aggadic 'Measures' of Biblical Hermeneutics," HUCA 58 (1987): 212 ff., and idem, in T. Abusch et al., eds., Lingering Over Words: Studies in Honor of W. L. Moran (Atlanta, 1990), pp. 313 ff. While the duties of the chief scribe are not specified in Assyrian sources, it is extremely likely that they included the drafting and production of royal inscriptions; note the colophon of the Sargon's letter to A''ur (TCL 3), in- dicating that it was composed by the chief scribe himself, and see the note on LAS 7 r. 10 in LAS, vol. 2, p. 11. On the other hand, there is evidence that other prominent scholars too were involved in the composition of royal inscriptions and, more gener- ally, in the formulation of the imperial policies; see</page><page sequence="9">THE ASSYRIAN TREE OF LIFE 169 Tree was common knowledge, while the more sophisticated details of its interpretation were accessible to a few select initiates only. The existence of an extensive esoteric lore in first- and second-millennium Mesopotamia is amply documented,39 and the few ex- tant written specimens of such lore40 prove that mystical exegesis of religious symbol- ism played a prominent part in it.41 THE SEFIROTIC TREE Mesopotamian esoteric lore has a remarkable parallel in Jewish Kabbalah,42 and, more importantly from the standpoint of the present topic, so does the Assyrian Tree.

Beaulieu, "New Light on Secret Knowledge in Late Babylonian Culture," ZA 82 (1992): 98-111; see also n. 66 below. Elman (p. 22) compares the Mesopotamian scholarly oral tradition (s'a p ummdni) to the Jewish Oral Law (Torah ge-be- al-peh); Tigay ("Early Technique," p. 171, n. 4); and, earlier, Lambert ("An Address of Marduk to the Demons," AfO 17 [1954-56]: 311) draw a parallel between Mesopotamian commentaries and the Mid- rashim; thus also, in more detail, A. Cavigneaux, "Aux sources du Midrash: L'Hermeneutique babylo- nienne," Aula Orientalis 5 (1987): 243-55. On the transmission of esoteric lore (from teacher to disciple or from father to son), see Lieberman, "A Mesopota- mian Background," p. 217, and A. R. George, "Baby- lonian Texts from the Folios of Sydney Smith, pt. 2" RA 85 (1991): 139; in this context, note remarks in the scholarly correspondence such as "I have learned it from my father" (LAS 370 r. 23, see LAS, vol. 2, p. 373) or "I have heard it from the mouth of my father" (RMA 218 = SAA 8 no. 454 r. 6). The evidence discussed in the above articles could be multiplied by including all the references to secret lore in second- and first-millennium texts (see CAD and AHw. s.vv. katimtu, nisirtu, piristu, and ikkibu). For the first millennium, note, above all, Assurban- ipal's famous self-description of his education: "I learnt the craft of the sage Adapa, the esoteric secrets of the entire scribal tradition; I observed celestial and terrestrial signs and discussed them in the meetings of scholars; I ponder with expert diviners the liver, the image of heaven . . " (Streck, Asb., p. 252 i 13 ff.). For the second millennium, note Gilg. XI 9 and 266: "I will disclose to you, Gilgames, things that are hid- den, and I will relate to you the secrets of the gods." 40 See the list in RIA, vol. 3, pp. 189 ff. (with ad- ditions in HKL 3, p. 119, and ZA 82, p. 110) and A. Livingstone, Mystical and Mythological Explanatory Works of Assyrian and Babylonian Scholars (Oxford, 1986). The esoteric nature of these texts is made ex- plicit by their colophons, for example, "Secret lore of the great gods/heaven and earth/sages/scholars; an initiate may show it to another initiate, the uniniti- ated may not see it; taboo of the great gods"; see also n. 42 below. Additional glimpses into the lore are provided by a multitude of random passages in schol- arly texts, primarily commentaries and letters. 41 See, for example, Livingstone, Mystical Works, pp. 116 ff. (= SAA 3, nos. 37-39), and the commentary on Sakikku I recently edited by George in "Babylo- nian Texts," pp. 146-63. Calling the kind of herme- neutics exemplified by these texts "mystical" is justified inasmuch as extracting "hidden" meanings from the literal wording of religious texts appears to have been its primary goal. The hermeneutic methods used in this process were virtually identical with those used in rabbinical exegesis, including mashal, "alle- gory"; remez, "paronomasia"; naad, "homonymy"; and, above all, gematria and notarikon, on which, see n. 66 below. It may not be merely a coincidence that the rules of Talmudic hermeneutics were laid down by Rabbi Hillel, a first-century (ca. A.D. 30) immigrant from Babylonia. 42 See again, provisionally, my article "Mesopota- mian Astrology and Astronomy." The strictly eso- teric nature of Kabbalah and the fact that its secret doctrines were for centuries, and still are, transmitted almost exclusively orally are the principal reasons why next to nothing was known about it until the late Middle Ages (see below). The esotericism of Kab- balah and its fundamentally oral nature are stressed in every Kabbalistic work, ancient and modern. See M. Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives (New Haven, 1988), p. 109; see also ibid., p. 21:</page><page sequence="10">170 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES PILLAR OF EOUILIBRIUM I KETER PILLAR OF JUDGMENT Crown PILLAR OF MERCY 3 2 BINAH g HOKHMA Understanding Wisdom DAAT SKnowledge % 5 4 DIN HESED Judgment Mercy 6 TIFERET Beauty 8 7 HOD NEZAH Glory Victory 9 YESOD Foundation 10 MA LKHUT Kingdom FIG. 5.-The Sefirotic Tree</page><page sequence="11">THE ASSYRIAN TREE OF LIFE 171 schematic design known as the Sefirotic Tree of Life43 figures prominently in both prac- tical and theoretical Kabbalah.44 In fact, it can be said that the entire doctrinal structure of Kabbalah revolves around this diagram (fig. 5),45 a form which strikingly resembles the Assyrian Tree.46 The Sefirotic Tree derives its name from elements called Sefirot, literally "countings" or "numbers,'"47 represented in the diagram by circles numbered from one to ten.48 They are defined as divine powers or attributes49 through which the transcendent God, not This Kabbalistic technique has passed unnoticed by mod- ern scholarship .... This situation is not a matter of mere chance but rather a result of the technique's highly esoteric nature .... Underneath the diagram we read: "All these al- lusions must be transmitted orally" . . . Even more impres- sive are the statements of the anonymous author of the Kabbalistic responsum: "Know that this is a Kabbalistic tra- dition which was handed down to you, and we are writing it down, [but] it is forbidden to disclose it or to pass it down to everyone, but [only] to 'those who fear the divine name and take heed of his name', blessed be he, 'who tremble at his name'." Compare this with the Mesopotamian colophons cited in n. 40, and note that the Kabbalistic lore is often referred to as hokhmah ntstarah (or hokhmah ha-nistar), "the Hidden Wisdom," recalling various designations of the Mesopotamian esoteric lore (see n. 39 above and CAD, s.v. nimequ, "wisdom"). 43 Also known as the Tree of Knowledge, with ex- plicit reference to Gen. 2:9 and 3:3-5; see C. Ponc6, Kabbalah (San Francisco, 1973), pp. 145 ff., and see nn. 54 and 124 below. 44 Kabbalistic thought is traditionally divided into two branches, practical and speculative (see Scho- lem, "Kabbalah," Encyclopaedia Judaica, vol. 10, pp. 632 ff.). The former, rooted in post-exilic Merka- bah mysticism (speculation on the throne-chariot of God, Ezek. 1) and represented by such Kabbalists as Abraham Abulafia and Isaac Luria, has strong links with ecstatic prophecy; the latter, rooted in Bereshit mysticism (speculation on the creation, Gen. 1-3), is predominantly theosophical in character. This bipar- tite division of Kabbalah (see also n. 51 below) has a parallel in the ecstatic prophecy and scholarly mysti- cism of first-millennium Assyria; see my Assyrian Prophecies, SAA 9 (Helsinki, 1993), introduction. 5 Cf. Z. Halevi, Kabbalah: Tradition of Hidden Knowledge (London, 1979), p. 50: "The first step in Kabbalah is to become familiar with the Sefirotic Tree. Without this key, little can be comprehended"; idem, The Way of Kabbalah (Bath, 1991), pp. 88 f.: "The Tree of Life is a diagrammatic scheme of the Sefirot or Divine Principles that govern Manifest Ex- istence. It contains, and this is constantly repeated till learned, the concept of Unity and Duality, the idea of creative trinity, the Four Worlds, and the un- folding of the octave Lightning Flash between One and All, and back again .... In short, it is a key to comprehending the laws of the World .... In the Tradition it is called the Key of Solomon, and not without reason." On the function of the diagram as a mandala in Kabbalistic meditation, see ibid., pp. 90 and 112, and Ponc6, Kabbalah, p. 142. 46 Cf. fig. 2. The Sefirotic Tree, like the Assyrian one, is attested in several variant forms reflecting the various symbolic meanings of the diagram (see fig. 6 with n. 63); the diagram reproduced here represents the most common form of the Tree in current Kab- balistic literature and is attested in this form since the seventeenth century. 47 The normal meaning of the word in rabbinical Hebrew is "counting" (see Jastrow, Dictionary, p. 1014a, s.v. sefirah), but in Sefer Yezirah and the writings of Abraham Abulafia it clearly has the tech- nical meaning "(primordial/ideal) number"; see G. Scholem, Origins of the Kabbalah (Princeton, 1987), pp. 26 f., and Idel, Kabbalah, p. 349, n. 323, refer- ring to a passage in Abulafia's Mafteah ha-Sefirot, where the source of the Sefirot, En Sof, is called "the One who Counts" (sofer). In Kabbalistic speculation, the Sefirot are also commonly associated, through homophony, with the words sappir, "sapphire," and sferah, "sphere" (cf. Scholem, Origins, p. 81). These associations are consonant with ideas about the na- ture of the Sefirot but have nothing to do with ety- mology or the original meaning of the word. 48 The numbers correspond to the order of ema- nation (cf. n. 55) of the Sefirot from the En Sof; in Kabbalistic literature, they are referred to by ordinal numbers and associated with the first ten letters of the Hebrew alphabet. See Ponc6, Kabbalah, pp. 108 ff., and cf. the Abulafia passage referred to in n. 47 above: "The influx expanding from the one who counts is comprised in and passes through a[leph] to y[od], from the first Sefirot to the tenth" (Idel, Kabbalah, p. 148). 49 See Halevi, Kabbalah, pp. 5 f.; Scholem, Ori- gins, p. 82; and Idel, Kabbalah, pp. 113 f. As noted by Scholem, an enumeration of ten divine attributes closely resembling the Kabbalistic one already oc- curs in a Talmudic passage from ca. 230, attributed to the Babylonian scholar Rav (BT Hagigah 12a): "By ten things [lit. 'words'] was the world created: by wisdom (hokhmah), by understanding (tevunah), by reason (daat), by strength (kah), by rebuke (gaarah), by might (gevurah), by righteousness (zedek), by judgment (mishpat), by compassion (hesed), and by loving kindness (rahamim)." Idel (Kabbalah, pp. 113 f.) adduces further passages in</page><page sequence="12">172 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES shown in the diagram,50 manifests Himself. Each has a name associated with its num- ber.51 The Tree has a central trunk and horizontal branches spreading to the right and left on which the Sefirot are arranged in the symmetrical fashion: three to the left, four on the trunk,52 and three to the right. The vertical alignments of the Sefirot on the right and left represent the polar opposites of masculine and feminine, positive and negative, active and passive, dark and light, etc.53 The balance of the Tree is maintained by the trunk, also called the Pillar of Equilibrium.54 Like the Assyrian Tree, the Sefirotic Tree has a dual function. On the one hand, it is a picture of the macrocosm. It gives an account of the creation of the world, accompa- nied in three successive stages by the Sefirot emanating from the transcendent God.55 It also charts the cosmic harmony of the universe upheld by the Sefirot under the con- early Jewish and Gnostic sources, referring to ten creative logoi in the context of Creation. 50 In some Sefirotic diagrams, En Sof is repre- sented by a circle hovering over the Tree (see, for example, Ponce, Kabbalah, pp. 92, 101, and 102), re- calling the winged disk hovering over the Assyrian Tree (see n. 25 above) as well as the image of the glorified Christ shown above the Tree of Life in Christian art (see Cook, Tree of Life, pls. 43, 46, and 49). Cf. pp. 184 ff. below, and nn. 93 f. 51 The origin of these names, some of which have alternatives, is obscure; cf. Abulafia's remarks in his Imrey Shefer (ca. 1270), cited in Idel, Kabbalah, p. 202: [The theosophists] claim that they received from the proph- ets and the sages that there are ten Sefirot ... and they desig- nated each and every Sefirah by names, some of them being homonyms, others proper names. And when they were asked [to explain them], those who know them were unable to say what these Sefirot are, and to what entity these names re- fer ... and their names are well known from their books, but they are very perplexed concerning them. See further pp. 176 f. and nn. 70-73 below. 52 A fifth "invisible" Sefirah, Daat (Knowledge or Reason), is sometimes inserted in the middle column between Keter and Tiferet. This "non-Sefirah" repre- sents an interval or void separating the first three Sefirot ("the Supernals" or "the Upper Face") from the following six ("the Lower Face"). See n. 22 above on Assyrian Tree variants with four nodes in- stead of the standard three, and see nn. 104, 110, and 124 below. Note that Daat is included in Rav's list of ten creative "words" (see n. 49), while the Sefirah of Malkhut (not forming part of the Lower Face) is lacking from it, and cf. n. 85. 53 The right-hand alignment of the Sefirot is com- monly referred to as the Pillar of Mercy and that on the left as the Pillar of Judgment or Severity. These two "pillars" (also known as Male and Female Col- umns, or the Good and Evil Sides) are conceived as manifestations of two hidden divine principles con- straining the flow of emanation, the active, expansive one of Mercy and the passive, restrictive one of Jus- tice (or Rigor). See Halevi, Kabbalah, pp. 5 f., and also Ponce, Kabbalah, p. 142 ff.: In this configuration.., .the Sefiroth contained within each pillar or unit are connected only to the others contained within the same pillar. The theme of polarity, the distinction of the opposites as male/female, positive/negative and dark/ light is here emphasized. 54 Halevi, Kabbalah, p. 7; cf. Ponce, Kabbalah, pp. 144 and 148: The Zohar refers to this middle pillar as the perfect pillar. It serves as a mediating factor between the pillars of the right and the left .... There is also some Kabbalistic specula- tion . . . that the center pillar is the Tree of Life, and the re- maining pillars the Tree of Good and Evil .... When man ate of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil he did not draw any sustenance from the Tree of Life, which mediates between the opposites. See further Scholem, "Kabbalah," p. 575. In this con- text, note that some Assyrian seals combine two trees in the same scene, viz., one with the characteristic garland network and one generally consisting of trunk and crown only (see, for example, Danthine, Palmier- dattier, nos. 371, 379, 424, 479, 509, and 521; note es- pecially no. 479 with an empty garland arch beside a palm tree ridden by a monkey and an eagle, and no. 509 showing a phoenix rising from a burning(?) tree beside a tree with a nine-petalled fruit crown). 55 The creation of the world is envisaged as a threefold process taking place in the Divine Mind be- fore the materialization of the physical world. It in- volves the expression of the idea by the Divine Will, its elaboration by the Divine Intellect, and its actual implementation by the Divine Emotion. The first phase is referred to as the World of Emanation and associated with the first Sefirah, Keter; the next two are referred to as the Worlds of Formation and Cre- ation respectively and associated with the "Upper" and "Lower Faces" (see n. 52 above). In an alterna- tive scheme, the Sefirot are distributed in the differ- ent worlds in a triadic arrangement, the first three in the World of Emanation, 4 to 6 in the World of For- mation, and 7 to 9 in the World of Creation, while the last, Malkhut, is located in the material world, "the World of Making" (Ponc6, Kabbalah, pp. 67 f.; cf. Halevi, Way of Kabbalah, pp. 27 ff.). Compare this with the three-layered triadic structure of the As- syrian Tree discussed in n. 22 above. The emanation of the Sefirot is conceived of as a</page><page sequence="13">THE ASSYRIAN TREE OF LIFE 173 straining influence of the polar system of opposites. In short, it is a model of the divine world order, and in manifesting the invisible God through His attributes, it is also, in a way, an image of God.56 On the other hand, the Sefirotic Tree, like the Assyrian, can also refer to man as a mi- crocosm, the ideal man created in the image of God. Interpreted in this way, it becomes a way of salvation for the mystic seeking deliverance from the bonds of flesh through the soul's union with God.57 The arrangement of the Sefirot from the bottom to the top of the diagram marks the path which he has to follow in order to attain the ultimate goal, the crown of heaven represented by the Sefirah number one, Keter. Tradition has it that the doctrines about the Tree were originally revealed to the patri- arch Abraham, who transmitted them orally to his son.58 In actual fact, the earliest sur- viving Kabbalistic manuscripts date from the tenth century A.D.59 It is generally agreed, lightning flash issuing from the ocean of "Endless Light," En Sof Or (see n. 94 below); the energy drawn from this source filters through the Sefirot, who emanate it further throughout the world. The unity of the En Sof and the Sefirot is fundamental to Kabbalah. "The En-Sof and its emanations are insep- arable .... What flows through the Sefiroth is the light of the En-Sof which they need for their exist- ence" (Ponc6, Kabbalah, pp. 101 and 130). The flow between the individual Sefirot and the En Sof has been likened to streams of water poured into colored bottles (ibd., p. 103), a zigzagging lightning flash re- turning to its origin, and the flow of an electric cur- rent through a system of functions in a circuit (Halevi, Tree of Life, p. 32). Compare this with the streamlike lattice network (see n. 20 above) and the pomegranate or cone garland surrounding the Assyr- ian Tree (n. 21), and note the lightning streamers emanating from the winged disk above the Tree dis- cussed in n. 25 above; note also the Assyrian Tree scenes with water-receiving or water-emitting bot- tles. See, for example, H. Frankfort, Cylinder Seals (London, 1939), fig. 65; Danthine, Palmier-dattier, figs. 588 and 843 f. (with a human figure replacing the tree; see also n. 56 below). 56 See Idel, Kabbalah, pp. 136 ff. The Book of Bahir (twelfth century) refers to the Tree as an image of God by the term ha-males, "fullness," a direct equivalent of Gnostic pleroma, "(divine) fullness"; on this concept, also referred to as "the All" (to pan, to holon), see Scholem, Origins, pp. 68 ff., quoting the Gospel of Thomas, where Jesus says of himself: "I am the All and the All proceeds from me"; cf. Paul's Letter to the Colossians, 1:15-19. In the openly anthropomorphic theosophy of ecstatic Kab- balah and Merkavah mysticism, the Sefirot are asso- ciated with the cosmic body of Adam Kadmon, the archetypal or perfect man, or God himself; see Ponc6, Kabbalah, pp. 134 ff.; Scholem, Origins, pp. 20 ff.; J. Dan, Three Types of Ancient Jewish Mysticism (Cincinnati, 1984), pp. 12 ff. An early Assyrian (thirteenth century B.C.) precur- sor of the idea of the Sefirot as the Divine pleroma occurs in a prayer of Tukulti-Ninurta I, where the sungod is invoked as "the radiance" and the storm- god as "the voice" of the god A''ur (KAR 128 r. 12 f.). The idea of the cosmic anthropos is attested in KAR 102, a Neo-Assyrian hymn to Ninurta, where the various parts of this god's body are systemati- cally identified with specific deities of the Mesopota- mian pantheon. 57 See also P. Epstein, Kabbalah: The Way of the Jewish Mystic (Garden City, New York, 1978), pp. 4 and 15 f.: "The cosmic tree of life conveniently epitomized the emana- tions of God's "qualities" into the visible world of men. And since imitating God eventually led a man to direct knowl- edge of God, the Kabbalist exerted himself to perfect each quality on the tree . . . Since he believes that man is liter- ally created in the image of God, the mystic works to polish himself until he becomes so brilliantly clear that he reflects nothing but god. "Union with the absolute" in this case is a matter of "like attracting like." Cf. also Idel, Kabbalah, pp. 57, citing Rabbi Vital's Sha'ar ha-Mizvot: "When studying Torah man must intend to link his soul and to unite her and make her cleave to her source above.., .and he must intend thereby to perfect the supernal tree [of Sefirot] and the holy anthropos." On unio mystica in Jewish mysticism, described with the metaphor of the drop of water and the sea, see ibid., pp. 59-73. Idel stresses (p. 67) that the aim of the mystic was to achieve the state of union without being totally absorbed and lost in the divine abyss. On the practical goals of the mystical union (encounter with souls of the dead and acquisition of supernal se- crets from ancient pious men), see ibid., pp. 91 ff. 58 See Ponce, Kabbalah, p. 39 (referring to Sefer Yezirah and a Talmudic legend); Scholem, Die jiidische Mystik in ihren Hauptstromungen (Frank- furt, 1957), p. 74; and Halevi, Tree of Life, pp. 17 f. (naming Melchizedek as the revealer of the doctrines about the Tree). Whatever these traditions are worth, if taken seriously, they imply that Jewish Kabbalah (lit., "tradition") was based on a previous model and, in view of Abraham's prominent association with "Ur of the Chaldees" (Gen. 11:28-31), strongly point to Mesopotamia as the place of origin of that model. 59 See Scholem, "Yezirah," Encyclopaedia Juda- ica, vol. 16, p. 786 (commentary on Sefer Yezirah</page><page sequence="14">174 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES however, that the "foundation stone" of Kabbalism, the Sefer Yezirah, was composed sometime between the third and sixth centuries,60 and the emergence of Kabbalah as a doctrinal structure can now be reliably traced to the first century A.D.61 The renowned rabbinical schools of Babylonia were the major centers from which the Kabbalistic doc- trines spread to Europe during the high Middle Ages.62 Altogether, the Sefirotic Tree displays a remarkable similarity to the Assyrian Tree in both its symbolic content and external appearance (see fig. 6).63 In addition, given the fact that it seems to have originated on Babylonian soil, the likelihood that it is based on a Mesopotamian model appears considerable.64 As a matter of fact, a number of central from the Cairo Genizah, dated 955-56; the earliest extant manuscript of the book itself is from the elev- enth(?) century; see ibid., p. 782). 60 Scholem, "Yezirah," pp. 785 f. Cf. idem, Ori- gins, p. 25: the various estimates of the date of its composi- tion ... fluctuate between the second and the sixth centuries. This slender work is also designated in the oldest manu- scripts as a collection of "halakhoth on the Creation" and it is not at all impossible that it is referred to by this name in the Talmud (BT Sanhedrin 65b, fourth century), and Dan, Three Types of Ancient Jewish Mysticism, p. 21 (ca. fourth century). 61 The connections of Kabbalah with Jewish apoc- alyptic esotericism and mysticism of the post-exilic period have never been questioned, and its affinities with Platonism, Gnosticism, Neoplatonism, and Sufism were noted long ago and stressed by many scholars; the crucial question of the evolution of Kab- balistic doctrines, specifically their dependance on external influence(s), however, has remained a matter of controversy. While Kabbalists themselves have consistently stressed the antiquity of their tradition and vehemently denied the existence of any kind of historical development in Kabbalah (see Scholem, "Kabbalah," p. 493; Halevi, Way of Kabbalah, pp. 16 ff.), modern scholarship has tended to see the emergence of historical Kabbalah as a gradual pro- cess heavily influenced by Neoplatonic and especially Gnostic thought. Recent research has significantly altered this pic- ture, however. It is now generally recognized that there is considerable Jewish influence on the emerg- ing Gnostic literature, not the other way around; and that several doctrinal features of Kabbalah previously attributed to Gnosticism in fact belong to a genuine Jewish tradition reaching, through Hekhalot and Mer- kavah mysticism, down to the first century A.D., if not earlier; see Idel, Kabbalah, pp. 30 ff. for details. For an unmistakable reference to the Tree of Life diagram in Hekhalot Rabbati (third century A.D.?), see Dan, The Revelation of the Secret of the World: The Begin- ning of Jewish Mysticism in Late Antiquity, Brown University Program in Judaic Studies, Occasional Papers, no. 2 (Providence, 1992), pp. 30 f. 62 The literature of practical Kabbalah was intro- duced to Italy in 870 by a Babylonian scholar, Aaron ben Samuel (alias Abu Aharon); see Scholem, Jiid- ische Mystik, p. 44; see idem, "Kabbalah," p. 510; cf. Ponc6, Kabbalah, p. 60. Several leading gaonic scholars (for example, Saadiah, Sherira b. Hanina, and Hai) are known to have occupied themselves with Sefer Yezirah in the following century; see Scholem, "Kabbalah," pp. 511 f. 63 The multiplicity of attested Tree variants is re- lated to the Kabbalistic view of the Sefirotic pleroma as a dynamic, constantly changing living organism, which could be contemplated upon but not properly captured in words or writing; this idea is expressed with metaphors such as light reflected by moving water (Idel, Kabbalah, p. 140), the movement of the planets and stars (ibid., p. 248), or flames emerging from a burning coal (ibid., p. 137). The different variants illustrate the dynamics of the Tree by stress- ing different aspects of its interpretation, such as the various interrelationships of the Sefirot (cf. Halevi, Way of Kabbalah, p. 142). 64As uncontestable examples of Jewish cultural borrowings from Mesopotamia during and after the exile, note the Jewish calendar still based on the Neo-Babylonian intercalation system (R. Parker and W. Dubberstein, Babylonian Chronology 626 B.C.- A.D. 75 [Providence, 1956]); the incantation bowls of Babylonian rabbis (J. Montgomery, Aramaic In- cantation Texts from Nippur [Philadelphia, 1914]); the medical passages in the Babylonian Talmud dis- cussed by M. Geller in his review of P. Herrero, La Therapeutique misopotamienne (Paris, 1984), in BiOr 43 (1986): 738-43; and the astrological omen text recently published by J. C. Greenfield and M. Sokoloff, "Astrological and Related Omen Texts in Jewish Palestinian Aramaic," JNES 48 (1989): 201- 14; the list could easily be made ten times longer. In this connection, it is good to remember that the mys- tic form of Islam, Sufism, emerged in Babylonia im- mediately after the Muslim conquest.</page><page sequence="15">THE ASSYRIAN TREE OF LIFE 175 s ?i i .f i;i% 4 i- u~t ~ .Li?-( I.?..I.??~ ~r~. ??;:~ ?s. i,..?/ r i"' Y ~? ~? -; ????- ~.-? ?i?`- ?.? ; . ~ B ;`;'~rrrFs-r ~Ch- ;ir. ~c,,, ~7 'EIr'? ~L= _^cr~ (C. -r0--~5~3~ C trl PC. ~?-s~ cc? ?r-- .-"r;' .?L~L`~ F i ?-F, ~L; tt-; ~3~ --\z~ ?- ?- ' ~L~;C- tr I; :? \j; ~i:?~, i' r .i -,?

FIG. 6.-Sefirotic and Assyrian Tree variants</page><page sequence="16">176 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Kabbalistic doctrines, such as the location of the Throne of God in the Middle Heaven,65 are explicitly attested in Mesopotamian esoteric texts.66 The crucial question, however, is how the existence of the hypothetical Mesopota- mian model can be proven, given the lack of directly relevant textual evidence. It must be admitted that a priori it is possible that the observed similarities are simply coinci- dental and due to a common cultural heritage rather than to a direct borrowing. THE ASSYRIAN TREE DIAGRAM For the above reasons, I had for years considered the identity of the Assyrian and Sefi- rotic Trees an attractive but probably unprovable hypothesis, until it finally occurred to me that there is a way of proving or rejecting it. For if the Sefirotic Tree really is but an adaptation of a Mesopotamian model, the adaptation process should be reversible, that is, it should be possible to reconstruct the original model without difficulty.67 The basic 65 See KAR 307:31 ff. = Livingstone, SAA 3, p. 100; cf. Ponc6, Kabbalah, pp. 64 ff. The Kabbal- istic association of the throne-chariot of glory with Enoch/Metatron (ibid., p. 66; cf. Idel, Kabbalah, pp. 124 f., and Scholem, Origins, pp. 18 ff.) finds a parallel in the association of Marduk's chariot with the list of antediluvian kings and sages in the Neo- Assyrian canon of religious texts; see, provisionally, Lambert, "A New Fragment from a List of Antedilu- vian Kings and Marduk's Chariot," in M. A. Beek et al., eds., Symbolae Biblicae et Mesopotamicae Francisco Mario Theodoro de Liagre B6hl Dedica- tae (Leiden, 1973), pp. 271-80; for the implications of this association as well as the role of the Chariot in Mesopotamian mystical thought, see Excursus 2, pp. 204-5 below. The Kabbalistic association of heaven with fire (Ponce, Kabbalah, pp. 41 f.) is attested in the above- mentioned (see n. 56) prayer of Tukulti-Ninurta, KAR 128 r. 32 ("fire of Anu"); see also RA 62, p. 54:17. The doctrine associating the creation of the cosmos with the creation of language, the alphabet functioning as the instrument of creation itself (see Ponc6, Kabbalah, pp. 27 and 41; cf. Scholem, "Yezirah," p. 784, and the illustration in D. Mac- lagan, Creation Myths [London, 1977], p. 30) has a counterpart in the Middle Assyrian "Silbenalphabet," KAR 4, where mumbo-jumbo combinations of sylla- bles are associated with the creation story culminat- ing in the creation of man; this text is defined as "secret" in its colophon. Similarly, the creation of the "golem" by the recitation of incantations (Scho- lem, "Yezirah," p. 785) finds an exact parallel in the creation of the primeval man in the Atrahasis myth (see W. G. Lambert and A. R. Millard, Atra-Hasis: The Babylonian Story of the Flood [Oxford, 1969], p. 61). In general, the Kabbalistic notion of the cre- ation process (see n. 55 above) closely resembles the Mesopotamian one, which involved a decision by a deity (Anu or Enlil) and its elaboration and imple- mentation by the God of Wisdom and/or a birth goddess (see Lambert and Millard, Atra-Hasis, pp. 55 ff.; En. el. VI 1-35; Gilg. I ii 33 ff.; note the use of word zikru, "utterance," in the sense of logos, "idea," in the last passage). 66 Note also the prominent role of interpretive techniques such as gematria (use of the numerical value of the letters of a word) and notarikon (taking certain words as abbreviations for complete phrases or letters or syllables as abbreviations for words) in both Kabbalah and Mesopotamian scholarly texts; see Ponc6, Kabbalah, pp. 168 ff. and Lieberman, "A Mesopotamian Background," pp. 157-225; Tigay, "Early Technique," pp. 176-81, adduces numerous examples of the two techniques from the Babylonian Talmud. As noted by Tigay (ibid., pp. 187 f.), the in- troduction of such interpretative techniques generally indicates a growing mismatch between the wording of traditional scripture and the prevailing world view. From this point of view, it seems significant that the emergence of these techniques in Mesopota- mia neatly correlates with the rise of the Assyrian Empire and the appearance of the Assyrian Tree. Note that the esoteric text I.NAM GI9.HUR AN.KI.A (Liv- ingstone, Mystical Works, pp. 22 ff.), using these very techniques, associates different lunar phases with different gods and thus manages to explain all major gods of the pantheon as aspects of the moon god; see further n. 89 below. 67 The case of Christian Kabbalah, represented by outstanding scholars, philosophers, and theologians, such as Pico della Mirandola, Johannes Reuchlin, Egidio da Viterbo, and Jacob Boehme, is instructive. This form of Kabbalah was demonstrably taken over from a pre-existing (Jewish) model with only mini- mal adjustments, such as the translation of the names of the Sefirot, the identification of Adam Kadmon and En Sof with Christ, or the reinterpretation of the three world ages as reigns of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; the essence of the system, including the tree diagram and other central Kabbalistic axi- oms, was not affected at all. This was possible be- cause Christianity is rooted in both Judaism and Classical philosophy; the Christian Kabbalists "be-</page><page sequence="17">THE ASSYRIAN TREE OF LIFE 177 elements of the Tree, the Sefirot, are crucial in this respect. Their names and definitions strongly recall the attributes and symbols of Mesopotamian gods, and their prominent as- sociation with numbers calls to mind the mystic numbers of the Mesopotamian gods. They are, in fact, represented as angelic beings in some Sefirotic schemes, which is con- sistent with their definition as divine powers.68 Accordingly, in the hypothetical Meso- potamian model they would have been gods, with functions and attributes coinciding with those of the Sefirot. Consequently, I replaced the Sefirot with Mesopotamian gods sharing their functions and/or attributes (see fig. 7). Most gods fell into their place immediately and unequivo- cally. Assyriologists will need no justification for associating Ea with Wisdom,69 Sin with Understanding,70 Marduk with Mercy,71 Sama' with Judgment,72 Igtar with Beauty,73 and lieved that they had discovered in the Kabbalah an original divine revelation to mankind ... with the aid of which it was possible not only to understand the teachings of Pythagoras, Plato, and the Orphics . . . but also the secrets of the Catholic faith" (Scholem, Kabbalah, pp. 643 f.). Another conservative factor certainly was that the doctrines of Kabbalah, crystal- lized in the tree diagram, represent a highly inte- grated system of thought which by its very nature works against radical changes in it. 68 See the diagram in Halevi, Kabbalah, p. 74, with Sefirah I appearing as Metatron, 2 as Raziel, 3 as Zaphkiel, 4 as Zadkiel, 5 as Samael, 6 as Michael, 7 as Haniel, 8 as Raphael, and 9 as Gabriel. A Hebrew mag- ical-astrological text from Nisibis entitled "Wisdom of the Chaldeans," published by M. Gaster, Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology 22 (1900): 329 ff., explicitly equates angels with planets: Raphael = Sun, Gabriel = Moon, Samael = Mars, Michael = Mercury, Zadkiel = Jupiter, Anael = Venus, and Qaph- siel = Saturn. Transferring these equations to the dia- gram just mentioned, one obtains a tree stated in terms of planet(ary god)s, to be compared with Halevi, Tree of Life, p. 51 (tree composed of Greco-Roman gods and their planets). On a passage in Bahir merging the Sefi- rot with angelic beings, see Scholem, Origins, p. 148. The Hekhalot texts contain long lists of angels with names ending in el, "to which the title YHWH is added, making them a group of divine beings, a system of pler- omatic powers" (Dan, "Revelation," p. 17); cf. idem, Three Types, p. 17: It should be emphasized that the term "angels" is an inaccu- rate and confusing one in this context .... Medieval defini- tions gave this term the meaning of a created, subordinated messenger of God, which cannot be an independent divine power. In the Hekhalot literature.., .the powers are called by names like 'Akhatriel Yah Adonai Zevaoth,' which cannot be interpreted as other than an appellation of a divine power. According to a legend quoted by Halevi, Kabbalah, p. 13, "the Divine Name EL [was attached] to the functional name of each angelic being, so that it could never exert more of its power than God wished. Thus each celestial being was confined to its task, like the angel Shalgiel who only dealt with snow." One could not hope for a better etiology of Sumerian me/garza and Akkadian parsu, "divine power of function"! 69 Cf. Ea's epithets "sage of the gods/universe, sage/ king of wisdom, lord of wisdom/secrets, wise, surpass- ingly/exceedingly wise, omniscient, knower of inge- nious things"; for references, see H. Galter, Der Gott Ea/Enki in der akkadischen Oberlieferung (Graz, 1983), pp. 34 ff. Wisdom is the theme of one-third of all attested epithets of Ea; a further 25 percent define him as the creator god or the lord of Apsu and the wa- ters of life; the rest are general epithets stressing the greatness of the god. In a commentary recently edited by George (RA 85 [1992]: 152), Ea is referred to as "Great light of Apsu," an allusion consonant with the Kabbalistic notion of Hokhmah as a hidden luminary directly in contact with En Sof, the Endless Light (cf. Halevi, Tree of Life, p. 74, and Ponc6, Kabbalah, pp. 66 and 101). Con- versely, Kether is referred to in the Zohar (see Ponc6, Kabbalah, p. 118) as "The Wisdom-Gushing Foun- tain" flowing into a large vessel in the earth called "Sea," an allusion consonant with the Mesopotamian notion of Apsu (cf. Galter, Enki/Ea, pp. 80 ff.). For the Kabbalistic notion of Hokhma as "the father of all cre- ated things" and the archetype of fatherhood, "father of fathers" (Ponc6, Kabbalah, pp. 119 ff.), cf. Ea's epi- thets "father of the (great) gods" and "creator of every- thing/all mankind/created things" (Galter, pp. 34 f. ). 7oBinah, "Understanding" or "Intelligence," also rendered Prudentia (Robert Fludd, Philosophia Sacra [1626]), is defined as "intellect in its passive, receptive and reflective capacity, deep pondering" (Halevi, Kabbalah, p. 6), "reflective thinking, to back up inspiration" (idem, Tree of Life, p. 38) and "profound intellect act[ing] as a counterbalance to Wisdom" (idem, Way of Kabbalah, p. 55). Compare this with references to the moon god Sin as "Anu of the sky whose counsel nobody perceives" (Perry, Sin, no. 2:9), "whose profound heart no god can fathom" (ibid., no. 1:37), "whose mind no god knows" (ibid., no. 5:5), and note Sin's epithets "wise, knower of secrets, sage of gods" (Tallqvist, G6tter- epitheta, p. 446) and mutadlu, "judicious, thought- ful, circumspect, deliberate," attested in Perry, Sin, no. 5:10, and personal names (CAD, s.v., p. 284).</page><page sequence="18">178 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Nabfi and Ninurta with Victory (Nezah).74 Crown (Keter) was the emblem of both Anu and Enlil,5 but since in the first millennium Enlil was commonly equated with Marduk "Understanding, Intelligence" (Nahi, an exact seman- tic equivalent of Binah), is explicitly attested as a name of the moon god in Thamudic inscriptions; see D. Nielsen, "Uber die nordarabischen G6tter," Mit- teilungen der Vorderasiatisch-Aegyptischen Gesell- schaft 21 (1917): 254 f. In Rav's list of ten creative powers (see n. 49 above), Binah is represented by its synonym Tevunah. Another frequent epithet, "maker of decision(s)," refers to Sin as the Supreme Divine Arbiter; see Tallqvist, G6tterepitheta, p. 447. This role agrees with the position of Binah on top of the Pillar of Judgment (see n. 53 above); cf. Ponc6, Kabbalah, p. 144: "The Pillar of Judgment receives its name from the center Sefirah, Gevurah . . . the two [other] Sefirot [above and below it] are integral components of the middle value." Note that in Bahir, the angel "presiding over all the holy forms on the left side of God" is identified with Gabriel, i.e., Moon (see Scho- lem, Origins, pp. 147 f., and n. 68 above). In another section of Bahir, Binah is explained as "superior jus- tice" (Scholem, Origins, p. 136). Binah is "the Supernal Mother, within whose womb all that was contained in Wisdom finally be- comes differentiated [and out of whom] the remain- ing sefiroth proceed" (Ponc6, Kabbalah, pp. 122); compare this with Sin's epithets "birth-giving (dlidu) father," "father of the great gods," "procreator of all" (Tallqvist, Gitterepitheta, pp. 446); on the epithet "fruit (enbu) giving birth to itself" (ibid., pp. 24), see also nn. 66 and 89. 71 Cf. Marduk's epithets "merciful god/father/ lord, merciful and forgiving, the merciful one with forgiving heart, merciful to mankind"; for attesta- tions, see Tallqvist, Gitterepitheta, p. 371, and the dictionaries s.vv. remena and tajjaru, and see also Enuma eliK VI 137 and VII 27 ff. While "merciful" occasionally occurs as an epithet of other gods, too, its prominence as an epithet of Marduk in first- millennium texts, as well as the fact that it is fre- quently applied to the king as the image of Marduk (see the discussion in LAS, vol. 2, p. 58), confirms that it represented a central characteristic of this god. The other name of the Sefirah, Gedullah (Great- ness), corresponds to Marduk's ubiquitous epithet blu raba, "great lord" (Tallqvist, Gitterepitheta, p. 52). Note the co-occurence of both "great lord" and "merciful god" in the incipits of prayers to Mar- duk (W. Mayer, Untersuchungen zur Formensprache der babylonischen " Gebetsbeschwdrungen" [Rome, 1976], p. 397, nos. 18 and 23). 72 ?amag was the divine judge par excellence: the name Din exactly corresponds to ?amag's primary epithet bl dini, "lord of judgment," not attached to any other god (see Tallqvist, Gotterepitheta, p. 43; cf. ibid., pp. 456 ff.). The other common name of this Sefirah, Gevurah (Power of Might), corresponds to ?amag's standard epithets etlu, "strong man" (CAD, s.v.) and quradu, "hero" (CAD, s.v.); note that the corresponding Hebrew words (gever, "man," and gibbor, "hero") are derived from the same root as Gevurah, and that Akkadian qurdu, "heroism, valor; mighty deeds" (CAD, s.v.) is an exact semantic equivalent of Hebrew gevurah, which in the Psalms (71:16, 106:2, 145:2, and 150:2) refers to the "mighty deeds (or acts, works)" of God. In Rav's list of ten creative powers (see n. 49), Din is replaced by its synonym Mishpat, "decision, judgment," while Gevurah there corresponds to Nezah (see n. 74). 73 Note simply Igtar's well-known identification with Aphrodite and Venus and the epithet "lady/god- dess of beauty and love," which she shares with Nan- aya/Ta'metu (Tallqvist, Gitterepitheta, pp. 16 and 60; for Nanaya = Istar; see ibid., p. 385). In the Etana myth (see pp. 195 ff. below), IStar is portrayed as a beautiful virgin; see J. V. Kinnier Wilson, The Legend of Etana (Warminster, 1985), p. 110:10; cf. W. G. Lambert "The Problem of the Love Lyrics," in H. Goedicke and J. J. M. Roberts, eds,. Unity and Diversity (Baltimore, 1975), pp. 123, 18 ff.: "You are the mother, IStar of Babylon, the beautiful one, the queen of the Babylo- nians. You are the mother, a palm of carnelian, the beautiful one, who is beautiful to a superlative degree." The alternative name of this Sefirah, Rahamim (Compassion or Love), corresponds to Igtar's epithets "lady of love, the loving one, the one who loves all mankind," etc. (cf. above and Tallqvist, Gitterepi- theta, s.vv. bilet ru'dmi and rdnimtu). In her capacity as the goddess of love, IStar had a special relationship to the Assyrian king, who is repeatedly portrayed as her baby (see my discussion in the introduction of As- syrian Prophecies and cf. ibid., no. I iv 24, "I [I'tar] have loved you [the king] very much"; see also n. 84 below). This correlates nicely with the primary conno- tation of the word rahamim ("motherly feeling, com- passion"). Note, finally, that in contrast to the other Sefirot, the Sefirah of Tiferet was pictured as female; see n. 97 below, and cf. Ponc6, Kabbalah, pp. 127 f. 74 Cf. Ninurta's epithets "the warrior, the mighty son of Enlil, the victor who threshes the foe but makes the righteous stand, who achieved victory for Enlil, whose strength is exalted, [possess]or of might, killer of Anz^" in Lambert, "The Gula Hymn of Bullutsa-rabi," Or. n.s. 36 (1967): 116 ff., lines 9- 13; for Ninurta as the Mesopotamian victory god par excellence, see J. S. Cooper, The Return of Ninurta to Nippur (Rome, 1978), pp. 2 ff., and B. Hrugka, Der Mythenadler Anzu (Budapest, 1975), pp. 116 ff. In the first millennium, Ninurta largely merged with Nab0 (see F. Pomponio, Naba [Rome, 1978], pp. 189 ff.); the latter figures as the vanquisher of Anz^ in Cooper, Return of Ninurta, p. 147, and Liv- ingstone, SAA 3 no. 38:12 (see also ibid., nos. 34:57 f., 35:51 f., 39:24 ff. and r. 20, referring to Ninurta).</page><page sequence="19">THE ASSYRIAN TREE OF LIFE 179 PILLAR OF EOUIIBRIUM 1 ANU Cro w PILLAR OF JUDGMENT CrownPILLAR OF MERCY 3 2 SIN EA Understanding Wisdom I MUMMU \ Knowledge I 5 4 SAMAS MARDUK Judgment ENLIL Mercy 6 ISTAR Beauty 8 7 ADAD NABC GIRRU NINURTA NUSKU NI ,.

The equation Ninurta = Nabfi is explicitly attested in CT 25 11:12 and KAR 142 i 22 f. In Rav's list of ten creative powers (n. 49), Ninurta is represented as Ge- vurah, "might," which in the Sefirotic scheme nor- mally occurs as an alternative name of Din. In modern Kabbalistic literature, Nezah is, besides "Victory," also rendered "Endurance, Duration, Per- manence, Eternity," and the like. Such renderings agree with the meaning of the word in modern He- brew but not with the active nature of the Pillar of Mercy (see n. 53 above) nor with the attributes of Nabfi and Ninurta. It should be noted that in rabbini- cal Hebrew the root nsh means only "to be victori- ous, win, prevail" (see Jastrow, Dict., pp. 927 f.) and that the renderings "Endurance," etc., are not found in older Kabbalistic literature (see, for example, Robert Fludd, Philosophia Sacra [1626]: "Trium- phus Victoria"; Athanasius Kircher, Oedipus Aegyp- tiacus [Rome, 1652]: "Victory"). 75 See U. Seidl, "Gottersymbole und -attribute," RIA, vol. 3, p. 486. In Assyria the crown also occurs as a symbol of ASlur by virtue of A''ur's equation with Anu and Enlil (see Reade, "Shikaft-i Gulgul: Its Date and Symbolism," Iranica Antiqua 12 [1977]: 38; K. Tallqvist, Der assyrische Gott, StOr 4/3 [Helsinki, 1932], p. 13; and n. 94 below); this aspect of A''ur is referred to in Assyrian cultic texts as A''ur-Crown or AS'ur-Enlil, while AS'ur himself is referred to as plain A''ur or A''ur-ASlur (see, for example, 3R 66 i 14, iv 20 and v 24 f.). 76 See n. 74; on the usurpation of Enlil's position by Marduk, see W. Sommerfeld, Der Aufstieg Marduks, AOAT 213 (Neukirchen-Vluyn, 1982), pp. 175 ff. As stressed by Sommerfeld, Enlil's assimilation to Mar- duk was for political reasons never overt but was realized covertly through Marduk's appellative Bel ("Lord"), which replaces Enlil (See SAA 3 no. 39:31; cf. ibid. r. 12, where Bel = Marduk), and through the mystic number 50, attributed to both gods. 77 Note also SAA 3 no. 11 r. 5 (Assurbanipal's cor- onation hymn), where Anu is associated with the king's crown and Enlil with his throne. In Kabbalah, Keter is referred to as the "Ancient of Ancients, the Primordial Point or Monad," the first expression of God's primal will, which contains the plan of the en- tire universe and the power of all opposites in unity (Ponc6, Kabbalah, p. 113); it is the Alpha and the Omega, "all that was, is and will be, the place of first emanation and ultimate return" (Halevi, Kabbalah, p. 6). This corresponds to Anu's epithets "the first (god), the heavenly father, the greatest one in heaven and earth, the one who contains the entire universe, the father/progenitor of the (great) gods, creator of everything" (Tallqvist, G6tterepitheta, p. 254) and to his role in the creation process (see n. 55 above). For Anu as the Monad, see nn. 89, 94, and 104 below. 78 See CAD, s.v., and note that the word occurs in Neo-Assyrian royal inscriptions not only as a com- mon epithet of Nergal (in bel abdri u dunni, "lord of power and strength") but also as a synonym of us'u, "foundation," and as designation of the netherworld (dunni qaqqari, "bedrock, terra firma"); cf. SAA 3 no. 39: 34 ff. and see n. 38 above. Note also that in Rav's list of ten creative powers (n. 49), Yesod (Foundation) is replaced by Kah (Strength). In Kabbalah, Yesod is associated with "that aspect of the soul which corresponds to animal life and de- sires; [it is] located in the third world, the material and sensuous world, [and is] symbolic of both male and female genitals" (Ponc6, Kabbalah, pp. 68 and 129). Nergal's association with animal life and sexual de- sires is clear from passages such as Ebeling, Die akka- dische Gebetsserie "Handerhebung" (Berlin, 1953), p. 114:9 ("Enlil your father entrusted to you [Nergal] mankind, all living creatures, the cattle of ?akkan, and the herds of wild animals"), from his uncontrolled sexual behavior in the myth of Nergal and Ereikigal (S. Dalley, Myths from Mesopotamia [Oxford, 1989], pp. 171 ff.) and from his appellative "Gazelle" (CT 12 16:38, equated with the cattle god ?akkan in CT 29 46:13). For Nergal as Pluto, note his names Lugal- hegal and Ud-hegal, "King of Opulence" and "Day of Opulence" (Tallqvist, Gotterepitheta, pp. 353 and 476), as well as the personal name Sub'i-mre^r- ?akkan, "Bring-Riches-?akkan!" (CAD, s.v. mes'r). For Nergal as a beautiful, cunning Tempter (a role overlooked in E. von Weiher, Der babylonische Gott Nergal, AOAT 11 [Neukirchen-Vluyn, 1971]), note his identification with the fox in Livingstone, SAA 3 no. 38:37 (cf. Fox Star = Erra, CT 33 1 i 17), his ap- pellatives and epithets "King of Tricks" (Lugal- galamma), "cunning in tricks" (uzun nikilti), "of handsome face" (s'a pani banaf), (Tallqvist, Gotterepi- theta, pp. 352 and 393 ff.), and his ability to evade recognition in Nergal and Ereikigal (Dalley, Myths from Mesopotamia, p. 174). It seems likely that epi- thets such as "the power of earth" or "the strongest/ most potent/powerful of gods" refer to Nergal specifi- cally as the personification of sexual potency and man's animal instincts.</page><page sequence="21">THE ASSYRIAN TREE OF LIFE 181 I had to resort to Tallqvist's Akkadische Gotterepitheta to find that the only gods with epithets fitting the Sefirah of Hod (Splendor or Majesty) were the stormgod Adad, the firegod Girru, and Marduk, Nabfi, and Ninurta,79 the last three of whom already had their place in the diagram. Accordingly, this Sefirah corresponds to Adad and Girru, who share the same mystic number,s0 and it is noteworthy that in the Bible the word hod refers to Jahweh as a thundering and flashing storm.81 The last Sefirah, Kingdom (Malkhut), is defined as "the receptive potency which dis- tributes the Divine stream to the lower worlds,"82 which in Mesopotamia can only apply to the king as the link between God and Man.83 The motif of the king as distributor of the Divine stream is repeatedly encountered on Assyrian seals, where he holds a streamer emanating from the winged disk above the sacred Tree (fig. 8).84 I have excluded this Sefirah from the reconstructed model because it breaks the compositional harmony of the Tree and because the king, though impersonating the Tree, clearly does not form part of it in Assyrian art.85 79 The Hebrew word hod means "glory, splendor, beauty, majesty" and in rabbinical Hebrew also "dis- tinction, pride" (Jastrow, Dictionary, p. 337a); its closest semantic equivalent in Akkadian is the root srh with its derivates s'arhu and sitrahu, "glorious, splendid, proud," both of which are well attested as epithets of Adad, Girru, NabUi, Ninurta, and Marduk (see Tallqvist, Gitterepitheta, p. 230); the same gods also share the epithet gasru, "mighty" (ibid., p. 77). When referring to Adad and Girru, such epithets were certainly associated with the continuous flash- ing and roaring of a violent thunderstorm. Hod is defined in Kabbalah as "the support of the fifth Sefirah Judgment" (Ponc6, Kabbalah, p. 129), which "picks up and passes on information" (Halevi, Tree of Life, p. 32) and "reverberates the impulse throughout the Tree" (idem, Way of Kabbalah, p. 31). This agrees with Adad's role as the oracle god par excellence, announcing, by his roar, divine judgments and decisions to mankind; cf. his name "King of Decisions" and epithets "lord of oracles/ decisions, august judge," and the like (see Tallqvist, Gdtterepitheta, s.vv. Lugal-egbarra, bil biri/purussi, and dajjdnu siru. Note that in Rav's list of ten cre- ative powers (see n. 49 above), Hod is replaced by Gaarah, "Rebuke." 80 See RIA, vol. 3, p. 499b (for Gibil = Girru, see ibid., pp. 383 f.). Besides Adad and Girru, the mystic number 10 was also assigned to Madanu ("Verdict") and Nusku, the god of vigilance and hope (manifested in the lunar crescent, cock, and lamp); the equation Girru = Nusku = Madanu = Nuru ("Light") is explic- itly attested in Assyrian prayers; see Mayer, Unter- suchungen, pp. 386 and 406 f. For Nusku-Girru's epithets gaSru, sarhu, bukur/ilitti Anim, and tappe amasl which this god shares with Adad, see ibid. 81 "Then the LORD will make his voice heard in majesty (hod) and show his arm sweeping down in fierce anger with devouring flames of fire, with cloudburst and tempests of rain and hailstones" (Isa. 30:30, translation of the New English Bible [Oxford, 1970]). The beginning of this passage literally reads "Yahweh will make the majesty of his voice heard" (hsmyc yhwh 't-hwd qwlw), to be compared with "Adad, the voice of your [A''ur's] majesty" (siqir illiliitika Addu), KAR 128 r. 24. 82 The Standard Jewish Encyclopedia (Jerusalem, 1958-59), p. 1090. Cf. Halevi, Kabbalah, p. 7 ("The lowest Sefirah, the complement to Keter, the Crown, is Malkhut, the Kingdom. In it the Divine Light is earthed. It constitutes the Shekhinah, the Presence of God in Matter"), and Ponce, Kabbalah, p. 130 ("It is through her that the divine grace of En-Sof passes through into the lower world"). 83 See n. 28 above and M.-J. Seux, "Kinigtum," RlA, vol. 6, pp. 162 f. and 166 ff.; A. L. Oppenheim, Ancient Mesopotamia (Chicago, 1964), pp. 98 f. 84 Cf. nn. 25 and 55, and see, for further exam- ples, Danthine, Palmier-dattier, figs. 163, 333, 371, 372, 379, 420, 424, 429, 430, 432, 435, 437, and 445. In Collon, First Impressions, fig. 345, the streamers are exceptionally grasped not by the king but by a royal eunuch, probably the owner of the seal; the goddess I'tar appears in the background. The appear- ance of the goddess in the scene is not fortuitous; it should be noted that in Kabbalah, God's "Presence," Shekhinah, is envisioned as a beautiful woman, "vir- gin of light," with whom the mystic seeks to be united; see Idel, Kabbalah, pp. 83 ff., 229 ff., and 315, with many striking examples, and see n. 145 be- low. This notion of the Shekhinah agrees perfectly with the role played by Itar in Assyrian ecstatic prophecy, where she represents the Word of God manifested through prophetic spirit (to pneuma, "spiritus sanctus"); see my introduction in Assyrian Prophecies, and cf. n. 73 above. In a seal published by Lambert, "Near Eastern Seals in the Gulbenkian Museum of Oriental Art, University of Durham," Iraq 41 (1979): pl. 8:67, the streamers are held by I'tar herself along with another, unidentified, god. 85 The secondary nature of the Sefirah Malkhut is also indicated by the fact that it is not included</page><page sequence="22">182 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Once the gods had been placed in the diagram, which did not take longer than half an hour, I filled in their mystic numbers using as a guide W. R6llig's article "Gbtterzahlen" in the Reallexikon der Assyriologie (see fig. 9). For the most part, this was a purely me- chanical operation;86 in some cases, however, I had to choose between two or three al- ternative numbers."7 The numbers shown in figure 9 are those used in the spelling of divine names in the Middle and Neo-Assyrian standard orthography, and all of them are securely attested."8 I should point out that the number for Anu, 1, is erroneously given among the six Sefirot constituting the "Lower Face" (see n. 52 above) in Kabbalistic tradition, nor in Rav's list of the ten creative divine powers (n. 49). 86 That is, there was generally only one number per god and only one god per number. Gods with the same number were taken as equated and assigned the same place in the diagram (see nn. 74, 76, and 80). 87 In R61ig's list, Ea has three numbers, 40, 50(?), and 60; Adad has two numbers, 6 and 10; ?ama' has two numbers, 10 and 20; Ninurta has two numbers, 9(?) and 50. Actually, "9" for Ninurta, deduced only from the god's association with the ninth day, remains unattested and is best ignored; "50" for Ea occurs only in mur-50 = tmL'-dE.A (5R 44 iii 15), which cer- tainly is a mistake for Ur-40 (Gilg. X ii 22 and passim). This still leaves 6 and 10 for Adad, 10 and 20 for ?amal, and 40 and 60 for Ea. In addition, a passage overlooked by Rollig has 40 = Ninurta, so that this god too had two numbers, 40 and 50. Adad's number 6, which is the reciprocal of 10, plays a role only in the gematric speculations of I.NAM GI?.HUR and the cultic calendar Inbu bel arhi, where it is used to derive days sacred to Adad from combina- tions of 6 and 10 (6, 6 + 10, 6 + 10 + 10 and 6 + 6 + 6 + 10); see Landsberger, Kult. Kalender, p. 114. For a similar play with a mystic number, see Livingstone, Mystical Works, p. 41, lines 20-24, where ?ama' is equated with Sin (30 = 3) through the reciprocal of his mystic number 20 (3 = 60/20). ?amas's number 10 has been derived from 20 by splitting the latter into two (cf. Livingstone, ibid., lines 18 f.); it is attested only once in a lexical passage (see n. 104 below) and is clearly secondary to 20, used passim for writing the god's name. Ninurta's number 50, attributed to him as son of Enlil, is well attested and possibly of great an- tiquity (note Gudea's temple E-50 and the Ur III per- sonal name i-li-ha-an-ga, "My-God-is-50," UET 3 1080 r. ii 3); unlike 40, it was, however, never used for writing the god's name. For Ea's numbers 40 and 60, see Excursus 1, pp. 203-4 below. 88 For numerous examples of Ea written with the sign 60 (DI), all but one of them Assyrian, see Galter, Enki/Ea, pp. 10, 228 (NB), 236, and 268, and note also BBR 26 iii 44; KAR 35 r. 15 and 37:8; 4 R2 33 iii 43; Or. n.s. 22 39 r. 8; SAA 3 no. 37:17.23.32, 38:26.32, 39:35; STT 88 r. iv 16; and G. van Driel, The Cult of AHgur (Assen, 1969), p. 98:32. Ea was never spelled 40 in Assyrian texts; the two examples cited by Galter (Enki/Ea, pp. 230 and 248) are Neo- Babylonian or Late Babylonian, and ND 4358+:67 (see I. Finkel, in E. Leichty et al., eds., A Scientific Humanist: Studies in Memory of Abraham Sachs [Philadelphia, 1988], pp. 148 f.) is a copy of a Middle Babylonian original. For 50 = Enlil, see MSL 14, pp. 255 and 285 (Ea II 176 and Aa II/4:203 ff.). The equation 50 = Marduk is established by 50 = dBE in CT 13 32 r. 12, commenting on the fifty names of Marduk in EnCima elis' VII 144. For 40 = Ninurta see SAA 3 no. 47 r. 3 (Neo-Assyrian); the reading is ascertained through collation by A. K. Grayson, "Literary Letters from Deities and Diviners: More Fragments," JAOS 103 (1983): 148; Borger, RIA, vol. 3, p. 576b; and HKL 1, p. 327. 30 = Sin was prolific in personal names from the Akkadian period on, see W. von Soden, Das akkadische Syllabar, AnOr 42, [Rome, 1967], p. 55, Ranke, PN; Saporetti, Onomastica; and Tallqvist, APN and NBN, passim. For 15 = Ibtar and 10 = Adad in Middle Assyrian/Neo-Assyrian names, see Saporetti, Onomastica, vol. 2, pp. 177 ff., 191, and Tallqvist, APN, passim; only sporadic examples (all NB) are known from Babylonia. For many exam- ples of 20 = ?ama' in Neo-Assyrian/Neo-Babylonian astrological texts, see SAA 8, p. 352; the spelling was avoided in personal names for fear of confusion with 20 = garru. For 14 = Nergal/Sakkan, see CT 25 50:15 and cf. Landsberger, Kult. Kalender, p. 131, and von Weiher, Nergal, pp. 52 f.; the accuracy of King's copy (against Livingstone's "11," Mystical Works, pp. 32 f.) is ascertained through collations by M. Geller and W. G. Lambert. After a single occurrence in the reign of Adad- nirari I (Andrae, Stelenreihen 90:2.4), the spelling 10 = Adad suddenly becomes productive under Shal- maneser I (1273-1244); see KAJ 48:17, 51:18, 57:5, 62:4, 81:6, 90:20, 114:15, 118:9, 120:14 and 27 ff., 123:3, 156:4, 180:12, 217:10, 224:20, 275:5, 299:6, KAV 104:18, TR 100:12 f., 101:10 f., 102:12, 2086:4, and 2904:1 (datings after Saporetti, Gli eponimi medio-assiri [Malibu, 1979]). The earliest attestation of 15 = I'tar (KAJ 85:30) is from the reign of Tukulti- Ninurta I (1243-1207); see 0. Peders6n, Archives and Libraries in the City of Aslur, vol. 1 (Uppsala, 1985), p. 115 with n. 9. The earliest examples of 60 = Ea (Weidner, Tn. 60:2 and 61:1) date from the late twelfth century (reign of A''ur-re'-i'i I). In sum, it can be seen that the practice of writing divine names with numbers emerged under the Mid- dle Assyrian Empire and represents a genuinely Assyrian innovation; previously only the name of the moon god had been written this way, and only</page><page sequence="23">THE ASSYRIAN TREE OF LIFE 183 No. :o~oX A;/ 2'?` 41r, o.:iiii MIS q A"i4 11 4 ....... .....&gt;1&gt; 4 'r, 4 4 N.-MR 49ii4K //4 Z,4' / k4&gt; 1 #4 W Ol' N''4 ( &gt;14144ii 444 1'_- &gt;i&gt;~&gt; /4- 44 444i ~i4'4 ~ 74 4&gt;4&gt;4 / 44444 4 4'::_ 41 ,,/ #//~l4&gt; 44 74444&gt;4&gt; '4/:?:: FIG. 8.-The King as distributor of the Divine Stream.

Of course, the vertical wedge can also be read 60, but in the case of Anu, "the first god," the only reading that makes sense is 1, as we shall see presently.89 The ease with which the gods and their numbers fitted into the diagram was almost too good to be true, and the insights obtained in the process were more than encouraging. Suddenly, not only the diagram itself but the perplexingly opaque Mesopotamian reli- gion as well started to make sense;90 I felt on the verge of a major discovery. THE DISTRIBUTION OF GODS AND NUMBERS IN THE DIAGRAM Looking at the reconstructed diagram more closely, one observes that practically all the great gods of the Assyro-Babylonian pantheon figure in it, some occupying the same place because they were theologically equivalent.91 Only one major god is missing, Ai'ur, for whom no mystic number is attested.92 This strongly suggests that this impor- sporadic examples of other numerically written god names are known from later Babylonia. This ortho- graphical innovation can be securely dated to the early thirteenth century and thus coincides with the appearance of the Late Assyrian Tree (see n. 6). 89 See p. 188. The point is that the vertical wedge, in the absence of a symbol for zero in the Meso- potamian number system, stood for both I and 60, just as our number 1 (depending on its context) is a symbol for both 1 and 10; the value "1" is of course the primary one in both cases. As "One and Sixty," Anu's number comprised the mystic numbers of all other gods; he was the Alpha and the Omega (cf. above, n. 77). This point is made quite explicit in the esoteric work I.NAM GI9.HUR, where Anu is associ- ated not only with the crescent ("Appearance on the first day: the crescent (is) Anu . . . . The first (rs'ta) god, father of the gods, 1 (is) Anu"), but, through a gematric operation, also with the full moon: "15 times 4 is 60 ['1']; 60 (is) Anu; he called the 'fruit' [= full moon]" (see Livingstone, Mystical Works, pp. 23 and 30; for passages associating Anu with the first month and the first day, see B. Landsberger, Der kultische Kalender der Babylonier und Assyrer [1915; Leipzig, 1968], p. 105, and D. D. Luckenbill, The Annals of Sennacherib, OIP 2 [Chicago, 1924], p. 136). 90 In reducing the multitude of Mesopotamian gods to mere aspects of a few "great gods," and these again to mere aspects or powers of a single universal God (see below), the diagram unfolds a sophisticated monotheistic system of thought sharply deviating from the current simplistic notion of Mesopotamian religion and philosophy. As in Kabbalah, the key to the system is the Tree diagram, which functions as a mandala defining the essentials of the system in the simplest possible visual terms. Without this key, it would be next to impossible to understand the system on the basis of the scattered, highly symbolic, and often seemingly contradictory evidence of the Meso- potamian religious texts. A case in point is the god Ninurta/Nabfi, who is still commonly regarded as "the god of war or hunting" (cf., for example, Saggs, The Might That Was Assyria, p. 202) but is in fact a savior god comparable to Christ or Mithra; see Ex- cursus 2, pp. 204-5 below. 91 See nn. 74, 76, 78, 80, and 97. The pattern of equations and interrelationships found in the diagram is already discernible in the late second-millennium god list An = Anum (see Lambert, RIA, vol. 3, pp. 275 f.), which surveys the whole pantheon as an ex- tended royal family starting with the divine king, Anu, and then proceeding as follows: 2. Enlil, Ninurta, Bdlet-ili; 3. Ea, Marduk, Nabfi; 4. Sin, ?amal, Adad; 5. I'tar; 6. gods equated with Nabfi and Ninurta (Lugalmarda, Lugalbanda, Amurru, Tispak, In'u'inak, I'taran, Zababa, Ural, Ningirsu); 7. Nergal and other chthonic deities. As can be seen, the struc- ture of the list perfectly agrees with that of the dia- gram, bearing in mind that, for political reasons, the family of Enlil had to be presented as distinct from that of Marduk (see n. 76 above). In the diagram, which was esoteric, this requirement did not apply. From the reign of Tiglath-Pileser I on (1114- 1076), the gods found in the diagram appear as a group in Assyrian royal inscriptions, and by the reign of Ashurnasirpal II (883-859), the composition of the group has become more or less standardized (cf. Grayson, ARI, vol. 2, ?? 8, 413, 486, 646; Tadmor, SAA Bulletin 3 [1989]: 26). Interestingly, transferring the Ashurnasirpal group into the diagram in the order in which the gods are enumerated, one obtains a complete outline of the Tree divided into the "Up- per" and "Lower Faces" (see n. 52), with I'tar in the heart of the diagram as the terminal point (see fig. 10a); the same result is obtained when Rav's list of the ten creative powers are transferred to the diagram (see fig. 10d). This seems more than a coincidence; do we have in figure 10b the Assyrian "sign of the cross" defining the body of the Divine anthropos (cf. Ponc6, Kabbalah, p. 138)? 92 On the special status of AS'ur within the pan- theon, see also Lambert, "The God ASSur," Iraq 45 (1983): 82-85, who points out, among other things, that this important god "lacks the family connections which are characteristic of all the major gods and</page><page sequence="25">THE ASSYRIAN TREE OF LIFE 185 tant god has to be identified with the winged disk over the Assyrian Tree from which the Divine stream emanates93 and, accordingly, is identical with the transcendent God of Kabbalah, En Sof.94 As a matter of fact, the various spellings of AS"ur's name can, with- out difficulty, be interpreted as expressing the idea of the One, Only, or Universal God, goddesses of the Babylonians and Sumerians, uniting them in one big clan . . .One seeks in vain for his identity" (p. 82). 93 On the still open debate concerning the mean- ing of the winged disk, see Reade, "Shikaft-i Gulgul," pp. 38 f., with earlier literature; cf. idem, Assyrian Sculpture, pp. 26 f., and Lambert, "Trees, Snakes and Gods," p. 439. While the plain winged disk certainly was a symbol of the sun god, the an- thropomorphic disk with streamers (see n. 25 above; hereafter "the Icon") must be interpreted differently. Of decisive importance here is the textual evidence discussed in n. 28, which unquestionably establishes this particular form of the disk as a symbol of As'ur (see also n. 56 for the sun as a manifestation of A'- sur). This symbolism-and it alone-accounts for the role of the Icon in the Achaemenid Empire, where it (despite P. Calmeyer, "'Das Zeichen der Herrschaft... ohne ?ama' wird es nicht gegeben'," Archaeologische Mitteilungen aus Iran 17 [1984]: 147) certainly symbolized Ahura Mazda, the "God of Heaven," equated with Jahweh in Ezra 1:2. It should be stressed, however, that, according to the Assyrian(!) esoteric text SAA 3 no. 39 r. 4 f., the god riding in the disk was not ASSur but Marduk. This shows that the Icon represented a composite symbol consisting of several subordinate elements, each of which defined one aspect of A''ur. The figure of Marduk portrayed him as the creator, the winged disk, as the light of the world; the arrows shot by the god identified him as the conqueror of evil (see Excursus 2, pp. 204-5 below), the bow held by him represented I'tar, the power of love (cf. En. el. VI 84-91 and CAD, s.v. qas'tu, pp. 149b and 152b). The streams emanating from the disk iden- tified him as the source of wisdom (see nn. 55 and 69), their lightning ends underlined his might (see nn. 72 and 79); the Maltese Cross sometimes drawn inside the solar disk (Calmeyer, "'Das Zeichen der Herrschaft'," pp. 142 f.) portrayed him as the lord of the universe (see LAS, vol. 2, pp. 330 f., and note the Assyrian spelling of Ninurta with the sign of the cross, dMA9; see also n. 103 below). Thus the Icon portrayed ASSur as the sum total of the entire divine pleroma (see n. 56). This is consis- tent with the fact that in some seal scenes (for exam- ple, Danthine, Palmier-dattier, figs. 444, 471, 476; Orthmann, Der alte Orient, no. 274; S. Herbordt, SAA Studies 1, p. 99), the solar disk of the Icon is re- placed or accompanied by the lunar crescent; for the moon as an embodiment of the divine pleroma, see nn. 66 and 89 above. In Collon, First Impressions, no. 346, the crescent replaces the Tree. According to SAA 3 no. 39 r. 4 f., the divine figure inside the moon represented Nabfi. Thus it may be hypothesized that in Icons showing two minor gods beside the central figure (see n. 25 above), the right- hand god likewise represented Nabfi, occupying a place of honor beside his father comparable to that of Christ or Michael as "the archon of all the holy forms on the right side of God" (see Scholem, Ori- gins, pp. 147 f. and Excursus 2 below). To complete the trinity with a female member, the left-hand god would then logically be Marduk's wife Zarpanitu, alias Baltiya, "My Lady," the Babylonian Madonna (cf. SAA 3 no. 37 r. 24 ff. and SAA 9 no. I ii 16 ff., and see n. 97 below). 94 See nn. 50, 55, 56, and 113. In Kabbalistic the- osophy, En Sof ("The Limitless") is defined as total unity beyond comprehension; his Will to manifest himself, which lies behind all existence, is called En Sof Or, "The Endless Light," and envisioned as a boundless ocean of light engulfing and pervading the physical world (see, for example, Halevi, Kabbalah, p. 5, and Tree of Life, pp. 28 f.; Ponc6, Kabbalah, pp. 93 ff.; Idel, Kabbalah, pp. 67 f. and 307 with n. 72; for En Sof as "the circle," see ibid. p. 63). The rela- tionship of the Will of En Sof (i.e., En Sof Or) to his first emanation (i.e., Keter) has been a matter of de- bate among Kabbalists, and many claim the identity of the two of them (see Scholem, "Kabbalah," pp. 560 f.). In the popular Kabbalah, En Sof is "merely a synonym for the traditional God of religion" (ibid., p. 559). This accords well with the fact that A''ur is com- monly referred to as "the God" in Assyrian cultic texts (e.g., KAR 215 r. ii 9; van Driel, Cult of AlSur, pp. 88:36 and 136:16 ff.; Ebeling, "Kultische Texte aus Assur," Or. n.s. 22 (1953): 36 r. 5 ff. and 39 r. 4) and identified with Anu in god lists (see Lambert, "The Gula Hymn," p. 130, and see also n. 75 above and pp. 191 f. below). In Craig, ABRT I 83, ASSur is called "king of the totality of gods, creator of him- self; father of the gods, who grew up in the Abyss; king of heaven and earth, lord of all gods, who ema- nated (lit., "poured out") the supernal and infernal gods and fashioned the vaults of heaven and earth"; in SAA 3 no. 34:53 ff. and 35:44 ff., he is said to be "dressed in water" (see n. 96 below) and have "come into being before heaven and earth existed." Note that the solar disk in ASSur's icon is sometimes re- placed by two concentric circles with a point in the center (see Collon, First Impressions, no. 340; Dan- thine, Palmier-dattier, fig. 488), identical with the Kabbalistic diagram illustrating the manifestation of En Sof as the Universal Monad (Ponc6, Kabbalah, p. 52).

The remaining gods are arranged to the right and left sides of the trunk in a corresponding way, with sons lined under their fathers.

Kalender, pp. 105 and 131, on the "vereinfachung des weiblichen Panthe- ons" in the Assyrian cultic calendar, and note the equations Zarpanitu = Bdlet-ili = ?erua = Erua = I'tar in Mayer, Untersuchungen, pp. 379 f. and 425, and Gula = Nintinugga = Nanse = Ninkarrak = Baba = Ninsun = Mullissu in Lambert, "The Gula Hymn," p. 109; in KAR 109, Baba is addressed as "Mullissu of the gods" and equated with Ningal, Aya, I'tar, Erua, etc. In accordance with this, Assyrian texts fre- quently speak of "the gods and I'tar," the singular implying that there was, in fact, only one, not sev- eral, "female" deities; see, for example, Ebeling, "Mittelassyrische Rezepte," pl. 26 r. 9; TCL 3, p. 20: 115; SAA 3 no. 1: 16 (AS'ur as the progenitor of "the gods and I'tar"). Such a usage of course perfectly agrees with the Tree diagram, where I'tar is sur- rounded by eight "male" deities; cf. the Kabbalistic parable in Bahir explaining the divine pleroma as a garden planted with nine male (palm) trees and one feminine tree (the ethrog), analyzed in Scholem, Ori- gins, p. 172 (cf. n. 124 below). In this context, it is noteworthy that the plural ildni, "gods," is used as a divine name and construed as a singular noun in Middle and Neo-Assyrian personal names. Examples are Iqbi-ilani "ildni commanded (sg.)" (CTN 3 52 r. 9, VAS 1 99 r. 2, etc.) and Remanni-ilani "ildni, have (sg.) mercy on me!" (VAT 9693 r. 1), both seventh century, to be compared with Iqbi-ASSur/Ilu/I'tar, "AS'ur/God/Itar commanded," and Remanni-A''ur/Ilu/Itar; Ilani- eril, "ildni requested (sg.)" (AfO 10 39 no. 84:8, twelfth century); and Ilani-aha-iddina (TR 3016:6, thirteenth century), to be compared with A''ur/Ilu/ Ibtar-eri' and the royal name A''ur-ahu-iddina (Esar- haddon). The parallel names imply that ildni here stands for the divine pleroma conceived as one god, and this conclusion is corroborated by such names as Gabbu-ilani-sarru-usur, "All gods, protect (sg.) the king!" (Ass. 8890: 9 and r. 5) and Gabbu-ilani-eril, "All gods requested (sg.)" (Tallqvist, APN, p. 78). Note that the latter name was borne by the chief scribe and ideologist of Ashurnasirpal II; and see nn. 30, 31, and 38 above. This usage of ilini, of course, has a well-known parallel in this biblical plu- ralis majestatis, elohim, "God" (lit. "gods"). 98 On the triadic structure of the Sefirotic Tree, in general, see Halevi, Kabbalah, p. 8. The horizontal tri- ads, corresponding to the divine generations, are re- ferred to as "a succession of layers" (see Scholem, Origins, p. 75, quoting the Book of Bahir) and associ- ated not only with the "Worlds of Creation" (see n. 55), but also with three degrees of consciousness and layers of the soul. The latter association gives the Tree a psychological dimension equaling in impor- tance its theological and cosmological dimensions. The topmost triad, representative of En Sof 's power of thought, corresponds to the highest degree of con- sciousness, the divine or "over-soul" Neshamah lo- cated in the center Sefirah, Keter (head). It is "the place where the individual perceives the 'plan' or meaning of being" (Ponce, Kabbalah, p. 204). The second triad, representative of En Sof's moral power and emotion, corresponds to the self-conscious soul Ruah located in the Sefirah Tiferet (heart). It is the world of "moral virtues and ability to distinguish be- tween good and evil.., .a position where [man can] see others not in the light of his own needs, but in the light of their own" (ibid., pp. 202 ff.). The lowermost triad corresponds to the "animal soul," Nefesh, located in the Sefirah Yesod (genitals). It is the world of instincts where "all conscious energies are concentrated in the sexual and instinctual sphere [and] the individual is conscious only of his own needs" (ibid.). In contrast to the cosmological Tree, which is visu- alized as emanating from above (cf. the "inverted tree" in Cook, The Tree of Life, pl. 38), the psychological Tree is rooted in the netherworld, and its different lay- ers are viewed in terms of a gradual progress towards a higher form of consciousness. In Hekhalot Rabbati, the Tree is likened to "a celestial ladder whose first edge is on the earth and second edge on the right leg of the throne of glory" (Dan, Revelation, p. 30; see also ibid., p. 22, where "the one who is worthy to observe the King and the throne" is likened to "a man who has a ladder in his house"). This imagery is reflected in the iconography of the Assyrian Tree (cf. nn. 20 and 22).</page><page sequence="28">188 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES lines connecting the gods exactly render the divine genealogies known from late second- and early first-millennium texts.99 But that is not all. The distribution of the mystic numbers in the diagram (fig. 9) adds to it a dimension unknown in the Sefirotic Tree. Six of the numbers are full tens, all neatly arranged, in descending order, on the branches of the Tree: those higher than 30 to the right, the rest to the left side. The numbers on the trunk are not tens, and their ar- rangement is different: they begin with 1, as in the Sefirotic Tree, but the following two are not in numerical order. Does this distribution make any sense? Initially, we note that the numbers on the trunk, when added together, yield 30, the median number of the sexagesimal system.'00 From the standpoint of number harmony, this tallies beautifully with the medium position of the trunk and recalls its Kabbalistic designation, the Pillar of Equilibrium. The position of the number 15 in the center of the diagram is justifiable from the same point of view.'0' On the surface, the numbers on the right and left of the trunk seem to upset the bal- ance of the Tree because the numbers on the left are consistently smaller than those on the right. Yet, when one adds the numbers together, one obtains for each branch the same total (30) as for the trunk, the Pillar of Equilibrium. This is so because the num- bers on the left side, according to the polar system of oppositions governing the Tree, are negative and thus have to be subtracted from those on the right side. 02 The sum total of the branches and the trunk (4 x 30 = 120) added to the sum total of the individ- ual numbers (1 + 10 + 14 + 15 + ... + 60 = 240) yields 360, the number of days in the Assyrian cultic year and the circumference of the universe expressed in degrees.103 99 For Anu, Ea, Sin, ?amas, IEtar, Marduk, Nabji, Ninurta, and Nergal, see Tallqvist, Gitterepitheta, pp. 251 ff. and see also n. 91 above. Adad, Girru, and Nusku are, because of their association with fire, ad- dressed as sons of Anu (see nn. 65 and 79 f.). Note that Marduk and I'tar are called "the brother" (talimu) and "sister" (talimtu) of ?amas, while IEtar is "the daughter" of both Anu and Sin and "the daughter-in- law" of Ea. This fits I'tar's position in the diagram perfectly and recalls a passage in the Assyrian proph- ecies (SAA 9 no. 3 ii 35), where I'tar invites her "di- vine fathers and brothers" to join the covenant she is concluding with the King. In this text, I'tar is unques- tionably identical with ASSur (cf. ibid. ii 27 with iii 14 f., and see Excursus 2, pp. 204-5 below. 100 For 30 as the median number, see the esoteric passage "bai = share, bai = half: half (bta) of Sin (30) is half of a half" (Livingstone, Mystical Works, p. 23:12 [I.NAM GI.HUR]). 101 The position of Beauty in the middle of the Tree makes it "the central focus [which] joins and reconciles the flow of various paths that come through its junction station" (Halevi, Way of Kab- balah, p. 31); in Sefer Yezirah, the Sefirot are said to be "knotted in unity in the middle," as if the writer had the Assyrian Tree with its central node (see n. 22 above) before his eyes. A diagram in Ponce, Kab- balah, p. 104, captioned "Beauty as the bearer of all powers," represents the Sefirotic Tree in the form of an eight-pointed star, with Tiferet as its source of light. This, of course, immediately recalls the eight- pointed star attested as a symbol of I'tar since the late second millennium B.C. (cf. Seidl, RIA, vol. 3, pp. 484 f.; Reade, "Shikaft-i Gulgul," pp. 37 f.). The choice of 15 as the mystic number of I'tar can actu- ally be explained only with reference to the diagram; note that the emergence of this mystic number coin- cides with the emergence of the Assyrian Tree (see n. 88 above). 102 See n. 53 above. 103 The significance of this grand total can be ap- preciated when it is recalled that in the doctrinal sys- tem of Basilides (early second century), God is the union of the 365 days of the year, 365 being the ge- matric value of both His mystic name ABRASAX and its Greek appellation hagion onoma ("holy name"); see Contenau, "Notes d'iconographie," p. 156, for many other examples of gematria (Greek: isopsephy) in early Christianity and Gnosticism. As noted by Contenau, the letters of Mithra (Greek Mithras) interpreted gematrically likewise yield the number 365. See also Ponc6, Kabbalah, pp. 170 f., for 358 as the number of the Messiah (Hebrew m'yh = 40 + 300 + 10 + 8). A schematic year of 360 days divided into twelve months of 30 days each is encountered not only in the Assyrian cultic calendar Inbu bel arhi (see n. 87 above) but also in the late second-millennium astro- nomical text Mul Apin (see Excursus 1, pp. 203-4 above); in the latter, it is correlated with a division of</page><page sequence="29">THE ASSYRIAN TREE OF LIFE 189 In all, it can be said that the distribution of the mystic numbers in the diagram dis- plays an internal logic and, remarkably, contributes to the overall symmetry, balance, and harmony of the Tree. All this numerical beauty is lost with the decimal numbering of the Sefirotic Tree, which only reflects the genealogical order of the gods.'04 The fact that the numerical balance of the Tree can be maintained only on the condition that the left-side numbers are negative, as required by Kabbalistic theory, in my opinion amounts to mathematical proof of the correctness of the reconstruction. Considering further the perfect match obtained with the placement of the gods, their grouping into meaningful triads and genealogies,105 and the identification of Ai'ur with the winged disk, I feel very confident in concluding that the Sefirotic Tree did have a direct Meso- potamian model and that this model was perfected in the Assyrian Empire, most proba- bly in the early thirteenth century B.C.106 the solar year into four seasons of equal length, cor- responding to the later division of the ecliptic into twelve zodiacal signs of 30 degrees each (see van der Waerden, Anfdinge der Astronomie, pp. 78 f.). Since the correct length of the solar year (365 days) is also found in Mul Apin, the text's insistence on the sche- matic year indicates a desire to state the length of the year in terms of "time degrees" derived from the cir- cular path of the sun "round" the earth. In other words, the author of the text associated the sun not only with the length of the year but with the circum- ference of the universe as well. This conclusion is confirmed by Julianus Apostata's (361-363) hymn to King Helios, which, as observed by van der Waerden (ibid., pp. 227 ff.), is directly based on Mul Apin. This association explains the particular form of the solar disk in A''ur's icon (see n. 93 above): the Mal- tese Cross symbolized the turning points and thus gave the disk a cosmic dimension, making it a sym- bol of the universe. The wavy lines radiating out between the arms of the cross, sometimes terminat- ing in palmettes (Calmeyer, "'Das Zeichen der Herrschaft... '," pp. 142 f. and 150), turn the disk into a variant of the eight-pointed star symbol of Ibtar (n. 101), representing the divine pleroma in the form of a four-spoked wheel. The wheel form cer- tainly referred to the eternal rotation of the seasons and thus added to the disk the notion of eternity. We thus have the following string of associations: Sun = Year = Universe = Eternity. It is not difficult to see why both Christ and Mithra were associated not only with the year but also with the sun and (Mithra) with the Zodiac. 104 The decimal numbering of the Sefirot derived from their order of emanation (see n. 48 above) of course also applies to the Assyrian Tree; see n. 87 showing that the number 3 was associated with Sin, the third god to be emanated; see also n. 117. With the inclusion of Mummu (zero), the equivalent of the non-Sefirah Daat (see nn. 110 and 124, and cf. nn. 49 and 52), the total of the gods in the reconstructed Tree becomes 10, equaling the number of the Sefirot in the Sefirotic Tree. In early Kabbalah, as also in Gnosticism, the need to unify the ten divine powers is commonplace; see Idel, Kabbalah, pp. 120 f. Note especially the following passage from The Refutation of All Heresies by the Gnostic Monoimos, cited ibid.: "The monad, [that is] the one tittle, is, therefore, he says, also a decad. For by the actual power of this one tittle are produced duad, and triad, and tetrad, and pentad, and hexad, and heptad, and ogdoad, and ennead, up to ten. For these numbers, he says, are ca- pable of many divisions, and they reside in that un- compounded and single tittle of the iota." Compare this with the Mesopotamian lexical passage Aa 11/4: 1 ff. (MSL 14, p. 280) explaining the number ten as "Anu, Antu, Enlil, Sin, ,amas, Adad, I'tar, I'tar as a star, totality, wisdom, god, creation, and counting." It will surely not have escaped the attention of Meso- potamian mystics that 360 (see preceding note) mul- tiplied by ten yields 3,600, the number of totality and perfection (9AR); cf. Excursus 3, pp. 205-8 below. 105 See also nn. 70, 74, 79, and 99 f. on the posi- tions of Sin, Ninurta, Adad, and I'tar in the diagram. 106 In light of the evidence discussed above (see nn. 6, 33, 36 f., 56, 65 f., 88, and 97, and Excursus 2 be- low), it is clear that the emergence of the Tree, and the monotheistic ideas connected with it, correlates with the rise of the Middle Assyrian Empire and the as- sumption of the title "king of the universe" by the As- syrian emperors; the doctrine of "unity in multiplicity" (see n. 21 above), of course, admirably suited the structure of this empire, which was not just a large multinational state but a veritable pleroma of diverse semi-independent vassal powers unified under the ab- solute power of the king. The title "king of the uni- verse" is already attested for the founder of the empire, ASSur-uballit I (1369-28), and his Babylonian contem- porary Burnaburia' II (see Seux, Epithetes, pp. 308 ff.: the single attestation of the title for Kurigalzu I listed there comes from a late copy and is uncertain); the nu- merical spelling of the word "universe" with the sign 9AR, "3,600," however, becomes established only under Adad-nirari I (1305-1274) and Kurigalzu II (1332-1308), the son of A''ur-uballit installed by the latter on the Babylonian throne. It is worth noting that</page><page sequence="30">190 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Being able to reconstruct this Tree, date it, and understand the doctrinal system un- derlying it has tremendous implications to the history of religion and philosophy which cannot be pursued within the limits of this paper.107 I will content myself with three con- crete examples illustrating how the insights provided by the Tree are bound to revolu- tionize our understanding of Mesopotamian religion and philosophy. III. THE TREE AND MESOPOTAMIAN RELIGION AND PHILOSOPHY THE BIRTH OF THE GODS IN ENUMA ELIS In Eniima elis, the narrator, having related the birth of Anu, mysteriously continues: "And Anu generated Nudimmud (= Ea), his likeness." This can only be a reference to the first attestation of the spelling AN.?AR = A''ur like- wise occurs in an inscription of this very Kurigalzu II (see Seux, Epithltes, p. 311). Thus, already by the late fourteenth century, the Tree with its pinecone "garland" certainly connoted the idea of "unity in multiplicity" and may also have involved a numerical interpretation; note that the mys- tic numbers of ?ama' (20), Sin (30), Ea (40), and Enlil (50) occur in the Middle Babylonian lexical text Ea (Tablet II, 164-76), tentatively assigned "to the middle of the Kassite period" by M. Civil, MSL 14, p. 169; cf. ibid. p. 156. The fact that the numbers of Adad (10) and I'tar (15) are not included in Ea but ap- pear only under Shalmaneser I and Tukulti-Ninurta I, however (see n. 88), strongly suggests that the final (mathematical) form of the Tree diagram was per- fected no earlier than about 1250 B.C. While the Tree diagram and the elaborate doctrinal system associated with it can thus be considered an Assyrian creation, the general symbolism of the Tree, including its psychological dimension, is much older and may well go back to the third millennium B.C., if not earlier; see p. 1 above with nn. I and 14, and nn. 109, 139, and 149 below. 107 As a point of departure, it should be understood that the Assyrian religion was not only imposed on vassals (see SAA 2 no. 6:393 f. and p. xxx), but also actively propagated throughout the empire (cf. SAA 3 no. 1:3-10 and r. 9-12). Thus the religious ideas con- nected with the Tree were, with time, bound to spread out and take root within the confines of the empire and even abroad. This process is amply documented by ar- chaeological evidence (the most striking example be- ing the direct transfer of Assyrian religious symbolism to Achaemenid imperial art [see n. 93 above]), and it is reflected in the sudden emergence of "new" reli- gions and philosophies (Zoroastrism, Pythagoreanism, Orphism, Platonism, Jewish monotheism) in Assyria's former dependencies after the collapse of the empire. It is well known that leading Neoplatonists, such as Plotinus and Porphyry (who as Orientals should have known!), believed that the teachings of Pythagoras, Plato, and the Orphics originated in the East (see, for example, D. O'Meara, Pythagoras Revived: Mathe- matics and Philosophy in Late Antiquity [Oxford, 1989], p. 27, and R. T. Wallis, Neoplatonism [London, 1972], pp. 13 ff. and 104 ff.). This claim, which is perfectly consonant with what is known of the lives of Pythagoras and Plato, and has been repeated several times, though never "proven" (see Idel, Kabbalah, pp. 256 f., and n. 67 above), is put in a totally new light by the evidence cited in this article. As regards the birth of Jewish monotheism in par- ticular, which has been taken as a "reaction" to syn- chretistic and polytheistic pressures from the outside world threatening the national and religious identity of the Jews, the evidence presented in this article shows that the truth is not that simple. During the seventh through fifth centuries B.C., the Jews did in fact face the threat of national extinction, but that threat was caused by Yehoiakim's and Zedekiah's adventurous foreign policies leading to the destruction of the Jewish state and the cult of Jahweh, not by foreign ideologies. Biblical passages such as Chron. 29:11, enumerating the Sefirot constituting the "Lower Face" in the very order gedullah-gevurah-tiferet-nezah-hod in David's blessing to Solomon, or Prov. 3:19, pre- senting the triad hokhmah-tevunah-daat as God's power of creation (see nn. 49, 52, and 55 above), are clear evidence that the backbone of Assyrian and Kab- balistic monotheism, the Tree diagram, was part and parcel of the Deuteronomistic religion as well. As soon as it is realized that the Biblical image of God, epitomized in the diagram, is but a copy of an Assyr- ian model, there is nothing unique in Jewish monothe- ism to differentiate it from its Assyrian predecessor (see also n. 97, on Biblical elohim = "God," and nn. 68, 90, 93, and Excursus 3 below). The same applies to Christianity with its doctrines of the Trinity, God the Father, the Holy Ghost, Unity of the Father with the Son, etc., all of which are derived from Assyrian religion and philosophy (see nn. 3, 21, 25, 56, 67, 84, 90, 93, 96, 103, and Excur- sus 2 below). The crucial significance of the Tree to early Christianity is made evident by the reference to it in Rev. 22, the last chapter of the Bible, mirroring the famous Tree passage in Gen. 2-3, at the very be- ginning of the Bible. This configuration makes the</page><page sequence="31">THE ASSYRIAN TREE OF LIFE 191 the fact that the mystic numbers of these two gods, 1 and 60, were written with the same sign,108 and indicates that the composer of the epic conceived the birth of the gods as a mathematical process. On the surface, of course, the theogony of Eniima elis' is presented in terms of human reproduction.109 As the example just quoted shows, however, it did involve more than just one level of meaning. In fact, the curious sequence of "births" presented in Tablet I 1-15 makes much better sense when it is rephrased "mathematically" as follows: "When the primordial state of undifferentiated unity (Apsu + Mummu + Tiamat, "+0"),110 in which nothing existed, came to an end, nothingness was replaced by the binary system of oppositions (Lahmu and Lahamu)"' and the infinite universe (An'ar = AS'ur) with its negative counterpart (Kisar).112 A'sur emanated Heaven (Anu) as his pri- mary manifestation, to mirror his existence to the world.""'3 Thus rephrased, the passage comes very close to Kabbalistic and Neoplatonic metaphysics.114 Tree, which is Christ, the key to the theological struc- ture of early Christianity, its "Alpha and Omega, [its] first and [its] last, [its] beginning and [its] end" (Rev. 22:13). 108 See n. 89 above. 109 The metaphysical propositions of Tantra are stated in very similar terms, but the sexual allegory is taken much further. Reality in its primordial state is presented as consisting of two principles, male and female [= Apsu and Tiamat], so deeply joined in bliss that they are unaware of their differences and beyond time. Slowly, consciousness [= Mummu] awakens, and the pair become aware of their distinc- tion [= Lahmu and Lahamu]. The female "objective" [= Kisar] separates from the male "subject" [= ASSur] and begins the sacred dance which "weaves" the fab- ric of the world (see P. Rawson, Tantra: The Indian Cult of Ecstasy [London, 1973], pp. 18 f.). It is clear that this allegory is strongly implicit in Enuima elis, too, but the phrasing of the text is kept intentionally vague to allow other interpretations as well, includ- ing misinterpretations. The idea of an inverted tree (see n. 98 above) rep- resenting a manifestation of the cosmos from a single transcendent source, Brahman, is already attested in the earliest Indian scriptures, the Vedas and Upan- ishads (ca. 900-500 B.C.). This inverted tree is not derived from the Assyrian Tree; its visualization as the fig tree (asvattha) links it with the Harappan sa- cred tree motif (see n. 1 above), suggesting that the basic doctrines of the Tree had already spread to In- dia by the early third millennium B.C. via Proto- Elamite intermediaries. 110 Note the way in which the unity of Apsu, Mummu, and Tiamat is presented in the text: the wa- ters of Apsu and Tiamat are said to mix with each other, and Mummu (lacking the divine determinative, in contrast to line 31 ff.) is not presented as a distinct being but directly attached (almost as an attribute) to Tiamat. For Mummu as the cosmic mind or con- sciousness "zeroed" in the primordial state see n. 109, and note that Damascius, Quaestiones de pri- mis principiis, chap. 125 (see Excursus 3 below), re- ferring to Babylonian informants, explains Mummu as ton noeton kosmon, "cosmic reason (or conscious- ness)." In En. el. I 48, mummu (without the divine de- terminative) clearly has the meaning "mind, reason"; cf. milik temiya, OIP 2, p. 109 vii 5, and note that there was no semantic distinction between "mind," "reason," or "consciousness" in Akkadian (cf. AHw. s.v. tEmu). For Mummu as an equivalent of the Sefi- rah Daat, see n. 124 below, and note the definitions of Daat as "the cosmic consciousness" and "the door into Timelessness.. .the edge of where Time does not exist" in Halevi, Kabbalah, pp. 168 and 182. The interpretation of Mummu as the equivalent of zero, implied by its position in the Tree diagram (cf. n. 116), is also clear from its insertion between the male and female principles in En. el. I 3-4. 111 That Lahmu and Lahamu represent the binary oppositions is made clear by Mesopotamian icon- ography, where they are represented as antithetically (often upside-down) posed naked figures struggling with each other or separating heaven from earth; see Lambert, "The Pair Lahmu-Lahamu in Cosmogony," Or. n.s. 54 (1985): 189-202, especially 197 ff. For the nudity of the figures, see Gen. 3:7-11. 112 As the opposite of ASSur (Endless Light), Kisar must be understood as the finite physical uni- verse (dominated by darkness). It corresponds to the void created by En Sof for his manifestation; cf. Ha- levi, Kabbalah, p. 5, and Ponc6, Kabbalah, pp. 79 ff. 113 Note that in this connection the text carefully avoids using the word "created" or "made": literally translated, the passage reads "An'ar reflected (umaS'il) Anu, his first-born." The idea of reflection is further strengthened by the chiastic insertion of Anu in the preceding line. For the emanation of Keter as the "mirror" of En Sof's existence see Ha- levi, Kabbalah, p. 5; on the identity of AS"ur and Anu and En Sof and Keter, see nn. 75 and 94 above. 114 For the latter, see, for example, Wallis, Neo- platonism, pp. 47-72.</page><page sequence="32">192 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Lines 21-24 of Tablet I of Eniima elis' seem to describe the "birth" of the mystic num- ber of Sin which can be derived from the number of Ea by simply dividing it by two.115 The irritation of Apsu caused by this play with numbers and the subsequent killing of Apsu and "leashing" of Mummu (lines 29-72) seem to be an etiology for the emanation of the third number and the establishment of the places of Ea and Mummu in the Tree diagram.116 The "birth" of Marduk, the next god in the diagram, is described in the fol- lowing lines as expected. Marduk's mystic number, like the numbers of all the remaining gods, can be derived from the preceding numbers by simple arithmetical operations.117 The prominent part played by numbers both in Eniima elis' and the Assyrian Tree of course immediately recalls the central role of mathematics and divine numbers in Pythagorean philosophy."8 THE EPIC OF GILGAMESHll9 Looking at the Epic of Gilgamesh through Kabbalistic glasses, a new interpretation of the Epic can be proposed viewing it as a mystical path of spiritual growth culminating in the acquisition of superior esoteric knowledge (see fig. 12).120 The Path proceeds in stages through the Tree of Life, starting from its roots dominated by animal passions, 115 The passage tells that the gods (i.e., the num- bers 1, 60, and 2 that had come into being thus far, 2 as the sequential number of Ea) "came together" and disturbed Apsu by their "playing." This can be taken literally as referring to the "play with numbers" (see n. 87) by which all the mystic numbers in the Tree diagram can be derived from the previously "ema- nated" values (see also n. 117). 116 With the emergence of the number of Sin (30), the flow of emanation gets temporarily out of balance until Ea "establishes a universal pattern" (line 62, probably referring to the zigzagging pattern of the stream of emanation) and assumes a position "on top" of Apsu, the male principle (line 71; cf. Ea's position on top of the right-hand male column, fig. 9). The "binding" of Mummu (line 70, referring to the Pillar of Equilibrium) restores balance by forming the sym- metrical tetrad of the "Upper Face" (Anu-Ea-Sin- Mummu; see n. 52). The "leashing" of Mummu, with Ea holding the leash, certainly refers to the stabiliza- tion of the positional value 60 for Ea's number, in con- trast to the number of Anu, written with the same sign, which could be read both I and 60 (see n. 89). Inci- dentally, the fact that Ea's number in Enama elis is the "Assyrian" 60, not the "Babylonian" 40 (cf. n. 88), confirms the late (Isin II) date assigned to the Epic by Lambert, in W. S. McCullough, ed., The Seed of Wis- dom (Toronto, 1964), pp. 3 ff. 117 Marduk's number 50 is derived from the num- bers of Ea (60) and Sin (30) by the following equa- tion: 60 - 30 + 3 = 50; the divisor 3 (representing Sin's position in the order of emanation) is attested as a number of Sin in the mystical work I.NAM GI.HUR (see n. 87). Note Ponc6, Kabbalah, p. 125: "Hesed [Marduk] is produced by the union of Wisdom [Ea] and Understanding [Sin]." The numbers of the other gods (in their order of emanation) can be derived as follows: ?amag (6th): 60 + 3 = 20; I'tar (7th): 60 + 4 = 15; Nabfi/Ninurta (8th): 60 - 60 + 3 (or 2 x 20) = 40; Adad (9th): 60 + 6 = 10; Nergal (10th): 15 - 1 (or 2 x 7) = 14. 118 On the Babylonian background of Pythagorean mathematics and astronomy, see van der Waerden, Die Pythagoreer (Zurich and Munich, 1979), pp. 40 ff. 119 In the absence of an adequate critical edition, the following analysis is based on my own unpub- lished reconstruction of the Epic. The recent transla- tions by M. Gallery Kovacs, The Epic of Gilgamesh (Palo Alto, 1985), and S. Dalley, Myths from Meso- potamia (Oxford, 1989), pp. 50 ff., can be consulted for eneral orientation. o0 Gilgame' is prominently marked as a mystic by the following features in the Epic: (1) the epithet "perfect" accorded to him in Tablet I (cf. n. 57) which qualifies him as a Zadek, "just or saintly man, not born but made, partly by the assis- tance of God and partly by his own effort" (see Ha- levi, Way of Kabbalah, pp. 74 ff.); (2) the special technique (pressing head between knees) he uses for attaining dreams (Tablet IV iii 6); on this "posture of Elijah," see Idel, Kabbalah, pp. 78 ff. and 90; (3) the technique of weeping, fasting, and praying (Tablet IX 1-14) he uses for achieving the paranormal state of consciousness and visions recounted in Tab- lets IX-XI; see Idel, Kabbalah, pp. 75 ff.; Dan, Three Types, p. 29; (4) his role as revealer of hidden mystical knowl- edge (Tablet I 4-7); see ibid., p. 28, and Revelation, pp. 24 ff.; (5) the recurrent references to his ascetic appear- ance and behavior in Tablets I and IX-X (dress of skin, unkempt hair, roaming the desert), consonant with his prophetic role; see Idel, Kabbalah, pp. 234 ff. (6) the warnings he gives to Enkidu in Tablet XII; see n. 132 below.</page><page sequence="33">THE ASSYRIAN TREE OF LIFE 193 the realm of Nergal (Tablet I); the names of the gods governing the individual stages are encoded in the contents of the tablets, and they follow the order in which they are found in the Tree, read from bottom to top.121 Tablet II, which has no counterpart in the Tree, deals with spiritual awakening;122 Tablet III outlines the Path;123 and Tablet IX describes the final breakthrough to the source of supernal knowledge.124 The late version of the Epic consists of twelve tablets, the last of which is widely con- sidered an "inorganic appendage break[ing] the formal completeness of the Epic, which had come full circle between the survey of Uruk in Tablet I and the same survey at the end of Tablet XI."'125 In reality, nothing could be farther from the truth. Without the 121 The codes for the individual gods are as follows: Tablet I (Nergal): the strength, animal drive, and sexual potency of Gilgamesh; the strength and ani- mal characteristics of Enkidu, his life on the steppe (a synonym of the netherworld), his association with gazelles and the cattle god ?akkan, his instinctive be- havior and instantaneous fall to temptation by the whore (cf. n. 78), as well as the length of the coitus (6 days and 7 nights), which ended only barely be- fore it would have completed the number of Nergal (14); Tablet IV (Adad and Girru): the repeated dream oracles received by Gilgamesh; the thunderstorm, fire, lightning, and bull (Adad's sacred animal) seen in the dreams; the voice calling from heaven; the fear striking the travelers (see n. 79 ff.); Tablet V (Ninurta and Nabfi): the slaying of Humbaba, described in terms resembling Ninurta's battle with Anzfi and referred to as "triumph" in Tab- let II (see nn. 74 and 123); Tablet VI (I'tar): the word dumqu "beauty" in line 6, I'tar's love affairs recounted, etc. (see n. 73); Tablet VII (?ama'): the divine court of justice, the harsh judgment passed on Enkidu, Enkidu's appeal to ?ama' (see n. 72); Tablet VIII (Marduk): Gilgamesh's emotion and compassion for Enkidu, pervading the whole tablet; the magnificence of Enkidu's funeral (see n. 71); Tablet IX (Mummu): penetration into the Garden of Knowledge (see n. 124); Tablet X (Sin): the counsels of wisdom given to Gilgamesh, the role of the boat (cf. moon's barge), Utnapishtim's reflection and pondering (see n. 70). Note also the assonance of Siduri to Sin; Siduri, "the Igtar of Wisdom" (gurpu II 173), is here portrayed, through her veiling, as the daughter-in-law of Ea, the god of wisdom (see n. 99); Tablet XI (Ea); the divine secrets revealed to Gil- gamesh, the role of Ea in rescuing Utnapistim and granting him eternal life, the plant of life fetched from the Apsu (see n. 69); Tablet XII (Anu): reunion with Enkidu (see n. 57 above and n. 132 below). 122 The process described in the tablet reads like an extract from a modern Kabbalistic textbook: the appearance of a maggid (?amhat, "who leads Enkidu like a god," later Enkidu himself), the recognition of one's state (Enkidu weeping), and the yearning for a higher purpose in life (the journey to the Cedar For- est being a metaphor for spiritual growth; cf. Halevi, Wa of Kabbalah, pp. 64 ff.). 3 The goal of the journey is explicitly defined in this tablet (ii 18) as the destruction of evil, to be compared with the aspirant Kabbalist's struggle with the dark side of his ego (Halevi, Way of Kabbalah, pp. 153 ff.). In Assyrian glyptic, "Killing of Hum- baba" occurs as a theme supplementing the Tree Motif in the same way as the "Killing of Anzfi" or the "Killing of Asakku"; see, for example, Danthine, Palmier-dattier, figs. 92 (Humbaba), 78-86 (Anzfi), and 52 (Asakku). 124 Tablet IX corresponds to the Sefirah Daat (Knowledge), which in the psychological Tree repre- sents the gate to supernal knowledge, "the point where identity vanishes in the void of Cosmic consciousness before union with Keter" (Halevi, Tree of Life, p. 47; cf. ibid., pp. 42 and 158); passing through it is some- times compared to spiritual death (Ponc6, Kabbalah, p. 206). The revelation of supernal knowledge, on the other hand, is described "in Jewish classical texts as a tremendous eschatological event, when the sun will shine with an overwhelming light. The act of acquiring supernal knowledge involves a change in both the known and the knower; it is presented as a active event, or penetration" (Idel, Kabbalah, p. 228). Com- pare this with the penetration of Gilgamesh through the dark passage of the cosmic mountain guarded by the Scorpion man and woman and his emergence to the dazzling sunlight on the other side. The beautiful jewel garden he finds there is the Garden of Knowl- edge; it corresponds to the "garden of God" of Ezek. 28:12 ff. associated with wisdom, perfection, and blamelessness, and "adorned with gems of every kind: sardin and chrysolite and jade, topaz, carnelian and green jasper, sapphire, purple garnet and green fel- spar." On the association of the Sefirot with jewels and translucent colored glass vessels, see nn. 47 and 55 above, and see also Ponc6, Kabbalah, p. 103, and Idel, Kabbalah, pp. 104 ff.; for a Neo-Assyrian seal scene showing the scorpion man and woman as guardians of the Tree, see Danthine, Palmier-dattier, fig. 354.

That wisdom was not meant for the vulgus, and it is therefore hidden in the text.126 But the Epic is full of clues to help the serious reader to penetrate its secret. The refrain at the end of Tablet XI is one of these. Far from signaling the end of the Epic, it takes the reader back to square one, the Prologue, where he is advised to examine the struc- ture of "the walls of Uruk" until he finds the "gate to the secret," a lapis lazuli tablet locked inside a box." "The walls of Uruk" is a metaphor for Tablets I-XI,127 "the tablet box" is the surface story, and "the lapis lazuli tablet" is the secret structural framework of the Epic, the Tree diagram.'28 Once it is realized that the Epic is structured after the Tree, the paramount importance of Tablet XII becomes obvious, for it corresponds to the Crown of the Tree, Anu (Heaven), which would otherwise have no correspondence in the Epic. On the surface, there is no trace of Heaven in Tablet XII. On the contrary, it deals with death and the underworld, the word "heaven" (or the god Anu) not even being mentioned in it, and it seems to end on an utterly pessimistic and gloomy note. When considered in the light of the psychological Tree and the spiritual development outlined in the previous tablets, however, the message of the tablet changes character. We see Gilgamesh achieving reunion with his dead friend Enkidu, being able to converse with him and thus to acquire precious knowledge from him about life after death;129 and what is more, he achieves this reunion in exactly the same way as he did in Tablet IX, by pro- longed weeping and praying.130 In other words, the unique mystical experience re- counted in Tablets IX-XI, there presented as something totally new and unusual, has in 126 According to the Prologue, Gilgamesh brought back to Uruk the "ultimate sum of all wisdom," which is said to be revealed in the Epic (referred to by the term nara, "stela," in line 8). Note the empha- sis placed on the word hidden in line 5. This metaphorical significance of the "walls" (framing Tablets I-XI like brackets) is made clear by the parallelismus membrorum of lines 8-9, equating the building of the walls with the inscribing of the "stela." The meaning of the metaphor is clarified by the epithet supuru ("fold") attached to Uruk, else- where used to refer to the halo of the moon (see CAD, s.v., pp. 397 f.) and thus clearly connoting the idea of a return to the beginning (cf. nn. 89 and 103); compare the similar use of the Tree of Life motif as a framing device in the Bible, discussed in n. 107. The reference to the seven sages in lines 18-19 looks like a metaphor stressing the antiquity and solid philo- sophical background of the Epic. 128 Note the lapis lazuli foliage of the Tree of Knowledge in Tablet IX (see n. 124 above) and the unique description of the Tree of Life in CT 16 46:183 ff.: "A black kigkana tree grew up in Eridu, was created in a holy place; its sheen is pure lapis la- zuli, drawing from the Apsu..." (for the continua- tion, see Widengren, King and the Tree, pp. 6 f.). In addition, the conspicuous omission of the huluppu- tree theme from Tablet XII (see A. Shaffer, "Sumer- ian Sources of Tablet XII of the Epic of Gilgamesh" [Ph.D. diss., University of Pennsylvania, 1963], pp. 99 ff.) is certainly also meant to direct the read- er's attention to the Tree; see the discussion on pp. 195 ff. below, and note that the felling of the hu- luppu is referred to as a feat comparable to the con- quest of Anzfi in Cooper, Return of Ninurta, p. 147 (see n. 123 and Excursus 2 below). 129 Cf. Idel, Kabbalah, p. 94, quoting an eigh- teenth-century Kabbalist, Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer: "I performed an incantation for the ascent of the soul, known to you. And in that vision I saw.., .the souls of the living and of dead persons ... ascending from one world to the other through the column known to adepts in esoteric matters." See also ibid., p. 92, and cf. n. 57 above. On the death of Enkidu, attributed in Tablet XII to his ethical imperfections, see n. 132 below. 130 Cf. n. 120 and Idel, Kabbalah, p. 86, quoting Safrin's commentary to the Zohar: "By much weep- ing, like a well, and suffering I became worthy to be transformed into a 'flowing stream, a fountain of wis- dom'; no secret was revealed to me, nor a wondrous apprehension, but afterward I became like dust and wept before the Creator of the universe like a spring, lest I should be rejected from the light of his face, and for the sake of gaining apprehensions out of the source of wisdom." This passage illustrates the ratio- nale behind the weeping technique, associating it, in Mesopotamian terms, with the ocean of wisdom, Apsu, and thereby with Ea (cf. n. 69); note that it is explicitly Ea, not Enlil, or Sin, who finally grants Gilgamesh his rendezvous with Enkidu.</page><page sequence="35">THE ASSYRIAN TREE OF LIFE 195 Tablet XII become a firmly established technique by which similar experiences can be sought at will.131 In Jewish mysticism, such experiences are referred to as "ascent to heaven" or "enter- ing Paradise" and regarded as tremendous events reserved only to perfectly ethical, per- fectly stable men.132 The evolution of Gilgamesh into such a man is described in detail in Tablets I-VIII.'33 In the early (third century?) Jewish mystical text Hekhalot Rabbati, the very concept of mystical "ascent to heaven" is revealed to the Jewish community as a revolutionary "secret of the world."'34 There can be no doubt whatsoever that this very secret, revealing the way to Heaven, was the precious secret that Gilgamesh brought back from his journey to Utnapishtim. THE ETANA MYTH The Mesopotamian myth of Etana is well known for its central motif, a man's ascent to heaven on an eagle's back. It has thus been classified as an "adventure story" or early 131 On "weeping [and prayer] as a means of at- taining revelations and/or a disclosure of secrets-a practice that can be traced back through all the major stages of Jewish mysticism over a period of more than two millennia," see Idel, Kabbalah, pp. 75 ff. 132 Ibid., pp. 88 ff. and n. 124 above. The perilous nature of such experiences is constantly emphasized in Jewish mysticism, and the following Talmudic story (Epstein, Kabbalah, p. 3) is told to illustrate the point: Legend relates that each of the four [sages] entered Pardes, that is, embraced the mystical life. Rabbi Akiva, the oldest and best prepared was first to achieve superconscious states. However, on his "return" to waking consciousness, he warned the other three not to succumb to the illusions their minds would create along the way. "When you enter near the pure stones of marble, do not say, 'Water! Water!' for the Psalms tell us, 'He who speaks falsehoods will not be estab- lished before My Eyes'." The saintly Rabbi ben Azai "gazed and died," for his soul so longed for its source that it instantly shed the physical body upon entering the light. . .Only Rabbi Akiva, the man of perfect equilibrium, entered and left in peace. This story immediately recalls the warnings dealt by Gilgamesh to Enkidu in Tablet XII before the lat- ter's descent to the netherworld to retrieve the lost "hoop" and "driving stick." And that is not all. The passage has other important affinities with Jewish mysticism too. The "hoop" and "driving stick" clearly correspond to the "date stone" and "palm branch" of Jewish mysticism, where they symbolize the syzygy of masculine and feminine, but especially the mystical reunion with the Divine (see Scholem, Origins, pp. 173 ff.). Setting out to retrieve them, En- kidu was attempting to restore the broken unity with the Divine, the very purpose of the mystical union (see Idel, Kabbalah, pp. 62 ff.); he succumbed be- cause he, like the sages of the talmudic story, was not morally and ethically stable enough. Thus Enki- du's "descent" is paradigmatic for a failed mystical ascent. Note that in the Hekhalot literature the practice of ascension is paradoxically called "de- scension" (yeridah), an idiom that has not been satis- factorily explained (see Dan, Three Types, pp. 8 and 34 with n. 29). 133 The first phase in the process is the long jour- ney into one's self (Tablet IV), involving practice of religious duties and love of one's neighbor; the goal, the subjugation of the dark side of the ego (Tablet V), is reached with divine guidance (?ama') and human help (Enkidu). The purity of one's soul is put to test by major temptations (Tablet VI) and the severities of life (the death of Enkidu, Tablet VII); both tests have to be stood while still retaining a humble and com- passionate heart (Tablet VIII). The overall goal of the program seems to be a stepwise control over all psy- chic powers operative in the human soul, represented by the gods for whom the tablets are encoded (cf. the bird's nest metaphor of Moses Cordovero cited in Ponc6, Kabbalah, p. 123). This certainly looks like a clearly defined program of spiritual growth resem- bling the Kabbalistic and Neoplatonic strategies of conquering the "vegetable" and "animal" levels of the soul (cf. Halevi, Way of Kabbalah, pp. 117 ff., and Wallis, Neoplatonism, pp. 72 ff.). Its promi- nently theurgic character is well in line with the pro- fessional background (exorcist) of Sin-leqe-unninni, the author of the Late Version. 134 See Dan, Revelation, pp. 24 ff., and note espe- cially pp. 29 f.: The last paragraph of the above-quoted text defines, briefly, the rewards of the mystic. If the person successfully over- comes the earthly inclinations to sin, and observes the com- mandments as presented by Rabbi Nehunia, he will be rewarded by the opportunity to observe the beauty, the power, the magnificence and the secrets of the divine world... This passage does not leave any doubt in that the authors of this text realized completely the far-reaching his- torical and spiritual meaning of the[ir] mystical claim: [Rabbi Nehunia] is speaking about the most important, the most central subject that a man can know. This indeed is a gnosis of cosmic dimensions.</page><page sequence="36">196 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES TABLET Anu xII Union with God Eternal life Ea XI The Ultimate Wisdom Accepting God's Will "ISLE OF SAINTS" OUTSIDE ORDINARY Sin X Understanding man's fate and TIME AND SPACE the purpose of life Altered states Mummu IX Contact with the Divine Glimpse of Paradise Marduk VIII Practice of magnanimity, Enlil compassion and mercy REFIENNG AOUL Sania VII Exposure to trials and the severities of life s'tar (VI Withstanding major temptations Nab Ninurta V Victory over the ego LEARNING TO Adad Practice of honesty and virtues KNOW ONESELF Girru IV Love of one's neighbor Nusku Hope III Discovery of the Path Awakening of consciousness II Sorrow over one's condition Desire for change THE ANIMAL MAN Nergal Bestiality and animal instincts Sakkan Selfishness and Greed FIG. 12.-Via Mystica in the Gilgamesh Epic</page><page sequence="37">THE ASSYRIAN TREE OF LIFE 197 "science fiction" containing the first known account of "space travel."'35 The eagle-back ascent motif has been recognized to recur in Hellenistic, Jewish, and Islamic folk tales and legends and has also been connected with the Greek myth of Ganymede and the Alexander Romance.136 Much less attention has been paid to the tree inhabited by the eagle and the snake which figures so prominently in the second tablet of the myth.'37 Without going into unnecessary detail, it can be suggested here that the tree-eagle- serpent theme in Tablet II is an allegory for the fall of man and that the ascent to heaven described in Tablet III is to be understood as mystical ascent of the soul crowning an ar- duous program of spiritual restoration. Seen in this light, the myth becomes closely re- lated to the Gilgamesh Epic in substance, and in presenting Etana as the first man to achieve the ascent, it forcefully contributes to the notion of the Mesopotamian king as the "Perfect Man."'38 The tree of Tablet II is Etana himself, whose birth its sprouting marks. The eagle and the serpent are conflicting aspects of man's soul, the one capable of carrying him to heaven, the other pulling him down to sin and death.139 The deal struck by the eagle with the serpent marks the beginning of Etana's moral corruption as king. Ignoring the voice of his conscience, he becomes guilty of perfidy, greed, and murder;140 for this, he is punished. The serpent attacks the eagle, cuts off its wings, and throws it into a bot- tomless pit. This is an allegory for spiritual death; the same idea is expressed by the childlessness of Etana, to whom the narrative now returns.'41 135 See J. V. Kinnier Wilson, The Legend of Etana (Warminster, 1985), pp. 5 f.; J. Aro, "Anzu and Simurgh," Kramer Anniversary Volume: Studies in Honor of Samuel Noah Kramer, AOAT 25 (Neukirchen-Vluyn, 1976), pp. 27 f. 136 See S. Langdon, The Legend of Etana and the Eagle (Paris, 1932), pp. 3 f.; Aro, "Anzu and Si- murgh," p. 26; Dalley, Myths, p. 189. In addition, one may compare the story of Abu Muhammad al- Kaslan in the Arabian Nights, the Greek myth of Daidalos and Ikaros, and, above all, the Indian mythical bird Garuda as spiritual vehicle of the yogis (see below). 137 The recurrence of this theme in the Sumerian myth of Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld (see n. 128) has, of course, been noted, but the mean- ing of the theme in either myth has not been dis- cussed at all. 138 Cf. nn. 34 and 58. 139 In Christian symbolism, "The eagle holding a serpent in its talons or beak represents the triumph of Christ over the 'dark forces' of the world (see Ser- pent)" (Baldock, Elements, p. 92). In Indian mysti- cism, the bird Garuda likewise achieves its ascent to heaven in spite of the serpents coiling around its head, wings, and feet (see the illustration in Rawson, Tantra, pl. 67). In the Etana myth, the eagle plays two roles. At first, it is "an evil eagle, the criminal AnzQ (var.: criminal and sinner), who wronged his comrade"; as such, it parallels the eagle inhabiting the huluppu tree in the Sumerian Gilgamesh epic, which is ex- plicitly called Anzf. Later, however, having suffered and been rescued by Etana, it carries the latter to heaven. The evil aspect of the bird corresponds to the natural state of man's soul, which, despite its divine origin, is contaminated with sin (see Enima elig VI 1-33 and Lambert and Millard, Atra-hasis, p. 59: 208 ff.; cf. Ponc6, Kabbalah, pp. 61 f. and 82 f.). The second aspect of the bird corresponds to the soul of a "purified" man (see below). The "tree" itself is marked as sinful by its species (the poplar), associated with Nergal; see CAD s.v. sarbu, pp. 109 f., and note BEl-sarbe "Lord of the Poplar" = Nergal, CT 25 37:16. This accords with Ebeling, Handerhebung, p. 114:9, which explicitly states that mankind is "entrusted to Nergal," that is, under the power of sin. 140 Etana's voice of conscience is the "small, es- pecially wise fledgling" of II 45 and 97. Note that the theme of bird's nest with the young (taken over from the Sumerian Lugalbanda epic; see Aro, "Anzu and Simurgh," pp. 25 and 28) also plays a role in Kab- balah, where it is explicitly associated with self- discipline and wisdom; see Ponc6, Kabbalah, pp. 123 f., and Scholem, Origins, p. 134. 141 Etana's barren wife is the feminine, spiritual half of his soul, corresponding to the Shekhinah (cf. Ponc6, Kabbalah, pp. 208 f.); the desired "son" is Etana's "fruit," the deeds by which he will be judged. For a similar allegory, see Matt. 21:19-25 (Jesus cursing the fruitless fig tree).</page><page sequence="38">198 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Etana's realization of his condition is the beginning of his salvation; from now on, he appears as a person referred to by his own name. Admitting his guilt and shame, he prays for a "plant of birth" (that is, a chance for spiritual rebirth) and is guided to the path that will take him there.142 The path leads him to the mountain where he finds the eagle lying in the pit with its wings cut, a metaphor for the imprisonment of the soul in the bonds of the material world. Complying with the wish of the eagle, his better self, he starts feeding it and teaching it to fly again, an allegory for spiritual training and self-discipline. It takes eight months to attempt the first ascent to heaven, which fails because Etana himself is not ready for it.143 The second ascent, better prepared, is successful and takes Etana into a celestial palace where he, having passed through several gates, finds a beautiful girl sitting on a throne guarded by lions. All this is so reminiscent of the terminology and imagery relating to the ascent of the soul in Jewish mysticism that mere coincidence can be excluded. The several heavens and heavenly palaces through which Etana passes are commonplace in the Hekhalot texts and later mystical literature.144 The girl seen by Etana is the Shekhinah, the Pres- ence or Beauty of God.145 Etana's fall from the heavens has ample parallels in Kabbalis- tic literature, where the ascent is considered a dangerous practice and the return to a normal state referred to as being "thrown down like a stone."'146 142 The spiritual meaning of the prayer (concealed under the "plant of birth" metaphor) is made clear by the preceding prayer of the eagle (II 121-23): "Am I to die in the pit? Who realizes that it is your punish- ment that I bear? Save my life, so that I may broadcast you fame for eternity!" In the late Turkish version of the myth, which survives in the folk-tale collection Billur Ko6k (Aro, "Anzu and Simurgh," p. 28), the bird rescues the hero from the netherworld. 143 Note that the Old Babylonian version (Tablet I/E 8) at this point states that Etana wished to ascend to heaven "to disclose concealed things." Compare this with nn. 57 and 130 above, and note also Idel, Kabbalah, p. 91: "[He] asked questions, and his soul ascended to heaven in order to seek [answers to] his doubts." The eagle's wings are a well-known symbol for transcendental ascent to heaven. See, for example, Rawson, Tantra, p. 27: "The achievement of the as- cent may be symbolized by a great bird, equated with the mystical Persian Simurgh. This is sometimes shown in art as carrying a pair of divine lovers"; and Baldock, Elements, p. 92: "Eagle: A symbol of the As- cension, and of Christ. The eagle was reputed to be able to look directly into the sun, without diverting its gaze. It trained its young to do likewise, rejecting those who failed. In this respect it represents Christ who raises his followers, through faith, to contemplate God, the source of Divine Light." This symbolism cer- tainly goes back to Mesopotamia, where the eagle (i.e., Anzfi) was the bird of Ninurta, Nabji, and Zababa (see Excursus 2 and Seidl, RIA, vol. 3, pp. 487f and 488b; and also STT 341:7: "The vulture is the bird of Ninurta; its cry is: 'Hero [... ] killed AnzQ!'," and KAR 125:6: "the vulture is the bird of Nabf; [its cry is]: 'Hero, hero Ninurta [killed AnzQ]!"'). Note that the Christian symbolism of the cock ("vigilance and watchfulness," Baldock, Elements, p. 88) likewise goes back to Mesopotamia, where the cock is the bird of Nusku (see CAD and AHw. s.vv. tarlugallu, kub- s~nu, and hasibaru, and cf. n. 80 above). 144 For the Hekhalot texts, see Scholem, Origins, pp. 19 ff.; Dan, Three Types, pp. 5 ff., and idem, Rev- elation, pp. 14 ff.; the technical term used in these texts for the heavenly palaces, hekhalot, is a loan from Akkadian ekallu (pl. ekalliiti), "palace." For later mysticism, see, for example, Idel, Kabbalah, p. 94, continuing the story of Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer already cited in n. 129 above: And I asked my teacher and master that he come with me, and it is a great danger to go and ascend to the supernal worlds, whence I have never ascended since I acquired awareness, and these were mighty ascents. So I ascended de- gree after degree, until I entered the palace of the Messiah. 145 See n. 84 above. Cf. the following vision of R. Isaac Yehudah Yehiel Safrin cited in Idel, Kabbalah, p. 83: And I wept many times before the Lord of the world, out of the depth of the heart, for the suffering of the Shekhinah. And through my suffering and weeping, I fainted and I fell asleep for a while, and I saw a vision of light, splendor and great brightness, in the image of a young woman adorned with twenty-four ornaments. .. . And she said: "Be strong, my son." 146 See Idel, Kabbalah, p. 95. Incidentally, since the fall effectively marks the end of the "ascent," Tablet III is likely to represent the end of the myth;</page><page sequence="39">THE ASSYRIAN TREE OF LIFE 199 The heavenward ascent of Etana is already attested on seals from the Akkadian period (ca. 2300 B.C.)147 and thus antedates the earliest Hekhalot texts by more than two and a half millennia, and the mystical experiences of nineteenth-century Kabbalists by more than four thousand years.148 In saying this, I do not want to stress the antiquity of the "ascent" phenomenon in Mesopotamia. The point I wish to make is that, against all ap- pearances, Mesopotamian religion and philosophy are not dead but still very much alive in Jewish, Christian, and Oriental mysticism and philosophies. The Tree diagram pro- vides the key which makes it possible to bridge these different traditions and to start re- covering the forgotten summa sapientia of our cultural ancestors. there is no need to assume the existence of further tablets (thus Kinnier Wilson, Etana, p. 2; cf. Dalley, Myths, p. 189). 147 See R. Boehmer, Die Entwicklung der Gyptik wiahrend der Akkad-Zeit (Berlin, 1965), pp. 123, 190, and figs. 168, 192, and 693-703; all examples are "Akkadisch III," i.e., Naram-Sin or later. The dogs barking at the ascending pair symbolize envy and other vices, while the earthly possessions (cattle, jugs of beer, butter, cheese, etc.) shown on these seals symbolize material values left behind by Etana. See n. 78 on the association of material values with Ner- gal, and note that in the Gilgamesh Epic, Utnapishtim is told to "leave the riches" and "hate possessions" (muSlir mere? makkiTra zirma) before embarking on the Ark. This parallel indicates that the deluge story in Gilgamesh too, as in the Bible, is an allegory for the end of carnal men, eternal life being the share of morally and ethically perfect, saintly men only. Note, in this context, the suffering of the Goddess at the fate of her creatures (Tablet XI 116-126), which provides a perfect parallel for the suffering of the Shekhinah because of the sins of the world (see n. 145 above). 148 For the date of the earliest Hekhalot texts (sec- ond through fourth centuries A.D.), see Scholem, Ori- gins, p. 20, and Dan, Three Types, p. 16. The vision of Rabbi Isaac cited above (see n. 145) dates to 1845.</page><page sequence="40">200 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES APPENDIX A.

(MSL 14, p. 285). Its origin is hitherto unexplained, but it is very likely derived from the relative length of time of daylight at the winter solstice (associated with Ea), just as the mystic number of the moon was derived from the ideal length of the month; the required 2 : 3 ratio between the maximum variation of daylight is attested in both I.NAM GI?.HUR (see B. L. van der Waerden, Die Anfdinge der Astronomie, Erwachende Wissenschaft, vol. 2 [Groningen, 1965], pp. 86 f., and Livingstone, Mystical Works, p. 25: 26 f.) and the late second- millennium astronomical work Mul Apin (H. Hunger and D. Pingree, MUL.APIN: An Astronomical Compendium in Cuneiform, AfO Beiheft 24 (Horn, 1988), p. 95). Taking 1 (= 60) as the length of the longest day (IV 15) and stating the length of day and night at the other turning points in sexagesimal fractions of this value, one obtains the follow- ing scheme for the year ("Path" refers to the sun's position on the horizon, expressed in terms of "paths" assigned to Anu, Enlil, and Ea; "total" is the length of the 24-hour day expressed sexagesimally; "notes" refers to Hunger and Pingree, MUL.APIN, pp. 88 ff.): Month Path Day Night Total Notes 1 15 Anu 50 50 1,40 Spring, "Winds" IV 15 Enlil 1 40 1,40 Summer, "Heat" VII 15 Anu 50 50 1,40 Fall, "Winds" X 15 Ea 40 60 1,40 Winter, "Cold" This scheme perfectly explains the numbers of Ea, but the numbers of Anu (60) and Enlil (50) are not in the expected order. One is also surprised to note that the order of the "paths" does not follow the otherwise standard order Anu-Enlil-Ea; that Enlil, Sum- erian "Lord Wind," is not associated with "winds"; and that the sky-god Anu is not as- sociated with the summer solstice (see n. 65 above). All these difficulties disappear if the order of the paths is adjusted as follows: Month Path Day Night Total Notes 1 15 Enlil 50 50 1,40 Spring, "Winds" IV 15 Anu 1 40 1,40 Summer, "Heat" VII 15 Enlil 50 50 1,40 Fall, "Winds" X 15 Ea 40 60 1,40 Winter, "Cold" This emendation presupposes that the compiler of Mul Apin had reversed the order of the paths of Anu and Enlil in an attempt to mitigate the effect of the precession of the equinoxes, which had shifted constellations traditionally associated with Anu and Enlil to the wrong paths. Indeed, earlier star lists differ considerably from Mul Apin in this re- spect: out of the twelve constellations assigned to the Path of Anu in Astrolabe B (mid- second millennium?), six appear in the Path of Enlil in Mul Apin and vice versa; in the Path of Ea there are fewer differences (see van der Waerden, Anfdinge der Astronomie, p. 70, and Pingree, in Eniema Anu Enlil, Tablets 50-51, BPO 2 [Malibu, 1981], p. 7 and tables 3 and 4). Thus the emendation seems perfectly justified. The pronouncedly</page><page sequence="44">204 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Sumerian character of the posited scheme points to the third millennium B.C., which would date the emergence of the mystic numbers of Anu, Enlil, and Ea to Sumerian or early Old Babylonian times. This agrees with the fact that 40 (= 40/60) as the number of Ea is already attested in the Old Babylonian period (in the name Su-ur-su-na-bu = Ur- sinabi, Gilg. M iv 7 ff.). It is worth pointing out that the reconstructed scheme also agrees with the Kabbalistic scheme of the "three worlds" briefly discussed in n. 55. Compare Ponc6, Kabbalah, pp. 41 f., citing Sefer Yezirah: "'The heavens were created out of the substance of Fire [= Anu];' the earth from Water [= Ea], and the Air from the Spirit [= Enlil] which mediates between the two'. In addition to being symbolic of the elements, the three mothers [= the letters Aleph, Mem, and Shin, functioning as instruments of creation] also define the temporal year: the element fire [= Anu] corresponds with the summer season; the element water [= Ea] corresponds with the winter season, and the element air [= Enlil] corresponds with the seasons of spring and autumn." EXCURSUS 2: THE EXALTATION OF THE VANQUISHER OF SIN In a prayer to Marduk (KAR 25 ii 6 f.), both Nabui and Ninurta are presented as powers of Marduk, the former as his "victory" (l9u^tu), the latter as his "prowess" (as'aridutu), and it is certainly not by accident that in SAA 3 no. 2:15 Marduk himself is called "the smiter of the skull of Anzfi." Note Ninurta's epithets "weapon" and "arrow" in Tallqvist, Gdtterepitheta, p. 424; in SAA 3 no. 37:11-15 it is by Marduk's "arrows" that Anzfi and Asakku are vanquished. Anzfi and Asakku, on the other hand, personified evil and sin: in the Etana myth, Anzfi alternates with anzillu, "abomination, sin" (see n. 139 above and CAD A/2 s.v. anzillu, pp. 153 f.). Thus Ninurta and Nabui basically represent the power to resist and prevail over evil and sin, recalling the roles of the archangel Michael in Judaism, Christ in Christianity, or Mithra in Mithraism (see n. 103 below). The con- cept of Ninurta/Nabfi as "God's weapon" is first attested in the Middle Assyrian royal name Ninurta-tukul-A''ur (Saporetti, Onomastica, p. 354, twelfth century B.C.). For his triumph over Anzfi, Ninurta/Nabfi obtains the "Stylus" and the "Tablet of Fates" (see Pomponio, Naba, p. 182; Finkel, Studies Sachs, p. 149:22; Hru'ka, Anzu, p. 168:21; W. Mayer, "Ein Hymnus auf Ninurta als Helfer in der Not," Or. n.s. 61 [1992]: 29 v 9; for Nabfi as the Recorder of Sins, see Finkel, "The Dream of Kurigalzu and the Tablet of Sins," Anatolian Studies 33 (1983): 75-80 and ABL 545:7 ff.). His looks are changed; his eyes flame like fire, his [garments] glow like snow (E. Ebeling, "Mittelassyrische Rezepte zur Herstellung von wohlriechenden Salben (Taf. 1-49)," Or. n.s. 17 [1948]: pl. 26, r. 4 f.); casting numinous splendor and silence over god and man, he returns in his triumphal chariot to his father, who rejoices in his son, blesses him, and magnifies his kingship (ibid., r. 9 ff.; SAA 3 no. 37:24 ff.; Cooper, The Return of Ninurta, pp. 73 ff.; Hru'ka, Anzu, p. 174). In a Neo-Assyrian hymn glorifying Ninurta, his body is described as encompassing the whole universe, with different gods equated with his limbs, his face being the sun, etc. (see KAR 102, translated in A. Falk- enstein and W. von Soden, Sumerische und akkadische Hymnen und Gebete [Zurich, 1953], pp. 258 f.); cf. the Jewish mystical text Shiur Qomah from the second century 1 My explanations appear within brackets.</page><page sequence="45">THE ASSYRIAN TREE OF LIFE 205 A.D., on which see Scholem, Origins, pp. 21 ff., and Dan, Three Types, pp. 13 ff. (In line with his magnification, Nabfi's name could occasionally be spelled with the vertical wedge, "One and Sixty" = Alpha and Omega; see CT 53 151:5 and cf. n. 89 above.) All this recalls the appearance of God on his Throne-Chariot of Glory in Ezekiel 1:26 ff. and Daniel 7:9 ff., that of resurrected and glorified Christ in the Revelation of John (1:14 ff.), as well as the role of Michael as the keeper of the celestial keys and "the ar- chon on the right side of God" (Scholem, Origins, p. 147). It should be stressed that just as Christ and the Father are one, so is triumphant Ninurta/Nabf one with his Father: both Marduk and Enlil are included among Ninurta's limbs in KAR 102. He is repeatedly addressed as B6l in the text, an appellative otherwise reserved to Marduk/Enlil, and, as observed by Lambert, Ninurta's triumphal chariot is identical with what is called Mar- duk's Chariot in the B6hl festschrift, pp. 276 ff. (see n. 65 above). Against this back- ground, it is not accidental that the throne of God in Ezek. 1 and Dan. 7 is known as the Chariot in Jewish tradition; the aspect of God on it is that of God triumphing over evil and sin (cf. Ezek. 7:1 ff., 11:14 ff.; Dan. 7: 11 ff.; Rev. 7:10 and 8:6 ff.). According to the doctrine of the Tree, the power to combat evil also resided in man; the man who succeeded in conquering sin would become the Son of God himself and eventually triumph in Heaven. In Jewish mystical tradition, the patriarch Enoch (Gen. 5:23 f.) was, because of his piety, transformed in the heavens into a great divine power, second only to God, called Metatron, an angel with flesh of fire, eyelashes of lightning and eyes of flaming torches. "After overcoming the objection of the archangels to in- clude Enoch among them, God gradually gave Enoch-Metatron divine powers of knowl- edge, and a body, a garment, and a chariot of fire. Step by step, Enoch loses all his human attributes, grows enormous wings, has one hundred eyes, and even acquires the divine name itself" (Dan, Three Types, pp. 15 f., paraphrasing Sefer Hekhalot, probably written in Babylonia in the fifth century A.D. or later). The figure of Enoch/Metatron is based on Mesopotamian traditions about Adapa, the antediluvian sage who was taken to heaven after he had "broken the wings of the south wind," a metaphor corresponding to the slaying of Anzu (cf. S. A. Picchioni, II po- emetto di Adapa [Budapest, 1981], pp. 74 f.); note Adapa's common appellative Uanna "storm of Anu" and his representation as a winged eagle-headed genie in Neo-Assyrian sculpture (see nn. 24 and 31 above). The divine power Anafiel, responsible for bringing Enoch into the heavens, "who seems to have been a prototype of Metatron himself and connected with demiurgic elements" (Dan, Three Types, pp. 15 f.), corresponds to Ada- pa's patron, the god Ea. It is noteworthy in this context that the Kabbalistic Book of True Unity explains Anafiel as the supreme luminary "whose power is ramified in seven lights that 'stand before the place of the unity as a burning fire' (see Scholem, Origins, p. 346). This agrees perfectly with Ea's appellative "the Great Light of Apsu" (n. 69) and his position in the diagram before Sefirot 3 to 9, associated with the seven classical planets (see n. 68). EXCURSUS 3: THE NAME OF AUR Applying the technique used in the exegesis of the fifty names of Marduk in Eniema elis' (see n. 66 and J. Bott6ro, "Les Noms de Marduk, l'6criture et la 'logique' en M6so- potamie ancienne," in M. deJong Ellis, ed., Essays on the Ancient Near East in Memory</page><page sequence="46">206 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES of Jacob Joel Finkelstein [Hamden, Conn., 1977], pp. 5 ff.), the principal spellings of AS'ur's name can be interpreted as follows: 1. A9 A9 iften "The One" DILI edu "The Only One" piriftu "Mystery" Ri gitmalu "The Perfect One" 2. dA? DINGIR A9 ilu iften "God is One" DINGIR DILI ilu edu "The Only God" il piristi "The Hidden God" 3. as'-sur A? ?UR iKten sirhu "A Single Flash" (see n. 45) "The First Flash" (see n. 55) 4. da-*ur A ?UR me S.arriti "Flashing Water" (see n. 63) "Flowing Waters" (see n. 55) 5. AN."AR AN ?AR kissat samA "Totality of Heaven" (see n. 94) DINGIR ?AR kissat ilani "Totality of Gods" il kiswati "Universal God" ilu ma'ad "God is Many" It is true that no Assyrian text actually giving the above analysis is extant. But if the names of such gods as Marduk, Zarpanitu (Lieberman, "A Mesopotamian Background," pp. 179 f.), Zababa (Lambert, "A Late Babylonian Copy of an Expository Text," JNES 48 [1989]: 217), and even ?ulak (Hunger, Uruk, no. 47:4 f.) could be subjected to mys- tical exegesis, one can be sure that the name of the highest god of the pantheon consti- tuted no exception. The exegesis of the Tetragrammaton (YHWH) plays a paramount role in Kabbalah, and "the secret knowledge of the great name" was considered in early Kabbalah tantamount to the highest wisdom and even a key to the attainment of superior divine powers (see Ponc6, Kabbalah, pp. 174 ff.; Idel, Kabbalah, p. 236; Dan, Three Types, pp. 18 ff.). The highly esoteric nature of such knowledge accounts for the total lack of extant speculations concerning ASur's name. For numerous examples of a similar exegesis of Mesopotamian temple names (ex- tracting hidden significance from the names by playing with the readings of their com- ponent logograms), see A. R. George, Babylonian Topographical Texts, Orientalia Lovanensia Analecta 40 (Louvain, 1992), passim. The Mesopotamian scholars' herme- neutical attitude to their (predominantly logographically spelled) canon has a striking parallel in the Kabbalistic attitude to the unvocalized text of the Bible, illustrated by the following statement in Rabbi Bahya ben Asher's thirteenth-century Commentary on the Pentateuch, quoted by Idel, Kabbalah, p. 214: "The Scroll of the Torah is [written] without vowels, in order to enable man to interpret it however he wishes ... .When it is vocalized it has but one single significance; but without vowels man may interpret it [extrapolating from it] several [different] things, many, marvellous and sublime .... The relationship between vocalization and consonants is like that between, respectively, soul, or form, and matter." Cf. also Idel, Kabbalah, p. 227, citing the Zohar: "The Torah . . . is dressed in four, or perhaps even five, levels of meaning that must be pene- trated by the perfect student of the Torah in order to reach its ultimate layer, the Kabbal- istic meaning."</page><page sequence="47">THE ASSYRIAN TREE OF LIFE 207 Most of the logographic values included in the above analysis are so common that the meanings "hidden" in the spellings must have been obvious to almost any Assyrian scribe (regarding nos. 1-3, note that the sign A? did not have the phonetic value as' in Assyrian orthography, so the spellings concerned certainly were inherently logographic from the beginning). Incessant meditation on the name by generations of scholars and mystics must have produced an extensive, much more sophisticated oral lore relating to the name. A reconstruction of this lore cannot be attempted here, but two observations seem worth noting. The graphic shape of the name should have attracted much attention, considering the role that syllables and numbers played in Assyrian cosmogonic speculations (see nn. 65 and 115-18); A and ?UR were the first signs of the Assyrian syllabary (see MSL 3, pp. 5, 15, and 96), and the horizontal wedge A? not only represented the basic element of writ- ing but also the basic number, equivalent to DI (see n. 89 above). Now, if one considers the spelling as'-s'ur as consisting of A9 ("One") and ?UR ("to flash, flow; to emanate"), one obtains a mantra capturing the basic symbolism of the Tree in two syllables: "[God] is One [in His Multiple] Emanation." For the Tetragrammaton as a mantra, see Ponc6, Kabbalah, pp. 181 ff. Secondly, if one writes the elements of the word as'-s'ur vertically in their "order of emanation" (from above to below), one obtains a figure closely resembling the Kabbal- istic "Tetragrammaton as Man" (see Ponc6, Kabbalah, p. 179): Anu (1) Keter Hokhmah Ea (60) Sin (3) Binah Gods nos.4-9 Sefirot nos. 4-9 Malkhut FIG. 11.-a. The "Emanation" of al-lur; b. The tetragrammaton as man Not only is this figure produced in the same way as the Kabbalistic one (this, too, be- ing obtained by writing the letters YHWH from above to below), but the specific sym- bolism of the Tetragrammaton works in it too: the topmost wedges (1 to 60) stand for Anu and Ea, just as the tittle and the body of Y stand for Keter and Hokhmah (see nn. 70, 90, and 108); the group of three wedges (3) stands for Sin, just as H stands for Bi- nah (see n. 88 above); and the lowermost wedge stands for the entire "Lower Face" (cf. n. 52 above), just as W stands for the Sefirot 4 to 9. The Sefirah of Malkhut (the last let- ter of the Tetragrammaton) has no counterpart in the scheme; see n. 85 above. If all this is merely a coincidence; the coincidence certainly is a most striking one.</page><page sequence="48">208 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES In conclusion, it may be pointed out that the name ASSur also provides an "etymol- ogy" for the name of the God of Kabbalah, En Sof. Applying the principle of notarikon (n. 66) to the alphabetic spelling of A'sur, one obtains Ds(w)r = 9yn swp wr, "En Sof Or." En Sof Or would thus represent a Jewish reinterpretation of the mantra as'-s'ur just dis- cussed, expressing the idea of transcendent God in his essential nature, "Endless Light" (cf. n. 94); correspondingly, En Sof would be a reinterpretation of the "holy syllable" as' referring to the Unmanifest God. Compare the Kabbalistic interpretation of "Amen" (9mn) as l mlk n'mn, "God, the faithful king" (Ponc6, Kabbalah, p. 172, an allusion to Deut. 7:9), and the hidden meanings derived by notarikon from the Persian loanword Pardes "garden, paradise" (a metaphor for mystical life): "Jewish sages warn all but the perfectly stable, perfectly ethical man away from this place. The letters of the Hebrew word Pardes, they say, contain the clue to the secret contained there: P represents Peshat, the simple, exterior meaning of the Torah; R stands for Remez, the homiletical meaning; D is Drush, the allegorical meaning; and S is Sod, its secret, or innermost, meaning" (Epstein, Kabbalah, p. 3; note, in this context, the title of Moses de Cordovero's famous sixteenth-century exposition of Kabbalah, Pardes Rimmonim, "The Pomegranate Garden," and cf. n. 21 above). For the pronunciation and alphabetical spellings of AS'ur in the first millennium B.C. and first millennium A.D., see my articles, "A Letter from ?amaS-Sumu-ukin to Esarhad- don," Iraq 34 (1972): 29, n. 40, and "The Alleged Middle/Neo-Assyrian Irregular Verb *nass and the Assyrian Sound Change S&gt;s," Assur 1/1 (1974): 1 ff.; R.

Frye, "Assyria and Syria: Synonyms," JNES 51 (1992): 281-85. Note especially the Greek spelling Assiron (long o) in Damascius (Quaestiones de primis principiis, chap. 125 (ed. Kopp, p. 384), which proves that the tradition of Eniima elis' known to this sixth-century Neoplatonist took ASSur as the father of Anu and fully accepted the "Assyrian" equation AN.?AR = ASSur, introduced as early as in the fourteenth century B.C. (see n. 106 above).</page></plain_text>
