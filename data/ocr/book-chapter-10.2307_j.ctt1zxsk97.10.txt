<plain_text> <page sequence="1">  Power, Orthodoxy, and Salvation in  Classical Islamic Theology1 Christian Lange 1 The Study of Classical Islamic Theology at the Dawn of the  Twenty-first Century To attempt, as I do in the pages that follow, a sketch of the state-of-the-art in  the academic study of classical Islamic theology at the dawn of the twenty- f irst century is a daunting task. Although in Western contexts, it remains  the conclave of a rather small number of researchers, the f ield has grown to  remarkable proportions. Specialists are armed to the teeth with technical  and historical particulars. Therefore any survey, including the present one,  must by def inition be selective and incomplete. However, I believe that if  scholars of Islam want to overcome what has recently been characterised as  their “ghettoized” position within the broader f ield of the study of religion  (Elias 2010a, 2), they ought to welcome meta-critical ref lections on the  genealogy and current configuration of the discipline within which they  operate. It is in this spirit that I offer the following thoughts, building upon  my own recent readings in scholarship on classical Islamic theology. At the beginning, a brief reflection on the terms of the debate. In the  area of Islamic theology, the use of the term “classical” tends to delegitimise  theological activity in what Marshal Hodgson called “the Later Middle  Period” of Islamic history (1258 to ca. 1500), as well as theological develop- ments that occurred during the time of the so-called “gunpowder empires”  of the Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals. Before these centuries of intense  theological activity are better understood and thus a bridge has been built  between the early centuries and modern times, synthetic def initions of  what counts as “classical” (i.e. def initive) theology in Islam ought best be  avoided. One should note, however, that scholars of Islamic theology are  beginning to f ill the gaps in our knowledge about the intellectual history  of these later centuries. 1 The author wishes to acknowledge the support of the European Research Council (Project  no. 263308: “The Here and the Hereafter in Islamic Traditions”) during the research for and  writing of this chapter. </page> <page sequence="2"> 136 ChrISTIan lange  The very notion of “Islamic theology” is fraught with diff iculties, and we  may legitimately ask whether the signifier “theology” as we commonly apply  it to the Islamic tradition adequately captures its signif ied. The f irst axe  that one has to grind in this regard is that scholarship on Islamic theology  has traditionally focused on, and continues to emphasise, the study of the  internal dynamics and development of Islamic theological doctrines. In fact,  it may be averred that much of this scholarship is marked by an aff inity to  the “history of ideas” approach connected with the name of the American  philosopher Arthur Lovejoy. Lovejoy, who is commonly seen as the founder  of this school of thought, proposed to study “unit-ideas” – these correspond,  roughly, to overarching “concepts,” or “themes” of human thought – that  is, how they develop over time and enter into changing relationships with  other “unit-ideas” (Lovejoy 1965 [1936], 3-23). His detractors argue that Lovejoy treats these “unit-ideas” as if they oper- ate outside of the minds of the people who debate them, as if they exist in  a parallel, eternal and unadulterated universe. In Lovejoy’s perspective,  as Quentin Skinner puts it, “ideas get up to do battle on their own behalf”  (Skinner 2002, 62). However, as Skinner emphasises, “we’re not dealing with  ‘perennial’ debates but with particularistic, ideological speech-acts” (83-84).  The “history of ideas” approach, in other words, downplays the importance  of context, it fails to grasp what ideas mean for actual people in real-life  situations. “The only history of ideas to be written,” writes Skinner, “are  histories of their uses in argument” (86). The Hegelian-Marxian controversy that underlies the debate between  Lovejoy and Skinner continues to pose a challenge for students of classical  Islamic theology until today. Recent decades have witnessed vigorous efforts  to reconceptualise the academic study of religion by critically examining its  alleged “Protestant bias,” that is, by freeing it from its nostalgic insistence on  the primacy of mind over body, ideal essences over actual things, text over  context, and individual inwards religiosity over communal outwards forms  of the religious life (McCutcheon 1997; Molendijk and Pels 1998; Hart 1999).  Robert Orsi has claimed that the lingering scholarly commitment to such  “Protestant” ideas about what constitutes “true” or “good” religion results in  a situation where “all the complex dynamism of religion is stripped away, its  boundary-blurring and border-crossing propensities eliminated” (Orsi 1998,  209-210). If students and scholars of Islam want to remain in conversation  with colleagues studying other religious traditions, they are well advised  to take the call for a less text-immanent and more deeply contextualised  reading of the classical sources seriously. This is not to deny the importance  of textual studies, but rather to stress the need for analysis that proceeds  </page> <page sequence="3"> Power, orThodoxy, and SalvaTIon In ClaSSICal ISlamIC Theology 137 in a text-cum-context mode, and that, in addition, is willing to question  assumptions about what kind of texts deserve to be studied. It would be unfair, however, to accuse the Western study of Islamic  theology as a whole of detached idealism. Calls for more contextualised  approaches have been both plentiful and vigorous. Mohamed Arkoun, for  example, has repeatedly pointed out that there is no pure unadulterated  intellectual history in Islam. Rather, as Arkoun maintains, writers are  always the product of their age (Arkoun 1970, 59). The divine is always  communicated through the lens of a specific spatial-temporal environment:  “There is no way to f ind the absolute outside the social, political condition of  human beings and the medium of language” (Arkoun 1988, 81). As far as the  study of classical Islamic theology is concerned, however, there may still be  some lessons to be learned from colleagues who write about contemporary  Islamic theology, and who often do so with a keen eye for the political and  social embeddedness of theological expressions. The lack of contextualisation is not the only thing that strikes one as  problematic with regard to what continues to be the dominant paradigm  in the study of Islamic theology. The f ield on the whole privileges a par- ticular conception of which ideas are worthy of study, namely, those ideas  that fall under the rubric of kalām. However, in order for us to develop  an understanding of the full gamut of theological expressions in Islam, I  believe we must not only give attention to systematic and formalist reason- ing about God and His relation to creation, the traditional province of  kalām, but include areas such as religious mythology, apocalypticism, and  eschatological thought, in short, the religious imagination in Islam. The  Islamic tradition is often seen as impoverished when it comes to mythology  or the religious imagination. However, it is diff icult to decide whether this  assessment has resulted from the partial blindness of Western observers  or from any actual lack of such f ields of religious expression in Islamic  traditions. Islamic theology, in my view, is far richer than the traditional  focus on kalām allows us to see. How broadly, then, should we conceive the term “Islamic theology”?  When one hears Islam debated in public one sometimes gets the impression  that Islamic theology is simply everything in Islam that has to do with God,  including, notably, the area of shariʿa law. Never mind that scholars continue  to dispute whether shariʿa is better understood as a “divine law” or a “jurists’  law” resulting from the human endeavour, known as fiqh, to interpret and  develop a limited set of basic legal norms. Fear of Muslim “theocracies,” as  it turns out, is really a fear of “f iqhocracy,” a fear that drowns out the crucial  distinction between divine perfection and human fallibility in interpreting  </page> <page sequence="4"> 138 ChrISTIan lange  the divine. The broad meaning of “Islamic theology” that underlies such  perceptions is arguably far too vague to be of much use. A more promising way of approaching a def inition is to look at the  terminology used by classical Muslim thinkers themselves. Immediately,  this serves to demonstrate some of the limitations of the kalām-centred ap- proach. The literal meaning of ʿ ilm al-kalām is not “theology” but “knowledge  of rational-dialectic speech.” Kalām might be described as speculative,  argumentative discourse about God and His relationship to the universe  from the moment of its creation to the end of time. Influenced as it was by  Hellenistic thought, in particular logic, kalām suffered a number of debilitat- ing blows during its history. The f irst was dealt by the rise of Ashʿarism  in the tenth century, the school of thought that came to dominate kalām  but which in fact did much to circumscribe and limit its scope; the second  by Sunni-Jamaʿi traditionalism, which rejected kalām altogether, instead  emphasising the need to rely on revealed rather than speculative knowledge.  In consequence, kalām never came to occupy as central a position in Islamic  higher learning as the theological disciplines did in the university curricula  of premodern Europe. In Islam, this spot in the limelight was awarded to the  legal sciences. Kalām, by comparison, remained a marginal discipline. This is  also reflected by how it has been studied in the West. For much of its history,  the Western study of classical Islamic theology, in the sense of kalām, was  the province of lone giants cutting paths through a jungle thicket. ʿIlm al-kalām, however, is not the only area of Islamic religious thought  that deserves to be measured against the term “theology.” Al-Ghazali’s  Ihyaʾ ʿUlum al-Din (The revivif ication of the sciences of religiosity) heralds  a shift in, and broadening of, how Muslim thinking about God and His  relation to the universe was conceived in classical times. The word dīn,  for al-Ghazali, indicates the inwards dimension of faith (Rahman 1979,  106) – “religiosity,” as we might say nowadays. This understanding of dīn  predates al-Ghazali: for the Muʿtazili mutakallim ʿAbd al-Jabbar (d. 1025), dīn  did not have to do with works, but with “the subjective religious behaviour  ... with which man accepts works and the need to perform them” (Van Ess  2011a, 1267). However, al-Ghazali may be credited for foregrounding dīn as  the key concept in religious knowledge. The “sciences of religiosity” (ʿ ulūm  al-dīn), for al-Ghazali, include more than the knowledge about God sub  specie aeternitatis. While the forty volumes of the “Revivif ication of the  Sciences of Religiosity” do feature kalām-style discussions in several places,  their scope is much broader, covering aspects of religious practice, politi- cal and social ideals, personal piety, and spirituality. Also mythology and  eschatology play important roles. The fortieth and last volume is devoted  </page> <page sequence="5"> Power, orThodoxy, and SalvaTIon In ClaSSICal ISlamIC Theology 139 entirely to the afterlife and is f illed with a plethora of traditions that engage  the religious imagination. It seems to me that this broader understanding  of “Islamic theology” as the “sciences of religiosity,” rather than the narrow  identif ication with kalām, should guide scholars in defining the contours of  the f ield they study, particularly if they want to do justice to the centuries  that intervened between al-Ghazali and the advent of “modern” Islamic  theology in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In the following, I shall try to outline how, in my view, scholars of clas- sical Islamic theology writing in recent decades have probed and, in some  instances, expanded the contours of their f ield. I do this with the aim of  bringing to light some of the issues that drive the study of Islamic classical  theology in particular, but also Islamic studies more generally speaking.  I shall not proceed along epistemological (rationalism-traditionalism),  historical (formative-classical-modern), or school lines (Sunni-Shiʿi-Ibadi or  Muʿtazili-Ashʿari-Maturidi-Imami, etc.), as survey works of Islamic theology  usually do. Instead, I zoom in on three themes: power, community, and  salvation. In choosing these themes, I take my clue from the recent rise of a  literature devoted to meta-critical reflection about the analytical categories  that scholars in cultural studies invoke in their work, a phenomenon that  appears to have spilled over from literary studies and anthropology to the  study of religion, and most recently, to Islamic studies (Lentricchia and  McLaughlin 1990; Taylor 1998; Elias 2010b). The three themes chosen here also offer the advantage of a natural  progression through three concentric circles, circles that stake out a fairly  comprehensive bird eye’s view of the f ield (see f igure 1). In the context of  Figure 1  Thematic approach to Islamic theology the power/ Muslim disempow- individual erment the  Muslim orthodoxy/ community heterodoxy the  Muslim salvation/ “Other” damnation </page> <page sequence="6"> 140 ChrISTIan lange  the notion of power I will discuss how scholars have evaluated the degree to  which Islamic theology preserves individual agency as against the power of  God and of the state, thereby defending the notion of free and independent  thought and action. In the context of the notion of community I will focus  on how scholars have ref lected on the formation of the Muslim umma,  in particular in regard to the question of orthodoxy and heterodoxy in  Islamic theology. Finally, in the context of the notion of salvation, I shall  discuss how scholars have viewed Islamic theology’s attitude towards the  non-Muslim “Other” of Islam. 2 God’s Power and Individual Empowerment In order to evaluate the margin of individual freedom and power offered  by Muslim theology, one must examine how it pictures the individual in  relation to both God and to (divinely sanctioned) government (see f igure 2). Here I propose to look at this triangle of powers through the lens of  al-Ghazali, the famous Iraqi jurist-cum-theologian-cum-mystic who died in  1111. The f irst decade of the twenty-f irst century has seen a veritable flurry  of studies devoted to al-Ghazali, even if scholarship on al-Ghazali was  copious in the 1990s and indeed before. Al-Ghazali is as good a yardstick  as any to measure the current “state of the art” in the f ield of classical  Islamic theology. The year 2011 marked the 900th anniversary of al-Ghazali’s  death, and his unabated popularity found expression in numerous scholarly  meetings devoted to his legacy. Figure 2 T riangle of powers individual government God </page> <page sequence="7"> Power, orThodoxy, and SalvaTIon In ClaSSICal ISlamIC Theology 141 As early as the nineteenth century, Western Orientalists identif ied al- Ghazali as the linchpin on which hinged a whole spectrum of promises and  threats inherent in Islamic thought, whether real or imagined. On the one  hand, al-Ghazali was, and continues to be, a tremendously popular f igure,  a source of enduring fascination. His biography is dramatically cut in half  by an existential epistemological crisis, much in the vein of Augustine and  Descartes, suffered at the height of a brilliant academic career as a professor  in Baghdad, the old capital of Islam. This crisis captured the imagination  of generations of Western students of Islam. Although not the f irst one  to do so in the history of Islam (cf. Massignon 1954 [1922], 246), the fact  that al-Ghazali wrote an autobiography, al-Munqidh min al-Dalal (The  rescuer from error), seemed to many to offer a unique opportunity to grasp  classical Islam through the lens of an outstanding individual, an iconoclast  and virtuoso in all the major branches of Islamic knowledge, a synthetic  thinker who created a new orthodoxy: tout court, as in the title of William  Montgomery Watt’s still def initive study, Muslim Intellectual (1963). On the other hand, scholars thought for a long time that al-Ghazali  had severely undermined philosophical inquiry in Islam by writing an  influential refutation of the Persian philosopher Avicenna (d. 1037), the  Tahafut al-Falasifa (The incoherence of the philosophers), in which he  declared the philosophers heretics for their three views that (1) the world  is eternal, not created by God in time; (2) there is no physical resurrection  of bodies; and (3) God knows only universals and not particulars. With  the Tahafut, generations of students of Islam in the West were taught,  al-Ghazali single-handedly dealt a coup de grâce to the spirit of free inquiry  and the belief in natural laws in Islam. This view was not held by Western  Orientalists alone. The Pakistani scholar of Islam Fazlur Rahman, for  example, called al-Ghazali’s perceived denial of causality a “folly,” going so  far as to blame Islam’s problems with modernity on this doctrine (Rahman  1982, 27, 152). These hackneyed perceptions of al-Ghazali as a maverick luminary and  as the angel of the death of philosophical inquiry in Islam are revisited in  a number of studies that have appeared over the last ten years or so. In the  1990s, Richard Franck argued that al-Ghazali did in fact accept natural  causes, that his cosmology was, in other words, philosophical or Avicennian,  rather than traditionally Islamic (Franck 1994). Michael Marmura, on the  other hand, has insisted on al-Ghazali’s conformity to Islamic “orthodoxy,”  that is, Ashʿarism, the dominant theological school in al-Ghazali’s time.  Ashʿarism’s tenets included occasionalism, the belief that the all-powerful  God creates every event and every human action in a process of creatio  </page> <page sequence="8"> 142 ChrISTIan lange  continua. Like the other Ashʿarites, al-Ghazali would have denied secondary  or natural causes (Marmura 1995, 2002). In a study of al-Ghazali’s cosmology, published in 2009, Frank Griffel has  reopened this debate and proposed a new solution. Griffel’s view is that al- Ghazali philosophised the Ashʿarite doctrine of causality while remaining  faithful to its basic premises. Earlier Ashʿarites held an ambiguous view  of the human capacity to act, a view that is epitomised by the theory of  “acquisition” or “appropriation” (kasb/iktisāb). According to this theory,  God creates human actions but gives humans a temporary “power-to-act”  (qudra muḥdatha) by virtue of which they “acquire” or “appropriate” an  action. Al-Ghazali, according to Griffel, does not simply follow this line  of reasoning, but moves God’s influence one level back. For al-Ghazali,  suggests Griffel, God is not a puppetmaster who “plays” the individual  who, in consequence, remains largely passive and predetermined in his  or her actions. Rather, God acts as the teacher of the puppetmaster, while  the puppetmaster himself is the individual’s accumulated knowledge and  desire (Griffel 2009, 216-219). This does not make it unthinkable that at a  certain moment, the puppetmaster’s teacher will take the strings of the  puppet into his own hands. However, as Griffel emphasises, in al-Ghazali’s  view God has never done so, and he never will (276). In this way, a world  in which secondary, natural causes are fully operational is safeguarded.  According to Griffel, al-Ghazali does not eliminate philosophical inquiry  from Islamic thought; to the contrary, he fully naturalises it. It has been suggested that Griffel is somewhat “over-emphatic” in his  reading of al-Ghazali (Janos 2010, 120), and that there remains an unresolv- able tension between belief in an all-powerful God and in human autonomy  in al-Ghazali’s cosmology. Overall, Griffel seems rather keen to stress that  al-Ghazali was a perfectly consistent thinker. In other words, according to  Griffel, al-Ghazali does not hover between philosophy and theology because  he does not want to commit himself. Rather, we simply must dig deep  enough to uncover the underlying unity of al-Ghazali’s thought. Griffel  suggests that failure to discover this unity is more likely to stem from a  failure to properly understand al-Ghazali’s writings rather than from an  inconsistency in his system (Griffel 2009, 286). Other scholars of al-Ghazali have preferred to draw attention to the  different registers of al-Ghazali’s thought rather than to stress that the  various strands of reasoning that run through his work are ultimately  reconcilable in a harmonious whole. This is the approach taken by Martin  Whittingham’s 2007 study of al-Ghazali’s theory of scriptural interpreta- tion. Whittingham examines al-Ghazali’s understanding of “allegorical”  </page> <page sequence="9"> Power, orThodoxy, and SalvaTIon In ClaSSICal ISlamIC Theology 143 or “non-literal” interpretation of scripture (taʾwīl). This is relevant in the  context of the discussion about individual empowerment in relation to  God, because non-literal interpretation widens the margin for individual  opinion about scriptural meaning. Whittingham identif ies at least three different positions, scattered over  his writings, that al-Ghazali takes in regard to the issue of taʾwīl. In Faysal  al-Tafriqa (The decisive criterion), a work surveying the confessional varie- ties in Islam, al-Ghazali recommends tolerance vis-à-vis taʾwīl, but he also  erects clear boundaries: taʾwīl is only permitted if the impossibility of a  literal understanding is logically proven (Whittingham 2007, 27). However,  in al-Ghazali’s legal works, this tolerance is less obvious, and al-Ghazali’s  concern to seal off the law against the more interpretively inclined schools  of law takes precedence (36). Finally, in al-Ghazali’s esoteric works, taʾwīl  emerges as a parallel method of deriving meaning from scripture, a method  which stands on par with the literalist approach: texts have both exoteric  and esoteric meanings (64). Whittingham makes only a limited effort to  account for the difference of positions adopted by al-Ghazali; he maintains  that, despite all the differences, “a core of genuine views is identif iable” (25). Averroes, one of al-Ghazali’s earliest critics, quipped that al-Ghazali  was “an Ashʿari with the Ashʿarites, a Sufi with the Sufis, and a philosopher  with the philosophers.” In light of the many testimonies to this effect,  Griffel’s outright denial of inconsistency in al-Ghazali’s work seems rather  surprising. Whittingham on the other hand acknowledges al-Ghazali’s  split-personality syndrome but largely refuses to pass judgement on it. This  is markedly different from the position taken by Ebrahim Moosa, who is  the author of what must count as the most imaginative interpretation of  al-Ghazali to have appeared since the turn of the millennium. Moosa’s Ghazālī and the Poetics of Imagination (2005) proposes to investi- gate the possible contribution that al-Ghazali can make to the contemporary  Muslim understanding of “subjectivity and citizenship” (Moosa 2005, 25).  Moosa’s work is therefore not purely a historical study but self-consciously  agenda-driven, as opposed to the other authors discussed so far. Predictably,  reviewers have taken issue with this (Knysh 2007, 295). For Moosa, al-Ghazali  can serve as an “exemplar” for Muslims today to overcome what Moosa sees  as their greatest contemporary predicament, namely, “authoritarianism.” In  al-Ghazali’s tendency to straddle discourses and change registers, Moosa  sees the sure signs of a genius; it is al-Ghazali’s “signature” that he is torn  over the “in between-ness of being” in a “poly-centric world” (Moosa 2005,  30). Moosa’s book is the f irst full-fledged postmodern reading of al-Ghazali,  a reading in which al-Ghazali emerges as a f igure haunted by the experience  </page> <page sequence="10"> 144 ChrISTIan lange  of de-centralisation, but ultimately successful in creating a dynamic, crea- tive, and empowered subjectivity. 3 The Individual and Government However, other readings of al-Ghazali’s hybridity, to use a term dear to  postmodernist theory, remain possible. For example, Omid Saf i, in a book  published in 2006, steers a different course, although he is admittedly more  interested in al-Ghazali’s political than in his theological writings. Saf i  examines the question of how al-Ghazali analysed the individual’s position  vis-à-vis the government. In Saf i’s account, al-Ghazali appears as an op- portunist and careerist, as someone willing to adjust his views in function of  changing political circumstances. Before his crisis, Safi suggests, al-Ghazali  upheld justice and spirituality as a general requirement for rulers. In his  later political writings, however, he would have caved in to the view that  also unjust or even brutal rulers were justified in their actions as long as they  managed to maintain order and see to it that the shariʿa was implemented.  As Saf i points out, al-Ghazali states that the sultan, that is, the ruler who  rules on the strength of power not of virtue or piety, is “God’s shadow on  earth.” In a particularly sinister twist, the sultan must enact punishments  and spread fear lest people rise against him and social unrest ensues (Saf i  2006, 105-124). In fact, upon closer examination, al-Ghazali’s view of the ruling powers  of his day is in some respects similar to how he conceives of the ultimate  power, that is, God. In the “Revivif ication of the Sciences of Religiosity,” his  celebrated opus magnum, al-Ghazali laments the moral corruption of his  day, one syndrome of which is that the Muslim umma is divided into many  sects. In this kind of situation, he avers, the prospect of God’s punishment  in the hereafter has a more signif icant function to fulf il than hope in His  mercy. Al-Ghazali states that “the dominance of fear [of hell over hope of  paradise] is the higher good, because disobedience and self-deceit are the  more dominant over the creature” (al-Ghazali 1962, 45). In consequence,  he warns his readers that “your coming unto it [hell] is certain, while your  salvation therefrom is no more than conjecture,” and he urges his reader  to “f ill up your heart ... with the dread of that destination” (al-Ghazali  1989, 220). Al-Ghazali, in the passages just quoted, instrumentalises fear.  For al-Ghazali, the spectre of God’s violent retribution in the hereafter is a  good thing because it functions to maintain social harmony and cohesion  in this world. </page> <page sequence="11"> Power, orThodoxy, and SalvaTIon In ClaSSICal ISlamIC Theology 145 This, in a nutshell, is also how al-Ghazali justif ied the ruler’s exercise of  violence. In a situation of moral laxity and social strife, the ruler is com- mended for inspiring terror through acts of violence. In fact, according to  al-Ghazali, it is a crucial requirement for a good government to spread fear.  The structure of al-Ghazali’s argument about God’s justice and punish- ment, in other words, is analogous to his argument about the need for  a strong government (Lange 2011, 148). This is one of the more worrying  legacies of al-Ghazali, a legacy in which the individual appears as largely  disempowered, and which does not sit well with the interpretations offered  by either Griffel or Moosa. It is possible to disagree with Safi’s interpretation. There are questions  surrounding the authenticity of certain of al-Ghazali’s political writings, and  when one disputes this authenticity, his political thought appears in a differ- ent light (Crone 1987; Hillenbrand 1988). Our knowledge about al-Ghazali’s  own involvement with rulers has grown with the increasingly detailed in- formation that scholars have collected to reconstruct his biography. Griffel’s  appears to be the most comprehensive account to date. Though Griffel does  not dwell on the possibility that al-Ghazali was complicit in legitimising the  despotic absolutism of the rulers of his time, what is clear, in the biography  that Griffel traces, is that al-Ghazali tried, for a time, to disentangle himself  from the institutions of worldly power. He even took a solemn vow following  his crisis that he would never again let himself be paid by the government  or go to see the sultan. He broke both vows later on in his life, but whether  this happened by coercion or not remains a matter of debate. So, in sum, to what extent was al-Ghazali an “independent” thinker, and  to what extent did he defend individual agency and freedom of thought and  action against the powers-that-be? How anti-authoritarian is his thought?  Different answers to these questions, I would suggest, remain possible,  as the recent literature on al-Ghazali demonstrates. There are, no doubt,  anti-authoritarian strands in his thought. Modern-day Salaf is tend not to  like al-Ghazali, if only because al-Ghazali was not exactly keen on hadith.  Al-Ghazali probably would have disliked the modern-day f inger-wagging  “hadith-hurlers,” as Khaled Abou El Fadl has called them (Abou El Fadl  2001, xi). Al-Ghazali also rejected interpretations of scripture that were,  according to his standard, too literal. At the same time, al-Ghazali was elitist  (and thus in no way atypical in his time), allowing a free interpretation of  scripture only to the very few, and only within strictly defined boundaries.  His political theology was ambiguous, to say the least. One strength of recent studies of al-Ghazali is that they tend to be  based on a broad selection of his writings, and therefore achieve a more  </page> <page sequence="12"> 146 ChrISTIan lange  comprehensive vision of the man. Rather than seeing al-Ghazali’s cosmol- ogy or his political thought in isolation, scholars are working towards a  situation where the above-sketched triangle of powers moves into sight.  However, to f it all strands of al-Ghazali’s thought into one coherent picture  seems almost an impossible task, and it does not matter whether one sug- gests that al-Ghazali was a peripatetic philosopher dressed up as a Muslim  or that he was a postmodern bricoleur. As historians, we may have to live  with al-Ghazali’s elusiveness, and content ourselves with pointing a f inger  to the promises and problems that this elusiveness entails. 4 Community and Orthodoxy Moving on from conceptualisations of the autonomy of the individual, let us  take a look at recent scholarship on “classical” def initions of the religiously  constituted community of Muslims, the umma. Who, according to these  def initions, was “in” and who was “out”? How strictly or how flexibly did  Muslim theologians draw the line between these two groups? What did  they consider Islamically acceptable, or “orthodox,” and what, for them,  was “heresy” and “unbelief”? One problem with such questions is that they tend to seduce scholars of  Islam to take sides and subscribe to one particular definition of orthodoxy.  However, the adequacy of the term “orthodoxy” in the academic study of  Islam has been vigorously contested. This discussion is hardly a dead horse;  there seems to be no general agreement among scholars that “orthodoxy”  is a term that f its Islam awkwardly and that should therefore better be  avoided. Scholars of Islamic law, for example, continue to use the term  quite liberally. In the latest, third edition of the Encyclopaedia of Islam  (henceforth EI3), for example, one reads about the opposition of “orthodox  ʿulamāʾ” to the ʿaqīqa, the rituals associated with welcoming a newborn  into the community, including the shaving of hair, application of ointments,  and other related practices. Here, the term “orthodoxy” seems to refer to  the teachings of the four established (Sunni) schools of law as opposed to  local custom, or ʿurf (EI3: s.v. ʿAqīqa). However, also in entries dealing with aspects of Islamic theology, EI3  authors regularly use the term, and they generally do so without offering  further explanation. For example, a governor of the ʿAbbasids in Khurasan,  in the ninth century, is said to have uphold “Sunnī orthodoxy” (EI3: s.v.  ʿAbdallāh b. Ṭāhir); al-Ashʿari (d. 935) is labelled an “orthodox theologian”  (EI3: s.v. Agnosticism); the Mughal emperor Babur (d. 1530), one learns,  </page> <page sequence="13"> Power, orThodoxy, and SalvaTIon In ClaSSICal ISlamIC Theology 147 was raised “an orthodox Sunnī Muslim” (EI3: s.v. Bābur). More examples  could be given. There is, as far as I can see, only one instance in which  the term “orthodox” is used in inverted commas: the Suf i ʿAyn al-Qudat  al-Hamadhani (d. 1131), the EI3 tells us, positioned himself at a distance  from the “‘orthodox’ establishment” (EI3: s.v. ʿAyn al-Qudāt). While such  use of inverted commas indicates a more complex picture, it gestures to  the problems inherent in the term but does little to solve them. This comes as a bit of a surprise. After all, the awareness among Western  scholars of Islam that “orthodoxy” is a term that can only be applied to  Islam with diff iculty can be traced several decades back. In Bernard Lewis’  classical formulation (Lewis 1953, 58), published more than half a century  ago, he writes: In the absence of an apostolic tradition and of a supreme pontiff, ortho- doxy and heterodoxy in Islam could at f irst sight be determined only  by making the teachings of one school the touchstone for the rejection  of the others. The diff iculties and absurdities of such a standard are  well summarised by Ghazali. Is Baqillani a heretic for disagreeing with  Ashʿari, or Ashʿari for disagreeing with Baqillani? Why should truth be the  prerogative of one rather than the other? Does truth go by precedence?  Then do not the Muʿtazilites take precedence of Ashʿari? Because of  greater virtue and knowledge? In what scales and with what measures  shall the degrees of virtue be measured, so that the superiority of one or  another theologian may be established? Despite such critical remarks, the label “orthodoxy” continued to be invoked  by scholars of Islam in the 1950s and 1960s. This was often done with a  negative connotation, pitching it against the “free-spirited” philosophical  movement in Islam (Rahman 1979, 120). In the 1970s, both William Mont- gomery Watt and Marshal Hodgson again raised a flag and warned against  the use of the term “orthodoxy” in the study of Islamic theology (Watt 1973,  5-6; Hodgson 1974, 67). However, the f irst full-blown attack on the adequacy  of the terms “orthodoxy” and its antonym, “heresy,” for the study of Islam  was formulated by Alexander Knysh in 1993, perhaps in reaction to the  continued use of the term, and particularly of the dichotomy between  Islamic philosophy and “orthodoxy” (Bello 1989). Knysh begins by noting that Western historians of Islam have often  pitched what they perceived to be “orthodox” Islam against “heterodox ten- dencies.” But neither of these terms is easily attributed to only one particular  Muslim theological school or movement. Ashʿarism is often considered the  </page> <page sequence="14"> 148 ChrISTIan lange  “orthodox” version of Islamic theology; but for many centuries, it had many  passionate detractors, especially those ʿ ulamaʾ who found it too speculative,  too tainted with kalām-style argumentation based on Greek logic. As the  story has it, Al-Ashʿari once boasted to the Hanbali preacher and scholar  Al-Barbahari (d. 941) that he had refuted the Muʿtazila, the Zoroastrians,  and the Christians. Reportedly, Al-Barbahari retorted that he did not know  what these groups taught: he only knew what Ahmad b. Hanbal had taught  (Knysh 1993, 61). Knysh also points out that there are examples of Ashʿarites  who, in their spiritual life, were Sufis. Knysh further notes that some have identif ied the movement of the ahl  al-ḥadīth, the “hadith folk,” as constituting an orthodox stream within Sunni  Islam. Western scholars refer to this group sometimes as “traditionists,”  because of the value it gave to “traditions,” that is, hadiths. From here it is per- haps not far-fetched to see in the members of this group Islamic “orthodoxy.”  But Marshal Hodgson pointed out that the label “traditionists” is unfortunate:  it suggests that the hadith folk were somehow naturally aligned with tradi- tion in the general sense of the word, more so than, say, the Ashʿarites or the  Muʿtazila. However, one might just as well insist that theological dispute,  logic and ijtihād was, from the earliest times, part of the tradition of Islam.  The hadith folk can hardly claim a monopoly on the term. What is more,  many of their theological positions were rejected as too extreme. Take as an  example their tendency to accept anthropomorphism, a stance that their  detractors called tajsīm, “bestowing a body [onto God].” Ibn Taymiyya (d.  1328), in the view of many a paragon of Islamic “orthodoxy,” advocated that  God descends to the lowest heaven, as is stated in the canonical hadith, in  the same way in which Ibn Taymiyya, as he once demonstrated during a  sermon, stepped down from the pulpit, the minbar. In consequence, he was  viewed by his less anthropomorphically-minded contemporaries as a man  “with a kink in his head”; people wondered, as Donald Little put it flippantly  in a well-known study, “Did Ibn Taymiyya Have a Screw Loose?” (1975). In sum, according to Knysh, instead of “orthodoxy,” what we have in  medieval Islam is “a perpetual collision of individual opinions over an  invariant set of theological problems that eventually leads to a transient  consensus that already contains the seed of future disagreement” (Knysh  1993, 57). Knysh suggests that the superimposition on medieval Islam of  the concepts of “orthodoxy” and “heterodoxy” inevitably leads to a loss  of nuance; internal divisions are glossed over rather than given full ap- preciation. As he warns his readers, “Eurocentric interpretive categories,  when uncritically superimposed on Islamic realities, may produce serious  distortions” (62). </page> <page sequence="15"> Power, orThodoxy, and SalvaTIon In ClaSSICal ISlamIC Theology 149 What we must do instead is to seek to understand Muslim theologians “on  their own terms.” Here, Knysh gives the two examples of Al-Shahrastani (d.  1153) and of Ibn al-ʿArabi (d. 1240), the former a famous heresiographer, the  latter arguably the most influential Sufi theorist of the later Islamic Middle  Ages. Both Al-Shahrastani and Ibn ʿArabi wrote about the many different  schools of thought in Islamic theology, and both had a remarkably inclusive  view of who could claim to be a Muslim, who was in, and who was out. Knysh  accepts that it is possible to speak of limited or, as he puts it, “spontaneous  orthodoxies,” orthodoxies that arise in particular periods and regions of the  Islamic world as a particular “blend of ‘orthodox’ ideas” (65). Remarkably,  although he succeeds in showing the conceptual problems and pitfalls of  the term “orthodoxy,” Knysh does not recommend that scholars should stop  using it altogether. The reason he provides for this is that it would “seriously  complicate the Western discourse on Muslim societies” (66). Picking up on Knysh’s lead but pushing his conclusions to their logical  conclusion, Brett Wilson has recently attempted to put the term “orthodoxy”  to rest once and for all. He notes that, ironically, scholars inspired by the  work of Talal Asad have contributed to resuscitating the term in the study  of Islam. This, he avers, is a reaction against the relativistic positions of  anthropologists who tend to accord all local expressions of Islam the same  level of “correctness” and thus end up speaking of several “islams” instead  of one Islam, or one “orthodoxy” in Islam. To counterbalance such views,  Asad describes Islam as a “discursive tradition,” a concept that hinges on  the notion that the Islamic tradition, though continuously reworked and  renegotiated, has a common bedrock on which it rests, namely, the Qurʾan  and sunna. Orthodoxy, for Asad, is a “(re)ordering of knowledge that governs  the ‘correct’ form of Islamic practices” (Asad 1993, 201). As such – this distin- guishes Asad’s approach from earlier, more reif ied definitions – orthodoxy  in Islam must not be seen as a f ixed set of beliefs, nor is it embedded in  particular institutions of power; rather, it is continuously (re)produced in  a dynamic process of teaching on all levels of society, in an ongoing process  of relating oneself to the foundational texts and practices of Islam. Asad’s f luid and dynamic concept of orthodoxy, Wilson argues, avoids  some of the earlier essentialist mistakes of Orientalist scholars wishing to  pin down Islamic orthodoxy. At the same time, avers Wilson, it is doubtful  whether such “further ‘loading’ of a semantically overladen term” is useful  (Wilson 2007, 185). Wilson insists that the term “orthodoxy” has run its  course and that scholars should discard it, because the “theological and  righteous connotations” of the term are too numerous. These connota- tions “complicate [the term’s] viability” even “as a purely sociological or  </page> <page sequence="16"> 150 ChrISTIan lange  anthropological term” (186). In sum, the concept of “orthodoxy” in Islam has  become “more of a stumbling block than a launching pad in our vocabulary,  one which instigates more conflicts than it resolves” (185). The term “orthodoxy” and its viability for the scholarly study of classical  Islamic theology is also one of the topics dealt with in Josef van Ess’ recent  history of the genre of heresiography in Islam, Der Eine und das andere:  Beobachtungen an islamischen häresiographischen Texten (The one and  the other: Observations in Islamic heresiographical texts), a towering work  of some 1,500 densely argued pages. Van Ess broadly confirms the picture  drawn by Knysh. He takes him by the word that we must understand Muslim  debates about orthodoxy on Muslim terms. Indeed, in the third and f inal  part of Der Eine und das Andere, Van Ess goes through a list of terms such as  firqa, madhhab, ṭāʾifa, fiʾa, ṣinf, milla, ahl al-sunna, ahl al-sunna wa-l-jamāʿa,  and takf īr, all of which belong to the vocabulary of “who is in, who is out,”  showing in each instance where these terms originate and who uses them  for what purpose. Van Ess begins his book, however, with an analysis of the well-known,  though non-canonical hadith about the seventy-three groups ( firaq) in Is- lam, of which only one is saved, namely the “saved group” (al-firqa al-nājiya),  while the seventy-two others go to hellf ire. On sixty gripping pages Van Ess  shows how different groups in the history of early Islamic theology claimed  the one “saved group” for their own purposes. They did this by adding an  explanatory ending to the hadith or rewording it in suggestive ways (Van  Ess 2011a, 7-64). Towards the end of the Umayyad period, scholars close to  the Umayyad caliphs rephrased the hadith to: “This community consists  of 73 firaq; 72 are lost, they all hate the ruler; saved is the one that is on the  side of the ruler.” Under the early ʿAbbasids, the Hanafi-Murjiʾa broadened  the “saved group” to the extreme, by suggesting that it includes all those  who believe, that is, the “overwhelming majority” (al-sawād al-aʿẓam). This lenient position rubbed many the wrong way, among them the hadith  folk. Ibn Hanbal (d. 855) reportedly said that the “saved group” were, of  course, no other than the hadith folk themselves; and to get back at the  Hanafis, a version of the hadith was circulated that reads: “My community  will split into some 70 groups, but the greatest danger will arise from those  among them who judge things according to their own free reasoning [raʾy]”  – the word raʾy being a nod to the Hanafis, who were known as the “people  of free reasoning” (ahl al-raʾy). Some, more pessimistic voices, held that the  “saved group” were the Companions of the Prophet, and that therefore all  following generations were in principle doomed. Van Ess states that this is  until today “the most popular solution” (39). But this pessimism could be  </page> <page sequence="17"> Power, orThodoxy, and SalvaTIon In ClaSSICal ISlamIC Theology 151 mitigated if one interpreted the hadith to mean that the “saved group” goes  to paradise directly, while all others f irst have to go through the f ire of the  Day of Judgement. The Shiʿites, later also the Ismaʿiliyya, claimed to be the  “saved group.” Last but not least, there is also an inverted version of the  hadith stating that seventy-two firaq are saved while only one is doomed.  This is a version that, on the surface, looks more tolerant, but it could become  a powerful weapon to persecute one particular group. The hadith folk, for  example, wanted to recognise the Muʿtazilites in this solitary “doomed”  group. For al-Ghazali in “The Decisive Criterion,” it was the philosophers (55). Many interesting conclusions result from Van Ess’ analysis of this hadith.  For example, he demonstrates that the nostalgic vision of a saved group of  Companions of the Prophet is a historically grown position that emerged  rather late, no earlier than the late ninth century, and in reaction to the  various disappointments suffered by the early Muslim community. Van Ess  shows the fluid state of affairs in the early centuries, in which no version of  the hadith could impose itself as the authoritative one. Muslim specialists  of hadith criticism could do little to change this. As van Ess writes, “the  censorship of the expert ... had little impact in medieval Islam; after all,  there were no institutions which gave it power; and scholarship’s influence  in those days was, as ever, limited” (55). The second part of Van Ess’ book deals with all the major contributions  to the genre of Islamic heresiography: the works of Al-Ashʿari, Al-Baghdadi,  Al-Shahrastani, Ibn Hazm, but also of scores of other, less well-known  authors. Van Ess notes that the classical works on the variety of theological  positions in Islam are not properly “heresiographical.” Like Al-Ashʿari’s  Maqalat al-Islamiyyin (The doctrines of those who follow Islam) or Al- Shahrastani’s al-Milal wa-l-Nihal “Confessions and sections), they do not  anathematise groups, that is, they do not practice takfīr. In most cases, they  also ignore the hadith about the seventy-two “doomed” sects. The genre is,  in other words, doxographical rather than heresiographical: it records the  tenets and teachings of various groups without passing judgement about  whether they are “in” or “out” of Islam (1201-1206). Van Ess therefore also  proposes to replace the term “heresy” in Islam with that of “denomination,”  and “heresiography” with “denominationalism” (the German Konfession- skunde). The heresiographers’ preferred term for these groups is milla (pl.  milal), which tends to get translated as “sect,” even though a less value-laden  translation as “section” would be more appropriate. As Van Ess points out,  milla is a very generous term, and he suggests that “for a long time milla  was the most neutral designation for ‘religion’ that existed in any language  of the world” (1264). </page> <page sequence="18"> 152 ChrISTIan lange  In the third and f inal part of his book, Van Ess returns to more synthetic  observations. Among other things, he revisits the notion of “orthodoxy” in  Islam. He concludes that the term is “perhaps” useful if used in the value- neutral sociological meaning, but only as a “metaphor,” to indicate the  “dominant opinion” in a specif ic spatial-temporal context, a temporary  “mainstream position.” Such “orthodoxies” (Van Ess uses the plural repeat- edly) usually come with an expiry date; dogmas in Islam did not have the  longevity of dogmas promulgated by the Christian Church. As Van Ess puts  it, dogmas in Islamic history “occasionally had their great moment; but then  they receded quickly behind the scenes of history” (1299). Whether contemporary orthodoxies will have a longer life, Van Ess does  not discuss. He contents himself with noting that the scripturalism of the  Egyptian reformers Muhammad ʿAbduh (d. 1905) and Rashid Rida (d. 1935),  both of whom called for a return to the original words of revelation, is such  a “modern” orthodoxy (1302). However, in an interview given in 2011, Van Ess  is a bit more forthcoming. He points out that “with the help of the media  it is much easier to convey to people a def initive image of Islam and assert  it by supporting it f inancially,” suggesting that “this reversal began among  the late-nineteenth-century reformers we hold in such high regard, such  as Muhammad Abduh” (Van Ess 2011b). These words chime with Norman Calder’s analysis in an article on “The  Limits of Islamic Orthodoxy,” f irst published in 2000. Calder diagnoses that  twentieth-century Islam has witnessed the triumph of a narrowly conceived  scripturalist “orthodoxy,” which rejects the traditional Muslim tolerance  of the concepts of community-based reasoning, gnosis, but also (albeit to  a lesser degree) of reason and charisma, “a massive, complex, sophisticated  heritage, a generous profusion of modes of religious fulf ilment” (Calder  2007, 235). However, Van Ess’ evaluation of the contemporary situation, as  opposed to that of Calder, is fairly optimistic. He states that “essentially, I’m  not worried ... I’m sure that the fundamentalists too will fail to establish  an orthodoxy,” adding that the concept of orthodoxy “[i]s simply not there  in the religion” (Van Ess 2011b). 5 Islam and the Fate of “Others” Moving from the discussion of the place of the individual in Islamic classical  theology to reviewing recent scholarship on how classical Islamic theology  defines the boundary of the Muslim community or umma, let us move into  the last of the three concentric circles and examine the issue of how classical  </page> <page sequence="19"> Power, orThodoxy, and SalvaTIon In ClaSSICal ISlamIC Theology 153 Islamic theology views the issue of salvation, particularly with regard to  non-Muslims, or the Islamic “Other.” First of all, let me note with Van Ess that in the history of Islamic theol- ogy, critiques against Muslim heretics and apostates have usually been  more severe than against practitioners of other faiths. Takfīr, the process  of declaring someone has left Islam and become an unbeliever, is tradition- ally the arena of the most bitter theological disputes in Islam (Van Ess  2011a, 1284-1298). By contrast, those who are brought up as non-Muslims  are already unbelievers, and so they cannot suffer takf īr. In consequence,  they tend to fall under the radar of Muslim theological reasoning. This is  not to deny, however, that the eternal damnation of the unbelievers in hell  is usually taken for granted in classical Islamic theology. Or is it? A recent study by Mohammad Khalil (2012) has tried to cast doubt  upon this piece of received wisdom. For a long time, both non-Muslim  and Muslim scholars of Islam have been telling us that according to the  majority of classical Muslim theologians, Christianity, to give one example,  is not a way to salvation. Soteriological pluralism, the idea that members of  diverse religious traditions are all equally destined for paradise, according  to this view is fundamentally alien to Islam (see, e.g. McAuliffe 1991, 290).  Given the foregoing discussion about how diff icult it is to establish what  may count as Islamic orthodoxy, whether on this particular point or on  any other, it comes as no surprise that the classical tradition does in fact  include voices that speculate about the eventual salvation of unbelievers.  In his study, Khalil comes to the conclusion that the matter remained  “ultimately unresolved,” despite the fact that numerous theologians  claimed there was a broad consensus, or ijmāʿ, on the issue (Khalil 2012,  13-14, 22). He observes that it was particularly some of the most prominent  and influential theologians in Islamic history, such as al-Ghazali and Ibn  Taymiyya, who argued against the idea that all non-Muslims suffer in hell  eternally, thereby opposing narrow exclusivism, or “damnationism,” as  Khalil labels it (Khalil 2012, 19). To return to al-Ghazali, in “The Decisive Criterion” he makes a distinc- tion between four different types of unbelievers. Two of these groups are  doomed in his view, but two will receive God’s mercy and be admitted into  paradise (cf. al-Ghazali 2002, 126). The former two groups are, f irst, those  who commit blasphemy, that is, those who insult the God of Islam and His  Prophet Muhammad; second, those who, despite a full understanding of  the Islamic message refuse to be convinced of it, out of stubbornness or  intellectual laziness. The other two groups, those that will receive God’s  mercy, are, f irst, those who never even heard the name Muhammad and had  </page> <page sequence="20"> 154 ChrISTIan lange  no opportunity whatsoever to learn about Islam. The second saved group of  unbelievers is formed by those who deny Islam because they have not been  provided “with enough incentive” which would have “compelled them to  investigate” the issue. That is, they may have some notion about Islam, but  in the f inal analysis, they do not know much about it. Now, in Khalil’s reading of al-Ghazali, when people in this last group  are provided an incentive to learn more about Islam, when they do start to  investigate the issue, and then still deny its message, they are still considered  saved. As long as they engage in discussion and in all respects behave like  “sincere truth-seekers,” they will be the recipients of God’s mercy (Khalil  2012, 37). One should add here, however, that this is a generous reading of  al-Ghazali and that his typology of the four classes of unbelievers, though  not as exclusive as other classical Muslim views of the non-Muslim “other,” is  still a far shot from modern sensibilities regarding tolerance and pluralism.  However, it does open up a certain space for discussion. At the very least, it  corrects the hackneyed idea that according to Islam, non-Muslims are by  definition doomed to eternal suffering in hell. A different angle on the topic was taken by Ibn Taymiyya and his stu- dent Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, both of whom wrote in the f irst half of the  fourteenth century in Syria, and both of whom are widely hailed as the intel- lectual forefathers of modern-day Salaf ism. Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim  discuss the question of the duration of hell. Both reject the consensus of  the scholars of their time that hellf ire is eternal. They suggest that hell  will, at some point in the eschatological future, have fulf illed its purpose  of cleansing sinners from their sins, including the sin of unbelief. Then hell  will disappear, so that only paradise remains. This idea is referred to as  fanāʾ al-nār, the “passing away of the f ire.” This means that all unbelievers,  indeed all sinners will eventually, after a more or less extended period of  suffering in hell, be admitted to paradise. In the recent scholarly literature,  this position has been described, rather optimistically, as a form of “Islamic  universalism,” akin to the soteriological pluralism that Khalil ascribes to  al-Ghazali (Hoover 2009, 181-201). Whether or not “universalism” is the correct term to be used, here is  another bit of evidence that the question of salvation of unbelievers in classi- cal Islamic theology is not as one-sided and easily decided as meets the eye.  This is also confirmed by a look at the other side of the coin, the question  whether Muslims can go to hell: If the unbelievers are not necessarily in  hell, can Muslims know for sure that they will go to paradise? Here, too, we  are dealing with certain preconceived ideas. Christian polemicists of the  Middle Ages liked to justify what they perceived as the ethical superiority  </page> <page sequence="21"> Power, orThodoxy, and SalvaTIon In ClaSSICal ISlamIC Theology 155 of Christianity over Islam by pointing out that Islam offers an easy way  to salvation. Western researchers of Islamic theology, including Ignaz  Goldziher in the early twentieth century but also more recent contribu- tors to the debate, have referred to the seemingly “limitless optimism” of  “orthodox” Sunni Islam in regard to the salvation prospect of Muslims  (Goldziher 1920, 160; Smith and Haddad 2002, 81). The Islamic “straight  path” (al-ṣirāṭ al-mustaqīm), many may have felt justif ied to conclude, was  exceedingly broad, the requirements for being a Muslim minimal, and hence  moral laxity widespread. In Christianity, on the other hand, salvation was  diff icult, it had to be earned: as one reads in Matthew 7:13, Christians are  to “enter through the narrow gate; for the gate and the road that leads to  destruction is wide, and there are many who take it.” Recent scholarship on Islamic soteriology has suggested that the issue  needs more nuanced inspection than has been hitherto assumed. In the  same way in which scholars of Islamic theology have begun to unearth  strands of universalist thought, the Muslim hell is moving into focus as a  place not just for the unbelievers, but also for Muslims, or rather, for Muslim  sinners. The Qurʾan threatens sinners in general, not just unbelievers, with  punishment in hell. In the early centuries of Islam, the question of the  certainty of salvation for Muslim sinners was discussed controversially, f irst  in the milieu of the Basran ascetics, who denied such certainty and stressed  individual accountability (Van Ess 2001, 104-108), then by the theological  school of the Muʿtazila, who insisted that people would be judged by their  actions, not just by the outwards profession of faith. They argued that it is  not only possible but indeed necessary for God to punish sinners; otherwise  He could not be considered just. The ethical rigourism of the Muʿtazila  survived in other schools and in other forms, for example, in Maturidi  theology. In contrast to the Ashʿarites, Maturidite theologians came to  emphasise that punishment of the grave sinner in hell was rather likely  and, in the greater scheme of things, even necessary (Lange 2014, 160-167).  This punishment may have been conceived of as temporary and purgative,  preparing the sinners for their eventual redemption in paradise. But it was  a formidable prospect nonetheless, psychologically speaking. In sum, there are “universalist” trends in classical Islamic theology that  appear to push non-Muslims in the direction of salvation, and there are  other trends that seem to push Muslims towards ethical rigourism and  accountability for sinful actions in hell. As Khalil notes, “discussions of  salvation in Islam have generally been plagued with oversimplif ications”  (Khalil 2012, 13), but in recent scholarship on classical Islamic theology, a  more nuanced picture of Muslim soteriology seems to emerge. </page> <page sequence="22"> 156 ChrISTIan lange  6 Conclusion: Islamic Theology and the Muslim Religious  Imagination By way of conclusion, let me come back to one of the terms I brought up  at the beginning of my discussion: the religious imagination, conceived  as an integral part of Islamic theology. In the area of Muslim ideas about  salvation and the afterlife, scholarship has largely ignored this dimension  of Islamic theology. As indicated above, a good deal of attention has been  devoted to the works of the mutakallimūn, the proponents of kalām. When  it comes to the afterlife, to eschatology, or “knowledge of the last things,”  the mutakallimūn have things to say about the big questions: who is saved  and who is not, whether hell is eternal or not, and how real the afterlife is,  that is, whether its reality is like that experienced in this world, or whether  it is a different reality altogether. What the mutakallimūn are less interested  in is the topography of the hereafter, the particulars of paradise and hell,  the rewards and punishments therein, the many detailed descriptions of  their f lora, fauna, and inhabitants, sometimes excessive and often quite  wonderful, in sum: the Muslim eschatological imagination. The modern  study of Islamic theology likewise has largely turned a blind eye to this  body of ideas and images. And yet, there is a whole other world waiting to  be charted and analysed. At least two approaches to this universe of images  and ideas can be conceived. Firstly, the Islamic literature about the afterlife offers rich insights into  Islamic theological ethics. The inhabitants of paradise and hell are regularly  identif ied by their virtues and their sins. Some classical manuals in which  stories about paradise and hell are collected in fact appear like catechisms of  sins and virtues. Examples include the anonymous Qurrat al-ʿUyun and the  Risalat al-Talkhis of the Spaniard Ibn Hazm in the eleventh century (Lange  2013). Also the various versions of the Prophet Muhammad’s night journey  (isrāʾ), not unlike Dante’s Divine Comedy, abound with moral teachings  (Vucovic 2005). Secondly, the Islamic literature of the afterlife should be taken seriously  as a genre that plays with notions of the fantastic and the marvellous, and  that therefore deserves to be analysed and evaluated by using the methods  and criteria we apply to similar works in other areas of human literary  productivity. It might be objected that by this shift of focus one leaves the  arena of Islamic theology. However, scholars of Christian theology will not  hesitate to apply the tools and insights developed in literary studies to, say,  the Gospel, or to Bunyan’s A Pilgrim’s Process, and it is not obvious why  scholars of Islam should not do the same. Aziz al-Azmeh (1995) and Kamal  </page> <page sequence="23"> Power, orThodoxy, and SalvaTIon In ClaSSICal ISlamIC Theology 157 Abu-Deeb (2007) are pioneers in this area of investigation. More such studies  remain a desideratum, for making Islamic eschatology comprehensible as  literature will, I think, help us see in it not only a symbolic expression of  doctrinal tenets, that is, statements about ontology and soteriology, but  rather, an expression of the Muslim religious imagination, of a creativity and  playfulness that engages this-worldly concerns in addition to transcendent  ones. To broaden the study of classical Islamic theology to include such  multifaceted uses and functions of Muslim “religiosity” is to develop and  support an appreciation for the historical diversity of Muslim opinions about  how God relates to the world and how Muslims relate to God, and thus to  resist the temptation to see Islam as a monolithic system that provides  clear-cut answers to perennial questions. In this way, as one might hope,  the scholarly study of Islamic theology will be able to contribute to preserv- ing the memory of diversity in Islamic theological reasoning. As Norman  Calder wrote, “[c]ontemporary Muslims are ... offered by their tradition a  massive, complex, sophisticated heritage, a generous profusion of religious  fulf ilment, and any step towards making that heritage smaller must be a  bad thing” (Calder 2007, 235).
