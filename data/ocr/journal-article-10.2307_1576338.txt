Powerful machines generate and maintain an illusion of being elsewhere by uti- lizing various specialized tools to simulate the different av- enues of human sensory input. With stereo views, three-di- mensional (3D) sound and some form of navigation, entire worlds can be created. These worlds can provide access to relatively inaccessible forms of reality: the space of a building that has not yet been built, for example, or terrain unfamiliar to the soldiers about to be sent there. To date, most of the work in virtual reality (VR) has been done for either military training or entertainment games, with Fig. 1. Jacquelyn Ford Morie, Triangle, cibachrome print, 1984. This work combines a traditional photographic element with com- puter-generated imagery to provide a sense of drama and mystery. The three figures seem locked in an emotional triangle, and the viewer is swept into the conflict by means of the sweeping com- puter-graphic portion of the image. a few commercial exceptions. Very little has been created by artists working with this technology, mainly because few artists have had the opportunity to work with the costly tools needed to make these virtual worlds. As a new me- dium for creative expression, vir- tual environments can also be daunting to even the most in- trepid artist, due to the tremen- dous amounts of time and re- sources necessary to build these ABSTRACT Many contemporary virtual environments fail to provide partici- pants with rich and intriguing expe- riences. This is true not only be- cause of limitations in display and processing power in graphics com- puters currently available, but also because few people create virtual worlds in the context of artistic ex- pression. Key to providing intrigu- ing and engaging worlds is an un- derstanding of the power of emotional content. The authors propose that an emotive response can be elicited in a subject through strategic use of imagery and sound in a virtual environment, which will enhance the sensation of immersion in the simulation and thereby help to compensate for the inadequacies of contemporary technology. Their artwork, Virtopia, draws on psychology in its imple- mentation of virtual-reality tech- nologies to produce aurally and vi- sually immersive environments that engage the participant on an emo- tional level. computerized worlds. It takes a team of skilled people to solve even the most commonplace of technical difficulties that regu- larly arise in the building of virtual environments. We are of the opinion, however, that the creation of these worlds should be as much an artistic endeavor as it is a technological feat. In creative terms, the advent of this new technology chal- lenges us all to push the limits of how humans create and ex- perience art. Throughout history, artists have shared their vi- sions with others through the media of their time. Through giving form to artistic expression, each of these media-from painting to sculpture to film-has also limited artistic expres- sion in some way. For example, a two-dimensional (2D) paint- ing might represent only one aspect of an artist's fully devel- oped interior world or mythology. By viewing an expression of that artist's vision, we can begin to see the world in new ways. But what if the artist could re-create the whole of that interior world and we could experience it as the artist did? As Howard Rheingold has insightfully stated, "if art is about seeing the world in new ways, and Virtual Reality is an instrument for cre- ating worlds, artists might furnish the clue to a key question: If our technology ever allows us to create any experience we might want, what kinds of experience should we create?" [1] In theory, virtual reality may finally present artists with the potential to create and share entire worlds that could previ- ously have existed only within their own minds. BACKGROUND In 1992, we found ourselves working together on a VR re- search project for the U.S. Army. This was a project designed to see how well people could navigate within simulated Mike Goslin (computer graphics researcher, artist), Graphics Laboratory, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, U.S.A.

In the con- text of working on this project, we be- gan to have discussions about other things we could do with VR technology, and what we talked about most was cre- ating a work of art. One of us (Morie) was trained as a fine artist and has 15 years of experience making art, as well as an advanced de- gree in computer science. The other (Goslin), currently studying for a master's degree in computer science, is an artist with an undergraduate degree in psychology. Out of many talks, we came up with a concept for fully immersive virtual worlds that would do more than give one a space to walk around in or something to shoot at. We wanted to create worlds that would give people who visited them something to remember, worlds that would catalyze different experiences for each visitor. We wanted those experiences to leave lasting impressions. Morie's previous artwork had been designed to pull the viewer into emo- tionally charged worlds (Fig. 1). Design- ing virtual worlds would provide a chance to expand the dimensions of the artwork to fully encompass the viewer. Goslin's interest in the psychological ramifications of art also came into play. Together we hoped we could build worlds that were emotionally engaging and intriguing enough to make people want to visit them again. We were lucky to have the technical resources (in terms of both equipment and expertise) necessary to create such immersive envi- ronments in the lab where we worked. We started working after hours on a per- sonal project we called Virtopia. world without any technological support for immersion at all. Well-directed early motion pictures employed intriguing stories and artistic manipulation of im- ages to engage the audience on an emo- tional level. This allowed people to be drawn into the experience even though the film was projected in only two di- mensions and without color or sound. Virtual environments today are in a position similar to those early motion pictures due to the limitations of today's technology. As with early films, however, the promise of a satisfying experience is mediated not by the technology in its emergent forms, but by the successful engagement of a participant on an emo- tional level. Techniques such as a good story or psychological interaction can be used to overcome some of the limita- tions of this new technology. These are means to draw the participant more fully into the experience. For virtual environments to succeed at engaging the participant, they need to be immersive, interactive and involv- ing. Most of the virtual environments produced so far contain some elements of immersion and interactivity-even standard building walkthroughs exhibit these aspects. These environments are immersive to the degree that partici- pants experience mobility within a fairly believable 3D space. They are interactive in so far as the computer is programmed to react to certain actions of the partici- pant: doors open at the approach of the participant, for example, or a tank ex- plodes when fired upon. Reactions such as these are simplistic responses to a person's behavior in a virtual world. In many cases, unfortunately, this interactivity appears to be an end in it- self rather than a means of engaging the viewer, especially in the context of games. Here, the potential for virtual environments to provide rich experi- ences is mediated by a video-game men- tality that defines interaction as shoot- ing at things. Immersion and interactivity alone are not sufficient to go beyond the level of games or walkthroughs. To provide rich and stimulating experiences, a level of emotional involvement is also needed. We wanted Virtopia to employ inter- activity and immersion along with rich sonic and visual texturing designed to engage a participant on an emotional level, thereby enhancing the overall ex- perience of the virtual environment. We began by thinking about how human emotions work. THE EMOTIONAL FACTOR Emotions hold an important place in the psychological make-up of a human being. P.V. Simonov, of the Institute of Higher Nervous Activity and Physiology of the Academy of Sciences of the former U.S.S.R, describes emotions as extremely important aspects of our psy- chological makeup in that they are pro- cesses that help to uniquely define our experience of reality [3]. Behavioral re- search has demonstrated that an emo- tive response can be produced through the employment of imagery [4] and sound [5]. William James, a pioneer in the field of the psychology of emotions, most likely could not have envisioned Fig. 2. Virtopia, virtual-reality installation, 1993. A scene from the Spider World, in which a 30-ft spider responds to the actions of the visitor to its web. THE CHAT..FNGE Unfortunately, the current state of vir- tual environment technology is far from the limitless potential that Howard Rheingold envisioned. "Immersion" in contemporary computer simulations is largely restricted to eyes, ears and, to a limited extent, hands and feet. Move- ment through these worlds is often clumsy and unsatisfying, and involves wearing a large amount of bulky equip- ment. Even the fastest computers avail- able today can only generate scenes of high complexity and fidelity at speeds that tend to approach the 15 to 20 frames per sec of early motion pictures. But some of those early films were able to transport the viewer to another 96 Goslin and Morie, Virtopia</page><page sequence="3">. pS: j*4 bt%??. 1. ?I I,- r? *1 P ..

Since a virtual environment is composed entirely of "artificial" sensory input, it is an attrac- tive means by which to elicit emotional reactions based on such stimuli. In creating Virtopia, we hoped to show that psychological and emotional re- sponses produced by the manipulation of imagery and sound within a virtual environment could enhance the quality of immersion for a participant. Our re- search into the area of human emotions led us to the following observations and conclusions. When a person is emotionally in- volved in an experience, he or she is most likely to focus on immediate sensa- tions and less likely to perceive what is happening via analytical thought pro- cesses. The more emotionally involved a participant is, we reasoned, the more he or she will "buy into" the virtual world, thinking of it less as a construct and more as a personal experience. Triggering one emotion can initiate a "chain reaction" of other emotional re- sponses. According to psychologist Carroll Izard's differential emotion theory, "Emotion-induced cognitions may trigger complex memory clusters" (attitudes, beliefs, values, etc.) and "cog- nitions may act as a positive feedback loop and amplify the ongoing emotional state" [7]. A cleverly designed image can, in this way, elicit a rich array of emotive reactions by "tapping into" cul- tural or archetypal concepts. For ex- ample, a picture of a spider can produce a disproportionately fearful reaction when it stirs feelings of arachnophobia, a condition that is often a composite of many images, textures and childhood traumas. At certain levels of emotional arousal, the individual is not only distracted, but his or her analytical mental functioning also becomes somewhat impaired [8]. A person who is aroused to this extent be- gins to receive less information from the outside world, concentrating instead on the sensations directly affecting this emotional state. In a virtual environ- ment, this could result in greater reli- ance on the simulated data that is avail- able within the experience. In a situation of relative sensory depri- vation, such as a highly emotional state, the individual compensates for the lack of information by overprocessing what is available [9]. When the available informa- tion consists of the artificial stimulus of the virtual environment, the person may begin to perceive it as being more realistic than it may objectively appear, because he or she effectively "fills in the gaps" in or- der toproduce a coherent mental repre- sentation of the surroundings. In this scenario, a participant creates an internalized representation of the vir- tual environment that is richer than the actual environment. Richard E. Cytowic lends support to this notion when he states that "the ability to pluck salient information from the passing stream and to act efficiently on fragmentary in- formation is what leads to imagination and an aesthetic capacity" [10]. It is the individual's imagination that allows him or her to generate a more complete world based on the relatively limited in- formation provided by the computer. A participant from whom an emo- tional response has been elicited thus has fewer psychological resources avail- able with which to objectively examine the inadequacies that are inherent in today's virtual environments. He or she will tend to concentrate on aspects of the immediate surroundings and buy into the illusion more fully. In other words, the use of emotional stimulation may actually allow us to compensate for some of the shortcomings of the current technology and produce a much more immersive and stimulating experience. THE VIRTOPIA PROJECT We began work on Virtopia with the in- tention of creating an artistic virtual en- vironment that would be both emotion- ally engaging and meaningfully interactive. The goal was to construct an "emotional simulator" with 3D sound and the fastest and richest graphics available, a system that could be appreci- ated on both aesthetic and technologi- cal levels. The result is a collection of di- verse environments, each with its own color and tone, bound by the common interface of a barren desert landscape populated by oases that serve as gate- ways to the other worlds. Each world in Virtopia engages partici- pants on a different emotional level and responds to their actions in a manner appropriate to the setting and tone. These levels range from "biologically pri- mal" emotions such as fear to more com- plex human experiences such as loneli- ness or existential angst. We postulated that different types of emotional re- sponse could produce their own "flavor" of immersion and thus enrich the overall experience and level of involvement. We employed a variety of mechanical tools typical of virtual environment tech- nology to bring Virtopia to life. To pro- vide the best stereo views of our worlds, we used a state-of-the-art head-mounted display (HMD) capable of a higher reso- lution than most commercially available HMDs [11]. In order to maintain a participant's location and orientation within the simulated environment, we attached a tracking device to the top of the HMD. This device transmits an elec- tromagnetic signal to a nearby receiver, Goslin and Morie, Virtopia 97</page><page sequence="4">which is then interpreted and translated into spatial coordinates (x, y, z and angu- lar orientation) by the computer. The device is fairly fast and accurate to a range of about 6 ft from the receiver. Three-dimensional sound in Virtopia comes from a small but complex net- work of audio devices. When events within the simulation trigger sounds, the main computer sends a request to a synthesizer, which outputs a prere- corded sound sample. The sound is then passed through a machine called a Convolvotron (developed during the late 1980s at the Ames Research Center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NASA] in Mountain View, California). The Convolvotron computes a mathematical relationship between the participant's location and orientation (measured by a tracking de- vice) relative to a given sound source and processes the sound in such a way as to simulate its apparent location within an imaginary sphere surrounding the person's head. The sound source is also "convolved," or combined, using a math- ematical model of how a person's ears actually hear for maximum fidelity. The signal is then pumped through an am- plifier and out to the participant's ears via a pair of stereo headphones. Movement through Virtopia is currently accomplished with a joystick or mouse, but could be expanded to include a Fig. 4. Virtqpia, virtual-reality instal- lation, 1993. A close-up view of a wraith from the Endless Forest. treadmill in order to provide a better metaphor for walking through the simu- lated landscape. All of these devices are linked to the main computer that drives the simulation. The platform on which Virtopia was originally developed was a SGI Crimson Reality Engine graphics workstation, which was able to maintain all the peripheral devices while generat- ing high-resolution stereoscopic images at a frame rate close to that of motion pic- tures. (Virtopia has since been ported to additional computer platforms.) The diversity of these seemingly unre- lated tools necessitates the design of a powerful software system that can hold all the pieces together and allow the dif- ferent components to interact and coor- dinate their respective activities. The dif- ficulty of this communication between devices is compounded by a lack of ac- cepted standards and protocols. Many of the peripheral devices were designed for use with personal computers, which of- ten makes them incompatible with the graphics workstation used as the simula- tion manager. The extra effort involved is rewarded by the increased display speed and image quality afforded by the workstation. Out of this organic tangle of cables and incompatible, jury-rigged devices flows a sensory experience that is novel and astounding. Engaged through both eye and ear, the participant enters an ar- tificial environment of brilliant color and motion. The feeling is both liberat- ing and disconcerting, as one's brain struggles to reconcile ambiguous and often contradictory sensory input. VIRTOPIA EXPERIENCES How does Virtopia provide its visitors with emotional experiences, and how well does it succeed? Upon donning the HMD, a visitor to Virtopia is instantly transported to a vast, lonely and barren desert. There is the sound of strange music in the air, and sand extends as far as the eye can see. Punctuating the mo- notony of the desert are clusters of ob- jects begging to be explored. Moving through the world with the joystick, a participant seems to fly over the sands, finally arriving at one of the clusters, which turns out to be a small oasis. There are many of these oases sprinkled around this landscape. Each oasis con- tains a colorful pool edged with rocks. Coming close to or diving into the pool transports the visitor to another world. The pools, much like the pools in the sixth book of C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia (as one observer of Virtopia pointed out to us), are portals to an- other time and place [12]. We wanted these portals to allow par- ticipants to stumble upon different ex- periences, each of which would provoke some response. The specific response would be based not only on the content of the world, but also on whatever psy- chological baggage each person brings to the experience from past life circum- stances. The various worlds, however, are designed to convey specific emo- tional moods ranging from primal fear to confusion and angst. Some worlds are designed to start out with one feeling, but contain twists that change the feel- ing drastically as the experience progresses. Our intention was to make Virtopia flexible and expandable, so that it could eventually contain dozens of worlds encompassing a wide range of emotional experiences. The ultimate test of whether or not our theories worked would be passed when we could see some evidence that the participants were indeed reacting to the worlds of Virtopia in emotional ways. Our efforts were rewarded at the pre- miere of Virtopia in May 1993 at the Florida Film Festival in Orlando. Our setup was such that only one participant at a time could don the HMD and have the full immersive experience, but all 98 Goslin and Morie, Virtopia</page><page sequence="5">the people in the room could see what the participant was doing by means of two large video monitors. A Virtopia visi- tor would first enter the oasis-populated desert and could navigate to any one of its oases, which served as gateways to the various worlds. We also had the ability to "teleport" visitors to a world of their choice with a keyboard command, which we sometimes did in the interests of saving time or in response to a re- quest to visit a specific world. The most dramatic moment of the evening involved a young woman who had donned the HMD for a quick tour of the simulation. She promptly wan- dered into the Spider World, an envi- ronment consisting of a vast spider web set against a bloody sky complete with an enormous 30-ft spider (Fig. 2). The spider is actually composed of many polygons (much like a house of cards), a construction typical of real-time com- puter models. It lacks hair and other re- alistic spider characteristics. The rapid asynchronous movements of the spider's legs, however, combine with a smooth flow of motion of the body segments to create an overall effect that is more con- vincingly realistic than its parts. Given the interactive nature of the encounter (the spider reacts to the behavior of the participant: running quickly towards the spider, for example, may cause it to turn and run away), the experience can be fairly unsettling, as the woman soon dis- covered. She elicited an aggressive be- havior from the arachnid that caused it to chase her until she was caught and surrounded by writhing spider limbs. The woman screamed, tore the display helmet from her head and ran from the room. Her departure initiated a flurry of requests from the waiting crowd not to visit the Spider World. Virtopia attempts to engage the par- ticipant on a variety of emotional levels that are more complex and nuanced than the fear just described. The End- less Forest World, for example, consists of an abstract forest of massive sym- metrical and richly textured trees (Fig. 3) populated by wraiths (Fig. 4). These female apparitions drift among the trunks in hypnotic patterns to the sound of a choral fugue. The wraiths may be approached, but will flit away before they can be touched. The sense of mel- ancholy and loneliness this world tends to impart is subtle and somewhat hyp- notic. Its rhythms lull the participant tend to stay a relatively long time, far past the moment at which they have "seen everything there is to see." Many have even stated that it is their favorite of all the worlds. For those who decide to leave, a portal leading back to the main desert eventually appears. It is a rectangular door with a red, anemone- like texture: an incongruous object to be found in a forest, to be sure, but one that beckons by its very strangeness. The Wacky Desert adopts yet another approach to engage the participant. Visi- tors to this world are enthralled and con- fused by the myriad of brilliantly colored stars and planets that pitch and tumble above (and even through) the surround- ing landscape of iridescent dunes. The colors of the sky shift to the pulse of spi- raling galaxies and the heavenly bodies resonate with sounds that roll in from all directions. The viewer is liberated from the physical constraints of gravity and logic and is allowed to fly into the rich harmony of textures, shapes and sounds, making this another popular world for participants. Eventually, a blue pool ap- pears in this landscape, providing reen- try to the main desert. Fang City is a world of cycles designed to elicit feelings of existential angst and introspection (Fig. 5). The scene is ini- tially one of pastoral serenity: the par- ticipant stands near a tranquil lake in a clearing. Several bats flap peacefully overhead to the accompaniment of crickets and trickling water. Soon, how- ever, the landscape begins to shift and the sky darkens. The scene metamor- phoses into an urban nightmare. Enor- mous pointed buildings tear out from the earth to loom overhead and disturb- ing anthropomorphic clocks of all shapes and sizes wander aimlessly while they sound out the time. The sound of clanging clocks soon becomes over- whelming. Dark clouds swirl overhead and a jagged city skyline replaces the ring of trees that had circled the hori- zon. The main feeling reported by many people is one of being trapped. In time, however, the buildings recede, the sounds quiet down, and the scene re- turns to its original idyllic state to begin the cycle again. At this point the visitor can find an unlikely way out of this world: an enormous eyeball appears over the fields of flowers. Flying into this eye transports one immediately back into the main desert. The Conversation Room presents an essentially empty space haunted by the memory of a crowd of people talking (Color Plate B No.. 1). In the room's cen- ter is a table on which a scrapbook sits. Each of the four walls is aurally textured with an abstracted animated conversa- tion. As a visitor approaches any of the animated walls, a fragment of a conversa- tion disassociates itself from the general hum. Approaching the scrapbook on the table causes the pages to turn slowly; each page contains photos and post- cards. As the pages turn, other conversa- Fig. 5.

IL-' It W ?i I into a state of passive acceptance of the surroundings, despite the feeling of iso- lation they evoke. Visitors to this forest Goslin and Morie, Virtopia 99</page><page sequence="6">tion fragments become clear. The iso- lated conversation fragments all deal with transitions and changes in life over which we have no control. For example, when approaching one wall, a visitor might hear a voice saying: "It's a feeling like you've been standing on the edge of a cliff and someone suddenly retracts it. You feel yourself falling ...." or perhaps a voice that reverberates with a persistent echo, saying "I don't know, I don't know how to think about all this." The photos in the scrapbook also speak. At a page of images of babies, one overhears: "But they are your babies. You want them to grow up.... Just think if they didn't!" On a page with pictures from a first Holy Communion, one hears: "It was the holi- est of times. I didn't know then it was the holiest of times, but it was. I felt so holy then." This environment has varying ef- fects on those who are immersed in it, based on their own life experiences. Within yet another world, one ap- pears to be suspended high above a clus- ter of exotic mountain peaks. A large school of skeletal fish swim by and the "sky" overhead boils and churns. A peri- odic sound of bubbles completes the ef- fect of being under water. A dark castle sits atop the largest mountain peak. If the participant enters the central tower, the world grows silent as an enormous clam turns and slowly opens to reveal a massive, disembodied head. The head glowers, taunts the visitor and reacts menacingly to any exploration of the room. There is a series of disks bearing colorful images set into the floor, and approaching each one elicits a different reaction from the head. When the last disk is touched, the head shrieks and its eyes bulge out before it finally explodes in spectacular fashion. Virtopia is designed to evolve continu- ally and incorporate more experiences. To date, we have designed approxi- mately 15 worlds for Virtopia and imple- mented seven of them. Several new ex- periences are awaiting implementation. Descriptions of two of these future worlds follow. The Iron Maiden world places the participant at the center of a spherical space about twice the person's height. Thrust through the sphere are huge and dangerous-looking projectiles re- sembling giant rusty nails. They are so numerous as to prevent one from mov- ing anywhere. No real pain or even pressure results from contact with these points, but sounds make it clear that one is bumping into them. The sound creates a psychological barrier, discour- aging movement beyond these shapes. The participant can, however, press past these nails, through the sphere it- self and on to the outside world. At the moment of escape, the world turns bright red and the sounds become ca- cophonous. Once the participant makes it through to the outside world, the cacophony changes abruptly to gentle sounds: wind blowing, the tinkle of wind chimes and soft choral music can be heard in various parts of this space, which is delicately colored, like clouds of rainbows. From time to time, ethereal beings or creatures fly through the space. One of them will lead the visitor back to the desert world. The Iron Maiden world can be experienced as a birth metaphor or a death experi- ence, depending on how one is predis- posed. Some visitors may not even at- tempt to press past the spikes to find what lies beyond. A brightly colored child's room is part of the Toy Box World. Several toys are scattered on the floor, and outside the windows is a sunny daytime environment with a bright blue sky. The toys come to life as they are approached: tops spin, robots walk, xylophones play. The par- ticipant can easily become fascinated by these toys and try first one, then another. At some point, the participant will notice that the scene outside the window has changed. The blue skies have been re- placed by the faces of starving children pressed up against the window. The actual reactions of visitors to this last world and to many others cannot be foreseen. Part of our experimentation in designing Virtopia involves observing the types of effects these various worlds have on people. Are our natural human reac- tions as strong within virtual worlds? Can we evoke a full range of emotions from joy to sadness and nostalgia to angst? Many more participants will have to experience Virtopia before we can an- swer these questions, but our initial feedback is promising. CONCLUSION Virtual-environment technology has come a long way in the last several years. Advances in computing technology and software, along with new ways to config- ure and display these systems, have made it possible to create a new genera- tion of immersive environments. Im- provements in technology, however, will always lag behind our expectations of how good things could be. This does not mean that we cannot create interesting and aesthetic environments with what is available now. We propose that, if artists and designers make thoughtful use of imagery, sound, story and meaningful interaction in order to engage the par- ticipant on an emotional level, virtual environments can produce the moving and rewarding experience to which the technology aspires.
