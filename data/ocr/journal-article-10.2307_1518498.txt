PROPP San Diego, California "The object of our inquiry is among the most controverted passages of Scripture." The cliche applies nowhere better than to Exod. iv 24-6, the so-called "bloody bridegroom" story. The nar- rative's ambiguities have repeatedly attracted the attention of com- mentators, yet they have reached no consensus. It is probably foolhardy to attempt yet another exegesis, but I think it important to show that many seemingly competing readings can be made to work together, and that there remain little-explored approaches that are interesting and even productive. 240n the way,1 at the night-stop,2 Yahweh3 met him and sought to put him to death.4 25But Zipporah took a flint and severed her5 son's foreskin and The Syriac reads "Moses was on the way", clarifying who is attacked, but most likely this is an explanatory plus. 2 C. Houtman shows that a mdlon is not necessarily an inn ("Exodus 4:24-26 and Its Interpretation",JNSL 11 [1983], pp. 81-2), and the ready availability of a flint suggests an outdoor setting. On the other hand, H. Gunkel conjectures that malon is a noun meaning "place of circumcision" &lt; mwl "circumcise" (apud H. Gressmann, Mose und seine Zeit [G6ttingen, 1913], p. 58, n. 4); J. Morgenstern similarly translates "circumcision" ("The 'Bloody Husband' [?] [Exod. 4:24-26] Once Again", HUCA 34 [1963], pp. 68-9). This approach is probably wrong (it will prove important that the attack is nocturnal) but worth noting nonetheless, as it raises the possibility of word play with the absent but implied root mwl. 3 Aquila has "the God". The paraphrase "angel of the Lord" of the LXX and Targums Onqelos and Ps.-Jonathan is an attempt to mitigate the shock of the episode; Jub. xl 2 goes so far as to replace the Deity with Mastemah, the arch-fiend. 4 Although sometimes the causative of mwt "die" is synonymous with hrg "kill", the former often has judicial connotations comparable to English "execute '. The subject of hemit is frequently Yahweh, whose decrees are by defi- nition justice; cf. 2 Kgs v 7: "Am I God, to put to death (lehamit) or to let live?" 5 There is no real reason to doubt the reading; nevertheless, it is worth noting that in ancient orthography "her son" and "his son" would both have been spelled bnh.

"14 The difficulties of identifying the actors and explaining their actions lend this brief vignette the surrealism of a nightmare. After 6 This rendering is meant to capture the variety of proposed interpretations for wattaggac. The parallel in Exod. xii 22, "Take a bunch of marjoram and dip it in the blood which is in the bowl and higgactem some of the blood from the bowl to the lintel and to the two doorposts", suggests a specialized meaning of higgzac meaning to dab or smear (S. Ben-Shabbat, "HeCardt lamma'mar 'hitan ddmim' me'et Dr. J. Blau", Tarbiz 26 [1956-7], p. 213). There are other, less likely interpreta- tions. As higgiac ordinarily means "approach", the Samaritan Targum renders "she approached his feet". Also in this vein are the LXX "she fell at his feet", and Syr. "she seized his feet". On the other hand, Houtman understands higgzac as "to cast down", comparing Isa. xxv 12, xxvi 5; Ezek. xiii 14; Lam. ii 2 ([n. 2] p. 85). By this reading, raglayim should mean "feet", although Houtman himself strangely opts for "genitals". 7 The word ragla(y)w is doubly puzzling: what are these "legs" and whose? The LXX omits "his"-idiomatically, to be sure, but also in order to skirt a difficulty. raglayim may also denote "feet" or "genitalia", and it is probably Moses' penis that is meant here (see below). A less likely alternative is that Zipporah presents the aggrieved Deity with the foreskin "at his feet"; this seems to be the reading of Onqelos, which renders "before him" as if avoiding anthropomorphism. The LXX and Syr., too, inasmuch as they seem to describe an act of obeisance, may take Yahweh as the antecedent of ragld(y)w. 8 ki is difficult to translate here; its function may be merely to introduce direct quotation, or it could be an emphatic "indeed". Since, however, Zipporah has just performed an unusual act and is about to comment upon it, an explicating "for" seems the most suitable rendering (cf. the syntactic function of lemacan in iv 5). 9 The word hdtan properly means "relative by marriage" (T. C. Mitchell, "The meaning of the noun htn in the Old Testament", VT 19 [1969], pp. 93-112), but most often it corresponds to English "son-in-law". The translation "bridegroom" is usually preferred in our passage, however, because of the likelihood that Zipporah is addressing Moses. Even so, this rendering may be misleading. In English a man is a bridegroom only on his wedding day, but, since hatan certainly denotes a life-long relationship with one's father-in-law, it perhaps also denotes a life-long relationship with one's wife; i.e., it may simply mean "husband". The Samaritan Targum translates hm "father-in-law", as if reading * hoten. 10 As the medieval Jewish commentators on our passage were aware, the plural of dam "blood" has a special connotation: it describes either the blood shed by a killer (Gen. iv 10, 11; 1 Kgs ii 5; 2 Kgs ix 26; Isa. i 15, iv 4, ix 4; Ezek. xvi 36; Zech. ix 7; 1 Chr. xxii 8, xxviii 3) or else the miasma of guilt that clings to the perpetrators of the most heinous crimes and to their land, i.e. "blood-guilt" (Exod. xxii 1, 2; Lev. xx 9, 11, 12, 13, 16, 27; Deut. xix 10, xxii 8; 1 Sam. xxv 26, 33; 2 Sam. iii 28, xvi 7, 8, xxi 1; 1 Kgs ii 5, 31, 33; 2 Kgs xix 7; Isa. xxvi 21; Ezek. xix 9, xviii 13, xxii 2, xxiv 6, 9; Hos. i 4, iv 2, xii 15; Mic. iii 10; Nah. iii 1; Hab. ii 8, 12, 17; Ps. v 7, ix 13, xxvi 9, lv 24, lix 3, cvi 38, cxxxix 19; Prov. xxix 10; 2 Chr. xxiv 25).

Greenberg paraphrases mispa.t ddmim in Ezek. vii 23 as "judicial murder" (Ezekiel [Garden City, 1983], p. 154). ddmim thus seems to be a plural of abstraction comparable to betutlim "virginity", neucrim "youth", zequtnim "old age", etc. (GKC §124d-f) and is to be translated "bloodiness" or "bloodshed" in most occurrences. On the other hand, ddmim denotes in Lev. xxii 4, 5, 7 (P); Ezek. xvi 6, 9 (but cf. xvi 22) the blood of childbirth and in Lev. xx 18 menstrual flow; both, like the blood of murder, have inherent defiling properties for P. The blood of circumcision in Exod. iv 23 could also be a parallel example of this usage, although its source is male. 1 The ancient translations seem not to render Zipporah's words literally. Targum Onqelos paraphrases "By the blood of this circumcision a bridegroom has been given to us", which has little basis in the Hebrew, and the LXX has "May the blood of the circumcision of my son stand." The derivation of this latter translation is uncertain. W. J. Dumbrell supposes that the translator read h for h, rendering hatan "bridegroom" as if *huttan "was put" ("Exodus 4:24-26: A Textual Re-examination", HTR 65 [1972], pp. 288-9). Alternatively, if "stand" here means "clot", it is remotely possible, in the light of the similarity of m and n, that the translator read a passive participle of htm "seal", which in Syriac and Arabic can denote the healing of wounds (cf. Lev. xv 3). While the interpretations of the Targums and LXX are interesting in their own right, they are too periphrastic to shed light on the meaning of the original. 12 I.e. let him alone, perhaps emending wayyirep to *wayyerep; cf. Deut. ix 14; Judg. xi 37; 1 Sam. xi 3; 2 Kgs iv 27; Ps. xxxvii 8; Job vii 19. The implied object of "slacken" is "anger" or the like (cf. Judg. viii 3: "their spirit became slack"). Note that the Samaritan reads "from her" (mmnh); i.e. Zipporah, too, was attacked. 13 Some who associate the story with an ancient, poorly understood custom and are troubled by the redundancy of vv. 25 and 26 emend 'az 'dmera to 'dz 'dmeru "then [i.e. in those days] they said" (e.g. A. B. Ehrlich, Randglossen zur hebrdischen Bibel 1 [Leipzig, 1908; reprinted Hildesheim, 1968], p. 277). Conceivably, an advocate of such a theory could, without emending the text, see in admerad a survival of the old Semitic feminine plural -a or else take the verb as an impersonal feminine third person singular: "then one said" (cf. Morgenstern [n. 2], pp. 67- 8). In any case one would rather expect an imperfect *to(')mar/to(')marna (Morgenstern, p. 68). Moreover, J. de Groot ("The Story of the Bloody Husband [Exodus IV 24-26]", OTS 2 [1943], p. 14) brings in an illuminating parallel to the redundancy of verses 25-6: "She called the child Ichabod, saying, 'Glory (kdbod) has gone into exile from Israel' concerning the taking of the ark of God and con- cerning her father-in-law and husband. She said, 'Glory has gone into exile, for the ark of God has been taken' " (1 Sam. iv 21-2). So Exod. iv 26 should probably be translated "then she said" or "that was when she said"; we should not be troubled by the repetition of part of verse 25. 14 I tentatively regard mu2lot as a plural of abstraction, hence, "the act of circum- cision". The sense of the preposition 1- seems to be "in reference to" (B. S. Childs, The Book of Exodus [London and Philadelphia, 1974], p. 100). Targum Onqelos provides an interpretative paraphrase: "But for the blood of this circum- cision, the bridegroom would deserve killing." The LXX, as in the previous verse, reads "May the blood of the circumcision of my son stand." 15 Freud regarded circumcision as symbolic of castration (Moses and Monotheism [New York, 1939], pp. 144, 192). 497</page><page sequence="4">WILLIAM H. PROPP life and seemingly said to both son and father, "You are my bridegroom." While this is not the "point" of the episode, the nar- rative's power is enhanced by its dramatization of the anxieties Freud called "Oedipal", an issue to which we shall return. Still, we must make every effort to get through the text's surface opacity. Yahweh plainly attacks in iv 24-6-but whom, Moses or his son? And why? Although the Rabbis16 and the moderns17 are in disagreement, I do not think the situation is altogether hopeless. Dubious assumptions may have hampered older exegetes, and, if so, these can be corrected. Specifically, traditional Jewish commen- tators presumed unitary (i.e. divine) authorship, and in the Torah as we have it the object of Yahweh's attack is admittedly unclear (see n. 60 below). Conversely, most moderns have viewed Exod. iv 24-6 as a fragment from an otherwise unknown source'8 or as part of a reconstructed, poorly preserved fifth source,19 an approach that also precludes interpretation of the story, as its original context is lost. In contrast, association with the J document solves many problems.20 Here is how the story fits into J: 19Yahweh said to Moses in Midian, "Go, return to Egypt, for all the men who seek your life have died." 20Moses took his wife and his son(s)21 and mounted them on the ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt. 24On the way, at the night-stop, Yahweh met him and sought to put him to death. 16 See M.

So far inJ Moses has but one son (Exod. ii 22), and thus the Yahwistic text should originally have read *"his son" (J. P. Hyatt, Commentary on Exodus [London, 1971], p. 86). Perhaps, then, the original editor or a later copyist intentionally harmonized by pluralizing *beno. Another avenue of change, however, is innocent scribal confusion. In the Yahwist's day, to judge from inscriptions, "his son" would have been spelled bnh 498</page><page sequence="5">THAT BLOODY BRIDEGROOM We can now identify the victim of the assault, at least for J. Who could "him" be but Moses?22 Were it the child,23 the text would read "sought to put Moses' son to death". Some argue further that "her son" in iv 25 implies that the child is being introduced into the action for the first time.24 The reason it is Zipporah who acts, then, is probably that Moses is incapacitated from Yahweh's attack (ibn Ezra). It also follows that "he slackened from him" refers to the cessation of Yahweh's aggression against Moses. These clarifications do not relieve the bizarreness of the tale, however. Why should Yahweh suddenly attack the man he has just commis- sioned to liberate Israel? Does the author mean to attribute to Yahweh emotional instability? Perhaps. As many have observed, Moses is not the only biblical character unexpectedly and violently confronted by the Deity or his angels. S. Talmon, for example, compares Jacob's wrestling in the fords of the Jabbok (Gen. xxxii 24-32) and Balaam's confrontation with an armed angel (Num. xx 22-35), both legends wherein a wayfarer is beset by a servant of the God at whose behest he is travelling. In general, the Bible reflects a conviction that dealings with divinities are fraught with peril for human beings (e.g. Gen. xxxii 31; Exod. xix 21-4, xx 15-18, xxiv 11, xxx 20; Lev. xvi 13; Deut. v 5;Judg. xiii 22; 1 Sam. v-vi; 2 Sam. vi 6-7; 1 Kgs viii 11; Isa. vi 5). The sudden attack upon Moses is less surprising than appears at first. But if Yahweh is often portrayed as volatile, his actions are rarely if ever irrational.25 We still need to seek a motive for his attack upon and "his sons" bnw. In later standard biblical spelling, however, "his son" is bnw, and "his sons" is bnyw. There must have been a transitional period in which bnw could be read as either beno 'his son' or bandw "his sons". Thus, if the original were *bnh "his (or 'her'; cf. iv 25) son", a scribe might have modernized the spell- ing to *bnw, and then another copyist, mistaking this for an archaic plural, could have modernized again by addingyod to yield bana(y)w, which is unambiguously plural (cf. F. I. Andersen and A. D. Forbes, Spelling in the Hebrew Bible [Rome, 1986], p. 62). 22 Cf. E. Kutsch, "Der sogenannte 'Blutbrautigam'. Erwagungen zu Ex 4, 24- 26", ZDMGSup 4 (1977), pp. 122-3. 23 His age is unclear. He at least seems to be small, since he and his mother together ride one donkey. 24 G.

In Num. xxii we can understand why Yahweh, having only grudgingly authorized Balaam's departure, should still wish 499</page><page sequence="6">WILLIAM H. PROPP Moses. We should be careful, however, to distinguish between two types of motivation: (a) the motives of the character Yahweh (within the artificial reality of the story); (b) the motives of the historical Yahwist for telling the story in a specific manner. In a complex text, both narrative logic and narrator's logic are likely to be at work, and we can learn much from their interplay.26 We will start with Yahweh's motives for attacking Moses. G. Vermes has assembled the earliest Jewish interpretations, almost all of which infer that Moses has failed to circumcise his son, thereby angering Yahweh and provoking his assault.27 Thanks to Zip- porah's quick action, God is appeased through either the blood or the act of circumcision. This explanation may be correct, yet it is problematic for the modern interpreter. The strict command to circumcise boys on the eighth day is from P (Gen. xvii 12), whereas our tale is from the older J source. Even if the Yahwist, too, assumed infant circumci- sion, his document nowhere commands it. It seems unfair and implausible that readers should be expected to infer both the requirement of circumcision and Moses' omission of the rite merely from the cryptic Exod. iv 24-6.28 While the traditional Jewish to sport with the prophet: he is simultaneously venting his spleen and emphasizing that the seer had better do as told. This may seem childish, but it is plausible behavior to ascribe to an anthropopathic Deity. Moreover, the narrator no doubt delighted in telling of the discomfiture of a foreign prophet. As for Jacob, he is not really attacked by the angel in the fords; they simply begin to wrestle, and it is not clear that Yahweh is involved at all. 26 For example, Jacob's wrestling with the angel is hard to explain within the logic of the narrative (but note the encounter with an angelic camp in Gen. xxxii 3), but evidently the author had requirements that overrode his need to have his story flow naturally. Specifically, he wanted to explain how the Patriarch received the nameyisradel (analysed as "he contends with a god"), how a site received the name penu¥el "face of a god", and why the Israelites avoided eating a certain cut of meat. Although the depiction of a wrestling bout immediately before Jacob's traumatic reunion with his brother is psychologically resonant with its context (is he wrestling with Laban? with Esau? with himself? with Aging?), the beginning of the story in Gen. xxxii 25 remains surrealistically abrupt and in this respect indeed resembles Exod. iv 24. Only rarely will a biblical writer let his own interests so impair the inner logic of his creation as to make causality irrelevant-that would lessen the realism of his story and thereby his own credibility. But when this does occur, when narrative logic yields to the author's desire to make a point, the characters' actions may indeed seem irrational. The Jabbok story and Exod. iv 24-6 each have the air of a myth or a dream (cf. Kutsch [n. 22]). 27 "Baptism and Jewish Exegesis: New Light from Ancient Sources", NTS 4 (1957-8) pp. 308-19. 28 We cannot argue that the very non-mention of circumcision in Exod. ii 22 implies its neglect, for, although we read of many births in J's Genesis, not once is circumcision mentioned in this regard. 500</page><page sequence="7">THAT BLOODY BRIDEGROOM explanation is reasonable-the Torah can be elliptical-a more convincing interpretation would find a pretext for Yahweh's attack in events prior to Moses' departure from Midian. Many modern commentators have approached our story through its "moral": the repeated phrase hatan ddmim. Most have focused upon the meaning of hadtdn and the identity of its referent, but they have reached an impasse: basically, neither Moses nor his son is literally Zipporah's "son-in-law" or "bridegroom", the usual translations of hadtdn. In fact, the qualifiers ddmim "(of) bloodiness" and 1i "to me" suggest Zipporah is using hadtdn in a new or unusual way, in which case the term might mean anything. It could refer to either her husband or her child. The word ddmim, on the other hand, though potentially more revealing, has been largely neglected. Almost all assume that the reference to blood is explained by "she dabbed his legs" (iv 25); i.e., with either the flint or the foreskin Zipporah applies her son's blood to Moses. This is undeniably the simplest reading, but other possible nuances of ddmim have not gone unexplored. Some, for instance, see the association of a bridegroom and blood as alluding to the blood of the wedding night; this approach has not, however, proven productive. The theory of E. Meyer, Die Israeliten und ihre Nachbarstdmme (Halle, 1906), p. 59, and Gressmann (n. 2) that a demoniac Yahweh is claiming the "right of the first night" and that Zipporah bloodies Yahweh's genitals, calling him "bridegroom" to make him think he has pierced her hymen, "must still be men- tioned only out of historical interest-as a example of what was once possible";29 Elias Auerbach, however, has since perpetuated this grotesquery.30 We may be sure that Yahweh is no more a con- cupiscent demon-god than Zipporah is a virgin mother.31 G. Schneemann takes a more sensible approach. Her 1979 dissertation defines hatan ddmim as "a bridegroom who has shed blood", which she takes to denote Yahweh, trying to kill Moses.32 Schneemann's argument is a step both forward and sideways. It is 29 The apt words of H. Junker, "Der Blutbraiutigam", in H. Junker and J.

PROPP true that the plural damzm, as opposed to the singular dam, almost always has the connotation of "blood-guilt";33 this is why Targum Onqelos paraphrases "the bridegroom would deserve killing". In the context of our story, while ddmim superficially refers to the blood of Moses' son, the nuance of blood-guilt may also be at play-after all, Yahweh does try to "put to death" Moses. Yet Schneemann cannot be correct in attributing the blood-guilt to Yahweh. In the first place, Yahweh does not actually kill Moses. Secondly, in no sense is Yahweh Zipporah's hadtn-unless we con- coct a bizarre theory of hieros gamos. Lastly, only unjust homicide creates blood-guilt, whereas Yahweh's acts in the historical books are by definition just; unlike the Hindu gods, he is inherently immune to blood-guilt. On the other hand, Schneemann's rendering "a bridegroom who has shed blood" fits Moses perfectly. He is Zipporah's relative-by-marriage, former bridegroom and current husband. Moreover, he has until recently been wanted in Egypt for murder,34 as Yahweh reminds him in iv 19: "Go, return to Egypt, for all the men who seek your life have died." Before continuing our exegesis, we must pause to consider the Israelite concepts of murder, blood-guilt, asylum and atonement. Then, armed with the presuppositions of the ancient writer and his audience, we will be able to understand the story as its author intended. According to Gen. iv 10 (J), the blood of the (unjustly) slain cries out to Yahweh from the ground. The ordinary punishment for murder is execution of the culprit (Exod. xxi 12; Lev. xxiv 17; Num. xxxv 16-21, 31), preferably at the hands of his victim's kin.35 Only this will lift the curse from the land (Num. xxxv 33-4; Deut. xix 10, 13, xxi 1-9; cf. Gen. iv 11). Monetary restitution, the 33 Compare especially 'isW/ans'e ddmim (2 Sam. xvi 7, 8; Ps. v 7, xxvi 9, lv 24, lix 3, cxxxix 19; Prov. xxix 10) "man of blood, murderer". Places may also stand in construct to ddmim: beit ddmim (2 Sam. xxi 1), Cir ddmim (Ezek. xxii 2, xxiv 6, 9; Nah. iii 1). 34 Cf. P. Middlekoop, "The Significance of the Story of the 'Bloody Husband' (Ex. 4:24-26)", The South East Asia Journal of Theology 8 (1967), pp. 34-8. D. N. Freedman privately compares the widely attested midrash that Michael and Satan/Sammael fought over the body of Moses (e.g. Jude 9), with Satan claiming that Moses was an unabsolved murderer; see L. Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews 6 (Philadelphia, 1928), pp. 159-60. 35 See R. de Vaux, Les institutions de l'Ancien Testament I (Paris, 1958), pp. 26-8 = E.tr., Ancient Israel (London and New York, 1961), pp. 10-12. 502</page><page sequence="9">THAT BLOODY BRIDEGROOM ordinary redress for crime, is disallowed (Num. xxxv 31-2). The basic principle is enunciated by Yahweh, in a somewhat rounda- bout fashion, in Gen. ix 5-6 (P): "I demand your blood for your lives, I demand it from the hand of any animal, and from the hand of a human in regard to a fellow human I demand the life of a human. Who spills the blood of a human, by a human36 will/must his blood be shed, for humanity was made in the image of God." The victim's nationality does not matter. Whether he is a Hittite (2 Sam. xii), a Gibeonite (2 Sam. xxi) or an Egyptian, Yahweh demands that the blood of murderers be shed, i.e., that they be executed. It is crucial to note, however, that Israelite law distinguished between premeditated and accidental homicide (i.e. manslaughter). The full severity of the blood-for-blood principle applied only to first-degree murder. For cases of manslaughter there was a special provision (Exod. xxi 12-14). "Who strikes a man so that he dies must be killed. But for him that did not lie in wait, and God by hap- penstance brought it to his hand, I will set for you a place to which he may flee. But if a man plots against his neighbor to kill him by stealth, take him from my altar to die." The fleeing killer might grasp the altar of Yahweh for temporary asylum (cf. 1 Kgs i 50-3, ii 28-34), but, for the longer duration, there were to be six cities of refuge (Num. xxxv 9-34; Deut. iv 41-3, xix 1-13; Josh. xx). In a court today Moses might get off with a conviction of second- degree murder, inasmuch as his act in ii 12 was basically impromptu. Admittedly, the laws of the city of refuge do not grant asylum to the second-degree murderer, and admittedly Moses peered "this way and that and saw that there was no one" before killing the Egyptian; i.e., there was some premeditation involved. Nevertheless, a good lawyer would point out that Moses did not really "lie in wait" (Exod. xxi 13) for the Egyptian, that his was essentially a crime of spontaneous passion. Thus Moses' act may fall into a legal gray area, and, while an Israelite legist might not have granted him asylum, an Israelite storyteller might have been more lenient. Let us for the moment assume that the principle of asylum would protect Moses and explore the consequences. Whether and when there existed functioning cities of refuge in Israel is immaterial; it 36 Or "for that human" (J. Milgrom, privately). 503</page><page sequence="10">WILLIAM H. PROPP is the theory that concerns us here. The killer is safe from avengers only as long as he stays within the borders of the city, in a sort of internal exile (Num. xxxv 26-7). He may depart only upon the death of the incumbent high priest (Num. xxxv 25, 28; Josh. xx 6).37 The Bible never explains the connection between the priest's death and the removal of blood-guilt. Was there a general amnesty at the inauguration of a successor? Was there believed to be a special configuration of purity and impurity between the terms of two high priests, with the property of dissolving blood-guilt? M. Greenberg argues forcefully against such theories and infers, following B. Mak. lb, that the death of the priest atones for unavenged murders.38 We may compare another example of vicarious atonement: when a murdered corpse is found beyond city limits and no culprit can be discovered, a heifer is to be slain to atone for the blood of the victim (Deut. xxi 1-9), lest the entire area be cursed by Yahweh. It is noteworthy that the heifer cannot be slaughtered in the usual fashion; rather, her neck is broken- according to Exod. xxxiv 20 the technique for slaughtering non- sacrificial animals devoted to Yahweh.39 Even though the criminal is not apprehended and little blood is shed, the heifer's death removes blood-guilt from the land. If the heifer's death expiates for murder, so too, perhaps, does the high priest's. For our purposes, the key point is that, although blood-guilt can- not be bought off, a manslayer may go into quasi-exile until his guilt may be vicariously expiated. I suggest that an Israelite reader would have understood Moses' flight to Midian, in or near which is "holy ground" (Exod. iii 5 [J]), as a murderer's quest for asylum. Moses eventually outlives his victim's avengers, be they kin or civil authorities (iv 19). But is he free to go home? Not 37 One wonders how it felt to be high priest, with scores of men who had already shed blood, albeit inadvertently, impatiently awaiting one's death. 38 "The Biblical Concept of Asylum", JBL 78 (1959), pp. 125-32. 39 The unusual procedure may perhaps be explained by Deuteronomy's overall theme: one may sacrifice only at the central shrine. Although before cultic cen- tralization the heifer might perhaps have been sacrificed at the nearest high place, after the Josianic reform it was sufficient and necessary to put it to death without shedding blood (contrast, however, the dispensation for local slaughter in Deut. xii 20-8); cf.

The logical inference is that it is Moses' attempt to return home with unexpiated blood-guilt upon him that elicits Yahweh's attack. As confirmation we note (a) that hemft "put to death" often has the connotation "execute";40 and (b) that the word bqs "seek" ties together Exod. ii 15 (Pharaoh seeks to kill Moses), iv 19 (unspecified men seek Moses' life) and iv 24 (Yahweh seeks to put' Moses to death), implying that in all three cases the pretext is the same: Moses had murdered an Egyptian. Now the expression "hadtn of blood-guilt" takes on a new mean- ing. When Yahweh attacks Moses, Zipporah for the first time realizes that the violent stranger she married is a felon (Middlekoop [n. 34]). Had she known, she might have hesitated to marry a "bridegroom of blood-guilt" with both a price and a curse on his head. My assumption is that the Yahwist's original readers were steeped in the general principles of guilt and retribution embodied in a refined form in the legal codes. After the murder of Exod ii 12, they would have expected Moses to be killed or exiled until his guilt might be lifted. Thus in ch. iv the surprise lies not in the Deity's attack in verse 24, but rather in his reassurances in verse 19: "Go, return to Egypt, for all the men who seek your life have died." As we have seen, the death or appeasement of avengers does not con- stitute amnesty. So why does the Deity send Moses back? Yahweh's problem is that he has two irreconcilable plans for Moses: he wants both to dispatch him to Egypt to liberate Israel and to punish him for his old transgression. How can he accomplish both? Should Moses return home with guilt upon his head, he must be killed. The result of this impasse is the quasi-schizophrenic behavior of the Deity.4' Zipporah, however, finds a way out. Since Yahweh relents after her action, we may infer that by shedding the blood of their son Zipporah has improvised a blood expiation rite. Moses is cleared and may return home to carry out his mission. This analysis also 40 Cf. "the redeemer of the blood [i.e. the avenger] must kill [yamit] the murderer" (Num. xxxv 19, 21). 41 Exod. iv 19 is not the only case of Yahweh giving misleading commands that cause human beings to sin; cf.

Since it is Moses' crime that is being atoned, it must be to him that Zipporah applies the bloody knife or foreskin; i.e., Moses is the antecedent of the suf- fix on ragld(y)w (v. 25). The expiatory virtue of non-lethal bloodshed is transferred from son to father, as the child's blood substitutes for his father's, which had been theoretically forfeit. This raises two further questions: why should the atoning blood come from the penis instead of another body part, and why should it come from the innocent son, rather than from the guilty father? To us Zipporah's actions seem irrational, and so we must look to the world of the author for an explanation. Might the Israelites have attributed an expiatory function to circumcision? Note that Lev. xii 1-5 (P) implies that a boy's circumcision removes his mother's ritual impurity from childbirth. Perhaps for J, too, cir- cumcision could remove the taint of blood. We may compare the Phoenician myth recorded by Philo of Byblos and transmitted by Eusebius (Praeparatio Evangelica 1.10.33): "At the occurrence of a fatal plague, [the god] Kronos immolated his only son to his father Ouranos ["Heaven"], and circumcised himself, forcing the allies who were with him to do the same."42 In the Phoenician story cir- cumcision seems to be a propitiatory response to adversity; so perhaps in Exodus does it serve as a rite of expiation to avert divine vengeance. But if Kronos corresponds to Moses, we would expect Moses, not his son, to be circumcised. At least Moses' penis is involved some- how, for I accept the view that ragld(y)w in iv 25 denotes Moses' genitals, reddened with blood.43 The natural inference is that, by either touching Moses' penis with the flint or applying the foreskin to Moses' penis and then removing it, Zipporah symbolically cir- cumcises her husband.44 But why not circumcise Moses directly? One possible explana- tion is that Moses is already circumcised, whether as an Israelite or 42 H. W. Attridge and R. A. Oden, Philo of Byblos.

The answer rather is bound up with the original meaning of the phrase hatan ddmim, evidently forgotten by the Yahwist's day. I have argued that in the context of Exod. iv 24-6 the term alludes to Moses' blood- guilt, but I believe with many others that, since the expression is unique to our passage and appears twice, Exod. iv 24-5 explains an expression felt to be obscure by the Israelites; i.e. it is, among other things, an etiological narrative.46 Why indeed should such an unusual phrase be associated with a tale of circumcision? As innumerable scholars since Wellhausen have observed, it can be no coincidence that in Arabic, while hdtana means "to become related by marriage", the base form hatana means "to circumcise".47 Modern Muslim practice varies widely (from seven days to at least fourteen years),48 but the ambivalence of htn suggests that some pre-Islamic Arabs circumcised adolescents soon before marriage. Josephus (Ant. 1.214) and Eusebius (Praeparatio Evangelica 6.11.69) report that the Arabs circumcised at age thirteen-but it is possible that these writers were simply inferr- ing this from Gen. xvii 25, according to which Ishmael was circum- cised at that age. There are vestigial practices from the Muslim world that associate marriage and circumcision (see Appendix 1 at the end of this article), and the custom of prenuptial circumcision is attested sporadically in modern times, especially in South Arabia (see Appendix 2). The Arabs' association of marriage and circumcision is not unparalleled. Among the Australian Deiri, for example, a boy's cir- cumciser may also choose his wife, and his foreskin is in fact inserted into the intended's vagina. Among the Australian Pitjant- jara the circumcision may be performed by the future brother-in- law or father-in-law; after the rite the adolescent is given his 45 On Egyptian circumcision see Jer. ix 24-5 and C. de Wit, "La circoncision chez les anciens Egyptiens", Zeitschrift fur Agyptische Sprache und Altertumskunde 99 (1973), pp. 41-8. 46 Cf.

PROPP betrothed.49 There are also three stories in the Bible that feature cir- cumcision, marriage and the root htn. The first is Gen. xxxiv 14-17 (Shechem must be circumcised to marry [htn] Dinah), the second is our tale, and the third, more subtle, is 1 Sam. xviii 25 (David pays a bride-price of foreskins to his prospective hoten Saul).50 In the light of these traditions, it seems likely that in Hebrew as in Arabic htn formerly connoted both circumcision and marriage. Thus hoten "father-in-law" and hdtdn "son-in-law/bridegroom" may have once also meant "circumciser" and "circumcised".51 Moreover, Morgenstern (p. 58) pertinently observes that a hoten is only a man's father- or brother-in-law, never a woman's. The likely explanation for the difference is a primordial connection with cir- cumcision. We know, however, that the age of Israelite circumcision had moved from adolescence to early infancy by the time of P (Gen. xvii) at the latest.52 The result of this shift could have been lexical confusion, with some uses of htn adhering to the marriage rite and others to circumcision. Specifically, hdtdn might have come to mean both "relative-by-marriage" and "circumcised child". If we hypothesize that circumcision had already moved to childhood by the Yahwist's day, we can account for Zipporah's actions in Exod. iv 24-6. Although she has no reason to circumcise her son, the nar- rator had a good reason to describe her as having done so: he wished to explain a fossilized expression.53 A story depicting this semantic transition should in theory bring into contact a "relative-by-marriage" and a circumcised child- precisely what we find in Exod. iv 24-6. If the author is trying to explain why the son and the father are both called hdtdn "bridegroom/circumcised", it makes sense that each should have 49 M.

Ezek. xxviii 8-10, xxxi 18, xxxii 19, 21, 25-6, 28-32), hence the importance of performing the operation at the earliest age possi- ble.

The father receives damim "blood" from his son and, as it were, gives him the title hatan in exchange. By this scenario, damim may originally have denoted the blood of circumcision, plain and simple. Only with the development of the nuance "blood-guilt" did it become necessary to frame a story link- ing marriage, circumcision and murder. But it is alternatively possible that hatan damim always contained a reference to murder. If it was the case that a man's in-laws became his blood avengers at marriage or at the birth of his first child, then a hatan damim might originally have meant an "in-law protected by blood- vengeance" (compare Akkadian hatdnu, "protect"). If this under- standing is correct, the behavior of Simeon and Levi in Gen. xxxiv becomes more heinous still: the men of Shechem were actually under the protection of the sons of Jacob.54 However that may be, by my analysis those who identify the 54 We might speculate on why tradition should credit a foreigner with an innovation in Hebrew terminology. Not that this is so surprising-Zipporah is after all the wife of Moses, and her father Jethro later founds the Israelite judiciary (Exod. xviii). That specifically a Midianite should be familiar with circumcision makes sense, inasmuch as they are grouped with the other Arabian tribes as descendants of Abraham (Gen. xxv 1-4; Judg. viii 24), all of whose male descen- dants (according to P) were required to be circumcised, as indeed the ancient Arabs were. Since the Midianites came into frequent contact with Israel, the author may even have known their language, and, if Midianite like Arabic used htn "circumcise", this could have induced the Yahwist or his source to interpret hatan damim as a Midianism (Kosmala [n. 18], p. 27; Kutsch [n. 22]). Also, as one can hardly mention Jethro or the Kenites/Midianites without adding "Moses' father-in-law (hoten moseh)", it would have been natural to think of a Midianite when associating Moses with the root htn. If we assume an active-passive relation- ship between the nouns hoten and hdtdn, when Zipporah says "you are a hata-n to me", she is essentially appropriating her father's function as hoten "circum- ciser/father-in-law" to Moses. It could also be that in some period women actually performed circumcisions, although this duty later devolved upon men (e.g. Gen. xvii 23); for this we have no evidence, however, apart from Exod. iv 24-6. Equally speculatively, the Israelites may have considered Midianite/Kenite women partic- ularly hard-boiled: cf. Jael (Judg. iv-v), Adah and Zillah (Gen. iv 23-4, assuming a link between Cain [Gen. iv 17] and the Kenites) and perhaps Kozbi (Num. xxv 6-8). The Yahwistic stories of Cain and his bloodthirsty descendant Lamech in Gen. iv may also attribute to the Kenites as a whole a strong interest in blood vengeance. This in turn is suggestive, in the light of the protective "sign" which Yahweh gives to Cain, but it is hard to see how circumcision could serve this func- tion, since humanity is already clothed (Gen. iii 21). A more likely candidate for the mark of Cain is the "cut off corner" of the hair typical of certain desert dwellers, who, as it happens, also practiced circumcision (Jer. ix 24-5); there may even be a connection between these customs, as in South Arabia (B. Thomas, Arabia Felix [New York, 1932], pp. 72-3). 509</page><page sequence="16">WILLIAM H. PROPP hata-n as Moses and those who identify him as the son are equally correct. Our story chronicles a shift in meaning-in iv 25 hdtdn "bridegroom/circumcised" is addressed to the symbolically cir- cumcised Moses, but in verse 26 it applies to the actually circum- cised child (lammulot). Note, however, that although Exod. iv 24-6 is the etiology of the expression hatan ddmlm, it is not necessarily J's etiology of the practice of infant circumcision (pace Wellhausen). To summarize so far: although Yahweh commands Moses to return to Egypt (Exod. iv 19), he still holds him accountable for the death of the slain Egyptian. Zipporah sheds the blood of their son and dabs Moses' penis with it, thereby expiating her husband's sin. This ancient deed is supposedly why a circumcised child is called "bridegroom of bloodiness". Contrary to the view of almost all exegetes, Exod. iv 24-6 is well integrated within the J narrative, inasmuch as it points backward to the murder of the Egyptian (Exod. ii 11-12). As we shall see directly, it also points forward to the mighty deeds of the Exodus-at least in the received Torah, and most likely in the original J document as well. In Exod. v we begin the chain of events leading directly to Pharaoh's decision to let Israel leave Egypt. The culmination, prior to the crossing of the Sea, is the paschal rite prescribed in Exod. xii 1-28, 42-50, xiii 3-10, the first observance of which is concurrent with the slaughter of the firstborn of Egypt. Exod. xii 44, 48 enun- ciate a key requirement for future generations: "Any slave of a man, a purchase for money-if you circumcise him, then he may eat of it... If a sojourner resides with you and makes a pesah55 to Yahweh, every male of his must be circumcised, and then he may approach to make it and be like the native of the land. None uncir- cumcised may eat it." Josh. iii-v also connects circumcision and the paschal ceremony. In chs iii-iv the Israelites cross the Jordan River, which splits for them just like the Red Sea. In Josh. v 2-8 Joshua commands the males, who were not circumcised in the desert, to circumcise them- selves "again...a second time" with flint knives (cf. Exod. iv 25) at the "Mount of Foreskins" (verse 3). Then they celebrate the pesah at Gilgal (Josh. v 10-11). This narrative, too, implies that only the circumcised may celebrate the pesah. 55 Because the meaning is uncertain, I have merely transliterated pesah. "Passover" is probably wrong, and the most likely rendering is "protection"; see J. Licht, "Pesah", Encyclopaedia Biblica (Hebrew) 6 (Jerusalem, 1971), col. 515. 510</page><page sequence="17">THAT BLOODY BRIDEGROOM We do not know whether the J document told of the paschal ceremony and of the slaying of the first-born; J seems to be absent from Exod. xi-xiii.56 But there must have been some narration of the departure from Egypt, and, in the light of Exod. xii 44, 48 and Josh. v 2-11, it is hard to deny that the circumcision of Exod. iv 24- 6 functions as a prelude to the paschal night (cf. de Groot [n. 13], p. 16). Were Moses and his son uncircumcised, they would be ineligible to participate in the paschal meal and the departure from Egypt. The paschal symbolism in Exod. iv 24-6 is not confined to the circumcision. H. P. Smith has drawn parallels between the use of blood in Exod. iv 25 and in xii 22; in both higgzac denotes the application of blood to ward off a deadly, supernatural attack (cf. ibn Ezra).57 Thus we arrive at the following parallels: Moses' first- born, whose blood substitutes for Moses', foreshadows the paschal lamb, slain as a substitute for the first-born of Israel.58 Another paschal motif in Exod. iv 24-6 is that the Deity implicitly attacks at night (note mdlon "night-stop"), just as the tenth plague and the protective paschal rite take place by night. That RJE59 was alert to these resonances is manifest in his insertion of our story immediately after the threat to Pharaoh's first-born (iv 23), for this was not the only possible location (cf. Kosmala [n. 18]). It is in fact this splice that raises the possibility that in the redacted Torah it is Moses' son who is attacked, just as the sons of Israel and Egypt are threatened during the first paschal night.60 56 For a defense of this somewhat heretical view, see my forthcoming commen- tary on Exodus. 57 See n. 18. The connection between these two acts already is intuited by Exod. Rab. xix 5, which recounts the mixing of the blood of the paschal lamb with that of the newly circumcised Israelites. 58 Smith's inference that Moses' hesitation to sacrifice his own son [!] is what evokes the divine wrath is too extreme, but there may be a symbolic or vestigial connection between circumcision and child sacrifice, as in the Phoenician frag- ment cited above. Note, too, that the Exodus is associated with the consecration of the firstborn (Exod. xiii 1-15), a practice that may have evolved from child sacrifice to Yahweh (cf. Gen. xxii; Exod. xxii 28; Ezek. xx 25-6; Mic. vi 6-7) and that Abraham and Isaac are connected with both circumcision (Gen. xvii [P]) and a critique of child sacrifice (Gen. xxii [E]). 59 That is, the compiler of the J and E sources; see most recently R. E. Fried- man, Who Wrote the Bible? (New York, 1987), p. 87. 60 By joining verses 23 and 24, RJE produced ambiguity as to the victim of the Deity's attack (cf. L. Kaplan, " 'And the Lord Sought to Kill Him' (Exod. 4:24) Yet Once Again", HAR 5 [1981] pp. 65-74). The contiguity with the threat to 511</page><page sequence="18">WILLIAM H. PROPP If the original J document legislated the paschal rite and told of the slaying of the first-born, then Exod. iv 24-6 already functioned as a foreshadowing. But what if J did not contain these features? Would the story's adumbration of the paschal night be just a happy coincidence? Probably not. First, the Yahwist may have derived Exod. iv 24- 6, or its essentials, from an oral or written source which did go on to tell of the tenth plague and the protective paschal ritual. Secondly, there is a deeper background in Israelite tradition that likely played a role in shaping our tale prior to its being set down by the Yahwist. Several scholars have persuasively argued that the narrative in Josh. iii-iv, with its clergy parading the ark, river cross- ing, erection of monuments, mass circumcision, paschal celebra- tion and theophany, is the "myth" behind a ritual, namely, the paschal rite as observed at Gilgal.61 If there were periodic mass cir- cumcisions at the "Mount of Foreskins" prior to or during the spring paschal ceremony, accompanied by the slaying of lambs, application of their blood to the doorposts and a commemoration of the threat to the first-born of Israel and Egypt, we might expect stories about the Exodus to contain circumcision allusions and stories about circumcision to contain Exodus allusions, irrespective of narrative context. In other words, even if the Yahwist did not tell of the death of the first-born of Egypt, he and his readers may have been culturally conditioned to think of the paschal night when writing or reading about a circumcision-especially one involving Moses. Note that paschal symbolism does not dominate the story entirely; otherwise, it would be the son of Moses under attack (as RJE implies), not Moses himself. Rather, the symbolism is subor- dinate to the narrator's immediate interest: to account for the Pharaoh's son in v.23 creates the odd impression that Yahweh is acting out his threat to Pharaoh upon Moses' son (cf. ibn Ezra; J. Blau, "Hatan damim", Tarbiz 26 [1956-7], pp. 1-2; Kosmala [n. 18]; Greenberg [n. 16], p. 113). It is as if the unleashed powers of destruction turn at once upon the nearest object, the child, just as during the paschal night the Israelite first-born are endangered along with the first-born of Egypt (Blau). But the victim in JE could just as easily be Moses, since the son is unmentioned in the episode until verse 25. 61 H. J. Kraus, "Gilgal.

Moreover, the emphasis on the guilt of the father, while it mars the analogy with the tenth plague, nevertheless plays a vital connective role in the redacted Torah. Through the transfer of blood from the son's penis to the father's and the transfer of the epithet hatan ddmim from father to son, Exod. iv 24-6 links Moses' limited, unauthorized act of violent protest, killing one Egyptian taskmaster, with Yahweh's grand act of violent protest, the killing of all the first-born of Egypt. And as Moses' deed causes him to flee to the desert in which he meets the Deity, so Yahweh's deeds against Egypt will enable Israel to escape from Egypt and arrive at his holy mountain. How did circumcision, whose connection with marriage we have already traced, come to be associated with the paschal rite? As we learn from Gen. xxxiv 14-17 (J) and Gen. xvii 10-14 (P), circumci- sion was a sign of Israelite identity. Not that the lack of a foreskin was uniquely Israelite-many neighboring peoples were also cir- cumcised. Rather, the operation acquired special significance as a rite of socio-religious initiation and a perpetual reminder of the covenant (see Propp [n. 20], p. 357). It betokened not only the young man's readiness for marriage, but his undertaking all the rights and responsibilities of an adult Israelite male. In general, for cultures that perform the operation at puberty, circumcision is a rite of passage into social and religious adulthood.62 Just as a modern Bar Mitzvah marks his religious adulthood by performing a religious obligation, reading from the Torah, so the newly cir- cumcised Israelite carried out his greatest religious obligation, the springtime commemoration of the national liberation from Egypt.63 It is no coincidence, then, that Moses is symbolically circumcised, and his son actually circumcised, as they set out to join the people of Israel and participate in the first pesah. It is striking in how many respects the whole tale of Moses' Midianite sojourn is comparable to the rites of male initiation of 62 A. van Gennep, The Rites of Passage (French original 1909; Chicago, 1960), pp. 70-3, 81, 85-6. For a convenient and vast summary of the data, see L. H. Gray, "Circumcision (Introductory)", in Hastings (n. 48), pp. 659-70, esp. p. 662. For ethnographic bibliography on circumcision, see Propp (n. 20), p. 355, n. 1. 63 We do not know whether the Israelites devised a rite of male adolescent initiation to fill the ritual vacuum created by the transfer of circumcision to infancy. 513</page><page sequence="20">WILLIAM H. PROPP other cultures.64 The story of the young man who goes alone into the desert, who meets a dangerous spirit that reveals to him his life's mission, who is symbolically injured and returns to his tribe forever changed by his ordeal-this is familiar terrain to ethnographers, some of whom attribute the pattern's ubiquity to universal psychological impulses.65 Such ceremonies frequently have elements of danger, acted out or real, and feature a symbolic death or rebirth into adulthood.66 In our story Moses nearly dies, and at the end of the story he is symbolically circumcised, i.e., becomes a child again. There have already been two "births" of Moses in J-literally to his Hebrew biological mother and figuratively to his Egyptian foster mother-so it is fitting that his Midianite wife, another female savior, should apply to him an epithet that in the author's day was applied to a circumcised boy and daub him with the blood of circumcision. In a sense she func- tions as father-in-law (hoten "circumciser") rather than mother, but, inasmuch as the persons of Moses and the son merge through sharing of blood and the epithet hatan ddmim, one might also see Zipporah as a mother figure for Moses as well as for the child (recall that we above detected Oedipal overtones in the story).67 This story marks the last time Moses will require female protection; now, symbolically circumcised, he attains full manhood as a literary character.68 In sum, the story of Yahweh's attack upon Moses is a nugget in which we find embedded fragments of the complex history of cir- 64 Cf.

Turner, The Forest of Symbols (Ithaca, 1967), p. 96. 67 Our story resonates with H. Ammar's description and analysis of an Egyp- tian circumcision custom: "The operation is not suddenly performed on the child, but the mother...may attempt to prepare him gradually for the event by caressing his organ and playfully endeavouring to separate the foreskin from the glans. While doing this, she would hum words to the effect that what she is doing will help to make him to become a man amongst men. In a community with rigid sex dichotomy, it is not surprising to find that it is a great fright, or a source of resent- ment, for a small boy to be threatened by his mother that she will circumcise him...Such a threat by a parent of the opposite sex to the child...is...used to help the child in identifying himself with the parent of his own sex" (Growing Up in an Egyptian Village [New York, 1966], p. 121). 68 For a psychoanalytical reading of circumcision as marking detachment from the mother, see G.

The evolution of the tradition was something like the following: originally circumcision was performed upon adolescents, was associated with marriage and likely betokened social and religious maturity; from this (pre-Israelite?) phase comes the application of the epithet hatan ddmim to the initiate. Later, when adulthood involved participation in the cult of Yahweh, the opera- tion became a prerequisite not just for marriage, but for celebration of the paschal rite; this stage is reflected in the (symbolic) circumci- sion of Moses and in the placement of our story before the narration of the Exodus. Later still, circumcision was transferred to childhood or infancy, but the old associations lingered. The application of the term hatan ddmim to a young boy became obscure, but the bloodied child became a symbol of the paschal night, when the endangered first-born of Israel were saved by the blood of a lamb. Finally, the Yahwist (or his source) used the story as part of a biography of Moses. To explain the anomalous use of hatan ddmlm, he told of the ddmim incurred by Zipporah's hatan Moses for trying to save Israel, or at least one Israelite, without divine authorization. In its current context, Exod. iv 24-6 describes an awesome rite of family solidarity performed on the eve of the Exodus.69 It simul- taneously marks a boy's initiation into the people of Israel and his parents' passage into the state of parenthood. On the eve of the Exodus from Egypt, Zipporah performs an act that implicitly equates father and child, binding the generations through the bloodied organ of generation.70 Appendix 1: Islamic circumcision Consider the following descriptions of Egyptian circumcision rites: "In the Eastern Desert, among the CAbabda, a circumcision festival may be combined with that of a marriage. They call both 69 Maybe Zipporah and Moses are even performing an actual Israelite ritual, wherein a mother applies the blood of a child to her husband's penis, in token of the former association between marriage and circumcision-they are, as it were, renewing their vows. This speculation is unnecessary to our analysis, however. Narrative patterns can mirror ritual patterns, and, while some take this to imply that every myth is born of a ritual, the relationship is more complex. When similarities are discernible, a ritual may have generated a myth, a myth may have generated a ritual, or myth and ritual may have drawn upon common aspects of the human imagination. 70 My thanks to A.

PROPP festivals indifferently Cirs, the ordinary Arabic name for a wedding. In this case, the hut, which is later to be inhabited by the newly-wed couple, is pitched for both the groom and the boys about to be cir- cumcised" (G. W. Murray, Sons of Ishmael [London, 1935], p. 176). "One cannot fail to see the connection between circumcision and marriage, the former being a preparation for the latter, and the similarities between the public celebration of the two events are striking... A circumcised boy or girl is normally referred to as 'bridegroom' or 'bride'...the circumcised boy as well as the bridegroom must visit the mosque or gaze on the Nile. The belief is that on...circumcision or wedding a person could be deprived of fertility and potency, and hence great care must be taken to avoid the evil eye" (Ammar [n. 67], p. 122). Among the Rwala bedouin, A. Musil reported that most songs sung at circumcision festivals were love and wedding songs (The Manners and Customs of the Rwala Bedouins [New York, 1928], pp. 246-55). In the Hejaz and Nejd, a circumcision festival became an occasion for young women to display themselves to the young men (references in J. Henninger, "Nochmals: Eine eigenartige Beschneidungsform in Siidwestara- bien", Anthropos 35-6 [1940-1], p. 375, n. 44). The same was true among the Mahra of South Arabia: "To-day a decent interval [between marriage and circumcision] is allowed. Men and women foregather round desert fires. Eight or ten of the most presentable females are paraded and the men declare who is the most beautiful of them, while the remaining ladies protest characteristically" (B. Thomas [n. 54], p. 72, n. 2). Palestinian boys about to be circum- cised used to proceed on horseback, followed by a pitch-fork dressed as a bride (H. Granqvist, Birth and Childhood Among the Arabs [Helsinki, 1947], p. 200); Granqvist also observes that circumcision and marriage festivals may be combined, although the reason she cites is economic (p. 205). Finally, I was discussing the present arti- cle with a colleague from Turkey, Hasan Kayali; in surprise he told me he never understood why in Turkish circumcision is called sun- net diigiinii "sunna of marriage". While these associations between circumcision and marriage do not require that the two rites were once more closely associated- after all, the alteration of genitalia might simply call to mind a boy's future marriage-they are highly suggestive in the light of the uses of Arabic htn and Hebrew htn described here. 516</page><page sequence="23">THAT BLOODY BRIDEGROOM Appendix 2. Circumcision as an ordeal This complex matter has been given detailed, critical treatment by J. Henninger ("Eine eigenartige Beschneidungsform in Siidwestarabien", Anthopos 33 [1938], pp. 952-8; "Nochmals: Eine eigenartige Beschneidungsform in Siidwestarabien", Anthopos 35-6 [1940-1], pp. 370-6), although he is more concerned with the flay- ing of the lower abdomen as part of a premarital ordeal than with premarital circumcision per se. Nevertheless, his data and arguments are pertinent to our discussion. Henninger shows that some reports of the antenuptial circumci- sion ordeal must be viewed skeptically, for often Western observers have simply transmitted anonymous hearsay. E.g.: "With the Mahra tribe [of South Arabia] male circumcision at one time was carried out on the eve of a man's marriage" (Thomas, Arabia Felix [see Appendix 1]); no source is cited. Sometimes the reporters themselves are skeptical: "They [the Fuqara, south of Teima] have been heard to say, among other stories, that the Beni-Murrah prac- tice circumcision quite differently. It is before his marriage that the young man is circumcised. Along the stomach, from the navel to the membrum virile, the skin is detached and lifted off... His fiancee watches him, and she refuses to accept him as husband if she sees him lacking in courage" ([A. J.] Jaussen and [R.] Savignac, Coutumes des Fuqara [1914], p. 20; quoted in Henninger [1938], p. 953). Henninger observes that the Murra live some 1200 km south-west of the Fuqara, and that in Thomas's time they circum- cised at the age of five or six (Arabia Felix, p. 224) and hence is dubious of the veracity of this tale. The following case illustrates well the difficulties faced in sorting through travelers' reports. C. M. Doughty was told by Mohammed Aly, an informant he clearly mistrusted, that the Harb, neighbors of the Fuqara, practiced this same custom; but when he asked the Harb themselves, they answered, " 'Lord!...that so strange things should be reported of us poor people! but Khalil, these things are told of el-Kahtan' ", a far-off nation: Travels in Arabia Deserta (Lon- don, 1921) 1, pp. 128-9. Should we believe Mohammed Aly, or the beni-Harb, who might have reasons to disavow their own custom? Perhaps we may find a solution in a report by G. W. Murray. Muhammad Hueir, sheikh of the Dhuwwi Hasan, told Murray that his people and their neighbors, the Dhuwwi Barakat, held 517</page><page sequence="24">WILLIAM H. PROPP periodic circumcisions involving removal of more than the foreskin as a test of fortitude; the sheikh's brother Hasan, aged seventeen, was due to undergo the ordeal and told Murray he was not looking forward to it ("Circumcision Festivals in Arabia and East Africa", Man 24 [1924], p. 48). Here we have two presumably reliable infor- mants, and Murray suggests that the erroneous attribution of this custom to the beni Harb by Burton (does he mean Doughty?) results from confusion with the Dhuwwi Hasan, who dwell among them. We possess other trustworthy accounts, particularly for South Arabia. "Deferred circumcision is apparently the general rule of these Tihama tribes, who regard the ordeal as a test of personal courage... The men do not marry until they have been circum- cised, and the bride-elect apparently has the right of rejecting a man who flinches" (H. St J. B. Philby, Arabian Highlands [New York, 1976], p. 449). These qualifying "apparently"s do not encourage credence, but Philby goes on, "Musa [ibn Hamdan, Sheikh of Ahl Hassan and Philby's guide]...was looking forward to his own experience of the barbaric custom with every intention of making his girl proud of him" (p. 50). For other reliable reports from as long ago as 1772 (Niebuhr), see Henninger (1938), pp. 954-5. We also have an eyewitness account of antenuptial circumcision from Palestine and Jordan: "Hamdiye had explained that among the Taamre Bedouin also the custom prevails of giving a present to the one who is to be circumcised... 'When the boy is offered to the circumciser he...says to him: "Speak my son! Thou shalt have my daughter (or, animals, or money)! Be witnesses ye who are present, that my daughter is to be for him!" The father of the boy says: "I accept her!"-No bride price is given.' " This might be a sym- bolic, even jesting betrothal, but the report continues, "Hamdiye says that she has seen it herself in Transjordania, that there a youth is circumcised later and as soon as the wound is healed he marries the girl" (Granqvist [see Appendix 1], p. 201). "In Palestine", reports Granqvist, "it is not considered proper for a man to marry if he has not been circumcised" (p. 201) and "it is a shame to be the descendant of an uncircumcised person" (p. 208). What is lacking from this discussion is testimony from the Arabs' own literature. A qualified researcher should take up the matter and try to ascertain the antiquity and geographical range of premarital circumcision. 518</page></plain_text>
