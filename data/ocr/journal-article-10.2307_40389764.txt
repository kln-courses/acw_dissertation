Price: $29.95 Stress, as a sum of physical and mental responses to an unacceptable disparity between real or imagined per- sonal experience and personal expectations, generates strong emotions, like anxiety, anger, disgust, or sadness. In the book "Dancing for Health," J. L. Hanna shows how dance can serve as a means of overcoming and preventing stress situations in different contemporary and historically remote cultures. J. L. Hanna is a world known anthropologist of the dance. As a dancer and researcher for over fifty years, she studied dance in its multiple manifestations and locations, from Africa to America. Since her Ph.D. thesis on the Nigerian Ubakala to the present volume, she published numerous books and articles in thirteen countries and in several languages, from which the most important seems to be "To Dance Is Human. The Theory of Nonverbal Communication" (Chicago 1987). "To dance is human" can also be introduced as a motto of the presented book. The author herself takes this sentence again in the Introduction: "Indeed, to dance is to be human" (14), and considers dance as "human behavior composed ... of purposeful, intention- ally rhythmical, and culturally patterned sequences of nonverbal body movements other than ordinary motor activities" (30). The dance is an appropriate means to deal with stressful situations. "As a text in motion" (33), it expresses, through visualization and embodiment, the thoughts and feelings, what the words cannot do. Dis- tancing individuals from their emotional experience, it regulates the core affects and helps people in their struggle against the stress. As the author states: "Giving voice to grief is frequently part of healing" (33). But the dance movement can also have physical consequences because the dancing is able to provoke "a morphine-like effect in reducing the perception of pain" (46). The number of examples supporting the arguments of the author is grouped in two parts: one, describing the historical and non- Western dance-stress relations, and the other, presenting the Western dance-stress relations. The first encompasses five chapters concerning: the religious aspects of dance, its purifying efficacy, the resolving of the life crisis, the overcoming conflicts, and the renewing of the time through the dance. The second treats the West dancing from the perspective of the theatrical aspects of dance, the professional and amateur Western dancers, and the therapeutic proprieties of dance. The stressful events and behaviors find their expli- cation in the system of beliefs.

Duncan, or the Japanese butoh reflecting on the disas- trous consequences of the nuclear explosion in Hiroshi- ma. The dance can serve as a means of the expression of self being, for example, by homosexuals. It can reduce stress through the inversion of sexual or social roles on the stage. Dancing can also be stressful, especially for profes- sional dancers. They are constantly under pressure of competition, they have to battle for their position in the group, they struggle with contusions, they have to take care of the body weight, they have stage fright, and often they are exposed to stress because of strained relations between the dancers and the director. The carrier of the dancer is precarious, and his lifestyle - according to Hanna - is comparable to life in the religious order. The situation changes by dancing for pleasure. By nonprofessional dancers, dance helps the individuals to reduce stress through enlarging the physical capacity and to escape the stress through the immersion in dance. Dancing can alternate the state of consciousness, prevent the sentiment of alienation, build up infectious joy and identification with a culture or group. All forms of dancing are relevant: Argentinean Tangos, Slam Dancing, Rock and Disco, Hip Hop, Swing, Aerobic and Folk Dancing. The last section concerns the therapeutic role of dance. Dance /Movement Therapy is a process which helps the physical, emotional, and cognitive integration of the person. The therapy supposes the need of ex- posing of the client on the traumatic information and the modification of the inadequate beliefs about events. Symbolism constitutes the most important element in dance therapy: it builds the bridge between the inner and the outer world of the patient permitting psychical distance to personal occupations. Dance therapy has a capacity of improving the balance, the sense of rhythm, and the memory. It vivifies the personal interactions, facilitates the taking of decisions and initiatives. The book brings a large number of information about dance in stressful situations, its role as a therapeutic means as well as a way of emotional, intellectual, and esthetic fulfillment. It underlines the therapeutic role of the dance which was considered usually as above all social or religious. However, the illustrative cases taken from very different places and times rise up important questions. Can we put all these examples together under the common label of stress? Can we compare an African tribal society with the New York Ballet Ensemble? What means the word "stress" for both of them? Are they in the same way conscious of it? The large number of examples convinces that dance can be a good therapeutic means, but one could expect a more developed section about dance therapy. In sum, the book gives a good idea about the importance of dance for health, and it constitutes an important contribution to dance researches. Jacek Jan Pawlik cific Northwest. Change and Tradition. Münster: West- fälisches Museum für Naturkunde, 2005. 183 pp. ISBN 978-3-924590-85-7. Preis: €21.80 In order to improve the visitors' knowledge of dif- ferent Native North American cultures, the Westphalian State Museum of Natural History in Münster organized a temporary exhibition on the Northwest Coast culture area in addition to their long-time exhibition on the indigenous people of the Plains and Prairie region. The museum also published an accompanying book in a bilingual edition, which is divided into clearly arranged short chapters. The editor and director of the museum is the author of the first three chapters: "Diversity in Nature and Culture" gives a brief introduction to general topics, such as the settlement of North America, the culture areas, and an example of an indigenous origin myth. In "Landscape and Environment - Coast and Forest" he briefly describes some aspects of the Northwest Coast culture area, such as the geography, the climate, the flora and fauna, as well as the history of the natives. "Abundance of Food from the Water" is the main topic of the third chapter. Annika Hendricks contributes the following two chapters, which deal with the whale hunt. This dan- gerous endeavor was only undertaken by a few ethnic groups in the south part of the area, whereas other North- west Coast natives just butchered animals. Such details are the subject of "The Historic Whale Hunt and the Im- portance of the Whale." The second, shorter chapter on "The Yuquot Whalers' Shrine" is dedicated to a roofed structure which contained about 80 anthropomorphic figures and four whales made of cedar as well as human skulls. George Hunt, a Kwakwaka'wakw (Kwakiutl) who worked with the anthropologist Franz Boas, bought the shrine from some Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka) living nearby. Thus, since 1905 this material proof of religious aspects of the whale hunt belongs to the collections of the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The Nuu-chah-nulth which live next to the historic site of the shrine want it to be returned so that it may become an integral part of a cultural center. Such a plan makes sense not only because it might lead to positive results for local culture and economy, but also because the purchase was never generally accepted among the Nuu-chah-nulth and the museum in New York exhibits only a small model instead of the shrine itself. The next seven chapters are written by the editor. The first picks up the thematic thread of food sources in "Today's Importance of Fish as Food," but the following ones mainly focus on material culture. Indigenous boat building is illustrated in "The Canoe - Made from Cedar Wood," whereas "Village, House, and Family as a Refer- ence" also includes social aspects aside from house con- struction. The collecting and processing of cedar bark is presented in "Clothing - Made from Cedar Bark." This material was also used for various other items which are among those mentioned in "Equipment - Baskets, Ropes, and Boxes."
