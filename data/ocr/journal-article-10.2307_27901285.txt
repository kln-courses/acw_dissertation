<plain_text><page sequence="1">VALUE AND AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE IN the present paper I do not propose to attempt to dis cuss the problem of value in its detail. Full discussion would entail a book, for there is a very large literature on the subject. I shall chiefly try to state in the earlier part of the paper one point of view as shortly and clearly as possible. Only a few proper names will appear. In the last few pages of the latter part I shall apply to aesthetics the conclusions arrived at in the first part. There are three possible views of the status of value. One (1) is that value is essentially a quality of things, belonging to them independently of all relation to experi encing mind. Another (2) is that value is mental, and is a quality of mind or mental states only. The third (3) is that value consists in a relation between mind and non mental objects. Examples of all these three views can easily be found, but the second of them is nowadays not very fashionable, so that the real living issue lies between the first and the third. The first is, roughly speaking, a view which is shared by commonsense and by philosophers like Professor Moore, Professor Laird, and, more recently, by Dr. Olaf Stapledon in his book, A Modem Theory of Ethics. I say "roughly speaking" because the commonsense view that value is in things, (e.g. that value is in the food or the beautiful sky) cannot be said to be identical at least with the</page><page sequence="2">VALUE AND AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE 181 views of Mr. Laird or Mr. Stapledon ; nor are the views of the three philosophers I have mentioned identical. But they all do have the one important element in common. The third view has been represented in recent times by such thinkers as von Ehrenfels and Meinong, Alexander, Hobhouse, R. B. Perry, and very many others. Here again, there is a good deal of variety of opinion regarding the particular aspect of mind involved. Sometimes it is said to be desire, sometimes it is feeling, sometimes it is mental dispositions, or "presumptions/' or "assumptions," sometimes it is called "interest." But all the thinkers who hold the kind view are agreed that value cannot belong to an object in itself : value is object-in-relation-to-mind, or it is a mental process. In discussing the problem we must begin by admitting that some values may be indubitably mental. Whether or not value is in essence dependent on, or independent of, cognising mind, will not affect the question. This will become clearer later. Of mental values the values of knowledge, of volition, of friendship and love are obvious examples. It may in fact be that the highest values which we know are mental, and that the Summum Bonum con sists of mental activities or of some organisation of mental activities. Whether this is really so or not we need not discuss, for our problem, quite definitely, is not, What is the supreme value or good? Nor is it, What are the characteristics of mental values? Our main problem is, What is the essential nature of value-any value? Does value essentially depend for its existence upon a mind ? Or can an object, or an objective process, be said to possess value entirely on its own account, independently of any experiencing mind or minds? Let us take a simple instance. It is a cold day, and I</page><page sequence="3">182 THE MONIST come shivering into a room where burns a bright warm fire. I spontaneously say "Good! How lovely! What genial warmth!" and I spread my hands and body lux uriously before it. Here is a simple value-experience. Wherein inheres the value which is the object of my value-experience ? Unreflective commonsense may say that the geniality, the "goodness," of the warmth is in the fire, just as un reflective commonsense may think of gold or diamonds as intrinsically precious. But the slightest reflection, even of unreflective commonsense, casts doubt upon this assump tion. It is equally difficult to think of the fire's "goodness" as existing all by itself, as to think of gold and diamonds as being precious apart from some one's use of them. Commonsense reflection-and philosophic reflection-is in clined to conclude, then, that the value or "goodness" of the warmth arises through some relation of the fire's warmth to us. But such a conclusion is only a beginning. For what kind of relation to us ? And to what part of us ? Is the relation of the heat of the fire to our experiencing mind? To our desire? To our pleasure, Or is the relation to our organism? An answer which is very often given by philosophers is that already referred to, that value somehow arises in relation, and only in relation, to our mental experiencing. If I do not experience the heat in any way, if I do not cognise it, or desire it, or feel it as pleasant, its peculiar quality of value seems to vanish into nothing.1 It is, then, extremely difficult, if we think of the prob lem in these terms, to avoid being led to the conclusion that experiencing in some sense constitutes value. If we think experience away, the value seems to disappear. This con clusion seems so natural and inevitable that even the 1 Cf. Spinoza's Ethics, Part III, Prop. IX.</page><page sequence="4">VALUE AND AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE 183 argument that in knowing value we cannot make it, be cause in knowing it it must already be gillen for us to know, does not succeed in convincing us that value is not, somehow or other, connected with mentality. So we adopt a new procedure and make a new variation. We say, now, not that mind's cognition, desire, and what-not constitutes its object as valuable, but that value belongs not to the object but to the complex mind-in-relation-to object. So that any difficulty of mind's "making" the thing it cognises is partly overcome. The value belongs to the whole. The whole, and nothing less, possesses value. And if we say this, we are of course obliged to say too that when we think we are valuing anything which is completely independent of mind, we are in error. What we value is not the warmth nor is it simply our own enjoyment of it. The true-though concealed or "reces sive"-object of our valuation is our-experience-of-the warmth. Expressed symbolically we get Value Valuation of S O Subj ect i ve Obj ect i ve Constituent Constituent In this case, then, the mind's relation to an object (O) constitutes a value, but it does not constitute O as valuable. For mind's process itself is a part of what is valuable. This account may be consistent as far as it goes. But is it the true analysis ? Consider the case more closely. Is it the heat of the fire in relation to our experiencing, which we value ? Is its relation to our experiencing an essential factor ? Surely it is not. What we really value is neither the heat of the fire in itself, nor our cognition or desire or enjoyment of the heat of the fire, but, simply, a process of our organism caused by the fire. It is not the fire in</page><page sequence="5">184 THE MONIST relation to mind which is significant, essentially, from the point of view of the problem of value, but fire in relation to organism. I am, as they say, "frozen stiff": my body needs warmth for the fulfilment of its functions. And my desire for warmth, and my cognition of and pleasure in warmth, are experiences of bodily process. As the warmth "gratefully" penetrates my cold fingers and limbs I ex perience the restoration of bodily functions. This is what I really cognise, want, desire, enjoy (though I may un reflectively think it is the fire itself, the cause), and the value consists, it would seem, in this process of organic fulfillment. My enjoyment, it is true, is always present when I am aware of this positive value, but this is no more than saying that when I am aware of value I am aware of it, or that I cannot be pleasantly conscious of value with out pleasant-consciousness occurring. It is in no wise im plied that this book which I see has a mental constituent because in order to be an object of my awareness I must be aware of it. This is the essence of an argument of Dr. Moore's in Principia Ethica. An even more convincing instance, perhaps, is that of definite relief from some bodily tension, as that of a dis tended boil. What is wanted in such a case, what is adjudged good, is just bodily relief and nothing else. It is not enjoyment of relief, or even absence of (mental2) unpleasure; what is wanted is something entirely non mental, belonging to the body, localised relief. Feeling supervenes. As Mr. Laird says,3 "When human beings think about their values, to be sure, they naturally consult their feelings-naturally, but not, perhaps, wisely. If they cherish vipers, it is surely the character of what they 2 We must not of course confuse the organic pain of tension with mental experience. 3 The Idea of Value, p. 107.</page><page sequence="6">VALUE AND AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE 185 favour, rather than their amiable frame of mind, that really does concern them." Pleasure and unpleasure, then, fall on the subject- and not on the object-side, on the side of valuations, and not on the side of value. We are never aware of a value but there is awareness, and moreover, pleasurable or painful awareness. Valuation, then, implies pleasure or unpleasure (let us ignore, for brevity's sake, unpleasure). But valuation is of course not mere pleasure, for such cannot exist by itself. The pleasure is part of a psychosis, and valuation is a psychosis involving cognition as well as conation and hedonic tone. Indeed, valuations may be divided into two grades according to the level of complexity or otherwise of the cognitive aspects. If on the one hand the cognitive aspect is confined to a relatively simple state of awareness, with prominence of hedonic tone, there is one level of valuation. If on the other hand cognition is highly critical and discriminative, as when we analyse, say, the different elements of value in an experience of music, there is valu ation on a different level. The former is direct intuitive appreciation, the latter involves a rationale of apprecia tion. We cannot of course draw a hard and fast line be tween the first and the second, for the simplest cognition we know is to some extent discriminative, whilst critical analytical judgments are just a turning over, an examining and a discriminative retasting of the intuitive experience. If value is not, as we have argued, in essence mental, is not necessarily inclusive of a mental factor (though it may be) we shall be tempted to try out a generalisation which will include all physical, and not only organically</page><page sequence="7">186 THE MONIST physical, things. Such a generalisation would be exempli fied in the notion of "Natural Election" of which Profes sor Laird makes a great deal in his recent book, The Idea of Value. "Natural Election," says Mr. Laird, following a hint in Montaigne, "is the principle of Non-indifference in nature. I take it to be evident that if two things in nature are utterly indifferent to one another, neither, in relation to the other, has any value at all. If, on the other hand, they are not indifferent to one another, it is likely, if not absolutely certain, that a value exists for one or the other or for both of them, at least of a relative kind."4 By "indifference" Mr. Laird does not mean anything peculiar ly psychological, nor anything peculiarly biological, al though both of these may be included in the general no tion of natural election. The general idea which Mr. Laird has in mind is something like that of "attraction" in physics, or "affinity" between chemical bodies. The attrac tion of iron filings for magnets is one of his favorite illustrations. But the principle of natural election is wide enough to be inclusive of all things, inanimate, mental. Not man only, but cats, and, "if cats, why not beetles, and if beetles, why not potatoes, and if potatoes, why not magnets and filings? Magnets do concern filings; and if it does not matter whether or not we are aware of our likings, why should it matter whether or not there are any likings at all? If things are concerned with, and take account of, one another, is not that enough? So far as I can see, it is a mere dogma that values are peculiarly characteristic either of men or of cats."5 Dis 4 Idea of Value, pp. 92-3. 5 Ibid. p. 107.</page><page sequence="8">VALUE AND AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE 187 cussing the views of D. W. Prall6 and R. B. Perry7 he urges that, if "biology is admitted to 'provide the context' for psychological interest," if "natural election provides the context for biology," "we should not stop short at life any more than we should stop short at mind."8 Very likely Mr. Laird is right. There is no general or logical reason why we should stop short at living organisms. Physical "affinities" and "attractions" (as Mr. Laird very well knows and would agree) are of course dangerous and obscure notions, and we are apt to run off the rails if we think too naively of "affinities" between iron filings and magnets, or "attractions" between stones and the earth. But there is a growing open-mindedness to such notions (viz. such philosophies as those of Mr. Whitehead or Mr. Lloyd Morgan). We certainly cannot dismiss them. Natural election in a plain straightforward sense certainly exists, and is but another name for natural law. We cannot therefore gainsay its truth. On the other hand, in aesthetics, with which we are now concerned, we are interested in values which can be appreciated directly. And though sub-organic natural laws, affinities and attractions certainly exist, they cannot be ap preciated affectively by us in a direct way, though we may, by means of crude anthropomorphic metaphors, appreciate something which we take for them. This being so, we may here concentrate on the kind of values which we can appre ciate directly, namely those of the living organism which we know, and of the minds associated with such organisms. It is these values which genuinely matter in aesthetic ex perience. 6 In A Study in the Theory of Value, Univ, of California Publications in Philosophy, Vol. 3, No. 2, 1921, pp. 215, 227. 7 In General Theory of Value. Ibid. p. 106.</page><page sequence="9">188 THE MONIST The existence in a magnet of a "need" for iron filings, or in the earth for a stone, is problematical, obscure, doubt ful. The existence in the organism of needs (interpreted in a plain, straightforward, descriptive, biological, non psychological sense) is in no doubt at all. The organism needs a very specific and circumscribed kind of environ ment in order that it shall survive at all as an organism. And (positive) organic values are, we have said, just the fulfilments of organic needs. Let us return to consider this notion a little more fully. The theory that positive value consists in the fulfilment of needs of living organisms (or of higher entities, such as minds) has recently been ably expounded and defended by Dr. Olaf Stapledon in A Modem Theory of Ethics. My previous analysis is strongly influenced by the ideas in this work, with which I am in substantial agreement. Dr. Stapledon holds that the affective aspect of an act of valua tion is logically posterior to the cognitive and conative aspects of valuation. "Pleasure is consequent on conation. And conation (by which I mean a conscious activity), is consequent on a cognitive act of valuation which cognises the relation of the object to some behaviour-tendency. And the behaviour-tendency is itself essentially objective to any act of 'espousing' it, or desiring its fulfilment."9 This theory is based upon the "hormic" psychology. The organism is conceived as a teleological system and its teleological structure is the presupposition of conation. "The presupposition of every act of conation, whether 'blind' impulse or desire or fully self-conscious will, is a teleological activity or tendency distinct from the purely conative act itself. At the lowest level the activity is purely physiological; the impulse, in so far as it is mental 9 A Modern Theory of Ethics, p. 51.</page><page sequence="10">VALUE AND AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE 189 at all, is an acceptance of, or active espousal of, some activity of the body itself. Desire may set as its goal the realisation of some such purely physical teleological activ ity of the body. At higher levels the teleological activity may be psychical. The goal of desire, or of considered will, may be the fulfilment of some psychical capacity. But in this case, no less than in the others, the activity of tendency whose fulfilment is desired or willed is strictly objective to, and logically prior to, the mental act of will ing its fulfilment. For there to be any conscious conation at all there must be awareness of a hormic drive or tend ency, awareness vague or precise, true or erroneous. For ther to be not merely 'blind' impulse but explicit desire or will, there must be prevision, true or false, of the sup posed goal of the activity-prevision sometimes of an im mediate goal, at other times of a goal more remote."10 Again, "Every conative act, then, consists in the accept ance or espousal of some cognised hormic activity or tend ency; every case of feeling (pleasant or unpleasant) is consequent on the cognised success or failure of espoused hormic tendency. "We may conclude this psychological description by saying that: we feel because we 'espouse a cause'; we es pouse the cause because we cognise it as 'cause,' i.e. as a teleological process of something within our ken; and finally we cognise the teleological process as a teleological process because (apart from errors of cognition) it really is so."11 It is important to note that the description of teleology which Mr. Stapledon accepts, the description, namely, of Dr. Broad, does not contain the term "mind." Broad defines a teleological system as one which acts "as if it io Ibid., p. 87-88. u Ibid. p. 88.</page><page sequence="11">190 THE MONIST were designed for a purpose,"12 but it still "remains a question of fact whether the system was actually the result of a design in someone's mind." Artificial machines imply design, but organisms are teleological systems which seem to arise without design. The machine is a case of "ex ternal" teleology, the organism of "internal" teleology. Stapledon defines teleological activity as activity "which [whether or not it violates physical law] is as a matter of fact regulated in reference to a future state. In teleo logical activity events occur because they will produce or maintain a certain result."13 The typical case of our experience of value is, then, to repeat, when some hormic tendency of the organism is fulfilled or thwarted. This is an entirely non-mental pro cess, and itself constitutes positive or negative value. This bodily process is what we cognise, conate or espouse, and feel to be pleasant or unpleasant, as the case may be. It is likewise with the case of mind. We know that mind has tendencies and needs and that the fulfilment or thwarting of these brings pleasure or unpleasure. So too, there are mental values; and mental values, though mental, are just as objective to the act of their valuation. We can rejoice in our own intellectual or moral fulfilment. And as well as rejoicing in them, we can value them intellectually. We can think of them and judge of them and form philos ophies about them. We may go even further and value our valuation of values. The teleological activities of our organisms and our minds are the only values which we can directly appre ciate, but other beings besides our own possess intrinsic value. There are other human beings, there are animals and plants. By means of a very little sympathy and imagi 12 The Mind and its place in Nature, p. 61 sq. 13 A Modern Theory of Ethics, p. 83.</page><page sequence="12">VALUE AND AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE 191 nation and power of analogy, we may indirectly appreciate the intrinsic values of other human organisms and minds ; with a little more, the mental and organic values of animals, and with a very great deal more, just possibly, the organic values of plants. Beyond that there is no intrinsic value which can be appreciated in anything approaching an adequate or literal way, if at all. If tendency-fulfilment of inanimate nature can be said to be appreciated at all, it is only through the use of the most imperfect analogies. We have, as has been said, no real notion of the "affinities" of magnets for iron, of positive for negative poles, of stones for planets. Still less can we "feel" them. Of course we can have pleasurable cognis ance of inanimate happenings. But when we rejoice in ". . . . the keen Unpassioned beauty of a great machine" or in the tumbling waterfalls, or in the trickling, babbling streams, or in the terrible expressiveness of thunder and lightning, or in the peaceful sunset sky, we are (very often at least, and certainly in aesthetic experience) im puting values to these things, which are derived from other more direct experiences of our own values and those of other living beings. Certainly we rejoice in the waterfall or in the thunder: but it is their fused symbolism which is really significant for us. They do not in literal fact (or at least as far as we know) possess the values we apprehend "in" them. If it is aesthetic enjoyment we are seeking, good and well. If scientific truth, no. If the account we have given is correct, the several values which appear to be imaginatively "embodied" or "expressed"14 in an aesthetic object, as when we see a pic ture or hear music or read a poem, will be objective to the 14 I cannot stop here to attempt to define these and other closely related terms. I hope to deal with the matter in a volume which will appear shortly.</page><page sequence="13">192 THE MONIST experiencing of them. What then of the beautiful object as a unified whole of expressed values, and what of its objectivity? Let us define beauty provisionally as the character in an aesthetic object of satisfying, complete, self-sufficient expressiveness. The concrete meaning of this profound unity and satisfaction can only be understood, of course, through experience of the serious work of art. But the definition is good enough, as a definition. What then of the status of beauty? Is it something which is as entirely objective to mind as are the values which are imaginatively embodied in the beautiful object and are its "parts"? The answer is, on the whole, "yes." This does not of course mean that mental entities may not be imagined as part of the beautiful object. For mental values may be embodied and are certainly as important as, if not more important than, non-mental (e.g. organio) values. Nor does it mean, on the other hand, that beauty can be.existent apart from all mind, for the values which are imaginatively embodied in the object cannot appear as parts of the object without the causal agency of mind. For (a) if the mind imagines or "imputes" values to the pic ture or the symphony, which are not literally in it, then it is clear that mental agency or causality is involved. Impu tation is a mental process : it is "thinking into" or "imagin ing into" the object. And further, (b), the several contents of imputation, i.e., what the object is going to appear to reveal, cannot appear as fused together in one ob ject, here and now, apart from the mind's power of fusion, of association, of assimilation, and so on. Values may exist apart from the consciousness of them, but the object cannot appear to "express" or "embody" them, without the gift of "mental" imaginativeness. The values</page><page sequence="14">VALUE AND AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE 193 are still objective, but they are imagined together, and im agination is mental activity or agency. Or, in other words, what is true of the embodied values imputed to the object, is true of the aesthetic whole which is beautiful. The aesthetic unity has objective meaning which is due to the objective re lations or system of its objective parts. But such a whole needs imagination, creative imagination, in order to be created or realised as a whole. We may conclude, then, that beauty, with all its contents, is objective, entirely ob jective, but is dependent on mind as the cause of its ex istence as a systematic whole of parts apprehended "in" a perceived object. We shall be in error, of course, if we suppose mind to be a sort of external causal agency sticking ready presented objects together on a work of art like enamels on a mosaic. For the "objects" are not mere inert pieces, stuck together by mental cement. The objects are, to change the metaphor, molten objects, not sticking together by an applied cement, but adhering and fusing and run ning together, taking on marvellous new fluid patterns as they touch. It is true that they do not do so literally. The metaphor is of limited value. The sounds, colours, forms, organic and ideal contents, with which the artist deals, are, in themselves, distinct entities incapable of thus interacting. Imagination is certainly needed. But imagination is really dealing, not with inert fact-objects, but with innumerable tendencies and their ends, with a thou sand active impulses or needs of body-and-mind, impulses and needs which, being alive, demand fulfilment, which restlessly stretch out hungry tentacles to all possible?and even to impossible15?objects of fulfilment. And, whilst the process of artistic production is going on, one fulfil 15 The artist rejects no less than he selects. Artists "Often add, but of tener take away."</page><page sequence="15">194 THE MONIST ment (say through the production of a line or a musical phrase) leads to other needs whose fulfilment in turn leads to further needs, till at last we come to rest in a self complete system of balanced fulfilments, which rest can only be attained through the production of, or at least the participation in, such a perceived aesthetic whole. The aesthetic imagination implies a body-and-mind, sensitive even irritable-to the suggestiveness of perceptual data. Colours, sounds, and their forms awaken needs which (un like, say, the eating of sweets) can only to a slight degree be fulfilled by the same aforesaid colours, sounds and forms. For the larger part, demands are created for fulfilments of profounder needs. These needs are met through the marshalling together of a great complex of other fulfilling objects, the perception and imaginings of which as a complex whole affords us mental satisfaction with its accompanying pleasure. Mind, then, in one sense, is the cause of the aesthetic object and its beauty. But only because it is sensitive to, and has the power of apprehending, living bodily and mental needs objective to itself whose fulfilment demands the production or construction or apprehension16 of a con siderably complex perceived-and-imagined object. Satisfaction, pleasant feelings, pleasant psychoses, per haps pleasurable17 emotions, these all bulk largely as the final-efficient causes of aesthetic activity, as we view this activity introspectively. They are perhaps the most im portant factors immediately present in consciousness. It looks as though we construct aesthetic objects for the sheer joy and pleasure of it, and for no other reason. The assertion here has truth, and the negation is false. On the 16 Here taken as roughly equivaluent. 171 ignore the negative-tone aspect for brevity's sake. But I am thinking of hedonic factors generally.</page><page sequence="16">VALUE AND AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE 195 one hand, joy and pleasure appear genuine motives to aes thetic endeavour. Joy and pleasure may fall on the subjec tive side, on the side of valuation, rather than on the objec tive side, on the side of value, in the primary value-situation. But what is important in aesthetic experience is, as we said, not mere bare value, but valuation-of-value, and this includes pleasure. To put it otherwise, what is im portant in aesthetic experience is not bare mind-independ ent beauty (which, on our showing cannot exist), but toned-aesthetic-experience (of beauty or something ap proaching it). Also as we said, experience-of-value is itself a value, and can be valued. So that the joy and pleas ure in the valuation (or appreciation) of the value, is itself a real and important value, and is a part of the motive of aesthetic construction. But only a part. To say "pleasure" and "joy" is only to give half the account. We may con struct aesthetically for pleasure and joy, but not for these in themselves. The very word "joy" indicates more than itself. We construct for "satisfactions" which are con crete psychoses, we construct for joyous experiences (or "pleasantly-toned" experiences if you will) of fulfilment. The fulfilment is value. So that, strictly speaking, tend ency-fulfilment, or the existence of value, is the true aim, the ultimate final-efficient cause,-though conscious en joyment of this value is, as was said, an essential part of all aesthetic experience. And, without conscious aesthetic ex perience, as again was said, the aesthetic object could not exist at all, for the aesthetic object is dependent upon imaginative mind as its cause. Pleasure and joy, then, the immediately apparent causes, may be called integral, though secondary, parts of the final-efficient cause of aesthetic activity. If it is true that appreciation of value is essential for</page><page sequence="17">196 THE MONIST the existence of aesthetic objects at all, it will follow, of course, that aesthetic objects (for example, works of art) cannot be embodiments of mere facts, whether particular facts or universal facts (or Ideas or Concepts). We our selves have said above that the aesthetic object is always an "embodiment" of values. The significance of this will be seen more clearly if we now contrast this statement with the belief, often held, that it embodies mere18 facts. A great deal, of mischief has been caused by this. There is the popular supposition that art (for example) is "expression" of facts, that painting just imitates, that poetry just tells stories. Hardly less confusion has been caused by some forms of the theory-sometimes more vague and poetic, sometimes more precise and philosophic -that in aesthetic expression are embodied fact-Uni versals, that art is a revelation of reality or truth.19 A philosophic statement of such a view is seen ir* the aesthetic theory of Hegel. The latest modification of this tradition is to be found in Mr. W. T. Stace's recent work.20 Mr. Stace holds an interesting theory, namely that beauty (for us it is suffi cient to say here the "aesthetic object") consists in the fusion of an intellectual content, which he calls "empirical non-perceptual concepts," "with a perceptual field, in such manner that the intellectual content and the perceptual field are indistinguishable from one another ; and in such man ner as to constitute the revelation of an aspect of reality.21 Empirical non-perceptual concepts, it may be explained, are concepts which lie between universal and abstract categories (e.g. unity, existence, quality) and, at the other end of the scale, what Mr. Stace calls "perceptual con 18 By 'mere' and 'bare' facts I mean simply facts which are not values. 19 I do not wish to deny that it may be so in some sense. 20 The Meaning of Beauty. 21 Op. cit., p. 43.</page><page sequence="18">VALUE AND AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE 197 cepts," concepts which have percepts corresponding to them (e.g. house, jealousy, roughness, hitting, to the left of). Empirical non-perceptual concepts, which form the content of the beautiful, are more universal than perceptual concepts^ because they are abstractions which cannot be grasped together in any single act of perception, but are less universal than the categories. Empirical non-percep tual concepts are not found in ordinary perception at all, but are the result of intellectual reflection; but as free concepts they enter into the special kind of perception which is aesthetic. Examples of them are, evolution, pro gress, harmony, goodness, civilisation, law, order, peace, gravitation, spirituality. To these no single percept cor responds. But the fusion of any of them with a percep tual field constitutes aesthetic perception. But, if the categories and "perceptual concepts" are excluded, why not empirical non-perceptual concepts ? Or, alternatively, why not include all? In one sense it would seem that some at least of the concepts from any of Mr. Stace's three classes might be embodied. In one sense a work of art may be said to "embody" unity," or "jealousy" or "love," just as much as "progress" or "gravitation." It is indeed difficult to see why "unity," for example, should be placed (for aesthetic purposes) in a different class from "harmony" or "law" or "order." But, if we are right, it is never really true to say that it is simply concepts which are embodied. It is as the ob jects of need or tendency that they are embodied, or (as in the case of "goodness" or "love") as fulfilments them selves. Let us call the objects of need (e.g. the warm fire) "terminal objects" ("to") and value itself, "t.f.", (tend ency fulfilment). We make an artificial abstraction if we leave out of consideration the relation of concepts to value. Value (t.f.) is the central explaining principle of embodi</page><page sequence="19">198 THE MONIST ment The concepts are not in themselves values, but they must be related to values before they can be said to be em bodied. The fact that they must be related to values is im portant in two ways (with reference to Mr. Stace's theory). We have said that the only values which we can immediately appreciate are the values of our own bodies and-minds, though we can by sympathy share to some ex tent and in different degrees in the values of other living beings. But there are limits beyond which we cannot go, and beyond that limit only poor and invalid analogies hold good. From the point of view of aesthetic experience we are not concerned with the truth of analogies : if they yield value-experience, it is enough. If they will not yield value experiences, they can have no place in aesthetic experience. And it is this principle, it would seem, (and not any formal classification of categories) which determines the possi bility of the inclusion or exclusion of "categories" as ob jects to be embodied. If any instances of any of the three classes of concepts which Mr. Stace cites are to enter at all into aesthetic expression, they must be interpreted either as terminal objects (to.), or as values (t.f.), whether ex perienced immediately, by sympathy, by analogy, or by some combination of these. If they cannot be so in terpreted, they cannot be "embodied." As to whether there are any categories which, on this principle, must be ex cluded, it seems unsafe to dogmatise. It seems unsafe to exclude any of the three classes, or any particular category. It may be that such an abstract category as "existence" or "quality," or such a perceptual concept as "to the left of," is unlikely to be appreciated as a terminal object or as a value (t.f.). But we cannot say this for certain. It is perhaps not altogether fantastic to suppose sheer "ex istence," or any of the Platonic Forms as appearing to a</page><page sequence="20">VALUE AND AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE 199 metaphysically-minded artist as supremely satisfying ob jects (to.). And if "existence," why not "house," "jealousy," "roughness"? We cannot possibly veto a priori certain classes of objects. The other fact of importance (with reference to Mr. Stace's theory) closely connected with the above, is that values (t.f.) are the dynamic of all embodiment. Mere facts, mere concepts, are static, dead, eternally the same, abiding forever in the "place of the Forms." And the con ceiving of them will never bring an aesthetic object into being. Mr. Stace in his book is so anxious to re stablish the status of the concept, to get rid of what he regards as the "irrationalism" of feeling, to show that "the very core of aesthetic feeling is rationality,"22 that he does little justice to the value-, and the hedonic, side of aesthetic ex perience. But in truth both belong to the central essence of the aesthetic. It is no mere thinking, no mere conceiv ing of concepts, but (toned) interest, based upon tendency, which motivates aesthetic expression, which motivates the construction of aesthetic objects, in order that interest may be thoroughly satisfied. Without hedonically-toned in terests grounded in the living teleological tendencies of minds and of bodies, concepts would never get embodied. There would be aesthetic sterility. We have said that "pleasant feelings, pleasant psy choses, and, perhaps, pleasurable emotions" bulk largely as final-efficient causes of aesthetic production. Of feelings we have spoken. Feeling isi just the affective side of a psychosis. But what of emotion? Is there a special kind of aesthetic emotion? Are there "special" emotions at all? To both of these questions the answer given is often "yes." We have, it is often said, emotions corresponding 22 Op. cit. p. 5.</page><page sequence="21">200 THE MONIST to every instinct, and we are told23 that there is a special aesthetic emotion. "The starting-point for all systems of aesthetics must be the personal experience of a peculiar emotion. The objects that provoke this emotion we call works of art. All sensitive people agree that there is a peculiar emotion provoked by works of art. I do not mean, of course, that all works provoke the same emotion. On the contrary, every work produces a different emotion. But all these emotions are recognisably the same in kind; so far, at any rate, the best opinion is on my side. That there is a particular kind of emotion provoked by works of visual art, and that this emotion is provoked by every kind of visual art, by pictures, sculptures, buildings, pots, carvings, textiles, etc., etc., is not disputed, I think, by anyone capable of feeling it. This emotion is called the aesthetic emotion; and if we can discover some quality common and peculiar to all the objects that provoke it, we shall have solved what I take to be the central problem of aesthetics."24 On the other hand it is also denied that there is any such thing as an aesthetic emotion. "All modern aesthetics rests upon an assumption that there is a distinct kind of mental activity present in what are called aesthetic experiences. Ever since 'the first rational word concerning beauty' was spoken by Kant, the attempt to define the 'judgment of taste' as concerning pleasure which is disinterested, universal, unintellectual, and not to be confused with the pleasures of sense or of ordinary emotions, in short to make it a thing sui generis, has con tinued. Thus arises the phantom problem of the aesthetic mode or aesthetic state, a legacy from the days of abstract investigation into the Good, the Beautiful and the True."25 "When we look at a picture, or read a poem, or listen to 23 E.g. by Mr. Clive Bell in Art, Phoenix Library, p. 6. 24 Ibid., pp. 6-7. 25 Principles of Literary Criticism, I.

Richards, p. ll.</page><page sequence="22">VALUE AND AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE 201 music, we are not doing something quite unlike what we were doing on our way to the Gallery or when we dressed in the morning. The fashion in which the experience is caused in us is different, and as a rule the experience is more complex and, if we are successful, more unified. But our activity is not of a fundamentally different kind. To assume that it is, puts difficulties in the way of describing and explaining it, which are unnecessary and which no one has yet succeeded in overcoming."26 That there are "special" emotions is either untrue or it is obvious. It is untrue, if it is meant that each emotion is in some obscure way unique, sui generis, containing nothing in common with any other emotion. It is obvious, if it is meant that each emotion, being a psychosis, is therefore concretely different from every other psychosis, and that some emotions are very like others. The obvious seems to me the only really possible view. If we adopt it we need not trouble ourselves very much about whether there is a special aesthetic emotion or not. Of course there isn't and of course there is. There isn't, in that to have aesthetic experience is not to cast off human nature; and there is, in that aesthetic experiences as a class are notice ably different in many ways from any others. Emotion is a psychosis in which, through organic and conative affective disturbance in relation to a particular object, there is experienced a certain degree of excitement. The concrete character of any emotion depends upon each of these factors and upon their relations to one another. If this is true, every single emotion will be concretely dif ferent from every other, though some emotions re sembling others, may be classified roughly in certain groups. As regards aesthetic emotion, we may say in the first place that there is such a thing, since aesthetic ex TIbid., p. 16.</page><page sequence="23">202 THE MONIST perience often, and perhaps always, involves sufficient ex citement to be called emotion-psychosis. And aesthetic emotions which are, thus, just aesthetic experiences with stress laid on their excitement-aspect, are different as a class from other emotions in the same degree and to the same extent as aesthetic experience is different from non aesthetic experience. Also, for reasons given, each aes thetic emotion is different in some ways from every other. But to say this is not to say anything in the least remark able and one sometimes wonders at the fuss which has been made over emotions which are, after all, chiefly symptoms. Louis ARNAUD REID.
