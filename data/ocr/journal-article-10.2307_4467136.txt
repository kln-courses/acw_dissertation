<plain_text><page sequence="1">Defining God: Arnoldian Elements in Kaplan's Theology by Meir Ben-Horin Dedicated to Rabbi Mordecai M. Kaplan on the Occasion of his 100th Birthday 1 Mordecai M. Kaplan's theology revolves around Matthew Arnold's definition of God as "the enduring Power, not ourselves, which makes for righteousness."' Ar- nold led up to it, and elaborated it, in Literature and Dogma-An Essay Towards a Better Apprehension of the Bible, published in 1873 in London, New York, and Boston, and at least twice published again the same year and thereafter as well. He defended it in God and the Bible-A Review of Objections to 'Literature and Dogma,' published in 1875. Among Kaplan's unpublished writings the entries made under the title Com- munings with the Spirit clear the way for understanding what so attracted Kaplan to Arnold. Dating back to 1904 and 1905, they show Kaplan at twenty-three and twenty-four years of age struggling with fundamental questions of Jewish tradition and renewal. On 7 December 1904, he hopes "with God's help" to implement "the plan I have in mind," namely, "first of writing a work which shall be a kind of 'Guide to the Perplexed,' and secondly of purging the 'Shulchan Aruch.' " On "the Ritual" he also looks forward to writing "a philosophical commentary . . . which shall contribute new content to the old forms of prayer." There follows a comment which adumbrates the general direction of Kaplan's most mature thinking, combin- ing conservation and what he would come to call "reconstruction": The strongest argument for the maintenance of the old forms and ceremonies-as far as possible-in the Guide, will be that of natural self-preservation. They are to us at pres- ent what lands and governments are to the gentile nations. If we are tired of them ... we have no right to dispense with them as long as our hearts continue beating with love for our brethren, and we are without a home which we can call our own. Reform there must be, but it must be in the direction of nationalism. The following day he describes his "Guide's" method. It has "naturally to be that of inserting new content into the old forms of expression," for he recognizes "that while the form must remain the same in order to have some kind of identity, the content or interpretation must ever vary." While Maimonides did not conscious- ly make any distinction between form and content and "sought to find his preconceived doctrines in the Bible," however, stretching the meaning of "every 189</page><page sequence="2">190 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES other verse" in the effort, Kaplan proposes "to insert consciously new interpretation whenever it is necessary into the words of the Torah and of the Rabbis. . .. say, for instance, that the word which spells h-a-n-d means money and not hand (yad tahat yad)." Why, then, retain the old formulations and names at all? First, Kaplan answers with his "fundamental theory of knowledge." By this rather large term he means that "there is no doctrine that can be said to be absolutely false." Retention, therefore, is required "for the sake of whatever amount of truth the old formulations and names contain, though that amount be infinitely small." The second reason may be called Kaplan's "fundamental theory of ethnic loyalty" which, at least for the moment, seems to be self-evident to the degree that is his "fundamental theory of knowledge": "The reason I strive to retain and place content into the names and forms of Judaism, and not of any other cult or faith is because the amount of truth they do contain I as a Jew (by birth and blood) am best adapted to develop and inculcate." Two days later, however, self-evidence is abandoned. First, national religions are defended on grounds of the legitimacy and desirability of variety and, also, on grounds of contrasts between cosmopolitanism and Jewish religious authenticity. To assume that "national and tribal religions" have been discarded in the world is pure imagination. Actually, "each nation is slowly evolving its own interpretation of religion." Understandings of the spiritual are bound to be different with each na- tion, much "as is literature an expression and interpretation of the beautiful." Kaplan anticipates the growth of what six decades later was referred to as "minority ethnicism," what in the 1970s may be pointed to as "rootism" or the notion that "ethnic is beautiful." In his words of 20 December 1904, "cosmopolitanism has seen its day. Men are practically convinced that as time goes on, differences of every kind will rather be the more sharply drawn instead of smoothed over." Secondly, Judaism is defended with extraordinary vehemence, bordering on the caustic: It is not as people think that Judaism (orthodox) suffers from narrowness and tribalism. On the contrary, most of the evil elements therein are cosmopolitan in nature. In early times the Jew assimilated beliefs indiscriminately. Is not the adoption of the Satanic cult a sign of cosmopolitanism? ... A plea for national Judaism means a plea as well for the purification from these "cosmopolitan" features (namely, the habit of squeez- ing entire faiths into root principles and the spirit of self-righteousness, both imitations of neighboring systems). It will be shown that all these elements appear in Arnold's writings; his concern, of course, was not Judaism but Christianity. Two other convictions brought the questing young theologian to Arnold: the belief that action must verify faith (Arnold's inclusive term is conduct); and the belief that evolution must be taken seriously in religion. On 22 March 1905 Kaplan felt the "psychological ground" merits investigation "of a most mischievous of notions that creed is more important than deed." He also wished to investigate the extent to which this idea is "an importation into Judaism." That it exists in Judaism cannot be doubted. Kaplan offers as an example a passage from Chapter 37 in Isaac Arama's Aqedath Yitshaq (written in the 1480s, but first</page><page sequence="3">Arnoldian Elements in Kaplan's Theology 191 published in Saloniki in 1522) which he copies in the original Hebrew, but which is translated into English here: Should a person transgress many commandments, even including those pertaining to sexual restrictions and bloodshed or both, God will judge him [1 Sam 2:25] .... But should a person sin by denying God in heaven and by worshipping and fearing another-who shall entreat for him since he is cut off by heaven, beyond saving?2 Kaplan concludes that a "renaissance in Judaism must take place" and this along two lines: "1. the recognition of evolution [and] 2. the superiority of deed to creed."3 Five months later Kaplan makes his first reference to Arnold, in a remarkable entry which reflects the full force of the Englishman's impact. On 19 August 1905 he aligns himself with Arnold's work and with his larger purpose. The language in which the entry is couched signalizes enduring indebtedness: An essay which I recently read with much zest is Arnold's Literature &amp; Dogma. It did a great deal more to stimulate my Jewish self-consciousness than anything I have ever read in English or in Hebrew except the Bible. I am more convinced than ever that Achad Ha'ams [sic] conception of nationality plus Arnold's interpretation of Israel's (ancient) genius for righteousness contain that which could form a positive expression of the Jewish spirit. All it wants, is definiteness and detail. The Guide to the Perplexed more Kaplanico was to supply "definiteness and detail" to the synthesis of the Jewish people's spiritual nationalism and the Jewish religion's naturalistic righteousness. Two days later Kaplan elaborates a bit further: "The revival of the Jewish na- tional spirit can have nothing but the active faith in a God of righteousness for a basis." Having thus opened with Ahad Ha'Am and followed through with Arnold, he concludes with Arnold: "Outside of this there is no theological belief or dogma, that could hold us together." A passage follows which carries extraordinary interest for the understanding of Kaplan's interpretation of Arnold. It is anything but simplistically naturalistic, and it suggests that if Kaplan is to be read correctly, a full inquiry into Arnold's theology must be undertaken. Those who have charged Kaplan with arid rationalism will be somewhat sur- prised to hear him affirm, that there is a kind of mysticism "which is essential to thought and without which thought is both barren and heartless. That is the sense of the infinite, which must supplement every concept of the finite." Science, as long as it concerns itself with particulars, does not require this "sense, . . . but it is sure to grow narrow if it dismisses such mysticism entirely."4 Now Kaplan turns to Arnold, saying that for literature, by contrast, "it is of [its] essence ... to embody this sense of the infinite, this longing for the eternal universe Beyond. To call this Beyond a Person is meaningless, as Arnold has so well proved. But I would call this Beyond a Positive in contradistinction to the Agnostic who regards it as a negative." Kaplan explains that according to man's logic, notions of right and wrong arise from conve- nience, customs, and so forth. In short, I remember Sidwick [51 to have well shown in his "Methods," there is no room in pure logic for "ought." But the "ought" is there anyhow, and a mighty stubborn and</page><page sequence="4">192 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES positive thing it is. I shall therefore not trust my pure logic to remain insensible to the Beyond, but shall render homage to it and worship it because it is as stubborn and Positive as the ought. Here there is room for a mystical guess which would find the ought in the domain of the Beyond. An autobiographical comment by the 60-year old Kaplan sheds additional light on this passage: The best part of my Seminary training I derived from the student activities, both religious and cultural. In my sixteenth year, while taking part in the religious services con- ducted by the students themselves, I experienced a kind of religious illumination. The Psalms, which I had up to that time been in the habit of reciting mechanically as part of the daily prayers, suddenly became for me alight with meaning, and for the first time, I experienced a sense of the reality of God. Since then I have been allergic to prayers which offend my conception of God.6 This element remained constant in Kaplan's thinking. In 1956 he thus re- sponded to the question whether the lack of mysticism in Reconstructionism's literature was not a serious omission: "Legitimate mysticism is that which arouses the sense of the sublime and whatever ecstatic emotions constitute the functioning of the human spirit at its best, in relation to some concrete experience in human life." The thirteen articles of the Maimonidean creed are not satisfying because they are not only untenable in themselves but also "because they fail to interest the human mind in the mystery of life." How can Judaism help us to worship God in sincerity and in truth "without reckoning with the divine mystery of life?"7 In his most recent volume, Kaplan lists "abnormal mysticism" among eight at- titudes which characterize immature group religion: Abnormal mysticism . . . is a perversion of normal mysticism. The normal con- sciousness of the vastness and wonder of the world and of the gap between man's reach and his grasp, or between potential and attainment, finds expression in a sense of identity between the human person and the universal process of organicity or God. Abnormal mysticism ... tends to circumvent the communion between the human person and God by eliminating the long and intricate natural steps to arrive at the feeling of oneness.8 In his published writings, Kaplan has repeatedly acknowledged Arnold's in- fluence. To be sure, he did not name Arnold in his autobiographical statements, "The Influences that Have Shaped My Life"9 and " 'A Heart of Wisdom'."' 0 In "The Way I Have Come,"' however, he recalled how in his middle twenties, that is, in the middle of the first decade of this century, he found himself "in a tragic quandary." He was serving a large Orthodox congregation - Kehillath Jeshurun in New York City-whose members "believed blindly" in a religious dogma "which I could not believe at all." This dogma was Torah min ha-shamayim, the belief that the Torah is supernatural in origin. The only ethical course for the young rabbi to follow was to treat this dogma not as a truth for which to live "but as a means of stressing the supreme worth and authoritative character of the Torah." For convincing proof of the Torah's intrinsic worth, he had to look to other than Jewish sources. Such a proof "had to be based on the assumption that the Sacred Scriptures were written and edited by fallible human beings and could not therefore be infallible." Medieval</page><page sequence="5">Arnoldian Elements in Kaplan's Theology 193 Jewish theologians had learned some of the most fundamental religious truths from non-Jews (for example, the abhorrence of anthropomorphism from Aristotle), "so why would I feel inhibited from looking to non-Jewish sources for the truth about our Scriptures?" At this point in his "self-education," as he put it, Kaplan "came upon the writings of Matthew Arnold." The experience was overwhelming: His Literature and Dogma and his God and the Bible not only extricated me from the morass of doubt and questioning, but led me up to a mount of vision where new vistas opened to me. Here at last I found a helpful "Guide for the Perplexed" of our day. I learned to appreciate the Bible for what constitutes its true worth, an expression of human nature at its best, the most articulate striving of man to achieve his salvation or self-fulfilment, and an expression of his most conscious recognition that only through righteousness can he achieve it. I began to see that no other writings, however they might excel the Bible in word artistry or philosophic depth, could compare with the depth of passion for the one all-embracing purpose of all its teachings and ordinances, that of establishing God's Kingdom on earth. What makes the biblical writings even more remarkable is that, while the great ancient classics, which were the works of poets, seers and thinkers who on occasion rose to great heights of moral vision, remained mere literature, the writings that go to make up the Bible became the religion of the Jews.'2 The language used in this passage resembles Kaplan's already cited account of the "kind of religious illumination" as a result of which the Psalms suddenly became "alight with meaning." Now, however, not only the Psalms, but also the Hebrew Bible in its entirety alights with meaning. Moreover, the new reference to the "Guide for the Perplexed" invokes both the title of Kaplan's 1904-05 manuscript, Guide to the Perplexed- Communings with the Spirit as well as the passage earlier quoted from it which speaks of his intention to write such a Guide. In "The Way I Have Come" Kaplan testifies that in Arnold he found the very "Guide for the Perplexed" which he, himself, had hoped to contribute-or to be'3-to the Jewish people's cultural and religious renewal. In Arnold, Kaplan discovered a Guide, as it were, to his own projected Guide. In other words, Kaplan would henceforth be for the Jewish religion what Arnold was for the Christian. He would function as the Jewish Arnold. He found in the Englishman's reading of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament that which was needed for the proper reading of the Hebrew Bible, if Jewish religiosity, indeed, Jewish identity was to be saved from irrelevance and creeping intellectual ob- solescence. In Arnold, in other words, Kaplan found the intellectual tools with which to overcome what in Judaism as a Civilization he would expose as "the devastation of the Jewish spiritual heritage."'4 A contrast will throw Kaplan's adherence to Arnold into bold relief. As early as about the mid-1870s, Felix Adler, although briefly influenced by Arnold, rejected both Arnold's definition of God and his purpose of reconstructing Christianity. As Adler, himself, recalled: I thought at that time of the Moral Law as that which answers to or should replace the individualistic God-idea. I believed in an unknown principle or power in things of which the Moral Law is the manifestation, and I found the evidence of the moral law in man's</page><page sequence="6">194 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES consciousness. Matthew Arnold's "power that makes for righteousness" is a phrase which at that time would have suited me, - though perhaps not entirely even at that time. I have since come to see that "making for righteousness" is a conception inapplicable to the ultimate reality, and is properly applied only to the human effort; since purpose implies that the end sought has not as yet been realized, and non-realization and ultimate reality are contradictory ideas.15 A little later Adler was to reject both Christianity and his own Judaism: One day I awoke, and found that I had traveled into a new country. . . . The predominance of the ethical principle in religion dates from the prophets of Israel... [but] a religion [like Judaism and Christianity]... is a closed circle of thought and beliefs. It is capable of a certain degree of change but not of indefinite change. The limits of change are determined by its leading conceptions-the monotheistic idea in the one case, and the centrality of the figure of Christ in the other. Abandon these, and these bound- aries by which the religion is circumscribed are passed.16 On 21 February 1877 the New York Society for Ethical Culture was incor- porated; without difficulty, Adler had separated himself from Judaism and the Jewish people.'7 In his lecture on "The Religion of Humanity in Its Relations to Judaism and Christianity," dated 5 May 1878, he said that "we of the religion of humanity stand without the camp of the positive religions... .Whether the blood of the Hebrew, of the Teuton, of the Anglo-Saxon flow in our veins or that of any other tribe or race of men, the idea of humanity when we meet here has already made us one. We are no longer to be separated for our souls are now in a common cause which permits of no distinctions."'8 Kaplan did not "travel into a new country," that is, into "humanity" with "no distinctions," nor did he quickly or ever find Arnold's God-idea inadequate for wholehearted renewal of religious faith and for the task of a comprehensive reconstruction of Jewish religion in the interest of a Jewish religious renaissance. What, then, had Arnold accomplished which put an end to the "tragic quan- dary" into which Kaplan had fallen? What had he discovered in Arnold that rescued him from "the morass of doubt and questioning" and had led him "up to a mount of vision" and vistas of new meaning? "Arnold is illuminating" -the 1942 text has "I experienced a kind of illumina- tion" - for three reasons. First, he stressed the Bible's uniqueness in dealing with hu- man conduct. Second, and more importantly, because his is perhaps the first frank attempt to free the Bible from the need of regarding it as supernatural and infallible as a prerequisite to appreciating its high worth. Arnold argues with the utmost clarity and objectivity to prove that it is not the purpose of the Bible to teach a metaphysically correct conception of God. Its purpose is rather to in- culcate, by means of popular tales, laws and prophetic exhortations, that God is "a Power that makes for righteousness-not ourselves." All else is merely the fruit of the imagina- tion and not to be treated as literal fact, least of all to be turned into religious dogma.19 Third, in place of the "God of miracles" and the "God of metaphysics" Arnold of- fered the "God of experience." This alternative "rounded out the thought pattern which was then shaping itself in my mind, as I was recovering my faith in the Bible," and "in the potentialities of the Jewish people." For Kaplan this recovery of faith also meant his restoration to the active rab- binic function which is the task of teaching the rabbi's congregants and his people</page><page sequence="7">Arnoldian Elements in Kaplan's Theology 195 the Jewish truths he made his own: Belief in the God of experience is an integral part of a naturalist world outlook like that of Arnold's, for brute nature by itself is too abounding in evil to permit man to pursue his goal of salvation without suffering occasional defeats and frustrations. Man needs the assurance, which only faith in God as the Power that makes for righteousness can give him, that his virtuous strivings are not in vain.20 This belief in the God of experience, who is the God as Power that makes for righteousness sive salvation, became the cornerstone of Kaplan's Jewish theology, his mission to the Jewish people, his contribution to Israel's renascence in the realm of the spirit. Kaplan's fullest elaboration and expanded application of Arnold's definition of God appears in The Meaning of God in Modern Jewish Religion (1937), not, in- terestingly enough, in Judaism as a Civilization (1934) nor in the much earlier A New Heart and a New Spirit (1924) which, in the manner of Arnold, however, refers to Torah as "culture aglow with a passion for righteousness." In Judaism as a Civilization, Kaplan's most famous work, Arnold's name does not appear. Only in the Preface to the 1967 edition is he mentioned, and not in connection with the God formula. Yet, credit does go to Arnold for the book's major achievement. This, in Kaplan's words, is "seeing Judaism as a totality, and therefore as more than a religion." It was made possible because "of the latest perspective which the human mind has been able to achieve-that of holistic or organismic thinking." This "holistic or organismic approach," which Arnold described as " 'seeing things in- tegrally and seeing them whole'," enabled him "to arrive at his classic description of the difference between Hebraism and Hellenism." This thinking, according to Kaplan, "is the latest stage in the maturation of the human mind," its advancement beyond the stages of mythology, philosophy, and science. Judaism as a Civilization, therefore, is an attempt to write in organismic or Arnoldian terms. In this work, however, the Arnold formula, "the Power that makes for righteousness," is not presented as a quotation but simply appears in the discussion of the need to discover "an acceptable and effective sanction" for whatever standards of conduct may be proposed for adoption. The idea of Israel's Prophets that YHWH is "a God of righteousness" served as a valid sanction for the standards of Jewish living. Ethical principles today as well require the sanction of history, primarily "to show that they are in line with tendencies inherent in the very nature of man, and in keeping with that character of the world which expresses itself as the power that makes for righteousness" (emphasis added).21 Arnold's name also does not appear in Judaism in Transition which in 1936 brought together a number of Kaplan's essays written and published earlier. Two opportunities to acknowledge indebtedness to Arnold were allowed to pass. The first is a passage which, incidentally, exposes the ambiguity, if not the fundamental vulnerability, of the Arnoldian formula: Thanks to the ethical genius of the Prophets, righteousness rather than power has come to be identified as the essence of godhood. ... For them God was that Power in the universe which manifested itself in the urge to righteousness.22 The second occasion is another reference to the achievement of the Prophets who,</page><page sequence="8">196 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES appreciating the supreme importance of the ethical values of justice and righteousness which emerged out of the conflicts between social groups and individuals among the peo- ple of Israel and Judah, had learned to conceive of YHWH as a God of justice and righteousness. . . .23 Again, Arnold's name is not mentioned in Kaplan's essay on "Why Humanism Is Not Enough," published twice in 1936.24 The following year, however, when Kaplan placed it in Chapter IX of The Meaning of God in Modern Jewish Religion, the chapter bears Arnold's phrase "'God as the Power that Makes for Righteousness-Not Ourselves'," as its title. This time, the first footnote acknowledges the author of the formulation. Actually the entire work must be understood as Kaplan's fullest expression of a Jewish Arnoldism. It is his application to the functioning of the Jewish tradition in life, chiefly through the Sabbath and the festivals, of Arnold's conception of God. It is both application and enlargement and the elaboration of consequences flowing from it. In its entirety, the volume revolves around Arnold's view of God as "the Power not ourselves that makes for righteousness." Along with the aforementioned chapter, six of the ten chapter headings bear Arnold's signature, albeit along with Kaplan's own. Thus, Chapter II deals with "God as the Power that Makes for Salva- tion," a formulation that became the central affirmation and watchword of Kaplan's theology, while Chapter III is entitled, "God as the Power that Makes for Social Regeneration." Along with the headings of Chapter IV, "God as the Power that Makes for the Regeneration of Human Nature," and Chapter VIII, "God as the Power that Makes for Freedom," it speaks of aspects of "salvation" assigned to the second chapter which deals with the Sabbath. It is worth noting that the two most important chapters in the book bear the designations of Kaplan's own most important religious formula, "God as the Power that Makes for Salvation"25 and Arnold's own language, "God as the Power that Makes for Righteousness-Not Ourselves."26 In the latter chapter Kaplan discusses Shavuoth, the festival which traditionally celebrates the "giving of our Torah" and the revelation of the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai. The assignment to this chapter's title of Arnold formula, therefore, is particularly significant. In this chapter, too, Kaplan points to Israel's teaching "that the moral law is the principal manifestation of God in the world" as "the outstanding characteristic of the Jewish religion." This teaching, in Kaplan's view, is summed up in "perhaps the most significant statement in the entire literature of religion: 'The Lord of Hosts is exalted through justice, and God the Holy One is sanctified through righteousness'."27 What greater praise can be heaped on a pioneer of the spirit? In addition to the content, it is as if the very organization of the work implies a very great compliment to Arnold, acknowledging the mighty stimulation which flowed from Arnold, bore fruit, and carried the English poet's and critic's indelible imprint even in the refraction of Kaplan and the environment of Jewish thought and literature. Other references to Arnold are sporadic. In The Future of the American Jew, a line in Arnold's essay on "Equality" is quoted with approval: "A system founded on inequality is against nature and, in the long run, breaks down."28 In Not So Random Thoughts, Kaplan stands Arnold on his head in a keen aphorism: "Matthew Arnold</page><page sequence="9">Arnoldian Elements in Kaplan's Theology 197 defined religion as morality touched with emotion. Historically, religion has been emotion touched with morality, and sometimes not even touched."29 In A New Zionism Kaplan does not name Arnold but refers to the religion of the maskilim (men of the Enlightenment) as "merely modern nationalism 'touched with emotion'!"30 God, of course, is "the Power that makes for salvation."'3 The formula has been so incorporated into the fabric of Kaplan's thinking that explicit references to Arnold might seem downright pedantic. In The Purpose and Meaning of Jewish Existence, however, Kaplan takes time to acknowledge Arnold's presence in his most mature thinking. As he places in opposition his own functionalist idea of God with those developed by Hermann Cohen and Martin Buber, Kaplan concludes that "the most reliable and universal medium through which one can experience most vividly the reality God" is not the intellect (Cohen) nor feeling (Buber) but "the human will, as it functions in one's conscience." Having said this, Kaplan immediately allows that he, himself, is not the original author of this conviction. Rather, The first person to have hit upon this idea and to have discovered that this idea was the distinctive contribution of Hebraism to world civilization, as distinct from that of Hellenism, was Matthew Arnold. He summarized that idea in the phrase "God as the Power that makes for righteousness - not ourselves." By "not ourselves" he meant to say that righteousness was not a human convention but a law inherent in the very nature of reality.32 Kaplan goes on to explain why he found it necessary to modify Arnold's for- mulation of God: "I believed that his formulation could give a more accurate ac- count of the functional approach to the meaning of God, by describing God as the Power that makes for man's salvation, or fulfilment as a human being." Righteousness, of course, is "an indispensable means to salvation" and it is not merely a contemplative or an emotional experience-Cohen and Buber respectively were earlier identified with one of these positions-but "a manifestation of the human will" or conscience. Arnold, therefore, might have defined God as the Power that makes for conscience.33 He did not do so, Kaplan speculates, because con- science may be nothing more than "a hunch, an intuitive guess, or the echo of public opinion." To know what righteousness is, conscience needs to undergo "life-long training in knowledge, faith and courage." To be acknowledged as "properly educated conscience" or righteousness it must also elicit conduct which "would lead to universal freedom, justice and good-will." Kaplan breaks away from the Arnold theme-without, unfortunately, developing it more fully-saying that such a con- science "enables one to experience the reality of God as the Power that makes for salvation or human fulfilment in this world." Hence "education of the conscience will have to become the preoccupation of every Jew."34 2 It is clear that Kaplan's theology cannot be adequately understood without a study of Arnold's religious thought, which is comprehensive enough and detailed enough to disclose its main direction, basic method, and major affirmations. The</page><page sequence="10">198 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES result of such an inquiry into Arnold's writings, and the views of his interpreters, will shed some additional light on Kaplan's purpose and method. If it yields no in- sights other than a clearer view of Kaplan's sources and larger context in modern religious thought, this would nonetheless constitute an appreciable gain. In addi- tion, Arnold research would be extended into an area which thus far was un- suspected of being relevant-Jewish religion. There can be no doubt that Arnold's greatest impact on the development of religion becomes visible in Kaplan's pioneering on behalf of Jewish religious reconstruction. Ironically, the entire Arnold literature is silent about what must be regarded as his greatest success in the field of religious renewal. Curiously enough, an American Jewish educator, Rabbi Samuel M. Blumenfield who from 1954 to 1968 served as director of Department of Education and Culture of the World Zionist Organization-American Section, called Kaplan the "Ahad Ha-Am of American Jewry,"35 while a former Rector of Bar Ilan University in Ramat Gan, Israel, identified Ahad Ha'Am as "the Matthew Arnold of the Zionist Movement, teaching 'Sweetness and Light' and a community founded on Culture rather than Power."36 If such comparisons must be made, Kaplan is more properly referred to as being to twentieth-century Jewish religion what Arnold was to nineteenth-century Christianity, with the difference that Kaplan was successful in creating not only a religious version but also a religious movement of considerable vitality and potential for growth in the Jewish world. What did Arnold intend and accomplish when he ventured beyond poetry, literary criticism, educational improvement, and entered the realm of religious criticism with daring, yet conservative, reformulation of fundamental belief? To what kind of intellectual and religious situation did he find himself impelled to respond? The observations of a leading Catholic theologian, speaking for the 1970s, will prepare the way for a consideration of what Arnold faced in British Protestantism a century earlier. In a paper "On the Future Ways of Theology" (1970), Father Karl Rahner noted that both the future and the future of theology are unknown and that particularly in the future, theology must be "the guardian of the 'docta ignorantia theologiae futurae'."37 He hoped, however, that identity will remain constant: the revelation of Jesus, the Church, and so forth. Yet what might be foreseen for the next three decades, up to the turn of the millennium? Rahner saw the following: First, "the theology of the future will be a pluralistic theology." Theologies will differ from each other, yet they will remain interdependent. The various life styles will not be devalued, as they have been. Hence the theology of the Church will have "a variety of starting points, horizons of thought, models of ideas, . . .all basic assumptions of theological thinking which. . .cannot be adequately brought into a 'system'." Second, ". . the future theology will more directly than heretofore be a missionary-mystagogical theology,": it must serve the Annunciation. Third, "the future theology must be a 'demythologizing' theology." Demytholo- gizing means that the declarations of faith need to be rendered believable, "accept-</page><page sequence="11">Arnoldian Elements in Kaplan's Theology 199 able for the person of today.... It must be said in all urgency that the traditional as- sertions of faith, at least for the immediately necessary annunciation of faith, are largely unfit or increasingly become so." They must, of course, be the starting point, but they cannot, as heretofore, be the end points of faith. "Catholic theology must be grounded in the conviction of faith that such a 'demythologizing' is possible within an unequivocal orthodoxy." Specifically, such affirmations about the mean- ing of "God" as "In God there are three Persons," or "God has sent His son into the world," or "we are saved by the blood of Jesus" are beyond comprehension in the old style of communication; they appear like mythology. Nor does it help to resort to mythology. It is the function of theology to work out new concepts, connections, and perspectives for the substance of the traditional terms. Fourth, "the future theology will much more emphatically than hitherto be a transcendental theology." Man can live only "in the undergoing and in the responsi- ble doing of his history which is never adequately. . .reflected by theoretical reasons." The reality of salvation as the fulfilled wholeness of man points to grace, the communication of the absolute mysterium. In principle, what Arnold faced and proposed in the 1870s was analogous. In "The True Greatness of Christianity," the last chapter of Literature and Dogma-An Essay Towards a Better Apprehension of the Bible (1873)38 Arnold speaks of Christianity's greatness, but does so "very soberly." For in his view, Christendom "has as yet so little shown all it contains, all it can do," and before it stretches forth "an immense development."39 In its present state, Christianity, in fact, "is much in the same position in which the Jews, when Jesus Christ came, were." In other words, "the world now, as the Jewish people formerly, has something which thwarts and confuses its perception"4 of what is at its core. This "thwarting cause is the same now as then:-the dogmatic system current, the so- called orthodox theology."41 In particular, now as then, "the multitudes are the same everywhere." So is, under different names, the leadership: "The chief priests and elders of the people, and the scribes, are our bishops and dogmatists, with their pseudo-science of learned theology blinding their eyes, and always, -whenever sim- ple souls are disposed to think that the method and secret of Jesus is true religion, and that the Great Personal First Cause and the Godhead of the Eternal Son have nothing to do with it, - eager to cry out: This people that knoweth not the law are cursed! (John vii, 49)."42 Contemplating the distance between Christian reality and Christian potentiali- ty, Arnold finds "few things. . .more melancholy than to observe Christian apologists taunting the Jews with the failure of Hebraism to fulfill the splendid promises of prophecy, and Jewish apologists taunting Christendom with the like failure on the part of Christianity. Neither has yet fulfilled them, or could yet have fulfilled them."43 Five years later, in "Irish Catholicism and British Liberalism" (1878),44 Arnold's cadences rolled with less restraint: Christianity's "power and permanence" came not from the Pope's infallibility or from miracles-one of Arnold's major targets-but from "the word, the character, the influence of Jesus,"45 from "Chris-</page><page sequence="12">200 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES tianity's being a real source of cure for a real bondage and misery."46 Yet "fantastic buildings" were built around the source, "strange and intricate conduits" to carry its waters, "mishandled and disfigured" it was almost beyond recognition. "Catholicism is that form of Christianity which is fullest of human accretions and superstitions, because it is the oldest, the largest, the most popular."47 Its "mischiefs"48 are "Ultramontanism, sacerdotalism, superstition" (e.g., the Immaculate Conception) to which "the great auxiliaries are ill-government, vice, ignorance" and whose "natural counteractors are freedom, good government, sound morals, intelli- gence."49 Yet, here-as so often in his writings-Arnold, and later Kaplan, draws back from the areligious or the anti-religious conclusion or apostasy which so readi- ly presents itself as the radical critique's inescapable denouement. When the "mis- chiefs" are overcome, the Church will remain in possession of what is common to all Christendom, "the curative power, word, character, influence of Jesus" and "the beauty, the richness, the poetry, the infinite charm for the imagination, of its own age-long growth . ..-unconscious, popular, profoundly rooted, all-enveloping."50 Indeed, Arnold is persuaded that "the prevailing form for the Christianity of the future will be the form of Catholicism; but a Catholicism purged, opening itself to the light and air, having the consciousness of its own poetry, freed from its sacer- dotal despotism and freed from its pseudo-scientific apparatus of supernatural dogma." This Catholicism will retain its forms, but "as symbolising with the force and charm of poetry a few cardinal facts and ideals, simple indeed, but indispens- able and inexhaustible, and on which our race could lay hold only by materialising them.,"51 Kaplan saw "the time of reconstruction" at hand. "Labors" for Judaism, such as Arnold's for Christianity, would be "found useful," indeed, essential, if the ques- tion addressed to and by Ezekiel was again to receive a positive answer. "Can These Bones Live?" is the title of the opening chapter in Kaplan's The Future of the American Jew, and in response Kaplan invoked the Prophet in language clearly reminiscent of Arnold: ". .. it is essential that we Jews catch something of the spirit with which Ezekiel sought to imbue the Jews of his generation: courage in the face of disheartening apathy and spiritual decline, faith in the recuperative and regenerative powers of our people ... " (p. 9). Arnold's purpose, then, was to clear away the "thwarting cause," the "mischiefs" and the supersititions and so to reconstruct Christianity that it may show, if not "all it contains, all it can do," then surely more of what it contains, more of what it can do, more of its curative powers. Impressed by Arnold's critique and constructive purpose, Kaplan adopted Arnold's purpose and adapted it to Judaism. It was, of course, clear to him that Judaism did not advance, first, upward to Christianity and, second, to Christianity reconstructed in the Arnoldian manner. Kaplan would show that Judaism had risen through various stages of development of its own, that the next stage was to be reached through Judaism's reconstruction along the tangent of its self-determined and inner-directed historic continuity and spiritual evolution.</page><page sequence="13">Arnoldian Elements in Kaplan's Theology 201 Arnold himself used the term in "The True Greatness of the Old Testament," the chapter which precedes "The True Greatness of Christianity" in Literature and Dogma. He knew that for some time biblical religion would be "thrown aside . . . altogether as a delusion" and "a thaumaturgy."52 Yet after the abandonment, men would embrace the Bible's religion again. Of this he was sure because "hap- piness is our being's end and aim, and happiness belongs to righteousness, and righteousness is revealed in the Bible .... Then there will come a time of reconstruc- tion; and then, perhaps, will be the moment for labours, like the attempt of ours, to be found useful."53 Then it will be recognized that Arnold's "method for reading the Bible" and "the main lines of construction" he put upon the Bible, were right.54 In "Dr. Stanley's Lectures on the Jewish Church" (1863), Arnold declared: "Some reconstruction of the English Church, a reconstruction hardly less important than that which took place at the Reformation, is fast becoming inevitable. It will be a delicate, a most difficult task."55 What, then, are the direct lines linking Kaplan's reconstruction of Judaism to Arnold's reconstruction of Christianity? What did the formula mean to Arnold? What, in Kaplan, may be traced to Arnold? As already noted, Kaplan gave three reasons for finding Arnold the source of "a kind of illumination": (1). Arnold saw the Bible's uniqueness in dealing with conduct which is "three-fourths of life"; (2). he freed the Bible from supernatural origination and infallibility yet appreciated its high worth; and (3). Arnold replaced the God of miracles by "the God of experience." A close study of Arnold's writings on religion, however, shows a kinship of mind deeper and wider than these three reasons. Without the impulses which came from Arnold, that which is distinctly Kaplanian in Jewish religion is quite unthinkable. The hallmark of Kaplan's theology is Arnold's brilliant formula which first ap- pears in Literature and Dogma, near the end of the first chapter, "Religion Given." By "God" and by YHWH which Arnold renders "The Eternal,"56 ancient Israel meant, in his view, "the enduring power, not ourselves, which makes for righteousness."5 In other chapters, the formula appears with slight modifications, such as "the Eternal Power, not ourselves, which makes for righteousness"58 or "the Eternal that loveth righteousness,"59 "the Eternal who makes for righteousness,"60 or, since three-quarters of our being is conduct but one-quarter "is concerned with art and science," that is, "with beauty and exact knowledge," "the Eternal Power, not ourselves, by which all things fulfil the law of their being."61 In this writer's study of the meaning of salvation in Kaplan's theology,62 acknowledgments of his indebtedness to Arnold are presented, along with references and criticisms of the formula by a number of authors. The meanings which Arnold, himself, expressed by the formula and its major elements will be studied in the following paragraphs. Clues to what Arnold intended can be found in writings other than Literature and Dogma and God and the Bible. Already in A Persian Passion Play of 1871 he strikes a blow for religion not of miracles but of human experience. The essay opens</page><page sequence="14">202 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES with reflections on the Oberammergau Passion Play which was interrupted in 1870 by the Franco-German War but resumed running again between June and September 1871.63 The point of retelling the story of the tragedy, mostly in Gibbon's words, which befell the Imam Hussein, son of Ali, whom the Shi'ites regard as Muhammad's first lawful successor, is, primarily, to highlight the contrast between the "sweet reasonableness"64 of Jesus with its total absence among the Imams. Secondarily, Arnold, as indicated, sought to place in opposition popular religion and the religious version he was hoping to make popular. He made it clear that to popular opinion everywhere, religion is proved by miracles. All but a man's own are utterly false and vain; the authors of them are mere impostors; and the miracles which are said to attest them, fictitious. We forget that this is a game which two can play at... .Yet how much more safe is it, as well as more fruitful, to look for the main confirmation of all religion in its intrinsic correspondence with urgent wants of human nature, in its pro- found necessity! Differing religions will then be found to have much in common, but this will then be an additional proof of the value of that religion which does most for that which is thus commonly recognised as salutary and necessary.65 Arnold is more explicit in the Introduction to Literature and Dogma, where he explains "the relation of letters to religion," that is, "of their effect upon dogma, and of the consequences of this to religion."66 Why should "letters" be favored over "dogma"? "Dogma" refers, for instance, to the "Godhead of the Eternal Son" or "the idea of a Personal God" or "the Personality of the Holy Ghost" or to the asser- tion that" 'Our Lord unquestionably annexes eternal life to a right knowledge of the Godhead'."67 In turn, "right knowledge" depends upon reasoning from such terms as "substance, identity, causation, design about which there is endless disagree- ment!"68 "Letters," by which Arnold means "acquainting oneself with the best which has been thought and said in the world," makes available "fresh knowledge," and fresh knowledge, that is, "wide and familiar acquaintance with the human spirit and its productions," can help us to clear up the blunders that mark dogma: "Fancying that some idea is a definite and ascertained thing, like the idea of triangle, when it is not; and proceeding to deduce properties from it, and to do battle about them, when their first start was a mistake!"69 In the words of Arnold's Preface to the first edition of Literature and Dogma (1873), he sought to "give to the Bible a real experimental basis" in place of "unverifiable assumption ... followed by a string of other unverifiable assumptions of the like kind," that is, scholasticism. Stated differently, religion was to be revitalized not by abstract reasoning from a dogmatic base by "the athletes of logic"70 but by grounding it in human nature, in human experience, and in the history of the human spirit, thus, upon human culture.71 The Bible, and hence, religion, cannot be understood by homo unius libri, the man of no range in his reading, the man who takes biblical expressions literally, the man who holds God and salvation ready-made rather than becoming.72 For "our mechanical and materializing theology" Arnold reserved some of the essay's harshest terms: "With its insane license of affirmation about God, its insane license of affirmation about a future state, [it] is really the result of the poverty and inanity of our minds."73</page><page sequence="15">Arnoldian Elements in Kaplan's Theology 203 Culture is required to understand biblical language as "fluid, passing, and literary, not rigid, fixed, and scientific."74 Culture is needed to recognize that the Bible is not "a sort of talisman given down to us out of Heaven, with all its parts equipollent."75 Neither the Bible nor "any existing Church" is to be taken as a talisman, to be used literally: "Only true culture can give us [the right] interpretation."76 The formula, God as "the Power, not ourselves, that makes for righteousness" is the focal point of this purpose of extricating religion from "the growing discredit befalling miracles [77] and the supernatural" and emplacing instead its "natural truth."78 Such extricating neither requires nor constitutes an attack on miracles and supernaturalism, Arnold kept insisting. For "the belief in them has given way and cannot be restored"79 since simply, "miracles do not happen" (Arnold's emphasis).80 How did Arnold wish the terms of his formula to be read in the cultured man- ner? To the reader of culture, what did he want the words "Power," "not ourselves," "righteousness" to convey? Literature and Dogma is the best guide to the answer. At the root of all the difficulties which religion now experiences lies the "seem- ingly incurable ambiguity" of the term God.81 To Arnold, it is a literary term, not a term of exact knowledge or science. It is " a term of poetry and eloquence," and in- dividual feeling and character are imported into it. Yet it possesses "a common substratum of idea."82 To get at this substratum, Arnold introduces conduct, doing, three-fourths of human life: "Eating, drinking, ease, pleasure, money, the inter- course of the sexes, the giving free swing to one's temper and instincts."83 Now conduct is the object of religion, conduct or good or moral or right con- duct or, simply, "righteousness," which is how Arnold renders the biblical tsedeq. The latter is "the master-word of the Old Testament,"84 and Arnold's text is studied with biblical passages which document this generalization.85 "Conduct is the word of common life, morality is the word of philosophical disquisition, righteousness is the word of religion." The difference between morality and religion, then? It is a dif- ference of degree: Religion is "ethics heightened, enkindled, lit up by the feeling." Religion is not morality but "morality touched by emotion," and its religious word is "righteousness."86 Morality says, with Quintilian, "By the dispensation of Prov- idence to mankind, goodness gives men most satisfaction." Morality touched with emotion, or religion, says with Proverbs (4:18): "The path of the just [orah tsaddi- qim] is a shining light which shineth more and more unto the perfect day." Undi- vided attention to this concern was paid only by one people-Israel: No people ever felt so strongly as the people of the Old Testament, the Hebrew people, that conduct is three-fourths of our life and its largest concern. No people ever felt so strongly that succeeding, going right, hitting the mark in this great concern, was the way of peace, the highest possible satisfaction.87 Again, with Proverbs (4:13) they said: "Take fast hold of her [musar Arnold renders "the doctrine of conduct, or righteousness], let her not go! Keep her for she is thy life!"88 Israel noted one thing: Much in righteousness we did not make ourselves, neither our nature nor our happiness and satisfaction which follow "hitting the mark" in conduct, neither our health nor our energy nor our spirit. Much in conduct</page><page sequence="16">204 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES belongs, they said, to not ourselves which is in us and around us. In different places on earth, men have dealt with it in different ways. Men have been moved by it to "a cruel terror," to "a timid religiosity," to "a play of imagination." By contrast, those who wrote the Hebrew Bible-Arnold says, "Old Testament"-gave the not ourselves a special meaning: At the time they produced these documents which give the Old Testament its power and its true character, the not ourselves which weighed upon the mind of Israel, and engaged its awe, was the not ourselves by which we get the sense for righteousness, and whence we find the help to do right. This conception was indubitably what lay at the bot- tom of that remarkable change which under Moses, at a certain stage in their religious history, befell the Hebrew people's mode of naming God.... The name they used was: The Eternal.89 What, again, did they mean by The Eternal? "The Eternal what? The Eternal cause?. . . They meant the Eternal righteous, who loveth righteousness." They pondered conduct "until the not ourselves, which is in us and all around us, became to them adorable eminently and altogether as a power which makes for righteousness; which makes for it unchangeably and eternally, and is called The Eternal."90 This idea became fixed with Israel, "and marked it permanently off from all other peoples who had not made the same step."91 The Eternal was experienced and felt by Israel as "revealed to him." It had nothing to do with the speculative self-existent or the absolute or first cause or fatherhood of God. Israel personified his Eternal, for he was "an orator and poet," but he did not predicate personality of God: "The grandeur of the spectacle given by the world, the grandeur of the sense of its all being not ourselves, being above and beyond ourselves and immeasurably dwarfing us, a man of imagination instinctively personifies as a single, mighty, living and productive power."92 In doing so, Israel expressed his gratitude for righteousness, for the happiness which the not ourselves produces through order, conduct, and righteousness, which are the essence of The Eternal. This producing, bringing forth, establishing order in the world, is creation. To Israel, "it all comes . . . from the idea of righteousness."93 The same applies to the association of God with father: "God is a father, because the power in and around us, which makes for righteousness, is indeed best described by the name of this authoritative but yet tender and protecting relation." Much the same holds true also for the association of God and one. No metaphysics was intended: "The monotheistic idea of Israel is simply seriousness,"94 that is, it bespeaks Israel's attention not to the many aspects of the not ourselves (this argues the playfulness of polytheism) but to one-the one that makes for righteousness or for holiness which is "but a heightened righteousness; a more finished, entire, and awe-filled righteousness." This was Israel's ideal, and therefore he said, as Arnold has it, "Hear, O Israel! The Eternal is our God, The Eternal alone."95 Arnold keeps emphasizing that the not ourselves was not understood to be a "magnified and non-natural man," although it was inevitably spoken of an- thropomorphically. "Israel, the founder of our religion . . . began with experience.</page><page sequence="17">Arnoldian Elements in Kaplan's Theology 205 He knew from thankful experience the not ourselves which makes for righteousness, and knew how little we know about God besides."96 In other words, Israel knew that approaching righteousness in his life was fulfilling the law of his being. Under such a law "being" seemed to apply to all "beings," qua law or "tendency, that is not ourselves, but which appears in our consciousness, by which things fulfil the real law of their being."97 To say that we "serve," or "please" God, or do God's "will," is to say that we try to fulfill the law of our being which is righteousness and which is the source of our chiefest joy. What did Israel mean by saying, "It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Eter- nal. ... It is a good thing to sing praises unto our God" (Ps. 92:2; 147:2)?98 The words Eternal and God are "at bottom, nothing but a deeply moved way of saying 'the power that makes for conduct or righteousness'."99 In Israel, "religion replaced morality" when "the obligation of grateful and devout self-surrender to the Eternal replaced all sense of obligation to one's own better self, one's own permanent in- terest." Morality was revealed to the first man when he controlled the blind impulses of self-preservation and sex. Religion was revealed to the first man "who was thrilled with gratitude, devotion, and awe, at the same sense of joy and peace, not of his own making, which followed the exercise of his self-control.... And, for us at least, this man was Israel."'00 The verb "reveal" - does it split reality into cis and trans? Arnold rejects as false the common antithesis between natural and revealed: For that in us which is really natural is, in truth, revealed. We awake to consciousness of it, we are aware of it coming forth in our mind; but we feel that we did not make it, that it is discovered to us, that it is what it is whether we will or no. If we are little con- cerned about it, we say it is natural; if much, we say it is revealed. But the difference be- tween the two is not one of kind, only of degree. The real antithesis to natural and re- vealed alike, is invented, artificial. Religion springing out of an experience of the power, the grandeur, the necessity of righteousness, is revealed religion, whether we find it in Sophocles or in Isaiah .... The religion of the Bible ... is well said to be revealed, because the great natural truth that "righteousness tendeth to life" [Prov 11:19] is seized and exhibited there with such incomparable force and efficacy.'01 By contrast, artificial religion is a system of theological notions about divine "per- sonality, essence, existence, consubstantiality,"'02 a system of the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed, the Athanasian Creed.'03 Spirit, to Arnold, is not ghost, a person without a body, but influence.104 The visiting God is not Person but influence, intutition, "the Muse of righteousness; the Muse of the work-day, care-crossed, toil-stained millions of men,-the Muse of humanity."'05 It does not originate outside the natural situations of man in society. Invoking Darwinian evolution of moral perception, Arnold shows that tracing Honour thy father and thy mother to original natural affection of the young, even of animals, to their parents is entirely compatible with the Fifth Commandment. In man, stronger ties of attachment developed when some recognized their neighbors' callous neglect of those who had reared them. This minority then moved to extend the family bond, conquered "a little district from the mere animal life," limited "the</page><page sequence="18">206 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES reign of blind, selfish impulse" and thus brought greater order into their homes, more well-doing, and more happiness. Gradually "the usage of the minority . . . became the usage of the majority," and communities grew which, instead of eating their parents, honored them. When Israel fixed this feeling of the children's natural attachment to their parents by the commandment Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which the Eternal thy God giveth thee, "he showed that he had risen to regard this feeling ... as a sure, solid, and sacred part of the constitution of human nature."106 Faith, to follow through, "is neither submission of the reason, nor is it the ac- ceptance simply and absolutely upon testimony of what reason cannot reach." Rather, faith is "the being able to cleave to a power of goodness appealing to our higher and real self, not to our lower and apparent self." 07 Prayer, accordingly, "is at bottom nothing else than the energy of aspiration towards the eternal not ourselves that makes for righteousness-of aspiration towards it, and of co- operation with it."'08 Immortality, therefore, has nothing to do with the resurrec- tion of the body and with the world to come. Arnold, rather, responds with Israel's Proverb (12:28): "In the way of righteousness is life, and in the pathway thereof is no death" or with the Psalmist's (16:10, 11): "Thou wilt not leave my soul in the grave, neither wilt thou suffer thy faithful servant to see corruption! thou wilt show me the path of life!" For "the true basis for all religious aspiration after immortality" is "progress in righteousness into something immeasurably stronger."'09 Arnold also reconstructs the "resurrection" of Jesus to mean "the victory of his cause after his death and at the price of his death." Mortal man attains immortality, as Arnold understands it, in the immortality of righteousness.1 0 The similarities, indeed, the virtual unity of position, between Kaplan and Arnold cover, as has just been shown, these essential points: (1). God as the Power that Makes for Salvation; (2). righteousness equals salvation; (3). righteousness as the Power that Makes for Happiness/Salvation; (4). God is not a Person; (5). spirit is inspiration, intutition, influence; (6). natural selection must be replaced by spiritual selection; (7). the refusal to convert the rejection of miracles and super- naturalism into adoption of secularism, (8). acceptance of the authority of reason/intelligence over the reason of authority of revealed texts and pious inter- preters; (9). the meaning of God evolves in the course of human history; (10). prayer is not petition; (11). immortality is immanent; (12). the Bible is literature and, as such, indispensable; (13). religion is not theology; and (14). the moment for religious reconstruction is now. At times it is as if, while reading Arnold, one also reads Kaplan. Their language is different; their documentation is different; and their religious focus is different; but their basic assumptions about man, nature, literature, and the sources of culture and religion, appear to be the same. In Kaplan's reconstruction of the Jewish religion, Arnold's effort came to unexpected fruition: it served as impulse to a func- tioning religious movement. l Hence it is proper to view Arnold as something more than what Connell saw when he called him "not merely a Liberal of the Future, but an Educationalist of the Future," one who predicted "'a reconstruction of English education'.""2 Today</page><page sequence="19">Arnoldian Elements in Kaplan's Theology 207 Arnold should be seen also as a Religious Reconstructionist of the Future. Similarly, for this reason not followed here is Professor Madden's judgment about Spinoza's influence on Arnold's movement of mind from the God he nurtured from childhood to God as a poetic symbol. According to Madden, Spinoza was the agent by whose help Arnold passed "from the Christian order of thinking, . . . an order centering in the personal Christian God,. .. to a naturalistic order of thinking in which God and Nature are one." To Spinoza's deus sive natura, which is present in the idea of an impersonal Nature, an Eternal-Not-Ourselves, Arnold added his own view of the life of "pure" reason as a dialectical series of speculative acts, the mirror in human consciousness of the flux of the universe flowing, as it were, through the mind. Spinoza's Infinite Substance thereby became for Arnold a dynamic "stream of tendency," more specifically, an "Eternal Power, not ourselves, by which all things fulfill the law of their being." As a poet, Arnold was searching for the unity between man and nature which he found most perfectly realized in Greek art. . .; Spinozan Nature, seen as an active energy, provided the most adequate guarantee of the legitimacy of the aesthetic experience, by reasserting this unity. 13 The fact is, however, that Arnold had stepped away from Spinoza because "ideal is the intellecutal life" while "the Christian ideal is the religious life," and "be- tween the two states there is all the difference which there is between being in love and the following . . . a demonstration of Euclid." Arnold was a Christian who sought to save Christianity through its reconstruction. Nonetheless, he did acknowledge that Spinoza's "foot is in the vera vita, his eye on the beatific vision.""4 It is true that poetry is present in Arnold's religious reconstruction. So are literature and culture as a whole. Yet poetry neither overwhelms his religion nor was religion absorbed by it. Hence a much fairer evaluation is Sherman's who recognized that Arnold "brought to the task of reconstructive interpretation the light of a wide secular culture, profound moral insight, a passion for righteousness, and an instinct for religion."'5 By the same token, Trilling's reading of Arnold's religion falls short of doing full justice to Arnold's position as "a Religious Reconstructionist of the Future." Writing in 1939, Trilling was unaware of Kaplan's major work, Judaism as a Civilization, which had been published four years earlier. It formulates, in the man- ner of Arnold, a religious conviction which is neither supernaturalist nor naturalist and which does not propose a conventional, lame compromise - say, a two-truths or two-realms theory - between the two. This conviction is "reconstructionist" or, more descriptively, transnaturalist. The reality which it ascribes to God is not the reality of supernatural Person or Power, nor is it a "natural" power or process or energy the harnessing of which it assigns to the scientific enterprise. Arnold's "Power not ourselves that makes for righteousness" does not fit into these categories. The cor- relativity of God and righteousness (Arnold) and the correlativity of God and salva- tion (Kaplan) reflect a conception of reality which invites the term "transreality," that is, a reality of cosmos in which "righteousness" or "salvation" are no illusion but distinct possibility, the kind which, for example, Theodor Herzl had in mind - in the realm of history and international political as well as cultural relations-when he coined the phrase, "If you will, it is no fairy tale." Stated differently, the "future-</page><page sequence="20">208 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES unto-righteousness" or the "future-unto-salvation" is neither actuality already and always "there," nor is it fantasy or sheer myth nor, again, is it the consequence of in- evitability embedded in the movement of history or society or man's "nature." Rather it is a function of cooperation of man's prospective intelligence, man's em- bracive compassion and the means by him found in nature and fashioned from the natural environment of the human race. Hence, contrary to Trilling, Arnold's doctrine is not the position of William James who held that God is real because he produces real effects. "Had James not read Arnold, we might have said Arnold had read James, for the earlier writer argued the pragmatic position with which the name of the later is more intimately associated." 16 Still more doubtful is Trilling's statement that "Arnold, in spite of his whole program ..., affirms the value of morality by asserting that the moral law is, as it were, graven on the face of the universe, that meaning is preexistent to man."' 7 Neither Arnold's nor Kaplan's texts justify any conclusion other than that meaning appears in our experience on the human level, and is a consequent of evolutionary processes, not their antecedent."8 Trilling quotes Arnold's statement about all things seeming "to us to have what we call a law of their being, and to tend to fulfill it" and his indifference to designating this "tendency" as God or not so designating it. While, to Arnold, the "tendency" is real, its "reality" does not argue a preex- istence of fulfillment. All it argues is possibility or promise to be made manifest in the "future-unto-fulfilment," in transnature becoming "reality." Trilling cites Bradley who charged that Arnold's "power not ourselves" apparently was unable to make for righteousness in Assyria, Babylonia, Greece, and Rome, and, hence, wrought revenge upon them. How long does "the power" permit unrighteousness to flourish? 19 This is a serious stricture, however, only on the assumption that "the power" is a person capable or incapable of making this or that achieve concreteness or that "the power" possesses a will to ordain this or that event. Still, Arnold uses "power" transnaturally or poetically, as a correlative of righteousness or salvation which are not "powers" or "states" but terms pointing to ideal, but evolvand fulfillments.'20 Trilling concluded that "we cannot think modernly in ancient words; we betray either the one time or the other .... The emotions which a sensitive non-believer ex- periences from a well-sung requiem mass or any other elaborate ritual may have much in common with the religious emotion; they are clearly not religious. Here is poetic experience merely."'2' What Trilling did not see is that the reconstructionist intent is precisely to provide a religious option to the non-religious who have come to link religion exclusively with supernaturalism or Divine Personality. 22Transna- turalism speaks of religion in a new key, but retains traditional language in order to maintain continuity in mankind's fundamental belief that possibility, though not "reality" in the traditional sense, is nonetheless reality qua "future-unto-fulfilled- actuality." Frank Harris, concerned more about the vagueness of the "not ourselves" than the "power," one day asked Arnold about its meaning. He used his famous definition of the "Something [sic] not ourselves that makes for righteousness" to draw him out. That "not ourselves," Harris said, "always seems to me wrong. The only thing in the</page><page sequence="21">Arnoldian Elements in Kaplan's Theology 209 world that makes for righteousness is the holy spirit of man." Arnold replied "with a quaint half-smile, 'What about sunsets and flowers and the song of birds-and the song of birds?. . and the music of the spheres. Will you deny them all'?"'23 Trilling's passage can safely be stood on its head and revised to read: "We can- not think at all without ancient words. But we need not think anciently in ancient words. Neither fire nor ether nor man nor God are necessarily what they used to be. The non-believer's emotions are his own in his non-religious preference. But his ideas depend on the meaning he associates with things, events, and terms linked to them." Too, meanings are religious or non-religious according to whether or not they relate to the future open unto salvation or what this writer calls The Promise of Existence. When art is so intensified - or "touched with emotion" -as to express this kind of thinking and feeling about reality-yet-to-be-fulfilled, it speaks religious language. In fact, it is religious form and substance. On this point, Arnold and Kaplan prophesy in the same tongue. Charles Edward Montague, British novelist and essayist, recalled that in his youth, "in those remote eighties," he once saw Arnold on Oxford's Merton Street: ". . . no italics, no capitals, not all the massed resources of typographical emphasis could tell you the fervor with which we swore by Arnold. ..." For "was it not he who had taught us the delicate fascination of doubt, and the tremors, the thrills, the delicious venturings and flutterings of spiritual trouble?" It was Arnold under whose "winning conductorship there was in- tellectual luxury to be got out of tottering creeds and melting rigidities." It was Arnold who "taught our adolescent sense to snuff up such delectable fragrance among the fragments of the orthodoxy which he shattered for us with a grace and courtesy so remarkable." It was he who "filled our gardens with a scent of nice crushed Fundamentalism in an age when that redoubtable word was yet unborn."'24 A century later, however, much more than "delicious venturing," "delectable fragrance," and "intellectual luxury" was involved in at least one of the "gardens." Through Kaplan's work in Jewish religion, Arnold inscribed himself in the necessary labors on behalf of Jewish intellectual continuity and renewal. NOTES 1.

In 1905-06 Kaplan made extensive notes of this work, amounting to over 100 pages of excerpts and summaries, in both Hebrew and English. 3. Cf., Felix Adler, Creed and Deed (New York, 5th ed., 1894 [1877]): The motto of the Society for Ethical Culture is "Not by the Creed but by the Deed" (p. 1). 4. This brings to mind Max Kadushin's chapter on "Normal Mysticism" in his The Rabbinic Mind (New York, 2nd ed., 1965 [1952]), pp. 194-272. Such mysticism is (1). experience of God in various modes; (2). God-experience which makes everyday phenomena significant; (3). a mystical consciousness of God expressed in berakhoth and prayers. "Experience of God as manifest in His love, His justice, His holiness, was something without which life was unthinkable." The experience, however, was "unaccom- panied by psychic phenomena such as visions or locutions" (p. 252).</page><page sequence="22">210 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES 5.

In his autobiography, Bertrand Russell recorded the following episode. In 1901, he and his wife Alys lived in the same house with Alfred North Whitehead and his family. Mrs. Whitehead had become more and more of an invalid and would have intense chest pains. "One day,.. .when we came home, we found Mrs. Whitehead undergoing an unusually severe bout of pain. She seemed cut off from everyone and everything by walls of agony, and the sense of the solitude of each human soul suddenly overwhelmed me. ... Suddenly the ground seemed to give way beneath me, and I found myself in quite another region. Within five minutes I went through some such reflections as the following: the loneliness of the human soul is unendurable; nothing can penetrate it except the highest intensity of the sort of love that religious teachers have preached. .. .At the end of those five minutes, I had become a completely dif- ferent person. For a time, a sort of mystic illumination possessed me" (The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell 1872-1914 [New York, 1968 &lt;1951&gt;], pp. 193 f.). 7.

At least a decade later, the Committee on Revisions of the Union Prayer-book reported to the Central Conference of American Rabbis the opinion about its new prayer-book, expressed by the chairman of the Committee, Dr. Frank W. Chandler, Professor of English Literature at the University of Cincinnati. Dr. Chandler, employed as an authority on English, wrote that he had carefully read the English text of the revised edition of The Union Prayer-book for Jewish Worship and that he had found its language "simple, rich, sincere and beautiful" and its sentiments such "as any intelligent and reverent person must respond to with quickened faith in 'the power not ourselves that makes for righteousness' " (Central Conference of American Rabbis Annual, 28 [1918], 66).

A similarly frank attempt to free the Bible from its super- natural moorings was Walter R. Cassel's, Supernatural Religion: An Inquiry into the Reality of Divine Revelation, published anonymously in 1874 and republished in numerous editions. Arnold, however, at- tacked it in God and the Bible on the grounds that it leaves the ordinary reader "with the sense that he sees his Bible with a thousand holes picked in it and fatally discredited as an authority" (Matthew Arnold, God and the Bible, ed. by Robert H.

Apparently the formula had become so popular that authors cited it without crediting Arnold by name. Here are some examples: Calvin Coolidge in a speech on 4 July 1916 said: "History is revelation. It is the manifestation in human affairs of a 'power not ourselves that makes for righteousness' " (cited from Cleveland Plain Dealer, 4 July 1981). Andrew D. White wrote in the In- tro. to Vol. 1 of his A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology (New York, 1917 [1896], p. xii):</page><page sequence="23">Arnoldian Elements in Kaplan's Theology 211 "My conviction is that Science. . .will go hand in hand with Religion; and that ...Religion, as seen in the recognition of 'a Power, in the Universe, not ourselves, which makes for righteousness,'. . .will steadily grow stronger ..." In Vol. II, however, White praised Arnold because in the light of his "genius a con- ception of our sacred books at the same time more literary as well as more scientific has grown widely and vigorously" (pp. 390 f.). William E. Hocking paraphrased the formula in his The Meaning of God in Human Experience (New Haven, Conn., 1963 [1912]): "Optimism, I say, requires. . .belief in an in- dividual Reality not-ourselves which makes for rightness, and which actually accomplishes rightness when left to its own working" (p. 177). Cyrus L. Sulzberger referred to it in his paper on "For Our Children's Children: A Layman's Faith" (cited by Morris D. Waldman in "Cyrus L. Sulzberger," American Jewish Year Book, 35 [1933], 149): " 'If it be realized that our individual conduct bears on the well-being of the world, that rightdoing advances and wrongdoing retards the advent of that righteousness for which the Power, not ourselves, is working,. . .we get an appreciation of what it means to Be Holy because God is Holy'." 25. Kaplan, The Meaning of God in Modern Jewish Religion (New York, 1962 [1937], pp. 40-103, hereafter called Meaning). 26. Arnold consistently wrote, "The Power, not ourselves" etc. I do not know why Kaplan modified it. I note that in his The Future of Judaism in America (New Rochelle, N. Y., 1934), Eugene Kohn, for many years Kaplan's co-worker and editor of The Reconstructionist, cites the for- mula-without naming Arnold-as " 'That Being not ourselves that makes for righteousness' " (p. 206). To Arnold, however, "Being" would have been a theological rather than a religious term. 27. Meaning, pp. 302 f. 28. Kaplan, The Future of the American Jew (New York, 1948), p. 323 (hereafter called Future). Kaplan quotes this line from Richard H. Tawney, Equality (1929). Arnold wrote it in the Preface to Mixed Essays of 1897. For its recent edition, see Arnold, Essays Religious and Mixed, ed. by R. H. Super (Ann Arbor, Mich., 1972), p. 372. In this Preface, Arnold explained his term "nature." It means, first, man's "instinct of expansion" which is simply "the love of liberty." Hence absolutism, even what Bismarck called "benevolent rational absolutism," is against nature. It means, second, the love of equali- ty. Inequality, too, thwarts the power of human nature which makes for civilization. 29. Kaplan, Not So Random Thoughts (New York, 1966), p. 137. 30.

Kaplan wrote that "he has considered religion, recognizing its place in the tout ensemble of Jewish culture as primal and central, but suggesting that its character can no longer be of the thaumaturgic type or credal type which flourished in the past, but of the humanistic type which is based upon vital present-day needs, both personal and social" ("Judaism as a Civilization," Pro- ceedings of the Twenty-eighth Annual Conference of the Rabbinical Assembly of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 25-27 June 1928, p. 119 [see also pp. 124 f.]). In God and the Bible, p. 369, Ar- nold commented: ". . . Although an educated Protestant may manage to retain for his own lifetime the belief in miracles in which he has been brought up, yet his children will lose it; so to an educated Catholic we may say, putting the change only a little farther off, that (unless some unforeseen deluge should over- whelm European civilization, leaving everything to be begun anew) his grandson will lose it," much as the educated classes in the eighteenth century saw the gradual extinction of the belief in witchcraft. 53.

Arnold confessed (ibid., p. 51), that his knowledge of Hebrew was not sufficient to do more than "to follow and weigh the reasons offered by others in support of their judgments." He also inspected the Jews' Free School in London. On 21 May 1884 he delivered an address at a fundraising banquet for the school (Arnold, Philistinism in England and America, ed. by R. H.

Dissent and Dogma, p. 143. Arnold is not likely to have subscribed to John Fiske's Ch. XIV, "The Power that makes for Righteousness" in his The Idea of God as Affected by Modern Knowledge (Boston, 1885). According to Fiske, "all things" are "working together toward the evolution of the highest spiritual attributes of Man." Hence "God is in the deepest sense a moral Being. The everlasting source of phenomena is none other than the infinite Power that makes for righteousness" (pp. 166 f.). Yet Arnold would have agreed with Bertrand Russell who, at the age of sixteen, wrote in his diary on 27 May 1888: "We stand in want of a new Luther to renew faith and invigorate Christianity and to do what do the Unitarians.... For religions grow old like trees unless reformed from time to time. Christianity of the ex- isting kinds has had its day. We want a new form in accordance with science and yet helpful to a good life" (The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell 1872-1914 [New York, 1968 &lt;1967&gt;], pp. 59 f.). 79.

Pascal, Pensdes, no. 485, preceded Arnold, partly: ". .. as we cannot love what is outside ourselves, we must love a being who is in us, and is not ourselves; and that is true of each and all men. Now, only the Universal Being is such. The kingdom of God is within us, is ourselves-and not ourselves." 90. Dissent and Dogma, p. 183. 91. Ibid. 92. Ibid., p. 184. 93. Ibid., p. 185. 94. Ibid. 95.

The scientific and more inclusive formula appears first in Arnold's St. Paul and Protestantism (1869): "The stream of tendency by which all things seek to fulfil the law of their being" (in Dissent and Dogma, p. 10). By contrast, Theodore Parker "could never accept in place of the living God any 'stream of tendency,' or 'power not ourselves making for righteousness' "(cited from James Freeman Clarke's Intro. to Theodore Parker, Views of Religion [Boston, 1894, 4th ed.], p. vii). 98. The verse numbers of the Hebrew Bible are used here. 99. Dissent and Dogma, p. 193. At a farewell dinner in honor of Herbert Spencer, held in New York City on 9 November 1882, Fiske cited Arnold's formula and noted "that it is really of much more concern to us that there is an eternal Power, not ourselves, that makes for righteousness, than that such a Power is onefold or threefold in its metaphysical nature, or that we ought not to play cards on Sunday or eat meat on Friday" (Fiske, Excursions of an Evolutionist [Boston, 1902 &lt;1883&gt;], p. 272).

Kenneth Hamilton, Revolt against Heaven-An Inquiry into Anti-Supernatur- alism (Grand Rapids, Mich., 1965), comments on this passage that "we have here a remarkable anticipa- tion of Tillich's definition of faith as the state of being absolutely or unconditionally concerned.... [I]t is evident that emotion for Arnold was no mere subjective state but a receptiveness opening the self to reali- ty beyond appearances (in Tillich's terminology, ecstatic reason or the dimension of depth). It is in this context that we have to read his appeal to the power not ourselves that makes for righteousness." Hamilton goes on to argue that the empirical approach to religion such as Arnold's "is simply the metaphysical-mystical approach disguised." 102. Dissent and Dogma, p. 105. 103.

This is why Samuel M. Melamed was wrong when, in Spinoza and Buddha- Visions of a Dead God (Chicago, Ill., 1933), he wrote that Arnold "substituted ethical idealism for supernatural religion" (p. 90). 112. William F. Connell, The Educational Thought and Influence of Matthew Arnold (London, 1950), pp. 280 f., 158 f.; Melamed, Spinoza and Buddha, noted that Arnold often described the "not ourselves" as a natural law or as world order, but this "is a mere expression of Spinozism" (p. 90n.). Melamed, unfortunately did not document this criticism. 113. William A. Madden, Matthew Arnold-A Study of the Aesthetic Temperament in Victorian England (Bloomington, Ind., 1967), pp. 158 f. 114.

Bradley, Ethical Studies (Oxford, 1927), ridicules the idea that religion can be identified with the ideal-to-be or the should-be (pp. 315 ff.). 121. Trilling, Matthew Arnold, p. 365. Back in 1886, Marie Jean Guyau argued against Arnold, in The Non-Religion of the Future (New York, 1897), that "the absorption of religion into morality is one with the dissolution of all positive and determinate religion, of all traditional symbolism, and of all dogmatism" and that "Mr. Arnold does not perceive that, if the reality is, as he says, the greatest and most beautiful of things, we have no further need of the legend of Christianity, not even interpreted as he interprets it: the real world, and by the real world I understand the moral not less than the physical universe, should prove abundantly sufficient for us" (pp. 194, 191). One answer to both Guyau and Trilling is that about need, like de gustibus-non est disputandum. The need to reinterpret religion is as real as the need to adhere to religion reinterpreted. One is tempted to generalize that all surviving religions are reinterpreted religions, and they survive because of the interpretations. 122. Lytton Strachey quotes Florence Nightingale's line, "we cannot conceive that Omnipotent Righteousness would find satisfaction in solitary existence" (Eminent Victorians [New York, 1918]), p. 192. This shows, I think how the Bible's and Arnold's "righteousness" is readily drafted by an- thropomorphism to do duty on behalf of supernaturalism and superpersonalism. 123.
