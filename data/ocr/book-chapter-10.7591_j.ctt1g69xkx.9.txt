The lectures were meant to give  the subject a "popular" treatment, and the volume was popular indeed.  It was very well received by critics, and Pater counted it as the favorite  among all his works. '  Perhaps because they were written as lectures,  the essays on Plato display an exceptional crispness and clarity of  formulation. In new terms-motion and rest, centrifugal and centripe­ tal, Ionian and Dorian-these essays rehearse the dialectic of aesthetic  historicism on the stage of ancient Greece.  In Plato and Platonism and the Greek Studies, Pater becomes a  " student of origins. "  He begins, as usual, with a strong commitment  to absolute historicity, change, and difference-in attention to the  specific landscapes, "races, " and material practices of Ionians and  Dorians, for example .  And, as usual, his method works from that point  to its dialectical antithesis, the commitment to search out perma­ nence and repetition in the universal "tendencies" of "the human  mind itself . " Perhaps Pater was thinking of his own work when he  compares the forms of ancient Greek art and philosophy to living  organisms.  All things are at once old and new. As, in physical organisms, the actual  particles of matter have existed long before in other combinations; and  what is really new in a new organism is the new cohering force-the  mode of life.

" But according to Pater, art not only "grows" ;   i t  also i s  aesthetically "made, /1 and therefore i t  simultaneously yields  the sense of immeasurable age and imaginative revival . This intersec­ tion of organic and aesthetic models of creation is a distinguishing  feature of Pater's aesthetic historicism, as we have seen. In the Greek  Studies, Pater discusses the figure who coaxes new forms of coherence  from "received" practice, the figure of the Interpreter. He intervenes  in organic culture to stimulate reflection, self-consciousness, and rep­ resentation. Thus the Interpreter embodies the force of cultural evolu­ tion, through which ritual practice becomes art and literature; and  after that crucial transition from archaic to literary and historical  culture, the Interpreter facilitates a periodic return to the ground of  tradition and the further evolution of cultural types.  What happens when Pater investigates the figurative "ground" of  his aesthetic historicism? His "Greek" studies (not only the posthu­ mously titled Greek Studies but Plato and Platonism as well ) do  precisely that. Those essays retrospectively arc back over all the inter­ vening ages to return to the origins of the tradition in which they still  participate.  Besides [the] conditions of time and place, and independent of them,  there is also an element of permanence, a standard of taste, which genius  confesses. This standard is maintained in a purely intellectual tradition .  . . . The supreme artistic products of succeeding generations thus form a  series of elevated points, taking each from each the reflexion of a strange  light, the source of which is not in the atmosphere around and above  them, but in a stage of society remote from ours. This standard takes its  rise in Greece, at a definite historical period. (R, 1 99 )   Framed by a commitment to  historical particularity, this passage  from The Renaissance describes the "remote" and "strange" origin  of a standard of historical repetition. The figure of the " series of  elevated points" recalls the relief of periodic return to that "high"  standard.  Both the Greek Studies and Plato and Platonism enact the "relief"  of that return. In both volumes Pater attempts to delve beneath the  ground, so to speak, in an archaeological exploration of the prehistoric,  mythic world of oral tradition. For Pater, mythic story evolves within  a primeval, undifferentiated unity prior to the primary division of self­ consciousness which makes for representation. Both literature and  history come into being through successive "divisions" of this origi- </page> <page sequence="3"> Greek Studies and Plato and Platonism · 237  •  nary, mythic field. Pater formulates a history of myth which traces  its evolution in three phases, and it is interesting to note that his own  exposition of the history of myth is a recognizable example of his  third, or "ethical, " phase. In that phase, the persons and events of  myth are reinterpreted as "abstract symbols, because intensely charac­ teristic examples, of moral or spiritual conditions" (GS, 9 1-9 3 ) . Pater  traces this spiritual development through analogical repetitions, and  thus his histories of myth become an example of his own myth of  history. Like typological exegesis, this mode of interpretation finds  greater spirituality in the later phases.  Plato and Platonism, too, explores the origination of history and  literature, through the figure who forms the "standard of taste" for  late-nineteenth-century English historians of philosophy.2 In this  work Pater attends to the history of philosophy as well as to the  philosophy of history. He sees the figure of Plato as an embodiment of  the moment oral tradition is transformed into literary representation.  Thus the figure of Plato marks the end of one line of development  and the beginning of another. To articulate the manifold richness of  inarticulate prehistory that he comprehends, Pater makes Plato the  third term of a dialectical genealogy, and to emphasize that point he  repeats it in another figure. The figure of Socrates, too, synthesizes  philosophical prehistory, and Plato gives that prior, unwritten synthe­ sis a literary form. In the specular relation between Socrates and Plato,  Pater imagines the generation of literary history. The " actual" Socratic  dialogue becomes articulate through the aesthetic representation of  Platonic dialectic.  Mythic character is fundamental to Pater's theory of literary history,  and his figure of Plato is a modern re-creation of the form of mythic  characterization. In the Paterian Plato the forces of prehistory and  history have been conflated, consolidated, and totalized under the  auspices of a mythic name. Like the refined figures of Persephone, or  Dionysus Zagreus, which had been separated out in time from the  mythic manifold of Demeter or Dionysus, the historical differentia­ tions marked by later "Platonism" may be seen as "aspects" of a  former, mythic totality. Pater's frequent analogies between Plato and  contemporary nineteenth-century figures make it seem as if Pater is  "identifying" with Plato. But like the narrator of "The Child in the  House" or of Marius the Epicurean, the persona created here need not  2.

It would be better to  insist on the effacement of that individuality, for the lecturer on  Plato stages a transparency like that of "Diaphaneite, " transmitting  received views with a coherence that gives them aesthetic form.3 It is  always worth insisting on the status of Pater's persona as an aesthetic  creation, a figure, for again Pater stages the modern voice as the  medium of historical recollection.  r · Histories of Myth: The Greek Studies  Pater's analyses of Greek myths are grounded in the historical sense,  though they tend finally toward a myth of history. He begins by  emphasizing the absolute historicity of myth, interpreting it as the  expression of specific, material practices, which he calls "modes of  existence" (GS, 10 ) :  Myth is begotten among a primitive people, as they wondered over the  life of the thing their hands helped forward, till it became for them a kind  of spirit, and their culture of it a kind of worship. (GS, 29 )   In this view, religion reflects the material culture of  a people; i t  is  expressed in a story, a "projected expression" composite of themselves  and their crop in mutual dependency.  Therefore, Pater argues, we should speak not of the religion but of the  religions of ancient Greece, each one expressed by its own "sacred repre­ sentation or interpretation of the whole human experience" (GS, 10 ) .  As the religion of Demeter carries us back to the cornfields and farm­ steads of Greece, and places us, in fancy, among a primitive race, in the  furrow and beside the granary; so the religion of Dionysus carries us back  to its vineyards, and is a monument of the ways and thoughts of people  whose days go by beside the winepress, and under the green and purple  shadows, and whose material happiness depends on the crop of grapes .  . . . That garland of ivy, the aesthetic value of which is so great in the  later imagery of Dionysus and his descendents, the leaves of which,  3. Shuter calls for an end to treating Plato and Platonism simply as a stage in the  evolution of Pater's thought, and for an end to treating Pater's view of Plato as a mask  for his own ideas (William F. Shuter, "Pater on Plato: 'Subjective' or 'Sound' ?

(GS, 9-101 2 1 )   Each "mode of existence" is "peculiar" to a certain race, class, and  geographical location, and each myth changes in time as the people's  mode of existence changes.  "The wilder people have wilder gods, . . .   changing ever with the worshippers in whom they live and move and  have their being" (R, 203 ) .  Of course, this stress on the absolute  historicity of cultural products is the familiar starting-place of Pater's  "historic method. " '   In this volume Pater relies on the other principal argument of the  "historic method" as well, when he insists that the theory of develop­ ment is as much the key to "the comparative science of religions" as  to any other of the human sciences (GS, I I ) :  Here again, . . . t he idea of development, of degrees, of a slow and natural  growth, impeded here, diverted there, is the illuminating thought which  earlier critics lacked. (GS, 1 2 1-22 )   In the Greek Studies, Pater works back through the history of a myth's  development toward the original "mode of existence" that the myth  expressed. "We feel our way backwards, " he explains, and we "must  be content to follow faint traces" (GS, I I 1-12 ) .  These "traces" lead  the "student of origins" toward an original mythic unity that can  never be directly grasped or known. Later literary expressions of the  original material lend only mediate access to the time when "use and  beauty are still undivided" (GS, 1 97 ) :   Their story went back . . . w ith unbroken continuity . . . t o a past, stretch­ ing beyond, yet continuous with, actual memory, in which heaven and  earth mingled. (GS, 3 3 )   In other words, Pater conceives prehistoric culture as an originary  manifold from which mythic "conceptions" (and later, literature) are  articulated by degrees. Even though he places quite a pointed emphasis  on the material ground from which myth grows, Pater portrays this  I. Iser points to Pater's participation here in an anthropological model current in  the nineteenth century, which explained myth as a consecration of basic human needs  and practices and "reduced all phenomena that claimed to be supernatural or religious  to their human origins, as exemplified by Feuerbach's anthropological reduction of  Christianity" (Wolfgang Iser, Walter Pater: The Aesthetic Moment [Cambridge: Cam­ bridge University Press, 1987 ], p.  107) .   </page> <page sequence="6"> • 240 • Greek Studies and Plato and Platonism  ground as forever inaccessible and inarticulate. History is the record  of differences and divisions, of growth away from an original mythic  unity.  In the Greek Studies, Pater develops a theory of literary history  which describes the emergence of literature against this prehistoric  background. All Greek myths, he claims, develop through the same  three phases : an oral, "half-conscious, instinctive" phase, "living from  mouth to mouth, " in which concrete features of nature are first seen  as symbolic; a written, "conscious, poetical or literary, phase, " in  which natural symbols are interpreted as the characters and incidents  of narrative; and a self-conscious or "ethical" phase, in which charac­ ter and plot are reinterpreted as "abstract symbols, because intensely  characteristic examples, of moral or spiritual conditions" (GS, 9 1-9 3 ) .   In each phase, then, acts of interpretation generate greater levels of  generalization and spirituality than in the former phase.These phases  of myth provide yet another formulation of the three-stage romantic  dialectic of development. As usual, Pater's analysis equates the  "higher" development with the later, more abstract phase.  How then do mythic stories form and transform themselves ? As  in Marius, Pater offers in the Greek Studies both evolutionary and  aesthetic explanations of the process. On the one hand, he describes  the evolution of myth as "a struggle for life, " in which some myths  "never emerged from that first stage of popular conception, or were  absorbed by stronger competitors" (GS, r 1 3 ) . Stories begin "like other  things . . . f or which no one in particular is responsible. "  In this stage  of archaic collectivity, the division between "nature" and "culture"  has not yet taken place.  But on the other hand, the mechanism to which Pater ascribes this  "natural selection" is clearly not natural at all. Myths that die do so  because "they lacked the sacred poet or prophet, and were never  remodelled by literature. "  In other words, someone in particular is  responsible for the survival of a story. To become "fit" enough to  "survive, " popular conception must be seized by a poet, a prophet, or  a priest-exegete and "remodelled by literature. "' This moment of  aesthetic responsibility marks the division between nature and cul­ ture and the emergence of distinctly divided roles or functions ( "po­ ets, " "prophets, " "interpreters" )  against the archaic background of  communal wholeness. In the Greek Studies, Pater manages to balance  the claims of both evolutionary and aesthetic explanations by focusing  2. Pater plays here both with Social-Darwinian and Hegelian connotations of "sur­ vival . "   </page> <page sequence="7"> Histories of Myth · 241 •  toward the mythic moment when "natural" and "cultural" explana­ tions have not fully distinguished themselves from one another. As  in Marius, Pater wants to have it both ways : literature grows organi­ cally, and it is aesthetically made.  Yet myth must evolve into literature or it dies, never to emerge  from prehistoric obscurity. Thus, according to this view, the very  category "literature" is defined by its consciousness of having revised  earlier mythic material. The literary process of "remodelling" myth  fundamentally depends upon the development of character, which  "fixes" and at the same time "humanises" man's conception of the  unseen. A primitive people first "project" away from (and therefore  reflect back to) themselves a recognizable image of their total culture.  In this stage, to "humanise" means to "condense" the flux of natural  conditions into one familiar form.  The office of the imagination . . . i s thus to condense the impressions of  natural things into human form; to retain that early mystical sense of wa­ ter, or wind, or light, in the moulding of eye and brow; to arrest it, or rather,  perhaps, to set it free, there, as human expression. The body of man, indeed,  was for the Greeks still the genuine work of Prometheus; its connexion  with earth and air . . . [ was] direct and immediate. (GS, 32-3 3 )   That the human body can serve as such a complex and totalizing  image indicates at once the closeness to nature of the mythic imagina­ tion and at the same time the beginning of its separation from nature,  because the "refining" of nature in man's own image has already  begun. The history of myth describes further developments in this  process of "humanising" nature.  The full process of character formation involves a dialectic of con­ densation and generalization through which a character is gradually  "arrested" and at the same time "set free, " both embodied and spiritu­ alized. Beginning in the care of an individual vine, for example, as the  vine-grower "stoops over it, coaxing and nursing it, like a pet animal  or a little child, " the mythic consciousness attributes a spirit first to  one vine and then to the whole species (GS, 1 3 ) .  But after being  generalized, this spirit must again be "condensed"-fixated and total­ ized-as a personal spirit. As they dream and brood over the life of  their crops, an ancient people "harmonise" those dreams into a human  character. Mythic imagination is "a unifying or identifying power,  bringing together things naturally asunder . . . w elding into something  like the identity of a human personality the whole range of man's  experiences" (GS, 29 ) .  But after disparate material conditions are iden- </page> <page sequence="8"> • 242 · Greek Studies and Plato and Platonism  tified as a person, the process of spiritualization-and even of further  embodiment-goes on. The establishment of character enables inci­ dent or plot, and the further elaboration of plot brings mythic character  closer and closer to human moods, sympathies, and conduct. Both "A  Study of Dionysus"  and "The Myth of Demeter and Persephone" are  essays in the articulation of this process.  For example, early in her development, Demeter represents the  chthonic forces of the earth in general. Demeter and Persephone are  not at this point clearly differentiated from one another. Later, two  personae express the division of earth's cycle into seasons of hot and  cold, fertile and barren, summer and winter. With the "invention"  of Persephone (GS, 122 )-that is, her separation from the manifold  concept of Demeter-the earth's seasonal changes are definitively  interpreted as a mother's grief at separation from her daughter. (The  earliest division of self-consciousness, the initial separation of nature  and culture, is thus expressed through the separation of two characters  from the primeval manifold, which is in tum expressed by their per­ sonal separation from one another. )  This characterization provides the  framework for appropriate incident; Demeter searches for Persephone  across the vast earth and over the course of the seasonal year, and "she  becomes in her long wanderings, almost wholly humanised" (GS, II8  ) .   Demeter and Persephone, then, embody the contradictions of  time  and nature in a familial or genealogical relation between two persons. 3  Dionysus, on the other hand, incorporates natural oppositions under  the auspices of one persona. Thus he becomes, as Pater entitles his  study, the "spiritual form of fire and dew. " The alternating harshness  and solace of early spring, its erratic chill and warmth (both dangers  to the growing vine), are personified in the complex life history of  Dionysus, who was "born" twice, first in the fire of Zeus's lightning  approach to Semele, and then, after a protective gestation in the cloudy  thigh of Zeus, through Hye, the dew (GS, 26-7 ) .  These incidents of a  life story "explain" the origins of his contradictory and erratic charac­ ter, and his character, conversely, resolves the contradictions of nature  by unifying them as aspects of one person's life history.  Both "literary" and "ethical" phases of myth register an increase in  spirit, which is produced through this dialectical process of generaliza­ tion and "condensation. " First the single vine is granted a spirit,  then that spirit is generalized to cover all vines .  Finally, the general  characteristics of all vines are transfigured as one human form, unified  3.

Narrative incidents collect  around this center of attention and are then more generally interpreted  themselves, so that finally, in the "ethical" phase, the spirit of Diony­ sus comes to represent the force of life itself.  He is the soul of the individual vine, first; . . . a fterwards, the soul of the  whole species, the spirit of fire and dew, alive and leaping in a thousand  vines, as the higher intelligence, brooding more deeply over things, pur­ sues, in thought, the generation of sweetness and strength in the veins  of the tree, the transformation of water into wine . . . ;  and shadowing  forth, in each pause of the process, an intervening person. . . . So they  passed on to think of Dionysus . . . not merely as the soul of the vine,  but of all that life in flowing things of which the vine is the symbol,  because its most emphatic example. !GS, 1 3 )   I t  i s  interesting to follow Pater's figural maneuvers in this passage. He  uses an ostensibly material transformation lof water into wine) to  represent a " spiritual" transformation (of a natural symbol into a  "higher" potency) .  The "generation of sweetness and strength in the  veins of the tree"-in other words, the transformative power of na­ ture-has been metaphorically equated with the conversion of water  into wine, or the transformation of nature into culture. !This figure is  also resonant, for anyone reading in Pater's tradition, with the Chris­ tian association to the miracle at Cana; thus the "higher intelligence"  seems also to hint at the secularization-effect produced by the transfor­ mation of Greek myth into Christian story. ) In this "higher" phase,  the rarefied, cultured product of the vine, the wine, symbolizes the  original, natural power hidden within the growing plant. What is  "expressed" or squeezed out of the original vine is made to symbolize  what was occult, interior, and hidden.4 Finally the vine, which in  the first stage was represented by "Dionysus, " becomes itself the  representative symbol of "all life. " We begin with the vine and we  end with the vine, but in the end the exemplary organism has become  a symbol of the "spirit" in nature. This circuit of figuration uses  personification as an intermediate stage, between nature and pure  4. See also the process of figuration in the following passage: "The history of Greek  art, then, begins, as some have fancied general history to begin, in a golden age, but in  an age, so to speak, of real gold, the period of those first twisters and hammerers of the  precious metals . . . . T he heroic age of Greek art is the age of the hero as smith" !GS,  1 92-93 ). Here again a spiritual or mythic meaning la "golden age")  is grounded in a  realistic, historical phenomenon !surviving objects crafted in gold) .   </page> <page sequence="10"> • 244 • Greek Studies and Plato and Platonism  spirit. Thus the figure of personification is itself the symbol of a  certain figurative agenda here : to grant "spirit" to organic matter. 5  Representing "spirit" is most commonly a matter of figuratively  dividing an interior from an exterior. In this connection, Pater offers  a wonderful little myth of aesthetic history to explain the invention  of modeling in sculpture. This art form has particular significance in  the Greek Studies because of its human subject of representation, and  here Pater interprets its formal invention as the establishment of  insides and outsides :  The love-sick daughter of the artist . . . o utlines on the wall the profile  of her lover as he sleeps in the lamplight, to keep by her in absence- . . .   The father fills up the outline . . . a nd hence the art of modelling from  the life in clay. (GS, 2 3 1 )   This tiny "butterfly wing" of incident (as Pater calls it) gathers compli­ cated resonances in its context. As he did explicitly in "Winckel­ mann, " Pater draws on the Hegelian description of art history, in  which different art forms successively represent stages in the growth  of world-historical self-consciousness. 6 Here the human form is  granted interiority as the father "fills up" the empty outline with solid  matter. (And incidentally, the paternal figure in this little story is a  recognizable secularization of God as artist, endowing the human  form with "life . " )  Thus even Greek sculpture, which in "Winckel­ mann" stood for the earliest and most purely physical or "objective"  stage of aesthetic form, is seen to have resulted from the division of  exterior form and interior content. Even within the "repose" of classi­ cal origins, the romantic spirit has already begun to brood.  In his essay "Romanticism, " written in 1 876  between his studies  of Demeter and of Dionysus, Pater uses similar terms to describe  the two "tendencies" in aesthetic history.7 Classical art begins by  5 .

The classi­ cist has been impressed with "the comeliness of the old, immemorial,  well-recognised types in art and literature" and "will entertain no  matter which will not go easily and flexibly into them" (A, 2 5 7 ) .   Romantic art, on the other hand, begins with "untried matter, still in  fusion. " Romantic artists must  by the very vividness and heat of their conception, purge away . . . a ll  that is not organically appropriate to it, till the whole effect adjusts itself  in clear, orderly, proportionate form; which form, after a very little time,  becomes classical in its tum. (A, 2 5 8 )   These two "tendencies" describe movement in opposite directions,  romantics burning away excess matter to create form, and classicists  filling up an empty (though prior) form with appropriate matter. Each  movement figuratively "begins" with a different pole of the formal  dialectic :  romantic art with matter, classical art with form. Pater  himself "begins" with the classical moment of the dialectic, but even  so, a prior phase is implied, for how otherwise could the classical form  have become so "well-recognised" ?  One effect of Pater's chiasmic formulation here is to associate both  "form" and "matter" with the novelty of emergent "spirit, " the vector  force toward future transformation which Pater associates with ro­ mantic "energy" :  romantic : matter &gt; form (spirit, energy)  classical : fo�atter ( spirit, energy)  The temporal dimension of this dialectic is signified by the dialectical  reversal of the term "form" :  the significance of romantic "form" is  itself transformed through time into its very opposite, the "well­ recognised type, " the classical form. "Matter" and "form" in this  essay are every bit as relative and dialectically dependent terms as are  "classical" and "romantic. " 8  By emphasizing the dialectical relation,  through his repeated definition of these movements as "tendencies, "  Pater manages to argue both for permanently coexisting ideal struc­ tures and for alternating periods of art-historical difference; thus he  manages to balance material and formal principles in his own theory.  8. For a helpful discussion of the difference between the form/matter distinction  and the form/content distinction, see Claudio Guillen, "On the Uses of Literary Genre, "  in Literature as System (Princeton, N.J. : Princeton University Press, 1 97 1 ), pp. 109-ro.  </page> <page sequence="12"> • 246 • Greek Studies and Plato and Platonism  That in itself is his most brilliant accomplishment in this essay, which  works throughout to relativize all such critical distinctions.  But for our immediate purposes the importance both of Pater's myth  of the sculptor's lovesick daughter and of his essay on romanticism is  that they show the language of insides and outsides operating not  only to describe the coherence of any particular art form, but also to  describe principles of art-historical development. History begins when  inarticulate matter is given "spiritual form, " and ever afterward the  gradual expression (externalization, objectification, "projection" )  of  interiority describes the course of that history.9 Both literature and  history are simultaneously established in this initial division of  mythic unity, and this moment is expressed by means of personal  figures.  Mythic characters incorporate, by representing in one place,  the vicissitudes and contradictions of nature, material practice, and  temporal process. Divisions in time, which Pater also seeks to convey  through dialectical forms of argumentation, are in this mode spatial­ ized as a body. Pater's historicism relies on this form of mythic person­ ification as the paradigm for aesthetic-historical objectification of  "spirit. "  In the Greek Studies, for example, Pater totalizes primitive culture  in such a personal figure : a primitive people "can but work outward  what is within them, " Pater explains simply (GS, 2 1 2 ) .  Or elsewhere,  he explicitly figures the moment of emergence into art and history as  the moment an "informing" soul is breathed into matter to create a  body:  A world of material splendour, moulded clay, beaten gold, polished  stone;-the informing, reasonable soul entering into that, reclaiming the  metal and stone and clay, till they are as full of living breath as the real  warm body itself; the presence of those two elements is continuous  throughout the fortunes of Greek art after the heroic age, and the constant  right estimate of their action and reaction, from period to period, its true  philosophy. (GS, 223 )   In other words, Pater operates these personal figures on the usual  graduating levels of generalization: the level of the artist, expressing  individual interiority; the level of the Zeitgeist in its particular stage  of development; and the level of the transhistorical Geist, expressed  through periodic "phases" of developing self-consciousness. It is clear  9.

One important line of argument in the Greek Stud­ ies is devoted to answering this question. In another attempt to formu­ late the inarticulate, prehistoric ground of development, Pater empha­ sizes the temporal priority of ritual, or religious "usages, " over  "conceptions" or stories. Myth emerges from its prehistory to enter  its "literary" phase at the moment it can be seen as "divided" between  "outward imagery" and "inner sense. "  The various versions of a "liter­ ary" myth progressively interpret the religious ritual, which becomes  more impressive to worshipers as its "outward imagery" more pre­ cisely expresses its "inner sense" !GS, 1 2 1 ) . In this reflexive relation  between unconceptualized ritual and interpretation or narrative, Pater  finds the mechanism through which practice is gradually coaxed into  self-consciousness. And the agency of this process is a personal figure.  Before there were storytellers, Pater explains, exegetae conveyed  the significance of ritual practices to the people !GS, 227 ) .  In mythic  culture, the office of dividing "outward imagery" from "inner sense"  and relating them to each other falls to the priest-exegete, or "inter­ preter. "  There were religious usages before there were distinct religious concep­ tions, and these antecedent religious usages shape and determine, at  many points, the ultimate religious conception, as the details of the myth  interpret or explain the religious custom. The hymn relates the legend  of certain holy places, to which various impressive religious rites had  attached themselves-the holy well, the old fountain, the stone of sor­ row, which it was the office of the "interpreter" of the holy places to  show to the people. (GS, 1 20 )   </page> <page sequence="14"> • 248 • Greek Studies and Plato and Platonism  The establishment of mythic character and of the role of interpreter  are thus dialectically related events, and the interpreter thus becomes  a sort of artist of historical development. '  Character emerges from  "the primitive mythical figure" through the ritual dramatization of  "mysteries"  (GS, 1 2 1 ), and that character is embellished through the  exegetical intervention of "interpreters, " who "project" expressive  incident in more and more elaborate sequences. Because mythic "rep­ resentation" is already the result of "interpretation, " the two terms  are consequently used interchangeably in the Greek Studies (e .g. ,  GS,  r o ) . In Pater's scheme, then, the literary functions of character, plot,  and concept or theme all serve to embody an interpretation of some­ thing prior to themselves; narrative is the form of the already-interpre­ ted which demands further interpretation.  Pater's italicized stress on the word "interpreter" suggests an at­ tempt to focus attention on its nuances. The "inter-preter" puts him­ self between, divides, or intervenes.  In the specific case of mythic  Greek culture, the interpreter intervenes between a people and them­ selves, establishing the distance of self-consciousness between uncon­ scious practice and representation. In this sense the interpreter is  absolutely the precondition of historical expression, for without inter­ pretation a figurative "inside" has not been divided from a figurative  "outside. "  But in Pater's work the function of the interpreter is of  course not limited to the evolution of culture from its prehistoric,  archaic state.  Toward the beginning of "Romanticism, " Pater places the same  italicized stress on the role of the interpreter. He is at pains in this  immediate context to argue that the terms "classical" and "romantic"  should be understood not as absolute opposites but as relative " tenden­ cies" in the history of art. In the midst of this exposition of his  fundamental argument, Pater imagines the "House Beautiful, " his  spatial representation of all aesthetic history gathered together in one  place :  In that House Beautiful, which the creative minds of all generations­ the artists and those who have treated life in the spirit of art-are always  building together, for the refreshment of the human spirit, these opposi­ tions cease; and the Interpreter of the House Beautiful, the true aesthetic  critic, uses these divisions, only so far as they enable him to enter into  the peculiarities of the objects with which he has to do. (A, 241 )  I .  This is the basis, in philosophy of history, for Pater's "modem" belief in the  creative potential of criticism.  </page> <page sequence="15"> The House Beautiful · 249 •  That "House Beautiful, " like a body with an indwelling spirit, houses  all the spirits of all the ages. The model of a mythic body, federating  disparate natural impressions in one spirit, has here been generalized  and transposed; now a "House" federates many spirits of culture  under one roof. Pater's modern, mythic conception re-collects all the  differences of time in one place. The secularization of Bunyan's House  Beautiful is telling, for this is a dwelling for the figures of aesthetic  and historical culture, not the place of sacred reward. 2  This passage makes it clear that dialectical "divisions" alone testify  to the specificity of life and development in historical time, but from  the perspective of the House Beautiful, those divisions are preserved,  annulled, and transcended in a unity that is beyond time. The Inter­ preter plays a major role in each phase. At the origins of history, as  we have seen, he presides over the necessary divisions that create  literary myth, and here at the other end of the line, "the true aesthetic  critic" imagines the reunion of those divisions that, from this point  of view, can now be seen to have been merely provisional.  The very evolution of art and literature are made to seem the results  of these fundamental acts of personal intervention. Here again we see  Pater's initially firm commitment to particularity: the aesthetic critic  "uses these divisions" in order to penetrate the "peculiarities" of each  different object. But this "first step, " the commitment to historicity,  occurs in a context that subverts it with a strong image of transhistori­ cal totality. Assigning such a vast role to the creative powers of inter­ pretation is a powerful gesture of self-aggrandizement, for Pater him­ self is engaged in externalizing myth's "inwardness . "  His Greek  Studies are themselves a contribution to the latest phase of "ethical"  mythology.  3 · The Philosophy of Mythic Form  In Pater's Greek Studies we can clearly see the conceptual struggle  within historicism-between historical differentiation and transhis­ torical unity, stability, and iteration. On the one hand, Pater claims  that myth rises out of specific historical conditions, and yet on the  2.

"  He emphasizes the permanence of mythic conceptions, their presence  still within us. They are powerful  because they arose naturally out of the spirit of man, and embodied, in ade­ quate symbols, his deepest thoughts concerningt he conditions of his physical  and spiritual life, maintained their hold through many changes, and are still  not without a solemnising power even for the modem mind, which has once  admitted them as recognised and habitual inhabitants. !GS, 1 5 1 )   Pater's characteristic generalization of "the spirit of man" represents  a transhistorical, essentialist, aesthetic figure, as we have repeatedly  seen in this study, and it reflects the tendency toward synthesis and  totality which forms one pole of his aesthetic historicism. If Pater's  assertion of the absolute historicity of each phase of myth-its differ­ ence from others, its grounding in the peculiarities of a specific cul­ ture-were to be carried through, the resulting emphasis would be on  temporal and geographical change. But this is not the case. In the  Greek Studies, by far the greater emphasis is placed on stability,  continuity, and repetition.  The volume emphasizes the similarities between mythic and mod­ em consciousness. Pater approaches Greek mythology through the  lens of his own present culture, asking, "What is there in this phase  of ancient religion for us, at the present day? " (GS, 1 5  1 ). This approach,  on the general cultural level, is analogous to the individual approach  announced in the "Preface" to The Renaissance: "What is this song  or picture . . . t o me? "  But that search for continuity and similarity  crucially begins in a profound recognition of difference. Pater's ap­ preciation of the distance between past and present leads to an attempt  to bridge that distance with analogy. This quintessentially Paterian  strategy at once tacitly acknowledges the difficulty of penetrating  historical otherness and at the same time assumes that "the composite  experience of all the ages is a part of each one of us, " that awareness  "at the present day" can adequately reach across the abyss of historical  difference. And this binocular strategy, asserting difference while  bringing it into analogy with the familiar, will as usual tend both to  modernize the past and to traditionalize the present.  Pater's "modem mind" has admitted mythic conceptions as "recog­ nised and habitual inhabitants" :  " there are traces of the old temper  in the man of today, " he asserts (GS, rno ) .  The "phases of Greek  culture" are "not without their likenesses in the modem mind" (GS,  8 1 ) . For Pater, nineteenth-century English romanticism is a modem,  </page> <page sequence="17"> The Philosophy of Mythic Form • 25  l •  self-conscious version of an ancient mythic consciousness. In the  essay on Demeter he sees the romanticism of Wordsworth and Shelley  as a modem revival of the animistic sense in which nature and "per­ sonal intelligence" inform and express one another. At the same time,  conversely, he is eager to discover the romanticism in Greek myth.  As in The Renaissance, he is at pains to throw into high relief the  "worship of sorrow" (as Goethe called it) within classical Greek cul­ ture and religion (GS, 1 10 ) .  This move toward analogy accomplishes  more than a reinterpretation of classical Greece, though that in itself  remains a formidable mark of Pater's originality in these essays. '  To  discover the "worship of sorrow" within classical culture also implies  its analogy with Christianity, and that further analogy in tum implies  that both mythic and Christian culture prefigure their secularized,  modem form in the romanticism of the nineteenth century. As in  Marius, Christianity is secularized from both sides when it is seen as  the middle term of this three-stage development.  Pater-like Sainte-Beuve, of whom he writes-delighted in  tracing traditions in [literature], and the way in which various phases of  thought and sentiment maintain themselves, through successive modi­ fications, from epoch to epoch. (A, 244)  Pater calls this practice the "philosophy of literature. "  His strong em­ phasis on continuity in a myth's history is displayed so frequently that  he often seems more interested in how "phases of thought and senti­ ment maintain themselves" than in their "successive modifications . "   Distinctions between "phases" as usual depend on the initial assump­ tion of a continuous field, or of an overarching whole; all analogies in  the "comparative science of religions" or the "theory of 'comparative  mythology' " are made against this background (GS, I I , 1 1 2 ) .   As  long as  Pater concentrates on Greek myth, he  can base his  assumption of continuity on the common language of the versions.  Character names accompanied by epithets indicate fundamental unity  behind or beneath apparent diversity. Demeter Courotrophos, De­ meter Erinnys, Demeter Thesmophoros-all are " aspects" of the same  mythic "person, " gathered together and federated by  the name, the instrument of the identification, of the given matter,-of  its unity in variety, its outline or definition in mystery, its spiritual form.  (GS, 3 7 )   1 .  Pater "ranks among the true discoverers of Greek Romanticism" (Iser, Walter  Pater, p. 1 14) .   </page> <page sequence="18"> • 2 s 2 • Greek Studies and Plato and Platonism  This argument should remind us of Pater's use of the "type" in The  Renaissance, as well as of his understanding of the unifying function  of mythic characterization here in the Greek Studies. The name is a  "centripetal" force, and Pater is clearly sensitive to the aesthetic  dimension of this nominalism, in which the name brings about the  impression of unity among otherwise disparate features.  Epithets can  also indicate specific "phases" in the historical unfolding of a manifold  conception.  Pater has explored this idea before in his mythic reading of the Mona  Lisa, to whom he gave, as if they were her epithets, the aspects of both  classical and Christian figures :  as Leda, [she] was the mother of Helen of Troy, and, as Saint Anne, the  Mother of Mary. (R, 1 2 5 )  Pater's method of interpretation in the Greek Studies sheds a retro­ spective light on his treatment of the Mona Lisa, still his most famous  re-creation of mythic character. She represents the "spiritual form"  of history grown conscious of itself, the disparate forms unfolding in  time here gathered under the auspices of one person, one character,  one name. So too the stability of character in the conceptions of  Demeter, Persephone, Dionysus, and Apollo is represented by their  names, and a residual recognition of the differences and contradictions  that have been provisionally or nominally unified is represented by  their various epithets .   As long as Pater concentrates on Greek mythology, he can base his  assumption of continuity on the name, but when Pater's analogies are  no longer underwritten by a common language and cultural tradition,  they become at once more striking and at the same time more far­ fetched. In an essay strictly on Greek subjects, Pater's analogies seem  at first designed to illustrate the unavailable past by means of the  present, to familiarize his readers with ancient conceptions that might  otherwise remain occult, foreign, and inaccessibly different. But that  rationale begins to strain when the analogies attempt to bridge great  gulfs of historical difference. The relation between Dionysus Eleu­ therios and Dionysus Zagreus is asserted in the name, but how can  the same "person" be the mother of Helen of Troy and the mother of  Mary?  Pater's strategy of familiarization may be seen to operate with  striking effect in the violence with which different traditions are  yoked:  </page> <page sequence="19"> The Philosophy of Mythic Form · 2 5 3   The libations, at once a watering of the vines and a drink-offering to  the dead- . . .  must, to almost all minds, have had a certain natural  impressiveness; and a parallel has sometimes been drawn between this  festival and All Souls Day. (GS, 1 2 3 )   Or, for example, while Pater i s  considering the Eleusinian mysteries,  arguing that ritual enactment formed the dramatic basis of literary  myth, he reminds us of the Christian "mysteries" of the Middle Ages.  Both Greek and Christian "mysteries" present  an artistic spectacle, . . . a  dramatic representation of the sacred story . . .   and what we really do see . . . a re things which have their parallels in a  later age, the whole being not altogether unlike a modem pilgrimage.  The exposition of the sacred places . . .  is not so strange, as it would  seem, had it no modem illustration. (GS, 1 22-2 3 )   Pater's "modem illustrations" are taken from the realm where reli­ gious and aesthetic value interpenetrate. When he calls the first histor­ ical period of Greek art "the age of graven images, " his unmistakable  biblical allusion recalls the language of prohibition from the Exodus  narrative (GS, 224) .  He ends his essay "The Bacchanals of Euripides"  by alluding to the medieval Christian transformations of Euripides in  the Christus Patiens of Gregory Nazianzen, and he calls the workman  of the marbles of Aegina "the Chaucer of Greek sculpture" (GS, 80 268 ) .  1  The cross-cultural analogy represents Pater's most powerful histori­ cizing trope. Like all such tropes, it works always to relativize both  terms of the analogy, each becoming the background for the other;  the secularization-effects of the analogy extend both backward and  forward in time. On the one hand, they work to familiarize the past,  the culturally different, the inaccessible; on the other hand, they  defamiliarize the present, the modem, the habitual. Their particular  effect is most interesting and problematic when Greek myth and  Christian story are brought into analogy with one another. Greek  myth and ritual are vaguely Christianized, with a resultant reduction  of the difference, the otherness, of Greek myth. By the same token,  the Christian story is mythologized or anthropologized. Christianity  is seen as a later development of something already there and an early  development of something yet to be.  This strategy breaks down the notion of origins, for as Pater traces  back into the obscurity of the prehistoric, there is always something  prior to the earliest known recorded form. Even the Olympian gods  </page> <page sequence="20"> • 2 5 4  · Greek Studies and Plato and Platonism  were "conscious also of the fall of earlier divine dynasties . . . ,  the  weary shadows of an earlier, more formless, divine world" (R, 224) .   And this strategy also works to generate abstract, "ethical, " recurrent  analogous forms seen from the point of view of retrospective reflec­ tion. Within the logic of these historicizing tropes, both Greek myth  and Christian story become merely phases of something else that  transcends them both: the identity, the continuity of Western culture,  retrospectively contructed.  Let us look at some examples from the Greek Studies of these  "ethical" types in the process of formation. Pater explains the concep­ tion of Demeter by comparing her to the Egyptian Isis, the German  Hertha, and the later Greek conception of Pan (GS, 97 ) .  But his most  radical effort to familiarize us with Demeter ends by relativizing his  own culture's chief myth as well, for he sees Demeter in her "ethical"  phase not only "humanised" as a mourning mother but also as mater  dolorosa, Our Lady of Sorrows (GS, 1 14 ) .  In "Winckelmann" Pater  had claimed that "there is no Greek Madonna; the goddesses are  always childless" (R, 2 1 7 ) . But in the Greek Studies these historical  analogies work both ways, paganizing the Christian at the same time  that they Christianize the pagan. As Demeter becomes Our Lady of  Sorrows, the Virgin Mary implicitly begins to seem more like a fertility  goddess.2  Finally, interpreted as both, she can be neither. What is left of the  history of her transformations is Pater's distillation of an abstract,  "ethical" type that federates her periodic manifestations under the  auspices of an aesthetically constructed unity. From Pater's long view,  Demeter the wanderer may be seen alike in the Greek myth, Michel­ angelo's mater dolorosa, and the peasant women of Corot or Words­ worth. Her conception becomes so extensive that Pater's "Demeter"  finally names a transhistorical ethos, the "sentiment of maternity. " _  Pater likewise finds the types of Dionysus everywhere in art and  history. As a romantic lover, Dionysus is represented with Ariadne  by Titian and Tintoretto; as patron of reed instruments, he phases  into Marsyas, the satyrs, and Pan; as "inherent cause of music and  poetry" he is assimilable to Apollo (GS, 2 3 ,  I ?-l 8 ) .  3 But Pater describes  2. On the significance of the Magna Mater in Pater's works, see Gerald Monsman,  Pater's Portraits !Baltimore, Md. : Johns Hopkins University Press, 1 967 ), pp. 1 8-20,  27-29, I06-7, 1 37-38, 1 6 6-7 1 .   3 .  The dialectical relation of Dionysus to Apollo especially highlights the point  where separate mythic persons are exfoliated expressions or aspects of a mythic mani­ fold. These transhistorical myths of history seem to be a period phenomenon-see, e.g.,  Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy. On the relation between Pater and Nietzsche, see Patrick  Bridgewater, Nietzsche in Anglosaxony !Leicester: Leicester University Press, 1972 ),  pp. 2 1-36 .   </page> <page sequence="21"> The Philosophy of Mythic Form • 2 5 5  •  him as the young, suffering god in terms that tacitly though patently  allude to Christ's passion and resurrection:  A type of second birth, from first to last, he opens, in his series of annual  changes, for minds on the look-out for it, the hope of a possible analogy,  between the resurrection of nature, and something else, as yet unrealised,  reserved for human souls; and the beautiful, weeping creature, vexed by  the wind, suffering, torn to pieces, and rejuvenescent again at last, like  a tender shoot of living green out of the hardness and stony darkness of  the earth, becomes an emblem or ideal of chastening and purification,  and of final victory through suffering. (GS, 49-50 )   This describes a "worship of sorrow" indeed, and the masochistic  sexuality of the passage recalls a recurrent strain in Pater's own roman­ ticism. 4 "Minds on the look-out" for the "hope" of this analogy must  be retrospective and historicist, and Pater's coy tentativeness only  emphasizes the potential force of this "something else, as yet unreal­ ised, reserved for the human soul. " But if the conception of Dionysus  eventually comes to incorporate seasonal change, the seeds of cultural  renaissance, the resurrection of Christ, enthusiasm and ecstasy in  general, and the rebirth of the individual soul-where, then, is "Dio­ nysus" ?   Dionysus as a "person" disappears in the kaleidoscopic array of his  "aspects . "  And as the culturally specific mythic character disappears  into an infinite number of "possible" analogical relations, the spiritual  value of the conception correspondingly grows. As Pater points out,  "the human form is a limiting influence" (GS, 34 ) .  But Pater's form  of interpretation undoes that limitation. He concentrates (perforce)  on the period of time after the personal, mythic character has coalesced  as a unity, when reflection paradoxically seems to reverse the concen­ tration of physical form. The same struggle he recognizes in the history  of Greek art is also apparent in his own work:  there is a struggle, a Streben, as the Germans say, between the palpable  and limited human form, and the floating essence it is to contain. (GS,  34 )   This spiritualizing tendency is intimately tied, in Pater's scheme of  mythic development, to the passage of time and the distance of retro­ spection. His own long view stresses the "ethical" phase of myth, "in  4.

But Pater's is not only  a particularly late development of the ethical phase; it has also been  located in a cross-cultural register. That crucial focus causes Pater's  scheme of the three phases of myth to be transposed or transfigured.  The schematic development Pater offers for Greek myth-oral, liter­ ary, and ethical phases-is transposed in the larger conceptual scheme  of his own cross-cultural perspective to the Greek, the Christian, and  the modern, synthetic, and secularized phases.  The deeper Pater goes beneath the surface of historical change (or  the "higher" above it), the more equivalencies he finds, until all phe­ nomenal manifestations seem to be only "aspects" of the same perma­ nent material, shaped anew from time to time. He uses, for example,  the history of a symbol to illustrate the flexibility with which it can  be adopted to almost any use. The pomegranate,  because of the multitude of its seeds, was to the Romans a symbol of  fecundity, and was sold at the doors of the temple of Ceres, that the  women might offer it there, and bear numerous children; and so, to the  middle age, became a symbol of the fruitful earth itself; and then of that  other seed sown in the dark under-world; and at last of that whole hidden  region, so thickly sown, which Dante visited, Michelino painting him,  in the Duomo of Florence, with this fruit in his hand, and Botticelli  putting it into the childish hands of Him, who, if men "go down into  hell, is there also ."  (GS, 1 50-5 1 )   Finally there are pomegranates everywhere, their dizzying profusion  testifying to nothing so much as the fluidity of signification. In a chain  of symbolic appropriation over time, Pater's pomegranate represents  fertility as well as the barrenness of the underworld, sexual generation  as well as the fertility of the earth in general, the mythic underworld  as well as Dante's literary inferno, and finally the Renaissance associa­ tion of the infernal fruit with Christ himself, the penetration of the  mythic underworld by Christian poet and its appropriation by Chris­ tian painter. Needless to say, the story of Persephone, eating six seeds  in the despair of Hades, is quite lost.  Similarly, Pater finds the myth of Persephone everywhere :  Her story is, indeed, but the story, in an intenser form, of Adonis, of  Hyacinth, of Adrastus-the King's blooming son, fated in the story of  Herodotus, to be wounded to death with an iron spear-of Linus, a fair  </page> <page sequence="23"> The Philosophy of Mythic Form · 2 5 7   child who is tom to pieces by hounds every spring-time-of the English  Sleeping Beauty. (GS, rn9 )   Here we see the extreme form of literary comparativism at work, with  all its gains and attendant losses. All stories for a moment seem to be  the story of Persephone, in one "phase" of its development or another. 5  In Orphic poetry she is associated with Dionysus Zagreus (GS, 44, 5 I ),  so that even the largest most comprehensive and "separate" mythic  forms seem finally only shape-shifting "aspects" of one another.  This phenomenon is at the foundation of mythic conception itself,  since myth attempts to represent the whole of human experience, in  all of its aspects .  Neither the characters nor the stories will stay  separate; they ramify into one another with more complexity and  confusion the closer one looks . The dialectical duality of Persephone's  character testifies to its mythic, unifying power; the fact that Perse­ phone and Dionysus can "mean" the most opposite things-can even  blend into and "mean" each other-is exactly their point. My crucial  point is that Pater conceives his histories of myth in precisely the  same way. His cross-cultural analogies finally reveal so many connec­ tions and overlappings that every version of every story seems to be  part of a vast totality, a deep and stable structure that reiteratively  expresses itself throughout history.  Pater considers this problem himself in the Greek Studies. He re­ calls that Plato objects in The Republic to all episodes of mythology  that represent doubling, disguise, or metamorphosis, because those  episodes violate the stability of form and teach a dangerous "Heracli­ tean philosophy of perpetual change. /1 But Pater defends those episodes  of doubling and transformation against Plato's charges; for Pater, char­ acteristically, they signify spiritual "presence" :   Stories in which, the hard material outline breaking up, the gods lay  aside their visible form like a garment, yet remain essentially them­ selves, -[are] not the least spiritual element of Greek religion, an evi­ dence of the sense therein of unseen presences, which might . . . be  recognised . . . b y the more delicately trained eye . . . . W hatever religious  elements they lacked, they had at least this sense of subtler and more  remote ways of personal presence. (GS, 1 1 9-20)  He attributes to these stories a "quite biblical mysticity and solem­ nity, /1 bringing mythic metamorphosis into a familiarizing analogy  5 .  A similarly extreme, "mythic" literary-historical method is practiced by Frye  with some of the same results. See esp.

It is clear that his own historical  analogies highlight episodes of just such doubling and transformation  in time. As it grows less "personal" and more "remote, " religious  "presence" is more clearly aestheticized; the dizzying play of seculari­ zation-effects generates aesthetic value where a more directly accessi­ ble "presence" was once thought to have been. In the "ethical" or  abstract phase of myth, Pater attends more to repetition than to differ­ ence, more to the characteristic element than to the character. As  myth is historicized, and thus released from its culturally specific  religious function, its aesthetic value appreciates proportionately, fed  by the energy of these transformations.  From one point of view, to secularize is to "demythologize, " to  empty a cultural form of its religious content and to refill it with  aesthetic value. But in Pater's case, to secularize is also to "remytholo­ gize, " to posit a mythic unity and structure of repetition in history  that transcends its different periods or "aspects .

In Plato and Platonism he is more  explicit than ever before about many issues that will seem familiar to  us by now.  For example, Pater opens by grappling with the adjustment of the  organic model of development to the aesthetic model : "With the world  l .  A useful compendium of sources on Pater as a lecturer may be found in Wright,  Bibliography of Pater, pp. 1 79-8 3 .   2 .  Pater began lecturing on "the history of philosophy" a s  early a s  1 867 ( ibid., p.  1 82 ) .  He probably read Grote's History of Greece in 1 86 1 ,  Zeller's Philosophie der  Greichen in 1 863 ,  and K. 0. Muller's Die Dorier in the 1 870s (Billie Andrew Inman,  Walter Pater's Reading: A Bibliography of His Library Borrowings and Literary Refer·  ences [New York: Garland, 1 9 8 1 ), pp. 2 5 ,  64-6 5 ,  98 ) .

Following out the implications of  that opening analogy, he asserts in no uncertain terms that political  institutions, laws, arts, and language, "all the products of mind, the  very mind itself . . . a re 'not made, ' cannot be made, but 'grow"' (PP,  20-21 ). Therefore traces of previous forms of life will be visible in  later forms, as if preserved in geological or archaeological strata. Bits  of older philosophies reside within Plato's formulations as "minute  relics of earlier organic life in the very stone he builds with" (PP, 7 ) .   And yet within this very statement i s  a tacit acknowledgment of  the aesthetic, shaping act implicit in historical conception, for Plato  "builds" with the "stone" that has been formed from the residue of  previously organic life. His work marks the transition from oral to  literary culture, prehistoric to historical culture, organic to aesthetic  culture.  Pater makes it clear that Plato has always "seemed" to be the  "creator of philosophy" only because of his consummate literary form.  Close to Pater's claim that "nature makes no sudden starts" is his  explicit acknowledgment that to "fix" on this beginning is his own  aesthetic choice. Indeed, Pater begins by stressing the " organic" begin­ nings before this "aesthetic" beginning, the prehistoric oral culture  that survives only in fragments, the "unconscious poetry" that pre­ cedes philosophy (PP, 5-7 ) .  One of the tenets of Pater's particular  version of organicism holds that the basic genetic material is present  from the first; the "seeds" of all science were "dimly enfolded" in the  mind of antiquity, to be "fecundated . . . i n after ages" (PP, 1 8 ) .  He  proceeds to argue that no matter is new under the sun. But the other  side of Pater's synthetic view emphasizes the difference of forms  rather than the sameness of matter :  It is hardly an exaggeration to say that in Plato . . . there is nothing  absolutely new: or rather . . . t he seemingly new is old also, a palimpsest,  a tapestry of which the actual threads have served before, or like the  animal frame itself, every particle of which has already lived and died  many times over. Nothing but the life-giving principle of cohesion is  new . . . . In  other words, the form is new. But then, in the creation of  philosophical literature, as in all other products of art, form, in the full  signification of that word, is everything, and the mere matter is nothing.  (PP, 8 )   The juxtaposition of figures in this passage expresses Pater's attraction  to both organic and aesthetic models in this ongoing argument, with  </page> <page sequence="26"> • 260 • Greek Studies and Plato and Platonism  images of revisionary writing and weaving followed by an image of  the generic "animal frame. "  The very principle Pater here asserts must  be reflexively applied to his own text, for all these figures are familiar  Paterian material : the metaphor of the palimpsest has figured promi­ nently in Marius; the recycled "threads" are familiar from the opening  paragraphs of the "Conclusion" and the essay on Coleridge; and the  example of the animal frame resonates with the description of the  physical basis of life in the "Conclusion" as well as with Pater's many  mythical portraits of "spiritual form"-the Mona Lisa, Dionysus, now  Plato himself.  In fact, what we find here, as in the Greek Studies, is Pater's repre­ sentation of the pivotal and mythic moment when organic, uncon­ scious life first develops consciousness, when history and literature  emerge within and against the primeval manifold. Pater focuses this  moment in the history of philosophy by explicitly relying on Hegel's  definition of tragedy, which takes the life and death of Socrates as  its case in point. Genuine tragedy, Hegel argues, cannot be "merely  personal. "  Instead, it occurs when two "opposed Rights come forth"  and "the one breaks itself to pieces against the other. " In the case of  Socrates, Hegel defines these two opposed Rights as, on the one hand,  "the religious claim, the unconscious moral habit, " and, on the other  hand, "the equally religious claim, the claim of consciousness. " This  conflict engenders the moment when the claim of consciousness  emerges as "the common principle of philosophy for all time to come"  (PP, 9 1-92 ) .  In Hegel's example, the historic shift into conscious­ ness-indeed, the shift into history itself-is represented by Socrates  and the concretely dialectical response to his life and teachings : the  death penalty, which, instead of obliterating them, immortalized the  claims of consciousness. Pater refigures this Hegelian example to  make Plato the representative of literary self-consciousness retrospec­ tively acknowledging its Socratic, preliterary, "organic" roots .  Pater's treatment of his own "historic method" is much more ex­ plicitly linked in Plato and Platonism to the contemporary influence  both of Hegel and of Darwin than ever before (PP, 8-9, 1 9 ) .  Pater  implicitly makes a distinction between two aspects of the method,  which we would call the synchronic and the diachronic, but both  these aspects of his method have been influenced by Hegel and by  Darwin. On the one hand, Pater pursues the uniquely adjusted syn­ chronic "fit" between an organism and its environment, attempting  to "replace" the doctrine of Plato within the "conditions" of its pro­ duction. This argument has affinities with Pater's understanding of  </page> <page sequence="27"> The History of Philosophy · 26 1  •  natural selection as well as with his belief in the personal character  of the " 'Time-Spirit' or Zeit-geist" :   That ages have their genius a s  well a s  the individual; that in  every age  there is a peculiar ensemble of conditions which determines a common  character in every product of that age . . . ; that nothing man has projected  from himself is really intelligible except at its own date, and from its  proper point of view in the never-resting "secular process" ;  . . . b y force  of these convictions many a normal, or at first sight abnormal, phase of  speculation has found a reasonable meaning for us . (PP, 9-ro )   The weirdly twisted pine tree that is  unintelligible on an English lawn  becomes intelligible when we imagine the Alpine forces that have  "determined" its shape; so too "fantastic doctrines" like Plato's  " 'communism' " must be seen amid the conditions that produced  them. This synchronic aspect of Pater's historic method might be  called "anthropological" in a particularly prestructuralist mode, and  in Plato and Platonism he frequently reaches toward racial and geo­ graphical arguments as ways to make this approach more concrete.  Often Pater places the word "environment" in quotation marks, as if  to call attention to the neologism of the hour (e .g., PP, ro ) .  He is  sharply aware of the contemporary vogue for this line of argument,  naming it as one of the most popular questions of his own day (PP,  1 5 4) .   In  Plato and Platonism, Pater seems to  have theorized the dialecti­ cal relation between the synchronic and diachronic aspects of his  "historic method, " treating them both as parts of the "centripetal"  tendency, the unifying force that spatially links organism to environ­ ment and temporally links "one period of organic growth to another"  (PP, ro5 ) .  (Pater tellingly describes this "centripetal" force as the  organic become conscious of itself. ) The relation between synchronic  and diachronic is expressed in the form of the volume, which in its  largest sense is an attempt to describe the history of philosophy using  Plato as the figure of originary wholeness. Antecedent forms of  thought that give rise to Plato's philosophy are treated as the syn­ chronic "environment" within which he writes. Not until chapter 6  does Pater tum to the argument that we must judge Plato by his  followers as well as by his antecedents . Thus the form of the volume  is itself an essay in the "historic method" :  five chapters "placing"  Plato within the "conditions" of his own time and place, then five  </page> <page sequence="28"> · 262 • Greek Studies and Plato and Platonism  chapters exfoliating Plato's "genius, " his doctrines, and their influ­ ence in later ages.  The form of Pater's diachronic argument displays the full finesse of  his dialectic ( though the diachronic dimension is finally subsumed by  the synchronic, as we shall see ) .  Pater first sketches a three-stage  dialectical process leading up to Plato, in which the philosophies of  Heraclitus, Parmenides, and Pythagoras represent thesis, antithesis,  and synthesis-the principles of "motion, " "rest, " and "number. "  The Heraclitean flux and the Parmenidean One are evaluated antithet­ ically, from two sides, both for what each doctrine has contributed to  Platonism and for what has been most stringently argued against  each one. Heraclitus rightly appreciates the radical uniqueness of  phenomenal forms, but his "centrifugal" doctrine leads to chaos. On  the other hand, Parmenides creates a conception of unity, but at the  expense of color and form; his idea of the One seems to many people  to be "but zero, and a mere algebraic symbol for nothingness" (PP,  40) .  In an intensely witty formulation, Pater explains that the reaction  against Heraclitus' philosophy of motion was a "fixed idea" with Plato  (PP, 12 ) .  Likewise, Plato reacted against the Parmenidean "infectious  mania . . . f or nonentity" with a more mobile "axiomata media" (PP,  40, 42 ) .   Pater's interpretation of  the Pre-Socratics calls attention to  the dia­ lectical reversal that engenders the doctrine of rest directly out of the  doctrine of motion: Zeno, favorite disciple of Parmenides, was an  adept in "dialectic art, " and Zeno's paradox demonstrates that "per­ petual motion is perpetual rest" (PP, 28-30) .  The Pythagorean theory,  however, achieves a reconciliation of motion and rest without con­ flating the two principles as a paradoxical identity. The theory of  number and music formulates cosmos as "unity in variety, " structure  in motion (PP, 5 2 ) . For Pater, the essence of the Pythagorean doctrine  lies not in the infinite but in the finite, and he defines "art as being  itself the finite, ever controlling the infinite, the formless" (PP, 60) .   This emphasis is characteristically Paterian. Though this dialectic of  motion, rest, and number is once again the familiar tripartite scheme  of romantic history, "music" ( the chosen end term of Pater's dialectic)  privileges a "higher multiplicity" rather than a "higher unity, " motion  directed toward rest rather than rest itself, dialectic rather than para­ doxical identity or harsh dualism.  Indeed, one dimension of Pater's argument in Plato and Platonism  treats each of the historically concrete figures (Heraclitus, Parmen­ ides, Pythagoras, Socrates, the Sophists, and Plato ) as representatives  of permanent "tendencies" or recurring types in "the human mind  </page> <page sequence="29"> The History of Philosophy • 263  •  itself. " Pater argues, for example, that the Heraclitean doctrine of  perpetual flux has only been fully realized in his own age :  It is the burden of Hegel on the one hand, to whom nature, and art, and  polity, and philosophy, aye, and religion too, each in its long historic  series, · are but so many conscious movements in the secular process of  the eternal mind; and on the other hand of Darwin and Darwinism, for  which "type" itself properly is not but is only always becoming. (PP, 1 9 )   In  this view, the theory of development itself has developed from an  ancient seed, "fecundated . . .  in later ages. "  Similarly, Pater finds  Greek, Indian, and Christian expressions of the Parmenidean One (PP,  40-41 ), and he asserts that Pythagoreanism represents a permanent  instinct "of the human mind itself, " which is therefore expressed as  a periodically recurring emphasis, a tradition in human history. This  amounts to asserting the periodic recurrence of a theory of recurrence,  since the Pythagoreans contributed the doctrine of spiritual preexis­ tence to the Platonic synthesis .  Pater closes the chapter on Pythagoras  with a quotation from Vaughan's "The Retreat" and the invocation  of Wordsworth's Intimations Ode, thus bringing the philosophy of  preexistence, recurrence, or "re-action" up to date (PP, 7 3-74) .  Else­ where in the volume, Pater names various historically recurrent forms  of "animism" ranging from the Homeric conception of an anthropo­ morphic pantheon, to Plato's theory of ideas, to the "survival" 3  of this  spiritual condition in the primitive negro, to the culture of Words­ worth, Shelley, Goethe, and Schelling (PP, 1 68-69 ) .  In each of these  cases, historical difference is practically effaced in the service of famil­ iarizing analogies. 4  So we see that the extremely broad-brush cross-cultural analogies  that Pater drew throughout the Greek Studies operate in Plato and  Platonism as well, on the largest level of its argument. In Plato and  Platonism less emphasis is placed on the specific relation of Greek to  3 .  In nineteenth-century anthropology the word "survival" carried overtones of  Tylor, Hegel, and possibly Vico.

This "side" of  Pater's historicism has always been present, and it has always tended  toward a myth of recurrence which transcends the diverse, ephemeral  surface of things in the search for a deeper (or "higher" )  structure of  permanent form. But this dimension of historicism has never before  been so explicitly formulated as the framework of a volume's general  argument. Pater might say that the form of Plato and Platonism truly  expresses its matter, for in his discussion of Plato's theory of Ideas,  Pater discusses the formation of these general Forms. Nowhere else  in his works do we find such a crisp and summary statement of Pater's  understanding of the problematic relation between representative  terms and particular instances.  Chapters 3 through 5 construct a second level of dialectical argu­ ment. Chapter 5 concentrates on the Sophists, the contemporary back­ ground against which Pater defines himself, while chapters 3 and 4  focus on Pythagoras and Socrates, precursor figures of synthesis who  are each identified with Plato. In other words, after Pater has sketched  the three-stage dynamic of Pre-Socratic development, he turns to focus  on two figures, each of whom mirrors and prefigures Plato's own dual  nature. Both these prefigurative relations mediate the emergence of  Plato from the obscurity of the preliterary, the development of self­ consciousness from within an "organic" ground. This function is  especially clear in Pater's treatment of Socrates, whose relation to  Plato he takes as the model of "educated common-sense" transformed  into a higher, "mystic intellectualism" (PP, 8 5 ) . The Platonic dialogue  is "the literary transformation . . . o f what was the intimately home­ grown method of Socrates"  (PP, 1 7 7 ) .  Though we have no writings of  Socrates, we have in Plato's literary recreation the memory not only  of a vivid historical character but also of the prehistoric roots of  literature itself.  But Pater's ability to cast Pythagoras as a mythic figure of synthesis  is also due in part to the fact that his writings have not survived except  in fragments; "nothing remains of his writings: dark statements only  . . . i n later authors" (PP, 5 2 ) .  In other words, the Pythagorean theory  has the status of primitive, mythic unity, and Pythagoras' life is also  susceptible to such a mythic interpretation, because many stories  have been passed down of his descent from Apollo and his legendary  reincarnation as "various persons in the course of ages" (PP, 5 3-54 ) .   As usual, Pater bolsters this mythic interpretation with historical  evidence, giving it a slightly allegorial twist. Pythagoras was a native  of Ionia who later settled in a Dorian city, and Pater makes that  </page> <page sequence="31"> The History of Philosophy • 26  5 •  geographical movement and habitation symbolic of Pythagoras' phi­ losophy, its self-conscious choice of a "musical discipline" over the  fluidity of the phenomenal world. For Pater, Pythagoras embodies the  dominance of centripetal forces over centrifugal forces, which he will  find so saliently at work in Plato (PP, 5 6 ) .   The relation between Plato and Pythagoras is  abstract. Plato, like  Pythagoras, consummates the development of the Pre-Socratics. By  identifying him with Pythagoras, Pater suggests that Plato assimilates  the synthetic, "musical law" of unity in variety. But Plato's relation  with Socrates, on the other hand, is historically concrete. Like Pythag­ oras, Socrates was a "two-sided being" (according to Alcibiades in the  Symposium), and Pater plays with this traditional notion in several  ways (PP, 76 ) .  The ungraceful appearance of Socrates (again as attested  by Alcibiades) suggests to Pater the Platonic distinction between phe­ nomenal appearance and a higher reality, as if the source of Plato's  theory of ideas might have been his puzzlement at the rude physiog­ nomy of his master. This personal connection with Socrates is at the  heart of Pater's interpretation of Plato. In a characteristic transition  he passes, after a typographical break, from considering Socrates' vi­ sion of an afterlife to imagining its effect on Plato : "Plato was then  about twenty-eight years old" !PP, 97 ) .  Pater loves to imagine these  moments of timely conjunction, when two historical figures may be  conceived in personal relation; his fables of historical transmission  tum on such pivot-points, which seem to enfold the past and the future  in a blaze of imagined presence. s These moments are themselves  two-sided figures, for they join two historically separate persons in a  momentary unity, from which will issue the divided forms of the  future.  In Pater's historical dialectic, a " two-sided" figure signifies the mo­ mentary synthesis of past influences and the generative force toward  further development. Thus Pater also interprets Socrates' synthetic  nature in terms of its historical generativity. In his own time, Socrates  gave rise to antithetical classes of enemies-both the Sophists and  the anti-Sophists opposed him-and in later days his constitutional  "twofold power" gave rise to "an influence . . . o f which there emerged  on the one hand the Cynic, on the other the Cyrenaic School" (PP,  7 5 1 87,  89 ) .  Plato of course is also a two-sided figure, joining in his philosophy the greatest possible demand for certainty in knowledge  5 .  The relation between Pico and Ficino, for example, which is historically docu­ mented (though not as Pater reports) ;  or the imaginary relation he constructs between  Goethe and Winckelmann; or the momentary image of Raphael, at age nineteen, watch­ ing Leonardo and Michelangelo work (R, 36-37, 1 96-97, 127 ) .   </page> <page sequence="32"> • 266 • Greek Studies and Plato and Platonism  with the utmost possible uncertainty in his method of inquiry (PP,  r 88 ) .  This paradoxical union is the generative seed of two very differ­ ent traditions in the history of philosophy, both of which Pater attri­ butes to the influence of Plato : an ontological tradition, which devel­ ops from his demand for absolute knowledge, and a skeptical tradition,  which develops from his dialectical method (PP, 1 92-96 ) .  In Pater's  history of philosophy, then, Plato figures as mythic unity, expressed  in literary form. He represents a moment of wholeness that will be  split afterward into "divergent streams, " a synthesis of everything  that came before it, which generates everything that came after. Pa­ ter's Plato enfolds within him the entire history of philosophy.6  5 · The Anecdote of the Shell  The nature of the relation between general terms and particular  objects of experience, says Pater, is "one of the constant problems of  logic, " and what Plato's commentators have called his "theory of  ideas" is not so much a theory as a way of regarding this relation (PP,  r 5 0-5 r ). Pater presents his readers with the three "fixed and formal"  answers to this problem-realism, nominalism, and conceptualism.  Then, instead of explaining Plato's theory of ideas, he gives the "mod­ em view" of the "nature of logical 'universals' " (PP, r 5 r-5 2 ) .   Pater's modem view synthesizes elements of  all three "fixed" for­ mulations . He tacitly agrees with the realists that the general term is  res, a real thing. He agrees with the conceptualists that general terms  are the product of subjective thought, but he interprets "subjective"  not on the individual level but on the level of general culture. This is  a crucial move, and it enables him to base his own "theory of ideas" on  a collective or "general consciousness, a permanent common sense. "   Finally, he  gives the nominalist his due by explaining that the individ­ ual is in touch with this collective consciousness through the medium  of language. The language provides general terms as outlines that  6. Harvard MS. 3, "History of Philosophy" :  "successive metaphysical systems have  been, in fact, little more than so many recombinations of the pieces which Plato had  so long ago placed, once, for all upon the board" (Inman, Pater's Reading, 42 ) .  Jenkyns  recalls Whitehead's remark that European philosophy could safely be characterized as  a series of footnotes to Plato and comments: "This is a remark which could only have  been made in the later nineteenth or earlier twentieth century" (Richard Jenkyns,  "Plato, " in The Victorians and Ancient Greece [Cambridge, Mass . :  Harvard University  Press, I 9 80], pp. 227-63 ) .   </page> <page sequence="33"> The Anecdote of the Shell · 267 •  the individual then fills up with meaning, "drop by drop, " through  personal experience in time. On the other hand, the language develops  these general terms over the course of historical time as a result of  particular experience. Whether a particular experience "survives" to  become a general term has everything to do with conscious repetition;  the formation of a type, in other words, is a testimony to its perceived  recurrence, the residual evidence of a tradition that has formed "in  the human mind itself. "  Let us look at one telling example. Pater argues that the quarrel  between Plato and the Sophists was in part quite characteristic of its  age, and in part it was "a mere rivalry of individuals . "  As such, he  goes on to say, the quarrel might have been remembered "only as a  matter of historical interest. " I would like to focus on that striking  word "only. " What sort of interest does Pater have in mind that would  surpass the merely historical ? He goes on to explain :  It has been otherwise. That innocent word "Sophist" has survived in  common language, to indicate some constantly recurring viciousness, in  the treatment of one's own and of other minds. (PP, 1 1 5 )   The sense of repetition generates a value that has its basis in, but  tends to transcend, the historical. A term's survival in the "common  language" is evidence for the general value of that term, and con­ versely, the process of survival involves repetition in contexts other  than the original, "only" historical, context. The transposition of a  term from one particular historical context to another actually gener­ ates representative value, which can then be used to "figure" further  particularity. In Pater's interpretation, then, the history of language  is another vehicle of his aesthetic historicism.  Pater analyzes this same process in the chapter on Plato's theory of  ideas, where he discusses the operation of general terms. Well aware  that the "type" might seem to violate the claims of each particular  instance, he begins by playing devil's advocate for the particular:  We cannot love or live upon genus and species, . . . b ut for our minds, as  for our bodies, need an orchard or a garden, with fruit and roses. Take a  seed from the garden. What interest it has for us all lies in our sense of  potential differentiation to come: the leaves, leaf upon leaf, the flowers, a  thousand new seeds in turn. It is so with animal seed; and with humanity,  individually, or as a whole, its expansion into a detailed, ever-changing,  parti-coloured history of particular facts and persons. Abstraction, the  introduction of general ideas, seems to close it up again; to reduce flower  </page> <page sequence="34"> • 268 • Greek Studies and Plato and Platonism  and fruit, odour and savour, back again into the dry and worthless seed.  We might as well be colour-blind at once . . .  ! (PP, 1 s s )  The value of particularity here is clearly associated with organic,  historical process, whereas "abstraction" obliterates the temporal di­ mension so necessary to produce difference. Pater then considers the  state of things from his own present-day perspective, when everything  seems to be classified and "reduced to common types. " Into the garden  of unfolding difference the philosopher-as-classifier has come.  To that gaudy tangle . . . t he systematic, logical gardener put his meddle­ some hand, and straightway all ran to seed; to genus and species and  differentia . . .  with-yes! with written labels fluttering on the stalks,  instead of blossoms. (PP, 1 5 6 )   The "seed" here has been wittily transvalued from its context in the  earlier passage. Instead of the organic potential for future growth and  differentiation, it now figures the messy and decaying end of a life  cycle. Blossoms have been replaced by labels, organic life by writing,  and unfolding differentiation by names, categories, differentia.  The  "logical gardener" tends to the generic names of things, not to the  unique particularity of living things themselves .  He has transformed  the profusion of natural process and has made of it a ruined garden.  Pater's secularizing wit here turns on the notion that too much naming  in the garden has resulted in a fallen language as well as the ruination  of the Edenic garden.  And according to the hypothetical case Pater is putting, all this is  the result of a "generalising movement" that effectively begins with  Socrates and Plato. The Homeric world before this "generalising move­ ment" began now seems to be a golden age, when "experience was intu­ ition, and life a continuous surprise, and every object unique, where  all knowledge was still of the concrete and the particular, face to face  delightfully" (PP, 1 5 6  J. In this figure the value of particularity is clearly  associated not with history but with a myth of immediacy. Pater has  taken Socrates and Plato as the dividing line between mythic immedi­ acy and historical mediation, the beginning of a process that has culmi­ nated in the modem "reduction" of everything to "common types. "  But Pater's argument then turns abruptly to defend the modem  profusion of general terms. The particular instance gains in value  through classification, he argues. What seems at first to be a reduction  of concrete experience turns out to be its enhancement. The general  term has a power to focus the intense particularity of a concrete form.  </page> <page sequence="35"> The Anecdote of the Shell · 269 •  To illustrate this epistemological process, Pater tells a little story,  which I call "The Anecdote of the Shell . " '  Unlike the trained natural­ ist, an ordinary person picking up a shell on the seashore will not  understand the value of classification, "the subsumption of the indi­ vidual into the species ."  That ordinary person with his seashell is like  a child with a toy. When the child goes to school, he must put away  his toys, and it seems for a very long while as if he studies everything  except the thing itself. He studies other shells, the perfect type of each  sort of shell, the general laws operating in the life of shells. But when  he comes out of school and again on the seashore finds another shell,  his "converse with the general" enables him really to see the shell in  all its vivid concreteness. Through his knowledge of its difference  from other objects, even its difference from its own perfect type, he  sees the shell 's particularity as if for the first time. Indeed, he has  learned "about it. " It has been enriched by juxtaposition with every­ thing around it, everything that is "not it, " and now "the whole  circumjacent world [is) concentrated upon, or . . . a t focus in, it. " We  should recognize here Pater's figure of concentric definition, which  features a point focused within a surrounding field. 2 A long experience  in time has engendered this ability to collapse time : to see "in a single  moment of vision, " to read "by a kind of short-hand, " the shell's  "legible" alliance with the entire world (PP, 1 5 7-5 8 ) . 3   Pater's "Anecdote of  the Shell" bears a marked relation to Plato's  own pedagogical allegories, but it is significant that Pater shifts his  emphasis from the individual's process of learning to the general  historical process, and in so doing also changes the figure :  You may draw, by the use of this coinage (it is Hobbes's figure) this  coinage of representative words and thoughts, at your pleasure, upon the  accumulative capital of the whole experience of humanity. (PP, 1 5 9 )  Here Pater throws the emphasis on the long course of general history  that has produced (or "coined" )  general terms for individuals to spend  in their own experiences of learning. The language is like a communal  fund: it provides general terms that individual experience draws upon,  I. After Wallace Stevens's "Anecdote of the Jar, " which considers the same problem  from the other direction, focusing on the power of a concrete form to organize the  "slovenly wilderness" around it.  2 .  See above, Part Two, sec. 5 .   3 .  See McGrath's treatment of this anecdote, which he correctly calls a "parable"  (F. C.

Pater holds fast to the "modern view" in this understanding of the  historical construction of general terms. For him, as for Darwin, "the  'type' itself is not but is only always becoming" (PP, 1 9 ) . And yet, at  any given time, it effectively is . As Pater explained in his description  of Diaphaneite, certain general types are recognized by "the world. "   Such a general category is treated as given, datum, its value produced  by the accumulated repetitions of past experience. Pater's is a limited,  historical idealism.  What is most important for us to see is that this treatment of general  ideas differs radically from Plato's. Pater elides the difficult notion­ which he, following Aristotle, duly mentions-that Plato makes his  Ideas "separable" from their phenomenal, shadowy instantiations (PP,  1 6 3 ) . Instead, Pater continues to focus on the Platonic figure of the  "ladder" by which we reach the Forms by means of their phenomenal  forms. According to Aristotle, Plato's great step beyond Socratic induc­ tion was in making the Ideas "separable" from their instances, but  according to Pater, Plato's advance over Socrates was instead to make  the Ideas real things and then to make them persons (PP, 1 6 6-67 ) .   Thus, even while preserving his "modern" emphasis on  the historical  construction of general ideas, Pater manages to invest them with a  mythic, Platonic value.  Pater follows Plato in claiming the "enthusiasm" for ideas as a true  form of possession (PP, 1 72 ) .  But his possession by the ideas, types, or  Forms differs significantly from Plato's. Like other "moderns, " Pater's  greatest affinity is for the other "side" of Plato's doctrine-not its  passion for the acquisition of '"eternal and immutable ideas, "' but  the practice or method of a tentative, hesitant, never-concluding aspi­ ration toward "ideals" (PP, 1 9 5 ) . This modern emphasis is all on the  side of becoming, of process, of "tendency. " Its philosophical practice  is called dialectic.  6 · Dialogue and Dialectic  On the one hand, Pater's interpretation of Platonic dialectic assumes  the priority of real dialogue, of an actual conversation between two or  more different interlocutors. On the other hand, that reality exists in  </page> <page sequence="37"> Dialogue and Dialectic · 2 7 l •  memory or aspiration-in life, but not in art-and Pater is unusually  sensitive to the fact that what we actually have before us is a  literary form, the written record or imaginary representation of an  experience, not the thing itself. For Pater, the memory of the  Socratic method, preserved in Plato's literary form, stands as one  more mythic representation of a lost archaic past when experience  was direct, informal, and took place "face to face. "  The informal,  oral conversations of Socrates figure in Pater as "the first rough,  natural growth, " the organic ground from which Plato's written,  formal Dialogues spring (PP, 79, 1 77 ) .  However, if the Dialogues  are but a representation of experience, figures of life and not life  itself, still they get closer to the reality of experience than Sophistic  argument, which Pater characterizes as "mechanical" by comparison  (PP, 100) .   For Pater, dialectic is the most lifelike form of philosophical  inquiry. Plato himself admits that " 'like ourselves, our  discourses . . . h ave much participation in the temerity of chance' "  (PP, 1 8 5 ) . In his discussion of Plato's method, Pater focuses on this  quality of accident or surprise, of new information or argumentative  force suddenly appearing from "without, " as if in conversational  exchange. For that reason the dialogue form appropriately "figures"  and lends its name to the dialectical method of argumentation  (PP, 1 8 3 ) . In dialogue, the philosophical advantages of subjective  relativism take literary form; points of view are represented as  separate persons, proper names marking their difference from one  another. Both dialogue and dialectic make difference, separation,  and distinction graphically visible as a part of their effective method.  The search for knowledge is seen as a function of communal  experience, and it is developmental in form. Knowledge unfolds  in time. A sequence of conversational exchanges represents the  necessarily tentative, skeptical approach to knowledge, the repeated  adjustments in response to new information, the never-concluding  aspiration toward a view more complete than anyone's "separate"  human perspective could ever achieve.  Dialectic represents the life of the mind as movement toward  that complete perspective. The movement is never-ending, because  complete knowledge can never be fully achieved in human time;  like "life itself, " the dialectical method admits further possible  movement until the end (PP, 1 8 5 ) . One of Pater's favorite figures  for the dialectical process compares it to the ascent of a mountain.  On the way up, one perspective succeeds another until finally, at  the mountaintop, the climber achieves "what Plato would call the  </page> <page sequence="38"> • 272 • Greek Studies and Plato and Platonism  'synoptic' view of the mountain as a whole" (PP, 1 80 ) .  But as Pater  notes, while in the process of climbing, when dealing with other  persons, there is room for error up until the very last moment.  "Another tum in the endless road may change the whole character  of the perspective" (PP, 1 90 ) .  A literary dialogue closes, and thus it  provides an equivalent of the synoptic view in its retrospective  " sense of an ending. " But the dialectical process never ends. For  those who pursue it thoroughly, it is "co-extensive with life itself"  (PP, 1 8 5 ) .  Portraying dialectic as "co-extensive with life itself" is quite a  different matter from saying that it is "like" life. On the one hand,  Pater assumes that an actual dialogue took place prior to Plato's  literary re-creation; his belief in the mythic priority of Socrates to  Plato, of oral culture to literary culture, leads Pater to make actual  dialogue between persons the model for dialectical method. Yet, on  the other hand, he assumes that "the dialogue of the mind with  itself" is the original activity, which both actual conversation and  literary dialogue simply express (PP, 1 8 3 ) .  To make "the dialogue  of the mind with itself" his fundamental category in a discussion  of Plato is a bold and characteristic move on Pater's part, which  again reveals much more about his own "modem view" than it  does about Platonic dialectic. In Plato and Platonism this last  Paterian adaptation of Arnold's famous phrase has the effect of  equating dialectic with the rise of self-consciousness, interiority,  and aesthetic-historical expression.  Pater develops this side of his argument in several ways. For  example, he makes a traditional association of Socrates and Plato  with the rise of Greek humanism or individualism. Against the  "lifeless background of . . .  the unconscious social aggregate, " the  "conscious individual, . . .  the Greek had stepped forth, like the  young prince in the fable, to set things going" (PP, 2 1 ) . This  romance "fable" casts Socrates as the practitioner of the momentous  historical shift inward, the first philosopher to tum from star-gazing  to the "cosmical order" within. Thus it is truly said, Pater reports,  that "Socrates brought philosophy down from heaven to earth"  (PP, 8 1 ) . Again equating dialectic with an interior process, Pater  formulates the difference between sophistry and true dialectic as a  matter of insides and outsides. The essential sophistic "vice" derived  from the fact that their hold on things was merely external, or  "superficial, " whereas dialectical treatment yields and expresses an  internal hold on the subject matter under consideration (PP, 1 1 6- 1 8 ) .  The essential function of the Socratic method was to create  </page> <page sequence="39"> Dialogue and Dialectic · 2 7 3 ·  such a self-conscious interiority, "to flash light into the house  within. "   Fully occupied there, as with his own essential business in his own home,  the young man would become, of course, proportionately less interested  . . . i n what was superficial, in the mere outsides. (PP, 1 20)   This domestic fantasy of internal order is more Pater's than Plato's, a  variation of the Paterian figure of the "house of thought. " Pater goes  on to attribute to Socrates a desire, which Pater calls the "central  business of education, " to teach young men their importance to them­ selves (PP, 90, ! 20, 1 39 ) . 1  The fulfillment of humanism in Paterian  terms is found here at its very origins in the sense that self-knowledge  is somehow "sacramental" (PP, 9 1 ) .  Pater manages this remarkable shift inward in part through his  treatment of the Platonic doctrine of recollection. He discusses the  Meno in his chapter on the Pythagorean influence. "Eristic Meno"  asks Socrates whether learning can reasonably be possible : How can  we reach the utterly unfamiliar? How can we learn what we do not  already know? Of course, the famous Platonic answer is that we  do already know: one can learn because one innately has access to  knowledge through reminiscence. Learning is a matter of gradually  becoming conscious of this innate potential, fleshing it out in terms  of finite experience, through dialectic, in time.  Plato dramatizes this doctrine through the dialogue between Socra­ tes and Meno's slave boy, who discovers within himself a knowledge  of geometry as he is guided by the graduated questions of Socrates.  The Socratic method "induces" knowledge, or causes it to be ex­ pressed, and perhaps at this point we can begin to appreciate Pater's  attempt to assimilate Platonic recollection to his own Hegelian  scheme of expression in history. With this anecdote of Meno's slave  boy, Pater (as well as Plato) purports to show innate knowledge coaxed  out and revealed-to prove, in other words, that "recovery is an act of  reminiscence" (PP, 6 s ) .   In  fact, the story shows more forcibly ( though also more tacitly) the  power of dialectic, of leading questions from without, of the guiding  authority of another interlocutor. Pater's figures reveal the essential  role of the dialectician: " the reasonable questions of Socrates fall  like water on the seed-ground, or like sunlight on the photographer's  r .  Bloom notes that this emphasis is "highly Paterian, and closer to Pater's Marius  than to Plato" (introduction to Selected Writings, p. 239, n. 19 ) .   </page> <page sequence="40"> • 2 7 4 • Greek Studies and Plato and Platonism  negative" (PP, 6 3 ) . Dialectical treatment, then, is as necessary as water  to organic growth or, with even more intense a wit on Pater's part, as  the process of photographic "development" to a "negative. "  Socrates'   own favorite figure-which portrays his questioning as "being after  all only a kind of mid-wife's assistance"-admits to less intervention  than Pater's (PP, 8 3 ) . But Pater, too, throws the emphasis on reminis­ cence and recovery:  Those notions were in the boy . . . . A ncient, half-obliterated inscriptions  on the mental walls, the mental tablet, seeds of knowledge to come, shed  by some flower of it long ago . . . . ( PP, 66 )   Everything is  inside ( "present from the first, " as  Pater describes Leo­ nardo's prevision of the Mona Lisa), the "seeds" of all knowledge  waiting for the appropriate "tendency" or care in order to "develop. "   Like the Interpreter, the dialectical interlocutor coaxes articulation  from within a mythic wholeness.  Through a modem transposition of Platonic recollection, Pater es­ tablishes the basis for treating "the dialogue of the mind with itself"  as the original dialectical activity. The dialectic that is "co-extensive  with life itself" is essentially this "continuous company we keep with  ourselves through life" (PP, 1 8 5 ) . But in order for that "company" to  have any potential for dialogue or conversation, it must be diversified.  In this respect, Pater's forceful emphasis on the personal quality of  Platonic ideas serves him well, and here again it should be noted that  his emphasis is characteristically Paterian rather than Platonic.  For Plato "all knowledge was like knowing a person, " Pater repeat­ edly argues, because knowledge is emergent, slowly developing, and  plastic or physiognomic (PP, 129 ) .  Like Adam naming the animals,  Plato gives names to invisible acts, processes, and abstractions; he  conceives of the ideas as living things (PP, 14 1  ) . Pater criticizes the  Eleatics' anti-Homeric aversion to polytheism as well as their anti­ anthropomorphic conception of deity; their conception of the One  was without color and form, without personal presence, a god "neither  here nor there, then nor now" (PP, 3 3 ) . But in Plato, Pater argues, the  One becomes "delightfully multiple, as the world of ideas. " According  to Pater, Plato restores the Homeric pantheon as an allegorical pan­ theon of Virtues, " like a recrudescence of polytheism in that abstract  world; a return of the many gods of Homer, veiled now as abstract  notions" (PP, 46, 1 6 8-69 ) .  As a result of Plato's mode of conceiving  the ideas, then, the world within is now a populated place : "he made us  </page> <page sequence="41"> Dialogue and Dialectic • 2 7 5 •  freemen of those solitary places . . . h e peopled them with intelligible  forms" (PP, 143 ) .   Not only does Pater re-allegorize the Platonic ideas as  persons, he  also imagines the mind populated with the various aspects of its own  personal identity. All these internalized characters take part in "the  dialogue of the mind with itself" : the advocatus diaboli, the dog, the  child, the youth, each one offering from time to time his characteristic  point of view (PP, 1 83 -84) .  Thus Pater imagines the diverse "company  we keep with ourselves. " The Paterian "dialogue of the mind with  itself, " as Part One of this book made clear, is an achievement of  conscious self-division which permits both mobility and fixation; here  we see the same sort of conscious self-division equipping the mind  with all possible points of view. In our discussion of Marius we found  a historical-fictional world peopled with epiphenomena! projections  of the central self, each one representing a stage in the Bildung of our  protagonist, and here we see all those stages of growth potentially  contained in one place. Pater's conception of the "dialogue of the mind  with itself, " in other words, has been enriched once more within the  context of Plato and Platonism. What Pater has imagined in this little  vignette of the internal company is a figure of the mind itself as mythic  manifold, enfolding in its interior all the "aspects" of the complete  person, all possible moods and points of view, all moments and stages  of a life history which unfolds in time.  In this sense, dialectic operates on the principle of Justice, as it is  defined in the fourth book of The Republic: "the doing, by every part,  in what is essentially a whole consisting of parts, of its own proper  business therein" (PP, 1 1 1  ). This proportionate relation of parts to a  whole is also expressed in Pater's dominant figure of synthesis in  this volume, the figure of music. Musical form is "synthetic" both  synchronically and diachronically; it emphasizes proportionate rela­ tion both at every moment, as harmony, and also over the course of  time, as sequence. Used in The Renaissance to stand for the ideal goal  of all aesthetic expression because its content is not separable from  its formal relations, music is used in Plato and Platonism to represent  aspiration in general within "the human mind itself. " The aesthetic  aspiration toward musical form has become in this last volume histor­ ical aspiration as musical form. For Pater, dialectic is that form, in  which all life as well as "all art constantly aspires towards the condi­ tion of music. "  Like music, dialectic figures the sense of life as tempo­ rality, as the pleasure in relations unfolding in surprising ways at each  moment, the sense of total form accumulating as growth over time.  Pater takes account of this aesthetic element in his understanding  </page> <page sequence="42"> · 276 • Greek Studies and Plato and Platonism  of dialectic. According to Plato's own figure in The Republic, to pursue  the dialectic is to enter upon "a voyage of discovery" (PP, 1 1 4 ) .   Socrates says: "I do  not yet know, myself; but, we must just go  where  the argument carries us, as a vessel runs before the wind."  (PP, 1 8 5 )   But Pater questions this figure. He cogently points out that often the  dialogue in progress produces a feeling of continuous surprise, as if its  movement were random, and yet at times the dialectic seems clearly  guided by "a kind of 'Providence' " (PP, 1 84 ) .  With the subtlest of  secularization-effects, Pater recognizes in that "kind of 'Providence' "  a figure for the "end" of literary form, the moment of closure which  lends a retrospective coherence and shape to the work as a whole.  After all, as a model for dialectical process the ascent of a mountain  does envision the end of the journey at the highest point, the position  on the mountaintop where "the 'synoptic' view of the mountain as a  whole" is available at last (PP, 1 80 ) .   In this volume Pater has formulated a theoretical model to accom­ modate the paradox of an unguided search that is nevertheless in the  hands of "a sort of 'Providence. ' " Both functions may be figuratively  understood as aspects of one mind: the experiencing aspect in the  midst of dialogue is supervised by the aspect of the dialectician, who  lends direction while effacing his guiding role. Dialogue is a figure for  dialectical method, and the "dialogue of the mind with itself" is  simply another figure for those mobile parts of a divided whole, under­ stood as the self-divisions of an individual consciousness as well as  the divisions of history. By internalizing the figure of the dialogue,  Pater transfigures it, making the figure metafigural : a general model  of the aesthetic function controlling the "organic. "  Pater criticizes the Sophists because they have no real goal for their  superficial inquiry, whereas the goal of Platonic dialectic is absolute :  the complete knowledge of the Beautiful and Good " as in itself it really  is. " While Pater has, with his "modern view, " put more emphasis on  the process toward the goal than on the goal itself, there is nevertheless  a strong sense of teleology in this volume. "Our pilgrimage is meant  indeed to end in nothing less than the vision of what we seek" (PP,  1 92 ) .  Until the end of the journey we cannot see, "as if in a single  moment of vision, " all the stages of ascent and perspective which  comprise the "synoptic" view from the mountaintop (PP, 1 5 8 ) .  But at  the closure of a Platonic Dialogue, one has access to the process as a  completed form. Pater has faith that aesthetic form can provide a  modern "equivalent for" or "sense of" Platonic Form. He approxi- </page> <page sequence="43"> Dialogue and Dialectic · 2 77 ·  mates in the literary form of his own volume that synoptic view,  providing at once a sense of lively exploration and a sense of providen­ tial teleology which is one effect of his formal stance of distant retro­ spection. In the final section of this study we shall see how this late  volume appreciates life in time from the perspective of completed  form.  It is a life, a systematised, but comprehensive and far-reaching, intellec­ tual life, in which the reason, nay, the whole nature of man, realises all  it was designed to be, by the beatific "vision of all time and all existence. "  (PP, 1 8 3 )   7 · Paterian Recollection : The Anagogic Mind  The Paterian Plato is constructed as a mythic whole, a figure who  synthesizes all philosophies before him and generates all that come  afterward. His relation to Socrates serves to emphasize Plato's emer­ gence as a distinct figure against the background of orality or prehis­ tory, and thus Plato/Socrates becomes one of Pater's "two-sided" fig­ ures, representing both the mythic manifold and its break into  literature and into history. Pater's own relation to Plato, as it is con­ structed in this volume, is another such "two-sided" figure, a "twofold  power, an embodied paradox" (PP, 87 ) .   Like Plato's literary re-creation of Socrates, we  might think of Pa­ ter's Plato as merely a "stage disguise, " were it not for independent  evidence (PP, 7 5 ). That Pater's interpretation of Plato largely recapitu­ lates contemporary sources only makes this point all the more inter­ esting, ' for Pater has effectively shaped the perspective of his lectures  to synthesize the "received" or "common" views of his contemporary  historical moment. With the persona adopted in these lectures, there­ fore, Pater attunes the "Diaphaneite" to the music of his own day. In  so doing, Pater tacitly casts himself as a modem Ficino, "translating"  Plato to his own later age, re-creating a Plato who would be recognized  by his contemporaries in the late nineteenth century and who is  recognizable now as a particularly late-nineteenth-century Plato. The  Paterian Plato is a figure "fitted" to its intellectual environment.  Pater's identification with Plato works both ways, as do all the  r .  Esp. Grote and Muller (see above, Part Four, sec. 4, n.2 ) .  </page> <page sequence="44"> · 278 • Greek Studies and Plato and Platonism  modernizing tropes we have been examining. As a result of this "two­ sided figure, " a Platonic Pater comes into being as surely as the Pater­ ian Plato. Pater attributes to Plato the synthesis that (as almost all  critics have agreed) he himself worked out in many forms throughout  the course of his career. He begins his dialectic with the atomism of  the Heraclitean flux. Recognizing the problems with that doctrine, he  imagines its opposite-an equally facile, undifferentiated unity-and  uses that opposition dialectically to generate the "music" that to Pater  represents not only the unity of matter and form but also, and perhaps  even more important, change controlled by permanence, the process  of consciousness stabilized in the end through historical retrospection.  The question raised for Plato by the doctrine of Heraclitus is the  question raised in the "Conclusion" to The Renaissance, and at the  end of Pater's career we find him quoting from the same passage of  the Cratylus that provided the epigraph to that incendiary early essay  (PP, 14 ) .   In  Plato and Platonism, Pater considers this passage from the Craty­ lus at greater length. The challenge Socrates offers as a response to  the Heraclitean doctrine, read in its Paterian context, is the question  of historical change : "Now, how could that which is never in the same  state be a thing at all ? "  (PP, 1 6 ) .  How can change be conceived so that  its force toward dissipation and fragmentation is controlled at some  point ? How can change be conceived so that it does not obliterate  identity ? Pater answers this question on the level of historical as well  as phenomenological discourse. The present study has been devoted  to an examination of Pater's answering figures. His figures of " develop­ ment" play one kind of "music" which harmonizes the colorful flux  with its deep structure. Pater's "historic method" allows simultane­ ously for constant transformation on one level and profoundly stable  identity on another. Thus Pater re-creates for the nineteenth century  the synthetic manifold he has attributed to Plato. He synthesizes the  representative thinkers of his time-the figures of Darwin and Hegel  prominent among them-in the complex unity of his own "historic  method. "  But he ends by portraying these forces of thought as "perma­ nent tendencies" in the "human mind itself, " and in this register  he transcends historical change with his own myth and figures of  permanence.  Pater describes a Plato who like himself lives at the end of a long  tradition. Though Plato, when he is regarded retrospectively from the  late nineteenth century, usually represents the beginnings of philoso­ phy, Pater portrays him as already "late, " "eclectic, " "encyclopaedic, "  and "weary" of sectarian debate, not "fresh" in the "morning of the  </page> <page sequence="45"> Paterian Recollection · 2 79 •  mind's history" IPP, 6 ) .  Like Heraclitus, Plato "feels already old" (PP,  1 3 ) .  In this assimilation of Plato to his imaginative perspective at the  end of the line, Pater achieves renewed energy for his own age : if Plato  himself appears as a "late" product of culture, then there is hope that  the late nineteenth century too may mark a beginning, when seen  from a still later perspective. Pater strikingly associates Plato's dia­ logue form with the skeptical, dialectical essay, the "characteristic  literary type of our own time, " and he claims that the essay came  into being along with the "relative spirit" in the Renaissance of the  sixteenth century IPP, 1 74-7 5 ) . Thus Pater characteristically extends  "our own time" to include the modernism of the Renaissance and of  Plato's age as well . In other words, on one level Pater realizes how  forced this analogy might seem, and yet he argues that the Platonic  Dialogue is "essentially" an essay, passing now and then back into  the "poetry" of the former, primeval era (PP, 1 76 ) .  When in the service  of this analogy he identifies Plato with Montaigne or, even more  improbably, with Thackeray, all readers must be aware that Pater is  assimilating his own modernism to Plato's (PP, 1 32, 1 7 5 ) . 2   To be "modem" in this sense is precisely to be "late, " "eclectic, "  "encyclopaedic, " and even "weary. " Taking the long view, assuming  the stance of vast retrospection, is one essential aesthetic gesture of  this modernism; a pervasive strategy of cross-cultural analogy is the  other. The creation of the Paterian Plato simultaneously modernizes  Plato and transforms Pater into a very old thing indeed, as he identifies  with the origins of his literary and philosophical culture. As usual,  this figurative maneuver begins with the prospect of great difference,  but in its most extreme form, as here, it ends by collapsing difference  into similarity. As Pater demonstrated in "The Anecdote of the Shell, "  a long experience in time is necessary to develop the ability to read  the world "by a kind of short-hand, " to see things whole, "in a single  moment of vision" (PP, 1 5 8 ) .  Pater certainly takes this long view in  Plato and Platonism, and the effect of his gesture in its particular  context is to collapse the differences of historical time in a moment  of vision, which is represented by the lecturer's perspective in the  present.  Pater's long view is an attempt to represent the perspective sub  specie eternitatis like that of Parmenides, but with a difference (PP,  2 7 ) . Even in this extreme statement of his historicism, Pater holds to  the process of reaching back through difference to unity, rather than  2. On the assimilation of Plato to Montaigne, see Turner, Greek Heritage, p. 407 ;   on Pater's projective relation to  Plato, see Delaura, Hebrew and Hellene, p. 299 .   </page> <page sequence="46"> • 280 • Greek Studies and Plato and Platonism  reaching for a direct, unmediated vision of unity. His approach is  more like Augustine's in the Confessions, with Books ro through 1 3   approximating the perspective sub specie eternitatis only after Books  1 through 9 retrospectively proceed through the vicissitudes of earthly  experience. 3 But unlike the Confessions, where the totalizing perspec­ tive is relegated to the last few chapters, Plato and Platonism displays  the effects of this perspective throughout. Thus the emphasis finally  rests in the "synoptic view" from the mountaintop, rather than in the  process of reaching that summit. Pater writes from the end of the line,  after the climb.  Like Plato's, his is an "encyclopaedic view" (PP, 6 ) .  Using the anal­ ogy of the Platonic dialogue to describe dialectical thought, Pater  writes that the "full light of indefectible certitude"  can only happen by a summary act of intuition upon the entire perspec­ tive, wherein all those partial apprehensions, which one by one may have  seemed inconsistent with each other, find their due place. . . . The mind  attains a hold, as if by a single imaginative act, through all the transitions  of a long conversation, upon all the seemingly opposite contentions of  all the various speakers at once. (PP, 1 8 1 )   To Pater, historical life, like the dialogue, seems contradictory or  fragmentary only if one looks at an isolated part of its development.  But from the point of view of the end, all contradictions are at last  resolved into perfect form. "Perfection . . . is attainable only through  a certain combination of opposites" (PP, 24) . 4   But dialectic is "co-extensive with life itself, " as we have seen (PP,  1 8 5 ), and Pater has been at pains to portray the vivid, lifelike quality  of " suspended judgment, " the doubtful intellect aspiring in the midst  of life, rather than resting in "the full light of indefectible certitude"  at the end. Until life is over, the place where "all those partial appre­ hensions . . . find their due place" can only be in the mind of the  Interpreter. The "synoptic view" from the mountaintop is an anagogic  perspective, figuratively possible only when life itself has come to an  3 .  I am indebted to the analysis of Augustine in William C.

The  diachronic dimension of the historic method gives way to the syn­ chronic, and the volume is dominated by the anagogic mind that  "comprehends" all the divided forms of life in time. In this volume,  the end of time is figured by literary closure, specifically the end of a  Platonic Dialogue. At the moment of its closure, dialectic-which  is movement toward this complete perspective-is replaced by the  "summary" or "synoptic view. " From the point of view at its end, the  unguided journey is felt to have been in the hands of "a kind of  'Providence' " after all, and that particular "kind" of secularized Provi­ dence has been identified with the Interpreter himself.  This particularly Paterian anagogical perspective must also be seen  as a modernization of Platonic recollection. Pater's aesthetic histori­ cism has all along had this "aspect/' but never before has it been so  pervasively entertained as in this volume, where the point of view at  the end of the line returns upon itself to examine the "ground" of its  being. If "the composite experience of all the ages is part of each one  of us, " Pater can "remember" Plato as a part of his own historically  spiritual preexistence (B, r 96 ) .  This view solves the problems of histor­ ical skepticism with a certain secularized faith. Because the past in  all its variety exists within, a differentiated company of voices engage  there in "the dialogue of the mind with itself, " and there they may be  re-collected through a discipline of introspection that is indistinguish­ able from historical retrospection. Pater's great vision assumes the  power of each individual to imitate "the secular process of the eternal  mind, " to take the perspective from which individual identity may be  lost without regret, subsumed in the wholeness of a secularized eternal  life .  It is humanity itself now-abstract humanity-that figures as the trans­ migrating soul, accumulating into its " colossal manhood" the experience  of ages; making use of, and casting aside in its march, the souls of  countless individuals, as Pythagoras supposed the individual soul to cast  aside again and again its outworn body.
