Against Socrates and many contemporary thinkers on the subject, Mele attempts to vindicate akrasia as a genu ine possibility. As he explores the theoretical labyrinth, his view emerges as rich in philosophic insight and experimental data from psychological research, the latter of which he uses effectively in showing the way out of a number of paradoxes. The possibility of "strict akratic action" (roughly, free intentional action against one's better judgment) is his central concern. This seems to presuppose free will as a basis for the possibility of akrasia and Mele recognizes the importance of this point early on in the book. But in order to demarcate clearly his concerns and not venture too far into broader metaphysical problems, he simply contends that, while actions not freely performed are not strict akratic actions, they may nevertheless be akratic (p. 30). For although an irresistible desire may render an action unfree, perhaps somewhere in the causal chain the agent was able to take preventative measures to avoid the desire. Mele's methodological strategy for solving many of the complex theoretical problems surrounding weakness of the will involves in venting examples of everyday akratic behavior in order to make a fairly common-sensical point about the issue at hand or to show the untenability of his opponent's position. This can be a particularly effective method of refutation. At other times the examples can be quite extraordinary and appear tailor-made to suit his view. One of the central theses of this work is that philosophical models for the explanation of behavior are designed for rational behavior and therefore do not adequately accommodate irrational behavior. Where this occurs the irrational behaviors may be denied as theoreti cally impossible (p. vii). Mele attempts to remedy this situation by recognizing the importance of self-control, enkrateia, and its oppo site, akrasia, in constructing an adequate conceptual framework for explaining continent and incontinent action (p. 50). This leads to an excellent chapter on a paradox of self-control where an agent is mo tivated to perform some action at one time but intentionally resists this action and becomes more motivated not to perform it. The question to be pondered is, for example, how can an agent be moti vated to smoke and motivated not to smoke at the same time? If an agent is most motivated to smoke, how does he exercise self-control at all and thereby become more motivated to resist smoking? (pp. 62-63). Two sides of this paradox are identified as: (i) the paradox of uphill self-control, where one's balance of motivation concerning the exercise or nonexercise of self-control in support of one's acting here and now is at odds with one's contemporaneous balance of motivation concerning one's acting or not acting here and now, and (ii) the para dox of downhill self-control, where one is most motivated to exercise self-control now in support of one's acting here and now (p. 64). The trouble with (ii) concerns the supposition that the two motivations</page><page sequence="3">630 ALISTAIR MORRISON AND STAFF competing over whether self-control is exerted are the same motiva tions competing over what one does. It is however (i) that Mele regards as the real challenge, for the very difficulty lies in under standing how one "who is more motivated at t to A at t* [where t* may or may not be identical with t] than not to A at t* can be sufficiently motivated at t to exercise self-control in defense of his not A-ing at t*" (p. 64). Mele rejects the attempt to resolve the paradoxes by slicing t into smaller units of time with corresponding changes in motivation in favor of an analysis of the various constituent elements of motiva tion, namely, the determinants of the motivational force of a desire? positive, negative and cognitive. The key to resolving the paradox, he contends, lies in recognizing that the motivational strength of a desire need not always be a function simply of the positive contribu tion to the motivational strength of the desire, nor even of its total motivational base. "Two desires having the same total motivational base may differ in strength" (p. 72). This is how a desire to exer cise self-control can win out in the end. The crux of Mele's view occurs in chapter 6 where self-control is brought to bear upon the explanation of akratic action. Mele points out that while akratic action itself is irrational behavior, its explana tion is perfectly rational. Here he explores Davidson's attempt to explain irrationality by a mental partitioning of various causal ele ments affecting motivation, and Pears's modified partitioning hy pothesis. Both are rejected as unnecessarily anthropomorphic and inadequate to the task. Influences on motivation are rather ex plained by: (i) the perceived proximity of the rewards of the incon tinent alternative, (ii) the agent's level of motivation to perform the continent alternative, (iii) the agent's failure to make an effective attempt at self-control, and (iv) the agent's attentional condition (p. 92). In any one of these cases or in any combination thereof the balance of motivation can be affected to fall on the side of the incon tinent action. One can judge it best to do A yet be more motivated to doB. In this short space I have only focused attention on the most im portant parts of Mele's treatment of incontinent action. Other chapters on akratic belief and self-deception are however equally important since his central task is to show how both incontinent action and self-deception are possible under his modified belief-desire model for the explanation of behavior. Mele argues that self-decep tion is not properly modeled strictly after central cases of interper sonal deception and that its explanation does not require the postu lation (? la Pears) of sub-agents. This work is a clear and careful analysis of a topic often confused by neglect of important results in psychological research. Given that Mele's approach to akrasia is sound, a philosopher's acquaintance with general philosophical and logical principles is insufficient to deal with the complexity of the problems: he must cut his teeth on the hard data provided by the experimental research as well. Mele's book is rigorously argumentative and will be appreciated not</page><page sequence="4">SUMMARIES AND COMMENTS 631 only by philosophers specially concerned with the problems of akratic action, but also by those with a general interest in intentionality and the philosophy of action.?Leemon B.
