In summary, it is difficult to review this book because of Dorson's stature as a folklorist, his recent death, and the peculiar nature of the publication itself. Should contemporary folklorists be pleased that perhaps the most influential man in the modern history of the discipline has at least given lip service to a more inclusive ethnographic approach to urban lore? Or should we be dismayed that this book has made such a hash out of a regional study of an important ur- ban/industrial area that it should be discredited by the discipline and hidden from view? The discipline needs models on which to base its approach to what may be the object of an incredi- ble thrust by folklorists into the public sphere in the near future. If the amendment to the Na- tional Historic Preservation Act of 1966 is enacted and funded, then our discipline could ex- perience an explosion of interest comparable to the cultural resource management revolution that has rocked the discipline of archeology since the 1970s. It would be unfortunate if at that time we had only Land of the Millrats to offer as a single full-length published model. University of North Carolina ROBERT H. BYINGTON Wilmington University of South Carolina ROBERT S. MCCARL Columbia The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends and Their Meanings. By Jan Harold Brun- vand. (New York: Norton, 1981. Pp. xiv + 208, preface, afterword, glossary, appendix, index. $5.95 paper) "Hear! Hear! A noted folklorist gets at the root of rumors." So begins People Magazine's August 23, 1982 article featuring Jan Harold Brunvand, the author of The Vanishing Hitch- hiker. The article suggests that Brunvand's 1981 study of the intersection of folk legendry and mass communications has become a media event in itself. An earlier article in Psychology Today (June 1980), as well as interviews with the author on National Public Radio, on ABC's David Letterman show, and on CBS' Morning News confirm this impression. Intended for the general public, the book sensitizes its readers in a highly readable and effec- tive way to both the dynamic narrative process in an urban context and the discipline of folklore and folklife studies. This double exposure is vital in a time when informal cultural ex- pression and its study appear to be less valued than formerly. The text literally interweaves communication patterns and technological developments and so legitimizes American urban legends and their meanings. The first introductory chapter, "New Legends for Old," is an especially useful overview of the genre, of its performance contexts, of its possibility as cultural symbol, and of the need for analysis. Precisely because it is such a showpiece, however, The Vanishing Hitchhiker raises questions for folklorists, especially those interested in legend studies, which are not easily resolved. The first question involves the selection of texts. Chapters two through seven present the classic automobile legends, teenage horror stories, food contamination rumors, fear-of-the-dead anec- dotes, nudity narratives, and stories about business ripoffs. Chapter eight outlines urban legends in the making such as "The Economical Car" and "The Ghost Airliner." Why are these legend cycles included and not others? Stories about urban crime, especially "The Castrated Child in the Shopping Mall Restroom," and stories about elevator accidents such as "There's Room for One More" and "The Elevator Decapitation" seem as likely candidates for consideration as those already cited. The second question grows out of the first. Just what about these legends makes them 356</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS American, urban, and modern? For each legend analyzed, Brunvand usually gives European, sometimes East Asian, antecedents as well as rural and historical examples. In his discussion of "The Girl with the Beehive Hairdo," for example, the author quotes medieval English ana- logues about the vain woman's elaborate coiffure becoming a nesting place for a demonic spider (pp. 78-79). What are the specific cultural uses of these widespread themes? And the third question grows out of the second and is related to the text-context dialectic. The first chapter stresses the need for recording and analyzing legend-telling performances in context (pp. 15-16). This message is reiterated in the appendix, "Collecting and Studying Ur- ban Legends" (pp. 197-202). Yet the main body of the book contains classic historic- geographic analyses of legend cycles, fascinating in themselves, but essentially textual and not contextual approaches. The textual approach to legend study may account for the gaps in the otherwise fine bibliography and index. Linda Degh's and Andrew Vazsonyi's "Legend and Belief" in Folklore Genres, edited by Dan Ben-Amos, and American Folk Legend: A Symposium, edited by Wayland D. Hand, are missing, for example. Each of the cited titles does concen- trate on the performance aspects of the genre. Looking at legend-telling at the time of performance and looking at it from the point of distributional patterns of variants result in two quite different approaches to a final question: the problem of truth and falsity in legend analysis. The first concentrates on the uncertainty of the participants in the moments of communication; the second on the analytical verification of falsehood. Although Brunvand's study focuses on the second approach, the first is most useful in analyzing legend-telling as a cultural symbol. I, for one, think that the relationship of reality and fantasy is such an intricate one that I will always look into my car before getting into the driver's seat no matter how many variants of "The Killer in the Back Seat" I have heard! Brunvand's "afterword" (pp. 187-191), however, is a fine summing-up of the cultural possibilities inherent in a study of the genre: "Probably by the time this is being read new ex- amples of false-true tales will already be going around, and these urban legends too will con- tain symbols of our culture and reflections of our lives" (p. 191). In effect, The Vanishing Hitchhiker itself takes on attributes not unlike the cultural symbols it describes. It is a tangible, concrete representation of a folk genre and of an academic discipline. As such, it is a valuable reference point for both, and belongs on every library shelf. Wayne State University JANET L.
