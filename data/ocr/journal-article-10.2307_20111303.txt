<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Man's World? Gender, Family, and Architectural Patronage, in Medieval India Padma Kaimal Colgate University Ohortly before 908 CE., a woman named Na?gai Bh?ti ?ditya Picj?riy?r sponsored the construction of a granite temple (Fig. 1) to the god Siva Candra?ekhara in Tiruccendurai, a village that lies twelve kilometers up the K?v?ri River from modern Tirucir?palli in India's south eastern state ofTamiln?cJu (Fig. 2).1 The purpose of this arti cle is to explore issues of gender raised by her patronage of this monument: is there any point in knowing that this building's patron was a woman?2 Readers in the twenty first century need to know Na?gai's gender because the agency her patronage demonstrates challenges stereotypes of India as a place of ruthless and universal repression of women.3 To Na?gai's contemporaries, however, her identity as a woman probably had little significance as they regarded the expensive and highly visible temple she sponsored. Tamil donative patterns suggest that south Indian men and women of privilege frequently made public displays of pious gen erosity, action still perceived as highly virtuous in Tamil soci ety.4 Wealth enabled her to sponsor an entire temple; her gender may have been irrelevant.5 Na?gai's case reminds us that, in many places and times, art patronage has been expected of women. Art patronage has not been universally regarded, as some regard it now, as an essentially male sphere of activity, penetrated by women to appropriate male authority or to resist patriarchal sub ordination. 6 Na?gai's patronage also reminds us how wide ly different cultures' constructions of gender may vary, and that methods of gender study for European art may apply only selectively to Indie art.7 Instead of seeking in Na?gai's temple signs of her rebel lion against male authority, therefore, I inquire into the nature of Na?gai's agency and of the identity she project ed through this gift to Siva. Because temple inscriptions report that Na?gai was born into the powerful IrukkuveJ family and married to a son of the ruling Cola king, I have explored marriage patterns and notions of family, looking for correlations between family affiliations and architec tural styles. I have found that Na?gai's temple resembles to a significant degree temples built by her IrukkuveJ rela tives?her father, brother, and brother's son?but has little in common with Cola practices. This is noteworthy because Na?gai may have been affiliated with the Colas when she built her temple. If not already married to the Cola prince, she probably knew she would be soon. And she certainly continued to make large gifts to her temple after she had married. Marriage, in fact or in prospect, did not discourage her from presenting her identity in terms of her natal family. The features of Na?gai's temple also suggest that con formity with her natal family's practice of temple con struction did not efface her individual identity. In its archi tectural details her temple differs from temples sponsored by other Irukkuv?js in much the same degree that those temples vary from each other. If the artisans building these Fig. i.

Map of selected temple sites around the K?v?r? delta, Tam?n?cju (graphie design: Julia Meyerson). monuments followed patrons' instructions about visual design, those artisans seem to have been equally responsive to women and to men. At the same time, Na?gai's temple does not differ markedly from those of her male relatives in its size, degree of ornament, or other aspects where dif ference could suggest defiance against exclusive male pre rogatives. Within the context of her natal family, her agency as a patron seems to have been ungendered. PATRONAGE IN THE KAV?R? DELTA This essay forms part of my continuing inquiry into the patronage of some hundred temples built in the K?v?r? delta of central Tamiln?du during the ninth and tenth cen turies. I have argued elsewhere that fewer than half a dozen of these monuments were, as earlier scholarship had claimed, "Early Cola temples" built by the first kings of the C?k dynasty.8 Many inscriptions cover these temples, but their main purpose was to record financial arrangements for temple maintenance; they rarely name the people who sponsored architectural construction. Of those that do, most name important residents of nearby towns or mem bers of princely families (such as the Irukkuv?ls) with whom the Colas intermarried. Of the few Cola patrons named, women considerably outnumber men. Early Cola kings do not seem to have been in a position to act as dis cerning monarch-connoisseurs of temple architecture, and their regnal periods are not relevant structures upon which to frame a chronological development of temple form, as most scholarship on these monuments has attempted to do. 27</page><page sequence="3">These temples are, moreover, scattered among many vil lages. They differ from one another in many features of their architecture. Scholars have successfully linked many variations in South Asian temple architecture to differ ences in place and time. Temples built in the ninth and tenth centuries across the delta of the branching K?v?r? do share a macro-style that distinguishes them from temples of other periods and of neighboring areas. Variations of form within that early K?v?r? macro-style have, however, resisted scholars' attempts to organize them into convinc ing micro-regions and subperiods.9 The chief reason for their failure, I suspect, is that they seek a single, linear developmental sequence, based on the assumption that architectural production was centralized under the patron age of the C?k kings.10 I am convinced by the temples' inscriptions, geograph ic distribution, and architectural diversity that temple patronage before the eleventh century was dispersed among many residents of the K?v?r? delta. Various patrons appear to have contracted with various artisan workshops in a complex and perhaps irregular web of associations. Though the impact of artisans on architec tural style must have been profound, I am not yet able to distinguish where artisans' influence left off and patrons' influence began. Inscriptions do not name artisans as they do patrons, depriving us of that secondary layer of evidence to compare against the visual evidence of the temples. I therefore begin the task of sorting out these temples' stylistic variations with the more fully docu mented side of the story, patronage, grouping by patron those temples whose patronage we know from inscrip tions. I confine my speculations in this essay to formal patterns that coincide with inscribed IrukkuveJ patron age. My assumption is that artisans too played a major role in formulating the IrukkuveJ temple style, and that the consistency of style suggests the presence of a single workshop. Scholars have suggested that members of the IrukkuveJ, Muttaraiyar, and Paluv?ttaraiyar families, all of whom inscriptions name as patrons of temple construction, built in distinctive family substyles.11 Because I had found so little evidence of early Cola kings influencing temple con struction, I began this research expecting to find that patronage by other families also had little impact on tem ple form. I have found instead that temples bearing inscriptions explicitly linking their construction to Na?gai and her natal relatives do resemble each other enough to convince me of an IrukkuveJ family style of architecture. I would also note that they share more features than most early K?v?r?-area temples have in common. I2 Consistent features of the Irukkuvel style include two similar designs for the towered roof over the shrine, the presence of three large niches on the central shrine (vimana), the absence of niches on the vestibule (ardhamandapa), two patterns for facetting exterior walls of the vim?na, and a preference for lotus-petal and lion-shaped moldings encircling the tem ple's foundation. NA?GAI'S FAMILIES An inscription of 909 C.E., incised into the Tiruccendurai temple's south wall, declares Na?gai's membership in two of the region's most powerful families.13 This record iden tifies her first as the daughter of Bh?ti Vikramak?sari, head of the IrukkuveJ family; and second as the wife of Arikulak?sari, son of the reigning Cola king, Par?ntaka I (r. 907?954). Na?gai was clearly a woman of importance. The Coks, who would come to dominate much of south ern India during the eleventh and twelfth centuries,14 had urban centers of authority atTa?jav?r and Uraiy?r (with in the city limits of modern Tirucir?palli) in the early tenth century (Fig. 2). Their region of influence extended southward from the K?v?r? River, mostly east of the point where that river begins to branch. The IrukkuveJ family, which flourished from the mid-ninth century into the early tenth, ruled from the town of Kodumb?j?r. They claimed authority over the surrounding region of K?nadu, which lay along the K?v?r?'s south bank and to the west of the Coks' sphere.15 The location of Na?gai's temple reflected her familial situation rather closely. Tiruccendurai was embedded in her natal K?nadu region, but it was also close to Uraiy?r where her husband's family was strong. It is tempting to think that she chose this location deliberately to express her dual affiliations. The genealogies of the Irukkuv?js and early Colas reveal, furthermore, that Na?gai was only one of several individuals who linked these families. As Figure 3 illus trates, her father had married Par?ntaka Cola's sister, Na?gai Varagun?; her paternal grandfather had married the Cok princess Anupam?; their daughter had married Par?ntaka's brother, Kannara: Na?gai's brother married Par?ntaka's sister, C?lapperund?viy?r; and his son, Par?ntakan Siriyav?j?r, would marry the C?k princess Varagun?.16 With so many intermarriages joining these families, the diagram of their genealogies looks more like a braid than a tree. Thomas Trautmann has interpreted these repeatedly linked genealogies as evidence that these families practiced "cross-cousin" marriage, a system common in southern India for centuries.17 Trautmann points out that Irukkuv?js and C?ks each gave brides to the other, signi fying that neither family was consistently in the subordi nate position of giving a bride. The two families were of roughly equal status, then, at the turn of the tenth centu ry. Trautmann also notes that this system of "perpetuated affinity" between families over generations motivated fam ilies to treat their daughters-in-law well.

Efforts to maintain close relations between families would also foster frequent opportunities for brides to visit their natal families. And there could be many natal relatives already at the conjugal home: a new bride could be received in her husband s home by aunts, cousins, and sisters she had known as a girl. In these potent ways cross-cousin marriage permitted a woman's natal support system to extend into her marital world. Na?gai's situation was, moreover, a common one for women of her status. What we learn about associations between her family situation and her temple patronage may well apply to her peers. If her natal family gave her strength before and after marriage, and thus played a part in enabling her to patronize temple construction, the women of other prominent families must also have had the power to build temples. NA?GAI'S TEMPLE AND THE K?V?R? MACRO-STYLE Na?gai's responsibility for building the Tiruccendurai tem ple is announced in the same inscription that identifies her families, and in two other inscriptions on the same wall.18 The earliest of these to mention a date is from 908. It uses the past tense to refer to her construction of the temple and it arranges for festival celebrations there, implying that the temple was finished enough to house ritual perform ance by that year.19 The first reference to her husband appears in 909.20 Thus Na?gai had built her temple by 908 and she was married no more than one year later. If Na?gai was not yet part of the C?k family when she built, it would hardly be remarkable for her to build as she did in the architectural style patronized by her natal family. And yet surely the construction of a temple and the planning of a wedding between powerful families each took some months at least. The two projects could well have overlapped, they appear in the record at such a close interval. Quite likely Na?gai knew, before her temple was finished, that she would be marrying a Cola prince. Her decision to build in the Irukkuv?l style probably took that knowledge into account. At any rate, her willingness to call attention to her temple by making public donations to it in 909, after her marriage, indicates that being a wife did not make her ret icent about her previous agency in this matter or about the natal affiliation her temple's style displays. 29</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 4. South wall of the ardhamantfapa, Candra?ekhara temple, Tiruccendurai. Note the basement moldings below the pilastered wall surfaces and the entablature above. Roughly cut stone blocks just visible at the far right are part of a later addition to the front of Na?gai's temple. That Na?gai may have had access to considerable finan cial resources as an unmarried woman is also noteworthy: the wealth she invested in temple construction need not have come from her Cola affines.21 Youth too seems to have been no obstacle to her being a patron. She was probably quite young when she had her temple built. Her husband would have been little more than twenty-five in 908, given that he would live another fifty-two years and rule as Cola king from 953 to 960. Unless she were sub stantially older than her husband, an unlikely event, Na?gai would have been no more than twenty-five while her temple was under construction. The forms of Na?gai's temple fit easily into the early K?v?r? macro-style, but before I describe its characteris tic features I shall explain my use of the term "style". Though the term has many associations and often denotes the subtle variations an individual artist plays upon a common theme, I use "style," as other studies of these monuments have done, to describe major aspects of building elevation and ground plan in which temples demonstrate patterns of visual similarity and difference. These aspects include the quantity, shape, and arrange ment of superstructure components, wall niches, niche sculptures, wall facetting, and basement moldings. Since discussing niche sculptures involves their subject matter as well as their form, the temples' iconographie programs become yet another feature by which to compare these temples. Iconographie content becomes part of a discus sion of style in this way. I see these features as aspects of temple design over which patrons may have had some control, assuming the premodern Indie workshop process that scholars have lately inferred. Surely the primary responsibility for shap ing temples lay with the artisans who executed them. In their memories, and perhaps in palm-leaf manuscripts, artisans would have carried with them lessons, or sastras, that codified design principles for images, patterns, and formulae for temple design. Different workshops may have worked with different Sastras, which could explain why architectural style varies from region to region. Modern scholars have not identified any Sastras that guid ed early K?v?r? workshops, but the temples themselves suggest that such lessons offered multiple options for molding combinations, superstructure components, wall facetting, and the placement of exterior niches, among other things. Designers would thus have offered options to suit different pocketbooks, different patronage agendas, the proportions of the patrons body, and perhaps differ ent aesthetic tastes. Even among the products of a single workshop, some design variation would be likely. Artists, furthermore, appear to have regarded Sastras as loose guides rather than binding law. In architecture as in Indian music, theater, and painting, artists probably mem orized a general outline, relying on improvisation to pro duce the inspired refinements that finished the work and gave it brilliance.22 Artisans may have offered patrons some choice among those options. Patrons could have influenced the design of their monuments by making such choices and by deciding which artisan workshop to hire among the many that the prolific building activity of the ninth and tenth centuries must have sustained. 30</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 5. West wall of the vim?na, Candra?ekhara temple, Tiruccendurai. Na?gai's temple shares with other early temples of the K?v?r? region their intimate scale and restrained but ele gant ornament (Fig. 1). Later generations have added large halls to the Tiruccendurai temples eastern end but, like its contemporaries, this building's tenth-century core had only two rooms: a single-storied vestibule, or ardhamancjapa (Fig. 4), and, to its west, a towered vim?na (Fig. 5).The ground floor of the vim?na is a cubic structure that functions as a house for Siva in his nonanthropomorphic and cylindrical lihga form. The exterior walls are smooth, windowless sur faces punctuated only by planar offsets and slender pilasters (kal) at regular intervals. At the center of each of the three solid vim?na walls is a tall niche framed by tiny pilasters and a lintel. Crowning the lintel is an arching cluster of foli ate and animal forms (makaraWrana). The west and north niches at Na?gai's temple are now empty, but each must once have held a figure of a deity carved almost fully in the round, as the south niche still does (Fig. 6). At early temples throughout the K?v?r? region, these gently animated and nearly life-sized figures stand out dramatically against the surrounding wall's clean, architectonic masses.23 Supporting and capping the rather austere walls of this and many K?v?ri-region temples are variously shaped basement moldings below (Fig. 7) and a complex entabla ture above (Fig. 5) that visually supports the heavy super structure. The entablature recapitulates in stone the struc tural skeletons of older wood buildings. The elements of this entablature are, from bottom to top, cushion-shaped capitals, square platforms (phalaka) and corbels (p?tik?) leading upward to a frieze (m?i?) of the cavorting dwarfs who are Siva's comic foils (bh?Jta), a prominent and round Fig. 6.

Surmounting the vim?na is a pyramidal superstructure which at Tiruccendurai has two horizontal tiers and a square capstone with sides curved like the letter S (Fig. 1). Each tier is a string (called a h?ra, "necklace") of miniature replicas of temples resting on a cornice that rests in turn on an entablature. These aediculae represent the many palaces that crowd together upon the hill that is, accord ing to descriptions in puranic texts, the celestial city of Siva's heaven.24 On each of the tower's four faces, these aediculae are arranged in bilaterally symmetrical sequences. A viewer perceives busy entablature shapes lay ered horizontally between brief passages of vertical wall surface. The effect is a rich play of shadows that distin guishes the intensely decorative superstructure from the simpler main walls below.The stucco flourishes and color ful paint of later renovations at Tiruccendurai enhance that contrast. Within this template of the early K?v?r? macro-style, many features vary from one temple to the next. Among the temples built by Irukkuv?l patrons, however, I find a very limited range of options for those variable features. TEMPLES BUILT BY NANGAI'S FATHER Na?gai s father, Bh?ti Vikramak?sari, built a temple com plex in the ninth century at Kodumb?j?r (Fig. #).2S It is called the M?vark?yil, which means "triple temple" in Tamil, because it originally consisted of three temples set Fig. 8. M?vark?yil temple complex seen from the northwest, Kocjumb?l?r. Built by Bh?ti Vikramak?sari. In the foreground are foundations of the precinct wall and small shrines attached to its inner face. The standing structures are the central temple (left) and southernmost temple (right) of the original three shrines. 32</page><page sequence="8">side by side, facing west.26 Of the northernmost temple, only the foundation now remains at the site. The other two temples still stand and of these, the temple on the left, orig inally the central one, is slightly taller. Foundations survive of a wide platform that once extended before all three tem ples, and of an encircling precinct wall that had small shrines studding its inner face. The small shrines all opened toward the center of the compound. Many of the architectural features of Na?gai s temple closely resemble those of her father s temple. The flared capstone of each superstructure is square in plan and each tower is two tiers high. Contemporary superstructures throughout the K?v?ri region have one, two, or three tiers. Their capstones may be round, square or octagonal in plan; in profile, their sides are straight, slightly flared, or deeply undulant like the letter S. The central shrine at Bh?ti s compound (Fig. g) shares with Na?gai s temple an unusually grand variation on the lowest tier of the superstructure. The s?i?, or oblong block at the center of each side of the tower, is shaped as a two storied temple (Fig. 10). At Tiruccendurai these tall Sala are the elements picked out in whitewash (Fig. 1). Another unusual feature these temples share are the heavy half cohrmns, visible near the right and left edges of Figure 10 and at the right edge of Figure 11, that appear on either side of each tall S?l? and further draw the viewer s eye toward that block. At Bh?ti s southernmost shrine and many other K?v?ri -area temples, there are no such half-columns. The sculptural moldings at the base of Na?gai's tem ple are partially buried beneath the courtyard soil (Fig. Fig. 9. Central temple seen from the northwest, M?vark?yil complex, Koclumb?l?r. Fig. io. Double-storied safa and attached half-columns, lower tier, west face of superstructure of the central temple, M?vark?yil complex, Kocjumb?l?r. 33</page><page sequence="9">5), but those that remain visible match the leonine and rounded forms at her father's temples (cf. Figs. jAy 7B). At the M?vark?yil, these moldings rest upon a band of huge lotus petals that are carved as if falling softly open (Fig. 12). The Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture posits, as I would, a similar lotus-petal band at Tiruccendurai.27 At the M?vark?yil and at Tiruccendurai each temple s three unbroken vim?na walls demonstrate further similar ities (Figs. 5, 12). A single facet projects at the center of each wall, as the vertical breaks in the basement moldings reveal. A large niche recedes into the center of each facet. One delicately ornamented pilaster frames the right and left edge of each central facet. A pair of these pilasters marks the outer edge of each vim?na wall. The fourth wall of each vim?na opens to a small porch or ardhamancjapa, though at the M?vark?yil only the foundations of those vestibules are now visible (Fig. 9). At Tiruccendurai the ardhamancjapa is still attached to the vim?na (Fig. 13). There and in the foundations of each M?vark?yil temple, the ardhamancjapa does not extend the full width of the vim?na (see Fig. 9) and the ard hamancjapa walls join directly to the vim?na without the indentation that marks this juncture at some other tem ples. The ardhamancjapa foundations surviving at Kocjumb?l?r inscribe unbroken lines on the ground, indi cating that these walls, like those at Tiruccendurai, held no niches for sculpture.28 Most ardhamancjapa walls of this region and period have a south-facing niche for Gane?a, Siva's elephant-headed son, and a north-facing niche for Durg?, the goddess who destroyed the Buffalo Demon.

Niche in south wall of the vim?na, southernmost temple, M?vark?yil complex, Koclumb?l?r. Some contemporary temples have two or three niches in each ardhamancjapa wall.29 The only large niches at Na?gai's and Bh?ti Vikramak?saris temples are the ones embedded in the three closed walls of each vim?na. These niches look to have held sculptures of similar subjects at both sites, and not the subjects represented at most temples in the region. On the vim?nas of most early K?veri-area temples Siva appears in the south-facing niche, seated as the great teacher (Dak?in?m?rti); the west-facing niche houses Vi?nu, Siva in his half-female form (Ardhan?ri), or Siva manifest in an infinite flaming pillar (Li?godbhava); Brahma, the creator god, occupies the north-facing niche. At these Irukkuv?J temples, by contrast, all the surviving niche figures represent manifestations of Siva and all of them stand, including the figures in south-facing niches. At the M?vark?yil the only south-facing niche figure to survive is on the southernmost temple, and it represents Siva standing and playing the vina (Fig. 14).30 The same niche on the central temple is now empty. The M?vark?yil has no west-facing niches because both extant temples open, unconventionally, to the west.Their east-facing nich es contain, at the central temple, Siva as Ardhan?ri (Fig. 15); and at the southern temple as Gang?dhara, catching the falling Gang? River in his outstretched lock of hair (Fig. 16). Both east-facing figures stand, leaning one of their proper right arms on the neck of Siva's bull, Nandi.31 These figures are particularly svelte, and rest so lightly on their feet as to appear almost weightless. Each stands slighdy hip shot, causing the torso to tilt softly to one side and the legs to suggest a gentle forward motion. In the north wall niches of both standing M?vark?yil temples, Siva takes the form of Kank?la, in which he wan ders in penitence for having cut off Brahma's fifth head (Figs. 17} i8).*2 Kank?la's presence here may have some thing to do with the K?l?mukha school of Saivism that Bh?ti Vikramak?sari patronized.33 David Lorenzen has demonstrated that Siva's Kank?la manifestation was of cen 35</page><page sequence="11">Fig. 15.

The figures of Ardhan?ri and Gang?dhara at this tem ple could be part of the same ideology. In those manifes tations Siva's body joins with the bodies of goddesses; K?p?likas particularly emulated Siva by reenacting his physical union with the goddess Parvat?. The iconographie program of Na?gai's temple was simi lar to the program at her father's temple, though in a mir ror image as it faces east instead of west, and in a simpler version on one instead of three shrines. Only the south niche of her temple retains its original figure, and that is a slender, standing image of Siva, his hips and shoulders tilted gently toward his proper right (Fig. 6). The languid pose and slim body recall the niche figures of the M?vark?yil. And he leans one elbow on the neck of his bull, as do the east-fac ing figures at the M?vark?yil (Figs. 15,16). He is clearly not the seated teacher, Dak?in?m?rti, who would come to occupy most south-facing niches in the region. A few cen turies after the temple was built, worshippers felt Dak?in? m?rti's absence keenly enough to set a small figure of him in this niche in front of the niche's original occupant. I propose that the west vim?na niche at Tiruccendurai originally held the broken figure that now lies against the compound wall (Fig. ig). This fragment's dimensions fit that niche,35 and it displays the elegant attenuation, the tilted ribcage, and the standing posture of the original fig 36</page><page sequence="12">Fig. 17.

The slender propor tions and relaxed quality of this fragment's pose indicate that this piece could be as early as the vim?na itself, unlike the other fragments in the yard which are more compact in their proportions and more rigid in their postures. This piece represents Siva as Ardhan?ri, his body verti cally bifurcated into a male right half and a female left half. The lower third of the body, the face, and the single breast?the most readily identifiable marker of this image type?have broken off but the figure is still legible as Ardhan?ri. Note the asymmetries between the broad male shoulder (on the proper right side) and the rounded female one, the straight contours of the male torso and the sinuous contours on the female side, the double arms on the male side and the single arm on the female. Siva's wild and matted locks expand more energetically than the coif fure on his female side. I suggest the temple's west niche rather than its empty north niche as this figure's original home because Ardhan?ri figures at other K?veri-region temples of this period all occupy the niche in the vim?na's back wall.36 At most of these temples the back wall faces west, as it does at Tiruccendurai. At the M?vark?yil, where Ardhan?ri faces east, the east wall is the back wall of the vim?na. If Ardhan?ri occupied the west niche of the Tiruccendurai temple, its position on the temple would be consistent with the same figure's placement at the M?vark?yil. The evidence from which I can conjecture about the north vim?na niche at Tiruccendurai is a pot-bellied dwarf depicted above that niche (Fig. 20). Such dwarfs appear as Siva's attendants on monuments throughout Tamiln?cju. This figure signifies his affiliation with Siva through his thick, swinging locks of hair and the dance-like posture of his spread knees and arms. Similar figures appear over sev 37</page><page sequence="13">eral niches occupied by Siva images at the M?vark?yil (Figs. 14, 16, 17). The figure that once stood beneath this dwarf at Tiruccendurai therefore most likely represented Siva, and perhaps in the same Kank?la manifestation that appears in the M?vark?yil's north-facing niches. Thus Na?gai's temple held relaxed, standing figures of Siva in at least two and perhaps all three of its vim?na niches, in keeping with the unusual iconographie program at her father's M?vark?yil complex. There are admittedly differences between Na?gai's tem ple and her father's, and these extend beyond later restora tions such as the intense coloring and the emphatic stuc coed arches (kudu) on the capstone of the Tiruccendurai temple. Their temples open in opposite directions, as I have mentioned. The entry hall (ardhamancjapa) of Na?gai's temple is larger (Figs. 4,13) and houses four free standing pillars; the foundations remaining at the M?vark?yil trace smaller halls with no interior pillars (Fig. 9). On the Tiruccendurai superstructure, the temple shaped ornaments are peopled with figures carved in relief (Fig. 11). Fewer such figures appear on the M?vark?yil (Fig. 9), although more may once have been rendered in paint. The temples built by this father and daughter were thus similar but not identical. TEMPLES BUILT BY NA?GAI'S BROTHER AND HIS SON Inscriptions on the temples themselves state that Na?gai's brother, Bh?ti Par?ntakan, built the Vacjatirthan?tha tem ple at Andanall?r (Fig. 21) and that his son, Mahim?laya Fig. 19. ?iva as Ardhan?ri.

Irukkuv?l, built the MucukundesVara temple at Kocjumb?l?r (Fig. 22).,37 These temples have several fea tures that Na?gai's and Bh?tiVikramakesari's temples also shared, features that are not universal among early temples of the K?v?ri region. Their superstructures are two tiers high and their capstones are large with deeply flared sides. The MucukundesVara temple's capstone is also square in plan. A single niche pierces each of the vim?nas' three exterior walls. Their ardhamancjapa walls have no niches and they do not extend the full width of the vim?nas, which they abut without extra indentations or facetting of the walls (Figs. 23, 24). The vim?na walls of Mahim?laya Irukkuv?l's temple at Kocjumb?l?r project only in a cen tral facet bordered by single pilasters (Fig. 22). Paired pilasters mark that temple's corners.38 In certain other features these two temples differ from Na?gai's and Bh?ti Vikramak?sari's temples and from each other. The temple at Andanall?r has a circular capstone instead of a square one and employs a more complex design for the facetting of its vim?na walls (Fig. 21). In addition to the wide central facet common to all four temples, two narrower facets project at the left and right edges of each closed vim?na wall at Andanall?r. These nar row facets project less prominendy than the central facet, meaning that each vim?na wall at Andanall?r defines three parallel planes rather than the two planes in vim?na walls at other Irukkuv?l temples. I find similar basement moldings and superstructures at the MucukundesVara and the Andanall?r temple, though both differ from those at Na?gai's temple and her father's. 39</page><page sequence="15">Fig. 22. Superstructure and vim?na walls seen from the south, MucukundesVara temple, Kocjumb?l?r. Built by Mahim?laya IrukkuveJ. The Mucukundesvara and the Andanall?r temple rest on similar configurations of blocky, crystalline layers (Figs. 7C, 7D)?9 These incorporate one chamfered block among their crisp right angles. They have no undulating lotus petals or twisting lions.40 The superstructures resemble each other and are simpler than Na?gai's. The temple shaped block at the center of each side of the lower tier has only one story. This creates a clear visual break between the tiers at the Mucukundesvara (Fig 22). The same configuration was present at Andanall?r until later restorations elongated the temple-shaped elements of its lower tiers (Fig. 21). Neither temple retains the figures that originally occu pied the three vim?na niches. Even their lintel carvings are illegible, those at Andanall?r being heavily whitewashed and those of the Mucukundesvara having remained unfin ished. The figure of Daksin?m?rti in the south niche at Andanall?r has the rigid posture and energized contours characteristic of carving done after the twelfth century. FAMILY STYLE AND OTHER TEMPLES Limited differences and substantial similarities are thus present among the designs of four temples built by close 40</page><page sequence="16">Fig. 23. South wall, ardhamandapa, Vacjat?rthanatha temple, Andanall?r. Ardhamandapa joins the vim?na at the photos left margin. ly related members of the Irukkuv?l family. These temples share features that appear occasionally throughout the K?v?ri region, as well as features that are common within that region's macro-style. This considerable degree of shar ing among the four temples convinces me that the Irukkuv?l family built in an identifiable and consistent architectural substyle. I assume that family style was pro duced by members of one family contracting with a sin gle workshop. Differences among Irukkuv?J monuments in molding configurations and in the aediculae of the superstructures suggest that flexibility existed within this family style. That flexibility was, however, limited. No two Irukkuv?l temples are identical, and yet their differences are subtle. Either their favored workshop offered just a few design options for architectural ornament and ground plan, or Irukkuv?l patrons selected narrowly from the available range of options. In one way or another, the Irukkuv?js seem to have made choices that restricted the architectural variations among their temples. The design elements that constitute an Irukkuv?l fami ly style are not, however, unique to monuments built by that family. Several temples that cannot be traced to Irukkuv?J sponsorship also display those elements. Apparently, the workshop the Irukkuv?js patronized also served other patrons, or other workshops used the same sastras that the Irukkuv?js' workshop used. Patronage may have helped to shape style, but style does not conversely reveal a particular family's patronage. Keeping this in mind, I have limited my sample of Irukkuv?l monuments to those for which inscriptions confirm the involvement of Irukkuv?J family members in the temple's construction. Fig. 24. South wall, ardhamandapa, MucukundesVara temple, Kocjumb?l?r. Ardhamandapa joins the vim?na at the photos left margin. Structure at the right margin is a later addition. 41</page><page sequence="17">Fig. 25. Ground-level walls of the Kadambavanesvara temple, ?rumb?r. Built by Irung?lan Gunavan Apar?jitan in 935. Seen from the north. The vim?na is to the right and the ardhamandapa to the left. I have not attributed further temples to that group on the basis of style.41 The Kadambavanesvara temple in Erumb?r (Fig. 25), for example, displays several of the more distinctive features I have associated with the Irukkuv?l family style, but one of its inscriptions clearly assigns sponsorship of the temples construction not to one of Na?gai's natal kin but to an Irung?lan Gunavan Apar?jitan.42 Like the vim?na walls at Tiruccendurai, the M?vark?yil, and the Mucukundesvara, each vim?na wall at Erumb?r has a single, central project ing facet that is pierced by one niche. Slender figurai carv ings occupy these niches, and the one in the west is an unusual form of Siva (Fig. 26), recalling the frequency and unconventionality with which the Irukkuvels' temples deploy Siva figures in niches.The ardhamandapa at Erum b?r does not run the full width of the vim?na, and the juncture between them has no niches or indentations.The basement moldings are the same crisp forms found at the Mucukundesvara (Figs. 7C, 24) and probably at Andanall?r.43 The Odanesvara temple at Tirucc?tturai and the Ghritasth?nesvara temple at Tillaisth?nam (Figs. 27, 28) resemble Irukkuv?l structures even more closely than the Erumb?r temple does, though neither is likely to have been constructed under Irukkuv?l sponsorship. Both lie well to the east of K?n?du, the Irukkuvels' region. Neither temple bears any inscription specifically mentioning tem ple construction. Inscriptions about other donations at the temple in Tirucc?tturai mention no Irukkuv?l and they do mention a rival family, the Muttaraiyars.44 Inscriptions at Tillaisth?nam mention Irukkuvels, but they also mention Coks, P?ndyas, and individuals outside these families.45 Fig. 26.

Superstructure and vim?na walls of OdanesVara temple, Tirucc?tturai, seen from the northwest. And yet these temples' most noticeable features closely resemble features at Irukkuv?l temples. The exterior walls of their ardhamancjapas have no niches and join wider vim?nas without niches or further indentations. Their superstructures each have two tiers and a square, flaring capstone, and the unusual attached half-columns that also flank the wide aediculae on the central shrine of the M?vark?yil (Figs. 10, 2Q, 30) A6 The basement moldings at Tillaisth?nam are strikingly similar to those at the MucukundesVara (Figs. 7C, 7F), and the moldings at Tirucc?tturai conflate the crisp moldings of the MucukundesVara with the lotus-petal molding of the M?vark?yil (Fig. 7E). Each vim?na wall at Tirucc?tturai has a single, central projection, as do the M?vark?yil, the MucukundesVara, and Na?gai's temple. Perhaps the most striking features at Tirucc?tturai and Tillaisth?nam are the elegant sculptures of Siva that stand in most of their vim?na niches (Fig. 31) A7 These recall the unusual preference at the M?vark?yil and Tiruccendurai for slender, standing figures of Siva in all three vim?na niches.48 The hands of these multilimbed figures all hold the same objects or make the same gestures.49 These fig ures further recall the Siva figures at Irukkuv?l temples in their lithe proportions and in the easy, fluid motion their postures imply. All look to be stepping quietly forward from their niches, their weight still resting on the proper 43</page><page sequence="19">Fig. 28.

The head tilts gently and gazes down toward the viewers' level. The sculptures' pliant, relaxed forms encourage viewers to read them as approachable, living bodies. They seem divinely beautiful men stepping into these particular, local places, ready to speak to the people who stand before them. Hymns composed shortly before these stone tem ples were built sing of Siva appearing miraculously in Tillaisth?nam, Tirucc?tturai, and other villages of the K?v?ri delta.50 Visitors to these temples in the tenth cen tury would have understood these as places where the god's feet had touched the earth. Life-sized sculptures of Siva that seem to step out of the temple wall may have evoked for these viewers the living deity who had walked in their own towns, and could walk there again any day. NA?GAI'S TEMPLE AND THE EARLY COLAS I can find no trace of Cola influence on Na?gai's temple, not surprisingly, since Cola kings may have sponsored construction of no more than two temples before the late tenth century.51 Before that the only Colas who funded temple architecture substantially were other women who had married into the family. The most prodigious of these was Sembiyan Mah?devi, the widow of C?k king Gancjar?ditya. Between circa 970 and the early eleventh century she sponsored stone temples at K?nerir?japuram, 44</page><page sequence="20">Fig. 29. Attached half-columns between the top and bottom tiers of the superstructure, and flanking the central aedicula (detail), OdanesVara temple, Tirucc?tturai. Fig. 30.

The temples built by these two Cola queens look quite different from each other. Sembiyan Mah?devi's temples have three full nich es cut into each of the ardhamancjapa walls (Fig. 32); the ardhamancjapa runs the full width of the vim?na, and deep wall indentations mark their juncture; the vim?na walls display many facetting patterns. Her temples employ three different combinations of basement moldings, none of which include the twisting leonine figures found at Na?gai's temple. The iconographie programs at Sembiyan 45</page><page sequence="21">Fig. 31. Figure of Siva. Central niche of the west wall of the vim?na, OdanesVara temple, Tirucc?tturai. Fig. 32. Niches housing (from left) Agastya, Siva Natar?ja, and Gane?a. South wall of the ardhamandapa seen from the west, Apatsah?yesVara temple, ?cjuturai. Indentation at juncture with the vim?na is visible at far left. Mah?devi's temples set Brahma in the north niche of the vim?na and Siva Li?godbhava in the west (Fig. 33). Note the firmer stance, more powerful shoulders, tighter mod elling, and harder surfaces that distinguish this figure from the lilting, soft, and slender forms at Tiruccendurai and the M?vark?yil (Figs. 6,14-18). Might the differences between Na?gai's and Sembiyan Mah?devi's temples reflect the architectural style of each woman's natal family? No surviving buildings have yet been associated with other members of Sembiyan Mah?devi's natal family, the Malavaraiyars, but their other practices do resemble those of the Irukkuv?js, albeit on a less exalted scale. Sembiyan Mah?devi's father is recog nized as chief of Malan?cju, a subregion north of the K?v?ri;53 the family intermarried at least twice with the Colas, though always in the subordinate position of giving brides (Fig. 3). The Malavaraiyars seem to me a more plau sible source of inspiration than the Cola kings for Sembiyan Mah?devi's patronage practices and architectur al preferences. Another Cola bride built a temple closer to Na?gai's in time and form. This was K?kkil?n, the mother of R?j?ditya Cola who was to become king in 947.54 Before 935 she built the TiruttoncJ?sVara temple atTirun?manall?r (Fig. 34),55 which shares with Na?gai's temple the flared, square capstone, the single projecting facet on each vim?na wall, the arrangement of pilasters, the absence of niches on the entry hall, and the combination of leonine and floriated basement moldings (Fig. 7G).s6 The Tirun?manall?r temple also retains in its southern vim?na niche a figure of Siva standing with his body tilted and leaning calmly on the neck of his bull (Fig. 35), sharing thus the iconography of the similarly placed figure at Tiruccendurai. This figure at Tirun?manall?r seems origi 46</page><page sequence="22">nal to the tenth century in its slender proportions and the ease of its implied motion. Na?gai's and K?kkil?n's temples are also different in important ways. The tower at Tirun?manall?r has one tier, not two; the leonine forms of the basement moldings there are more widely spaced than those at Tiruccendurai; and tall figures of women dancing depend from the cornices at a dramatic angle (Fig. 36). Nothing comparable to these dancing figures exists at Tiruccendurai or at other Irukkuv?J temples. Among temples associated with the Colas, the temple at Tirun?manall?r is the only one I have found that looks at all like Na?gai's, but I still do not take this as evidence that Na?gai's temple reflects a Cola family style. In the first place, the differences between these two temples are sub stantial. In the second place, the temple at Tirun?manall?r was built not by a Cola king but by a woman who, like Na?gai, had married into that family. K?kkil?n too may have been building in a tradition brought from her natal family. Her later gifts suggest that her natal home was the subregion just north of the K?v?ri and of the Irukkuvels' K?n?du, and thus very near Tiruccendurai (Fig. 2).57 Just by crossing the river, K?kkil?n, her natal kin, and artisans they hired could have seen Na?gai's temple and been inspired to replicate loosely its more striking features. This kind of tangential exposure to the Tiruccendurai temple could account for the incomplete resemblances between the temples these two queens built. CONCLUSIONS I suggest that, within the extended Cola family, patronage of temple architecture was primarily female: women mar Fig. 33.

Cola men had little impact on temple construction during the tenth century, even when the sponsors were their wives. It seems to have been women from other families who brought temple con struction to the Cobs, perpetuating the practice until Cola kings took it up in the eleventh century, when their finances permitted and as a strategy for constructing an imperial mode of kingship. The role Cola wives played in catalyzing this practice among their affines suggests that their various natal families had, like the Irukkuv?js, family styles of architecture and building traditions older than the Colas'. The consistency of style among Irukkuv?J monuments is noteworthy because it is the strongest evidence to date of patronage having an impact on the form of temples in the K?v?ri region. The Irukkuv?l family style may have derived from that family's consistent patronage of a single workshop. That Tirucc?tturai and Tillaisth?nam were not built by Irukkuvels, but demonstrate many of their tern pies' more striking features, convinces me that architectur al styles were common to certain families but not unique to them. More likely, the specific formal options I have associated with the Irukkuvels derived from a workshop of artisans that could work for various patrons. Many such workshops must have been active during the tenth centu ry. The diversity of their styles and the diffusion of temple construction among many families probably account for the multiple forms and geographic dispersion of stone temples during the ninth and tenth centuries. K?kk??n's and Sembiyan Mah?devi's patronage of tem ple construction provides specific evidence that Na?gai was not the only woman who had the agency to finance such projects during the tenth century. Many prominent women may have presented themselves through their natal identity by sponsoring construction of temples in their natal family's style. Many may have celebrated their natal identities by donating publicly to their temples after their 48</page><page sequence="24">marriages, as Na?gai did emphatically with an inscription that defines her first through her natal relatives and then through her marital associations.58 One reason to see Na?gai's situation as typical is the prevalence of cross-cousin marriage among the powerful families of the K?v?r? region. The presence of other women from the same natal home, and the C?ks' deliber ate perpetuation of close contacts with their natal families, would have kept these wives' sense of natal identity strong. The frequency of cross-cousin marriage among the Colas is likely to have made the agency that Na?gai demon strates fairly common among other Cola wives.59 The cases of K?kkil?n and Sembiyan Mah?devi also demonstrate that even marriage to a Cola did not impede their agency as architectural patrons. Both women built their temples after they were married. The chronology of inscriptions implies that Na?gai may have built before she married, but apparently C?k practice would not have for bidden her from building afterward. The Irukkuv?l building tradition seems to have been as open to women as to men, and in this regard too it may not have been unusual. Na?gai appears to have enjoyed the same degree of flexibility as her male relatives in choosing among design options available through local workshops and their sastras. Though gendered within the C?k family context before the eleventh century, temple building seems to have been ungendered in a family of more established building traditions. That Na?gai as a married woman could present herself primarily as an offspring of the Irukkuv?l family might seem radical for the freedom from her husband it seems so publicly to imply. Her agency in temple construction could suggest to modern readers her defiant appropriation of empowering male prerogative. And yet Na?gai's patron age of art may have had as little to do with her sex as it did with C?k men: she is likely to have understood such building as a family practice rather than a gendered act. Natal family identity probably figured larger than gender identity in Na?gai's perceptions of herself as a temple donor, a useful reminder of the profound extent to which culture can shape the connotations of gender, family, and individuality.

Scholars have already demonstrated that some paradigms of twen tieth-century feminist art history need adjustment before they work for ancient South Asia. See Joanna Williams, "Construction of Gender in the Paintings and Graffiti of Sigiriya," andVidya Dehejia,"Spectatorship and Representation," both in Representing the Body: Gender Issues in Indian Art, ed.Vidya Dehejia (New Delhi: Kali for Women, 1997), pp. 1-21, 56-67. They note that much South Asian art was designed to receive and return the gazes of laywomen, celibates of both sexes, and amorous couples, and not to function exclusively as passive receptors of a sexually acquisitive male gaze. Note that Linda Nochlin too had urged in 1971 that feminist art history go beyond the simple study of women to question "the very way of formulating the crucial questions of the discipline as a whole": "Why have there been no great women artists?," in Women, Art, and Power and Other Essays (New York: Harper and Row, 1988), p. 146. Her advice is still appropriate and it applies more widely than she may have realized. 8.

Nilakantha Sastri's vision of Cola kings as powerful executives administering an efficient bureaucracy and controlling the construction of temples: K. A. Nilakantha Sastri, The Colas (Madras: Univ. of Madras, 1955). Burton Stein demonstrates that temples, justice, and taxation were administered at the locality (n?du) level rather than by Cola kings: Peasant State and Society in Medieval South India (Delhi: Oxford Univ.

The most ambitious attempts at analysis are Barrett, Early Cola Architecture; and Hoekveld-Meijer, Koyils. Barrett, however, does not discuss the charts summarizing his results and Hoekveld-Meijer s com puter analysis is hampered by reliance on construction dates based on the flawed assumptions of S. R.

James Heitzman finds that the Colas did not begin to impose centralized systems of taxation and arbitration on the K?v?ri region until ca. 1000: "State formation in South India, 850?1280," Indian Economic and Social History Review, vol. 24, no. 1 (1987), pp. 35-61. Appadurai notes that local people managed the temple's daily affairs: Arjun Appadurai, Worship and Conflict Under Colonial Rule: A South Indian Case (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1981). 11. Several scholars have begun to explore the possibility that tem ples built by members of the Irukkuv?J, Muttaraiyar, and Paluv?ftaraiyar families display distinctive family substyles. On the Paluv?ftaraiyars, see Blandine LeGrand, KxlaiyUr Melappaluvur: ?panouissement d'une dynastie princi?re en Inde, ? l'?poque Cola, Editions Recherche sur les civilizations, m?moire no. 71 (Paris: ADPF, 1987). On the Muttaraiyars, see K. G. Krishnan, "Muttaraiyar," Damilica, no. 1 (1970), pp. 68-73. The Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture assigns separate chapters to each prominent family: vol. 1.1, chapters 5-7, 9-10. See also M. A. Dhaky, "Cola Sculpture," pp. 263-89; and K. V. Soundara Rajan, "Early P?ndya, Muttarayar and Irukkvel Architecture," in Studies in Indian Temple Architecture, ed. Pramod Chandra (New Delhi: American Institute of Indian Studies, 1975), pp. 240?300. On elusive and incon sistent criteria in these studies, see Hoekveld-Meijer, Koyils, pp. 48-57. These studies include monuments that have no inscriptions naming their patrons, along with monuments that do have inscriptions docu menting patronage. The data are in that way not differentiated. I study family styles in the early K?v?ri area only through temples that bear inscriptions explicitly identifying patrons of construction: "Muttaraiyar, Irukkuv?l, Paluv?ftaraiyar and the C?ks of Ta?jav?r," for Art and Architecture in India, ed. M. A. Dhaky, in History of Indian Science, Philosophy, and Culture (Indian Council of Philosophical Research, forthcoming). 12. I derive this from visiting many temples of the region and from studying the plates in Barrett, Early Cola Architecture; and The Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture, vol. 1.1; and from independent analysis of the charts in Barrett and in Hoekveld-Meijer, Koyils. Hoekveld-Meijer's brave attempt at collecting statistical evidence on individual architectural features is hampered by confusions about con struction dates and inadequately published visual data. 13. The text reads: "Hail! Prosperity! In the third year of [the reign of] king Parak?sarivarman, P?di Adichchapid?riy?r, daughter of Tennavan Ilang?v?l?r [and] queen of Arikulak?sariyar [who was] the son of S?la-Perumanadigal, gave, in this year, sixty kala?ju of [pure gold called] tulaippon [weighed] by the [standard] stone ved?lvidugu, as capital [from which] sacred offerings at the holy shrine [have to be pro vided] to the lord of the stone temple constructed by her at Tiruchchendurai, [a hamlet] of Is?namangala which was a brah madeya."

On Bh?ti's con temporaneity with Pallava kings, see Epigraphia Indica (hereafter El), vol. 32, pp. 99-102, #10. 16. I have synthesized this genealogy from Thomas R. Trautmann, Dravidian Kinship (New York: Cambridge Univ. Pr., 1981); Subrahmanya Aiyar, Historical Sketches; K. A. Nilakantha Sastri, "The 50</page><page sequence="26">Kodumbalur Inscription ofVikrama-K?sar?,"Journal of Oriental Research, vol. 7, no. i (1933), pp. 1?10; and various inscriptions. In addition to the Tiruccendurai inscriptions and the long inscription by Bh?ti Vikramak?sari at Kodumb?j?r, several other inscriptions demonstrate that Bh?ti Par?ntakan was Bh?ti Vikramak?sari's son by the queen Karrali and that Bh?ti Par?ntakan in turn fathered Mahim?laya Irukkuv?l: SU, vol. 19, pp. vii-xi; SII, vol. 8, #233, #240, #601, #616, #627, #657, #668. Note that Trautmann, Subrahmanya Aiyar, and Sastri disagree on which Cola was the brother of Bh?ti Vikramak?sari's wife, Varagun?, and on whom Par?ntakan Siriyav?l?r married. S. R. Balasubrahmanyam resists identifying Varagun?, the wife of Bh?ti Vikramak?sari (5//, vol. 23, pp. 101-2, #129; and SII, vol. 3, #113), with Varagun?, the sister of a Cola king (El, vol. 20, pp. 47-54, #3-C; SII, vol. 13, pp. 128-29, #240): "A note on the Bh?ti Vikramak?sari of Kodumbalur," Journal of Indian Museums, vols. 17-20 (1961-1964), pp. 11-25; ana&gt; Early Chola Temples, pp. 106-31. K.V Soundara Rajan s genealogy ("Irrukuv?ls (sic) of Kodumbalur," in The Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture, vol. 1.1, p. 198) is unique and inaccurate in identifying Na?gai Varagun? as a sister of ?ditya I and a wife of Bh?ti Par?ntakan, rather than as the wife of Bh?ti Vikramak?sari. Three of the five women Subrahmanya Aiyar, p. 204, names as Bh?ti Par?ntakan's wives have names similar to Na?gai Varagun??Varagunan?tti the daughter of a Muttaraiyar, Na?gai Nandi, and C?lapperundeviy?r alias Peruna?gai?perhaps the source of the confusion. Subrahmanya Aiyar identifies C?lapperundeviy?r alias Peruna?gai, a wife of Bh?ti Par?ntakan, as a daughter of Aditya I. 17. Despite textual prohibitions against it. Thomas R.

In the second year of king Parak?sarivarman, I, P?di Adittapicl ?ri, gave with libation of water these two garden [lands] as per the same terms under which I purchased [them, viz.,] the garden [land] which I purchased for 35 kala?ju of gold in the second year [of the king's reign] from K?chchuvan [K?syapa] Tattan?r?yananand the garden [land] purchased from P?rad?yan [Bh?radv?ja?] I s?na M?ran, to the lord of the stone temple at Tiruchchendurai for maintaining festivals [tiruvil?ppuram] of the lord of Tiruchchendurai on [the day of] the solar eclipse, [stipulating that] the maintenance of the [said] festivals of the lord of [this] stone temple constructed by me P?di Adittapid?ri [should be met only] from the produce of the [said] gardens. [The assembly of] all M?h?svaras shall protect this [charity]." SII, vol. 3, pt. 3, pp. 262-63, #126. Another inscription has her making a gift to the temple as early as 893, but Barrett suggests plausibly she was then giving to a brick tem ple that her later donations would convert to stone: SII, vol. 8, pp. 321-22, #629; Barrett, Early Cola Architecture, p. 52. 20. SII, vol. 3, pt. 3, pp. 228-29, #96 (see above, n. 13). 21. Her wealth was great enough to permit her to give many other gifts to the temple as well: 57/, vol. 8, pp. 307, 319-20, #601, #624. 22.

A Sanskrit inscription on the south wall of the M?vark?yil's cen tral shrine traces this king's genealogy and states that he erected the three shrines of this temple in the names of his two wives and himself. The text of this inscription is published in SII, vol. 23, pp. 101-2, #129; and by Sastri, "The Kodumbalur Inscription." See also K.V.

Descriptions of this temple's form are published in:Venkataranga Raju, "Cola temples in Pudukkottai," Journal of the Indian Society of Oriental Art, vol. 5 (1937), p. 80-83; Soundara Rajan, in The Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture, vol. 1.1, pp. 202-8; Barrett, Early Cola Architecture, p. 86; Balasubrahmanyam, Early Chola Temples, pp. 131-32; Hoekveld-Meijer, Koyils, pp. 291-92. 27. The Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture, vol. 1.1, fig. 94, indi cates that this layer, which it calls Padmapuskala, is also part of Tiruccendurai's moldings and renders it in dotted lines to indicate its submersion in the ground. The only difference from the M?vark?yil is that Tiruccendurai's lotus molding rests on two rectangular platforms; the M?vark?yil's rests on one. 28. For ground plans of the central temple at Kocjumb?l?r and the Tiruccendurai temple, see The Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture, vol. 1.1, figs. 90, 95. 29. Temples with single niches in the ardhamancjapa walls exist at GancJ ar?dittam, K?vil?di, Tiruverumb?r, and Olagapuram. Temples at Tiruvar?r, Sembiyan Mah?devi village, and ?n?ng?r have three niches in each of their ardhamandapa walls. Those with two niches can be found at Pu?jai and Kumbakonam. These data are tabulated in Barrett, Early Cola Architecture, pp. 134-37. 30. Soundara Rajan labels this as Daksin?m?rti, a teaching form of Siva, without discussion of the figure's standing posture: The Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture, vol. 1.1, p. 208. Soundara Rajan s chart of the program conflicts on several points with a chart by Balasubrahmanyam (Early Chola Temples, p. 132). He also suggests that the triple shrines represent Siva's Aghora, Tatpurusa and V?madeva aspects: Soundara Rajan,"Inscription at M?var-koil,"p. 233.The icono graphie program of the M?vark?yil deserves a full-length study of its own. 31. The bull is commonly found with Ardhan?ri, but he is not a standard feature of Gang?dhara images in the south: see Marguerite E. 51</page><page sequence="27">Adiceam,"Les Images de Siva dans l'Inde du Sud,VI.?Ardh?narisvara," Arts Asiatiques, vol. 13 (1966), pp. 143-72; and Adiceam, "Les Images de Siva dans l'Inde du Sud, XV?Gang?dharam?rti," Arts Asiatiques, vol. 32 (1976), pp. 99-138. 32. Soundara Rajan identifies these figures as Bhiks?tana, another mendicant form of Siva: The Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture, vol. 1.1, p. 208. Adiceam notes the two have similar iconographies and that some artists' manuals did not distinguish between them: "Les Images de Siva dans l'Inde du Sud, III et IV?Bhiks?tanam?rti et Kank?lam?rti," Arts Asiatiques, vol. 12 (1965), pp. 83-112.1 suspect that this temple's designers intended the figures to evoke Kank?la in partic ular because they carved a jumping deer at Siva's left and a dwarf at his right, features that Adiceam notes were more relevant to Kank?la's story; and because signs relevant to the more erotic stories of Bhiks?tana, such as snakes and disrobing women, are absent on the Kodumbalur figures. 33. The inscription that tells of his building the M?vark?yil also tells that he gave a large monastery (matha) with many gifts and endow ments to the chief of the K?l?mukhas and his fifty followers: Sastri, "The Kocjumb?l?r inscription," verses 11-12. My thanks to Leslie Orr for suggesting a potential link between Bh?ti's K?l?mukha support and the temples' unusual programs. 34.

Kosambi (New Delhi: People's Publishing House, 1974), pp. 190-201. 35. The niche measures 23 x 48 x 11 inches.The Ardhan?ri figure, from which the legs have broken away, is 16 x 29 x 9 inches. Credit goes to Lorraine Kaimal for spotting this figure among the undergrowth and stone fragments of the temple yard. 36. For example, the Tiruttond?svara temple at Uraiy?r, the V?dagirisvara temple at Tiruv?dikkudi, the N?gesvara temple at Kumbakonam, and the Saptaris?svara temple at L?lgucji. 37. Two inscriptions on the Andanall?r temple document Bh?ti Par?ntakan's responsibility for building it: SII, vol. 3, pt. 3, p. 285, #139; and 51/, vol. 8, p. 337, #668. Other inscriptions there note that his con sorts and his sister Na?gai made various donations to the temple: 5//, vol. 8, p. 334-37, #657, #665, #666. Four inscriptions found in the mid twentieth century on the base of the Mucukundesvara state that Mahim?laya Irukkuv?l built it, endowed it with lands, and appointed priests: A Manual of the Pudukkottai State, ed. K. R.Venkatarama Ayyar, vol. 2.2, 2nd rev. ed. (Pudukkottai: Sri Brihadamba State Press, I938-I944),p. 1035. 38. Descriptions of the Mucukundesvara's architectural forms are published in: The Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture, vol. 1.1, pp. 212-13; Barrett, Early Cola Architecture, p. 74; Raju, "Cola temples," pp. 83-84; Hoekveld-Meijer, Koyils, p. 291; Balasubrahmanyam, Early Chola Temples, pp. 27-28. On the forms of the temple at Andanall?r, see Barrett, Early Cola Architecture, pp. 71-72; Balasubrahmanyam, Early Chola Temples, pp. 15-17. 39. The lower basement moldings at Andanall?r are now embedded in the cement of the courtyard, but from the moldings still visible, I infer the buried layers to have the same shapes as those of the Mucukundesvara. 40. The Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture, vol. 1.1, p. 201, labels this configuration P?dabandha. 41. Some studies have added monuments to the category of Irukkuv?l style based on their formal resemblance to inscribed monu ments. Hoekveld-Meijer's is among them; her finding that there is no consistent Irukkuv?l family style (Koyils, p. 374) is therefore problemat ic. 42. In the year 935.The entire inscription is translated into English by S. R. Balasubrahmanyam, "Three dated Early Chola Sculptures of Erumbur," Lalit Kal?, no. 13 (1939), pp. 16-21; the relevant portion is published in transliterated Tamil by S. R. Balasubrahmanyam and Venkataranga Raju, "Par?ntaka Cola's Erumb?r Temple," Journal of the Indian Society of Oriental Art, vol. 7 (1939), pp. 113-15. This patron's name may recall "Irungov?l," a variant of Irukkuv?l, but_it is even closer to Irung?la-P?di, the name of the region just west of Erumb?r: see Subbarayalu, Political Geography, p. 76, map 12.This part of the patron's name probably indicates his home town, as names of this period frequently did. 43. Further descriptions of this temple are published in Balasubrahmanyam, Early Chola Temples, pp. 67-70; The Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture, vol. 1.1, p. 172; Barrett, Early Cola Architecture, pp. 75-76. 44. 5//, vol. 5, p. 246, #618, refers to Muttaraiyars. Another inscrip tion mentions a woman named Nandi Pa?gi who patronized con struction of the Apatsahayesvara temple at Tiruppalanam: see 5//, vol. 13, pp. 127-28, #237, #239. For other inscriptions from this site, see 5//, vol. 5, pp. 243-46, #610-621; 5//, vol. 13, pp. 9-186, #22, #78, #103, #126, #239, #252, #280, #281, #305, #316, #349-351. 45. They also indicate that the local assembly took responsibility for constructing the stone temple by redirecting a patron's gift: V. Rangacharya, Topographical list of the inscriptions of the Madras Presidency (collected until 1915), vol. 2, p. 1415, #1421. For other inscriptions at this temple, see 5//, vol. 3, pp. 221-22, #89; 5//, vol. 13, pp. 21-144, #47, #48, #214, #233, #247, #248, #273; 5//, vol. 5, pp. 233-43, #580-611. Note also that some donors gave to both Tirucc?tturai and Tillaisth?nam. 46. Devakunjari notes these also at N?rtthamalai, Tirupputt?r, Ucjaiy?rgudi, and Tribhuvanam: D. Devakunjari, "The Mahadeva tem ple of Tillaisth?nam," Damilica, vol. 2, no. 3 (1973), pp. 42-49. For other published descriptions of this temple, see: Balasubrahmanyam, Early Chola Art, pp. 160-64; Barrett, Early Cola Architecture, pp. 56-57; The Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture, vol. 1.1, pp. 143?44. On Tirucc?tturai, see Balasubrahmanyam, Early Chola Art, pp. 157-60; Barrett, Early Cola Architecture, pp. 55, 59; The Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture, vol. i.i,pp. 153?57. 47. The south niche at Tirucc?tturai holds a later, seated figure of Daksin?m?rti. Original carvings of Siva still stand in the other niches of these temples. 48. Hoekveld-Meijer, Koyils, pp. 374?75, sees the use of Siva images in all three vim?na niches an an important developmental characteris tic among the sapta sthana ksetra, the seven temples around which the chief of Siva's dwarves, Nandidev?r, is understood to have processed after his wedding ceremony. She proposes that these seven temples were a kind of experimental ground for the architects building temples for Aditya I Cola and thus forging the "early Cola style": Hoekveld Meijer, Koyils, pp. 297-98. Hoekveld-Meijer and Balasubrahmanyam understand Tillaisth?nam and Tirucc?tturai as two of these sapta sthana, along with Tiruvaiy?ru, Tiruppalanam,Tiruv?dikkudi,Tirupp?ndurutti, and Tirukkandiy?r, but Devakunjari, "The Mahadeva temple," p. 43, indicates that the list can vary. On this myth of Nandidev?r, see Balasubrahmanyam, Early Chola Art, p. 152, n. On distinguishing the anthropomorphic Nandin from Siva's bull, Nandi, see Gouriswar Bhattacharya, "Nandin and Vrsabha," in Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl?ndischen Gesellschaft (Stuttgart: Franz Steiner, 1977), pp. 1545-67. 49. Hands have broken off some of these figures, but those that sur vive hold an aksam?l? (string of beads sacred to Siva) in the upper left hand and a deer in the upper right; the lower left is in abhayamudr? and the lower right proffers a fruit or rests on the hip. Devakunjari, "The Mahadeva temple," pp. 44-45, points out the uniformity among Tillaisth?nam's figures, though he identifies the lower right hand ges ture as varada. 50. The bhakti hymns of the Tevaram locate Siva in specific places across Tamilnadu. Six hymns sing of him at Tirucc?tturai (as C?rrutturai) and another six at Tillaisth?nam (as Neytt?nam): Indira 52</page><page sequence="28">Viswanathan Petersen, Poems to Siva: The Hymns of the Tamil Saints (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Pr., 1989), pp. 12-13, apps. A, C. See also George Spencer, "The Sacred Geography of the Tamil Shaivite Hymns," Numen, vol. 17, no. 3 (1970), pp. 232-44. 51. I argue this case in "Early C?k Kings," pp. 56?58. One of these two Cola temples was the ?dityesvara atTondaiman?d, far to the north, from which only the basement moldings now survive: see Barrett, Early Cola Architecture, pi. 24. The other was the G?mukt?svara temple at Tiruvaduturai, which Par?ntaka I Cola helped to build. That temple and Na?gai's are very different in the tone and details of their architec ture. Na?gai's temple is small, its atmosphere intimate, its ornament del icate and restrained. The Tiruvaduturai temple is massive and complex. Its basement moldings are a tall, elaborate combination of rectilinear rather than organic shapes; variously shaped pilasters and multiple pro jections stud the main walls; six niches pierce the walls of the ard hamandapa; figures in those niches are heavy and somber. The icono graphie program includes Siva in only two niches: seated as Daksin?m?rti in the south, and as Li?godbhava in the west. If Tiruvaduturai represents the architectural style of early Cola kings, Na?gai's temple had little to do with that style. For views of the Tiruvaduturai temple, see Barrett, Early Cola Architecture, pp. 131-37, pis. 25-27; and Kaimal, "Early Cola Kings," figs. 44-49. 52. Though she is likely to have built many more, these six are among her surest commissions: all bear inscriptions stating that Sembiyan Mah?devi built them, and all display the tenth-century phas es of their construction essentially intact. On her temples and their inscriptions, see Venkataraman, Temple Art, pp. 16-46; Barrett, Early Cola Architecture, pp. 90? in, 128?30; The Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture, vol. 1.1, pp. 181-93, pis. 216-229. 53.

On Malan?du as the tenth-century home of the Malavaraiyar over whom Sembiyan's father was a chief, see Subrahmanya Aiyar, Historical Sketches, pp. 47?48. 54. She is probably also the same K?kkil?n who appears in the inscriptional record as Kil?n?digal of Tanj?v?r when her maid gave to the temple at Tirucc?tturai (5//, vol. 19, p. 76, #150).Two other inscrip tions may refer to the same K?kkil?n, one at Tiruvidaimarud?r that links her somehow (text is missing) with a queen Kundavai, a popular name for Cola queens: 5//, vol. 23, pp. 178?79, #23; and one at V?daranyam that records a gift by the children of K?kkil?n's maid: 5//, vol. 17, #530. Many thanks to Leslie Orr for finding these inscriptions for me in her database of Cola inscriptions. 55.I am convinced by Hultzsch's and Mahalingam's reading, which takes K?kkil?n (K?kkil?natikal) as the subject of the verb "to have built" in inscription #335 of 1902: E. Hultzsch, "Six Inscriptions at Tirun?manall?r," EI, vol. 7 (1902-3), pp. 133-34, #io.A; T. V Mahalingam, A Topographical List of Inscriptions in the Tamil Nadu and Kerala States, vol. 2: South Arcot District, p. 388, #1664.The main intent of the inscription is to announce a gift in 935 from one of K?kkil?n's maids, a donor especially likely to give to her mistress' temple and to mention her mistress' generosity in the inscription. 56. For published descriptions of this temple, see The Encyclopaedia of Indian Temple Architecture, vol. 1.1, p. 146; Balasubrahmanyam, Early Chola Temples, pp. 64-67. 57. She is associated with Malan?du through a gift she made to the temple at L?lgudi through an agent from that region: 5//, vol. 19, pp. 214?15, #408, and "Introduction," p. vi.This inscription also identifies her as daughter of a C?ra king, and the C?ras were present in the Ko?gu region directly west of Makn?du: see Subrahmanya Aiyar, Historical Sketches, pp. 43-44. The location of her temple links her to Mil?du, however, a different sub region over twenty-five miles northwest of K?n?du and the K?v?ri delta. Balambal,"Great Women," p. 72, seems to confuse Malan?du with Mil?du when he identifies Sembiyan Mah?devi's father as a chief of the Tirukk?yil?r area. The same confusion is apparent in Rangacharya, Topographical list, vol. 1, p. 233, #902. On E. Hultzsch's confusion of Mil?du with Malan?du, see Subbarayalu, Political Geography, pp. 75-76. On the mapping of these ancient regions, see Subbarayalu, Political Geography, pp. 72-77, map 12. 58. For her inscription, see above, n. 13. 59. For example, the Cola princess Kundavai, elder sister of R?jar?ja I Cola, continued to donate to Cola projects and even issued records from the C?k palace at Pakiy?ru after her marriage to Valkvaraiya Vandiyadev?r: see Spencer, "When Queens Bore Gifts," p. 367. 53</page></plain_text>
