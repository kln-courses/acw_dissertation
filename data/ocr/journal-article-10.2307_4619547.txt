<plain_text><page sequence="1">New Books The Human Psyche By John C. Eccles Springer International, 1980, xv+ 278 pp., US $26.00 Sir John Eccles is a distinguished neurobiologist-a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Nobel prizewinner. These are the Gifford Lectures in Natural Theology for I978-79: Eccles also gave the lectures for the previous year, under the title of The Human Mystery. He has written Facing Reality: Philosophical Adventures by a Brain Scientist (Springer, 1970) and, in friendly debate with Popper, The Self and its Brain (Springer, 1977). As the preface tells us, a dualist interactionism was developed in the last-mentioned book: the author's aim in the present work is 'to demonstrate the great explanatory power of dualist interactionism in contrast to the poverty and inadequacy of all varieties of the materialist theories of the mind' (p. vii). He hopes moreover that 'the philosophy expressed in these lectures will help to restore to human persons a belief in their spiritual nature superim- posed on their material body and brain', with which will come 'a religious illumi- nation giving hope and meaning to their ... existence...' (p. ix). That is why Eccles thinks he is serving the purpose of the Gifford Lectures as stated by Gifford: 'to promote and diffuse the study of Natural Theology in the widest sense of that term--in other words, the knowledge of God' (p. viii). My main difficulty (hereinafter referred to as D.I) is not an aprioristic ob- jection. It is that, in a crucial set of contexts, I do not know what rule Eccles is following in saying of one thing that it explains another. The crucial contexts are those in which he says that dualist interactionism, alone or in combination with some neurological fact or hypothesis, explains something that would remain un- explained without the dualist interactionism. Eccles does not, in my view, because it would not be the case that one did, provide a definition of the explanation function 'x explains y', where x can be dualist interactionism and y is a set of facts, merely by criticizing other so-called explanations of the facts and then saying that 'perforce we turn to dualist-inter- actionist explanations' (p. 21). Perforce we do not turn to them unless we see in what sense and way they explain what they are supposed to explain. A masking complication: 'interaction' has regularly meant causation in both directions, while the idea of 'causation' itself has often contained the idea of scientific explanation as a part. In such a case, dualist interactionism is a second- order explanation, which says that some physicals explain some mentals and some mentals explain some physicals. So then there is the well-known objection, which seems to me to have some substance, that such a statement as 'A is now imagining a green rose', even if somehow theory-impregnated, is not scientifically theory-impregnated in the way that it would have to be for us to call it a scientific explanation of the fact that A's neurones are X-ing and Y-ing, doing whatever it is that they are doing. Next suppose that, in partial similarity and partial contrast, interaction is still causal but causation is semantically explained without recourse to the idea of non- semantic, scientific explanation. Well, then we need to see clearly what that causation is and we are also back to my D.I: what does the two-way causation explain and in what sense of 'explain'? If, in total contrast to the first-mentioned idea of interaction, interaction is '37</page><page sequence="2">New Books not conceived as causal-and I do not know whether or not this is an implica- tion of Eccles's view that interaction can be conceived as a flow of information, not energy-then we still have D.I, we still need to know under what concept of explanation the interflow of information is supposed to explain something. There is a danger. It is this, that instead of the dualist interactionism, or the central state materialism or the panpsychism or whatever it is, being offered as a general form of explanation of such facts as that people become unconscious when etherized and when conscious usually put one foot in front of the other when they want to, the notion of 'explaining' will shift. It will shift to that of giving an answer to a 'Great Question', one of 'time's great riddles', whose status as more than a sonorous interrogative is itself in question, and whose asking takes for granted, in an unexamined life, too many things that it might have been useful to discuss. My second difficulty (D.2) is as follows. We also need to know what is meant by the talk of the interflow of information. Little need it matter, perhaps, that such as I do not know what could be meant by a flow of information between Popper's 'World 2' or the set of happenings, etc., that has as one element A's imagining a green rose on occasion O and Popper's 'World I' or the set of happenings, etc., that has as one element A's neurones X-ing and Y-ing at that time. But I find that some people, who know more than I do about 'information', do not know what could be meant by that either. What form does the information take, or if that question is inapplicable why is it inapplicable? That double-barrelled question is not dealt with by Eccles's talk, which at least certainly appears either anthropomorphic or para-mechanical or both in regard to the self-conscious mind or soul, about the soul's 'selecting' what to 'scan' among the modules of the cortex. (Bear in mind, by the way, that the soul or mind is not for Eccles a substance, just a set of experiences, etc.). Eccles de- scribes this talk of his as not a solution but an outline. Unfortunately, that quite misses the point, which is twofold. (a) The so-called 'outline', if it is anthro- pomorphic or para-mechanical, is circular or incoherent, and therefore not an 'outline' where by that we mean something further knowledge can fill in, and (b) the task today is not so much to assume that there is a question here and then express some dissatisfaction with one's best-liked answer, but rather to put it beyond doubt that there is a question here by showing that there is an answer. That's not because of what we know, and because we allegedly know that 'where there is no answer there is also no question'. It's because of what we do not know, and because we do not know that there is a question here. Since the 'theory' is, here, said to be stated by Popper in Popper and Eccles, The Self and its Brain, I have turned to that work in the hope that the theory is not only stated but also clarified there. I do not find that it is. Dialogue XII, to which Eccles refers us, is of very limited relevance. Popper's sections io and 48-50 are relevant, though Popper does not talk about 'information'. Surprisingly perhaps, I find no help at all, not a bit, there with D.i above, or with the question as to the form causation takes in the interaction. I want to say something about the picture Eccles paints of the recent and current philosophical situation. I do not want to make points that are merely professionalist, about the likely reactions of these and those friends and coll- 138</page><page sequence="3">New Books eagues to some of the descriptions like 'materialist' or 'disciple of Ryle' that Eccles applies to them. I find even more interesting a certain way in which Eccles's picture does, largely, coincide with a picture painted or printed by many members of the philosophy departments. The perception corresponding to that picture is like the headless woman illusion in that something is left out. What is left out is a familiar, largely Wittgensteinian, general sceptical and methodo- logical 'Phil. Crit.'. The difference from the headless woman illusion is that bits of the 'Phil, Crit.' are perceived, though never as that. They are perceived as behaviourism or materialism or logical positivism or idealism or vitalism; which they may here and there incidentally happen to be, even if that is the least im- portant thing about them. Or as linguistic preliminaries, which if that means preliminaries to the re-asking of the same old questions they are not necessarily. Or as contributions to 'The Philosophy of' X, Y or Z; which they must invariably and tautologically be, since the profession has a rule to assign all criticism of the Philosophy of A, however radical and formal and procedural, to the Philosophy of A (same A). This rule at best gives the work of general criticism a curious ap- pearance of fragmentation, and at worst produces total incomprehension, when the rule is simultaneously followed and forgotten about by the reader of some bit of the criticism. What that bit is saying 'about perception', or whatever, then be- comes an insoluble conundrum for the reader; rather as 'Thy drasty rhyming is nat worth a tord' would puzzle one whose perceptual hypothesis was that it was an instance of lyrical balladry. The commonest perception of the work of Ryle is an excellent example of this illusion of a 'Phil. Crit.'-less philosophical universe. Not only Eccles, but also most of his opponents and allies in asking and answering the great riddle here, refer to Ryle in terms that could never lead an innocent reader to think of The Concept of Mind as merely part of a wilder oeuvre, all about Category Mistakes and other philosophical mistakes, in asking and in answering of which the alleged 'one big category mistake' of Cartesian Dualism is only one example. Ryle in Elysium has partly himself to blame for always, I do not know why, having likened anyone who wanted to write overtly on how not to philosophize and why to the centipede that did not know which foot to put forward first. Even if I am wrong in my suspicion that Eccles is unconsciously and unre- formedly leading us into an 'explanatory' activity in which whatever one likes best is likeliest-and with Popper's blessing?-there remains in my opinion quite a lot of useful advice on how not to philosophize that Eccles could profitably have taken from the above-mentioned Phil. Crit. that studies the major philosophical processes into one of which he has plunged so boldly. Like most of his opponents and allies, among whom it seems Popper must be numbered, he did not contem- plate the possibility that it existed and contained a forty-year-old, effective and derogatory, review of what he was about to publish. Whether I have shown that it did contain such a review must be left to the reader's judgment. In one respect Eccles is at any rate thoroughly enviable. He has been able to make his personal game of patience come out to the following extent. He has found a way in which, without gross extraneousness, he can combine the giving of information on things he knows about with a diatribe or two against the neobarbarism of the age. As Wittgenstein implied, it must be possible to get General Sceptical Procedural Phil. Crit. together to the same extent. I would add, '39</page><page sequence="4">New Books not from such a myopic moral and political point of view as that of Eccles. But here and now I must leave that at that. J. M.
