<plain_text><page sequence="1">22 THE USE OF AFRICAN FOLKLORE IN HISPANIC LITERATURE One of the primary contributions of Afro-Hispanic literature to the development of an indigenista or native culture in the New World is the introduction of African folklore into Caribbean and South American literature. The confluence of the two cultures - African and Hispanic - began much earlier, however, with the conquest of Christian Spain by Islamic Moors and with the expansion of the African slave trade on the Iberian Peninsula in the sixteenth century. As early as the ninth century, Ziryab, a poet who became known as the "Black Nightingale", introduced East African customs to the court of Abd al-Rahman III; he taught the Moors to eat asparagus, to use cut glass tableware and to wear their hair in a fringe.1 More distinctively African customs entered the Peninsula during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, a period of great literary productivity which paralleled the culmination of the slave trade. Spanish writers, such as Cervantes, Andres de Claramonte, Lope de Rueda and Ximenez de Enciso, allude to African songs, dances and customs in their works. Fernando Ortiz singles out, for example, the use of African theatrical forms, including the mojiganga and the bululii on the Castilian stage,2 while Jose L. Franco identifies black Guinean dances such as the gurujií, gurumbé, paracumbé, yeyé, and barambeque in seven- teenth-century Spain. 3 In analyzing African folkloric elements in Caribbean and South American literature, it is necessary, first, to identify the social and literary elements which comprise that folklore, secondly, to trace the evolution of the folk tradition while underscoring the relationship between the study of African folklore and its use in creative writing, and, finally to examine the ways in which African folklore is incorporated into Hispanic literature. According to Franco, the word folklore was first used in 1846 by Ambrosio Merton, the pseudonym of William J. Thomas, for a collection of narrations of "the manners, customs, observations, superstitions, ballads, proverbs, etc. of the past."4 It is practical, for the purposes of analysis, to group folkloric elements into three major categories: (1) customs, that is, all of the physical and tangible activities which relate to the quotidian life of the people, including the use of dance, song, food, drink, dress, games and ceremonies associated with birth, love, marriage and death; (2) beliefs or the intangible, spiritual ideas inherent in the superstitions, religious practices, mytho- logy and sacred rituals of the people; and (3) the oral tradition which includes the language and literature of the folk. The study of Afro-Cuban folklore preceded the emergence of Negrism, a Cuban literary movement, by about two decades. In 1906, the ethno-musicologist, historian and linguist, Fernando Ortiz, published Los negros brujos (The Black Sorcerors), and began a systematic and scientific examination of Afro-Cuban customs and beliefs. His</page><page sequence="2">23 major works include The Dances and the Theater of Blacks in Cuban Folklore, The Africanity of Folkloric Music in Cuba, Black Slaves, The Instruments of Afro-Cuban Musk and A Glossary of Afro-negrisms; he also analyzed the art, literature and religion of Black Cubans in a series of published articles. Undoubtedly, the work of Ortiz kindled interest in the Afro-Cuban folk tradition and provided material (themes, images, archetypes) for creative writers who began publishing their poems and short stories in the late twenties. Between 1930 and 1960 many anthropologists and sociologists continued the work of Ortiz and began collecting the songs, tales and legends of neo- African people. Ildefonso Pereda V aidés, 5 Horacio Jorge Becco,6 and José Luis Lanuza7 published anonymous work songs, tribal hymns, street songs, chants and litanies (many in the original African languages), while writers such as Romulo Lachataneré,8 Ramón Guirao, 9 and Lydia Cabrera reproduced the African folk tales, legends and short stories which abounded in Cuba. Of the latter group, Lydia Cabrera has been the most prolific. She has published three collections of short stories; a book about the secret Abakûa society; a study of Afro-Cuban religion called El monte; Anagä, a lucumí or Yoruba dictionary; Proverbs of Old Black Men; a work on precious stones entitled Otán Iyebiyé, as well as numerous articles on the Yorubas. In tracing the evolution of Afro-Hispanic folk literature, one can discern three distinct periods: (1) the first, which lasted from about 1550 to 1750 and which coincided with the apogee of slavery, might be called the bozal period, (2) the period of mestizaje, from about 1750 to 1900, when the Spanish and African cultures merged to form a new and peculiarly American fold tradition, and (3) the negrista period of the twentieth century, when non-folk artists imitated and often caricatured the folk tradition. The bozales were Africans, newly arrived in the Americas, who retained their native tongues and customs, and who could speak Spanish only with difficulty. Because the bozales had a highly developed oral tradition, but did not have a recorded history or a written literature, relatively little is known about their customs and beliefs. There are infrequent references to their songs, dances and beliefs in the chron- icles and travelogues of European and criollo writers. Some of the bozal tradition also survived into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when much of the material was collected and recorded by folklorists. Examples include the "Rezo de Mayombero," a liturgical song of eighteenth-century Cuban slaves; "A Song to Iroko [a sacred tree] "; and "A Song to Lower the Sack" [a working song] . In these early lyrics, the African language predominates, although there are often intercalated phrases in a dialectal Spanish. Lydia Cabrera includes in her Refranes de negros viejos proverbs such as these He who is son of Oggun [god of war] does not flee from battle. Who has seen the bones of the kangame [the ant] ? When death blows, the strongest man flies like a leaf. The tortoise swims in the middle of the river, but always returns to the bank. which came directly from the African continent. Guirao also collected African stories</page><page sequence="3">24 and legends in his Cuentos Y Leyendas. Some of these include "The Legend of Icu [Death] "; "The Story of the Deer and the Turtle", a Carabi tale; "The Dance of the Owl" from the Congo; and a Yoruba story entitled "The Tiger, the Monkey and the Deer". The bozal oral literary tradition was primitive; that is to say, it was devoid of the literary sophistication, including complex structures, thematic profusion, three- dimensional characterizations; highly connotative figurative language, and manipula- tion of verbal symbols, which characterize the works of learned writers. However, it is an extremely rich literature - lyrical, subtle, suggestive - grounded in an African philosophy which affirms the wholeness of life. There is no distinction in the African frame of reference between the spiritual and physical realms, between animate and inanimate existence, between the human, animal and plant worlds, or between man and the divinity, because their gods are anthropomorphic. Indeed, to appreciate this literature, one must understand the significance of animism (the materialization of the divinities or the belief that men, animals and plants are inhabited by souls which may exist in a separate state), totemism ( a system of distinguishing families or clans in a tribe by the totem, an object which has a blood relationship to a specific family group), ritualism (devotion to prescribed ritual forms in worship), and atavism (a recurrence of ancestral forms). The period of mestizaje was characterized by the integration of African and Spanish folklore, and the creation of a neo- African culture. Emblematic of this syncretism are two supernatural creatures, the guije of Cuba and the tunda of Ecuador. Both of these creatures are derived from African folklore, but they are American by name and habitat and by their appearance in twentieth-century Afro-Hispanic literature. The prototype of the guije might be the African boli or nia, enchanted beings, ghosts or génies who lived in the water and the forests.10 In "The Legend of the Guije", Guirao describes the creature as a "fantastic being that has its home in the Yayabo River ... It has the shape of a fish ... the head of a Negro and the tail of a fish."11 As described by the poet Nicolas Guillen in the "Ballad of the Güije," it is a black dwarf with a huge stomach, short, twisted legs and long straight ears. The tunda, according to the Ecuadorian poet and novelist, Adalberto Ortiz, also has an African origin; it is similar to the Bantu creature, the quimbungo.12 In the folklore of Esmeraldas, the coastal province of Ecuador that was settled by shipwrecked slaves, the Tunda is a hermaphrodite who assumes the shape of a beautiful woman to lure children into the jungle where she bewitches them. This supernatural creature is the subject of a short story and two poems by Ortiz,13 a long narrative poem by Nelson Estupifián Bass,14 as well as a poem by Thomas Garcia Perez, who describes her as, a horrible, deformed black woman with enormous lips, and an animal's foot shaped like a grinder. Because of her hybrid nature, she cannot have children and this is the reason that - to satisfy her maternal instinct - she steals little black children, especially cry-babies and brats; she carries them to her lair of thorns, and there, with her diabolic magic and tapao [a regional dish made out of dried meat and bananas] of prawns, she drives them mad, she intunds them.15</page><page sequence="4">25 There are many other examples of mestizaje in Hispanic culture. Two of the most complex are the syncretism of Spanish Catholicism and African religion into santeria, a Cuban religion similar to Haitian Voodoo; and the assimilation of Spanish secret societies or cofradias and African naciones or tribes into organizations of nánigos. Naniguismo was a form of witchcraft which originated among the secret societies between 1834 and 1836 to perform traditional African rites and to offer mutual protection to members. The twentieth-century negrista tradition is the least authentic of the three, because it did not emanate from the folk; instead, it developed out of certain historical, social and literary movements which emerged at the beginning of the century. Although many Black poets, including Pilar Barrios and Virginia Brindis de Salas of Uruguay. Orlando Tenorio Cuero of Ecuador and Helcías Martàn Gongora of Colombia, seldom incorporated folk motifs into their works for a variety of aesthetic or ideolo- gical reasons, most of the poets of the Negrist movement used the themes, archetypes, language and the mise en scène of Afro-Hispanic life. The following list, which is not intended to be comprehensive, suggests the diversity, the chronology and the geo- graphic distribution of folk elements. I CUSTOMS A.

Stories included: (1) "The Man with his Head in his Hand," (2) "Shall I Come Down or Not?", "The Hobbled Mule," "The Little Cart," "The Lady Hangman" and "The Souls in Purgatory." (Diaz Sanchez) 16 The writers who incorporate Afro-Hispanic folk elements into their work can be placed into three categories. First, there was a group of writers, primarily white Cubans and Puerto Ricans such as José Tallet, Felipe Pichardo Moya, Alejo Carpentier, and Luis Pales Matos who used folklore to create a mythic, unreal and magic ambient in which Antillian island and African jungle merged. Theirs is a fabulous land of serpents, sacrificial fires and totems where savages fall prostrate before Eciie and Chango, chanting: Oh, papa Abasi Oh, papá Boco! These writers use Afro-Hispanic folklore, much as Alejo Carpentier uses history, to</page><page sequence="7">28 create a dramatic and spectacular world of "magic realism;" they are not concerned with a realistic portrayal of folk life or with the communication of poetic and dramatic truths. A second group of poets and novelists such as Ramón Guirao, Adalberto Ortiz and Emilio Ballagas have a deeper understanding and appreciation of the depths and com- plexities of folk life, but it is a view that is shaped by literature. They were heavily influenced by literary "isms" such as Romanticism, Costumbrism, Realism and Modernism, and the customs, rituals and scenes which they portray emerge from books and not from life. Illustrative of this phenomenon is Adalberto Ortiz' explana- tion of his interest in Afro-Ecuadorian culture. On his return to Esmeraldas after the completion of his education, he recalls: My cabin mate . . . had given me the Anthology of Black American Poetry by Emilio Ballagas. When I finished reading it, I was overwhelmed with the negroid rhythms that were stirring in my own blood without my knowing it.17 He continues: "When I arrived in Esmeraldas, I again observed the 'marimba dances' and lived the folklore of my people." The verb observed separates the writer spatially from his subject, but, more important, it marks the psychological distance between the "I" of the poet and the "you" of the people. Ortiz thus articulates a separation which is social, based on an hierarchic class/caste system, racial (because the poet identifies himself as a mulatto in opposition to the Black masses), and educational (the learned in contrast to the illiterate). Further, he does not say that he lived the life, but the folklore, of his people, removing himself from the flesh and blood plane of reality to a kind of abstract, illusory projection of that reality not unlike the fictional realm in which Don Quijote lived and moved and had his being. Because this folklore had a literary origin, its purpose was ornamental and not functional; it embellished a work by creating a mood or a setting, by localizing a particular action or activity, or by images. The folkloric elements assume a grotesque picturesqueness which distorts and debases Afro-Hispanic culture. A third group of writers - Marcelino Arozarena of Cuba, Nicomedes Santa Cruz of Peru and Ramon Diaz Sanchez of Venezuela - combine an almost scholarly interest in folklore with a very subjective appreciation of their African heritage. Arozarena and Santa Cruz are the most authentic of this group, because they are able to convey the wholeness of Black folk life, to maintain intact the African cultural tradition with its dependence on rhythm, rite and ritual, and to use folkloric elements in a functional way. Arozarena's thirteen-page "Vocabulário" reveals that the poet has studied and analyzed Afro-Cuban folklore in great depth, and that he understands and appreciates Yoruba customs, Sanigo ritual, African languages, and Abakda symbolism, as well as Spanish, particularly Andalusian, folklore. His knowledge is partially derivative, the result of intensive reading and investigation; he cites, for example, Ortiz' The Dances and Theatre of Negroes in Cuban Folklore, Garcia Blanco's £1 Folklore Andaluz and Cimorra's El canto Jondo.18 Santa Cruz also has lengthy notes which not only define, but also explain in great</page><page sequence="8">29 detail the origin and history of certain Black Peruvian customs. He notes that the sana (or the zana) is a dance derived from the Angolan lundu, which was transformed into an irreverent song and orgiastic dance in the village of Miraflores de Záha in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.19 The section of his Décimas entitled "Folklore" contains twenty-six poems with such titles as "Black Rhythms of Peru", "I'm Going to Sing a Palmero" and "The Wake of a Black Creole" which describe the total life of a people - their African origins, their songs and dances, and their aspirations and dis- appointments. There is also a strong identification of the poet with his people; he says, for example, in one poem "My grandmother arrived from Africa dressed in snails' shells", and in another he exclaims, "And if my color is black, being what I am makes me happy". He speaks of the slaves who came from Timbuctoo and Mozambique to sing songs like the cana, the solear, the lundü and the temporera, as well as to dance the marinera, and he perhaps sums up the significance of this Afro-Hispanic culture when he writes: The customs of old Black people, who suffered a thousand disillusionments for so many years, leave a vivid image.20 MIRIAM DeCOSTA FOOTNOTES 1.
