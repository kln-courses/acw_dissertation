<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LOGIC OF SOCIOLOGY W. M. KOZLOWSKI Poznan, Poland ABSTRACT There is a lack of unanimity in sociology as to its methods and principles. This is due to the wide diffusion of the idea that science is homogeneous. Scientific con- ceptions are not ultimates, but figments of the human mind. Science becomes suc- cessful when general principles are established. Sociology is in this stage of the es- tablishment of general principles. The method of a science depends upon its aims and subject matter. Sciences with similar aims and objects tend to coalesce. Phi- losophy tends to become the mediating discipline between the diverse groups of sci- ences. There are divergent ways of securing order in the data of a science, such as the historical approach, the approach of natural history (description and classifica- tion), by the application of abstractions, either to the order of events or the order of things, or complete abstraction from the event giving us formal science (e.g., Logic). The combination of the historical approach with the application of abstractions (laws) constitutes the approach of the evolutionary sciences. Finally, the normative sciences study intentional activities. All of the foregoing approaches have been used in sociology. The liason between these approaches is formulated in the logic of the sciences. The formulation of a scientfiic law is essential in any science. The utiliza- tion of the scientific law in sociology is limited by the fewness of numbers of events and the lack of uniform reactions. As a synthesizing science sociology cannot dis- cover scientific laws, since the sciences it would synthesize are normative. To resolve the problem sociology may approach its subject matter from both the abstract, con- templative, law-formulating, and the normative points of view. In the one case, the aim is to discover sociological principles or laws; in the other, to utilize these laws toward the end of control and welfare. If we compare books on sociology, we find that there is no unity of meaning, either as to the object and the method of this science or as to its general principles. There are no particular statements which could be considered as generally admitted. The multiplicity and diversity of sociological doctrines recalls the state of the pre-Socratic philosophy, where so many controver- sial and sometimes antinomic doctrines were proposed to explain the physical cosmos. The writer attributes this state of affairs to the wrong point of departure adopted by the founders of sociology and still haunting sociologists, namely, the idea of the homogeneity of science, result- ing in the belief that every science, when reaching the positive stage of development, must become nomological, or concerned with 9I2</page><page sequence="2">THE LOGIC OF SOCIOLOGY 9I3 the establishing of laws. As Descartes tried to reduce all the sci- ences to the mathematico-deductive method, so Comte considered the experimental method of physics as the universal type of sci- ence. But there can be no universal method for all the sciences, just as there is no universal medicine for all diseases. The writer began his work in this field with an epistemological analysis of science, and put to himself the question: "Is the con- ception obtained by science an ultimate reality?" His answer, con- forming to the view of philosophy founded on Kant's criticism, was negative. Neither the atomic structure of the world nor the deter- minism of natural laws is a reality independent of the human mind. Both are products of this mind. The first is a hypothetical con- struction enabling the understanding of the reality; the second is an ordering of our experience in a way to get control of it. Science is not an act of unveiling a pre-established and everlasting reality, but an act of creating new realities of a more comprehensive type. Another lesson derived from this investigation was that science had become successful from the moment when certain very general principles were established and applied. The period of pre-Socratic philosophy, considered formerly as of slight philosophical interest, appears now of the greatest importance, as the epoch when the principles of science were established. Such is, perhaps, the condi- tion of present constructive sociology. It is a search for general principles enabling the mastering of the domain of an integral so- cial science. But the Greeks did not have the knowledge of logic which we now possess; and it seems natural to admit that a logical investigation should be able to shorten the epoch of blind seeking.' The method of a science depends upon two things: its aim and its objects or subject matter. Reflection from these two stand- points has led the author to form the scheme of classification of sciences shown on page 9I4. Sciences tend to coalesce and form a quite united domain when they do not belong to opposed groups of this scheme. The domain of nature is now forming into a fairly well-harmonized unity, as is the case in the humanistic sciences. But when we try to unite the 1 See "Les assertions fondamentales de la science actuelle &amp; I'aube de la philoso- phie grecque," Revue de Methaphysique (igoo).</page><page sequence="3">914 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY antithetic groups, it cannot be done without the mediation of phi- losophy. Such is the case in the domains of "nature" and "mind," as well as in contemplation and activity. Sociology wants both these syntheses. It cannot attain them without recurring to some philosophical mediating concept.2 AIM Philosophy Knowledge (Contemplation) CD) CD H &gt;_ __ _Characteristic objects (Practice) Activity Applied Sociology On the other hand, if it is true that science is always an order- ing of our experience, laws are not the only form of such regularity. There are different ways of securing order, depending upon our at- titude, toward the objects of study. Taking into consideration the distinction between things and events, and the several degrees of abstraction, we obtain the following types of science: a) The ordering of events in the flow of time gives history-a narrative and individualizing science. There is in it no generaliza- tion, but merely a selection of events. Its instrument is chronology. b) Applying observation to things, and classifying them ac- cording to their similarity, we obtain a science of types-a descrip- tive science (natural history). Its logical instrument is the concept. c) By applying abstraction to the order of events, i.e., trans- forming them into phenomena by separating them from their real context, we form a law. This gives the type of nomologic science. d) By applying abstraction to things, we create the sciences 2See "Sociologie ou philosophie sociale?" Revue internationale de Sociologie (July, I907).</page><page sequence="4">THE LOGIC OF SOCIOLOGY 9I5 of correlation or morphology (comparative anatomy, crystalog- raphy), of which the prototype is geometry. e) By a further degree of abstraction, sciences of operations are formed, usually called formal sciences. These are logic and mathematics. The abstraction from every content, and the study of only the operative side of knowledge, is their feature. The dif- ference between things and events disappears at this highest degree of abstraction: logic and mathematics apply equally to both. f) A new type of science is formed by the combination of nomology with ordination in time. It forms the group of sticholog- ical sciences-those of evolution, whether partial or universal. g) The last group is formed by the study of intentional (telic) activity. Sciences of this type are usually called normative or more properly "theorico-canonic" sciences. The distinction between these types of sciences is important for sociologists because most of them are either proposed or used in sociology or in sciences having the nearest connection with it. His- tory, description, nomology, numbering (statistics), research of sociological laws, social evolution, and theorico-canonic method have been applied to sociology with more or less success. Among these types of sciences there exists a relation parallel to that indicated in this scheme of classification: sciences of a group whose members differ only by a degree of abstraction present a natural parentage; it is easy to pass from one to the other. Events tend naturally to be transformed into phenomena (history tends to become sociological), and natural history leads to morphology through application of the comparative method. Both can be sub- jected to logic and to mathematics, at least in the form of statistical regularities for events or concrete objects. But the manner of forming more abstract types is different in the two series. The method used for events is based upon the transformation of histor- ical time (past, present, future) into nomological sequence (be- fore, after)' because the scientific law is nothing else than a more abstract expression of the causal relation of which the schema is cause, first; effect, after. In the second series the leading principle is the correlation of the parts of a whole-a relation independent of 'See "La pluralit6 du temps," Revue Philosophique (I924).</page><page sequence="5">9I6 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY time, as is the case of crystalography and comparative anatomy. The link between both is formed by the stichological sciences: evolution considers the differences of structure as resulting from a time process (the principle of Carnot or the second principle of thermo-dynamics) and transforms morphological proximity into real, genetic parentage.4 To form a transition between all these groups and the theorico-canonic we are obliged to ascend to a higher level, where differences of time and space disappear: to that of the logic of sciences. We shall try to show how it is done. First, however, we must give a brief account of the function of law in science. Nomology occupies a very important place among the types of sciences because of the double function of this-kind of regularity: the understanding and the controlling of events. The first consists in the fact that the establishing of a law is a necessary step leading toward a hypothesis, which is nothing else but an imaginable hypo- thetical structure of things, of which the law appears to be the in- evitable consequence. This gives satisfaction to our theoretical (contemplative) interest in science. On the other hand, the law gives the foundation for the activity controlling reality, because of the prevision of the necessary following of the consequent to the precedent (or effect to cause).5 FIELD OF CONTEMPLATION hypotheses understanding (created) I law prevision (indorsed) (reality as field of action) facts (observed) ' See "L'evolution comme principe philosophique du devenir," Revue Philoso- phique (I904), No. 2. 'See "L'explication scientifique," Revue Philosophique (I909).</page><page sequence="6">THE LOGIC OF SOCIOLOGY 9I7 The most important part of a law, as concerning practice, is that it dissolves the stichological chain of events (in which each is con- sidered as an effect of the preceding and cause of the consequent) into particular cause-effect couples, every one of which can be treated as independent and submitted to man's will conforming to Bacon's scheme: Cause ............. Effect Mean ............. Aim In order to find the mean of our action we must find a causal couple whose effect is identical to our aim. Thus the scientific law liberates man from the fatalism of primitive thinking, as well as from the determinism of historical philosophy, and opens for him a way to set up his own purposes and to become an initiator of so- cial improvements. This would be an undisputable advantage of nomologic sociology over the fatalistic historical philosophy which urged that man was only a toy of the superior powers of nature. Unhappily, careful investigation leads us to the conclusion that the idea of scientific law cannot be applied in the fulness of its ad- vantages to social events, either from the theoretical or from the practical point of view. The reasons are: a) If we apply to social phenomena the statistical idea of law as expressed by Clerc-Maxwell for physics, where the effect fore- cast by the law is considered as an average of a very large number of individual events (as, for instance, the number of the encounters of the gas molecules, their "free way," etc.), the law, then, could be exact under two conditions: (i) the great number of events; (2) the uniformity of reaction. Both of these conditions are lack- ing in social phenomena, especially the second. The reactions of human individuals to the same impulsion are very diverse and in- calculable because of the great diversity of the motives depending upon the previous individual experiences.6 ' Most of the sociologists, particularly Professors Gaston Richard and Dupreel, admit that social regularities cannot be submitted to exact laws, but are rather tend- encies (lois tendencielles). K. Menger, being a champion of nomological economics, admits, nevertheless, that economic facts are sometimes the opposite of what should have been expected according to the law. M. Painleve denies the possibility of mathe- matical economy, for reasons which seem to be quite convincing. But the uncertainty of prevision in a tendential law deprives it of its utility. We can never be quite sure of the result.</page><page sequence="7">9I8 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY b) We do not need to invent, in sociology, hypotheses of any kind, and least of all of a mechanical nature, because human ac- tivity is best understood from its motives. Socrates shows in Plato's Phedon that the explanation of his staying in prison while his escape was prepared by Kriton is not to be found in the description of the position or action of his muscles, bones, etc., but in looking into his psychical state. As we shall see, moreover, social reality is given us directly in our psychical world, and does not haunt us by its mystery, as does the physical world. c) The application of Bacon's scheme encounters two invin- cible difficulties: (i) We cannot get a man to act in accordance with our desire, other than by inducing his will to his action through the meduim of consciousness. (2) Ethical motives interfere with using other men as pure instruments of our will. It follows that sociology could not be an objective science in the same sense as are the natural sciences; that is, through excluding the consideration of states of consciousness. The unnatural character of the physical point of view, when applied to conscious beings, can be illustrated by the following ex- ample: Let us suppose an ultra-objective sociologist observing the movement of a herd of buffaloes during a period of many days. He notices that the movement during the day is northward, and to- ward the evening it is in the opposite direction. Following the nomological method, he states this change in the direction of move- ment as a law, and, perhaps, will construct a hypothesis based upon the varying polarity of the molecules being attracted to the north pole before noon, and repulsed after noon. A not indoctrined ob- server will perceive that on the north side there were pastures, and on the south side, water. But the explanation of a phenomenon by states of consciousness such as hunger or thirst is not admissible to the nomological method. The introduction of such states is equiv- alent to the acceptance of motivation. There is another kind of objectivism, namely, the introduction of certain scientific principles into sociology, under the pretense of their universality. In reality, it serves to support very subjective or partial tendencies. So the idea of the struggle for existence, be- ing a return in a generalized form to an observation of Malthus, reappears in the Darwinistic sociology in the guise of science, to</page><page sequence="8">THE LOGIC OF SOCIOLOGY 919 combat ideals of peace; the idea of non-interference in the laws of economics in the eighteenth century, as supporting the principles of the physiocrats, reappears in the nineteenth century to combat the efforts to better the condition of the poor. If we set aside the idea of a nomological sociology, one view which presents itself naturally is that sociology should be a syn- thesis of social sciences. This was accepted by the late Professor Small, who assigned to sociology the part of a "team" among social sciences, as well as by many other sociologists, such as Ward and Comte. But it is easy to show by the analysis of the particular so- cial sciences that all of them have a theorico-canonic character; and the use of the comparative method in their domain as an in- strument of synthesis is not able to lead to more than a social stat- ics based upon the principle of correlation and deprived of the dynamic element. The existence of correlation excludes the idea of the evolution of the several elements of civilization in accordance with a definite law. If the development follows a law of correlation it cannot conform to a suitable law of evolution, or vice versa. The objective aspect of the society is a view experienced by an observer looking at it from outside, as, for instance, in the case of a spectator in the theater. It is purely contemplative. For a mem- ber of the society, like an actor entering on the scene, this point of view is reversed into an active one. The solution given by the logic of sociology to the long-standing discussion between the objective and subjective method in sociology is the following: We ought to admit a voluntaristic anthropomorphism parallel to the intellec- tualistic anthropomorphism, which we accept in the natural sci- ences. Both are inevitable. The mutual relation between both must be regulated by philosophy, and this shows that scientific de- terminism is a result of a contemplative attitude of science, elimi- nating the will from its universe in the same way that physical science excludes conscience from its universe. The two seemingly irreducible antinomies-that of theory and action, as well as that of nature and mind-are only a result of our intended one-sided- ness, of our voluntarily abstracting either of the will or of con- sciousness in general. However, we should see that this contemplative attitude is in- admissible for an active being. He must have restored the fulness</page><page sequence="9">920 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY of his experience, both external and internal. On the other hand, prevision becomes impossible as soon as we adopt the active atti- tude, because everything can be changed by this very activity. Pure science can give only categorical statements of facts and hy- pothetical laws. Action is based on categorical statements for do- ing. Such opposition of these two attitudes-the contemplative and the active-concerns only the realm of "nature" exterior to human reality. It becomes less and less pronounced in measure as we descend into the depth of social consciousness; that is, the point of view of a member of the society. Here the objective line of logic passes through the neutral point into that of ethics, the science of values, or the domain of the motives of action. This neutral point corresponds to the zone of social philosophy. Social art, or politics, in a large sense, cannot repose on an absolute determinism which is in contradiction with the very idea of scientific law viewed in its practical aspect. We obtain thus a new grouping of sciences cor- responding to the idea of Comte (which he approached only at the end of his Cours, and which he never developed), that sociology gives a new aspect to the mutual interdependence of sciences.' No special science can be anything else than the knowledge of means. This concerns the sciences of nature as well as the social sciences. The realm of human aims belongs to a domain which supersedes the views of particular sciences. It is easy to illustrate this by several examples taken from social problems. The long- discussed problem of the superiority of large or of small farms, when submitted to economic investigation, must necessarily be lim- ited to the statements about the amount of produce. The econ- omist does not put to himself the question of the intellectual, moral, or political consequences of the prevalence of small or large land- owners; neither can he appreciate the conservative or progressive spirit depending on the one or the other distribution of property; nor can he forecast its consequences for the future generations de- pending upon the laws regulating the inheritance of property; still less is he able to say which of these consequences are preferable. The afore-mentioned impossibilities prove the necessity of a gen- eralized social science as sociology is admitted to be; the last, the dependency of sociology on the science of values or ethics. The ISee "La realite sociale," Revue Philosophique (I9I2).</page><page sequence="10">THE LOGIC OF SOCIOLOGY 921 eugenist can take advantage of the laws of inheritance such as those which Mendel has established. But what type is desirable, whether we shall strive toward uniformity or toward variety among human individuals, whether to try to produce the differentiation of human types according to the necessity of the division of social labor-such questions cannot be resolved by a science of means. Pedagogy and didactics can give the indication concerning the means of obtaining certain types of character or of intelligence, but the ideal of human personality on which the ideals of education depend does not belong to these special branches of sciences. The fruitful instrument of sociological construction must be, then, one which combines the two aspects of the science, the con- templative and the active, understanding and control, the one sat- isfying the theoretical interest (knowledge), the other being a means of social improvement. But this mean presupposes the aim, which cannot be established by subjective preference. The sociol- ogist must read it out of the tendencies shown in social dynamics, and thereby introduce, post factum, logic into what was possibly illogic when becoming: transform the zwecktatig into zweckmassig. That is the moment when a philosophical view of history, such as evolution of humanity's ideals, can be of use to sociologists. Such is the role of what the writer calls "sociological principles." They are ideals of the type which is applicable only to the study of teleo- logic activity. The rules of action appear here as an immediate consequence of the knowledge. They are in the domain of human action the analogue of laws in that of nature. The juridical norms, according to Jellinek, have as object, not necessity, as natural law, but duty ("kein miissen, sondern ein sollen"). The problem of pri- vate law, according to him, is how ought we to conceive the cor- responding norms in order to be able to reduce them to a unity de- prived of contradiction; that of politics, how to consider a state as an object of law. The ideas of "natural rights" and of "social con- tract" were such socio-philosophical principles. They proved to be mighty powers in the destruction of an order based upon privilege and slavery, and in the substitution for it of one based upon liberty and equality. New principles are indispensable to establish pro- gressive socialization.'
