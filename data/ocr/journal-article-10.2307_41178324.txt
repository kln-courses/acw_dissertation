<plain_text><page sequence="1">OF COWS AND CATFISH: The Reading of Nature by Thomas Hardy and Loren Eiseley MARGERY CORNWELL-ROBINSON few years ago I was investigating the contemporary litera- ture regarding the relationship between the human animal and the other animals. The material was richly diverse; writers explored various attitudes about this human/animal connection in the past, expressed their own ideas about the present, and prophesied for the future. I examined the work of highly literate scientists and carefully observant poets, modern authors who, in an age of specialization, dared to cross the boundaries of their respective disciplines and speak for integration. My search led me to the essays of Loren Eiseley, the renowned archeologist and evolutionist, whom I found to be a poet and dreamer as well. He became a dominant figure in my study. Again and again I returned to his essays and his autobiography to read of his suspicion of the scientific neatness with which modern Western civilization interprets nature.1 I delighted in the knowledge which this evolutionist transforms into poetry as he urges a resistance to the Baconian tendency to tame and warns against the deception that such taming, such simplification, involves: Mostly I come out feeling that whatever else the universe may be, its so-called simplicity is a trick, perhaps like that bird out there. I know we have learned a lot, but the scope is too vast for us. Every now and then if we look behind us, everything has changed. It isn't precisely that nature tricks us. We trick ourselves with our own ingenuity. I don't believe in simplicity.2 Margery Cornwell-Robinson is Assistant Professor of English at The College of Staten Island, CUNY. Her dissertation research constituted a history of Western thought as it concerns the relationships between humans and other animals, with a primary focus on naturalist writers since Thoreau. A two-year stay in Kenya rekindled her lifelong interest in this subject. She has lectured at the New York Zoological Society on "The African Cats." 52</page><page sequence="2">OF COWS AND CATFISH 53 Eiseley explores in a vivid and disarmingly clear manner the often abstract and difficult theories of evolution and humbly acknowledges his awareness of mysteries, of questions without answers. Recently I was rereading Thomas Hardy's novel, The Return of the Native, while preparing to discuss it with a class. In some sections his seductive manner of making the difficult come clear seemed familiar. This technique was especially apparent in the narrative passages of natural description, passages which, while not seemingly important to plot or character, trapped and fascinated the reader who took the time to follow the thread. Why did this seem familiar? Because I was reminded of Eiseley's autobiographical vignettes. Eiseley and Hardy, coming from seemingly divergent disciplines, move together because of the spectacles they choose to wear. Konrad Lorenz, himself an ethologist, explains how this is possible: "... for he who has once seen the intimate beauty of nature cannot tear himself away from it again. He must become either a poet or a naturalist and, if his eyes are good and his powers of observation sharp enough, he may well become both."3 It is the concern with the intimate that unites Hardy and Eiseley. For them, the magic of nature, as well as its message, is not revealed in the unexamined, the untouchable, the dramatic, but rather in the close and the small - the toad, the pigeon, and the fox. The simple contains the complex. The commonplace is not to be approached with condescension, but respected for purposes of education. Dorothy Van Ghent writes of Hardy's fascination with the ordi- nary as revelatory of the sublime, but her discussion might be of Eiseley's perceptions as well: Hardy does not allow us to forget that what is most concrete in experience is also what is most inscrutable, that an over-turned clod in a field or the posture of herons standing in a water mead or the shadows of cows thrown against a wall by evening sunlight are as essentially fathomless as the procreative yearning, and this in turn as fathomless as the sheerest accident in events.4 Eiseley and Hardy are not playing at mere anthropomorphic games when Eiseley studies a curtsying cat and feels it has taught him how to persevere in the face of seemingly overwhelming difficulty and when Hardy invests the sheepdog, George, with a "countenance of great concern at the serious turn pastoral affairs seemed to be taking."5 Their animals are not Disneylike</page><page sequence="3">54 SOUNDINGS cartoons nor characters from Aesop. The cows of Hardy are real, "of the Devon breed, . . . encased in a tight warm hide of rich Indian red,"6 and they will kick over a milk pail if two people rather than the immemorial one crouch under them as did Tess and Angel. Eiseley's catfish is tough, a "yellow-green, mud- grubbing, evil-tempered inhabitant of floods and droughts and cyclones."7 These two writers detect much that is human in animals because they can recognize the wealth of the animal, past and present, in themselves. They are aware of the seriousness of life to all creatures who live it and with whom they share a strange world. They reach back to a time the Netsilik Eskimos recall when a "person could become an animal if he wanted to and an animal could become a human being. Sometimes they were people and sometimes animals and there was no difference. All spoke the same language."8 Using the knowledge of the contem- porary scientist and scholar, Eiseley and Hardy have concluded , that careful and constant familiarity with the commonplace in nature emphasizes the mysteries from which the special human animal has sprung and which this creature must still accept. Eiseley explains how the Eskimos, worshipping a goddess whose fingers become seals, and a modern scientist, pondering over his fossils, are similar: Since our most modern science informs us we have come from animals and since almost all primitives have tended to draw their creator gods from the animal world with which they were familiar, modern man and his bush contemporaries have arrived at the same conclusion by very different routes. Both know that they are shape shifters and changelings.9 Hardy notices the "vermiculated horns lopping gracefully on each side of the cheeks of a sheep in geometrically perfect spirals, a small pink and white ear nestling under each horn."10 Eiseley observes a conflict between a blacksnake and a pheasant over whether a clutch of eggs is "to elongate and writhe into an armor of scales or eventually go whistling into the wind with their wild mother."11 It is from such observations that they obtain some brief insight into the generally incomprehensible universe. Any understanding of the world moves from the small to the large, and just so is it transmitted in the pages of an essay or a novel. Eiseley presents an autobiographical vignette about some crus- t√°cea in a museum, a vignette which grows through several pages</page><page sequence="4">OF COWS AND CATFISH 55 into a commentary on the development of life on earth from past to future. The spinning of a personal tale draws the reader near to an idea. Hardy describes, in two different novels, some strange birds from behind the North Pole. Their presence unfolds into an eerie exploration of the message they bring to humanity. This process of making the difficult become clear through the familiar, of using one simple natural object to produce a complex statement, is repeated again and again. The importance of the message is sensed, not because it is directly stated, but because of the manner of presentation - the delicate care for clear detail, the subtle shadings, the absorbed attention. Hardy's new-born calf mistakes a lantern for the moon, "inherited instinct having as yet had little time for correction by experience."12 A baby squirrel lying on its back, patting its stomach, reminds Eiseley that it exists in a small Eden that does not last, but recurs with the young of every generation. The nagging problem of innocence and the price of experience which haunts each individual, each human culture, is revealed in a calf's eyes and a baby squirrel's body. Eiseley and Hardy have time to pause over the small and watch it mature, and if their readers engage in the process and follow the story within the story, step by step, they marvel at the complexity and significance of both the seed and the tree. *T* ^J* *|* ?|&gt; *f+ When Hardy and Eiseley examine Nature, they are always aware of its existence in large expanses of Time. Hardy's Heath has itself become a commonplace representation of the continu- ing, the immutable, that which remains. Norcombe Hill on the Heath was "one of the spots which suggest to a passer-by that he is in the presence of a shape approaching the indestructible as nearly as any to be found on earth."13 The smallest and the most common - tiny ants or mixed wind tones moving through vari- ous forms of dried vegetation - all represent this timelessness. The shearing barn, setting for homely tasks, stands, as the castle and church do not, for a rich, ennobling connection with nature and its strength in time. Clym Yeobright rests in a nest of vivid green which "seemed to belong to the ancient world of the carboniferous period when the forms of plants were few, and of</page><page sequence="5">56 SOUNDINGS the fern kind; when there was neither bud nor blossom, nothing but a monotonous extent of leafage, amid which no bird sang."14 Eiseley is an evolutionist whose prehistoric digging sites pro- vide the stage on which life appears and slowly but determinedly changes. There he sees the singing reptile in the bird and spots amphibian ghosts in a child's love of the mud. He sees a million ancestral years in the leap of a catfish from the tank in which he has kept it. "We are both projections out ofthat timeless ferment and locked as well in some greater unity that lay incalculably beyond us."15 He feels the pulse in his own life of "an apparition from marsh and tide pool, gross with matter, gurgling and inarticulate, ape and man-ape, grisly and fang-scarred," and therefore, he can only praise that which is obscure, often de- rided.16 ***** Eiseley's spiritual life, as described in his autobiography, and that of many of Hardy's characters, is the life of the outsider, the fugitive, the troubled, those who inhabit the regions between light and darkness. It becomes easy for them to feel affinity with the natural fugitives, the inhabitants of hedgerows, of dark wells, of the Night Country, as Eiseley entitles one of his books. They can share the feelings of persecution of creatures who live on the uneasy border between freedom and civilization, and they can also sense the joy in animal behaviors which society will not allow humans, because they are "different." Eiseley maintains a sym- bolic affiliation with a mongrel who runs beside the train on which he is a youthful hitchhiker. The abandoned Fanny is cared for by a huge, quiet dog when all human care fails. "Night, in its sad, solemn, and benevolent aspect, apart from its stealthy and cruel side, was personified in this form."17 Bathsheba is at ease in her paddock with the steaming, munching cattle. She is renewed after a night of desperation by the sight of her farm horses flouncing in the pool. At a time of great exhaustion, Eiseley thinks of himself resting in the warm body of a tropical monkey (a slow loris), grasping a stick with a hand similar to his own. He experiences the apparent disdain of an observant rat for a narcissistic author and feels delight with an antelope who escapes the sportsman's bullet by leaping over a ravine. This leap is the symbolic line between</page><page sequence="6">OF COWS AND CATFISH 57 dangerous darkness and deadly light. The small shape holds a broader form. Mrs. Yeobright, on a tortured journey to visit her son, observes with momentary relief the play of larvae in a shallow pond and later envies the flight of a heron. Her son, Clym, finds his closest companions on the heath to be the flirting grasshoppers and the sturdy croppers. He notes that the sun shining through the delicate tissue of the ears of the young rabbits fires them to a blood-red transparency. Beauty is to be found in the careful observation of the ordinary, a beauty which is not surpassed in the art galleries of Paris from which he has just come. Two domestic pets, Beau, the big black hunting poodle who refuses to look into a mirror but can smell water deep under the earth, and Mickey, a dog who tries to be something other than canine, cause Eiseley to speculate on the traps of the senses and human culture. Gabriel Oak, gentle guardian of sheep and people, trusts a humble toad, a brown slug, and his sheep to tell him of the impending rain and thunderstorms about which Troy, careless representative of human frailty, knows nothing. The desire to elicit a moral from the commonplace is epitomized in two stories Eiseley tells of birds, one in which a raven steals a nestling from a sparrow's nest. The forest re- sounds with the sounds of the sparrow's parents' torment as they are joined by others; suddenly the dirge changes to a song of joy as the birds sing "because life is sweet and sunlight beautiful. They sang under the brooding shadow of the raven. In simple truth they had forgotten the raven, for they were the singers of life, and not of death."18 Eiseley's other bird tale is of a captured sparrow hawk whose mate waits for him overhead, her life in constant danger, until the captive is released. When they are reunited in the sky, they greet each other in a dance of wings and a medley of cries. Years later as he reads his morning paper with headlines proclaiming "What Next in the attributes of Machines?" Eiseley recalls the birds. The machine does not bleed, ache, hang for hours in the empty air in a torment of hope to learn the fate of another machine, nor does it cry out with joy nor dance in the air with the fierce passion of a bird. Far away, over a distance greater than space, that remote cry from the heart of heaven makes a faint buzzing among my breakfast dishes and passes on and away.19 ‚Ä¢i¬ª &gt;i¬ª ‚Ä¢*‚Ä¢ it¬ª ‚Ä¢¬£‚Ä¢</page><page sequence="7">58 SOUNDINGS As Hardy and Eiseley display a joint interest in the human bond with other creatures because of their link in Time, and as they mutually portray the benefit to be gained from this associa- tion in the present, so, too, do they agree on the responsibility which humans must assume toward nature. Jude, as a child hired by a farmer to keep the birds from eating the seed in the field, decides that there must be some extra for the rooks. When punished by the farmer, he confronts the omnipresent dilemma that what is good for God's birds is bad for God's gardeners. Sue's lament is the same when her pigeons are sold to the poulterer and she releases them from their cage to fly free. " 'O, Why should Nature's law be mutual butchery?' "20 Jude, himself a victim of society's sticking knife, is dissatisfied with himself as he participates in the butchering of a pig whose eyes gazed at Arabella "with the eloquently keen reproach of a creature recognizing at last the treachery of those who seemed his only friends."21 While Sue and Jude feel that their sympathies indicate weakness of character because of the codes of their society (although Hardy makes clear he believes the opposite), they agree ultimately that a rabbit caught in a steel trap should die quickly rather than in agony, and Jude kills it.Tess performs the same service for the pheasants dying as a result of a shooting-party's activities. She identifies the pheasants as kindred sufferers. She had been told that the hunters were quite . . . civil persons save during certain weeks of autumn and winter, when . . . they ran amuck, and made it their purpose to destroy life - in this case harmless feathered creatures, brought into being by artificial means solely to gratify these -propensities - at once so unmannerly and so unchivalrous towards their weaker fellows in Nature's teeming family.22 Hardy is unusually explicit in drawing an analogy between the misuse of the weak in nature and the weak in human society. Tess cannot escape, no more than can the small animals who huddle together in terror unable to avoid the sticks and stones of the harvesters after the wheat is cut. Gabriel Oak suddenly faces financial ruin because an excess of energy in his young sheepdog causes his entire flock of two hundred pregnant ewes to drop over a precipice to their death. "Oak was an intensely humane man. . . . His first feeling now was one of pity for the untimely fate of these gentle ewes and their</page><page sequence="8">OF COWS AND CATFISH 59 unborn lambs."23 For Hardy, one sure way to describe Oak's goodness is to demonstrate his concern for his sheep. Eiseley converses with a young muskrat caught between the vanishing forest and and lake full of boaters, and warns it away from human enemies. In this action he joins company with an eminent atomic scientist who decides to leave a turtle in the woods rather than take it home to his children. His reluctance springs from the fact that he has tampered enough with the universe. Eiseley abandons a search for bones in a cave which also houses an owl's single egg. Under that egg might have lain a treasure to make him famous in the halls of science, . . . but suppose there was nothing under the nest after all and I destroyed it? Here in this high, sterile silence with the wind crying over frightful precipices, myself and that egg were the only living things. That seemed to me to mean something. At last and quietly I backed out of the cave and slipped down into a chasm out of which I had come.24 Each slight action for each small creature carries larger implica- tions. Loren Eiseley, scientist/dreamer, and Thomas Hardy, novelist/observer, find themselves in a universe occupied by other beings, animals, who seem, mistakenly, to be insignificant in the eyes of many other humans, but whom these two writers feel they must study and know if they are to arrive at a funda- mental understanding of life. They investigate the other ani- mals, and while acknowledging the complicated value of being human, they find animal life good, instructive, and bewitching. They view with reverence the diversity within the animal king- dom, and accept both their ignorance of animal forms and their responsibility for them. As animal and human, they feel they can best use their special human qualities of creativity and reason if they attend to the resilience, patience, and life force of their own animality. In writing about these matters, Hardy and Eiseley look to their simple companions to supply the egg from which a great, plumed bird of an idea grows. Eiseley's catfish, in his leap to death from the tank, provides the conclusion. Eiseley explains how that leap connects him to the universe - past, present, and future: I missed him. . . . He had for me the kind of lost archaic glory that comes from the water brotherhood. ... In many a fin and reptile</page><page sequence="9">60 SOUNDINGS foot, I have seen myself passing by - some part of myself, that is, some part that lies unrealized in the momentary shape I inhabit. People have occasionally written me harsh letters and castigated me for a lack of faith in man when I have ventured to speak of this matter in print. They distrust, it would seem, all shapes and thoughts but their own. They would bring God into the compass of a shop- keeper's understanding and confine Him to those limits, lest He proceed to some unimaginable and shocking act - create perhaps, as a casual afterthought, a being more beautiful than man. As for me, I believe nature capable of this, and having been part of the flow of the river, I feel no envy - any more than the frog envies the reptile or an ancestral ape should envy man.25 Hardy's connection with the universe would take the form more of hoof than fin, but he would agree that his foot could easily fit into the footprints of the "horses who crossed their necks and rubbed each other lovingly as they waited in patience to be harnessed for the homeward journey."26 NOTES 1 .
