<plain_text><page sequence="1">Morgan and the Morríghan: Modern Fantasy and the Celtic Goddess Nancy O.M. Dickson Irish writers of both sacred and secular texts have for centuries used the fantastic as the most direct, efficient, and effective means of communicating with their audience about ultimate values and symbolic meanings. (Donald E. Morse 2) IVioRGAN Llywelyn fol- lows this tradition in her novel, Red Branch, a modern retelling of the mythical tales of CúChulainn, warrior hero of ancient Ireland, and of his relationship with the Morríghan, goddess of war. Llywe- lyn expresses the intricate relationship of man and goddess in this early Irish story through the fantastic: the Morríghan appears to CúChulainn in several of her physical manifestations, primarily as Raven; she also speaks directly to the reader as a voice from the Otherworld. The story itself is easily told: a hero is born, con- ceived in unusual circumstances, of course; he grows at an astonish- ing rate, performing feats advanced for his years, and later, feats impossible for others to duplicate; he builds a reputation, fights glo- rious battles, and, finally, dies. Stories like this of warriors and kings, of births and deaths, of prophecies fulfilled, of battles and re- venge, have occupied countless writers over the centuries. In any tale of Irish battle heroes, however, the war goddess, the Morríg- han, is de rigeur. Since Celtic deities and their omnipresent nature are not familiar to many modern readers, Llywelyn had to present the Morríghan in such a way as to render her both immediate and real. Llywelyn chose to present the Morríghan as a hovering pres- ence throughout the book, in one of the goddess's more familiar manifestations: that of the raven or battle crow. In her representation of the war goddess, Llywelyn reveals both the physical manifestations and the supernatural essence of the Morríghan. Llywelyn recounts her story in the third person, allow- ing us to "see" the goddess in the same physical form as do the char- 24</page><page sequence="2">Nancy O. M. Dickson acters in the book. In addition, the goddess appears to us, the readers- and not to the characters in the book- as a voice, breaking suddenly into the tale and into our thoughts, observing, comment- ing, prophesying. Thus, the various forms the goddess assumes are described while her supernatural nature is conveyed as a voice, an- nounced only by a shift into italics, which speaks directly into the reader's mind. Throughout the tale of Red Branch, she appears to us as she may have appeared to the ancient Irish, not only in a variety of physical manifestations but also as a disembodied Otherworld pres- ence. She is a shape shifter who influences, but does not control, destinies. Because she speaks directly to us, however, she is also a living presence in the tale, not just a speaker from "then" but one who is very much alive right now as well. (Although Raven is clearly a manifestation of the Morrighan, she speaks to us only in this zoomorphic form. In this paper I will use the name Raven to re- fer to the supernatural being who addresses us directly and her more formal name, the Morrighan, to refer to the goddess in her other manifestations.) Who is the Morrighan? She is a quintessentially Celtic deity: a goddess who is both a single entity and a trio of goddesses each of whom manifests a slightly different aspect and each of whom is in- volved with war. As Raven herself tells us in this story, she can ap- pear not only as a raven, a physical reminder of the bloody battlefield where she feasts on those slain, but she has other names and other forms as well. In the manifestation called Badb, she shows herself to warriors on the eve of battle as a "handsome red- haired woman washing clothes in a stream." Anyone who recog- nizes the clothes as his own, sees his own imminent death. As Nem- hain, she is "a crone in black robes singing death-music," whose voice can cause such terror òn the battlefield that men die of fright (Llywelyn 164). In all her various manifestations, the war goddess causes confusion and death through her very presence and controls the outcome of the battle with magic.1 Although the Morrighan' s powers of magic and illusion, of psy- chological rather than physical control of the battle, might suggest a deity without a firm physical form, we find this is far from the case. Instead, the Morrighan presents us with a variety of physical mani- festations: in zoomorphic form she appears as a raven, an eel, a red eared heifer, and in anthropomorphic form she is seen as an aged crone and as a beautiful young girl.2 Thus she is both a supernatural 25</page><page sequence="3">Modem Fantasy and the Celtic Goddess Journal of the Fantastic force and a physical shape shifter. She is also, as we will see, a god- dess with some very human emotions. As is true in most Celtic tales, in Red Branch the Otherworld is omnipresent. It is not that the gods simply hover above the mortal plane, although that happens as Raven flies over the battlefield. It is not simply that the gods come to earth, although that happens when the god, Lugh, abducts CúChulainn's mother and fathers CúChulainn on her. It is not merely that mortals are taken to the Otherworld abode of the gods, although that too happens when CúChulainn is received by Lugh at his death. The Otherworld and the mortal realm form an interlaced tapestry in which it becomes impossible to separate the strands, nor is there any desire on the part of Llywelyn's audience to do so. In Red Branch, Llywelyn has given us a view of the fundamen- tal union of goddess and mortal: the war goddess and her champion. Theirs is a life-long union which begins when the young boy, CúChulainn, summons her to him by drawing her figure over and over in the dirt. The nature of that summoning, his unconscious ac- tion, suggests to those familiar with the Celtic belief in reincarnation that this may well be another life of involvement between warrior and goddess.3 The goddess and the warrior exist for one another and their relationship is truly symbiotic: as goddess and mortal, as female and male, as death and life- in all of their various aspects they encompass creation. The Morrighan inspires the hero to per- form extraordinary feats, and she rewards him with supernatural abilities. For his part, the warrior feeds the goddess's physical manifestation with his battle kill and nourishes her supernatural es- sence with his fear. The Morrighan, as Raven, explains this rela- tionship she has with mortals: I am not as bloodthirsty as you may (hink: I simply require nour- ishment. All life needs fuel, a transfer of energy, and I need more than humans do. If you do not think it takes energy to change from one form to another, you are mistaken. I am not always a raven, you see ... . Whatever form I assume is always female, however, and the moments of my transformation are, like the lives of women, intimately connected with blood. Menstruation, deflo- ration, childbirth- a sacrifice of blood pouring from human clay to planetary clay. This gives me strength. (Llywelyn 164) She supports the warrior in battle but demands her payment in blood. As a shapeshifting goddess, the Morrighan is not always easy to recognize. In this tale, as in all Irish tales, apparent boundaries are 26</page><page sequence="4">in the Arts Nancy O. M. Dickson fluid and appearances can be deceptive. When the Morrighan ap- pears to CúChulainn on the battlefield, she is simultaneously a beau- tiful girl and a manifestation of the goddess. When CúChulainn transforms himself with his Rage in battle, he is at once a vulner- able, mortal hero and an invincible Other. To understand this it is necessary to look at one fundamental characteristic of Celtic myth. Celtic myth (and the mind which created it) strives to focus on the point at which seemingly disparate items, ideas, and forms of being come together. In this liminal area, we find the being who is both Otherworld and mortal, the death that cannot be, but is, and the world which is simultaneously the realm of the mundane and the su- pernatural.4 Recently both Richard Kearney and Donald Morse have argued that the Celtic mind strives to find the point at which things con- verge. This intersection, this interpénétration of the invisible and the visi- ble worlds reflects Irish culture's double-mindedness: the striking confluence of both/and present throughout Irish culture and thinking opposed to the more prevalent, at least in the west, di- chotomy of either/or. (Morse 8) This is not a new idea in the Irish world. We find this double- mindedness articulated by the ninth century Irish scholar, Johannes Scottus Eriugena, whose philosophical outlook focused on the junc- tion of all nature rather than its separation into categories. He de- fines his "area of investigation as nature, which for him includes all that is, and all that is not" (Moran 97). Furthermore, Eriugena ar- gues that man and god should not be seen as two separate and dis- tinct modes of being, but as a single unity which is both mortal and divine. The major difference between the Irish and the Graeco- Roman approach to ordering thought is that the former remained es- sentially free from the Platonic-Aristotelian logic system in which all thought is based on dividing the world into a series of opposing categories. This method of organizing thought depends on constant discrimination: something is this, not that, and a constant, ongoing organization of everything into dualities. Rather than seeing the world as a sequence of oppositions, a realm of cause and effect, the Irish mind looks for the union, the junction between things, the point at which, for example, goddess and mortal unite (Kearney 7-14). Llywelyn draws on this quintessential^ Irish philosophical ori- entation in Red Branch where the human aspect of the goddess and 27</page><page sequence="5">Modem Fantasy and the Celtic Goddess Journal of the Fantastic the Otherworld nature of the mortal hero iňtersect repeatedly and feed one another. As the mortal hero, CúChulainn, becomes more Otherworldly, assuming supernatural powers, the goddess assumes a mortal form and expresses human emotions. Although on one level the story appears to involve the struggle between human ene- mies, Queen Medb of Connaught and CúChulainn of Ulster, the struggle at the core of this tale is the dance between goddess and hero. The goddess demands the hero's complete commitment while he struggles to maintain relationships in the human realm. This is an Irish story. Apparent boundaries between mortal and Otherworld shift constantly and it is impossible to distinguish the fight between Queen Medb and CúChulainn from his struggle with the Morrighan. Instead, these two battles become enmeshed and, as they do so, each of the individual participants assumes qualities and aspects of the other. Medb uses the powers of the Morrig- han- magic and illusion- to defeat CúChulainn, while the Morrig- han assumes a human shape in her attempt to appropriate Medb's use of her "friendly thighs" as a means to subdue or dominate men. As the goddess takes on mortal form, CúChulainn avails himself of Rage, the supernatural power which was a gift of the Morrighan. When he assumes this he is assuming her power to cause death through the terror and fright he brings to the battlefield. His use of this supernatural power assures his immortality. In order to live a human life, and die a human death, he must relinquish his control over this power. Since we cannot follow all these threads simultaneously, we will begin with the relationship between the boy, CúChulainn and the Morrighan, or Raven, as she first appears to him. This association, which dominates the tale, is not a one-sided affair. Each of them profits- and suffers- from their relationship. The boy, CúChu- lainn, or Setanta as he was first called, is of uncertain parentage. His mother is a mortal woman, but she is often visited by Lugh of the Long Hand, her lover from the Otherworld, who appears to be the boy's father. Her mortal husband, Sualdam, knows only that the boy is not his and abandons both the boy and his mother, preferring to live at Emain Macha, the fort of the king. Rejected by both his parents, CúChulainn grows up alone, spending most of his time run- ning free on the plain of Merthemny . One day, he encounters a huge raven perched atop a tall, solitary stone pillar: 28</page><page sequence="6">in the Arts Nancy O. M. Dickson The bird did not fly away at his approach, but seemed to wait for him. Unblinking, it regarded him with a predator's glare. Setanta thought of the Battle Raven, the dreaded Morrighan who was one of the deities of war . . . seized with a defiant sense of play ... he drew his sword and ran forward, brandishing the weapon. "Hail to the Morrighan," he cried ... "I will be the greatest of all your warriors; watch me!" (Llywelyn 27) Raven responds with a recognition of her own. She spreads her massive wings casting a cold shadow across the boy's face. After that, the boy avoids the field and the stone, returning to this fateful plain only at his death. Soon after his first meeting with the goddess, CúChulainn runs away from home to join his father and the other warriors at Emain Macha. The goddess, as Raven, accompanies him. Although he is frightened at first by her presence, he soon becomes accustomed to her and, on the few occasions when she flies ahead of him, he misses her. We, as readers, first hear the direct voice of the goddess during this trip of boy and bird to Emain Macha as Llywelyn establishes the distinction between Raven, the physical manifestation of the goddess which appears to CúChulainn, and the supernatural voice of the Oth- erworld being who sounds only for us. The trip to Emain Macha is a long one and, after they have trav- eled for a while, one day dawns cold and rainy. As the two toil on together, the boy becomes convinced that the bird is following him simply to pick his bones once he is dead, so he tries to scare her away. He waits until she comes close to him then suddenly opens one eye as wide as possible, squints the other closed and gives the bird a lopsided glare. The bird squawked and hopped sideways. Then, as if embar- rassed by its fright, it stopped and began preening its damp feath- ers. (Llywelyn 30) We see what CúChulainn sees: a wet, bedraggled bird. Immedi- ately, however, the bird- goddess as Raven- speaks to us and not to the boy. Rain. I hate rain. And cold, and damp, and mud. This is not the right climate for me, though I do my best to make the most of a bad situation. ... I would do much better in a hot, dry place- like the desert. Yes, I could do my best work in the desert. But we are not allowed our preferences, any of us. We just are what we are and do what we do. I, for example, am in the war business. The tools of my trade are magic and terror. (Llywelyn 30) 29</page><page sequence="7">Modem Fantasy and the Celtic Goddess Journal of the Fantastic This voice of the Morrighan, addressing the reader directly, gives us the impression that she is speaking not into our ears but straight into our minds with a voice from the Otherworld. Although she praises the boy for his courage in trying to scare her away, she is not yet fully enmeshed with him, and she reverts to her complaints about the weather and her own introspection: My feathers stank of damp. Miserable weather. I would curse . . . but that is another of my burdens. Humans with their colorful vocabularies can use the full pantheon of gods and demigods to call down curses upon anything they choose . . . but who do we call upon? It is not easy, being me. (Llywelyn 30-31) And here we hear the first intimation that the Morrighan, the terrible war goddess who feasts on those slain in battle, has another side, an- other nature. In this voice, we hear intimations of the humanity of this goddess; she is not omnipotent, she suffers from cold and damp, she has no control over her own destiny, and she has a sense of humor. The Morrighan is not a simple goddess . She wears more than one face. Besides fear and terror, she would elicit very differ- ent, human emotions, those of compassion, pity, and even love. As Raven herself tells us, she has a maternal aspect.5 I once had a son. Mechi was his name, and he was born on the sa- cred hill of Tara when I lived there in womanly form. That was a long time ago, of course, I do not remember it raining so much, then. . . my son ran carefree across the meadow land and butter- cup pollen gilded his legs. Then Mechi was slain. The son of Cet killed him in an act of recreational slaughter, like hunting deer for pleasure. (Llywelyn 58-59) And so she says, she has sworn to pay men back by encouraging them to destroy each other, generation after generation. She contin- ues: Kill, I urge them, Kill. Yet I am not a monster. I have known love. When I first encountered the child then known as Setanta I remembered love. Love and war- what else is there? Love is the more dangerous of the two. I wear the other face. (Llywelyn 59) For her, certainly, love is the more dangerous. Having watched one son die through the "recreational slaughter of men," in this tale she becomes emotionally entangled with another young male whom she will also watch being killed by men. 30</page><page sequence="8">in the Arts Nancy O. M. Dickson Thus, although she claims to wear only the "other face," the face of war, once she has remémbered love, the boy, and the warrior hero he later becomes, feeds this emotion in her. While she does not nurture the boy physically, she does so psychologically. As she watches over him, encourages him to greater feats on the battle field, gives him special powers, she becomes, in a sense, his mother. She begins on the trip to Emain Macha. When he becomes exhausted and discouraged, she urges him forward, nags and taunts him, and finally resorts to pecking his ankles to get him to resume his trip. Later, when he arrives at the fort and is attacked by the Boy Troop, she gives him the first of her magic gifts. Taunting him and calling him coward, she turns him into a fighting frenzy. Suddenly, the boy felt a rapture of reckless courage flame through his veins, engorge his muscles, transforming mortal sinews with a spark of immortal- ity. On the playing field of Emain Macha, one young boy became Rage. (Llywelyn 39) Soon after she transforms the boy by giving him this supernatural power, he begins his transformation of her. The Morrighan be- comes proud of the young boy. She says, A long time had passed since I felt any of that emotion humans call tenderness. This boy who had, in ignorance, drawn me into his life had touched something in me I thought withered. (Llywelyn 58) And so the struggle between them begins. The Morrighan desires CúChulainn and tries to seduce him both intellectually- with the en- during fame which accrues to the champion- and physically- by as- suming the shape of a beautiful woman. Twice she assumes mortal form and twice she is unsuccessful in her quest for a physical part- nership with CúChulainn. Once she comes to the battlefield where CúChulainn is alone and under attack from the combined armies of Queen Medb and tries to offer him her help. Because she assumes the form of a beautiful young girl, the daughter of a king, he misun- derstands her offer for help as an attempt at simple seduction- he cannot see the goddess in the girl- and he rejects her offer. The goddess is enraged at his response to her and promises revenge. She assumes three separate zoomorphic forms and hinders him in his next battle with a human foe. 31</page><page sequence="9">Modem Fantasy and the Celtic Goddess Journal of the Fantastic On another occasion, while CúChulainn is sleeping, she does try to seduce him. She appears as one of two Otherworld women: one is strong and forceful while the other is soft and weak. Unfortu- nately for him, CúChulainn is enchanted by the weaker, softer, more feminine appearing of the two. The Morrighan, who had as- sumed the stronger form, becomes enraged at his rejection, beats him senseless and leaves him near death for a year. In taking this form, of the stronger woman, the Morrighan chooses the character- istics of Medb, CúChulainn's mortal enemy. While the link be- tween Medb and the Morrighan is never made explicitly clear, it is one which underlies the tale. As Raven notes, I know Medb. I have observed her life after life, watching her de- velop in to a complex being. She can love and hate in a single breath, can Medb. But though she sends men into battle, she has never committed herself to me. (Llywelyn 163). Clearly, if Raven has observed Medb in "life after life," Medb has lived more than once, and this suggestion of reincarnation echoes that which was raised in the first meeting between Raven and CúChulainn. Throughout the tale, we hear intimations of a cyclical struggle between beings who are both mortal and immortal. Raven, for example, does not always assume the same manifestation. In earlier days she has been priestess and mother, young girl and hag. In this cycle, she is the war goddess molding a war hero, but she is also female and falls in love with her creation. Raven understands how to foster the supernatural warrior-hero but she does not understand how to seduce the mortal man. CúChu- lainn is drawn to men who are as tough as he is and to women who are as soft as his wife, Emer. As Raven says, love isn't her busi- ness, war is, and, she observes, love is more dangerous than war- certainly for her it is more difficult. The human tension be- tween male and female is played out here between goddess and mor- tal while the balance of power between goddess and mortal oscillates. The physical battles in Red Branch take place between mortals but the outcome of these fights is determined by who has access to the supernatural powers of the goddess. Thus, the cattle raid mounted against Ulster by Queen Medb, which appears to take place on a purely mortal plane, is actually played out on both mortal and supernatural planes simultaneously. In his first battle with Queen Medb, CúChulainn uses his supernatural powers, given to him by 32</page><page sequence="10">in the Arts Nancy O. M. Dickson the goddess, to hold mortal foes at bay. In a later battle, again be- tween Medb and CúChulainn, it is Medb who summons the powers of the supernatural while CúChulainn has relinquished his and in this fight he is defeated. How did the power of the supernatural move from Ulster to Connaught, from CúChulainn to Medb? It would be too simple to say that the goddess changed her allegiance, although that might ap- pear to be the case at first glance. Between his two epic battles with the forces of Queen Medb, a monumental struggle takes place within CúChulainn himself: he is torn between the attractions of the mortal realm and the Otherworld. Pulled towards the mortal realm by his love for his wife, Emer, and his cohorts among the warriors of the Red Branch, CúChulainn is drawn with an equal intensity by the lure of the Morrighan, the fame and immortality she offers, which he can keep only through the use of her power. When he decides to live en- tirely in the mortal realm, his fate is sealed. As CúChulainn relinquishes his supernatural powers, Queen Medb turns to magic. She enlists three spell-weaving women to cloud CúChulainn's mind. They create magic mists to separate him from anyone who might come to his rescue, they lure him to the bat- tle field with the sounds of war, they deceive him with tales of his wife's capture and his stronghold's destruction, and they impair his ability to think- to see beyond their spell. These magical illusions are those of the Morrighan herself. Invincible in ordinary combat, CúChulainn falls through the combination of magic-wielding women who weaken him psycho- logically and revenge-seeking warriors who deliver the physical blows. Although he rejected her gifts, the Morrighan continues to support and encourage her protégé. She tries to save him first by summoning the mortal women of Ulster to protect him from Medb's magic- weavers. Later, she tries to keep him from the battle by breaking his chariot, but CúChulainn hears the lure of battle and the warrior in him cannot refuse. In his death, as happened throughout his life, the Otherworld of magic and illusion becomes manifest in the physical realm. Raven, the goddess herself, gives him a final, parting gift. When the mor- tally wounded CúChulainn ties himself to a pillar so he will die standing erect- a hero's death- she perches herself on top of the pil- lar, guarding him until his spirit leaves his body. 33</page><page sequence="11">Modem Fantasy and the Celtic Goddess Journal of the Fantastic By the time of CúChulainn's death, Raven's human emotions have become prominent. As she guards the dying hero, she muses, He had made the choice that was his to make, but I was bound to him until the end. So I settled above his head on the stone where he had first seen me to wait with him. Will you understand if I say I was very proud of CúChulainn? Though he had rejected me, I loved him more than I have loved anyone before or since. I could see the spirit within the flesh. (Llywelyn 482) And, it is Raven who delivers his eulogy after his death, He had earned in full measure the Champion's Portion. The path he trod was narrow, torn between opposing obligations, and sometimes there had been no right choice to make- only the least wrong one. Let no man envy him. Nor forget him, for he de- serves his immortality. (Llywelyn 485). She recounts the tales of revenge and death that follow the death of CúChulainn and she concludes, "Ulster has known little peace since, so I should be content. But more often than I wish, I think of CúChulainn" (Llywelyn 486). As she mourns the death of her warrior-hero, CúChulainn, we see yet another manifestation of the Irish war goddess. While she has made the mortal hero immortal, he has made her mortal, if only for a while. Notes 1. War goddesses assume a prominent role throughout the Celtic world.
