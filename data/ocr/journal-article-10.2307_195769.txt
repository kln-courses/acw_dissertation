Wilson The British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies is a refereed academic journal published for the British Society for Middle Eastern Studies (popularly known as BRISMES). Founded in 1974 as the BRISMES Bulletin, the British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies assumed its present title in 1991 reflecting its growth into a fully-fledged scholarly journal. The editors aim to maintain a balance in the journal's coverage between the modern social sciences and the more traditional disciplines associated with Middle Eastern and Islamic studies. They welcome scholarly contributions on all aspects of the Middle East from the end of classical antiquity to the rise of Islam. Articles on the language, literature, history, politics, economics, anthropology, sociology, geography, and the religions and cultures of the region are encouraged. The British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies also includes a vigorous review section covering publications on all subjects connected with the Middle East. This incorporates a wide range of reference and bibliographical material seldom reviewed elsewhere.

Cooperation enables the Society to pursue a concerted strategy at the national level by impressing on governmental, university and national bodies the importance of safeguarding and expanding the Society's areas of interest. The fostering of international ties is also important and the Society provides the essential channel through which scholars outside Britain may create cooperative links with British researchers. Every attempt is being made to consolidate and expand such links with societies similar to BRISMES in other European countries, the Middle East, North America and elsewhere. In addition to publishing the British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies and a Newsletter, the Society organizes an annual conference and provides other professional services from time to time. Enquiries concerning membership, whether individual or corporate, should be addressed in the first instance to the secretary, Dr C. Hillenbrand, Department of Islamic &amp; Middle Eastern Studies, University of Edinburgh, 7-8 Buccleuch Place, Edinburgh EH8 9LW, or to the Administrative Assistant, Mrs Louise Haysey, c/o CMEIS, University of Durham, South End House, South Road, Durham DH1 3TG.
