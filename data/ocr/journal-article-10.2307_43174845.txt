Students are listening to the earthworm reading his diary, "June 1 5th: My older sis- ter thinks she's so pretty. I told her that no matter how much time she spends looking in a mirror, her face will always look just like her rear end." The third-grade class giggles as the teacher continues to read the worms hilarious diary entries. After the read aloud, the teacher leads students through a reading comprehension strategy called questioning the author (Beck et al. 1997) in which the students learn to think critically about what they are read- ing. The teacher models this by generating a list of questions to ask the author, such as "Is this accurate - a worms head and tail look just alike? Can you tell a worms head from its tail?" Students then observe live earthworms with hand lenses and read a nonfiction book about worms in an effort to find the answer. Through this exciting lesson, students construct their own understandings about earthworm adaptations, how earthworms help the earth, and how to design and conduct simple experiments to answer questions. What Is Picture-Perfect Science? This scenario describes how a children's picture book can help guide students through an engaging, hands-on inquiry lesson. More Picture-Perfect Sci- ence Lessons contains 1 5 science lessons for students in kindergarten through grade four, with embed- ded reading comprehension strategies to help them learn to read and read to learn while engaged in inquiry-based science. To help you teach according to the National Science Education Standards, the lessons are written in an easy-to-follow format for teaching inquiry-based science: the Biological Sci- ences Curriculum Study 5 E Instructional Model (Bybee 1997). This learning-cycle model allows students to construct their own understandings of scientific concepts as they cycle through the following phases: engage, explore, explain, elaborate, and evaluate. More Picture-Perfect Science Lessons is primarily a book for teaching science, but read- ing-comprehension strategies are embedded in each lesson. You can model these essential strate- gies throughout while you keep the focus of the lessons on science. Use This Book Within Your Science Curriculum We wrote More Picture-Perfect Science Lessons to supplement, not replace, your school's existing science program. Although each lesson stands alone as a carefully planned learning cycle based on clearly defined science objectives, the lessons are intended to be integrated into a complete curriculum in which concepts can be more fully developed. The lessons are not designed to be taught sequentially. We want you to use More Picture-Perfect Science Lessons where appropriate within your school's current science program to support, enrich, and extend it. And we want you to adapt the lessons to fit your school's curricu- lum, the needs of your students, and your own teaching style. ix Copyright© NSTA 2007. All rights reserved.

Assessments range from poster sessions with rubrics to stu- dent-created books to formal multiple-choice and extended-response quizzes. 2 Reading Comprehension Strategies Reading comprehension strategies based on the book Strategies that Work (Harvey and Goudvis 2000) and specific activities to enhance compre- hension are embedded throughouyhe lessons and clearly marked with an icon ( ). Chapter 2 describes how to model these strategies while reading aloud to students. 3 Standards-Based Objectives All lesson objectives were adapted from National Science Education Standards (NRC 1996) and are clearly identified at the beginning of each lesson. Chapter 5 outlines the National Science Educa- tion Standards for K-4 and shows the correlation between the lessons and the Standards. 4 Science as Inquiry As we said, the lessons in More Picture-Perfect Science Lessons are structured as guided inquiries following the 5E model. Guiding questions are embedded throughout each lesson and marked with an icon ( 7 ). The questioning process is the cornerstone of good teaching. A teacher who asks thoughtful questions arouses students' curiosity, promotes critical thinking skills, creates links between ideas, provides challenges, gets immedi- ate feedback on student learning, and helps guide students through the inquiry process. Each lesson includes an Inquiry Place, a section at the end of the lesson that suggests ideas for developing open inquiries. Chapters 3 and 4 explore science as in- quiry and the BSCS 5E Instructional Model. References Beck, I., R. Hamilton, L. Kucan, and M. McKeown. 1997.

Some of these books feature animals that have been anthropo- morphized - forest animals talk, a worm keeps a diary. While we recognize that many scientists and educators believe that personification, teleology, animism, and anthropomorphism promote misconcep- tions among young children, others believe that removing these elements would leave children's literature severely underpopu- lated. Further, backers of these techniques not only see little harm in their use but also argue that they facilitate learning. Because More Picture-Perfect Science Lessons specifically and carefully supports scientific inquiry - "That Magnetic Dog" lesson, for instance, teaches students how to weed out misconceptions by asking them to point out inaccurate statements about magnetism - we, like our authors, feel the question remains open.

Suggested scheduling is as follows: Day 1: Engage with Imaginative Inventions read aloud, and Explore/Explain with Improve an Invention. Day 2: Elaborate with Leo Cockroach , Toy Tester read aloud and Toy Testing. Day 3 and Beyond: Evaluate with Toy Invention Journal and Advertising Poster. Materials One standard Frisbee flying disc One pie tin Several "new and improved" versions of flying discs (or pictures of them) such as a foam flying disc, the Glow in the Dark Frisbee, or an Aerobie ring Other examples of inventions from the book Imaginative Inventions , such as eyeglasses, high-heeled shoes, roller skates, flat-bottomed paper bags, marbles, and piggy banks 2 types of inexpensive simple toys to test (1 of each per student or pair), such as blow ball pipes, finger traps, jumping frogs Fun Ratings overhead Safety Ratings overhead Student Pages _» Inexpensive toys are available from XÃ j it . www. orientaltradine.com 0 My XÃ j Improved it Invention . 0 Toy Testing WorldWise Sheridan My Toy Invention Journal www.classroomgoodies.com Background The design process in technology is the parallel to inquiry in science. In scientific inquiry, students ex- plore ideas and propose explanations about the natural world, whereas in technological design students identify a problem or need, design a solution, implement a solution, evaluate a product or design, and communicate the design process. In grades K -4, the standards suggest studying familiar inventions to determine function and to identify problems solved, materials used, and how well the product does what it is supposed to do. The purpose of this lesson is to encourage students' creativity, imagination, and problem-solving skills with activities that focus on the technological design process. In todays fast-growing, highly competitive global marketplace, innovative thinking is more important than ever. Technology involves using science to solve problems or meet needs, and the understanding of technology can be developed by challenging students to design a solution to solve a problem or invent something to meet a need. Simply stated, inventors try to solve problems. They think about peoples' needs and come up with a solution. Inventions don't have to be entirely new ideas. Sometimes they can be add-ons or improvements to existing inventions. All inventions have benefits (good things that result from using them) and risks (possible hazards that may result from using them). Inventors must be sure the benefits of their inventions outweigh the risks. 198 „ National Science Teachers Association Copyright© „ NSTA 2007. All rights reserved.

Ask ? What is an invention? (Something that is made to meet a need or solve a problem.) 7 What is the difference between an inven- tion and a discovery? (An invention is something that is created; a discovery is something that is found for the first time. For example, Ben Franklin discovered that lightning is electrical current, but he invented the lightning rod.) ? What do inventors do? (They think about people s needs or problems and come up with solutions. Build connections to the author by reading the inside flap of the book about Charise Mericle Harpers favorite invention ("... muffins, which taste a lot like cake, but you get to eat them for breakfast!") Ask 7 What do you think is the greatest thing ever invented? Turn and talk to a partner. inferring: Stop and Jot Select several of the inventions in the book to read about. As you read each two-page spread, leave out the name of the invention and instead say "this invention." Have students make inferences about the identity of each invention using clues from the text and illustrations. They can stop and jot their guesses on sticky notes as you read. After reading each description, reveal the name of the invention and then have students identify the need or want that the invention filled. Cxplore/ Cxplain Improve an Invention Explain that instead of coming up with completely new inventions, inventors often think of ways to make an old one better. A good example of this involves the improvements made to a very popular toy, the Frisbee. Make a T-chart with the words benefit and risk on the board. Discuss that all inventions can have both benefits (good results) and risks (bad results) for people and the environ- ment. Ask the following questions, and write the students' responses on the T-chart: 7 What are the possible benefits of a Frisbee? (Answers might include: You can have fun with it and get exercise using it.) ? What are the possible risks of a Frisbee? (An- swers might include: You could get hurt if hit by a Frisbee, you could lose it outside, creating litter and making Frisbees in factories could cause pollution.)

Inventors improved upon this by making it from a softer material so the Frisbee was less risky to use. Demonstrate the evo- lution of Frisbee design by showing students a pie tin as well as several "new and improved" versions of flying discs such as lightweight foam versions, the Glow-in-the-Dark Frisbee, or an Aerobie ring. (You may want to take students outside to test some of the improved versions and compare them to the original.) Ask 7 How are the new and improved Frisbees more fun or useful than the original? 7 What are the benefits of the new and improved Frisbees? 7 What are the possible risks of the new and improved Frisbees? Explain that inventors try to improve prod- ucts by increasing their benefits and reducing their risks. Now go back to Imaginative Inventions and write the names of the other inventions from the book on the board. Provide examples of several of these for students to look at, such as eyeglasses, high-heeled shoes, roller skates, flat- bottomed paper bags, and marbles. Have each student or group choose one of the inventions from the book and brainstorm ways that the invention could be improved upon. Pass out the My Improved Invention student page. Have students select one of their ideas for improving an invention, draw a labeled picture of it, and give it a clever or descriptive name. They should also explain how their improved invention is more fun or more useful than the original and describe its risks and benefits. Stu- dent directions for the My Improved Invention page are as follows: 1 Which invention would you like to improve? 2 Draw and label your improved invention in the box below, and give it a new name. 3 How is your improved invention more fun or useful than the original? 4 What are the benefits of your improved invention? 5 What are the risks of your improved invention? elaborate Leo Cockroach, Toy Tester Read Aloud and Toy Testing Introduce the author and illustrator of the book Leo Cockroach y Toy Tester. Kevin O'Malley first decided he wanted to illustrate children's books when he was in the fourth grade! He was in "time out" one day when he started reading Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak, and that book inspired him to write and illustrate humor- ous books for kids.

(Toy companies have to test their toys for safety. Many toy companies also give children toys to test and observe their reactions to them.) Determining Importance Before you begin reading the book, ask students to give a thumbs up for any toy in the book they think would be fun and safe and a thumbs down for any toy that they think would be boring or dangerous. Then read aloud Leo Cockroach , Toy Tester , making sure to read the name of each toy in the illustrations. After reading ask 7 Why do companies need to test toys? (To see if the toys are both fun and safe.) Discuss how most toys come with warning labels and/or directions for using the toy safely. Discuss the possible risks of various toys. For ex- ample, babies and young children often put things in their mouths. If a toy is too small, or contains small parts, it could be a choking hazard. If a toy is too sharp it could poke someone. Then ask 7 Would you like to be a toy tester? Tell students that they are going to have a chance to be toy testers for Waddatoy Toys! Pass out the Toy Testing student page. On the board, write the name of one of the toys and label it "Toy A." Write the name of the other toy on the board and label it "Toy B." Give each student or pair of students both toys to test. They will be testing how much fun and how safe each toy is. Allow them several minutes of guided discovery with the toys.

(No. It is good to have more than one opinion about a toy.) Overall Class Ratings Discuss the idea that toy companies don't take just one persons opinion about a toy. They collect many people s opinions about a toy before making changes to the toy or before deciding to sell it in stores. Show students the Fun Ratings overhead. Point out the parts of the graph: the title, the x-axis label, the y-axis label, and the box with lines for summarizing the class ratings for Toy A and Toy B. Tell them that the graph will help them make a conclusion about the toy by showing everyone's ratings. Use a colored marker to color in the box for Toy A on the key. By a show of hands, count the number of "not fun" ratings and draw a bar using the color for Toy A. Then count the "sort of fun" and "very fun" ratings. Next, use a different- colored marker to color in the box for Toy B on the key. By a show of hands, count the number of "not fun" ratings and draw a bar using the color for Toy B.
