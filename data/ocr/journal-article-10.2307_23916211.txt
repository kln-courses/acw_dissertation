<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Deity in American Constitutional History Leo Pfeffer Invocation of the deity or deities to authenticate the commands of those who decreed the acts of state goes back long before the biblical era and encompasses not only the Western world but the Eastern as well. In ancient Israel, and its offsprings Christianity and Islam, every important act of state was accompanied by a prayer to the deity and an attestation that the particular act was commanded or at the very least sanctioned by him. The crowning of a king,1 the going out to war and the coming back from it, whether in success or defeat,2 the establishment of communities and the fixing of their borders,3 the regulation of what today would be deemed strictly secular affairs, such as the determination of the compensation to be received by one whose ox was gored by his neighbor's4—all these and an infinite number of others were determined in accordance with what the particular governmental body, national or local, executive, legis lative, or judicial, asserted was the will of God. When, therefore, the Christians from the Old World settled on these shores, it was taken for granted that they would be governed by the laws of God as set forth in his Bible and transmitted to them through the appropriate organs of government, theocratic for a time in New England or secular elsewhere. It was quite natural too, that, in the enactment of statutes or the judicial enforcement of laws, the deity should be invoked, not merely in respect to those dealing with obviously religious matters, such as heresy or blasphemy (which included utterance of "any reproachful speeches concerning the LEO PFEFFER (B.S.S., City College of New York; J.D., New York University) is Professor of Constitutional Law, Long Island University, Brooklyn, New York, and Special Counsel, American Jewish Congress.

Williams's influence on American constitutional history is mani fest in the writings of Baptists such as Isaac Backus, who asserted that "religion is a concern between God and the soul with which no human authority can intermeddle,"8 and John Leland9 among oth ers. All in all the Baptists were by far, but by no means the only conventional major religious group that could claim credit for the exclusion of religion and man's relationship to God from the juris diction of civil government; Presbyterians10 and Lutherans11 among others shared in this successful endeavor. Parallel to the efforts of Baptists and other religious groups, and leading to the end result were those of individuals, generally called Deists, whose religious commitments were almost diametrically opposite those of the pietistic Baptists. As Baptists inherited the spirit of Williams, the Deists, such as Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Thomas Paine, inherited and reflected the views of John Locke. It was through them that the principles expressed in Locke's Letter Concerning Toleration became the foundation of the Constitution's ban on religious tests for governmental office and the First Amendment's exclusion from governmental authority of laws respecting an establishment of religion or forbidding its free exercise.12 5.

Yet that comparatively short document, penned by Jefferson, contained no less than four refer ences to or invocations of the Deity—"God," "Creation," "Su preme Judge of the World," and "divine Providence." The explanation, it may be suggested, lies in the reality of political life dictating that so revolutionary a document addressed "to the opinions of mankind," must appeal to and be accepted by the greatest number of the American people. Ironically, this felt neces sity impelled Jefferson to violate the principles, expressed a decade later by his disciple Madison in his "Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessment," that government may not "employ religion as an engine of civil policy."13 The tensions between prin ciple and political reality are manifest in the duality of '' nature" and "nature's God" in the opening paragraph of the Declaration. The multiplicity of references to the Deity in the Declaration reflects similar invocations in the proclamations and other state papers of the Continental Congress. These unabashedly exhibited a belief in Trinitarian Protestantism. Congress continually invoked, as sanction for its acts, the name of "God," "Almighty God," "Nature's God," "God of Armies," "Lord of Hosts," "His Good ness," "God's Superintending Providence," "Providence of God," "Providence," "Supreme and Universal Providence," "Overrul ing Providence of God," "Creator of All," "Indulgent Creator," "Great Governor of the World," "The Divinity," "Supreme Dis poser of All Events," "Holy Ghost," "Jesus Christ," "Christian Religion," "Free Protestant Colonies," and other expressions of devout Christian Protestantism.14 In stark contrast is the document penned some eleven years after the Declaration of Independence and adopted as the Constitution of the United States. Neither the preamble, which set forth the pur pose of the proposed national government, nor the body of the document makes any reference to the Deity. The only reference to religion in it, and that in an exclusionary rather than endorsing context, is found at the end of the last operative section, which forbids religious tests as a qualification for public office. The omission of a reference to the Deity was not inadvertent; nor did it remain unnoticed. A delegate to the Connecticut ratifying 13.

'We the people of the United States, in a firm belief of the being and perfection of the one living and true God, the creator and supreme Governor of the world, in his universal providence and the authority of his laws . . . doordain, etc.'"15 Atameetingof Congregationalists in June 1788 a request was presented "that some suitable Testimony might be borne against the sinful omission in the late Federal Constitution in not looking to God for direction, and of omitting the mention of the name of God in the Constitution."16 These were not the only expressions of dissatisfaction with the omission of the name of God in the Constitution, but it was not this omission that was the major fault found with the document. On the contrary, what concerned them most was the omission of a Bill of Rights, and it was only in reliance upon the defenders' promise that a bill would be added after ratification that the requisite number of states voted for ratification. To meet the situation and fulfill the promise, a legislative committee, under Madison's leadership, drafted the Bill of Rights which was to become the first ten amend ments to the Constitution. The opening words of the bill, "Con gress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' ' constituted a seal of approval rather than a repudiation of the absence of reference to the Deity in the Constitution.17 It should be noted that references to the Deity in state constitu tions today are common, and included among them are the constitu tions of states which were part of the Union when it was originally established as well as those who joined thereafter.18 As a practical matter there is no way by which the constitutionality of this practice can be challenged in the federal courts, since its mere presence, as its presence on our coins and currency, in a legal sense injures no one. In any event, it is quite clear that irrespective of the practice in the state constitutions, the American people are not eager to amend the federal Constitution to incorporate a reference to an invocation of the Deity. Efforts to achieve this have, during our history, been tried from 15. Ibid., p. 406. 16. Ibid. 17. Irving Brant, lames Madison, 6 vols. (New York: Bobbs-Merrill Co., 1941-61), 3:271. 18.

In 1863, representatives from eleven Protestant denominations organized the National Reform Association20 (later known as the Christian Amendment Movement21) with the purpose, among others, of amending the Constitution so as to "declare the Nation's allegiance to Jesus Christ and its acceptance of the moral laws of the Christian religion, and to indicate that this is a Christian nation, and place all Christian laws, institutions and usages of our government on an undeniably legal basis in the fundamental law of the land." The proposal to declare the United States "a Christian nation" was in a sense a progressive step, for it encompassed not only Protestant heretics, such as Roger Williams, Anne Hutchinson, and the Quakers, but even Roman Catholics (who, having become so numerous, could hardly be ignored). It was predicated on the assumption, strongly contested by Jefferson (who condemned it as a "judicial forging" and a "conspiracy between church and state"),22 that Christianity is part of the common law, and, therefore, is recognizable as such in the American legal system, which is based upon the common law. As will be noted later, as recently as 1978 the Kentucky legislature enacted a law declaring that the Ten Com mandments are part of the common law of the United States. Nor should it be assumed that this assertion was entirely without judicial acceptance. It had the imprimature of a unanimous Supreme Court, speaking through Joseph Story in the case of Vidal v. Girard's Executors,23 decided in 1843. In his opinion, Story, whose monumental Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States was for a century deemed by courts and scholars to be the most authorita tive study of constitutional law, left no doubt as to his views on the status of Christianity and its Deity in our constitution and laws. To Story it was clear that "the Christian religion is part of the common law," and he cited in support of this assertion the provision in the constitution of Pennsylvania where the Girard case arose, that "all men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences." 19.

Theanticlericalism,orat least suspicion of clericalism, manifested in this case was quite common in the early days of the Republic; see McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U.S. 618 (1978), wherein the Court invalidated an early Tennessee statute disqualifying clergymen from serving in the state legislature.</page><page sequence="6">220 JOURNAL OF CHURCH AND STATE The case involved a testamentary grant for the establishment of an educational institution for orphans with the proviso that "no eccle siastic, missionary, or member of any sect whatsoever, shall ever hold or exercise any station or duty whatever in said college." The Supreme Court upheld the validity of this provision on the ground that Girard had not impugned or repudiated Christianity, nor had he barred the teaching of the Christian religion, but directed only that the teaching not be done by clergymen but rather by adequately trained and competent lay teachers. It is worthwhile here to recall the somewhat lengthy extract from the Court's opinion: It is also said, and truly, that the Christian religion is a part of the common law of Pennsylvania. But this proposition is to be received with its appropriate qualifica tions, and in connection with the bill of rights of that state, as found in its constitution of government. The constitution of 1790 . . . expressly declares, "That all men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences; no man can of right be compelled to attend, erect, or support any place of worship or to maintain any ministry against his consent; no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience; and no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishments or modes of worship. " Language more comprehensive for the complete protection of every variety of religious opinion could scarcely be used; and it must have been intended to extend equally to all sects, whether they believed in Christianity or not, and whether they were Jews or infidels. So that we are compelled to admit that although Christianity be a part of the common law of the state, yet it is so in this qualified sense, that its divine origin and truth are admitted, and therefore it is not to be maliciously and openly reviled and blasphemed against, to the annoyance of believers or the injury of the public. ... It is unnecessary for us, however, to consider what would be the legal effect of a device in Pennsylvania for the establishment of a school or college for the propagation of Judaism, or Deism, or any other form of infidelity. Such a case is not to be presumed to exist in a Christian country; and therefore it must be made out by clear and indisputable proof. I shall return later to the comment on "Judaism or Deism or any other form of infidelity" and the presumption that a bequest to them "is not to be presumed to exist in a Christian country." It is, however, necessary to point out here that in this case Story was speaking about the constitution of Pennsylvania rather than that of the United States. That his views in respect to the latter were not different is evidenced by the following:24 Probably at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, and of the [first] amend ment to it now under consideration, the general if not the universal sentiment in America was, that Christianity ought to receive encouragement from the state so far as was not incompatible with the private rights of conscience and the freedom of 24. Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, 3 vols. (Boston: Hilliard, Gray and Co., 1833), 3:725.</page><page sequence="7">THE DEITY IN AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY 221 religious worship. An attempt to level all religions, and to make it a matter of state policy to hold all in utter indifference, would have created universal disapproba tion, if not universal indignation. . . . The real object of the amendment was not to countenance, much less to advance, Mahometanism, or Judaism, or infidelity, by prostrating Christianity; but to exclude all rivalry among Christian sects, and to prevent any national ecclesiastical establishment which should give to an hierarchy the exclusive patronage of the national government. A half century after the Vidal case was decided, the Court again declared that our nation and its Constitution reflect commitment to the Christian religion and its deity. In the case before it, Church of Holy Trinity v. United States,25 the Court ruled that an act of Con gress prohibiting the importation of foreigners "under contract or agreement to perform labor in the United States" was not intended to prohibit a church from contracting with an English clergyman to migrate to this country and act as its rector and pastor. The statute, the Court said, was aimed at the breakdown of domestic wage standards by the importation of foreign manual laborers under contract to work off their passage at an agreed substandard rate. However, again in an unanimous opinion, the Court felt it neces sary to reaffirm the determination that we are a Christian people and that recognition of the Christian deity comports fully to American tradition and constitutional standards. In support of this assertion the Court referred, with obvious approval, to typical provisions in state constitutions. Among these was the Mississippi Constitution of 1832 which stated that "no person who denies the being of a God, or a future state of rewards and punishments, shall hold any office in the civil departments of this State." Another was the following oath required in the Delaware Constitution of all state employees; "I profess faith in God the Father, and in Jesus Christ His only Son, and in the Holy Ghost, One God, blessed for evermore, and I do acknowledge the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament to be given by divine inspiration." Following the example of Justice Story, the Court's opinion in Church of Holy Trinity sets forth a list of instances establishing that "this is a Christian nation": among others, the provision in Article One, Section Seven of the federal Constitution that excepts Sunday in the ten-day period during which the President may approve or veto a bill of Congress; the universally prevailing form of oath of office concluding with an appeal to the Almighty ("so help me 25. 143 U.S. 457 (1892); see also Church of Latter-day Saints v. United States, 136 U.S. 1 ( 1890), wherein the Court said, "The organization of a community for the spread and practice of polygamy is, in a measure, a return to barbarism.

The next litany witnessing the godliness of our nation and our Constitution came from a rather surprising source. In the history of the Supreme Court there has probably been no member more abso lutist in his views regarding the First Amendment's mandates of church-state separation and the free exercise of religion than Justice William O. Douglas. He was the sole dissenter in the decisions upholding the constitutionality of Sunday-closing laws.26 He alone dissented from the Court's 1970 decision in Walz v. Tax Commis sion17 upholding the constitutionality of laws exempting church owned properties from taxation. While he concurred in the Court's 1947 decision in Everson v. Board of Education28 upholding the constitutionality of laws authorizing state payments for the costs of transporting pupils to parochial schools, he thereafter regretted his concurrence (saying in his concurring opinion in Engel v. Vitale29 that the "Everson case seems in retrospect to be out of line with the First Amendment") and steadfastly voted against any measure aimed at extending the Everson holding beyond subsidization of school transportation, such as, for example, by public financing of secular textbooks for parochial school use.30 Despite all this, Justice Douglas was the author of the majority opinion in the 1952 case of Zorach v. Clauson, 31 upholding the constitutionality of a statute authorizing the release during school hours of pupils wishing to participate in religious instruction con ducted off public school premises. A good distance had been traveled since the assertions were made in the earlier cases that we are a Christian nation. "We are," he said instead, "a religious people,"32 thus broadening the boundaries of permissible governmental benef icence in legislation to encompass adherents of "Judaism, Deism, or any other form of infidelity," to whom Justice Story was not ready to accord equal treatment under the First Amendment. The use by Douglas of the term "religious people" rather than 26. McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420 (1961); Two Guys from Harrison-Allentown v.

Macintosh, 33in holding that a religiously motivated pacifist could be denied citizenship for refusing to take an oath that he would in all cases bear arms in defense of the nation, asserting rather that he would do so only in instances where he believed the war to be morally justified, the Supreme Court ventured into the arena of theology and undertook to correct Macintosh on what really was the will of God. The Court said: When he speaks of putting his allegiance to the will of God above his allegiance to the government, it is evident, in the light of his entire statement, that he means to make his own interpretation of the will of God the decisive test which shall conclude the government and stay its hand. We are a Christian people, according to one another the equal right of religious freedom, and acknowledging with reverence the duty of obedience to the will of God. But, also, we are a nation with the duty to survive; a nation whose Constitution contemplates war as well as peace; whose government must go forward upon the assumption, and safely can proceed upon no other, that unqualified allegiance to the nation and submission and obedience to the laws of the land, as well those made for war as those made for peace, are not inconsistent with the will of God.34 TheMacintosh case will be examined further later in this essay. It is quoted here only to note the assertion that ours is a Christian nation, a claim which today is heard considerably less frequently than in earlier years. We hear instead that we are a pluralistic society, but almost invariably today the term "Judeo-Christian" is used synonymously for "pluralistic." The frequent use of this term indicates the great influence that the Jews, notwithstanding their small percentage of the population, have exercised on American political and cultural values. Y et, it may be suggested, to say that the United States is a Judeo-Christian nation is as inconsistent with the spirit of the First Amendment as to say it is a Christian nation. Roger Williams asserted that "no civil state or country can be truly called Christian, although the Christians be in it."35 Likewise, no civil state or country committed to the First Amendment can be called Judeo-Christian, although Christians and Jews be in it. Returning to Justice Douglas's opinion in Zorach v. Clauson, note should be taken of his statement in it that "we are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being." To support this assertion and the constitutionality of its recognition in our public school system he states that were this not so: 33. 283 U.S. 60S (1971). 34. Ibid., p. 62S. 35. Cited in James E.

Policemen who helped parishioners into their places of worship would violate the Constitution. Prayers in our legislative halls; the appeals to the Almighty in the messages of the Chief Executive; the proclamations making Thanksgiving Day a holiday; "so help me God" in our courtroom oaths—these and all other references to the Almighty that run through our laws, our public rituals, our ceremonies would be flouting the First Amendment. A fastidious atheist or agnostic could even object to the supplication with which the Court opens each session: "God save the United States and this Honorable Court."36 Less than a month after the Court handled down its decision in Zorach v. Clauson, it announced its decision in Burstyn v. Wilson,v wherein it interpreted the First Amendment in respect to the Divin ity in an opinion that points in a direction opposite to its ruling in Zorach v. Clauson and in the other cases that have been discussed here. The colonists who settled on these shores found no difficulties in promulgating laws against blasphemy and sacrilege, even though many of them came here to escape such laws in England. These laws became quite common in the United States, and although the Court had stated in the 1872 case of Watson v. Jones that in this country "the law knows no heresy and is committed to the support of no dogma,"38 this was not deemed to proscribe laws aimed at blas phemy or sacrilege. Burstyn v. Wilson39 involved such a law. Its terms required the granting of a license to all films except those that were in whole or part "obscene, indecent, immoral, inhuman [or] sacrilegious." Act ing under that law, the New York authorities revoked a license that had been issued for the exhibition of a motion picture entitled The Miracle. The picture dealt with a poor, simple-minded girl who had been seduced and impregnated by a bearded stranger she believed to have been Joseph, the husband of Mary, the mother of Jesus. The license was revoked after a strong denunciation of the film and its licensing by Francis Joseph Cardinal Spellman and by Catholic organizations that condemned it as blasphemous in that it impugned the virgin birth of Jesus.40 The revocation was challenged in the courts on the ground that it violated the First Amendment's guaranty of freedom of speech and its prohibition of laws respecting an establishment of religion and forbidding its free exercise. The Court chose to base its decision, 343 U.S. at 312-13. 343 U.S. 495 (1952). 13 Wall. (80 U.S.) 679 at 728 (1872). 343 U.S. 495 (1952).

As to the latter, however, it noted that under the standard of "sacrilege," the most careful and tolerant censor would find it virtually impossible to avoid favoring one religion over another, and he would be subject to an inevitable tendency to ban the expression of unpopular sentiments sacred to a religious minority. Application of the "sacrilegious" [sic] test, in these or other respects, might raise substantial questions under the First Amendment's guaranty of sepa rate church and state with freedom of worship for all. However, from the stand point of freedom of speech and the press, it is enough to point out that the state has no legitimate interest in protecting any or all religions from views distasteful to them which is sufficient to justify prior restraints upon the expression of those views. It is not the business of government in our nation to suppress real or imagined attacks upon a particular religious doctrine, whether they appeal in publications, speeches, or motion pictures.41 It bears noting that New York's highest court, in upholding the statute authorizing the revocation, stated that there was "nothing mysterious" in it. What was meant by the word "sacrilegious" was that "no religion as that word is understood by the ordinary, rea sonable person, shall be treated with contempt, mockery, scorn or ridicule."42 Yet as far as is known, neither the New York statute nor any similar one has ever been invoked in New York or elsewhere against any religion other than the Christian faith. In any event, Torcasov. Wat kins,43 decided in 1961, made it clear that no divinity, Christian, Jewish, or other, could constitutionally receive govern mental protection against blasphemy, sacrilege, or atheism. Maryland's constitution, challenged in that case, copied Article Six of the federal Constitution in providing that "no religious test ought ever be required for any office of profit or trust in this State," but qualified it by adding the words "other than a declaration of belief in the existence of God." Torcaso, an atheist, was appointed to the office of Notary Public but was refused his commission to serve because he would not declare a belief in the existence of God. Appealing to the Supreme Court, Torcaso cited its 1948 decision in the case of McCollum v. Board of Education.44 There, the Court, in invalidating under the Establishment Clause a law providing for the devotional teaching of religion in the public schools, declared that "no person can be punished for entertaining religious beliefs or disbeliefs, for church attendance or non-attendance."45 The Mary 343 U.S. at SOS (1952). 303 N.Y. 242 at 258. 367 U.S. 488(1961). 333 U.S. 203 (1948).

Clauson46 and cited in support of this ruling the statement in Justice Douglas's opinion in that case that "we are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being."47 If a personal note may be interjected here, this writer was Tor caso' s attorney in this case and he saw (or perhaps imagined he saw) Justice Douglas wince when the state's attorney general read that sentence in his oral argument to the Court. In any event, Justice Hugo Black, the author of theMcCollum opinion (holding unconsti tutional religious instruction in the public schools) who shared Justice Douglas's commitment to the absolute separation of church and state, would not accept it. In the opinion which he wrote for the Court in Torcaso's case, he quoted the sentence in Zorach v. Clauson that "we follow the McCollum case." We repeat and again reaffirm [he said] that neither a State nor the Federal government can constitutionally force a person to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion. Neither can constitutionally pass laws or impose requirements which aid all religions as against non-believers, and neither can aid those religions based on a belief in the existence of God as against those religions founded on different beliefs.48 Ina footnote at this point, Justice Black said: "Among religions in this country which do not teach what would generally be considered a belief in the existence of God are Buddhism, Taoism, Ethical Culture, Secular Humanism and others."49 This footnote was hardly relevant to Torcaso's case, since he did not claim to be an adherent of any of these religions or of any other. It is, however, relevant to this article, which deals with the subject of the Deity in American constitutional history, in that it accords equal protection to deistic and nondeistic religions. A year after the Torcaso ruling, the Court handed down its deci sion in Engel v. Vitale. 50 That case dealt with the constitutionality of the recitation by public school pupils of a twenty-two-word prayer formulated by the New York State Board of Regents. The prayer read as follows: "Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our country." The prayer had been cleared in advance with authoritative New 343 U.S. 306(1952). Ibid., p. 313. Torcaso v. IVatkins, 367 U.S. 488 at 495 (1961).

In view of the footnote already cited in the Torcaso case, this would seem to be hardly relevant. Nor, in view of thtMcCollum decision, would it be relevant that pupils' participation in the prayer recitation was purportedly entirely voluntary, in that dissenting children could remain silent or be excused from the room. Never theless, the New York Court of Appeals upheld the practice on these grounds.51 The Supreme Court decided otherwise. Neither of these facts, it held, immunized the practice from nullification under the Estab lishment Clause. Nor, the Court said, was it either sacrilegious or antireligious "to say that each separate government in this country should stay out of the business of writing or sanctioning official prayers and leave that purely religious function to the people them selves and to those the people choose to look to for religious guidance."52 A year later, in the case of Abington Township School District v. Schempp,53 the Court was again faced with the need to pass upon the constitutionality of invoking the Divinity through prayer in the public schools. Also involved in that case was a challenge to the practice of reading verses from the Bible at the opening of public school sessions each morning. Somewhat surprisingly, but perhaps understandably in view of J ustice Potter Stewart's dissent in Engel v. Vitale54 and the hostile reaction that decision received in many parts of the U nited States and particularly in the South,55 J ustice Thomas Clark, in his opinion for the Court, felt it necessary to recite the ritual litany of godliness in governmental actions. (Justice Stewart's dissent in Engel had recited the stanza in the national anthem stating that "In God we trust," the 1954 act of Congress which added the words "under God" in our Pledge of Allegiance, the presence of the phrase "In God We Trust" on our coins, and the act of Congress calling upon the President to proclaim each year a National Day of Prayer.56) The fact [the Court's opinion in the Schempp case said] that the Founding Fathers believed devotedly that there was a God and that the unalienable rights of man were rooted in Him is clearly evidenced in their writings, from the Mayflower Compact 10 N.Y. 2d 174 äff g 11 A.D. 2d 340 affg 18 Mise. 2d 659. 370 U.S. at 425. 374 U.S. 203 (1963). 371 U.S. at 444.

This background is evidenced today in our public life through the continuance in our oaths of office from the Presidency to the Alder man of the final supplication, "So help me God." Likewise each House of Congress provides through its Chaplain an opening prayer, and the sessions of this Court are declared open by the crier in a short ceremony, the final phrase of which invokes the grace of God. Again, there are such manifestations in our military forces, where those of our citizens who are under the restrictions of military service wish to engage in voluntary worship. Indeed, only last year an official survey of the country indicated that 64% of our people have church membership, while less than 3% profess no religion whatever. It can be truly said, therefore, that today, as in the beginning, our national life reflects a religious people who, in the words of Madi son, are "earnestly praying, as. . .in duty bound, that the Supreme Lawgiver of the Universe . . . guide them into every measure which may be worthy of his [bless ing. . . ]." Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments.57 Justice Clark's reference to God in the Constitution is puzzling. It may refer to the provision excluding Sundays in counting the ten days in which the President has to veto an act of Congress. Perhaps it also referred to the following paragraph which appears after the text of the Constitution: "Done in convention by the unanimous consent of the States present the Seventeenth day of September in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty seven, and of the independence of the United States of America the Twelfth. In witness whereof we have hereunto subscribed our names." If these are what Justice Clark had in mind, they seem to exclude not only Jews, who do not accept Jesus Christ as "our Lord," but also those Christians who observe Saturday as the divinely ordained day of rest. Notwithstanding this ritual recitation, the Court in its decision determined that both practices, reciting the Lord's Prayer and reading the Bible, violated the First Amendment. The Court paid little attention to the efforts made by counsel for school authorities to prove that the Engel holding should be distinguished in that the prayer involved therein was formulated by the state Board of Regents, whereas the Lord's Prayer was in the Bible, universally acknowledged as a great work of literature. It was obvious to the Court that the recitation and reading were acts of worship and not exercises in literature. Prayer which was neither church-formulated (as in Schempp) nor government-formulated (as in Enget) fared no better. In DeKalb School District v. DeSpain,58 a federal court in 1967 frowned upon what was known as the "cookie prayer," so called because it was recited by the kindergarten children before their morning snack. 57. 374 U.S. at 213-14. 58. 255 F.

The kindergarten teacher in Elwood Public School in DeKalb County, Illinois, was no lawyer, but she must have had some inkling of the Engel and Schempp decisions, for she sought to make the prayer constitutionally permissible by making it Godless. The words of the prayer which she led her pupils in reciting were: We thank you for the flowers so sweet; We thank you for the food we eat; We thank you for the birds that sing; We thank you for everything. This revision obviously sacrificed the rhythm of the original and must have left at least some of the children puzzled as to who was the "you" they addressed. The sacrifice, however, proved futile; the court issued an injunction against the now presumably Godless prayer and the Supreme Court refused to upset the decision. Relevance to the subject of this paper, the Deity in American constitutional history, requires mention of the Supreme Court's 1968 decision in Epperson v. Arkansas.59 Like the present-day cru sade by Senator Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), the Moral Majority, and others to nullify the Engel and Schempp decisions and restore prayer to the public schools, efforts to reintroduce what is essentially the biblical account of creation under the title "scientific creationism" as an alternative to the theory of evolution indicate that the issue is a live one today.60 In the Epperson case, the Court held violative of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause a state statute making it unlawful for a teacher in any state-supported school or university to teach the theory or doctrine that mankind ascended or descended from a lower order of animals, or "to adopt or use in any such institution a textbook that teaches" this theory. Just as the "cookie prayer" in the Dekalb School case sought, unsuccessfully, to avoid judicial invalidation by omitting the word "God" from the challenged prayer, so the Arkansas legislature sought to reach that end by making no direct reference to the Deity. The effort was no more successful than the earlier one, as is indi cated by the following paragraph from the Epperson decision. 59. 393 U.S. 97(1968). 60. Wendell R.

No suggestion has been made that Arkansas' law may be justified by considerations of state policy other than the religious views of some of its citizens. It is clear that fundamentalist sectarian conviction was and is the law's reason for existence. Its antecedent, Tennessee's "monkey law," candidly stated its purpose: to make it unlawful "to teach any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals." Perhaps the sensational publicity attendant upon the Scopes trial induced Arkansas to adopt less explicit language. It eliminated Tennessee's reference to "the story of the Divine Creation of man" as taught in the Bible, but there is no doubt that the motivation for the law was the same: to suppress the teaching of a theory which, it was thought, "denied" the divine creation of man.61 Attention must also be given to the subject of the Deity and military service in war and in peace. As noted in the Macintosh case the Court dismissed as presumptuous and unacceptable the asser tion that an individual may make his own interpretation of God's will and that it is the government alone that may rightfully make such a claim.62 This may be true in respect to England where the head of the state is simultaneously the head of the church and perhaps could claim infallibility in that capacity. It is obviously not true in respect to a nation whose constitution forbids laws respecting an establishment of religion or prohibitions on its free exercise. American policy is predicated upon the principle that in order to secure a republican form of government it is necessary to separate secular powers among its three branches, but none of them nor all of them together are competent to discern or legislate what is the will of the Deity. If the First Amendment and the ban on religious tests for governmental office mean anything, they mean that no agency of government has the constitutional power to determine what is God's will and trans late that will into the law of the land. This, indeed, was what the Supreme Court ruled in the 1872 case of Watson v.Jones,63 wherein it held that no legislature or court may constitutionally determine which of two factions in a church schism truly represents the will of God according to the doctrines of the particular church. There the Court said: "In this country the full and free right to entertain any religious belief, to entertain any religious principle, and to teach any religious doctrine which does 61. 393 U.S. at 107-9. 62.

The law knows no heresy, and is committed to the support of no dogma, the establish ment of no sect."64 What, then, did the Court have in mind with respect to the statement made in the Macintosh case? It is simply this: there are certain arenas where the government may intervene and overrule an individual's claim to the free exercise of religion. Child sacrifice is an obvious example, and the courts have universally held that the states have the power to authorize blood transfusions where neces sary to save the life of a child even though the parents believe that the procedure would violate God's command forbidding the drinking of blood.65 If religious conscience and commitment to God's will can be overruled where necessary to save the life of one child, the same is certainly true where the life of a nation is at stake. Yet, from the earliest days of our nation (and even before that, in Cromwell's England), persons whose religious doctrine forbade participation in armed conflict were exempt from military service by the laws in some states and by the Continental Congress. This, however, the Court has ruled, was a matter of legislative grace, not constitutional right, and what Congress gives Congress can take back or can limit or qualify.66 Thus, the first national exemption of conscientious objectors adopted by Congress during the Civil War was limited to members of well-recognized religious denominations whose articles of faith forbade the bearing of arms.67 So, too, was the exemption accorded by the conscription law enacted at the time of America's entry into World War I. Exemp tion was allowed only to those who were affiliated with well recognized religious sects, the creed or principles of which forbade their members to participate "in war in any form." Lest new sects arise to provide a shelter for unwilling draftees, the law limited the exemption to sects already existing at the time it was enacted, and to prevent existing sects from altering their doctrine for the same purpose, the law also required that the creed of principle against military service be in existence when the law was passed.68 The intended beneficiaries of these exemption laws were the long-established peace denominations, such as the Friends and 64.

Y et the genius of American freedoms is individualistic rather than corporate; the opening words of the Bill of Rights reflect a suspicion of, if not antipathy to, religious establishments. The 1940 selective service law, enacted upon the eve of America's entry into World War II, liberalized the exemption to make it more consistent with the American genius. It no longer required mem bership in a particular sect, but granted the exemption to anyone who by "reason of religious training and belief" possessed conscien tious scruples against "participation in war in any form." Congress, however, had no intention of extending the mantle of protection to political, intellectual, humanist, or other nonreligious objectors to war. To make this clear, it again amended the law in 1948 to state explicitly that "religious training and belief in this connection means an individual's belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation, but does not include essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code." So amended, the law gave rise to some difficult constitutional questions. In the first place, religion and belief in God are not necessarily synonymous. As has been noted, the Court was later to point out in Torcaso v. Wat kins ,69 there are ancient, well-recognized religions that are not theistic, such as Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism. A military exemption law limited to adherents of the Christian faith would obviously be unconstitutional; so too would be one which specifically excluded Buddhists, Taoists, and Confucian ists. Yet this was what was effected by requiring a belief in God as a condition to exemption. The concept of God as generally under stood in this country is basically Judeo-Christian (and Islamic), and, under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, Congress could no more prefer these religions over nontheistic faiths than it could prefer Christianity over Judaism or Protestantism over Catholicism. A second constitutional difficulty arose from the fact that the law imposes upon civil officials the duty of making theological determi nations and, moreover, gives them no standards or guidelines by which to make them. How is a draft board to decide whether that in which a particular applicant for exemption believes is a " Supreme Being?" Does he have to believe in the God of the Old Testament or the New Testament or the Koran or all three? Does his belief have to be fundamentalist in essence or may it be liberal and modernist? Finally, even if the draft boards were to take a liberal position as to 69. 367 U.S. 488 (1961).</page><page sequence="19">THE DEITY IN AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY 233 what constitutes God and were also to accept as religious training and belief, within the meaning of the exemption, training and belief in nontheistic religions, a constitutional problem would still remain. The Establishment Clause, the Court has held on numerous occa sions, does not impose a mandate of neutrality merely as among different religions, but also as between religion and nonreligion. The government may not prefer all religions over nonreligions any more than it may prefer one or some religions over others.70 These were some of the difficulties facing the Court in 1965 in three cases decided under the name of United States v. Seeger.71 Before considering these cases, something should be said about the meaning of the phrase conditioning exemption on possession of conscientious scruples against "participation in war in any form." The issue arose in 1955 in Sicurella v. United States 71 involving a member of the Jehovah's Witnesses and thus "in the Army of Christ Jesus serving as a soldier of Jehovah's appointed Commander Jesus Christ." Inasmuch as the war weapons of the soldier of Jesus Christ were not carnal, he was not authorized by his Commander to engage in the carnal warfare of this world. However, the literature of the Jehovah's Witnesses extolled the ancient wars of the Israelites, asserted that Witnesses would engage in a "theocratic war" if Jehovah so commanded them, and declared that they would fight at Armageddon. On the basis of this evidence, the draft board ruled that Sicurella was not entitled to exemption, but the Supreme Court felt other wise. As to theocratic war, the Court stated that his willingness to fight on the orders of Jehovah was tempered by the fact that, as far as is known, the Witnesses' history records no such command since biblical times and their theology does not contemplate one in the future. While the Witnesses expected to fight at Armageddon, they would do so without carnal weapons, and Congress had in mind real shooting wars—"actual military conflicts between nations of the earth in our time—wars with bombs and bullets, tanks, planes and rockets."73 Returning to the difficulties facing the Court in the Seeger case, it appears that the explanation lies in the fact that it met them by first taking God out of religion and then taking religion out of religion. Seeger, in applying for exemption, admitted his "skepticism or 70. Everson s.Board ofEducation, 330 U.S. 1, IS McCoIlum v.

Ibid., p. 391.</page><page sequence="20">234 JOURNAL OF CHURCH AND STATE disbelief in the existence of God," but avowed a "belief in and devotion to goodness and virtue for their own sakes and a religious faith in a purely ethical creed," and cited Plato, Aristotle, and Spinoza in support of such belief. Jakobson, another applicant, stated a belief in "Godness horizontally through Mankind and the World," rather than "vertically, towards Godness directly." The third applicant, Peter, avowed a commitment to religion defined as "the supreme expression of human nature; man thinking his high est, feeling his deepest, living his best." The Court held that all three applicants were entitled to exemp tion since all had the requisite "religious training and belief in relation to a Supreme Being." By using the term "Supreme Being" rather than "God," the Court said, Congress intended something much broader than the traditional personal Deity. As for the term "religious belief," that is one which "is sincere and meaningful and occupies a place in the life of its possessor parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in God of one who clearly qualifies for the exemption."74 What this meant is that depth and sincerity can be substituted for dogma and creedal affiliation. The decision assumed the importance of being earnest, but not necessarily of being religious, at least as that word would be understood by the man in the street. By holding that the three applicants all qualified under the exemption, the Court was able to avoid deciding whether the exemption itself was constitutional. Yet it is doubtful that Congress really meant what the Court said it did. The terms "God" and "Supreme Being" are generally considered synonymous. The Declaration of Independ ence uses the terms "Nature's God," "Creator," "Supreme Judge of the World," and "divine Providence," and certainly did not mean different things in each case. Why, then, did not the Court unambiguously adjudge unconsti tutional a law which accords a privilege to believers in God, by whatever synonym Congress chooses to use, and denies it to those who do not? As already noted, this, indeed, is just what the Court did in the Torcaso case decided four years earlier. The answer in the concurring opinion of Justice Douglas is stated with the frankness characteristic of him; were the Court to have interpreted the exemp tion as Congress intended, it probably would have had to invalidate it just as it had done in the Torcaso case: The legislative history of this Act leaves much in the dark. But it is, in my opinion, not a tour de force if we construe the words "Supreme Being" to include the cosmos, 74. 380 U.S. at 165-66.</page><page sequence="21">THE DEITY IN AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY 235 as well as an anthropomorphic entity. If it is a tour de force so to hold, it is no more so than other instances where we have gone to extremes to construe an Act of Congress to save it from demise on constitutional grounds. In a more extreme case than the present one we said that the words of a statute may be strained "in the candid service of avoiding a serious constitutional doubt."75 Ironically, even under the Court's finding of a legislative intent to differentiate between Supreme Being and God, at least two of the three draftees, Seeger and Peter, would not have qualified for exemption since both refused to answer affirmatively the question whether they believed in a Supreme Being. Yet, the troublesome question of constitutionality will not go away. At the present writing there are two cases now before the Supreme Court as yet undecided which may ultimately require it to pass upon that issue. The first of these is the case of Thomas v. Indiana Employment Security Division.76 It involves a Jehovah's Witness who left his job because the company for which he worked became engaged primar ily in the manufacture of weapons. The Court will have to decide whether a state can constitutionally deny unemployment compensa tion benefits to one who, by reason of his religious conscience, will not participate in the manufacture of weapons of war.77 The second case is Rostker v. Goldberg.78 That involves a challenge to the draft registration law enacted in 1980 upon the recommenda tion of President Jimmy Carter. The President asked that the regis tration be required of persons of both sexes and it made no exception in respect to those whose religious conscience forbade participation in any action relating to armed conflict, including registration. Congress, however, chose to limit the registration to males, and it is only this issue of sexual discrimination that is now before the Court in the Rostker case. The Court may uphold the statute as written; or it may agree with the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing Gold berg, that it is invalid on the ground of sexual discrimination. Should the latter alternative eventuate, it is almost certain that in view of the present tensions in respect to the Soviet Union and other communist countries, Congress will amend the law to include women. In either event, the issue whether requiring registration on 75. Ibid., p. 188. 76. No. 79-852. 77.

This writer has been instructed by the Jewish Peace Fellow ship and the Fellowship of Reconciliation, in whose behalf he filed an amicus brief in the Thomas case, to institute a suit challenging as violative of the Free Exercise Clause the compulsory registration imposed upon conscientious objectors. In view of the Court's disposition of the constitutional issue in the Seeger case, it can be assumed that the Court will be able to find a way to avoid deciding that issue in either the Thomas case or in the one which will be brought in behalf of the Jewish Peace Fellowship and the Fellowship of Reconciliation, should it wish to do so. The efforts to return God to the public schools through prayer have been discussed earlier in this essay. Prayer, however, is not the only means through which this end has been pursued. The most recent opinion that the Supreme Court has issued on the subject concerns not prayer but the Ten Commandments.79 At issue was a 1978 law enacted by the Kentucky legislature providing that a copy of the Ten Commandments be posted on the wall of every elemen tary and secondary public school classroom in the state. Perhaps in an effort to exorcise the spirit of unconstitutionality, the legislature added two sections to the measure. The first read: "In small print below the last commandment shall appear a notation concerning the purpose of the display, as follows: 'The secular application of the Ten Commandments is clearly seen in its adoption as the funda mental legal code of Western Civilization and the Common Law of the United States.'" The second read: "The copies required by this Act shall be purchased with funds made available through voluntary contributions made to the state treasurer for the purposes of this Act." It should be noted that the two provisions really contradict each other. If the purpose of the law was secular, there was no reason to mandate that tax-raised funds not be used in achieving it. On the other hand, if it was religious, then, as the Court later said in its decision holding the law unconstitutional, "the mere posting of the copies under the auspices of the legislation providefd] the official support of the State" in violation of the Establishment Clause. Echoing Roger Williams's Law of the Two Tables, in respect to man's obligations to the Divinity, the Court said: The Commandments do not confine themselves to arguably secular matters, such as honoring one's parents, killing or murder, adultery, stealing, false witness, and 79. Stone v. Graham, 101 S. Ct. 192 (1980).</page><page sequence="23">THE DEITY IN AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY 237 covetousness. See Exodus 20:12-17; Deuteronomy 5; 16-21. Rather, the first part of the Commandments concerns the religious duties of believers: worshipping the Lord God alone, avoiding idolatry, not using the Lord's name in vain, and observ ing the sabbath day. See Exodus 20:1-11 ; Deuteronomy 5:6-15.80 While the effort to return the Deity to governmental institutions is most prevalent and persistent in respect to public education, that is by no means the only arena of conflict. Nor is it, by any means, always unsuccessful. The words "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance were added by Congress in 1954 as the result of a sermon preached by Rev. George Daugherty of the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C., on an occasion when President Dwight Eisenhower was present. Daugherty objected that the Pledge was one which a Russian school child could utter by merely substituting "USSR" for "USA." He observed that some thing was wrong when a pledge could be used equally well in a "godless" nation and in our country. Accordingly, he urged addi tion of the words "under God" to the Pledge. President Eisenhower endorsed the proposal and it was approved by Congress without any dissent.81 A decade later a suit was brought in New York by Joseph Lewis, an avowed and somewhat flamboyant atheist, to declare the law unconstitutional. The attorney for the New York Department of Education, with the support of the thirty states that joined in an amicus curiae brief in opposition to Lewis, argued that the Pledge, including the 1954 addition, was not a religious exercise but was designed to promote patriotism.82 It is somewhat difficult to accept this argument in view of the statement in Madison's Memorial and Remonstrance, which has often been recognized by the Supreme Court as a foundation of the Establishment Clause, that the civil authority's effort to employ religion as an engine of civil policy was "an unhallowed perversion of the means of salvation." In any event, in the case of Lewis v. A lien,83 the Supreme Court refused to set aside the decision of a New York court upholding the statute's constitutionality. Using the terms "evangelical" and "crusade" in a somewhat broader sense than is to be found in most standard dictionaries, note may be taken of some evangelical efforts of Madelyn Murray O'Hair, exceeding in flamboyance and lack of success those of Lewis, in her crusade against God. Among these were her attempts 80. Ibid., p. 194. 81. Stokes and Pfeffer, Church and State in the United States, pp. 570-71, fn. 8. 82. 379 U.S. 923 (1964). 83.

Hall.87 In that case, a federal court ruled that the official North Carolina state highway map violated the Constitution in printing on it the "Motorist's Prayer," which asked the blessings of "our heavenly Father as we take the wheel of our car." In doing so, it rejected the state's argument that the prayer was no more offensive than the nondenominational invocation common at public meet ings, a practice which (if not exercised in public schools during school hours) the courts had consistently refused to enjoin.88 Logic and consistency might have supported this argument, but the fed eral court refused to accept it and held that the prayer was an impermissible government sponsorship of religion. On 2 March 1981, the Supreme Court, without opinion, rejected the state's appeal.89 The substance of this article may be summarized as follows. From the initial landing of the Pilgrims on our shores, up to the time of the Declaration of Independence, invocation of the Deity in official governmental acts was a practically universal practice. Thereafter it continued and still continues to be acceptable in state constitutions; indeed it is to be found today in almost all state constitutions. Those who wrote and those who adopted our national Constitution and its Bill of Rights, however, made a deliberate determination not to invoke the Deity therein. On the other hand, the Supreme Court, for more than a century and half, showed no reticence in invoking the Deity in its own decisions. In the course of this period, however, it expanded the meaning of the term to encompass the nontrinitar ian Deity of the Unitarians and Universalists and by using the term "Judeo-Christian," to include the Deity of the Jews. In its most recent relevant decisions it has employed the amorphous and almost boundaryless term "Supreme Being" as that term is interpreted by 84. O'Hairs. Paine, 312 F. Supp. 434 (D.C.
