ISSN 0268-540X (formerly ISSN 0307-6776) The British Dependent (Orphan) Territories Guest editorial by Jonathan Skinner Often, during times of great change and upheaval, the personal and social dimensions of a society can get lost or be swamped by a focus on the political. Yet the members of that society may retain personal under- standings of the forces at work, maintaining their own unique world view even as their world changes around them. We might take, as one example of what Gledhill (1994) terms the 'externalisation of the political', the recent changes in British legislation with respect to the UK's overseas dependencies and overseas citizens. The implementation of and reaction to these changes, as witnessed in specific instances, offer fruitful ground for anthropological examination of the meeting point of political, social and personal analyses. The British Home Office recently made an unex- pected announcement that the right to live in the UK is to be extended to more British passport holders: the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act is to be amended to grant British overseas citizens the option to register as British citizens and thus obtain the right to abode in the UK. Furthermore, this amendment is to include British protected persons from former British protectorates such as Zambia, and other British sub- jects - predominantly those born in India or what is now the Republic of Ireland before 1949 - so long as they have no other nationality and have not given up any other nationality. This new position improves upon the proposed change to the status of British colonies (known as the British Dependent Territories - BDTs) put forward by the British government in 1999. The change of name, to British Overseas Territories, has been accompanied by an offer of citizenship (conditional upon the accept- ance of a number of modem European 'liberal'-styled laws such as those which have decriminalized homo- sexuality and ended the death penalty) and the right of abode in Britain. This had previously been denied to all British Dependent Territory citizens apart from those in Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands. This change reverses some of the iniquities of the 1981 British Nationality Act, which increased the number of 'British' people denied the right of entry to Britain and introduced the notion ofjus sanguinis (the law of blood), ending the long-standing principle of jus soli (the law of the soil). That legislation had meant that since 1983, when it came into force, people born in Britain of non-British parents no longer automati- cally acquired British nationality and citizenship. The new Act also updates the 1948 British Nationality Act, which introduced the status of 'citizen of the UK and colonies', and brings Britain more into accord with other modemrn states (Castles &amp; Davidson 2000). But while Britain might see herself as an enlight- ened and tolerant modemrn state, and this latest move as evidence of that, she does still practise 'anthropemy' - the ejection of dangerous individuals from the social body. Although, as Robin Cohen (1994) notes, the Home Office acceded in 1987 to the customary prin- ciple of sanctuary, declaring that they would not storm churches or other places of worship to imprison or evict refugees, in July 2002 the West Midlands police were ordered to break this principle by forcing entry into the Ghausia Jamia mosque in Lye to take Afghan refugees Farid and Feriba Ahmadi into custody.

London: Pluto Press. (educated, keen to adopt aspects of a British way of life, and fluent in the English language), the couple and their two children were flown out on a charter jet to Germany. These actions may not be politically consistent, but they are in line with Home Secretary David Blunkett's 'Freedom is not free' position, a stance which seeks the enhancement of state power at the expense of civil liberties and is part of a wider 'post'-colonial US/UK political doctrine of social inclusiveness at home combined with pre-emptive self- defence abroad. Included in this brave new world axis is a rejection of the principle of respect for national sovereignty, international law (from the UN to the International Criminal Court) and democracy - as witness, for example, Britain's refusal to recognize Gibraltar's massive majority vote to retain British dependency status, or Gibraltar's lack of polit- ical representation in European elections. (The latter could soon be changed following a successful appeal to the European Court of Human Rights against Britain's refusal to accord Gibraltarians the right to vote in the 1999 Euro elections. It is rumoured that Gibraltar could soon be absorbed into a Welsh electoral constituency!) Decolonization of the BDTs has ostensibly been fostered by Britain's membership of the UN Committee on Decolonization. The UN Committee's aim was to eradicate colonialism by the end of the 20th century yet, despite being a member, for years Britain refused permission for delega- tions to visit her BDTs. It was only in 1999 that the New Labour government issued a White Paper, Partnership for progress and prosperity (FCO 1999), which reviewed Britain's relationship with the BDTs. This review process began in 1997 following the government's media mishan- dling of aid packages to the British Dependent Territory Montserrat, when Secretary of State for International Development Clare Short declared 'They will be wanting golden elephants next.' The White Paper referred to BDTs with the - politically more acceptable - title British Overseas Territories (BOTs), populated by British Dependent Territory citizens (BDTCs), and offered these citizens British citizenship and the right of abode in the UK. Of additional significance are the following four under- lying principles contained in this White Paper: (1) self- determination for the Territories; (2) mutual obligations and responsibilities; (3) freedom for the Territories to run their own affairs to the greatest degree possible; (4) Britain's firm commitment to promote economic develop- ment in the Territories and to help them in emergencies. These new principles would suggest a recent unlegislated and informal shift in British policy, one which is more in accord with Britain's token commitment to decoloniza- tion. It can be interpreted as being simultaneously inclu- sive and exclusive, both expelling from and absorbing into the 'corporate' body. The consequences of this potential reorientation of immigration/dependency policy, no matter how inconsis- tent general British policy on immigration and asylum appears to be, are immense for many of the inhabitants and former inhabitants of British Dependent Territories. This predicted policy shift also begs the anthropological ques- tion of how individuals and societies adapt to situations which may require them to abandon their territory. The plight of Montserratians seeking sanctuary in the UK and their problems with integration was the focus of dis- cussion at the Anthropology panel at the British Association for the Advancement of Science's annual 'Festival of Science', held at the University of Leicester in September 2002. Under the rubric 'The science behind migration and multiculturalism', a range of speakers were invited to apply general understandings of 'science' (a self-calibrating and consensual perspective) and 'migra- tion' (the typically circular and self-perpetuating move- ment of people in and from the Caribbean region for example) to the particular case of Montserrat. Since 1995, the island of Montserrat in the Eastern Caribbean has been suffering a volcanic eruption which has necessitated the departure of 75% of its population of 12,000. Some 3500 Montserratians have tried to settle in the UK, largely around London, Birmingham and Leicester, traditional regions of West Indian immigration. The remainder have had to relocate to the north of the island or to leave for North America. Those who came to Britain have spent almost a decade in social and political limbo as 'British but not British' (BDT citizens), as evac- uees and/or refugees (BDT citizens supported in the UK by the charity Refugee Action), and with an initial two- year leave to stay which was subsequently converted to an indefinite leave to remain. In an account which focused on anthropomorphism, Gill Norton, a member of the British Geological Survey, chronicled the rise of the volcano's dome and its interpre- tation by scientists who have had to produce risk maps of the island and then redesign them to fit in with the Montserratians' lay understandings of science. Those who cannot face living with 'the Beast', the 'bad mountain' with 'his' temperamental disposition, resettle to Britain where they remain in limbo, first on a two-year permit, then an indefinite leave to remain (until revoked), and now with the possibility of unconditional citizenship of the motherland. Despite these years of uncertainty, Lazelle Howes, manager of the Montserrat Community Support Trust (once funded by the Home Office but now defunct), noted that a telephone survey of settlers showed that UK- based Montserratians consider Britain to be multicultural, at least in theory, whereas they referred to Montserrat as monocultural in theory - though perhaps traditionally colonial British in practice. Uncertainty is the only constant for Montserratians living with this volcano hazard which has become a dis- aster through human intervention. The result, according to Stuart Philpott, has been that their customary cycle of cir- cular migration - an 'ideology of return' - has been broken by the Department for International Development and the volcano, which between them have caused deterritorializa- tion and changes in land use. For many Montserratians this land loss is equivalent to 'soul loss' - to extend Besson's comparative presentation to the panel, which tackled family land in Jamaica. Many of the remaining Montserratians try to come to terms with living with the volcano by personalizing it, and by reframing their natural plight into a supernatural struggle for the island. Those Montserratians who have resettled in the UK also face physical hurdles and local bureaucracies in dealing with poor and temporary housing, tardy social service provision and ambiguities of residence status - and even struggle in Methodist Church congregations with their different ways of worship, as Eade and Wood suggested at the conference. What this conflux of factors appears to illustrate is the diverse and creative ways in which events, institutions and actors can be appropriated by those involved, personalized and recast into a sacred struggle. This mode of response suggests a fruitful area for anthropological investigation both into the relationship of other small colonial and post- colonial societies with the 'motherland' and into similar political reactions to New Labour initiatives amongst the electorate at home, as well as amongst those excluded from the electorate abroad. * Note: The British Association Annual Festival 2003 will be held 8-12 September, at the University of Salford, Manchester, UK.
