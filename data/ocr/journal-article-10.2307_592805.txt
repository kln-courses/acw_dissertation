<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tlhe Economic Study of Religzion.-By MiSS MARGARETTA MORRIS, Philadelphia. THE purpose of this paper is to discuss briefly the relation of the present study of religion to social science, and to suggest, if possible, some methods of approaching the problems of relig- ious development from the point of view of the social scientist. In attempting to characterize the scientific study of religion, one is puzzled at the outset with the usual difficulty of compara- tively new subjects, indefiniteness of nomenclature. Three distinct branches of study at present go by the name of science of religion; distinct in character, though somewhat similar in subject matter. The first analyses religious experiences with a view to determining the place of religion in the mental life of man; the second applies various criteria to religious concepts to test their ultimate truth; the third traces the growth of creeds and cults in order to formulate laws of their development. From one point of view these are branches of psychology, phil- osophy, and history, respectively. As such two of them at least are recognized as special studies, under the names of the psychology of religion and the philosophy of religion. The third, the effort to give an empirical explanation of how relig- ious beliefs and institutions came to be what they are, is much less sharply defined. One might suppose that this would stand by itself as essentially the science of religion. And yet as a matter of fact it is rarely, if ever, found without a considera- ble mixture of psychological and philosophical enquiry. The majority of text-books on the science of religion concern them- selves with problems that belong to all three studies. The study of this historical aspect of religion, as distinguished from the psychological or philosophical problems, may surely be rightly regarded as one of the social sciences. Not only is it at the same time social and scientific, but its connection with the already recognized social sciences is extremely close. The gen- eral study of human institutions necessarily overlaps the study of religious institutions. For the religion of a community is not something unrelated to its secular activities any more than</page><page sequence="2">Vol. xxiv.] Morris, The Economic Study of Religion. 395 the religious experience of an individual is apart from his gen- eral mental development. This intimate connection of religion with life makes it necessary for the student of religion to com- pare his data at every point with those collected in other fields, if he would understand their full significance. It is important, however, while recognizing the close connec- tion between religious phenomena and the whole of human life, in order to" understand that connection clearly, to distinguish between what is religious and what is not. At first glance this might seem to be a, very simple task. But there is a whole region of debatable land that causes much confusion. Among primitive peoples there is the question of magic, in more advanced times the series of mythology, science, philosophy. Can these rightly be regarded as belonging to religion? Modern scholars generally maintain that the progress of mythology, science, and philosophy, the whole development of speculation as to causes, represents a course of intellectual devel- opment and not an evolution of religion. And yet the evolution of belief is bound up with the evolution of religion. Belief is an essential part of religion and is affected by the religious senti- ment. We cannot say that belief is religion, still less that religion is, as Mr. Jevons claims, a faith in a personal God.' Nor can we admit that any one of the well-known definitions of religion which recognize only one of the elements of religion is correct. These three elements, as has-been indicated by Tiele, are belief, conduct, and emotion. Spencer, Arnold, and Max Miller, respectively, make religion consist of belief, conduct, or emo- tion, and Tiele himself makes emotion the foundation of religion. Dr. Jastrow, however, rightly insists that religion contains three elements: 1) the natural recognition of a Power or Powers beyond our control; 2) the feeling of dependence upon this Power or Powers; 3) the entering into relation with this Power or Powers. Frazer and Lang recognize only belief and conduct as essential.' 1 Compare Jevons, Introduction to the History of Religion, p. 408. 2 Spencer, First Principles, p. 37; Arnold, Lit. and Dogma, p. 18; Muller, Hibbert Lectures; Tiele, Science of Religion, ii, p. 15; Jastrow, Study of Religion, pp. 65,171; Frazer, Golden Bough, 2d ed., i. 63; Lang, Maaic and' Reliaion.

There must be a theory of causes that are ultimate to the mind of the believer, a theory not indifferently assented to, but one that arouses in the religious man strong emotions, which prompt him to actions supposed to be appropriate to the belief. How far then has the science of religion to deal, on the one hand with the history of speculation, and on the Aother hand with the growth and decline of magic and the development of standards of morality? We have found, I believe, a service- able criterion of elimination. If we recognize the necessity for the combination of all three elements to constitute religion, we can cut out, on the theoretical side, all speculations which are for mere interest or for practical purposes and which do not affect ideals of conduct, and on the side of action, all standards of morality and all practices and customs save those sanctioned by the people's ultimate beliefs. And now perhaps we are in a position to bring out more clearly the distinction I tried to make above between the prov- ince of the social science of religion and that of the psychology of religion. It is with creeds and cults that the former has to deal, with the external manifestations of religion, which are readily classified under the two elements of belief and of con- duct. While it recognizes the emotional element, it properly leaves the detailed study of it to the other branch of the science. For the whole question'of the origin, nature, and development of the religious emotion is so bound up with the problems of psychology that it takes a specialist in that branch to handle it. Besides serving to mark out the field, the distinctions I have here emphasized between the various elements of religion, distinctions which every one recognizes to a certain extent even if he does not use them, are necessary within the historical study itself. Lack of practical application of them has led to a great tangle, noticeably in regard to the origin of religion. I am speak- ing of origin, of course, in the historical sense of beginning, and not of the psychological question discussed by Tiele of what in the fundamental constitution of human nature makes man relig- ious, nor the metaphysical question of whether religion is a purely human' product or a dimly perceived revelation. When we ask what is the origin of religion, we should have a clear understanding as to whether we are referring to religious belief,</page><page sequence="4">Vol. xxiv.] The Economic Study of Religion. 397 custom, or instinct. For these did not necessarily spring into being united, but may have had widely different origins, although we cannot fairly call them religious until they are in some way connected. If, for instance, we are in search of the origin of the religious instinct, our problem is, what was the primitive instinct in man or animal out of which the religious emotion developed, and at what point may we fairly call it religious? Another distinct problem is the origin of religious observance. The great difficulty has been that various writers have seized upon the beginning of one or another element and thought of it as the origin of religion. What has been called the origin of religion by men like Spencer, Frazer, and others, who account for it by the ghost- theory, magic, or fetishism, is, accurately speaking, the origin of belief. They ask what was the first belief, out of which all others developed. Even with the most careful distinctions, however, this whole question of the origin of religion is so enveloped in prehistoric haze, that it seems almost a waste of time to attempt to solve it in the present state of human knowledge. As to the origin of belief, was there any one original belief out of which the many differentiated? and if so, have we any means of finding out what it was ? If there was such a belief, it must have been when man became differentiated from the apes, and before there was any variation within the species. For after mankind is divided up into separate groups, a differ- ence of beliefs is inevitable. Have we any evidence to show what the first differentiated men's belief was ? or indeed whether they had any at all that could be termed religious ? However this may be, the so-called " primitive " religions which we find described in sociological works belong to a very much later time than the pithecanthropus or even quaternary man. They belong to a time when the human species was already highly differentiated, the various parts living in differ- ent environments, and with generally different culture, if we may call it so. There is already a difference in beliefs, but at the same time a similarity in the beliefs of groups living in similar environments. This similarity has led people to suppose that all religions start from some common belief, however varyingly they may</page><page sequence="5">398 X. iorris, [1903. afterwards develop. Thinkers have seized upon one or another crude form of belief as the universal starting point. And much that has been written on the evolution of religion is merely an endeavor to trace survivals of such a belief through all more complicated forms. This is particularly true of Frazer's view of the function of magic, of Grant Allen's treatment of the cult of the dead, and Spencer's ghost theory. Until anthropology and archeology have given us more facts to work upon, it seems probable that there will be little agree- ment as to the original belief. What can be done, however, with the material now available, what the spirit of modern investigation demands should be done, is to work out the forma- tion of particular beliefs, and to discover the laws of their development. The development can be traced, in the first place, as affected by the environment of the people who hold those convictions, and in the second place as influenced by beliefs that grew up in previous environments of those same people. This should give us a general theory and a principle of growth applicable to all beliefs in all ages, which would, indeed, be of more practical value than the possibility of tracing faiths to a common origin. A general law of development is needed before the science of religion can get beyond the descriptive stage. In biology we have the law of variability and survival of the fittest, which if anything is a principle of continuous development. What we want is a similar law for the evolution of religion, something that is more than a mere chronological and comparative descrip- tion. And so far, however valuable in amassing material, and making possible closer study, the work of investigators has been, there has not yet been given anything, I think, that one could justly call a scientific law. Mr. Grant Allen's book, "The Evolution of the Idea of God," is an attempt to demonstrate the theory that every relig- ion had its origin in the worship of some dead man. He works out his idea by showing how it might have been reasonable for the savage to come to think of the dead man as a god, and by quoting facts that show that many savages actually did worship dead relatives and heroes. But so far as I can judge there is no principle of evolution. The development is logically possi- ble, and in a number of instances apparently took place. But why?</page><page sequence="6">Vol. xxiv.] TYe Ecowwminic Staudy of Religion. 399 Mr. Jevons, I think, comes nearer a principle of develop- ment in his postulate that primitive man's mind worked like ours according to the methods of inductive logic, although his beliefs were unreasonable from our point of view, because he misapplied that logic. But our principle of evolution should go farther and tell us why primitive man made certain mistakes rather than others, should account not only for the reasonable- ness of early beliefs, but also for their character. Mr. Jevons makes a luminous suggestion when he says that progress occur- red only under certain favorable conditions. But I cannot find that he carries this out and tells just what were the conditions necessary to progress. Still more exclusively descriptive is Mr. Frazer's method of explaining religious beliefs and customs. It consists chiefly in comparing certain rites in one country with similar rites in another, the inference being that if a rite has a known meaning in one instance we may take for granted the same meaning wherever it appears. That customs should be alike in countries far separated seems to Mr. Frazer a matter of course, and not, as it appears to many investigators, a curious phenomenon, itself requiring elaborate explanation. I do not find that he anywhere discusses this fact, which Mr. Lang has taken pains to account for by his theory that similar degrees of civilization bring forth similar religious ideas, and Max Muller by the pos- tulate of a wide-spread borrowing. The theory which seems to be implied in Mr. Frazer's work, though nowhere explicitly stated, is that the natural constitution of human reason in the primitive stage led to a first conception of the relation of man to the world about him, that of sympathetic magic. Out of this developed a series of ideas in regular order, idea two pro- ducing idea three, and so on until we come to the modern com- plexity of religion. I have said above that Mr. Frazer nowhere explicitly states this to be his theory. And yet I think we must assume it if we are to put any order into his scholarly assemblage of comparisons. I could wish he had laid more stress on this point. Two of the fundamental problems that the science of religion must solve he hardly touches; he gives no real answer to the question as to why the manifestations of religion in far distant regions and widely separated periods should be so strangely alike, nor does he tell how we are to</page><page sequence="7">400 M. Morris, [1903. account for the special differences which exist with all the sim- ilarity. What he has done is to bring together facts concern- ing beliefs and customs which have a strong resemblance to one another, explaining those that are not well understood by apply- ing to them the meaning of the more obvious. I have already referred to Mr. Lang's theory that the same stage of civilization will produce similar religious ideas in peo- ples widely separated. This theory has led him to emphasize the advantage of studying the secular and religious history of a people together. In "Myth, Ritual and Religion,"' he says that a systematic history of Egyptian religion, by which alone it could be perfectly understood, would have to be chronolog- ical, marking the rise and fall of various ideas, and guided by topographical and social conditions. His explanation of the cult of Osiris shows that he would include also political condi- tions. He maintains that the identification of Osiris with vari- ous animals worshipped in different parts "could not but occur, in the long course of time, when political expediency urged the recognition of the identity of various local deities."' And in treating of Greek mythology, also, the effect of political change is insisted upon.3 According to Mr. Lang, the immoral tales about Zeus grew up when Greece was attaining a national unity: as Zeus replaced the totemistic deities he took to himself their stories; and many of his amours were invented to reconcile the local belief in descent from animals by saying that Zeus, the father of all, had taken the form of those animals. Although his work is full of suggestions like these, and although he strongly advocates comparing religious and secular development, Mr. Lang has not undertaken it systematically himself. He has rested content with pointing out the way for others. And therefore he is not prepared to tell us why religious progress should go hand in hand with the progress of civilization, what laws govern their relation to one another. These laws Dr. Jastrow hopes will be established by the his- torical treatment of religions, the salient feature of which " consists in the endeavor to treat facts in connection with the conditions under which they are produced, and likewise to trace the origin of religious phenomena to the conditions appropriate for their production.'" -' (Ch. xv.) 2 Op. cit., Vol. ii, p. 108. 3 Op. cit., Vol. ii, p. 189. 4 Study of Religion, p. 21.</page><page sequence="8">Vol. xxiv.] The Economic Study of Religion. 401 If this study which Dr. Jastrow recommends were to be sys- tematically carried out with reference to various religions; if the religious ideas of each period were to be related to the polit- ical and social, and, I would add, the economic organization, and if the results obtained for various countries and periods were to be compared, we should be well on our way to the dis- covery of a principle of development. The problem which now confronts the historical study of religion is that of getting beyond the merely descriptive stage by discovering the laws which govern the formation of religious beliefs, the growth of religious institutions, and their relation to one another. This problem may not be solved through social science; but before it can be solved I believe there must be a more careful investigation than has yet been carried out of the relation of religion to life, of the points where religion affects and is affected by political, social, and economic progress; it must be recognized that the historical investigation of religious beliefs and customs has rightfully a place in the study of society as a whole, that it cannot maintain an isolated position, but is intimately concerned with the problems of political and social science and of eco- nomics. II. In the first part of this paper I have endeavored to reach a definite statement of the problem of the science of religion in its relation to social science, by means of a short study of the purpose and methods of a few well-known writers. That prob- lem we found to be the discovery of a valid law, and its solution td lead us into a wider circle of human activities. In this sec- ond part I wish to break into that circle by taking a cursory glance at the relation of religion to one important form of human endeavor, the search for a livelihood. There is a growing tendency among sociologists to turn to eco- nomics for an explanation of the higher forms of social activity. And some very suggestive hints have been thrown out concern- ing the influence of economic progress on religious development. Enough has been written on this subject, I think, to convince the general student that there is some connection between the two. But just how and why economics determine religion, and how in</page><page sequence="9">402 3. Morris, [1903. turn religion affects economics, is too detailed a study to be car- ried out by the general student of social problems, and could be much more successfully accomplished by historians of religion' working in cooperation with students of social science. I shall not attempt to go into this subject systematically. I shall merely bring together a few beliefs and observances, gath- ered at random from various sources, having evidently some con- nection with the manner of life of the people among whom they originated. We may gain from these at least an impression of the relation that exists, and may be able to point out some methods of studying it at closer range. We must, I think, acknowledge that our religious ideas are far from being the result of pure reasoning. We like to call ourselves rational beings, and yet we have to admit, as Prof. James observes, that " the logical reason of man operates in this field of divinity exactly as it has always operated in love, or in patriotism, or in politics, or in any other of the wider affairs of life, in which our passions or our mystical intuitions fix our beliefs beforehand."2 Do these passions and mystical intuitions fix our beliefs by wild chance? or is there some law that governs their action? It would probably come as a great surprise to most of us if we could realize how much utility enters into the forming of our opinions. The things that fit into a conscious need, the people who have helped us, are rated high in our most impartial estimates. Since this is true in lesser things, it is only natural that in the idea that most vitally touches a man's whole life, the idea of God, there should be an idealization of what is necessary to his welfare. The primitive hunter worships an animal god; the totemic tribe living by the seaside or by a river, a fish god; the agriculturist, the principle of fertility, or perhaps the very sheaves of corn themselves; pastoral tribes have their sacred cattle, or a god who is represented in the form of a bull or sheep. The idea of God tends to assume the form of whatever is useful to the community. 1 In writing of the religion of India Dr. Hopkins illustrates "the influence of utility on the theopoetic tendency as shown in settled and unsettled communities, respectively," and refers to economic conditions as a determining factor in religion, though, he says, " the application of this limitation must remain for specialists to make in their several departments." India Old and New, p. 112. 2 James, The Varieties of Religious Experience, p. 436.</page><page sequence="10">Vol. xxiv.] The Econoomic Study of Religion. 403 On the practical side of religion we find a similar effect of utilitarian influence. Those customs which are in themselves beneficial are given a religious sanction; moral ideas which are socially useful are inculcated, a particular kind of food which is growing scarce is either prohibited entirely, or, as is the case with the Damaras and Kaffirs (tribes who cannot afford to kill their cattle for everyday food), is made the center of a religious festival.1 These tendencies give us a starting point for our study. In tracing the relation of religion and economics, it is well to begin our interpretation of a people's faith by asking what is their chief dependence, and then looking to see whether an idealiza- tion of it has been taken up and incorporated into the religious ideas; and our interpretation of a custom by looking to the practical effect it has. It is easy to see why even the most religious people's moral ideals are often inconsistent with their beliefs. They have grown up separately in different relation to economic needs, and are often so far estranged that even the most ardent desire for unity of life cannot harmonize them. Yet the effort is made determinedly. It is made in the mod- ern pulpit, it is made by the crudest savage. And although we must study creeds and cults separately, on account of their sepa- rate origins, we cannot ignore their close connection. An obso- lete creed will often survive on account of the benefit society receives from the morality it inculcates; and vice versa, prac- tices which are of no particular value often continue by virtue of their connection with some faith which still represents vital ideals. And it is curious how ideals of conduct that grow up independently because of their usefulness are adopted and jus- tified to satisfy this craving for unity by a faith with which they have no real relation. Society is too practical, however, to let the desire for consist- ency lead to what is injurious. Unification can go so far and no farther. Where an observance is harmful it will be dropped, even though it be the logical outcome of prevalent ideas. These few hints may serve to show that the relation of relig- ion to the life of a people is by no means a simple one. And I Allen,.Evolution of the Idea of God, p. 318; Jevons, op. cit., p. 116.</page><page sequence="11">404 M. Morris, [1903. it is further complicated by the well-known power of religious conservatism, which enables both ideas and practices to survive long after there is any reason for them. Past methods and manners of life, the good old times, proverbially have their stronghold in religion. One phase of this spirit is a curious reluctance to make use of new inventions in religious rites. Mr. Frazer tells us that " to this day a Hottentot priest never uses an iron knife but always a sharp splint of quartz in sacri- ficing an animal or circumcising a lad." 1 And that-" In some parts of Swabia the Easter fires might not be kindled with iron or flint or steel; but only by friction of wood." Another aspect is the effort to keep an old idea, after its antagonist has taken firm hold, by remoulding and readapting it. Allegory is useful here. As Mr. Lang says, "That great stumbling block to Greek piety, the battle [in the Iliad] in which the gods take part, was explained as a physical allegory by the Neo-Plato- nists." 2 Sometimes the old religion finds a place in folk-custom, as the worship of the plough which survives in England in the customs of Plough-Monday. And sometimes the new religion takes up into itself the sacred things of the old. Saint Bridget, we learn from Mr. Lang, " succeeded to the cult of the fire- goddess and to her ceremonial ";3 and Mr. Grant Allen tells us that " The holy oaks of immemorial worship in England became 'Thor's Oaks' under Saxon heathendom and 'Gospel Oaks' under mediaeval Christianity,"-a double adoption.4 This force of conservatism warns us that we must be careful in relating ideas to their environment, to take into consideration past as well as present environments, lest we should find ourselves in the absurd position of some uninformed geographer who, finding negroes in America, should attempt to account for the type by local conditions. Only in a simple society, isolated from the world, and one whose economic environment has for centuries Temained the same, can we find a religion perfectly appropriate to the man- ner of life. However, I do not believe that the influence of conservatism is strong enough to prevent the general type of a religion from conforming to the type of society in which it 1 Golden Bough, Vol. i, p. 173, first edition (and so below). 2 Lang, Myth, Ritual and Religion, Vol. ii, p. 184. 3Lang, op. cit., Yol. ii, p. 235. 4 Allen, op. cit., p. 209.</page><page sequence="12">Vol. xxiv.] 'ihe Eeconomic Study of Religion. 405 exists. The connection, I believe, is always close enough to make it practicable to classify religions according to the civili- zations that have produced them. Dr. Jastrow has taken this point of view in his classification, which is a great advance over the familiar indefinite division into fetishism, animism, ancestor-worship, polytheism, mono- theism. He puts all religions into four categories: I. Religions of savages, II. Religions of primitive culture, III. Religions of advanced culture, IV. Religions which emphasize as an ideal the coextensive- ness of religion with life. It will be observed, however, that after the first three stages Dr. Jastrow has shifted his standpoint and characterized his fourth class by the nature of the religions rather than the type of society. And for a practical working classification there is some objection to the elasticity of -the terms savages, primitive culture, advanced culture. A classification, not of religions, but of society as a whole, given by an economist, Dr. L. M. Keasbey, corresponds roughly in its broad divisions with Dr. Jastrow's three stages of sav- agery, primitive culture, and advanced culture, and defines more exactly the limits of each. In the first period, which Dr. Keasbey calls the "Natural State," he includes all the social groups in which there is as yet no "appropriation of natural resources for pastoral and agricultural purposes." ' Men satisfy their wants by working alone or in cooperation, with simple tools as instruments of production. And wealth at this stage means welfare simply, and not the stock of goods contributing to welfare; things are desired for their use-value alone. Such groups would include the fruit and root gatherers of jungles and barren and arctic environments, the hunting and fishing villages of rivers and forests, the republican hunting clans of forests or plains, and the sea-fishers of oceanic islands. The second period, the " Proprietary," begins with pastoral and agricultu- ral life, and develops the division into, classes consequent upon the monopolization of the sources of wealth. There is a coercive organization of society, the owners of land and cattle being able 1 Keasbey, Prestige Value, Quart. Jour. of Econ., May, 1903.</page><page sequence="13">406 X1Li. Morris, [1903. to compel non-owners to work for them. Wealth now means the possession of goods that give power; goods are desired not merely to satisfy personal wants, but also because of the prestige their possession accords; use-value is supplemented by prestige- value. The beginnings of this period are seen in the patriarchal herders of the plains, and the communal agricultural clans of fertile valleys; and its full development is found in feudal socie- ties, early monarchies, and theocracies controlled by priests. The third period in Dr. Keasbey's scheme enters in with the " separation of employments, the institution of exchange, and the invention of money." It is the " Commercial Era," marked by the organization of society on the competitive system, and the measuring of things by their value in exchange. One obvious advantage of a classification like this, for the student of religions who wishes to arrange the types of relig- ions according to the civilizations in which they arose, is that there is a perfectly definite line of demarcation between the periods; proprietary control of the sources of wealth marks the division between the first and second periods; the use of money and gain of wealth by commerce, the division between the second and third. And within each period the subdivisions are as clearly defined; one readily sees the difference between a highly organized clan of hunters roaming about the plains in search of big game, and a village of fishermen whose only reason for being together is that the fish are best caught in that place. If in adapting this scheme to a classification of religions there should be found a common characteristic in the religions of one period, and a close correspondence in the religions of peoples coming under the same subdivision, the vital connection between the form of religion and the economic organization would be established beyond a peradventure. Then there would still remain to students of religion the task of explaining this relation, of answering the questions, why ? and how? The few scattered instances which I can give here will by no means fill up the scheme. And they are so fragmentary that it is impossible in every case to fit them into this classification of society. I can only hope they may serve to suggest what might be done with a more thorough study, and to illustrate the way in which men idealize and bring up into the sphere of religion the things upon which they chiefly depend.</page><page sequence="14">Vol. xxiv.] T'he Beonomic Studty of Religion. 407 The instances I have collected belong to the first two periods. The commercial era is very little considered by writers on the science of religion, who thus far have chiefly confined them- selves to less advanced civilizations. I shall give first some early conceptions of the deity, which are intimately connected with economic activities, and then touch upon the question of the social utility of religious observances. The worship of trees is a phenomenon that has been made particularly familiar to us by the philological study of early European beliefs. Keary is one of the writers who has made a great deal of it. Among the worshippers of forest trees were the ancient Prussians, the Druids, and the ancient Italians,1 all reverencing the oak; the Swedes, and the Norwegians, who worshipped the ash and the elm; the Gilghit tribes of India, who adored a sacred cedar; and the Semites,2 who worshipped as divine the evergreen oaks of the Palestine Hills, and also the pines and cedars of Lebanon. All these people were dependent upon trees in many ways; and it will be noticed that the kind of tree worshipped is in each case either the characteristic local growth or in some way of peculiar importance. Sometimes the belief in the sacredness of trees was accom- panied by an injunction not to cut them, and probably served as a sort of primitive forestry reservation. This was the case among the Samogitans of Lithuania, the Swedes, the Livonians of Russia, and the Italians, who spared a sacred grove on the Alban Mount. The same religious scruples cautioned the Roman farmer, who before thinning out a grove had to sacrifice a pig to the goddess of the grove.3 And again the Miris of Assam " are unwilling to break up new land for cultivation so long as there is fallow land available; for they fear to offend the spirits of the woods by cutting down trees unnecessarily." And the Bechuanas regard it as a serious religious offence to cut the hack-thorn, which is very sacred, during the rainy season.4 When considered in their practical results, such prohibitions are not merely superstitious and arbitrary, as they might seem at first.

One may doubt whether forestry reservation can account for the refusal to cut down individual sacred trees, as in Sumatra and the Pelew Islands. In these and similar cases there is prob- ably some particular local reason, and one would have to have more data at hand to hazard an explanation. Among sacred trees, fruit trees have a place as well as the massive forest giants. It is naturally among fruit-growers that we find the god identified with fruit trees and vines. In Lace- daemon we hear of the fig-Dionysus, who was in general the patron of cultivated trees. "Prayers were offered to him that he would make the trees grow; and he was especially honoured by husbandmen, chiefly fruit-growers, who set up an image of him in the shape of a natural tree-stump in their orchards." Dionysus was patron of the vine in Greece as early as Homeric times. In ancient Italy, each vine-growing village had a Jovis, god of wine, worshipped at the wine feast in April. At Athens the cultivation of olives was an important industry, and accord- ingly the olive was sacred to Athena; while in Ephesus, also an olive-growing state, it was sacred to Artemis. The Arabians worshipped the date-palm, and the fig was one of the sacred trees of India. Perhaps the most striking instance of deifica- tion of the food tree is that of the Wanika of East Africa. The cocoanut tree is the chief source of food supply of these people. They believe that each cocoanut tree has its spirit. And so deeply is it held in reverence that to cut one down is regarded as matricide.1 Thus the horticulturist worships his food tree as the forest- dweller the tree that gives him shelter. Both are dependent on their trees, though in different ways. The worship of wild animals, familiar to us as totemism, belongs distinctively to hunters, since these people's very life depends upon the animals they kill. Mr. Frazer defines totem- ism as "roughly speaking, the worship of wild animals-the religion of society on the hunting stage."2 And Mr. Jevons also recognizes the connection of totemism and hunting so far as to say that all peoples in the hunter stage are totemists.' 1 Allen, op. cit., p. 149, '269; Lang, ii, pp. 218, f.; Jevons, p. 208; Frazer, i, p. 59. 2 G.

The Ainos of Japan, the Ostiaks of Northern Siberia, and the Gilyaks of Eastern Sibe- ria are hunting tribes who consider all bears as rightful objects of worship.' Bears are also worshipped and hunted by the North American Indians ;2 while some tribes, such as the Utes, worship wolves.3 Sometimes the tribe refrains from hunting its sacred animal, as the Osages, who would not kill their brother, the beaver.4 May this not be due to the same half-conscious utility which caused woodland people to spare their sacred groves ? The totemist claims descent from the animal he worships, and thus the clan is closely bound together in brotherhood, to maintain the unity of tribal life, the willing cooperation, and the subordination of the individual, which are necessary for their successful expeditions. This clan idea of totemism is the one particularly emphasized by Mr. Jevons, the brotherhood it inculcates of the tribesmen with one another and with the tribal totem. One hears sometimes of fish-totems and plant-totems among people who are not wild animal hunters, but I think it would save confusion if we could keep the word for its strict meaning. The so-called fish-totems and fish-worship of all kinds are naturally found among people who live on the sea-coast or beside streams, such as the coast-Peruvians, of whom Garcilasso de la Vega said, " On the sea-coast they worshipped sardines, skates, dog-fish, and for want of larger gods, crabs" . . . . and they ate the fish they worshipped. The same author elsewhere says of the Indians of Peru that they "adored the fish they caught in greatest abundance . . . . for this reason they wor- shipped sardines in one region . . . in others the skate . . . in short they had whatever fish was most serviceable to them as their gods."6 If Garcilasso de la Vega had been a modern economist he could not have made a more definite statement. When we say that men worship the animals most useful to them, we are stating the positive side of the influence of utility. It must not be forgotten that there is also a negative, which Frazer, ii, P. 101, 1.05, 111. 2 Lang, M., . &amp; R., i, 57. -3 Lang, Ibid., i, 55. 4 Jevons, p. 102. 5 Lang, M., B. and R., I , 75. 6 Ibid.,1 ii, P. 119.</page><page sequence="17">410 X. iorris, [1903. leads to the worship of harmful animals, such as the snake, the crocodile and the shark. These also give names to clans and seem to have some of the attributes of totemic gods. Mr. Lang tells us that in Egypt Typhon, who took the shape of a croco- dile, "was adored at various places where it was dangerous to bathe on account of the number and audacity of the creatures." 1 In Africa, the Negroes of Issapoo " regard the cobra-capella as their guardian deity, who can do them good or ill, bestow riches or inflict disease and death."2 Perhaps in this we may get a hint that will be useful in tracing the conceptions of evil spirits and malignant deities. In general the worship of animals seems to support our con- tention that human nature reverences the " source whence all its blessings flow," nay, often reveres as gods the very blessings themselves. When we find the hunter's god in the form of a wild animal, and the fisher worshipping his fish, we are prepared to look for sacred cattle among pastoral peoples. Nor are we disappointed. In Africa we find tribes totally dependent upon their herds. These Damarras, Bechuanas, and Hottentots have a truly pas- toral religion, and hold their cattle very sacred. Another element in the religion of these and other pastoral peoples is ancestor-worship. The family altar and prayers to dead ancestors are found among the Hottentots, Damarras, and the Zulus ;3 and in the Hebrew nation it is during the pastoral period that we find the Teraphim, which, according to Kuenen, were "larger or smaller images, which were worshipped as household gods, and on which the happiness of the family was supposed to depend." 4 Of course this cult of the Teraphim was not strictly ancestor-worship, but it was closely akin to it in its family aspect. It might seem at first that ancestor-worship had little connec- tion with herding, until one looks to the social organization appropriate to this sort of life. We have already noted among totemistic hunters two aspects of their belief, one, the animal- god, resulting from their feeling of dependence upon a certain animal, and the other the blood-brotherhood, growing out of I Lang, M., R. and R., ii, p. 104. 2 Frazer, ii, p. 94. 3 Allen, p. 182; Jevons, p. 55, op. cit. 4 Cited by Allen, op. cit., p. 182.</page><page sequence="18">Vol. xxiv.] T'hie _Economic Studcy of Religion. 411 the necessities of organization. Among herders the unit is the family, and it is the father of the family who owns the cattle and rules supreme in his little kingdom.' Worship of ancestors would naturally predominate where family feeling is strongest, and where the head of the family holds the position of authority over a large number of dependents. On this principle Mr. Jevons maintains that ancestor-worship begins with a settled agricultural life, because then first the family emerges as a distinct unit. " The organized worship of ancestors," he tells us, " is bound up with the patriarchate and the patria potestas." It is curious that in associating ancestor- worship with the patria potestas and highly developed family life Dr. Jevons should have limited it to agriculture, overlook- ing the family organization and typical patriarchate that goes with pastoral, even the nomadic-pastoral life. Indeed the patriarchate and ancestor-worship is primarily typical of herd- ing communities. Where it occurs among agricultural peoples, it is rather among those in which herding and agriculture have been combined by amalgamation or conquest. Such peoples were the Greeks and Egyptians, whose depend- ence upon cattle is reflected in their religions, in the sort of half anthropomorphic deities represented in animal form, such as the bull-Dionysus, or the ram-Apollo, or Demeter who was repre- sented in Phigelia with a mare's head; and the black bulls, Apis and Mnevis. Their dependence upon the fruits of the earth is no less ideal- ized. Frazer describes how, "in one of the chambers dedicated to Osiris in the great temple of Isis at Philae the dead body of Osiris is represented with stalks of corn springing from it."2 And in speaking of the religion of Eleusis, Jevons says, "like other primitive agricultural communities the Eleusinians wor- shipped the corn which they cultivated, both the ripe ear, the Corn Mother, and the green blade, or Corn Maiden."' Examples are almost unnecessary since it is a truism to say that among agricultural people the gods are expressed in terms of agri- 1 See, in regard to the close connection between pastoral life and patriarchy, Grosse, Die Formen der Familie und die Formen der Wirt- schaft, p. 123. 2 Lang, op. cit., ii, pp. 202, 232, 265; Frazer, ii, p. 200. 3 Frazer, i, p. 305; Jevons, p. 364.

In the Punjab there is an altar near the sugar-cane press devoted to sacrifices to the sugar-cane god.1 Only in the beginnings of agriculture, however, as only in the beginnings of herding, is the actual object, the sheaf of corn or the individual animal, worshipped. With the domestication of animals and the planting of crops we have reached the generative sources of wealth, which mark the transition to the second or " proprietary " period of society, as Dr. Keasbey calls it. They mark also a striking change ill religious conceptions. Wealth, the satisfaction of wants, is no longer reached by cooperative effort to obtain certain individual objects; it is bound up rather in the collective units of herds and harvests, and more than this, in those great invisible forces of nature which determine the increase of these. Thus the agricultural god becomes the spirit of fertility, or the still more remote giver of good grain, the pastoral god, the lord of increase, the chief patriarch and spiri- tual leader of the hosts, a conception which easily develops into anthropomorphic monotheism. As among totemists and pastoral peoples we found aspects of their belief growing out of the necessary social structure, so we find a social origin of beliefs among agriculturists. With this proprietary period and its developed system of ownership, the notion of permanent sovereignty, as rightfully vested in a person or class, something quite different from the tribal leadership given to the chief of greatest prowess, becomes a vital force. We have already noticed how it led to ancestor worship in the patri- archate, where ownership was vested in the heads of families. In an agricultural community, the sovereign landowners, and the chief of these, whether priest or king, easily become .sur- rounded with a halo of divinity, even the present living ruler often being worshipped as a representative of the great ones from whom he is descended. In four great empires in which we find the supreme ruler adored as a divinity and claiming kinship with the gods, in Egypt, Peru, Mexico, and Japan, there are observable two striking characteristics: (1) they all have a well-developed 1 Frazer, ii, p. 375.</page><page sequence="20">Vol. xxiv.] The Economic Study of Religion. 413 agricultural civilization; (2) it is in each case the sun-god from whom the emperor claims descent. These characteristics would naturally go together, as agricultural communities almost inev- itably worship the sun. And where the property is in land one is not surprised to find a deified ruler, since in such states, as chief landowner, he holds almost absolutely in control the wel- fare of his subjects. One may put the proposition tentatively that the sacredness of either chiefs or priests holds a direct relation to their tem- poral power; the more social control a chief or priest has, the more is he accredited with divine attributes. I say chiefs or priests, for a priest may hold this position as well as a king. Indeed, it is sometimes hard to distinguish, except in name, the religiously sacred king from the politically powerful priest. Just to give one instance of the e~ffect on the minds of the people of a pontiff's domination, Frazer tells of one of the priests of the Zapotecs in Southern Mexico, who was " a pow- erful rival of the king himself. This spiritual lord governed Yopaa, one of the chief cities of the kingdom, with absolute dominion." There is the antecedent, now note the consequent. " He was looked on as a god whom the earth was not worthy to hold nor the sun to shine upon."' If we turn to European history, we see that that diluted form of ruler-worship, the doctrine of the divine right of kings, belongs essentially to the absolute monarchy and declines with the growth of constitutionalism. The political organization, of course, changes according to economic needs, and the doctrine has to follow. When a king is absolute and uncontrolled, the theory of his divine right seems justified by the facts. But no doctrine is strong enough to turn back the wheel of necessity. The king is limited by his parliament, and the divine right goes over to the people. Vow populi vox dei. I do not believe that either in the absolute monarchies or the limited the idea of divine authority is fostered by a conscious utility, an effort to preserve the existing status. But the social structure must and will be determined by necessity. And when it changes, the belief that grew out of the old organization dies a natural death, though like all beliefs it dies hard and I Frazer, i, p. 118.</page><page sequence="21">414 Ai. Morris, [1903. holds on tenaciously in out-of-the-way corners; and a new belief grows up to justify the new order of things that has come about. Thus the worship of the living hero-gods, as the worship of ancestors, grows out of the social organization. Side by side with the typical pastoral and agricultural gods, which originate directly in economic pursuits, there develop religious concep- tions from the type of organization incident upon those pur- suits. The patriarch and the sovereign lord of vast fertile lands are given control over their fellows by virtue of opportunities made for them in the course of the community's efforts to adapt itself to its environment. Being thus exalted, they are revered and even worshipped as gods. And this reverence paid them turns again to the advantage of the people, for it ensures social stability, makes permanent the type of organization best suited to their needs. So far we have been able to trace a reflection of economic conditions in various objects of worship. But what can we say of stone gods, of those numerous idols and fetiches ranging from the medicine-man's charm to the elaborately carved mono- lith ? This worship of stones does not seem to follow the same simple economic law as that, for instance, of plants and animals. In the case of the latter, where the same plant or animal is worshipped by different tribes, we are pretty sure to find a similarity of economic conditions. But stones are adored bv all kinds of people and with no apparent reference to their utility. It is most important to note in this connection that stones are worshipped as representatives or dwelling places of the deity, rather than as actual gods. And although sacred stones are found in every land, there is a difference in the gods these stones are supposed to represent. We must look then for our economic influences not in the fact of stone-worship but in its nature. The Peruvians, worshippers of the sun, adored certain stones as representatives of the sun; in Canaanitish Syria a certain conical stone was regarded as the emblem of fertility; while in Tanna, New Hebrides, " Mr. Gray . . . found a piece of sacred ground on which were deposited the stones in which they sup- posed the spirits of their departed ancestors to reside."' The I Jevons, p. 231; Allen, pp. 107, 196.</page><page sequence="22">Vol. xxiv.] Y17e Econromic Study of Religion. 415 sunll, fertility, and ancestors, characteristic objects of worship of these three peoples, are all associated with sacred stones. And stones are used to represent different gods even with a single tribe. Take for example this description of the Samoans' worship of stones picked up out of the river: " One resembling a fish would be prayed to as the fisherman's god, another resembling a yam would be the yam god."' Apparently the yam god and the fisherman's god already exist as deities in the minds of the Samoans, and the shape of the stone suggests its use as an embodiment or representative. A more artistic peo- ple would not wait for natural resemblances, but would carve. an image. The point I want to make is that the worship of stones, as that of stocks and images, in itself can teach us very little. The significant thing is the conception that is back of the external embodiment. What does the god thus represented do for the people? If my general thesis holds, the answer to this question would express in each case the peculiar needs of the people, an idealization of the objects, forces, or qualities most important to them. Like the worship of stones, the worship of natural forces, of wind, sky, weather, and the like, does not seem to belong to any one economic period. Mr. Jevons identifies it in one place with a herding life, but later shows that the agriculturist also has his nature-gods. He says: "There are several natural forces with which and on which the herdsman has to reckon; streams, fountains, clouds, the sky, the moon. In the pastoral stage man's interests have become wide enough to make him desire the cooperation of all these forces, and all, it is hardly nec- essary to remark, came to be worshipped by him in consequence." A little further on Mr. Jevons says that the agriculturist felt his dependence on the sun and earth, and seeking their cobpera- tion added them to the list of deities. This explanation of Mr. Jevons's2 is distinctly economic, and is based on the theory, taken as a working hypothesis in this paper, that a feeling of dependence upon a certain thing leads to its worship. I am inclined to question, however, whether the dependence upon natural forces and their consequent worship I Allen, p. 99. 2 Given in Ch. xvii of his Introduction.</page><page sequence="23">416 M. Miorris, [1903. is limited to herdsmen and agriculturists. While it is true that among agricultural and pastoral peoples we find a great deal of nature-worship, it is found also among such people as the Bush- men, who have no cattle and not the slightest rudiments of agriculture, but, like all people that live out of doors, they have an interest in changes of sky and weather. They address prayers to the sun, moon and stars, and regard the moon as a person whose hair is the clouds. This fact prevents us from accepting in full the theory that nature-worship originates in the needs of herders and tillers of the soil. It does not, how- ever, disturb the general principle on which this theory is based; viz. that man, more crudely and obviously in the earlier stages of civilization, forms his concepts of divinity from his own par- ticular needs. Therefore, as Mr. Jevons says, the herders and agriculturists worship the forces on which their herds and crops depend; and therefore, I would add, the Bushmen worship the sun, the moon, and the rain, which affect their well-being although they have no crops and herds. The only change we have to make in Mr. Jevons's *theory is to enlarge the circle of those who depend upon wind and sun and rain. We cannot limit nature-worship in general as belonging to any one period of economic growth. But there is one form of nature-worship that belongs to pastoral and agricultural peoples, and to them distinctively, that is the worship of the principle of increase as apart from actual natural objects. For it is to increase of cattle or of grain that these people must look for their very existence; if the fields and herds are productive they are prosperous, if not they die. Stones and natural forces are not the only objects of worship which spread over more than one economic period. Another widespread worship is that of the source of success in man's own doings, the "gods of human activities," we might call them, sometimes referred to as departmental gods. Of these we cannot say that they belong to any particular period or peo- ple. But we can say that the activity deified shows the type of civilization, and further that it is the activities which it is profitable to that civilization to encourage that are given into the hands of departmental gods. For example, the Roman Mars, and all the war gods of nations that live by their military</page><page sequence="24">Vol. xxiv.] The Economic Study of Religion. 417 prowess, are not more striking than the Mexican gods of com- merce and of the pursuit of agriculture.' These gods are usually anthropomorphic, but they are not, like the human gods, actual dwellers upon this earth, mere mortals, who for leadership have been vested during their lifetime with a halo of divinity; or who as ancestors or nationat heroes have acquired it through the perspective of a dimly recorded past. Like the human gods, however, their worship grows out of the necessities of social organization, and is justi- fied ex post ,ficto by the benefits society receives from it. In this they differ from the gods men find in the outer world. We saw that the worship of natural objects, such as plants and animals, and of the generative forces of nature, arose in men's exaltation of the things that satisfied their needs, that men thought of their gods in the guise of the things on which their life depended. In the worship of human beings and of human enterprises, the belief is justified by its good results, for accord- ing to popular logic, ancient or modern, when a theory works well for practical living it must be true. That practical values determine religious concepts is the explanation, I believe, of the correspondence between the type of civilization and the type of belief. These practical values determine beliefs in various ways. Men may embody in their concept of the deity the things on which they are peculiarly dependent, or they may exalt to the level of gods harmful things, such as alligators and serpents, which they dread; or again these practical values may influence beliefs indirectly by serving as a test of truth. Naturally the worship of things good and evil in its crudest form was prevalent before there was any conception of natural law; when the savage thought of the various things that affected his welfare as animated by good and evil beings. Gradually, with the utilizing of the forces of nature in pastoral and agricultural life, there came a better understanding of natural causes, and these controlling beings were pushed farther and farther away into unknown regions and became more spiri- ' Lang, op. cit., ii, p. 78. The Lithuanian " departmental gods " have lately been subjected to a rather destructive critique by Zupitza, in the Journal of the Verein fur Volkskunde, 1901, p. 844.</page><page sequence="25">418 1. Morris, [1903. tual. The final death-blow of these phenomenon-controlling persons came in the development of the industrial system, with its scientific discoveries and unifying tendencies culminating in the notion of the universal reign of law. This idea, it was predicted, would overthrow religion. But such has not been its effect. It has merely substituted for supernaturalism the theory of the Divine Immanence. What room, we may ask, has this left for utility as a determining factor in faith ? The simple deification of the useful and harmful we can no longer expect. The influence of practical values on the most advanced relig- ions is rather in the tendency to make human virtues that are useful to society, such as justice, kindness, truthfulness, attri- butes of the Deity, and in the tendency which -exists now, no less than in earlier times, to judge a faith by its results rather than by its a priori reasonableness. Up to this point I have been considering the theoretical side of religion, and have been trying to trace the relation of some of the various beliefs of mankind to the economic conditions in the midst of which they are produced. Interesting as this task may be, it is incomplete and one-sided, since there is no religion without a cult, no sincere faith which does not say to the believer, "thou shalt" and "thou shalt not." But I have left what few suggestions I have about the practical side of religion for separate consideration because, as I noted earlier, the explanation of rules of conduct is not to be found in the faith in whose name they are promulgated. If we would seek their origin, we must look to actual conditions rather than theories. In some respects the study of religious observances is easier than that of religious ideas because there is less chance for con- servatism to confuse the different periods. While there are no very disastrous results if a people's beliefs are more in harmony with an outgrown civilization than with the present one; in the question of conduct, if changed conditions demand new rules of action, the need is urgent and strong enough to break down any barriers of prejudice. A difficulty, however, arises in trying to draw boundary lines. Broadly speaking, we are concerned here with all religious com- mands, whether ceremonial or ethical. From the point of view of the worshipper, the motive for these is the same, and the exhor-</page><page sequence="26">Vol. xxiv.] Lie Economic Study of Reliqion. 419 tation to fasting, sacrifice, and prayer bears the same relation to religious life at one time as the preaching of honesty and kind- liness does at another. From the point of view of the student, however, there is a significant difference. Morality, the relation of men toward one another, is distinctly social, and its charac- ter depends upon the necessities of an organized community; whereas prayers and sacrifices may be observed by the individual alone, and be concerned with purely individual welfare. Thus morality begins with a stable social organization. Before this, human relations are merely those of the primitive family, for which a very meagre code suffices. A moral law sanctioned by religion develops only in a larger community. Sometimes, it is true, the ceremonial law may become as social in its bearings as the moral law, as, for instance, in religious festivals and the coming together of the tribe for worship. But the moral law is in its very nature social. Even in the case of taboo, the savage shrinks from breaking taboo not only as an individual but as a member of society. The great difference between taboo and morality is, as Mr. Lang has pointed out, that whereas with taboo the punishment is directly the result of the act, being brought about by the effects of suggestion, the consequences of breaking a moral law come not automatically, but because the gods are judges of men's conduct. But the common purpose of taboo and moral laws and their common effect on the social system makes it prof- itable to treat them in the same category. I do not mean to assert here that all taboos and all moral laws are socially useful. I maintain only that the condition of survival of a taboo, as of a moral precept, is its social utility. In every group of human beings certain restrictions on indi- vidual preference are necessary in order that the group may survive, or in order that it may make the best of the opportuni- ties the environment offers. These restrictions, garnished in the savage state with all sorts of half-understood imaginings, their sanction growing more reasonable as knowledge and civili- zation advance, form the basis of the systems of taboo and morality. Hence a certain type of morality will always be found among people of the same manner of life, that is, a cer- tain type for all hunters, another for pastoral peoples, and still another for agriculturists; and in each case the virtues extolled</page><page sequence="27">420 AL. Morris, [1903. and sanctioned by religion will be those that are most needed in that sort of community. With economic progress, the relationships to be adjusted by morality become more complex. At first there is only the rela- tion of parents to one another and to their offspring; then with need to cooperate for production and to live together in commu- nities, men must be adjusted to one another as equal individuals forming a tribal unit, as well as family groups; later with the division into classes brought about by herding and agriculture, there is not only the morality governing the relationships of the members of each class, but also the relationship of the classes to one another; with the commercial era comes the competitive system, breaking down old class distinctions to build up new ones, and bringing characteristic problems of its own. Iu each period religion sanctions the rules of conduct growing out of the needs of the social structure. It cannot be ignored, however, by the student of history, that religion has often sanc- tioned not only what was good for society as a whole, but what was good for one class at the expense of arkother. When all men were free and equal, before agriculture and herding made it possible for a small number to monopolize a large proportion of this world's goods, the commands of religion restricted the individual for the sake of his own betterment and for the wel- fare of society. When property and power came into the hands of a few, the few were not slow to claim a divine right to it, and to support their position by inculcating the virtues of obe- dience, honesty, and submission in the minds of the many. Per- haps I may suggest that these moral precepts were accepted as authoritative because they assured stability to the social and industrial order which was best adapted at that stage to make the most of the environment. There have been abuses, but on the whole moral laws which had more than an ephemeral exist- ence have been in the deepest sense serviceable to society as a whole. In correlating morality and economic conditions, it is important to keep in mind the distinction between the problems of produc- tion and of distribution, and to show how rules of conduct have grown out of each of these. For example, in a hunting tribe the ideals of bravery, of obedience and loyalty to the chief, grow out of the exigencies of the chase; those of fairness and</page><page sequence="28">Vol. xxiv.] The Economtic Study of Religion. 421 honesty from dividing the spoil; and in our own times we have the morality of production in the ideals of conscientious thor- oughness and reliability in work; the morality of distribution, not only in the command to respect property rights, but like-' wise in the exhortation to benevolence. The study of ritual might profitably be approached in the same way, and particularly the important question of sacrifice. Much might be learned of the relation of sacrifice to production by asking such questions as, What do the people sacrifice ? and what relation does it bear to the nature of the food supply? (for it is usually food that is sacrificed); and of the function of sacrifice in distribution by such questions as,-What is done with the sacrifice ? is it utterly destroyed, eaten by all the wor- shippers, or given to a certain class, as the rulers or priests ? I believe that in every case the sacrificial custom would be found to have a distinct social or economic value. In this short space it would be impossible for me to go over the various familiar kinds of sacrifice, and even attempt to sug- gest the sort of economic organization they were associated with. But I should like to stop for a moment to consider one kind of sacrifice which seems to puzzle many students, the sacrifice by animal worshippers of the animal to itself. Mr. Frazer and Mr. Jevons, among others, seem to think it unnatural for people to kill the animal they worship, and regard this sort of sacrifice as a difficult problem requiring some mysti- cal explanation. The apparent inconsistency seems to have troubled also the pious totemists and herders themselves. And savages and sages vie with one another in inventing elaborate explanations and curious mystical doctrines. The explanations given by the worshippers themselves are probably the outcome of the desire for unity and harmony in the religious life, which is familiar to everyone. Man likes to think his actions the result of his beliefs. And if he cannot make them so, he must in some way justify their apparent con- tradiction. Theorists often take this secondary justification as the cause of the action. Thus the difficulty with most explana- tions of this totemistic sacrifice is that the writers try to account for it on the basis of animal-worship, and so have to invent elaborate theories as to why the savage thought it a good thing to kill the god.</page><page sequence="29">422 X1. Morris, [1903. But if we give up the idea that the custom must be the logical outcome of the belief, and look for separate origins of each, the problem is much simpler. I think it will be found in nearly all instances that the animal worshipped is part of the food of the community. We can see in this fact a reason for both the worship and the sacrifice. The animal is worshipped because it is useful to the community, because they have a feeling of dependence for life upon it. And on the other hand, the animal is sacrificed because, again, it is useful. Sacrifice is the giving up of something really valuable to the worshipper. There are two kinds of sacrifice of the animal to itself, which economically are to be sharply distinguished: the sacramental, in which the animal is eaten as a communion of the worshipper with the deity; and the piacular, in which as a rule the flesh of the animal is either destroyed or eaten by the priests, and entirely given up on the part of the worshipper. In the sacramental sacrifice we find that the animal is the occasional and extraordinary food of the worshipper, as in the case of pastoral tribes, who cannot afford to kill their cattle often, and limit the eating of flesh to religious festivals. The idea of communion also serves to bring the tribe into a closer social bond. In the piacular sacrifice, there is of course the supposed advantage to the worshipper that the sacrifice will bring for- giveness of his sins and avert the wrath of an offended deity. Is there, besides this, an unconscious benefit in the observance ? I think there is undoubtedly. Incidentally, where the flesh of the animal is eaten by the priests, it is in this way that they are compensated for their spiritual services, and are at least par- tially supported. But more than this, ,the chief utility of piac- ular sacrifice is obtained even when the animal is destroyed. There is a moral benefit in that the need of sacrifice to atone for sin impresses the moral law forcibly upon the worshipper. Sacrifice as we think of it technically, in the sense of placing material offerings on the altar, has had its day and passed into the archives of history. The spirit of sacrifice is still a vital element in religion, and still, through its disciplining force of self-denial, enables men to grow and advance. Nor has its distributive function fallen into disuse. Not offerings of food, now, but freewill offerings of money to purchase food, support</page><page sequence="30">Vol. xxiv.1 The Economic Sttdy of Religion. 423 the clergy; and in the name of religion, how many schools, libraries, and benevolent institutions are supported. One main point on which our divergent sects unite is in preaching that religion impresses upon man his debt of material goods, time, and service to his fellow-man. Thus in modern times an important part of ceremonial law has fused with the field of morality, the relation of man to man. There is a strong socializing of religion. To-day the most religious man is not the one most given to fasting and penances and church-going, but the man who for religion's sake grapples hardest with social problems.' What remains of ceremonial law, or ritual, is prayer. I shall not attempt to analyse the value of prayer, but merely leave the subject with a suggestion of Prof. James's: "The appear- ance is that in this phenomenon something ideal, which in one sense is part of ourselves, and in another sense is not ourselves, actually exerts an influence, raises our centre of personal energy, and produces regenerative effects unattainable in other ways."2 Prayer thus, in its effect upon the worshipper, has a distinct value. In this brief consideration of some religious phenomena, I have treated separately the speculative and practical sides of religion in order to show their independent origin in human needs. Yet it must not be forgotten that while the union of these comes secondarily it does inevitably come. So that we have not isolated beliefs and observances, but religions; and if there is anything in the economic laws of thought, a definite type of religion as a whole for every type of community. This religion, as soon as a group of men become sufficiently settled to be called a community, has its organization. And one of the most interesting problems of the sociological study of religion is the relation of this organization to the stcial and political structure. Political changes of course-affect religious ideas and religious organizations where there is a state religion, and the worship expands with the boundaries: as when Babylon became an empire, 1 To anyone who is interested in following up this socializing tendency, Peabody's " Jesus Christ and the Social Question," and Coe's " Religion of a Mature Mind " will prove suggestive. 2 The Varieties of Religious Experience, p. 523.</page><page sequence="31">424 1. Morris, [1903. and the chief god of the city of Babylon, Marduk, was made the head of a pantheon, "extending his jurisdiction over a territory equal to Babylonian control," l and as in the Pelew Islands where " each tribe and each family has its own totem god, and as a tribe developes into a state, the god of the family or tribe which is most important politically becomes the highest god." 2 We have a curious example of the change in religion incident upon change in tribal affiliation among the Fantis and Ashantis of the African Gold Coast. " The southern tribes of the Gold Coast, Fantis, form one confederation; the northern tribes, Ashantis, a rival and more powerful confederation. Each has its own federal god . . . . and whenever a tribe revolts from the Ashantis, it renounces the Ashanti god, Tondo, and is admitted to the southern confederation by joining the worship of Bobowissi." The history of the Greek states also shows the effect of political expansion on the religious organization and religious ideas. "The political union of Eleusis with Athens entailed admission of all Athenian citizens to the worship of the Eleusinian goddess. But the Athenians thus admitted imported their ideas, religious and mythological, into the worship." 3 In these few cases, we have been considering only state religions, where- the religious community and the state were coextensive, and so it was a matter of course that to extend national boundaries was to increase the number of adherents to the faith. I believe that the effect of political change on the constitution and membership of the religious community will be found as real, if not as direct and simple, where the state is not the religious unit. The old idea of history, perhaps nowhere better exemplified than in the philosophy of Auguste Comte, that one stage holds in itself the seeds of the next, which must inevitably follow, is fast giving way to the conception that like conditions produce like results, and that in different environments history will fol- low diverse courses, sometimes skipping two or three stages altogether. This historical theory makes one cautious in speak- ing of general tendencies. Whether it will finally hold or not in the form in which its supporters now present it, its results have been striking enough to make it worth while to study with I Jastrow, Study of Religion, p. 297. 2 Jevons, p. 181. 3 Jevous, pp. 239, 370.</page><page sequence="32">Vol. xxiv.] T'lhe Economic Study of Religion. 425 constant reference to conditions rather than sequence of devel- opment. Accordingly when we find individual religions, state religions, religions to which only the men of the tribe are admitted, as in Australia, "Ifree" religions, such as the Greek thiasi of the sixth century B. C., that grow up side by side with the nation- ally established cult, or, finally our own present ideal of a " free church in a free state," we should ask, not which came first, but under what political and economic conditions each one developed. Along with changes in the organization of the religious com- munity go changes in its leadership, the priesthood. The priest- hood holds a certain relation to the social order as a whole. In a slightly organized community where there is social equality, the priest appears as medicine-man or sorcerer, self-appointed and holding office by virtue-of his personal influence. Such a priest is found among the Fuegians, where equality is so perfect that " even a piece of cloth is torn in shreds and distributed, and no one individual becomes richer than another," only " the doctor- wizard of each party has much influence with his companions." ' In the more coherent hunting clan, such as that of the Dakota Indians, it is the war-chief who is priest.2 A more definitely organized priesthood arises with the beginning of the proprietary period. Among patriarchal people such as the Damarras of Africa, and the Homeric Greeks,' the patriarch is priest for the family, the chief or king for the state. And among people with a developed agricultural civilization, like the Peruvians and Egyp- tians, there is a distinct priestly class. This connection of the nature of the priesthood with the character of the state must be more than a chance one. To discover exactly what it is and what laws it follows is one of the problems of the social study of religion. Such scattered instances as have been given here of beliefs and observances which apparently result from the people's life have led me to formulate tentatively the proposition with which I began the second part of this paper. It seems to be true that there is a tendency to idealize what is economically useful, to bring it up out of the sphere of economics and identify it with the deepest concepts of the religious consciousness; and that religion, again, gives its sanction to the form of organization, 'Lang, op. cit., i, p. 114. 2 Lang, i, p. 112. 3 Jevons, p. 290; Lang, i, p. 256.</page><page sequence="33">426 Morris, The Economic Study of Religion. [1903. the ritual and the moral precepts which have grown out of industrial necessities. If any one objects to this theory on the ground that it makes religion a mere handmaid of material greed, I would remind him that we do not judge of the value of things by their origin. The theory has nothing to say about the truth of the ideas thus produced, nor of the rightness of the moral judgments. And, moreover, to say that religious concepts take the form of what satisfies men's needs is not to limit them to material satisfaction. Religiop grows out of purely material needs only in earliest times, among savages whose wants go little beyond material necessities, and whose gods are crudely materialistic. Religion grows loftier in proportion as men's desires take a more ideal form. I stated in the beginning that what the science of religion wants is a law of religious development which should have, like biological laws, the element of continuity. The principle I have suggested here meets, to a certain extent, I think, this require- ment,-the principle that men tend to idealize and deify the particular things and qualities which are useful to people gain- ing a livelihood as they do; and that those customs are sanc- tioned by religion which are socially useful. The element of continuity comes in because only people who thus idealized the important factors of their civilization could make progress. Only such people could make use of the possibilities of their environment, and reach that high state of economic development on which civilization and culture and moral and intellectual progress depend. It remains to be seen whether this principle will adequately explain all important religious phenomena. That can be tested only by a series of studies. In the first place, one would have to investigate thoroughly the economics, social organization, and religion of some primitive tribe to see the simple effect of the environment on religious development. Then it would be necessary to take some tribe or nation -xwhich had passed through several economic stages, and always allowing for the action of conservatism, relate at every point its secular and religious his- tory. Finally, one would have to study tribes that have been conquered, or have amalgamated with other tribes, to know how conquest, proselytism, and imitation alter the regular course of development.</page></plain_text>
