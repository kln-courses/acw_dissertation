<plain_text><page sequence="1">Can the Mountain Gorillas Be Saved? A Communication from Raymond A. Dart THIS COMMUNICATION came from Dr. Dart as we were going to press with a story (p. 332) indicating how much we are likely soon to learn by study of mountain gorillas in their natural habitat. For a map showing locations mentioned, see our March issue, p. 94.-EDITOR. AT THE REQUEST of the Council of the South African Association for the Ad- vancement of Science, there was drawn up and published recently a "Memoran- dum on the Preservation of the African Great Apes" (R. A. Dart, South African Journal of Science, 1960). On the adop- tion of the memorandum by the Coun- cil, a copy was referred to the Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa. Copies were referred also to all Associa- tions for the Advancement of Science, everywhere, for their information, and with the suggestion that, in the event that they endorsed the principles in- volved, they make suitable representa- tions (1) to inform their own national organisations for the preservation of flora and fauna, and (2) to inform their governments, so that official bodies could be assisted in giving directives to their representatives in any future dis- cussions concerning the preservation of African flora and fauna that affected the African great apes. Since UNESCO had informed us that only thirteen countries other than South Africa have such Associations, steps are now being taken to forward the memorandum to the principal scientific bodies in all countries. The imperfections in modern mech- anisms of communication among scien- tists, in regard to matters of common interest and urgency, highlight the po- tential importance of the Wenner-Gren Foundation's action in establishing CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY. Its world cir- culation affords a means of putting be- fore scientists dedicated to the study of mankind the serious fact of the appar- ently inevitable extinction of the moun- tain gorilla, and it can thereby enable the scientists to, in turn, bring the facts directly to the attention of all who can assist in precluding such a fate. Even late in 1959, when a memoran- dum from A. Kortlandt informed me about the virtual extinction of the orang-utan in Indonesia, through the removal of such restraints as had pre- viously existed, I laboured under the misapprehension that, even if the Asi- atic anthropoids were doomed, the Af- rican great apes might persist for some time. Doubtless this misapprehension is shared by thousands of my fellow scien- tists throughout the world. But this comfortable illusion was shattered in mid-March, 1960, when M. Degen, Ad- ministrative Secretary, at Bukavu on Lake Kivu, of the Commission de Co- operation Technique en Afrique au Sud du Sahara (Conseil Scientifique pour l'Afrique au Sud du Sahara), ad- dressed a letter to our Council, thank- ing our Association for what had been done and requesting it to publicize the fact that the conservation of the gorillas living between Mikeno-Karasimbi vol- canoes in the Albert Park was in im- mediate danger. This letter was accom- panied by a document dealing with the history of the Albert Park, drawn up by the Institut des Parcs Nationaux du Congo Belge and transmitted from the London offices of the CCTA/CSA. The Council of our Association requested me to translate the document and have it published as soon as possible in the South African Journal of.Science to- gether with an appended report by George B. Schaller (University of Wis- consin, U.S.A.) on the actual condition of that area today. Obviously, miny an- thropologists in various parts of the world, who may be able to assist directly or indirectly toward the objective of preserving the African great apes, do not receive the South African Journal of Science. Thus the translated text of the document from L'Institut des Parcs Nationaux du Congo Belge, togethex with Schaller's report, are reproduced verbatim also, on the opposite page. It is patent from this document and report, and from the "winds of change" circulating through Africa at this time, that the only hope of salvaging for posterity the relict faunal treasures of this and other continents lies in the enlightened understanding of world leaders. That, in turn, depends on the extent to which Associations for the Ad- vancement of Science and similar bod- ies in all countries can awaken their governments and representatives at the United Nations Organization and UNESCO to act in the preservation of a heritage which fortunately still exists and belongs, not to any single country or people, but to humanity as a whole.

As a result of extreme vigilance, we have been able to avoid any modification of the habitat of these anthropoids. Today the gravity of the situation forces us to appeal to international opinion with the hope of being able in this way to avoid an irreparable loss to science. We venture to hope that you will assist us in our effort by using every means at your disposal so as to augment our vigorous protests against the violation of a sanctuary, where there live today the last representatives of an anthropomorphic progeny whose disappearance would have a criminal quality. Sd./ Institut des Parcs Nationaux du Congo Belge THE PRESERVATION OF THE GORILLAS IN THE PARC NATIONAL ALBERT IS THREATENED IN 1920, the American naturalist Carl Akeley explored the region of the Kivu volcanoes to collect information about a type of gorilla whose presence there had been reported. It concerned a particular race adapted to the conditions of the rug- ged climate prevailing at an elevation of more than 3,000 metres. The number of these anthropoids did not appear to be great. Carl Akeley's ob- servations threw into relief the necessity for assuring the protection of this nucleus of strange beings of gigantic bodily propor- tions. King Albert interested himself person- ally in the preservation of these gorillas and in 1925 he signed a decree creating a reserve, named "Parc National Albert," set aside to render the territory where they lived inviolate. During a further research expedition, conducted in 1926, Carl Akeley died in the very heart of this sanctuary for the crea- tion of which he had struggled. He was buried at Kabara at a height of 3,200 metres between the extinct volcanoes Mikeno and Karasimbi. To assure the preservation of the habitat of the gorillas, to assure also the conserva- tion of the forests that cover the flanks of the volcanoes and whose presence condi- tions the climatic equilibrium of all that Kivu region, it was regarded as essential to extend protection to the immediately neighbouring regions. In 1929 a new decree incorporated in the initial reserve all the region of the Virunga volcanoes, thus as- suring a protective belt around the gorilla habitat. In order to free the protected region from all extraneous influences, the admin- istration of the Parc National Albert was entrusted to an independent institution which, in 1934, took the title of Institute of the National Parks of the Belgian Congo. As a result of these far-sighted measures, the sanctuary of the gorillas was freed from all human interference during more than thirty years. With the object of ensuring amidst the most complete quietude the de- velopment of some gorilla families, whose presence had been established in 1925, the Institute of the National Parks did not allow other than a few rare entries into the sanctuary. Actually the number of gorillas living in the region is estimated at more than 350, a fact that demonstrates the efficiency of the protection from which they have bene- fited. The gorilla sanctuary is situated partly in the Congo and partly in Ruanda- tJrundi. Unfortunately, in Ruanda a cult of cattle is practised, introduced by the Watutsi who came formerly from the re- gion of the Nile. The social importance of their proprietor is dependent upon the number of heads of cattle he possesses; fur- ther, no beasts are sacrificed for consump- tion as food. This fruitless pasturage has led to a total disappearance of wooded vegetation and erosion of the whole coun- tryside, where only a few shreds of forest remain, such as those covering the sides of the volcanoes. A strong demographic pressure has had as its corollary an increment of beasts and an insufficiency of pastures; augmented by cultural development it has induced the herdsmen to thrust their herds into the forests of the Parc National Albert. For many years our institution has been struggling in vain to put a stop to these disastrous inroads that result in the dis- appearance of the forest cover. But, bereft of support from administrative and ju- dicial authorities, the Institute has seen that it is powerless to arrest this invasion. Under the pressure of the Ruanda- Urundi government a retrocession of some 7,000 hectares (or approximately 17,000 acres) of the Parc National Albert has had to be accepted, in the hope that that con- cession would permit the responsible au- thorities to regulate their pastures and to take appropriate measures to moderate the multiplication of livestock composed for the most part of worthless and sickly beasts. That procedure has been useless and the herdsmen have continued to thrust their herds further and further into the Parc National Albert with impunity. Today after twenty-five years of protec- tive efforts, the mountain gorillas in their sanctuary are threatened with irremedi- able destruction. Under the auspices of the Institute an American mission has been devoting itself for about a year to a thorough study of the gorillas in the vicinity of the Mikeno and Karasimbi volcanoes. Herewith we are sending to you a copy of the report drawn up by George B. Schaller, member of that mission. This report is significant; if meas- ures are not taken without delay, a gorilla population, probably unique in the world, will vanish. Paralysed by political considerations, there is every reason to fear that the au- thorities will maintain their passive atti- tude. Consequently we are making an urgent appeal to international opinion in order that vigorous protests may be raised against the destruction of this scientific patrimony, the sanctuary of the gorillas of the Parc National Albert. Motives both moral and humane should inspire con- certed action to save these anthropoids from certain extinction. THE CONSERVATION OF GORILLAS IN THE VIRUNGA VOLCANOES THE NUMBERS of gorillas in Parc Albert probably exceed 350 animals. The heaviest concentration occurs in the area lying be- tween Mikene, Visoka and Karasimbi. Ten troops, comprising over 170 animals, have so far been encountered there. In the area between Visoka and Sabinio on the Congo side of the Parc, gorillas appear to be scarce, but between Sabinio and Muha- vura, an area where the gorillas wander freely between Ruanda and Muhavura, four troops totalling over 40 animals have been noted over the past year. The Ruanda section of the Parc has not been visited by the author. Habitat Preference The area with the most abundant food supply and the largest concentration of gorillas is the Hagenia forest, between about 2,800 and 3,500 meters altitude. Bamboo, which covers a major portion of the Parc below 2,800 meters, furnishes ample food only during the wetter periods of the year when bamboo shoots and ten- der green stems are present. Other habitats such as the Muhavura saddle and the giant senecio zone above 3,500 meters are visited only sporadically and do not appear to support many animals. Conservation Poaching for red forest duiker and bush- buck appears to be fairly extensive in some sectors, especially Kibumba. Snares are en- countered as high as 3,500 meters on the slopes of Karasimbi, and recently a hunt- ing party apparently killed a buffalo near the Rukumi "gite. However, at present, gorillas rarely appear to be molested di- rectly. Habitat destruction is the greatest dan- ger facing the gorillas in the Virunga vol- canoes. On the Uganda side, the most de- sirable gorilla habitat lies outside the Forest Reserve and will be converted into shambas within about 3 years. Much of Mount Muhavura is already entirely un- suitable for gorillas. Two large tracts of Parc Albert on the Ruanda side have al- ready been returned to the natives un- officially. Although the habitat today appears to be still adequate for the support of the gorilla population, the animal will in the future not be able to survive if the present destruction by Watusi cattle continues. Watusi and their cattle venture far into the Congo side of the Parc. A visit into the area between Visoke and Sabinio in July, 1959, showed countless old cattle trails and huts over a mile into the Congo. More re- cently in December, 1959, and January, 1960, several hundred cattle were noted from the Ruanda border as far as 4 miles into the Congo, north and north-west of Visoka. A deep, well-used cattle trail en- ters the Congo south-west of and at the base of Visoka. At present, habitat de- struction by cattle is primarily confined to some sectors at altitude below 3,000 meters. Although this is undoubtedly detrimental to the gorilla and other forms of wild life, an extension of this intrusion and an in- vasion into the Hagenia forest could well prove fatal to the perpetuation of wild life in the Virunga volcanoes.
