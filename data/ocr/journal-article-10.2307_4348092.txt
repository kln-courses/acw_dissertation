<plain_text><page sequence="1">OCTOBER 1974 THE CLASSICAL WORLD 97 A NOTE ON ANTIGONE 1043-44 In a somewhat confusing note to this line, Sir Richard Jebb obscured what the actual pious position was regarding man's ability to pollute the gods.I At this point in the play, Creon, in the heat of his argument with Teiresias, asserts that he will not permit the burial of Polyneices even if the eagles carry the corpse up to the very throne of Zeus. Creon defends his position by saying, "For well I know that no man can pollute the gods (theous miainein)."2 Jebb does not believe this reflects any sort of skepticism. Rather it is an expression of "The most orthodox Greek piety. . ." But is it really? In defense of this position, Jebb cites Euripides, Hercules Furens 1232: "Why? Being a mortal you do not pollute things divine (ou miaineis . .. ta ton theon)." Very likely Sophocles would not have appreciated an argument which relied on a statement of Euripides to determine what orthodox Greek piety was, or to determine what his own personal religious views were con- cerning one of his plays. Sophocles' thought was much more in accordance with traditional Greek religious attitudes, whereas Euripides, while not ignoring the importance of the emotional and religious aspects of man's ac- tions, tended to reflect the secular and moral concerns of the fifth-century enlightenment of the sophists.3 Moreover, the character in Euripides who ex- presses the same sort of sentiment as Creon is Theseus. In Hercules Furens this hero represents a panhellenic ideal of moderation, friendship, and toleration.4 The mood of the play at this point is one of enlightened con- ciliation between the heroes of the two great military protagonists at the time the play was performed. On the other hand, the passage in the Antigone oc- curs in a very excited and antagonistic exchange, and the sentiment is ex- pressed by a man who has fallen seriously into excessive thought and action. Jebb correctly recognized Creon's agitated and confused state of mind. However, Jebb's clarifying note is no less confused. He described the general maxim, "no man can pollute the gods," as an expression of "the most or- thodox Greek piety," but it is also a "sophism ... of the kind with which an honest but stubborn and wrongheaded man might seek to quiet his con- science. Creon reveres Zeus (304): he feels for the majesty of the gods, and refuses to believe that they can honour the wicked (284ff). But his religious sense is temporarily confused by his anger."

The double meaning which Muller finds in this passage is not convincing in view of the context: he ignores Creon's outright rejection of the idea that man can pollute the gods, and the problem which this raises for the 'Hintersinn' he finds in these lines. 'On Sophocles, see E. R. Dodds, The Greeks and the Irrational (Berkeley 1951) 49. He even cared for the sacred snake of Asclepius until a temple could be built for it in Athens (p. 193).

Robert Connor, 173-74.</page><page sequence="2">98 THE CLASSICAL WORLD OCTOBER 1974 Most of Jebb's discussion misses a fundamental point which Sophocles is making about Creon. Basically, Creon's point of view is political, not religious. Consequently, his religion has become secularized. It is at the ser- vice of the state, and religion must be compatible to the political interests of the polis for Creon to adhere to it. In this passage of the Antigone, $ophocles is commenting on yet another one of the disturbing developments which he thought were disintegrating Greek life in his day.5 In order to answer the primary question of what was the orthodox pious position regarding man's polluting the gods, it is instructive to use another passage from Sophocles: Creon: Even if you do not respect the offspring of mankind, at least have reverence for the flame of lord Helios which nourishes all things. Neither earth, nor holy rain, nor daylight will receive favorably the displaying of such an unconcealed pollution. So get him most speedily into the house, for it is most pious that a kinsman's evils be seen and heard by only kinsmen. (0. T. 1424-31) This occurs at a calmer moment, although it follows a most horrifying sequence of events. Creon is attempting to take command of the situation, and restore order. He is most concerned with doing what is right and proper. Clearly this passage indicates that it was impious for the polluted to come in- to contact with the basic elements: sun, earth, and rain. It indicates that ac- cording to orthodox Greek piety, the proper thing for Heracles in Hercules Furens 1232 to have done was remain out of the sunlight. Neither the words of Theseus in Hercules Furens nor the statement of Creon in Antigone 1043- 44 reflect the orthodox Greek piety which Jebb claimed. Commenting on Hercules Furens 1232, Wilamowitz clarified the meaning of ta theon according to the conception of orthodox Greek piety.6 According to this view, the major components of nature, such as the sun, moon, earth, and rain, were divine. Nature is divine in its unchanpin2 and eternal con- tinuity without the individualized anthropomorphism of the Olympians, who, by comparison, are less absolute than the divine elements of nature. On the basis of the enlightened, but also pious, observations of the Hippocratic author of Peri Hieres Nousou, Wilamowitz showed that orthodox Greek piety maintained that these divine elements of nature could become tainted by coming into contact with human pollution. Consequently, it was necessary that men perform symbolic acts of purification whenever they approached the sacred in order to avoid polluting the divine: At least the divine is what purifies, cleanses, and protects us from our greatest and most impious sins. And we ourselves designate 5 See W. Robert Connor, The New Politicians of Fifth- Century Athens (Princeton 1971) 49-52.

And upon entering them we besprinkle ourselves not for the purpose of defiling ourselves, but rather for purifying ourselves if we should possess some prior pollution.7 Such views were criticized by the more philosophically minded. Euripides, for example, believed that the pollution of the divine occurred only in men's imagination and conscience.8 Sophocles, on the other hand, remained in the archaic, pious, and popular tradition: . . . sondern [Sophocles] beharrt auf dem Standpunkt volkstumlicher Anschauung und legt infolgedessen eben diese Gesinnung einem Frevler, dem Kreon, in Mund, Ant. 1043."9 University of Tennessee J.
