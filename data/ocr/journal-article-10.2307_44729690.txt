Wichita, KS ABSTRACT The Cessna Caravan 1 crew seat/restraint system incorporates many new design features. This system is the result of several iter- ations of development and evaluations using dynamic test procedures. The testing was done at the Protection and Survival Laboratory dynamic impact test track facility of the FAA Civil Aeromedicai Institute. The recommenda- tions of the General Aviation Safety Panel influenced the test procedures and pass /fail criteria for this project. Data from the dynamic tests provided valuable information on features of seat/restraint system design. THE PURPOSE of this paper is to briefly describe the Cessna Caravan 1 crew seat /restraint system development project. This project combined information from recent small airplane research with the implementation of dynamic test pro- cedures to evaluate the features for the seat / restraint system. A historic overview of the project, as well as some actual test results, are presented in this paper. Mr. Rathgeber was an employee of Cessna Aircraft Company at the time the work discussed in this paper was performed. This paper does not necessarily represent the views of the Federal Aviation Administration. BACKGROUND Improving safety is a priority goal for everyone associated with general aviation. The prevention of accidents is recognized as the number one safety consideration in general aviation. (1)* Safety considerations applied to general aviation have contributed to: advance- ments in aircraft design technology, increases ^Numbers in parenthesis designate references at end of paper. in the reliability of systems, and improvements in pilot training. However, even with the most recent innovations for improved safety, general aviation accidents continue to occur. (2) Occu- pant safety considerations continue to provide impetus for improvements in general aviation design. Also, recent engineering research and development efforts supporting general aviation have contributed to a better understanding of crash environments . (3) Three major goals have been identified for vehicle structural crashworthiness . Briefly these goals are: 1. Provide a livable volume; 2. Restrain the occupant to minimize injurious contact with the vehicle interior; and 3. Attenuate the forces experienced by the occupant. (4) Research has examined ways to limit occu- pant impact loads during a crash by controlled yielding of the aircraft subfloor structure (5) or the occupant seat/restraint system. (6) (7) The Caravan 1 crew seat project can be viewed as a combined research and development program in which the last two goals, as well as the usual weight, cost, and functional goals, were applied in the design of the seat/restraint system. PROJECT GOALS The major goals of this project were: 1. To obtain more insight into the small airplane cabin environment as affected by crash dynamics; 2. To establish the parameters which are most important in defining occupant survivability; 3. To define test procedures which would best evaluate the occupant protection provided by the seat/restraint system; 4. To develop a seat/restraint system design which would mfeet the criteria proposed by the Geneťal Aviation Safety Panel . 4.452 0096-736X/86/9404-0452$02.50 Copyright 1986 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">850856 BACKGROUND The Caravan 1 is a large single engine turboprop airplane designed for a diverse set of private, commercial, and utility flight missions. A picture of the airplane is shown in Figure 1. The cabin is large to allow the desired cargo and passenger hauling capabilities. This large cabin size provides the height in the crew area necessary for an energy absorbing (EA) seat design which incorporates a vertical strok- ing seat pedestal. The vertical clearance avail- able between the seat pan and the aircraft floor allows for the energy absorbing stroke of the crew seat as well as the seat adjustment mechan- ism desired for crew member comfort and visibility. Figure 1. The Caravan 1 On February 9, 1983, an ad hoc committee known as the General Aviation Safety Panel sub- mitted a set of findings to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) . The findings were con- cerned with the safety aspects of weather, training, crashworthiness , and the dissemination of safety information. In the discussion of crashworthiness, the Panel pointed out the lack of correlation between static load certification requirements and the dynamic loads of a crash environment . (8) If crashworthiness were going to be a major consideration in general aviation seat/restraint system design, the need for dynamic testing and analysis procedures was apparent. In the next year, the Panel began a program to develop recommendations for dynamic test procedures for seat/restraint systems of small airplanes. As the Panel developed and modified its dynamic test criteria, these con- cepts were integrated into the Caravan 1 crew seat project. Dynamic test procedures were used to evaluate the Caravan 1 seat/restraint system and the loads and motions of the occupant were monitored. Some of the results of this project were provided to the Panel to assist it in developing its test criteria. PROJECT HISTORY The dynamic impact tests required for the Caravan 1 crew seat project were done at the Protection and Survival Laboratory dynamic impact test track facility of the FAA Civil Aeromedicai Institute (CAMI) . This facility has been in operation since 1962 and has been the source of much of the aviation crash impact research done since that time. (9) The project on the Caravan 1 crew seat began in early 1983 and continued into 1984. During this time, many different seat/ restraint system concepts were considered and several of these were evaluated by dynamic testing. Most of the dynamic test criteria pro- posed by the industry safety panel were also evaluated at the CAMI facility during this time period. As with many research and development pro- grams , the Caravan 1 crew seat project did not follow a rigid schedule or test plan. Not only the seat design, but also the test profiles were amended as more was learned from each phase of development and testing. When the project began, the Panel members had not yet agreed on their recommendations for dynamic test criteria. So, test profiles, as well as the seat design, were modified as the project progressed. Once the Panel solidified its recommenda- tions, these were incorporated, as appropriate, into the Caravan 1 crew seat project. A 50th percentile male anthropomorphic dummy was used throughout the project. The dummy used for most of the testing was compatible with the require- ments of 49 CFR 572, Subpart B, but modified to measure pelvic loads. (This is compatible with the Safety Panel recommendations.) Table 1 provides a general overview of the significant tests conducted during this project. Values from the final test profiles recommended by the indus- try panel are also provided for comparison. CRASH DYNAMICS AND HUMAN FACTORS As this project began, the available pub- lished aircraft crashworthiness literature and the documentation from previous dynamic test programs were reviewed in an attempt to establish reasonable guidelines for the Caravan 1 crew seat design and evaluation. The literature of most significance can be divided into two major groups. In the first group are the studies dealing with the dynamics of the general aviation crash event, while the second group contains data addressing human tolerance or injury criteria of the occupants. Only in a few recent studies have the two been combined to provide some insight into the mechanics of general aviation accidents which result in severe injury or fatality. For the purpose of the Caravan 1 crew seat design, the procedures defined by Carden(3) pro- vided a means of establishing an estimate of the deceleration pulse at the floor during impact. These procedures were developed from the measured results of full scale dynamic tests of general 4.453</page><page sequence="3">aviation aircraft at NASA Langley. This analy- tical procedure had two shortcomings as far as its application to the Caravan 1 crew seat project. First, the analysis required detailed knowledge of many parameters associated with an airplane crash. Crash parameters, such as angle of attack at impact, structural crushing dis- tance, and surface friction coefficient can vary greatly from one crash scenario to another; and, in most accident records, these parameters were not accurately documented. Second, the analysis did not allow for a yawed condition of the airplane at impact. Many accident studies show that the crashed airplane was in some degree of yawed condition at impact. These side load components many have a significant effect on the seat/restraint system response. The analysis procedure presented by Carden was determined appropriate for defining a floor pulse for initial design work. Knowledge of the Caravan 1 stall speed and other flight charac- teristics was used to establish an aircraft speed and relative position with the ground at impact. Many proposed crash scenarios were eliminated from consideration because the resulting impact was determined non-survivable due to factors which could not be controlled by the seat/ restraint system. However, available informa- tion provided a reasonable starting point for the study of the Caravan 1 crew seat design. Any research into occupant protection systems must include some study of the human factors associated with such systems. For the Caravan 1 crew seat project, the most important factors were those associated with injury or trauma. Excessive compressive loads in the spine have been shown to be a major source of injury. The effects of these loads on well restrained occupants have been described in several sources, but most notably in the work of Eiband.(lO) From a review of these data, recent results of testing at CAMI, and accident investigation data from the NTSB, the General Aviation Safety Panel developed allowable limits for occupant loads as partial pass/fail criteria for the dynamic seat test recommendations. Specifically these criteria include: (11) 1. Maximum compressive spinal load, as measured in the pelvis of a 49 CFR 572, Subpart B anthropomorphic test dummy, not to exceed 1500 lbs. (6.67kN); 2. Maximum load in individual upper torso straps not to exceed 1750 lbs. (7.78kN), with total upper torso strap loads not to exceed 2000 lbs. (8.90kN); 3. If test analysis shows possible occupant head impact with any portion of the cock- pit or cabin, the Head Impact Criteria (HIC) not to exceed 1000 as determined by test procedures defined in SAE Recommended Practice J921.(19) The first two criteria were incorporated into the Caravan 1 crew seat project as soon as they became available. DESIGN PARAMETERS Using information obtained from the review of crash dynamics and human factors literature, major design parameters were established for the Caravan 1 crew seat project. Initially the per- formance goals were defined based on considera- tions of structural strength, occupant motion limitations, and deceleration "G" levels on the occupant. However, when the Safety Panel pro- posed criteria based on occupant pelvic loads and restraint system loads, these parameters were analyzed as part of this project. By monitoring the floor attachment loads during the tests, data were obtained to evaluate seat strength requirements as well as the strength requirements for the aircraft floor structure. The floor reaction loads were impor- tant factors in determining load distribution and load paths within the seat/restraint system. Since the separation between the crew mem- bers and the instrument panel is limited in all general aviation aircraft, restraining the for- ward motion of the crew seat occupants was impor- tant for the Caravan 1 crew seat/restraint sys- tem performance. This constraint of motion resulted in limitations on the designs for energy absorbers in the seat. Constraining for- ward motion forced the use of design features such as: minimum elongation belt webbing, re- straint system geometry to minimize occupant submarining, and seat attachments which would react the impact loads without structural failure. Compressive spinal load in the occupant was a major human factors parameter used to judge the energy absorbing (load limiting) performance of the seat. Analysis of data from the early dynamic tests of the crew seat showed little correlation between peak deceleration levels (Gs) measured in the dummy's pelvis and peak load (pounds/kN) measured in the same location. Occupant dynamic response and motions affected the spinal loads. For this project, spinal load force rather than G levels were determined to be a better parameter for judging occupant injury. This view was strengthened by the Panel's criter- ia which included a compressive spinal load limit of 1500 lbs. (6.67kN) . The magnitude of the loads in the restraint system webbing was another design parameter. These loads can result in: failure of the webbing or webbing attachments, injury of the occupant, or excessive reaction loads in the seat or sup- porting aircraft structure. The Safety Panel's criteria limiting the load in a single strap shoulder harness to 1750 lbs. (7.78kN), with a maximum total load of 2000 lbs. (8.901kN) for a dual strap shoulder harness assembly, was used for this project.

All of these tests used a 50th percentile, 170 lb. (0.76kN) dummy meeting the previously described requirements of 49 CFR 572, Subpart B, as the anthropomorphic testing device (ATD). TEST SET 1 - The seat design employed as the test specimen for the first set of tests, A83 012 through A83 015, was a curved tubular seat pedestal fabricated with 4130 steel as shown in Figure 2. The restraint system was a simu- lated five-point system with the shoulder harness attached to rigid simulated aircraft structure. The seat belts were attached to the seat pedestal. No inertia reel was used and the webbing fabric was nylon. The acceptance cri- teria for these tests were to be based on pelvic Fig. 2 - Post-test view of test A83 015 showing submarining effects and tubular seat design Vertical G levels, (Z G) , forward motion, sub- marining, restraint system loads in excess of current static design limits, and structural continuity. Post- test examination of the seats and the ATD indicated that as the test G level was in- creased the submarining increased. The submar- ining can be seen as an inflection in the seat belt lap force trace as shown in Figure 3. Also, when the legs of the ATD go toward a raised knee position, as shown in Figure 2, submarining is indicated. Fig. 3 - Lap force plot showing the inflection that indicates submarining 4.455</page><page sequence="5">A review of the data for these tests indi- cate the design was acceptable for the -8.8 G level. However, at the -15.8 G level, the pelvic G levels were approaching allowable limits and the shoulder harness loads were greater than 1500 lbs. (6.67kN). Also submarining was becom- ing more noticeable in the post examination of the ATD. Test beyond the -15.8 G level indicated pelvis G levels that were in excess of the values suggested by the Eiband curves, shoulder harness loads were high, and submarining effects pre- valent. For all of these tests, the head motion in the forward direction and the lap belt loads were low. A tabulation of this data is shown in Table 2. Based on the test data and a visual examin- ation of the seat structure after these tests, the following design changes were undertaken: a) Fabrication of the shoulder harness with a rip stitch to reduce harness loads and eliminate or reduce submarining; b) Modification of the seat cushion frame to use a sheet metal pan instead of a fabric cushion support ; c) Creation of a new seat pedestal design consisting of a four-bar linkage that pro- vided controlled seat collapsing using the deformation of an aluminum pull bar.

All of these specimens again used a simulated five-point restraint system with a dual shoulder harness on a single inertia reel. This reel was attached to rigid simulated aircraft cabin top structure and the lap belts were attached to the seat pedestal. Tests A83 020 through A83 023 used a four- bar linkage seat design with a pull bar mounted diagonally between the upper forward and lower rear pivot points as shown in Figure 4. Tests A83 024 and A83 025 used the same tubular seat design as in test set 1. Also, tests A83 023 and A83 024 used a rip-out stitching in the shoulder harness to eliminate submarining and aluminum seat pans instead of neoprene covered nylon fabric seat pans to reduce pelvic G levels and lumbar Z force in the upward direction. The data for this set of tests are shown in Table 3. An analysis of these data and photo- graphs of the ATD after the test indicated the following: a)There did not seem to be good correlation 4.456</page><page sequence="6">850856 Table 3.

If the pull bar activated at G levels which were too low, the pull bar would fully stroke before all energy was attenuated. This could result in pull bar failure or seat bottoming against hard structure; e) The four-bar linkage seat design allowed more forward motion of the head and less submarining than did the tubular seat design. TEST SET 3 - As the four-bar linkage showed less tendency to induce submarining, it was de- cided to further develop this seat design to re- duce the head motion and pelvic loads by improv- ing the load stroke characteristics of the pull bar. These changes were accomplished and used as speciments for tests A83 044 through A83 048. The test data for test set 3 are shown in Table 4. New test input parameter values were used for these tests. These changes consisted of new seat pitch and yaw angles. In Test 044 and 045, tearout of the shoulder harness rip stitch did not occur; and, the pull bar did not stroke in test 044 and stroked only .75 inch (1.9 cm) in test 045. Part of the test fixture failed in test 047; therefore, the re- sults are not valid. It was determined from these tests that: Table 4.

TEST SET 4 - Tests A83 072 through A83 074 were the first tests using the four-bar linkage seat with a C shaped tube mounted as the forward linkage (leg) . This C tube replaced the pull bar as an energy absorber to aid in reducing forward motion. Also at this time, the re- straint system was changed to all polyester webbing except for the shoulder harness in Test 074. The higher stiffness of the polyester webbing, compared to nylon webbing, provided more predicatable control of the ATD motion. At the time of test set 4, the lumbar Z load and shoulder harness load limits had been proposed by the Safety Panel as ^1500 and 1750 lbs. (6.67 and 7.78kN) respectively. These limits became a part of the criteria for this set of tests. The restraint system was a stan- dard purchased five-point system with the nega- tive-G strap attached to the forward edge of the seat. The inertia reel was attached to the simulated cabin top structure as in previous tests. This seat design is shown in Figure 5. This set of tests, 072-074, was plagued by restraint system failures which consisted of the negative-G strap disengaging allowing the ATD to submarine. This was caused by mounting the nega- tive-G strap to the forward end of the seat cushion frame which moved when the seat stroked, Fig. 5 - Modified four-bar linkage seat design while mounting the shoulder harness attachment to rigid aircraft structure. No means of restraint system extension, such as a tear-out section was provided. The data for these tests is shown in Table 5. Based on these tests, the restraint system was redesigned to be a four-point system with the inertia reel mounted along the centerline of the seatback. The shoulder straps were routed from the inertia reel to the seat belt attachment at the rear of the seat. In theory, this change would reduce submarining effects because the shoulder harness would not pull the lap belt up as the restraint system was loaded. TEST SET 5 - The new four-point all polyes- ter restraint system was incorporated into the design and tests were scheduled to use a proposed seat pitch angle of 60° as well as the 30° pitch. Table 5.

The data from test set 5, identified as A83 088 and A83 089, are shown in Table 6. The seat/ restraint system configuration used for these tests is shown in Figure 6. Due to the restraint system geometry changes made to reduce sub- marining and the seat yaw condition imposed on the test, only one load cell on the left lap belt was used. As a result of the left-hand seat yaw (counter-clockwise in the plan view) , the ATD produced a right-hand lateral load on the lap belt. This lateral load, as well as friction between the ATD and the belt, would have produced error in the data of a load cell attached to the right lap belt.

If the sled G levels obtained during these tests were to be the final selected test criteria, a seat belt static design load of 1500 lbs. (6.67kN) was not going to be adequate. Because of the structural failure of the left rear seat locking pin housing, the seat was redesigned by moving the pin location aft. Also during this redesign period, the Panel's pro- posal became more definite. The dynamic testing was established as two tests as defined in Table 1, except the seat track deformation for the 60° seat pitch case was not included. TEST SET 6 - Test set 6 consists of test A84 038, A84 041, and A84 042 as shown in Table 7. During Test A84 038, the stitching attach- ing the shoulder harness to the lap belt at the seat attachment failed and, to improve the attachment of the restraint system, the stitching was doubled. This new stitching was incorporated in the design used for Tests 041 and 042. 4.459</page><page sequence="9">Table 7.

Even though the right shoulder harness total loads were not measured, it was felt that the sum was less than the 2000 lbs. (8.90kN) allowed for a dual shoulder harness. During test 042, the seat back adjust screw bottomed against the front cross tube. The C tubes and seat cushion pans deformed satisfactorily. The upper torso restraint loads peaked at less than 534 lbs. (2.37kN) per belt and the occupant's left lap belt peaked at 57 lbs. (.26kN). The peak acceleration measured at the pelvis in the Z-axis was 27.3 Gs and the peak pelvic load in the Z-axis was 1615 lbs. (7.18kN). The dummy's loads fell within the proposed test limits after reducing the pelvic Loads for the G level overshoot, i.e. 19.3 divided by 20.9 times 1615 (7.18kN) equals 1491 lbs. (6.63kN). Appendices A and B contain traces of the time histories for the more important parameters measured during tests 041 and 042 respectively. Detailed analyses of dynamic test results often require a review of these time histories. Such reviews are important for determining the exact sequences of events following initiation of impact . The results of tests 041 and 042, show that the proposed test criteria have been satis- factorily met. The seat design used in test set 6 is shown in Figure 7. The picture shows the seat in the pre-test condition on the left and the post-test condition for test 042 on the right. Figure 8 shows the seat mounted on the sled prior to test 041, and Figure 9 shows the test assembly prior to test 042.

The seat/restraint system evaluated in test set 6 met the requirements of the Panel criteria as proposed in February 1984. Limiting occupant forward motion was determined to be a critical element of seat design for small airplanes. A systems approach was taken in the design of the Caravan 1 crew seat to assure compatibility of the components and improve predictability of the assembly performance under dynamic loading. Several recommendations came from this project which relate to test procedures as well as the seat/restraint system design. These are summarized as follows : 1. When conducting dynamic tests, allowance should be made for linear extrapolation of parameter values to account for sled acceleration overshoot, provided the amount of overshoot is less than 10% of the minimum required peak acceleration. 2. Attachment loads should be monitored during dynamic tests and these loads should be used to formulate ultimate load criteria for the attach- ment hardware. This is particularly important when the peak loads resulting from dynamic test- ing are higher than those resulting from current static load requirements. 3. Even though it is not included in the Panel recommendations, some system static tests should be conducted prior to dynamic test- ing. The static tests will help verify strength and stiffness values for critical elements • 4. One of the true benefits of better seat designs in general aviation is the result- ing decrease in injuries and fatalities during accidents. REFERENCES 1.

The figures in this appen- dix show time histories obtained from test A84 041. For this test, the seat was yawed 10° relative to the impact vector with no pitch. The floor on one side of the seat was pitched to simulate floor warpage. An initial check for the validity of the test was made by analyzing the sled deceleration pulse in Figure A2. Peak deceleration, pulse duration, rise time, and pulse shape were im- portant variables affecting the test results. Figures A3 thru A6 show pelvic acceleration time histories which can be used with Eiband curves to evaluate the potential for injury. Figures A7 thru AIO show pelvic load time his- tories. The level of compressive pelvic load measured in the Z-axis, Figure A9, was compared to the criteria in the General Aviation Safety Panel recommendations . The results of many of the dynamic tests showed a poor correlation be- tween the peak levels of pelvic deceleration and pelvic loads. Figures All and A12 show restraint system belt loads measured during test A84 041. Place- ment of the load cell on the belt can be critical to valid measurements due to ATD-to-belt friction effects and belt flexibility effects. Belt loads were critical parameters to this test. Since most of the impact was in the longitudinal axis of the seat, the restraint system harness pro- vided most of the ATD restraint. Restraint system geometry was found to be an important factor in the effectiveness of the system. Figures A13 thru A15 show measurements of seat pan deflections. These data helped to de- fine the amount of energy absorbed by the seat pedestal during impact and the clearance re- quired for seat stroke. Figures A16 thru A31 provide time traces of the floor reaction loads. The plots were useful in determining possible loading condi- tions which would have to be carried by the seat rail and floor attachment structures. Significant vertical up loads were reacted at the rear leg attachments for test A84 041 while the front leg attachments experienced only down loads . CAMI SLED TEST A84041 100. 30. " ~ BO . 24.

The figures in this appen- dix show time histories obtained from test A84 042. For this test, the seat was pitched 60° to the impact vector with no yaw. The floor on one side of the seat was pitched to simulate floor warpage. An initial check for the validity of the test was made by analyzing the sled deceleration pulse in Figure B2. Peak deceleration, pulse duration, rise time, and pulse shape were impor- tant variables affecting the test results. Figures B3 thru B6 show pelvic acceleration time histories which can be used with Eiband curves to evaluate the potential for injury. Figures B7 thru BIO show pelvic load time his- tories. The level of compressive load measured in the Z-axis, Figure B9, was compared to the criteria in the General Aviation Safety Panel recommendations. The results of many of the dynamic tests done for this project showed a poor correlation between the peak levels of pelvic deceleration and pelvic loads. Figures Bll and B12 show restraint system belt loads measured during test A84 042. These loads were low compared to those of test A84 041 since most of the forces required to stop the dummy were reacted through the seat cushion.
