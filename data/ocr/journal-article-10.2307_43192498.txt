<plain_text><page sequence="1">46 Al-cArabiyya, 11 (1978) JEWS IN ARABIC LITERATURE 1830-1914* by MOHAMMED BAKIR ALWAN GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY Although the Jews played an important role in the economic, com- mercial and political life of the Arab world during the nineteenth and early part of the twentieth century, they appear to have had little influence on the cultural part of that life. The majority of Arab writers were almost oblivious to what was happening to the Jews in Europe or in the Middle East. In the scanty references to the Jews in Arabic literature, one can hardly think of any awareness of the impor- tance of Jews in the Arab daily life. They figure only tangentially in Arabic prose works and much less in Arabic poetry. Undoubtedly, this lack of great interest in the Jews by Arabs lies in the socio-economic components of Arab society. It is not the purpose of this paper to delve into those components, rather, its interest lies The following three papers were originally read at a Symposium on Arab-Jewish Cultural Symbiosis which was held at the University of Texas at Austin on March 3-4, 1975. It was the wish of Professor Najm Bezirgan and Professor Eisig Silberschlag who organized the Symposium to avoid political intrusion and to explore the Arab-Jewish problem in non-political contexts. The theme of the Symposium reflected that wish: it concentrated on the image of the Arab in Hebrew literature and the image of the Jew in Arabic literature in the last hundred years. The three essays treat symbiosis in three periods: (1) under Ottoman sovereignty, (2) between the two world wars, and (3) in contemporary times. Professor LeGassick gave me permission to slightly edit his essay . Najm Bezirgan</page><page sequence="2">Jews in Arabic Literature 1830-1914 47 in the literary representation of Jews and Judaism insofar as it promulgates a stereotype, whose image is recognized and understood by Arab society. Both fictional and non-fictional writings were consulted for this study in order to clarify this depiction of the Jews as pre- sented to the Arab reading public. Even so, writings on Jews are meager. The main difficulty lies in the fact that Arabic novelists and play- wrights, unlike their Western counterparts, did not consider the Jew as a character in their works. It must be said here that at this time Arabic novels and plays were at their earlier stage of development. Most of them were translations, adaptations or imitations of Western writings . It is indeed strange that the earliest work on the Jews is a long poem composed by Fāris ash-Shidyāq (1804-1887)-^ in the year 1248/1832. The poem is entitled Lamm al-Qurild ft Dhamm al-Yahūd (Gathering the Monkeys to Derogate the Jews), and, as far as I know, has never been published. It is contained in a unique autograph deposited at the library of the University of Cambridge, England, Or. 1446 (9). A.J. Arberry mentions this poem in an article on Shidyaq and describes it as "a blistering satire on the Jews in 264 couplets on the same rhyme." A blistering satire it is. But the number of couplets should be amended to 269. The poem is a tour de force , where all the dictionarial words ending in "n" are used to make up the rhymes of its verses. He employs the same meter, al-wāf ir , and almost the same rhyme as those of the Mucallaqah of cAmr Ibn Kulthūm, the pre-Islamic poet - a fact of some importance to our discussion as we shall see. Shidyaq appears to have enjoyed this arduous exercise in poetic composition. The infusion of a large dose of rare and obscure words necessitated the marginal glosses with which he provides the poem. His language-manipulation is quite evident here as it is evident in his other works, particularly as-Sāq calā as-Sāq (The Leg on the Leg) . This usage of Arabic combined with his inexhaustible vocabulary made the poem somewhat complicated and, in places, rather unintelligible and even nonsensical. The poem begins in a serious vein, satirizing the Jews for their anthropomorphic depiction of God, which was one of the charges leveled against the Jews by the early Muslims. But soon the poem deteriorates into mu j On (obscene buffoonery), with the exception of one section (pages 137b-138a) , where Shidyaq attacks the Torah for its inelôquent language. Later on, he unfavorably compares it to the Mucallaqah of cAmr Ibn Kulthūm. Shidyaq, of course, is referring to the Arabic version, but this is not to say that he would have refrained from attacking the Torah had he been able to read it in Hebrew. In the course of the poem, he makes fun of the Hebrew belief in fallible prophets, the synagogues and their paraphernalia, and the customs, garments and rituals of rabbis. In the meantime, he has sprinkled the poem with references to old ideas regarding the Jew as a treacherous and deceptive creature. He concludes</page><page sequence="3">48 Mohammed Bakir Alwan his satire with the contention that the Old Testament is nothing but legends and myths. Finally, he expresses his surprise to see his fellow Christians believing in these worthless tales. Characteristically, the poem ends in the following lines: Fa hasbuka mā dhakartu wa qis calayhi wa lā taku lil-cadāfihi dhā rughūni Zununun fï junūnin fî mujüni mujūnun fī junūnin fī zunīīni Suffice it what I said, you may draw other analogies but donft you give ear to slander. Myths in madness in buffoonery, buffoonery in madness in myths. Although the end of the poem exemplifies the entire work, it leaves one at a loss in his attempt to understand its purpose, since the ending is clearly liable to different interpretations. To uncover the purpose of the poem, it is useful to look into the personality and character of Shidyäq himself as well as certain facts about this poem. The poem was written in 1832 and Shidyaq died in 1887. Had he wished, he certainly had ample time to publish it, particularly if we realize that, during most of that period of fifty-five years, he was the manager of two Arabic presses, one in Malta, the other in Constan- tinople. Therefore, the poem must have been written for private con- sumption. He knew very well that the publication of such a poem would draw angry feelings from some pious members of the three revealed religions, though at the same time it would draw laughter from many. Again, if we look at Shidyâq1 s other works, we do not find anything even remotely resembling this poem. He does not appear to have harbored deep anti-Jewish feeling. But he seems to have been a skeptic and a rebel at least in his youth. Shidyâq was born into a well-known Lebanese Maronite family. When his older brother Ascad was imprisoned for converting to Protestantism, the younger Fãris Shidyaq declared himself a Protestant as an expression of revulsion to his brother's imprisonment and as a protest against the authoritarianism of the Maronite Patriarch. He was not happy, however, with his new religion. Before his final conversion to Islam, he heaped ridicule upon Protestant as well_as Catholic Churches in his as-S5q cal3 as-Saq , Paris, 1855. Shidyaq definitely believed in God, but he had many reservations about religious rituals. His skepticism drove him from one religion to another. With regard to the Bible, he wrote a number of works criticizing certain passages in it.^ And yet, Shidyâq, with the help of others, was the first to render the Bible into Arabic in modern times.</page><page sequence="4">Jews in Arabic Literature 1830-1914 49 Lamm al-Qurud was written in Cairo, and he must have read it to his Muslim teachers as well as to his friends from various religions. They must have chuckled over its verses. Shidyaq^ use of sexual allusions and even obscenity as sources of humor is all too clear in his works and especially in his as-Sāq calā as-Sāq . It is not surprising that he would write a "blistering satire on the Jews." But, why the Jews? Why not another people, another sect, another group? The answer to that question lies in the chauvinistic elements in the Arab society of his day. Certain ideas about the Jews had already ossified into solid beliefs. The depiction of the Jew as a sneaky, deceptive and callous profiteer was quite common. Shidyaq himself in his long poem compares the weakness of the Jews of his day with their former power and glory, and blames their degeneracy for what befell them. Shidyaq was clearly voicing certain ideas and sentiments about the Jews which where common among the Arabs. As Shidyãq developed into a prominent writer and journalist, he assumed certain political ideas which were not popular among the intel- lectuals of the second half of the nineteenth century. Essentially, he was partially pro-Ottoman and partially pro-British, and at the same time, anti-nationalist. This latter belief of his was necessitated by his advocacy of the return to the Muslim caliphate under Ottoman rule. When Shidyaq persisted in his support of Ismācīl, the Khedive of Egypt, and his son Tawfîq, the Jewish Egyptian nationalist Jacob §annūc (1839-1912) felt that it was his duty to oppose Shidyaq* s ideas publicly. In 1880, he wrote in his periodical Abu Saffārah a scathing satire on Shidyaq, with some measure of obscenity. &amp; Jacob Sannū0, of course, was well-known for the use of allusions to sex as well as to certain func- tions of the human body as devices in his satire against his opponents. Most likely, Sannū0 did not know about Shidyaq1 s poem Lamm al-Qurud, nor was Sannū01 s satire prompted by any antagonistic religious feelings. He, obviously, did not find any contradiction between his religion as a practicing Jew and his nationalism as an Egyptian. ^ Consequently, he devoted his entire life to the independence and progress of Egypt as shown in his numerous publications. c In the annals of modern Arabic literature, Sannū holds a prominent position. The creation of the Egyptian theater is attributed to him. His plays were repeatedly performed in Egypt. A collection of these plays has recently appeared in print. As a political agitator and a social thinker, he used drama as a means to fight oppression, ignorance, prejudice and other social and political ills with the most skillful biting satire for which he has become known as the Molière of Egypt. 9 It is true, as Jacob Landau has remarked, that his publications, whether they are poems, plays or essays, have very little Jewish content in them, but his role in Arab-Jewish symbiosis as well as in the image- making process should not be underestimated. The fact that such Muslim</page><page sequence="5">50 Mohammed Bakir Alwan thinkers as Jamal ad-Din al-Afghãni (1838-1897), Muhammad cAbduh (1849-1905) , Mahmûd Sāmī al-Bārūdl (1839-1904) , Ibrāhīm al-Muwaylihï (1839-1906) and others held him and his works in great esteem is quite significant. Also significant is the vast amount of subsequent research carried out by Arab writers on the life, accomplishments and beliefs of Sannüc.lß The recent attempt by an Egyptian writer to make Jacob Sannuc a Muslim can only be termed ludicrous . But the underlying assumption that a Jew cannot be a Jew and at the same time a contributor to the social and political progress of the country in which he lives is rather disturbing. Nevertheless, as Irene Gendzier wrote: The emergence of a Jew as a prominent figure in present-day Egypt would doubtless arouse interest and even suspicion. But this assumption is based on the experience of Jews in the Arab East since 1948. Before the creation of a Palestine question and the establishment of the State of Israel, the position of Jews in the Middle East was not generally regarded with fear by Jews themselves, or with hostility by Muslims. Sannöc was not the only Jewish contributor to Arabic literature in this period. Without going into detail, the contribution of Jews to Arabic literature ought to be sketched briefly in order to facilitate an understanding of their role in the intellectual life of Arab society. One can mention Shamcūn Moyâl,^ Esther Azharï Moyil,^ Faraj Murād ^ and others. The role played by Esther Moyâl as a social reformer and translator is particularly important. Aside from editing a fortnightly periodical entitled al-cA* ilah (The Family) (1899-1904) , ^ she translat- ed a number of French novels, especially the novels of Emile Zola (1840-1902), into Arabic. It is due to her that the Arab reader had his first glimpse of J 1 Accuse and the details of the Dreyfus affair.-^ In the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the Jewish schools of Beirut, Alexandria and Cairo were quite active in developing Arabic drama. The majority of plays performed on their stages were based on Jewish history. Biblical personalities were quite popular among Jewish, Christian and Muslim playwrights. They provided them with numerous dramatic themes. The most frequently encountered personalities in these plays are Joseph, ^ David, ^ Samson, ^ and Esther. ^ Beside these personalities, one also encounters dramatizations of the famous story of as-Samaw'al, the eloquent Jewish poet of pre-Islamic Arabia, who chose to see his own son killed rather than surrender Imru? al-Qays1 coats of mail, and thus betray the trust committed to him. Although the role of the Christians in the modern Arab renaissance has been relatively well-studied, the role of the Jews in that renaissance remains somewhat obscure. It is true that the Jews did not play as important a role as that of the Christians; nevertheless, recent studies have shown that they too were quite receptive to Western ideas, and, in turn, contributed to the modernization and development of the</page><page sequence="6">Jews in Arabic Literature 1830-1914 51 Middle East. 25 The quantity and quality of their contribution certainly warrants further research. As the Jews were beginning to acquire more and more importance in the Arab society toward the end of the nineteenth century, particularly with the rise of sizeable Jewish communities in the metropolitan areas, new factors came into play. Attacks on Jews began to appear publicly in the form of articles and books. One of the earliest anti-Jewish publications is a book published anonymously in Beirut entitled a^- - c T ^ - c - S ah If ah al-Wadiyyah al-Lamma - iyyah f T i Inhidam ^ ad-Diyanah al- Ibraniyyah - (The Clear and Glittering Scroll on the Collapse of Hebrew Religion) (ca. 1870). When news of the publication of this tract reached the Governor of Syria, he immediately ordered the confiscation of the remaining copies. The Arabic periodical al- Jinan published a refutation of the tract. From this refutation, it can be seen that the main charge of the book against the Jews is their supposed use of Christian blood for the purpose of baking unleavened bread, a charge that was system- atically popularized in Europe. ^ Most likely the tract was translated from one of the European languages, possibly from the French, for this accusation has no significant roots in Arabic or Islamic literature. * In 1890, another work with similar charges appeared in Cairo. It was written by Habib Fāris under the title Surākh al-Barî1 fl Bug al- Hurriyyah (The innocent Blows the Trumpet of Freedom) The work is clearly a partial translation from the French. 29 Three years later a translation of George Corneilhan1 s Juifs et opportunistes: le Judaisme en Egypte et en Syrie (Paris, 1889), appeared under the title Fi az-Zawãyâ Khabäyä aw Kashf Asrãr al-Yahūd (Secrets in the Corners or 30 Exposing the Secrets of the Jews) . Corneilhan went beyond the usual charges of slaughtering human beings to use their blood in matzot (unleavened bread) found in such literature, into a blind attack against everything Jewish. His carricature depicts the Jews as people without honor, without loyalty, without propriety, and without decency. Like- wise, responsibility for the ills of the world is appropriately placed on the Jews; wherever the Jews settle, he tells us, with them settles evil. Corneilhan 's solution to the "Jewish Problem" is very simple - exile all Jews from France. The translator would add, I imagine, and from Egypt. Needless to say Corneilhan1 s contentions did not go unchallenged. Immediately after the publication of his book, a work entitled Sihlm al-Manãyâ fi ar-Radd Calā Kitāb fi az-Zawāyā Khabäyä (Deadly Arrows to Refute the Book Secrets in the Corners) was published anonymously. Furthermore, the greatest Arab journalists and intellectuals of the day from Salim al-Bustini (1848-1884) to Yacqūb Sarrūf (1852-1927), Fāris Nimr (1856-1951) and others maintained that the attacks on Jews, within</page><page sequence="7">52 Mohammed Bakir Al wan 33 or outside the Arab World, were vicious and unjust. Beside these writers, Shihïn Makkaryus (1853-1910) wrote an important work entitled Ta'rîkh al-IsrS1 îliyyîn (History of the Isrealites) (Cairo, 1904), not so much as a defense of the Jews, but rather as a balanced review of their history. A good portion of this book is devoted to the biographies and contributions of some notable Jews of the Middle East.^4 It is difficult to assess the effect of all this anti-Jewish liter- ature on the Arab mind, but it did not, in any case, help to alleviate traditional prejudices. On the contrary, new chauvinistic elements were added, including such horrible accusations as murder and prostitu- tion. This, no doubt, provided justification to bigoted and demented elements in the society to look for killers at every corner. In doing so, they helped to provoke mass-hysteria and riots. As it has been remarked earlier, numerous novels were translated into Arabic. One such novel with significant Jewish content is The Wandering Jew by Eugene Sue (1804-1857) , ^6 which seems to have been well-received in many quarters. 37 More important than The Wandering Jew in shaping Arab public opinion regarding the Jews are the few novels written by Arabs for an Arab audience at the turn of the century. The earliest one is entitled al-cAj Ibah aw Fatāt Isri* Il (The Wonderful Jewess or the Young Woman of Israel)^ published in 1903.^9 i have not been able to consult this novel, and not much is known about it, but it is probably an historical novel, since this is the only fictional genre which al-Antiki had tried. Most likely, the Jews were shown therein in a fair and balanced way, since al-Antakl had shown elsewhere cordiality to them.40 - c The second novel is entitled Urûshalîm al-Jadîdah aw Fath al- Arab Bayt al-Maqdis (The New Jerusalem or The Arab Conquest of Jerusalem) by Farah Antūn (1874-1922) published in Alexandria in 1904. The focal point of the novel is the love between Iliya, a Christian ascetic, and Esther, a young Jewish woman from Egypt during the four-month siege of Jerusalem by the Muslims when they first began their drive northwards. Despite its many technical shortcomings,4 the novel manages to recall the religious antagonism and bigotry of those days rather well. Esther was almost lynched when the populace discovered her in Bethlehem and found her to be of a different religion. She is saved by Iliya, who himself almost looses his life in the process. The purpose of this widely read novel is quite clear. As the events move on, each one of the two main characters become more and more tolerant of the religion of the other, but they continued to be tormented throughout the novel by a sharp conflict between love and religion. At every stage the reader is made aware of the overwhelming sense of loyalty to age-old prejudices. Towards the end of the novel, a feeling of brotherhood, almost a spiritual feeling, overtakes all the antagonists. Jerusalem is surrendered to the Muslims in anticipation of a period of tolerance and</page><page sequence="8">Jews in Arabic Literature 1830-1914 53 peace. But this, clearly, did not wipe out fanaticism and bigotry for good. Since Esther and Iliyâ are true to their respective religions, marriage must be ruled out, taking into consideration the time in which they lived. The author is left with one alternative, an eternal sepa- ration. Finding them in this insoluble human dilemma, Antūn, wisely, makes each character fall sick and, then, die. In a notebook which Esther leaves behind, she promises her beloved that she will meet him in Heaven where there is no difference between Christians, Jews and pagans . ^2 Far from being a Heaven, in capital or small "h", the Arab World, like the rest of the world, experienced periods of greater and lesser chauvinisms. These experiences are recorded and preserved in its literature. In the early part of the nineteenth century, Arab society was largely traditional, where ahi adh-dhimmah (tolerated minorities) are treated in the same fashion as they were treated for centuries. In this complex society, the Jews seem to have managed to live in relative peace as a tolerated minority under the domination of the Muslim major- ity. Sometimes, of course, they were victims of religious and social intolerance and hatred. Tirades such as that of Shidyâq, one imagines, were not infrequent. The literature of this period does not yield a complete picture of the Jews in the Muslim environment. The majority of Jews must have been on the lower social strata. Yet, one finds examples of literary and cultural contributions by Jews to Arab society. As the nineteenth century drew to a close, the cry for greater tolerance of Jews was louder. But, at the same time, the Arab World received a dose of age-old European prejudices. As education and modern^ ization spread in Arab society, awareness of the problems of bigotry and hatred become sharper, as we saw in the novel of Farah Antūn. Aside from the few outright tirades against the Jews, which are essentially Euro- pean in scope and technique, no major Arab writer in the nineteenth century or early part of the twentieth century willfully vilified the Jews. The few writers who considered the Jews in their writings and the periodicals which referred to them presented them in a rather admi- rable and wholesome image. In conclusion, it must be admitted that nineteenth-century Arabic literature presents a fractured view of the Jews. Nevertheless, the relation between Arabs and Jews in this period appears to be less complicated than it is today and certainly less bloody.</page><page sequence="9">54 Mohammed Bakir Alwan FOOTNOTES 1.
