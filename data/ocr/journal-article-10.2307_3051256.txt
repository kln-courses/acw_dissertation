<plain_text><page sequence="1">Creating Dzsastres: Andrieu's Photographs of Urban Ruins in the Paris of 1871 Alisa Luxenberg War has its conventions; so, too, does war imagery. The photographs made by a dozen or so French photographers during and, mostly, after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 and the Paris Commune of 1871 focus on the architectural ruins in Paris left in the wake of these conflicts. These images, many of which lack human figures or any sign of life, appear today as compelling representations-of destruction and loss, but whose loss? To whom did such pictures appeal? Galvanized by the centenary of the Commune in 1971, recent scholarship has proposed political and class-based readings of the photographs, to the neglect of their material appearances and practices as well as other interpretations.1 Historians of art, photography, and culture concerned above all with determining the political positions of the photogra- phers have divided them into pro- and anti-Commune camps, suppressing the ever-present ambiguity of photographs to deliver a consistent message2 and even contradicting their own scholarly arguments.3 Historians have also tended to privilege what they consider to be pro-Commune photo- graphs and photographers, linking them to the proletariat.4 The so-called pro-Commune photographs constitute only a small proportion of contemporaneous Commune-related im- agery, and these had indeed suffered in the earlier ideologi- cally driven (that is, anti-Commune) illustrated histories of the political moment.5 Such scholarly efforts to recuperate these images have provided a fuller view of Commune representation, if not greater sensitivity to their broader meanings outside the specific politics of this radical move- ment. The photographs entitled Desastres de la guerre byJ. Andrieu6 are silver prints on albumenized paper measuring approxi- mately 29 by 38 cm, most probably made from wet collodion glass negatives, the technology overwhelmingly preferred at the time. To date, forty-seven separate "disasters" have been identified by their identical presentation and their shared dimensions and subjects of Parisian architectural ruins of 1870 and 1871 (Figs. 1, 2). All these photographic prints are mounted on much larger blue-gray cardboard with a red embossed stamp, centered underneath the print, bearing the series title, Desastres de la guerre, individual titles, and photogra- pher's name.7 On October 30, 1871, Andrieu registered twenty-one prints (Fig. 2) with the D6p6t Legal, the govern- ment bureau regulating commercial prints, under a series title, Desastres de la guerre, along with individual titles, and he numbered them by hand between one and forty-four, skip- ping numbers.8 A photographic album now in the Canadian Centre for Architecture, La Guerre et la Commune, includes twenty-one of Andrieu's Desastres mixed in with other pictures and offers a rare example of the manner in which such Commune photographs were sold and collected in the later nineteenth century.9 A scholarly silence surrounds Andrieu's series, which is not surprising, for it lacks ostensibly pro-Commune subjects or an explicitly anti-Commune text, and so has not appealed to scholars concerned with political "facts" following political acts. While a few individual prints have been published, these large, finely crafted prints with striking compositions and bold viewpoints have not been studied as a group, and all the principal questions concerning a coherent photographic project, therefore, remain open to serious examination.10 What constituted the group? What does it look like? Was it a series? Was it published? Who were its viewers, and what might it have meant to them? How does it relate to contemporary events? To balance the politically focused studies of Com- mune photography, the following comments provide a close reading of the Desastres as material objects in conjunction with an exploration of their broader visual and cultural context. The Paris Commune and Urban Identities The Paris Commune proclaimed itself on March 28, 1871, and lasted two months."1 It followed France's sound defeat in the Franco-Prussian War (declared by France on July 19, 1870) and the Prussians' crippling siege of Paris (August- December, 1870), which cut off the capital from the rest of the country. The capture of the French emperor Napoleon III completed his political downfall, and a Government of National Defense was created on September 4, 1870. Some months later, on January 28, 1871, the GND agreed to an armistice of humiliating terms, including substantial land concessions, a huge war indemnity, and a Prussian victory march down the Champs-Elysees. In Paris, city officials and their constituents expressed outrage over the GND's cessation of hostilities and acquies- cence to the Prussian terms for peace. After months of serious-for some, fatal-deprivation during the siege, many Parisians saw their sacrifices and suffering mocked in the GND's surrender to Prussia. Thus, when the GND called for elections on March 28, 1871, impelled by the Prussians' insistence that the war treaty be ratified by a duly elected French government, the city of Paris responded by forming its own government, the Commune, a term with strong associa- tions to French republicanism of 1792. The Commune began life with two enemies within striking distance of the city, the Prussian army and the government army stationed at Versailles. Ultimately, the leader of the GND, Adolphe Thiers, resorted to armed force to regain control of the city, and the government army (called the Versaillais) marched on Paris on May 21 and engaged in civil combat for a week known as the semaine sanglante, Bloody Week. As they retreated from the western and southern sections of the city, the F&amp;d~r~s (pro-Commune members of the national guard who refused to obey the GND's demand to</page><page sequence="2">114 ART BULLETIN MARCH 1998 VOLUME LXXX NUMBER 1 r -- ';riUWr `~tA 4'2l ab.. _'7 Aw- i Ak-u 3 3k ? 1 J.

Paris, Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux-Arts lay down their arms) and other Communards set fire to a dozen or so government buildings. In the days following, the government army rounded up and summarily executed thousands of accused Communards; judgments, exile, and executions continued into the summer. Most historians today agree that deaths at government hands numbered no fewer than twenty thousand men and women, and deaths by the Commune totaled somewhere around one hundred men. Prosecution of Commune crimes tapered off over the following two years, and amnesty was finally granted by the Third Republic in 1880. However, the wounds inflicted by the Franco-Prussian and Commune conflicts on French psyches and attitudes remained a powerful, if latent, factor not only in politics but also in cultural activities such as art production, criticism, and exhibitions.12 The potential stakes in rereading any texts or images related to the Commune are high, for the actions and issues involved were controversial, explosive, and ultimately bloody, and the history and motivations for them are still being contested and constructed today. Karl Marx and historians following him considered the Commune the first true mass uprising and government by and for the workers, while conservative historians treated it as a vicious, spontaneous attack by a degenerate proletariat against the bourgeoisie and moral order. Both sides place the Commune as the first step (positive or negative, accordingly) toward twentieth-century proletariat or Communist revolutions. Roger V. Gould has suggested a different interpretation of the Paris Commune as the revolt of urban residents against the French state.13 Through sensitive readings of documents concerning city life in 1870-71, Gould found that a mixture of working- and middle-class residents in most neighborhoods of Paris interacted on a daily basis and together attended neighborhood meetings during the siege. Without denying the various social groups with which individual Parisians associated themselves, Gould argued that these urban dwell- ers identified with each other through issues concerning the city, what he called "participation identity." Seeing their better-off neighbors also reduced to eating rats and suffering other privations instilled in many Parisians a sense of solidar- ity against the Prussians making the siege as well as the French government that later betrayed them in order to win the provincial vote.14 Gould argues convincingly that a shared identity was created among many Parisians based on their</page><page sequence="3">CREATING DEISASTRES: ANDRIEU'S PHOTOGRAPHS OF URBAN RUINS IN THE PARIS OF 1871 115 neighborhood ties and their experiences of the siege rather than their socioeconomic status. A literary critic and political conservative of the time, Francisque Sarcey lamented that his greatest losses were not financial but personal and tied to place: "A monetary wound isn't mortal! But so many memo- ries, stolen, obliterated! Oh, let's not speak any more of all this! I feel I'm dying."15 The urban fabric in which these residents had come together during the siege was torn apart in May, but images of the destruction could speak to the remembered experiences of a range of viewers: working-class, middle-class, property owners, and absentee residents. Professional and Political Context for Post-Commune Photographs In the months following the May events, the city slowly got back on its feet. Most of the Parisians (generally, the better- off) who had left during the siege returned to their homes, provided they were still standing.16 French and foreign tourists flocked to see the ruined city, whose burned-out buildings were reportedly still smoking months after the last armed confrontations. Residents and visitors purchased printed images to memorialize, reinforce, even substitute for their experiences of the events or of the city in ruins. Like the numerous guidebooks describing the "new" postwar Paris,17 photographs served as both historian and souvenir, fact and memory. A flood of photographs and other prints depicting the conflicts of 1870-71 flowed into the French public arena during and especially after these events. A number of estab- lished photographers of various specializations, among them Andre-Adolphe-Eugene Disderi, FranCois-Marie-Alexandre Gobinet Franck de Villecholle (known as Franck), Pierre Petit, Alphonse Liebert, Hippolyte Collard, Bruno Braque- hais, and Gaudenzio Marconi as well as Andrieu entered into the competitive fray of making and selling views concerning the Franco-Prussian War and the Commune. By mid-June, photographs of the ruins were on display in Parisian shops, selling to residents and tourists.18 At the same time, engrav- il?' .~3 -;:" IN. ;;W 4il- 14X1 df 'r ;,. totO E" itT L. 0' A-- ~,a~u Si r-: i~re.7 PBR11 y 2 Andrieu, Disastres de la guerre: L'Arsenal, Grenier d'Abondance: Intfrieure, 1871.

In order to control the content and circulation of these images, the local and national authorities had at their disposal a law of 1852 that required all commercial prints to be submitted to the Dep6t LUgal for authorization of their sale or distribution. Only subject mattered, not composition, quality, or presentation. In his study of the political uses of photogra- phy at this time, Donald English discusses the more specific decree enacted on December 28, 1871, that forbade images "that disturb the public peace," including portraits of Com- munards and pictures representing the civil war.19 This censorship pertained to the aggressive national policy of pursuing and prosecuting Communards and their suspected accomplices, as well as its overarching goal of maintaining order. Photographs censored by the government were not neces- sarily favorable to the Commune or made for their sympathiz- ers. The photographer Eugene Appert reworked photo- graphic portraits of Communards-often using prints made by other photographers for an entirely different presenta- tion-into photomontages that represented these figures in the most negative light. Appert's photographic works were banned under the 1871 decree. In fact, anti-Communards greatly desired photographic portraits of officials and accused members of the Commune, purportedly as a means of "understanding" the radicals but, in actuality, to confirm their preconceptions of the sitters' criminality and immoral- ity.20 Exploiting this demand, some photographers even misrepresented their sitters, as did the one arrested for selling a portrait of his mother-in-law as a Communard.21 The "disturbing" outbursts feared by authorities must have been primarily anti-Communard, because no Commune sympathiz- ers would have risked exposing their political stance at a time when criminal sentencing was often based on hearsay and suspicion. Similarly, no photographer would have risked submitting a clearly pro-Commune print to the Dep6t during the 1870s. These physical and political manipulations and management of such photographic imagery indicate the persistence of public and private anxieties concerning the "truth" of the recent conflicts, the still unresolved nature of the French government's authority, and the ongoing suppres- sion of the Commune. Photographs of the ruins were not implicated under the 1871 censorship law; evidently, they did not pose a threat to public order.22 All the commercial photographers, "pro"- and "anti"-Commune alike, dutifully registered prints concern- ing the war and the Commune at the D~p6t Legal as early as June 21 and as late as 1872.23 English describes as political favoritism the apparent permission given to two "pro- Commune" photographers, Appert and Petit, to sell unregis- tered photographs, but the fact that some of their work was suppressed by municipal officials contradicts this scholar's political explanation. Moreover, the case of Andrieu belies such political policy behind partial submission. Andrieu submitted fewer than half of his Disastres prints to the D~p6t Legal, but earlier in the 1860s, neither had he presented all of his touristic stereographs, which were decidedly unpolitical, to that licensing office.24 The application of the law to photographs of Commune subjects and their authors' partial submissions to the Dep6t had less to do with anti-Commune persecution than standard strategies of government control. Texts accompanying Commune photographs played an important role in their presentation and interpretation. Unanimously hostile or unsympathetic to the Commune as they had to be in order to pass the censors, these narratives largely determined the reading of the accompanying photo- graphs. Albums of photographs and texts were collaborative efforts between writers and photographers; no individual is known to have both written a text and made photographs. Only in the case of Liebert, whose own publishing establish- ment produced the album, does a photographer's collusion with the authorial voice in the accompanying text seem obvious.25 On the other hand, the lack of text in Braquehais's album has encouraged scholars to interpret his photographic images as pro-Commune and match them to his republican (though not necessarily Commune) sympathies. Andrieu's series did not have an accompanying essay. Themes of Urban Ruin At first glance the themes of the Disastres betray little deviation from the contemporaneous practice of illustrating the Com- mune ruins. All of the sites Andrieu depicted were among those most commonly treated injournalistic accounts, private descriptions, and later memoirs: some severely and barely damaged monuments (Colonne Vend6me, Arc de Triomphe, Porte St-Martin), many government buildings (the palaces of the Tuileries, St-Cloud, and Legion of Honor, the Ministry of Finances, the Tax Bureau), and functional structures (Arse- nal, Grenier d'Abondance).26 The inclusion of pictures of wreckage from the Franco-Prussian War as well as from the Versaillais-Communard struggle combined opposing sides, motives, and results under the common denominator of urban destruction. One might well ask, in light of Andrieu's title, Disasters of the War: Whose disasters, whose war, whose ruins? As Elaine Scarry has argued convincingly, the purpose of war is to injure and destroy, specifically human life and freedom of action.27 She rejects any other goal presented to justify the choice of military conflict by pointing out that it alone of all human competition or decision-making carries the authority of its own enforcement through the destruction of the human body and will. Because human life and freedom of action are, at almost all other moments, considered sacred, the recording of war is fraught with taboos. Even today, redescription, abstraction, oversight, and synecdoche are some of the tactics used to image and downplay the problem- atic goals of war. These conventions and viewers' expectations change over time, but imagery of the killing or maiming of humankind has been and remains particularly troubling.28 During the Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune of 1870-71, many of the pictorial conventions of representing war-neutral, eye-level viewpoints, subjects placed in the middle ground, legible formal and spatial illusion-were challenged and transformed by the special circumstances of these conflicts and the modern urban experience. The photography of war subjects in the nineteenth century</page><page sequence="5">CREATING DESASTRES: ANDRIEU'S PHOTOGRAPHS OF URBAN RUINS IN THE PARIS OF 1871 117 had another set of conventions in addition to that of war imagery in general. Recognizing that photography was techno- logically unable to record rapid movement with the degree of focus and recognizability of form required by pictorial conven- tions, audiences did not expect photographs of battle action and instead accepted portraits of political and military men and views of encampments, military structures, and destruc- tion of property.29 War dead-a still life-could be repre- sented photographically, and corpses of both armies were depicted to commercial profit during the American Civil War, where both sides seemed to agree that these deaths had noble meaning in defending a just cause in fair and honorable battles. But less than a decade later, few French photogra- phers made or sold prints representing the dead from the Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune.30 In fact, journalists warned that photographs of American Civil War dead were being sold in France as products of their own war.31 Avoiding the potent and uneasy charge inherent in represen- tations of bodily ruin, French photographers focused on architectural ruins in Paris after the Commune, using the technique of redescription, transferring and transforming the war "wounds" from bodies to buildings, skin to stone.32 Many of the French voices recorded in the 1870s explained the ruins as the Communards' bestial desire to annihilate what they could no longer control. Of course, the fact that these anti-Commune views were not only published but also dominated public discourse reflected their standing and power within the victors' camp, not the absence of other interpretations. Commune members or sympathizers who managed to publish their views later or in another country claimed that the fires were set as a military tactic to provide cover for the retreating Communards.33 An English sup- porter, Frederic Harrison, queried rhetorically, "If the Com- munists desired to destroy Paris, why did they not do it? And why is it that the richest quarter ... including the two Opera Houses, is practically uninjured?"34 A historian sympathetic to the Commune, Lissagaray, reminded readers of the irony that the same bourgeois patriots who persecuted the Commu- nards for the fires had earlier called for "burning everything" rather than allowing the Prussians to claim victory spoils.35 Both conservative and Marxist scholars have interpreted the ruins in Paris as anti-bourgeois acts of the Communards, the former as immoral, and therefore anti-middle-class destruc- tion, the latter as a principled attack on bourgeois capital, aimed at property, not persons.36 Following these class-based views, most photographic historians have read the photo- graphs of the ruins as bourgeois condemnations of the proletariat. But in considering the ruins and their photo- graphic representation, one must also bear in mind the ambiguous attitudes of numerous officials, soldiers, writers, and residents toward the conflicts and their consequences. As Georges Tersen determined, public opinion was mixed and highly emotional following the government's crushing and persecution of the Communards.37 One can imagine that for Parisians, the ruins did not solely signify "us" or "them," local or foreign, defeat or triumph, but always possibly both. The landscape of Paris had been complicated as the site of victory and loss, home and battlefield, and the destruction affected a wide audience as deep loss. As Francisque Sarcey wrote in 1871, "A profound melancholy seized us in looking at these places where we loved, where we suffered, where we endured life such as it is, mixed with the good and the bad. "38 Believed to be transparent reproductions of reality, photo- graphs of the ruins evoked, as did the ruins themselves, a similar mixture of good and bad memories among those of varied political and socioeconomic positions. Other undocumented observers-Communards, their sup- porters, and residents of affected neighborhoods-experi- enced these sites on a regular basis. The poor had also suffered in the military and incendiary actions as patrons, employees, or top-floor dwellers of the affected buildings and streets. Their tragedies were acknowledged by mainstream journalists and in some middle-class memoirs, indicating that Gould's "participation identity" existed, even if on an imper- sonal level.39 By omitting figures altogether from his large prints,40 Andrieu allowed collectors or viewers to visit and claim such disaster and destruction for their own. The equivocal attitudes of French officials and journalists toward the disasters emerged in the discourse surrounding the fate of two royal residences, the palaces of the Tuileries and of St-Cloud, which remained standing in their ruinous states until 1883 and 1891, respectively (Figs. 3, 4).41 Accord- ing to Kirk Varnedoe, the Tuileries ruins symbolized the radical republican threat of the Commune; they were pre- served by conservative republicans in power to divert public memory from the Versaillais' merciless repression of every- thing related to the Commune.42 Even the second-generation Romantic Theophile Gautier, whose career flourished during the reign of Napoleon III even as he paid lip service to republican ideals, proposed that St-Cloud be kept "like a Pompeii of destruction. One would come there to see what war is."43 These two ruins were not the only ones to be considered worthy of preservation,44 but all the others were restored to working order or replaced with different struc- tures. Why then were these two ruins alone left standing? I believe it was precisely because the Tuileries and St-Cloud palaces escaped the one-sided or fixed political readings presented by Varnedoe. The causes of ruination could not have been more dissimi- lar for the two buildings: St-Cloud was burned by the Prussians;45 the Tuileries was attacked by government troops and then burned by the Communards. Both palaces belonged to France's glorious past, which seemed increasingly distant to a nineteenth-century France competing with younger and hungrier nations. The palaces' historic importance alone called for preservation. This patrimony, however, had been tainted by its most recent occupants, for no other buildings were more closely linked to Napolkon III and Eugrnie, the villains of France's humiliating defeat by the Prussians; they had lived at the Tuileries and hosted elaborate parties at St-Cloud, long identified with royal pleasure and preroga- tive.46 And the Tuileries had witnessed a sorry string of earlier nineteenth-century dethronings: Napolkon I, Louis XVIII, and Louis-Philippe. GND and Commune officials were equally virulent in their contempt for the denounced Second Em- pire.47 Both Commune sympathizers and persecutors could see in these disastres a pseudo-biblical Gomorrah that signi- fied the punishment of the Second Empire's immorality and</page><page sequence="6">118 ART BULLETIN MARCH 1998 VOLUME LXXX NUMBER 1 RNT T'r --are, trt 1 1 Cie. 1-04 ITS -.- . l.l.p v';2g \ 3 Andrieu, Desastres de la guerre: Les Tuileries, facade principale, 1871, from La Guerre et la Commune (1871), pl. 11.

But the very slippage of liberal and reactionary readings of these wounded structures meant that they did not function as coherent public monuments. A strong aesthetic component figured prominently in the preservation of and fascination with the ruins. Journalists, poets, foreign visitors, and others remarked on the special beauty of many of the ruins, and several edifices were seen to have been "improved" aesthetically by the incendiary actions. As Gautier remarked in his Tableaux de siege, "With a feeling which will be reproached, but which any artist would forgive because he surely will also have experienced it, we were struck, above all, by the beauty of these ruins."48 As did art critics and amateurs, practical guidebook authors like Lu- dovic Hans and J. J. Blanc responded aesthetically to the ruins: "A marvel awaits us [in the rue de Rivoli].... The Ministry of Finances, which was never more than a mediocre monument, has become a superb ruin. Fire is a worker of genius. From this uniform, geometric, insolently regular mass, it has made a dynamic, decorative, interesting edi- fice."49 Aesthetic consideration of the ruins could supersede, at least momentarily, political partisanship. In 1871, the Englishman Sir William Erskine overlooked his anti-Com- mune stance to marvel ironically at the ruins of the H6tel de Ville, which he described as "lovingly caressed by a splendid setting: never have I imagined anything more beautiful: it's superb. The men of the Commune are frightful knaves, I don't disagree, but what artists! And they weren't conscious of their work, they didn't know what they were doing! That's even more admirable."50 What is surprising about this aes- thetic pleasure taken in the ruins is that the moral element that traditionally obtained in military conflicts and damage has fallen away. Beauty seems to have been evoked here as compensation for the sense of loss after the siege and civil war,51 perhaps even as a kind of balm to still violent political and personal emotions. Such aesthetic consideration may have veiled or compen- sated for the obvious macabre interest in the ruins and its commercial exploitation that jostled contemporary mores and taboos. Within a week or two of Bloody Week, Parisians would have encountered the tours of the ruins organized by the London travel agency of Thomas Cook.52 Pierre V6ron, the editor of Le Monde Illustre, charged photographers with unseemly opportunism, "the only ones ... to have benefited from the Commune." Yet his complaints were mixed with an anxious allusion to the ferocious repression of the Commune, "It's impossible to step out into a street without finding oneself in front of a lens .... These are the collodion gunners who aim their batteries at the rubble accumulated from the Communards' reign."53 Another Parisian observer compared the photographers to devils, agents of death.54 Nonetheless, photographs of the ruins enjoyed healthy sales, and many appeared in public exhibitions within the year in Versailles, Paris, London, Liverpool, and Cornhill. While those traveling on the Grand Tour of Europe tried to extract the "original" form and beauty from the disintegrating remains of a distant culture, many commentators on the ruins of 1870-71 were attracted to their new forms and the "creative" effects of destruction. These journalists and their audience had become accus- tl I- , I i di 5 Maxime Lalanne, Demolition pour le percement du boulevard Saint-Germain, etching, Paris, Bibl. Nat., Estampes 1863 tomed to the image and experience of a city in ruins from the spectacle of "destructions" during the 1850s and 1860s, when the prefect Baron Haussmann reorganized and modernized Paris. Sections of the city were being torn down and built up, and the detritus of some demolished structures remained for months or years before cleanup or new construction began. Even the official Revue Ginerale de l'Architecture et des Travaux Publics lamented that the courtyard in the rue Vivienne, "which had been blocked by the beginnings of construction since 1831 ... ended up looking like some ruins" and that property near the rue des Ecoles "had the air of a ruined city."55 Residents like Andrieu passed them daily, and were even affected by periodic renovations and modernization of the very buildings in which they lived and worked. Emile Zola later described the constant noise and dust of construction sites in anthropomorphic, bellicose terms.56 The ongoing renovations and their popular representation habituated residents and visitors to a city deconstructing and reconstruct- ing and prepared the public in many ways for a modern Paris in ruins. Photographers such as Henri Le Secq and Charles Marville nostalgically recorded parts of the urban fabric destined for destruction.57 Maxime Lalanne's etchings of the demolitions for new boulevards depict the deconstruction-construction in dramatic chiaroscuro and begin to exploit the graphic pattern- ing of forms, but in a still legible space (Fig. 5). The destruction and disorientation in Paris provoked an aesthetic fascination with the new ruins, as one sees in a word picture by Th6ophile Gautier from 1855: ... high walls, striped like a zebra with brown streaks created by the flues of toppled chimneys, reveal like the cross-section of an architectural plan the mystery of inti- mate quarters.... this disorder is not without beauty; the shadow and light interplay in picturesque effects on this debris, on these casualties of stones and beams fallen haphazardly.58 The aesthetic pleasure taken in Haussmann's ruins appears to have continued with the "new" ruins of 1871.

In such visual metaphors, Paris was represented as a work in progress, an attractive conflation of past and present in its continual remaking of itself via revolution, Haussmann, and art. The refashioning of Paris under Napoleon III and Hauss- mann did not always appear as positive progress, and ambiva- lent images of these modern urban ruins emerged in written and visual form. Not all Parisians benefited equally, or at all, from the massive transformation and upheavals of the public works. The destruction of older neighborhoods forced poorer residents out of the center, where the new, unified apartment buildings cost much more than they could afford, and into the outlying areas, including the newly incorporated com- munes of Belleville and Montmartre.59 Honore Daumier was one of the few to make direct allusion to the political motivations behind Haussmann's plans. In the lithograph Voile pourtant notre chambre nuptiale (Behold our nuptial chamber), published in Le Charivari on December 13, 1853, he succinctly suggested Napoleon III's city in disarray in the lightly sketched form of a fragmented, flattened, dysfunc- tional wall in front of bourgeois caricatures of the emperor and his new bride. The written and pictorial images of the destructions of 1870-71 offer shifting and ambivalent re- sponses to urban ruins similar to those evoked during Haussmann's tenure. The various ways in which this earlier urban destruction in Paris had been reconstructed into anthropomorphized representations of class, gender, and beauty may well have devolved to photographs like Andrieu's Disastres, despite their lack of human forms. In his caricatural engraving (Fig. 6), Edmont Morin imag- ined the Haussmannization of the city of Paris as something akin to rape. In formal terms, he created a voluminous, queenly figure, crowned by windmills a la Montmartre, to represent Lutetia, the ancient Roman city over which Paris was built.60 Trampling on her prone body, figures of male construction workers rush up her mountainous figure push- ing phallic wheelbarrows and carrying pickaxes. Cdlestin Nanteuil's lithograph of 1861 fashions the anthropomor- phized arms of the greedy (male, financial) forces behind the disturbing changes in urban Paris, evoked in the jumbled forms of recognizable monuments toppling toward an open void in the center.61 These popular prints rely on obvious and aggressive representations of gender and class confrontations to create their visual power.62 It is useful to consider these oppositional images in light of the class and gender narratives constructed in conservative histories, memoirs, and other publications on the Commune experience. In particular, the myth of the pitroleuses, working- class women sympathizers or members of the Commune said to have set fire to state buildings in Paris during Bloody Week, impressed itself on the imaginations of the Commune's persecutors.63</page><page sequence="9">CREATING DESASTRES: ANDRIEU'S PHOTOGRAPHS OF URBAN RUINS IN THE PARIS OF 1871 121 7 Andrieu, Disastres de la guerre: Colonne Vend6me abattue, 1871.

After October 1871, Andrieu did not register another photo- graph with the Dep6t Legal. Therefore, it remains unclear whether he made a series of forty-four prints, as indicated in the last number inscribed on his registered Disastres, or planned a larger one, suggested by the forty-fifth through forty-seventh views. The gaps in the numbering of Andrieu's deposited prints present tantalizing possibilities with regard to their sequence, but no overall pattern or visual logic emerges.65 Any chrono- logical sequence breaks down with the view of the Pont d'Argenteuil (Fig. 1), blown up during the Prussian siege in autumn 1870 but included among views of the buildings burned in Paris during Bloody Week of May 21-28, 1871. Similarly, no geographic order emerges in the dislocating jumps back and forth between sites in the city center (Col- onne Vend6me, Tuileries, H6tel de Ville), suburbs (Argen- teuil), Left Bank (rue de Lille), and Right Bank (Grenier d'Abondance, Arc de Triomphe). The mounted prints bear no numbers and perhaps moot any other possible function of the Dep6t numbering. In spite of the lack of text, which may have been more of a practical than political matter for Andrieu, certain position- ings of subjects within the twenty-one registered Disastres prints suggest that he was aware of the potential pictorial and narrative drama of serial photography. Print number one represents the toppled Colonne Vend6me (Fig. 7), which was also the first Parisian landmark to be destroyed by the Paris Commune in the agency of the Federation des Artistes, led by the activist painter Gustave Courbet. The last photograph (Fig. 8), numbered forty-four, is similarly powerful, represent- ing the Arc de Triomphe, looking in the direction of Versailles and seeming none the worse for the war. These framing views, the bold opening of the prone monument in pieces and the stable closure of the erect Arch of Triumph, whose very name implies victory, tempt us to read along an anti-Commune story line of stable national government triumphing over nefarious urban revolution. But to an audience, French or foreign, of 1871, these first and last images connoted multiple connections across time and space. Located in the heart of Paris, both monuments were original projects of Napoleon I as well as important sites in the recent civil war. The Vend6me Column, restored to its original look under Napoleon III, was toppled by Commune decree because of its associations with imperial (that is, Bonapartist) tyranny and warmongering, detested by many anti-Communards, too. For still others, perhaps better versed in history and the monument's original creation, the column "commemorated the triumph of France over Germany" and was pulled down as a diplomatic gesture by the Commune</page><page sequence="10">122 ART BULLETIN MARCH 1998 VOLUME LXXX NUMBER 1 J.A .;RI I DO S E D L E.', 77?

Nat., Estampes toward the victorious Prussians.66 The Arc de Triomphe was built under Louis-Philippe to serve as a gateway for trium- phant French armies. During a three-month span in 1871, it functioned as the entrance for the victorious Prussians (March 1, 1871), an outpost for the Federes, and, finally, the position from which the Versailles army fired shells down on the Tuileries during Bloody Week. One monument appears felled, the other standing, but the government that van- quished the Commune was not a Napoleonic regime. It does indeed seem highly unlikely that in this two-print sequence, the French imagination would have suppressed the Napole- onic associations in these monuments and vested them with a new political character, the Versailles government. Andrieu avoided temporal, spatial, or other kinds of sequencing in his Disastres which allowed purchasers to tell different stories with them, but his bold framing of the deposed prints with the first and last images seems to have been designed to trigger memory and association through such possible pairings as iconoclasm and relic, self-mutilation and triumph, indepen- dence and humiliation. A unique element of Andrieu's photographic project is its title. The inked, stamped captions on all of Andrieu's mats read "Disastres de la guerre" in capital letters on the first line, followed by the name of the site or monument and, occasion- ally, the moment ("apr6s l'incendie" [after the fire], for example) in smaller capital letters on the second, and ending with J. Andrieu in capital letters on the third. Of all the photographic series of Commune views known to exist, only Andrieu's does not make specific or descriptive reference in its series title to the place and time of its subject.67 This is especially surprising given the fact that most other series had texts produced by professional writers, more likely candidates than photographers to create allusive titles. The term disastre appeared frequently in contemporary writing on the ruins but differed from another common designation, ruine, which carried class associations.68 The phrase Disastres de la guerre made clear reference to an acclaimed series of etchings by the Spanish artist Francisco de Goya known then and now as Los desastres de la guerra.69 Usually dated about 1810-24, Goya's Los desastres (Fig. 9) came into public view only in 1863, when the Real Academia de San Fernando in Madrid acquired the plates and had them printed.70 Prior to 1863, only some of these prints had been known to a few collectors and connoisseurs in Spain and France. However, the series became highly visible in France during the later 1860s with the immediate acquisition by French and other collectors of the academia's editions and with the publication of a number of scholarly articles about them.71 Goya's Los desastres offered especially suitable associations for the political times. The purported subject of Goya's prints was the French invasion of Spain of 1808-14, when Napoleon placed his brotherJoseph on the throne and his French army besieged Saragossa and persecuted Spanish civilians in what became a kind of perverted civil war. The parallels between events in France in 1870-71 and those that provoked Goya's</page><page sequence="11">CREATING DESASTRES: ANDRIEU'S PHOTOGRAPHS OF URBAN RUINS IN THE PARIS OF 1871 123 9 Francisco de Goya, Tanto y mdis, etching and aquatint, pl. 22 of Los desastres de la guerra, ca. 1810-20. Paris, Bibl. Nat., Estampes ! - Los desastres were recognized at once by writers of different political positions. In his 1870journal, the moderate republi- can journalist and playwright Jules Claretie quoted Victor Hugo's words: "If Paris could become Saragossa!"''72 to com- pare the Prussian siege of Paris with the Napoleonic one of Saragossa. Gautier, a Hispanophile, made a similar analogy by describing the deeply emotional response of the young painter Henri Regnault, one of France's most honored martyrs of the Franco-Prussian War, to Goya's Los desastres shortly before he was killed in battle.73 Within the visual arts, Edouard Manet reworked Goya's striking motif of the firing squad in the Third of May, 1808 for his pictures of contempo- rary French political conflicts, The Execution of the Emperor Maximilian (1867-68) and An Execution at a Commune Barricade (1871). Since Spanish art was equated with verism in France, Goya was seen to share with photography a reputation for extreme realism, particularly in themes from modern life.74 An old Hispanophile like Prosper Merimbe found Los desastres so frank as to be repellent: "I find nothing in the least pleasing about his paintings or his etchings.... how can you possibly consider the Disasters of War aesthetically satisfying?"75 In the later 1860s, a shift occurred in the French interpretation of Los desastres, from eyewitness reports of the horrors of the Napoleonic occupation of Spain to a more general condemna- tion of war.76 In his monograph on Goya of 1867, Charles Yriarte cast a new reading of the prints: "These are not facts, particular episodes ... these are general ideas, analogies, sometimes true, always believable compositions."77 Yriarte's words carried special conviction, for not only was he a well-known art critic, but he himself was of Spanish heritage and had worked as a war illustrator in the Spanish conflict in Morocco. For his portrayal of the worst human behavior by both nationalities, Goya became a kind of "modern philoso- pher"78-high praise for a printmaker of modern life-and a skeptic of all human motives. This new view of Goya, which neutralized any anti-French sentiment in his work, meant that Andrieu's title had no trouble with the post-Commune censors. By the very end of the decade, publications on Goya distinctly describe the man, rather than his work, as having a liberal political outlook.79 Contemporary political events in Spain contributed to this rereading of Goya. In 1868, a Spanish Republic was established in relatively bloodless fash- ion, overthrowing Queen Isabel II (related to the French house of Bourbon) and accomplishing something that the French had been unable to do.80 These events reignited the French perception of a freedom-loving and democratic Span- ish national character, which emerged in Charles Blanc's important survey of Spanish art (1869), as he traced the historical reasons for the "feeling[s] of republican equality and ... communal independence which are still today so profoundly rooted in the Spanish people."81 Thus, Spanish politics occupied a highly visible position in French culture in the years between 1868 and 1870,82 and in 1870, France exploited political circumstances in Spain to advance its own political ambitions. When Spain announced a Hohenzollern prince as one of the candidates for its constitutional monarch, French ministers feared a swing in the balance of European power to Prussia's favor.83 This became the pretext for overt contention between France and Prussia and led to the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war.84 Formally, Andrieu made no reference to Goya, nor could he have. For Goya's etchings focus on the human form; site and architecture are minimal, if suggested at all. Looking at journalistic illustrations of Commune events of 1871 that echo Goya's Los desastres in the apparently haphazard place- ment of figures, lack of heroic action, and oppressive atmo- sphere of defeat, fear, and suffering (Fig. 10) underscores the differences between Andrieu's plastic vocabulary and that of the Spanish prints. On the other hand, Goya's pervasive tone of irony, exposed in the terse, universalizing captions, must</page><page sequence="12">124 ART BULLETIN MARCH 1998 VOLUME LXXX NUMBER 1 .?

Nat., Estampes have resonated with the skepticism of many French after the sudden defeat, betrayal of surrender, and harrowing conflicts. One anonymous reviewer of the photographs of Commune ruins exhibited in Cornhill found a visual irony in them: "Another striking point is the escape from destruction of all sorts of frail objects, while structures of prodigious strength and resisting forces are crumbled to atoms."85 Formal in- stances of ironic juxtapositions occur throughout Andrieu's Disastres, as in the paper posters and chalked graffiti on masonry walls that appear crumbling or blackened by fire just a few inches away. In the naming of his series, then, Andrieu traded on many of the European, sometimes specifically French, conceptions of past and present Spain. The rich ambiguity of Goya's Los desastres is still present in the range of possible readings of Andrieu's photographs. Photographic Reflections In comparing Andrieu's photographs of ruins with those by his contemporaries, two things strike one immediately: the nearly identical selection of sites and frequently similar viewpoints, and the superior technique and quality of An- drieu's prints.

Paris, Mus&amp;e Carnavalet, Cabinet des Arts Graphiques (photo: Phototheque/SPADEM) wet collodion negative and albumen print processes, but few made prints as large and well crafted as those by Andrieu. Alphonse Liebert's photographs, accompanying Alfred Au- nay's text in Les ruines de Paris et de ses environs 1870-71, offer a range of subjects most congruent with Andrieu's prints (Figs. 11, 12). Andrieu and Liebert had both worked for the French Navy (one of the official bodies most hostile to the Com- mune) and had studios on the same street, the rue St-Lazare. Liebert worked in a smaller 8-by-10-inch format, printed and focused less carefully, and produced less depth in the tonal ranges. Many of his photographs contain "ghosts," the blurred traces of persons who moved during the exposure of the plate; these sometimes lend a haunting, poignant quality to the image, but other times appear as dark stains that interrupt the scenic view. An examination of their photo- graphs of the Grenier d'Abondance, the municipal store- house of comestibles and fuels, suggests that the photogra- phers were often restricted by space and equipment in selecting their viewpoints. Even within such limitations, Li- 6bert chose to fit the entire form of a container into the lower center and right corner, placed his camera at an angle to suggest spatial recession, and made the containers echo the architectural openings facing them. As in most cases, Andrieu came up with a bolder, more compact composition through fragmentation and frontality. He cropped the large, human- oid forms of the melted foodstuff containers in the immediate foreground and positioned his camera so that they appear to press forward toward the viewer. To generalize, Liebert was more of a street photographer who occasionally evoked some sense of a human presence and response to these destruc- tions, while Andrieu composed starker, stilled pictures that emphasize the pictorial qualities of ruin.86 Hippolyte Collard, like Andrieu, achieved a monumentality and tonal richness in his prints but did not work in the serial format for these Commune subjects. Collard had already made striking views of the construction of bridges and viaducts, but he did not repeat them in his Commune photographs. Andrieu and Collard both adopted bold frontal viewpoints and created dramatic compositions in their views of bridges (Figs. 1, 13), but these dynamic, unstable pictures meant something different within their respective bodies of work. As the official photographer to the Paris department of transportation (Ponts et Chaussees), Collard was primarily concerned with documenting the materials and construction of bridges and viaducts.87 In his 1861 view positioned under- neath the new Pont St-Louis, Collard ignored conventional guidelines of picture making to convey certain information demanded by the civil engineers on the projects: the way in which the iron structural system carried the masonry and spanned a wide distance. Inverting the traditional construc- tion of spatial recession, Collard created a picture in which the form appears to spring out of the picture and into the viewer's space, filling the top section of the print, while the vista into the distance appears in the lower portion. Under the direction of the engineers and the city administration, Col- lard worked to create useful, positive, material-centered images of the latest technological improvements to the Parisian landscape.

Paris, Mus6e Carnavalet, Cabinet des Arts Graphiques (photo: Phototheque/SPADAM) opposite ends of the remaining sections of the railway bed and pointed the lens down toward the river, producing an unsettling impression in which the immediate foreground, contiguous visually with that of the viewer, plunges precipi- tously downward. Andrieu did not choose the conventional, distant profile view from downriver illustrating how the bridge buckled; instead, from an immediate position, he evoked the shock and violence of such destruction by imbu- ing the picture space with a sense of immediate danger and loss of control. This effect of careening collapse as the roadway appears to dive down into the water, especially strong in this Argenteuil view, is reworked in another photograph of a wrecked bridge at Choisy-le-Roi (Fig. 15). By following the erratic orthogonals of the railway bridge and tracks plunging downward toward death, Andrieu subverted the traditional qualities of balance and stability in frontality. His composition exploited the generally positive associations of speed and distant destination with railroads in order to rechannel them into a disturbing, even frightening image. This suggests that Andrieu was sensitive to the thematic connotations and cultural experiences of some of his views and did not treat them as interchangeable subjects with equivalent formal solutions. Authorship Little is known about Andrieu or his career before he arrived on the Parisian photographic scene in 1861 or 1862, the year he first listed in the principal Parisian commercial directory and registered prints with the D6p6t L6gal.88 The traces left by him and his career do not deviate from most performance patterns of other commercial photographers.89 He advertised a range of products and services, from portraits to stereo- graphs and lessons in photography, though it is clear from his commercial advertisements and his registration of prints that his specialty was the stereograph. His stereography expanded beyond typical European sites (France, the Pyrenees, Italy) to the Near and Middle East in 1868. So it is somewhat surprising that in 1870 and 1871, Andrieu took up more complicated equipment and technology to make the Disastres, the only large-scale prints known to his oeuvre, and then seems to have disappeared from Paris and the photography scene. Andrieu had earned some measure of success by 1865, for he called himself a photographer of the navy (Ministere de la Marine et des Colonies) and moved into more spacious and expensive quarters in the rue St-Lazare.90 His work for the navy remains unknown,91 though his stereographs of the 1869</page><page sequence="16">128 ART BULLETIN MARCH 1998 VOLUME LXXX NUMBER 1 71?\,si .

Montreal, Centre Canadien d'Architecture opening of the Suez Canal and of an 1870 military mass at the Ste-Chapelle indicate that he may have continued to use his connections with the state even after 1867, when he ceased listing himself as a navy photographer.92 Something seems to have changed for Andrieu in 1870 and 1871. Back in Paris, he claimed neither his navy employment nor his medal in his commercial listing.93 He may have had a falling out with his navy employers, or his award may have become unfashion- able. His disappearance after 1871 may have been a direct or indirect consequence of the conflicts, perhaps self-exile. Economic and other hardships during 1870-71 caused many photographers to go out of business. In July 1871, a writer in L'Echo pronounced, "If many photographers do not find their way into the Gazette as bankruptcies before the year expires, it will be highly creditable to their prudence and economy, for I imagine that few of them can have cleared expenses up to this period of the year."94 On the positive side, used photographic equipment was plentiful and cheap; An- drieu may have augmented his material at this time. By the same token, if he was unable to recoup the expense incurred by his Disastres series, Andrieu may have been forced out of the profession. By 1874, the Paris photographic publisher Adolphe Block held title to Andrieu's stock, although it is not known whether this included the large-format Disastres or whether Andrieu collaborated with him.95 In 1880, Block advertised his rights to Andrieu's mark, "JA," which meant that he had complete control over printing Andrieu's work, either from negatives or as copy prints. Pictorial evidence suggests that Andrieu worked on nega- tives or manipulated exposure during printing for enhanced aesthetic, not informational, results. In one of the views of the Pont d'Argenteuil bridge (Fig. 1), the twisted side rails in the middle- and backgrounds glow in their whiteness, here emphasized because the sky has been left a hazy light gray instead of being masked. Similarly, a rectangular form among the street rubble in a representation of the town of St-Cloud (Fig. 16) glows illogically among the darkened forms of the debris. In a view of the palace of St-Cloud (Fig. 4), working with backlighting, Andrieu produced solid areas of illumina- tion in the window frames, which seem to radiate light against their darker surrounds. The white shapes add nothing to the legibility or information of the view; rather, they provide points of purely pictorial interest. They may have been created by masking or painting over the negative or lengthen- ing the exposure time of the negative to manipulate the light-dark relationship between these blank areas and the tonally modeled forms. Unfortunately, this cannot be con- firmed, because none of Andrieu's negatives has been lo- cated. Such manual manipulation was considered appropri- ate to Commune imagery, as in the analogy to photographic intervention made by Gautier in his description of the ruins at St-Cloud. He complained that his eye was forced to "register the hateful silhouette [of three big Prussian sol- diers] that we would like to wipe away like a poorly developed photographic plate."96 The integration of artistic endeavor, including technologi- cal intervention, with commercial photography was practiced in some English and French photography circles. A critic for L'Echo commenting on the photographs of the Paris ruins begins with the claim that "photographic studies can no longer be denied a place amongst things belonging to the art-world."97 Photography's aesthetic claims were publicly championed by Ernest Lacan, a well-known figure in photog- raphy in France and England, editor of Le Moniteur de la Photographie and author of Esquisses photographiques (1855).98 Andrieu knew Lacan, for he attended a meeting held at Lacan's home to elect the organizing committee of the French photography section of the 1867 Exposition Uni- verselle.99 Unlike almost every Paris photographer of note, however, Andrieu did not exhibit there, a decision that makes little professional sense and adds to the mystery surrounding his photographic career. Yet Andrieu, despite the lack of biographical information and personal statements, left be- hind one indication of his aesthetic considerations. On the verso of a small mounted photograph depicting the Chiteau of Pau, ca. 1862, the studio stamp reads, "Photographie Artistique," evidence that the photographer aimed to make artistic pictures, not simply descriptive souvenirs, and that for him, art and commerce were not mutually exclusive.

The foreign market occupied an important place in the sales of these photographs. On July 3, 1871, Le Charivari reported that an English merchant had bought fifty thousand images of the fallen Colonne Vend6me to resell in London.104 This may well represent the hyperbole in which popular periodicals like Le Charivari and Le Monde Illustri traded as they competed for readers' attention. VWron claimed, The five parts of the world are actually fighting over the views of our disasters. -Ten thousand for Madrid. -Twenty thousand for Berlin. -One hundred thousand for London. -Two hundred thousand for New York.'05 Although such quantities are difficult to square with the number of prints surviving today,'06 they indicate, at the very least, the contemporary perception that a wide interest in and market for "ruins" photographs existed at the time. An- drieu's name appears only occasionally within lists of photog- raphers of the Paris ruins in French, English, and American periodicals and photographic journals; his specific patrons and sales are never mentioned. Non-French patrons brought different associations to these subjects, and French photographers could encourage these alternative readings. Liebert, for example, linked the Ameri- can victims of the Chicago fire of 1871 with certain French civilians surviving the Franco-Prussian conflict. In a published letter, Liebert announced that he would donate half the price of his photographic album of ruins to the victims of the Chicago fire and the other half to French widows and orphans of the 1870-71 war.107 The critical response abroad ranged from descriptions of the damages to warnings of "tricked up" photographs to proclamations of artistic achievement. Andrieu himself took advantage of two formats to target two different economic markets. At the same time that he changed technology for the large-format Disastres, he also produced stereographs of the ruins with the same series title but numbered differently from the Dep6t Legal prints. Andrieu's stereographs were already on sale by August 1871,108 and the existence of a hand-colored stereo album indicates that Block continued to publish Andrieu's stereographs after 1874.109 The large prints, considerably more expensive than stereographs, seemed to have been aimed at a somewhat wealthier, more visually discerning audience, and they reflect the formal decisions demanded of the different format. The single stereograph in the J. Paul Getty Museum (Fig. 17) reveals that Andrieu took a different approach from that of the large format (Fig. 7), setting up a different camera and choosing a different viewpoint of the same subject. The stereograph was made from the place Vend6me, perhaps in a building one story up, to create a more immediate, testimo- nial aspect in this view than the large-format print with its more distant viewpoint, around the corner, down the street, and from the top floor of a building.110 The stereograph includes a lamppost and horseless cart in the near fore- ground, a common pictorial strategy in stereography to enhance the illusion of deep space. Even though the cart's shaft appears to point to the fallen statue of Napoleon, the column becomes lost within the accumulation of forms and details, and the human figures, looking in the direction of the</page><page sequence="18">130 ART BULLETIN MARCH 1998 VOLUME LXXX NUMBER 1 -? --- ? -,-~- ---- --- ~E - snn =; r ~ 5ii~ PF * rz u r L ?' ~, 3 ~HIIIW' L~ 9 _.I~F~IIP~= r`l`? ~Fi9 -- ~~YIUn I * * a~ ti~~?- " L~ j ''' .I, -t- i.

Phot., Paris) lens, betray the anonymity of the photographic representa- tion. The stereograph sacrifices the visual punch obtained in the bolder, reductive composition of the larger print so that it could prompt an illusionistic, "you-are-there" experience. An English journalist made an interesting analogy between the physical ruins and the photographs as ruins in progress, destined to decompose and disappear: "there is the melan- cholic fact that, though a photograph may be ever so beautiful, it is but a transitory thing, and the chemicals of which it is composed are destined in a very short space of time to resolve themselves into air, and leave no trace behind them."111 At this time, photography was still considered an imperfect technology due to unstable and unreliable materi- als, which made photographs a risky purchase for long-term enjoyment and investment. This may be one reason why the public, even the wealthy, did not purchase the large-format prints in the same numbers as the less expensive stereo- graphs. Unfortunately, no nineteenth-century provenance has been defined for any of Andrieu's large or small Desastres. In the deluxe folio photographic album entitled La guerre et la Commune, twenty-one mounted Disastres are dispersed among thirty photographs, including those of allegorical prints, drawings of military events, and panoramas, none of which can be attributed to Andrieu. These are not the same twenty-one views registered with the D6p6t L6gal in 1871, and it is possible that the selection of prints was made by someone other than Andrieu, such as the owner or distributor of the album.112 The album was given by a Parisian in late 1871 to his or her sister, who had left the city before the siege and Commune and whose house the presenter's family had inhabited during those events. Two photographic reproduc- tions of pictures demonstrate a shifting view of the recent events: one, by Emile Betsellkre, illustrates the Commune's execution of priests; another, by Ignacio L0on y Escosura, representing the burning of the Tuileries (Fig. 18), is not so clearly anti-Commune in its gaping street with a solitary dead body of an executed Communard. The handwritten inscrip- tion, dated December 1871, speaks poignantly of these middle-class residents' shame at the recent conflicts, and complicates any single, so-called bourgeois response to the events and their imagery: Dear sister, during our troubles, your house was the refuge of the family; there our child found maternal care and we withstood the siege of Paris. We even found asylum there during the horrors of the Commune. We offer you this sad picture of our suffering [caused by] our disasters, I would add, of our shames, so that you might form an idea of them, you who were so lucky to have remained far away from this. May this sad album never have a pendant, may we never be reunited with you in our home except in joy and happiness.13 These emotional responses to the ruins hardly resemble the triumphant middle-class attitudes toward them as signs of the Commune's anti-bourgeois depravity that are advanced by class-based interpretations of Commune photography. Gen Doy argues that depicting the ruins was an inherently anti-Commune gesture, whose proper public was otherwise best reached through oil painting, a medium "traditionally associated with the property-owning classes."114 Doy offers Ernest Meissonier's canvas Les ruines des Tuileries (The Ruins</page><page sequence="19">CREATING DESASTRES: ANDRIEU'S PHOTOGRAPHS OF URBAN RUINS IN THE PARIS OF 1871 131 A ~ '~~~ ` CL 1 Ao IOU- :'l?:U: V 44 Pl~ P1 A Cl: : I:IF 20 Andrieu, Desastres de la guerre: L'H6tel-de-Ville, Galerie des Fetes, 1871.

A political conservative and favorite of the imperial couple, Meissonier based his composition on a photograph and, in spite of his highly naturalistic style, added an inscrip- tion in Latin at the bottom, "the glory of our forefathers survives the flames/May 1871," that specifically excluded the uneducated classes, perceived to be the "barbarians" who set fire to these buildings. But the picture's history reveals that it operated differently than Doy would have it. The painting remained in Meissonier's own home, a private picture in spite of its large dimensions, unusual in the artist's noncommis- sioned work. He did not publicly exhibit the painting until the 1883 Triennale (a conservative art exhibition), when it responded nostalgically to the demolition of the Tuileries palaces. Recent scholarship rejects the notion that the picture is a pro-Empire homage and instead views it as a more general tribute to the glory of the French nation, which could triumph even after such sorry events.115 Considering when and where Meissonier chose to exhibit the painting, he seems to have shifted its meaning in that direction, as his own political sympathies metamorphosed from fervent Bonapar- tist to "good Republican."116 Questions arise with Doy's argument: If Meissonier intended the picture as a bourgeois condemnation of the Commune, why did he not exhibit it earlier, during the period more hostile to Communards, or find a buyer among one of Doy's anti-Commune bourgeois? And why are there so few paintings of Commune ruins (not unlike the scarcity of paintings of the urban renovations) to satisfy this anti-Commune bourgeois contingent? Andrieu seems to have looked to this contingent himself. Early on, he presented his Desastres to a bourgeois, antiradical organ, L'lllustration. Judging by its price and the viewpoints expressed in the articles on current events, this illustrated weekly appealed to a well-to-do, moderately republican, and anti-Commune audience. Andrieu provided two photographs of an urban and a suburban ruin that served as models for wood engravings by the paper's stable of draftsmen and engravers. This patronage did not have further issue, and three months later, Andrieu submitted his Desastres for inde- pendent commercial sale to the D6p6t L6gal. His photo- graphs seem to have been problematic for L'lllustration.

Andrieu, L'Illustration, July 22, 1871, 52. Paris, Bibl. Nat. Pichot transformed Andrieu's photographic model into a more conventional, legible picture. They added a top-hatted figure for scale and human interest, cast shadows for effect, neatened up some aspects (for example, the charred marks on the columns, the ironwork in the roof, and even the wonderfully melted and contorted chandeliers), and omitted forms such as the ladder, wheelbarrow, and interior windows. TheJuly 15 engraving after another ofAndrieu's photographs did not relate to any written piece (Figs. 14, 22).118 Here, the draftsman and engraver omitted the disconcerting fore- ground element of the railway bed tilted sharply downward toward the river. Lowering the horizon line, adding clouds, and altering the light-dark contrasts, they produced a sym- metrical, stable view, lacking any sense of danger or discom- fort, the very quality that makes the photographs so stimulat- ing. To assure readers of the truthfulness of the engravings, both captions state that the engravings were based on photo- graphs by Andrieu, but their substantial alterations suggest that the periodical's directors deemed Andrieu's work in its original state unsatisfactory to its consumers. It is difficult to imagine that the motivation for Andrieu's series was its reproduction here; rather, the publication of his work and name in a widely circulating periodical like L'Illustration was a happy opportunity, providing him with important exposure and some financial reward. The novelist, playwright, journalist, and occasional art and photography critic Jules Claretie must figure into this discus- sion of the potential audiences for Andrieu's Disastres and the traces of their reception.119 Claretie wrote frequently for L'Illustration, and he authored the article on the ruins of the HOtel de Ville that was illustrated with the wood engraving after Andrieu's photograph.120 Claretie may have participated in the selection of Andrieu's images for the periodical, and he included the other engraving of the Pont d'Argenteuil (but did not acknowledge the photographic model) in one of his history books on the events of 1870-71.121 Claretie, who wrote a travelogue on a journey through Spain and France in 1869-70, made analogies between contemporary military events in France and Goya's Los desastres. When he reported and illustrated the military events at Le Bourget in 1870 for L'illustration,122 Claretie represented a French peasant killed while collecting cauliflower, which he likened to "the horrors of Goya."123 In addition, Claretie constantly brought aesthetic concerns into his commentary on the ruins, as in this passage: Ruined, burned, and devastated, City Hall still remains the most superb of the Parisian ruins. Its primitive harmony has given way to a picturesque and funerary disorder which wrings one's heart, while offering to one's eyes one of those horribly beautiful spectacles that comes from such destruction. ... Terror, is this the feeling that one has? No: the artistic feeling is so strong, and the disaster has made something so beautiful from these sumptuous things that one stops and admires.124 Claretie's interests and his escapist angle away from the politics and toward the beauty of the ruins seem well matched to Andrieu's photographic project. Perhaps he had foreseen an eventual publication with the photographer, and he seems a likely source to have suggested Goya's print title to Andrieu before the photographer submitted his prints with the Disas- tres title to the Dep6t Legal in October.125 Andrieu's short-lived adoption of large-format photogra- phy, title allusion to Goya's art, bold and varied compositions, manipulation to enhance pictorial rather than informational elements, and lack of text all suggest that he designed his large Disastres with a certain audience in mind: those more interested in aesthetics than facts, concerned with memories more than with ideologies.

Notes I am grateful to the Canadian Centre for the Visual Arts, National Gallery of Canada, for awarding me the 1995-96 Lisette Model/Joseph G. Blum Fellowship in the History of Photography, which supported research in French archives, libraries, and photography collections and nourished collegial exchange. I wish to extend special thanks to curator Ann Thomas and assistant curator Lori Pauli for their help and interest; to photo conservator John McElhone for talking technique; to curator emeritus James Borcoman for looking at photographs with me; to Irwin Reichstein for sharing his knowledge and collection of stereo views; and to the members of the Photography Collectors Group for their enthusiasm. Curators Catherine Mathon at the Ecole Nationale Sup6rieure des Beaux-Arts and FranCoise Reynaud at the Mus6e Carnavalet kindly facilitated my research. John Paoletti, Lory Frankel, and the anonymous readers for the Art Bulletin all contributed thoughtful suggestions that improved my original composition.

See also n. 10 below. 2. Doy, 18, briefly mentions the possibility of contradictory readings of Commune ruin photographs, but her article's title, "The Camera against the Paris Commune," implies that the photographers intended to indict the political movement. English is an exception in his prevailing concern with function rather than intention. 3. Linda Nochlin, "Paris Commune Photos at a New York Gallery: An Interview with Linda Nochlin," interviewed by Jon Wiener, Radical History Review 32 (1985): 64-65, resists grouping Bruno Braquehais's photographs of ruins with his "pro-Commune" barricade and street views, but Braquehais included both kinds of views in the same album; he did not pitch them to different audiences. 4. In particular, the work of Bruno Braquehais. See nn. 1-3 above. 5. For a contemporary disclaimer that these "pro-Communard" views were objective records of contemporary events, see the French correspondent, "Posturing for Posterity," Daily Telegraph, reprinted as "Composing an Histori- cal Photograph," Photographic World 1, no. 7 (July 1871): 219-20, which relates that a Commune officer and his fifteen men at the rue Castiglione barricade discussed with the photographer how to depict the barricade "in a state of battle" before hundreds of people. 6. Andrieu never published professionally his first name. The once common assumption that theJ. stood for Jules now appears to have been a conflation of his identity with that of a leading figure of the Paris Commune,Jules Andrieu. Denis Pellerin published a place (Montaigu, Tarn-et-Garonne) and year of birth (1816) for a Jean Andrieu in Dictionnaire mondial de la photographie des origines d nosjours (Paris: Larousse, 1994), 32, but efforts to contact Mr. Pellerin for the source of this information have gone unanswered. The documents in the Archives Departementales in Montauban (Montaigu, Naissances, 1813-23, GE117 28) do not confirm this Jean Andrieu, born July 15, 1816, to be the photographer in Paris. ThisJean Andrieu became a primary school teacher by 1837 and found a replacement for his military service in 1840 (Montaigu, Listes d6partementales, Arrondissement Moissac, Classe 1836, no. 343, Doc. 60 R8). Many primary school teachers, or former ones, became involved in the Paris Commune; Maurice Dommanget, L'enseignement, I'enfance et la culture sous la Commune (Paris: Librairie de l'Etoile, 1964). See subheading "Authorship," 23 ff., for further biographical discussion. 7. Prints are located in the Cabinet des Estampes of the Bibliothbque Nationale, Mus&amp;e Carnavalet, Ecole Nationale Sup~rieure des Beaux-Arts, Bibliothtque Historique de la Ville de Paris, all in Paris, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, and a multiauthor album in the Canadian Centre for Architecture in Montreal. No single collection possesses all forty-seven views, but, not surprisingly, the Mus&amp;e Carnavalet, devoted to the history of the city of Paris, has the largest holding, thirty-eight views plus three duplicate prints. Andrieu's prints gain monumentality and breadth from the deluxe folio dimensions of their mats, something that is lost with modern museum matting flush with the print's edges, which cramps and contains the formal play. The prints submitted to the Dep6t Legal did not have these special mats, which were an extra expense for Andrieu and an additional bulk to store at the D~p6t. But in the presentation, stamping, and numbering of the Dip6t prints, Andrieu made clear his intention of having a border around the images. 8. Bibl.

With the explosion of the market for vintage photographs in the 1960s, many dealers, collectors, and institutions were induced to dismantle albums in order to catalogue or sell the prints piecemeal.</page><page sequence="22">134 ART BULLETIN MARCH 1998 VOLUME LXXX NUMBER 1 10. Only one publication on Commune photography mentions Andrieu's Disastres: Christine Lapostolle, "Plus vrai que le vrai: Strat6gie photographique et Commune de Paris," Actes de la Recherche en Sciences Sociales 73 (June 1988): 67-76. In "De la barricade A la ruine," La Recherche Photographique 6 (June 1989): 21-27, Lapostolle does not mention Andrieu but illustrates one of his photographs. Unable to consultJoil Petitjean's master's thesis, "Recherches sur la photographie et la Commune" (Universit6 de Dijon, 1986), I cannot speak of her treatment of Andrieu's series. A few of the prints have received concise formal and historical readings in exhibition catalogues of permanent collections. Catherine Mathon was the first to present and examine some of Andrieu's photographs in Les chefs-d'oeuvre de la photographie dans les collections de 'Ecole des Beaux-Arts, exh. cat., Ecole Nationale Sup6rieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris, 1991, 4-9. Two other prints from the collections of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts were included without any specific commentary in La photographie comme moddle, exh. cat., Ecole Nationale Sup6rieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris, 1982, 8-9, nos. 6, 7. This was followed by James Borcoman, Magicians of Light: Photographs from the Collection of the National Gallery of Canada, exh. cat., National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, 1993, 104-5. 11.

This has been argued by numbers of historians of various specializations, notably Theodore Zeldin, France 1848-1945, 5 vols. (Oxford: Oxford Univer- sity Press, 1981). Art historians using this argument have come up with different conclusions; for example, Paul Tucker, "The First Impressionist Exhibition in Context," in The New Painting: Impressionism, 1874-1886, exh. cat., the Fine Arts Museums, San Francisco, 1986, 93-117; and idem, Monet in the 1890s, exh. cat., Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 1989; and Albert Boime, Art and the Paris Commune: Imagining Paris after War and Revolution, (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1995). 13.

When the GND agreed to an armistice, thus ending the siege, many Parisians felt that their great sacrifices during this time were ignored and unrewarded, while the provincials, who had suffered little in terms of physical privation and armed aggression, were given the peace and stability they craved. 15. Francisque Sarcey, Le siege de Paris: Impressions et Souvenirs, 21st ed. (Paris, 1871), 344-45. 16. A notable exception was the philanthropic art collector Sir Richard Wallace-of English citizenship-who provided valuable assistance during the Prussian siege of Paris but then moved himself and his collection to the relative political stability of England. 17. For example, the widely read Adolphe Joanne, Paris illustri en 1870, 3d ed. (Paris: Hachette, 1871); for Hans and Blanc's Paris guide, see nn. 39, 44, 45 below. 18. L'lllustration published its first engravings after photographs by Franck in itsJune 17, 1871, issue, and Disd6ri advertised in Le Charivari ofJuly 2 that his photographs were on sale in all Paris book and photo shops; English, 24. Edmond de Goncourt, Paris under Siege 1870-1871, ed. and trans. George J. Becker (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1969), 289, notes in his entry for May 16, 1871, while walking the streets of Paris, "In the gaslight I look at magnificent photographs showing the ruined houses at Saint-Cloud." I make this point that the shop windows offered these views to Parisians of various classes because audience and critical reception are not limited by ownership, even if some of these observers were not courted by the photographer. 19. English, 64-70, describes the difficulties in enforcing this measure, published in Gazette des Tribunaux, Dec. 31, 1871, 911. The decree is reprinted in Andre Rouill6, La photographie en France: Textes et controverses: Une anthologie 1816-1871 (Paris, 1989), 485. English qualifies the photographs of ruins as "artistic" (he also places the term in quotation marks), but no such qualification appears in the decree. 20. English, 69. In addition, photographic portraits of suspected Commu- nards made with the sitters' cooperation were later often used to identify them so that they could be brought to trial. 21. Photographic News, Oct. 12, 1871, 492, citing a French newspaper. 22. English, 67-68. 23. Emile Robert was the first to register (June 21, 1871), with 24 views of Paris as well as some portraits; Appert, 31 portraits on Oct. 7, 1871; Franck, 23 views of ruins on Oct. 24, 1871; and Braquehais, 109 photographs of the siege on Nov. 29, 1871. Collard and Libbert registered photographs in 1872. 24. Huge gaps (in the hundreds) appear in the D6p6t numbering of Andrieu's stereographs, and at least some of these unregistered views exist. 25. Alfred d'Aunay and Alphonse Li6bert, Les ruines de Paris et de ses environs 1870-71, 2 vols. (Paris: La Photographie Am6ricaine, 1872). 26. Like most other photographers and printmakers, Andrieu included no images of religious edifices damaged during the Commune. The Commune's anticlericalism was prominent; in early April, it declared the separation of Church and State and seized religious properties. The question of why religious sites were excluded from this visual representation needs study. 27. These terms are identified and examined thoughtfully by Elaine Scarry, 1985a, "Injury and the Structure of War," Representations 10 (Spring): 1-51; and idem, 1985b, The Body in Pain: The Making and Unmaking of the World (New York: Oxford University Press, 1985). 28. Selective practices remain alive and well, especially among picture makers working at the front, where the dangers of the battlefield are very real. The number of photographic and filmic representations of bodily combat (excluding the whiz-kid technology of "surgical strike" bombing footage) are rare. Shootings and other maimings of bodies may be recorded if the subjects are "them"; if "us," the audience would wonder why the camera operator had not stopped to help his or her comrades. Scarry, 1985b (as in n. 27), 61, argues that civil combat more closely resembles the circumstances of torture than war between different nations or peoples. 29. Matthew L. Lalumia, Realism and Politics in Victorian Art of the Crimean War (Ann Arbor, Mich.: UMI Press, 1984), examines the ways in which photogra- phers of the Crimean War worked within the boundaries of political and patrons' demands. Joel Snyder, "Photographers and Photographs of the Civil War," in The Documentary Photograph as a Work of Art: American Photographs, 1860-1876, exh. cat., Davis and Alfred Smart Gallery, the University of Chicago, 1976, 17-22, delves into the conventions and aesthetics of documen- tary photography of the American Civil War. 30. The exceptions were few and nonsubversive. Disd6ri's close-up views of the cadavers of executed Communards were probably made for the authorities rather than from a rekindling of his earlier socialist political beliefs of the 1840s. Elizabeth Anne McCauley, A.A.E. Disddri and the Carte de Visite Portrait Photograph (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1985), 212, mentioned the probability of a police commission for these photographs. A few albumen prints appear in a dossier in the AVP, D3R4/272, labeled Etat des tu6s, bless6s, photographies de 1870-71. Could these in fact represent the bodies of French national guard soldiers killed in the failed attack against the Prussians ofJan. 19, 1871? Under municipal orders, the unclaimed bodies were photographed and the prints (not the bodies) were publicly exhibited so that families could identify and bury the bodies. Le Sidge de Paris, Sept. 28, 1870, 3, mentions that sixty bodies remained unclaimed and were buried together in their coffins with honors. The photographs of heaped bodies by Marconi, photographer of nudes (acadimies) for students at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, appear to have been staged with live, unwounded models. 31. Viator, "From across the Water, Paris Oct. 16, 1871, " Anthony's Photo- graphic Bulletin 2, no. 24 (Dec. 1871): 397: "Mr. Reutlinger ... has negatives of the Confederate dead ... and is doing a lively business in selling from them pictures of the killed about the Paris fortifications"; "All the World Over," Photographic World 2, no. 14 (Feb. 1872): 61: "They are selling stereoscopic views of our late civil war, in Paris, for views of the Franco-Prussian war"; "Echoes of the Month," Photographic News 15, no. 671 (July 14, 1871): 328: "Unfortunately for those who delight in the study of the grim horrors in the ghastly catalogue, there comes the reminder that sham scenes of havoc, manufactured and photographed to gratify morbid tastes, have been issued, and such interest as belongs to sad reality is marred by the doubt which may occur as to the genuineness of the portrayals. Photographs of ruined buildings and public monuments can scarcely be sophisticated, but as regards war victims, the observer is never sure that he is not expending his sympathy on poses plastiques." 32. It is also interesting to note that, for the first time in over fifty years, the then esteemed book Les ruines, ou Miditations sur les rivolutions des empires (1791) by the anti-absolutist Comte de Volney was reprinted in Paris in 1871. Volney, considering the French Revolution, politicized the imagery of ruins- albeit exotic ones-as ominous warnings to all oppressors that they prepare their own downfall. 33.

Andrieu could have inserted human witnesses, as evidenced in his stereo view of the fallen Vend6me Column, in which several figures appear, and in other large Disastres prints representing carefully tucked away coats, shoes, and other articles of clothing. 41. Once the Third Republic felt secure in its political future, it quashed plans to establish a national art museum on the Tuileries site, and Minister Antonin Proust, president of the commission to preserve historic monuments, pushed through legislation to raze the buildings in 1883. The palace of St-Cloud was left standing longer, probably because its suburban park setting removed it from associations with government and allowed it to evolve into a picturesque garden ruin. 42.

Hans and Blanc, 77-78, claim this was a show of force after the armistice of late Jan. 1871, and they point out the irony that three months later, the Communards used the same method to destroy public buildings and monu- ments in Paris. Claretie, 122, states that St-Cloud was burned (he does not say by whom) on Dec. 11, 1870. Louis Reau, Histoire du vandalisme: Les monuments ditruits de l'artfranCais (1958), ed. and enl. by Michel Fleury and Guy-Michel Leproux (Paris: Robert Laffont, 1994), 788, gives the date as Oct. 13, 1870. 46. In fact, Napoleon III left for the Franco-Prussian War from St-Cloud. 47. The National Assembly in Bordeaux in Feb. 1871 reasserted the responsibility of ex-ruler Napoleon III "for the ruin, for the invasion, and for the dismemberment of the country," quoted in Williams, 119. 48. Gautier, 327. 49. Hans and Blanc, 8-9. 50. Sir William Erskine, quoted in Georges Bell [Joachim Hounau], Paris incendii: Histoire de la Commune de 1871 (Paris: Auguste Marc, ca. 1872), 138; and in Reau (as in n. 45), 803, with emphasis not given in Bell. Erskine's upper-class skepticism of the Communards' motives is apparent (he writes that they destroyed police headquarters and the law courts in Paris to obliterate traces of their unsavory pasts), but he also makes less biased comments, such as the fact that the fires damaged equally homes of private individuals completely uninvolved in political affairs and buildings that functioned as lawful guardians of all public records; Bell, 138. Bell's book was published by the publishers of L'Illustration and included many wood engravings created for that illustrated newspaper. See below for L'lIllustration's relationship with Andrieu. 51. I recall here the words of modern-day photographer Camilo Jose Vergara: "I propose that as a tonic for our imagination, as a call for renewal, as a place within our national memory, a dozen city blocks of pre-Depression skyscrapers [in Detroit] be stabilized and left standing as ruins: an American Acropolis. I would transform the nearly 100 troubled buildings into a grand national historic park of play and wonder.... People need to say, Damn it, this used to be a symbol of failure, but damn it, this is now something sublime," quoted by James Bennet, "A Tribute to Ruin Irks Detroit," New York Times, Dec. 16, 1995, 22. He, too, speaks of a need to create something in destruction, to find good in failure. 52.

Old Parisian, in the Telegraph, quoted in "Photography in Paris," Photographic News, 15, no. 667 (June 16, 1871): 287: "I have before referred to going out to see the ruins-I distinctly state I decline going out to see any more. I have supped full of them, and they have given me indigestion. I have just been nearly caught by a photographer; but I turned ... a closed eye on that black devil and all his works." 55.

Emile Zola, Au Bonheur des Dames (1883), repr. in Les Rougon-Macquart, vol. 3 (Paris: Fasquelle et Gallimard, 1964), 596-97: "Endlessly one heard the grinding of winches lifting freestones, the abrupt unloading of iron planks, the clamor of these workers, accompanied by the noise of pickaxes and hammers. But, more than anything, that which deafened people was the vibration of the machines; everything ran on steam, the sharp hissing shredded the air; while, at the slightest gust of wind, a cloud of plaster flew up and threw itself over the neighboring roofs like a snowfall.... Finally, [the garment workers], exasperated, even had to give up on closing their eyes; they were shaken in their alcove, the noises turned into nightmares as soon as fatigue numbed them. Then, they got up in bare feet ... and stood frightened before the vision of the [store] Bonheur des Dames blazing ... like a colossal forge where their ruin was being made." 57.

After the war and the Commune, the human consequences of Hauss- mann's project were depicted as "fact," not caricature; for example, the engraving by Scott and Lix, Moving House during the Piercing of the Avenue de l'Opira, ca. 1876, published in Jean des Cars and Pierre Pinon, eds., Paris--Haussmann: "Lepari d'Haussmann" (Paris: Pavillon de l'Ars~nal, 1991), 79. 60. The accompanying poem by M6ry (two lines are cited beneath the image to direct the reader), "La vieille Luthce," L'lllustration, Jan. 7, 1860, 6, makes this reference explicit, as well as a comparison between the personifica- tion of Paris and an aging Venus who has become so fat that she is bursting out of her clothes and needs additional breathing room. 61. Paris and Its Progress, ca. 1861, published as the frontispiece to Les artistes anciens et modernes, vol. 9 (Paris: Bertauts, ca. 1861).

It is interesting to note that oil paintings of the urban renovations are rare. A few exceptions are Geslier, Demolition of the Old H6tel-Dieu, Giuseppe de Nittis, Piercing of the Avenue de l'Opira, and Buot, La Butte des Moulin during the Piercing of the Avenue de l'Opira, all three in the Mus6e Carnavalet, Paris. A much later work, Louis-Robert Carrier-Belleuse, Demolitions at the Gare St-Lazare, 1888 (Mus&amp;e d'Art et d'Archeologie, Moulins), was exhibited at the 1888 Salon. 63. For a recent treatment of this myth, see Gen Doy, "Women, Class and Photography: The Paris Commune of 1871," in Seeing and Consciousness: Women, Class and Representation (Oxford: Berg, 1995), 82-106. I am grateful to Todd Porterfield for bringing this book to my attention. 64. I have consulted Otto Lorenz, Catalogue gindral de la LibrairiefranCaise, vols. 5, 8 (Paris: Lorenz, 1876-80); Bibliographie de la France (Paris: Au Cercle de la Librairie de l'Imprimerie, 1870-72); photographic journals; and publica- tion notices in photography and art periodicals. 65. Some gaps can be filled with other prints of the same subject; for example, between Andrieu's numbered prints 3 and 10 can be inserted additional views of the H6tel de Ville or even another of the Tuileries Palace, two major monuments that were always included, usually at the beginning, in print series of the devastations of 1870-71. 66. An American observer of the events made this remark less than a year later in an address delivered at the Cooper Union, New York, Feb. 10, 1872; Elliot C. Cowdin, France in 1870-71 (NewYork, 1872), 48. 67. For example, the photographic albums (author listed first, then photog- rapher) of Edouard Moreau and Pierre Petit, Guide-recueil de Paris br~im: Evinements de mai 1871;Justin Lallier and P. Loubert, Album photographique des ruines de Paris; Alfred d'Aunay and Alphonse Libbert, Les ruines de Paris et de ses environs 1870-71; and, Bruno Braquehais, Paris pendant la Commune; as well as later, pro-Commune publications that compiled reproductions from various sources, such as Paris sous la Commune par un timoin fiddle: La photographie, 26 issues (Paris-Sceaux: Charaire, 1895), and Armand Dayot, L'invasion, le siige et la Commune (Paris: Flammarion, 1901). 68. s.v."ruine," Encyclopidie, vol. 14 (1765), defined ruines as "only palaces, sumptuous tombs or public monuments," never "in speaking of a rural or bourgeois private house." And Bernardin de Saint-Pierre differentiated between the educated upper classes who took only passive pleasure in the form of ruins, and the vulgar lower classes, who enjoyed the actual destruc- tion. See Roland Mortier's discussion, La podtique des ruines en France (Geneva: Droz, 1974), 8, 127-29. 69. The Real Academia de San Fernando in Madrid invented this title and justified its use by claiming that Goya himself had used it, even though the edition formerly in the collection of Goya's close friend Cefin Bermfidez bore another, more historically explicit title, Fatales consecuencias de la sangrienta guerra de Espana con Buonaparte. The renaming by the academia diffused the political polemic surrounding the series and promoted its "art" status to bolster its salability, especially north of the Pyrenees. Jesusa Vega discusses the context and meaning of these titlings in "Entorno a Los Desastres de la Guerra y su decimononica modernidad," in Goya: Die sozialen Konflikte seiner Zeit und die Rezeption seiner Kunst im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert, International Congress (Osnabrfick, Germ.: Universitfit Osnabrifick, 1991), 105-6. For a recent and concise synthesis and reconsideration of Goya's print series, see Vega's contribution in Goya and the Spirit of the Enlightenment, exh. cat., Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 1989, 185-210. 70. It is generally believed that Goya had not published these prints because of their politically explosive content, and there is no evidence, as there is for Los caprichos, that Goya made these prints for commercial sale. I thank Carl Chiarenza for reminding me of this important distinction.</page><page sequence="24">136 ART BULLETIN MARCH 1998 VOLUME LXXX NUMBER 1 71. Nigel Glendinning, Goya and His Critics (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1977), 14, notes the fact that the Goncourt brothers had already seen Goya's "new" series byJan. 4, 1863, before the Real Academia's first edition came out in Mar. 1863. He suggests that they might have seen copies of trial proofs made in 1862 or earlier artist's proofs. By that time, Goya and his art were more familiar and admired than they had been during the earlier phase of French espagnolisme, which included the opening of the Galerie Espagnole in the Louvre (1838-48) and French Romantic writers and artists traveling to Spain in the 1840s. See Ilse Hempel Lipschutz, Spanish Painting and the French Romantics (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1972); Jeannine Baticle, Louis Philippe et la galerie espagnole 1838-1848 (Paris: R4eunion des Mushes Nationaux, 1981); and Alisa Luxenberg, "Over the Pyrenees and through the Looking-Glass: French Culture Reflected in Its Imagery of Spain," in Spain, Espagne, Spanien: Foreign Artists Discover Spain 1800-1900, exh. cat., New York, the Equitable Gallery and the Spanish Institute, 1993, 9-31. 72. Claretie, 20, dated Sept. 10, 1870. 73. Gautier, 178-80. 74. William Stirling, Annals of the Artists of Spain (1848, repr., London: J. C. Nimo, 1891), 162, 173, refers to photography (he uses the conventional reference to daguerreotypes even though the photographs in his book were calotypes) when describing Spanish art's verism. His was the first art history text to be published with photographs. Laurent Math6ron, Goya (Paris: Schulz et Thuilli6, 1858), n.p., describes Goya's working process as photographic, "he had only the time to photograph the most salient images [and] scenes." 75. Letter to Duchess Colonna, 1869, quoted in Glendinning, 110. 76. One should be critical of the reasons for this change of interpretation on the part of the French critics. This new reading absolved the French nation of the crimes and oppression perpetrated by the Napoleonic regime on the Spanish people at a moment when the Second Empire was losing favor. 77. Charles Yriarte, Goya: Sa biographie et le catalogue de l'oeuvre (Paris: Henry Pion, 1867), 113. A Frenchman with Spanish blood relations, Yriarte seems to have used his reading of Goya's Los desastres to hold at bay an extremely unpleasant thought-that the French were responsible for the violence and torture represented in the prints (115-16): "I continue to believe that it is not necessary to write at the top of these vengeful plates 'The War of the French in Spain,' but simply 'The War,' and to generalize about the subject as Goya did. ... there is not a single plate that is not an angry cry ... everything is used against the French." 78. Gustave Brunet, Etude sur Francisco Goya (Paris: Aubry, 1865), 8, describes Goya's expression as modern philosophy. 79. Glendinning (as in n. 71), 89, finds that during the 1860s, Goya and his art became signs for the "expression of the liberal aspirations of the Spanish people." The English painter and critic Philip Gilbert Hamerton, Etchings and Etchers (London: Macmillan, 1868), 290, called Goya "a son of the great revolution, and liberal in feeling"; the French curator Georges Duplessis, Les merveilles de la gravure (Paris: Hachette, 1869), 92, described him as an apostle of liberty for Spain. Duplessis's book was translated into Spanish in 1873. 80. Charles A. M.

In Paris in 1866, General Juan Prim and his Spanish supporters (Progressives and Democrats) planned an uprising in Spain for that year, but the coup failed. Prim was admired by many in France for having refused in 1861 to cooperate with the French in Mexico in their plan to place Maximilian on the throne, which ended in disaster. After Prim successfully staged the coup of 1868, the deposed Isabel II, a Bourbon after all, sought refuge in Paris, so that Spanish politics was present and played out in part on French soil. Spain also offered a physical refuge from the events of 1870-71 for French people of various careers and political beliefs, including the disappointed politician L(on Gambetta, the injured artist L6on Bonnat, and the court-martialed Marshal Achille Bazaine, who escaped from prison in 1874. 83. Roger L. Williams, The French Revolution of 1870-71 (New York: Norton, 1969), 74. 84. Instead of squeezing Spain, the French minister demanded that Prussia renounce its candidate (which it did) and then aggressively forbade any future Prussian candidacies, which the Prussian emperor refused to accede to. The Prussian minister Otto von Bismarck exploited the message to insult the French, thus leading to the ill-considered French declaration of war on Prussia. Already in the summer of 1871, some French opinion had turned against one of the Spanish revolutionary leaders, Prim, blaming him and Eug~nie, the Spanish-born wife of Napoleon III, for the Franco-Prussian war and, ultimately, France's defeat. Paul de Saint-Victor, "Les malheurs et miseres de la guerre: Henri Regnault," L'Artiste (July-Aug. 1871): 236, calls Prim "one of the authors of the accursed war that was our downfall" and goes on to say that France will always have an implacable bitterness toward him. In his memoirs on the siege, Claretie, 36, describes a scene in which three dummies, apparently representing Napoleon, Eug~nie, and Prim, were hung from a tree with a note labeling them "Imperial Family." 85. "Echoes of the Month," Photographic News (as in n. 31), 328, citing an unnamed writer from L'Echo. 86. Pierre Petit produced prints of even smaller and lesser quality than those of Libbert and introduced the visual strategy of showing "before" and "after" photographs of the same site, obviously drawing on photographs made earlier and for a different context. The photographer whose prints most closely compare with Andrieu's in their composition, technique, and quality is E. Duran, but his views of the Tuileries date from over a decade later, to the summer of 1882, before the palace complex was razed. 87.

Almanach-Annuaire du Commerce (Paris, 1862), 95, 1004, 1335. I give the year 1861 because the Almanach's information often reflected earlier circum- stances gathered prior to publication. 89. He began in modest quarters in the rue Montholon, from which he published and sold his own photographs, printed in an equally modest studio in the rue Montmartre, the heart of commercial Paris; AVP, Calepins du Cadastre, rue Montholon, 1862, D1P4/752, and rue Montmartre nos. 1-98, 1862 D1P4/755. 90.

The Archives de la Marine, Vincennes, found no dossier for Andrieu, and searches through the personnel papers in the Archives Nationales gave no information. The Mus6e de la Marine, Paris, is in the process of organizing and identifying its photographic collections, which I could not consult, but it is hoped that eventually they will yield further information about Andrieu's association with the Navy. It seems to have been common for photographers of Commune subjects to come from the ranks of the army or national guard; as Ernest Lacan, "French Correspondance," Photographic News 15, no. 675 (Aug. 11, 1871): 379, wrote, "photographers were all in the ranks of our army or National Guard." 92. The Suez Canal stereos are mentioned inJohn S. Waldsmith, Stereo Views: An Illustrated History and Price Guide (Radnor, Pa.: Wallace-Homestead, 1991), 30, 94; and the Ste-Chapelle mass stereo was reproduced in William Culp Darrah, The World ofStereographs (Gettysburg, Pa.: Darrah 1977), 164, although its poor quality makes it difficult to ascertain whether it had been heavily retouched. A Catholic Church official in Jerusalem, Monsignor Joseph Valerga, wrote a letter of recommendation for Andrieu that the photographer published as a foreword in his 1869 catalogue of stereo views of the Holy Land. Nissan N. Perez, Focus East: Early Photography in the Near East 1839-1885 (New York: Abrams, 1988), 126, cites Valerga's letter in partial translation, and on 246 lists Andrieu's Catalogue historique et descriptif des vues sttiioscopiques de Palestine, de Syrie et d'Egypte (Paris, 1869). 93. His 1867-69 listings, Almanach-Annuaire du Commerce (Paris, 1867), 1153, include the symbol for a medal, without specifying the award or whether he earned it through his photography, and it disappears in 1870. Puzzling out such clues might lead to the surmise that Andrieu did not run a full advertisement in 1868 and 1869 because he spent much time abroad during those years. 94. L'Echo, quoted in "Echoes of the Month," Photographic News (as in n. 31 ), 328. The author is probably referring to the Parisjournal Gazette des Tribunaux. 95.

Many pages later, Gautier, 317-18, delivers a similar analogy: "But our surprise was so great ... to no longer see, in the middle of the place Vend6me, this gigantic bronze exclamation point. ... The eye does not willingly accept these metamorphoses of appearances, and on our retina, as on a poorly wiped daguerrotype plate, is still outlined the missing black silhouette [of the Vend6me Column]." 97. L'Echo, paraphrased in "Echoes of the Month," Photographic News (as in n. 31), 328. 98. Lacan dedicated this book (Paris: Grassart, 1856) to his former art teacher L0on Cogniet, an academician not opposed to using photography in his own painting processes. 99.

Paris: as for Versailles; an exhibition at 11, rue Le Peletier announced in the Gazette des Beaux-Arts during the winter 1871-72 was to have shown both paintings and photographs of the siege of Paris. Chronique des arts de la curiositi 1 (Dec. 10, 1871): 12, and 6 (Jan. 14, 1872): 60; the catalogue Le siege de Paris 1870-71 (Paris, 187) is described as an exhibition of paintings, but it would not be surprising if the photographs were simply left out of the catalogue. London: on London's Conduit Street, photographs of the Franco-Prussian and Commune "troubles" were especially welcomed, as reported from Le Moniteur de la photographie in Photographic News 15, no. 687 (Nov. 3, 1871): 518.

In "Chronique," L'Artiste, Sept. 1871, 392, "M. Pierre Petit ... will soon have at his place the most curious archives of contemporary history. One knows the art and vigor with which he portrayed these individuals. He is reproached for having portrayed the men of the Commune: but do we reproach David for having painted Marat?" 103.

Pierre VWron, "Courrier de Paris," Le Monde Illustr? 15, no. 740 (June 17, 1871). One might ask why such imagery, intended for export, does not reflect its foreign audience by carrying translated titles on the mounts. One possible answer is that it may have been considered unnecessary, because the buildings' French names change little when translated into Romance and Anglo-Saxon languages. 106. Relatively inexpensive stereographs could easily balloon the numbers known today. 107. Letter from Alphonse Liebert, quoted by Ernest Lacan, "French Correspondance," Photographic News 15, no. 687 (Nov. 3, 1871): 520. Li bert's album was exhibited Nov.-Dec. 1971 and could be purchased for 250 francs. 108. "Novelties: Stereoscopic Views," Anthony 's Photographic Bulletin 2, no. 16 (Aug. 1871): 275. The earlier sale of Andrieu's stereographs suggests that this series was finished earlier than the large-format one, submitted in part to the Drp6t LUgal a few months later. 109. I am indebted to M. Gerard LUvy of Paris for the information about the existence of a colored stereo album. None of Andrieu's earlier prints are hand-colored, and Mme Block was well known for her eidetic photo-coloring skills. This album must have been made sometime after Block gained control of Andrieu's stock in 1874. 110. In the large-format print, the barricades appear to be damaged, which suggests that Andrieu made this view after Bloody Week, unlike Braquehais, who made some photographs during the interval between the toppling of the Colonne Vend6me and the suppression of the Commune. 111. "Photography and Current History," Photographic News 16, no. 704 (Mar. 1, 1872): 97. 112. The number of prints may reflect Andrieu's adherence to the idea of the 1852 law, if not the letter of it. He had registered 21 prints, so he could sell 21 at a time. 113.

This interpretation in Ernest Meissonier, exh. cat., Musee des Beaux-Arts, Lyons, 1993, 175-76, is based on Meissonier's redefinition of the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel's Chariot of Peace, which he represented framed by the distant portal, as a chariot of Victory turning its back and moving off into the distance. But these words appear much later in an exhibition catalogue of 1893, Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier, Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris, 6, no. 8: "In the background, Victory seems to be going off in her chariot, she is leaving us." 116. John W. Mollett, The Great Artists: Meissonier (London: Low, 1882), 6: "It is not derogatory to the truth and earnestness of [Meissonier's] patriotism that he should now be 'a very good Republican'; although, in the time of the Empire, there is no doubt that he was attached to the dynasty of which every Frenchman, whatever he may choose to say to the contrary, is proud." 117.Jules Claretie, "Les Ruines de l'H6tel-de-Ville-La Salle de Bal," L'Illustration,July 22, 1871, 52. 118.

It was pub- lished on the last page above the game section and cryptogram, with a caption "Pont d'Argenteuil-View taken from the Gennevillers bank" as the only textual amplification. 119. Claretie reported for Le Temps on Eadward Muybridge's presentation at Meissonier's house in 1881; he also visited Meissonier's studio that same year and published his account, which describes The Ruins of the Tuileries, cited in part in Mollett (as in n. 120), 3. 120.

Claretie's interest in Spanish art was evident in his Journies de voyage: Espagne et France (Paris: Alphonse Lemerre, 1870), based on his 1869 trip to Spain, in which he admired Velizquez and Goya, marking out the latter's Desastres as especially powerful. 124.Jules Claretie, "L'HMtel-de-Ville: I," L'Illustration, July 22, 1871, 54-55.
