Sen's Paradox IN HIS 1973 ESSAY "Behavior and the Concept of Preference," Amartya Sen points out the paradoxical attitude of economists toward psychology. Econo- mists tend to believe that economics can be independent of psychological assump- tions. They are suspicious of attempts to analyze economic behavior by asking people about the motivations for their actions, but prefer to look solely at be- havior (Paul Samuelson 1938; Ian Little 1949), or, for those who follow Milton Friedman (1953), solely at aggregate data like prices and quantities. This an- tipsychological attitude underlies the perceived importance of the theory of revealed preference, which reduces pref- erence theory to a set of behavioral propositions. Yet it is so obvious that the assump- tions of economics rely on psychological reasoning for their plausibility. Econo- mists are, for example, very attached to the notion of rational choice, and, as Sen (1993) argues, rationality is a nonsensical concept if it is not motive-related, but only behavioral. Rationality is, by its very nature, a psychological interpretation which we place on behavior that we ob- serve. In the rational-choice approach, when we observe an action, we interpret that action as the result of some motive. The source of this interpretation is exter- nal to the behavior we observe. In fact, in many circumstances, observations of behavior are quite poor (or even mis- leading) data for determining which preferences an individual possesses. Nonbehavioral information, such as ver- bal communication, may be much more revealing of individual motivation, espe- cially when moral considerations domi- nate choice. 1293</page><page sequence="2">1294 Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. XXXIV (September 1996) The inconsistent coexistence of both psychological and antipsychological ideas within the economics discipline is some- what puzzling, and begs some explana- tion. I call this quandary Sen's paradox. In recent years, this paradox has become more visible. We are all familiar with the recent controversy over rational choice, with the criticisms of (mostly experimen- tal) psychologists (cf. Sarah Lichtenstein and Paul Slovic 1971, 1973; David Gre- ther and Charles Plott 1979; Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky 1979; Wil- liam Samuelson and Richard Zeckhauser 1988; Tversky, Shmuel Sattath, and Slovic 1988), and the resulting soul- searching among economists.1 To what extent, we are asking, do microeconomic assumptions need to be psychologically realistic? Can we really be independent of psychology? Economics now faces the daunting task of discovering an effective solution to today's methodological confu- sion. This confusion is difficult to resolve (I submit) partly because today's discus- sions occur in a temporal vacuum, and participants generally lack a good under- standing of the historical roots of today's disagreements. This paper attempts to provide this much needed historical con- text by looking back to the birth of Sen's paradox. It studies a controversy very similar to today's debate, the crisis of he- donism, which occurred near the turn of the century. By studying this earlier his- torical episode, we learn that the debate over psychological assumptions is only a small piece of a much larger intellectual debate that concerns the relationship be- tween economics and the other human sciences, most particularly, with sociol- ogy. Only when we come to terms with this broader context will we be able to understand the real lessons which the economics and psychology debate has to teach us. Sociological influences deeply affect the psychology underlying eco- nomic behavior. Therefore, any serious reevaluation of the psychological under- pinnings of economics requires that careful attention be payed to sociological analyses in our economic investigations. B. Historical Synopsis The early twentieth century was a pe- riod of severe tumult in the economics community.2 Marginal utility theory, then only in its infancy, found itself un- der severe attack, as psychologists ques- tioned its scientific integrity. As in to- day's controversy, some economists joined psychologists in their attack, and attempted to integrate advances in psy- chology into economic theory. These in- stitutionalists used psychological cri- tiques as ammunition for their more fundamental criticisms of the perceived narrowness of orthodox theory. Today's economic sociologists are the intellectual descendants of this movement. Main- stream economists responded mostly by arguing that the criticisms of psycholo- gists were irrelevant. Economics was independent of psychological assump- tions; it spoke only about behavior, which could always be rationalized by some preferences, whatever the actual psychological cause. A behaviorist movement arose in eco- nomics, as theorists attempted to free economics of all psychological elements. 1 See for example The Journal of Business 59(4S), (reprinted as Robin Hogarth and Melvin Reder 1987) which includes the proceedings of a 1985 conference on the behavioral foundations of economic theory. The focus was largely on the dif- ferent attempts by economists to come to terms with experimental results which appeared to fal- sify utility theory. For a more recent analysis see Vernon Smith (1991). Some economists have re- solved the issue by formulating more psychologi- cally realistic theories (cf. Richard Thaler 1991). 2 By the "economics community," I mean here those economists centered in Britain and America. This paper does not attempt to cover the broader economics community, which would include such countries as Austria.</page><page sequence="3">Lewin: Economics and Psychology 1295 This movement contributed to the re- placement of the older theory of cardinal utility, with the new notion of ordinal preferences. Later, the theory of re- vealed preference eliminated the need to interpret even ordinal preferences psy- chologically. Preferences were trans- formed from "metaphysical" entities into scientifically valid, truly empirical ob- jects derived solely from behavior. Despite its bold claims, behaviorist economics failed in two major respects. First, Sen's paradox became increasingly evident as more traditional economists pointed out the folly and impracticability of nonpsychological preference theory. For nonpsychological preference theory to have any scientific rationale, it had to be possible to derive preferences from behavior; only behavior could be ob- served with scientific objectivity, and therefore, an intuitive, psychological foundation for preference theory could play no role. However, actually deriving preferences from behavior turned out to be very difficult,3 and thus, from a be- haviorist perspective, preference theory had little practical use. Second, the eva- sive "declaration of independence" from psychology failed to address the substan- tive and sociological criticisms of psy- chologists and institutionalists; that is, that economics ignored real-world phe- nomena and focused on an overly narrow range of questions with an overly narrow theory of human behavior. Behaviorism in this extreme form eventually lost favor among economists. However, the "decla- ration of independence" from psychology remained, and it haunts economics to this day. C. Primary Theses This paper attempts to accomplish three main goals. 1. Interdisciplinary Pathology Thesis. First, this paper is a study of the way in which the economics discipline interacts with the other human sciences; in par- ticular, with sociology and psychology. Economics has always absorbed ideas from other disciplines. For example, Francis Edgeworth's book Mathematical Psychics definitely dealt with psychologi- cal and sociological questions. However, such interdisciplinary dialogue has not always been as productive as it might be. This paper uncovers a pathological pattern in the relationship between eco- nomics and the other human sciences. It appears that throughout this century, economists have been reluctant to acknowledge the interdependence be- tween economics and its sister disci- plines, particularly sociology and psy- chology. Only under pressure will we acknowledge our dependence, and even then, our attention focuses almost exclu- sively on the psychological shortcomings of economics, rather than on the socio- logical shortcomings which are much more fundamental and difficult to ad- dress. Why economists deemphasize socio- logical issues in their work is a complex question that this paper does not attempt to answer. The strained relationship be- tween economics and sociology has deep historical roots (Richard Swedberg 1987, pp. 31-35) and it continues to this day (James Baron and Michael Hannan 1994). I will also not attempt to argue at length for the relevance to sociology to economics. Good arguments for this po- sition can be found in Swedberg (1987, 1990) and Baron and Hannan (1994). Whenever two disciplines are related as closely as economics and sociology are, opportunities for synergy are bound to exist. When we ignore these opportuni- ties, scientific progress is thwarted. When we seize them, we make scientific progress, as have Herbert Simon (1947), 3 For more on this point, see the discussion of Houthakker (1961) in Section V.C. below.</page><page sequence="4">1296 Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. XXXIV (September 1996) Becker (1976), George Akerlof (1984), and other economists who have recog- nized the potential of interdisciplinary research. Rather than lingering on the benefits or drawbacks of a sociological econom- ics, this paper begins with the presump- tion that interdisciplinary research is good for science. It then draws attention to the pathology which has prevented this sort of research from flourishing in economics, in the hope that if we under- stand this pathology, we may be able to escape it. Our thesis is the following: Economists tend to downplay the rele- vance (to economics) of the other human sciences. In particular, we tend to ignore outside criticism. When we do take note of it, we pay attention solely to that com- ing from psychology. The critics of eco- nomics encourage this pattern by focus- ing on psychological issues, even when their main points of contention are so- ciological.4 As Mark Granovetter (1985, p. 75) writes, The notion that rational choice is derailed by social influences had long discouraged de- tailed sociological analysis of economic life and led revisionist economists to reform eco- nomic theory by focusing on its naive psy- chology. My claim here is that however naive that psychology may be, this is not where the main difficulty lies-it is rather in the neglect of social structure. The result of this interaction is coun- terproductive. Exclusive attention to psy- chology distracts us from social scientific issues. Worse yet, it may tie the hands of those economists who wish to take on the sociological challenge. For example, in the heyday of behaviorism, economists were discouraged from responding to their institutionalist critics by formulat- ing more sociologically realistic theories, because such theorizing necessitated ex- actly the sort of psychological language which these very critics so avidly at- tacked. Uncovering a past expression of this pathology might help us to avoid a repetition of past mistakes, so that the relationship between economics, and so- ciology and psychology, might become less pathological and more productive. 2. Antibehaviorist Thesis. Second, this paper explores the history behind Sen's paradox, described above. It describes how behaviorist ideas first entered eco- nomics, and it uses this period of intel- lectual history to illustrate the folly of re- nouncing verstehen (defined in Section II.B.2) and attempting to rid economics of psychology. In contrast with those economists who reject verstehen as an unscientific remnant of the past, we ar- gue that, in fact, verstehen is an essential foundation for social scientific endeavor, especially for the theory of preference, or rational choice. The story that follows illustrates the wisdom of embracing the differences between the human and physical sciences, rather than attempt- ing, naively, to apply a single mecha- nistic methodology to both. 3. An Historical Journey. Finally, this paper relates an exciting piece of intel- lectual history which is interesting in its own right. We alternate between telling the story, and discussing its relevance to the two main theses described above. II. Historical Background The mushrooming of criticism against economics near the turn of the century was a product of two historical develop- ments: the rise of marginal utility theory, and the rise of instinct theory in psychol- ogy, which we discuss later in Section III.A. Section II.A below reviews the marginal utility revolution. Then Section II.1B describes the methodological con- 4A notable recent example is Amitai Etzioni's 1988 book The Moral Dimension, which aims to be a sociological critique of economics, but which de- votes most of its energy to a discussion of the work of such psychologists as Tversky and Kahneman.</page><page sequence="5">Lewin: Economics and Psychology 1297 text in which this revolution occurred, and sets the stage for the imminent at- tack from psychology. A. The Marginal Utilitarians Prior to the late nineteenth century, economics had been dominated by the Ricardian school of classical economics, which explained price determination by emphasizing objective factors such as technological costs. A close relation of classical economics was the Benthamite school of social theory, which empha- sized, by contrast, the importance of sub- jective factors in determining social phe- nomena. Late in the nineteenth century, the classical school lost favor, and a new group of economists, among them Wil- liam Stanley Jevons, Leon Walras, and Francis Edgeworth, incorporated the Benthamite emphasis into their new marginal utility approach to economics, uniting the two British schools. Jeremy Bentham himself used the con- cept of a hedonic calculus as the founda- tion of his social theory. He wrote that "Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure." This calculus of pain and pleasure was all-inclusive. "It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as what we shall do . . . They govern us in all we do, in all we say, in all we think" (Bentham 1789, p. 1). Bentham even recognized that people might be nonselfish if they were "to some extent interested in the happiness of others" (Jacob Viner 1949, p. 312). It must be emphasized that for Bentham as for his followers, utility was a psychologi- cal (or physiological) magnitude which measured an individual's inner happi- ness; it was not, as it is in many modern texts, simply a proxy for the degree to which an individual has reached what- ever goals he seeks. Jevons, Walras, Edgeworth, and the other marginal utilitarians (as Wesley Clair Mitchell was wont to call them) re- formulated Bentham's approach in mathematical terms, so that utility be- came an explicit quantity. Jevons, in par- ticular, emphasized his debt to Bentham. For their mathematics, the marginal utilitarians drew from physics, and in fact, they formulated their theory explic- itly in emulation of concurrent develop- ments in energetics (Philip Mirowski 1988, pp. 13-15). Utility, marginal utility (motive), and consumption corresponded respectively to energy, force, and posi- tion. Literally like a force, marginal util- ity drew people toward more appropriate consumption options, just as a gravita- tional or magnetic forcefield drew a par- ticle from one position to another. It must be emphasized that, like Bentham, Jevons (1879) and Edgeworth (1881) considered utility to be a real psychologi- cal (or physiological) substance, and Jevons (1879, pp. 63ff) actually devotes some space to an elucidation of the units in which utility and marginal utility ought to be measured. From the per- spective of the marginal utilitarians, the theory of utility transformed economics into a science by making it possible to derive economic laws from a single fun- damental law of human nature-the law of maximum utility. This transition to a new, subjectivist economics occurred over the objections of classical economists such as J. S. Mill (Neil de Marchi 1973, p. 84), who ar- gued that the notation of marginal utility theory implied "the existence of greater precision in the data than the questions would admit of' and who preferred to re- strict quantitative analysis to quantities and prices, which could actually be mea- sured. B. The Old Methodology To understand the debate that ensued, one must understand the methodological</page><page sequence="6">1298 Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. XXXIV (September 1996) context in which marginal utility theory was born. 1. Verificationism. In the late nine- teenth century, the reigning methodol- ogy in economics was that of a priori-ism and verificationism (both defined be- low). John Neville Keynes' 1890 book The Scope and Method of Political Econ- omy is perhaps the best summary of this approach. For Keynes, economics was a deductive science, rather than an induc- tive one. Its fundamental principles were a priori; i.e., they were derived prior to and independently of empirical observa- tion. Economics derived its laws from "a few simple and indisputable facts of hu- man nature" (p. 14) such as the desire for wealth. Because they arose from de- duction, these laws did not have the cer- tainty of laws of physics, but were "only true hypothetically, that is, in the ab- sence of counteracting agencies" (p. 16). Therefore, it was impossible in practice to test economic theory empirically. If one found a counter-example, this was merely an indication that the law did not apply to the situation at hand. Instead of testing one's theory (making it vulner- able tofalsification), one sought empiri- cal instances that verified the theory, thus the term verificationism. William Baumol (1985, p. 1) notes that the economists of the late nineteenth cen- tury (with the important exception of the historical school) made "virtually no sys- tematic use of history" or statistics. The economics of this period did not aspire to be a universal social science. However desirable such a science would be, wrote Keynes, we are unfortunately forced "to leave out many circumstances, which are of importance in individual cases, but are nevertheless unimportant when instances are taken in the mass" (1890, p. 15). Alfred Marshall (1890, p. 20) makes a similar statement; for par- ticular applications, economists had to use their common sense and take into ac- count numerous factors which the theory itself ignored. Even Jevons, who, unlike Keynes, thought that economics should emulate physics, "was prepared to hand over to others the study of social and in- stitutional change in order to free pure economic science from such entangle- ments" (Donald Winch 1973, p. 66). Sociological economics found no place in this framework. The narrow scope of late nineteenth century economics con- trasted starkly with the universalism that Benthamite social science had once claimed.5 2. Verstehen. Finally, Keynes, like many social scientists of his time, em- phasized the distinction between me- chanical behavior and human action. The "facts of human nature" on which eco- nomics was based were to be derived, not from direct observation of human behavior, but from "an introspective sur- vey of the operation of those motives by which men are mainly influenced in their economic activities" (Keynes 1890, p. 173, italics added). This notion is closely related to what Max Weber called verstehen.6 Weber ar- gued that, in the social sciences, we can- not perform the controlled experiments that are possible in the physical sciences. However, the social sciences possess something better than experiments: In studying human beings, we have a sig- nificant advantage because we are our- selves human beings, and we can there- fore comprehend the motives behind human behavior directly through our own introspection. This verstehen, or in- tuitive understanding of human motiva- tion, is what distinguishes the human sci- ences from the physical sciences (Weber 5 This narrow scope also contrasts with more re- cent developments in economics (Becker 1976; Akerlof 1984). 6 Actually, the idea of verstehen goes back far- ther than Weber, but Weber's exposition is the most famous. A full discussion of the history of this concept is beyond the scope of this paper.</page><page sequence="7">Lewin: Economics and Psychology 1299 1922, pp. 18-19). Verstehen is of no use in deriving the laws of physics, because we cannot introspect into inanimate ob- jects; we introspect only into ourselves. Like Weber, Keynes also emphasized the importance of motives, but he fo- cused on one particular motive: goal ful- fillment. (Not all motives are teleologi- cal.7) "The differentia of economic laws, as contrasted with purely physical laws, consists in the fact that the former imply voluntary human action" (Keynes 1890, p. 86). Thus, economics was explicitly and unembarrassedly teleological, and this teleology was its hallmark. III. The Attack While economists were increasingly emphasizing the role of conscious ratio- nal choices in their treatises, other human scientists were doing just the opposite, as "several psychologists and biologists, notably William James and Jacques Loeb, began to attach much greater sig- nificance to . . . unlearned acts and re- flexes as keys to psychological explana- tion" (Zenas Clark Dickinson 1919, p. 395). Instinct theory psychologists em- phasized the role of habit and of several fundamental human instincts in deter- mining behavior. Section III.A discusses this challenge to economic theory. Then in Section III.B, we see how institution- alist economists joined in the attack. The focus of this section is on our in- terdisciplinary pathology thesis. We see how the institutionalists focused on psy- chological issues when criticizing main- stream economics, in the hope that at- tention to psychological issues would lead to progress on the institutional (or sociological) front. These hopes would be disappointed, as mainstream econo- mists noticed only the psychological criticisms, and addressed even these in- adequately. A. The Birth of Modern Psychology Although psychological hedonism "had been under the fire of ethical writers for centuries" (Dickinson 1919, p. 395), the rise of instinct theory psychology engen- dered an explosion of attack of such magnitude that economists found it hard to ignore. In his famous 1890 textbook on The Principles of Psychology, William James criticizes psychological hedonism on the following grounds. Psychological hedo- nists such as Alexander Bain (1859) at- tempt to use only one human motive to explain all of human activity (see Keynes, above). Bain does admit that other mo- tives are important, but he prefers to give to that part of the activity exclusively which these feelings [pleasure and pain] prompt the name of "regular outgoings" and "genuine impulses" of the will, and to treat all the rest as mere paradoxes and anomalies, of which nothing rational can be said . . . At bottom, this is only verbal play. (James 1890, p. 555) To James, such an approach is unsci- entific. Instead, scientists ought to take into account all possible "springs of ac- tion" (motives) in their theories, leaving the (teleological) hedonic motive as merely one example (p. 555). Psychological hedonists, James argues, "obey a curiously narrow teleological su- perstition" (p. 551) for they assume with- out foundation that behavior always aims at the goal of maximum pleasure and minimum pain; but behavior is often im- pulsive, not goal-oriented. Later, Wil- liam McDougall (1910) echoed James' earlier criticisms. In an oft-quoted quip, he says that "It would be a libel, not alto- gether devoid of truth, to say that classi- cal political economy was a tissue of false conclusions drawn from false psychologi- 7 The word teleological means here "concerned with goals, final ends, or purposes." The term is often used as a pejorative, partly because of the influence of the ideas discussed in this paper. No pejorative meaning is intended here.</page><page sequence="8">1300 Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. XXXIV (September 1996) cal assumptions" (McDougall 1910, p. 11). Note that, although these criticisms were always directed at psychological he- donism, psychologists were offended not so much by hedonism as by the (narrow) teleology that accompanied it. Even if pleasure and pain were well-defined magnitudes, it would still be unrealistic to model people as so goal-oriented that they always sought the hedonic opti- mum. Economists were hard-pressed to ig- nore this attack from psychology, for their own professed methodology admit- ted the truth of the criticisms. Econo- mists like J. N. Keynes and Marshall acknowledged that economics left out many important motives, but protested that such an omission was unavoidable. It was simply not practicable to include in economic theory the myriad of mo- tives underlying behavior. At this time, there was little discussion of the issue of hedonism among mainstream econo- mists. However, they did quietly tone down their language, eliminating explic- itly hedonistic language that might spark criticism. As Mitchell (1916) notes, In the later editions of his Principles,8 Dr. Marshall changed utility "or pleasure" to util- ity "or benefit," defined consumer's rent as "surplus satisfaction" instead of "surplus pleasure," dropped his reference to Ben- tham's treatment of the propinquity and cer- tainty of pleasures, and inserted a note con- testing "the belief that economists are adherents of the philosophical system of He- donism or Utilitarianism." (pp. 144-45) B. The Institutionalist Critique Although most late nineteenth century economists rejected the critiques of psy- chologists, a small group avidly joined in the attack and used it as a foundation for their own institutionalist, empirical brand of economics.9 Institutionalists such as Simon Patten (1889, 1893), Ar- thur Hadley (1894), Thorstein Veblen (1898, 1909, 1914), Ezekiel Henry Downey (1910), Mitchell (1910), Frank Fetter (1916), Carleton Parker (1920), and Rexford Tugwell (1922) all empha- sized the importance of instinct theory psychology for economics and developed the critiques of James and McDougall. Some writers, most notably Patten (1889), Veblen (1904, 1914), and Parker (1920), actually wrote treatises in which they used instinct theory to explain eco- nomic phenomena. The mission of this school went far be- yond the application of instinct theory. In fact, we do well to distinguish be- tween two different critiques: (1) institu- tionalist and (2) psychological. Veblen saw the psychological critique of stan- dard economics as a springboard for his more important campaign for the in- creased study of economic institutions and evolutionary change, rather than the formulation of more and more (as he saw it) metaphysical, static economic theo- ries with no empirical content. Thus, in Hadley (1894) and Veblen (1898, 1909), and especially in Downey (1910) and Mitchell (1910), we see an argument for the application of instinct theory to eco- nomics, and simultaneously one for a greater emphasis on the evolution of in- stitutions and the social embeddedness of economic activity. Downey (1910), in particular, argues that utility theory has taught us nothing about price determina- tion. Elementary human nature may (or may not) be uniform, but it functions through institu- tions, and these are not uniform. The behav- 8 These changes occurred in the third (1895) and fifth (1907) editions. 9 In this paper, I use the word "institutionalist" quite broadly, to denote a school of thought within economics. Members of this school were unified by their emphasis on economic institutions and the embeddedness of human behavior in society. They also tended to view instinct theory favorably, so that economists who used instinct theory felt an allegiance to this school, along with those whose main focus was more literally institutionalist.</page><page sequence="9">Lewin: Economics and Psychology 1301 ior of men can be neither predicted nor un- derstood apart from their habitual modes of thought and from the institutional situation in which they act. It is not surprising, therefore, that a century and a quarter of diligent re- search into "labor-pain," "abstinence," "mar- ginal utility," and the like, should have con- tributed substantially nothing to "the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men." (p. 268) Even the notably noninstitutionalist economist George Stigler agreed with Downey that turn of the century utility theory had failed to find applications. Stigler (1972) writes, utility was not a part of the working equip- ment of economists during this period [1893- 1923]. An economist working on taxes or trade or labor or the like did not introduce utility functions into his analysis and use them as a method of developing his subject. This absence of utility theory from theoreti- cal work devoted to other subjects persisted for another two decades: not a single article in the American Economic Review of 1940 used utility theory in any fashion. (pp. 82-83) Like many current critics of prefer- ence theory (cf. Etzioni and Paul Lawrence 1991; Albert Hirschman 1984; Kahneman, Jack Knetsch, and Richard Thaler 1986; Simon 1986; Michael Slote 1989), institutionalists argued that by fo- cusing solely on the marginal utility cal- culus, economics had become overly nar- row and now neglected many important causes of behavior (cf. Veblen 1909; Mitchell 1910; John Maurice Clark 1918). It had lost touch with the world, for it ignored the institutional, social context in which economic behavior oc- curred. By contrast, institutionalists ap- proached real, sociologically complex economic questions with vigor. For ex- ample, in his 1917 paper "The I.W.W." (Industrial Workers of the World), Parker examines the causes of radical syndicalism, a movement which was hav- ing a damaging effect on American in- dustry at the time. Rather than taking workers' motivations as given and un- changeable as a mainstream economists would have done, Parker explores the so- cioeconomic conditions which contrib- uted to the feelings of disenchantment and disenfranchisement that charac- terized I.W.W. members. He suggests that, to alleviate industrial unrest, soci- ety must attack its root cause: the de- plorable social conditions of day labor- ers. Mainstream economists generally con- sidered the arguments of institutionalists like Downey to be irrelevant. Even Mar- shall, who was more sympathetic to insti- tutionalist concerns than most of his mainstream contemporaries, argued that economists can ignore most institutional issues because, in the long run, they are not important. Although customs often seem to be the underlying cause of eco- nomic behavior, this appearance is mis- leading because these customs owe their very continuity to their efficiency: even in such a country as India no custom retains its hold long after the relative posi- tions of the motives of supply and demand have so changed, that the values, which would bring them into stable equilibrium, are far removed from those which the custom sanctions. (Marshall 1885, p. 48) The second, psychological critique did, however, elicit a more substantial (though problematic) response from the mainstream. It was argued that the tele- ological nature of utility theory rendered it unscientific. Veblen's (1909) argument is best said in his own words. Speaking of utility theory, he notes that the theory is confined to the ground of suffi- cient reason instead of proceeding on the ground of sufficient cause . . . the immedi- ate consequence is that the resulting eco- nomic theory is of a teleological character . .. instead of being drawn in terms of cause and effect.... The relation of sufficient reason runs only from the (apprehended) future into the present, and it is solely of an intellectual, subjective, personal, teleological character and force; while the relation of cause and ef-</page><page sequence="10">1302 Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. XXXIV (September 1996) fect runs only in the contrary direction, and it is solely of an objective, impersonal, material- istic character and force. The modern scheme of knowledge [Science], on the whole, rests, for its definitive ground, on the relation of cause and effect; the relation of sufficient reason being admitted only provisionally and as a proximate factor in the analysis, always with the unambiguous reservation that the analysis must ultimately come to rest in terms of cause and effect. (p. 624) Veblen admits that "the relation of suffi- cient reason enters very substantially into human conduct" (p. 625). However, "it is at the same time no less true that human conduct, economic or otherwise, is subject to the sequence of cause and effect, by force of such elements as ha- bituation and conventional require- ments" (p. 626). These factors, rather than the teleological factor, are more im- portant in scientific inquiry, argues Veblen, and by limiting itself to suffi- cient reason alone, economics makes such inquiry impossible. Veblen appar- ently viewed teleology as the root cause behind the narrowness of standard eco- nomics, which was his primary con- cern. If economists gave up teleology, he mistakenly hoped, they would pay more attention to real, institutional ques- tions. Like their counterparts today,10 the mainstream economists of the early twentieth century reacted to this sort of criticism by arguing that economic the- ory was not so narrow as its critics had claimed. Consider, for example, Henry Stuart's 1895 article on the "Hedonistic Interpretation of Subjective Value." Stu- art agrees with Hadley (1894) and others that psychological hedonism is flawed. However, it does not follow that eco- nomic theory is itself faulty, for, he ar- gues, this theory does not rely in any es- sential way on psychological hedonism (or on teleology). Human behavior, Stu- art agrees, is not determined by the de- sire for pleasure. Instead, people seek objects; they have goals, which they pur- sue both consciously and unconsciously. When a person achieves a particular goal, such as food to satisfy hunger, her desire for a particular good becomes sati- ated, and she demands no more. This, he argues, is the behavioral foundation for the principle of diminishing utility; psy- chological hedonism itself plays no role. Furthermore, economics does not claim to say anything about the nature or ori- gin of the goals which people seek, and it does not assume teleologically that these goals are rational and yield individuals maximal utility. In many cases the minimum of consumption may in a manner be prescribed by society, or may be fixed for the individual by custom, the real extent of whose influence upon him the individual may be utterly unconscious of; but the fact remains that increments of the com- modity in question, in excess of the mini- mum, suffer, in these as in all cases, a pro- gressive depreciation. Our desire for a certain thing may be from the point of view of some one else, utterly irrational. But it is none the less a desire because it is irrational or even habitual, and, as a desire, it is subject to the same inevitable law which all other desires obey. (Stuart 1895, p. 78) Over time, more and more economists expressed similar positions. Joseph Schumpeter (1908), Philip Wicksteed (1910, pp. 434-35), Sydney Chapman (1911), Herbert Davenport (1902, 1913), and Hubert Henderson (1922) all de- clared that economics was independent of psychological assumptions, that it was interested only in facts of choice and 10 For example, Stigler and Becker (1977) argue that, when applied creatively, preference theory can explain a surprisingly wide range of phenom- ena. To sup port this view, they provide models of addiction, advertising, and fashion, all of which are often used as evidence against economic theory, and as evidence for the malleability of tastes. They claim that by applying preference theory in this way, economists can free themselves of any need to turn to other disciplines (such as psychology, anthropology, or sociology) for guidance on the causes of preference formation and change.</page><page sequence="11">Lewin: Economics and Psychology 1303 made no assumptions as to the exact mo- tivation behind these choices. Ironically, Veblen's criticism that economic theory was teleological would become the basis for arguments from the mainstream that there was really nothing wrong with eco- nomic theory, and that economists did not need to change their research agenda as Veblen had argued they should. The second institutionalist cri- tique would divert attention away from the first, more fundamental one. Institutionalists reacted to this per- ceived cooption of their movement with irritation. Economists were simply gen- eralizing their theory so as to make it meaningless and irrefutable.11 Downey (1910, p. 259) writes Some adherents of the marginal-utility school insist that the whole issue between hedonists and anti-hedonists is irrelevant to value the- ory. Admitting that marginal utilitarians usu- ally have been hedonists they deny that the marginal-utility doctrines stand or fall with hedonism. Those who take this position . . . assert that economics is concerned only with the fact of choice between goods or between alternative activities, and not with the basis of choice. However, Downey argues, this "dis- avowal of hedonism [deprives] marginal- utility economics of its whole content." The theory becomes reduced to a state- ment that people choose what they want, and want what they choose. Such circu- larities do not in any way advance our understanding of the economy. It would be much more useful to replace the en- tire theory with one that possessed "a psychologically tenable analysis of the process of individual valuation" (p. 253). For, Downey argues, if choices are really made between goods and not between the "utilities" represented by the goods, why talk of "utility" at all? And if it be admitted that economic choice is more fre- quently the outcome of habit, suggestion, and the like, than of a rationalistic weighing of alternative gratifications, the marginal-utility analysis of price loses all its significance. Davenport (1913, pp. 97-102) re- sponds to this criticism, but not very sat- isfactorily. Whatever an individual does, this behavior will be consistent with some preferences because, whatever an individual's motives are, rational or im- pulsive as they may be, "it is still true that men do choose" (p. 100). Thus, Dav- enport explicitly acknowledges that choice-based utility theory is tautological (as Downey asserts it is). "Rightly under- stood,-utility meaning merely the fact that a thing is wanted,-the marginal utility doctrine is almost an axiom" (p. 102). The claim that utility theory was inde- pendent of teleology appears particularly weak when we notice the purely rhetori- cal nature of most of these claims. They were not accompanied by any substan- tive changes in theoretical approach, but were simply used to defend existing the- ory, unrevised. (Cardinal utility contin- ued to be used.) In fact, the same people who argued for the independence of the principle of diminishing utility from psy- chological hedonism would often also, in the same work, use explicitly hedonistic language in their nonmathematical, heu- ristic expositions (cf. Wicksteed 1910, ch. 1; Marshall 1920). As Downey inti- mates, giving up psychological hedonism was not so easy, for in doing so, econo- mists had to give up the very reasoning that made their choice-based analyses in- tuitively plausible. More importantly, economists who professedly adopted a choice-based ap- proach hardly bothered to attempt any explanations of any real choices that peo- ple actually made. Moreover, they did not attempt to answer the instutitionalist critique, by using the choice-based ap- proach to model sociologically complex 11 For similar recent arguments, see James March (1978, p. 155) and Simon (1986, p. 222).</page><page sequence="12">1304 Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. XXXIV (September 1996) economic behavior. Even if these econo- mists claimed that the new approach could take into account diverse motives, they did not provide any concrete evi- dence for this claim. As Stigler (1950) notes, economists resisted attempts to add new elements to utility theory, in spite of the ability of these elements to make the theory more realistic. Rather than actively exploring the world they lived in, they theorized from an arm- chair. Economists, argues Stigler, should have insisted "that theories be examined for their implications for observable be- havior, and these specific implications compared with observable behavior" (p. 395); but they did not do so. Not only were such specific implications ["The implication of the diminishing mar- ginal utility of money, that people will not gamble. . ."] not sought [out] and tested, but there was a tendency, when there appeared to be the threat of an empirical test, to reformulate the theory to make the test ineffective. Thus, when it was suggested that there might be increasing marginal utility from good music, as one acquired a taste for it, this was interpreted as a change in the utility function.2.. . they did not anxiously seek the challenge of the facts. (p. 395)13 As a result, utility theory remained al- most useless to economists who analyzed actual data. IV. The Rise of Behaviorism Like the mainstream economists men- tioned above, some institutionalists also argued that economics should be founded on behavior rather than on (teleological) psychological hedonism; but these institutionalists argued that in- dependence of psychological hedonism in no way implies independence of psy- chology proper. Rather, economics should employ the methods of behavior- ist psychology, which was just then be- ginning its rise to prominence. Behaviorism was part of a general philosophical movement to eliminate the "soft science" characteristics which had heretofore distinguished the human sci- ences from the physical sciences. One casualty of this movement would be ver- stehen. Thus, our focus shifts to the sec- ond, antibehaviorist thesis of this paper, which concerns the negative conse- quences of attempting to transform eco- nomics into a mechanistic, nonpsy- chological science. Section IV.A explains how behaviorist methodology introduced a new element into the debate over psy- chological hedonism and teleology. Then in Section IV.B, we study the influence of this movement on mainstream eco- nomic theory. A. The New Methodology Prior to this time, psychology, like economics, had relied a great deal on in- trospection. One must remember that hedonistic psychology was, after all, a movement in psychology as well as an element in economics. Even instinct theorists, who were so critical of the per- ceived methodological crimes of econo- mists, themselves employed introspec- tion when they enumerated the basic instincts that determined behavior. Theirs was merely a more inclusive in- trospection. Early twentieth century psy- 12 In 1977, Stigler would take on this issue. Stigler and Becker (1977) provide a model of "ad- diction" to good music. The model uses the con- cept of "consumption capital" to explain increasing marginal utility rom good music using a fixed util- ity function. 13 Note the ironic similarity between Stigler's comments and Simon (1986, p. S222), who writes, in criticism of economists such as Stigler, "Neo- classical economists . . . are prepared to make whatever auxiliary empirical assumptions are nec- essary in order to preserve the utility-maximiza- tion postulate, even when the empirical assump- tions are unverified. When verification is de- manded, they tend to look for evidence that the theory makes correct predictions and resist advice that they should look instead directly at the deci- sion mechanisms and processes."</page><page sequence="13">Lewin: Economics and Psychology 1305 chologists reacted against this a priori method. In his famous 1913 paper, John Watson laments the current state of psy- chology. Psychology, as it is generally thought of, has something esoteric in its methods. If you fail to reproduce my findings, it is not due to some fault in your apparatus or in the control of your stimulus, but it is due to the fact that your introspection is untrained. (p. 163) Disputes, Watson argues, are irresolv- able unless scientists can base their theo- ries on objective rather than subjective data. Therefore, psychology must be re- formulated so that it simply studies the laws of behavior, without discussing such vague concepts as "consciousness." By becoming behaviorist, psychology can fi- nally attain the empirical rigor of the natural sciences. By emulating the empirical methods of physics, behaviorists were proposing something quite radical. Prior to this time, the predominant methodological approach in the human sciences had been verstehen, which emphasized the differences between the physical and hu- man sciences. By contrast, behaviorists argued that there was only one correct method of science, which should be em- ployed universally. McDougall, an adher- ent of the older, instinct school, opposed this philosophy and defended verstehen. He notes (1926, p. 370) that due to the success of physical science, there obtains very widely at the present time the opinion that we understand mechanical process in some more intimate sense than we can understand appetitive process; and that therefore, it is the business of all science to explain its facts in terms of the laws of mech- anism, and that all appetitive processes can only be rendered intelligible if they can be reduced to the mechanical type. But this is a delusion. Of the two types of process, we cer- tainly understand the appetitive more inti- mately than the mechanical; for we directly experience appetition, we have an inside ac- quaintance with it ... Watson's methodological attitude was representative of the logical positivist methodological atmosphere which pre- vailed among the scientists of the early twentieth century. According to logical positivism, science does not seek to help us to understand the nature of reality; that is the domain of metaphysics (a pe- jorative term). Understanding is, accord- ing to this view, a meaningless pursuit. The world simply consists of.observable empirical regularities, and science should therefore restrict itself to describ- ing these, in the form of objective, falsi- fiable propositions. Every scientific con- cept and theory should have a clear empirical meaning; no ambiguity can be tolerated. Therefore, psychology should restrict itself to describing the behavior of individuals under different conditions. Such concepts as conscious- ness, or thought (rational or irra- tional), are too vague to be of scientific value. Among economists, the foremost pro- ponent of logical positivism was Terence Hutchison. In his widely read 1938 book The Significance and Basic Postulates of Economic Theory, he argued against the verificationist methodology that had been prevalent in economics, and for- mally introduced Popper's concept of falsificationism into economics. Hutchi- son makes a fundamental distinction be- tween propositions of pure theory and scientific propositions. Propositions of pure theory are generally tautological; they are derived logically from defini- tions, and as such are analogous to mathematical theorems. However, in or- der for a proposition to qualify as scien- tific, it must say something about the real world, and be falsifiable by some conceivable observation of this world. Therefore, if economics is to be a sci- ence, then we must transform the tauto- logical propositions of pure theory into falsifiable scientific propositions, by as-</page><page sequence="14">1306 Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. XXXIV (September 1996) signing precise empirical meanings to all theoretical concepts. Hutchison criticizes the tendency of economists to evade tests of their theo- ries. If an observation seems to contra- dict the proposition, say, that demand declines when the price of a good rises, then economists usually blame some ex- traneous cause.14 When the price rises, demand declines, but only ceteris pari- bus-assuming that nothing else impor- tant changes and thus reverses the cau- sality. By making such arguments, economists render their propositions tautological. no attempt is made, usually, to indicate under what conditions they are true and under what false, and the meaning of the vital qualifica- tion "ceteris paribus" is left hopelessly impre- cise. The ceteris paribus assumption, just as much as any other, must be precisely formu- lated if the propositions it qualifies are to have any clear meaning. The intention of the assumption obviously is to lessen the falsifi- ability of the too often falsified generalization "If the price of a good rises, the amount sold declines." But exactly how far is its falsifiabil- ity thus lessened, and if it remains an em- pirical proposition, what conceivable pos- sibilities of falsification remain? (p. 41, boldface added) From this perspective, Hutchison criticizes the antiempirical nature of marginal utility theory. The law of maxi- mum utility and Gossen's law of dimin- ishing utility are generally derived from a priori assumption or from introspec- tion. These assumptions have come un- der attack. He cites Benham, who wrote in 1930 that Gossen's law was "at best an unproved hypothesis, obtained by an amateur incursion into the domain of psychology" (Hutchison 1938, p. 134). Economists are at a loss to respond, Hutchison argues; they cannot appeal to any empirical data, for utility theory has no empirical content. If economists want their propositions to qualify as science, and if they wish not to be vulnerable to attack, then they must reformulate their theories so that they say something about "how people do in fact behave" (p. 134). Hutchison emphasizes, in contrast to more extreme behaviorists, that concepts such as utility, or even social utility, are not inherently unscientific; they have merely been so in practice. They will be- come scientific if and only if we choose to make them so, by giving them precise empirical (behavioral) meanings. Many institutionalists adopted the logical positivist philosophy, and it proved an effective weapon in their at- tack on economic orthodoxy (although, in the long run, it proved counterproduc- tive). Hadley (1894), Downey (1910), Tugwell (1922, 1924b), Sargant Florence (1927), and Morris Copeland (1931) all criticize the antiempirical nature of mainstream economics. Thus, Hadley (1894) argues that "Nearly all the con- clusions of the Austrian [marginal utility] school of economics are framed in such language that nobody could ever find out, by observation of prices, whether they were right or wrong" (p. 260). Florence (1927, pp. 86-89) laments the decline in the use of induction since the time of Malthus. Downey (1910, p. 268) uses stronger language. "Marginal-utility economics is an admirable body of dia- lectics-scarcely surpassed for subtlety, reach, and want of content by the finest products of medieval scholasticism . . ." At the root of the problem was the tendency of economists to explain phe- nomena by appealing to unobservable psychological magnitudes such as utility. Hadley (1894) argues (echoing J. S. Mill) that by speaking of utility as an exact mathematical quantity, economics "gives an appearance of definiteness to things which are extremely uncertain" (p. 254). 14 Note the similarity to Watson's disdain for psychologists who, when faced with results that fail to reproduce their own findings, blame the re- sults on untrained introspection.</page><page sequence="15">Lewin: Economics and Psychology 1307 However, Hadley argues (citing Patten), the utility concept does not possess the definiteness assigned to it by theory, for all sorts of problems plague any at- tempt to pin this utility down, or to ver- ify that people in fact maximize this quantity. Rather than playing metaphysical games, Copeland (1931) suggests, econo- mists should formulate "specific socio- historical theories" (p. 70) which can be tested empirically. They should adopt a realistic, sociological approach and study the economy as it is: embedded in social institutions. As an example of this ap- proach, he cites Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class. He recognizes that econo- mists want to do more than enumerate empirical regularities; they want to un- derstand the underlying cause of a phe- nomenon. However, Copeland argues, "Physicists long ago left the search for ultimate causes to metaphysics. Econo- mists would do well to follow suit" (p. 70). Given this background, we return to the main issue, the critique of declara- tions of independence from psychology. Tugwell (1922) notes that economists have become increasingly aware of the criticisms that have been launched against such concepts as utility. "There has resulted a searching of souls among teachers and writers" (p. 321). The most common response has been "to deny that economics necessarily has foundations in human nature at all" (p. 321). However, as Florence (1927) points out, such dec- larations of independence have been in- sincere. Citing Henderson (1922) as an example, Florence notes that Henderson does not practice what he preaches, in fact cannot practice what he preaches. Throughout his book the reasoning is deductive, and he deduces his conclusions from psychological assumptions; he cannot therefore argue without assuming some sort of psychological theory. (p. 54) If economists think that they can be independent of psychology and also independent of a priori assumptions, then they are fooling themselves. They must get their assumptions from some- where. Tugwell (1922) argues that the atti- tude of economists toward psychology results from a misunderstanding. If it is true, as some people think, that psychol- ogy is a subjective science, then in order to free itself of subjective concepts, eco- nomics must free itself from psychology. However, "this is precisely the weakness behaviorists object to and the root of their departure from the older forms of psychology" (p. 330). If economists are to formulate a new economics, free of the a priori assumptions that have plagued previous theory, then what but behaviorist psychology can provide a sound foundation for the new theory? Perhaps economists can avoid psychology and at the same time be scientific, but only by limiting themselves to describing the regularities of prices and quantities (p. 322). Most economists aspire to do more; they want to explain where these prices come from, and for this task, be- haviorist psychology is indispensable. B. "Behaviorist" Mainstream Economics Until now, the mainstream economic arguments we have considered have been relatively straightforward and even familiar. However, the mainstream re- sponse to behaviorism and logical posi- tivism was far more complex. Near the turn of the century, many economists did at least nominally re- nounce psychological hedonism and ar- gue that utility theory could be based on choice behavior alone. However, as we saw above, the arguments of Hadley, Davenport, Marshall, and others indicate that most of these economists (ostensi- bly) rejected psychological hedonism, not out of any inner conviction that</page><page sequence="16">1308 Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. XXXIV (September 1996) choice-based analysis was more scien- tific, but simply in order to defend exist- ing theory from attack. It appears that, at some point, the situation changed and the logical positivist critique of marginal utility theory truly became internalized by the profession. Slowly, the hedonistic discussions that had once been so com- mon in textbooks disappeared, as Mar- shall was supplanted by the likes of John Hicks and Paul Samuelson. In a 1938 ar- ticle called "The End of the Marginal Utility Theory?," Harro Bernadelli notes that more and more people have come to believe that the marginal utility concept is unscientific; whereas originally this opinion has been voiced only by writers who did not belong to the camp of marginal utility theorists, by out- siders so to speak whose anti-mathematical bias made them blind to the success the mar- ginal utility theory could claim in all branches of economic inquiry, lately a complete change in the situation has taken place. The argu- ment has found its way into the friend's camp itself . .. Weighty mathematical reasons have made them doubt that marginal utility is a legitimate concept. No longer can the argu- ment be brushed aside as irrelevant preju- dice, the crisis has developed from within. (p. 192, italics added) 1. Ordinalism. This movement "from within" dates back to the efforts of Irving Fisher (1892) and Vilfredo Pareto (1900, 1901, 1906, 1911) to replace the concept of measurable (cardinal) utility with that of ordinal preferences.15 They realized that, if we take as our data only the choice behavior of individuals, then the cardinal utility function is not well de- fined. In other words, the behavior of an individual does not determine that indi- vidual's utility function uniquely, not even up to a linear transformation, be- cause any monotone transformation of a given utility function predicts an individ- ual's choices just as well. Only the order in which options are ranked is deter- mined uniquely. Pareto proposed that a choice-based ordinal utility function be adopted precisely because he was con- cerned that one could not measure utility as a precise psychological quantity. In a letter to Benedetto Croce, he writes (1900, p. 183) "I was worried about that pleasure and that pain which had to be measured, because in reality, nobody is capable of measuring pleasure. Who can say what pleasure is double another pleasure?" Thus, in his 1906 Manuale, al- though Pareto does talk of "pleasure," he does so in such a way as to avoid imply- ing that this pleasure is a well-defined numerical quantity. Just as Watson hoped that behaviorism would bring psychology into the natural sciences, Pareto hoped that ordinalism would forge economics into a science on a par with physics. This entire theory . . . rests on no more than a fact of experience, that is, on the determi- nation of the quantities of goods which con- stitute combinations between which the indi- vidual is indifferent . . . The theory of economic science thus acquires the rigor of 15 By "measurable" utility, I mean here the proposition that the utility function can be deter- mined uniquely up to a linear transformation. Thus, measurability and cardinal utility were viewed as equivalent concepts. In modern usage, the terms are somewhat different. Today, "mea- surable" utility is sometimes used to mean utility that can be measured psychologically. Cardinality of a utility function, however, is simply the mathe- matical property of uniqueness up to a linear transformation. Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions and time-discounted utility functions are two examples of this cardinality. When the von Neumann-Morgenstern axiomatization of expected utility was published, there was some discussion about whether the authors had resurrected mea- surability from its prior disrepute. A consensus was then reached that cardinality and measur- ability (in the above sense) were different con- cepts, and that the former in no way implied the latter. In the period that we are studying in this paper, this clear distinction did not yet exist, and cardinality was believed to be equivalent to mea- surability. The approach of these older economists was not necessarily wrong. Whether today's sharp distinction between cardinality and measurability makes psychological sense remains debatable.</page><page sequence="17">Lewin: Economics and Psychology 1309 rational mechanics; it deduces its results from experience, without bringing in any meta- physical entity. (1906, p. 113) For Pareto, ordinal preferences did not require any psychological interpretation; they merely summarized empirical regu- larities of choice behavior. We noted earlier that the marginal utilitarians viewed utility and marginal utility (motive) as the analogs of energy and force in physics. Logical positivist physicists argued that the concept of a force was metaphysical, and that physical laws should enumerate only the equa- tions of motion of bodies. Pareto saw his break with hedonism as analogous to this movement in physics. "[J]n pure eco- nomics there was something which cor- responds to forces in mechanics. Given the fact of choice, that something is no longer there. However, mechanics can be studied leaving aside the concept of forces" (1900, p. 185), and so, Pareto im- plies, can economics be studied leaving aside the concept of motives. Pareto does not mind losing the teleological ra- tionale for consumer theory. "Let others concern themselves with the nature, with the essence of 'value'. I am interested only in seeing whether I can discover which regularities are presented by prices" (1901, p. 204). Thus, a new anal- ogy to physics arose. Physicists would discuss equations of motion, and econo- mists would discuss individual behavioral patterns and demand functions. By argu- ing in this manner, Pareto went farther than other economists, who renounced psychological hedonism and argued that economics makes no assumptions about which particular motives move people to act. Instead, Pareto suggested that the very discussion of motives was unneces- sary and metaphysical. At first, most of the profession ignored Pareto's critique, and his Manuale was the only textbook in the first decades of the century to use the ordinal approach. However, a series of influential papers by Eugene Slutsky, Hicks, Roy Allen, and Paul Samuelson eventually estab- lished ordinalism as the mainstream ap- proach to consumer theory. Like Pareto's Manuale, these papers differ from other declarations of independence in that they propose actual changes in the theory of the consumer rather than mere changes in vocabulary (although even these changes failed to address the first institutionalist critique), and in that the authors are motivated by logical posi- tivist rather than rhetorical concerns. First, Slutsky (1915) reformulated util- ity theory so as to express its implications in terms of prices and quantities, which can be observed. Thus, he provided a theoretical foundation for the transition (discussed above) from a theory based on psychological motives, to one based on individual demand functions. The new formulation would hopefully be more conducive to empirical testing. He moti- vates his paper by arguing that "to place economic science upon a solid basis, we must make it completely independent of psychological assumptions and philo- sophical hypotheses" (p. 28). However, Slutsky was not an extreme behaviorist, and in his paper he does not rule out the possibility that at some point in the fu- ture, the connection between the objec- tive laws of consumer demand and the phenomena of the mind might be ex- plored experimentally. Then, in 1934, Hicks and Allen pub- lished their famous paper, "A Reconsid- eration of the Theory of Value." In this paper they fill in some of the gaps left behind by Pareto's Manuale. Although he believed strongly in ordinalism, Pareto unwittingly allowed cardinalism to sneak its way back into his analysis. First, he made assumptions about the signs of the second derivatives of the utility function and thus retained Gossen's law of diminishing marginal</page><page sequence="18">1310 Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. XXXIV (September 1996) utility; in fact, these signs are not well defined in a choice-based approach.16 Second, his "second postulate" assumed that people could compare the magni- tudes of differences between utility lev- els; this postulate is actually closely re- lated to measurability of the utility function, and Oscar Lange (1934) be- lieved that the two concepts were equivalent. 17 To solve this problem and to assure a complete eradication of cardinal utility (and therefore of psychological hedon- ism), Hicks and Allen (1934) eliminate all discussion of either marginal utilities or second derivatives of the utility func- tion-both of which are not well defined in an ordinalist framework.18 In place of marginal utility they introduce the now standard concept of the "marginal rate of substitution," which is equivalent to the ratio of two marginal utilities in the old cardinalist notation. In the place of Gossen's law they introduce the increas- ing rate of marginal substitution, which basically states that indifference curves are convex to the origin. This new termi- nology quickly became standard in the textbooks of the 1930s (Richard Howey 1973, p. 36). 2. The Difference Between Ordinalism and Behaviorism. Treated historically (in the sense of its place in the history of economic thought) or rhetorically, Hicks and Allen (1934) was clearly part of the antipsychological movement within mainstream economics, and it brought economic theory one step closer to eliminating all psychological ele- ments.19 However, in a purely positive sense, their work was in fact perfectly consistent with what we could call a psy- chological ordinalist (rather than psycho- logical hedonist) perspective. This is the view, commonly held by today's econo- mists (I submit), that one cannot mea- sure utility as a (cardinal) quantity of pleasure, but nevertheless, people do act purposefully and therefore they do have (ordinal) preferences that really mean something psychologically (rather than being ex post rationalizations of behav- ior). The psychological meaning of pref- erences does not involve pleasure, as in psychological hedonism; but this psycho- logical meaning does exist nevertheless. In effect, Hicks and Allen had provided a good foundation for a genuine declara- tion of independence from psychological hedonism, but not from psychology proper. The very plausibility of their theoretical framework still rested on the inherently psychological concept of (or- dinal) utility. For precisely this reason, Paul Sam- uelson (1938) argued that Hicks and Allen (1934) did not go far enough in freeing economics from psychology. Per- haps preference functions were now 16 In a choice-based approach, the signs of the first derivatives of a utility function are defined by whether an individual does or does not desire more of any given good. However, second deriva- tives are not uniquely specified. For example, if there is only one good and an individual desires more of that good, the first derivative of utility is positive for any utility function u, because u must be increasing. However, u" can have any sign at all. 17The discussion in the literature of Pareto's "second postulate" is somewhat confusing be- cause, at least in his Manuale (1906, p. 191), Pareto suggests the use of this postulate but re- jects it because (he thinks) it implies measur- ability. However, others seemed to read Pareto as if he really did adopt the postulate. The essence of Lange's argument for the equiva- lence of Pareto's second postulate and measur- ability, is the following: If we assume that differ- ences between levels of utility can be compared, then we can say not only whether x is better than y, but also how much better x is than y. Is the preference for x over y as strong as the preference or w over z? In an ordinalist approach, we know only whether or not x is better than y. "How much better" has no meaning here; this is a cardinalist concept. Thus, Pareto's second postulate is essen- tially a cardinalist assumption. 18The sign of marginal utility is well defined, but the absolute magnitude is not. 19 Their paper was certainly perceived in this way by contemporaries. See Bernadelli (1935, p. 71).</page><page sequence="19">Lewin: Economics and Psychology 1311 theoretically determined by observable behavior, but what difference does this fact make, asks Samuelson, unless we can actually derive these functions from this behavior, rather than relying on introspection? As a good logical posi- tivist, Samuelson argued that the in- difference concept must have an empiri- cal referent; otherwise, it is meaning- less. It is worth quoting Samuelson at length. The discrediting of utility as a psychological concept robbed it of its only possible virtue as an explanation of human behaviour in other than a circular sense, revealing its emp- tiness as even a construction. As a result, the most modern theory confines itself to an analysis of indifference elements, budgetary equilibrium being defined by equivalence of price ratios to respective indifference slopes. Consistently applied, however, the modern criticism turns back on itself and cuts deeply. For just as we do not claim to know by intro- spection the behaviour of utility, many will argue we cannot know the behaviour of ratios of marginal utilities or of indifference direc- tions. Why should one believe in the increasing rate of marginal substitution, except in so far as it leads to the type of demand functions in the market which seem plausible? ... Hence, despite the fact that the notion of utility has been repudiated or ignored by modern theory, it is clear that much of even the most modern analysis shows vestigial traces of the utility concept. Thus, to any per- son not acquainted with the history of the subject, the exposition of the theory of con- sumer's behaviour in the formulation of Hicks and Allen would seem indirect. The introduction and meaning of the marginal rate of substitution as an entity independent of any psychological, introspective implica- tions would be, to say the least, ambiguous, and would seem an artificial convention in the explanation of price behaviour. (pp. 61- 62) Samuelson proposes "that we start anew in direct attack upon the problem, drop- ping off the last vestiges of the utility analysis" (p. 62). To accomplish this goal, he introduces revealed preference theory.20 This ap- proach allows one to derive indifference curves solely from the observation of purchases in the market. Thus, the the- ory provides the essential link between individual demand functions and prefer- ences. This link is essential because, logical positivists argued, only individual demand functions (or other behavioral patterns) have an objective empirical meaning, and therefore for preferences to have such a meaning, they must be derivable from demand functions. In his paper, Paul Samuelson ex- presses the hope "that the orientation given here is more directly based upon those elements which must be taken as data by economic science" (p. 71). Therefore, when it was first proposed, revealed preference theory was intended as an empirical tool. Samuelson hoped that, by observing enough market choices of an individual, one could test his conformity with preference theory, and if he satisfied the revealed prefer- ence axioms, one could then predict his future behavior. Finally, economics would be completely free of psychology; it would depend only on observable be- havior. V. The Decline of Behaviorism If the Samuelsonian dream had come true, today's microeconomics would be a science as solidly empirical as physics, and we would not have to even trouble ourselves about the importance or unim- 20 Paul Samuelson (1948) develops this ap- proach further, making use of Little (1949), which was, it appears, actualry published earlier. Finally, Houthakker (1950) introduced the "strong axiom of revealed preference," which made revealed preference theory and ordinal utility theory logi- cally equivalent for demand theory. This logical equivalence in no way implies methodological equivalence. The motivation for revealed prefer- ence remained empirical. Ironically, revealed pref- erence attained its apogee of mathematical ele- gance just as the popularity of behaviorism was waning.</page><page sequence="20">1312 Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. XXXIV (September 1996) portance of the realism of our assump- tions. (They would simply be realistic!) Of course, this dream was to be elusive. The behaviorist edifice would slowly crumble, for both empirical and philo- sophical reasons. Section V.A continues our focus on our antibehaviorist thesis. It discusses the dissident voices against behaviorism within mainstream economics. Critics of behaviorism defended verstehen and pointed out its indispensability to eco- nomics. Section V.B lends support to these criticisms, and describes the sti- fling effect of behaviorism, on eco- nomic science in general, and on any po- tential attempt by mainstream economics to address the institutionalist critique, in particular. Here, we shift back to our in- terdisciplinary pathology thesis, and we see the close connection between the two theses. Finally, in Section V.C we encounter the empirical stumbling blocks which placed the final nail in the coffin of behaviorist economics. This section illustrates the extreme difficulty of attempting to derive preferences from objective data alone, and it supports the view that preference theory depends on verstehen for its plausibility. A. In Defense of Verstehen Perhaps the most convincing evidence that behaviorism did in fact become the politically correct21 methodology among mainstream economists, lies in the tenor of the arguments that a few economists made against behaviorism and in defense of verstehen. Such arguments go back to Croce (1900, 1901) who engaged Pareto in debate. Before proceeding, one must understand that, within the rhetoric of the time, cardinal utility was more than a particular theoretical concept; it symbol- ized verstehen. Those who defended verstehen invariably did so within the context of a defense of cardinal utility. Therefore, one should not dismiss the ar- guments which follow simply because they defend the admittedly problematic concept of measurability. They have a broader meaning as well. We will con- sider in detail only the ideas of Harro Bernadelli and Frank Knight, who were particularly outspoken during behavior- ism's height of popularity. Bernadelli was one of the few econo- mists in the 30s who defended the notion of cardinal utility. He therefore de- fended Pareto's second postulate (see Section IV.B.1). This postulate became a symbol of cardinalism, which was itself a symbol of verstehen. In a 1934 article, he criticizes Hicks and Allen (1934) for giving up Pareto's second postulate and Gossen's law, arguing that "the simplest economic reasoning is interwoven with psychological elements, in such a way that their elimination is against common sense" (Bernadelli 1934, p. 71). True, Bernadelli says, for the most part, eco- nomics can do without the second postu- late, but to give it up is similar to the behaviour of a man who cuts off one of his legs, in order to see how he gets on as a cripple. And it is extraordinary how one can get on without the leg of the second postulate, as the results of Pareto, and more recently of Allen and Hicks, prove. Yet this would seem insufficient reason for mak- ing a virtue of such an amputation. (pp. 71- 72) Similarly, Knight (1944) questions whether the arguments against the con- cept of force in physics could be applied against the use of marginal utility in eco- nomics. Early in the history of modern physics [,] ob- jection was raised to use of the concept of force, on the double ground that it is never open to direct observation and that it is not objective but animistic or anthropomorphic. It was (and is) pointed out that we observe or measure only the effects of forces and con- 21 Politically correct, but not necessarily domi- nant. Economists felt pressured to be behaviorists, even if not everyone succumbed to this pressure.</page><page sequence="21">Lewin: Economics and Psychology 1313 tended that it would be simpler and more candid to talk only about effects, i.e., equa- tions of motion . . . The place of motive in economic choice presents a closely parallel problem. (p. 305) Even in mechanics, the arguments against force run into problems, but in the field of conduct, the a fortiori argu- ment for the reality of the force (motive) is irresistibly conclusive. . . . everyone is di- rectly aware of it in his own experience and has the most certain knowledge of its reality in others. . . . Our thinking about conduct must conform to common-sense introspection and intelligible intercommunication, which always runs in terms of "reasons" for action or choice, meaning ends or motives. (p. 307) Knight (1940) criticizes positivists such as Hutchison, who pretend "that knowl- edge of people's minds is an inference, from the observation of their bodies, of their physical behavior" (p. 161). Noth- ing can be further from the truth. "What we immediately, consciously, apprehend is the 'meaning,' and if called upon to reproduce the physical facts we should do so chiefly by 'deduction' from the re- membered meaning, not from any direct recall of sense data" (p. 162). Knight (1944) argues that it is not pos- sible to dispense with motives in explain- ing human conduct, as one can dispense with forces in physics. Whereas it is pos- sible to derive forces from the behavior of physical bodies, it is not possible to derive motives from the behavior of hu- man beings. Among other reasons, "ac- tion rarely leads to exactly the intended result, because it is always affected by error . . ." (p. 310). Therefore, if we wish to understand human conduct, we do much better by using our introspection than by relying on unreliable behavioral data which tells us little about the true underlying causes of what we observe. Knight (1924) agrees that the use of in- trospection prevents economics from be- coming a rigorous science like physics. However, unlike his contemporaries who reacted by renouncing introspection, Knight suggests that economics should not try to emulate physics, for it studies inherently different subject matter for which the (logical positivist) scientific approach is inappropriate. B. The Sterility of Behaviorism Historical developments bore out the arguments of people like Knight; an eco- nomics without verstehen could not ade- quately address the challenges that it faced. Ironically, rather than providing a foundation for a new, solidly scientific economics, behaviorism placed econom- ics in a straightjacket that repressed any constructive response to the first institu- tionalist criticism, which emphasized the narrow scope of economic theory and the neglect of institutional and sociological factors in economic analyses. Eventually, economics would broaden its focus somewhat; we are all familiar with the wide scope of today's micro- economics (cf. Becker 1976, 1992; Aker- lof 1984). However, this broadening oc- curred only after behaviorism had declined and psychological language had lost some of its stigma. Whether eco- nomics widened its scope in the correct way remains a complex question worthy of attention.22 But setting this issue aside, in order to broaden its scope while retaining traditional theoretical tools, economics had to adopt a broader view of preferences which allowed elements other than market goods to enter as ar- guments, as in Kelvin Lancaster's charac- teristics model.23 A sociologically com- 22 Contemporary critics argue that economics should learn from other disciplines such as psy- chology and sociology, instead of simply exporting a fixed theoretical apparatus derived largely from introspection rather than from observation (cf. Etzioni and Lawrence 1991; Simon 1986; Tversky and Kahneman 1986). 23 Lancaster (1966) proposes a model of con- sumer choice in which market goods are merely inputs in the production of more fundamental goods, called characteristics. Thus, the technology</page><page sequence="22">1314 Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. XXXIV (September 1996) plex economics is, by its very nature, an economics that does not restrict its at- tention to market phenomena. For exam- ple, if we are to model altruistic behavior (as in Becker 1974), we must allow the utility of one individual to enter into the preferences of another. Such a model could never have passed scientific scru- tiny during the heyday of behaviorism because it necessarily views utility in very concrete psychological terms.24 In fact, Wassily Leontief (1947) argues that the behaviorist atmosphere of the early twentieth century suppressed an otherwise natural propensity to develop more general utility functions. Intu- itively, economists had always under- stood preferences as being defined over "general categories of needs," rather than over "particular individual com- modities." Earlier theorists such as Irving Fisher tried to rationalize this approach through the con- cept of services of consumers' goods as sepa- rate variables distinct from the goods them- selves . . . Although logically consistent [,] this theory, and rightly so, became a victim of the same wave of criticism that swept away the old-fashioned value theory. If measurable utility proves to be a fictitious concept inca- pable of operational verification [,] so also will the abstract category of generalized needs. The third and latest phase of this theore- tical development began with the surrender of all the old untenable positions and a com- plete retreat to the concept of a general indif- ference variety described in terms of individ- ual consumers' goods. (pp. 163-64, italics added) Here, we find a more forgiving expla- nation for the failure of economists to formulate a more constructive response to the first institutionalist critique. The methodological pressures of the time, for which the institutionalists were partly re- sponsible, restricted economists to a purely theoretical response, such as Dav- enport's statement that economists placed no limits on admissible prefer- ences. To propose anything more con- structive (such as a particular preference relation with some explanatory value), an economist would have been forced to utilize obviously psychological language, which would have drawn even harsher criticism than did his inaction. Quite un- derstandably, economists chose inaction. C. The Empirical Failure of Behaviorism When Knight and Bernadelli wrote, they were defending the old methodol- of consumption is a (usually linear) mapping from the space of market bundles into the s ace of characteristics combinations. The standar theory of consumer choice is a special case of this model, in which each good provides only one charac- teristic, and the mapping above is just the identity map. When we allow for more complex market goods which supply several characteristics, the Lancaster model a1lows one to consider which of a series of goods satisfies consumer needs most effi- ciently, since not all potential goods should actu- ally be produced. The model also allows us to think in terms of more fundamental (subjective) consumer needs, rather than only in terms of ob- jective market purchases. We can ask, "Where do market preferences come from?" Actualy, Lancaster was not the first to publish this theory. Gorman's lesser known paper (1956) was published earlier. 24 It may be argued that we can solve this prob- lem by defining altruism behaviorally, and stating that person A prefers situations in which person B obtains what B prefers. However, in order to flesh out such a theory, one would then have to con- sider how person A analyzes the tradeoffs between his own (individualistic) welfare, and that of per- son B. It would be difficult for a theorist to even think about such a question while forcing all thoughts of introspection out of her mind, for an altruistic situation is precisely one in which A in- trospects into B before making his decisions. Fur- thermore, a theorist could not motivate the as- sumptions she eventually makes about the tradeoffs between the welfares of A and B, with- out engaging in introspection. It certainly is possi- ble to avoid this introspection, and to formulate a model nevertheless, but such a model would be rather unconvincing and lacking in insight. The best way to model altruism is to talk about it as it is, a profoundly psychological phenomenon in which the utility of one person enters into the preferences of another. Any other construction would be artificial.</page><page sequence="23">Lewin: Economics and Psychology 1315 ogy of J. N. Keynes against the new methodology of logical positivism, which seemed then to be enveloping econom- ics. Yet the reign of logical positivism did not last long. As soon as it was born, doubts began to multiply about the co- herence, practicability, and usefulness of the behaviorist program. It was simply not empirically possible to base prefer- ence theory on behavior alone. Originally, when Samuelson (1938) proposed the revealed preference ap- proach, he motivated it by arguing that, if preferences are to be a valid theoreti- cal concept in economics, then they must be derivable from objective data, such as prices and quantities. In a 1961 survey article, Hendrik Houthakker praises the revealed preference approach, and em- phasizes its role in reinforcing "the em- phasis on observable implications that is gradually transforming consumption the- ory from a mere philosophizing about utility to an essential component of em- pirical research." Yet, he admits, "The approach has, perhaps, not yet opened as many new avenues of research as had at one time been hoped" (p. 713). What went wrong? The answer lies, in part, in the severe problems facing those who at- tempted to apply revealed preferences empirically. In the 30s, 40s, and 50s, many psychologists did attempt to derive utility functions experimentally (cf. Louis Thurstone 1931; Harold Gulliksen 1946; Stephen Rousseas and Albert Hart 1951; Frederik Mosteller and Philip No- gee 1951; Mosteller 1951; Purnell Ben- son 1955). Such experiments concen- trated for the most part on deriving expected utility functions, especially af- ter the publication of John von Neumann and Oscar Morgenstern's 1944 axiomati- zation of expected utility. However, as Duncan Luce (1959) writes, even in this area, "it must be admitted that the data so far collected are most ambiguous" (pp. 76-77). In their 1942 article on "The Empiri- cal Derivation of Indifference Func- tions," Allen Wallis and Friedman share Luce's skepticism about attempts to de- rive utility functions experimentally. In contrast with Luce's decision-theoretic emphasis, these authors are concerned with the more general role of indif- ference functions in economics. They praise ordinal preference theory for be- ing "free of irrelevant or erroneous as- sumptions about human psychology" and for its fruitfulness "in theoretical eco- nomics" (p. 176, italics added). However, Wallis and Friedman argue that, when we are interested in "the organization and analysis of empirical data on con- sumer expenditures" (p. 176, italics added), indifference functions are use- less. The approach fails because one can- not derive such functions from available data.25 The authors first consider the "experi- mental approach" which, as we saw above, was quite popular in the 1940s. They stress Thurstone's famous 1931 ar- ticle on "The Indifference Function," in which he derived an indifference curve made up of two-dimensional vectors con- taining quantities of coats and hats among which the subject expressed indif- ference (in a questionnaire format). Wal- lis and Friedman question the validity of this experiment. It is questionable whether a subject in so arti- ficial an experimental situation could know what choices he would make in an economic situation; not knowing, it is almost inevitable that he would, in entire good faith, system- atize his answers in such a way as to produce plausible but spurious results. (p. 179) 25 Wallis and Friedman do not actually cite Paul Samuelson's 1938 paper, which had not yet gained its current fame. However, they do address ideas much like Samuelson's, and they assume that such ideas are popular. Samuelson was, it appears, not alone in seeking an objective foundation for pref- erence theory. He was simply the first to address this concern theoretically.</page><page sequence="24">1316 Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. XXXIV (September 1996) Furthermore, making such experiments more representative of day-to-day eco- nomic decisions is impracticable. Having rejected the experimental deri- vation of indifference curves, Wallis and Friedman go on to evaluate the "statisti- cal approach," which uses "data on con- sumer purchases for the quantitative de- termination of the indifference function" (p. 183). (This method appears to be al- most identical to that of Paul Samuelson, 1938, but they do not mention his pa- per.) The statistical approach is as prob- lematic as the experimental one, and for much the same reasons. In order to ob- tain enough data points to perform a de- cent analysis of any one individual, one must allow a reasonably long period of time. However, in the course of any time period sufficiently long, preferences will surely change, and thus the indifference curve (and preferences) measured will not be accurate.26 In spite of Paul Sa- muelson's (1938) high hopes, the re- vealed preference approach had proved empirically useless. Like the indifference theory it was meant to replace, it too would become an artificial theoretical construct of little, if any, explanatory value. In response to these problems, Wallis and Friedman argue that a new approach to the prediction of consumer behavior must be found. Refinement and im- provement of indifference theory solve nothing, they argue, because the prob- lems are "an inherent part of the theory and represent not uncharted territory but seas in which no solid ground for empirical work exists" (p. 188). Rather than become entangled in a useless the- ory, economists should utilize the new science of econometrics to derive statis- tical relationships between consumer de- mand and various empirically measur- able factors that influence this demand. Wallis and Friedman were not alone in their disenchantment with behaviorally based indifference theory. Little (1949), one of the principal inventors of revealed preference theory, expresses similar con- cerns. He claims that "There is abso- lutely no logical reason why market de- mand curves [rather than consumer preferences] should not be considered to be the basis of price theory." People have held on to the theory of consumers' behavior out of a desire to emulate the success of methodological individualism in physics.27 However, Little argues that such a methodology simply does not work in economics. But it is only useful thus to push back the analysis [i.e., employ methodological indi- vidualism] if laws can be formulated about the behaviour of the "atoms." The theory of consumer behaviour is, however, a deductive system based on a postulated consistency, and, otherwise, it contains no hypotheses based on induction which would enable us to predict the behaviour of prices. The behav- iour of human beings seems, in fact, to be less predictable than the behaviour of aggre- gates of human beings, and, to the extent to which this is true, the theory of consumer's behaviour must, at least as far as positive economics is concerned, continue to be noth- ing other than a purely logical exercise, be- cause, in price theory, it is the aggregates, and not the individuals, which are of interest. (p. 99) 26 For other reasons, Wallis and Friedman also reject the use of "data for the same period but many individuals" (p. 184). 27The reference here is to mechanics, the sub- discipline of physics best known to the economists of the period. Classical mechanics analyzes matter by reducing it to a collection of particles, each of which is moved by forces, and each of which ex- erts forces on other particles. Thus, mechanics practices methodological individualism, for it ex- plains the behavior of large objects by breaking them down into their component parts. Similarly, neoclassical economic theory practices methodo- logical individualism, for it interprets macro be- havior such as price movements as the, product of the behavior of a mass of individual consumers. The consumers of neoclassical economics play the same role as do the atoms of classical mechanics.</page><page sequence="25">Lewin: Economics and Psychology 1317 By arguing that preference theory should be supplanted by the analysis of prices and quantities, Wallis and Fried- man and Little echoed the earlier argu- ments of Mill (de Marchi 1973), and later Gustav Cassel (1918) and many in- stitutionalists, that economics did not re- ally need a separate theory of value- only a theory of price determination. The adoption of a behaviorist, logical positivist approach to indifference theory forced economists into accepting such arguments. A nonbehaviorist such as Knight could defend preference theory or utility theory by appealing to our in- trospection; this theory explained the un- derlying psychological causes behind the prices we observe. By rejecting intro- spection, behaviorists divested them- selves of this argument, so that they could defend preference theory only on empirical grounds. Not even psychologi- cal ordinalism could pass scrutiny. Ac- cording to the logical positivist philoso- phy, preferences could be a valid concept only if they could be linked to measuremnents of behavior, or to demand functions, which reflected behavior. Re- vealed preference theory attempted to provide this essential link. The link had now been broken; in practice, the deriva- tion of preferences from behavior could not be done. Therefore, preference the- ory was left without any raison d'etre at all. In order to be rigorously scientific, economics was forced to limit itself to an analysis of prices and quantities alone. VI. Closing Reflections In 1950, utility theory was once again in a state of crisis. After several decades of earnest methodological debate, the profession had found no satisfactory re- sponse to its critics. How do we account for this failure, and how did utility the- ory survive? Most importantly, what can we learn from these events? A. A One-Sided Response The critics of utility theory, both psy- chologists and institutionalists, were dis- satisfied with economics in two main ways. First, utility theory portrayed hu- man beings inaccurately; it trivialized the role of habit, culture, institutions, social pressure, and the like (Copeland 1931; Downey 1910; James 1890; McDougall 1910). Second, utility theory was unsci- entific, for it was teleological and it talked of unobservable psychic phenom- ena as if they were objective and measur- able (Copeland 1931; Downey 1910; Hadley 1894; Tugwell 1922; Veblen 1909). Economists did attempt to address the second critique, and as we have seen, they became almost as extreme in their logical positivist views as their critics. However, at least in the mainstream, economists never really dealt with the first critique. In fact, the second critique diverted attention away from the first. Mainstream- economists responded to these critiques by (1) declaring indepen- dence from- psychology, and (2) adopting behaviorist terminology and, at least os- tensibly, behaviorist methodology as well. The result was counterproductive. As we have seen, the adoption of behav- iorismi undermiiined any (preference theo- retical) response econlomists might have form1ulated to the first critique, for be- haviorism stigmatized the psychological language that would hiave been essential to such a response. Moreover, by declar- ing independence from psychology, economists evaded institutionalist criti- cisms and redefined their position so as to make it explicitly irrefutable and tau- tological (cf. Davenport 1913; see end of Section III.B). People chose what they wanted, and what they wanted was de- fined to be what they chose. The theory said no more, and therefore, it could not be falsified. Of course, such evasion con-</page><page sequence="26">1318 Journal of Economic Literature, Vol. XXXIV (September 1996) tradicted the logical positivist methodol- ogy. Those who took positivism most se- riously, such as Hutchison, were aware of this problem and called for a more re- alistic economic theory which answered institutionalist criticisms. B. The Absurdity of Behaviorist Mainstream Economics Behaviorist mainstream economics was doomed to fail, for the theoretical prac- tice of "behaviorists" such as Samuelson contradicted their own professed meth- odological views. As Tugwell and Florence argued, if economists were to become behaviorists, they had to do so whole-heartedly and actually learn from the work of behaviorist psychologists. But even as they reformulated prefer- ence theory so as to make its behavioral implications more explicit, these main- stream economists nevertheless ignored the work of behaviorist psychologists. They continued to obtain their assump- tions from introspection or a priori de- duction, rather than looking to rigorous experimental results as their own behav- iorist methodology indicated that they should. Inevitably, the professed behaviorism of mainstream economists backfired. When some began to take seriously the quest for a rigorously empirical econom- ics, they found that utility theory per- formed quite badly, on the individual level at least. The indifference curves that had been so praised for their em- pirical rigor could not in practice be de- rived at all (see Section V.C). This dis- covery should, of course, have come as no surprise. Utility theory was from the beginning a product not of behaviorist observation, but of verstehen, introspec- tion and deduction. Remember that Knight, a great defender of utility the- ory, rejected behaviorism precisely be- cause he understood that one could not derive preferences from behavior alone; some introspection or interpretive psy- chology was essential. C. An Indestructible Theory Amazingly, utility theory did survive this crisis. In the end, when faced with a choice between behaviorism and utility theory, economists chose the latter, and strict behaviorism lost popularity in favor of a new methodology that could justify the theory. Friedman resolved the crisis by pushing the declaration of indepen- dence from psychology one step further. In his 1953 essay, "The Methodology of Positive Economics," he argues that when we make behavioral assumptions about individuals, these assumptions need not be accurate, and they may even be wildly implausible, as long as aggre- gate data such as prices and quantities behave as if our assumptions were accu- rate (Friedman 1953). Thus, Friedman simultaneously rejects both verstehen (which insists that assumptions be plausi- ble) and behaviorism. Economists such as Stigler (and, later, Becker and others) responded somewhat differently, by returning (I submit) to a more psychological, verstehen-infused approach to preference theory. They used this theory to attack head-on the earlier critiques of the institutionalists, and to attempt to prove that economics really could explain complex social phe- nomena.28 Psychological intuition per- meates such work. Ordinalism remains a tenet not to be challenged, but there has emerged a new, psychological ordinal- ism. (As Sen has argued, one cannot make sense of modern preference theory in nonpsychological terms. See Section I.A.) This revival has not gone unno- ticed, and as it did decades ago, utility 28 A striking example is Becker's (1992) recent paper on "Habits, Addictions, and Traditions." Here he discusses all three of these phenomena, all within a neoclassical preference theoretical framework.</page><page sequence="27">Lewin: Economics and Psychology 1319 theory has again come under attack. Many of the same arguments that typi- fied the early twentieth century again ap- pear in major economics and psychology journals. D. On Declarations of Independence This fact brings us back to the ques- tion with which we began this paper: What exactly is the relationship between economics and psychology? Can econom- ics really declare independence? The analysis above suggests that the answer is a resounding "No." As the experience of behaviorism teaches us, an economics that is devoid of psychology is doomed to sterility. Moreover, any illusion of inde- pendence only shrouds critical issues and delays their resolution. The fact that Sen's paradox has survived for so long in- dicates, all the more convincingly, that the methodological questions surround- ing the crisis of hedonism were never re- ally resolved properly. They simply lost currency, and economists, who had learned that they were independent of psychology, simply stopped worrying about the realism of microassumptions (after Friedman 1953). This misplaced sense of independence spilled over into other areas, so that economists have also failed to learn much from the work of sociologists, de- spite the fact that there is so much to learn here. True, economics has broad- ened its horizons considerably, so that we are not as vulnerable to the first insti- tutionalist critique as we once were. But we have largely failed to learn from those better acquainted with our newly discovered subject matter. For a broad- ening of economics to be truly success- ful, we must acknowledge our need to learn from other disciplines. Our illusion of independence has blinded us to this fact and has once again made us vulner- able to outside criticism. Here, we find the most important les- son of our historical excursion. We saw above how early twentieth century economists resisted all outside criticism, but to the extent to which they re- sponded, did so only to psychological criticisms, rather than to institutional or sociological ones. Again today, the issue of psychological assumptions in econom- ics has become prominent. Today, we find some important economists taking the issue seriously, and even formulating theories that allow for imperfect ration- ality or weaken established hypotheses (cf. Mark Machina 1982). Economics can gain much from this development, but we should also be wary of the pitfalls. However interesting it may be to explore the causes of preference reversals and to reconcile them with economic theory (etc.), if we spend almost all of our inter- disciplinary energy on such questions to the virtual exclusion of all other issues, we make a grave mistake. We see no similar flurry of activity among economists to take seriously cri- tiques coming from sociologists (who play the same role today as institutional- ist economists did earlier). We see economists formulating theories that in- vade the traditional territory of sociol- ogy, but little work that takes seriously what sociology can teach us about the economy. Again, our attention to outside criticism is skewed toward psychology, and again, institutionalists have encour- aged this trend by focusing unduly on the psychological shortcomings of eco- nomics, rather than on its more funda- mental and more complex institutional shortcomings (Etzioni 1988). Rather than focusing on psychology to the exclu- sion of sociology, we might actually do better by retaining rational choice as a basic framework, but enriching it by taking the analysis of actual social phe- nomena really seriously (Granovetter 1985). Whether we follow Granovetter's ad-</page><page sequence="28">1320 [ournal of Economic Literature, Vol. XXXIV (September 1996) vice or not, we must realize that a satis- factory solution to today's methodologi- cal confusion cannot simply involve psy- chology. Psychology alone is not enough, because we cannot even begin to formu- late a more realistic psychological foun- dation for economics, if we do not recog- nize the social forces that influence human decision making. True, we must encourage the nascent trend toward a more psychologically realistic economics. In the process, we must overcome our uneasiness about verstehen. We must recognize how much we do in fact use it, and that we ought, therefore, to use it systematically and openly, rather than haphazardly. But even these measures do not suffice, for they deal with only the psychological dimension. More funda- mentally, we must remember that eco- nomics is a social science, and that, therefore, institutional and social issues are what really count.
