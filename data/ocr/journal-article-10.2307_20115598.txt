<plain_text><page sequence="1">JONATHAN D. MORENO PROFESSOR GOODMAN'S STORIES Those of us who studied Nelson Goodman's work under his devoted student Richard Rudner came gradually to realize that, like the works of art he so congenially assays, there is more to Goodman's aesthetic views than meets the eye, or ear for that matter. As in his epis temological writings, Goodman's elegant exegesis tends to lull us into a false sense of security, unless we are startled by the discovery that the conclusions drawn are ones we have been drawn into, and then our sense is one of false security. So when Goodman shows that the relation between the order of telling of a story need bear no specific relation whatsoever to the order of occurrences in the story, I nod approvingly; when he concludes that some reorderings of the story in the telling eventuate in a study instead of a story, I wonder. But even my original nod was not aboriginal; the nod was encul turated. Ancient exposure to the studies in Languages of Art incul cated lessons like the conventionality of perspective, entrenched convictions that art works require reading, attached me to the notion that there is no innocent eye, least of all Goodman's. Without this fund I would not nod so glibly nor think it so obvious that narrative admits of so much reworking or so little necessary regulation. In a thirties film Blondie waits on the train for Dagwood to return from buying tickets in the station. Staring out the window at the neighboring train she notes left-to-right motion. Panicked, Blondie screams at the grouchy conductor that her husband is not on the train, that he is still buying their tickets. After it is curtly pointed out to her that only the other train is moving she sinks, embarrassed, into her seat. Blondie needn't be embarrassed, since I thought her train was moving, too. If the conductor hadn't told her we would have both been in the dark. Now, if I had seen the scene without sound, and if I could not read lips, I certainly would not have known what happened, although I might have guessed when Blondie sank back into her seat, but that's because I know Blondie, not because I know how to interpret the left-to-right motion in the window.

However, if the film were being run backwards, silently, and certainly if I didn't know that this blonde was Blondie, I would have been at a loss to know which train was moving, since people get up from seats much as they sink into them, and conductors sometimes walk backwards. This example works on several levels. Mainly, it serves to exhibit some of the many aids that are implicit in the apparently simple telling of the ordered events in this scene, how much we need to be able to take from the telling in order to get the order, as was noticed in the last phase of the example when we were deprived of so many clues. Goodman further notes that, even when the order of occurrence is determinate, it can be vacuous. Worse, I should add, it can be distracting. If, in an aesthetics course some years ago, William H. Gass had not shown me that the order of events in Rilke's Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge distracted the naive reader from the syn chronicity of the parts of the work, I could hardly at first blush have known this to be part of Rilke's point. This diverges from Goodman's Bruegel example because Rilke's telling takes time, but the structure of the tale is covertly timeless. That there is a preferred order of reading has more to do with the nature of written language and that of bound books than with the nature of the tale, as Rilke himself wants to say. Hence, this example tends to reverse the conclusion that was apt for the Bruegel: in Rilke's work the telling takes time but in an interesting sense the tale told does not; that the tale told takes time explicitly is not as important in this case as the fact that implicitly it does not. Goodman's discussion of foreflashes, flashbacks and flashbetweens reminds me how disconcerting it is to watch a film in a theater I have walked into late, then to see the last scene introduced by faded ripples that dissolve the previous scene. I realize that all I have enjoyed during the last hour or so was a flashback; more interestingly, I presume that had I gotten there on time I would have seen the body of the film introduced by some more faded ripples. Sometimes in such instances one overhears one's neighbor whispering to the uninitiated, "It's a flashback." So I nod, glibly, though I hardly believe that Goodman's exemplary enumeration of examples is the point, nor is it to get me to think up my own. If I can think that spatial perspective is conventional on</page><page sequence="3">PROFESSOR GOODMANS STORIES 357 canvas, then surely I can think as much in the case of temporal sequencing in narrative, whether on canvas, in texts, or on celluloid.1 Yet sometimes, Goodman notes, tellings so reorder events that they "work against" the story rather than "heighten" it; presumably the purposes of narrative are in these cases subverted for the sake of certain licit but other, expositive, purposes. Thus it is that biographi cal stories become biographical studies, for purposes of the study give the order of events a life of their own by altering the order of telling in a way that gives the events a studied significance. Perhaps my mention of purposes is anthropomorphic and gratui tous; Goodman seems satisfied to admit studies as such and explain their force retrospectively. One wonders, however, what the difference between story and study comes to beside or beyond a description of how one heightens the story itself and the other does not. Goodman proposes that, in a story turned study, the order of telling has been aligned with certain dominant categories. I suppose that the emphasis here should be on "dominant", since Goodman has frequently inveighed against notions implying simple givenness in ontological, aesthetic, and other contexts. So some categories of some kind are surely operative in the order of telling of stories, too, but apparently they are not among those categories that force alignment for their own sake, eventuating in studies. Now we need a criterion for knowing how to tell categories of study apart from categories of telling of stories. Much of what Goodman says in this regard makes me think that the categories that distinguish studies are diagnostic to varying degrees and in some colorless sense, from the psychologist's report to Huxley's. Now diagnoses are a kind of interpretation, but that is work that all categories do, so until we can demarcate diag nostic interpretations from other kinds with some precision the line between stories and studies will be too fine to make out. Even this tedious job might not have a future. It is not wildly implausible that in some cultural contexts what are stories to the natives are studies to us. Imagine being an innocent bystander at a psychoanalytic convention. There is a lot of straightfaced talk about subconscious complexes, so that what seems to us innocents to be a straightforward narrative account of a patient's history could sound wonderfully strange to the conferees after a few days of listening to each other. I presume Goodman can accept this as a trivial possibility on the ground that ways of hearing are as culturally contexted as</page><page sequence="4">358 JONATHAN D. MORENO ways of seeing. Still it would be helpful to have some cross-cultural earmarks of studies, for story lines are known as blurred only in light of the force of the study. One possibility is that there are certain behavioral cues which signal that a study is being entertained rather than that a narrative is being presented. Without such earmarks we could be at a loss to say which is story and which is study: either side could be the blurry one, depending upon where we came from. Perhaps this is Goodman's point, or close to it: if it is, he has taught me another in a long line of lessons; if it is not, at least I have something to look forward to. George Washington University NOTE 1 My mention of spatial perspective and temporal sequence is only by way of a reminder of Goodman's earlier discussion of the former in Languages of Art, (ch. 1, sec. 3). No systematic analogy is defended, though it seems to me to be worth thinking about.</page></plain_text>
