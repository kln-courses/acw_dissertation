So wrote the poet and craftsman, the Marxist medievalist William Morris.1 Though Morris was speaking mainly about leisure- or, as he put it, "a thriving and unanxious life"- as prerequisite for the production of art, he was also calling attention in a more general way to the economic foundation of culture. Morris implies that an economic base generates social and psychological conditions which in turn influence intellectual and esthetic life. Morris' own experi- ence taught him this approach to art, and he found it confirmed in the writings of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, his contemporaries and fellow residents in London. A more elaborate statement of the premises of Morris' views on art, and of those of the present paper as well, comes from Marx: In the social production which men carry on they enter into definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will. . . . The sum total of these relations of production constitutes the economic struc- ture of society- the real foundation, on which rises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social con- sciousness. The mode of production in material life determines the so- cial, political and intellectual life processes in general. It is not the con- sciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, theii social being that determines their consciousness. . . .With the change of the economic foundation the entire immense superstructure is ... trans- 1 In "How I Became a Socialist," Selected Writings, Ã©d.

In considering such transformations a distinction should always be made between the material transformation of the economic condi- tions of production which can be determined with the precision of nat- ural science, and the legal, political, religious, aesthetic, or philosophical -in short ideological- forms in which men become conscious of this con- flict and fight it out.2 My purpose in this paper is to trace a cultural phenomenon oi the fourteenth century to its "knife-and-fork" basis; that is, to trace the complex relation between one feature of the late medieval super- structure and its economic foundation. The phenomenon I want to look at is the rejection of analogical argument and allegorical representation by a significant portion of the intelligentsia in fields as varied as cosmology and logic, physics and poetry, political theory and the visual arts. The problem is worth our attention for other reasons than that, like Mount Everest, it is there. Because the allegorical mode has appeared in many genres (lyric, epic, romance, drama and novel) and in many historical periods (Old and New Testament, Greek, Roman, medieval, Renaissance and modern), writers on allegory tend to generalize rather easily about "the allegorical tradition" or about the "universality" of the allegorical impulse. This tendency characterizes some of the most distinguished contributions to the study of allegory, from C. S. Lewis to D. W. Robertson and beyond. Though the tendency to universalize does not necessarily invali- date these contributions, it is reductive in permitting, even encour- aging us to ignore the social origin and social function of cultural forms. In fact the uses of allegory vary; neither the allegorical tra- dition nor the medieval approach to allegory is monolithic. Insofar as any cultural form reflects the attitudes of one or another social class, so does allegory. In short, the dialectics of history creates a dialectics in art, an ebb and flow which most writing on allegory seems to minimize or omit.3 In discussing the fortunes of allegory 2 Karl Marx, A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy (Chicago, 1904), pp. 11-12. 3 Thus C. S. Lewis admits that, at one end of the medieval period, the Dark Ages produced very little original allegory, so that the twelfth-century efflorescence of the mode was "a genuinely new creation": The Allegory of Love (Oxford, 1936), pp. 84-87. At the other, there was in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries a se- rious "weakening of the genuinely allegorical impulse" (pp. 234-59). Yet none of</page><page sequence="3">THE POLITICS OF ALLEGORY 259 in the fourteenth century I hope to provide some sense of that dia- lectic. It is an effort whose implications do not end with the mid- dle ages. I. Elsewhere I have documented both the analogical tradition and the anti-analogical trend of the fourteenth century;4 I will not dup- licate that evidence here. Some new material is introduced below, but my main purpose in this part of my paper is to summarize both sides and to draw out some of their social implications. Part II de- scribes the major economic and historical changes reflected in the new approach to analogical thought. a. Science. Until the fourteenth century, medieval cosmology, founded mainly on Platonic and Aristotelian principles, supported several hypotheses based on the analogical perception of nature. The universe was thought to be round, like the earth at its center. Geocentricity itself was an analogical notion, duplicating the fun- damental human condition of perceptual egocentricity, each of us at the center of her or his own perceptual world. This interpreta- tion of geocentricity is supported by the notion (present in some- what different forms in both Plato and Aristotle, as well as their predecessors) that the cosmos itself was a living organism. Like any these phenomena are accounted for, and the unevenness in production is glossed over for the sake of continuity. Paul Piehler notes that "Allegory as a serious genre waned in the fifteenth century owing to the growing inability of allegorical poets to continue to achieve imaginative comprehension of the symbolical and mythical elements of the form": The Visionary Landscape (London, 1971), p. 20; but their inability is not explained. Northrop Frye admits the class uses of culture generally: Anatomy of Crit- icism (Princeton, 1957), p. 346; he hints at the social function of allegory in con- necting it with "the habitual or customary ideas fostered by education and ritual" (p. 90). But he recoils from these perceptions, all the way back to the idealistic Arnoldian notion that true culture transcends social class (pp. 347-48). And D. W. Robertson, attempting to trace what he sees as a nearly monolithic Augustinian tradition of allegorical thought over a thousand years of history, writes of "the medieval world with its quiet hierarchies," "a world without dy- namically interacting polarities," which knew nothing of "class struggles, balances of power, or ... conflicts between economic realities and traditional ideals": A Preface to Chaucer (Princeton, 1969), p. 51. With such a statement, wishful think- ing becomes outright fabrication. 4 In "Undoing Substantial Connection: The Late Medieval Attack on Analogical Thought," Mosaic, Vol. V, no. 4 (Summer, 1972).</page><page sequence="4">260 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY other creature it had a body, the physical universe. Like any other creature it had a soul- that is, a nature, or innate principle of move- ment and learning. Indeed Aristotle thought that each celestial sphere or body had its own particular intelligence, and he was able to calculate a total of 55 celestial intelligences. Like other living creatures the universe also had an absolute directional orientation: a universally valid up, down, left and right. In physics, theories of weight and motion also reflected ana- logical perceptions. They were accounted for by the principle of natural place, or like to like. Fire rises to the empyrean, rivers flow to the sea, stones fall to the earth, in an effort to rejoin the primal element from which they came. Each object or element tries to unite with the divine or universal model of which the object is part, copy or analogue. Underlying this physics is a profoundly analogi- cal notion of causality, which would be resurrected by Thomas Aquinas. It is that an effect resembles or participates in the essence of its cause, hence strives to imitate or join its cause. So fire to the em- pyrean, so the child to its parent, so (according to St. Thomas) the mind of man to God. Though the social function of such ideas in classical Greece does not concern us here,5 their effect in the Middle Ages was to provide scientific support for a particular social arrangement. The corrup- tion and degradation of the sublunary sphere, its distance from di- vine goodness, could be adduced as proof of the Christian (and rul- ing-class) virtues of humility and subordination; pride, together with its offshoots, ambition and rebellion, could be treated as un- natural.6 The existence of celestial intelligences demonstrated the universality of the elitist principle, and the principle of like to like would be used as an argument against social mobility. Ideas based on analogy survived in Hellenic, Arabic, scholastic and even Renaissance theory, though they were refuted by the most advanced fourteenth-century scientists, among them William Ock- 5 The definitive study is Alban D. Winspear, The Genesis of Plato's Thought (New York, 1940). 6 Arthur O. Lovejoy notes this use of medieval cosmic theory in The Great Chain of Being (Cambridge, Mass., 1936), p. 122. He adds that Renaissance astronomy would only have intensified the sense of humility, in emphasizing man's little- ness. The arguments against this approach to Renaissance science are presented by R. G. Collingwood, The Idea of Nature (Oxford, 1945), pp. 96-98.</page><page sequence="5">THE POLITICS OF ALLEGORY 261 ham. (d. 1349), Jean Buridan (d. 1358) and his pupil Nicole Oresme (1320-1382). In Buridan's work, cosmic soul and celestial intelli- gences became simply irrelevant as causes of motion, replaced by a theory of impetus. The theory of natural place was rejected on the basis of observation and experiment, and the probability ot a heliocentric universe was logically and mathematically demonstrated by Oresme. The spherical universe was denied, with Ockham and Oresme asserting the likelihood of an infinite universe. A natural corollary of this hypothesis was relative direction, and absence of any single center in the universe. Buridan's critique of analogical thought extended even to style, and he attacked Aristotle's use of anthropomorphic metaphor. "It is only," Buridan writes scornfully, "a figurative locution." For these scholars, analogy could no longer serve as a basis for scientific hypothesis, or as a stylistic feature of scientific discourse. Quite simply, they no longer saw in analogy an accurate perception of the physical world. It is true, of course, that many of these ideas were held "by logic only" and were not asserted to be absolutely true. Oresme, for in- stance, retreated from his demonstration of heliocentricity into fide- istic reassertion of the Biblical statement that "Deus enim firmavit orbem." For its lasting advances, cosmological theory would have to wait for the empirical evidence provided by the telescope, for the more sophisticated mathematics of Copernicus and Galileo, and for the detachment of science from theological speculation. There was nonetheless a continuous tradition of cosmological research from the fourteenth through the sixteenth centuries and beyond; and we may follow Crombie in seeing seventeenth century astron- omy as the second phase of an intellectual movement begun in the late thirteenth.7 b. Political theory. The late medieval conflict between papal and secular powers generated, in the fourteenth century, a thorough polemical attack on the entire repertoire of analogical and allegor- ical arguments with which the papacy had traditionally supported its claims to temporal power. Among the papal arguments was the venerable metaphor of the body politic, given its fullest develop- 7 A. C. Crombie, Medieval and Early Modern Science (New York, 1959), vol. IT, pp. 105-117.</page><page sequence="6">262 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY ment by John of Salisbury. All of society is like a human body, with the papacy as supreme power, or soul, and other social groups ranged below, down to the feet which, like the peasantry they rep- resent, cling firmly to the soil. Again, the allegory of sun and moon represented the papal and royal powers as the greater and lesser lights, the latter dependent on the former. The allegory of the two swords was another papal favorite, based on the interpretation of a Biblical locus and purporting to prove the validity of papal power. It was the notion of "representation," with its double meaning, that united allegorical interpretation with the historical transmission of power: contemporary ecclesiastics were said to "represent" BibMcal figures both because they were their image, and because they oc- cupied their position by succession.8 Hence the Pope "represented" the entire Christian community in both imagistic and political senses. A variety of arguments was used to refute these claims. Jean (Quidort) de Paris (1241-1306), a prominent polemicist in the serv- ice of Philippe le Bel, denied the validity of "mystical" or analog- ical argument, and, like Marsilius of PaduÃ¢ after him, conceded only very limited use of allegorical interpretation of Scripture. Both Marsilius in Defensor Pads (1324) and Dante Alighieri in De Mo- narchia (c. 1317) relied heavily on the logical analysis of papal anal- ogies, and also on arguments drawn from Aristotle. By contrast, William of Ockham, writing under protection of King Ludwig of Bavaria, used simple observation, foregoing the pyrotechnical dis- play of the others in favor of minimum effective refutation: Ock- ham's razor. Ockham also argued against representation as a logical reality, for although one person or group might delegate its power to an- other, there could be no real transmission of essence. The so-called "representative" body- the Church, a Church council, a city, a king- dom-remains nothing more than a group of individuals, a collective noun, a plurality which no legal fiction can reduce to true unity. The same is true for representation as image, symbol or allegory: 8 This formulation, and the section below on Ockham, are drawn from the article by George de Lagarde, "L'IdÃ©e de reprÃ©sentation dans les Åuvres de Guillaume d'Ockham," International Committee of Historical Sciences Bulletin (Paris), Vol. 9 (1937), pp. 425-451.</page><page sequence="7">THE POLITICS OF ALLEGORY 263 similarity in one respect is not identity, hence it confers no special powers. That the Pope inherits Jesus' power does not entitle him to claim Jesus' infallibility. For these fourteenth-century theorists, the immediate require- ments of partisan politics dictated the attack on older modes of ar- gument. This was of course no death-blow to allegory, for the old body-politics metaphor would reappear in the work of Sir John Fortescue, the fifteenth-century jurist, and it flourished mightily under the Tudors, who adapted wholesale the venerable methods of their enemy in Rome. Analogical argument is admirably suited to the needs of any ruling class which feels itself threatened by change; while those who desire change will tend to be as wary of allegory as was the Protestant reformer William Tyndale when he wrote: "Beware of allegories; for there is not a more handsome or apt thing to beguile withal than an allegory; nor a more subtle and pestilent thing in the world to persuade a false matter, than an al- legory."9 c. Logic. It was William of Ockham who in the realm of pure logic contributed most to the anti-analogical tendency, a contribu- tion centering in his theory of universais. Basically Ockham denied the epistemological grounds for analogical thought in denying the real existence of abstract entities. "Freedom" is a universal; so are "whiteness," "beauty," "justice," "mankind," "paternity," "simi- larity," "motion," "time," and any other such noun that corresponds to no physical object. Plato's ideal Forms are universais, so are St. Thomas' ideas in the mind of God; and the characters in personifi- cation allegory are nothing more than universais personified: Amor, Natura, Mens Humilis. Christian theology depended heavily on the reality of abstract essences in order to support such dogmas as the triune nature of deity, the transubstantiation of wine and wafer, original sin, and salvation. The allegorist also accepts at some level, implicitly at least, the reality of the abstract essences he bodies forth; otherwise the persuasive force of his work is lost. He must 9 From Tyndale's "Prologue to Leviticus," in Doctrinal Treatises; cited in Joshua McClennen, On the Meaning and Function of Allegory in the English Renaissance, U. of Michigan Contributions in Modern Philology (1947), p. 24. Despite a promis- ing title, McClennen approaches his subject from a rhetorical rather than social point of view.</page><page sequence="8">264 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY also accept that those essences are knowable, and that there is some reliable connection between them and our own world- a connection enabling the reader to transfer meaning from literal to figurative levels and to reason from known to unknown. As Arthur O. Lovejoy reminds us, this sort of otherworldly or idealistic world view has been "the dominant official philosophy of the larger part of civilized mankind throughout most of its history." Professor Lovejoy further remarks, with some naivete, that "by a familiar paradox . . . the chief power in the affairs of this world is not unlikely to fall . . . into the hands of those who have withdrawn from it/'10 The fact becomes rather less paradoxical, however, when we observe that the theory of correspondence between this and a supernatural reality forms the ontological basis of the theory of isomorphic structure. In this theory we are invited to see the cosmos, political society, the family and the individual mind as analogous structures, with God, king or pope, father or husband, and the ra- tional faculty supreme in their respective hierarchies. The theory is fundamental to conservative political theory in the middle ages, constantly used not only in papal polemics but also in the more general writings of Thomas Aquinas and others. There is in this world view no relationship that cannot be assimilated into an iso- morphic scheme. All this Ockham's philosophy would refute. The universal, he proposed, has no existence, either in the world or in the mind. It is not an idea, since it is not the idea of any thing. It is, simply, a piece of logical shorthand, "whose being is its being understood." If there were such essences, they would not be knowable in them- selves, nor could we legitimately infer any relation between them and the physical world, whether that relation be similarity, causal- ity or imitation. The entire process of reasoning from known to unknown becomes extremely precarious, and some scholars, such as Nicholas of Outrecourt, deny that it is possible at all. Ockham 10 Chain of Being, p. 27. Though he acknowledges "the social and political effects of otherworldliness," Lovejoy nonetheless asserts the "universality" of idealism as "of its own nature ... a mode of human thought and feeling" (p. 28). A more responsible approach to medieval philosophy appears in Katherine Archibald's essay, "The Concept of Social Hierarchy in the Writings of St. Thomas Aquinas," Historian, Vol. 12 (1949). Again, for Plato, see Winspear.</page><page sequence="9">THE POLITICS OF ALLEGORY 265 and Buridan agree that in many cases of natural law, probability suffices; still, there is in fact no way of knowing absolutely what God's will is, or that it won't change tomorrow. We cannot argue that God's behavior up to the present is any guarantee of his future behavior, or that his qualities as we now define them will not alter. Since God is bound by neither natural law nor his own promises, the universe becomes profoundly contingent and, in the absolute sense, unpredictable. Neither nature, society, nor the human mind are absolutely permanent or static in their structure; all are open to change and plurality, none can be fully understood by reference to an abstract a priori scheme. In its time Ockham's logic was known as the via moderna. Its dominance in European universities, especially those of central Eu- rope, helped pave the way for the Reformation, in rupturing that hard-won connection between this world and the next which had been the pride of medieval ecclesiastical philosophy. d. Poetry, I am using two criteria in my definition of literary allegory: that it is a sustained narrative, and that it requires trans- lation from literal to figurative levels of meaning. According to these criteria, the poetry of the fourteenth century shows a marked tendency away from the allegorical mode as it is represented by the fourth century Psychomachia of Prudentius, the De Plane tu Natu- rae of Alain de Lille, or Guillaume de Lorris' Roman de la Rose. Of course this tendency did not mean the end of allegory. Like any obsolescent cultural form it would decline gradually, and in the late-medieval period one can still point to Guillaume de Guille- ville's monumental tripartite work, or to the anonymous early fif- teenth century Assembly of Gods with its miniature psychomachia. Nonetheless allegory did change, and in its classic form was rarely practiced. The directions taken by the two major poets of the fourteenth century, Chaucer and Dante, indicate a movement away from the rigid allegories of the earlier middle ages, though with neither poet was the break complete. In using what Erich Auerbach has called the figurai mode, Dante in the Divine Comedy retains all the com- plexity of history and personality which traditional allegory is in- capable of. His characters are not personifications, nor do they par- ticipate in any action whose meaning differs from that of real life.</page><page sequence="10">266 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Chaucer translated three allegories: two appear as Melibee's Tale and the Clerk's Tale; the other is part of the Roman de la Rose. The judgment scene in the House of Fame is his only original piece of personification allegory; elsewhere there are scattered allegorical or symbolic motifs (e.g., the pilgrimage through life, the cosmic intellectual flight in the House of Fame) or purely decorative person- ified abstractions (as in the Parliament of Fowls). For the most part, though, Chaucer turned to realistic representation. The meaning that his characters achieve is not separate from their physical and social being, for, as with Dante, normal life itself is charged with meaning. Even such late-medieval works as are generally called allegories, are allegorical only in an incomplete and diffuse way. The major type is the instructional dialogue modeled on Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy. A personified abstraction may interrogate or instruct the central character, as in Gower's Confessio Amantis or Usk's Testament of Love. Minor allegories may be embedded in the treatise, like the beast fable in Gower's Vox Clamantis. There may be a symbolic or allegorical framework, as in Pearl, though Pearl herself is a figurai character, with biological and social existence within the poem. Indeed she can function as divine messenger pre- cisely because she was a real person who has died and been saved.11 Piers Plowman can be considered, with Confessio Amantis, as an example of the "estates of the world" genre.12 Its opening allegory of the field of folk soon becomes indistinguishable from realistic sa- tire, and the poem shifts rapidly between various modes of repres- entation. In none of these works do we find a sustained metaphor- ical narrative; none requires translation; there is no difference be- tween vehicle and tenor, but only a single level of meaning straight- forwardly expressed. e. Painting and sculpture. Some important developments in the visual arts parallel those noted above. Earlier medieval paint- ing, like Egyptian and Byzantine painting, practices conceptual 11 The point is made by Michael H. Means, The Consolatio Genre in Medieval Eng- lish Literature (Gainesville, 1972). 12 As Ruth Mohl does in The Three Estates in Medieval and Renaissance Litera- ture (New York, 1933).</page><page sequence="11">THE POLITICS OF ALLEGORY 267 rather than optical representation;13 that is, it makes no attempt to reproduce a naturalistic image. It displays, therefore, very little fore- shortening or perspective; space is two-dimensional; side-views and front-views are combined. We find rigid, immobile body postures and unrealistic proportions, stereotyped faces devoid of emotion, and hierarchal scaling in which the size of figures is determined not by their distance from the viewer's eye, but by their social or re- ligious importance. Indeed the viewer's eye is not an important element in conceptual representation, because the figures portrayed are little more than personified abstractions. They are not people at all, but subordinate parts of a developed, abstract, theological system, which deprecates the importance of the physical world. Con- ceptual art expresses an otherworldly religion in which the "real" form of a thing is not its visual form, but its relation to the ideo- logical system. The visual form is merely apparent-a lesser reality, not worth imitating. Thus in Christian art the important eye is not the observer's but God's, to which all objects are equally close: a notion of space which corresponds to the traditional Christian con- cept of time, which with God is a single eternal present moment. With the development of Gothic style all this begins to change in the direction of secular realism and naturalism. In sculpture we find individualized facial expressions, realistic proportions, grace- fully suggestive body postures, and an intensely humanized Jesus, Mary and saints. In painting, the world is now represented as a worthwhile place to be; it is God's creation, the scene of good deeds and of effective preparation for the afterlife. Physical objects, the human body and the old cult-images are now recognizably real. But it is primarily during the fourteenth century, with the deca- dence of Gothic, that the most important innovations appear in the treatment of space, with the work of Duccio and Giotto. The ob- server's eye becomes the criterion for spatial dimensions; propor- tion and perspective as we know them are discovered; space itself 13 For this section on painting and sculpture I am indebted mainly to Miriam Schild Bunim, Space in Medieval Painting and the Forerunners of Perspective (New York, 1940; repr. 1970); also Frederick Antal, Florentine Painting and Its Social Background (London, 1948; repr. 1965); Arnold Hauser, The Social History of Art (New York, 1957), vols. I and II; and Peter Kidson, The Medieval World (Toronto, 1967).</page><page sequence="12">268 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY becomes three-dimensional. These changes, as Bunim notes, "mark the transition from the medieval to the Renaissance concept of space" (p. 134). Like the other tendencies summarized above, late-medieval de- velopments in the visual arts participate in a general cultural move- ment from abstract to concrete, from ecclesiastical to secular, from universal to particular. Yet while such terms provide a closer defi- nition, they explain nothing but require themselves to be explained. What, then, are the new social needs to which that general cultural movement responds? II. For our period the dominant fact of economic history is the transition from feudalism to capitalism. It is the major contradic- tion of the later middle ages, and I am proposing that the phenom- enon I have isolated for study here is a cultural manifestation of that contradiction. As an important ideological weapon in the ar- senal of the feudal ruling class, analogical patterns of thought and modes of representation could not express the perceptions and val- ues of groups competing with that ruling class. The attack on anal- ogy, with the substitution of other modes of argument and repres- entation, does express the values and perceptions of such other groups at a particular moment in their evolution; that is, expresses the ideological needs which reflect their social reality. We may begin with a brief general sketch of the conflicting social realities of the late middle ages. My presentation is somewhat schematic- necessarily so, for in constructing an abstract model of feudalism I have taken salient features and minimized uneven development (difference from country to country and from century to century). In the interest of brevity I have also had to omit many subtleties of medieval class structure, as, for example, degrees of stratification among tenants. Nonetheless my aim is not to offer an exhaustive study of feudalism, but rather to focus on those of its aspects that are most pertinent to my subject. Feudalism is that set of economic and political arrangements, originating in the Merovingian age, which dominated Europe for nearly a millenium. Its economic base was rural and agricultural, with the large country estate (villa, seigneurie, manor) as its basic</page><page sequence="13">THE POLITICS OF ALLEGORY 269 social and economic unit. The estate was more or less self-sufficient economically; that is, it produced nearly all the agricultural prod- ucts and small hand-manufactures it required, and its surplus was almost entirely consumed by the inhabitants of the estate.14 Thus production on the feudal estate was planned to meet the known needs of a stable community; its surplus was for the most part use- value. Class structure on the estate was complex and it varied both with time and place. In general, though, its inhabitants can be di- vided into two groups: those who worked the land and produced its surplus but did not enjoy that surplus; those who did not work the land but who controlled it and enjoyed its surplus. The first group included tenants, free and servile, some poor and others pros- perous. The tenant (villein) owed his lord a fixed portion of his labor in working and maintaining the lord's land; he also owed certain tributes in money and in kind, and money taxes for neces- sary services held in monopoly by the lord: compulsory use of the lord's ovens, brewhouse, mill, stud animals, permission to marry, etc. An elaborate system of manorial policing ensured that there were no individualistic departures from this scheme, such as grind- ing corn at home in a hand mill. Infringements were tried and fined in manor court. The villein could not dispose freely of land or produce: he had to buy a license to sell beasts; only grain (within certain limits) could be sold without permission, in order to raise money for rents and taxes. In exchange for this and innumerable other oppressions the tenant population received the privilege of retaining a certain portion of their produce and labor for their own needs, and some limited military protection from the lord. The political features of this system are recognizable in the North Amer- ican company town, or in the great plantations of Brazil and other Latin American countries; of course neither of these can be called "feudal" in the economic sense since they produce for the world capitalist market. As for those who consumed the manorial surplus, they too oc- 14 The estate was not, of course, absolutely self-sufficient. Some luxury items were imported; there were some merchants and peddlers; some surplus products were sold in small local markets. But these factors were too limited to affect signifi- cantly the manorial economy.</page><page sequence="14">270 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY cupied various ranks and degrees. They constituted a chain of com- mand, linked by the institution of vassalage. This was a mutually binding contract in which the landowner ceded to his vassal the in- come from a portion of land (the fief) and some degree of legal jur- isdiction over it. In exchange the owner received military service and supplies, and financial aid. The vassal might in turn subdivide his fief among lesser vassals and so distribute the burden more wide- ly, a process called subinfeudation. In this structure the ecclesias- tical ruling class participated as well as the secular, for the villein was indeed servant of two masters. As the largest landlord in Europe, the Church had the power to levy taxes, raise armies and wage war, make laws and enforce them in its own courts. The ecclesiastical estate functioned no differently than its secular counterpart; and in the Chanson de Roland it is the valiant Archbishop Turpin of Reims who confirms the vassal's military duties, crying, "Ne sui mie vencut./ Ja bon vassal nen ert vif recreut" {laisse CLV, 2087-8). Hierarchal order is the key to the feudal social system. It can survive only when each individual correctly fulfills his obligations to those above and below; and as we will shortly see, it was in part the failure or inability of the ruling class to meet its traditional ob- ligations that led to the dissolution of the feudal structure. To such a system the importance of analogical cosmology, ontology and logic is self-evident. It permits the ruling class to justify the present so- cial structure as eternal, inevitable and immutable by analogy to cosmic structure. It mystifies human life and human suffering by relegating them to a secondary, derivative, and merely analogical, order of reality. It encourages the 'Virtues" of humility and obe- dience by placing earth and mankind at the bottom of the universe. As a literary manifestation of these principles we may look to Chau- cer's allegory, adapted from a folktale, the Clerk's Tale. Griselda is at once the ideal wife, serf and human being. Domestic, social and theological virtues are united in her. In order to transfer mean- ing from literal to figurative levels, as the Clerk insists we do, we must accept the isomorphic structure of those three areas, together with the humility and permanence of that structure. The notions of limit and stasis are also important to the feudal world view, with its regular and predictable cosmic movement and its carefully circumscribed universe. It is a world view whose stasis</page><page sequence="15">THE POLITICS OF ALLEGORY 271 and limits duplicate those of social structure. A social system which is economically static offers no basis for social mobility, for social mobility is made possible by increased wealth and productivity. In the feudal economy, increased productivity was pointless, so that social mobility was anomalous. Given a more or less stable popu- lation, a substantially increased surplus on the manor would only be wasted because there was no large national or international mar- ket to absorb it. Sold in small local markets it would only drive prices down and threaten the tenant's ability to pay money rents. Moreover, increased productivity would require too hard a hand on the already exploited tenant population, thus threatening the pro- ductive base itself (indeed this was a factor in the crisis of feudal- ism when, later on, increased productivity became economically necessary). And, given the static economy there was little need for technical innovation or for the intellectual ambition and inventive genius whose social effect is to increase productivity. Even when a technical innovation appears in this kind of economy it is not wide- ly used: ample human labor is available, and that labor has no other place to go.15 The concept of human nature as we know it today can scarcely exist in such a system. Instead, human nature and virtue tend to be defined as class nature and virtue. Plato defines them as such in the Republic; so does Andreas Capellanus, speaking of peasants, in a passage from The Art of Courtly Love which makes no secret of the social function of its concept of human nature: But lest you should consider that what we have already said about the love of the middle class applies also to farmers, we will add a little about their love. . . . For a farmer hard labor and the uninterrupted solaces of plough and mattock are sufficient. And even if it should happen at times, though rarely, that contrary to their nature they are stirred up by Cupid's arrows, it is not expedient that they should be instructed in the theory of love, lest while they are devoting themselves to conduct which is not natural to them the kindly farms which are usually made 15 See Marc Bloch, "Medieval Inventions" and "The Advent and Triumph of the Watermill," Land and Work in Medieval Europe (London, 1967); also E.

Virtue too becomes the correct fulfillment of class duties: how else can one understand the "virtue" of Roland, the chivalric prowess for which he is taken directly to heaven, despite his rejec- tion of Oliver's sage advice? Thus relations and perceptions of all kinds are dominated by the requirements of the social system. Cus- tom is the rule of life, and we recall that in its earliest meaning, "custom" is the feudal labor obligation: the manorial consuetudines. Though this static notion of society and human nature did cor- respond at first to economic reality, it survived among the ruling class even after the development of trade and towns began to change that reality. Here is what Andreas considers the correct line for a noblewoman towards a bourgeois suitor. "I am very much sur- prised," she says- it is enough to surprise anyone- that in such a great upsetting of things the elements do not come to an end and the world itself fall into ruin. ... It is not without cause or reason that this distinction of rank has been found among men from the very beginning; it is so that every man will stay within the bounds of his own class and be content with all things therein and never presume to arrogate to himself the things that were naturally set aside as belonging to a higher class. ... As for [your good character] this makes you very worthy of the love of a woman of your own class. But even if a falcon should sometimes be put to flight by a buzzard, still the falcon is classed with falcons and the buzzard with buzzards- the one being called a worthless falcon, the other a very good buzzard.17 The concept of individual character or merit has little meaning in a feudal society. In the sense that the particular person is compre- hended mainly by reference to the general category or class, the feudal concept of human nature is itself, loosely speaking, allegor- ical: the concrete is meaningful only when translated into the ab- stract. The ideology is perfectly expressed in pre-Gothic conceptual 16 The Art of Courtly Love, trans. J. J.

Arnold Hauser remarked that feudal society lacked "the intel- lectual dynamism induced by the competitive idea/'18 That com- petitive idea entered European life when the feudal system began its centuries-long process of disintegration; that is, toward the mid- eleventh century, when the economic base of feudalism, already weakening, was further challenged by rival forms of economic ac- tivity. So pronounced was the change in direction at this time that Marc Bloch was prompted to speak of "two successive 'feudal' ages, very different from one another in their essential character."19 Among the internal weaknesses of feudalism was intense compe- tition among lords for land and vassals. This resulted in increased expenditure, partly for sumptuary display (which in any case was an important use of surplus production). In the Middle English poem, The Parlement of the Three Ages, Medill-elde reproaches You the: For alle thy ryalle araye, . renttis hase thou none. Ne for thi pompe and thi pride, . penyes bot fewe. For alle thi golde and thi gude . glowes on this clothes, And thou hafe caughte thi kaple, . thou cares for no fothire. Stanza I, 186-89 But the condition treated here in moral terms was in fact a wide- spread economic situation. Competition among lords also generated continuous and extended warfare, such as the twenty-year battle which opens the story of Aucassin and Nicolette. The Crusades were a special drain, for they required an enormous initial outlay, and ruined many a noble family.

The worsening con- dition of the manorial worker, so eloquently described in the open- ing lines of the Second Shepherds' Play, drove many to leave the manor. Simultaneously with these events, the feudal system felt the ex- ternal impact of a complex of closely related developments: the growth of trade and manufacture, the development of national and international markets, and the revival of towns as centers of com- merce, industry and culture.20 Along with these events was created a new social class, the bourgeoisie, which began as rival to the feu- dal aristocracy and ended, a few centuries later, as the new European ruling class. In contrast to the relatively self-sufficient rural estate, the devel- opment of trade generated the urban center connected to a network o I other towns across the nation and abroad by mutual need: raw materials, processing, manufacture, markets, division of labor. In contrast to manorial use-value, trade created exchange-value. Sur- plus production could now be sold at a profit, in an infinitely ex- pandable market; with exchange-value, therefore, increased produc- 20 These developments can perhaps be traced in turn to an influx of Arab gold to Europe, though on the dating and precise effect of this there is some controversy. M. Lombard argues that the gold-hoards of Egypt and the Orient, discovered and re-circulated by Muslim conquerors during the ninth century, began from that time to revive the European economy via the importation of European slaves, furs, wood and metal: "L'Or Musulman du Vile au Xle SiÃ¨cle," Annales 2 (1947). With the general thesis Robert Latouche substantially agrees, though ar- guing for a delayed effect of the Muslim trade: The Birth of Western Economy (Paris, 1956; New York, 1966). Bloch (Feudal Society, p. 71) adduces repopula- tion, better communications and the end of the Scandinavian invasions as partial causes of the revival of commerce.

Postan, "The Rise of a Money Economy," Essays in Economic His- tory, Vol. I.</page><page sequence="19">THE POLITICS OF ALLEGORY 275 tivity became both a goal and a need, along with the mental and social qualities it required. The thrift, saving and reinvestment of early capitalists could only appear avaricious to the feudal landlord; while the feudal lord's conspicuous consumption of his surplus pro- duction must appear wasteful to the bourgeois. That conflict of val- ues is reflected, in rather crude terms, in the alliterative poem, Win- ner and Waster (1352). Perceptually, experientially, the world changes when exchange- value replaces use-value. The Coast Salish Indian may see in a cedar the form of a canoe, a roofbeam or totempole; but Mr. MacMillan or Mr. Bloedel must see in it so many board feet worth so many dollars in Japan. In part the new naturalistic perception of the late medieval artist had to do with his social background: art had moved out of the monastery into the hands of laymen. These craftsmen were professionals, people of good family, often with fortunes of their own gained by investment and in any case dependent on wealthy bourgeois patrons. Their interest was very much in the real world. Moreover, how could the late medieval artist continue to reproduce two-dimensional space when its inaccuracy was demonstrated all around him? He need not know that fourteenth century philoso- phers had recently demonstrated the probability of an infinite uni- verse; but he could scarcely help observing the apparently limitless expansion of markets, of geographical horizons, of commodity pro- duction, and of personal fortunes. I am suggesting, then, that the so-called " inaccuracies" of conceptual art express quite accurately not only a religious ideology, but the values of the economic and social structure supported by religious ideology. By the same token, natural space, distance and measurement begin to exist psycholog- ically and esthetically when they come to exist socially. From the start the medieval bourgeoisie were in competition with feudal lords. They competed first for labor-power, for they required a pool of free workers and artisans to produce what they would sell. Free, that is, from feudal ties, free to move where they were needed, free to work when they were needed, and free from property.21 To this end most town charters guaranteed freedom to 21 For an illuminating discussion of labor and capital in the medieval period, see Marx, Pre-Capitalist Economic Formations (New York, 1964) in the International Publishers edition with a useful introduction by Eric J.

But the bourgeois himself, whether mer- chant, employer or financier, also required freedom from domina- tion by lay and ecclesiastical lords. He wanted freedom to trade un- impeded and travel safely, freedom to hire and release employees, to raise or lower prices, wages or interest, to accumulate a fortune, marry a noblewoman or purchase an estate. The political privileges granted to the urban bourgeoisie were known as "liberties." Indeed the notion of "liberty" was the distinctive contribution to European thought of the bourgeoisie breaking free of feudal bonds; it culmi- nated in the slogans of French and American bourgeois revolution- aries of the eighteenth century.22 If it is true that man creates God in his own image, then it is interesting that the notion of an absolutely free God emerged dur- ing the fourteenth century. At the same time we find William of Ock- ham demonstrating the perfect freedom of human will: "there is no demonstrating," he remarks, "that what God intends is done by God or by anyone else." Humanity is bound neither by instinct nor by any analogical relation, as Aquinas has taught, to seek the good. But the pervasive notion of freedom carries uncertainty with it. The perfect freedom of God's will makes contingency the only reliable law of nature, and the perfect freedom of human will means the practically unlimited multiplication of possibilities- possibilities of motive, desire, will, action, and so on. When that sense of possibility, or contingency, becomes part of the writer's perceptual set- and it can only do so when it is a fact of social life- then he will not, I suggest, find allegory a satisfactory tine woolen industry of the fourteenth century offers an interesting example of reverse commutation- what might almost be called wage serfdom if not wage slavery: by a law of 1371 the worker was forbidden to repay in money his debts to his employer, but had to repay all debts in the form of work.

It is no coincidence that Lagarde (op cit.) compares William of Ockham to Rous- seau with respect to individualism; Rousseau fulfills what Ockham anticipated. Of course medieval industry and trade were not absolutely "free" but were closely regulated, especially in the fifteenth century. But this sort of internal control does not affect my argument about the relation of the bourgeoisie to the landed ruling classes.</page><page sequence="21">THE POLITICS OF ALLEGORY 277 mode of expression. That is because the allegorical character can display no free will, no irrational or inexplicable ambivalence. Even the composite character, like the love-object in Guillaume's Roman de la Rose, is no greater than or different from the sum of her named parts. The allegorical character may make mistakes, but even mistakes are easily rationalized by reference to the dominating ab- stract ideology. In the long run the allegorical persona is perfectly predictable, functioning within a narrative frame which is also per- fectly predictable. But the vagaries of free human will in a fluc- tuating society and in a contingent universe are not so easily cir- cumscribed or predicted. In a period of complexity and turmoil, the writer's concern with experiential truth must lead him to develop a narrative mode which can accurately reflect that complexity and turmoil. That Chaucer did not reject allegory out of hand, testifies to his own divided will: the dual commitment to experiential truth and to doctrinal truth which is so movingly expressed in his retrac- tion to the Canterbury Tales.23 The bourgeoisie also rivaled feudal lords for social status and political influence. Their wealth, and the gradual decline of aris- tocratic fortunes, enabled them to buy an aristocratic life-style, an estate, a title, or a noble marriage. Political influence the bour- geoisie began to acquire in several ways. One was that they were able to turn to their own advantage a contradiction within the ruling class, making convenient alliance with the king against lay and ecclesiastical lords. City charters granted by the king, privileges bought from impecunious local lords, parliamentary maneuvering in England especially,24 in France the protected status of "bourgeois du roi"- by all these means the bourgeoisie won influence in local and national government. Their payment for these privileges- the taxes, tolls, firma burghi, and ad hoc grants- in turn guaranteed the king a steady cash income with which to finance foreign wars and strengthen his hand against ever-troublesome barons and ecclesias- tics. This alignment of class forces was a new factor in the old strug- 23 My study of Chaucer's House of Fame, The Poetics of Skeptical Fideism (Chicago, 1972) focuses on that dual commitment. 24 A detailed study of the parliamentary process in England is Eileen Power's The Wool Trade in Medieval English History (Oxford, 1941).</page><page sequence="22">278 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY gle between papal and royal or imperial powers. The conflict had always been chronic, at least since 390, when Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, had excommunicated the Emperor Theodosius over the ques- tion of ecclesiastical versus imperial authority. From the late elev- enth century the conflict had entered an acute stage, focused on the issue of royal versus papal investiture of civil servants who were also ecclesiastics. But despite the continuous existence of the conflict from the earliest middle ages, the royalist camp never produced a copious, detailed and convincing polemic until the late thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Walter Ullmann hints at the reason when he observes that in the earlier period "those whose 'natural voca- tion' it would have been to propound a royal blueprint, an edu- cated laity, did not exist."25 In one sense they did not exist because modern European intellectual life did not exist: the great univer- sities that produced the educated laity were founded mainly in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and the Aristotelian tracts they would study were translated then as well. In another sense, the educated laity- that is, the bourgeois civil servants and propagandists- did not exist as a class because the bour- geoisie was not yet a decisive political force. With the centralized monarchy, with the idea of the state, with the national bourgeoisie and its mutually productive alliance with monarchy- all of which de- veloped from the thirteenth century on- it became, not the "natural vocation" but the class interest of the educated laity to support, with all its intellectual resources, the claims of royal power in opposi- tion to those of the pope. Their interests were, for the moment, identical with those of king and state: to establish strong jurisdic- tion over the state bureaucracy, over law, education, taxation and trade. Though the political theorists mentioned earlier occupy var- ious points on the antipapal spectrum, their concerted attack on analogical argument is as much the product of late medieval class structure as is their very existence as a group. Given the new importance of the bourgeoisie, social mobility became not only possible but necessary, accompanied by redefini- tions of virtue and human nature. Though the concepts were as old as the Gospels, they were revived now in context of a social situa- 25 A History of Political Thought: The Middle Ages (London, 1965), p. 131.</page><page sequence="23">THE POLITICS OF ALLEGORY 279 tion which gave them new and immediate relevance. The thirteenth century Middle English roman Havelok the Dane shows the me- teoric rise of Grim from serfdom to commercial prosperity, the re- ward of his loyalty to the king. No longer are noble sentiments and social mobility "unnatural" to men of Grim's class. Human nature begins to be severed from considerations of class, and Andreas' bourgeois gentilhomme hopes to be judged on merit alone, saying to the noblewoman he courts, Love is a thing that copies Nature herself, and so lovers ought to make no more distinctions between classes of men than Love himself does. ... If I have cultivated a character excellent through and through, I think that puts me inside the walls of nobility and gives me the true virtue of rank, and so my character puts me among the nobles. ... I cannot see any reason why if a man of the middle class excels a noble- man in the excellence of his character he ought not to receive a greater reward, since we are both descended from a common ancestor, Adam. Chaucer's praise of natural "gentilesse" in the Wife of Bath's Tale, the insistence of the stilnuovisti on the nobility conferred by love -these eloquent testimonials to the aspirations of a new class would echo widely in European literature over the next several centuries. In human relations, as well as in logic, painting, poetry, science and political theory, the particular demanded accurate representation in its own right, refusing to be subsumed in abstraction. I hope that the present paper, sketchy as it must be, has at least shown the futility of looking for single causes of cultural change. The economic base remains clearly a dominant cause and should therefore be incorporated into history, history of ideas, and art crit- icism; yet it is not isolated from other kinds of cause: military, nat- ural, cultural, and so on. Ockham's view of causality may be rele- vant here: the whole multitude of both essentially and accidentally ordered causes is caused, but not by some one thing which is part of this multitude, or which is outside this multitude, but one part is caused by one thing which is part of this multitude, and another by another thing, and so on ad infini turn.26 26 From Quaestiones in Lib.

They never see anything but here cause and there effect. That this is a hollow abstraction, that such metaphysical polar opposites only exist in the real world during crises, while the whole vast process proceeds in the form of interaction (though of very unequal forces, the economic movement being by far the strong- est, most elemental and most decisive) and that here everything is rela- tive and nothing is absolute- this they never begin to see.27 If we can incorporate that sense of dialectics into medieval scholar- ship, we will have taken a first step toward overcoming the isolation that literary scholars have traditionally felt. Like Engels' gentle- men, scholars have often rendered themselves irrelevant with false or inadequate views of past and present alike.
