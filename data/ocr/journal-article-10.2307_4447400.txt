(200 Madison Ave- nue, New York, NY 10016). 705 p. $21.95. Barnett has written an orderly account of the most important findings in etho- logy. The text is an excellent, updated source of pertinent facts. The author is very knowledgeable in all areas of etho- logy and has cited countless research examples of both invertebrates and ver- tebrates where appropriate. Most of the work cited has appeared since 1950. The book pulls together much of the current information on recent theories and con- cepts of ethology. These as well as the ones they are replacing are mentioned in several places. The photographs used are excellent, and the many figures and graphs illustrating experimental research clearly explain the phenomena. In addi- tion to being thorough, the book is very readable and insteresting. It also has a complete glossary of terms and an ex- tensive bibliography. The book is divided into six major topics. Discarding anthropomorphic pre- sumptions, the author explains in part I the immediate causes of the science of behavior: these include stimuli acting from outside, and also the animals' internal state. In parts II, III, IV, behavior is classi- fied mainly by its functions. Behavior can be related to specific needs, such as food, water, or shelter. Movements related to such needs and those that lend them- selves to analysis in rather simple, mech- anistic terms as well as those that cannot be related to simple terms are discussed. The direction of an animal's movements is often determined by other animals of different species. Moreover, while preda- tors adapt their behavior to new circum- stances, genetic changes allow prey populations to remain protected in changed environments. Physiological mechanisms-both positive and negative feedback regulators -that illustrate homeostasis in animal behavior are ex- plained. Part III deals with topics relating to circumstance adaptation or "learning." The author examines the two main ways reflexes can be modified as a result of individual experiences. These are habituation and the conditioned reflex. He also turns to behavior that is relevant to what animals do in natural conditions, such as the effects of trial, error, success, rewards, and punishment on gradual changes in behavior. Finally, he discusses how complex animal nervous systems can store information about the en- vironment, without reinforcement, and use it later to take the shortest route between two points. Such information is provoked by exploratory movements and a great curiosity. Habit formation and problem-solving usually occur in a social context among primates. While the development of abilities often depends on imitation, the teaching of skills is con- fined to human beings. A systematic study of social ethology or relationships between members of the same species is the focus of part IV. Comprehensive coverage is given to topics on reproductive activities, terri- torial behavior, ontogenetic studies of social conduct, and analysis of communi- cations (social signals) in animal conduct. Included wherever appropriate is exten- sive research on primates. Is "human ethology" possible? Part V considers this debate. One of the two Emmett Wright is NABT's book review editor. Dr. Wright is Associate Professor of Science Education, and Director of the Science Teaching Center, at the University of Mary- land. He also holds a joint appoint- ment at the University's College of Agriculture in Environmental Sci- ence. Readers interested in becoming book reviewers should contact Dr. Wright directly. Inquiries on this feature should be directed to him at: Science Teaching Center University of Maryland College Park, MD 20742 chapters presents man as a primate, ex- amining human evolution; the second, focuses on fundamental differences between ourselves and other species. An important question is the method used to reach valid conclusions about human beings. Two difficulties arise. First, there is little experimental or observational evidence and second, we are ignorant on some matters and therefore cannot make a conclusion. The author suggests that readers interested only in conven- tional ethology should omit this part. Three important matters of debate in the theoretical foundation of ethology are dealt with in part VI. These are the questions of heredity and environment, the question of reductionism, (e.g., Can all behavior be reduced to physiology?), and the role of natural selection and evolution on behavior. I would highly recommend Modern Ethology as an authoritative, compre- hensive source of background informa- tion for both the teacher and under- graduate or graduate student of etho- logy.
