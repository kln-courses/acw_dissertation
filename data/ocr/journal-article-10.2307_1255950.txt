<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. FOLKMEMORY. IT is the privilege, as well as the duty, of the President of such a Society as this to render annual account of his stewardship, and illustrate, as best he may in a short hour. some aspect of the method, or of the results, of the study of Folklore which either stands in some special relation to his own studies, or seems to him to deserve the special attention of students of Folklore at the moment. For the same reason, and still more " lest one good custom should corrupt the world," you change your President frequently, and thus ensure a succession of different points of view. You have had literary Presidents, well qualified to discuss, perhaps even to exemplify, the relations between Folklore and what in the largest sense I would describe as the Art of Poetry ; the fertile stimulus of immemorial tales and ingenuous beliefs on the creative imagination of modern masters of narrative and revealers of the soul. You have had technologists, to whom popular usages and the folk- lore of the daily round in cottage and field have given the clue to the uses of implements and other material relics of early times, and made dry bones of museum specimens live again in the hands of those who fashioned them because they needed them, and because their needs knew no better satisfaction. You have had students of religions, ancient and obsolete, or living still, and of those pseudomorphs of religion, mythology in the popular sense, and magic in the more philosophical sense of that popular term; aspirations towards a philosophy which have begun, like all philosophy,</page><page sequence="2">Presidential Address. 13 in wonder, but have not yet made the transition from wonder to observation; from Oa'ua, as the Greeks put it, to eowpla. You have also had anthropologists and ethno- logists, concerned both with the peoples among whom what we call folklore is almost all the lore they have, and with those racial and cultural interpretations of our own folklore which have thrown so much light on the composite structure of European nationalities. But it does not appear that any previous occupant of this chair has been primarily or professedly a historian. Ethnology has of course a wide range of contacts with History: unfortunately also a rather broad " no-man's- land," as to which, seeing that it is for the most part un- cultivated, and at some points a mere jungle, there have been polite disclaimers of ownership from both sides; from History, on the ground that, in the absence of adequate documents, historical conclusions in the strict sense cannot be formed; from Ethnology, on the less admissible plea that wherever ' events ' or ' personages,' in the historical sense, can be discussed, on whatever kind of authority, there the study of the behaviour of man in racial groups, or even in what have been described as 'natural' com- munities, becomes so complicated and deranged that it passes out of the ken of the seeker after natural laws among human beings. Now it is in this no-man's-land between the domains of ethnology and history that the student of folklore has one of his happiest hunting-grounds: not at all that it is his habit to go after other people's hares,-though very lively hares occasionally break away from either the ethnologist or the historian, or both, and these, I take it, are fair game ; -but rather that the folklore collector has one eye for certain small deer which the historian at all events is a little inclined to let live, and the ethnologist to overlook because they have a perplexing way of 'shamming dead' till folklore comes along and finds them alive after all.</page><page sequence="3">14 Presidential Address. For the same reason, probably, I must confess that, in common with some others, I find occasional difficulty in discovering exactly what " folklore " itself is. And I have some sympathy with the oracle quoted by Sir John Rhys in the twelfth chapter of his Celtic Folklore " that while it is not science to know the contents of myths, it is science to know why the human race has produced them." Is the study of Folklore the collection of folktales, observances, objects of antique, all-but-obsolete use, and the like, in all their world-wide variety ? Or is it, like other branches of science, the search for connections and causes, for reasons why; the application, to a particular kind of material, of the scientific method, that is to say, in Kingdon Clifford's phrase, of " organized common sense "? There can be little doubt as to the answer. But what is the particular kind of material to which the student of Folklore applies this ' organized common sense ' ? Again the answer is obvious, at all events if we mean what we say. Folklore is folk lore, learning, accumulated infor- mation, data for scientific study, preserved in a particular way and presented in a particular medium, namely the minds, by which I mean essentially the memories, of the folk, the ordinary run of people. In communities like our own, it must be admitted, what I have described as being, for humanity as a whole, the ordinary run of people, is becoming day by day so com- paratively rare, that what might be reckoned a good specimen of humanity for the folklore student's purpose is a pearl of great price which if a man find in a village, let him go and sell all that he hath and buy that village and add it to the Society's collection, lest the jewel escape him. Folklore then, as a subject of scientific study, is the content of folk memory. " By Folkmemory," as Mr. William Johnson wrote in the book which bears that title, " we mean the conscious or unconscious remembrance, by a people collectively, of ideas connected with the retention of rites</page><page sequence="4">Presidential Address. 15 and superstitions, habits, and occupations." But how does "a people collectively" " remember" unconsciously or otherwise ? Not in the transcendental sense in which a Platonist, or any other dealer in such ethereal wares, speaks of the ' soul ' of a people, or the ' spirit ' of the age; or as physicists only a little while ago still spoke of Matter and Force, suggesting by the ingenuous device of capital letters that these were singulars which have no plural, like certain words in the Latin grammar. We too, like the latter-day physicists, shall do well to formulate, at the outset, our version of the Quantum Theory: for we are to deal with no abstract or collective humanity, but with Nurse Jenny 1 and Modryb Marin:2 ~ n - e ar-opa KaL KEVa, as the Greek philosophers put it, " in simple truth atoms and emptiness," human individuals in a world which is otherwise not human. All else exists Xdo'y, in our no less individual attempts to say something about them; and the Times reviewer of Mr. Johnson's book touched the same spot when he char- acterized folkmemory as a " metaphorical phrase." What we are dealing with, that is, are folkmemories: and what we are to apply our common sense to do is, in the words of Sir John Rhys, " to know why the human race has pro- duced them," or, in accordance with our Quantum Theory, " why human individuals have severally produced them." Prior to the question how Cinderella and Tom-tit-tot and our other types of folklore material have the vast and per- plexing distributions with which we are familiar, is the fundamental question not merely how do contiguous villages in this country come to have these kinds of folklore, but how are such things propagated, or created, at all. Recent discussions of the theory that, in a general sense, culture is " diffused " have had at all events this value,- that they have drawn attention to the existence and im- portance of this prior question, how any element in any 1 In Robert Chambers' Popular Rhymes of Scotland, Edin., 1858. s Sir John Rhys, Celtic Folklore, pp. 599 et seq.</page><page sequence="5">16 Presidential Address. culture comes into existence at all. For, clearly, if at one time it did not exist, it was not there to be diffused. Either, therefore, all elements in all cultures always existed some- where, or else somewhere and somewhen somebody in- vented something; and that on a very large number of occasions. And on each such occasion somebody described to somebody else what he now believed to be true; what was, indeed, in philosophic jargon, " true for him." If what was " true for him " became (on whatever grounds) " true " for the other fellow, we cannot but admit that " diffusion of culture " in an elementary sense had occurred. And it is indeed in this way that our whole system of knowledge has been put together; out of the acceptance, with more or less good reason, by others, of the original creations of this or that mind. But these creations are of different kinds. One mind, let us say, regains consciousness after an uneasy night obsessed with the notion of a chimaera bombinans in vacuo ; another with a nebular hypothesis or a quantum-theory; another with the notion that all men are born equal, or have equal rights to the fruits of another fellow's labour. I leave it to philosophers to explain how it is ascertained that any one of these creations in any way corresponds with any kind of objective reality. What concerns us as students of folklore is, as already suggested, " why human indi- viduals severally produced them " ; or, rather, if we are good diffusionists, " why any other human individual found them acceptable when they were produced " ? It is a frequent and rough-and-ready way of accounting for this acceptance, to say that by experience a notion is found to be useful, and is accepted as such irrespective of any question as to its truth. Some would go further and say that the notion is believed to be true because it is found to be useful; others, that it is believed to be useful because it is found to be true. Both aspects of the matter concern the student of folklore especially ; because all the</page><page sequence="6">Presidential Address. 17 folklore that he collects falls into one or other of these two classes. The first, consisting of statements which are believed to be true because they are found to be useful, covers all that borderland between magic and common sense which har- bours popular remedies, weather lore, and superstitious beliefs about places or physical features of the landscape, animals, plants, and other natural objects. It includes customs of avoidance, and precautionary ceremonies on social occasions, great and small, - from rites de passage, such as weddings, to seasonal sequence of children's games. When such beliefs and observances are challenged, they are defended on the double ground, first that they merely are part of the social order, with the implication that the social order is adequate to the needs of those who observe it, and in so far is useful for them to observe; secondly, that things will not go right, if this or that custom is in- fringed, with or without instances of the way things have gone wrong after infringement; and in this second argument the appeal to utility is explicit. The second class, namely beliefs, and observances associated with them, which are accepted as true, and only believed to be useful, needs rather close consideration. A very large number of such beliefs, and especially those to which some kind of observance is attached, seem merely to be the consequence of such general experience of utility as is held to establish the truth as to what goes on; so that what looks like an argument in circulo,-" useful there- fore true, true therefore useful,"-is not recognized as absurd, because what is meant is rather " useful in the past, therefore true then and now; true now, therefore useful now and in future." Here the appeal to past ex- perience is to a kind of experience which is verifiable by fresh experiences ; it differs only from scientific proof in the looseness of its practice, not in any lack of logic in its B</page><page sequence="7">S8 Presidential Address. principles. Of the gradualness of the transition from magical to scientific practice, and the differences of tem- perament and behaviour among individual practitioners, which distinguish the magician from the chemist or the physiologist, I made some mention in my presidential address to this Society a year ago. What I am more especially concerned to examine to-night, -and to examine from the point of view, not of the experi- mental but of the historical sciences,-is the residue of our second class of folklore material, in which statements are accepted and transmitted as if they were true, but of which it is no longer possible, by any process of experimental verification, to establish their truth, or to apply the prag- matical test of present or future utility in observance. It is at this point, as it seems to me, that the contributions of Folklore to Ethnology pass over into contributions to History. What Ethnology owes to Folklore has been con- spicuously shown by one of our earliest and most dis- tinguished members, Sir Laurence Gomme, and in special reference to Celtic folklore by Sir John Rhys and others. The argument rests here, in the first place, as you may read in Sir Laurence Gomme's classical essay,3 on the geo- graphical distribution of certain kinds of notions and customs, and on the correspondence between this or that folklore distribution with the map of racial, linguistic, or other ethnographic data. In the second place, it is supple- mented by the social distribution of the same notions and customs, most clearly illustrated in the stratification of cults and superstitions among peoples which have well- marked ' castes ' or other systems of graduated privilege or status; the argument here being that, where there is reason to believe that one element in the population of a region has been superposed on others by conquest or migration, and as long as such elements retain their social structures and live their lives in essential matters apart, each group * Ethnology in Folklore, 1892.</page><page sequence="8">Presidential Address. 19 thus separately organized conserves its own beliefs and customs; and that, even where political or economic changes have obliterated the more obvious social dis- tinctions, this conservation of customs, politically or econo- mically indifferent, supplies the evidence for distinguishing such originally distinct elements, and reconstructing the racial, social, and political history of the people which has resulted from such intermixture. By this combination of geographical and stratigraphical analysis, very significant conclusions have been drawn as to the sequence of invasions, and something even as to the relations between conqueror and conquered on each occasion. It is of course a great and cumulative advance towards certainty in such ethnological conclusions, if the distribu- tions, stratigraphical and regional, of different customs, tally; as a geologist recognizes any given 'formation' of strata more certainly, when he recognizes several char- acteristic fossils, not one or two only, in its scattered ' exposures' and 'sections,' cliffs and quarries. He may not find all these in every place open to his observation; but, the argument being cumulative, each such identifica- tion reinforces it. There is, of course, another side to the matter, the methods of geographical and stratigraphical analysis being logically sound only when they are applied to classes of facts which can be identified in the sense that a geologist may be said to ' identify ' fossils. We have to realize that they are as liable to lead to fallacious conclusions, if the data to which they are applied are not in this sense identical. Some fossil corals, for example, and other lowly forms of life, are so indeterminate in their mass-formations, and so liable to destructive changes in the long process of petrification, that they may be, and have been, confused with rearrangements of the matrix in which they are found, which are not only devoid of coralline structure in other respects, but may be produced experimentally in the geological laboratory. Such</page><page sequence="9">20 Presidential Address. objects are clearly not of great value as ' characteristic' fossils, seeing that some or all of their characters may be due in any instance to either of two quite distinct processes ; the arrival of living coral-individuals from elsewhere,- which is an example of ' diffusion,'-or the rearrangement of mineral matter, of local origin, at a period which under the circumstances of the formation either of a coralline or of any other limestone did not come into being until after the corals (if any) contained in that limestone had ceased to live. In the latter event, the result is clearly not due to zoological 'diffusion,' but to local, topical, endemic changes of a mineralogical order. I have chosen an example from another field of historical science, in order to preclude the notion that the difficulties which beset the ethnologist in ' identifying ' instances of custom or belief are due to any peculiar freakishness in human behaviour, and not simply to the operation of what writers on logic conveniently describe as the " plurality of causes " ; a perplexity the results of which are familiar to the student of folklore in the normal practices of " sym- pathetic magic," and in such beliefs as the Arab myth about the leaf of the tulip-tree, that its apparently mutilated tip was torn off as a souvenir by Mother Eve as she was being driven out of the Garden; a charming anticipation of the Lamarckian theory of the inheritance of acquired variations. With these and similar 'cautionary tales' in mind, we may estimate what advance, if any, in ethnological method beyond the work of the pioneers in British and particularly in Celtic folklore, such as Sir Laurence Gomme and Sir John Rhys, in the last decade of the nineteenth century, has been achieved by the researches of Graebner, Rivers, and others in the first quarter of the twentieth. The work of Rivers, in particular, deserves commemoration, because his History of Melanesian Society attempted to do for a region almost devoid of documentary material for history, and almost un- touched by the stratigraphical assaults of the archaeologists,</page><page sequence="10">Presidential Address. 2 I what the pioneers of geographical and stratigraphical ethno- logy had been encouraged to do for Western Europe in the light of, firstly, a fairly copious literary tradition ; secondly, half a century of philological analysis of a group of languages some of which had alphabetic records over a range of over 2500 years ; and, thirdly, anthropological analysis of mixed populations formed from racial strains of markedly different physique, supported, too, by the paleontological evidence of ancient human remains from all periods back to the later stone age. It would, for example, have been a bold inter- preter of Celtic folklore who would have followed up the clue of the " little people,"-the fairies and dwarfs,-rather than of the giants, as a criterion of racial stratigraphy, in the absence of evidence that the pre-Celtic aborigines were of markedly shorter build than the Celtic-speaking intruders, and it would be an instructive check-experiment to apply the same method of investigation, on the one hand to the folklore of the southern Bantu-speaking peoples, spreading into regions where the aborigines,-if we may judge from the Bushmen,-were dwarfish; and, on another, to that of South America, where at all events one strain in the more southerly and at first sight more aboriginal population is of Patagonian stature ; for in this instance we might expect to find giants, not dwarfs, playing the part of the " little people " in Celtic folklore. I have digressed,-at some length, I fear,-into a discus- sion of that aspect of Folklore which brings its method and its results into collaboration with those of Ethnology, because I want to distinguish it from the group of data and of problems which lie on the borderland between Folklore and History, with which alone a historian has any special -concern. For alongside that large class of notions and customs which remain part of the cultural outfit of a people, because their truth is assumed, and some utility anticipated from the acceptance of them,-as when localities haunted by</page><page sequence="11">22 Presidential Address. fairies or elves are approached (if at all) with customary precautions against mishap, or wishing wells or fortune- tellers are accepted as such on account of the practical value of a glimpse into the future, or anticipated control over the course of events,-there is a considerable store of folk- memory which is concerned with the past merely in part, unalterable, and at first sight unutilizable. Yet here, once again, we distinguish two kinds. There are, on the one side, tales told about the past which are in the special sense myths, that is to say explanations of some phenomenon of the present, or of the nearer past, in narrative form, and for the most part with anthropomorphic agencies, or in the broadest sense animistic causes, for the physical effects which it is sought to explain. These stand in the intellectual outfit of the people who conceive or transmit them, as the discoveries of pure science stand in the outfit of educated people now, and these extreme varieties of the attempt to satisfy that intellectual curiosity which appears to be so deep-seated in men's minds are linked by the long series of explanations which make up the 'popular science ' and the 'natural philosophy' of people in intermediate stages of intellectual self-consciousness, between the mental out- look of a Darwin or a Kelvin and that of a Bushman or an Australian ' blackfellow.' On the other side, there are what perhaps are best de- scribed as in the most literal sense traditions about the past experiences of the people themselves: and here we are clearly on the very frontiers of the domain of History. They do not primarily or necessarily attempt, or claim, to explain anything, though they are frequently associated with ancient structures, or with the localities of events, and to that extent are explanatory of them. But in what I now describe as a tradition, it is the old building on the bone- strewn battlefield, the Plague-stone, or the Gallows Hill, or Deadman's Lane,-haunted and avoided for utilitarian reasons, no doubt, but that is here secondary,-which ex-</page><page sequence="12">Presidential Address. 23 plains and authenticates the narrative of the things which are said to have occurred there. When " little Peterkin," in the nursery-poem, brings a human skull to old Caspar, it is recognized at the same time as something which has to be explained by the veteran to the novice,-and so far it ranks with any other scientific information which makes people 'knowledgeable' as they grow up,-but, for the old man, it is only corroboration of what he already knows as a fact of history :- " ''Tis some poor fellow's skull,' quoth he, Who fell in the great victory." What victory it was, old Caspar could not tell, but that is a matter for which contemporary record was in this case available: but the fact of the " famous victory " was as much, and in the same way, part of his intellectual outfit, like his observance of Sunday, or any other part of his peasant's culture. And it was this that gave Peterkin's find its subordinate but intelligible place in his peasant's knowledge, and may be did even supplement the next rewriting of the battle of Blenheim, in respect of the precise course of events, in a way that no skull, found equally casually in Peterkin's mother's village twenty miles away, was ever likely to do: there was much more likelihood indeed, in that event, of a ' crowner's quest' and a local scandal, than of a contribution to military history. In mediaeval and modern history, this kind of folk- memory for events does not count for very much, all the principal occurrences being established by contemporary documents, official and otherwise. The primary value is as an aid in identifying the precise localities of minor events, as we have already seen. This, however, while testifying to the superior efficiency of written records, illustrates also their disastrous by-effect,-from the folklore point of view, -in superseding the practice of oral tradition, as well as the data which it may conserve. In particular, the popular</page><page sequence="13">24 Presidential Address. use of calendars and diaries, and of consecutive numeration of the years, instead of reckoning by reigns, priesthoods, or the generations of family history, transfers all this kind of folkmemory from what may be described as its natural content or background to an artificial and mechanical scheme. But we have only to go a little way beyond the bounds of documentary history to realize how full and vivid a pre- sentation is possible of the main outlines, as well as the personal details, of a period the history of which rests almost wholly on oral tradition. According to Sturla Thordsson, who died in 1284, the first man who wrote down in the Norse tongue, in Iceland, " histories relating to times ancient and modern " was Ari Frodi, who was born in lo67, a full generation after the death in 1030 of Snorri and Skapti the Lawman, with whom the great age of Icelandic history ends; and over two hundred years after the Scandinavian discovery of Iceland, with which it begins, about 850. Even the events commemorated in the earlier sagas, which were transmitted orally, though con- siderably later than the first settlements, fall between 930 and 980, that is to say about a century before Ari's birth, and quite four generations before his literary career, which falls after I Ioo. Though oral saga was already falling into neglect, Ari was in time to include among his sources, (besides dirges and battlesongs for particular occasions, and metrical genealogies, fortified against decay like the songs by their metrical form), " the dictation of old men," some of whom he quotes by name. Central in his great design, and for that reason all the more instructive as to his sources and method, is the Book of Settlements, which surveys in geographical order each separate settlement, and sum- marizes the history of its families ; and in Sturla Thordsson's edition (between 1270 and 1284) the genealogies are con- tinued into the thirteenth century. These familiar facts are sufficient to show that without habitual use of writing an</page><page sequence="14">Presidential Address. 25 immense mass of strictly historical information was pre- served as it accumulated, during about seven generations from the colonization to the introduction of Christianity (and therewith presumably some few literate individuals) and for another four from that crisis to the first attempt to supplement oral tradition by a written text. In this instance, we have in the earliest texts themselves, supplemented by the formal history-writing of the thir- teenth century, which are separated by about fourteen generations from the first colonists, and quite seven from the first Icelandic Christians, fairly full information about the social and political circumstances in which such trans- mission occurred. It is a homogeneous, independent, in- tensely virile society, intimately acquainted within a fairly coherent region with its own internal affairs; in touch, all the while, with similar societies in its motherlands, Scandi- navia and Northern Ireland; already acquainted through the latter with orally transmitted poetry of a high order, and engaged, within its own borders, in the erection of a social order and a system of law which should conserve to every free man his hereditary privileges and possessions. In these circumstances, each man's business was everybody's business. There were stupid men, forgetful men, guileful men, in that society; but the general public knowledge of the historical facts was the protection of the weak, as well as the interest of the strong; and the conservation of this mass of ' folkmemories,'-in the sense that they were memories which everyone was assumed to possess, or to have access to, among his neighbours, if his own memory was less tenacious than theirs,-had an immediate practical value in daily life. Nor was this state of things altered in essentials by the acceptance of a new religion, for the priest- hood was at first a secular profession, with local and mun- dane interests compatible with those of other ordinary people; and the corporate or class interests of the clergy as such, or of the Benedictine and Augustinian houses,-</page><page sequence="15">26 Presidential Address. less than a dozen in all and none earlier than I I33,-hardly counted for more, as a disturbing factor, than the growth of the great chieftaincies; though both alike were the causes of civil wars in the thirteenth century, and indirectly of the submission of the Icelanders to the King of Norway in 1262-4, and the formal replacement of the old Common Law by the Norse code in 1271. It was this political catastrophe, on the other hand, and still more the dis- regard of the Norwegian Treaty of Union by the Danish kings after the Union of the Three Crowns in 1280, which at the same time took the heart out of the people of Iceland, and introduced them to new literary topics and foreign modes of expression. Sturla's own verse compositions, in the generation of the Treaties of Union, are prosaic and artificial; and in the generation before his there were already treatises on metre, grammar, and diction, which show how precarious already was the hold of the literary vehicles of this popular tradition over the later saga-writers. Fortunately the collections of living tradition made by Ari and his successors, at " the dictation of old men," were themselves treasured, expanded, and incorporated in the work of Sturla and other historians still in touch with the remnants of the same folkmemory, at a period when political changes were rapidly putting its information out of date, because out of use. The audience of a saga-man in the twelfth century had three absorbing interests, fighting, litigation, and family history as the warrant for the status and resources which made either war or the law worth while; the Christianized and pacified subjects of a distant province of Denmark lost most of what had formerly made life worth living: with foreign intercourse came foreign diseases; and by a tragic accident disastrous volcanic outbreaks devastated the natural resources of the country at a moment when the people of Iceland were least fit to conserve what remained. It is instructive to compare the folkmemory of Iceland</page><page sequence="16">Presidential Address. 27 with that of its nearest relatives and of its closest socio- logical analogues, the folkmemory of the Polynesians, and especially of the Maoris. Denmark, which until the raid on Lindisfarne in 793 had been little more than an asylum for refugees from the Frank regime in Western Europe, passed through the colonization period without attaining or indeed requiring the political exaltation which dis- tinguished the new settlements in Iceland ; and the far greater influence of the Danish church, and a succession of strong kings from 1157 to 1241, gave its political experience a very different career. It was quite in accord with this that the Gesta Danorum of Saxo was in the first place sug- gested by ecclesiastical authority ; in the second place, and consequently, was written in Latin, not in the vernacular; and, thirdly, was no more succeeded than it was anticipated by the wealth of popular oral compositions which Icelandic society found indispensable in its daily concerns. The ver- nacular literature of epic and lyrical poems, as collected by Anders Sorenson Vedel for example no earlier than 1591, represents the style and tastes of the fourteenth century at earliest, and reveals to us the age of chivalry, not of heroic adventure; law-books, a few edicts, and one medicine-book of 1244, carry our knowledge of the language back to the beginning of the thirteenth century, but throw no light on genealogical or topographical matters. Our impression is therefore confirmed that the Icelandic output of vivid and coherent folkmemory of these things stands in real relation with the autonomous social structure, and unconstrained political fortunes of that insular society ; and that Danish folkmemory was as unimportant in practical life as it is meagre in its actual remains. In Polynesian society, on the other hand, we have the Icelandic situation of remote independent colonization, followed by long immunity from serious disturbances, re- peated manifold. As in Iceland, social organization reached a high degree of complexity and precision; authority</page><page sequence="17">28 Presidential Address. within the group rested on status either popularly acknow- ledged or popularly confessed, and ranks and titles, as acknowledgments of personal or family eminence, were care- fully observed: rights and obligations were the subject of a system of customary law, with a recognized procedure for their maintenance. Between autonomous groups there was open competition for the natural and economic (that is to say the human) resources of the region, leading to adventures, warfare, and conquest. In such societies, as in Icelandic, family history, communal history, and regional history were matters of practical concern and common knowledge. Folkmemory of events and personages within the several groups was copious and coherent: there is even a large measure of congruity between the traditional his- tories of different communities. The genealogies of Maori chiefs, for example, go back coherently for about eighteen generations, or rather more than five hundred years. Here, in New Zealand, the risk of disturbance has been least, and the folkmemory probably goes back approximately to the Maori colonization. In less insulated areas of the island world, the traditions are less continuous, and more varied. When Sir George Grey went to New Zealand in 1845, one of his chief difficulties in understanding the drift of Maori arguments in official correspondence with native chiefs was " that these chiefs, either in their speeches to me, or in their letters, frequently quoted, in explanation of their views and intentions, fragments of ancient poems or proverbs, or made allusions which rested on an ancient system of mythology." He expressly mentions the obscurity of " the meaning of the great mass of the words which the natives upon such occasions made use of," involuntary testimony to their archaic diction; and he includes in his own translations 4 from this " mythology " much that has since been realized to be essentially folkmemory of historical events, as well as numerous genealogies. It seems clear that, as late as the 4 Sir George Grey, Polynesian Mythology, (1855), Pref. p. vii.</page><page sequence="18">Presidential Address. 29 middle of the nineteenth century, this kind of folkmemory had still its practical utility as evidence in argument about public affairs. Here, in the absence of other means of transmission, and in presence of practical need for its information, folkmemory covered a considerably longer period of time than is observ- able in Icelandic tradition. Sir George Grey noted, how- ever, " that even the great majority of the young Christian natives were quite as much at fault on these subjects as were the European interpreters ",;5 and that he was him- self only just in time, thanks to the confidence of the chiefs in his goodwill, to preserve much of this folkmemory by writing it down, and translating it; for, as he goes on to say, " it is less likely that any one could now acquire them, as I regret to say that most of their old chiefs, and even some of the middle-aged ones who aided me in my re- searches, have already passed to the tomb." He leaves it to be inferred that the younger generation had not acquired this folklore from the older ; and there is no reason to doubt that the reason for this was the same as in Denmark, and in Iceland,-a new religion, and a new government and code of law, superseding the practical uses of the traditional knowledge. In the Polynesian instance, there is no check on the veracity of these traditions, other than their coher- ence with one another, and the agreement of traditions about comparatively recent events and persons with the records made by early European visitors of the names and rank of individuals whom they met. In the culture of people who made so little use of imperishable materials, and in particular had not the potter's art, archaeological verifica- tion of the relative dates of settlements from the amount and character of stratified d6bris in their settlements cannot be expected to give such explicit results as in Northwestern Europe; but it is in the highest degree desirable that archaeological excavations should be made ; and, until this 5 Loc. cit., pp. vii-viii.</page><page sequence="19">30 Presidential Address. happens, it would seem necessary to observe some caution in the use of this traditional information. What is significant for our present purpose, and serves to contrast the long range of Polynesian folkmemory with the comparatively short period which had been covered by that of Iceland when it fell under influences unfavourable to further propagation, is the far greater extent to which supernatural elements have come into the stories about persons who nevertheless have a generally historical back- ground. Especially in incidents of the voyage of emigra- tion, the leaders behave as gods rather than heroes, and work wonders beyond the power of ordinary men. Even in some of the later Icelandic sagas,-later that is in style of composition rather than in the ascertained date of the events which they record, there is trace of similar accretion of incidents, and enhancement of characteristics; a com- petitive aspect, which in Iceland may be provisionally related to the circumstances of the period of civil wars after IIoo; and in Denmark,-where it is much more marked in Saxo's Gesta Danorum than in any work of the Icelandic historians,-to the influence of foreign models, and of events and personages borrowed from Gothic, German, and Anglian literatures which had already passed through the same transition at earlier phases of European history. We have next to compare what we have been tracing, down to this point, with Professor Chadwick's analysis of the development of heroic poetry among the Teutonic peoples during and after their own Age of National Migra- tions, which began in the fourth century and ended before the close of the sixth. In this analysis, " the history of heroic poetry falls naturally into four stages. To Stage I belong the court poems of the Heroic Age itself ; to Stage II the epic and narrative poems based on these; to Stage III the popular poetry of the eighth and following centuries;</page><page sequence="20">Presidential Address. 3 to Stage IV the German poems of the twelfth and following centuries, composed at a time when heroic subjects had again come into favour with the higher classes." It will be seen from this sequence, first, that the foreign models of Teutonic origin which we find contaminating the folk- memory of Denmark in Saxo's time were already in Stage IV, and consequently stood at a very much greater distance from the events which they professed to commemorate than the Icelandic saga-literature, of which we already traced Stage I in the centuries from the colonisation of Iceland to the comparatively peaceful period after the introduction of Christianity, and Stage II from this point to the generation of Sturla, in the latter part of the thirteenth century. Secondly, it would appear that, both in Iceland and in Denmark, though for rather different reasons in each, saga- composition gave place, in popular esteem, to a ballad literature in new metres, and fresh diction and style, dealing with love-tales and similar genre motives, legends of the saints and other religious subjects, or episodes from the repertoire of romance or mythology. Thirdly, the foreign models of the twelfth and thirteenth century, already re- ferred to, are now revealed as a far distant sequel, and in some sense a renascence, of an earlier example of folk- memory which, as Prof. Chadwick has shown, belongs to a period in the fortunes of the Teutonic peoples which very closely resembles in many of its essential characters the colonisation period of Iceland and of the Polynesian Pacific. In this larger perspective, I venture to suggest that it is possible to amplify to some extent our notion of the circum- stances in which folkmemory attains to the vividness and coherence which make it a trustworthy source of informa- tion to the historian. For the conditions in which this kind of intimate personal interest is necessarily and generally felt, in the family concerns and local associations of everyone else within reach, are peculiar. In what I may describe as normal statical relations</page><page sequence="21">32 Presidential Address. between a people and its surroundings, which may have been attained rapidly or have resulted from a long period of adjustment,-it matters not which, for our present purpose,-it is difficult to see what interest any one com- munity has in the concerns of any other, or what useful purpose is served by enquiry into them or discussion of them. When there is ample surplus of domesticable but undomesticated environment, as in a tropical forest region, or in secluded areas of great natural fertility, such as the great river valleys, already long exploited, as in Southern China, but not endangered by encroachment from beyond their margin,-wherever, I venture to suggest, statical con- ditions exist between Man and Nature,-there we have no reason to expect folkmemory of individual personages or events, for the rather obvious reason to which I drew atten- tion at an early stage in this argument, that events, in the historian's sense of the word, simply do not occur, nor do personages arise. There may be under these conditions folklore of those other sorts to which we had to attend at the outset, in order to set them aside as elements in the scientific or economic outfit of the people, as distinct from the historical; but of the folkmemory which I have been trying to characterize, there is little, if any, because people in these circumstances can hardly be said to have any history at all. It is the disturbance of such statical equilibrium, on the other hand, whatever its cause, creating needs not pre- viously felt, and not satisfied, indeed incapable of satisfac- tion with the given environment and resources, which dis- locates the social order in such fashion that either whole economic groups, or fragments of groups which no longer maintain themselves entire, literally need to know where they are ?, what they are doing ?, who is doing what to them ?, and in virtue of what qualities or antecedents ? Conversely what seems to narcotise folkmemory is the establishment once more of some sort of modus vivendi, in</page><page sequence="22">Presidential Address. 33 the literal sense of the word ; some new social and economic order. Only when,-and, I venture to suggest, normally, if not always, when,-such order is established,-not infre- quently by exhaustion or deprivation of the people's own ability to dispute it,-does the general interest in what are now seen, I think, to be the disturbing factors themselves, subside too. It does not of course follow that information stored in such folkmemory fades out, any more than folk-medicine fades out abruptly in face of scientific hygiene and thera- peutic. But its value ceases to be historical value for the people themselves. It survives, and is transmitted, but for other reasons ; for the intrinsic beauty of its literary form, the moral significance of characters and situations, the likenesses which there is now, perhaps, opportunity or genius to perceive between historical narratives and aspects of the course of nature. Its forms remain, but the content, in its former intimate relation to living or remembered persons or their actual representatives, and to a topography once so charged with personal associations, becomes generalised, abstracted, idealized. 'Folkmemory,' in the specific sense to which I have tried to confine my use of the word, passes over into ' folktale,' or is abbreviated into proverb, as in so many of the episodes collected from his Maori confidants by Sir George Grey: 6-" Thus died this Maui we have spoken of, but before he died he had children, and sons were born to him; some of his descendants yet live in Hawaiki, some in Aotearoa (or in these islands) ; the greater part of his descendants remained in Hawaiki, but a few of them came here to Aotearoa." Thus far, we have narrative, folkmemory. But the record goes on :-" Ac- cording to the traditions of the Maori, this was the cause of the introduction of death into the world (Hine-nui-te-po 6 Loc. cit., pp. 57-8. [The first part of an article on "Proverbs in Native Life, with special reference to those of the Maori," will appear in the next number of Folk-Lore.-ED.] C</page><page sequence="23">34 Presidential Address. being the goddess of death: if Maui had passed safely through her, then no more human beings would have died, but death itself would have been destroyed),"-that is analogy with a great natural fact; an episode of saga embodied in a philosophical creed,-" and we express it by saying 'The water-wagtail laughing at Maui-tikitiki-o- Tarangu made Hine-nui-te-po squeeze him to death.' And we have this proverb 'Men make heirs, but death carries them off.' " That is the sublimation of a hero's adventure into an aphorism, as we speak of " Hobson's choice " without very clear notions about Hobson the man, or his times. No wonder that Sir George Grey's European interpreters were as much at a loss to explain the language of Maori diplomacy as the "great majority of young Christian natives," to whom, if indeed they had even heard of them, Maui and Hine-nui-te-po were old wives' tales and nothing more.
