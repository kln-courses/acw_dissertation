They all begin with the entry of "a mina (470 gr) of silver for the silver head of Kura", the principal god of the city of Ebla. The statue of Kura was clear- ly the subject of a rite of annual renewal. Annual offerings were also destined to other gods such as Hadda: a double-headed axe, giš.šitax = ha-bù' or to Rašap and Ammarigu: two bracelets each, gú-li-lum. Among the deities who received gifts at various times we find dHa-a-ba-du9 who appears in seven texts: two date from the period in which Ibrium was minister (roughly corresponding to the last part of the reign of Irkab-Damu and the first years of Išar-Damu) and five from when Ibbi-Zikir, son of Ibrium, succeeded his father as the head of the Eblaite administration during the reign of Išar-Damu. The documents relating to Ibbi-Zikir show a notable increase in the circulation of pre- cious metals; consequently, the mention of gifts to the gods is more frequent. dHa-a-ba-du constantly receives a plaque, kù-sal2, of gold weighing from half a shekel (see passages 4, 7.1, 7.2 at the end of this note) to a shekel (9.4 gr) (nos. 1, 5.1, 5.2, 6.2) and even 4 shekels (nos. 3, 8). In text no. 6.2 it is specified that one kù-sal is for a "raven" buru4-MUŠEN. In text no. 2 there is a du-rúm of 3 shekels. But in 6.1 a kind of silver helmet covered with gold is donated. The givers of such gifts are the king (nos. 1, 4, 5.1, 7.2, 8), the queen (nos. 3, 4, 5.2, 6), the heir to the throne Ir'ag-Damu (no. 7.1) and the minister Ibrium (no. 2). Document no. 9 is of a different nature: a list of sacrificial cattle for some of the principal deities among whom, exceptionally, is found dHa-a-ba-du. The col- ophon, which possibly furnished a means for understanding the nature of the text, is not preserved. dHa-a-ba-du was, however, a minor deity at Ebla who figures in none of the twenty-one monthly lists of offerings of sheep by the Palace where, al- together, more than forty gods are mentioned3. 1 See F. Pomponio (forthcoming). 2 The kù-sal is used as a clasp for a bird, and in pairs as a bit for an equid; see Archi, Mis- cellanea Babylonica: Mélanges M. Birot (Paris 1985) 32-33. 3 Four of these tablets have been published by G. Pettinato, OA 18 (1979) 85-215. This author holds (ibid., p. 105 with note 120) that dGa-ba-du corresponds to dHa-a-ba-du , but the phonetic difficulties are insurmountable. 6Ga-ba-du is attested only in TM.75.G.2238 obv. VIII 23, and has to be analyzed as /kabtu/, a deified epithet: "Venerable". Cfr. dKab-ta , dKa- ab-ta , attested in second- and first-millennium texts; see W. G. Lambert, RIA 5, p. 285.</page><page sequence="2">250 Alfonso Archi Unlike the other cases, in passages nos. 1, 4, 5.1, 7.1, 7.2 and 8, the offering or gift to dHa-a-ba-du is related (also syntactically, except in no. 1) to that for the god Hadda. Only three couples of divinities, one male and one female, are attested with any continuity in the Ebla texts: dì-da-bal/KVL - be- mí (= bãltum "Lady"), dRa-sa-ap - dA-dam-ma, dA-gú - dGu-la-du4. It is, however, evident that Hadda and dHa-a-ba-du formed a couple, even though the cult of the goddess was far less important than that of the great Weather-god. Since /1+V/ can be expressed simply by V5, the name dHa-a-ba-du /haHaBa- tu /, can easily be interpreted as a form with the feminine nisbe: /halabajtu/ "She of Halab"6. During the Ebla period the most important centre for the cult of the god Had- da was Ha-lam w (the other was Lu-ubP)1; and it has been proposed by W. von So- den and W. G. Lambert that Ha-lam u is to be identified with Halab8. The name of the female counterpart of Hadda in the Ebla texts prove that Ha-lam u was indeed the Early Dynastic writing for Halab. Document no. 2 directly connects the goddess with the place Halam: dHa-a- ba-du lú Ha-lam*1. Here the scribe has inserted into lam some wedges, as though he wanted to write išh(lamxkur): certainly a mistake and not a piece of data to be adopted in favour of the reading Ha-išuki9. During the second millenium the Hurrians settled between the Taurus and the 4 See ARET VII 150 (2), and the indices in the volumes of the series ARET. 5 See Archi, SEb 1 (1979) 110; M. Krebernik, ZA 72 (1982) 211; M.-V Tonietti, "La co- siddetta L-Reduktion nel sillabario di Ebla", Quaderni del Dipartimento di Linguistica dell'U- niversità degli Studi di Firenze 3 (Firenze 1992) 113-124. She thinks, pp. 121-122, "che si tratti di un processo di palatalizzazione ... non condizionato dal timbro della vocale vicina, dal momento che opera indistintamente con tutte le vocali del sistema; processo forse dovuto ad un fenomeno di interferenza linguistica". The interpretation given below of the name dHa-a-ba-du seems to point instead to a process of velarization. 6 For the presence of the relational suffix -ãj in Eblaite see A. Archi - R Piacentini - F. Pomponio, I nomi di luogo dei testi di Ebla (Archivi Reali di Ebla Studi II; Roma 1993) (= ARES II) 21. Concerning the representation of the diphtong aj , and the possibility of the shift to ã in Eblaite and in Northwest Semitic, see G. A. Rendsburg, Eblaitica 2 (1990) 91-126, with previous literature. 7 See ARES II, 257-260. 8 W. von Soden, in: Ebla 1975-1985, L. Cagni ed. (Napoli 1987) 84: "Halamb ( Ha-lamki)"&gt; who was followed by M. Astour, in: H. Waetzold - H. Hauptmann, Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft von Ebla (Heidelberger Studien zum Alten Orient 2; Heidelberg 1988) 147 with note 50. W. G. Lambert, MARI 6 (1990) 641-643, argues convincely that Hl-ha-lam , with the variant dHa-lam , attested in the Early Dynastie tablets from Mari has to be identified with Hadda of Halab. Lambert also noted the OB PN from Mari I-din-dHa-la-ab (ARMT 26/2, 484, 10) in support of his interpretation. P. Steinkeller, NABU 1993/10, has added the PN Puzur4-Ha-la-ab lú Ma-rF attested in an Isin tablet, BIN 9, 324, 2-3. It is to be noted that in the GN Ha-al6-m[a-]m(bul6/i)-umki, ARET I 4 rev. IV 9, where the reading -bu]6-um agrees with a value /mb/, -ì-um appears rather instead to represent a nisbe. For the interchange m/b in Sumerian, see P. Steinkeller, Aula Orientalis 2 (1984) 141-2. The alternation m/p is also attested in Anatolia, cfř. the GNs Hakmiš/Hakpiš; Takkumiša/ Takkupša; see E. von Schuler, Die Kaškāer (Berlin 1965) 101; it goes back neither to Hittite nor to Human. 9 The same mistake occurs also in TM.75.G.2616 rev. IV 6 for the PN I-nu-ud-ha-lam- (lamxkur). There are several errors made by the Ebla scribes, and some abnormal writing forms became usual, e.g. kul for bal in the DN dì-da-bal/ kul and udua for uzu (for the second alternation see Archi, forthcoming). See J. Krecher, in: Ebla 1975-1985 , 179-183.</page><page sequence="3">Studies in the Pantheon of Ebla 251 Euphrates had a goddess, Hepat, whose cult was widely diffused in the region. This goddess did not belong to any Semitic pantheon of the period, apparently be- cause she was considered extraneous by the Amorites, the new Semitic-speaking population which had settled down in that area10. The Hurrians made this goddess who was deeply rooted in the non-Amorite cultures their own and associated her with their Weather-god, Tešup, as his consort11. It is difficult to avoid the idea that Hepat can be traced back to Ha(l)abājtu. The passage from a to e in the first syllable could possibly be explained if the dis- appearance of / is due to a process of velarization; the loss of / has the same effect as the loss of h, ř and ģ in Akkadian: h/'/ģ &gt; ' &gt; 0 with a change a &gt; e ( GAG § 9a; e.g. OAlck. bďalum , OA be'ālum , OB bêlum "to rule")12.

Kammenhuber, Or 45 (1976) 143-144; V Haas, RHA 36 (1978) 65-66; Archi, in: Hittite and Other Anatolian and Near Eastern Studies in Honour of Sedat Alp (Ankara 1992) 12-14 (concerning the documentation from Emar). 12 E. A. Speiser, Introduction to Hurrian (AASOR 20; New Haven 1941) 41, had already noted that "All these irregularities [in writing the name of Hepat] make it probable that this name was not of Hurrian origin". In note 91 he adds: "The dropping of the final -t [in PNs like SAL7a- du-hé-pa , SALGe-lu-hé-pa] seems to point to a Semitic origin". For Pettinato, OA 18 (1979) 105, note 120: "La dea Hepat è attestata ad Ebla sotto la forma dHa-a-pà-tù ." However, "The Eblaites accepted at least four deities of the Hurrian pantheon: dÃdamma, dAštabi, sHepat and dIšhara". See Id., The Archives of Ebla : An Empire Inscribed in Clay (New York 1981) 251. The Hurrians, however, were not yet settled in Syria during the Ebla period. The opposite is true: the Hurrians received these gods from the Syrian populations which had preceded them. On this subject see Archi, "Substrate: Some Remarks on the Formation of the West Hurrian Pantheon", Studies S.

The Moon in the Dual The Eblaites had adopted the writing %n:zu used in Babylonia for Suinu, the Moon-god. The manuscripts A and B of the bilingual lexical lists have dEN:zi = Zu-i-nu ; D: dEN[:zi] = Zu-i-n[u]; C: dEN:zu = Zu-rP[-nu]n. The administrative documents have dEN:zu, with the exception of TM.75.G.1902 (text no. 4, below), which has dEN:su. 13 Cfr. MEE IV, p. 289 no. 799. The usual Pre-Sargonic writing inverts the order of the signs: dEN:zu, and the exceptions are few, see J. Bottéro, in: S. Moscati, Le antiche divinità se- mitiche (Studi Semitici 1; Roma 1958) 44-47; cfř. J. J. M. Roberts, The Earliest Semitic Pan- theon (Baltimore 1972) 48-50.</page><page sequence="5">Studies in the Pantheon of Ebla 253 The Eblaite gloss suggests a reading /suyln-u/, like the DN syn in Ancient South Arabian14. The same writing as in the gloss is attested in the PNs of two people from Kiš: Du-bí-zu-i-nu (TM.75.G.2426 obv. VI 17), ìr-am6-zu-i-nu (TM.75.G.2270 obv. X 7)15. In the scribal school at Ebla certain myths were known which had been devel- oped through contact with the Semites and Sumerians in southern Mesopotamia. dEN:zu appears in the myth ARET V 6, a tablet which is a copy of IAS 326+342 from Abū Salābīkh16. This fact must have had only a minimal impact on the cult. The administrative texts only mention dEN:zu rarely on the occasion of the registration of gifts and offerings. 1) TM.75.G.3858 (ARET III 769)+ obv.

In only one of the twenty-one lists of sheep-offerings preserved19, that is text no. 1, does Suinu (Suylnu) head the list of the gods.

It is likely that Suinu was introduced into that of- fering list because, in southern Mesopotamia, the Moon-god had the power to multiply cattle herds22, a belief which at Ebla seems to have referred only to sheep and not to cattle, as we see from the offering lists, which concern only the outlay of sheep. Nirar, a centre of the cult of Suinu according to text no. 2, was an independent city not far from Ebla23. According to text no. 3, Suinu had a priest who was also in the service of an- other deity (a fact attested also for other gods), the deified river Balih, which was considered as a couple, in that in its upper stretches the river is split in two24. The syntactic interpretation of text no. 4: "the 2 gods Suinu (of) the king" would appear certain25. The number which precedes the DN (2 sloping lines) in- dicates that here, as in text no. 5, the name is in the dual26. It is likely that the dual was suggested by the manner in which Suinu was represented and one thinks im- mediately of the crescent, the Moon-god's most frequent attribute27. Possibly in the cases in which we find 2 dEN:zu the god was represented only as a crescent moon and not as an anthropomorphic figure. Apparently, the Akkadian uskūru "crescent", a loanword from Sumerian u4- sakar28, was unknown at Ebla. Another name for the Moon-god is found in an incantation, ARET V 4 (4): en-ma ti-gi si-in zi-ne-éb-ti dUtu si-in 2 si dSa-nu-ga-run na- an!? nu-hi - mu-du "Thus (he says): 'do not bring t. to the beams of the Sun, n. to the two horns of Šanugaru!'" Parallel to this passage is ARET I V 1 (8): a-za-me-ga al6 zi-na-ba-t[i ] dUt[u] al6 su-lu-la-a 1 iti "I have bound you on the beams of the Sun, on the two horns of the Moon". 21 Iku(n)-Šamkan was the name of a king of Mari, MAM 3, 309, no. 1. In the two bullae found in the courtyard of a temple in Tell Brak one has to read anse and not dŠ am kan, as it was at first thought; see D. and J. Oates, Iraq 55 (1993) 164. 22 N. Veldhuis, A Cow of Sin (Library of Oriental Texts 2; Groningen 1991) 1, defines these beliefs in the following way: "Because of his horns, which are visible when the moon is waxing, he (the Moon-god) is often associated with cattle. 'Wild buir is one of his well- known epithets. On the other hand, in astrological texts the moon is frequently designated as a shepherd, the stars sometimes being the flock. In hymns the moongod is often given a pas- toral role, conveying fertility upon his cattle." 23 Nirar opens the lists of the city-states to which Ebla regularly delivered clothes; see ARET I, 224-225 and cfř. ARES II, 404-409. 24 2 dBa-li-ha appears in ARET V 4 II 5, 5 VII 7 and TM.75.G.10074 rev. XIV 9.

MaNE was located on the Euphrates not far from Emar. The principal di- vinity of MaNE was Išhara, dšÁRA-w, but it was also known as a "Lord", dBE (bďlu) of MaNE31. Šanugaru is perhaps to be identified with this "Lord", certainly not with Išhara32. The interpretation of the name is obscure: perhaps it belongs to the pre-Semitic substrate (the first part cannot derive from the root TN, Akk. šina , šanu because the series ša, ši, šu would have been used). Stephanie Dalley sug- gests identifying Šanugaru with Šangar(a)/Šaggar(a) of the 2nd millennium. This latter would seen to be a lunar deity according to the inscription on a seal from Emar, where the cuneiform Id30 -a-bi corresponds to the Hieroglyphic Hittite Sà- ga+rď-a-bu. In addition, in both Hittite and (Ugaritic-)Hurrian documents, this god is connected wth Išhara, KBo XXIX 213+ Vs. 11-12; RS 24.285, 13 ( Ugaritica V, 511)33. The entry dEN:zu was included in the bilingual lexical lists not because it re- fers to a Sumerian god but because of that peculiar writing in use in southern Mesopotamia. The god is rarely mentioned in the administrative documents. In or- der to have some points of reference one should consider that, excluding the of- fering lists, the Sun-god Utu is mentioned approximately 40 times and Šamkan no more than 15 times. The impact of the cult of Suinu at Kiš was certainly very dif- ferent: out of 33 PNs from Kiš noted in the Ebla texts, two contain Suinu34 while among the several hundred PNs relating to northern Syria we find only Lima- 29 This interpretation has been given by Fronzaroli, VO 1 (1988) 17, who refers to. Akk. ša- rüru "radiance, sunlight; shoot (of a plant)", Syr. šrūrā "shoot (of a plant)". For zi-ne-éb-ti / zi-na-ba-t[i' , which here has to mean something like "radiance", he quotes Ar. sanifa "hem (of a garment)" as well as Heb. sānīp "turban". 30 Edzard, ARET V, 20. 31 On MaNE, see ARES II, 379-380. 32 For the goddess Išhara at Ebla, see Archi, MARI 7 (1993) 71-78. 33 St. Dalley, Iraq 54 (1992) 90-91. Also see V Haas, Geschichte der hethitischen Religion (in press). The passage in KBo XXIX 213+ was pointed out to me by Doris Prechel who is prepa- ring a study of this deity. The fragment which joins KBo XXIX 213 has been published in tras- literation by H. G. Güterbock, in Florilegium Anatolicum: Mélanges offert à E. Laroche (Paris 1979) 138-142 (in line 12 Güterbock reads áTa-an-ga-ra instead of dŠa-, but the duplicate KBo XXI 42 I 24 has d&amp;z[-). For the PN from Emar, see E. Laroche, Akkadica 22 (1981) 11. M. Stol, On Trees, Mountains and Millstones (Leiden 1979) 75-80, discovered a deity Sag- gar/Šaggar as the reading of dHAR, identified by him with the Jebel Sinjār, and attested in the texts from Mari and Tell al-Rimah, as well as in some god lists and a Middle Babylonian literary text. This god is not to be confused with the Moon-deity Saggara from (Ebla and) Emar, attested in the zukru ritual, where he "occurs in conjunction with the second and fifteenth days of the month, also in connection with the evening, nubattu , and the deity Night, dmušītu ", as Dalley has remarked (p. 90); see D. Arnaud, Recherches au pays d'Astata: Emar VI.3 (Paris 1986) nos. 373, 11. 43, 192': i-na u4.15.kám i-na uA-mi Sa-ag-ga-ri/ru ; 375 1. 4: i-na uA-mi 15 dHAR-ar; 446 1. 45': i-na uA-mi 15 dHAR; nos. 373 1. 176': i-[na u4.]2.kám; 373 11. 114'-115': a-na áMu-š[i-ti ki.min] a-na áŠag-[ga-ar ki.min], 11. 182'-183': i-na pa-ni nu-ba-at-ti dŠa-ag-ga-ar. The king of Karkemiš of the time of Ashurnasirpal II and Shalmaneser III, Sa (n)gara, was named after this god. 34 See note 15.</page><page sequence="8">256 Alfonso Archi en:zu from Ibubu. On the other hand the great gods figure only rarely as part of an Eblaite PN. If Šanugaru was truly a Moon-god of the substrate civilization, his presence could have interfered with the cult of Suinu. However, the fact that a Suinu of Nirar exists and that the god was associated in some way with Balih shows that his cult was rooted in the area of Ebla and pro- bably not imported from Mesopotamia. Ebla therefore represents a third point be- side Babylonia and Hadramawt, in the geographical distribution of the cult of Sui- nu, a divinity who belonged to the common Semitic heritage35. Further, it is certain that Yarah was introduced into northern Syria by the Amorites, because the in- cantation ARET V 4 has dSa-nu-ga-rul2 instead of iti of the parallel version ARET V 1. via Montevideo 2A 1-00198 Roma 35 Lambert, OA 23 (1984) 43-44, has argued that the Moon-god worshipped at Ebla was d/- da-bal/K'JL because (L)arugadu was one of the major cult-centres of that god, and a Yrh of Lrgt is attested in the Ugaritic alphabetic texts. Contra: E. Sollberger, RA 82 (1988) 96; also see Lam- bert's rejoinder, RA 83 (1989) 96. The documentation presented here makes this supposition unlikely. Furthermore, the cult of Idabal, one of the great gods of Ebla, was diffused in a way which would be unusual for an astral deity. His main cult-centres were * A-ma-duki and Lu-ba-ank' besides (L)arugadu; and in his cultic journey the god passed through 39 localities; see Archi, SEb 1 (1979) 105-113.</page></plain_text>
