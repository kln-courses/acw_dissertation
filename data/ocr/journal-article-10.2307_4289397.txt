<plain_text><page sequence="1">HISTORIC PASSIONS Historic Passions is a regular feature in HWJ. Here writers from many fields recall the book (orfilm, or magazine, or exhibition) whichfirst awoke in them a sense of the historical. The engagement with the past is always personally motivated, and it is our hope that this feature will encourage writers and readers to reflect on the interplay between understandings of the self and representations of the past in the development of the historical imagination. THE STORY OF Davy Crockett By r4M LAMOmE MEAWCROFr Ilsatdby CAESB. FALS. PUBISHE.RS GroMet Dunlap NIzwToss Davy Crockett by Mlandy Mferck I learned to read very late. American educators of the '50s discouraged the teaching of reading to pre-school children, and when I finally arrived in the first grade, I found the prevailing phonetic system (in which you were supposed to learn the sound associated with each letter and then combine them) boring and difficult. Despite my mother's increasingly desperate injunctions to 'sound out' the words of The Squirrel Outside My Window, I would open each session with the same question: 'What's that squiggley letter again?' (Hysterical mother: 'S! Like a snake! SSSSS! - KWAA! - History Workshop Journal Issue 40 ?g History Workshop Joumnall995</page><page sequence="2">Davy Crockett 185 IRRR! - ELLL! SQUIRREL!) Maybe it was the book. As I recall, The Squirrel Outside My Window was somewhat short of plot points, and if it offered any squirrely characterizations, I would have rejected them. After an infancy spent listening to Wind in the Willows and The House at Pooh Corner, I was completely off anthropomorphic animals, or indeed any form of fantasy narrative, which I had come to regard as an adult condescension to children's credulity. My resulting disposition to realism manifested itself in an unusual attention to what semiologists call the iconic properties of the sign. I knew what things looked like (or, as I see now, what pictures of things looked like) and happily volunteered to illustrate all the phonics cards which decorated my first-grade classroom. I could scarcely read the word 'run', but I expertly rendered the flexed leg which I drew on the R card. And this ability maintained me in my teacher's esteem. I can still remember Mrs. Snodgrass's excited reaction to my clay rabbit, for (alone of all my peers) I had modelled its ears realistically along its back, rather than sticking up Easter Bunny style. But my antagonism to the symbolic, to the arbitrary connections of letters with meanings, had its drawbacks. First of all, I was illiterate. And secondly, the energy I might have expended on reading was diverted either into talking (which got me into trouble) or to art (which got me into even more trouble when I insisted on painting every single figure in the class's barnyard mural: the cows, the tractor, the horse in its harness, and certainly the fence, since no one else had mastered perspective). Fortunately for everyone, I left this school in 1954, when we moved from the centre of Salem, capital of the northwestern state of Oregon, to its suburbs. Our new street was in a postwar development of one-storey ranch houses, with large yards giving on to the last remnants of pasture (real cows now). It was named - quite wonderfully - Pioneer Drive. Through the 'picture window' of the period we could see the snow-topped peaks of the Cascades, the mountains which Oregon's original pioneers had traversed, and beyond that, further east, the direction of the past in American history. On December 15 of that year, ABC television broadcast the first episode of a three-part drama destined to transform children's culture across the world, Walt Disney's 'Davy Crockett, Indian Fighter'. I missed it. It wasn't until well into 1955 or '56 that my parents bought their first set, an ugly black and gilt box which they sequestered, for aesthetic reasons, in the bedroom I shared with my sister. Of course, I'd been watching television for years by then, inviting myself to Howdy Doody Time, and later Disney's Mickey Mouse Club, at various neighbours. But the Crockett trilogy went out in the Disneyland slot, dinnertime on Sunday evenings, and my memories are of snatched viewings, previews probably, and perhaps invitations cadged from households willing to sanction visitors on school nights. I couldn't get enough of it, and most of my contemporaries must have felt the same. The</page><page sequence="3">186 History Workshop Journal second and third episodes- 'Davy Crockett Goes to Congress' and 'Davy Crockett at the Alamo' - attracted an estimated 60 million viewers, more than a quarter of the country, to a children's programme. Its theme, 'The Ballad of Davy Crockett', became the number one song in the country in 1955, selling 18 million copies and engraving its tune, chorus and 'Born on a mountaintop in Tennessee' opening on the memory of my generation.' In Britain, the Crockett craze hit slightly later, but with no less impact. After a months-long publicity blitz in early '56, the film version of the TV trilogy, Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier, was released by Disney in April. By the following autumn, children all over the country had pro- duced enough Crockett jokes and song parodies to warrant a whole section of the Opies' 1960 Lore and Language of Schoolchildren. Among the more refreshing British takes on the theme was the motif (recorded in Great Bookham, Swansea and Romford) of 'Davy Crewcut, King of the Teddy Boys': Born on a roof top in Battersea Joined the Teds when he was only three Coshed a cop when he was only four And now he's in Dartmoor for evermore. (For variations involving matricide from Scotland and throat-slitting from Wales, see the Opies.)2 Actually, Disney's Davy, Fess Parker, who toured America and thirteen foreign countries in his oiled quiff and sideburns to push the film and hundreds of items of Disney-licensed Crockettabilia, did bear a remarkable resemblance to that other Tennessee Ted, Elvis Presley. Meanwhile, back in Oregon, I soon became the proud possessor of a Davy Crockett t-shirt, belt and officially branded jeans. The last were of a then unusual brown denim, and ultimately proved more phallic than the ring-tailed cap which I somehow failed to score. In the summer of '56, I was happily playing at home when my mother suddenly commanded us to get into the car that minute. 1956 saw one of the great polio scares in the U.S., and she had belatedly remembered the vaccine we were scheduled to receive at my new school, a big Catholic one downtown. I arrived there in an agony of embarrassment, wearing my Crockett jeans in front of my whole class. They were (you have to be my age to understand the horror of this), boys' jeans, jeans whose front zip proclaimed the gender of their wearer as powerfully as a jock strap. Girls' jeans in the '50s fastened at the side. My jeans (like much of the Crockett merchandise) were marketed ex- clusively for boys in a society whose sexual divisions seemed unbridgeable. Thanks to Walt Disney, I appeared at St. Joseph's Catholic Grade School in drag. Sometime around then I must have picked up the rudiments of reading. The literature at St. Joseph's was a real eye-opener after all those friendly little squirrels in my state school. Catholics went in for martyrdom in a big</page><page sequence="4">Davy Crockett 187 way, and American Catholic youth's favourite martyr of the '50s was Maria Goretti, an Italian girl who had reputedly performed a few miracles after her rape and murder at the age of 12. (Of course we weren't told she was raped. The Catholic comic book which retailed her heroic end maintained that she had died defending her virtue against a youth who wanted to show her a copy of Playboy. I often wondered whether I would die rather than read Playboy. Probably not, I decided.) Such stories had their sadomasochistic charms, but I can't remember really reading for pleasure until, at the beginning of third grade, I was given my final spin-off from the Crockett craze. Enid LaMonte Meadowcroft's The Story of Davy Crockett3 was one of a series of illustrated children's books called 'Names That Made History'. Most of its subjects were the predictable white American males, sup- plemented by a few international superstars like Mozart and Joan of Arc. The Story of Davy Crockett was originally published in 1952, and sold about 10,000 a year until 1955 and Disney's Davy, when the figure jumped to 300,000.4 I was one of those 300,000. My copy is inscribed for my eighth birthday, October 16, 1955. It was given to me by my mother's best friend since high school, a 'career woman' who lived in a high rise apartment in Portland and appeared on local television. I sat down in the big armchair in the living room and didn't get up until the book was finished. Then I went to the library and checked out The Story of Buffalo Bill, The Story of Daniel Boone, and The Story of Kit Carson. I also devoured a rival series called, if memory serves, 'The Childhood of Young Americans'. Indeed, I got so totally into reading that, a year or two later, my mother - noting my enthusiasm for the songs in the then hit musical, My Fair Lady - suggested that I try Shaw's Pygmalion (which I refused, assuming it was another of her infernal animal stores). What was it about The Story of Davy Crockett that engaged me so intensely? Obviously, the Disney tie-in was a huge factor. With my experience, I have a big investment in the television versus literacy debate. Not only do I regard TV as (here beginneth the Media Studies lesson) a complex textual system which inculcates and refines its own reading skills, but I am indebted to it for encouraging me to become (at last) lettered in the old-fashioned way. And it's interesting to note the stress that Meadowcroft lays on her subject's own educational difficulties. The ten-year-old Davy is appalled at the prospect of a school opening in his part of the woods, and later has ink spilled all over his exercise book by the class bully. It's not until page 102, when he's nearly 18 and about to get married, that he finally learns to 'read and write and figure'. Of course, the historical Crockett did have a reputation for illiteracy, including what must be one of the first recorded dependencies on Congressional speechwriters. This, combined with his origins as a child of an impoverished taverner, and his own notoriety for drinking, womanising and telling 'tall tales', made him into rather a different figure than the Disney Davy. Before his death in 1836, Crockett was well on his way to becoming a</page><page sequence="5">188 History Workshop Journal caricature rustic, whose comic exploits were retailed in almanacs, ballads and minstrel shows. Not until the 1870s did his image modulate into respectability when, as the wilderness receded and the myth of the American hunter took hold, his backwoods persona was converted into the chivalrous hero of stage melodrama, the unschooled-but-sensitive suitor who rescues an heiress from an arranged marriage.5 Meadowcroft's emphasis on Davy's early attempts to read rewrites the story again, this time as a Bildungsroman, history as the childhood of the Great. And, although my youthful enthusiasm for this genre eventually led me across the Atlantic to the young Lancelot and the young Mary of Scotland, the American bias in these stories must have enhanced their appeal. Not only did it add the attraction of national identification to that of age, but in The Story of Davy Crockett, it effectively combined them. Crockett was born in 1786, and Meadowcroft traces the parallel development of the young hero and the young country. When Davy is ten, Washington is just retiring from the Presidency, and as the Crocketts move westward, so do the nation's boundaries. The resulting identification of the hero (fittingly, a scout who becomes a legislator) with the new democratic state supports Franco Moretti's contention that youth in the Bildungsroman represents both mobility and modernity.6 Indeed, the Crockett legend, as commentators more critical than Meadowcroft have noted, became a rallying cry for Manifest Destiny, with his death attempting to wrest Texas from Mexico the perfect ending. But I was a child content to turn from religious to civic hagiography, and I scarcely noted the purple passages, like this one in which the young Davy attends a Fourth of July celebration: He didn't know much about his country. He didn't know how big it was or what lay beyond it. But something about that flag made him feel good all over. And he knew suddenly that his country would never do anything wrong if he could help it. (pp. 41-41) It's startling to learn now that, even in the dark days of Disneyland, the Crockett myth was subjected to intense ideological critique. Mark Derr surveys a wide range of political responses in '50s America, with a United Auto Workers official denouncing Davy's 'Be always sure you're right, then go ahead' individualism as anti-union, while the liberal editor of Harper's compared his cult of personality to that of Stalin. (Predictably, the American Communists replied by criticizing the liberals' disregard for native democratic traditions.)7 Meadowcroft's Fourth of July scene now seems to me a clear anticipation of Crockett's most strikingly conscientious act - not the defense of the Alamo in a dubious claim to Texas based on the Louisiana Purchase, but his Congressional opposition to the removal of the southeastern Indians from their lands east of the Mississippi. As Mea- dowcroft renders it,</page><page sequence="6">Davy Crockett 189 'A treaty's a promise', he declared, reaching for some butter. 'Not even President Jackson has a right to break a promise. And I'll fight against his Indian bill as long as I've a leg to stand on.' (p. 160) The result was political martyrdom for the Tennessee congressman, who lost both the vote and his seat in a state where Jackson the native son was hugely popular and the Cherokee, Choctaw and Chicasaw were not. I don't want to exaggerate my childhood commitment to this cause. To me Indians were overweight teenagers from the local reservation who silently ironed in the kitchens of my mother's friends and performed their dances in recitals which I found tedious. And Crockett's own stand was overdetermined by other political differences with Jackson, differences which Meadowcroft - needless to say - ignores. But I wonder if her 'Mickey Mouse history',8 as Mike Wallace characterizes the sanitised weltan- schauung of the Magic Kingdom, had its positive consequences. I'm thinking, of course, of the political movements of the late '60s, particularly the mobilisation against the war in Vietnam (and the few congressional figures who initially opposed it, including an Oregon Senator of some distinction called Wayne Morse). Much of my own feeling about that conflict could have been couched in Davy's terms, that the country wouldn't continue to do anything that wrong if I could help it. And, just as in the '50s, millions of my Coonskin contemporaries felt the same.
