<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Fractional Burial Custom in the Swat Valley and Some Connected Problems by Giorgio Stacul In the excavations in the graveyards of Loebanr, K?telai and Butkara II in the Swat Valley, different burial practices have been revealed. These are the primary or articulate burial, the secondary or fractional burial and the cremation or post-cremation burial (&gt;). The cases of secondary or fractional burial where the detached bones are found piled up, often with the skull on top of the pile, are relatively common. There are about eighty where the disarticulation of the bones can certainly not be attributed to accidental causes, such as the partial disturbance of the grave as a result of working the land either in antiquity or recently. In most cases the detached bones are found lying in the grave alongside another corpse in its natural anatomic form. In other cases the grave contains only a secondary, frac? tional burial where the bones are usually piled up. A possible explanation of such burials was put forward by E. Castaldi who suggested that they might be accounted for by the semi-nomadic life style of transhumant people who used to carry the bodies of their dead back to their country of origin. Accord? ing to Castaldi, the reasons for the practice of cremation also were similar, depending on the same conditions. That is to say, it was an expedient of the nomadic peoples during their seasonal migrations that enabled them to carry the remains of their dead more easily to the place chosen for the final burial (2). Successive studies have established the existence in the Swat Valley of numerous settlements ascribable to the cultures under examination, of which some are quite large and include signs of solid construction that clearly indicate the sedentary life of the peoples dwelling there. These studies, therefore, have cast serious doubts on the theory that more (*) G. Tucci, ? The Tombs of the Asvakayana Assakenoi?, EW, XIV, 1963, pp. 27-28; Ch. Silvi Antonini, ?

In consequence, other theories and other forms of funerary practices have been con? sidered. A simple explanation, easily acceptable in most cases, is that of family tombs or at least the practice of using the tombs more than once. This is the theory that seemed to be most acceptable in the case of graves containing two corpses, one whole and the other fractional and heaped up. The latter would have been put on one side to make room for the subsequent burial and, on being moved, the corpse would have become disarticulated. In particular the theory of the family tomb could be substantiated in the Swat Valley by the uniformity of type of the vases and funerary furnishings which, in the graves containing two or three bodies, can almost always be ascribed to the same period of time. Moreover, there exist more than twenty graves in which only one corpse was buried, where the position of the remains undoubtedly indicates fractional burial, where the manner of placing the bones indicates a precise pattern and where a careful placing of the skull on the top of the other bones can almost always be found (3). In similar cases, the theory of carrying the dead from a distant country having been excluded, the theory of a precise funerary ritual that foresaw a first provisional burial before the final one, can be envisaged. The possibilities in this case are the following: either the corpse was left in the open, exposed to the elements, and perhaps also to animals which were not slow to strip the bones, or it was buried twice ? once while waiting for decomposition to take place and a second time permanently. In the Swat Valley, the possibility of a double burial, perhaps involving the re? moval of the remains to another grave after the performance of a special ceremony, is sup? ported by the widespread existence of graves that are empty or which contain only some vases. There are twenty-seven cases in which the lack of skeletal remains can certainly not be attributed to disturbance of the grave (4). In similar cases a theory often considered is that of cenotaphs ? symbolic or com? memorative tombs of people who died far from their villages or whose mortal remains were lost. Here, however, it is necessary to make a distinction. In addition to those graves where no human bones were found, others have been recorded where, inexplicably, there was only a small quantity of single small bones such as phalanges or vertebrae (5). That is, it is not a question of cases where the scarcity of the remains can be ascribed (3) At Loebanr the graves nos. 49, 59, 94, 144, 156, 171; at K?telai nos. 5, 13, 36, 43, 44, 66, 128, 132, 165, 181, 186, 195, 205, 220; at Butkara II no. 18.

In two graves, nos. 88 and 221 at K?telai, a minute quantity of bones were collected in vases that were so small that they could not have contained even the body of a baby. The hypothesis that can be made from these facts is as follows: if a first burial took place prior to decomposition and then a second one of only the skeleton, presumably cleaned, the empty or almost empty graves can have been those used for the first burial, and not used again because they were considered defiled. Despite all this, they would always have played an important role in the funerary rites which would have justified the placing in them of single items of furnishing, usually consisting of a particular type of vase (8). Such a ritual ? if in fact carried out ? would perhaps have had certain pro? cedural and ideological affinities with the cremation ritual which, in the Sw?t Valley, involved only a partial burning of the bones. The discovery of many double and also triple placings of cremated bodies in the same jar (7), and also that of a grave with the remains of four cremated bodies reported at Timargarha in the nearby Panjkora Val? ley (8), indicates that prescribed collective ceremonies were probably held at regular in? tervals. In this case it is possible that the empty graves may also have been used to house corpses awaiting cremation. In this connection, it seems significant that the same kind of vases that normally distinguish the furnishings of the cremation graves, includ? ing the kind of anthropomorphic jar used in other cases only as urns are found in some graves that contain no bones or almost none (9). On the basis of the typology of the vases and the other furnishings, the chrono? logical and cultural classification of the graves under examination show that those without or almost without bones mainly belong to the most ancient period of utilization of the aforementioned graveyards (Period V in the sequence of the protohistoric cultures in the Sw?t Valley), with only few examples in the following period (Period VI) and in the late one (Period VII) (10). Graves containing only one fractional burial are found (8) More than half of the graves without skeletal remains and with furnishings contain only one or two vases of the type VT 18 (for the typology of the vases, see Silvi Antonini, Stacul, op. cit.).

The most ancient graves are those from Mundigak III, in the Helmand Valley, where there is evidence of a similar form of burial dating back to the end of the 4th millennium (12). The finds from the graveyard of N?l in South Baluchistan, where piles of heaped-up bones were found also inside vases, date back to the beginning of the 3rd millennium (13). In all probability some fractional burials from Burzahom in Kashmir, where the bones heaped up on the bottom of the graves were significantly painted with red ochre, be? long to the first half of the 2nd millennium (14). Ample evidence of this burial custom is to be found above all in the graveyard known as cemetery H of Harapp?, belonging to the period following that of the Indus Civilization. The last period of utilization of this graveyard gives evidence of the practice of the fractional burial of skeletal remains inside big jars where the skull is frequently found on top of the rest of the bones (15). In the areas of Central Asia south of the Aral Sea, there has been ample affirmation of the practice of fractional burial following exposure of the corpse (in the 1st millennium B.C.) alongside articulate burial and cremation. We think significant the fact that the number of secondary burials increased as the practice of cremation decreased (16). Abundant evidence of graveyards with fractional burial graves, ascribed to the proto historic age, has been found particularly in Eastern Europe. In Central Russia, grave? yards ascribed to the Balanovo Culture, of the Early Bronze Age, give evidence of a considerable proportion of secondary burials, with heaped-up bones, mainly those of chil? dren (17). In the same areas, during the successive Abasevo Culture, ascribed to the Middle Bronze Age, there have been found very many examples of graves containing headless corpses and others containing only skulls (18). Evidence has been found of secondary (u) See note 10. Graves ascribed to Period V: K?telai nos. 128, 181, 186, 195, 205, 220.

Fractional burial showing signs of the practice of bone stripping has also been found in graveyards ascribed to the Danubian Unetice Culture (22), while in the East Alpine areas graves ascribed to the Hallstatt Period containing complete skulls placed on remains of cremated bones suggest a mixture of re-exhumation and cremation practices (23). From the Julian Alps to the Volga there is a great deal of evidence for the practice of fractional burial from historical times almost down to the present day. Relatively re? cently evidence has come from various countries such as Slovenia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Serbia, Macedonia, Wallachia, Moldavia, Belorussia, Russia, etc. (24). We think it par? ticularly interesting especially where the ethnographic evidence has been able to cast light on aspects of the practice which inevitably escape archaeological research alone. In this way we know that in these countries the graves with heaped-up bones are evidence of a second burial and that the exhumation of the remains of the dead from the first graves could have taken place at varying distances of time from the death. In some countries and cultures it came after a period of years, in others after only some weeks (25). In certain cases, it was the practice to water the grave or to light a fire on it in order to hasten decomposition (26). The purpose of the exhumation was to wash the bones which were then re-buried, sometimes wrapped in a cloth, at other times with an attempt to reconstruct the natural anatomic form of the dead person (27). In such operations special attention was paid to the skull, which had a particular position in relation to the rest of the bones. In various cases, the presence of graves that were empty or contained only the clothes of the dead person suggested pro? visional graves where the body was placed while awaiting final burial (28). Information about fractional burial practised in fairly recent times comes to us also from the northernmost areas of present-day Pakistan, from regions where the Kafirs and Dardic tribes dwell. Here the corpse was first left exposed in a wooden coffin I.N. Bibikov, ? K voprosu o pogrebarnom rituale v Tripoli ?, Kratkie soobscenija Instituta istorii material*no) kuVtury, 1952, pp. 36-41.

Here too there is evidence of the practice of washing the bones before final burial C?). We are not able to ascertain whether the practice of exposure, of which there is evidence in Central Asiatic cultures south of the Aral Sea in the 1st millennium and for which evidence of recent usage has been found in the Gilgit and Chitral Valleys in North Pakistan, has any relation to the presence of the fractional burial graves in the proto historic graveyards of the Swat Valley. Here, as has been seen, certain archaeological data indicate that graves completely or almost without skeletal remains may have been used as temporary graves where the corpse was placed prior to a successive rite (burial of the skeleton alone or cremation). The fact that the empty graves can mainly be as? cribed to the ancient period of use of the graveyards under examination, while the frac? tional burials are mainly evidenced in the following period, could mean that the practice of temporary interment later gave way to that of exposure, as the Zoroastrian cult spread through the area of Iran. A sure fact that fits in with the evidence found south of the Aral Sea is that, in the course of the 1st millennium, the practice of fractional burial be? came more frequent in the Swat Valley, as the practice of cremation was gradually aban? doned. And this fact can probably be related to well-defined influences of the North Iranian cultures of the western areas of the Indo-Pakistan sub-continent for which there is abundant archaeological evidence (31). * * * As is known, a team of archaeologists from the University of Peshawar has exca? vated a group of graves in the Panjkora Valley in the Dir District (32), which are very similar to those excavated in the nearby Sw?t Valley and belong to the same proto historic periods. A.H. Dani's interpretation of the data obtained from these digs differs on various points from the data we were able to obtain in the Sw?t Valley. This may lead to the idea that the funerary practices and furnishings found in the Sw?t Valley are very different from those recorded in nearby Dir. Believing that we must exclude such a possible interpretation, we think it necessary to give further explanation on the subject. A.H. Dani labelled the protohistoric graves of Dir and Sw?t the "Gandh?ra Grave Culture". He classified those of the Timargarha graveyard in Dir into three successive (29) G.S. Robertson, The Kafirs of the Hindu Kush, London, 1896, p. 504; P. Snoy, Die Kafiren. formen der Wirtschaft und geistigen Kultur, Frankfurt, 1962, pp. 188 f.; Jettmar, op. cit., pp. 69 f.; M.

Dani (ed.), Timargarha and Gan dhara Grave Culture, (Ancient Pakistan, III, 1967, Special Number), Peshawar, 1968. 328</page><page sequence="7">periods, each one marked by different funerary rites: the most ancient with complete inflexed burial, the successive one with cremation and the last one marked by the prac? tice of fractional burial (33). The total period during which the graveyard was used goes from around 1600 to 550 B.C. Let us first of all state that in our opinion the label "Gandhara Grave Culture" is unsuitable. Firstly, because we believe that what are merely cultural aspects referring to funerary practice cannot be defined as a culture, as other scholars have already pointed out (34). Secondly, because we consider it premature, at least, to ascribe to only one culture what may be cultural aspects that mark different successive cultures. The fact that the graves are located in the same cemetery is not enough to prove that the graves them? selves belong to the same culture. As it has never been considered right to use the label "Giy?n Culture" or "Siyalk Culture" when referring to the Iranian graveyards of Giy?n and Siyalk (but Giy?n I, Giy?n II, Siyalk VI, Siyalk V), we likewise consider it would be methodologically wrong ? at least for the moment ? to postulate a single culture for the protohistoric graves of Dir and Sw?t. As far as dividing the graves into three periods is concerned, it must be pointed out that Dani's classification is not based on stratigraphic data (35), or on relative chron? ology of the graves (such as the even multiple superimposing of bodies found in the Sw?t graveyards), or even on statistical calculations concerning the way in which the vases and other objects found in the actual graves were associated. This classification is based upon the assumption that the graves ? have revealed three distinct periods with three different rituals ?. Such a classification inevitably resulted in a confusion rather than a distinction of the periods. This confusion is shown by the fact that the same type of vases and objects are found in the graves that Dani placed in the ancient, middle and also late periods, as if the typology of funerary furnishings had undergone no change whatsoever in the course of over a millennium (36). Even in the absence of stra (33) Ibid., pp. 1-48. C34) Gupta, op. cit., pp. 146 f. (35) Dani (ed.), op. cit.y pp. 61 f. The possible stratigraphic classification of some single graves ? what is more, made unclear by successive disturbances of the soil, see fig. 2 ? does not present reliable elements in support of the chrono? logical classification proposed. (36) I mention only a few examples from the Timargarha graveyard. The bowl-on-stand (type VT1, according to Silvi Antonini, Stacul, op cit.) is found in grave no. 1 CO with flexed burial (p. 125, fig. 22.15), in grave no. 1 LO with fractional burial (p. 126, fig. 23.26), in grave no. 122 with post-cremation burial (p. 127, fig. 24.2,3). The medium-sized drinking goblet (type VT18): in grave no. 1 CO with flexed burial (p. 125, fig. 22.12), in grave no. 254 with frac tional burial (p. 144, fig. 41.3), in grave no. 116b with post-cremation burial (p. 130, fig. 27). The tall drinking vase (type VT 21): in grave no. 2 Bl with flexed burial (p. 124, fig. 21.7), in grave no. 254 with fractional burial (p. 143, fig. 40.5), in grave no. 240 with post-cremation burial (p. 140, fig. 37.3). The open-mouthed drinking cup with flaring rim (type VT 31): in grave no. 1 Bl with flexed burial (p. 124, fig. 21.3), in grave no. 3 LO with fractional burial (p. 126, fig. 23.33), in grave no. 150 with post cremation burial (p. 130, fig. 27). The tall drinking vase with concave sides (type VT 20 I): in grave no. 1 Bl with flexed burial (p. 124, fig. 21.5), in grave no. 3 LO with fractional burial (p. 126, fig. 23.30), in grave no. 218 with post-cremation burial (p. 140, fig. 37.2). The hand-made cooking pot (type VT 13): in grave ho. 2 Bl with flexed 329</page><page sequence="8">tigraphic differentiations or the superimposing of graves, there was still a system that would have avoided such a confusion: the statistical examination of the relationships between the various kinds of finds. If this method had been applied, it would have immediately established two things: that in Timargarha too, different funerary rites were practised during the same periods of time and that the differences between the furnish? ings of the different periods are sufficient to indicate the possibility of real cultural dif? ferences. The archaeological data obtained from the graveyards of the Sw?t Valley have recently been confirmed by and found further possibilities of more exact identification in the stratigraphic sequence of Aligr?ma. These data have undoubtedly shown that certain kinds of vases and objects were in use only in certain periods of time and that the modifications made ? above all to the pottery ? are clear and exact. The excavation of the graves has shown that cremation was more common than articulate or fractional burial in Period V. Articulate burial is prevalent in Period VI, while there is a considerable decrease in the proportion of post-cremation burials and an increase in fractional burials. During Period VII articulate burial was clearly the most common, accompanied by iso? lated cases of cremation burial. There are, however, various cases of probable frac? tional burial belonging to the last period. We have not taken these examples into account as we are not sure whether the fact that the bones are disarticulated re? flects a specific ritual practice or whether it is simply a result of the grave having been disturbed. The recent discovery by the Archaeological Department of Pakistan of the graveyard of Zarif Kor?na, near Warsak, has shown that inhumation and cremation graves with furnish? ings closely resembling those found in the protohistoric graveyards of the Sw?t, Dir and Buner Valleys are also to be found in the great plain around the modern centre of Pe? shawar (37). These discoveries confirm the validity of our previous comparison between burial (p. 124, fig. 21.6), in grave no. 1 LO with fractional burial (p. 126, fig. 23.28), in grave no. 119 with post-cremation burial (p. 129, fig. 26.3). And the list does not finish here. In the Swat Valley all the types of vases mentioned above belong only to the most ancient period (Period V) of utilization of the graveyards. (37) In a brief account of the excavation carried out at the protohistoric graveyard of Zarif Kor?na, near Warsak, about 18 miles northwest of Pesha? war, Dr M. Rafique Mughal writes: ?The materials from Zarif Karuna are comparable with those from Dir and Swat valleys where they are dated by Radiocarbon and on typological grounds to the middle of the second and the early first millennium B.C. Both Prof. A.H. Dani and Dr. Stacul have drawn parallels of the grave materials as found in northern Pakistan with those from several sites of Iran namely, Hissar II B to III C, Shah Tepe II b, Tureng Tepe, Marlik, and even further west, with Hasanlu V to III A. These comparisons may lose their chronological significance and also cultural-historical implications in view of an obvious "hiatus", of half a mil? lennium or less, between the end of Hissar III C (1841 ? 65 B.C.) and the beginning of the "Early Iron Age" (1400 B.C.) on the Iranian plateau. Thus, the theories built upon such paral? lels may call for reconsideration ? (PkA, 8, 1972, pp. 125, 126). In this respect, the followings points may be noted: 1) The pottery ware from the Sw?t Valley compared with shapes of Tepe His?r come from some graves of Loebanr and K?telai ascribed to Period V. This pottery shows some close typo 330</page><page sequence="9">types of vases and objects found in the graveyards of Sw?t and types found in the deepest layers of Ch?rsadda (M). In this connection we can also point out that the recent excavations of the Aligr?ma settlement have shown that nearly all the ceramic types found by Wheeler in layers 51 - 44 of Ch?rsadda I and in layers 11 - 9 of Ch?r? sadda IIIA are similarly shaped to those commonly found in the Sw?t Valley in Period V. And since iron objects were also found in these layers in Ch?rsadda, it is clear that there is evidence for the working of iron in the north-west of the sub-continent much earlier than once thought, i.e., around 1000 B.C., and perhaps even earlier (39). Some types of vases common in the last period of the Sw?t graveyards are, instead, compar? able to shapes found in layers 38 - 36 of Ch?rsadda IC40). The period to which Wheeler ascribed these layers ? from about the 4th-3rd century B.C. ? agrees with the data obtained in the Sw?t Valley, as some C14 datings tend to indicate too. However, the date indicated by Dani for the termination of the use of the Timargarha graveyard, where also many graves with furnishings just like those found in Sw?t and ascribed to Period VII there, seems to us to be altogether aprioristic. The date indicated ? the middle of the 6th century B.C. ? has not been deduced on a basis of cross-dating or results of analyses with C14 and ascribed to some of the graves of the above-mentioned last period, but results only from the hypothesis that the invasion of the Achaemenids would have wiped out every trace of the preceding cultures in Gandh?ra (41). But even this is a postulation that has not been confirmed by archaeological data. The doubts expressed on the interpretation of the archaeological data collected at Timar? garha, in particular as far as the dating of the graves is concerned, is not intended to belittle the results of the excavations in this graveyard, where the work, so carefully carried out, can be seen from the descriptions by A.H. Durrani, A. Rahman and M. Sharif C42). The funerary furnishings which have been illustrated in publications, show typological classes very similar to those found in the Sw?t Valley. This, in our opinion, underlines the fact that we are faced with certain cultural aspects that were diffused over vast areas of the north-west of the sub-continent at the same period. More recently, logical affinities with pottery shapes distinctive of the preceding Period IV (see note 31). 2) A charcoal sample collected at Aligr?ma in an archaeological layer ascribed to Period IV has been dated 1690-1710 B.C. (P - 2152). Nor is there a significative "hiatus" with the date ascribed to the end of Tepe His?r IIIC. 3) In any case, the typological parallels be? tween some pottery shapes of Swat and Tepe His?r are indicative ? for the moment ? of a common stylistic horizon only, while they do not consent deductions about some possible cultural or ethnical affinities. 4) As regards the typological parallels with Marlik and Hasanlu V-III A, they are related obviously to different subsequent periods.

Dani in the Gomal Valley, in northern Baluchistan, have brought to light cremation graves furnished with vases which have many similarities with types found in the protohistoric graveyards of the Swat and the Dir Valleys (43). The dis? covery takes on particular importance ? especially bearing in mind the stratigraphic positions of these graves in respect to earlier cultures of which evidence has been found on the same site ? so that we are certain that extension of the research in this area would lead to a further contribution to the deeper knowledge of the cultures and of the funerary practices which have been the subject of the present study.
