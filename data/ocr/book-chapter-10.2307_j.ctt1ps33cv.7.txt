(Venter) the twentieth century saw many attempts at social engineering in order  to change the face of humanity, just as industrialization and progress  in the natural sciences had proven to change the face of the earth in  the nineteenth century. For Bauman, the idea of ‘adjusting the “is”  of the world to the human-made “ought”’ (Living 150) is not a new  endeavor; indeed, creating a ‘new man’ (or ‘new woman’) has been  on the agenda since the beginning of modernity – witness the origins  of science fiction in shelley’s Frankenstein and the literary musings on  automata, homunculi, and posthuman races in many a well-known story,  from E.t.a. Hoffmann’s ‘the sandman’ (1816) to Goethe’s Faust (1808). For lack of scientific knowledge about the animating principles of  life, though, most human engineering of the twentieth century (in  contrast to its fictional mirror) had to content itself with experiments  on the social scale, attempting to engineer better social bodies by  ‘cultivation’ of specific traits and the ‘elimination’ of other, less desirable  aspects: atrocities such as ethnic cleansings, eugenics, or some of the  inhuman machineries of concentration camps and gulags were the  results. in the solid modern stage, these attempts at ‘mastery over fate,’  at shaping humanity according to specific plans, were representative  of governments, ‘with their powers of coercion institutionalized in  the state, that stood for the “human species” capable of accomplishing  collectively what humans individually went on trying to do with little  prospect of succeeding’ (Living 150). But as state power waned and a  liquid modern society came to be, social engineering and ‘adjusting the  “is”’ became the responsibility of the private sector and the individual:  119 </page> <page sequence="2"> 120 Biopunk Dystopias ‘Like so many other aspects of human life in our kind of society, the  creation of a “new man” (or woman) has been deregulated, individu- alized, and subsi diarized to individuals, counterfactually presumed to be  the sole legislators, executors and judges allowed inside their individual  “life politics”’ (Bauman, Living 148). in addition to shifting all human engineering from the public to  the private sectors of society, liquid modernity also saw an increase in  scientific knowledge and its potential to ‘understand life and perhaps  even to redesign it’ (Venter). Biotechnology, as imagined by Haldane, has  made twenty-first-century reality science-fictional in that it emphasizes  the dimension of possibility, rapidly closing the gap between what is  possible and what is only imaginable (Csicsery-Ronay, Seven Beauties  3). Creating life in the geneticist’s laboratory is no more the feat of sf’s  Doctor Moreau or Victor Frankenstein, but has become reality in Craig  Venter’s fully artificially assembled bacteria or genetically engineered  creatures such as Eduardo kac’s glow-in-the-dark bunny alba – the  possibility of getting from there to a fully realized posthuman life seems  only gradual and a matter of time, money, and the willingness to ignore  the science-fictional dimension of consequence. no wonder, then, that sf’s earliest incarnation and the paradigm  myth for scientific hubris in creating an artificial human being, Mary  shelley’s novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Pro metheus, first published in  1818, has found a thought-provoking, posthumanist reading in Vincenzo  natali’s 2009 film Splice. its appropriation of the material to liquid modern  realities is a mythopoeic investigation into the cultural needs specific  to its contemporary audience, its anxieties and dominant discourses.  Director Vincenzo natali positions the film along the fault line of horror  and science fiction when he refers to Splice as ‘a creature movie for adults  because it pays homage to all the things that one would expect from a  Frankenstein kind of story’ (‘Behind the scenes’), nonetheless arguing  for a more nuanced reading that ‘hopefully breaks new ground [...] with  the emotional relationship with the creature’ (cited in Captain). the film  thus negotiates not only the science-fictional dimension of possibility in  terms of a posthuman being, but also the dimension of consequence in  terms of the commitments involved towards the newly created life and  towards society as a whole. as the film is not widely known, a brief summary might be in order:  Splice presents the story of two genetic engineers and their experiment  of creating a human–animal hybrid through Dna resequencing. Clive  (adrian Brody) and Elsa (sarah polley), the young and ambitious  scientists, succeed in their experiment and then raise their creation in the  lab, while hiding her from their employers. Dren (abigaile Chu/Delphine  </page> <page sequence="3"> sCiEnCE, FaMiLy, anD tHE MonstRous pRoGEny 121 Chanéac), the hybrid being, evolves and grows through mutation, at some  point becoming uncontrollable in the lab environment. Clive and Elsa  secretly move Dren to an old farmhouse and become more and more  conflicted over the ethical implications of the experiment, shattering  their own relationship in the process. When Dren rebels against her  captivity, Elsa’s own abusive childhood resurfaces and a struggle erupts in  which Dren is mutilated and traumatized. the film concludes with Dren  evolving, mutating, changing expression of biological sex, and becoming  predatory, killing Clive and impregnating Elsa before being killed. as can be seen from this short paragraph, the film takes Frankenstein’s  creation story and adapts it to twenty-first century themes, reworks it  to fit the biopunk cultural formation. Splice is an ideal example of a  posthumanist negotiation of scientific consequences within the liquid  modern world. But before i discuss the science-fictional dimension of  consequence, a consideration of the film’s appropriation of the story in  terms of its creation of posthuman life, its form and function, will prove  to be a necessary and important first step in the analysis. 4.1 The Monstrous and the Posthuman When Vincenzo natali describes his film as a ‘creature movie,’ he is  most likely unaware of the critical implications such a label might bring  with it, and that for example film critic Vivian sobchack has devoted a  whole chapter in her book Screening Space to the demarcation of the sf  and the horror genre and films such as his. sobchack points out that  there are ‘frequent cases of congruence’ between the two genres and that  this liminal position, this ‘miscegenation,’ is mostly inhabited by ‘what  we commonly call the Monster or Creature film’ (30). the difference  between horror and sf lies, according to sobchack, in the genres’  respective emphasis on the personal or societal exploration of limits,  and the restoration of the natural or human-made order of things. the  creature film disturbs this either/or binary in that it gradually connects  the two genres, from the ‘Monster’ of horror films to the ‘Creature’  of science fiction: Whereas horror movies emphasize anthropomorphic  monsters, with their own moral struggles and personalized relationships  towards both world and hero, physically deformed but ultimately  human-like and thus comprehensible, the sf creature is only physically  present, as depersonalized abjection, soulless, dispassionate, and without  particularity (sobchack 30ff.). the monster is ideally represented in  Frankenstein’s creation – struggling to become human, to find its  place in life, and from an audience-response perspective ultimately  </page> <page sequence="4"> 122 Biopunk Dystopias garnering some measure of sympathy, and being given a dominant  part in the storyline – whereas the creature is more like the swarm of  mutated insects that destroys human society and is motivated only as  the incomprehensible force of nature’s wrath. Dren, the human–animal  hybrid of Splice, is thus not, as natali’s uncritical comment makes her  out to be, a creature. But neither is she solely the allegorical represen- tation of man falling from grace, the ‘darker side of Man and therefore  comprehensible’ (sobchack 32). sobchack’s horror film monster is predicated on early Hollywood  examples such as James Whale’s Frankenstein (1931), tod Browning’s  Dracula (1931), or George Waggner’s The Wolf Man (1941), and as such  needs to be understood only as a first step towards the cultural function  of the monstrous today. the monster remains a metaphor for moral  struggle, but it becomes much more, as Jeffery Cohen argues, by the  end of the twentieth century, as ‘we live in a time of monsters,’ in a  society saturated with anxiety and insecurities, which manifest ‘sympto- matically as a cultural fascination with monsters  – a fixation that is born  of the twin desire to name that which is difficult to apprehend and to  domesticate (and therefore disempower) that which threatens’ (viii).  and for Marina Levina and Diem-My t. Bui the continual changes of  the twenty-first century and liquid modern reality, with its ‘increased  mobility of people, technologies, and disease[,] have produced great social,  political, and economic uncertainty’ (1), resulting in an omnipresence  of monstrous categories not just in the cultural imagination but in life.  Levina and Bui argue that ‘monstrosity has transcended its status as a  metaphor and has indeed become a necessary condition of our existence  in the twenty-first century’ (2). the monstrous produces meaning not  simply as a liminal object, a metaphorical other, but as a ‘fluid category  concerned with representation and ambiguity of change’ (Levina and  Bui 5), especially in its naturalization of a posthuman ‘becoming’ of a  new subjectivity. Splice elaborates this specific condition of twenty-first-century liquid  modern reality as monstrous in that it positions Dren as multiple  and hybrid subjectivity, eliminating any option for categorial binaries  – human/animal, animal/plant, human/posthuman, natural/cultural,  natural/artificial, male/female, prey/predator. as Cohen points out,  monsters ‘are disturbing hybrids whose externally incoherent bodies  resist attempts to include them in any systematic structuration’ (J. Cohen  6). Dren is thus becoming-posthuman, becoming-animal, becoming- monster: she represents ‘categorial ambiguity, ontological instability’  and is created ‘through hybridization [...] the confusion of species [...]  the conflation of genders and genres’ (Weiss 124). </page> <page sequence="5"> sCiEnCE, FaMiLy, anD tHE MonstRous pRoGEny 123 the film introduces Dren as a creation of genetic engineering, her Dna  a composite of human, animal, and plant genes. after having successfully  spliced two hybrid creatures (non-anthropomorphic, incomprehensible,  and abject – amorphous blobs called Ginger and Fred) from seven distinct  life forms, Clive and Elsa decide to test their theories by ‘implementing  human Dna into the hybrid template.’ But while the film does not specify  the genetic traits, their original donor species, or the internal ratio of the  mix, in a scene in the film the scientists visualize the genetic make-up  of the creatures to consist of Dna taken from a bird, a horse, a fish, a  kangaroo, a lizard, a snail, and some part of a plant – assuming the icons  in the film’s presentation represent actual species and are not abstract  representations of some taxonomic ranks (inconsistently displayed). the film already enacts Dren’s creation as cyborgian in Haraway’s  sense, ‘ambiguously natural and crafted’ (‘Cyborg Manifesto’ 149), by  stressing this nature/culture duality in its representation of the laboratory  work: on the one hand, the time-consuming and precise scientific  process of splicing genes becomes pop culture, taking on a CSI feel in an  action montage under scored with hip techno music. the tedious process  of several days and nights is reduced to less than two minutes’ screen  time. But technoscience and its artificiality cannot complete the task  on their own: the Dna strands will not fuse. Clive lashes out in his  frustration against the techno music: ‘this retarded fascist uber-musik  is the problem! it’s got us thinking in circles’ (natali, terry, and taylor  17). He switches music: in the film, an organic and warm jazz sound  fills the room and Elsa is inspired. in the original movie script the roles  are reversed (Elsa is frustrated, Clive gets inspired) and instead of jazz  music, ‘the room warms up under the gentle strains of FRank sinatRa  crooning CoLE poRtER’s, “unDER My skin”’ (natali, terry, and  taylor 18). the result is the same: the two have ‘been dancing to the  wrong beat’ (as Elsa says in the film) and now the fusion holds. in  keeping with the musical metaphor, Elsa exclaims, ‘they’re changing  partners!’ and Clive joins in: ‘Everyone dances with everyone’ (natali,  terry, and taylor 18–19). the techno music and its artificial, cold,  repetitive, and circular motions are not conducive to the creative process;  instead the warm, organic, and free-ranging motions of jazz – even more  so than the lyrically meaningful porter song – allow for the process to  work. the almost seductive and sensual quality of the music, evocative  of a date and sexuality, is transferred onto the scientific process. the  Dna fusion becomes a dance, a fertility ritual with changing partners,  writhing to the sounds of jazz music. Dren’s ontology is both monstrous and posthuman, continuously  changing and ‘becoming’ in that she needs to develop from single  </page> <page sequence="6"> 124 Biopunk Dystopias cell to fully grown organism. When she is born, she is still a larva,  in a protective flesh cocoon, which she quickly sheds to mutate  into a mixture of bird and rodent (probably a manifestation of bird  and kangaroo Dna). Her development through different ‘ages’ is  presented in the film through evolu tionary mutations – drastic physical  reactions to her protean ability. Her posthumanity needs to evolve in  mutational bursts out of earlier, more primitive stages. as such, Dren  embodies the monstrous in her ‘ontological liminality’ (J. Cohen 6),  resisting any hierarchical categorization. she epitomizes the monstrous  posthuman and the film exploits our reactions towards such a concept  in all its contradictions by evoking familiarity, fascination, horror, and  abjection. as a signifier, Dren’s monstrous self represents a rejection  of the privileged humanist notion of ‘us’ by stripping the human  of its essentialist features (Herbrechter 47–48) and undermining  ‘our’ understanding of species boundaries. Dren makes explicit the  posthuman realization that ‘the human is always already evolving with,  constituted by and constitutive of multiple forms of life’ (nayar 2). as such,  the film culturally negotiates a ‘zoe-centric approach’ to posthumanism,  reconceptualizing life not as bios but instead as zoe: ‘Living matter  – including the flesh – is intelligent and self-organizing, but it is so  precisely because it is not disconnected from the rest of organic life  [...] [Life is] process, interactive and open-ended’ (Braidotti 60). the film addresses Dren as a posthuman for the first time when she  is still characterized both as non-human animal (because she resembles  a rodent–bird hybrid) and as inhuman (in Lyotard’s ‘second’ sense of the  term as inhabiting ‘what is “proper” to humankind’ (2)). she has not  been culturally conditioned to shed ‘the obscure savage ness of childhood’  and has not grown into ‘the condition of humankind’ (Lyotard 4) – a  notion we have already seen in the last chapter reflected in the Crakers  – and is thus not depicted as fully human, but represents something  that goes ‘beyond’ these categories. in projec ting subjectivity for the  hybrid, the film openly engages in a ‘process of humanization’ of the  repressed others of humanism: ‘animals, gods, demons, monsters of all  kinds’ (Herbrechter 9). When Elsa and Clive try to kill the monstrous splice after the initial  phase of the experiment, they discover its metamorphosis from larva  into its next evolutionary stage and the film emphasizes its dominant  parent–child motif (more on that later). the scene begins with a typical  horror scenario: Elsa hears something in the lab, signaling for help, but  Clive in the control room does not notice her. in a rapid succession of cuts  between close-ups of the frantically breathing Elsa and her point-of-view  shots, restricted by the gas mask she is wearing, the movie orchestrates  </page> <page sequence="7"> sCiEnCE, FaMiLy, anD tHE MonstRous pRoGEny 125 the establishing shot of Elsa bonding with the splice   (screenshot: Splice, © universum, 2010). a surprise moment when we see the splice hanging from the ceiling,  Elsa turning around to face it. a hard cut brings us face to face with  the screeching splice opening its maw (filmed in an extreme frontal  close-up), before it chases through the lab, jumping over equipment and  leaving behind a wake of chaos. Editing and mise-en-scène here clearly  indicate that we are to read this as an encounter with the monstrous,  with the inhuman other – up to this point, we would clearly side with  Clive, who wants to kill the potential threat. But this is where the scene shifts. the splice hides behind a container,  first seen as just a shadow, then slowly emerging from the protective  cover, whiskers and snout visible. it squeaks, more threatened than  threatening, and Elsa’s mothering instincts take over. she ignores safety  protocols, shedding the protective gear of gas mask and gloves to thwart  Clive’s plan to gas the room. she kneels down, bringing her closer to  eye level with the life form, and tries to bond with the splice based on  an instinctive mutuality of fear and pain in this situation. a slow-paced, low-angle shot of Elsa kneeling and extending her  hand, followed by a close-up of the splice emerging from its hiding spot,  immediately change the fast-paced action scene of the flight reaction  before shifting into an intimate moment of mother–child bonding, or  as Elsa calls it, ‘imprinting.’ this encounter of both species is then  presented visually as closely resembling that of typical human–human  interaction: first an establishing shot from a sideways position in which  Elsa remains still and the splice jumps forward, advancing towards Elsa’s  hand. then a shot/reverse-shot combo of Elsa observing the splice and  </page> <page sequence="8"> 126 Biopunk Dystopias the splice feeling Elsa with its whiskers, all of the shots slightly tilted  to account for difference in height but slowly zooming in to signal the  lessening of distance between the two. this intimacy breaks up when  Clive comes into the room, out of focus behind Elsa, in order to drag  her out while keeping the hybrid at bay with a broom stick. Here the  scene stays close to the splice’s perspective, camera focus changing to  acknowledge Clive seen above Elsa’s shoulder and then opening to a  wider and higher shot in a fixed position above its eye level of the  two figures retreating, before cutting to a zoom out away from the  creature, while the door closes into the frame, before the camera is  left in darkness. Just as important as the visual cues that recognize the subjectivity of  the hybrid being by changing to its perspective and incorporating it in  a conversational shot is the sound design of the latter part of the scene,  because it elicits large parts of its effect. on the one hand the splice can  be heard cooing and warbling while it is bonding with Elsa – emitting  a soundscape that encompasses animal noises like sniffing, clicking,  and chirping as well as more vocalized sounds like bird calls or some  similar to those of a human infant. these sounds invite our adoration,  eliciting feelings of sympathy as we realize that it is hurt, frightened,  and helpless. the animal/child noises are designed to emphasize the  community of non-human and human in a scene strongly reminiscent  of mother–child bonding or the care of young animals, as well as to  provide a feeling of familiarity with the non-human. When Clive moves  into the room and the splice feels threatened, though, the soundscape  shifts dramatically to snarling, growling, and hissing. these sounds  combined with defensive gestures, such as a display of jaws, crouching  attack position, and prominent stinger movement, shift the atmosphere  once more back to a tension, but this time our sympathies are divided.  it is Clive that is acting in a threatening manner, disturbing the familial  scene between Elsa and the splice. Clive is the intruder into this caring  display and the splice’s reaction seems normal, justified. the long dolly  out away from the scared hybrid, screeching once more in confusion,  and the door blackening the screen leave us emotionally sympathetic  with the splice. the film, in evoking both familiarity and repulsion, cinematically  suggests that in the posthuman we see ourselves and the monstrous  other at the same time, thus laying bare our notions of humanist  subjectivity, while simultaneously inviting a posthuman zoe-centric  subjectivity. this challenge to our established notion of subjectivity  becomes even more prominent when the human Dna grows more  dominant as the splice shifts, morphs, and changes according to its  </page> <page sequence="9"> sCiEnCE, FaMiLy, anD tHE MonstRous pRoGEny 127 hybridized genetic make-up. When her human side begins to show,  Elsa names the splice Dren and starts to teach her as a mother would  a human child, thus very strongly undercutting any anxieties about the  monstrous nature of Dren and strengthening the sympathetic connection  of the viewer with Dren. nevertheless, Dren remains unsettling whenever non-human aspects  of her nature come to the fore. Here, it needs to be pointed out, though,  that the non-human aspects cannot simply be grouped together as being  ‘animal’ or ‘animalistic.’ in accordance with a human–animal studies  perspective (in its approach close to critical posthumanism), one needs  to consider ‘the specific ity of non-human animals, their nongeneric  nature (which is why, as Derrida puts it, it is “asinine” to talk about “the  animal” in the singular)’ (Wolfe, ‘all too Human’ 567). the grouping  of all animals (apart from the human) into a single category functions  only to uphold humanist notions of singu larity and difference. as nik  taylor points out, ‘similarity, difference, and significance’ are ascribed  to animals only extrinsically with regard to humans – ‘constructing a  hier archy of animal importance’ (3–4) that is used to justify different  discourses for (and treatment of), for example, companion species and  farm animals, or mammals on the one hand and amphibians, reptiles,  and insects on the other. since Dren’s genome is somewhat blindly engineered from eight  different species – seven from the kingdom of animalia (six vertebrates,  one mollusk), one from plantae – the film makes it obvious that no  specific traits can be isolated and linked to one of the donor species.  it’s not a pick-and-mix process, where the geneticists decide upon a  trait and implement it. the mutational power of the organism and the  unpredictable influences of genes across different species are drastically  enacted in the film with Ginger and Fred, who start out as female and  male of their genetically created new species. Without the geneticists’  knowledge Ginger exhibits the ability to transform gender, becoming a  rival for Fred instead of a mate and resulting in a fight to the death.  the scientists’ (and the audience’s) notion of applying anthropomorphic  or anthropocentric categories, such as the male/female dichotomy,  is revealed to be purely culturally constructed and irrelevant when  confronted with the ‘chaosmic’ force of zoe (Braidotti 86). Dren similarly exhibits features that Clive and Elsa have not intended  to be ‘in the mix’ and cannot explain. When examining the splice for  the first time and putting it in the MRi, Clive realizes, ‘i don’t even  know what half of this is.’ Elsa explains the unidentifiable physical  features as expressions of ‘rogue elements. Junk genes pushing through’  and then examines the hybrid’s tail: </page> <page sequence="10"> 128 Biopunk Dystopias Elsa presses a gloved-thumb beneath its tip and a sHaRp spikE  protrudes from a hood of skin. it drips with a sticky goo that Elsa  smears onto a slide.       ELsa (Cont’D)   some kind of self-defense mechanism.       CLiVE   or attack venom.       ELsa   none of her animal components have predatory characteristics.       CLiVE   Well... there’s the human element. Elsa gives him a wry smirk. (natali, terry, and taylor 34) Dren’s physicality is mysterious and thus monstrous, as Jeffrey Weinstock  argues about the monster’s appearance: ‘it may reveal [...] the absence  of a divine plan governing creation, as well as the limitations of human  knowledge’ (1). none of the original donor species in Dren’s genome  exhibits a poisonous stinger, defensive or predatory, and Clive’s comment  about the ‘human element’ only underscores the scientists’ insecurity  in explaining the ‘epistemological threat of confronting that which  should not be’ (Weinstock 2). not even human nature has been fully  laid bare and scientifically explained, so Dren’s features feel especially  monstrous in their non-human excess. the film enacts this as an  escalation of threatening transgressions of the natural order: first the  inexplicable stinger, then the co-existence of lungs and gills (not existent  in Dren’s mammal, bird, or fish donors but only in amphibians), later  the retractable wings made of webbing and not feathers, and finally  the regenerative ability to regrow cut-off body parts and phenotypically  express different genders. But the film does not stop on the somatic level when presenting  non-human animal features in Dren. Her behavioral patterns are  similarly monstrous and it becomes clear throughout the film that Dren  possesses uncanny cognitive abilities far beyond the human potential.  Her non-human behavior is first presented within the confines of  different animal behaviors. For example, she attacks Clive’s brother when  he sneaks into the storage room that Dren claims as her habitat, thus  forcing her to exhibit strong territorial instincts. again, the film does  </page> <page sequence="11"> sCiEnCE, FaMiLy, anD tHE MonstRous pRoGEny 129 not explain these as hereditary from any specific donor species, but none  of the non-human animals exhibit this kind of behavior. the situation  is diffused by Elsa ordering Dren harshly to her place and proving an  animal hierarchy of alpha domination, which is just as non-existent in  the original species. a similar scene in which the film enacts Dren’s monstrous behavior  occurs when Clive and Elsa take Dren to her new home, the abandoned  farm of Elsa’s youth, and Dren escapes their custody, overwhelmed by  her curiosity for the new environment. When the scientists finally find  her, Dren has hunted a rabbit and eats it raw – looking up at them with  blood covering her face and her hands full of entrails. Dren’s inexplicable  predatory side is unacceptable for Elsa, who resorts to imposing her  own (human) values and norms on Dren for hunting the rabbit: ‘that  was bad. Bad Dren!’ the human and the non-human clash and thus  expose the genetically created posthuman as monstrous. natural order  has been severely disturbed and the result is frightening. What remains  unexplained throughout the film is the origin of the monster and thus  the origin of our fear and repulsion. in terms of cinematography, the film seems to undercut the superim- position of humanist subjectivity on Dren, though: after the bunny  incident, Dren stands in the hayloft, elevated by at least 12 feet, back  turned to Elsa, who needs to crane her neck and keep a distance from  Dren. the camera keeps the focus on Dren, shown in close-up, her  facial features seeming to suggest she is pondering the verbal scolding  with just as much curiosity as remorse (and this, of course, is a strongly  ‘humanized’ interpretation). the light is also solely on Dren; Elsa’s  position in the frame is diminished by either the long focus or the  darkness she stands in. adding irony to the scene is Elsa’s jacket, which displays a white  bunny on its lapel, right above her heart – involuntarily marking Elsa  just as much as prey, foreshadowing that the power dynamics will  radically turn. this is even more emphasized when Dren does not accept  the human gesture of care, an offered blanket, but in an aggressive and  sudden move jumps from the hayloft to a large tank of water, where  she can stay thanks to her amphibious nature. the visual presentation  of this scene here turns the linguistic assertion of human superiority  (‘Bad Dren!’) around and establishes the post human as becoming-animal  with a power to respond – this power for Derrida being at the crux of  the central wrong of a humanist argumentation for a subjectivity, that  ‘the animal is without language. or more precisely unable to respond,  to respond with a response that could be precisely and rigorously distin- guished from a reaction, the animal is without the right and power  </page> <page sequence="12"> 130 Biopunk Dystopias to “respond” and hence without many other things that would be the  property of man’ (400). Splice positions Dren as a prime example of the complication of  categories that the ‘subjection to and constitution in the materiality and  technicity of a language that is always on the scene before we are, as  a radically ahuman precondition for our subjectivity’ (Wolfe, ‘all too  Human’ 571), brings to the fore. if language – the semiotic system of  response to other creatures – is supposed to draw boundaries of human  and non-human, then Dren is the transgression of this boundary, a  redefinition of the meaning of language, as Derrida describes it: ‘if one  reinscribes language in a net work of possibilities that do not merely  encom pass it but mark it irreducibly from the inside, everything  changes. i am thinking in particular of the mark in general, of the  trace, of iterability, of différance’ (cited in Wolfe, ‘all too Human’ 571).  the human/animal distinction is negated by Dren’s cognitive skills of  response – her ability to express herself by using scrabble tiles is not  simply her human side affirming itself but a subversion of human  linguistic superiority. When Elsa tests the hybrid’s cognition, she wants  to assess not only iconic association (using an image of a teddy bear to  associate with the real teddy bear) but also symbolic association using  scrabble tiles. she spells out her own name ‘E-L-s-a’ and taps her chest:  ‘that’s me. Elsa. show me Elsa!’ What she does not realize is that she  gestures towards her t-shirt, imprinted with the company name ‘nerd.’  When asked to show ‘Elsa,’ Dren responds with iconic association:  after a short hesitation that possibly signifies the thought process in  realizing the task, she swipes the superfluous letters aside and picks out  the correct letters to spell out ‘n-E-R-D’, identifying the word on the  t-shirt and thus undermining Elsa’s speech act, which superimposed on  the already existing iconic semiotic sequence a symbolic one. Human  language is revealed to be one of several possible systems of semiotic  meaning production – and not the most logical at that. over the duration of the film, Dren’s cognitive abilities become more  and more human-like and the film complicates the issue of a human/ non-human distinction. she wears clothing, learns language skills (she  spells ‘tedious’ to express her boredom), and is shown to mimic human  behavior (expressing frustration by pounding on the table with her fists).  she closely observes Clive and Elsa’s behavior, but whenever the film  reveals her desires to be accepted and loved by the two parental figures,  it also provides a complicating motion in the scene. in one scene, for  example, she discovers a box of Elsa’s childhood things and the film  humanizes her reaction as she realizes her separation from her ‘parent.’  Splice enacts physiological difference as a marker of exclusion: in Dren’s  </page> <page sequence="13"> sCiEnCE, FaMiLy, anD tHE MonstRous pRoGEny 131 case, Elsa’s long blonde hair is singled out as a feature that connects  her to other humans and a cultural tradition. Dren is excluded from  that tradition and by extension also from any human lineage. in the  scene, she finds a tiara and places it on her hairless head, and confirms  its look in the mirror – observed with human expression as reference,  Dren seems confused at the purpose of the tiara. then she discovers  the photograph of Elsa as a child, with her mother holding her. the  strong family connection is enhanced by their embrace and their long,  blonde hair, which seems to flow from mother to daughter in a straight  line where their heads are touching. Lastly, Dren discovers a Barbie doll  with long blonde hair, touches it, and then holds the doll to her face,  stroking the blonde hair against her cheek. Her look projects a certain longing, and the framing of the shot  underscores this as Dren is staged in mirror images, reflections of her  self through human self-obsessive cultural artifacts. Dren – the scene  seems to promote this reading – realizes her exclusion from humanity  because of her physiology. But the scene does not end here: Dren hears  a cat and in a flash motion turns around, her interest completely taken  over by the new discovery. she grabs the cat, swiftly runs with it into  her hideout, and holds the cat up, staring right into its face. she studies  the cat, looking similarly confused as before. she then cuddles with the  cat, once more displaying a longing look. taken together, the two parts  of the scene reveal Dren’s liminality and monstrosity. she does not fit  the category of human, nor that of animal (as broad and inclusive as  that may be otherwise presented in the film) – the scene thus does  not humanize her longing for companionship but rather enacts and  emphasizes her monstrousness, as Weiss argues: ‘the logic of monsters  is one of particulars, not essences. Each monster exists in a class by  itself’ (124). Dren’s behavior is thus deliberately left indistinguishably  human/non-human for most of the film. But the film goes further in blurring the boundaries, even  transgressing into uncanny realms of post- or superhuman ability. in  a scene late in the movie, Clive is watching Dren through surveillance  cameras. When he finds her, switching through different cameras,  Dren is swimming in the tank and suddenly begins to perform a slow,  sensual dance underwater, intently looking at the camera, showing off  her body. Clive reacts with desire, intensifying his gaze, and reaching  out with his hand towards the monitor. as his hand moves forward,  Dren reaches out towards the camera, mirroring Clive’s movement.  the two hands seem to touch, a connection through the mediated  image. Clive realizes the impossibility of the situation and jerks back  his hand, slamming down the top of his laptop to rid himself of the  </page> <page sequence="14"> 132 Biopunk Dystopias inexplicable image. the film here hints at the possibility that Dren  might evolve beyond the capacity of natural human cognition without  actually confirming or denying Clive’s experience. as i have shown, Splice deliberately presents the posthuman as  monstrous in that it revels in the transgressive potential of a posthuman  becoming-animal. Dren is a categorial hybrid and the metaphorical  representation of zoe, of chaotic, forceful, and ever-adaptive life: protean,  self-organizing, and adapting to its environment. she is evolving and  changing, not just physically but cognitively. she is transgressive and  post-anthropocentric in that she completely surpasses any categori- zation into human/animal, amphibian/avian/mammalian, male/female,  natural/artificial. in Dren’s monstrosity the film enacts twenty-first- century anxieties, fears, and insecurities, and as Levina and Bui argue,  monstrosity becomes a ‘[process] of identification [for the viewer] [...] a  fluid category concerned with representation and ambiguity of change’  (5). the posthuman subjectivity is presented to the audience as an  alternative; Dren’s adaptability and instability regarding categories – as  unnerving as it is – imagines ‘change as a primary ontology of the  twenty-first century’ (Levina and Bui 7). Splice thus radically enacts a  posthuman subjectivity ‘of multiple belongings, as a relational subject  constituted in and by multiplicity, that is to say a subject that works  across differences and is also internally differentiated, but still grounded  and accountable’ (Braidotti 49). 4.2 Motherhood, Commitment, and Liquidity the monster as embodiment of ambiguity, change, metamorphosis,  mutation, and the fluidity of categories is thus an ideal representation  of liquid modernity and its social anxieties of insecurity and unsafety,  as imagined by Bauman. and as Jeffrey Cohen argues, monsters are  specifically born ‘as an embodiment of a certain cultural moment – of  a time, a feeling, and a place’; their bodies are literal manifestations of  the zeitgeist: ‘the monstrous body is pure culture’ (4). thus, as natali has stated (see Captain) and as i have argued  elsewhere (schmeink, ‘Frankenstein’s offspring’), Splice is a mythopoeic  re-appropriation of the Frankenstein myth that is deeply connected to the  zeitgeist of the twenty-first century. What is interesting about it, though,  is that it emphasizes the familial bond at the heart of the original story  and transports it into liquid modern society. instead of Frankenstein’s  father/son relation, which most readers understand as a ‘“perverse;”  “abnormal;” inverted, “debased;” against nature, “narcissistic” breach of  </page> <page sequence="15"> sCiEnCE, FaMiLy, anD tHE MonstRous pRoGEny 133 “the boundaries of the benevolent family”’ (Hirsch 125), the film explores  a mother/daughter relation from a different outlook – that of the origin  of the monstrous inherent in parent–child relations. in terms of its science-fictional dimension of consequence, Frankenstein  has, on the one hand, often been read as depicting an abnormal  monstrous creation, which is a symptom of Victor’s gynophobia. on  the other hand, the novel can be understood to emphasize ‘a failure  of postpartum bonding’ (Hirsch 124), in that Victor does not provide  ‘sustained guidance, influence, pity and support’ (Hustis 845; see  schmeink, ‘Mythos’ 235) for his infant-like creation and thus fails as a  parent. Splice inserts itself into both arguments but adapts the discussion  of family, procreation, and responsibility to liquid modern realities in  consumer society. the first aspect of the thematic complex that natali  adapts to liquid modern reality is the idea that human procreation has  become a specific market within consumer society and that human life  itself is a commodity to be traded. Bauman argues that consumers will be  able to change themselves and their offspring as they see fit: ‘Genomics  and genetic engineering may be viewed as the ultimate dream of homo  consumens, as breaking the last border in the modern consumer’s career,  as the last, crowning stage in a long, tortuous yet in the end victorious  struggle to expand consumer freedom’ (Living 143). in the film, this is expressed broadly in Clive and Elsa’s motivation  for creating Dren, driven by their desire to test their own limits, to  create something new and unique – an individual and temporary life  choice: When pitching their proposal for splicing human Dna into a new  hybrid creature, Elsa argues that they are practically gift-wrapping ‘the  medical breakthrough of the century’ for their employer, that they will  be able to cure an array of severe illnesses such as parkinson’s, diabetes,  and even cancer. Confronted with the objection that policy and public  opinion would not allow such research, and that moral outrage would  immediately stop any work undertaken, Elsa coolly replies: ‘if we don’t  use human Dna now, someone else will.’ When the CEo refuses the  offer, Elsa and Clive decide they don’t want to work as practical engineers  (i.e. finding applications for their research), mainly because that work  would be tedious and do very little in terms of their reputation. they  are more interested to follow the ideals of Bauman’s hunting utopia, in  a constant search for new opportunities, new challenges, new options  for their own life choices. Wanting to reap the glory of their work, they  are now no longer interested in the practical consequences, but rather  seek new ways to remain on top. Doing scientific grunt work for several  years seems to neglect all of the thrilling new choices that developing  the hybrid offers. </page> <page sequence="16"> 134 Biopunk Dystopias that the ethically more than dubious experiment with Dren has  changed very little in terms of this drive towards new challenges, towards  making more and more aspects of life part of consumption, is obvious  at the end of the film, when the artificial birth and life cycle of Dren  is evaluated in terms of economics and then replaced with the natural  birth of a human–posthuman hybrid for the next round of commodifi- cation. as Braidotti argues, ‘advanced capitalism both invests and profits  from the scientific and economic control and the commodification of all  that lives’ (59). First, the company CEo explains that Dren has turned  out ‘to be a cauldron of unimaginable chemical mysteries,’ which will  have the company ‘filing patents for years.’ the death of the posthuman  thus becomes economic opportunity for its owners – the multinational  pharmaceutical company. in this, the treatment of human and posthuman  bodies echoes the commodification of zoe in both atwood’s Maddaddam  trilogy and Bacigalupi’s Windup stories, as discussed in the last chapter.  second, Elsa’s pregnancy, which she signs away to the company’s research  machinery, is then ‘the next stage’ in this ultimate commodification of  Life. Elsa’s words ‘What’s the worst that could happen?’ have repeatedly  framed the experiences of the film and are here ironic commentary about  the continuation of the consumption process. in the script, different  words downplay Elsa’s resignation and rather emphasize her conviction:  ‘this is what i want,’ she says, before giving in to the company’s (in the  form of its CEo’s) ‘motherly embrace’ (natali, terry, and taylor 113). Wanting a child and taking responsibility for it as a life-long  commitment is then the second aspect of this thematic complex  challenged by the film. in liquid modern times and consumer society,  as Bauman argues, children are just as much objects of consumption,  in this case of an emotional nature: objects of consumption serve the needs, desires or wishes of the  consumer; so do children. Children are wanted for the joys of the  parental pleasures it is hoped they will bring – the kinds of joys  no other object of consumption, however ingenious and sophis- ticated, can offer. to the sadness of the practitioners of commerce,  the commodity market cannot supply worthy substitutes, though  the sorrow finds some compensation in the ever-expanding place  the world of commerce gains in the production and maintenance  of the real thing. (Liquid Love 42) But Bauman’s argument goes further, for the emotional consumption  of children is problematic for a society that cherishes freedom of choice  and flexibility of movement and keeps constantly changing, sampling  </page> <page sequence="17"> sCiEnCE, FaMiLy, anD tHE MonstRous pRoGEny 135 life choices instead of fully committing to one. Consumers might not  like the ‘strings-attached’ aspect of parenthood: ‘Creating a family’ is like jumping headlong into uncharted waters  of unfathomed depth. Forfeiting or postponing other seductive  consumer joys of an attraction as yet untried, unknown and  impossible to predict, itself an awesome sacrifice stridently jarring  with the habits of a prudent consumer, is not its only likely  consequence [...] one may become, horror of horrors, ‘dependent’.  Having children may mean the need to lower one’s professional  ambitions, to ‘sacrifice a career’ [...] Most painfully, having children  means accepting such loyalty-dividing dependence for an indefinite  time, entering an open-ended and irrevocable commitment with  no ‘until further notice’ clause attached; the kind of obligation that  goes against the grain of liquid modern life politics and which most  people at most times zealously avoid in the other manifestations of  their lives. (Liquid Love 43) Splice then interjects at exactly this point of discussion in exemplifying  an alternative to natural/traditional parenthood: posthuman genetic  creation. in terms of natural procreation, Elsa makes it very clear that  she is not ready to have a child and accept the responsibility that goes  with it: ‘i don’t want to bend my life to some third party that does not  even exist yet.’ ‘What’s the worst that could happen?’ Clive asks and  Elsa deflects the question, which reemerges in the film several times,  a running gag until its final utterance in the CEo’s office on both  parenting and the scientific endeavors undertaken. the liquid modern  horror of continuous commitment looms large in this discussion – and  in the film – as Jonathan Romney points out in his review: the film is very funny in its dark jokes about parenthood and the  horrible dawning realisations that come with the job: that babies  are very noisy, demand endless attention and totally mess up your  work habits. the funniest line – ‘We’re bio chemists, we can handle  this’ – could speak for the delusion of all new parents that no small,  helpless creature could possibly be that hard to manage. Elsa’s rejection of natural parenthood is based in her suffering massive  abuse as a child at the hands of an overly controlling and yet powerless  parent. she strongly resents the power relations of the parent–child  dynamic as well as the underlying issue of the controllability of the child.  the only natural parental relation the film describes is thus abusive,  </page> <page sequence="18"> 136 Biopunk Dystopias transgressive, even monstrous in its own right, leaving Elsa terrified  about any such commitment of her own. as an alternative, she prefers the rigorously regimented scientific  experiment, which she has power over and which does not come  ‘in a package deal with the sorrows of self-sacrifice and the fears of  unexplored dangers’ (Bauman, Liquid Love 44) – or so she believes.  and in a sense, this is true for the beginning of the film, which shows  Clive and Elsa as ‘parents’ of Fred and Ginger. the birth of Fred opens  the film and already sets up the dichotomies of experiment/child, of  scientific research/parent hood. We are introduced to Clive and Elsa  via a subjective camera emerging from darkness to extreme light, then  shifting to a fish-eye view of the creature. During the first minutes,  the creature painfully struggles to life, the camerawork and editing of  the scene deliberately staying close to the infants’ experiences. For a  few moments survival is uncertain. the scene ends with Clive and Elsa  placing the creature in an incubator, removing their masks and smiling  down on their ‘child.’ the attitude of both parents then markedly  announces a gender role inversion: Elsa coldly and scientifically states,  ‘no physical discrepancies,’ allowing herself only a faint smile. Clive,  on the other hand, bears a wide grin and emotionally proclaims, ‘it’s  perfect!’ the scene establishes the central conceit of the film: in techno- scientific culture, genetic splicing may replace pregnancy and childbirth,  the scientists thus become ‘parents,’ and the ethics of scientific conduct  problematically merge with the ethics of childrearing. and whereas Clive expressed interest in having children with Elsa,  during the artificial procreative process, it is his voice in the early stages  that counsels against carrying out the experiment. after having created  a successful splice, Elsa overrides Clive’s objections (‘We will go to jail  for this!’) and prepares the injection, arguing that they both need to  know if they are scientifically able to create hybrid life: ‘We won’t take  it to term. We just need to find out if we can generate a sustainable  embryo. then we destroy it. nobody will ever know.’ When Clive wants  to abort the experiment later on, showing empathy for the creature (‘Do  you think it is in pain? [...] it’s not formed right’), Elsa again argues in  scientific terms that they can learn more, get data on the ‘sustainability’  of genetically engineered life. this emotional struggle repeats, but Elsa becomes more and more  confused between science and parenthood. For example, after Elsa  ignores safety protocols and makes contact with the splice, Clive gets  her out of the room, before a fight erupts about the hybrid’s fate. Clive  wants to terminate the experiment and kill it, but Elsa has already  become more emotionally attached than she would like to admit to  </page> <page sequence="19"> sCiEnCE, FaMiLy, anD tHE MonstRous pRoGEny 137 herself: ‘We can’t do that! Look at it!’ she exclaims and sedates it  instead, once more hiding behind scientific curiosity as a motivation to  keep the experiment running. the scene ends with a cross-cut between  the splice’s slow struggle against the gas, its helpless bouncing around  the room, falling to the floor and labored breathing, and an extreme  close-up on Elsa’s emotional reaction, shot from behind, angled so as to  only reveal her in partial profile on the right edge of the screen before  a black background, glancing coldly but intensely at the splice and at  last swallowing down hard her own discomfort with the situation. Both  editing and composition here suggest Elsa’s attempt to detach herself  from the emotional responsibility for the life in front of her – which  is later in the film revealed to be her own biological offspring. sarah  polley’s acting in this scene is minimalistic, showing strong emotional  restraint and thus revealing Elsa’s failed attempt at distancing. already at  this stage, Elsa’s scientific distance and neutrality have been supplanted  by feelings of motherhood and emotional attachment – all notions of  control, objectivity, and liquid modern fluidity have fallen away. as Dren grows, she more and more becomes Elsa’s surrogate child.  at this point, Elsa’s acceptance of Dren’s human subjectivity is still  contrasted with Clive’s continuous attempts at distancing, but the  ethical argumentation has switched and he now tries to uphold scientific  neutrality, scolding Elsa for letting Dren out of the lab: ‘specimens  need to be contained,’ he argues. Elsa is horrified and exclaims: ‘Don’t  call her that! [...] Her name is Dren.’ Elsa, blinded by motherly love,  cannot see Dren as an experiment any longer and completely falls for  the emotional commodity of having a child. When Dren starts exhibiting rapidly growing needs in regard to  movement, interaction, and emotional relations, the parental bonds  start to shift. as Bauman argues, in liquid modern consumer society,  commodities only have a certain lifespan before they are discarded and  replaced: ‘the usability of the goods as a rule outlives their usefulness to  the consumer. But if used repeatedly, the purchased commodity thwarts  the search for variety, and with each successive use the veneer of novelty  rubs away and wipes off’ (Liquid Love 50). With Dren becoming more  and more independent, starting to exhibit more complex human traits,  the mother/daughter relationship loses its emotional appeal for Elsa and  she is growingly frustrated with her ‘purchased good.’ Whereas Elsa had strong motherly feelings as long as Dren was small,  she now feels like she is losing control of Dren. after Dren throws a  fit, demanding freedom, Elsa becomes overbearing, aggressively pushing  and hitting Dren into the role of the inferior. ‘she is getting so hard  to control,’ Elsa realizes. From here on out, Elsa’s ‘parenting’ becomes  </page> <page sequence="20"> 138 Biopunk Dystopias more and more erratic, with Elsa sometimes trying to bond (by teaching  Dren about make-up), and in the next moment exerting fierce control  (taking away Dren’s pet). it is Clive, who rejected the ‘experiment’  and did not bond with the small child, who now takes on the role of  caring parent and tells the insecure, emotionally unstable Dren what  she needs to hear: ‘Dren, we need you. ... Dren, we love you!’ the situation escalates completely when Elsa tries to make a last  attempt at consoling the angered and frustrated Dren by confirming  the biological connection to her and bringing a gift. Elsa and Dren  face each other in the barn, and Elsa soothingly says: ‘you’re a part of  me. and i’m a part of you ... l’m inside you,’ thus admitting to Dren  her human heritage and the parental relation, which Elsa through her  violent outburst had just proven broken. Bauman argues that in liquid  modernity, when human bonds become frail and easily untied, when  stability and security might be negated by the person you love, then  life becomes a ‘daily rehearsal of death and of “life after death”’ (Liquid  Fear 44) as the loss of human bonds becomes the daily experienced  simulacrum of the final loss of life. Elsa’s words are thus doubly hurtful,  confirming Elsa’s genetic dominance (through parental lineage) and  betrayal (in the easily cast aside human bond) at the same time. in a gesture that feels like appeasement of parental guilt, Elsa then  presents Dren with the cat that she (Elsa) had taken away during their  altercation earlier. While handing the cat to Dren, Elsa says: ‘you can  keep her. Why not? it’s nice to have a pet.’ Her words clearly reveal her  feelings of human superiority, reminding the audience (and Dren) of  the hierarchy embedded in human–animal discourse and the human- related function that animals fulfill. it is also a doubling of Clive’s words  of warning, when he finds her too closely bonding with Dren: ‘you’re  talking like ... you’re treating her like she’s a ... a pet.’ Elsa’s words thus  reveal the categorial problem at the heart of her relationship to Dren:  scientist and experiment, owner and pet, or mother and daughter? Dren  reveals her understanding of the situation by looking Elsa in the eyes  and then killing the cat violently with her poisonous stinger. she then  attacks Elsa, proving her posthuman physical superiority and asserting  her right to freedom by taking the key to the barn. the film conveys  the shifting power relation here by providing an intimate close-up of the  overwhelmed Elsa on the ground, Dren leaning over her and threatening  her with the stinger. the scene flaunts the irony of the mother–daughter  intimacy that Elsa wanted to evoke and through the prominence and  threat of the stinger turns it into outright rebellion. in the end, Elsa  has to once more resort to violence, this time in extreme measure, to  capture Dren. </page> <page sequence="21"> sCiEnCE, FaMiLy, anD tHE MonstRous pRoGEny 139 Dren literally has the upper hand against Elsa   (screenshot: Splice, © universum, 2010). Realizing her new emotional ‘dependence’ (and inferiority), Elsa  rejects her role as parent completely and reverts to a purely scientific  position, reclaiming control over her experiment with full force. Just like  Victor Frankenstein when he wants to destroy the monster, Elsa exercises  her ‘right’ to curtail the experiment – literally. she determines that Dren  is exhibiting ‘erratic behavior’ due to a ‘disproportionate species identi- fication’ and that Dren needs to be dehumanized. Elsa restrains Dren  on the examination table, psychologically humiliates her (by forcefully  removing her clothing), and in the end even physically maims her by  cutting off her stinger – all in the name of science and a desperate need  for control. During the whole scene, the script describes Elsa as ‘utterly  devoid of emotion,’ ‘detached, clinical,’ and having a ‘frigid disregard’  (natali, terry, and taylor 91–92) for Dren’s feelings of terror. But Elsa’s drastic act of parental transgression is not the only one.  When Dren starts to show strong sexual desire for Clive, he cannot resist  and gives in (more on this below). the scene is extremely disturbing in  its implications as we read a complex brew of ethical transgressions in  Clive’s behavior. Elsa, who discovers them, and Clive later realize that  their violations of Dren have been too numerous, that they have failed  on many levels. Both realize that as parents their relationship with  Dren is broken – they have abused her, maimed her, transgressed any  parent/child boundary – but that as a scientific experiment there is a  solution to the situation and to their responsibility: ‘the experiment is  over, responsibilities end.’ in using the biopunk metaphor of the posthuman genetic creation, the  film intelligently conflates scientific experimentation with parenthood  </page> <page sequence="22"> 140 Biopunk Dystopias and reveals liquid modern anxieties about the monstrousness of  becoming a parent: Children are incomplete, are ambiguous in their  potential to find subjectivity, continuously change and adapt; they  are the ‘abjected fragment that enables the formation of all kinds of  identities – personal, national, cultural, economic, sexual, psychological,  universal, particular’ (J. Cohen 19). on the other hand, children are  monstrous in that they are reminders of what is prohibited in liquid  modernity, ‘polic[ing] the borders of the possible, interdicting through  [their] grotesque bod[ies] some behaviors and actions, envaluing others’  (J. Cohen 6). in liquid modernity, the concept of parenthood becomes  representative of inconvenience, inertia, rigidity, and the loss of choice.  in a world that shuns any form of dependence, Bauman says, motherhood, conception, birth, and all that follows them (such as,  for instance, an indefinite marital/parental commitment, a prospect  of children being loved and cared for ad infinitum at a price and  self-sacrifice impossible to calculate in advance), are not just a  narrow fissure in the cocoon that was promised and craved, but a  wide hole, impossible to stop up; a hole through which contingency,  accident and fate, so deeply resented, might flow into the interior  of the fortress that had been laboriously built and lavishly armed  in order to keep them outside its walls. (Living 122) the film presents this self-sacrifice by using the posthuman splice as a  surrogate child. the compressed nature of Dren’s life cycle allows the  film the unique opportunity to heighten the emotions of parenthood,  the dependencies and, of course, the accidents and contingencies. the  selfish-individualistic lives of Elsa and Clive are completely shattered;  their liquid modern ‘fortress’ of convenience evaporates. and just as  Frankenstein had to pay the price for his hubris and neglect, so do Elsa  and Clive. after having decided to end the experiment, they return to  the farm, only to find Dren dying. they bury her, not realizing that  the next mutational cycle in her evolution begins with her death (as  some others before had done too). Dren emerges radically changed from  this process, having switched genotypic expressions of biological sex,  becoming what the audience (from a binary view) perceives to be male  and growing much more aggressive, territorial, and predatory in the  process. the new Dren then goes on to eliminate all perceived threats,  that is, killing anyone that might challenge his dominance over the  territory. this includes, in the final battle between Dren and the scientist  couple, impaling Clive with a final blow from the stinger, before being  killed himself by Elsa in a desperate struggle to survive. </page> <page sequence="23"> sCiEnCE, FaMiLy, anD tHE MonstRous pRoGEny 141 4.3 Monstrous Sexuality and Perversion the splice is not only a cultural metaphor for childrearing turned  monstrous; also and even more chillingly it comments on another  aspect of human bonding that has shifted in meaning with the advent  of biotechnology and genetic engineering. as Bauman states, in liquid  modernity ‘medicine competes with sex [...] for the charge over  “reproduction”’ (Liquid Love 40) – and clearly medicine has partnered  up with techno science to win the competition. in effect, in the biopunk  depiction of the film, Bauman’s vision for a near future has fully come  true, with all its consequences: genetic engineering makes possible a  complete and utter ‘emancipation of procreation from sex’ (Living 123). in Elsa and Clive’s relationship this separation has become a dominant  factor, as their procreation becomes technologically enhanced and  fully automated through genetic engineering. on the other side of  this demarcation line, their sex life has become a mere commodity  that they forget about, getting lost in their many other life choices. as  Volkmar sigusch announces, ars erotica is not an achievement of liquid  modernity: ‘today, sexuality no longer epitomizes the potential for  pleasure and happiness. it is no longer mystified, positively, as ecstasy  and transgression, but negatively instead, as the source of oppression,  inequality, violence, abuse, and deadly infection’ (cited in Bauman, Liquid  Love 39). in Clive and Elsa’s life, sex has been completely de-coupled  from reproduction and lost its central appeal. the only scene in the  film that depicts the couple having sex with each other emphasizes this  de-coupling, first by their own realization that sexual attraction has not  existed between them for a while (‘it’s been a long time,’ Clive says. ‘oh  God. i didn’t even notice,’ is Elsa’s reply) and then by Elsa’s joking (but  ironically fitting) explanation that this is what happens when couples  ‘work too hard.’ it is also fitting, then, that their intercourse in this  scene is marked as a resurgence of old cultural associations with sex  (reproduction, long-term commitment), because it temporarily restores  the capacity to produce offspring: ‘i don’t have any ...’ Clive admits  (meaning condoms), and Elsa answers jokingly: ‘What’s the worst that  could happen?’ Clive turns away, frowning upon the answer, but still  accepts the seductive act. But their sexuality becomes transgressive as  Clive realizes that Dren is watching them. Before he can react, he and  Elsa climax, and he cannot see Dren anymore – for a moment a doubt  lingers whether Dren was there or not. in the script, the scene is more  explicit in its sexually deviant feelings, at which the movie only hints:  ‘Clive is about to put a stop to their passion when something catches  his eye [...] He sees her. Dren. peering through the curtains. [...] the  </page> <page sequence="24"> 142 Biopunk Dystopias moment is surreal. Clive continues to watch Dren watching. He says  nothing. sexual momentum builds. strangeness’ (natali, terry, and  taylor 62). after Elsa tells him that she is willing to risk pregnancy, the  script suggests, Clive is unwilling to go on having sex, but seeing Dren  arouses him. the sexual momentum is based on a potential transgression,  on the promise of an act that is intensely complex, shaded with infidelity,  incest, pedophilia, and bestiality. in this, the film emphasizes Dren as transgressive, posthuman,  and ‘chaosmic’ and once more as monstrous, embodying ‘those sexual  practices that must not be committed, or that may be committed only  through the body of the monster’ (J. Cohen 14). the film presents this  monstrous sexuality in a drastic doubling, enacting the monster both as  ‘too sexual, perversely erotic, a lawbreaker [...] [that] must be exiled or  destroyed’ and as desirable ‘fantasy’ through which transgressions ‘are  allowed safe expression’ (J. Cohen 16–17). in her article on ‘transgressive sexuality,’ patricia MacCormack argues  that perversion is a transformative tactic of becoming, a potential to  subvert ‘presumptions of subjects conforming to established subject  positions, genders and sexualities rather than simply a deviation from  heterosexual intercourse.’ perversion is a destabilizing tactic similar to  posthumanism and monstrosity, embracing a hybridized and flexible  ‘becoming’ of the body, represented in sexual desire: ‘theorising the  body as existing not purely as a spatial subject, but in time as a series  of open reconfigurations and constant change suggests other ways of  understanding the self and the subject as being in permanent flux’  (MacCormack). Dren’s sexuality is perverse in MacCormack’s sense: it is a monstrous  sexuality that enables the film to destabilize normative subjectivity.  key to this monstrosity is that Dren’s biology, reminiscent of Braidotti’s  definition of the monstrous, is ‘in between, the mixed, the ambivalent,’  making Dren ‘both horrible and wonderful, object of aberration and  adoration’ (Braidotti cited in MacCormack). as discussed above, Dren  is categorically instable in terms of her species, incorporating parts of  non-human animals. When Clive gives in to his desires and has sex with Dren, the film  highlights her non-human biology. she appears behind Clive, with  wings extended, and embraces him. then she pushes him against the  water tank, with her kangaroo-like hind legs pinning him in and her  tail balancing out her body. Clive looks at the odd angle of the leg  with fascination, then struggles out of his clothes, helped along by  Dren with her feet while he mounts her. When Dren sits on top of  him, she stretches out her arms and her webbed wings extend to full  </page> <page sequence="25"> sCiEnCE, FaMiLy, anD tHE MonstRous pRoGEny 143 Dren’s non-human animal nature takes over during the sexual act  with Clive (screenshot: Splice, © universum, 2010). spread. Clive is enthralled and unbelieving. He rolls her over, pushing  into her. the camera focuses on Clive from below, with Dren’s tail seen  behind and above him, emphasizing the regeneration of her stinger,  which hovers threateningly above Clive while he climaxes. Horror and  fascination are closely linked in this scene, enacted in the non-human  biology of Dren. in addition to the non-human sexuality enacted here, the film also  hints at the transgression and monstrosity within the complex triad of  infidelity (Clive is cheating on Elsa with Dren), pedophilia (technically  speaking Dren is a child, only a few weeks old – even though her  physiological development is that of a teenage girl), and incest (at least  culturally, Dren is Clive’s daughter). in drawing upon the work of Claude Lévi-strauss, Bauman remarks  that ‘the birth of culture’ is strongly tied up with ‘the prohibition of  incest,’ and that the ban on having sex within a biological family was  an attempt to ‘impose on nature a distinction which nature itself had  failed to make and would not acknowledge’ (Living 122) – a cultural  demarcation that was supposed to facilitate order and control. When  Clive realizes Dren’s genetic make-up includes Elsa’s Dna, the cultural  boundaries seem to evaporate. seeing aspects of the woman he fell in  love with in Dren confuses him. Culturally, he has been acting as a father  surrogate to Dren, which would morally foreclose any sexual desire. But  biologically he is not related to Dren, and her genetic resemblance to Elsa  further enhances his desire – for him, thus, sex has become re-infused  </page> <page sequence="26"> 144 Biopunk Dystopias with ‘emotion, ecstasy and meta physics from which the seductive power  of sex used to flow’ (Bauman, Liquid Love 47). as the avatar for metamorphosis, the monster literally becomes  the secondary body through which to safely express transgression, a  body offering ‘an alluring projection of (an other) self’ (J. Cohen 17)  for Clive and for the audience. incest here is revealed as a cultural  imposition based in taboos and mandates that regulate, structure,  and limit life force. the monstrous acts as a reminder that zoe-centric  subjectivity negates cultural boundaries. Displaying sexual perversion in  this way ‘acknowledges the instability of the integrity of the subject,’  as MacCormack has pointed out: ‘through the destabilising effects of  pleasure and perversion subjectivity shifts away from being defined  through what it is [...] and is more appropriately addressed through  what it does and what is done to it.’ Clive and Dren’s desire for each  other subverts the subjective positions we ascribe to them – they are no  longer limited by their relation as father/daughter, human/non-human,  scientist/experiment. Splice nevertheless does not simply equate the monstrous with a  repressed and transgressive desire, but rather embraces its inherent  protean nature: the monstrous is both vicarious transgressor and  enforcer of boundaries. in its policing function lies its potential for  dystopian warning, as Jeffrey Cohen argues: ‘as a vehicle of prohibition,  the monster most often arises to enforce the laws of exogamy, both the  incest taboo [...] and the decrees against interracial sexual mingling’  (15). the monster as enforcer of boundaries functions as warning  against the dystopian consequences that a science-fictional reality of  posthuman genetic engineering will bring. its origin story is a reminder  that scientific hubris brings forth horror and destruction. Dren is the  ultimate product of xenogenesis and thus the metaphoric monstrous  transgressor of technoscience. Dren attempts to kill anyone involved  in the process of breaking the taboo, thus direly warning against any  such transgression. But in engaging in one last monstrous act, in once  more breaking the incest taboo, this time from both a biological and a  cultural perspective, by raping Elsa, the genetic parent, Dren also firmly  establishes that monsters always escape and return in the form of new  life. Even though Dren is killed, Elsa is pregnant with Dren’s child and  thus the monstrous lives on.
