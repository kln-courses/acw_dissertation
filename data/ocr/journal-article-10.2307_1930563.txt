<plain_text><page sequence="1">BIRD PSYCHOLOGY 2 As a compendium of the facts of bird display this book represents a distinct contribution to ornithological literature. The labor expended in digesting the contents of the naturalistic and experimental reports which comprise the 30-page bibliography must have been tremendous. The accounts of various aspects of bird display are enriched by frequent reference to similar behavior shown by invertebrates, fishes, reptiles, and mammals. The author is certainly to be commended for his painstaking and exhaustive treatment of the 1 Brown, Clair A., and Donovan S. Correll. 1942. Ferns and fern allies of Louisiana.

Psychology is a recognized field of science the major areas of which are reasonably well defined. It is too complex a subject to be successfully treated by any sort of an oblique approach. An adequate discussion of the psychology of birds would have to include consideration of many well-known facts concerning learning ability, innate behavior patterns in addition to display reactions, sensory and motor equipment, mem- ory, developmental history, etc. Those sections of the book which are primarily psychological deal with the interpretation of behavior; and in these interpretative passages there is much to criticize. Mr. Armstrong presents many excellent de- scriptions of physical structures or behavior patterns and then customarily proceeds to ad- duce their "use" or "purpose." For example, the Australian frogmouth's peculiar method of 503</page><page sequence="2">504 BOOK REVIEWS Ecology, Vol. 24, No. 4 erecting its crown feathers, drooping its wings and opening its beak with the consequent exposure of the mouth markings is categorically inter- preted as an endeavor to frighten intruders. In several instances the function of a behavior pattern is described in terms which defy scientific definition. A bird's "dance" is described as a regulative process by which he controls his vitality and maintains his tension at the requisite pitch." Scorning the "mechanistic" approach to his subject, the author cannot forego the humanizing influence of anthropomorphic interpretation, He suggests, for example, that when birds sing in concert "they derive aesthetic pleasure.as well as psychological stimulation from their united efforts." The rhythmic body movements which both members of the bird pair may display during courtship are said to be caused at least in part by the fact that birds derive pleasure from imi- tating each other. Again, "aerial evolutions, antiphonal singing and the like are indulged in because birds, like ourselves, feel satisfaction in ordered movement and rhythmic sound. Thus are the bonds of biological utilitarianism broken and birds become artists, acting and singing for the joy inherent in doing so." As has been pointed out so often the danger in such descrip- tions of the behavior of lower animals lies in the fact that this type of interpretation is not subject to proof or disproof by any means available to science, and that with such a convenient and purely subjective explanation readily available the search for genuine causal relationships is less likely to be pursued. In Mr. Armstrong's book a great deal of the psychological interpretation of the behavior of birds proceeds from analogies with human re- actions. For example, "The emotional processes of birds (during courtship may be compared with the situation which arises when two people have a heated argument. As passion mounts they 'forget themselves' and eventually come to blows. The words and gestures which constitute the 'display' of the parties to the altercations express their emotions, and each by his display, arouses further increments of emotion in the other, ac- companied by the secretion of adrenalin and other physical changes,3 until the lengthy passion explodes into violent action. A person, picking a quarrel, may 'work up' his own feelings to a certain point, and apparently so can birds." This form of analogy involves the basic assump- tion that the physical changes which are known to occur in humans during emotional arousal have their parallel in the courting bird. Al- though such an assumption is subject to experi- 3 Cannon, W. B. 1929. Bodily Changes in Pain, Hunger, Fear and Rage. 2nd Ed. Ap- pleton &amp; Co., New York. mental test, the evidence at present is wanting. If objective investigation should show that the expected glandular and circulatory activities do not occur during courtship the entire line of reasoning would fall. A second and less war- ranted implication inherent in the type of analogy under consideration is the subtle and highly ques- tionable identification of the mental processes of two species which are as widely separated on the evolutionary scale as are man and bird. Other analogies which are even more objection- able may be typified by the following example. "It is not by accident that there is a resemblance between some of these rites [exchange of incuba- tion responsibility] and the Changing of the Guard. Admittedly there are innumerable dif- ferences of detail between the military ceremonial in Whitehall and the etiquette of the woodcock in the dusky spinney, but both are the mani- festation of the emotion which concentrates itself about what anthropologists call transition rites or rites de passage." This sort of analogy is to be regarded with even more suspicion than the type quoted previously because in the first instance we are at least on solid ground insofar as our understanding of the human behavior is concerned. In the second analogy however, there is not yet available a scientific explanation of either the human or the bird behavior. In fact this constitutes an attempt to explain one unknown in the terms of a second. A third type of comparison which Armstrong employs freely is almost mystical and offers absolutely no aid to our understanding of bird psychology. The following quotation is a good example. "Whatever the type of the dance, long-term or short-term, erotic or bellicose, solo or social, performed by man, ape or bird there is one generalization which we can make. In the dance the individual reaches out beyond his isolation and seeks to realize that harmony be- tween himself and the external world without which neither health nor happiness can be achieved and on which the perpetuation of the race depends." In attempting to devise an explanation of many types of display the author employs vague con- cepts which have little or no basis in scientific fact. Recurrent appeals to psychoanalytical literature do not strengthen his case. In the discussion of disablement reactions and injury feigning he suggests that "the theory which can best explain all these facts is that there exists in birds an undifferentiated store of emotional energy or libido, seeking to express itself, but sometimes unable to do so adequately, and at other times diverted into inappropriate channels." Everyone who has studied the behavior of lower animals has probably at one time or another ob- served reactions which give the impression that Armstrong is attempting to express. Neverthe- less, in the interest of the advancement of scien-</page><page sequence="3">October, 1943 BOOK REVIEWS 505 tific knowledge it is better merely to describe objectively the responses and to eschew prema- ture interpretation. It is especially undesirable to advance purely hypothetical explanations based upon concepts which in themselves are totally unscientific. There is one other general element of weakness in Mr. Armstrong's book. He is particularly interested in the evolution of behavior patterns. The importance and fascination of this aspect of the problem are undeniable, but equally apparent is the danger of imaginative speculation as to the probable course of the evolutionary process. It benefits us little, for example, to surmise that nest building has evolved from a tendency to fidget with grass and twigs under conditions of emotional stress; and it is definitely misleading to suggest that "an elaborate system of ceremonial signaling has been evolved in order that (ital. mine) the rhythms of the male and female might be synchronized and the perpetuation of the race thus assured." The circularity of argument is obvious and the injection of the purposive ele- ment most undesirable. In summary it may be said that ornithologists can benefit from Mr. Armstrong's careful survey of the literature, but that his attempts to employ the material so assiduously collected in the for- mulation of psychological theories are in the main unsuccessful.
