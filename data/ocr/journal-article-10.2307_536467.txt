<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME CONTEMPORARY OBSERVATIONS ON ANCIENT SUPERSTITIONS By MARK GRAUBARD To some of us the word superstition has a simple connotation. It implies a belief which held sway in the dark past, generated by ignorance and fear and still adhered to by those who know no better or happen to be superstitious. Few people concern themselves with the problem beyond this point and superficially at least it would seem as though further concern is unnecessary. Yet, even casual familiarity with the history of science interferes with a complacent acceptance of this statement.' To begin with one is impressed with the fact that many beliefs were maintained in the past on perfectly logical grounds though subsequent events proved that they rested upon fallacious assumptionrs. Ancient astrology argued for example that human fates were determined by the position of constellations and planets at birth. Most of the great scientists who lived before the eighteenth century shared this belief and thought that the evidence against it was weak by comparison with the arguments in its favor. Skeptics raised many questions as far back as four centuries before Ptolemy. Could all the people who met their fate at Thermopylae have been born under the same stars, asked Carneades in the second century B.C.? But Claudius Ptolemy, Tycho Brahe, Kepler2 and many other great scientists of the past thought they knew the answer. Of course not, they said. The stars determine an individual's fate, but calamities are acts of God which cut across the normal course of events. A physician may diagnose correctly the disease of his patient, treat him accordingly and subsequently declare him cured. Yet should that person fall under the wheels of a chariot and be killed, his death could not possibly be attributed to the failure of the science of medicine or its practitioners. Similarly with the influence of the stars. Heavenly bodies determine character, temperament and the course of future events; but sudden and unusual catastrophes are unique and unexpected, hence their characterization as catastrophes. How about individuals who were born at the same moment yet possess different characters and are subject to different fates? That too proved none too difficult to answer. Stars do not work by magic or by mystic powers. They exert a physical influence on the developing embryo just as they do upon the rocks of the earth in which they convert crude lead into the noble metal gold. Not all matter is the same. The nature and character of the individual depend upon the matter of which the egg is composed as well as upon stellar configurations. Today we would say the character of the in- dividual depends as much upon the genes as upon the environment. How about twins that are much alike though born a hour or so apart?

I24</page><page sequence="2">Some Contemporary Observations on Ancient Superstitions answer to this query was that conception occurred at the same moment though birth necessarily could not be simultaneous. If the question was how to account for twins born only a few minutes apart, but showing remarkable dissimilarity, a fitting answer was also found. The science was as yet young and imperfect, it was argued, its methods primitive and the instruments crude. "Everything that is hard to attain is easily assailed by the generality of men," is Ptolemy's complaint (2: 5). In thirty minutes the stars move seven and a half degrees, which however cannot as yet be measured. Yet the difference will affect the nature and fate of the twins. Given time and more intensive study and man's mastery over this facet of knowledge will be complete. For two thdusand years astrology was attacked by doubters and scoffers but skilfully defended by scientists. The fact is it was never quite refuted. It was merely deserted by astronomers after they had learned of Galileo's telescope and Kepler's ellipses which opened up fascinating and new horizons. Both Galileo and Kepler were however firm believers in the astrological lore and practitioners in the field.3 Yet, two or three generations after their deaths the basic astrological assumptions were denounced and ridiculed by scientists they helped to inspire and guide. Even the common people who knew nothing of telescopes, ellipses, light years or novae ceased believing in that elaborate rationale and logic which the great Ptolemy, Brahe and Kepler helped main- tain with much skill and finesse. No less complacent were the rationalizations which primitive people everywhere wove out of manr's rich imagination in defense of similar beliefs in the power of the stars. The astrological faith was found everywhere in the Old World and in the Americas, in Africa and in Australia, in fact wherever man lived and thought. Unlike the alphabet, the wheel, paper, print, glass, gunpowder, various foods, electricity and hundreds of other inventions and discoveries which originated in one particular place and diffused outward, astrology seems to have sprung up independently in many sections of the world. This would lead to the suspicion that there may be something in man which finds ready or gratifying expression in that particular belief. This suggestion deserves far greater attention than it has received in the past. The swing of nineteenth century thought was in the direction of denying man any innate nature differentiating him from other animals. Man was regarded as being entirely fashioned by conditioning forces, by necessity, desire for profits and material circumstances. The supposition that he him- self was endowed by nature with unique qualities as is a dog for barking, the male nightingale for sOng and the bee for honey-making or stinging, was heresy in the extreme, insidious rationalization of medieval superstitions. A close examination of the astrological faith will reveal that its origins are not too difficult to comprehend.4 Primitive man was probably more aware of his ego, his insecurity and his fears than we are today. Because of limited knowledge and experience, his egocentricity was strong. All he saw in nature 3 J. J. Fahie, Galileo and His Work (New York, I903). 4 T. O. Weddell, Medieval Attitude Toward Astrology (New Haven, I920). I25</page><page sequence="3">Journal of American Folklore or reasoned about was invariably related to himself, to his fate and feelings, to his needs, hopes and fears. He knew the stars more intimately than we do today, being more conscious of his immediate environment. His animal will to live which meant hope and prayer, his insecurity, egocentricity and his imagination unhampered by critically examined experience, necessarily helped create an attitude we term anthropomorphic. His struggle to understand nature was naive but real and human nonethe- less. Geniuses were born then as today and many of their achievements seem even more remarkable than those of recent times. Brilliant minds grappled with problems and sought to offer explanations even as such minds do today. But they could only think in terms of beliefs and values imposed upon them by their cultural heritage and the prevailing level of knowledge. Man always had some tools and instruments, crude though they may seem to later genera- tions, and the results of his labors constituted the legitimate science of the times. To what extent did human nature, which has not changed basically in the last fifteen thousand years or so, direct the course of his science and influence his hypotheses? Was the astrological faith due merely to ignorance or was it more precisely a scientific attempt by a reasoning being conditioned by an inherent egocentricity and an innate will to believe? Similarly with other superstitions. Are they merely the random results of ignorance or are they forced expressions of innate emotional needs or desires which in the course of history may become suppressed, diverted or sup- planted by knowledge, by new trends or new folklores, but never quite eradicated? Experiments can be designed to answer these questions. For convenience the subject of divination was selected because it prevailed so widely in the past and because it still wields considerable influence over modern people. Divination seems to have been an obsession with primitive people every- where. Man looked for omens in every phenomenon that showed changes, as for example, in the shapes of clouds, the flight of birds, the falling of leaves, the peristaltic movements of the intestines of sacrificed animals, the lines on palms or soles of feet, the dance of flames and the rolling of smoke, the cracks in bones placed in fire, the position of stars, planets and comets, the reflec- tions of objects in glass bowls, floating leaves, the positions of falling dice or sticks and what not. A given medium merely played the same role as a particular language in human communication. The need or desire was basic and the form was of secondary importance. Most primitive tribes maintained a variety of oracles and had their expert seers and diviners who were feared and respected and often persecuted. The Bible forbids all such practices, though it relates without comment that Joseph's steward accused Benjamin of having stolen his master's favorite cup used for purposes of divination. Judaism and Christianity could not harmonize divination with their schemes of monotheism and free will though the proscribed beliefs persisted nevertheless among their people for millennia.6 5 G. L. Kittredge, Witchcraft in Old and New England (Cambridge, 1929). I26</page><page sequence="4">Some Contemporary Observations on Ancient Superstitions It is false to assume that the diviners were charlatans and thieves, the racketeers of the past. On the contrary. Even casual familiarity with primi- tive society reveals that these men were the wise, the learned, and the leaders of the community or tribe. Moreover, no matter how strongly they believed in the symbols which they learned to decipher and no matter how accurately they strove to record them, they invariably permitted common sense evalua- tion of actual circumstances to influence their decisions. Consequently, their judgments were more often than not tempered with realism, social vision, human understanding and sound advice.6 The enthusiasts of the nineteenth century made short shrift of the entire problem. Superstition was nothing but ignorance, and all current beliefs based on past superstitions were vestigial afflictions. Knowledge and reason would spell the doom of such beliefs as surely as of religion (the opiate of the people), war (imperialistic conflict), race or group hostilities (ruling class propaganda), and other residues of a dark past or contemporary economic causes. Many went beyond these predictions and foresaw a happy society without evil and conflict, even as clearly as the prophets and believers of the past saw the outlines of the coming Kingdom of God. If we assume however that there might be some forces in man which oblige him to take the easy course leading toward particular beliefs, always well and readily rationalized, we shall be more tolerant of such transgressions and less ready to condemn or ridicule our ancestors. Since knowledge is power we may even be able to replace such unsound beliefs by scientifically sound ones. Broadly speaking, by understanding the nature of belief we may be in a position to exert some influence upon human conduct and perhaps guide the course of social evolution toward goals generally agreed upon. In a way the Biblical story of Saul is symbolic of the manner in which we ourselves often act. When King Saul was young and full of hope and con- fidence he exterminated all the seers and witches in Israel. Things went well and he knew God was with him. But when the future brought many troubles and the enemy prevailed and he was forsaken and helpless, he went in the darkness of the night to seek out the witch of Endor whom he begged to bring back the ghost of Samuel to aid him. The method and the findings of the natural sciences should justly inspire us with confidence and hope. But unless we also know man, the strength and weakness residing in the warp and woof of his psychological being, our con- fidence and hope may well serve as emotional delusions on a par with divina- tion and astrology. * * * * To study the emotional drives to illusion leading to much superstitious belief, the simple step was taken of reading people's fortunes. One could then observe people's reactions and study the reasons for the popular appeal of this preoccupation with the unknown. One could also note the kind of people to whom these superstitions appeal and those who remain hostile or neutral to them. It was felt that direct observations could be more helpful than mere explanations, regardless of their plausibility. 6 Paul Radin, Primitive Man as Philosopher (New York, I927). I27</page><page sequence="5">Journal of American Folklore The experimenter has to be rather cautious in approaching the business of reading fortunes. Toward more sophisticated individuals it is desirable to be humorously non-committal so that they remain puzzled whether the diviner is serious or not. Toward the more simple-minded it is preferable to be less facetious and more pompously "scientific." My approach consisted of ridiculing Gypsies who limit their divination mainly to talk of presents, marriage, children, trips, money, and so forth. These matters I declared to be trivial and superficial. My system was based, I declared earnestly, on the PCT method, which initials stand for Psycho-Catalytic-Therapeutic. It is superior to psychoanalysis because analysis implies breaking down of charac- ter while catalysis is a positive and constructive procedure since a catalyst speeds the reaction. The term therapeutic denotes its curing value because the method cures while it diagnoses and prognosticates. Couched in proper and intriguing scientific verbiage with a serious "science- tells-us" expression, the explanation never failed to impress or at least be- wilder. It is interesting to observe in passing what scientific lingo can ac- complish. Many were the people who were fascinated by incomprehensible scientific terms, by far fetched hypotheses which could not possibly be verified. Speak to such people of suppressions in infancy or nonage which led to one action or another twenty years later and the credulity is amazing. One cannot help thinking of Mark Twain's magician, Merlin, in his Connecticut Yankee. The more fantastic his account of what foreign monarchs were doing at the moment, the more readily people believed it. When Mark Twain asked Merlin what he (Twain) had in his closed hand or how Merlin knew what was taking place in remote places, the audience resented his profane intrusion and lack of respect for greatness and art. The same credulity, one cannot help commenting with due respect and timidity, is currently extended toward the new and divers schools of speculative psychology and psychoanalysis. People's love for speculative explanations seems as fervent today as ever, and doubters are promptly branded now as in the past with the stigma of old fogies and reactionaries, men of little scientific faith or vision. After a verbose and impressive introduction one proceeds to lay the cards on the table and to read their message with oracular indifference. One reads about subconscious desires, loves, passions and frustrations, driving hopes and ambitions about to come true or to be fulfilled after many obstacles are finally overcome. One reads about friends who failed to come to the subject's aid when most needed, about wonderful events soon to happen though threatened by some trivial obstacles, about some eventual trouble of a serious or petty nature and the like. It is best not to be final about anything if one can help it, but merely stir reminiscences and speculations. It is hardly necessary to go into greater detail in the matter of actual reading. What concerns us is the response of the subjects. What surprises one at first is the large number of people who seriously believe in various forms of prognostication. Among female secretaries and office workers as well as clerks and housewives it amounts to over fifty per- cent. Among the men in this social group it is much smaller, amounting probably to ten or the most twenty percent. About half of those who believe I28</page><page sequence="6">Some Contemporary Observations on Ancient Superstitions in fortune-telling had previously consulted professional diviners and paid them for their labors. Few believed they failed to get their money's worth. This is as true in smaller cities such as Worcester, Massachusetts, as in larger ones such as Boston, New York, and Washington. As a rule those who believe in astrology will also have some faith in palmistry or tea leaves and similar methods. The multiplicity of ways and means of gazing into the future does not disturb them. On the contrary, they merely regard it as fortunate that each person can choose his favorite or perhaps suitable technique. It is common knowledge that there are some people who blush more readily than others under identical circumstances. Similarly some individuals become flustered when they are the subject of conversation while others take it calmly and are no more perturbed than if the discussion were about the weather. Some people can take a joke while others cannot though they may try very hard. The egosensitivities of individuals vary widely and manifest themselves quite sharply in fortune-telling. Apparently education has something to do with the poise displayed by people who submit to having their fortunes told. Less educated people tend to take the matter more seriously and show greater nervousness. One is nevertheless surprised at the large number of college graduates who, whether firm believers in card reading or not, become flustered or nervous by the treatment. Generally speaking, people of marked emotional stability will not be particularly disturbed. Conversely those who live under some threat of suspense or anxiety will invariably take the prognostication more seriously. This is so natural a reaction that it hardly requires much expatiation. It is common knowledge that people who live under the shadow of tragic events directly involving them will be moved to tears more easily over a sad movie plot than people who live in smug comfort under no threat whatever. Yet, the innate constitutions of the people tested play an important role. Similarly, people who live under emotional tension seem to put faith in omens with great readiness. To cite an illustration, a person who is anxiously awaiting a letter of crucial significance in his life will feel involuntary concern when a postman passes by his home without stopping. He will look for omens in every event which touches upon, resembles, or is merely reminiscent of the situation that constitutes the source of his anxiety. There are of course people who retain even under such conditions their customary coolness and non- chalance, but they are relatively few in number. It is generally admitted that religious sentiments show a definite upswing in wartime, especially among the fighting forces. The same is also true for omens and charms. John Steinbeck writes as follows in an article in the New York Herald Tribune, one of a series he published in 1943 as war correspond- ent in the Mediterranean area: A great many soldiers carry with them some small article, some touchstone or lucky piece or symbol which, if they are lucky in battle, takes on an everincreasing im- portance. And being lucky in battle means simply not being hurt. The article is a factual description of the attitude of our soldiers to such I29</page><page sequence="7">Journal of American Folklore charms, of the means whereby such objects gain their magical reputations and what is claimed for, or expected of them. Steinbeck continues: The magic articles are of all kinds. There will be a smooth stone, an odd-shaped piece of metal, small photographs encased in cellophane. Many soldiers consider pictures of their wives or parents to be almost protectors from danger .... Sometimes coins are considered lucky, and rings and pins, usually articles which take their quality from some intimacy with people at home, a gift or the symbol of some emotional ex- perience.... It is interesting that as time in action goes on these magics not only become more valuable and dear but more secret also. And many men take up small rituals to cause their amulets to become active.... As time goes on and dangers multiply and perhaps there is a narrow escape or so, the amulet not only takes on an increasing importance, but actually achieves a kind of personality. It becomes a thing to talk to and to rely on. One such lucky piece is a small wooden pig about an inch long. Its owner, after having tested it over a period of time and in one or two tight places, believes that this little wooden pig can accomplish remarkable things. Thus in a bombing he held the pig in his hand and said, "Pig, this one is not for us." And in a shelling he said, "Pig, you know that the one that gets me gets you...." The association between a man and his amulet becomes not only very strong but very secret.... Also there is the feeling that the magic must not be called on too often.7 Essentially, we have here an intimate and reliable description of the human basis of primitive and perhaps even modern magic and faith. The emotions which motivate the superstitious behavior of these soldiers are as genuine as the emotions which produce love, friendship, self-preservation or fear of death. How foolish to think, as many of us apparently do, that superstitious fears, or even religion or medical theories are brought into being and main- tained by "vested interest."8 One might as well claim that food industries induce in us a desire to eat by clever advertising, or that dance-hall owners generate in young people the desire to dance by their propaganda. Unfortunately such a view has lately gained widespread credence. It is claimed by many that propaganda is a mighty, creative force and that Naziism, for example, won in Germany because of Goebbels' sly adroitness in that art. Generally speaking there evolved a philosophy we might describe as manipulationism which assumes that people can be manipulated at will in their political, social and emotional conduct, provided one knows the secret of propaganda. This view seems highly superficial. No one denies that propaganda, like advertising, can inflate individual or social forces or desires especially in times of insecurity, economic or political.9 But expressions of human conduct are also influenced by factors lodged in man's nature. These can be inflated or aroused by artificial stimulation, but have roots of their own which need to be watched lest they run wild. The environment can surely be effective in supressing some innate desires or beliefs and in enlarging others. It may divert some harmful drive into useful or neutral channels, or vice versa. It may even create some new, emotional beliefs, but their function 7 The author is indebted to Mr. John Steinbeck and the New York Herald Tribune for permission to reprint this passage. 8 B. J.

I30</page><page sequence="8">Some Contemporary Observations on Ancient Superstitions will usually be related to some deep-seated, previously expressed social trend. To understand or master social forces the student of man and society must not be deluded by fear of the too-often-abused phrase, human nature, but must study all relevant aspects of the problems at issue. It was similarly thought that superstitious practices such as fortune- telling, talismans, omens, amulets and charms were entirely generated by ignorance which was exploited by the greed and trickery of selfish priests and magicians.10 Historical studies of antiquity and of primitive society indicate that such is not the case. Indeed greed and trickery do exist in the world but there are other forces as well. There are apparently in most human beings certain emotional forces which cause them to submit readily to what is commonly called superstition. Education no doubt can modify this susceptibility, but only within certain limits. Under the impact of great inner stress even educated people respond with an ardent search for emotional balance. This does not mean that such people abandon their scientific skepticism or the benefits of their education. It does mean, apparently, that it is part of the nature of man to find solace in certain beliefs which soothe his fears and bring comfort to his ego, regardless of their unsound nature. For these reasons it is not surprising to find an American teacher give the following account: Over 20 years ago, when I was teaching anthropology at Barnard College, I once chanced to ask my students, distinguished as a group for their "modernity" and sophistication, whether they carried on their persons any objects to which they as- cribed magic-working properties, such as rings, amulets, lockets, necklaces, and the like. I called for written statements, unsigned. As a result one-half of the students present confessed to one or more sort of relevant belief or practice. In commenting upon these confessions to the class I remember having stated that some 50% of them had admitted their partial submergence in magical idiosyncrasies, whereas the other 50% had not had the courage to do so. Nothing has happened in my teaching ex- perience in the interim to change my judgment in this matter, apart from a possible shift in percentages.1 It would seem that the so-called mechanistic attitude toward human conduct which has prevailed since the last century is somewhat over- simplified. It rested upon certain assumptions which have been insufficiently questioned and which were novel enough to lead people to believe that all those who were reluctant to accept them wholeheartedly were defenders of the dark ages. Economic forces, it is claimed, are generators of all individual and social activity and explain the particular forms of prevailing beliefs and institutions. Conditioned reflexes are pictured as the cement with which habits or beliefs are woven into the constitution of the individual. It is true that the findings of heredity disturbed this philosophical harmony somewhat 10 A. D. White, A History of Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom (2 vols. New York, 191o). 1 A. Goldenweiser, An Introduction to Primitive Culture (New York, 1932) 212. See also E. S. Conklin, Superstitious Beliefs and Pratice Among College Students (American Journal of Psychology 3o: 83, I919). I3I</page><page sequence="9">Journal of American Folklore though not for long. The stimulating psycho-analytic hypotheses of repression and conflict went more strongly against the grain, but the economic inter- pretation like astrology of old has withstood many attacks and holds sway to this day over the minds of the vast majority of the educated groups in our society. It is not that the orthodox economic explanation is false. Its weakness lies in that it fails to point out that human action is strongly dominated by beliefs or current folklore which more often than not determine what is an economic good and what is not. Man is apparently not quite comparable to a rudderless boat that drifts as the wind listeth. Nor can he be compared to an old vessel to be emptied and filled with new wines in accordance with the dictates of changing economic or political conditions. That economic forces exert an influence hardly needs proof. What seems most unique about man however is not that he is thus influenced, but that he displays unique characteristics which manifest them- selves throughout history, in spite of a vast variety of climatic conditions and cultural organizations. Anthropological studies reveal that such institutions as religion, some form of the family, a desire for decorative art, for song and dance, some kind of governmental organization, some form of group con- sciousness as well as group hostilities, war, belief in the supernatural, and a number of other institutions have existed in every kind of society. It is not unreasonable to conclude that in all likelihood there are forces in the nature of man which these institutions reflect. Their particularized ex- pressions may vary widely. They may even be supplanted. Yet the facts seem to indicate that they are part of man's basic conduct and not merely imposed upon him by circumstances. Upon the truth of either of these explanations or assumptions depends our success in shaping individual and social behavior, if the good society which prophets and dreamers envisage and most men desire, is to be a reality. If it is admitted, for example, that many people under emotional stress or because of a constitutional inclination are attracted to omens or fortune- telling, then we will desist from calling them ignorant or duped victims of religion, of gypsies, or of superstition. Our evaluation of their conduct and our attitude toward them will be based on understanding rather than con- demnation or ridicule. The consequences will be as contrasting as those resulting from the different attitudes toward the insane in the fifteenth and in the twentieth centuries. Knowledge of the forces generating the evil may well lead to means of combatting it. It may also be that control over such social evils as war, race prejudice, group hostilities, snobbishness or greed may be improved by further study of what might be called inner trends, though of necessity viewed against a back- ground of history. We might discover that truth alone does not make man free, if some psychological factors stand in the way. For complete control it will be essential to learn what these factors are and where they stem from, whether from heredity, conditioning, insecurity, aggression or other combined or single sources. Here again the experimental approach combined with the historical and anthropological points of view can be of considerable help. I32</page><page sequence="10">Some Contemporary Observations on Ancient Superstitions 133 The original and stimulating suggestion of Ruth Benedict that such in- stitutions as marriage, group prejudice or militarism do not in all likelihood possess existences of their own but serve merely as avenues for a culture's expression, may not completely describe the situation.12 It may perhaps be more accurate to assume that in addition to neutral social outlets which do exist, there are some which are biologically or psychologically predetermined in content or direction, though not in form. Hence, the cultural expression is an interaction between the socio-cultural and the residual forces, rather than a mere flow through a random outlet. Differentiation between these two descriptive hypotheses is important. Should the former explanation prove accurate rather than the latter, the process under discussion is more comr plicated and requires greater study and effort for ultimate control. Washington, D.
