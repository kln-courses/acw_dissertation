<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 3: ecology and environmental awareness  in 1960s–1970s Terraforming Stories ecology and environmental awareness The 1960s–1970s new Wave of sf was a period of experimentation  during which the tropes of the 1950s pulp tradition were transformed.  ecological concerns became an integral element of the socio-political  engagement of the terraforming stories of this period. responding  to the impact of the 1960s counterculture, sf began to diverge from  the consensus futures of the 1950s. Depictions of proto-gaian worlds  were directly associated with the motif of terraforming and presented  counter-arguments against planetary adaptation. although ecological  themes have fed into representations of terraforming since the 1930s,  terraforming stories of the 1960s–1970s were premised on the emergence  of new ecological landscapes that reflected a sense of environmental  urgency. The scientific aspects of ecology were combined with a strand  of mysticism reminiscent of early twentieth-century vitalism, but were  informed by a growing popular interest in socio-political institutions  and practices alternative to those ideologically dominant at the time.  This shift owes its character to the proliferation of ecologically oriented  communes and the growth of ‘hippie’ culture in america, along with  experimentation in ecological design, appropriate technologies and  sustainability, which were widely popularised by Stuart Brand’s Whole  Earth Catalog (1968). These countercultural influences provided new  contexts for the terraforming narrative to respond to the ways sf had  traditionally landscaped nature. anna Bramwell argues that the counterculture of the 1960s was  preceded by a distinctive tradition of radicalism that had existed for  150 years: ‘not only had Utopian communities been founded by native  americans and recent european immigrants, but a strain of asiatic  mysticism and occultism among communards had an equally long  history’ (1990, 94). if a commune is, as Bramwell argues, a planned  social experiment, then the colonies of the 1950s terraforming narratives  are also communes. The experimentation involved in transforming the  98 </page> <page sequence="2"> eCoLogY anD enVironmenTaL aWareneSS 99 environment is linked to a social experiment with motives that, while  certainly ecological, were also influenced by religion and politics (92).  The findhorn foundation, established in Scotland in 1962, exemplifies  the new ecological discourse that was being cultivated in the 1960s.  Promulgating a belief in a spirit world underlying the physical and the  coming of a ‘new age’ ‘that would be born when men realised their  place in nature,’ such communities re-contextualised the experiment  underlying the commune and influenced a multitude of other environ- mental discourses, which in turn influenced sf (100–01). Brian Stableford  has argued that the mystical aspects of ecology more often than the  scientific have ‘forged a crucial bond with the history of utopian  thought, helping to redefine notions of eutopia (and hence of dystopia)  and eventually necessitating the coinage of the term “ecotopia”’ (2010,  259). ecology offered an all-embracing paradigm that could cater to what  Tom moylan has, in the context of the critical utopia, referred to as an  alliance of independent groups and interests converging on autonomy;  in ecological terms this autonomy is predicated on an awareness of the  interconnectedness between elements of nature (1986, 27–28). Links  between the communes of the 1960s–1970s counterculture and the  utopian and dystopian communities depicted in terraforming narratives  since the 1950s illustrate a complex weaving of multiple discourses  within the sf megatext. in contrast to this tradition of mysticism was another that sought  solutions to environmental problems through innovative ecological  thinking and design, the appropriate use of technologies and environ- mental advocacy. This approach was pragmatic and optimistic in  orientation, and promoted conscientious use of environmental research  and science to explore alternatives to contemporary practices and to  effect wide-ranging change through the mobilisation of individuals  who would take the shaping of their destiny into their own hands.  Stuart Brand’s Whole Earth Catalog was the voice of this tradition, and its  popularity inspired many to explore ways to engage with environmental  issues. The Whole Earth Catalog collects a range of articles from reviews  of books and technologies, surveys of the work of various thinkers in  a range of disciplines, historical primers and other items, all of which  are subordinated to the subtitle of the text, ‘access to tools.’ among  articles on Buckminster fuller and tensile structures, the first issue  reviewed Steve Baer’s Dome Cookbook (1967) and the geoengineering text  Man’s Role in Changing the Face of the Earth (Thomas, 1971 [1956]), along  with frank Herbert’s Dune. in the 1970s–1980s writers such as William  S. Burroughs, Ursula K. Le guin and ernest Callenbach contributed  to the Whole Earth Catalog and its successors and revivals, along with  </page> <page sequence="3"> 100 Terraforming scientists James Lovelock and Lynn margulis. Brand controversially  explored the issue of space colonisation and produced a collection on the  theme entitled Space Colonies (1977), which was influenced by the ideas  of gerard o’neill and which emphasised the link between sf and the  pragmatic, technologically oriented environmentalism of the Whole Earth  Catalog. although andrew g. Kirk notes that the Whole Earth Catalog is  informed by an environmental utopianism that was especially clear in  the debate over space colonies, he argues that ‘[t]rends that were initially  utopian often get tempered by time, evolving into more practical versions  of the revolutionary thinking that spawned a period of great creativity’  (2007, 10). Sf influenced the revolutionary thinking Kirk describes; the  dialogism of the mode can be seen as a feedback system that refigures  tropes and narratives in response to the needs and desires of society.  Like the Whole Earth Catalog, the terraforming tradition can be read as  a catalogue of tools for adaptation and as responses to landscaping and  technologically driven societal change. it was not until James Lovelock’s popularisation of his hypothesis  during the 1970s–1980s that the gaia motif became a symbol for the  blend of mysticism and science in ecological sf. nevertheless, stories  such as richard mcKenna’s ‘Hunter, Come Home’ (2001 [1963]) and  James White’s ‘major operation’ (1971a) depicted the terraforming of  proto-gaian worlds, thus anticipating the important links between these  two motifs. The gaia hypothesis originated from Lovelock’s work as an  independent scientist at naSa in 1965, but was first widely popularised  in his 1979 Gaia (1987). This hypothesis ‘views the biosphere as an  active, adaptive control system able to maintain the earth in homeostasis’  (Lovelock, 2006, 22). according to Lovelock, living organisms actively  influence their environment in ways that stabilise climatic fluctuations  and help maintain a state of regulation. Lovelock argues that earth’s  apparently discrete ecosystems are connected and form a vast planetary  system that can be thought of as a single superorganism. Like a bee’s  nest, superorganisms are ‘bounded systems made up partly from living  organisms and partly from nonliving structural material’ (Lovelock,  1995, 15). This global outlook considers both biotic and abiotic processes  as parts of a system, necessitating a holist approach to scientific practice. This holism was informed by theories of cybernetics first popularised  by norbert Wiener’s foundational work, Cybernetics (1948), and by his  examination of the social aspects of cybernetics in The Human Use of  Human Beings (1950). Concepts such as feedback systems, communication  and control were central and greatly influenced the whole systems theory  that provided a basis for the ecologism of the Whole Earth Catalog. Brand  was inspired by Buckminster fuller and his notion of postscarcity and  </page> <page sequence="4"> eCoLogY anD enVironmenTaL aWareneSS 101 Spaceship earth, his ‘dymaxion’ design philosophy, which promoted  efficiency and called for multidisciplinary or omnidisciplinary thinking,  his invention of the geodesic dome and his creation of the World game,  which challenged players to find solutions to ecological and social  problems for the whole of the global population. in 1975, Lovelock and  his collaborator Lynn margulis published an article in the Whole Earth  Catalog’s successor, the CoEvolution Quarterly, which disseminated the  gaia hypothesis to a wider american readership already primed by the  exploration of related ideas in ecological design and cybernetics. in 1969 Lovelock’s neighbour William golding proposed ‘gaia’ for  the name of his scientific hypothesis. This suggestion controversially  associated the greek goddess gaia, a personification of the earth and  related to the pagan image of a great mother, to a scientific hypothesis  which implied that the earth itself was like a living organism. This  was compounded by Lovelock’s own spiritual outlook: he claims in  the chapter ‘gaia and god’ in The Ages of Gaia that ‘[l]iving itself is  a religious experience’ (1995, 192). although he is adamant that his  view of gaia is not religious, that earth is not analogous to a god and  possesses no consciousness of its own, he explains that the fact that  ‘gaia can be both spiritual and scientific is, for me, deeply satisfying’  (204). new age spiritualism greatly developed the implications of this  mythic image of a great mother in Lovelock’s popularisation of the gaia  hypothesis, and yet the Californian ecologism promoted by the Whole  Earth Catalog also emphasised a synthesis of nature and technology that  rejected spiritualism and the collective, technocratic management of  the environment in favour of a pragmatic enthusiasm for alternative,  low-impact technologies. The terraforming texts of the 1960s–1970s can be divided into those  narratives that present a clear continuity with the stories of the 1950s in  terms of their form, themes, and narrative elements and the proto-gaian  narratives distinctive to this period. a third trend appears towards the  end of the 1970s and develops the implications of pantropy in relation  to terraforming. including such stories as John Varley’s ‘retrograde  Summer’ (2001 [1975]), frederik Pohl’s Man Plus (2000 [1976]) and  David gerrold’s Moonstar Odyssey (1977), this trend will be excluded  from consideration for reasons of space and because the works would  be more productively considered in the context of a wider discussion of  transhumanism, posthumanism and cyberpunk. John Brunner’s Stand  on Zanzibar (1999 [1968]) and The Sheep Look Up (1972) have made  significant contributions to ecological sf. His less well-known novels  Bedlam Planet (1982 [1968]) and The Dramaturges of Yan (1974 [1972])  explore terraforming and gaian themes, yet they would also be better  </page> <page sequence="5"> 102 Terraforming examined in the context of human–animal studies and posthumanism.  one group of narratives in this period engage in dialogue with the earlier  1950s tradition of terraforming stories and look forward to those of the  1980s–1990s. Stories belonging to this group include frank Herbert’s  first three Dune novels (1965; 1971 [1969]; 1976), robert Heinlein’s  The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress (2001 [1966]) and Ursula K. Le guin’s The  Dispossessed (1999 [1974]). another group of texts evidence a resurgence in the popularity of the  living world motif, which appeared only infrequently throughout the  1950s. These proto-gaian stories were part of the confluence of ideas  that fed into the popular environmental movement and which informed  sf’s ecological discourse. The 1960s–1970s environmental movement  also provided a context for understanding the gaia hypothesis and for  developing its latent mysticism. Stories belonging to this group include  richard mcKenna’s ‘The night of Hoggy Darn’ (1964 [1958]) and ‘Hunter,  Come Home’ (2001 [1963]), Le guin’s ‘Vaster Than empires and more  Slow’ (1982 [1971]) and The Word for World Is Forest (1976 [1972]), and  James White’s ‘meatball’ (1971b [1969]) and ‘major operation’ (1971a).  Lem’s Solaris (2003 [1961]) was written in part as a response to american  sf; for this reason and because it features a living world, this chapter  explores its significance in the context of its 1970 english translation.  ernest Callenbach’s Ecotopia (1978 [1975]), discussed at the end of this  chapter, foregrounds the widespread impact of ecology during this period.  it is with the proto-gaian texts that this discussion begins. 1960s–1970s Proto-Gaian Living Worlds mcKenna’s ‘The night of Hoggy Darn’ and ‘Hunter, Come Home’ were  both published before Lovelock formulated the gaia hypothesis. They  illustrate how certain sf themes shaped the motif of a living world that  began to be considered in ecological terms as ‘whole’ and ‘connected.’ in  ‘The night of Hoggy Darn,’ a genocidal war between humankind and an  indigenous dinosaur-like species of alien known as ‘stompers’ forms the  core of the story. in ‘Hunter, Come Home,’ ames the ecologist struggles  against the aggressive mordinmen to prevent them from unleashing a  virus that could destroy an unnamed planet’s ecosystem. ‘Hunter, Come  Home’ rewrites the narrative of ‘The night of Hoggy Darn’ in ways that  reflect a shift in sf towards a transformative environmentalism that  draws from countercultural politics. flinter Cole, the protagonist of ‘The night of Hoggy Darn,’ explains  that he is ‘an ecologist – that means i deal with everything alive, and  </page> <page sequence="6"> eCoLogY anD enVironmenTaL aWareneSS 103 the way it all works in with climate and geography. i can use any kind  of data’ (mcKenna, 1964, 9). recognition of the interconnectedness  of phenomena within an ecological system is part of Cole’s holist  approach to understanding the planet and the colonists. He borrows  from a tradition of energy economics when linking this outlook to the  theme of energy flowing through an ecosystem, explaining that he must  ‘make energy flow charts’ documenting the interactions between life  on the planet new Cornwall (9). The text explores the dimensions of  a mythic-poetic response to its central conflict, what Cole describes as  ‘the greed-murder of species’ because he believes it to be motivated by  the colonial trade in stomper eggs, a delicacy that resonates with the  historical exploitation of now extinct species on earth. Cole learns that  the stompers have been feeding on wild and captured humans; the logic  of energy flows advanced by the text assigns to their eggs the status of  ‘human flesh at one remove’ (42). Two human groups inhabit new Cornwall: the ‘subnormals who are  so powerfully drawn to run back to the forests’ and those colonists who  retain a comparatively sophisticated technological culture and maintain  contact with the wider interplanetary civilisation (mcKenna, 1964, 41).  The subnormals have developed their own spiritual explanation for the  conflict between humans and stompers. garth Bidgrass, head of Bidgrass  Company, describes the subnormals’ account of the conflict as ‘a strange  mixture of poetry and prophecy’ and mythologises the colony’s struggle  with the stompers by casting it as a conflict between the archetypes  grandfather man and grandfather Stomper (41). Cole tells Bidgrass to  ‘[t]hink of a species as one great animal that never dies, of which each  individual is only a part’ (41). Bidgrass connects Cole’s ecologism to  myth when he explains that ‘your notion of the greater animal, critical  biomass [...] [w]e speak of grandfather Stomper and we are trying to  kill him. He is trying to enslave grandfather man’ (31). The concept of  critical biomass possesses gaian overtones and refers to the total mass  of a particular species; if it falls below a critical threshold the species  is unable to maintain a stable population and becomes extinct. Cole  is caught in a narrative of prophecy, one that foretells how ‘the new  grandfather man will come naked out of the forest with his beautiful  wife and armed with a thigh bone, that will lead us in the even greater  task of reclamation that comes after’ the death of grandfather Stomper  (58). The links between ideas of ecological connectedness, proto-gaian  images of biomass and the foregrounding of archetypal figures illustrate  the sf weaving of myth and science. ‘The night of Hoggy Darn’ uses  prophecy to transform Cole’s experience of time into a narrative that  </page> <page sequence="7"> 104 Terraforming relates, in mythic terms, a new sense of collective purpose and habitation.  The mutual deaths of grandfather man and grandfather Stomper in  combat allow Cole the space to establish a new set of relations outside  of the cycle of conflict on new Cornwall. as this space comes at the  price of the genocide of the stompers, ‘The night of Hoggy Darn’ accepts  the necessity of conflict and human conquest, albeit in ways that are  problematic. Bidgrass, for instance, admits that the early colonists ‘killed  off the great, stupid herds of darv cattle on which the stompers fed. The  stompers that survived became wary and hostile’ (mcKenna, 1964, 38).  The colonists are clearly the aggressors, which may partly account for  why mcKenna chose to rewrite this story as ‘Hunter, Come Home.’ in  this narrative, he further develops the chronotope of the forest as a space  of interconnection and transformation, demonstrating the development  of a motif that is central to the gaia theme. in ‘The night of Hoggy Darn,’ Cole becomes trapped in the forest and  begins a ‘fantastic journey [that] wound over great gnarled roots and  buttresses fusing and intermingling until it seemed that the root-complex  was one unthinkably vast organism’ (mcKenna, 1964, 50). mcKenna  makes this theme central to the narrative of ‘Hunter, Come Home.’  in this story two groups attempt to colonise a nameless planet, the  mordinmen’s aggressive hunting society and the scientific Belconti. The  planet is populated by ‘phytos,’ which the Belconti midori explains to  Craig, the mordinmen protagonist, are ‘mixed plant and animal. Life  never split itself apart on this planet’ (mcKenna, 2001, 77). The two  groups of colonists attempt but fail to displace the phyto ecology, which  encourages the mordinmen to deploy the Thanasis virus in an attempt to  sterilise the planet. The Belconti Sidis explains that ‘[w]ith translocation,  Thanasis can redesign its own free-systems in the field [...]. it could come  up with something impossible to immunize, something no control virus  we know how to make could handle. Then it would kill us and rule the  planet itself’ (73). Conflict occurs between a planet’s whole ecology and  human biological technologies, against which a smaller-scale struggle is  played out between the constraining mores of mordinmen society and  Craig and midori’s developing romance. Sidis notes that ‘the phyto stems are all rooted together underground  like one huge plant,’ while midori explains that ‘[the phytos] form a kind  of biochemical intelligence, almost a mind, and it’s learning faster than  we are’ (mcKenna, 2001, 72, 77). midori connects this visionary insight  into the nature of the phytos to the theme of an alien consciousness  emerging from the ecological system’s interaction with an other: ‘just  think of the agony and the changings, through all the long years men  have been trying to kill this planet. What if something ... somehow ...  </page> <page sequence="8"> eCoLogY anD enVironmenTaL aWareneSS 105 suddenly understands?’ (87). midori connects love of people to a love of  nature in one scene where, as Craig pilots a flyer over the forest, they  witness a group of migratory phytos which, in midori’s words, ‘stain the  air with beauty! [...] it knows i love it’ (86). midori’s affective response  to nature’s beauty in turn awakens Craig to a new appreciation of the  phyto ecology. Human connectedness to nature is literalised at the conclusion of this  story through the concept of ‘resorption.’ Craig and midori are exiled  from the colonial settlement and, in a variant of reincarnation, they  become infected with Thanasis only to have the phytos reconstitute their  bodies and their consciousness molecule by molecule. earlier, midori tells  Craig that ‘this planet has never known death or decay. everything is  resorbed and reconstituted. We try to kill it and it suffers but its – yes,  its mind – can’t form the idea of death. There’s no way to think death  biochemically’ (mcKenna, 2001, 78). The energy flows that appear in  ‘The night of Hoggy Darn’ are thus refigured as midori and Craig become  continuous with alien nature in a version of the indistinguishability  model of deep ecology, where the boundary between humankind and  the rest of nature is erased. This continuity is joined to the theme of  wholeness, generated through connections, and love: ‘[t]his life never  split apart, roy. in wholeness there is nothing but love’ (96). Their  rebirth is depicted as a state of edenic innocence: ‘[s]he was smiling  radiantly. They were both naked. He was not excited and not ashamed’  (96). midori raises the romantic theme of the human observer’s role in  actualising the universe – as in William Blake’s The Marriage of Heaven  and Hell (1975 [1790]) – which makes humankind integral to a nature  that can only conceive of itself through others’ self-conscious reflection.  She explains to Craig that [l]ike each littlest phyto, we are thoughts in that strange mind. i  think we focus its awareness, somehow, serve it as a symbol system,  a form-giver. [...] We are its thoughts that also think themselves,  the first it has ever had [...] [i]t is a great and holy mystery, roy.  only through us can it know its own beauty and wonder. it loves  us and needs us. (mcKenna, 2001, 97) midori privileges beauty and wonder as the two aesthetic responses  towards nature most appropriate to human interaction with the phyto  ecosystem. Burke and Kant support the link between beauty and love  in their discussion of the beautiful, but the connection between wonder  and need is more oblique. This network of linked impulses constitutes  ‘a great and holy mystery,’ a state that resonates with Stan godlovitch’s  </page> <page sequence="9"> 106 Terraforming emphasis on mystery as humankind’s most prominent reaction to nature’s  otherness (1997). echoing the theme of the inconceivable in Stapledon’s  Star Maker, midori views the ecosystem as evolving towards the use of  biotic life as a language to express its own otherness. midori landscapes  these expressions as thoughts, recalling nineteenth-century views of  personified nature as a divine mind. Like murray Leinster’s living world  in ‘The Lonely Planet’ (1949), the phyto ecosystem is dependent on  interaction with otherness in the form of environed human consciousness  to allow it to develop an awareness of its own processes. Humanity  provides new symbols in the form of language, thought and emotion with  which the ecosystem can continue to shape and express itself. James White’s Sector general stories ‘meatball’ and ‘major operation’  hark back to the 1950s space opera and develop terraforming and  proto-gaian themes separately from the network of tropes established by  mcKenna and Le guin. Their significance lies not in their contribution to  the tropological complex for which the image of the living forest stands  as an emblem, but in an alternative treatment of the terraforming and  proto-gaian intersection during this period. nevertheless, connections to  the chronotope of the forest are raised through description of life forms  like ‘great tracks of living “land” covered with the tiny, long-rooted  plants which might or might not serve as the strata beast’s eyes’ (White,  1971a, 124). Sector general Hospital is a multi-environment spaceship specialising  in alien medicine; ‘meatball’ relates an encounter with an alien species  on the planet Drambo who appear to act analogously to leucocytes. They  maintain the health of strata beasts, vast creatures the size of continents  that have been under attack by indigenous aliens recently in possession  of atomic power. in line with Sector general Hospital’s mission to provide  medical care to all sentient life, Dr Conway proposes a vast project aimed  at preserving the life of the strata beasts. ‘major operation’ follows from  the events of ‘meatball’ after a surgical operation has been devised that  utilises the medical benefits of the alien leucocytes discovered in the  first story. in ‘major operation,’ Conway and the interspecies medical  team discover that one of the strata beasts is intelligent. The surgical procedure envisaged for the strata beast takes the form  of an advanced engineering project: ‘[t]o a hypothetical observer ignorant  of the true scope of their problem this medical treatment could have  been mistaken for a very widespread mining operation, agriculture on  an even larger scale and mass kidnapping’ (White, 1971a, 152). The  medical treatment of the land resonates with Lovelock’s insistence on a  science of geophysiology, with scientists operating as physicians aiding  the planet to maintain a state of homeostasis. The choice of mining  </page> <page sequence="10"> eCoLogY anD enVironmenTaL aWareneSS 107 and agriculture as comparable activities to this surgical engineering  programme forms a motivic series that has shaped the significance and  meaning of terraforming throughout the tradition. Conway remarks  that ‘surgery on this scale will mean that the operation will be military  rather than surgical,’ which raises issues regarding the relationship  between military and medical institutions, along with issues of scale  and the capacity for human institutions to cope with projects of great  magnitude (White, 1971a, 118). Use of military resources raises several  ethical dilemmas regarding the motive for the project, while reference  to ‘mass kidnapping’ highlights a questionable relationship between  humankind and the various aliens on Drambo. The altruistic provision of medical assistance, along with the  opportunity to make contact with and perhaps learn from and  teach other intelligent aliens, are initial justifications, but the project  accelerates when it is discovered that there is an unknown intelligence  able to manipulate the shape and function of ‘tools’ with its thoughts.  These thought-malleable tools represent a resource of almost limitless  application. it is soon discovered that the strata beast undergoing surgery  mobilises them in self-defence, and only Conway’s chance encounter  and communication with the alien prevents further deaths amongst the  humans. as ‘major operation’ ends, Conway struggles with guilt over the  project’s casualties: ‘[a] rather supercilious cultural contact specialist had  tried to make it very simple for him by saying that difference, whether  it was cultural, physiological or technological, was immensely valuable.  They would learn much from the strata creature and the rollers while  they were teaching them. Conway, with some difficulty, accepted that’  (White, 1971a, 182). Conway’s guilt raises an issue that substrates the use  of the terraforming motif for both politico-cultural and environmental  philosophical speculation. These Sector general stories explore the values  and limits of peaceful contact with alien others, while the terraforming  motif is used to call into question the status of the values that accompany  humankind’s intervention in alien affairs. The suggestion of resource  exploitation and the potential military rather than medical application  of these tools makes peaceful human–alien relationships ambiguous. Lem’s Solaris offers a critique of the anthropomorphism latent in  scientific inquiry and the colonial conquest of space, themes central  to understanding the enviro-ethical engagement that the imaginative  spaces of terraforming and living world stories offer. Solaris reprises  the motif of the alien planet covered by an ocean-like organism seen  in murray Leinster’s ‘The Lonely Planet.’ Unlike alyx, it is truly alien;  the nature of its consciousness may never be definitively resolved. in  contrast to earth, the planet ‘had reached in a single bound the stage  </page> <page sequence="11"> 108 Terraforming of “homeostatic ocean”’ and ‘was capable of exerting an active influence  on the planet’s orbital path’ (Lem, 2003, 118–19). There is a tantalising  echo between Lem’s sublime and grotesque depiction of Kelvin’s reaction  to the eponymous planet and the pan-psychic narrator’s reaction to  the sublime figure of the Star maker, while the problem of analogising  nature’s otherness and the planet’s mystery recalls Stapledon’s portrayal  of the Star maker’s radical otherness. although Lem praises Stapledon’s Star Maker as ‘a completely solitary  creation’ that ‘defines the boundaries of the Sf imagination,’ he  nevertheless finds fault with the ‘double psychic nature of its ontology’  (Lem, 1987, 7, 2). This flaw rests on the failure to resolve a contradiction  between an image of the universe that exists teleomatically and possesses  intrinsic worth and one that is transcendental and sanctified by a higher  existence. Lem explains that deism leads to a ‘behaviouristic teleology’  in which ‘we can only reconstruct the axiomatics of choices relevant to  the highest values from the Star maker’s behaviour’ (3). The ambivalent  figure of the Star maker symbolises this contradiction between a material  and transcendental view of the cosmos. Despite decades of Solarist studies that proliferate explanatory theories  and scientific literature, the psychologist Kelvin reflects that humanity  is no closer to understanding the planet: ‘our scholarship, all the  information accumulated in the libraries, amounted to a useless jumble  of words’ (Lem, 2003, 23). This extended confrontation with the alien,  as with alyx in ‘The Lonely Planet,’ recapitulates sf’s autologic theme.  Solaris exposes the personification also undeniably latent in Lovelock’s  naming of the gaia hypothesis as an attendant problem in human  attempts to describe nature. Lem reacts against the american pulp  tradition of contact as equal exchange by ‘creating a hall of mirrors with  no windows from which to observe some privileged non-corresponding  structure of things’ (Csicsery-ronay, 1985, 12). Kelvin points out that  ‘[c]ontact means the exchange of specific knowledge, ideas, or at  least of findings, definite facts. But what if no exchange is possible?  if an elephant is not a giant microbe, the ocean is not a giant brain’  (Lem, 2003, 152). Solaris does not offer an insight into a proto-gaian  consciousness so much as it destabilises human attempts to acquire  knowledge of the cosmos by withholding the vantage of an external  perspective outside of the structures of scientific inquiry by which  to establish certainty. it reopens a space for the entrance of nature’s  otherness into the text by recourse to an aesthetic that godlovitch calls  a ‘sense of mystery’ in response to nature’s elusiveness (1994, 26). The moment where exchange between humanity and Solaris seems  closest occurs through a dream shared by Kelvin and the planet after  </page> <page sequence="12"> eCoLogY anD enVironmenTaL aWareneSS 109 it is bombarded with X-rays modelled after his mind structure. Kelvin  dreams that he has become a ‘prisoner of an alien matter,’ or rather  that his identity has become indistinguishable from the ocean planet:  ‘i have no body, i am that alien matter’ (Lem, 2003, 187). This dream  is located ‘in the heart of vastness,’ in a space that denies orientation  and volition (186). recalling the duality of mind in The Purple Cloud and  ‘The earth-Brain,’ identification with the planet offers an experience  with otherness that exceeds a narrowly human perspective, leaving  him feeling that he ‘has just left a state of true perception’ (187).  as the dream progresses, a splitting occurs in the indistinguishable  consciousness and Kelvin’s ego is simultaneously created and recreated,  thus anticipating mcKenna’s portrayal of a recreated ego in ‘Hunter,  Come Home,’ published two years after the original Polish edition of  Solaris. This split ego in turn creates another: ‘[w]e discover one another  mutually, beyond any effort of will, in an absorbed silence. i have  become alive again, and i feel as if there is no limitation on my powers.  This creature – a woman? – stays near me, and we are motionless’  (Lem, 2003, 187). Csicsery-ronay suggests that this scene represents  the possibility of some form of contact, and proposes that the figure is  rheya, created in a moment of co-operation between Kelvin and the  planet (1985, 10–11). interpretation is foreclosed by the structure of  the novel, suggesting the possibility that these dreams and projections  simply represent an apparently inescapable act of landscaping when  confronted with the ineffable. Like Stapledon’s narrator, Kelvin attempts  to describe his dream ‘in so far as my vocabulary permits, given that  i can convey only fragmentary glimpses almost entirely denuded of an  incommunicable horror’ (Lem, 2003, 186). Vastness, terrible silence and  the horror associated with the dream point to an experience both sublime  and grotesque and couple creation to the figure of the living world. Kelvin and the scientist Snow discuss a belief in an ‘imperfect god,’ a  ‘sick god, whose ambitions exceed his powers and who does not realize  it at first’ (Lem, 2003, 206). Snow describes this idea as ‘an evolving  god’ and suggests that this notion could apply to humanity, but Kelvin  argues that it is ‘an anchorite, a hermit of the cosmos, not a god,’ and  speculates that ‘[p]erhaps he has already been born somewhere, in some  corner of the galaxy, and soon he will have some childish enthusiasm  that will set him putting out one star and lighting another’ (207). These  explanations echo the narrator’s attempt in Star Maker to comprehend  the nature of the cosmos: they speak to the failure of the scientific  team in their attempts to understand the nature of Solaris, part of a  project of scientific enquiry lasting over a century that yields little in the  way of understanding or possibilities for contact with the alien. Snow  </page> <page sequence="13"> 110 Terraforming desperately speculates that ‘perhaps it wants to please us but doesn’t  quite know how to set about the job,’ recalling Leinster’s and Bradbury’s  depiction of proto-gaian planets whose agency is directed towards the  fulfilment of human desire (191–92). Human responses to cosmological nature, according to Snow, typically  disrespect its alien otherness. rafail nudelman suggests that in Lem’s  sf, ‘man is a tool of the self-cognizing cosmos to the same extent that  wandering in the cosmos’ labyrinth is a means of finding out about  himself’ (2000, 183). The emergence of consciousness in living world  stories such as Leinster’s and mcKenna’s and Solaris explores ways in  which humankind relates to the otherness of the cosmos, and how the  cosmos itself interacts with the human as its other. Snow explains the  metanarrative of space colonisation as a strategy of avoidance of the  other on our doorsteps rather than the desire for an encounter with  not only alien nature, but the familiar otherness of nature on earth:  ‘[w]e don’t want to conquer the cosmos, we simply want to extend the  boundaries of earth to the frontiers of the cosmos. [...] We are only  seeking man. We have no need of other worlds. We need mirrors. a  single world, our own, suffices us; but we can’t accept it for what it is’  (Lem, 2003, 75). failure to accept earth by extending the boundaries  of human identity to crowd otherness out is a psychological strategy  of colonial imposition. Solaris, however, continually defies not only  understanding, but analysis. otherness reveals the limits of humankind’s  explanatory devices; the scientific project is imagined not as a march  towards understanding but as a slower ‘stumbling, one- or two-step  progression from our rude, prehistoric, anthropomorphic understanding  of the universe around us’ (Lem, 2003, 178). The planet remains  incomprehensible; ‘an unbreakable silence’ is Solaris’s continued answer  to any attempt to make contact, thus fostering the many theories that  explain it according to ‘the widely held notion [...] that the “thinking  ocean” of Solaris was a gigantic brain [...] a sort of “cosmic yogi,” a  sage, a symbol of omniscience’ (24). Lem argues that this silence in  response to humankind’s attempt to apprehend the nature of the cosmos  is also the ultimate result of Stapledon’s treatment of the figure of the  Star maker: he ‘directs the traditional drama [of cosmogonic enquiry]  by manipulating not-entirely-traditional figures and symbols’ (1987, 7).  encounters with non-human others instigate a sense of mystery towards  nature that decentres humankind’s geocentric perspective. alluding in its title to andrew marvell’s ‘To His Coy mistress’  (2009 [1681]), Le guin’s ‘Vaster Than empires and more Slow’ features  an interconnected proto-gaian forest that recalls mcKenna’s forest  landscapes and Lem’s depiction of radical alien otherness and human  </page> <page sequence="14"> eCoLogY anD enVironmenTaL aWareneSS 111 interaction with that nature. a small group of colonists land on ‘a pure  phytosphere’ that they designate the planet 4470 (Le guin, 1982, 33).  mannon argues that the root nodes of the forest they have been studying  there ‘are, indubitably, connections. Connections among the trees. [...]  they are all interconnected, both by the root-node linkage and by your  green epiphytes in the branches. a linkage of incredible complexity and  physical extent’ (50). Harfex argues that the forest is ‘merely a network  of processes. [...] they must all be capable of transmitting electro- chemical impulses. [...] even the pollen is part of this linkage [...] a  sort of windborne sentience, connecting overseas [...] the biosphere of a  planet should be one network of communications, sensitive, irrational,  immoral, isolated’ (Le guin, 1982, 54). ‘Vaster Than empires and more  Slow’ is an important intervention into the proto-gaian narrative for its  reconceptualisation of the living world in terms of ecological principles.  Planet 4470’s isolation, its closed global-scale system and the emphasis  on communication characterise the planet as a cybernetic system. osden  has render’s syndrome, making him empathic but unable to control his  ability to reflect the distorted and strengthened emotions of others. This  dynamic recalls Lem’s portrayal of the living planet Solaris and parallels  the forest’s response to the colonising expedition; as an isolated entity,  it has never had the opportunity to respond to otherness. osden remarks that the forest is ‘[o]ne big green thought’ (Le guin,  1982, 54). The other colonists note ‘a hypnotic quality in the colors and  spacing of the stems and branches’ and question whether ‘the forest  ambiance has a rather troubling and possibly hallucinogenic effect of the  perception’ (38). mannon points out that he ‘feel[s] a strong anxiety with  a specific spatial orientation [...] [for] which the archetypal connotations  of the word ‘forest’ provide an inevitable metaphor’ (47). The forest is  a space that evokes a primordial terror which – like the hate and fear  that osden exacerbates – is a reflection of the affective response of the  colonists to the alien forest. osden’s answer to the positive feedback of  this cycle is to sacrifice himself by submitting to the fear that the forest  amplifies. Thus he hopes to establish communication with the forest  and transmit to it another signal based on a structure that, from the  human perspective, is implicit at the scale of cosmological phenomenon:  ‘[a] single human brain can perceive pattern on the scale of stars and  galaxies [...] and interpret it as Love’ (55). individuals are thus able to  translate these vast spaces into terms that can be understood at smaller  scales of experience. Le guin uses the proto-gaian forest as a motif to examine processes  of othering. The narrator explains that osden ‘had given up his self to  the alien, an unreserved surrender, that left no place for evil. He had  </page> <page sequence="15"> 112 Terraforming learned the love of the other, and thereby had been given his whole  self’ (Le guin, 1982, 58–59). Val Plumwood discusses one axis of the  logical process of dualism, radical exclusion, which works to ‘maximise  distance or separation between the dualised spheres and to prevent  their being seen as continuous or contiguous’ (1993, 49). accordingly,  osden’s ‘whole self’ is granted him only when he overcomes the fear and  hatred of the other and accepts what is alien. By bridging the distance  between dualised concepts, love becomes a strategy for overcoming  radical exclusion. in this light, the opposition between humankind and  stompers in ‘The night of Hoggy Darn’ and the humans and phytos  in ‘Hunter, Come Home’ can be seen as expressions and negotiations  of this logic of dualism. Crucially, the dualised terms are different in  as many ways as is possible: ‘[d]ualistic distinction aims to maximise  the number, scope, or significance of distinguishing characteristics’  (Plumwood, 1993, 50). The 1960s popular ecological notion of love as  it has been incorporated and rendered in gaian sf stories can be seen  as a metaphorical attempt to effect a synthesis between hyperseparated  terms of a dualism in order to overcome the self-destructive tendencies  underlying humankind’s approach to nature and other cultures. Terragouging: Time and the Forest myth is central to connecting the cultural attitudes and behaviour of  groups and the treatment of nature in Le guin’s The Word for World  Is Forest, a Vietnam-era story of a colonising force of Terrans who  subjugate the indigenous population of athshe and deforest the planet  to lessen earth’s deficit of this scarce resource. The theme of energy  flowing through an ecosystem draws from a tradition of new age  spiritualism influenced in part by a romantic conception of the myth  systems of tribal cultures. Le guin’s oeuvre draws from native american  culture and myth, an interest that can be traced back to her father, the  influential anthropologist alfred L. Kroeber, and her mother, Theodora  Kroeber, whose biography, Ishi in Two Worlds (1973 [1961]), helped shape  conceptions of native american mythology and popularised the idea of  their essential connection to nature. Her brother, Karl Kroeber, was an  academic, whose scholarship on the english romantics and on american  indian literature likewise influenced her fiction. Captain Davidson believes that ‘primitive races always have to give  way to civilised ones. or be assimilated. But we sure as hell can’t  assimilate a lot of green monkeys’ (Le guin, 1976, 12). He associates  nature, cultures lacking techno-scientific infrastructures and the animal  in a network of dualities that for him justifies the exploitation of the  </page> <page sequence="16"> eCoLogY anD enVironmenTaL aWareneSS 113 forest and the enslavement of the athsheans. This attitude is shared  by many of the other colonists: Colonel Dongh affirms that ‘they’re  not human beings in my frame of reference’ (12). The athsheans  understand the threat posed by the colonists against a religio-spiritual  background centred on their practice of ‘dreaming,’ a scientifically  measurable phenomenon that Captain raj Lyubov, an anthropologist  sympathetic to their plight, manages to detect while working with the  enslaved athshean Selver. once freed, he explains to his people that  ‘[the colonists] have left their roots behind them, perhaps, in this other  forest from which they came, this forest with no trees,’ and concludes  that ‘[n]o one can say certainly whether they’re men or not men,  whether they’re sane or insane, but that does not matter. They must  be made to leave the forest, because they are dangerous’ (44–45).  insanity as characteristic of the colonists’ treatment of the environment  is contrasted with the indigenes’ saner, spiritual relationship and works  to critique the instrumental rationalism underlying the colonial logic  of othering. Dreaming is deeply involved in the athsheans’ perception of time,  which in their world is intimately connected to their sense of place in the  forest. There is no sharp boundary between dream time and the world’s  time in athshean thinking, unlike the colonists’ demarcation between  these spheres along an unreal/real axis. The space of the forest itself is  oneiric and challenges the instrumental version of progress that informs  the colonists’ terragouging of the planet. as Lyubov learns more about  this aspect of their culture, he comes to believe that this sense of time is  central to any basic understanding of the athshean worldview: ‘[i]t was  Selver who had made him understand, at last, the athshean significance  of the word “dream,” which was also the word for “root,” and so hand  him the key of the kingdom of the forest people’ (Le guin, 1976, 100).  The words ‘dream’ and ‘root’ are connected semantically, and the words  ‘root’ and ‘forest’ metonymically, and because, as Lyubov claims, ‘[t]he  athshean word for world is also the word for forest,’ their cultural life is  revealed to be intimately connected to their environment (72). The clash between Selver and Davidson represents two sides of a  dualism that for Selver is self-conscious. During their final confrontation,  Selver tells Davidson that ‘we’re both gods, you and i. You’re an insane  one, and i’m not sure whether i’m sane or not. But we are gods’ (Le  guin, 1976, 160). This view mirrors the self-conscious use of mythic  archetypes in ‘The night of Hoggy Darn’ and invests this clash between  cultural representatives with a sense of urgency that accompanies the  development of a new cognitive relation to the world. Time is compressed  as the athsheans’ experience as members of a subject race is focused  </page> <page sequence="17"> 114 Terraforming upon Selver. The athshean word sha’ab for god also means ‘translator’;  through the act of translating dreams into reality the sha’ab brings a  gift to his people and thus becomes a god. Lyubov ponders whether  Selver ‘[m]ight [...] then be one who could translate into waking life  the central experience of vision: one serving as a link between the two  realities, considered by the athsheans as equal, the dream-time and  the world-time, whose connections, though vital, are obscure’ (106).  Through active dreaming, the submerged desires and fears of the people  as a whole can be confronted and, given sufficient need, brought into  the time of the real world. an old athshean dreamer claims that ‘[w]e  may have dreamed of Selver these last few years, but we shall no longer;  he has left the dream-time’ (34–35). The athsheans have called forth  a god in response to the thirty years of colonisation and exploitation  they have endured, one that will translate their new cultural experience  into terms they are capable of responding to, primarily by effecting a  change in athshean culture. Davidson, on the other hand, is a god who is unaware of his power  to make manifest his dreams. Selver comments of the colonists in general  that ‘[i]f they are men they are evil men, having denied their own gods,  afraid to see their own faces in the dark’ (Le guin, 1976, 45). These  gods can be understood as cultural tendencies that have been repressed  and disavowed, thus resulting in the monstrous emergence of practices  that lead to the exploitative treatment of nature and the indigenes. The officers’ reports on their impact on the indigenous ecosystem and  culture during a conference held between the military authorities and  two alien emissaries from the newly formed Council of the League of  Worlds demonstrate the extent of this denial. Colonel Dongh insists that  ‘[w]e do not employ slaves, sir. Some of the natives serve a useful role  in our community. The Voluntary autochthonous Labor Corps is a part  of all but the temporary camps here’ (63). Lyubov is the only officer to  provide an oppositional account of their actions: ‘[w]e have killed, raped,  dispersed, and enslaved the native humans, destroyed their communities,  and cut down their forests. it wouldn’t be surprising if they’d decided  that we are not human’ (62). in Le guin’s Hainish universe, all conscious  humanoid life on all of the known planets descended from an original  Hainish stock. This fact blurs the boundary between the human and  non-human sides of the dualism and undermines the related alien/ non-alien dualism that informs the colonists’ treatment of the athsheans.  it is significant that Colonel Dongh refuses to accept this idea as ‘the  historic fact,’ illustrating another denial of shared characteristics between  the athsheans and the colonists and marking the former from the latter  as a dualised other (64). </page> <page sequence="18"> eCoLogY anD enVironmenTaL aWareneSS 115 Selver and Davidson are manifestations of their cultures’ orientation  towards nature and other cultures. This relationship echoes mcKenna’s  earlier use of the mythic figures grandfather man and grandfather  Stomper, both of whom are microcosms and representatives of their  society and species. Davidson’s and Selver’s roles are instrumental  in defining the shape of their cultures’ future engagement with the  world and each other. Selver explains to Davidson that ‘[y]ou gave me  a gift, the killing of one’s kind, murder. now, as well as i can, i give  you my people’s gift, which is not killing. i think we each find each  other’s gift heavy to carry’ (Le guin, 1976, 160). Contact with a violent  culture has led the athsheans to adapt by appropriating violence, and  once incorporated into their cultural consciousness it cannot be shed.  recalling osden’s relationship to the forest in ‘Vaster Than empires and  more Slow,’ the arrival of the colonists disrupts the idyll of the forest  and instigates a feedback cycle between the two cultures, forcing the  athsheans to respond, not with love, as osden does in ‘Vaster Than  empires and more Slow,’ but with violence. This results in the athsheans’  loss of their greatest cultural triumph, which the Hainish emissary  Lepannon identifies as ‘[a] human society with an effective war-barrier!’  (61). This ‘war-barrier’ is overcome at the conclusion of the story as the  violence towards and reprisals by the athsheans establish a positive  feedback loop between the two cultures. The athsheans are ‘driven by  the evil dream [of killing] and only Selver could teach them how to  master it’ (113). Selver, however, is doubtful that they can return to a  time predating the internalisation of this violence: the clash of cultures  has inaugurated a sense of time that is linked to the beginning of a  new phase in the athshean worldview. Terraforming and proto-gaian stories combine sf’s religio-spiritual  language with a scientific perspective to develop a series of ecological  narratives that explore alternative conceptions of nature. important for  this ecological branch of sf is the development of proto-gaian motifs  and the representation of low-technology cultures living closely with  nature. mcKenna and Le guin developed proto-gaian themes of a  mythic-poetic character that represents one way in which sf explores  confrontations with a living landscape. another is the radical exclusion  of indigenous populations from the values associated with a colonial  culture. mcKenna depicts a mythic struggle between the indigenous  and recognisably non-human stompers and the colonists who have  lived for generations on the alien planet. in contrast to the pattern of  conflict that dominates space opera, White explores the problems that  arise as a consequence of peaceful yet potentially fraught contact with  alien others. The intersection of proto-gaian themes and the trope of  </page> <page sequence="19"> 116 Terraforming indigenous alien life as the object of an affective response creates a space  where these motifs are flexibly deployed to explore human relationships  to the non-human world in a variety of contexts. Underlying many of  these stories is a spiritual orientation to landscaping the non-human.  indigenous alien societies or living worlds are often exemplars of a  pseudo-pantheistic religion through which a connection to nature’s  otherness has been made. alongside these indigenous populations and colonial cultures are  characters living on the fringes of their social groups. as outsiders, they  come into contact with the indigenous as the site of projected values  that are seen as absent from earth and its societies. The space created  by the clash between cultural systems brings these individuals to a  heightened awareness of the beauty and sublimity of the non-human  world, and their affective responses lead them to quasi-spiritual modes  of perceiving and characterising nature. Sf thus develops a language that  puts into conflict religio-spiritual and rationalised exploitative modes of  understanding the world to explore a non-human nature that exceeds  its status as a resource to be used or a space to be colonised. Scientific  modes of perceiving the world, connected to but distinct from ration- alised exploitation, work to support these spiritual conceptions of nature. Terraforming in the 1960s–1970s Herbert’s Dune sequence, Heinlein’s The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress and  Le guin’s The Dispossessed do not depict living worlds, but rather use  terraforming to explore the political landscapes developed by earlier  terraforming stories, reconsidering them in the light of the wider cultural  shifts of the 1960s–1970s. as with terraforming in the 1950s, extreme  environments encourage the formation of tightly knit communities  where co-operation is central to survival. There is a struggle between  this sense of community and the perception and use of planets as prisons  or sites of oppressive government control, as Poul anderson portrays in  his nightmare vision of isolationist dystopias. The texts considered here rely on a political contrast that opens a  space for contesting voices to emerge. in Dune, the society in question  is a vast interplanetary empire constituted of ducal fiefdoms; Heinlein’s  The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress contrasts earth as a colonising centre  with the terraformed moon. in Le guin’s The Dispossessed, the political  opposition between Urras and its moon is complicated by the historical  concession of the moon (anarres) to the rebel odonians to prevent  further political destabilisation at the centre. recalling Dune and the  </page> <page sequence="20"> eCoLogY anD enVironmenTaL aWareneSS 117 interplanetary societies in the space opera of the 1950s, Le guin situates  her exploration in her Hainish universe, thus offering further contrasts  with a wider group of worlds. These works, like those of the 1950s,  borrow from the utopian tour, whereby a visitor to utopia is guided by  an inhabitant in surveying the alternative society, thus allowing that  society to be assessed from an outsider’s perspective. While Heinlein’s  main character – manuel garcia o’Kelly – is already integrated into  this society, the first-person address makes the target of the initiation  the implied reader. The political dimension of the theme of interconnectedness was  anticipated by Wells’s link between the physical landscape and human  nature on the one hand and by Heinlein’s interest in population  bionomics in Farmer in the Sky on the other. The transformations that  social governance brought to culture and the environment, often  abstracted into ecological issues such as overpopulation and resource  scarcity, continued to be popular throughout the 1960s–1970s. Herbert,  Heinlein and Le guin mobilise ecological principles in ways that connect  scientific ideas to society, establishing an ecopolitical context that  later terraforming stories would develop and dovetail with populari- sations of gaia. Heinlein’s Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) became  the unofficial bible of the counterculture, and his work, especially  The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, would greatly influence Brand and the  pragmatic ecologism that cohered around the Whole Earth Catalog. The  relationship between ecology and politics and the notion that human  landscapes form a necessary part of ecological thinking are now widely  accepted in environmental philosophy and were already prefigured  in the work of aldo Leopold, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and other  environmental philosophers and scientists. This cluster of texts illustrates  a shift in the character of the political engagement of stories dealing  with terraforming, pointing to a response on the writers’ part to the  political assumptions of earlier sf. Terraforming and Ecopolitics in the Dune Sequence Herbert attributes the initial inspiration for the Dune trilogy to an  uncompleted magazine article, ‘They Stopped the moving Sands,’ which  focused on the US Department of agriculture’s project to cultivate  poverty grass to bind sand dunes in florence, oregon. martyn fogg  writes in his preface to Terraforming that the nebraska Sand Hills,  having undergone a similar treatment, provides a ‘marvelous metaphor  [...] for terraformers,’ and he speculates, ‘[w]hat if we could engineer the  sand seas of Mars’ (1995, xii). These connections between geoengineering  </page> <page sequence="21"> 118 Terraforming and terraforming, between transformations of earth and other planets,  are typical of the ecological concerns of this type of narrative. Herbert  writes, ‘i could begin to see the shape of a global problem, no part of  it separated from any other’ and that ‘[a] new field of study rises out  of this like a spirit rising from a witch’s cauldron: the psychology of  planetary societies’ (2007). as one of the most influential examples of  ecological sf, the Dune trilogy’s treatment of nature and its holism –  which factors human worlds into ecological systems – have informed  sf discourse and influenced popular culture, thus helping to shape sf’s  future ecological vision. Dune begins with the ducal family atreides, who take possession of  the arrakeen feudal house, the political centre of the planet arrakis  and its spice-mining operations. it depicts a politico-economic struggle  over control of the planet, fought between the interplanetary empire  and the indigenous fremen, led by Paul atreides. Throughout the Dune  trilogy the spreading growth of plant life on the desert planet stands  as an emblem for fremen dreams of freedom, abundance and vitality.  as arrakeen’s influence grows after Paul becomes emperor at the end  of Dune, this dream is threatened by the destruction of an older form  of spiritual cohesion and reciprocity with the planet, symbolised by the  threatened disappearance of the deep desert, the sandworms, and the  supremely valued spice. as Dune concludes, Paul imposes his vision of a  future arrakis onto the emperor he has overthrown: ‘“The fremen have  the word of muad’Dib,” Paul said. “There will be flowing water here open  to the sky and green oases rich with good things. But we have the spice  to think of, too. Thus, there will always be desert on arrakis ... and  fierce winds, and trials to toughen a man[”]’ (Herbert, 1965, 462). This  image encapsulates the contrast between the wilderness of the present  arrakis and the promise of a pastoral synthesis between civilisation and  nature. Paul’s oath is a political act that focuses the inhabitants’ efforts  towards the shaping of a new future. The wilderness is valued not just  as an economic asset but for its role in developing individuals that can  be used as tools to enforce Paul’s sovereignty. Those who survive do  so because of their rigid discipline, their subordination to the welfare  of the group and their individual strength of character, traits aligned  with a heroic militarism imagined as an exclusively masculine domain.  James oberg cites Dune as exemplary of the examination of the role of  people in terraforming (1981, 120), while the theme of individuals and  groups who are used as tools continues to be an important influence  on terraforming narratives such as Pamela Sargent’s Venus of Dreams  (1989a [1986]). The planet’s importance as the sole source of spice provides the  </page> <page sequence="22"> eCoLogY anD enVironmenTaL aWareneSS 119 incentive for this instrumental use of communities and the land. Liet  Kynes is the imperial Planetologist, a position that, under Harkonnen  rule, amounted to the use of the ‘native labour pool’ to conduct the  terragouging of arrakis (Herbert, 1965, 26). Liet recalls his father Pardot  describing this political arrangement in economic and hierarchical  terms: ‘“arrakis is a one-crop planet,” his father said. “one crop. it  supports a ruling class that lives as ruling classes have lived in all times  while, beneath them, a semi-human mass of semi-slaves exists on the  leavings. it’s the masses and the leavings that occupy our attention.  These are far more valuable than has ever been suspected.”’ (Herbert,  1965, 262). Pardot’s scheme for terraforming arrakis seeks to tie the  fremen’s emancipation to a long-term project of world construction that  builds multiple levels of physical and cultural adaptation into a single  transformative network. Pardot believes that, like the physical processes  that have shaped arrakis, ‘[o]ur timetable will achieve the stature of  a natural pheno menon [...] a planet’s life is a vast, tightly inter woven  fabric’ (Herbert, 1965, 263). The new community that Pardot seeks to  develop is subordinated to the directive of the messianic hero Paul and, in  Children of Dune, to his grandson Leto ii. This is accompanied by a shift in  the timescale envisioned for terraforming and emancipation, which falls  from geologic to generational spans. anticipating the acceleration that  Paul’s escape into the deep desert in Dune promises for the ecopolitical  project, Pardot warns Liet that ‘[n]o more terrible disaster could befall  your people than for them to fall into the hands of a Hero’ (Herbert,  1965, 263). This, as Herbert remarks in ‘Dune genesis,’ is the originary  concept for the trilogy: ‘the messianic convulsions that periodically  overtake us’ (2007). The fremen ‘masses’ are subordinated to the agenda  of an individual aristocrat. The terraforming project, originally conceived  as the slow growth of a culture co-adapting with its environment, is  commandeered for the purposes of an individual’s drive for revenge and  power. The theme of heroic individualism can be traced back to ‘Born of  the Sun’ (1934) and, as Susan Stratton contends, is one of the enduring  sf tropes that pose problems for ecocriticism (2001). ecology is central to the terraforming motif in Dune and provides  a conceptual bridge between concern for the natural world and  an examination of the groups who inhabit the planet. Plans for  terraforming arrakis are overseen by Liet, whose father Pardot, as  arrakis’s planetologist before him, supplied the ecological vision for the  long-term terraformation of the planet. Liet continues to hallucinate his  father’s early teaching on ecological principles when abandoned by the  Harkonnens in the deep desert: ‘[w]e are generalists [...] You can’t draw  neat lines around planet-wide problems. Planetology is a cut-and-fit  </page> <page sequence="23"> 120 Terraforming science’ (Herbert, 1965, 260). The title ‘planetologist’ signals a shift  away from the specificities of local ecosystems to a focus on the global.  Pardot first identified the potential for ecological management offered  by the nomadic fremen, noting that ‘[t]o the working planetologist, his  most important tool is human beings [...]. You must cultivate ecological  literacy among the people. That’s why i’ve created this entirely new  form of ecological notation’ (260). The importance placed on ecological  literacy in the context of the directed modification of a planet links  ecological education to projects for human emancipation. This vision of  an endeavour that includes both natural and cultural worlds, and the  possible transformations that can be effected by a global community,  is expanded when Liet recalls his father’s visionary ambition: ‘[w]e  must do a thing on arrakis never before attempted for an entire  planet [...] We must use man as a con structive ecological force –  inserting adapted terraform life: a plant here, an animal there, a man  in that place – to transform the water cycle, to build a new kind of  landscape’ (261). This passage links a nomadic, globalised movement  over the land to a conscious, directed transformation of social and  cultural practices and recalls Wiener’s reframing of human populations  in cybernetic terms in The Human Use of Human Beings. Pardot’s call  for a new landscape oscillates between natural and cultural referents  and leaves the realisation of this landscape ambiguous, demonstrating  how such global transformations are dependent on the interrelation of  nature and culture. This focus on planetary ecology strongly anticipates Lovelock’s  interest in gaia as a metaphor for considering earth as a planetary  system. When reflecting on how the sandworms’ evolution and life cycle  shape the planet, Pardot notes that ‘the near-ideal nitrogen-oxygen-Co2  balance [is] being maintained here in the absence of large areas of plant  cover’ and claims that ‘[t]he arrakeen environment built itself into the  evolutionary pattern of native life forms,’ both these statements echoing  elements of gaian processes and effects (Herbert, 1965, 261). Pardot’s  claims also place humankind in relation to a global environment where  nature is managed for instrumental ends. for Pardot, the fremen  embody ‘an ecological and geological force of almost unlimited potential’  (467). Vegetative life can establish homeostatic regulation of the planet  once a critical biomass is reached. The fremen capitalise on this process  to transform arrakis by establishing a new set of parameters that they  initially modulate until a new regime stabilises. These principles are  applied to socio-political relationships. Liet, who constantly thinks of  the fremen using the possessive ‘my,’ Pardot, who cares nothing for  the individual fremen over the group and who is content to ‘[l]et  </page> <page sequence="24"> eCoLogY anD enVironmenTaL aWareneSS 121 them think anything they wish as long as they believe in us,’ and  Jessica, who speculates that the fremen ‘could be wielded like a sword  to win back Paul’s place for him,’ all view the fremen instrumentally  (263, 304). Social engineering is given the status of an ecological  principle: ‘[m]ovement across the landscape is a necessity for animal  life,’ Pardot explains. ‘nomad peoples follow the same neces sity. Lines  of movement adjust to physical needs for water, food, minerals. We  must control this movement now, align it for our purposes’ (261). The  migratory lifestyle that informs the fremen’s culture is, in ecological  terms, a flow of energy that can be harnessed to direct intervention  into the environment. This migratory lifestyle is at odds with Kynes’s realisation that  terraforming requires another kind of civilisation: ‘[a] thought spread  across his mind – clear, distinct: The real warmth of a planet is in its  landscape, how we take part in that basic source of civilization – agriculture’  (Herbert, 1965, 259). agriculture is linked to terraforming and  necessitates the development of a rooted culture. opposing this vision  of an agricultural landscape is that of the migratory sandworms, who,  like the fremen, embody a vast force aligned with movement: Pardot  explains that ‘[i]t was lines of movement that gave us the first clue  to the relationship between worms and spice’ (261). Two cultural  forms of habitation symbolised by agriculture and the sandworms are  thus opposed, and a synthesis negotiated. When Paul is adopted into  a fremen tribe he realises that he ‘was surrounded by a way of life  that could only be understood by postulating an ecology of ideas and  values’ (329–30). These cultural systems are metaphorical ecologies  that enframe the physical and cultural parameters of a planet and its  population. arrakis’s global environment, the chronotope of the barren desert  wilderness, offers advantages for ecopolitical reflection and the growth  of an eco-cosmopolitanism that continues to be explored in other  works of terraforming. arrakis’s harsh environment fosters a heightened  awareness of the impact of the environment on the body and, at a larger  scale, the constraints to the development of indigenous communities  and civilisations. The scarcity of resources on this planet brings the  economic basis of humankind’s relationship to the environment into  focus: ‘“[t]he historical system of mutual pillage and extortion stops  here on arrakis,” his father said. “You cannot go on for ever stealing  what you need without regard to those who come after. The physical  qualities of a planet are written into its economic and political record.  We have the record in front of us and our course is obvious.”’ (Herbert,  1965, 262). The wasteland chronotope is ideally suited to highlighting  </page> <page sequence="25"> 122 Terraforming the implications of an economic system that operates by exploiting  others for access to an ever-dwindling supply of resources. a sense  of time geared towards responsibility to future generations is joined  to this outlook, a new awareness that can be considered a form of  eco-cosmopolitanism that struggles with the repercussions of the  human impact on the landscape and the changes to how the landscape  signifies for the fremen. arrakis’s environment does not determine so  much as provide the initial foundations for the economic and political  systems that Paul establishes. The character of this ecological vision is  undermined by the dominance of the main heroic narrative and its  strong instrumental approach to nature, but it does remain a critical  undercurrent in the sequence. The Garden in Dune Jessica discovers a private garden in the arrakeen feudal house that  gratuitously consumes enough water to support many people. This  garden more than the lack of waterseals on doors and windows is ‘a  deliberate statement of power and wealth,’ signified by the callous and  calculated waste of water on a world that lacks this resource (Herbert,  1965, 72): ‘[w]ater everywhere in this room – on a planet where water  was the most precious juice of life. Water being wasted so conspicuously  that it shocked her [Jessica] to inner stillness’ (Herbert, 1965, 72). The  garden is no refuge but a symbolic affirmation of aristocratic power  and wealth by the Harkonnens and, by extension, the empire and its  overarching control over arrakis’s future. This space has, however, been  appropriated for other purposes. a note left by the emperor’s proxy, a  fellow aristocrat and Bene gesserit, allows Jessica to locate a hidden  message warning of an assassination attempt on Paul, who appears  with a ‘hunter-seeker’ before she can act on the warning and, at her  direction, destroys the mechanical assassin by plunging it into a pool.  The ensuing dialogue between the two constructs another layer of  significance that refigures this garden space as a refuge from further  threat. This is emphasised by the airlock sealing the garden from  arrakis’s arid atmosphere. its special climate provides a contrast to the  desert landscape it excludes and shows how the trope of the airlock  acts as both a threshold and a discontinuity between these spaces. The  garden is represented as another world through a series of technologies  that allow the climate to be modified, including the aforementioned  airlocks, the filter glass that simulates a yellow sun and the ‘clock-set  servok,’ a sprinkler that connects images of technology, water and the  garden. Whereas danger is aligned with technology through the hunter- seeker’s function as a counterforce and this technology is symbolically  </page> <page sequence="26"> eCoLogY anD enVironmenTaL aWareneSS 123 contrasted with the natural through its destruction by water, the garden  is completely dependent upon technology for its existence (Herbert,  1965, 71–74). This garden landscape is a politically contested space. in contrast  to the initial power statement it originally signified under Harkonnen  feudalism, the atreides co-opt it to underscore their ideological difference  and to legitimate their own rule: ‘“my Lord, the Duke, and i have other  plans for our con servatory,” Jessica said. She smiled at Leto. “We intend  to keep it, certainly, but only to hold it in trust for the people of arrakis.  it is our dream that some day the climate of arrakis may be changed  sufficiently to grow such plants anywhere in the open.”’ (Herbert, 1965,  127). Kynes interprets this promise against the fremen legend of ‘“the  shortening of the way,”’ the appearance of a mythical hero known as  the Kwisatz Haderach, who would accelerate the terraforming of arrakis.  Jessica is prompted to wonder, ‘Did our Missionaria Protectiva plant that  legend here, too? ’ (Herbert, 1965, 128). The garden becomes an ambivalent  symbol for freedom from oppressive feudalism. if the garden came to be  mirrored by the wider landscape, then the scarcity and control of water  on arrakis could no longer bolster the economic power exercised over  the fremen. However, in a text so dominated by the ceaseless plotting  between feudal houses, the co-opting of the pastoral ideal operates as a  counterforce that introduces civilisation – aligned with the empire – into  the ideal. The cynicism with which Jessica exploits fremen legend and  the politically charged statement that echoes arthur C. Clarke’s The Sands  of Mars (1951), ‘hold it in trust for the people,’ dialogises the different  discourses of the text. Dune draws further correspondences to real-world  historical events via the spice industry’s metaphorical connection to oil,  clean air, water and other resource shortages that occur as a result of  aggressively exploitative commerce. The garden remains alien to arrakis. When it is revealed that free  water on the planet’s surface threatens the sandworms’ extinction, the  pastoral ideal that the dream of a terraformed planet offers to the fremen  is gradually undermined. in Children of Dune, the atreides retainer  gurney Halleck views the new landscape that Paul’s vision brought to  the desert and is able to assess it from the vantage offered by his status  as an outsider: ‘[m]omentarily, he saw the garden through fremen  eyes: alien, menacing, dangerous in its waste of water [...] Both of us are  alien here’ (Herbert, 1976, 334–35). The speed of the planet’s physical  transformation creates a disjunct between Halleck and his environment,  an estrangement that is shared by the garden; like the offworlder who  views this landscape, the garden superimposed onto arrakis is alien to  its environment. This sense of alienation can be usefully compared to  </page> <page sequence="27"> 124 Terraforming notions of deterritorialisation that Heise discusses in Sense of Place and  Sense of Planet (2008). Deterritorialisation involves the emergence of new  cultural forms and practices that are no longer rooted in place. in the  Dune trilogy this deterritorialisation hinges on the cultural importance  that the fremen place on the conservation of water. The danger that  Halleck responds to centres on the erosion of the discipline and social  cohesion that had served as a touchstone for a cultural identity tied to  the specificities of the environment, helping to bind the fremen into a  tight-knit global society. The transformation of the environment and fremen culture presented  in Children of Dune is anticipated in Dune Messiah. Paul reflects on the  changes that he initiates as the new emperor: They hated him. He’d slain the past. and there were others, even  those who’d fought for the sols to buy precious water, who hated  him for changing the old ways. as the ecological pattern dictated  by muad’dib remade the planet’s landscape, human resistance  increased. Was it not presumptuous, he wondered, to think he  could make over an entire planet – everything growing where and  how he told it to grow? even if he succeeded, what of the universe  waiting out there? Did it fear similar treatment? (Herbert, 1971, 34) The ‘shortening of the way,’ the rapid change to the environment and the  social conditions that are constrained by the landscape, is the source of  a profound deterritorialisation that is evident to Paul even as he makes  these changes. awareness of the social tensions that he precipitates leads  him to abdicate as Dune Messiah concludes and retreat into the desert to  adopt the role of prophet in Children of Dune. in this capacity he stands  as a pastoral counterforce opposing the changes that he had himself  initiated by establishing arrakeen as the centre of a new civilisation.  The heroic individualism and machiavellian political self-interest that  dominated Dune are here profoundly critiqued for their hubris and their  extension outward to the universe. Paul notes that arrakis itself ‘fought  him, resisted, slipped away from his commands,’ illustrating how the  nature of the planet resists the imposition of an individual’s landscaping  vision (Herbert, 1971, 56). The Dune trilogy presents this hubris as  inescapable, eventually leading to Leto ii’s transcendent synthesis with  the sandworms and complete control over the destiny of the fremen  and the planet. The Dune trilogy borrows from ecology and the pastoral  to sketch a movement from terraforming seen as a positive physical  and socio-cultural transformative force to terraforming as a problematic  symbol of ecopolitical dictatorship and deterritorialisation. </page> <page sequence="28"> eCoLogY anD enVironmenTaL aWareneSS 125 Robert Heinlein’s The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress in Heinlein’s The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, Luna (the moon) has been  colonised by convicts deported from earth generations ago, who labour  to satisfy the increasing demand for resources on their home planet. This  economic arrangement is overseen by the authority, which represents  earth’s interests on Luna and maintains a flow of cheap grain to the  imperial centre. The narrative depicts a conspiracy by a group of ‘rational  anarchists’ to unite the people of Luna, overthrow the authority and  declare independence from earth. This text extends the political enquiry  of Farmer in the Sky by examining how libertarianism offers an alternative  to the imperial and fascist politics seen in the dystopias of the 1950s  terraforming boom. The revolutionary Professor Bernardo de la Paz  exhorts earth’s politicians to ‘[s]end us your poor, your dispossessed,  send them by thousands and hundreds of thousands; we’ll teach them  swift, efficient Lunar methods of tunnel farming and ship you back  unbelievable tonnage. gentlemen, Luna is one enormous fallow farm,  four thousand million hectares, waiting to be plowed!’ (Heinlein, 2001,  240–41). The political context, with its reference to the american War  of independence and the colonisation of Van Dieman’s island, invokes  ideals of self-sufficiency and ecologically informed economics. The poor  and dispossessed are relied on to abandon their lives on earth to become  colonial farmers; poised upon this injunction is an ambivalence between  utopian hope for a better life on Luna and the potential exploitation  of the workforce. geoengineering themes are explored in the context of an overpop- ulated and politically strained earth trapped in a negative feedback cycle.  The increasing demand for resources on earth informs the authority’s  use of criminals as slave labour on Luna, establishing a terragouging  model of terraforming as the primary human relationship to earth and  the moon’s environment. at the narrative’s conclusion, the assumption  of a terragouging model for approaching other planets is not significantly  challenged. as Luna settles into independence, mannie considers the  terraforming of the asteroids in terms that draw on space as a field of  continued conquest, adventure and excitement (Heinlein, 2001, 303). The  struggle for personal fulfilment outweighs the interest that development  of Lunarian society holds for the text, which eventually turns outward  towards space rather than inward to explore equitable social relationships  on both earth and Luna. The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress bears many similarities to the consensus  futures of the 1950s terraforming narratives. in order to combat  earth’s exploitation of the Lunarian society for the production of cheap  </page> <page sequence="29"> 126 Terraforming resources, de la Paz argues for self-sufficiency as a step towards a  capitalist-libertarian ethic of the free market: every load you ship to Terra condemns your grandchildren to  slow death. The miracle of photosynthesis, the plant-and-animal  cycle, is a closed cycle. You have opened it – and your lifeblood  runs downhill to Terra. You don’t need higher prices, one cannot  eat money! What you need, what we all need, is an end to this  loss. embargo, utter and absolute. Luna must be self-sufficient!  (Heinlein, 2001, 17) De la Paz reprises miller’s symbol in ‘Crucifixus etiam’ of the wine-soaked  martian sand, an emblem for the lives of the labourers that have been  sapped by an alien environment. This image trades on the connection  between ecological energy flows and blood, describing a feedback loop  between the colonists and the land. De la Paz’s call for a free market  is grounded in sensitivity to Luna’s limits: the scarcity of nutrients and  water for cultivation makes its ecology exceedingly fragile. When this  scarcity is coupled with the malthusian population explosion that leaves  many countries on earth (india is the main example) unable to provide  living space and food for their populace, the urgency of establishing a  free market is intensified. mannie’s friend and co-conspirator, the ai  known as mike, uses a series of statistical scenarios to project a decline  on Luna in seven years. De la Paz announces to the Lunar authority on  earth that ‘[d]iscussions of how to augment our shipments must be based  on the facts of nature, not on the false assumption that we are slaves,  bound by a work quota we never made’ (Heinlein, 2001, 83–84). The  urgency of this scenario of ecological decline leads to the necessity of  establishing economic, and hence political, self-determination on Luna. This call for a scientific outlook that can appreciate and inform  decisions based on the facts of energy economics is rooted in de la Paz’s  libertarian political philosophy, ‘rational anarchism.’ The political ends  that discourses of nature are deployed to justify, earth’s instrumental  relationship to Luna, are contested by a philosophy that privileges a  certain value of rationalism. Jason Bourget has argued that Heinlein’s  reformulation of nineteenth-century libertarian political philosophy is  undercut by a biological determinism that privileges masculinity, thus  preventing the realisation of a libertarian utopia in the text (Bourget,  2008, 10–11). This is coupled to an insistence that politics suitable to the  level of individual interaction can be scaled up to best equip a global  society for survival. rational anarchism locates social responsibility with  a specific individual: </page> <page sequence="30"> eCoLogY anD enVironmenTaL aWareneSS 127 a rational anarchist believes that concepts such as ‘state’ and ‘society’  and ‘government’ have no existence save as physically exemplified  in the acts of self-responsible individuals. He believes that it is  impossible to shift blame, share blame, distribute blame ... as blame,  guilt, responsibility are matters taking place inside human beings  singly and nowhere else. But being rational, he knows that not all  individuals hold his evaluations, so he tries to live perfectly in an  imperfect world ... aware that his effort will be less than perfect yet  undismayed by self-knowledge of self-failure. (Heinlein, 2001, 51) By coupling this political philosophy to notions of biological determinism,  Bourget argues, ‘Heinlein’s populist revolution is rapidly transformed into  an elitist dictatorship, dominated by a few charismatic men who assume  complete political and economic control as soon as the Lunar authority  no longer exists’ (Bourget, 2008, 18). De la Paz is one such charismatic  figure, whom ‘Heinlein unwittingly transforms [...] from a representative  of libertarian thought into a tyrant with a fit belief in the importance  of his own masculine individuality’ (19). The masculinist fascism that  de la Paz represents recapitulates the machiavellianism of Paul and  Leto ii in the Dune series, thus sustaining a tradition of instrumental  relationships towards planetary environments and their inhabitants. in  The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, the deployment of grain shipments and rocks  as projectiles to threaten earth is one manifestation of this individualism  and instrumentalism. rational anarchism represents a backlash against the idea of global  governmental systems or, in anderson’s case, an interplanetary Un. it  rejects bureaucratic systems and denies a global sense of identity rooted  in responsibility to the group. However, as Bourget has shown, this  individualism is restricted to those who see it as their duty to ensure  their position as leaders directing the course of history. The Moon Is  a Harsh Mistress closes spaces for a libertarianism that allows multiple  voices to interact, which would open a dialogue about the meaning and  function of a plural community: mannie discovers that mike has rigged  the results of the election for the Lunarian council, giving mannie a seat  for which he had not been democratically elected. De la Paz calls this  anarchism ‘freedom,’ a notion that Le guin revises as a freedom to do  anything, not a freedom from anything (Le guin, 1999, 108). Heinlein’s  treatment of the terraformed moon as an alternative, anarchist political  system clashes with the implications of his biological determinism, but it  does represent a departure from earlier ideas of global or interplanetary  governments, and it responds to the same countercultural opposition  that influenced the new Wave of sf. </page> <page sequence="31"> 128 Terraforming Ursula K. Le Guin’s The Dispossessed Le guin’s The Dispossessed represents an alternative to the masculine  politics of Herbert and Heinlein. Published almost a decade after Dune and  The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, The Dispossessed is informed by the successes  and failures of the 1960s counterculture. Le guin’s interest in ecology,  feminism and colonialism marks her as an early ecofeminist, while her  work greatly influenced sf discourse and provided another voice that  later writers would inherit. fredric Jameson sees ‘world reduction’ as an  essential strategy of Le guin’s work, which he explains is ‘based on a  principle of systematic exclusion, a kind of surgical excision of empirical  reality, something like a process of ontological attenuation in which  the sheer teeming multiplicity of what exists, of what we call reality,  is deliberately thinned and weeded out through an operation of radical  abstraction and simplification’ (2005, 271). Darko Suvin summarises  Jameson’s reading of scarcity in The Dispossessed as ‘a reaction to the  polluted american abundance and a realistic diagnosis of a better  model of life,’ and extends this claim to argue that world reduction is  ‘a retrenchment from the “living flesh” of a natural community, a harsh  but clean acceptance of asceticism’ (1975, 273). Ursula K. Heise, however,  argues that Jameson reduces ‘Le guin’s carefully conceived planetary  ecosystems [to] a purely metaphorical function,’ thus overlooking the  way the ecological constraints of anarres ‘[shape] social and political  horizons in particular – both positive and negative – ways’ (2012, 101,  103). gib Prettyman likewise observes that Jameson and Suvin ignore Le  guin’s use of ecology and Daoism, ‘both frameworks [which] emphasize  systemic processes and aim to critique egoistic illusions’ (2014, 58). The Dispossessed makes much of the implications of its subtitle and  status as an ‘ambiguous’ or ‘critical utopia,’ in Tom moylan’s theori- sation (1986). The terraforming tradition taken as a whole operates  analogously to the critical utopia through techniques such as the  dialogising relationship established between The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress  and The Dispossessed. alternating chapters set primarily on the planet  Urras and anarres allow readers to compare their political systems as  seen from the protagonist’s perspective. While Shevek, the protagonist  of The Dispossessed, contrasts Urras against the touchstone of his home  planet, anarres, the narrative’s structure dialogises this with scenes  from Shevek’s past, thus disclosing flaws in the odonian political  system. This narrative strategy contributes to the ambiguity of the text’s  utopianism. Pastoral themes differ from world reduction as, rather than  excising elements of empirical reality, the dialogism and compression  of meaning involved in the pastoral emblem encode a wider range of  </page> <page sequence="32"> eCoLogY anD enVironmenTaL aWareneSS 129 experience and generate an allusive network that opens the text to  complexity. Pastoral emblems, while a simplification of this complexity,  operate by compression rather than exclusion. Working in concert with  these textual strategies is the mobilisation of ecological themes that  limit the development of anarresti society and which, as Heise argues,  ‘[hold] up environmentalist discourses of scarcity as they had emerged  in the 1960s and early 1970s to the reader’s scrutiny as conceptual tools  whose usefulness in shaping contemporary societies’ relation to their  environments needs to be constantly re-examined’ (2012, 103). anarres is an anarchist commune, a social experiment in anarchist  political philosophy. odonian government is designed to escape the  shortcomings that have resulted in an uneven set of social relationships  on Urras. in contrast, the environmental concerns of a-io are genuine  but socially stratified, primarily working to maintain the economically  privileged in a state of luxury. Decentralisation is combined with the  odonians’ repudiation of tribalism in the name of a broader conception of  community. Tribalism, however, is extended to the odonians as a whole:  many reject Shevek’s campaign for contact with Urras, preferring instead  to operate as a closed, self-sustaining commune. Bramwell argues that  ‘religious minority groups, such as the amish and the Doukhoubours  [sic], survived because they were transplanted as homogenous groups  from their country of origin, and owed their survival to tribal as well  as religious bonds, rather than novel experiments’ (1990, 93). Such  homogenous transplanting is also characteristic of the foundation of  odonian society, yet separation is already compromised by the fact  that anarres is an Urrasti mining colony (Le guin, 2000, 79). While  anarresti tribalism draws identity and collective strength from a political  text written by the spiritual founder odo, Shevek and his supporters  see this collectivism as having rigidified into a restraint. one crucial ecopolitical element is the pastoral inversion between  Urras and anarres. The pastoral world and its pairing with capitalist  economics and a network of international relations on Urras abstract  contemporaneous real-world perspectives on global politics. This is  complicated when Shevek discovers that he has been insulated from  the oppression of the urban experience of the non-elites in a-io.  recalling ernest J. Yanarella’s discussion of the garden of the Chattel  form of pastoral, this concealment parallels the pastoral ideal’s use as a  rhetorical strategy that cloaks or elides the necessities of everyday life  and the dynamics of oppression (2001, 81–82). Shevek’s experience of the  landscape and animals of Urras broadens this pastoral theme by including  vectors for the recognition of nature’s otherness. Shevek’s first sight of  a horse and a flock of birds are haunting images; his experience with  </page> <page sequence="33"> 130 Terraforming animals in a-io enacts a confrontation with the alien but establishes  this event as a reconnection. These visions delineate a perspective that  allows Shevek to reassess his view of Urras and entertain the possibility  of a human community spanning the two societies. after Shevek accepts a posting where he works to plant vegetation  engineered for environments on anarres, he becomes acquainted with a  pastoral song sung by the labourers. His reaction to some of its oblique  references underscores the otherness of the pastoral landscape to the  odonians. nevertheless, for many of the labourers the song retains an  inspirational element that underwrites their efforts to terraform their  moon. The name of the first site on anarres, ans Hos, can be translated  from the odonian language Pravic into the ioti of a-io as ‘garden of  mind’, and the site is known as the eden of anarres. The chronotopicity  of this space, as a colonial settlement set in an unspecified future, is  counterpoised with the pastoral nostalgia that it evokes. The physical  constraints that anarres poses divert attention away from the instan- tiation of the pastoral landscape and towards the psychical processes of  landscaping and imagining the future. odonian society avoids the use of unnecessary technology but is  not primitivist: they actively reject this pastoral orientation towards  an idealised past in favour of a ‘complex organicism’ (Le guin, 2000,  81). The combination of decentralisation and a low-tech infrastructure,  the latter of which recalls the feudal setting in Dune, reflects a distrust  of large, bureaucratic governments where decision making devolves  to an imperial centre. nevertheless, there are centres on anarres: the  centralised computer system Divlab manages the planet’s work postings,  while the capital abbenay is a place where power inheres. This ironically  undercuts Shevek’s first impression that, in abbenay, nothing is hidden.  anarres and Urras are unveiled during the course of the narrative while  the odonians’ anarchism is critically examined, its flaws identified, and  a restoration of its basic principles attempted. Such contradictions exemplify how The Dispossessed works as an  ambiguous utopia that undermines the ideal. nevertheless, the differences  between the two governmental and philosophical systems are real.  odonian social philosophy, based on Kropotkin’s concept of ‘mutual aid’  and a distrust of rigid social practice, is a significant indicator of a shift  in political philosophy in sf that influenced the ecopolitical dimension  of terraforming narratives such as Kim Stanley robinson’s Mars trilogy.  anarchism, as Shevek argues, is part of their ‘nature’ as odonians. in  contrast, Chifoilisk, a scholar on Urras, offers another assessment of  human nature that is clearly representative of those of his society. in one  episode set in Shevek’s youth, he and his friends look up at the distant  </page> <page sequence="34"> eCoLogY anD enVironmenTaL aWareneSS 131 Urras and see a beautiful cosmic body. Tirin suggests that it might be  desirable to see what is happening on Urras, arguing that at the very  least it would be worth going to see a horse. Despite Shevek’s scepticism  at what he believes to be a childish notion, it speaks of a desire to reach  beyond an immediate community to expand ideas of a lived sense of  place from global to interplanetary scales. Tirin expresses a desire to  reconnect with the other so as to re-evaluate the immediate community  from an external perspective and to open spaces for overtures towards  a positive recreation of odonian society. This re-evaluation of anarchism turns on what Shevek calls the  ‘nature of existence’ and on notions of brotherhood (Le guin, 2000,  52). against the popular odonian belief that brotherhood begins with  love, Shevek contests the idea that suffering is simply a social disease,  arguing that brotherhood begins in shared suffering – the very thing  another odonian argues that mutual aid is designed to prevent. While  society can work to eliminate unnecessary suffering, Shevek argues  that it is part of the nature of existence. although his argument is  questionable on the ground that there are other ineliminable traits  that remain part of the nature of existence (one might argue that less  commendable human qualities could also have equal claim to centrality,  as does Chifoilisk), the connection between suffering and brotherhood  makes this trait significant for its social and ecopolitical implications. in light of this exchange, Shevek’s call of brotherhood to a pet  otter is a call for solidarity that draws connections between ideas of  shared suffering between distinct species. The common factor linking  their experience is not their embodiment, but the suffering caused  by shared environmental conditions. Their historical relationship as  creatures that had formerly occupied the same world as the odonians  gestures towards the possibility of re-territorialisation through an animal  other. Shevek’s experience with animals is combined with a thread  of moral extensionism that balances his sense of nature’s otherness  with a solidarity based on recognising his affinity with other animals.  This element of moral extensionism soon overrides nature’s otherness  and is linked to the anarchist ideals explored in human political  contexts. Shevek grounds human relationships to other animals and  their environments in the same political philosophy as his view of  intra-human relationships. Shevek shames one scholar, Pae, by showing contempt for the  comparison he draws between the laws of physics and the uneven  political arrangements on Urras. mathematics undergirds the laws of  physics, while thematic similarities between ecology and physics highlight  the coherence between their emphasis on ideas of unification and  </page> <page sequence="35"> 132 Terraforming connection in their account of different aspects of nature. mathematics,  or ‘number,’ is a bridge between psyche and matter. number is the basis  of other modes, and ainsetain (Shevek believes) thought of physics  and mathematics as an accurate description of reality. if Shevek’s  understanding of number is correct, this basis in reality is the ground  where all political and ethical systems are rooted. Shevek’s mission to  discover a unified field theory grows from the same root as his desire  to establish a connection between anarres and Urras. Connections  underlie Shevek’s continued interest in social reform as one example  of his attempt to unify separate domains. He makes this clear when  claiming that reconciling Simultaneity and Sequency would amount to  a complexity that embraced both geometry and ethics. reconciling Simultaneity and Sequency recapitulates the Daoist  framework that is central to Le guin’s oeuvre, apparent in the recurrent  theme of balance between opposites. Prettyman notes that while world  reduction in The Dispossessed does attempt, as Jameson suggests, to  imagine capitalism away, ‘it is important to notice that [Le guin] saw  her yin utopianism as a strategic counterweight rather than a mystical  celebration of inevitable balance’ (2014, 63). in this light, the difference  in emphasis on love and violence in ‘Vaster Than empires and more  Slow’ and The Word for World Is Forest can be read as an attempt to use  the Hainish universe to explore multiple aspects of balance in society.  instead of ‘prevailing egoistic orientation[s] toward endless growth,’ Le  guin ‘wants to emphasize a radical knowledge of place, of here and now’  (Prettyman, 2014, 65). Shevek’s dynamic interrelation of Simultaneity  and Sequency gives prominence to the present and its connection to  the past and future, and is complemented by the ecological themes  that foreground issues of species flourishing and space. Shevek’s partner  Takver is a biologist who specialises in fish genetics. Shevek sees Takver’s  ‘concern with landscapes and living creatures’ as something ‘much  broader than love,’ and speaks of her as being unweaned from the  universe (Le guin, 2000, 154). as a counterbalance to an egoism that  privileges individuality, Takver’s relationship to the timespace of the now  involves a reciprocal expansion of identity that retains distinctions while  recognising continuity: ‘[i]t was strange to see Takver take a leaf into  her hand, or even a rock. She became an extension of it: it of her’ (154). Shevek turns to the Terrans and Hainish for asylum after the  brutal suppression of the ioti rebellion. The Terran ambassador Keng  tells Shevek of her homeworld (earth), which was devastated by the  inhabitants’ inability to adapt to the environmental conditions created  by their multiplying population and practices. To Keng, Urras, despite its  faults, is a world tremendously alive. This contrast appears to mitigate,  </page> <page sequence="36"> eCoLogY anD enVironmenTaL aWareneSS 133 in Keng’s eyes at least, the suppression of the rebellion. Shevek, on the  other hand, connects this viewpoint to his own understanding of time  and to his work as a physicist. Speaking from a position informed by  the insights of Simultaneity, Shevek argues that you cannot have the  present unless you accept both the past and the existence of the future.  This dynamic is, as moylan argues, typical of The Dispossessed, which he  argues expresses an attitude of détente, ‘the cooperation of previously  contending forces to transcend hostility, suffering, and injustice and work  jointly toward a better world for all’ (1986, 93). from the perspective  of Sequency, Shevek assesses Keng’s nihilism as an inability to accept  change, to accept that evolution does influence both human nature and  culture. This extension of physics into the domain of evolution and ethics  points towards a utopian future that is ambiguous because it cannot exist  in static form. instead, much like Shevek’s view of odonian society as  rebellious, the process of evolution is paralleled with that of revolution,  both of which are ongoing and permanent. This process of revolution is first and foremost an individual act, a  condition that is reflected by the narrative’s focalisation through Shevek,  one dimension of anarchism that sits uncomfortably with ideas of  community and survival that terraforming traditionally emphasises. as  Shevek argues – faintly echoing Poul anderson’s anti-collectivism – ‘any  rule is tyranny,’ including the rule of the group, and if an individual  cannot work in solidarity with their community then their duty is to  work alone (Le guin, 2000, 295). The problem of the individual and the  group rises to the fore as the main conflict within anarresti society and  remains troublesome for conceptions of anarchism. The theme of heroic  individualism, often associated with imperial and patriarchal conceptions  of right government, is refigured in less heroic terms and presented as a  necessary step towards social change and responsibility. Shevek’s brand of  individualism differs from conceptions of heroic individualism in that it is  balanced by a strong conception of brotherhood as a binding social force. Shevek reflects on fulfilment as a function of time and uses two  conceptual chronotopes, the motif of the locked room and the landscape  of time outside this metaphorical locked room. The room is a symbol for  individual stasis and intellectual imprisonment and appears throughout  the text in various forms, most notably as the motif of the wall that  opens the narrative. The idea that an act becomes human only when it  occurs in the landscape of time, in both the past and the future, embeds  the individual into their immediate environment and emphasises the  dynamism that undergirds physics and ecology as the basis for ethics  and culture. Loyalty ties the past and the future together, establishing  continuity between temporal landscapes – between interpretations of the  </page> <page sequence="37"> 134 Terraforming past and visions of the future. Terraforming is both physical and social,  involving a superimposition of physical and intellectual landscapes.  Conceptions of time are intellectual landscapes, while loyalty is a political  relationship that fuses the physical aspects of terraforming to a politics  oriented to the future. reflection on the landscape of the past and an  acceptance of change, both physical (the terraformation of planets)  and social (the reformation of socio-political landscapes), are brought  together in the terraforming text. Such narratives provide spaces where  the physical and political are drawn together; the terraforming motif  operates as an emblem for the inter-animation of these two domains. Ernest Callenbach’s Ecotopia ernest Callenbach’s Ecotopia (1975) is a classic of ecological literature.  andrew g. Kirk writes that ‘Ecotopia melded the counter-culture lifestyle  and social values with a strange brew of libertarian thinking, collec- tivism, states rights, and technologically enthusiastic environmentalism  in the same counterculture sci-fi tradition as robert Heinlein’s The  Moon Is a Harsh Mistress’ (2007, 157). Ecotopia operates more like a  catalogue of already existing technologies and an exploration of how  they could be utilised within a particular social framework, and in this  sense it resembles Stewart Brand’s Whole Earth Catalog. indeed, in 1972  Callenbach presented the ideas that would feed into Ecotopia to the  Point foundation committee, which was founded by Brand and funded  by proceeds from the Whole Earth Catalog and the CoEvolution Quarterly.  This presentation was itself a work of performance sf, as Callenbach  assumed the role of an ‘ecotopian militant’ from 1995 to explore ideas  of a decentralised economy (136). Ecotopia links the countercultural  ecologism of the american West Coast, with its exploration of science  and technology as a way to synthesise nature and culture in terms  recalling the motif of the machine in the garden, to the contributions  sf makes in exploring what such a synthesis might look like. Callenbach locates ecotopia at the american West Coast, thus helping  to establish an ecological and egalitarian tradition of green utopias to  which Le guin and robinson contribute. Ecotopia is part of a discourse  of ecologism that connects utopianism with eco-libertarianism and  westward expansion: in robinson’s The Gold Coast, one character argues  that ‘orange County is the end of history, its purest product. Civilization  kept moving west for thousands of years, in a sunset tropism, until  they came to the edge here on the Pacific and they couldn’t go any  farther. and so they stopped here and did it’: they attempted to create a  utopia (1989, 3). Californian ecological sf is concerned with connecting  </page> <page sequence="38"> eCoLogY anD enVironmenTaL aWareneSS 135 history to the future, opening the ecological utopian symbol of orange  County to ideas that coalesced around the Whole Earth Catalog and its  related publications: ideas of ecological design, appropriate technologies,  a libertarian distrust of centralised bureaucracies and a desire for social  freedom and free markets. The influence of the term ‘ecotopia’ on sf is evidenced by robinson’s  publication of an anthology of short stories titled Future Primitive: The  New Ecotopias (1997). Ecotopia begins with an epigraph that translates  the etymology of the term ‘ecotopia’: the root ‘eco-,’ ‘from the greek  oikos (household or home),’ highlights the etymological connection  between utopia and ecologism (Callenbach, 1978, n.). This signifi- cation is central to terraforming, given its concern with constructing  new homes on other planets. Le guin, too, draws on the relationship  between ecologism, utopia and home, most notably in her experi- mental critical ecotopia Always Coming Home (1985). Werner Christie  mathisen sees the connotations of home as implying ‘an exemption  from difficult choices, and thereby a reduction in individual and  social autonomy,’ although Le guin and robinson have consistently  challenged such abdication of personal choice in their narratives (2001,  69). Terraforming, as a literature of landscaping and habitation, makes  ecology central to the realisation of a critical utopian space in the late  1970s, thus factoring the more-than-human world into its exploration  of social reconstruction. These narratives can thus be considered works  that express an eco-cosmopolitan vision. Ecotopia deals with geoengineering themes that are linked to the  governmental and economic restructuring of society. its secessionist  politics represents a formal link to the relationship between earth and  other terraformed planets. Separation from america allows the ecotopian  society to develop according to its own socio-political trajectory, a  dynamic that is magnified in the spatial separation between earth  and terraformed worlds. Some of the main elements of the ecotopian  political vision include an emphasis on decentralisation and stable state  economics, which impact upon multiple levels of ecotopian life, including  production, education, local and regional politics, healthcare and town  planning. a battery of lifestyle changes are presented, all of which index  a shift of values and conceptions of identity. ecotopian lifestyle resembles  the hippie movement of the 1960s, while the neo-pagan practice of  worshipping trees, which draws from the influence of Lovelock’s gaia  hypothesis (Kirk, 2007, 169), illustrates the consolidation of a series of  ‘green’ philosophies into an identifiable discourse. The uneasy balance between a distrust of technology and its use,  while grounded in fears of mechanisation and depersonalisation, counters  </page> <page sequence="39"> 136 Terraforming the notion that the ecotopians are atechnological primitivists. They tend  to view technology as a support structure to facilitate a return to the  wilderness. The narrator, Weston, notes that the ecotopians’ ‘techno- logical austerity’ is belied by their extensive use of telecommunications,  trains and sophisticated and innovative methods of generating power  (Callenbach, 1978, 38, 68). This use of technology makes possible the  arrangement of a collective life in a decentralised government system.  The notion of stable state economics, which underlies theories of the  sustainability movement, is taken as a blueprint that structures policy  making at every level. reaching the goal of a stable state involves  decentralisation processes that, it is believed, will put humanity in a  less destructive and exploitative relationship to nature by assisting in  maintaining nature’s ecological integrity. it is a homeostatic principle  that has a corresponding feedback effect on social worlds. Stable states  are also central to the notion of terraforming, the ideal of which is to  establish a contained self-sustaining system. While mathisen argues  that Ecotopia and The Dispossessed consistently underestimate the role of  politics in green utopias (mathisen, 2001), they represent an important  development of the terraforming narrative where critical reflection and  ambiguity – as exemplified by The Dispossessed and the confluence of  egalitarian politics and ecology – are instantiated. The narratives explored in this chapter track a fundamental transfor- mation of the way relationships to the environment and politics are  envisioned in sf. Two related types of narrative co-exist and mutually  support each other: proto-gaian stories and terraforming narratives that  develop their enquiry around principles influenced by energy economics.  Both types of narrative challenge the assumptions of the works of the  1950s terraforming boom and extend the character of their ecopolitical  enquiry. oppositional politics rises to the fore as the terraforming  motif is used to experiment with alternative lifestyles and forms of  government. Such engagement is both abstract, as in mcKenna’s and Le  guin’s proto-gaian stories, and concrete, as in Heinlein’s and Le guin’s  consideration of governmental systems and lifestyles. it is during this  period that proto-gaian and terraforming narratives begin to converge.  Sf begins to develop a distinctly ‘green’ discourse, a greening of the  terraforming narrative that is exemplified by the Californian ecologism  represented by Le guin and Callenbach, and which would be extended  by other writers throughout the 1980s–1990s. The next chapter turns  to this period to examine the social and political development of the  terraforming narrative during a time in which Lovelock’s gaia hypothesis  becomes incorporated into sf discourse to inform the imagination of  planetary adaptation. </page> </plain_text>
