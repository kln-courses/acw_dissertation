<plain_text><page sequence="1">CECILIA MCCALLUM Department of Social Anthropology London School of Economics The Body That Knows: From Cashinahua Epistemology to a Medical Anthropology of Lowland South America This article develops an anthropology of the body in its material and social environment among the Cashinahua (Huni Kuin) from Brazilian and Peruvian Amazonia. The Cashinahua body, it shows, is thought of as produced by others, not as growing naturally. Growth can be defined as the corporeal accumulation of knowledge in the form of "soul." The article describes the verbal, medical, and other techniques used to trans- form it into "a body that knows." In the Cashinahua understanding, a healthy body is one that constantly learns through the senses and ex- presses the accumulated knowledge in social action and speech. An ill body is one that no longer knows. Curing, therefore, acts to restore a person's capacity to know. The whole article defends the proposition, then, that a prior condition for any medical anthropology in the Cashina- hua case is a thorough examination of Cashinahua epistemology. Finally, through comparative discussion of other peoples in lowland South Amer- ica, it seeks to show that this is also the case more widely in the ethnographic region. Ultimately, it suggests that ethnography in lowland South America undermines the possibility of a "medical anthropology" per se. [anthropology of the body, epistemology, sickness and curing, Amazonia, Cashinahua] his article discusses indigenous understandings of knowledge and bodies. It argues that among the Cashinahua, the Amazonian people to be examined here, the body is construed as an individual entity constituted-in indige- nous terms, "grown"-through knowledge. This knowledge is imparted, in a variety of material, spiritual, and linguistic ways, by people who have acquired it from others, and as such it is socially anchored and weighty with resonances of gender, kinship, and morality. Knowledge and body are seen to coexist so tightly in this understanding that disturbances in the one can have dire consquences for the other. Medical Anthropology Quarterly 10(3):347-372.

These "medical" topics, I argue, are only accessible, in this ethnographic context, when the relationship between knowledge and the body is clear. This has wider implications for the development of a critical anthropology of the body in the region and more generally. This article shows how the Cashinahua treat the body as an entity that is being continuously fabricated out of the environment by the agency of others. Toward this end, it describes how the Cashinahua body comes into being and is "made to grow" by external intervention. Such "making grow" (C. yume wa-) involves curing and treating the body with certain plant "medicines" (C. dau).1 Through an analysis of the concept of dau the article reveals how bodily growth and mental and emotional development are linked in Cashinahua understanding. In particular, it shows how in Cashinahua epistemology knowledge accrues to and becomes engrained in the body and its organs over the course of its life, as it comes into controlled contact with aspects of the environment in their material, verbal, and sometimes spiritual forms. This embodied knowledge is envisaged as being made up of the relationship between a person's spirits (C. yuxin), especially that known as the "body spirit" (yuda yuxin), and physical, mental, and emotional capacities of the person. In effect, the "ethno-epistemology" of the Cashinahua makes a series of connections between exterior matter and certain kinds of speech, their transfor- mation into knowledge in the body, and the exteriorization of that knowledge in the form of value-laden, potentially social action. This series of interconnected processes constitutes the "Cashinahua body." This point merits an aside. Ethnography of the kind analyzed in this article is an exercise in interpretation. Here I make no greater claims than that over the course of nine years (1983-92) and many visits I absorbed something of a Cashinahua worldview-enough to sort through and filter the data that I collected in the course of my research. I make no apologies, then, for sometimes appearing to present "the Cashinahua" as a homogeneous and ahistorical culture: here my own sense of what really goes for all the Cashinahua in one way or another manifests itself. This sense is clearly expressed in "interpretation," but is nevertheless rooted in embodied experience for all that. In no way should it be taken as a disrespect for the diversity of experience or opinion among the Cashinahua people, nor as a negation of the solidly historical nature of their social order.2 That such diversity and historicity exist I take as given-but so too do larger philosophical movements, based in mundane daily practice as well as ritual or "religion." This article is also a contribution to medical anthropology. But it does not take as its starting point the medical anthropological literature on the region. Rather, it forms part of a series of new ethnographic studies by British-based Americanists that focus on personhood and gender in lowland South America (Belauinde 1992; Gow 1989,1991; McCallum 1989,1990; Overing 1988,1993). These studies build upon the earlier literature on the area, but also take a critical stance to certain assumptions such as the universality of distinctions between nature and culture, biological body and social person, or domestic domain and social superstructure. Their concerns thus coincide with the growing number of researchers who, accord- ing to Margaret Lock, 348</page><page sequence="3">THE BODY THAT KNOWS have endeavoured explicitly to situate the body as a product of specific social, cultural, and historical contexts; who have engaged the nature/culture and mind/body debates ... or who have grappled with the poetics and politics of the production and reproduction of bodies. [1993:134] Without explicitly engaging in deconstruction of "Western dichotomies" in the main body of this article, the interpretation of the ethnography is implicitly based on such deconstruction. The article is divided into a number of sections. The first section gives a general overview of how the body is treated in the regional ethnography, while the second provides an introduction to the Cashinahua themselves. Sections three through six discuss the relationship between knowledge and the body in Cashina- hua understanding. The conclusion returns to points made in the following intro- ductory section, suggesting that there is a need for an integration of the two separate approaches to the body contained in "social analysis" on the one hand and "medical analysis" on the other. The "Body" in the Anthropology of Lowland South America In the literature on lowland South America the peculiar importance of the relationship between the body and its material, social, and spiritual environment for the analysis of social organization has often been noted. Generally, the body is not thought to grow naturally or to function in a sense analogical to a "biological model." As in Cashinahua thinking, bodies are thought to be affected and con- structed by a variety of material processes that occur near or within their bodies, as in couvade (Gregor 1977, 1985; Riviere 1974) and in "relations of substance" more widely (Da Matta 1982; Seeger et al. 1987[1979]).3 Striking evidence of the body's dependence on external processes comes from studies of theories and practices of conception, parturition, and the growth of children. For example, in the upper Xingu adolescents are secluded for long periods over several years, during which time they are submitted to a number of processes such as treatment with emetics, blood letting, and scarification. This is part of the process of growing a strong, skillful, and beautiful adult (Basso 1973; Gregor 1977). The clearest and most succinct analysis of this is furnished by Viveiros de Castro, who writes: the human body needs to be submitted periodically to intentional processes of fabrication. The sexual relations between the genitors of a future individual are merely the initial moment of this task. And such fabrication is conceived mainly, but not exclusively, as a systematic combination of interventions over the sub- stances that connect the body to the world: corporeal fluids, foods, emetics, tobacco, oils and vegetable dyes. [1987:31; my translation] Viveiros de Castro goes on to emphasize that body transformations produced by such interventions are at once changes in social identity. The body is made to grow and by this process the social position of the person changes: "In this way, human nature is literally fabricated, modelled, by culture" (1987:32). Erikson (1990) shows how the Matis body is "made grow" by constant interventions upon and within the body-ornamentation, piercing, insertion, treatment with plant medi- cines, beating by "spirits," tatooing-in stages from birth through to mature adulthood. Such treatments are conceived of as being part of normal physiological 349</page><page sequence="4">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY processes, not as opposed to them. They are essential for the constitution of Matis social identity. These data suggest that it would be better to seek some form other than "biological" or "natural" to characterize the body in this region. Yet many anthro- pologists use a concept of "biological body" in order to be able to pursue their main interest, the analysis of social structure and organization and/or the making of the social individual. This is the case, for example, with Turner's (1980) and Howard's (1991) writing on the Ge peoples (in particular the Kayap6) of Central Brazil and the Waiwai of Northern Brazil, respectively. Both authors find that in the under- standing of the peoples studied, the body is treated as an ahistorical, biological, or "natural" entity to which a social persona or "skin" can be added (recalling thus a distinguished tradition in social anthropology since at least Van Gennep).4 Seeger et al., following Mauss's theoretical dictums for the analysis of personhood, and drawing special inspiration from ethnographies of the Ge groups of central Brazil, write on "a certain dualism in human identity" in the lowlands: This dualism, generally associated with the polarity men/women, living/dead, children/adults is, in its most simple version, reduced to a combination of oppo- sitions whose matrix is: individual (blood, village periphery, cotidian world) versus collective or social (soul, name, center, ritual life). [1987(1979):22-23; my translation] The body, in this perspective, incorporates both biological and social elements, the former conceived of as materially within (such as blood), the latter as either mystically or symbolically "on the skin" or added to the body (such as name or soul). The spiritual or symbolic aspects are seen as "social" and imposed upon the mundane and biological aspects.5 Indeed, the tendency to analyze the body primar- ily in terms of its symbolic potential, based upon a conceptual opposition between biological individual and social self, is widespread. In one of the most complete and inspired treatments, Christine Hugh-Jones (1979), writing on the Barasana of the Northwest Amazon, examines the body as one element in the material processes (physiological, sexual, life cycle, productive) that constitute daily community life and underpin ritual. She looks at the Barasanas' theory and practice of universal, "natural" processes. In her analysis they are the infrastructure upon which the Barasana erect an exceedingly complex edifice of symbolic meaning. Hugh-Jones's ultimate concern, like Seeger et al.'s, is to analyze social structure and process, treated as related analogically to but separate from the "natural" processes she examines in minutia. This she does brilliantly in dense symbolic structuralist analysis. An alternative approach to the analysis of social organization treats the body not as the biological "bearer" of social symbolism but rather as the locus of the construction of sociality. Physiological processes such as the consumption of food or sexuality are seen as central social processes (Belaunde 1992; Gow 1989, 1991; McCallum 1989; Overing 1988, 1993). The medical anthropological literature on lowland South America is also a rich source of discussions of the body. There appear to be two major trends: one focuses on the body as a victim of sickness and/or illness; the other focuses on the body as an object of curing, especially through shamanism.6 As in the pioneering study of Yagua shamanism (Chaumeil 1983), both approaches treat the body of the 350</page><page sequence="5">THE BODY THAT KNOWS patient as a relatively unproblematic composition of matter and soul(s), whilst the body of the shaman is examined as rather more interesting. Examples of both approaches appear in a recent volume (Buchillet 1991); thus Gallois (1991) investigates the process of diagnosis and the "therapeutic itinerary" before moving on to discuss etiologies of illness and shamanic curing.7 The papers in the volume tend to treat the patient's body in terms of a physical/spiritual dichotomy, so that herbal and pharmaceutical "medicines" heal physical conditions, while shamanic treatments cure spiritual ones. The body is treated principally either as an object of healing (the patient) or an instrument of it (the healer), with shamanic or phy- totherapeutic practices, nosologies, illness categories and etiologies, and so on, occupying the headlines; there is relatively little discussion of the nature of the body itself. I do not mean to overexaggerate this point. In this article I propose to deal first with the body's construction, and its relation to the environment and to knowledge, before moving on to discussing illness and curing. By this analytical procedure I show that in the Cashinahua context such a "total" vision of the body is a necessary precondition for a possible "medical anthropology." This argument is clearly prefigured in other ethnographies. For example, the Yagua are said not to oppose the somatic to the mental, considering that "illness affects body and spirit simulta- neously .. . affecting the totality of the being" (Chaumeil 1983:265). Thus, how- ever one may conveniently describe illness or curing-shamanic or medical, natural or supernatural, material or spiritual-one cannot escape the fact that these terms take place in bodies that are seen as integrated totalities where matter and spirit are not necessarily opposed. This is true of human bodies and other living entities. Brown makes a related point for the Aguaruna: in their world "thought, matter, and energy interpenetrate; they are not mutually exclusive phenomena" (1986:66). For this reason biomedical technology, such as injections, may be used alongside shamanic curing techniques. Brown shows that there is a clear connection between the body and knowledge or "thought" in Aguaruna thinking. Thus in what follows we are apparently dealing with a regionwide phenomenon, and not merely a specific ethnographic case. The Cashinahua (Huni Kuin) in Context The Cashinahua-or Huni Kuin (Real People; Human Beings), as they prefer to be known-are a Panoan-speaking people living in the Brazilian state of Acre on the headwaters of the Purus River in Peru.8 They number about 5,000 people altogether. They practice slash-and-burn agriculture, hunting and fishing, and produce rubber, handicrafts, and some foodstuffs for sale in regional urban centers. The Cashinahua have been in greater or lesser contact with nonindigenous settlers and explorers since the end of the 19th century. At that time most Cashina- hua were dislocated from their homeland, pushed out by colonists who were engaged in the collection of wild rubber, which abounds in Acre. The Cashinahua dispersed over a wide area, some maintaining close relations with the "whites," working in the rubber collection system, and others seeking to avoid them.9 Some Cashinahua, as a result, are more comfortable speaking Portuguese, whilst others are monolingual in Hancha Huni Kuin (their Panoan language). The history of each contemporary group, then, is different. Yet at various historical moments inter- 351</page><page sequence="6">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY Cashinahua ties were reactivated, and visits, marriages, and migratory movements have ensured that the Cashinahua continue to conceive of themselves in most contexts as one people. This sense of identity is reinforced by, among other practices, the alternate-generation naming system linked as it is to a Kariera-type marriage system based on moiety exogamy (see Kensinger 1984; McCallum 1989). Cashinahua endogamy is still the overwhelming pattern, and monolingualism is actually growing in some areas (see McCallum 1990). Since the mid-1970s the male leaders of Brazilian Cashinahua have grown increasingly competent in the political lobbying required to defend their land rights. For this purpose they must often visit Rio Branco, capital of the state of Acre, or even go further afield to Brasilia, the capital of Brazil. Attempts to set up indigenous cooperatives during the 1980s in a number of areas resulted in greater political muscle, even where financial difficulties inevitably ensued. During that decade a literacy course for bilingual Cashinahua teachers resulted in the creation of an expanded education program, including the training of a handful of "barefoot doctors." As might be expected, this came in response to a poor (and worsening) health situation in indigenous areas in Acre. As with other groups in Amazonia, these people were severely affected by contact with nonindigenous pathogens, such that the major part of their population in the mid-19th century was probably decimated by epidemics. Kensinger, a social anthropologist who has been working with the Peruvian Cashinahua since the sixties, estimated that four-fifths of the adult population in that area died in the year 1951. The contemporary health situation remains precarious: infant mortality is high, and diseases such as tuberculosis are on the increase. The Cashinahua response to the various health crises that have affected them has been mixed. In the past, some groups sought greater isolation from the ill effects of contact with white people. Increasingly, however, they seek greater access to whites' medicines (P. remedio do branco, C. nawan dau) and, in urgent cases, to institutions and medical doctors. In the Cashinahua view, relatively new bodily conditions experienced as pain and illness require new material substances and new forms of knowledge to cure them. This reaction should be placed in the context of the indigenous understanding of the relation between matter (such as "medicine") and knowledge in the body. The next section explores how this relation comes about during the processes of conception, pregnancy, birth, and growth. The Body The Cashinahua body is determined by factors outside it. It is the place in which social and supernatural processes coalesce and is made by others in a constant flow involving nutrition, abstention, the application of medicines, body painting, baptismal rituals, and formal training.'0 The Cashinahua understand this flow as constitutive of kinship and affinity. A child's healthy growth depends upon ties with its close relatives, until it reaches an age where it too can contribute to the development and health of others, especially its own spouse and children. Work and suffering, upon which the making of others depends, cause the decline and loss of the strength and youth of a person. By caring for others, one loses one's abilities 352</page><page sequence="7">THE BODY THAT KNOWS and comes to depend, once again, on relatives, this time children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren." A body's shape and nature is determined by external intervention from the start. In 1990 I interviewed Zeca, a young bilingual Cashinahua from the Purus region, who was training to be a "barefoot doctor" in Rio Branco.'2 I asked him in Portuguese to explain Cashinahua conception theory. He replied, not without humor To generate [P. gerar] a child.... First you have to make love with your wife. If she wants to make a child immediately, she must ask the dauya [herbalist] for medicine to cause conception. [Tape 14]13 Like all Cashinahua, Zeca gives priority to sexual intercourse as the physical means of creating (C. ba-) a child. Repeated acts of intercourse progressively build up the fetus, such that if a woman has several lovers, physical paternity is considered multiple. Here, Zeca is explaining that an added but important recourse for conception is that of certain plant medicines (dau) known to specialists, the huni dauya (in this context "herbalist").'4 The plant remedy can speed up the conception process. Such plants, I discovered, are also known to many people, who might teach their children where in the forest to search for them and how to apply them. Alternatively, the huni dauya may do so for them. There are a number of kinds of conception medicine. One, for example, is called "tapir semen" (C. awa juda), a root whose juice is squeezed over the belly and vulva of the woman. It is especially used by younger women, who are generally regarded as having greater difficulties conceiving. When this medicine is applied the would-be mother must also observe dietary restrictions, avoiding anything "strong" (C. paepa) such as forest fruits or pharmaceutical medicines. Zeca explained that when the couple notices that she has missed a period, they say "She's already fertilized [P. enxertada], already engendering a life." Nevertheless, the couple must continue to work at making the fetus grow through repeated inter- course, diet, and the judicious use of plant medicines. Women have a much stronger grasp of conception techniques, according to both male and female informants. They know the best days to conceive, for example. This "woman's knowledge" is more than technical, however. Women's bodies are also instruments of transformation of the substances that go to building up the baby. The womb is analogous to a cooking pot that transforms raw food to "cooked" (C. ba, cooked, created, formed). The process of generating a child is also termed ba-, and the womb appears to heat the child, thus growing or "cooking" it until it is ready to be born. At this point the waters break and the Cashinahua say that without the amniotic fluid there is a danger that the child will be overheated (kui). "Your old clothes are burning," says the midwife or chanter when birth is in progress, as if the caul were the clothing of the baby in the womb, now burning since the water has spilled over.'5 During the process of procreation the man must drink plenty of corn caissuma (a drink based on maize and peanuts), which helps him produce the semen used in making the fetus grow. The woman's diet, like the man's, affects the shape and growth of the fetus. There are a number of types of game and fish that must be avoided, since each affects the physique and strength of the baby in different, adverse ways.'6 It is best if the woman eats mainly female game. Later on in 353</page><page sequence="8">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY pregnancy she must also avoid eating male game animals and start using a medicine called "mouse's tail" (xuya hina), which will help her give birth easily. This is a leaf medicine that is steeped in hot water and then used to bathe the expectant mother. It can also be used more often to ensure that the child will be born a girl. If a boy is desired, another plant medicine can be squeezed onto the tongue. Both applications should be carried out while singing a chant taught by the ancestral midwife mouse who showed human women all the steps to giving birth.17 Thus a child's body, from its earliest moment, is shaped by human agency out of material elements taken from the environment, such as plants or game. These elements are transformed and transferred in acts constitutive of social relations, such as feeding or sex. Each act of the parents and the others who do things to the woman's body gives growth an individual twist, depending on the substance transferred. Thus excessive use of medicine to help speech may make a child excessively garrulous. Likewise, if a mother eats tapir whilst pregnant her child will be born dangerously large. All the myriad materials that impinge upon or enter the child's body, whether in a controlled fashion or simply through chance contact, form its particular individuality. Each process of generating and raising a child takes an individual course. Each person is made up of a unique and intricate mixture of matter. Whilst the child is unborn its unique growth is mediated through the bodies of its parents. Birth signals a new stage, where the child's body comes into more direct contact with elements of the material environment. Once delivered, the newborn is washed in warm water and then placed in a hammock over a basin containing hot coals. This is done in order to "harden" the soft body of the child.'I After a week it will be painted all black tvith genipapo, the juice of a forest fruit that stains the skin for a week or so. This helps the child to grow and to avoid sickness. From time to time afterward the infant will be painted again for the same reason. Growth is above all dependent upon the consumption of breast milk (on demand) and the close physical relationship with the mother. The parents and especially the mother continue to avoid certain foods as part of the process of "making grow" (yume wa-) a child. The child eats solid foods from the earliest weeks, starting with sweet food-cereal prepared from corn starch-and after several months mashed boiled plantain, moving on to pieces of meat or boneless fish "when it can sit on its own." The parents also treat the child's body periodically with plant medicines, used as infusions in bathwater, or in steam or smoke baths, squeezed to produce juices applied onto the skin, eyes, or in the mouth, or pounded into ointments.'9 These produce many effects, which are understood as having an accumulative action that forms the personality of the child and acts to harden and "close" its body. Zeca explained: At first his body, the child is born, the first day of life, the first year. Then the older ones-the mother, the father, the uncles, the grandfather-they have a preparation of native medicine [dau]. They give a lot of baths [with medicated water], they go along giving a lot of experience [P. experiencia] with these baths. And there is medicine so as not to be angry, and medicine not to cry too much, and medicine to sleep well, to dream well. Medicine also so that a bad spirit won't come up against the child, so that it won't get an illness. So in this way the child gets harder. . .. When it starts to sit, then it will taste meat, it will have another taste. That is 354</page><page sequence="9">THE BODY THAT KNOWS how the human being begins to grow. If the mother and father treat it very well, when it is a year old it will begin to speak. Begins to play and observe things. Kids are real sharp, aren't they? [Tape 14] Thus the development of the child's personality can be understood as a material process that is directioned by adult kin. The molding of personality through the application of plant medicines is part of the larger process, described here as "giving experience," that also protects the body physically and engenders its growth. By using the term experiencia Zeca makes a subtle but explicit connection between mental and material growth. For the Brazilians, experience is a term used in an epistemological sense, to refer to the new conceptual and perceptual condition of a person who has passed through an event: she or he "knows" something new afterward, in a mental and emotional sense. Zeca is obviously well aware of this usage. However, he uses the term with a particularily Cashinahua connotation: here, experience does not have to pass through a "mental faculty." It is enough that the body itself is subject to the direct effects of the external agent or matter-in this case the medicines used. Knowledge There is no specific Cashinahua term that may be translated as "knowledge." The closest equivalent, unaya, may be glossed as "with knowing/learning," in an active rather than a given sense. In general, linguistic usage in Cashinahua suggests that bodies continuously accumulate the effects of "experiences," and that what we might seek to treat as "knowledge" is in fact a process rather than a fixed category. Knowledge is thus not a closed field. What the world contains and the body encounters can be known. Knowledge does not appear to have a separable existence outside the body, but rather is an intimate part of each developing body. Thus a Cashinahua would say that one "learns" and not that one "has knowledge." However, if knowledge does not exist apart from the body, it does take a substantial form within it. I use the term in this specific sense to refer to the physical effects of past experiences within individual Cashinahua bodies.20 Different bodies differentially accumulate "knowledge" depending on their own particular histories. A number of experiential and physical processes are involved in learning (C. unan-), and in teaching or "making know" (C. unanma-): visual, sensory, auditory, and digestive. But all these processes involve the inscrip- tion of knowledge into body parts in a material sense. Different parts of the body are the loci of different kinds of knowledge. Ken Kensinger, who is the Cashina- hua's first modem ethnographer and whose work has shaped all subsequent studies, writes apropos of Cashinahua epistemology:2' 'a wise man, huni unaya, has knowledge throughout his whole body. Hawen yuda dasibi unaia, his whole body knows,' they say. When I asked them where specifically a wise man had knowledge, they listed his skin, his hands, his ears, his genitals, his liver, and his eyes. 'Does his brain have knowledge?' I asked. 'Hamaki (it doesn't),' they responded. [1995:239] A person probably does not have knowledge in his or her brain because there is no function attributed to the brain (as far as I know), nor does any physical experience appear to affect it specifically. This is not the case for skin, hands, ears, 355</page><page sequence="10">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY genitals, liver, and eyes. Each of these organs is linked to a specific process of acquiring knowledge and of putting it to use in physical action. Kensinger shows that "skin knowledge" (bitxi unaya) is especially linked to the body spirit (yuda yuxin). The body spirit is one of several spirits that inhabit a persons's body (Kensinger 1974, 1991; McCallum 1989). According to Kensinger, this spirit forms an invisible aura around the head of a person or a second invisible skin. Through the skin, a person feels and thus learns about natural phenomenon like heat, cold, and rain, but also plants, animals, and forest trees. Thus skin knowledge is experience not just mediated through but also really attached to the skin. A hunter's skin knowledge tells him where the animals that he is searching for are to be found in the forest and how they behave. Skin knowledge links a person to this world and to the forest (in this example).22 The skin and the body's orifices are thought of as organs that ought to allow the passage of beneficial knowledge into the body or else impede the entrance of destructive agents. This is also the case elsewhere in lowland South America. Thus Hugh-Jones stresses that the Barasana are particularily concerned with the body's orifices (open or closed) and with its surface (porous or impermeable). Excessive openness, such as in diarrhea, means that life forces go out; excessive closedness means that external powers cannot go in. Both conditions require manipulation designed to reverse the situation temporarily and in a controlled fashion. Pregnancy, birth, growth, and male initiation involve innumerable processes done to bodies that open or close them as part of their "maintenance and development," rather as in the upper Xingu (discussed by Viveiros de Castro 1987). Thus the dangerous transferral of transformed matter and powers from the environment into the body is an important common denominator in lowland peoples' theories and treatments of the body; and the skin is a particularily important site for this to take place. A person learns from the body's direct contact with the environment. But she or he may facilitate the process of learning by the application of dau. Used directly on the body, dau appear to capacitate the body spirit to acquire knowledge. For example, according to my informants, the root awa dade (tapir potato) helps a man to be a good hunter. Rubbed onto his hands, it will create the conditions for knowledge that gives him the ability to kill at the first shot. The plant medicine creates "hand knowledge," which, according to Kensinger's informants, is quin- tessentially where a hunter's skill lies. Thus the body integrates different kinds of knowledge or skill acquired in a varied manner, in different body parts. These knowledges are mutually dependent. Thus, in this example, skin knowledge and hand knowledge must work together for a hunter to make a kill. Knowledge also enters the body through the ears. Thus a child or foreigner comes to know his or her Cashinahua true name only after hearing it repeatedly used in appelation. The name is said to "attach" physically to the body once it is known. Only then does it become insulting and shameful for the named person to hear it used (McCallum 1989). Once the name is attached to the body physically, the named person fulfills an important condition for being Cashinahua (McCallum 1989). Speech also molds the body in another context: elsewhere (McCallum 1990) I showed that certain kinds of speech can act upon the bodies of the listeners to create a moral disposition for sociability, reminding a person of her or his duties and responsibilities. This kind of social knowledge is built up repetitively through 356</page><page sequence="11">THE BODY THAT KNOWS homiletic discourses in political meetings, during cultos (religious services held by the Cashinahua Protestants), or in speeches directed at adolescents when they marry (McCallum 1990). The listeners are thus not allowed to forget the need to be generous, hard working, pacific, and honest. The speeches function in a physical sense, operating through constant reiteration of the same moralistic points, to "build up" thought, awareness, and memory. When directed at adolescents by their parents, the process may be reinforced by beating or lightly slapping specific body parts. For instance, I observed a teenager who had been lazy in her gardening and cooking responsibilities being slapped repeatedly on the arms (C. punpais ak-) by her mother while the latter spelled out her duties to her. One may usefully draw a parallel between the mechanical effects of such speech and the effects of dau. Both bathe the body repetitively and ideally render the person productive and healthy. Kensinger (1995) is absolutely compatible with this point. His informant stated that human speech has the capacity to mould the ear, becoming a material aspect of it, as it penetrates the body through the ear. It becomes "ear knowledge" (Kensinger 1995), which for Kensinger is the "social knowledge" par excellence. Thus sound as well as matter may function as a source of knowledge and a means of its transmission. Bodies are taught to know so that they may act socially. Social action can be described as "the exteriorization of knowledge," which may take the form of either physical action or of speech and song. Those who speak publicly are "knowing bodies"-adult Cashinahua (male or female) who dominate the social skills in production and reproduction. This is important, for the transmission of knowledge through the voice is founded on the speaker's dual abilities, to be correctly social, and to speak about the meaning and value of sociality. The success of the transmis- sion of knowledge, however, depends equally upon the listener's capacity to hear. The term for "to listen, hear" also means "to understand" (C. ninka). A disobedient child is one that does not listen. "Ninkaismaki, pabuki!" people say: "He never hears/understands, he's deaf!" It is hard to "grow" such children properly. An antisocial crazy person is one in whom ear knowledge does not accumulate, so the person is said to be "without knowledge, crazy, feeble-minded" (unainsmapa). These people are not proper persons. Their bodies "do not know"-at least not socially. Knowledge is also transmitted through sight. The Cashinahua place little emphasis on explanation in formal or informal teaching situations, and rather more on demonstration. Only the minimum necessary is spoken. Thus when a girl comes to learn to weave design, once she has been bathed with the dau that helps her see clearly and remember, she must spend hours sitting observing her elder female relatives weaving. Not all girls are successful in the acquisition of this skill, which is a marker of Cashinahua womanhood. In the same way, when men take their sons or daughter's sons out hunting, to collect rubber, or on trading trips the boys are expected to learn by experience and observation. Thus knowledge is also absorbed by the eye. Eye knowledge, as Kensinger states, is also a vital component of the knowing body. When a skilled weaver produces design, she exteriorizes her eye and hand knowledge, just as when a hunter makes a kill. Production of all kinds thus depends upon the prior growing of bodies that know; to produce is to transmit what the body knows into the object produced. 357</page><page sequence="12">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY These objects and foodstuffs then may be consumed-or known and understood as in the case of speeches. The same logic can be applied, finally, to sexual reproduction. As we have seen, the genitals too are said to know. The Cashinahua say that older adults teach adolescents sex. For this reason, girls may first marry older men, and boys are expected to sleep with experienced women. Sex itself teaches the genitals how to procreate, and begin for themselves the process of growing bodies that know. These bodies, once grown, can then be circulated in marriage, just as objects are circulated and consumed, in the constant reconstitution of Cashinahua sociality. Experience, once it has become a material aspect of the body, allows the body to be social at the moment that it is expressed in morally appropriate productive and reproductive action. Body and Soul Obviously, the Cashinahua do not have a concept that can be equated with "mind" and opposed to "body." However, they are clear that a normal person "thinks" (C. xinan-), a term that can also be glossed as "remember" and as "plan." People also "know" or "recognize" (unan-), which, as we have seen, also means "to learn." These capacities of thinking and knowing are not situated in any specific organ.23 How, then, do they work? How can a whole body act as "mind"? A person may know and think because of the relationship between body and soul. This relationship is entirely framed by the question of consciousness. When I asked Zeca, "Is a child born with a soul? When is it a person?" he said that a child has a soul and is an individual person from the time it is conceived. This "soul" or "spirit" is the thought or feeling that begins at conception and develops thereafter. When the child begins to speak he expresses this internal thought and feeling to others. Here we have an explicit linkage between the soul, an internal aspect of the body, and the capacities to think and know. Our task now becomes to explain the workings of this linkage. The Cashinahua, together with other Amazonian peoples such as the Barasana, hold that each person has both an immortal soul and a socially mortal body soul.24 Like other Panoan peoples, they say that each person has a number of souls or spirits (yuxin, P. alma).25 They explain that yuxin are located in different parts of or excretions from a person's body. One spirit, the "true soul" (yuxin kuin)-also known as the "eye soul" (beru yuxin)-can be understood as an animating principle; another, the body soul, can be understood as consciousness, memory, thought, feeling, and individuality (McCallum 1989; Townsley 1988). Whilst a fetus con- tains a true soul as a constant principle (some say its life is given by God [P. Deus]), its body soul comes into being in incipient fashion and grows thereafter. The true soul is of direct other-worldly origin, whilst the body soul is in the first instance materially derived. This relation between body and souls is found elsewhere in Amazonia. Thus Hugh-Jones emphasizes that the relation is part of the "maintenance and develop- ment" of the body: each Barasana has a relatively material soul located in the heart and lungs and associated with breath. In the first instance "soul" is made by semen, but thereafter 358</page><page sequence="13">THE BODY THAT KNOWS anything necessary to life can be said to add soul.... During the gradual growth of the new-born child, body and soul are drawn together. On the one hand, it is food that both adds soul and makes the body grow.... On the other, people say that it is shamanism that gives food these powers, and that without it all food would be lethal. [Hugh-Jones 1979:118] It should be noted that in this context body, matter, and soul are not in any sense opposed to one another. Thus one kind of soul is mortal. It dies with the body. Another kind of soul, however, is immortal. This attaches to the body when it is named, an act said by the Barasana to work the reincarnation of the name soul of a recently deceased patrilineal relative. This is a "social soul" par excellence from a structuralist point of view, since it places the child in its correct kin/affinal category. In the Cashinahua case, both of the two most important souls, the body soul (yuda yuxin) and the true soul (yuxin kuin), are social, though they have contrasting characteristics. The former grows and changes over the course of a person's life, while the latter is simply present in the body. Whilst the body soul is closely tied to the living person and only separates after the body's decomposition or disinte- gration, the true soul sometimes leaves the body during life. The body soul remains on the earth after death, transformed into a faceless, monstrous, and memoryless forest spirit, while the true soul carries the person's named kinship identity up into the heavenly afterlife. In this social sense the body soul is mortal, and the true soul immortal. The true soul, in contrast to the body soul, is an anthropomorphic and detachable being that resides in the eye and for this reason is also called the eye soul (beru yuxin). It is visible in the light of the eye, which is extinguished at death. Upon death it flies out, in the form of a beetle or bird, to the land of the dead, where it assumes a human form. One informant described it as a person's destiny (P. destino). When this spirit detaches itself definitively it assumes a destiny independent of the body yet representative of it. This independence is reflected in the spirit's greater volatility compared to the body spirit. Thus a human being "feels" her or his own detachable spirit under a number of circumstances, such as fainting, upon receiving a shock or fright, through whirling and becoming dizzy, and during the process of death. In other words, only when the integration between spirit and body becomes loosened does one become aware of one's own yuxin. Dizziness, for example, loosens the spirit and calls the attention of the normally invisible spirits that people the spaces all around. For this reason it is dangerous. A loss or change of consciousness moves the spirit, makes one feel its presence, but also opens the path for it to distance itself in the company of other, now visible spirits, leading to illness or death. A change in consciousness severely alters the way that a body knows, so that illness or death can be seen as epistemological states. The process of dying and the process of falling ill are different in the Cashinahua view. Illness is characterized by suffering in a state of consciousness, whilst dying occurs painlessly when the body lies unconscious.26 The body falls ill when the true/eye soul begins to loosen itself from the body. Illness is characterized by suffering and the incapacitation of the body (isin tenei, "to suffer pain" or "to be ill"). The body, in a state of weakness and pain, closes itself more and more to living relatives. The spirits of the dead 359</page><page sequence="14">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY circle the body, knowing that suffering undoes the mesh between body and its souls. The dead compete with the living, calling the person (in the form of its true or eye spirit) to travel away with them. When consciousness is lost, these appeals might be heard and the ill person, now "dead" or "unconscious" (both states termed mawa) might begin to depart from the world of the living. Now the voices of the unconscious one's kin become vital. At the point where consciousness is lost, wailing breaks out and the grieving relatives call on him or her by moiety name or kin appelation to stay. The first road to curing a "dead" person, then, is to cry and call the wanderer back to earth. Fainting or death evokes the same response, ritual weeping called nui kaxarin that close affines and relatives perform. This is meant to awaken the dead person (besten wa-, "make awaken"). Until recently there was a special means to do this by singing songs known to the older chant-leaders. The songs function as paths of return for the flown spirit, who is addressed by many names but especially as a kind of bee or beetle (samun). This is because at the moment of flight, according to Ze Augusto and others, the eye spirit is transformed (dami-) into a beetle or bug, which thus becomes the "destiny" of the person. It may go, but maybe it will return (as if it has its own will). The eye spirit/true soul seeks release through flight, but the chant creates a return passage, calling it to: "Follow our prayer and come, follow our voice on the return journey" (Z6 Augusto, Tape 12). The chanter sings to a fainted woman of the Inani moiety: Come, come, Beetle, Jaguar Inca Beetle, come. Be born, Cotton Root, be born. Coming, follow the tail of the Macaw Inca'.... Inanin [vocative], come, I am doing you thus-come, follow our thought coming back here, follow our prayer back here! I am coming, come! Awaken once again. [Ze Augusto, Tape 12]27 Thus by means of the chant the curer seeks the retransformation of the beetle back to the eye spirit located in the "dead" person's eye. The chant describes the "prayer" and "thought" as paths or as a macaw tailfeather, so using metaphors of matter linked to travel on the one hand and flight on the other to describe the voice and the thinking. But if the death is definitive, the chant-leader could use another song, this time to send the spirit on its way, to never again return. The "sending away song" orders the spirit to go live among the Incas, to marry an Inca spouse, to know no more about "here"-this earth.28 The song helps effect the separation between living and dead. There is an even more powerful song that can be sung for a person who actually wants to die. This song is only for those people who live in suffering because they have lost all their kin and have no one in the world. It is called "Yamabu" (Nothing People). It is extremely dangerous, and only to be whispered directly into the ear of the person who wishes to die (hence it cannot be recorded). So songs can both keep open paths into the body for the true spirit and also shut them off. They can be agents of curing, of reintegration between body and soul. The voice, then, is a means of remaking the body as well as of making it (as when speeches mold ear knowledge). 360</page><page sequence="15">THE BODY THAT KNOWS I talked to several people who had had near-death experiences and returned to consciousness because their kin's voices brought them back. As we have seen, both fainting and definitive death are termed mawa and signify a journey to other places and levels of the universe. At death, for example, the true soul-yuxin kuin-leaves the body and makes its way in the direction of the land of the dead, escorted by Inca spirits (Inka) or by dead relations (see McCallum 1991). Sueiro, the elderly leader of the Jordao river Cashinahua, knows this path well. He told me: I myself died at least three times. It isn't pain that kills. It's a dream. I dealt myself a blow with my machete and I fell. I was alone. I died. The second time it was the same. I had an infected wound, and when it burst [I died]. They found me on the ground. I was dead. I didn't see anything. On the third occasion I had passed many months with a bad fever. Then I spent eight days without eating. Then I saw a car and I got in. It was driven by white people-by Nawa [foreigners].29 They said "Let's go!" Then I heard my children shouting "Daddy!" I had died. "What are you doing?" [they asked.] "I was going for a ride," I replied. [Tape 11] Near-death experiences are an important source of knowledge about the afterlife.30 So too, for Cashinahua men, are the sights and experiences of the soul under the influence of hallucinogens.31 But the principal channel of knowledge about one's own spirit's volatility and about distant or invisible spaces is dreaming. Dreams are an important means of acquiring knowledge and developing conscious- ness or "imagination," as Zeca called it. "This imagination, we work spiritually in dreams," said Zeca. Indeed, each person also has a spirit known as the "dream spirit" (nama yuxin). It is different from but akin to the eye soul. Like the eye soul, its function is a visual one-it sees out of the body and where it interacts with external entities and spaces, the interaction is invisible to the waking eye. The dream spirit travels in dreams, seeing, learning, and making divinations. When the sleeper awakes from a tranquil night, she or he tells the others of new dream experiences. Thus a common form of greeting in the morning is "Did you dream and what?" In this way information and supposition can be shared. Diagnosis of the causes of illness can also make use of the sick person's dreams, which perhaps reveal that a dead relative or a forest spirit is coming too close. Disturbances in sleep can signal a confusion between the waking, day-to-day world and the parallel, invisible "dreamworld." The dreaming sleeper's body should remain motionless, for to talk or move is a sign of a disturbance in the relation between the dream spirit's movements and the person's body. There are plant medicines to treat many different and named sleeping ailments of this type, each signaled by different facial expressions, or bodily movements, or styles of talking during sleep.32 When children suffer from disturbed nights, their parents will seek these remedies. Talking in one's sleep is an illness because it signals a breaking down of the separation between different domains of reality inhabited by the body-that of the conscious, waking world and that of the dreamworld. A healthy form of acquiring knowledge from the dreamworld is one where to the awake person the sleeper remains immobile, as in death. Speech is the means of communication in the waking world and should not mediate an approximation between the two domains during sleep. Ritual chants and mourning are special forms of speech that span the gap between the two domains-but only in order to reeffect the separation. Thus when a person really 361</page><page sequence="16">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY dies, chants make sure that her or his true soul departs forever. When they just faint and the true spirit is successfully returned to the body, chants make sure that dead relatives return to the afterworld. Talking in one's sleep signals that this separation is breaking down. The correct relationship between the body and its environment is determined above all by states of consciousness. The conscious, waking world of living kin is the place of action of the healthy, social body. The invisible dreamworld is present in the forest around or in distant cities but invisible to the awake person. It is the place of action of disembodied spirits who cannot construct kinship since they lack the capacity for corporeal action. Yet both worlds are known to a person, as we have seen, and this knowledge is vital to the business of living. The body soul can be described usefully as "knowledge in the body" as long as this phrase does not obscure the compound and processual nature of the relationship between knowledge and the body. But the experiences of the dream soul (and more dangerously the true soul) are also processes of learning. Here, however, it is not the soul that is a kind of "repository" of knowledge, as with the body soul, but rather the agent of its incorporation into the body. The true soul and the dream soul are each a kind of person within the person, acting as a mediator in the learning process. Their anthropomorphism and capacity to separate from the body support this view. They go out from the body and in invisible and intangible form "see," "hear," and "experience" outside of the everyday physical and material world. Upon their return, when the sleeper awakes or the ill person returns to consciousness, the memory of these sights, conversations, and sensations has already been transferred to the body. As memory, they become constitutive of the body soul. Thus the process of learning depends not only upon the material existence of the active body, as we have already seen, but also upon the dynamic relationship between true and dream souls as agents on the one hand, and the body soul (and body organs) as recipient on the other. This relationship is framed and determined by the body in its capacity to be conscious at some moments and also unconscious at others, thus placing itself in the correct relationship with the human, spiritual, and material environment. If the capacities to think and know come into being at the moment of conception, as Zeca says, I interpret this to mean simply that the true soul is present in the new fetus. Consciousness and memory, however, only take substance slowly, together with the body and as a quality of the body soul. I have argued here that thinking and knowing as corporeal activities are possible when the working relationship between true and dream souls, on the one hand, and the body soul on the other, has been established. Knowing and thinking may be characterized as "functions" of these souls' relationship only when the souls are securely integrated into a healthy, active, and conscious body. The body is "mind" in this compound sense, as the container of the working relationship between knowing organs and body soul, and between body soul and true soul. Illness, Medicine, and Knowledge It is difficult to continue to keep learning, seeing, and experiencing without falling ill. This is because the same sorts of substances and visual, auditory, and sensory experiences that can be transformed into knowledge may also become 362</page><page sequence="17">THE BODY THAT KNOWS illness-causing agents such as poisons or sorcery substances. The most extreme example of the capacity of words to kill would be the Yamabu chant, which kills the suicidal listener directly. There also exists a plant said to be so poisonous that the mere sight of it is fatal. But perhaps the most potent illustration of the relatedness of the process of learning to the process of falling ill is given by dau. The relationship between matter and knowledge hinges upon the concept of dau, which I glossed as "medicine." In fact, this concept presents at first sight an ethnographic puzzle: not only does it cover a wide range of meanings, but some of these seem to be conflicting. For example, certain ritual body decorations are termed dau, meaning "something on the body that transforms it temporarily (and beneficially)." In other contexts, though, dau means something within the body that destroys it (a sorcery object).33 To take another example, in some contexts dau is curing medicine, as in "forest leaf medicine" (ni pei dau) or "whites' medicine" (nawan dau). By contrast, in others it is poison (dau paepa, "strong medicine"). Thus in some contexts dau cures or causes apparently material ills; in others it causes apparently spiritual ones. This apparent semantic discordancy is also present in terms relating to specialists in dau. A poisoner is termed a dauya (the suffix -ya means "with," hence "a [person] with medicine"), but so too is a medical doctor or a herbalist using forest plants. However, once we understand dau as primarily an agent used to transform the body's capacity to know, semantic unity is restored. In this perspective, it can make the body know at one extreme and "not know" at the other. Inevitably, these conflicting states remit to the state of consciousness of the person. It seems to me that the Cashinahua's relativistic epistemology, which locates correct social knowledge in the acting body, allows a fresh perspective on the body in pain. If health is a combination of accumulated knowledge and the ability to act on it socially, illness can be understood as a disturbance in the body's capacity to know. To say this implies a series of possible disturbances in the relationship between knowledge and the body. First, illness disturbs the process of learning, so that the body cannot experience, hear, see, and absorb knowledge efficiently. Second, illness disturbs the relationship between a body's souls, so that the process of knowing and thinking may well be interupted. Finally, consciousness itself is threatened: the true soul might fly, with death as the final consequence. The effects of illness upon the knowing body are manifestly social. When ill, a person runs the double risk of loss of memory of (and desire for) kin, and a surfeit of capacity to know "others"-the dead or spirits. (Perhaps this explains why mentally ill people are classified as yuxin. They have totally lost their capacity to know the "here and now." What they do appear to know is other-worldly.) So voices raised in mourning, tearful appeals for the "dead one" to stay, are attempts to reactivate conscious knowledge and memory of kin. In a material perspective, they work through the ear knowledge of the lost one, in the attempt to reach the flown soul. If the mourning and chants work, the body hears again (ninka-) and knows, recognizes, and understands (unan-). It reenters the process of conscious learning. This brings me back to the contradictory semantics of the concept dau. Dau as medicine can only be fully explained in terms of the body as a process of learning. Dau is a term that can be understood as "knowledge in potential." In this sense it is a unitary concept. Whether poison, sorcery substance, plant medicine, or phar- 363</page><page sequence="18">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY maceutical drug, dau opens the consciousness to other sights, sounds and sensa- tions. To become proper human knowledge, it requires transformation via a mediating human agent into and upon a human body. Dau can act upon the body, as it alternates constantly between two forms of consciousness, at the intersection of dream and waking worlds. In this space between, dau can act to kill, to "make know," or to cure by virtue of its peculiar nature as potential knowledge. It is up to human agency to define which world the body is able to know, whether it be that of healthy living humans, or that of the spirits of the dead. Conclusion: The Wider Context What are the implications of this ethnography for the anthropology of the lowland South American body? Above all, the ethnography suggests that research on the body should pay special attention to issues of consciousness and knowledge, how these are materially derived from the environment as well as socially, and how their manipulation depends upon the relation between normally invisible "soul" aspects of the body conceived as more or less material. The anthropology of the body in this ethnographic region has tended to approach the subject for one of two purposes: either social or medical analysis. When the interest is in social analysis, the body is treated either as a biological "bearer" of social symbolism (Da Matta 1982; Howard 1991; Hugh-Jones 1979; Seeger 1981; Seeger et al. 1987[1979]; Turner 1980), or, in contradistinction, as a culturally constructed agent in the making of sociality (Bela6nde 1992; Gow 1989,1991; McCallum 1989; Overing 1988, 1993). Since the ultimate purpose of all these studies is to understand the social nature and consequences of the body, the related epistemological issues that I treat here may appear tangential to their main focus. But in agreement with the analytical stance of the latter set of studies, I have tried to show how there is no radical break between the fabrication of the knowing body and the construction of sociality. Instead, social process constantly hinges on people who know making the knowing bodies of others. The material presented here suggests that it is possible to rethink the kinds of fundamental dualisms that appear so frequently in diverse ethnographic contexts in lowland South America. In particular, it problematizes any attempt to oppose spiritual and material aspects of the body too radically. In the Cashinahua case, at least, the relationship between the true soul and the body soul is fundamental to the process of learning, to thinking, to acting socially, and to the maintenance of health. From a medical anthropological perspective, the body appears in the literature on the region either as a victim of sickness and/or illness, or else as an object of curing and especially shamanism. Here, I propose that it would be fruitful in future work to treat the body first as a constructed and knowing social whole, and only second as a victim of illness and an object of curing practices. Finally, this article confirms the importance of the ongoing process of decon- structing persistent Western dichotomies such as nature/culture, mind/matter, matter/spirit, biological body/social person. I hope I have shown that the dualism that permeates Cashinahua thinking about themselves, their bodies, and the cosmos need not be interpreted as dichotomous-that is, static, encompassing, and divi- sive-but rather as dynamic, expansive, and centrifugal. However one charac- terizes Cashinahua dualism (there is no space here for deeper discussion) one point 364</page><page sequence="19">THE BODY THAT KNOWS is clear: in no sense can the Cashinahua view of the body be reduced to any of the above dichotomies. These comments will ring true to many anthropologists interested in the body more generally, outside of lowland South America. But what specific relation does the article bear to this wider field of anthropology of the body? According to Lock's 1993 review this is rapidly growing and constantly diversifying, so no single answer is possible. A perusal of her bibliographical discussion reveals that much of the current wave of anthropology of the body has been produced by medical anthro- pologists. Of the published work, a large portion is concerned with the body within biomedical practice. Thus most critical anthropology of the body is largely con- cerned with deconstructing Western dichotomies from within Western theory and practice, and then in a very specific setting (that surrounding the body in pain). By its emphasis on an "ethno-epistemology" deriving from a non-Western cultural tradition and a distinct socio-historical context, the present article expands the potential for comparative discussion. It poses once again the question of whether a specifically "medical" anthropology is indeed possible, because the central Cashinahua concept of dau does not belong exclusively to a native "medical domain." Any analysis of Cashinahua illness and curing must necessarily pass through other domains inhabited by and constructed through the body. NOTES Acknowledgments.

Cashinahua terms are preceded by a "C." on first mention, unless it is obvious to which language the term belongs. Portuguese terms are preceded by a "P." 2. For a discussion of Cashinahua history and historiography see McCallum (forth- coming). 3. In couvade a man's body suffers similar symptoms to his pregnant, birthing, or postnatal wife, and he must observe dietary, sexual, and other restrictions to protect her, himself, and their child. What happens to the body of one affects the bodies of the others. In fact, couvade is but one form of a wider phenomenon that has become known as "relations of substance," where similar corporeal effects unite close, coresident relatives-at times of illness, for example. 4. Howard notes, apropos of the Waiwai, that the growth of children and pets "was not considered automatic or 'natural,' but the result of deliberate and continuous acts of 'nurture' applied by owners/parents" (1991:50). This comment would apply equally well to Cashina- hua children. Her paper, like Lea's discussion of Mebengokre naming, is entirely concerned with what is added to the body or its surface, rather than what lies within or the relationship between the two. Thus she shows how the wearing of feathers made into featherwork at once "socializes" nature and "transforms the 'natural,' naked individual into a genuinely 'social' 365</page><page sequence="20">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY actor" (1991:50). Howard clearly has some reservations about categorizing the naked body as natural, since she uses quotation marks around the term. However, since she treats the body as if it were in some way a biological or natural entity "to be socialized" in the rest of the paper, and since she ends firmly in agreement with Turer's clear statement that the "surface of the body, as the common frontier of society, the social self, and the psychobi- ological individual, becomes the symbolic stage upon which the drama of socialization is enacted" (1980:112), I include her analysis alongside his. 5. Vanessa Lea, who worked among the Kayap6 (self-denomination Mebengokre), deconstructs the use of Western dualisms in Turer's analysis. She particularly focuses on the public/private, male/female, domestic/social-jural-ceremonial, village periphery/village center set of dichotomies, which are usual in the analysis of Kayap6 use of space and concepts of society (and the Ge more generally). Her critique is concerned with showing how women are central to the transmission of names that are the symbolic capital of "Houses" (as defined by Levi-Strauss [1984:190]). The names are transmitted in major public ceremonies, so Lea finds that women cannot simply be assigned to a mere domestic domain. Names are transmitted by what Lea calls "uterine ideology," but she is clear that this is focused on the abstract Houses, not on persons (1992:131). Like other anthropologists of the Ge, she finds that dualism is all-pervasive amongst them, and that dualism finds an expression in an opposition between name (social) and body (substance). Her critique consists of showing how women are not confined merely to the domain of substance, but also operate in the social domain which she finds to transcend that of substance. Lea states that it is "unprofit- able" to focus on conception and substance since "for the Mebengokre one's essence resides not in one's organic substance but in one's names and prerogatives-this is what is left behind when the rest is gone" (1992:148). As Viveiros de Castro comments, the ethnography in the Ge case is persuasive, in that so many ethnographers have made similar observations. However, until we have a study that works out with greater deconstructive attention what the domain of "substance" means to the Ge, we must remain in doubt about whether this approach to the anthropology of the Ge body tells the whole tale or not. 6. With the exception of Taussig 1986, which, although it contains stretches of ethnography concemed with medical systems, shamanism, and curing, is more properly characterized as a study of symbolic processes surrounding and constructing power relations. 7. Here they explicitly follow Auge 1984and amodel for analysis setoutby Sindzingre and Zempleni (1981) and emphasize that diagnosis is often a process of discovery moving through different levels of causality. Thus an instrumental, efficacious, and ultimate cause might be sought in the process of diagnosis and treatment. These correspond to the "how, who, and why" of the illness: how it happened, who caused it, and what it is all about. The danger with this approach is that instrumental causes tend to be relegated to the domain of matter, and ultimate causes to that of spirit. The body might come to be conceived simply as a material or biological vessel of spirit. 8. Research took place between 1983 and 1991, first during two years of participant- observation for a doctoral thesis and later on two follow-up projects, the second of which specifically investigated the relation between Western forms of medical intervention and Cashinahua practices of and discourses about illness and curing. Between 1983 and 1985 research was based in one community on the Purus River in Brazil, though visits lasting several months were made to other Cashinahua areas in both Peru and Brazil. In 1990-91 research was also carried out in the capital of Acre state, Rio Branco, with sick Cashinahua undergoing medical treatment, their relatives, political leaders, and students on training courses in the city. As well as observation and participation (the anthropologist inevitably became involved in caring for some of the sick), during this project particular emphasis was placed upon informal taped interviews. Excerpts are presented in the course of argument in the body of this article. 366</page><page sequence="21">THE BODY THAT KNOWS 9. I use the term white to refer to nonindigenous people whether of native Amazonian, European, or African ancestory (Brazilians or others), since this expression is commonly used in modem Acre, regardless of actual skin tone (see McCallum 1994). 10. McCallum 1989 discusses Cashinahua "baptism" and "formal training." 11. McCallum 1989 discusses the process of aging and the loss of youthful strength, showing how the body spirit increases in size and power whilst the body's strength diminishes through physical exertions. 12. The interview was mainly conducted in Portuguese,except where clarification was required. The following extracts are my translations from the Portuguese, unless otherwise stated. 13. References to tape numeration are intended for those who wish to consult the tape- for themselves at the National Sound Archive, London. 14. See Kensinger 1974 for a discussion of Cashinahua herbalism. The term dauya is also used to designate a poisoner and, in contemporary usage, a biomedical doctor. 15. See note 17 for the chant and explanatory myth. 16. McCallum 1989 contains greater detail on these restrictions. 17. The myth is as follows. In the past women did not know how to give birth. When their time came, they called the Incas, who cut open their bellies, thus killing them in order to allow their children to be bom. The Incas then ate the mothers. A female mouse taught the women plant medicines to facilitate birth-xuya jina and others. The midwife mouse also taught the correct prayers to be said when applying the medicine on the belly and in the mouth of the mother. These prayers and the medicine are still in use today: Isku pui, isku pui, Isku bird feces, Nedun nedun kaini, Be bom in this direction, Min bachi chuka menuikiki, Your old clothes are buming, Mena, kaindive! Quick, be bom! During the birth the midwife mouse instructed the mother to hurry because "the Incas were coming." She encouraged her not to "be miserly" with her vagina and to push hard. The child was bom, and the midwife exclaimed that it had come out of the vagina. It was washed in warm water as a chant was sung and its eyelashes were cut. Then the Incas arrived and they were offered the coagulated blood and the placenta, which they ate raw accompanied by green bananas. They were so enthusiastic that they licked their fingers for every last taste of the blood (Alcina and Ze Augusto, Tape 12; see also D'Ans 1991 for another version; Siskind 1973 reports a similar myth for the Sharanahua, and Brown 1986 for the Aguaruna). 18. I was unable to find out if this practice is still common. By a number of informants' reactions I suspect it is being abandoned. As the child is being washed, a chant of the genre called chidin may be sung, referring to the child's moiety. The purpose is to make the child cry. 19. See Montagner 1991 for a description of similar usage of plant medicine among the Mambo. 20. Chaumeil similarly depicts a Yagua shaman's knowledge as accumulated idiosyn- cratically, in a process of "self-initiation." The initiate is taught "to see" by hallucinogenic plants, but later the shaman "knows" how to see without an intermediary. 21. Kensinger first arrived among the Peruvian Cashinahua in the late 1950s and spent a total of 11 years in the field. His many publications represent pioneering analyses of such topics as social structure, kinship, and marriage; illness and curing; the use of hallucinogens; and political process, among many others. See Kensinger 1995, a collection of his most important articles. 22. The relation between the body and its physical environment also has a "destiny," like the eye soul, and its fate is linked to the physical condition of the skin. Many Cashinahua say that when a person dies, the body spirit flies off into the forest that now covers the place 367</page><page sequence="22">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY where he or she was bor (and presumably conceived or "generated," in Zeca's term). It returns there to enter once again into a state without memory-before conception and before knowledge. That it should only fly off once a person's skin has rotted (or been eaten [McCallum 1991 ]) is no surprise, since it is a material aspect of the skin. One myth recounting the origin of medicine, Bixku Chamini, appears to explore the relationships between skin knowledge and the forest. Bixku was a man so covered in boils (chamini) that his skin practically disintegrated. He was abandoned by his kin. A forest bird treats him with plant medicines so he recovers. This, say the Cashinahua, is how they learned about these skin medicines. 23. In the case of other Amazonian peoples, anthropologists find that a mind/body opposition is inappropriate (cf. Overing 1988). In some of these cases, "thinking" appears to be centered in the heart and lungs (also associated with soul). Among the Airo-Pai of Northern Peruvian Amazonia, for example, "the indigenous concept of 'thought' excludes the possibility of mental solipsism. The Airo-Pai 'thinking' person could never be an isolated mind ... 'To think' is a social action and it enables the person to engage in productive social relationships: to produce and enjoy food, things and children" (Belaunde 1992:94). The Airo-Pai "center of thought" has multiple aspects and evolves as a person grows older and dies. One aspect resides in the eyes, but normally it is situated in the chest. The Airo-Pai term for "center of thoughts" is translated by them as "heart" and also as "soul" (Spanish coraz6n and alma, respectively). Like the Cashinahua "knowing body," the Airo-Pai body thinks both because of social relationships in the world of the living and through the action of an incorporated "soul." 24. In lowland South America notions of personhood frequently include the idea that people have double or multiple souls. Often these correspond to the body soul and eye soul. See, for example, Brown 1986 on the Aguaruna, Gow 1991 on the Piro, and Viveiros de Castro 1992 on the Arawete. 25. See, for example, Townsley 1988 on the Yaminahua and Siskind 1973 on the Sharanahua. 26. The Arawete also use the term for pain to denote illness, and distinguish the etiology of illness from the causes of death (Viveiros de Castro 1992). 27. This is a translation of parts of the chant, which consists in large part of vocative metaphors addressed to the fleeing eye spirit. In the following chant for a woman, the eye spirit is called and addressed as "Cotton Root" or "Jaguar Inca Beetle," thereby seeking to retransform it from beetle back to the eye spirit located in the eye. The voice of the chanter is refered to by such metaphors as "Macaw Inka tail." Thus: Xaku patxa patxa yuxibu, ooo ooooo, Mia jau ken wani min dakaken, Juve. Juve. Samumanii iiii, Jaukea tsatsani min dakaken eeee, Tsatsa kapetanvanin min dakaken, Tsatsa txankexevani min dakaken, Nukun deve tanakin itana bidanve, Nukun jui tanakin tanabidanve, Juve. Juve, Samuman. Inu Inka Samuman, Juve. Juve, Samuman. Samumanvan Inkan juve, Xapu tacha kain kainyuve, Juve. Juve, Samuman. Inka Xanvan jinadi tanabidanve. Inka isku jinadi, tanabidanve. Nukun jui tanakin, tanabidanve. 368</page><page sequence="23">THE BODY THAT KNOWS Nukun deve tanakin, tanabidanve. Xapu tacha kain kainyuve. At the end, the woman is called to by her moiety name. 28. "Nitxinti" (Sending away Song): Inka ainvantanve. Go and marry an Inca woman. Inka ainvantanve. Go and marry an Inca woman. Ana nenu unumen, No longer (come?) here, Kaibi katanve. Going go and return. Inka naman katanven. Go and return among the Incas. Jabun kai kayei. They are going. Jabu kai katanu. Go return with them as they go. Inka naman katanu. Go and return among the Incas. 29. Here we may take the Nawa as analogous with the mythic Incas who in precontact Cashinahua cosmology were responsible for fetching the dead and taking them to the afterlife. 30. This sort of detail might be of use in a phenomenological aproach, currently in favor in anthropological studies of the body, where categories such as "subjective experi- ence" and "embodiment" are central to the analysis. Data about such "near-death experi- ences" may be used to elucidate relationships between "culture" (categorized perhaps as "habitus" or as an inherited if evolving body of values, concepts, and beliefs) and personal experience and self-explanation of it. Clearly, as in the case of Sueiro's three deaths, "cultural" analysis is an indispensable precursor to a more strictly phenomenological analysis. In this article I have not attempted a phenomenological approach, although its value is implicitly acknowledged. Rather, if the ethnography captures the attention of pheno- menologists, it is because they can see an expressly native phenomenology captured in this interpretation of Cashinahua epistemology. 31. On the Cashinahua usage of ayahuasca see Kensinger 1973. The visions of the eye or dream souls when the body is under the influence of hallucinogens is an important channel to knowledge for many peoples in the region (Hamer 1973). Yagua shamanic initiation, for example, is based upon their usage. When a shaman is able "to see" the true nature of things behind their ordinary and deceptive appearances, without the intermediary help of the plant "mothers," he is said to be able to see by his "thoughts" alone. Only when he can see, can he be said "to know" and, as a consequence, "to act." Knowledge, in the Yagua case too, is a condition of the body (Chaumeil 1983:312). For the Aguaruna, "the learning process consists of a continuous integration of practical knowledge and vision" (Brown 1986:49). Hallucinogens have an important role to play in this consolidation. They appear to work by seating socially correct "thoughts" in the body. Brown comments: "It is not enough simply to know the facts; one must learn to think well by bringing together the body, the emotions, and the intellect in the epiphanous context of the visionary experience" (1986:49). Young Aguaruna who have a school education but no experience of hallucinogens are said to be prone to antisocial behavior (fights, suicide, excessive sexual adventures). They do not really "know." 32. See Capistrano de Abreu 1914 and Lagrou 1991 for more details on this point. 33. Shamanic healing either separates sorcery substance from the body or dispels its effects, as is common elsewhere in the ethnographic region. A common form of explaining serious, intractable illness in lowland South America is that it is the penetration of one being by another (a spirit or a sorcerer), either in the form of a material object seen as an extension of the invader, or else as an entity (Chaumeil 1983; Gregor 1977; Langdon 1991; Siskind 1973). This illness can be attached into the victim's body when it comes into unprotected contact with the spirit's domain, plants, or "pets." In one form the aggressor (usually a spirit in this case) causes the victim to lose its soul. Sometimes this is an act of cannibalism, as among the Yanomami (Lizot 1985) and the Waiapi (Gallois 1991). Thus curing involves 369</page><page sequence="24">MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY QUARTERLY sucking or singing out the invading object (in the former case), or locating and bringing back the wandering soul (in the latter). Kensinger 1974 and Lagrou 1991 discuss shamanism and herbal curing among the Cashinahua. A Cashinahua shaman (C. mukaya oryuxian), through his internal spirit, feels ensorcelled lumps in the body-also called dau-and sucks them out. In this case the dau though visible and palpable may be described as yuxin, spirit. REFERENCES CITED Aug6, M. 1984 Ordre biologique, ordre social: La maladie, forme 6elmentaire de l'evenement.
