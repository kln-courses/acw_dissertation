<plain_text><page sequence="1">ALSO RECEIVED Field book of wild birds and their music.-F. Schuyler Mathews. 1967. New York, Dover Publications, Inc. 325 pp., 70 pls., numerous text figs., 6 maps. Paper binding. 51/2 X 81/2 in. $2.75.-This is a reprint of the 1921 edition of Mathews' now classic work, with the single alteration that all plates are in black and white. The book is now mainly of historical interest, written with a nonbiological slant, in a highly anthropomorphic style, and restricted largely to treatment of bird vocaliza- tions having "musical" character, by musical notation. Modern high fidelity phono- graph recordings of birds with careful annotation largely replace this quaint work and others of its type for practical, esthetic, and scientific purposes. Donald Borror pro- vides a gentle foreword.-J. W. H.</page></plain_text>
