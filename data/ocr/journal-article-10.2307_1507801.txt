<plain_text><page sequence="1">THEISM AND LAWS OF NATURE F. R. TENNANT TRINITY COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND EVER since it became necessary for religious belief to adjust itself to the views established by natural science concerning the structure of the world and the course of Nature, the actuality of a reign of law throughout Nature, or at least through broad tracts of phenomena, has been one of the most important scientific generalizations of which theology has been obliged to take account. And inasmuch as progress in philosophical knowledge concerning both the structure of science and the grounds of theistic belief cannot but cause some change in the mode of adjustment of the scientific and the theological inter- pretations of the world, it follows that each generation needs to find, to some extent, a new formulation of its answer to ques- tions which science inevitably raises for the theologian. Among such questions are these: Is the actuality of a reign of law compatible with divine government? And if so, how is the relation of law, or of law-abiding things, to God, to be conceived, for prima facie several alternatives would seem to be open. And further, compatibility being granted, is it possible for theology to advance to an argument that in Nature's regularity we may see ground for theistic rather than for any form of non- theistic belief, or to such "proof" as theology can reasonably allege for its fundamental dogma? Such are the questions with which the present essay will deal. But before these theological issues can profitably be discussed, it is necessary to determine what shall be understood by terms such as law, Nature, and reign of law; or in what sense, and within what limits, it is warrantable to speak of law as obtaining of Nature. This pre- liminary and prerequisite inquiry, then, shall first be prosecuted. The two chief meanings which the phrase 'law of Nature' has borne in philosophy and natural science may be distinguished as the rationalistic and the empirical. In the former of these 375</page><page sequence="2">376 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW senses, the essential idea of law is that of necessary connection. Laws of Nature were supposed by Spinoza, by the English deists, and even by some who in the nineteenth century pro- fessed to speak in the name of physical science, to be inviolable as laws of thought. There was an order and connection of things either identical with or corresponding to the order and connection of ideas; and the connection between things or percepts was generally spoken of as if it were a kind of impli- cation - such as can only subsist between concepts or propo- sitions. The system of natural laws was an expression of the divine self-consistency, so that the very anthropic quality of unbending obstinacy was attributed to God in order to get rid of the anthropomorphic ascription to him of arbitrariness; or else it was a system prior not only to things but to God himself, which it behoved Him to comply with. From this presupposi- tion of deism it would seem necessarily to follow that the world is as much a mere machine as the materialist could wish, and that divine providence and divine immanence are impossi- bilities. Hume disposed for ever of this conception of law, by showing that necessary connection could never be matter of observa- tion, that no single brute fact could ever be extracted from necessary laws of pure thought, and that there was no neces- sity about pure thought, having any validity with reference to actual happenings. The old rationalistic belief, however, died hard. Kant as- sumed that there was necessary and unconditional knowledge in physical science, as in mathematics. Hume had waked him too soon, and he slumbered again. Even Hume himself lapsed in the same way, in his essay on miracles; while his unwary disciple, J. S. Mill, afterward strove hard to swell out induc- tive science into necessary truth, and to identify unvarying sequence with invariable connection. Indeed we still hear of the antithesis between the contingent and the necessary in Nature, and of the scientific hope that every fact which ap- pears as yet to be but contingent will prove eventually to have its place in a thoroughly deterministic scheme. It may be worth while to clear up this issue, now that it has emerged.</page><page sequence="3">THEISM AND LAWS OF NATURE 377 The universal of law, in the sense of that word which is as yet under consideration, is wider than the universal of fact, as established by simple enumeration or, more tentatively, by problematic induction. The universal of fact, empirically ob- tained, asserts that "every substantive, characterizable as pq, is q if it is p"; the universal of law, however, asserts that any pq would be q if p, and so extends beyond the sphere of actual, up-to-date experience to all possible experience. And the reign of necessary law implies that though a fact describable as a pqr which is an x, may represent a contingency, so that there is left room for the turning up of a pqr which is not an x, yet this same fact, it is claimed, when adequately described - say, as pqruvw, will be seen necessarily to be an x. The latter assertion involves knowledge that the property x is ontologi- cally dependent on a finite and enumerable set of characters pqruvw; and the difficulty about it is that it does not admit of demonstration. Till it does, there can be no talk of necessita- tion in Nature, or of necessary reign of law. Important work has been done of late years in connection with the inductive principle, and the old vague principle of uniformity. Johnson, Broad, and Keynes have more or less independently made it plain that all scientific induction pre- supposes a few specific and definite assertions as to the ultimate constitution of the physical order, which are quite indemonstra- ble. Kant's notion that in Newtonian physics there lay to hand a system of a priori and necessary knowledge of the actual, has been shown by inductive logicians to be quite untenable. Taking the notion of Law as a self-subsistent prius to be now obsolete, we may pass on to consider another conception of law, met with in the literature of modern science, which also seems to imply necessity, though refusing explicitly to ground that necessity either in God or in the natures of things and causation. It is the notion involved in the conception of a deterministic system, as applied to the universe. Determina- tion, it is represented, may be broader than causation (efficient or transeunt). All phenomena may be according to law, or be determined, not in virtue of the exclusively vis a tergo relation denoted by causality between isolable parts (which alone makes</page><page sequence="4">378 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW prediction possible), but in virtue of continuous process through- out the system as a whole, future states included. The con- cept of cause being of late regarded as under a cloud, some natural philosophers would retain necessitation while avoiding calling it causal; and the device by which this has been made possible has the additional attractiveness of ministering to their teleophobia. But here, as in all other cases, necessary truth is purchased at the cost of irrelevance to actuality. In a deter- ministic system, one of the neat creations of the mathematician, the complete states at given times, i.e. the positions, motions, and mutual relations between the ideal bodies, have to be knowable and also correlatable with finite numbers, i.e. measur- able. Unfortunately there are many perceptual qualities, not to speak of the psychical ingredients of the cosmos, which are not correlable with numbers. The world which empirical science investigates is, therefore, not a deterministic system; nor do we know that it is finite; nor that its parts are so rigor- ously isolated as, for scientific procedure, we needs must con- ceive them as being. Moreover if it were such a system, there should be no difference within it between the relations of past to future and future to past; whereas unless there were, there would be no science, if science be characterized partly by its predictiveness, and its world by obstinate irreversibility. All we know is that there are certain relatively narrow tracts of our world that have been found sufficiently representable by certain deterministic schemes (such as atomism) for certain strictly departmental purposes. That the world as a whole is a deterministic system, in this sense, or is even conceivable as one, is refuted by facts. As against all such attempts to take the kingdom 9f actuality by violence, to deanthropomorphize our thought by defecat- ing it to the pure transparency of mathematical abstractions that have no saving touch with the world as concretely pre- sented, we may welcome the endeavor of Mr. Johnson, con- tained in the recently issued third volume of his important treatise on logic, to set the categories of substance and cause on their legs again. This philosopher has submitted argu- ments, apparently irrefutable, for the view that the concept</page><page sequence="5">THEISM AND LAWS OF NATURE 379 of determination, as applied to the world, necessarily presup- poses that irreducible residuum of the old category of substance which he would denote by the word 'continuant,' and for the further view that substance and cause are not two categories but one. The desperate attempts that have been made of late to eliminate both of these categories from natural philosophy, he shows, involve the assumption of a psychical continuant, in the form of a percipient, in order to demolish the physical con- tinuant, and the assumption of a physical continuant (the nervous system) in order to make away with the psychic continuant or abiding percipient. In other words, the con- cept of the continuant or causal-substance is not eliminable from science or philosophy; and there can be no laws of the concomitance and sequence of perceptual things that are not laws of either immanent or transeunt causality. I consider myself so far to have established the conclusion that a reign of law in Nature, in the stricter sense of a system of necessary connections, is an ideal and a postulate of human fabrication, having neither self-evidence, nor logical a priority, nor empirical demonstrability. It need not worry the theolo- gian, because it is convicted of being an outlived obsession, an inheritance from deceased rationalism, a ghost which has been laid by empiricism and by science such as knows its own nature and minds its own business. I pass on, therefore, to deal with the other chief connotation of law: with law as it is understood by inductive science of today. There are different shades of meaning included within this type of connotation, and for clearness' sake, I will select for discussion that which marks the furthest limit of the swing of the pendulum from the old rationalistic usage of the word. Laws, we are now told by representatives of natural science, are not prescriptions, but descriptions of similarities, etc. As to their form, they are tentative and replaceable as knowledge grows. Some enunciations which have passed for laws have proved to be false descriptions, broken laws. Hence the repudi- ation, nowadays, of the notion of laws as inviolable, universal, unconditional. Laws are descriptions up to date, and no further. Description, moreover, asserts only how, not why;</page><page sequence="6">380 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW and 'how' means 'like what.' Thus spoke Kirchhoff, Mach, Pearson, Poynting; and thus still speak a group of natural philosophers which I may briefly designate as the Descrip- tionist School. This school eschews the concept of cause as a fetish, or at least as a bit of obscure metaphysic with which science can dispense to its own gain in clarity; it renounces the notion that science explains phenomena or accounts for them, and holds that science's proper business is merely to give ac- counts of them. In its extremer repiesentatives this school becomes subjectivist: the only reason in Nature is man's reason, and the only order that which he reads into it. Atoms, electrons, ether, etc., are generally held by these thinkers to be purely ideal, conceptual scaffolding, which possesses no value but economy of thought and suggestiveness of experiment. It will be obvious that if we adopt this view of science and its laws, we make a complete break not only with the physical realism which sees in electrons and ether the noumenal or metaphysical realities of which perceptual phenomena are mind-made appearances, but also with the whole conception of a necessary and inviolable reign of law. An end is put to mechanistic naturalism as so much mythology. It is small wonder that natural theologians have welcomed this change of front in natural philosophy, which set in about the time when Huxley, for other reasons, was relaxing for us the grip of Na- ture's cast-iron necessity and was himself hovering on the brink of spiritualism and idealism. And in seeing in this change of attitude the passing of atheistic naturalism, theologians have doubtless been justified. But I would venture to demur to the tenets of the Descriptionist School in so far as they are concerned with the notion of laws of Nature, and to advise theologians not to be overhasty in accepting what looks like a blessing from science. The descriptionist theory, whatever element of truth it may contain, seems to me inadequate. I do not see how, without being faithless to it on occasion, its maintainers can account for the success of scientific method, especially in respect of sci- ence's conditional, yet actual, predictiveness. According to its own account of itself, the theory leaves no ground, no stable</page><page sequence="7">THEISM AND LAWS OF NATURE 381 nexus, in virtue of which alone predictiveness is possible. It is perfectly legitimate for science to say, 'I disregard the exist- ence of such a ground or nexus, as not my business'; it is an- other thing to deny or to imply that it is not there. Again, I would reject the fundamental assertion that science merely 'describes,' in its particular laws; for such description as a law gives is at once something more, and something less, than what can with propriety be termed 'description.' It is some- thing less, because it is selective and inexhaustive, contenting itself with some aspects and ignoring others that are equally there; and it is something more, in that, in making prediction possible, it tacitly presupposes some sort of correspondence or accord between the mind-made concepts employed and act- ually subsisting relations entirely independent of our thinking. Science's 'reading in' is also, in some sense, 'reading off,' else there could be no such thing as science. Science seems to be more penetrating than, according to the descriptionist theory, it would be. I would further dispute the dicta that description merely states 'how' things happen, and that 'how' merely means 'like what.' It means that, but it means much more also: viz. by issuing out of so and so, and by issuing, after a definite time-interval, in so and so. The word 'cause' is expelled from the descriptionists' vocabulary; the concept of cause is all the time indispensable for his thinking, disguise it how he may. If I may now sift what I take to be truth from what 1 take to be error in the account of law put forth by the descriptionist and ultra-empirical school, I would submit that laws contain a man-made conceptual element, an element of analogizing, of the 'as if,' of assimilation to the familiar or to the most easily understood; an element which is replaceable as knowledge grows, and is of the nature of scaffolding or temporary bridging; while on the other hand the very discovery and practical ser- viceableness of laws points to a stable nexus, a causal order, a net-work of relations between impressional data that enters just as much as those impressions themselves into the structure of external reality, so that laws do actually obtain at least through certain tracts of the universe, and that, whatever may</page><page sequence="8">382 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW be or will be, Nature has, as a matter of fact, been found for a certain period of time to be characterized by regularity or law-abidingness. And this is the element of fact with which natural theology is confronted. Our last preliminary inquiry is now prepared for. What are we to mean by Nature, when we speak of laws of Nature? What, in other words, are the things of which our discovered laws obtain? It may be that here we raise a question that is of little interest to science as such, but is of importance to philosophy and theology. It is commonly stated that the entities of which laws of Nature are laws, are percepts: science predicates conceptual relations and ideas of the perceptual world. In the first in- stance, or before analysis, they are the 'things' of common- sense parlance. I would emphasize that if these be called per- cepts, we must recognize a vast difference between them and the immediate, and impressional, objects of individual experi- ence, science's primary 'reality.' The latter, indeed, are not pure percepts, if percept and concept are to be sharply con- trasted. But common things are much more largely conceptual than even these: who, for instance, ever perceived the other side of the moon? And the scientific objects of science, as dis- tinguished from the less defined objects of common sense, be- come increasingly conceptual till the last residuum of the per- ceptible is strained out of them We are not now concerned with this rarer portion of science's atmosphere, nor with the question, 'Is not fiction which makes fact, fact too?' but only with things which we can see and handle; and of these we can say that, in order that there may be laws as to their coexistence and sequence, they must be sufficiently abstract - or deprived of part of their concrete fullness of particular - to be what is called 'repeatable.' Features of the primary reality, in other words, are dropped out of account as, from science's point of view, irrelevant. Our perceptual continuum, then, in order to be manageable, is partitioned into partly conceptual things. Natura non nisi dividendo vincitur. But is Nature, when so divided into things, or supposedly isolated systems, according to the requirements of our human time-span and the de-</page><page sequence="9">THEISM AND LAWS OF NATURE 383 mands of the particular sense or senses that in the human organism happen to be most highly developed, the very same Nature as before we vivisected her? As science proceeds from the macrobian to the microbian level, resolving what at first was one thing into many things, does she describe or formulate laws about Nature as the primarily real and purely objective datum, or about a skeleton of Nature, a humanly constructed diagram of Nature, partly fictitious and yet, like a diagram, having some sort of relation to the concrete reality? And if science must needs take as the more essential aspects of the physical world the primary qualities which yield identities and are subservient to numbering, calculation, and the de- mands of scientific rationality, does it follow that these re- present the most significant utterances of reality? I have raised these questions not in order to thresh them out, but only with a view to hinting that were the reign of law or regularity more pervading than present knowledge is justified in asserting it to be, the law-abidingness of things is but a part, and possibly not the philosophically most important or signifi- cant part, of the whole truth about Nature; and further, that in so far as the 'things,' of which laws may be formulated, are artifacts, or are conceptual rather than wholly perceptual, the laws may perfectly well subsist without being laws of Nature, unmutilated by man's conceptual thought, at all. These con- siderations should be borne in mind by natural theologian and man of science alike when they would compare notes and come to a mutual understanding. We should recognize that by 'Nature,' when we talk of laws of Nature, several possible things, and not one only, may be meant. And now, at last, we may enter upon the more directly theological questions which the idea of natural law suggests. First, is such regularity as science has empirically estab- lished in wide tracts of natural phenomena, compatible with divine government? We must take it that part of phenomenal Nature, or, rather, of the conceptualized diagram or skeleton which constitutes the Nature of which science treats, is "ac- cording to number and law," or at least has been found to be during man's historical time-period. It may be, as I have</page><page sequence="10">384 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW hinted, that law only obtains, in the precise form in which science has formulated it piecemeal, of the world as conceived, as dismembered into discrete things partly of our own carving out of what is really a continuum. But in order to make our difficulty as great, rather than as evanescent, as may be, I will proceed on the assumption - rubbing it in that it is a pro- visional assumption - that what science has set up as 'Na- ture' is identical with the very reality that we cannot directly know but see only through a mirror, in a riddle, and in part. In any case, I take it, there must be some sort of correspondence between science's Nature and very Nature, otherwise the val- idity of science would have no ground whatever. Part of Nature, the part we call physical, is at least largely character- ized by regularity. Does this regularity necessarily suggest atheism? I think we may answer, assuredly not. Were the physical cosmos a machine and no more, were mechanicity the sole truth and the whole truth about it, which it assuredly is not, that would not suffice to prove the fool's negative, 'There is no God.' Law of cast-iron rigidity in the physical realm might still be of God's ordaining, and conceivably might be instrumental to divine purpose. Science assumes, as a rule of its game, that the world is a closed system: that is, it agrees to investigate the world and talk of it as if it were one. That it is a closed system, it does not and cannot know; it neither asserts it nor denies it. Science is atheous, but not atheistic. If science had really found the world to be a mechanism merely - which it can never do, the machine, as is the case with every human machine, from which the analogy is derived, might still serve a Maker's purpose. Thus deism, as it is wont to be called, at least is a possibility, which science after having done its deadliest, could not rule out. According to this particular species of theism, God gave to every created thing or substance its specific nature, and to the whole universe of things its primary collocations; from their action and reaction flowed the course of Nature, the settled order or the natural of Bishop Butler, with its epigenesis or developement-potentiality. In its extremer forms this deistic philosophy played unnecessarily into the hand of</page><page sequence="11">THEISM AND LAWS OF NATURE 385 atheism, in reducing the whole concern of God with the world to its primary moving, and in finding no room for immanent conservation. Law was indeed divinely given law; but once given, it was supposed to be unconditional and immutable. Belief in God and in Fate, might be said to be the contents of its creed. This creed was convicted of being inadequate to theology and religion, and to be pseudo-scientific in accepting much more from science than science was in a position to give. The reaction came in the recovery of the idea of divine im- manence, and I venture to think that many theists were swept thereby into pantheism. I have deviated for the mo- ment into history in order the more precisely to indicate that, in my belief, theistic philosophy, when confronted with the reign of law such as science legitimately upholds, must imbrue itself again with a tincture of deism, not only to avoid lapsing into pantheism, but in order to pay the respect which is due to science. There is a relatively settled order, denoted sometimes by the word 'natural' when used in antithesis to 'Isupernatu- ral'; and this points quite reasonably to secondary causes and delegated efficiency, to the view that God does leave some things alone when he has "planted them out," so that what- ever physical Nature at bottom is, and whatever the ground of law may be, she behaves largely as if she were a God-forsaken machine. This does not rule Providence, or even miracle, out, nor deny divine immanence: that is provided against by the words 'as if.' It does not imply that Nature is a blind mechan- ism and no more. And the only theistic alternative to this theory of delegated activity, of mediated divine causation as distinguished from incessant miracle or inrush of immediate and new divine energizing, is the view that there is mechanism (or rather necessary connection) nowhere, but only conserva- tion in the Cartesian sense of recreation every instant. That is pantheism; or, if not, it leaves no room for the human sub- ject, its spontaneity and its perduringness, and it gives no pos- sible solution of the problem of the existence of evil in God's world. In this connection I have to renounce the lead of my revered master Professor Ward; I simply cannot understand his ap-</page><page sequence="12">386 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW parent repudiation of delegated activity or secondary causa- tion, his insistence on "God and no mechanism," i.e. God as sole cause, or reconcile it with the rest of his philosophy. Matter may be the appearance of spirit, inertia the appearance of conative activity, necessity of contingency, and law-abiding- ness of customary routine or habitual behavior; but even so, the machine-like behavior of the physical bespeaks the dele- gated activity of enduring substances, a settled course, de- scribable in terms of law, a devolved or mediated stream of causal efficiency, rather than a series of new creations accord- ing to rule. In so far as we are to adopt 'God and Nature' rather than Deus sive Natura, we must adopt also God and law. But of course, for the theist, God's relative independence of the created or planted-out substances is not identical with absolute independence. Science certainly knows of no laws that never shall be broken, of no necessity binding Nature fast in fate; of no closed-system world inaccessible to divine energiz- ing or control. The day has gone by in which science could be appealed to for a denial of the possibility of even miracle; the difficulty about miracle, in any sense in which the miraculous could be of evidential value to establish revelation, is rather that, short of having a perfect knowledge of Nature's constitu- tion, it is impossible to recognize any given event as miraculous when we see it, We must be in a position to assert the impos- sibility of its emerging out of the potentialities of the settled or delegated order before we can assign it to the direct or un- mediated activity of God, or characterize it as 'supernatural.' Given, then, God and things - things which owe their par- ticular natures to God's creative will, and whose continuant natures determine their specific potentialities and are the ground of their law-abidingness, our next question is, does this stream of secondary causation, immanent and transeunt, which science describes in terms of law, necessarily imply the hyper-deistic tenet that the causal nexus, the mechanism, as it is rightly or wrongly called, is thenceforward a closed system, incapable of guidance, control, providence, miracle, imma- nence? Does the relatively settled order, the natural, need to be so conceived as to admit of no intrusions of the supernatural,</page><page sequence="13">THEISM AND LAWS OF NATURE 387 i.e. of fresh unmediated inrushes of the same divine energizing which set the whole machine going? Again I take the answer to be negative; such a reign of law as we have found to be legitimately predicable of Nature by science is no such God-exclusive system as to compel us to deny divine government while allowing us to speak of divine creation. The bare possibility of God's action upon a world he is sup- posed to have created, cannot be denied without absurdity. The only question that can be put by science is whether, scientific laws still obtaining, such intrusion is possible, or whether the assertion thereof would involve incompatibility with established scientific probabilities. As to this, 1 would submit that physical science is not in a position to deny the possibility of God's altering the course of Nature, within limits, from what it otherwise would have been, in such a way as to conflict with no law of Nature. By referring to limits, 1 ex- clude such acts as the conversion of water into wine; I do not exclude even so extreme a case as answering a prayer for local rain. Physics cannot rule out the possibility of the direct action of mind or will upon matter in respect of altering the paths of molecules by force at right angles to their direction, such as would change neither their mass nor the total energy or momentum of the system involved. The deflecting force does no work, yet a transformation of energy is effected; and inasmuch as no scientist watches molecular movements, he would see nothing abnormal. If anyone demurs to my science at this point, I can threaten him with my "big brother"; for I am quoting none less than the late Professor Poynting. If we are to object to prayer for divine 'interference' with the physical, it must be on ethical rather than on physical grounds. If there be a God, then the whole course of Nature, even in its law-abidingness, lies in the hollow of his hand; in certain ways, though not in any conceivable way, its tendency may be actu- ally altered by divine interposition, and science be none the wiser. I do not wish however to stress this point; it is one of theoretical possibility. But in so far as the behavior of molar or macrobian bodies is affectable by manipulation, cornm-</page><page sequence="14">388 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW parable to that of Clerk Maxwell's demon, of the molecular or microbian, we can perfectly well see room for divine govern- ment, for alteration of tendency by impressed force, such as would not make itself discoverable by the physicist and would therefore involve no suspension or violation of any law that he was empirically acquainted with. I have said that I do not wish to turn this physical possibility, whatever small or large range it leaves for divine government compatible with scientific law, to theological account. I have no desire to put in a plea for the retention, for instance, of prayer for rain, even supposing that meteorological effects can be produced by guidance of molecules. But there is another way in which divine intervention in the natural order may be brought about, to which I would call attention, and one which does lend itself to explain the possibility of more things being wrought by prayer than this world dreams of. Man's psychical influence on the physical being assumed to be fact beyond factual cavil, the direct influence of the divine on the human mind may mediately produce to an indefinite extent law- abiding modification of Nature's tendency. Science of course cannot deny such influence; theism must assert it. It is often invoked to explain inner experience; I do not see why it should not be invoked to support belief in what have been called 'particular providences' and 'personal messages' from God, mediated in physical happenings; though it is true that the invoking of such a possibility in general might easily lend itself to the engendering of superstition. But we have only to con- sider how volition is determined by attention, and attention in turn by feeling, by suggestion, and in short by subjective states beyond the access of introspection, to conceive of the possibility of divine agency operating on the inmost springs of human conduct, along with and indistinguishably from, the natural causation-stream of which psychological treatises give us some account. There cannot well be less in the admittedly unfathomed mental life of man than psychology vouches for; there may very well be more. I am not now making dogmatic assertions, but I believe I am alleging possibilities and matters of faith for which knowledge at least leaves room. In general,</page><page sequence="15">THEISM AND LAWS OF NATURE 389 what I wish to imply is, that we are not bound to assume, in the present state of our knowledge, that even when psychology has found, in auto-suggestion or what not, its sufficient ex- planation of mental processes, that divine rapport is excluded. The bare facts justify the assertion no more than the denial, the denial no more than the assertion, of such rapport. And inasmuch as these psychic processes may issue normally in voli- tion, and volition may affect the physical order without viola- ting any observed natural law, we thus have room left by reign of law not only for such processes as have been called inspira- tion and illumination, but also for the mediated energizing of God upon the course of Nature. So much for the compatibility of divine providence or im- manence with the findings of science. In conclusion, we may ask whether the relation between scientific knowledge and theistic faith is more than that of mere compatibility. Theism, as it seems to me, is incapable of proof from any particular facts or whole departments of fact, whether prophecy or miracle, the spiritual dignity of Christ, the phenomena of mystical or any other type of religious experience, or the spirit- ual value of such experience. It is presupposed by these facts, any and all of them, and its reasonable ground is to be sought in its coherent and cumulative explanation of human knowl- edge concerning the world, man, and history as a whole, down to its ultimate philosophical preconditions. In a word, its basis is the inexpugnable and persuasive evidence that this world and its course have a meaning: that is, purpose. There is a school of philosophy, I am aware, that tells us that meaning is no business of science and therefore should be none of the business of philosophy; its pursuit is a matter of human sentimentality. I would contend that to renounce the search for meaning is just as sentimental a pose as to pursue it, and far more un- reasonable. For science itself, at bottom, is rooted in precisely this very search. The fact that the so-called probability of the assumptions on which all particular inductions are based is not an objective logical relation, and is still less the probability which algebra deals with, but is essentially hope, faith, or venture, and that reason itself derives its chief factor from the</page><page sequence="16">390 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW alogical or non-rational, is a fact which has been hushed up during the history of human thought, but which has of late been revealed in its stark nakedness. Reason, I assert, is the human demand for meaning for the mind of man: theism is the profession that that meaning has been found. Here comes in the theological significance of the regularity of Nature, of the reign of law in the sense in which science can legitimately be said to have established it. For without the similarities and the repeatableness of phenomena, without some regularity in Nature, there could neither be thought nor knowl- edge, prudence nor prescience, science nor theology, intellectual nor moral status. It is in virtue of a reign of law that there is a cosmos to have meaning and a human reason to discover it. In the reign of law, moreover, we have as sufficient an explana- tion as can be forthcoming, so long as we know but in part, of that greatest crux of theism, the existence, within an order that subserves the highest goods, of evil as a necessary by-product. Theism necessarily takes the highest good which a physical cosmos can instrumentally possess to be subservience to the rational and ethical status of finite spirits, and their communion with God. In the settled order of Nature it sees a necessary precondition of that highest good. In so far as Nature is in- telligible and has a meaning, and these qualities must have a sufficient ground, the theistic interpretation becomes the most reasonable. The world is a cosmos. Newton did not make a chaos into a cosmos when he discovered his laws of motion and gravitation; it was a cosmos already in the time of Ptolemy. And it is not merely its cosmos-form, its repeatable similarities, that Nature shows to science; more significant is the epigenesis, the evolutionary development from lower to higher, the sug- gestiveness of increasing purpose which it presents. This sug- gestiveness, expressed in terms of teleological, aesthetic, and moral arguments for the being of God, has always been the basis of common-sense natural theology, and has always com- manded the respect of philosophers even when, like Hume and Kant, they have been severely iconoclastic. That so much of order as the world presents can be the outcome of blind chance or undesigned and ungrounded coincidence has generally been</page><page sequence="17">THEISM AND LAWS OF NATURE 391 as shocking to human reason as it would be to have it argued that Hamlet was produced by the shuffling of some founts of type.
