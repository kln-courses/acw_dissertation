<plain_text><page sequence="1">J. G. SCOTT, M A A ROMANESQUE CENSER FROM BEARSDEN, GLASGOW The censer here described was presented to Glasgow Art Gallery and Museum in 1927 by Mr Robert Readman, who was under the impression that it had been found on the "Roman Wall at Old Kilpatrick"&lt;1 &gt;. Sub sequently Mr Readman's two sisters amended this ascription, stating that they understood the censer to have been found by their father in 1879 when digging the foundations of a house, later called "Camphill" and occupied by the Readman family in 1880, close beside the line of the Antonine Wall on top of the hill formerly known as Fcrguston Muir at New Kilpatrick, which is now Bearsden&lt;2). The second and more circumstantial account is preferred here. The discovery of the censer might be held to point to the former existence of a chapel, or other mediaeval religious site, but neither remains nor record of such appear to be extant. Description (Pl. i) The censer has a lily connected by two sur viving chains to rods which slide through loops in the bowl and cover of the censer proper. Both bowl and cover are of cast copper or bronze, the outer surfaces of which have been roughly smoothed and decorated with incised ornament. The footed bowl has below the rim a band of zigzag ornament with the spaces occasionally infilled with punched impressions. It has three projecting loops corresponding with three on the cover; through the loops pass sliding copper or bronze rods, two recurved at each end, the third having a nail head and a recurved end. The cover is architectural in form, crowned by a square tower with pyramidal roof, pierced at the apex for the missing chain by which the cover would have been raised and lowered. From each side of the tower projects a gable. Both tower and gables have indica tions of windows, most of which have been drilled from the outside; sometimes the drilled holes have been enlarged or squared, while in one case the division between two drilled holes has been removed. The roof sections of the tower arc incised with crosses, and of the gables with parallel lines. Below the gables the cover is pierced by drilled holes, which have occasionally been enlarged; around the holes a tegulated pattern has been incised. The copper or bronze lily is cone-shaped, with slightly concave sides having four panels of a lightly cut anthropomorphic design in champlev? fashion, though no trace of enamel is now to be seen. The lily has a knop-like finial bearing a fixed ring, through which passes a large copper or bronze finger loop. Through one panel is pierced a large hole to take the missing chain for raising and lowering the cover. Around the rim are four smaller holes for suspension chains. Two chains sur vive, each composed of triple-strand links of copper or bronze coiled wire. The censer is approximately 3^ in. in dia meter and 4 in. in height. The lily is 2? in. in diameter. Discussion All discussion of the origin and date of this censer must stem from two papers by A. B. Tonnochy, formerly of the British Museum/3 &gt;. Tonnochy points out that in the eleventh and twelfth centuries there were two predominat ing forms of censer, the spherical, or some &lt;1J Reg. no.

(3&gt; "A Romanesque censer-cover in the British Museum", in Arch.]. LXXXIX (1932), 1-16 (hereinafter cited as Tonnochy 1932), and "The censer in the Middle Ages", in JBAA 3SII (I937)5 47-62 (hereinafter cited as Tonnochy 1937). 43</page><page sequence="2">modification of it, and the architectural*4 The construction of the censer is described in considerable detail by the presbyter Thco philus in the Diversarum Artium Schedala, and from his description it may be inferred that the architectural form of cover was intended to represent the Heavenly Jerusalem, the "city which the prophet saw upon the mountain" *5&gt;. It is evident that the Bearsden censer is a variant of the architectural form. Tonnochy considers that the architectural form was produced some time towards the close of the twelfth century, that the archi tectural scheme grew less elaborate during the thirteenth century, and so continued in use, in Germany at least, during the fourteenth century*6 &gt;. He considers as probably four teenth century, and perhaps Nordic ? since examples are known from Scandinavia ? a censer in the British Museum*7 This has a flattened hemispherical bowl on an angular foot, with a zigzag on the rim, recalling the decoration of the Bearsden censer. The British Museum censer's cover is hemispheri cal, with a corresponding design on the rim, and pierced by round and trefoil holes. On the top are three gabled structures with pointed windows; above rises a pyramidal tower, surmounted by a boss on which is a cross pierced for attachment to a lifting chain. Rods pass through the loops, and arc attached to three chains, again as in the Bearsden censer. There is no denying the points of resem blance between the Bearsden and British Museum censers, but it is arguable whether the British Museum censer should be dated so late. Since the dating of the Bearsden censer is also concerned, the following comments may be offered. The central element of the Bearsden cover (Pl. i) is a square tower with a pyramidal roof of a type known in Britain in pre-Conquest times, and today exemplified in the late Saxon church at Sompting, in Sussex*8 ). Zigzag patterns on rims of bowl and cover occur on the censer from Ruppichteroth in the Rhineland, which is a splendid example of Tonnochy's elaborate architectural group, dated by him to the close of the twelfth century*9 &gt;. Clearly related to these zigzag patterns, and to the incised ornament on the rim of the Bcarsdcn censer bowl, arc the incised criss-cross and panelled designs decora ting the rims of censers from Limpsficld, Surrey, and from Pcrshore, Worcestershire, both dated by Tonnochy to about i2oo(10&gt;. Finally it may be pointed out that the use of rods with chains, rather than of chains alone, seems co be an early rather than a late feature. Of the six censers possessing rods with chains illustrated by Tonnochy, four arc classed by him as Romanesque, one as thirteenth century, and that discussed in this paragraph, from the British Museum, as fourteenth century, a date here challenged*11). The closest parallel to the Bearsden censer is one from the ruins of the Chapel of Sven Grathe, near Viborg in Jutland&lt;12), and now in the Danish National Museum, Copenhagen (Pl. 2). The degree of similarity in the archi tectural parts of the covers is indeed remark able, and implies a close agreement in date. It is therefore of interest that the chapel can be approximately dated, for it was built in memory of King Sven Grathe, who was killed nearby in 1157. It does not, of course, follow that the censer must be later than 1157; it could well have been old when introduced into the church. Not the least interesting features of the Bearsden censer are the lily and chains, which clearly do not match the censer, for the lily &lt;4&gt; Tonnochy 1937, 49. &lt;5&gt; For a long time Theophilus was identified with the craftsman Roger of Helmershausen, a monastery in the diocese of Paderborn, Westphalia, apparently first mentioned c. 1100, but this has been disputed. See Tonnochy 1937, 50-1, with footnotes and references. (fi&gt; Tonnochy 1932, 16. &lt;7&gt; Tonnochy 1937, 60, Pl. VIII. &lt;s&gt; Sussex Archaeological Collections XLI (1898), 7-24.

Moreover, the lily seems to have 45</page><page sequence="4">been originally decorated in the Limoges style of champlev? enamelling. The Bearsden lily, in fact, agrees closely with the lily, and still more with the cover top of a censer with champlev? enamel now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, illustrated by Ton nochy and assigned by him to the thirteenth century*13 &gt;. It is interesting to note that one of the four surviving chains of this censer is of the coiled wire link type used on the Bearsden censer, and could probably have been used only with an attached rod, now lacking. According to Tonnochy's suggested system of dating, the Bearsden lily would be earlier than the censer by perhaps as much as a cen tury. On the whole it seems more likely that a censer, as the bulkier, more important and less delicate object, would be more likely to survive, and be rehabilitated, than a lily, but this is speculation. Tonnochy points out that the objects described by Theophilus in his Schedula seem to belong to the eleventh and twelfth centuries*14 These would include the architectural form of censer, which Theophilus may hardly be supposed to have invented. In fact, the earliest architectural censer known, also from Pershore, Worcestershire, and now in the British Museum, has most recently been dated to the tenth century*15*. The gables of this censer arc tegulated, recalling the tegu lated appearance of the Bearsden censer cover. There would therefore seem to be good reason to follow Talbot Rice, and to assign the Bearsden censer to either the eleventh or the twelfth century rather than the four teenth*16*. No other Romanesque censer is known from Scotland. &lt;13&gt; Tonnochy 1937, 58-9, Pl. VII. C14) Tonnochy 1932, 15. (15&gt; D. M.
