      <p>The thesis of this volume is that many animals, from guppies to gorillas, have culture, and this is an important factor in evolution. The author believes that it allows the behavior of a single animal to spread through a population and then be maintained in it. He discusses the spread of culture as the spread of memes. Dugatkin has read the relevant literature and explains some of it clearly. He has also run elegant and creative experiments, especially on his favorite laboratory animal, the guppy. He ignores, however, significant conceptual distinctions, leading him to conflate concepts and draw false conclusions. To understand why, it will help to review some evolutionary theory about replicators and selectors.</p>

         <title>REPLICATORS AND SELECTORS</title>
         <p>As Darwin demonstrated in <italic>On the Origin of Species,</italic> evolution requires both replicators and selectors. Replicators make copies of themselves—they replicate. For replicators to evolve, they must have three attributes: they must make many copies of themselves, they must inherit some characteristics, and some of the characteristics must vary. Darwin explains these matters in detail in Chapters 1, 2, and 5 of the <italic>Origin</italic>. He highlights the importance of variation because biologists in the mid‐19th century assumed that organisms and species were stable. For Darwin, the primary replicator was the organism and, in hard cases, the family. Genes would be discovered later.</p>
         <p>Richard Dawkins made replicators sexy in <italic>The Selfish Gene</italic> (1976) and claimed priority for the gene as evolutionary replicator. He said successful replicators must exhibit longevity, fidelity, and fecundity—the same attributes Darwin discussed using different terms. Longevity is Darwin’s heredity, fecundity makes many copies, and fidelity is copying stability. Dawkins highlights the importance of stability rather than variation because by the mid‐20th century biologists assumed genes, organisms, and species varied. In fact, evolution requires replicators that are extremely stable, but not perfectly stable, so that inheritance holds, yet variations can arise. Both Darwin and Dawkins know this.</p>
         <p>By the late 20th century, biologists had discovered many replicators—chemical genes, biological organisms, sociobiological groups, and evolutionary species. Most biologists do not discuss species as replicators because species replicate so slowly by human standards, but they have the three requisite attributes.</p>
         <p>As Darwin argued in Chapters 3 and 4 of the <italic>Origin,</italic> natural selection is the main force that drives evolution. It is the mindless, goalless, natural force that gives organisms the appearance of having been rationally designed. In showing that natural selection could create the appearance of design, he destroyed William Paley’s argument that apparent design implies a Designer God (Paley 1970). Darwin’s discovery of natural selection transported the origin of species and the source of their diversity from the realm of theology into that of science.</p>
         <p>By the late 20th century biologists had uncovered many levels of selection and had shown that selection usually acts at the lowest level in which variation occurs. This means in practice that selection acts most often on the organism, despite Dawkins’s loving embrace of his selfish genes. If organisms in a group vary little among themselves and groups vary significantly, selection will act on the group.</p>
         <p>Since the 1970s, some biologists have sought to build bridges from evolution to culture. The most successful attempts have been sociobiological, as summarized lucidly in John Alcock’s <italic>The Triumph of Sociobiology</italic> (2001). Yet while sociobiology explains a lot about people’s hankering after resources and reproduction, about the power of kin and clan, and about nepotism, racism, and genocide, it fails to explain battalions and ballet, the rescue of strangers and enemies, and warring armies celebrating Christmas together on the western front, as they did during World War I. Sociobiology lays the foundations of culture, but it alone is unable to explain its power or all its products. Something more is needed.</p>
         <p>During the last century sociologists and anthropologists produced dozens of theories to explain culture’s power and products, most of them unrelated to biology. None has prevailed. Many are incompatible. Recently, Susan Blackmore (1999) developed an idea, first proposed by Dawkins (1976) and later explored by others, that culture is spread through the meme, a previously undiscovered replicator. If this were a valid theory, it would connect culture to evolution through an evolutionary mechanism rather than through evolved dispositions and behaviors, as sociobiology does. It is this mechanism that interests Dugatkin, whom Blackmore has influenced deeply.</p>

         <title>THE MEME AS REPLICATOR</title>
         <p>Blackmore claims to have found a replicator that has been largely overlooked, and she follows Dawkins in calling it a meme. The term is based on “mimic,” meaning to copy or imitate, and on “gene”: in the proposed theory memes will replicate by imitation and function in cultures as genes function in organisms. Therefore, memes must have the attributes of replicators: variation, heredity, and fecundity. Selectors also must select them—a fundamental evolutionary requirement Blackmore fatally ignores.</p>
         <p>A central question in memetics is whether those items often proposed as memes are replicators. Do they make copies of themselves? For example, hammers date back to the hand axes our generic ancestors invented, and they appear in every culture. I personally own two, each the familiar claw hammer that contemporary carpenters use. I just placed one on my kitchen counter. How much time will pass before it replicates? It will never make a copy of itself. Thus, it is not a meme, for memes are replicators. To generalize: material artifacts are not memes—a distinct disadvantage for a memetic theory of culture. Hammers are copied, for sure, but it is we who do the copying. We are the actors; hammers are the objects of our actions. This is a fact Blackmore disastrously fails to realize. I will return to this in the final section.</p>
         <p>If artifacts are not replicators, and the meme is a replicator, memes must be concepts rather than artifacts. This implies that concepts are primary, artifacts secondary—and not only in meme theory. Philosophy of science captures the primacy of concepts when it speaks of technology as the embodiment of theory. Theory is primary; the development of technology requires it. Likewise, concepts are primary; the invention of hammers requires them. Memes are concepts. And according to memetics: no memes, no culture.</p>
         <p>With this information in hand, it is time to return to Dugatkin’s guppies. Very few people would grant that guppies have concepts, Dugatkin included (p 131). Organisms lacking concepts are organisms lacking memes. No concepts, no memes; no memes, no culture—contrary to the author’s constant affirmation that guppies have memes and culture.</p>
         <p>Blackmore approaches the meme from a different direction. Because memes are replicators and they replicate by imitation, she establishes strict criteria for what counts as imitation, so that imitation entails replication. According to her definition of imitation, social learning is not imitation and therefore not memetic. Dugatkin explains her approach simply and clearly, then dismisses it without argument: “In fact, under this very strict definition [of imitation], there may be no rock‐solid cases of animal culture. But there are certainly many cases of other types of social learning, and this is all that we really need for memes to be present in animals” (p 131).</p>
         <p>Dugatkin conflates social learning with imitation, yet Blackmore’s distinction between them is clear and her reasons sensible (Blackmore 1999:44–50). She explains that animals engaged in social learning observe other animals to discover something about the environment they both inhabit; in contrast, animals engaged in imitation observe other animals to discover something about the other animal’s behavior (Blackmore 1999:49). This distinction is important, she explains, because social learning does not have an essential feature of replicators: it lacks heredity. If memes are replicators, they must be inherited, and for behavior to be inherited by imitation, it must be copied. Animals engaged in social learning do not copy each other’s behavior. Hence, social learning does not produce memes. In all his carefully planned and executed experiments, Dugatkin uncovers only social learning. Therefore, he finds no memes, and his guppies have no culture, despite his assertions to the contrary.</p>
         <p>As Dugatkin notes, culture is difficult to define (p 88), and he borrows a definition from Boyd and Richerson (1985:33) that his argument can use. It is not their only definition (see Boyd and Richerson 1985:2). In contrast, culture is easy to see. It is characterized by its tenacity, as every missionary and revolutionary knows. In a cultural theory based on memetics, tenacity is heredity. Except for cultures on their way to extinction, every culture displays heredity, fecundity, and variation. To discover whether a species is cultural, a biologist need only locate natural populations of the species that are relatively isolated from one another, then look for variation in behaviors or artifacts in similar environments that have similar functions. If such variations exist, the species has culture. Dugatkin rarely finds variation of this sort, and never in guppies. Instead he finds species‐specific social learning varying with the environment. Thus he finds the familiar gene‐environment interaction driving most animal behavior, despite his denials that this is what he has discovered. He does not find culture, notwithstanding his claims to the contrary.</p>
         <p>Possibly he wants to find culture in other animals because he wants all animals to escape the power of their genes. Dugatkin claims we long to think of ourselves as different from other animals, and we think culture makes us different; yet, he says, we are not different, for many other animals have culture too (p ix). The classic claim that we are not very different from other animals, of course, emphasizes that we, too, are animals influenced by genes, not that other animals resemble us in having culture.</p>
         <p>The things Dugatkin gets right reduce the genes’ power; those he gets wrong or glosses over enhance the genes’ power. For example, he correctly discusses the meme as a second (that is, nonbiological) replicator that may evolve faster than genes, may reach beyond genes, may conflict with genes, and may even make species go extinct, contrary to the welfare of their genes (pp 5–23). Yet he glosses over or denies the biological basis of meme theory—that genes enabling organisms to imitate are necessarily present in animals capable of imitation; that memes will track genes if the transmission of memes is vertical (parent to offspring), as genetic transmission largely is; if meme transmission is vertical, then sociobiology provides good explanations; and, finally, that natural selection guarantees we will be careful selectors of memes, for those who selected memes carefully survived to reproduce.</p>
         <p>Dugatkin and Blackmore both ignore selection—the prime mover in evolution and Darwin’s great contribution to the theory. This does not harm Dugatkin’s book very much, for it has already stumbled over the other great evolutionary mechanism, replication. But Blackmore’s omission of selection destroys her final two chapters, those on the human self, which she characterizes as passive, useless, an obstruction to good decision making, and best eliminated. In cases of apparent carelessness, confusion, or neglect in the discussion of an issue, it is always possible to suspect the hidden hand of ideology has been at work. But there is another source of error, one to which biology seems unusually prone, particularly when discussing human attributes. Too many who write about human attributes use confusing language.</p>

      <sec id="sc3">
         <title>CONFUSING LANGUAGE</title>
         <p>Dugatkin quotes a sentence from Blackmore that is characteristic of her writing: “Their [people’s] ability to imitate creates a second replicator that acts in its own best interests” (p 129). The second replicator is the meme. Organisms have interests: they need to survive to reproduce. But what sort of interests do concepts have? The concept of hammer? The concept of natural selection? None.</p>
         <p>In imitation of Dawkins and his genes, Blackmore turns memes into actors who have desires and interests. Repeatedly she says this is only a way of speaking, but like Dawkins before her, she tangles herself in her own language, trips, and falls into the pit. Dawkins got so confused he had genes with selves; geneselves filled with selfish desires; selfish geneselves creating selfish people; and people desperately needing to rebel against the tyranny of their creator genegods. He used the exciting language of personified, powerful, and selfishly motivated genes to discuss simple, self‐replicating chemicals that cooperate in ways so complex we have yet to figure them out, chemicals that collaborate to create animals so altruistic that their altruism almost wrecked Darwin’s theory, by Darwin’s own account (1964:236).</p>
         <p>Blackmore not only mimics Dawkins in making memes actors with interests and desires, she mimics him in making people passive. She reverses actor and object in this manner throughout her book. In the end, fine meme that she becomes, she imitates Dawkins in confusing herself. In her book, memes are rulers; people are passive hosts (as in parasite and host) or vehicles (as in Dawkins). Active memes, of course, are more fun than passive ones, and metaphors are exciting, especially when they imply humanlike motivations. But Blackmore should have resisted the excitement and, instead, said what she intended to say clearly and accurately. Doing so would have saved everyone a lot of pain, herself included, and perhaps would have saved Dugatkin from misunderstanding memes so badly.</p>
         <p>A second way language confuses is through inappropriate metaphor. Consider Dawkins again. After he published <italic>The Selfish Gene,</italic> he wrote <italic>The Blind Watchmaker</italic> (1986), which is his metaphor for natural selection. But as Darwin makes clear, natural selection is not blind: it perceives more sharply than the keenest human breeder of animals does (see especially Darwin 1964:83–87). Nor is it a watchmaker. It designs nothing deliberately; it engineers nothing from scratch. In François Jacob’s (1977) famous metaphor, natural selection is a tinkerer, not an engineer. Dawkins chose a metaphor that expresses the opposite of what he intended as his book’s title. He should have analyzed the metaphor to ascertain its appropriateness. Why? Because metaphors matter. Mistaken metaphors mislead.</p>
         <p>Dugatkin usually refrains from this sort of writing, but he uses language in a third confusing way, and this practice hurts his book. The language used in explanation must be approximately as complex as the concepts explained, or the concepts lose meaning. In other words, to explain topics having complex concepts, language cannot be dumbed down appreciably without altering the concepts.</p>
         <p>There is no doubt Dugatkin deliberately dumbed down his discourse. His sentences are short, his vocabulary limited, and he avoids technical terms when their use would have come to his aid. Moreover, he comments in the Preface that his five‐year‐old son proofread parts of his book (p x). I believe it. But the concepts in all their fullness are not those a five‐year‐old can understand. They are difficult. They have tripped up experts. To express them well requires language that captures their richness and complexity.</p>
         <p>To write clearly requires that actors act, that recipients are passive, and that metaphors are appropriate. Often technical terms are necessary because they capture paragraphs and pages—sometimes volumes—of carefully established concepts and explanations. Certainly language must fit the intended audience, but there is no point in explaining Darwinian replicators and selectors to five‐year‐olds, and Dugatkin’s book is not intended for them, although much of his language is. Language must fit the concepts conveyed. In this matter, too, Dugatkin’s book fails.</p>
         <p>When Dawkins published <italic>The Selfish Gene,</italic> he taught many people about the importance of genes as replicators. He also misled and confused people, himself included. Some never recovered. In <italic>The Meme Machine</italic> Blackmore has mimicked Dawkins. Her anthropomorphism of memes and dehumanization of people has confused her and will confuse others. Some will never recover. Yet despite its errors and confusion, her book is an important contribution to meme theory, and this theory may eventually do what no other theory has accomplished. It may tie those parts of culture that elude sociobiological explanation directly into the theory of evolution.</p>
         <p>If successful, this consilience would be a major contribution to our knowledge of ourselves. The consilience will not be simple, however, for a complete meme theory must accomplish many things. First, it must elucidate the relationship between memes and organisms, which is not exactly like that between genes and organisms. Second, it must clarify the relationships among concepts, artifacts, and memes. Third, it needs to make people central actors, for people are the main causes of meme replication and selection. Fourth, it must be integrated with sociobiology because, among other things, sociobiology tells us why we select many of the concepts and artifacts we select. Fifth, it must sort out the levels of selection in its own arena. Sixth, Blackmore’s excellent work on meme complexes needs elaboration and extension. And, finally, a complete meme theory must explain adequately the power and tenacity of culture. Someone of clear mind, precise language, and pure heart may produce such a consilience. Dugatkin’s experiments show him to have a creative and logical mind, and he can write clearly. Perhaps he will prove pure enough of heart to renounce his guppy love and try to forge this important consilience. Someone should.</p>
