<plain_text><page sequence="1">HELLENISTIC INFLUENCES ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE AUGUSTAN PRINCIPATE MASON HAMMOND The continuity between the civilizations of Greece and Rome cannot be denied.' But it is too often slighted in modern studies both because frequently each is treated by itself and also because of a reaction from the opinion that Rome was only an unimportant step-child of Greece. This reaction has justly emphasized the importance of Italic elements in Roman culture but it has tried to reduce the Hellenic element to a superficial coating which cannot obscure the originality of a strong native civilization.2 In particular, recent discussions of the Augustan prin- cipate have belittled the contributions made thereto by Greek political thought, especially as interpreted by Cicero. Augustus has been portrayed either as a practical politician, who solved his problems accord- ing to the needs of the immediate situation and without the guidance of any general philosophy, or at best as the heir of a strictly Roman tradition which stood in strong contrast to the political doctrines and experience of Greece.3 The question of the degree to which Greek thought shaped the form which Augustus gave to the prin- cipate has been so thoroughly canvassed that fresh arguments can hardly be devised. Each student must form his own opinion of the validity of the evidence adduced on either side.4 But the most ardent advocates 1 At the end of the article will be found a bibliography of works frequently cited. These are referred to in the notes either by the authors' names alone or by the authors and abbreviated titles. This article, like all the publications of the American Academy in Rome, has profited greatly from the generous suggestions and the careful editorial revision of Prof. A. W. Van Buren.

STRONG Apotheosis and After Life (London 1915) 17-25; CAH XI 435-441; and any history of Latin literature. I This is in general the tenor of the articles in the first volume of the Atti del IV Congresso nazionale di Studi Romani (Roma 1935, publ. 1938), which dealt with the theme "I rapporti intercorsi nei secoli tra Roma e l'Oriente". The papers cover many aspects of the influence both of the Orient on Rome and of Rome on the Orient. 8 For example, J. BUCHAN Augustus (London 1937, American ed.

VAUBEL for a purely Roman inspiration in the theory of the principate would hardly deny that its practices were in considerable measure modeled on those of the Hellenistic monarchies, though they may maintain that these derivative elements were transmuted into something new and grand by the Roman genius.5 Yet Augustus could hardly have been familiar with the practical aspects of Hellenistic monarchy without knowing something of Greek political theory, granted, of course, that he had any interest in speculation. A Roman who grew up in the society which Cicero portrays must have learned something about Greek thought either in his education or in the talk which he heard going on around him.6 But it may serve to support the thesis that Augustus drew his political inspiration as much from Greek as from Roman sources if the evidences for Hellenistic influence on the structure of the principate can be presented. This presentation cannot pretend to contribute much fresh material. But only one partial collection has heretofore been made, Kornemann's article on "Agyptische Einfliisse im romischen Kaiserreich," which, though some of its arguments are perhaps somewhat far-fetched, has served as the basis for the present treatment.

Universita di Cagliari IX(1939) 72-86, thought that since Augustus had not, like most Romans, had a year in Athens "at the university", he was not so familiar with Greek, and particularly Hellenistic, culture as were most Romans of the period. For this reason, he was more Roman in his outlook and, when he did turn to Greece, he turned to the "'classical" fifth century B. C. Stella regarded Virgil as the only Roman writer who worthily transmuted the Greek classics into Latin literature. The whole argument is too severe. Augustus could easily have studied Alexandrianism at Rome, witness Catullus and his contemporaries as well as the young Virgil. Moreover, he had Greek tutors, SUET. Aug. 89.1, and Caesar, six months before his own death, had sent him to study at the important city of Apollonia in southern Illyria (in the province of Macedonia, however) near Epidam- nus, SUET.

The Roman imperial administration also has its obscure corners, though it has been better illuminated by Mommsen, Mar- quardt, Hirschfeld, and their successors. Despite these great difficulties inherent in the subject, it does seem worth while to attempt it. Of necessity, much has been drawn from modern discussions, without a thorough reexamination of the ancient sources. If the bibliographical references in the notes seem excessive, they may at least serve as guides to the sources and enable others to fill out and correct what is here presented in outline. Many of the details in 'the comparisons are perhaps accidental and therefore not significant. And inevitably the field of search has been extended to cover both the republic and the empire, partly to supplement the gaps in what is known about the organization under Augustus himself and partly to show how continuous was the influence of Greece upon Roman politics. Naturally, the argument does not depend upon the validity of each single instance but upon the cumulative effect of the whole. Though in any given branch of the subject, it may be felt that despite the similarities there are also many differences between the Hellenistic administrations and Rome, yet when the resemblances are found to exist throughout the structure of the principate, the conclusion that they represent con- scious borrowing cannot readily be dismissed,7 The field of Roman law is at once too wide and too specialized to be entered into deeply here, Moreover, the bulk of the materials for its study date from the second century of the empire and later, when the influence of Hellenistic philosophies and practices might be assumed to have been strong.8 Something, however, can be said. Certain scholars feel that from the early beginnings, from the Laws of the Twelve Tables, Roman law drew directly on Greek sources and, though both the date and content of the Laws are disputed, the close resemblance of certain of their reported provisions to laws attributed to Solon supports the Roman tradition of deliberate borrowing even though it be questioned whether this occurred as early as the fifth century B.

ALTHEIM, Epochen der romischen Geschichte (Frank- furter Studien zur Rel. u. Kul. d. Antike IX, Frankfurt am Main 1934) I 110-119, regarded Greek influence as the leaven in all Rome's history, though Rome's was, in de Francisci's phrase, a "recezione creatrice". The Increased Greek influence after Constantine lies outside the scope of this article, cf. JOLOWICZ 518-534; CUMONT Rel. Or. 5, 209 n. 9; DE FRANCISCI III 1 227-230. E. PAIS, Ricerche sulla Storia etc. serie I (Roma 1915) During the last two centuries B. C., Roman law was subject to strong influence from Greece through a variety of channels.10 The development of the ius gentium, rules of law applied to foreigners in Rome by the praetor peregrinus, could not fail to react upon the ius civile as expounded by his brother praetor urbanus.11 The discussions of political theory which took place under the leadership of such visiting Greek philosophers as Panaetius must have affected the interpretations of the law given by the jurisconsults.'2 There had been jurisconsults at least since the end of the fourth century, but their importance really began with the younger Scaevola at the beginning of the first.3 Finally, as the Romans extended their power over the Hellenistic states, they not only permitted the natives to continue to use their native codes but adopted many general regulations for their own use and even, as is becoming clearer, allowed natives who acquired Roman citizenship to continue to be subject to the local law. The chief evidence for the survival of the native law codes comes from a Syro- Roman code of the fourth century of our era, but Mitteis and other scholars have argued that its provisions represent the survival under Roman 147-179, gave a good analysis of the similarities, on the basis of which he brought the Laws down into the fourth century. Both MITTEIS, P-recht 14-16, and LAST, CAH VII 463, accepted the traditional date and the Greek influence, which Last, 466-467, showed to have been felt also in Roman religion during the early republic. DE FRANCISCI, I 193-207, compromised on the date, by assuming a fifth- century nucleus expanded by Sex. Aelius Paetus at the beginning of the second. 10 For a summary of the Greek influences on Roman life during the early republic, MITTEIS P-recht 12-14.

Jolowicz remarked that the application of the name ius gentium to the rules of the pr. per. is dubious and that i. g. should rather be regarded as practically the same as the philosophical ius naturale, but the phrase has become traditional for the peregrine law. BUCKLAND, CAH IX 866, empha- sized the Latin character of the ius gentium, cf. his refs. He admitted, 865-866, the assumption of Greek law in matters of detail into the edict of the pr. urb. but concluded, 872: "in contrast to the all-pervading influence of Greek specula- tion, the adoption of practical Greek law, where it took place, was an act of choice, not one of obedience to an irresistible tendency". 12 For a very brief survey of "i rapporti filosofici fra Roma e l'Oriente dalle guerre Macedoniche all' impero d'Augusto", cf.

MITTEIS, P-recht 16-17, rightly remarked that a distinc- tion should be drawn between the direct borrowing of precise rules and the general effect of ideas.</page><page sequence="3">HELLENISTIC INFLUENCES ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE AUGUSTAN PRINCIPATE 3 domination of the provisions of Greek or Hellenistic law.14 An instance of the use of Hellenistic regulations by the Romans was the lex Hieronica, the regulations for the taxing of Sicily which were laid down by Hiero and were still in use in Cicero's time.15 Moreover, though the "Rhodian sea-law" first appears in the Roman legal texts of the time of Antoninus Pius it must have been in use continuously from the time of Rhodian independence to have survived.16 A grant of citizenship to an easterner by Octavian as triumvir allowed him the choice of going to court under either Roman or local law and does not indicate that the privilege was at all exceptional.17 This confirms what the Edicts from Cyrene and other documents, especially from Egypt, had suggested, namely that the Romans did not apply the principle of the "personality of the law" as rigidly as had formerly been maintained.18 Clearly, therefore, by the beginning of the empire Roman law had been subject in a considerable degree both to the general influence of Greek legal and philosophic concepts and also to direct borrowing of specific rules. Cicero acknowledged that this indebted- ness reached back even to the Laws of the Twelve Tables, a view that must have been familiar to Augustus.19 How far the legislation which Augustus himself enacted was affected by Greek influences is hard to determine from what little survives.

The opening phrase, imperator dixit, has been regarded by some as based on the Hellenistic Ca8e 16yu, though others consider it purely Roman.22 The question whether the acta, and particularly the beneficia, of an emperor had in theory to be confirmed by his successor has been disputed.23 It is possible that technically all acta should have lapsed with the cessation of his imperium by death but in general they seem to have continued tacitly in force even if they had emanated from emperors who suffered the so-called damnatio nmemoriae and were not mentioned in the oath which was taken by the magistrates and people to support the imperial acta.24 On the other hand, where specific renewals are mentioned, they concern beneficia and recall similar confirmations of the gifts of predecessors by Hellenistic kings.25 The passages collected by Mommsen indicate that the recipients feared not so much that the grants had ceased to be valid as lest the new emperor would demand that his predecessor's gifts be restored on the ground that they were ori- ginally invalid. These slight indications suggest, though they do not prove, Greek influence not only on the general development and ideas of Roman law under the empire but on its specific form and content. Emperor-worship, like law, constitutes too broad and too specialized a subject to receive more than a cursory treatment in this discussion.26 The most that those who emphasize things Roman can claim is that 20 Dig.

He suggests that the reason for invalidating the grants was to collect a tax for their renewal. 26 TAYLOR'S Divinity of the Roman Emperor covers the</page><page sequence="4">4 MASON HAMMOND the deification of humans after death was a practice not alien to Roman religious tradition,27 Even this is, however, hard to demonstrate conclusively. The primitive Romans had vague beliefs about some sort of non-personal emanation which survived after death and in close association with the grave. These beliefs caused them to make propitiatory offerings to the Manes.28 At an early date, Etruscan and Greek influences gave an anthropomorphic form to the previously undefined numina of Roman religion.29 But the Manes remained untouched by this tendency and the conception of a personal spirit, which might in the case of exceptional men become a demi-god, cannot be proved to have appeared at Rome before the advent of Greek philosophy.30 The story of Romulus, and in particular of his apotheosis, apparently took form during the third century B. C., at the time of Rome's entry into Mediterranean politics.31 Either the Greeks or the Romans themselves then invented a founder hero to make Rome's story as respectable as those of other important cities ; or at least they subject admirably through the Julio-Claudian period. It has recently been supplemented by K. SCOTT'S The imperial cult under the Flavians (Stuttgart/Berlin 1936). Despite Taylor's scorn, 58 n. 1, HERZOG-HAUSER'S "Kaiser- kult", PW suppl. IV (1924) 806-853, affords a useful survey of the whole field of ruler-worship as well as a good biblio- graphy. Cf. also DREXLER'S "Kaiserkultus", Roscher II 1 (1890-1894) 901-919. Herzog-Hauser and Taylor both emphasize the Hellenistic precedents for Roman worship. Cf. recently ALFOLDI R6m. Mitt.

BICKERMANN, "Die romische Kaiserapotheose" Archiv fulr Relig-wiss. XXVII (1929) 1-34, has most recently maintained that the apotheosis of the emperors was Roman, not Greek, in origin and character. He should, incidentally, be distinguished from E. Bikerman, whose Institutions des Sdleucides is frequently cited in this article. For the Roman origin of emperor-worship cf. also VAUBEL op. cit.

Cf. G. COLIN Rome et la Grece etc. (Paris 1905) 147-165 on the Aeneas legend. In general, on the conscious imitation of Greek religion at Rome after 250 B. C., see ALTHEIM op. cit. (above n. 29) 154-155. endowed some shadowy divinity with all the familiar trappings of Greek foundation legends.32 Not until the first century, until Cicero wrote his Somnium Scipionis and erected a temple to his daughter Tullia, does the deification of persons recently deceased find clear expression, and then in terms of Stoic philo- sophy.33 The whole atmosphere of the deification of Caesar and, later, of Augustus reflected Hellenistic, not Roman, mentality.34 The Greeks had inherited from their proto- historic forbears hero-cults which may have been in origin directed to living or recently deceased persons.35 But in the historical period these heroes had receded so far into antiquity that they acquired a semi-divine status which, it might be imagined, would have made the institution of similar cult for contemporary mortals incompatible with real religious feeling. Many scholars, nevertheless, argue that the decay of belief which took place in the late fifth and early fourth centuries B. C. made possible the transference to living persons of the cult formerly reserved for the heroes.36 This transference would have been aided by the natural tendency to regard the great general or ruler as somehow superhuman, especially when such personages became more removed from contact with ordinary men than they had been in the small city-states of the earlier periods. Moreover, the Greeks had an aptitude for exaggerated flattery which flowered more luxuriantly as society grew complex and its leaders acquired prominence and power. Nevertheless, despite these arguments, Taylor and Cumont have shown how closely the institution of ruler-cult in the Hellenistic monarchies followed the pattern of that in the Persian Empire and in Egypt.37 And McEwan has traced its ideas and formulas even further back in the history of the Near East.38 In fact, 32 WEBER, 86* n. 398, regarded the apotheosis of Romulus as Hellenistic in inspiration. 83 TAYLOR 52-53; yet even Cicero, admitting that Romulus had become a demi-god, opposed the deification of one so recent as Caesar, TAYLOR 46. 84 TAYLOR, 96-99, opposed the view that the deification of Caesar after his death should be separated, as purely Roman, from his attempt to become a king-god on the Hellenistic pattern during his lifetime; cf. below n. 42. 36 C. W. BLEGEN, "Post-Mycenaean Deposits in Chamber-Tombs" 'AeXatoAoyL 'i 'E1 te( )g C(1937) 377-390, has discussed the evidence for a cult of the dead or of heroes in the geometric period; see also A. W. PERSSON in Asine etc. (Stockholm 1938) 347-348, 350, 354. 36 A collection of opinions in support of the indigenous origins of Greek ruler-worship may be found in C. W.

Actually, however, divine honors for living persons appeared before the cult of the dead. Although it is uncertain whether Alexander was deified during his lifetime and although the earlier of the Diadochi were not worshipped until after death, the Greeks had for at least a century been offering divine honors to living men, for example, Lysander, Agesilaus, or Philip.39 Though these instan- ces have been used to show that ruler-worship was a development indigenous to Greece, the practice seems rather to have begun among the Asiatic Greeks who were familiar with the honors paid to the Persian king.40 The same sequence appears in Rome, for the acceptance of divine honors by Roman governors in the east goes back into the second century B. C. while, as has been said, the deification of the recently deceased occurs only in the first.41 As in the case of Alexander, it is probable, though not certain, that Caesar received worship during his lifetime.42 But both Augustus and Tiberius set themselves resolutely against personal worship in the western part of the empire.43 39 See in general TAYLOR 6-28; PW suppi. IV 806-810. For the worship of humans other than kings after death during the Hellenistic period, see BICKERMAN 253-254. 40 HERZOG-HAUSER, PW suppl. IV 807, regarded the honors paid to Lysander and to other figures during the late fifth and early fourth centuries B. C. as hero-cult of the old Greek type. KAERST, 337-341, also emphasized the originally Greek character of ruler-worship, though he admitted that it was later subject to eastern influence, see Beilage V 376-404 and below n. 56. But Lysander first received divine honors from the Samians and other Ionian cities and even though, as TAYLOR, 11, suggested, the demonstrations were not wholly spontaneous, both Lysander himself and his flatterers may have been inspired by Persian practices with which the Ionians would have been thoroughly familiar. That the Persian king was actually deified during his life is the view of both TAYLOR, 247-255, and MCEWAN, op. cit. (above n. 36) 17-21. MCEWAN, 25, is dubious about the value of the account about Lysander, derived ultimately from Duris of Samos and reported by PLUT. Lys. 18.

Such divine honors as Augustus accepted during his lifetime were Hellenistic. The descent of the Julian family from Venus through Aeneas and Iulus appears to have been invented not earlier than 100 B. C. and very probably by Caesar himself on the occasion of his funeral speech over his aunt in 68 B. C.44 The claim recalls that of the Seleucids to have descended from Apollo or those of both Ptolemies and Attalids to have come from Heracles and Dionysus.45 The tale that Augustus' father had in reality been Apollo is an obvious copy of Zeus' reputed parentage of Alexander.46 And the identifica- tion of the ruler with various gods, which may have begun for Caesar with "Jupiter Julius" and which continued for Augustus in both literature and art, was certainly Hellenistic in origin.47 44 M(NZER, PW X(19) 106-107 under lulius, dated about 100 B.

For the Ptolemies in</page><page sequence="6">6 MASON HAMMOND Emperor-worship was not, therefore, a native product at Rome. The way was prepared for it by Greek legends which had become accepted Roman traditions long before Augustus and by the familiarity which the Romans acquired during the late republic with the practices of Hellenistic ruler-cults and the theories of Stoic philosophers.48 Caesar perhaps attempted to have himself deified while alive and popular enthusiasm forced his deification after death.49 W. S. Ferguson argued in an article entitled "Legalized Absolutism en route from Greece to Rome" that Augustus deliberately fostered emperor- worship in order to bridge the gap between the self- governing city-state and the emperor. The Hellenistic monarchs, according to his thesis, deified themselves in order that their commands might carry a divine sanction and thus be recognized in the city-states, whose constitutions had no place for a human source of law exterior to themselves.50 If to such a theory be preferred one which regards as sincere Augustus' attempts to check the worship of himself, his position of compromise would still have Hellenistic precedent."' Both the Antigonids and the Attalids ruled much more democratically than their fellow Diadochi, the Seleucids and Ptolemies. Of the Attaiids in particular, Tarn says: "they posed as democratic rulers; their palace was only a big house, they never used the royal 'we', and they sometimes called themselves citizens of Pergamum. Possibly their idea was to be First Citizens, a sort of anticipation of Augustus".52 Yet the Antigonids received worship in the Greek cities which they ruled, and though the Attalids officially countenanced only the cult of the dead rulers, they received worship in some cities during their lifetimes.53 Caesar and Augustus were, naturally, much influenced by what they witnessed in Egypt native Egyptian worship, cf. CAH VII 18. In general for the Diadochi as identified with gods, cf. BELOCH 433-434; KAERST 317-318, 404, who doubts oriental influence; CAI VII 14, 16. 48 On the part played by Epicurean and Stoic views in the Augustan "revival of Roman religion," see ALTHEIM op. cit.

A common method of honoring, or flattering, the Hellenistic rulers had been to bestow their names on months.57 The calendar still perpet- uates similar tributes to both Caesar and Augustus, though the extremes to which the senate went in the cases of Nero, Domitian, and Commodus were short-lived. The custom appeared in Egypt only under the Romans so that it was probably an invention of the Greeks and may be paralleled by the Athenian practice of naming tribes after rulers.58 The observ- 54 TAYLOR 73-74, 143-145. $6 BLUMENTHAL, 326, called this an "Einschrankung des Absolutismus" and in n. 5 cited ROSTOVTZEFF'S similar conclusion, Kolonat 92-93, from the growth of private property under the Romans. 56 In general for the Hellenistic ruler-cults, besides the works cited above nn. 26, 36, cf.

It was proposed to name a tribe at Rome for Caesar, DIO XLIV 5 2, TAYLOR 67, and one for Augustus, DIO LI 20 2, TAYLOR 151. As both were to be named "Julian" and as neither proposal was realized, DIO may have applied a single proposal to both rulers.

The birthdays were often, especially in Egypt, celebrated not annually but every month and continued as festivals after the emperor's death.6' Undoubtedly the demonstrations served to display political rather than religious loyalty.62 suchungen zur Geschichte des K.

For the second century, cf. the Feriale Duranum, to appear in Yale Classical Studies, and, in general, PW VII(13) 1146. 6" In view of the material collected in the previous note, it is interesting that though Pliny the Younger reported to Trajan the official nuncupatio votorum in Bithynia on New Year's Day and on the dies imperii, Ep. X 35(44)-36(45), 52(60)-53(61), 100(101)-103(104), he sent only a personal note of good wishes on the emperor's birthday, X 88(89) 89(90). Possibly Trajan in not insisting on the public observance of his birthday was reacting against Domitian's excessive desire for such honors. ALFOLDI, Rom. Mitt. XLIX 86-88, especially 86 n. 4, L 80-81, regarded the nuncupatio votorum for the health of the emperor as Hellenistic, though under the republic vows had often been undertaken for the welfare of the state and under the empire the welfare of the emperor and of the state tended to become merged. A similar difficulty in distinguishing origins occurs in the case of the vows undertaken for a longer period than a year on behalf of the emperor, for five, ten, fifteen, or twenty years, but most often for ten, the decennalia. Such long-term nuncupationes votorum for the state occur under the republic, but certain elements in the imperial practice have Alexandrian connections, as the use of the palm branch on coins, L. SCHWABE Die kaiser- lichen Decennalien usw. (Tiubingen 1896) 32. And the first definite instance of decennalia occurs in an Egyptian papyrus in connection with Hadrian, HAMMOND "The Tribunician Day etc." Memoirs of the Am. Acad. in Rome XV(1938) 45 from Pap. Osloenses III no. 77. The question of the decennalia merits further study, as it is possible that they do not descend The oath by the genius of the emperor in like manner changed from a religious to a political mani- festation of loyalty.63 This oath must be distinguished, of course, from the various oaths to the emperor: the military oath of service taken by soldiers on enlistment, the general oath of loyalty taken by both troops and civilians on important anniversaries like New Year's Day or the dies imperii, and the oath to the acta of the emperor and his predecessors.64 Whatever the origin of these oaths, they had no exact Hellenistic parallels. The mercenary troops of the Diadochi swore to serve their employers but demanded in turn that the employer swear to observe the terms of their service.65 Such mutual oaths in confirmation of an agreement are quite different from the one- sided oath of loyalty of the Roman soldier.68 If, as von Premerstein thought, the general oath to the emperor was an outgrowth not of the military oath but of an oath taken by the gangs of clients under the later republic to defend their patron, such an oath differed from that between fellow-members of a Greek &amp;ztqatEa.67 The oath to the acta was apparently an invention to secure the perpetuation of Caesar's work after his assassination.68 In all these cases, the directly, as DIO, LIII 16 2-3, LVIII 24 1, implies, from the renewal of the imperium at five or ten year intervals under Augustus but were introduced in the second century under eastern influence. 63 MoM.

Pyrrh. 5 5 to show that the Hellenistic kings took annual oath to rule according to the laws while the people swore to protect the laws and the kingship. This may, however, have been a purely Epirote custom. 86 VON PREMERSTEIN, 13-116, gave an elaborate discussion of the Roman oath in all its aspects. In the militarv oath he, 22-26, 73-85, saw a shift from an oath to the state to one to the commander and then to the emperor. 67 VON PREMERSTEIN 26-32. KAHRSTEDT, reviewing von Premerstein's book in Gottingische Gelehrte Anzeigen CC(1938) 9-11, doubted the connection between the clients' oath under the republic and the oath to the emperor. CUQ, DS IV 2 951-955 under sacramentum, regarded the general oath as an outgrowth of the military oath; cf. also DS III 1 748-775 under iusiurandum and the articles by STEINWERTER on iusiurandum in PW X(19) 1253-1260 and by KLINGMtYLLER on sacramentum in PW2 I(2) 1667-1674.

I 3 (1934) 59-73, argued that the lex curiata was in origin an oath of the people to protect the king and that this concept lay behind the Augustan coniuratio. The traditional view which connects the coniuratio of 32 B. C. and the general oath which apparently developed out of it with the military oath seems preferable. 8 HAMOND 104. It is likely, as VON PREMER- STEIN held, 55, 61, that the oath to the acta and the general oath of loyalty on New Year's Day were soon combined.</page><page sequence="8">8 MASON HAMMOND emperor took no corresponding oath in return.69 He might, as did Tiberius and Claudius, join in the oath to the acta of his predecessors or, when he held the consulship, take the magisterial oath on entering and on leaving office.70 But Cuq is not justified in concluding. "Les Grecs n'ont donc fait que prolonger leurs traditions, quand ils se sont conformes a la coutume romaine du serment prette l'empereur.'7l The taking of an oath was perfectly familiar to them and undoubtedly the ordinary citizen did not realize that the Hellenistic monarch had usually made some reciprocal commitment, But the Roman oath of loyalty was one-sided; the prince was bound only by his own conscience.72 The oath by the genius of the emperor, on the other hand, descended from that by the rv6q1 of monarchs or of private individuals in the Hellenistic world.73 The connection between the Roman genius and the Greek ivXq and atllov or dya'#o daitcov, not to mention the possible influence of the Persian fravashi and havreno, cannot be discussed in this brief article.74 It must suffice to say that even among the Greeks, 6 PLUTARCH, Galba 28 1, states that when the senate took the oath of loyalty to Otho, he took an oath in return but did not keep it. The other authorities, SUET. Otho 7 1; TAC. Hist. I 47; DiO LXIV(LXIII) 8 1, mention neither oath. Plutarch may have had in mind the oath taken by some emperors in the second century not to execute senators without trial by their peers, for example, by Trajan, DIO LXVIII 5 2; by Hadrian, DIO LXIX 2 4, SHA Hadr. 7 4; and by Sep- timius, DIO LXXIV(LXXV) 2 1-2; cf. also DIO LXVII 2 4 (Titus and Domitian); SHA Marc. 10 6-7; Pert. 6 8. 70 HAMMOND 104-105.

If so, it is also unlikely that the King and Queen were invoked as gods. Earthly rulers might well have been regarded as more effective punishers of perjury against themselves than remote deities. An oath which survives from the time of Augustus is taken directly in his name but one under Antoninus speaks of his r0Xq. 2 The direct invocation of Augustus also occurs in two oaths from Asia Minor.

The test by worship of the emperor's image occurs before that by the oath, as in PLINY Ep. X 96(97) 5, see BLUMENTHAL 328; E. G. HARDY Studies in Roman History (London 1906) 71-76, 85; and the many other discussions of the relations between Christianity and the Roman government. CHARLESWORTH, CAH XI 42, thought that the use of both oath and sacrifice as tests of loyalty may date from the reign of Domitian. It is noteworthy that in the prosecution under Decius, 250 A. D., the evidence of loyalty, required of all subjects and not merely of Christians, was an offering to the gods on behalf of the emperor and an oath by his genius. The emperor himself was not included among the gods. Cf. PW XV(29) 1281 lines 14-18, citing BLUMENTHAL 328. It would be tempting to use this as proof that Pliny's introduction of Trajan's image among the gods was unofficial, particularly since Trajan himself in his reply omits mention of his own image, Ep. X 97(98) 1, cf. HAMMOND in Harvard Studies in Classical Philology XLIX(1938) 126 n. 4. But the lapse of nearly a century and a half and the changing religious ideas, especially as regards emperor-worship, render any attempt to connect these two items risky. 89 MOMMSEN, II 2 810 n. 4 (cf. II 1 103 n. 1), thought that Inst. II 23 1 proved that Augustus undertook to guarantee trusts undertaken on an oath by his salus, but the passage perhaps gives the author's, not Augustus', explanation and, in any case, the oath by the salus Augusti is different from that by the genius, cf. TERTULLIAN Apol. 32 3 against 28 2-3, and, if violated, more clearly harmed the emperor because it affected his well-being; cf. ALFOLDI Rdm. Mitt. XLIX 86-88, especially 86 n. 4, and L 80-81. Tiberius did not at first permit the oath by his name, DIO LVII 8 3, though the practice is attested later, DIO LVIII 2 8, 6 2, 12 6; cf. MOM. II 2 810 n. 1, Strafrecht 586. Tiberius refused to accept the charge against Rubrius that he had perjured an oath sworn by the numen of Augustus, Ann. I 73 3-4, with the famous phrase deorum iniurias dis curae. The unwillingness to prosecute such perjuries seriously lasted down to the times of Severus and Alexander, MOM. II 2 810 n. 5, citing Dig. XII 2 13 6 and Cod.

The origins of the various elements in the imperial ceremonial and costume have been much disputed. Two studies by Alf6ldi in the Romische Mitteilungen have shown that much of the elaborate ceremonial and costume of the later empire was not introduced by Diocletian as an abrupt orientalization of the court but had already been adopted in the third, second, and even first centuries of the empire.90 The earliest literary evidence for the carrying of fire before the emperor appears in connection with Antoninus.91 But coins of Augustus which show incense-burners and torches have been taken by some scholars as proving that the practice went back to him, though Mattingly connects these types with the worship of the dead.92 It has also been derived from the bearing of incense before triumphing generals, since so much of the imperial regalia seems to have been taken over from that of the triumphator.93 Finally, it has been regarded as a non-religious continuance of the right of republican magistrates, and occasionally private citizens, to be lit home at night with torches.94 This last view is, however, unlikely since the censer appears with the torch and since both were borne before the emperor by day as well as by night. Traces of the custom have been detected in descriptions of the Hellenistic courts.95 If the Romans borrowed it from them, it may well go back to the Persians, who are thought to have sym- bolized the divine glory, the havreno, of the monarch by fire.96 If, on the other hand, it originated in the 90 Cf. the bibliographical note.

Although the institution itself may have been primitive, either Roman or Latin, and though some of its trappings may have come from Etruria, the descriptions which have been preserved are of triumphs of the period after the second Punic War and they bear an astonishing resemblance to descriptions of similar processions in the Hellenistic kingdoms.98 Bruhl, in a study of this problem, placed the borrowings largely in the period from Pompey through Augustus.99 But they may well have begun with Scipio Africanus, who was in general so profoundly influenced by Hellenistic thought and practices and whose triumph forms the basis for Appian's general description.100 Bruhl concluded: "ainsi avec leur robe de pourpre et leur diademe, le Cesar est tout a la fois un triomphateur romain et le successeur des rois hellenistiques". And the costume of the successors of Augustus, with its star-spangled robe, its eagle-topped sceptre, its Medusa-head on the breast-plate, and its radiate crown, grew increasingly monarchical and Hellenistic, not to say Persian.101 Mommsen, after describing the PLUT.

The pontifex maximus lived, or at least had his office, in a small building near the temple of Vesta, the Regia, which perhaps descended from the house of the early kings.103 But the idea that the civil magis- trates should have a public residence never occurred to the Romans. Outwardly Augustus did not build himself a palace; he purchased a simple house on the Palatine, close to the memorials of Rome's legendary beginnings, and attached to it temples of Apollo and. Vesta.104 Thus he presented himself in part as pontifex maximus under the protection of the goddess of the public hearth and in part under that of his own patron god.105 If von Gerkan is right in his contention that the Hellenistic palaces were also little more than enlarged private dwellings, Augustus may have learned the value of simplicity in this respect, as in others, from the Attalids and the Antigonids.106 However, the Ptolemies and the Seleucids, at least in the third century, must have developed real palaces under the influence of the royal edifices of Persia and Egypt.'07 In such structures the successors of Augustus, particularly extravagant builders like Gaius, Nero, and Domitian, found antecedents for the vast complex of buildings with which they covered the Palatine so that its name Studies in Class.

Even Augustus felt that as head of the state he must have an official abode in the Hellenistic manner, though he concealed his palace, as he did the monarchical nature of his position, under a Roman and republican guise. Augustus exercised equal restraint in his titles. He himself applied to his position the unofficial designation princeps, a term which was possibly inspired by Cicero and which suggests the zfciGrog cviqQ of Greek political thought.110 He did, however, either adopt or accept certain names and titles which came during his own life to have a monarchical significance. The name Caesar he took as his right in consequence of his adoption under Julius' will and it descended to his first successors by adoption or inheritance in the Roman manner."' But to the empire as a whole, and particularly to the eastern half, it became as significant of the imperial position as had "Ptolemy" in Egypt and from the time of Claudius it was adopted by every emperor half as a name and half as a title, whether or not he had a legal claim to it.112 The title Augustus had for precedents Pompey's Magnus and Sulla's Felix, though these were not acquired so formally.113 In the earlier republic, there had been similar agnomina, both hereditary, like Maximus or Pictor in branches of the Fabian gens, and personal, as Allobrogicus, Cunctator, or Eburnus, to take examples from the same gens 108 For lavish houses under the republic, cf.

It is in fact probable that all cognomina were in origin designations of this sort which became hereditary and that the distinction between cognomina and agnomina was artificially created by the gramma- rians of a later date.'11 Hence the use of Felix, Magnus, and Augustus as hereditary titles could be regarded as authorized by ancient practice."6 But they have a more Hellenistic flavour than the earlier titles and suggest terms like Ek6sf3it or LTcon. Pompeius Magnus in particular recalls Alexander or Antiochus "the Great".117 Augustus had a Roman and religious Drumann's editor, GROEBE, cites in a note, 344 n. 1, MOMMSEN'S view, Das r6m.

The epithet Magnus appears under the Roman empire informally in literature, see especially for Domitian, SAUTER op. cit.

SAUTER'S work should be consulted throughout for the Hellenistic imitations in the epithets bestowed on and the compliments paid to Domitian by Martial and Statius. L. BERLINGER, Bei- trage zur inoffiziellen Titulatur der romischen Kaiser (Breslau 1935), is criticized by H. VOLKMANN in Gnomon XIII(1927) 310-314 for his failure to recognize the Hellenistic influence. The honorific titles of senators, imperial officials, and the like which are so characteristic of the second century of the empire did not have Hellenistic antecedents according to A. STEIN, Wiener Studien XXXIV(1912) 162, but did first appear as regular titles in the Hellenized provinces. connotation and it was bestowed, not assumed."18 Yet it too reflects the Hellenistic as well as the native background. In consequence of his adoption, Augustus at first employed not only the nomen Caesar but also the praenomen Gaius.119 For this he soon substituted the unusual term Imperator.120 Imperator had regularly been used as an honorific and personal, not hereditary, title during the later republic, though it cannot be traced further back than the third century B. C.121 According to Livy, it was first so used by Scipio Africanus, who said to certain captive Spaniards sibi maximum nomen imperatoris esse.122 Since the incident is dated in 209 B. C. when Scipio held an exceptional command in virtue of a law of the comitia, Levi thought that he may have adopted the title in consequence of some military salutation because he had not previously borne any proper magisterial one.123 Though Livy's story and Levi's reason have been doubted, Scipio may well have been responsible for the use of imperator as a title resulting from the acclaim of a victorious general by his soldiers and, if so, in this as in other matters he was acting under Hellenistic influence.124 Be that as it may, the alteration of imperator from a title to a praenomen 118 The literature on the significance is extensive, cf.

Dio and Suetonius say that it was voted to Caesar as a praenomen after the triumph of October, 45 B. C. and that it was to be a hereditary honor.125 These statements have been suspected as an invention to justify Augustus' use of the praenomen since the contemporary evidence in Cicero, the coins, and inscriptions indicates that Caesar never used the term otherwise than as a title in the republican manner.126 The question is only an aspect of the larger problem as to whether Caesar meant to establish a monarchy on the Hellenistic pattern or not, a problem which cannot be entered into here.127 Imperator appears as a praenomen of Caesar Octa- vianus, as Augustus then was called, soon after 40 B. C. on coins minted by Agrippa.128 If its use did not derive from Caesar, it may well have been devised by Agrippa.129 During the triumvirate, Augustus, like Antony, was still under the domination of the tradition of the commander-dictator which Sulla and Caesar had created.'30 In the previous discussion this tradi- CARCOPINO Sylla (above n. 113) 98 and Imp.

C'etait, en son integrite, la monarchie absolu, et sous des termes romains, elle s'identi- fiait a celle des basileis orientaux"; cf. for Hellenistic antece- dents, id. 99-100, 103-104, 108, 117-118, 124, 134, 150.

ADCOCK, whom CARCOPINO attacked, tended in CAH IX 718-735 to minimize the Hellenistic character of Caesar's program and to regard it as perpetuating, in a hereditary form, the Sullan dictatorship. 198 HAMMOND 50, 225 nn. 13-14 for this and the following. 129 MCFAYDEN, op. cit.

The use of Imperator as a praenomen, though the title itself was Roman, strongly suggests the Hellenistic use of BaortlEv'g before the personal name.13' Since the latter practice appeared only after Alexander, it may have begun under oriental influence.'32 The compromise of avoiding a term like rex, or even, in Augustus' case, dictator, which would have aroused prejudice at Rome, but of employing some Roman term in a Hellenistic, monarchical manner accords well with the policies of Caesar and of the young Augustus.133 Though Augustus' program became less and less monarchical, he retained the praenomen Imperatoris.134 Perhaps it had become so established that he could not dispense with it and certainly its continuance must have contributed to that auctoritas on which he regarded his peculiar position as ultimately resting.'35 Tiberius, his even more republican successor, refused to adopt the praenomen and thereby showed that he regarded it as nothing more than a personal honor, not as a designation of the position of the emperor.'36 But Nero, the Hellenizer, resumed it and thereafter it became, like the Greek Badtlsv'g, the regular initial title of the emperor. Thus the three elements in the nomenclature of the first emperor, the republican title Imperator used as a praenomen, the family name Caesar, and the honorary appellation Augustus had become by the end of the Julio-Claudian period the formula for the imperial position and as such they have descended into modern times.137 In this develop- ment, Hellenistic precedents played a major role. The right to place one's image and superscription on coins is today a traditional prerogative of rulers. But at Rome, the first living person to place his own 131 BIKERMAN 193, "une sorte de prenom". 132 BELOCH 373, cf.

HOLMES, The Roman Republic III (Oxford 1923) 337: "but though we may be sure that he intended to transmit his monarchy, the title Imperator would serve as well as Rex." 134 The odium aroused by Caesar's dictatorship made this an impossible office for Augustus, Res Gestae 5 1 (ed. J. GAGE Paris 1935, p. 80), and his compromises were, after 30 B. C., probably sincere attempts to preserve the republic while grafting onto its machinery an extraordinary executive officer, cf.

The custom is perhaps to be traced back through the satraps of Asia Minor in the fourth and fifth centuries B. C. to the representation of the King of Persia on the darics.142 It affords another example of a Hellenistic practice which was introduced by Caesar and perpet- uated by Augustus.'43 The Res Gestae of Augustus have often been compared to the elogia of distinguished Romans during the republic.'44 The earliest elogia which survive are those from the tomb of the Scipios, which 138 TAYLOR 66; H.

Whereas the Hellenistic coins usually have the portrait on the obverse and the royal name on the reverse, the Roman have the portrait surrounded by all or at least most of the name and titles on the obverse. He suggested that the change was mediated by coins with portraits and names on both sides which occur for the Ptolemies and the triumvirs. TARN, Journal of Roman Studies XXI (1931) 179-183, thought that the coinage of Augustus after Actium deliberately recalled the defeat of Ptolemy II by Antigonus, as a victory of west over east.

CARY, CAH IX 386, compared the inflation by decreasing the weight of the copper drachma under Philometor, T. REINACH Rev. des Etudes grecques XLI (1928) 178, with similar practices under the Caesars. But all these may be rather parallels than precedents. 144 The literature on the Res Gestae is extensive. The discussions are summarized by J. GAGE in the preface to his edition (Paris 1935). For the elogia cf. id. 28, with reference to H. DESSAU "Mommsen und das Mon. Anc." Klio XXII (1928) 261-283. were perhaps composed by Ennius.45 They may well, therefore, constitute another instance of Hellenis- tic fashions which the family of the Scipios intro- duced to Rome. But their severe and factual style is Roman, in contrast to the economy and grace of the Greek epigram, which characterizes its subject by presenting only the most essential traits or deeds. The Res Gestae, however, differ markedly in length and treatment from the elogia and, probably, from the funeral orations which may or may not have resembled the elogia.146 Augustus' memorial is factual and severe, but it is long and autobiographical; the author speaks in his own person. Autobiographical records are mentioned as having been set up by living Romans during the later republic.147 But Kornemann and others have justly remarked that the true antecedents are to be found in the records of their achievements left by oriental monarchs and their Hellenistic successors.148 The Mausoleum of Augustus itself, in so far as it was a family tumulus, derived from the Etruscan and republican grave mound. At the same time, its splendor and its character as primarily a monument of an individual recall the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, the Pyramids, and like royal sepulchres. Kornemann justly con- cluded his discussion of the tomb and the Res Gestae: "Wie fast alles, was Augustus geschaffen hat, zeigen auch das Mausoleum und der Tatenbericht ein Doppelgesicht, ein italienisches und ein hellenis- tisches".149 It has already been remarked that Caesar probably intended to make his position hereditary and that Augustus claimed this inheritance in virtue of his adoption in Caesar's will.150 He underlined the very special nature of this inheritance by calling himself not Gai f. but Divi f., the son of the deified person, the only one of recent times.'51 Inheritance played an important part in Roman history and law from the beginning, but in the early history, as in the early law, it was the continuance of the family from genera- tion to generation rather than the descent from 145 CIL ed. 2 I 2 1 pp. 373-383.

C. was a contributing factor, if not the primary cause, in the breakdown of the family solidarity and in the emancipa- tion of the individual.154 The part played by the Scipios during the second century represents the changing emphasis. The fact that they were Cornelii was important, but the personal prestige of Africanus equally promoted the fortunes of his descendants. Moreover, the ability of Africanus and of Aemilianus brought them to the fore while the intervening generation remained relatively insignificant.'55 During the last century of the republic, the influence which relationship to a great individual exerted on the public appears in the success achieved by such pretenders as the false sons of Gaius Gracchus and of Marius.'56 This shift of attitude, which made Caesar's mantle more valuable to Augustus than membership in the Julian or Octavian families, cannot be called Hellenistic, but at least it was unroman and it derived in a considerable measure from the changed character of the population of Rome, from its cosmopolitan, not to say oriental, composition.157 152 Neither Greek nor Roman law recognized any special rights of the oldest sons, E.

In the early rural community, where the population had been homogeneous and relatively permanent, the prestige of families carried great weight. In a great metropolis, with a shifting, selfish proletariat, the personality of the demagogue or the general counted for more than an ancient and distinguished lineage.+'8 Augustus must also have been4 influenced in his wish to make his position actually, if not legally, hereditary by the lessons of Greek history. These taught that the perpetuation of efficient government was more likely when it centered about a hereditary position than when it depended upon repeated elective changes. Augustus did not intend to found a monarchy but he did wish to introduce into the machinery of the Roman state an officer who would be in a position to control its working and to prevent the evils which had developed under the later republic. He realized that a successor would step into his shoes with less risk of rivalry among the nobility and more prospect of favor among the lower classes and the army if such a successor came as his choice and descendant.'59 The introduction of the heredity principle into the Roman constitution was therefore an innovation at least strongly influenced by Hellenis- tic precedents.'60 The Hellenistic monarchies also afforded examples of the bestowal upon the heir of special superior commands and of his elevation to what the Germans call "Mitregentschaft''. 61 Both of 158 Naturally, the prestige of the old families continued to count, both socially and politically, and Augustus sought to strengthen it, cf. the summary of various articles on nobilitas during the empire in HAMMOND "Pliny the Younger's Views on Government" Harvard Studies in Class.

Of course, Augustus was influenced by other factors besides the Hellenistic precedents, HAMMOND 77-78. 161 KAERST, 343, and BIKERMAN, 21-24, did not think that association in the Seleucid kingdom ever meant coequality. BOUCHE1-LECLERCQJ Lag. III 96, described two instances of Ptolemaic association as almost equivalent to the abdication of the fathers. KORNEMANN, in his Doppel- prinzipat und Reichsteilung im Imperium Romanum (Leipzig/ Berlin 1930) 51, felt that Gaius, under the influence of Hellenistic ideas inherited from his great-grandfather Antony, sought to change the Roman principate to a Hellenistic monarchy shared between a flaat2evs and a /JabitAaaa. Throughout this study, KORNEMANN overemphasized the constitutional importance of the empresses, but undoubtedly Hellenistic monarchical ideas exercised a steadily increasing influence upon the concept of the imperial position as this existed both in the minds of the rulers and in those of the subjects. In the same work, 73-74, KORNEMANN cited</page><page sequence="16">16 MASON HAMMOND these methods were employed by Augustus to ensure as far as possibte that those whom he selected would be in a position to succeed him.62 Though Tiberius sought himself to discount his hereditary claim to the principate, even he came more and more to realize that the principate was a necessity and that its perpetuation depended in part on making it hered- itary.163 The great development of the imperial administra- tion took place after Augustus, notably under Claudius.'64 But the constituent elements of the administration can in a large measure be traced back to Augustus and even to the later republic.'65 They may for the purposes of discussion be divided into two parts, the "office staff" and the "field staff". The former may moreover be subdivided into two, the "court" and the "bureaucracy". Under Augustus, the entourage of the emperor, the court, was very informal and differed little from the group which had surrounded the prominent nobles of the later republic. The keynote of Augustus' life was sim- plicity; he tried as far as possible to remain on terms of equality with the senators and magistrates and to be accessible to all.'66 Nevertheless, the term amicus appears very early under the Julio-Claudians in a manner which suggests that it already had a semi- official meaning. Augustus referred to the proconsul of Asia, Asinius Gallus, as I3 qpw in a letter to the free city of Cnidus.67 This case taken alone might be considered a delicate way of avoiding any the position occupied by successors to the throne under Flavians and Antonines as an intrusion of the Hellenistic idea of the association of a son with his father as consors successorque. 162 HAMMOND 69-73.

CAH VII 201-202 (Macedon). But BIKERMAN, 8-11, doubted this theory and regarded the power as secured by force, 14-15, and perpetuated by bequest, 16. 164 HIRSCHFELD 474-475; CAH X 686-690. 185 VON PREMERSTEIN 175. 166 SUET.

But the continuous appearance of the terms cptAog = amicus in a quasi-official sense makes the Hellenistic influence on the Roman practice appear very probable.176 It has been maintained that the praetorian guard, which began under Scipio Aemilianus at Numantia, derived from the cohors amicorum, which he organized as a bodyguard in place of the unreliable noble equites.177 The guard may, however, have been a development of one of the special corps of veterans, evocati, who as early as the time of Scipio Africanus often re'enlisted under favored terms of service.178 Whatever its origin, the connection of the guard with the Scipios lends color to a hypothesis of Hellenistic influence. At first sight, such a hypothesis receives support from the occurrence in the Hellenistic courts of &amp;opasroVAaxPg. Unfortunately, this name is often applied to persons who performed quite important functions. Hence it is likely that though in the early period the aouaropvpcoasg constituted an actual body- guard, perhaps of important and trustworthy associates of the king like the Roman cohors amicorum, they came to be employed for special duties and eventually the title became an honor for functionaries close to the king.179 Various bodies of troops are mentioned which acted as body-guards to the king: the tvaiQot, 178 CICCOTTI, DE I 448, doubted the connection; VON PREMERSTEIN, 224, accepted it; see his n. 1 for further references for the Hellenistic usage; BANG, FRIEDLANDER IV 58, showed that the Romans themselves recognized the connection. 77 CICCOTTI, DE I 447; OEHLER, PW IV(7) 356-357, placed the development froin the cohors amicorum after Philippi.

On p. 71, DURRY accepted the connection between the cohors amicorum and the republican cohors praetoria and hesitated between the two Scipios as the originator. But on p. 74, he argued that the Augustan guard was only a collateral descendant of the various bodies which the title cohors praetoria covered during the republic and actually originated in the special bodyguards created by various commanders during the period of the triumvirate. PASSERINI, 3-10, maintained that Scipio Africanus probably created the regular bodyguard, which, 20-29, took its name from an older informal cohors praetoria or entourage. Then this latter came to be called cohors amicorum. 178 KROMAYER-VEITH etc. Heerwesen und Kriegs- fuhrung etc. (Handbuch derAlt-wiss. IV 3 2, Munchen 1928) 31 1. '79 BOUCHE-LECLERCQ Lag.

In the Hellenistic courts, the sons of noble Macedonian families received a semi-military educa- tion and formed a regular group, the ca6tAXxoz Ua!E. 182 Their organization may have been patterned on the training established in various Greek city-states, notably in Athens during and after the fourth century before Christ, for the 'Aypot, youths of an age between boyhood and manhood.'83 Even before the establish- ment of the Roman empire, Pompeii, and perhaps other Italian towns, had similar institutions.184 That at Pompeii bore at first the Oscan name Vereiia but its inspiration may nevertheless have been Greek.185 Della Corte thought that the presence of a goddess Iuventas in Rome at an early date was evidence for an organization of iuvenes to worship her.'86 But she was simply a personified abstraction, the patroness of coming-of-age, like such figures as Febris. The early existence of a goddess "Fever" scarcely proves that the sufferers from malaria had any formal organization.'87 A passage in Cicero gives very slight support for an organized body of youths even at the end of the republic.'88 Augustus, however, fostered an organization, thenceforth called Iuventus, whether or not he found it already existing at Rome and whatever its connection with the bodies in the Hellenized towns.89 At Rome it comprised the sons 180 Besides the above references, cf.

It provided a training in part military and in part scholastic from their coming of age at fifteen to the beginning of their military service at seventeen or later. Augustus sought, perhaps, through Virgil to connect the Iuventus with Aeneas and the mythological beginnings of Rome.190 But he appears really to have had in mind either the yqipot or the Pa6tIzAco xalo&amp;.191 Bodies of iuvenes existed in many, if not all, Italian towns under the empire and undoubtedly where Augustus found none, he created them. The Iuventus outside of Rome had much less of a military color and concerned itself chiefly with education and gymnastics.192 Nero attempted to Hellenize the institution even further by converting the Roman Juventus into a personal body-guard, like the Pa6jtcoj Zald. ,193 In the Hellenistic courts, certain noble boys and foreign princes were at a fairly early age made companions of the princes and brought up with them.194 These V'VOTOLPOt may have been specially favored members of the P?a6tItol zarFg Though the practice cannot be proved for the household of Augustus, Antonia, widow of Drusus, brought up "Herod" Agrippa I with her children and his friend- ship with Claudius stood them both in good stead later.195 Tacitus affords a clearer instance under Nero when he says in connection with the poisoning of Britannicus. mos habebatur principum liberos cum ceteris idem aetatis nobilibus sedentis vesci in aspectu 189 The name occurs only after the founding of the empire, DELLA CORTE Iuventus 5-7; ROSTOVTZEFF BIei- tesserae 63-65, 71; DS III 1 784.

But the mention under Claudius of the pueris puellisque nobilibus indicates that in the Hellenistic manner, special children were selected as playmates for the princes.199 It may be that the idea was not Augustan but inherited by Claudius from his mother, the daughter of Marc Antony. In general, the court of the Roman emperor had from the be- ginning a Hellenistic coloring and became more, rather than less, monarchical during the Julio- Claudian period. The bureaucracy developed from the business staffs of the rich nobles of the later republic.200 During the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius the few freedmen secretaries who are known were little more than clerks in the imperial household.20' But the lines of the bureaucracy were already established; and since almost all the freedmen, as well as many of the knights and even senators, in the imperial service were of eastern origin, they presumably applied Greek business methods in the service of their Roman masters.202 The Hellenistic monarchs had employed agents of higher social standing than freedmen but they too had simply expanded their households to cope with the administration of their kingdoms.203 The demarca- tion of functions at Rome resembles that in the east.

Without entering into the history of the fiscus, it may at least be said that the confusion therein of the accounting of the public and private funds which the emperor controlled, if not of the funds themselves, had good precedent in the Hellenistic monarchies, where all the revenues were regarded as the property of the crown.205 The Hellenistic monarchs probably did not have to preserve public state treasuries as Augustus did in the case of the aerarium.206 The internal organization of the Roman chancery is not known, but if Wilcken's explanation of the offices a libellis and ab epislulis be accepted, his distinction between petitions handed in at Rome and simply annotated by the emperor and those sent in and replied to by letter can be paralleled from Bikerman's analysis of the Seleucid chancery, in which he drew the same distinction between iztarro,l' and 0?o,uvfi,uoctlyos.207 LECLERCQ Sel.

BIKER- MAN, 193-194, subdivided britao2at into orders to a specific person, npoardfpaara, and circular orders, the Ptolemaic rvToAai, terms which recall the Roman mandata and edicta. Even under Augustus the bureaucracy had some responsibility to the state since at his death he left the names of his freedmen, not of his heirs, as those from whom an accounting might be demanded for the public moneys entrusted to him.208 Claudius brought the freedmen so much to the fore that when Pallas retired early in Nero's reign, it was to the state and not to the emperor personally that he refused an accounting.209 In consequence of this change from a household staff to a public one, the freedmen began to be replaced by knights during the Flavian period and Hadrian made the reform general.210 Thus in the second century the imperial bureaucracy resembled the Hellenistic not only in functions and organization but even in social status. Besides the court and the bureaucracy, Augustus developed what was called above a "field staff" for the administration of Rome and the provinces. The republican machinery continued to govern Rome, Italy, and the senatorial provinces. In Rome, Augustus supplemented it by creating a number of new boards and posts for which it is hard to draw a distinction between additions to the old republican organization and intrusions of new imperial functionaries.211 Those, however, which were most clearly imperial were borrowed from the urban administration of the Hellenistic monarchies, especially from that of Alexandria.212 An instance commonly cited is the Roman praefect of the Watch and his vigiles, a police and fire department, who were copied from the Alexan- drian vvxrc9tvo6g orocr1iy6 with his vvxro(aoaEs.213 208 SUET.

(above n. 177) 17, cited as republican precedents for the vigiles the slaves of the tresviri nocturni and quinqueviri cis Tiberim. Augustus' first attempt to provide proper fire protection consisted in placing six hundred slavies under the aediles. In 7 B. C. he transferred them to the magistri vicorum whom he had just established. Only thereafter did he establish a separate praefectus vigilum with seven cohorts of freedmen organized in a military fashion. In this, as in other departments of the public services, Augustus apparently began by trying to bring republican institutions up to date. Only when these proved inadequate did he adopt more wholeheartedly new (Hellenistic ?) schemes. 214 STRABO XVII 1 12 (p. 797); the four were the 1yi7rqg, bnopvuaroyedpog, &amp;wdixaosig, and vvx.eeQtv6g ?ea- Nqy6S.; cf.

D. 64. The colonnaded streets which formed part of his plan may have been Italian in origin, but they suggest the Hellenistic stoa.221 Rome of the empire must have owed much of its appearance, orderliness, safety, and administra- tion to the experience of the great Hellenistic cities.222 Outside of Rome, the imperial administration may be divided into the financial and the military. The financial agents, or procurators, were originally simply personal agents of the emperor, like the freedmen, but besides managing his properties they undertook from the beginning the collection of the taxes due to the imperial treasury, the fiscus, and were active in the senatorial as well as in the imperial provinces.223 Though Kornemann thought that Augustus followed 219 PLATNER-ASHBY 227, though on 225 they accept APPIAN as evidence for the Persian influence; VON GER- KAN 103, 136-137, 144J cf.

Mitteis instanced a number of taxes, such as the centesima rerum venalium and possibly the vicesima hereditatum, for which Ptolemaic antecedents can be found.227 It may also be that the tributum capitis, if originated by Augustus, derived from the Hellenistic head- tax.228 On the occasion of imperial accessions or triumphs a special levy was made, called aurum coronarium. This represented a commutation into money of the gold crowns offered to Hellenistic kings, a commutation which had already been made by them.229 The portoria, port dues, may also have been continued by the Romans from their prede- cessors.230 With respect to the collection of taxes, the republic used either collection by the local communi- ties, as in Sicily under the lex Hieronica, or by private companies of "tax-farmers", the method applied by 224 124-127. 225 PW VI(11) 301-306 under equites Romani; HIRSCH- FELD 417-423. 220 BELOCH 388-389; CAH VII 166 (Seleucids); BIKERMAN 128. 227 P-recht I 17 n. 48, R-u-V-recht 9 n. 2.

Gaius Gracchus to Asia.23' Rostovtzeff thought that since collection by private persons under contract appeared early at Rome, it represented a universal phenomenon of the city-state.232 But the two methods suggest those in use in Egypt and Syria respectively. The Ptolemies applied a modified system of farming combined with local State banks, whereas the Seleucids let the communities collect and deposit directly into government treasuries.233 Mitteis traced to Egypt some of the regulations of the fiscus, such as its right of confiscation and the rule that the purchaser of anything from it acquired full property rights.234 In fact, as has been said, the general character of the fiscus seems Hellenistic.235 The survey of the empire which Augustus initiated for financial, not military, purposes also recalls the precise records of property kept by the Ptolemies.236 Two chief elements in the later financial system, forced labor and the colonate, or tenant, method of cultivation, are eastern in origin.237 But since they did not attain great impor- tance under Augustus, their complicated history need not be discussed here.238 Augustus established, however, a system of couriers for official mail and laid upon communities along the road the obligation to provide transportation and upon individuals to assist the couriers if necessary.239 Similar postal 231 In the early republic, of course, some taxes may have been paid indirectly by the individual.

C., the more pacified provinces of the empire continued under the control of the senate, which sent out ex-praetors and ex-consuls as it had during the republic.24' Augustus took over those provinces which demanded the presence of troops or which served as bases for the armies on the frontiers.242 To govern them, he adopted a method devised for Pompey, that of delegating his power to legates.243 Such delegation was wholly inconsistent with the Roman tradition that substitution was possible only when a pro-magistrate vacated his powers, either by leaving his province or through death.244 The imperial legates, who combined civil and militarv functions and who were selected by and responsible only to their superior, the emperor, are analogous to the governors of provinces in the Seleucid empire.245 Under the republic several provinces had from time to time been combined into single commands when the military situation required it, but Augustus confined such large commands, with the extended powers which they necessitated, to members of his own family and especially to such as he marked out in other ways as heirs to his position.246 The position of such favored persons recalls that which was sometimes bestowed on the princes of the Seleucid house.247 Moreover, the procurators, to whom reference has already been made, were inde- pendent both of the senatorial proconsuls and of the imperial legates.248 Similarly, in the Seleucid empire, 240 DS I 2 1646; HIRSCHFELD 190 n. 2; BELOCH 281-282, especially n. 2; MITTEIS-WILCKEN Grund- zuge I 2 372-374; W.

The senatorial proconsuls had, of course, their own financial assistants, the quaestors, who wiere in fact responsible to them though they rendered their the financial agents in each satrapy were at least semi-independent of the governor.249 In both cases, the obvious reason suggests itself, that the one official was meant to keep check upon the other. Other regulations recall those of the Diadochi. The policy of leaving to many of the Greek cities a considerable degree of self-government, libertas, which might or might not be combined with immunitas, freedom from taxation, may have been taken over under the republic from the Hellenistic monarchies.250 It continued under the empire.251 The successors of Alexander based their power on their Macedonian and Greek troops and gave up his dream of equalizing the races.252 The privileged position which the Hellenic population in consequence enjoyed resembles that which Augustus ensured for Roman citizens, probably against the more cosmopolitan ideals of Caesar.253 Augustus realized that not only his victory at Actium but the whole success of his compromise between city-state and empire depended upon the good-will and co-operation of the Romano-Italian population and that their preeminence, established by two centuries of victorious expansion, was not un- acceptable to the rest of the empire.254 Augustus perhaps really desired to foster a certain amount of provincial self-government and respon- sibility, over and above that of the municipalities, when he established the provincial concilia.255 These belonged in the tradition of the Greek east, where assemblies of kindred communities went back to the Ionian zotvov of the seventh or sixth century B. C.256 Such zotvac, though primarily religious in purpose, had some political importance.257 Augustus gave to accounts to the aerarium, MOM. II 1 561-565; HIRSCH- FELD 468.

It also provided an outlet for surplus popula- tion. By the end of the second century B. C., however, the urban proletariat preferred the attractions of Rome to the hardships of rustic life and did not respond to the resettlement program of the Gracchi.263 In the last century of the republic, colonization, whether man by man in individual allotments or as communities, was chiefly used to reward the veterans of an army which had become professionalized. Augustus began by pursuing the same policy of making land grants to his veterans, either separately or in colonies.264 But he did locate certain of his provincial colonies with an eye to strategic considera- tions.265 In this it is likely that he was not reviving the original Roman idea but copying the Hellenistic monarchs.266 They too had used colonization as a 258 CAH X 210. 259 PW suppi.

The Ptolemies means of satisfying veterans and also of securing commercial or military advantages. 267 Though Augustus substituted a money bonus for land between 13 B. C. and A. D. 6, veteran settlements continued to be established occasionally in Italy and frequently in the provinces.268 From the time of Pompey, these communities often took the name of their founder, as had the foundations of the Hellenistic monarchs.269 The foregoing treatment cannot claim to have exhausted the possible similarities between the administrative policies of the Hellenistic monarchies and of the Roman empire.270 It has, admittedly, "made a case" by emphasizing the likenesses as evidence for direct influence and by neglecting many important differences. Much that has been adduced might be regarded as accidental parallelism or as illustrating the degree to which like problems produce like solutions. Nevertheless, the resemblances occur in such varied aspects of the organization of the empire that they point to something more than the operation of chance. Since in certain fields, like emperor- worship and the court, the evidence for Hellenistic influence may be regarded as conclusive, it is reason- able to explain the other likenesses also by conscious imitation. One of the series of conferences held at Harvard University in connection with its tercentenary was entitled "Independence, Convergence, and Borrowing in Institutions, Thought, and Art."271 The majority of the speakers regarded borrowing as were not concerned with self-governing communities, TARN 156-157; CAH VII 122. 267BIKERMAN 78-88; BELOCH 251-267; CAH VII 117-118, 171, VIII 595-596, 603; L'Hell4nisation 285; TARN 130-138, who, 135, noted the influence on Rome, Greeks in Bactria etc. (above n. 173) 5-12. 268 For the change 13 B.

The present discussion has also been inspired by the feeling that in the history of mankind, and especially of institutions, continuity plays the largest part. Tarn justly concluded that "the real heir of the Hellenistic kings was Augustus; for, though his principate was in form Roman and not Hellenistic, his empire was joined by many threads to the Macedonian kinadoms".272 To say, however, that Augustus learned much from the experience of the Hellenistic monarchs is not to argue that he meant his wnole program to be monarchical or that his declared purpose of restoring the republic was hypocritical. To a certain extent the question whether Augustus meant to be a monarch depends on the meaning of the word. He left no written constitution which would have defined precisely his relation to the state. In virtue either of specific powers or, what is more important, of the willingness of others to accept his leadership, he controlled the government. To this extent he was de facto a monarch. But his position differed in important respects from that of the Hellenistic monarchs. Though their power was undefined and unlimited, it was unitary; the kingship was a whole, inseparable from the person of the king and deriving from no outside source save the force of arms or the will of a predecessor.273 All government proceeded from the person of the king.274 Augustus established no single position of emperor. Though his authority was all-pervasive, he acted in virtue of a variety of offices and powers which were distinct from his person and which might at any timne have been alienated or ended without causing the state to cease. These powers he received from bodies independent of and anterior to himself, the senate and people, who exercised the ultimate sovereignty of the state, a 27. 72. 273 Cf. above nn. 160 (inheritance), 163 (force). 274 CAH VII 119; TARN 54; BIKERMAN 185-190. Of course, the Roman government depended greatly on Atugustus alone and this dependence on the emperor increased, cf. the details which Pliny referred to Trajan. sovereignty which they did not surrender to him. He was constitutionally their creature and agent, not their master. He was not even, in modern terminology, a constitutional monarch. But by the second century his successors had become emperors, in the ordinary sense of the term, because the separate elements which Augustus had combined in his person coagulated into a single position or office which could be conceived of as existing inde- pendently of an individual and subject to trans- mission and definition like a modern kingship.275 The willingness of others to accept his leadership and the constitutional nature of his position are not as significant in determining whether Augustus created a monarchy as is his own intention. The majority of modern scholars have maintained that Augustus wished to be in reality the sole master of the state behind a fiction of the restored republic.276 The present writer has argued on the contrary that he was sincere in ree'stablishing the old constitution and in grafting onto it an extraordinary executive magis- trate as its agent, not its master.277 According to him, the principate became a monarchy not because Augustus imposed his will upon the other organs, but because the rest of the state demanded the extension of his authority. One of the arguments for such an interpretation of the principate is that Augustus modelled himself on the ideals of Cicero, the Stoics, and Plato. If the present discussion has shown that he borrowed freely from Hellenistic and Greek institutions, then the probability that he was also influenced by Hellenistic and Greek thought is heightened and the essential unity of the Graeco- Roman civilization is reaffirmed. 27I Even when the concept of a single imperial position had developed, its -arious original components were still distinguished, cf. the lex de imperio Vespasiani, BRUNS Fontes 202 no. 56, anld such accounts of the accession of emperors during the second century as DIO LXXIII (LXXIV) 5 = SHA Pertinax 4 5 -5 7. 27S For example, CHARLESWORTH CAH X 589-590; VONPREMERSTEINthroughout; CARCOPINO 153-155. 277 In his Augustan Principate; cf.
