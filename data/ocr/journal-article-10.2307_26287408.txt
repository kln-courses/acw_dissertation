<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yves Bonnefoy: Art Historian Adelia V. Williams The first who likened painting and poetry to each other must have been a man of delicate perception, who found that both arts affected him in a similar manner. Both, he realised, present to us appearance as reality, absent things as present.1 G. E. Lessing, Laocoon AMONG RECENT CRITICAL TRENDS is the interartistic ap proach which has set out to consider relationships among the arts. Within nineteenth- and twentieth-century French studies, this critical stance has been directed toward "poésie critique,"2 a general term for the art writings of modern literary figures. However, even the most cursory review of "poésie critique" reveals a wide variety of endeavors which demonstrates both the richness and the vagueness of the tradition.3 It is clear, however, if only from the sheer number of "poésie critique" volumes, that painting has figured prominently in the minds of modern French poets, novelists and thinkers.4 Literary critics and scholars have endeavored to address the motives that have driven these creative minds to formulate a poetic vision in formed by the visual arts. Yet, there is no consensus as to the significance of "poésie critique," whether, for example, it is a literary genre or, in fact, a sound contribution to the discipline of art history. Art historian Norman Bryson's Calligram: Essays in New Art His tory from France' raises these very issues, in tne collection ot eleven essays, major French figures, including Julia Kristeva, Jean Baudrillard, Louis Marin, Michel Foucault, and Roland Barthes, and who represent such diverse fields as linguistics, semiotics, philosophy, science, and lit erature, apply their expertise to art history. In his introduction, Bryson discusses how French writers and thinkers outside the field of the visual arts perceive and interpret art. He concludes that it is precisely its rich interdisciplinarity that gives contemporary art criticism in France a dynamic and singular status in the world today. Yves Bonnefoy's "Time and the Timeless in Quattrocento Paint ing," a translation of "Le temps et l'intemporel" from L'improbable, a 1959 collection of art historical writings, is the volume's second essay.6 Here, Bonnefoy considers Italian Renaissance perspective, the pictorial 34 Fall 1996</page><page sequence="2">Williams depiction of spatial dimension. Because the laws of perspective endeavor to express an anthropomorphic conception of temporality, namely human mortality, Bonnefoy argues that beginning with the Quattro cento, time is rendered visible in painting. By arriving at his conclusion, Bonnefoy implicitly posits his argument against Lessing's Laocoon (1766). In Laocoon, Lessing delineates the boundaries between poetry and painting. Each art form adheres to sep arate, hence intrinsically incompatible, dimensions. Literary expression belongs to the temporal sphere; plastic expression inheres in the spatial. Bonnefoy, however, points out the limitations of Lessing's distinction between painting and poetry when he writes of the temporal complexity of painting in "Time and the Timeless": Painting contains time in several ways. First, through the process by which a painting . . . recreates itself within us. Our aware ness of a work of art evolves in time. . .. Accordingly, in our apprenticeship of the work we go back and forth between separation and union, passivity and attentiveness, or waking and dreaming, until we achieve the improbable total experience. ... A study should be made of this period of time in which we draw nearer to the work, and also of the depth it explores—a depth of reading where one goes from sign to sign. . . . But my concern is not this semantic space. ... I should like to attend to another time. . . . The act of reading the work . . . has led us outside time.7 Bonnefoy's interpretation of the Quattrocento is a first indication that his critical perspective, while rooted in solid art history, ventures into an abstract, indeed literary, domain.8 Bonnefoy's 1972 L'arrière-pays traces the same period of art history as "Time and the Timeless," but reaches beyond the closed world of Florentine Renaissance painting, which seeks to reproduce appearance with static forms, to Bellini's more successful efforts, and finally to the ultimate application of perspective in Poussin's Roman landscapes. A poetic and personal meditation on the history of art, L'arrière-pays dis closes the breadth of Bonnefoy's understanding of art history, while demonstrating his ability to express this erudition in poetic and meta phoric language. Illustrated primarily with reproductions of sixteenth- and seven teenth-century Italian and French paintings, especially landscapes, the volume evokes the Florentine Renaissance and Roman baroque. These images inhabit a spatial, temporal dimension, whether the physical and metaphysical space it occupies, or the elusive arrière-pays construed by VOL. XXXVI, NO. 3 35</page><page sequence="3">L'Esprit Créateur Bonnefoy as a neo-mythical dream space. In Entretiens sur la poésie of 1981 Bonnefoy states: Les images, c'est bien sûr ce qui apparaît dans la rêverie. . . . Mais c'est aussi le cadre, la page, la fixité du tracé, tout ce qui semble faire de la vision fugitive un fait malgré tout, un fait relevant d'un autre lieu que celui de notre vie, en témoignant même peut-être de l'exis tence d'un autre monde.' The baroque ultimately eclipses the Renaissance in L'arrière-pays, by satisfying Bonnefoy's dream of an art embodying true Presence. In the final pages of L'arrière-pays the reader encounters Nicolas Poussin who, inspired by the sight of Roman laundresses as he walks along the Tiber, will paint his capital Finding of Moses series. The Rome elicited here, belonging to both an ancient and modern age, is the point of departure for Rome 1630,10 a scholarly study of baroque art and architecture. Revealed as the theater of Presence, the city is dominated by Borromini, Bernini, and Poussin, the three figures most responsible for Rome's renewal. Together, the three personalities embody the very tension inher ent in the baroque. By situating Poussin within this trio in a baroque spectacle, Bonnefoy draws an implicit parallel between Poussin's images and the three-dimen sional arts of sculpture and architecture which, as he said elsewhere, better signify Presence because they occupy space more completely than painting." Though generally considered the greatest exponent of French neo-classicism in painting, for Bonnefoy, on the contrary, Poussin is the most baroque of all, primarily because of his link with the eternal city. Poussin's canvases betray a precise intellectual orientation and reasoning that is Cartesian yet lyrical, bound to Renaissance perspective, yet free from its technical constraints. It is Poussin's masterful and austere abili ty to impart the cosa mentale on canvas that so appeals to the poet in search of a true place for the transitory and the unattainable. In Rome 1630, Bonnefoy claims that the baroque aims to construct a place, the "true place," for divine being. It manifests itself as a gesture in a perpetual state of flux between Presence and representation, with out, however, identifying itself as either. The baroque is defined within this paradoxical movement. By its excess it can signify divinity, and yet, this profuseness and exuberance betrays itself as an illusion. Bernini's Baldaquin of 1624-33 is, for Bonnefoy, the quintessential baroque work. Immense, yet ostensibly weightless, its scale creates a con tradiction beneath Michelangelo's cupola, the perfect expression of 36 Fall 1996</page><page sequence="4">Williams infinite expression, and as much the embodiment of Renaissance Neo Platonism and metaphysics as the Baldaquin is the materialization of seventeenth-century theology and ideology. Instead of pursuing the Renaissance ideal of perfect form and consummate beauty, Bernini's project consists in seeking true form in evanescence, instability, and metamorphosis. This ideological transformation is made possible through technical innovation because Bernini triumphed over Renais sance conflict between horizontals and verticals by employing hybrid and dynamic forms: spirals, diagonals, ovals, convex and concave configura tions. Bonnefoy asserts that the Baldaquin best exemplifies the meeting of the hie et nunc, the point in which appearance and being meet in an image of Presence. Bonnefoy's remark that baroque art expresses Presence negatively, from an external point of view, that is to say, by its very absence,12 is especially meaningful when considering his overwhelming interest in Alberto Giacometti, whose minimalism might appear to be antithetical to baroque superfluity. Yet Bonnefoy will say, "The essence of Giaco metti's art is this fall of presence into absence."13 And when discussing Giacometti's 1934-35 sculpture Invisible Object,14 he articulates the miss ing object in similar terms, viewing it as the very presence which defines this most enigmatic figure, regarded by Bonnefoy as the magnum opus of Giacometti's Surrealist period. Alberto Giacometti surely holds the preeminent position in Bonne foy's gallery of modern artists. His monumental 1991 study of the sculp tor, 15 nearly a catalogue raisonné, is a remarkable tribute to the great Swiss artist. Employing a psychocritical approach, Bonnefoy places tremendous emphasis on the symbolic, epiphanic value of events, ob jects, dreams, obsessions, fantasies, places, and people in Giacometti's quasi-mythical life story. As an iconoclastic art student at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, for example, Giacometti insisted on drawing only the foot of a nude model: a deliberate act that reveals the sculptor's lifelong obsession with the mystery of being beneath appearance. Giacometti joined the Surrealists to engage in one of the most active and provocative periods of his career, which culminated in the enigmatic Invisible Object. After its completion, the sculptor began to devote him self to a more formal approach to sculpture by studying the human head from life. This deliberateness, at variance with the Surrealists' automa tism, signals Giacometti's break with the group. At this pivotal juncture, the sculptor will turn his attention toward the theme of the void of the Vol. XXXVI, No. 3 37</page><page sequence="5">L'Esprit Créateur human condition, a move which is tantamount, for Bonnefoy, to a return along, "les voies, obstruées dans l'art des siècles récents, d'une poétique de la Présence.'"6 Like Bonnefoy, Giacometti eventually broke with the Surrealists in order to return to his original metaphysical search for Presence by work ing from a model, rather than drawing from unconscious images and impulses. In Giacometti, Bonnefoy recognizes a parallel with his own objectives in poetry: to restore Presence in art. Giacometti is alone, claims Bonnefoy, in perpetual and characteristic exile, trying "to give a visible form to Presence or to Being, which are beyond any visible aspects.'"7 This "poetics of Presence" becomes the sine qua non of Bonnefoy's wide ranging interests in art, from the romanesque to the contemporary period. Because Bonnefoy senses in modern art "un déclin progressif de la "Présence,"18 when writing about twentieth-century artists, the poet seeks a continuation of the great traditions of Byzantium, the Florentine Renaissance and the Roman Baroque. Among the moderns, Bonnefoy writes admiringly of the figurative artists Giorgio de Chirico, Balthasar Balthus, Raoul Ubac, Edward Hopper, and Joan Mirö. Among contem poraries, Bonnefoy has written on realist sculptor Raymond Mason, artist Miklos Bokor, colorist Claude Garache, and landscape painter Nasser Assar. In painting, the landscape tradition initiated by Poussin holds the highest place in Bonnefoy's hierarchy of genres. He maintains, for instance, that because the Cubists did not pursue landscape painting, their images are not an evocation of true Presence. Mondrian's early landscape Red Cloud (1908-09), a recurring Bonnefoy image, stirs in the poet a sense of divine Presence. Importantly, this "arrière-pays" does not at all typify the artist's later signature Neo-plastic, grid-derived style. In the 1962 article "Dualité de l'art aujourd'hui," Bonnefoy outlines his perceptions of contemporary art by dividing modern art into two movements: Surrealist and abstract. And though Bonnefoy discerns more possibilities in Surrealism than in abstraction, in their common efforts to depict the purely physical object devoid of higher attributes, both arts share in an ultimately self-defeating endeavor. One exception is Joan Miro, whose objects are not gratuitous or empty signs, devoid of linguistic meaning. When evoking objects, Mirö transcends purely formal concerns by naming them. Bonnefoy elaborates, "il ne les décrit 38 Fall 1996</page><page sequence="6">Williams pas, il les nomme, et leur lieu est par conséquent insituable et illimité, ouvert, comme peut l'être un langage."19 Most striking about Bonnefoy's views on art, whether Renaissance, Baroque, or modern, is the preeminence of the ordering principles of language, perspective, and composition. Their unifying force brings a clarity and coherence to the visual image which did not exist in medieval and primitive artistic expression. In "Time and the Timeless" he writes: it was essential for time to become central to the most specific concerns of painting, and this through something as equivocal, ambiguous, and vulnerable as time itself. Perspective was to be the agent of this transformation. Misled by the notion that the main concern of perspective was to depict space, people have failed to emphasize its principal characteristic, which I would call conceptual.20 For Bonnefoy, perspective and composition are a monumental intellec tual advance in Western artistic representation because they bring a liter ary dimension to painting by implying a temporal, metaphysical quality. In his introduction to Calligram, Norman Bryson states: New Art History, at least as we see it in such . . . essays . . . by . . . Bonnefoy, not only invests far more in the basic act of interpretation: ... it assumes as sophisticated a level of interpretation as that achieved ... by current practice in literary theory. There is no reason for art history to feel this as a threat. ... On the contrary, all art history needs to do is appropriate the advance . . . and the discipline will be at once more stable, more mature, more nourishing than before.21 Indeed, Yves Bonnefoy's writings and thoughts on art, while betray ing the sensibility of a poet, remain outstanding examples of an art his tory that is as scholarly as it is nourishing and personal.
