<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 3Warriors and Weapons Until recently, our knowledge of pre-1750 northern  Plains Indian warriors’ armaments, accoutrements,  Late Prehistoric/ and tactics was limited to the recollections of Sahko- Protohistoric–Period Warfare maupee, the journals of Verendrye, and bits of data  in Bear Gulch Rock Art from fortified Middle Missouri villages and a few  northern Plains burials (Burpee 1927; Kendell, chap- ter 13, this volume; Lehmer 1971:107–128; McGinnis  James D. Keyser 1990; Owsley et al. 1977; Scheiber 2008; Thompson  1962; Wood 1976; Zimmerman and Bradley 1993;  Zimmerman and Whitten 1980). Yet, spanning a  period of about 300 years, from ad 1450 to 1750, the  northern Plains rock art record is replete with illus- trations of warriors, their equipment, and their battles  (Greer and Greer, chapter 2, this volume), and it is  from these that we are beginning to understand much  more about how and why these warriors fought one  another and with what they were armed. Northwestern Plains rock art scholars have been  interested in the shield-bearing and V-neck warrior  motifs (figure 3.1), as hallmarks of northwestern Plains  warrior art, for more than 50 years (Conner 1962a,  1962b, 1984; Conner and Conner 1971; Dewdney 1964;  Ewers 1975:399; Gebhard 1966; Keyser 1975, 1977a, 1984,  2004a; Keyser and Klassen 2001:191–221; Loendorf  1990, 2009; Loendorf and White 2010; Magne and  Klassen 1991; Mulloy 1958; Ray 2008). Frequently  shown with weapons, headdresses, heraldic shield  designs, and other battle accoutrements, these are the  DOI: 10.5876/9781607326700.c003 two most common motifs in the Ceremonial-tradition  66 </page> <page sequence="2"> Figure 3.1.

Surprisingly, however, as of yet only a few studies (Greer and Greer, chapter  2, this volume; Greer et al. 2010; Keyser 1979; Keyser et al. 2006; Loendorf  and Porsche 1985:78–85) have been oriented primarily toward elucidating what  rock art motifs and compositions are actually trying to tell us about how the  artists viewed warfare and why they participated in it. WARRIORS AND WEAPONS 67 </page> <page sequence="3"> Fortunately, recent recording of the Bear Gulch and Atherton Canyon rock  art sites in central Montana has allowed our research team to expand an initial  interest in this subject, and we find ourselves in the enviable position of having  sufficient quantity and detail of data about this particular period to provide  fodder for many such discussions. Although these have just recently begun (e.g.,  Kaiser et al. 2010; Keyser 2004b, 2006a, 2007a, 2008a, 2008b, 2010; Keyser and  Kaiser 2010; Keyser et al. 2012) additional research will likely continue for decades.  Coupled with renewed interest in the indications of warfare evidenced in Plains  skeletal populations (e.g., Gill and Weathermon 2008; Owsley and Bruwelheide  2008; Scheiber 2008) and the focus on warfare provided by the chapters in this  volume, these newly acquired Plains rock art data offer an unparalleled oppor- tunity to increase our understanding of the genesis and evolution of the Plains  warfare complex and many of its various components. This would come as wel- come news to those pioneering anthropologists who laid the groundwork for  the topic in the years before and just after World War II (Ewers 1975; Grinnell  1910; Lewis 1942; Mishkin 1940; Newcomb 1950; Secoy 1953; Smith 1938, 1951). the sItes Bear Gulch and Atherton Canyon (figure 3.2) are the two most extensive  Plains rock art site complexes yet discovered and recorded, containing, respec- tively, more than 5,000 and 1,000 distinct elements (Keyser et al. 2012). In  number of images and complexity both Bear Gulch and Atherton Canyon  are larger than any other single northwestern Plains rock art site and both  are nearly equal to or larger than rock art site complexes at Writing-on-Stone,  Verdigris Coulee, and the North Cave Hills, each of which contain from 10 to  50 individual sites (Keyser 1977b, 1984; Klassen 1995; Sundstrom 2004).1 The primary motif at both sites is the shield-bearing warrior, with 856  at Bear Gulch and 168 at Atherton Canyon. This total of 1,024 is more  than three times greater than all other known shield-bearing warriors so  far recorded on the northwestern Plains (Keyser 2006b).2 Of these 1,024  images, more than 960 are part of the formally defined Bear Gulch–style  shield-bearing warrior that represents a recognizable cultural type (Kaiser  et al. 2010). A handful of armed, rectilinear, or stick-figure humans without  shields are directly associated with these Bear Gulch–style shield-bearing  warriors and are included in this research. In addition to the Bear Gulch–style shield figures and associated humans,  nearly 30 V-neck humans and five unique shield-bearing warriors belonging to  an identifiable Blackfoot style (Keyser 2011; Keyser et al. 2012) are also drawn  68 JAMES D.

These are frequently armed and often depicted as engaged in  various war-related activities. Both sites also contain many freestanding weapons and shields, and when it  can reasonably be inferred that these war-related items are associated with the  other Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric imagery at the site, they are included  WARRIORS AND WEAPONS 69 </page> <page sequence="5"> in this discussion. The few scenes of horse-and-gun-period combat3 that occur  at both sites have been described and discussed in considerable detail else- where (Keyser 2006a; Keyser et al. 2011, 2012) and are included here only as  comparative material. All Bear Gulch–style shield-bearing warriors and the few associated  humans and most V-neck humans at these sites are relatively securely dated  to the last two centuries of the Late Prehistoric period (ad 1450–1650) and  the century-long Protohistoric period, which spans ad 1650 to 1750 (Keyser  et al. 2011, 2012). Dating evidence at these sites includes radiocarbon dates on  charcoal pictographs and a wooden stake associated with other rock art, radio- carbon-dated occupation levels at Bear Gulch, and information in the rock  art subject matter itself, such as the size of shields and the presence of metal  projectile points illustrated in the absence of horses and guns (Keyser 2010,  2011; Keyser and Kaiser 2010; Keyser et al. 2011). In addition, detailed superim- position sequences allow us to relatively date both particular styles and many  individual images within this 300-year span (Kaiser et al. 2010; Keyser et al.  2011, 2012). Essentially the evidence from these sites provides an almost ideal  data set for discussing warfare in the period immediately before the introduc- tion of the horse and gun into the northwestern Plains. WarrIor art and Warfare: bear  gulCh and atherton Canyon Warriors represented by shield bearers and V-neck humans at Bear Gulch  and Atherton Canyon provide a rich record for the study of arms and accou- trements, battle tactics, and the motives for warfare in the Late Prehistoric and  Protohistoric periods in Central Montana. In order to describe such a wealth  of information this discussion is divided into two major sections: “Arms and  Accoutrements” and “Battle Compositions and Tactics.” Then, using the clas- sic “direct historical approach” (e.g., Deetz 1965; Strong 1935; Wedel 1938, 1961;  Wood 1967, 1969) components of each of these are compared to the rich Plains  Indian ethnographic record of the horse-and-gun period to help construct a  summary of what warfare was like during the 300 years immediately preced- ing European contact with Plains Indian cultures. Arms and Accoutrements Warriors at these sites are well armed with detailed representations of five  basic weapons, and they wear a variety of headdresses, hairstyles, and face  70 JAMES D. KEYSER </page> <page sequence="6"> Figure 3.3. Bowmen at Bear Gulch (a, b, d–f ) and Atherton Canyon (c, g). (a) is a  phalanx of 13 similarly armed, solid-variety warriors.

In addition to weaponry and headgear, their shields are decorated with a  limited suite of heraldic designs and many are further elaborated with feather  bustles or medicine bundles. Several men wear animal tails attached to their  moccasins or animal pelts slung over their shoulder. In addition to these  accoutrements of dress, warriors’ weapons are often elaborately decorated— much more than can be explained by simple function as killing tools. Each of  these categories is discussed below. Offensive Weaponry Not surprisingly offensive weapons characteristic of our period of inter- est at Bear Gulch and Atherton Canyon are those typical of close combat,  shock-troop warfare. The bow and arrow is the only long-range weapon por- trayed, and bows are relatively much more common in the earliest subset of  Bear Gulch–style shield-bearing warriors—solidly-colored, Solid variety war- riors (figure 3.3a)—most of whom are arranged in ranks of men portrayed as  marching off to war (Keyser et al. 2012). These bows are long, single-curve  weapons, and most bowmen are equipped with several arrows. Combined with  their large, full-body-size shields we can readily assume that these bowmen’s  role would likely have been analogous to that of medieval archers who rained  arrows down on enemy troops massed in an opposing phalanx formation. This sort of battle formation and such tactics are clearly described by  Sahkomaupee for some of the latest battles in pre-horse/pre-gun times  (Lewis 1942:47–48; Secoy 1992:34–37). However, the paucity of bowmen in  Bear Gulch–style compositions, where bows account for only 38 of the nearly  660 shield-bearing warriors’ weapons (6%), suggests that archers were some- what specialized soldiers.4 Furthermore, their much greater occurrence in the  earliest Bear Gulch–style imagery suggests that, contrary to Sahkomaupee’s  recollections, this weapon was falling out of favor in the latest decades of the  Late Prehistoric period and the Protohistoric period, at least for the tribal  WARRIORS AND WEAPONS 71 </page> <page sequence="7"> groups responsible for drawing Bear Gulch–style imagery. Interestingly, only  occasional shield-bearing warriors armed with clubs and lances accompany  the early groups of archers, but these weapons become much more popular  for later warriors. The primary Bear Gulch–style weapons, accounting for more than 90 per- cent of the armed shield-bearing warriors, are lances, maces, and clubs, in  that order of popularity. Lances or spears (figure 3.4) are by far the most com- mon offensive weapon for Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric combatants at  these two sites, with 441 warriors so armed. An additional 87 lances, all por- trayed with a characteristic point and often a weapon flag identical to those on  shield-bearing warriors’ weapons, are drawn as freestanding examples. About  30 percent of spears have a large triangular or lanceolate point, 34 of which  (figure 3.4d, e, j, k, o, p, r) are identified as metal blades (Keyser and Kaiser  2010). Nearly 100 other lances have tips indicated by a simple crosspiece drawn  perpendicular to the spear shaft or a small “brush-like” attachment at the tip  composed of three to a dozen forward-pointing lines. Exactly what type of  killing tip was meant by these latter two depictions is not clear, but some of  the brush-like tips could have been a multiple-pointed leister type weapon  (though there are neither archaeological nor ethnographic examples of such  weapons on the Plains). Some lances are the most detailed, finely drawn  examples in Plains rock art, complete with carefully drawn points and attach- ments of exquisitely detailed feather flags and fluffs (figures 3.1h, 3.4j). Other than guns, which were obviously a Historic-period introduction,  lances are the most common weapon in both Late Prehistoric– and Historic- period rock art (Keyser 1977a:40–41, 1984:16; Keyser and Klassen 2001; Keyser  and Poetschat 2005:26) and also in robe and ledger art from the Historic  period (Afton et al. 1997; Bates et al. 2003). In Protohistoric-period rock art,  lances are by far the most common weapons depicted (Keyser 2010:91–92),  and they are the weapon of choice for more than 40 percent of all armed  shield-bearing warriors from other Plains sites (Keyser 2006b). The general  observation that lances were more common than bows and arrows for both  Late Prehistoric– and Protohistoric-period warriors, as evidenced in rock art  all across the northwestern Plains, is likewise at variance with the empha- sis given the bow and arrow in Sahkomaupee’s account, suggesting that his  experiences were either slightly anomalous compared to a broader regional  pattern, or that the emphasis was more a factor of Thompson’s reporting than  the actual situation. The second-most-common weapon at these sites is the spike mace—a  club-like halberd-type implement whose shaft is studded near its upper,  72 JAMES D. KEYSER </page> <page sequence="8"> Figure 3.4. Shield-bearing warriors armed with lances: (a–f, i, j, n, p–r) Bear  Gulch; (g, h, k, m, o) Atherton Canyon. Scale bars are 5 cm.

Ninety such weapons are split  evenly between single- and double-spike varieties, and 84 of these are carried  by shield- bearing warriors or other associated humans. Often the spike or  spikes show a marked downward curve, but others project nearly straight out  from the shaft. Some maces are drawn about the length of the clubs com- monly carried by other shield-bearing warriors at these sites, but others are  significantly longer, approaching almost 2 m in length (as estimated relative  to the anatomical height of the warrior), similar to the size of a lance.

Most maces are brandished by shield-bearing warriors, but one of the most  carefully drawn examples is embedded in the head of a vanquished enemy  (figure 3.5g). In one phalanx of 14 warriors (12 of whom carry shields), eight  men brandish such maces, while the only other armed members of the party  are two lancers and a third man with a club (figure 3.6b). 74 JAMES D. KEYSER </page> <page sequence="10"> Figure 3.6. Ranks of warriors grouped and ready for battle are common in  the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric-period rock art at Bear Gulch.

Warriors indicated by capital letters (A–E in c and A in e) are  combination figures consisting of the original warrior and a second warrior drawn  as a direct conjoined overlay. Scale bars are 10 cm.  Spike maces are occasionally illustrated in other Late Prehistoric– and  Protohistoric-period rock art, usually wielded by shield-bearing warriors  (e.g., Francis and Loendorf 2002:149; Fredlund 1993:43; Keyser 1977a:figure  13b, d, 14a; 1984:figure 3a,c; 2004a:21; 2006b; Keyser and Klassen 2001:196,  199, 246; Keyser and Poetschat 2008:46, 59; Mulloy 1958:figure 42, numbers 1,  WARRIORS AND WEAPONS 75 </page> <page sequence="11"> 5, 7). Most are single-spike weapons, but several are clearly two-spike maces  (figures 3.5a–b, 3.6b). They are not illustrated in ledger drawings or on buf- falo robes, but they do occur in ethnographic and archaeological collections.  The best-documented example is a club (figure 3.7c) illustrated by Bodmer  that has a decorated wooden handle and an elk-antler spike carved in the  form of a bird’s head (Hunt et al. 1984:334).5 An archaeological specimen,  a 70-cm-long proximal end of an elk-antler main beam with a sharpened  bez tine (the second tine above the skull), was found in the vicinity of sev- eral high-altitude bighorn-sheep traps and was likely a mountain sheep–  killing club (Frison 2004:161; Kornfeld et al. 2010:309). Prince Maximilian  also noted elk-antler war clubs used by the Gros Ventre Indians (Hunt et al.  1984:334) and somewhat similarly shaped war clubs with metal spikes were  made and used later in the historic period (Taylor 1994:163). Although it is  possible that some of those illustrated at Bear Gulch and Atherton Canyon  had metal spikes, the curvature of most spikes suggests that they were deer-  or elk-antler tines. Clubs, carried by 71 shield-bearing warriors and another associated human  occur as two primary types. Most common are baseball bat–shaped weapons,  which account for nearly half of the illustrated examples (figure 3.6a, 3.8c–f ).  These are shown either projecting out at an angle from behind the warrior’s  shield or held vertically in his hand just outside the shield perimeter. Some are  quite elaborate, with a knob on the handle (figures 3.6a, 3.8f ), a tassel or feath- ers at the top, and decorative lines drawn along the weapon’s barrel. Broad,  blade-like, triangular clubs (figures 3.6a, 3.8a) are also quite common. These  show a distinct triangular shape, sometimes with a round knob at the bottom  and lines decorating the club’s blade (figure 3.8a). A few other clubs—primar- ily the pogamoggan type with a small stone head bound at the end of a flexible  shaft—are carried by fewer than 10 shield-bearing warriors (figure 3.8b). War clubs of various sizes and shapes were common among Historic-period  Plains Indians (Catlin 1973 [1844]:V.1:figures 99, 101; Hunt et al. 1984:334–338;  Penney 1992:228–229; C. Taylor 2001:14–23; Thomas and Ronnefeldt 1976:20).  Those drawn at Bear Gulch and Atherton Canyon indicate clearly that their  origins extend back into the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods. The  clearly illustrated baseball bat–type is much more common among these rock  art warriors than in later Historic-period paintings or ethnographic collec- tions, but at least three archaeological specimens (e.g., figure 3.9) found near  bighorn sheep traps in Wyoming and identified as a mountain sheep–killing  clubs (Frison 2004:161; Kornfeld et al. 2010:309) are a nearly perfect match for  several illustrated rock art clubs (cf. Figures 3.6a, 3.8f ). 76 JAMES D. KEYSER </page> <page sequence="12"> Figure 3.7. Shields and clubs from  the Upper Missouri River region  drawn by Karl Bodmer (a, c) and  George Catlin (b).

KEYSER </page> <page sequence="14"> Figure 3.9. Wooden club from Wyoming found associated with a mountain sheep trap.  Note shape and knob on handle that resemble clubs used by Bear Gulch–style shield-bearing  warriors. Photograph courtesy of George Frison.  Rock art bow-spears are illustrated at only six other Plains sites from  Writing-on-Stone, Alberta, to the Texas Panhandle (Keyser 2008b).6 The  floating bow-spears in the Bear Gulch coup-count tally are nearly iden- tical to three at Writing-on-Stone; and all have been identified as part of  a Protohistoric-period Blackfoot tribal style (Brownstone 2001a:260–261;  Keyser 2006a:71; 2008b:71; 2011; Keyser and Cowdrey 2008:21–23). In Historic  times the bow-spear was thought to have potent supernatural power, and ver- sions of the weapon served as emblems of leadership in various military societ- ies of several Plains tribes (Keyser 2008b). Four “crooked lance” coup sticks (figure 3.10c–e) are associated with Bear  Gulch–style shield bearers—three carried by warriors and a fourth drawn as  a floating weapon counting coup on another warrior. All are clearly depicted  crook-neck staffs, commonly shown in Historic-period northwestern Plains  robe and ledger art (Afton et al. 1997:219; Berlo 1996:103, 166, 201; Horse  Capture et al. 1993:105; Maurer 1992:189, 223, 226, 235, 241, 253) and occasionally  in rock art (Keyser and Cowdrey 2008:28; Keyser and Mitchell 2000:27, 30).  Contrary to most of those drawn in Historic-period art, none of these four is  decorated in any fashion. Defensive Weaponry: The Shield The only defensive weapon shown in the rock art under consideration at  these sites is the full-body-size shield, carried by 1,024 shield-bearing warriors  (figures 3.1, 3.3, 3.4–3.6, 3.8, 3.11a–f ) and drawn as another 146 freestanding  images. When the size of these round shields can be assessed against the  height of the warriors carrying them, they measure between 80 and 140 cm  (30–55 in) in diameter (Keyser 2010). More than 750 of these show heraldic  designs, including both geometric and representational images. Simple counts  WARRIORS AND WEAPONS 79 </page> <page sequence="15"> Figure 3.10. Bow-spears and coup sticks, although uncommon, do occur as Late  Prehistoric/Protohistoric–period weaponry. Note that a is a coup-count tally with four  examples of the same bow-spear counting coup on enemy warriors and capturing two  enemy women (at far right). The male warrior between the last shield figure and the two  women is coup-struck on his upper arm by a large, very detailed arrow or spear with  outsized fletching. Scale bars are 5 cm except a and e.  of basic meaningful units (cf. Nagy 1994) show that shield heraldry among  the group(s) that drew these figures was based primarily on geometric forms  (Keyser and Kaiser 2014). Sometimes this is simply a division of the shield’s  circular field, but more often it is a distinctive geometric element drawn to  span the face of the shield. The cross is the most common such element, com- prising 30 percent of all geometric designs, and has the most variations. Representational images comprise only about 17 percent of heraldic designs  and occur as five basic meaningful units, including various animals or birds,  eyes, teeth, and the Hand of God motif. Bears are the most common recog- nizable animal design and occur in two forms—the Bear Coming Out and  the Standing Bear motifs (figures 3.3d, 3.5d)—both of which are common in  Historic-period shield heraldry (Keyser 2004b; Keyser and Kaiser 2014). The  Hand of God motif (figure 3.5f ) shows a human-like arm and hand reaching  80 JAMES D. KEYSER </page> <page sequence="16"> Figure 3.11.

An additional 15 shields have a small  weasel- to fox-sized animal-skin medicine bundle attached in lieu of a bustle  (figure 3.4a, o). Accoutrements of Dress Five categories of ritual dress characterize Bear Gulch and Atherton Canyon  shield-bearing warriors (table 3.1), but only one of these—headdresses and  hair styles—is shared with V-neck humans. In addition to head gear, other  items include—in order of their relative frequency—feather bustles, face paint,  animal-skin medicine bundles, and animal tails attached to the heels of moc- casins or to garters worn at the knees. Headdresses and Hairstyles More than 635 human figures, including both women and men and V-neck  humans and shield-bearing warriors, wear headdresses or hairstyles. Multiple  examples of six distinctive headdresses are recorded and eight different hair- styles can be distinguished. Headdresses illustrated multiple times include  feathers in many different configurations, bison-horn war bonnet, wolf hat,  “sheep horns,” and a tall bishop’s mitre–type hat. Recognizable hairstyles  include roach, scalplock, bear’s ears, hair extensions, pompadour, long hair,  mullet, and a sun-ray hairdo that appears to represent “disheveled hair” used  to indicate women. In fact, some of these, such as the roach or bear’s ears could  represent either a headdress or a hairstyle, depending on whether the headgear  was a separate attachment or simply a way of cutting or wearing the hair. Of  these, the roach, wolf hat, scalplock, and feather headdress of various types are  worn by more than 50 warriors each. Most common at these sites is the roach, worn in three different ways by  nearly 225 warriors (figures 3.4h–i; 3.11a–b); usually as a series of short, similar  length, evenly spaced, curved lines crowning the top of the warrior’s head and  often arching down over one side nearly to the neck as if illustrated in side pro- file. Other roaches consist of either short, straight, evenly spaced rays atop the  head and arching down around one quadrant, or a “flat top” hairstyle shown as  a series of relatively evenly spaced, short, straight, vertical lines standing only  atop the head. This roach motif could represent either a “Mohawk” hairstyle  where the shaved sides of the head leave only a crest of hair standing from  the forehead back to the neck, or a roach headdress in the form of a crest  made of stiff animal hair worn as a cap or hair attachment.

The roach is occasionally illustrated in Plains rock art; most often worn  by shield-bearing warriors (Keyser 2006b; Keyser and Klassen 2001:233, 240;  Keyser and Poetschat 2009:11, 34). At Writing-on-Stone it is worn by two  shield-bearing horsemen that date—like much Bear Gulch and Atherton  Canyon imagery—to the early Protohistoric period (Keyser 2010:91). Nearly 150 warriors at Bear Gulch and Atherton Canyon wear a distinc- tive wolf-hat headdress (figures 3.1e-f, 3.4, 3.5), so far positively identified  only at these two sites (Keyser 2007a). This characteristic headdress shows a  prominent long, thin nose in combination with two ears and a cluster of lines  extending behind the head that represents the wolf-skin cape hanging down  the warrior’s back (Keyser 2007a; Keyser et al. 2012). On 66 examples a short  crosspiece is painted or scratched near the end of the nose essentially per- pendicular to its long axis. Although there is a good ethnographic reference  for the wolf-hat headdress (e.g., Blish and Bad Heart Bull 1967:172, 174, 177;  Densmore 1918:380–381, Plates 57, 58, 66b; Ewers 1997:198; Keyser 2007a), there  is no clue as to what this crosspiece might actually represent. Just more than 100 warriors wear feather headdresses of various sorts (figures  3.1h, 3.3c, 3.4d-e), ranging from “stand-up” eagle-feather bonnets, much like those  typically worn by Historic-period Blackfeet warriors (Keyser 2004a:6), to single  or double feathers worn upright in their hair, to a feather worn horizontally in  the hair atop the warrior’s head. This wide variety of arrangements corresponds  to other Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric–period rock art imagery (Keyser and  Klassen 2001) and closely mimics the almost limitless ways in which Historic  Plains warriors wore feathers, either as formal headdresses or simply tied into  various places in their hair (e.g., Mails 1973; Taylor 1975; Thomas and Ronnefeldt  1976). Interestingly, the stereotypical Plains feathered war bonnet with feathered  trailer is not present in the precontact rock art at either site. A scalplock, shown as a single line extending up and back from the top of the  warrior’s head and then drooping down toward the ground, is worn by 64 shield- bearing warriors and 5 other humans at Bear Gulch and Atherton Canyon (fig- ures 3.3a, f–g, 3.6b). This almost certainly represents a braid, and one special- ized variety terminates in a tassel of short lines that represents either unbraided  hair or feathers or streamers attached at the braid’s end. The scalplock hairstyle  shows a statistically significant association with the earliest, solidly painted Bear  Gulch–style shield figures and serves, in part, to identify one particular cluster  of these figures (Young 2010). Elsewhere on the Plains, fewer than half a dozen  scalplocks are drawn in Late Prehistoric–period rock art (Keyser and Klassen  84 JAMES D. KEYSER </page> <page sequence="20"> 2001; Keyser 2006b), but they are much more frequent in Historic-period rock  art and robe and ledger art, where they are one of the most common hairstyles  (Afton et al. 1997; Bates et al. 2003; Berlo 1996; Conner and Conner 1971:figures  14, 18; Keyser 1977a:68, 71; 1996:36, 42; 2000; Keyser and Klassen 2001:197, 220,  240, 248, 252, 259, 266, 275; Keyser and Poetschat 2005:41, 98, 107, 2009:36). At least seven other kinds of headgear are worn by multiple humans. The  two most important are the bear’s ears headdress and a distinctive “sun-ray”  hairstyle composed of short lines coming out all around the head. The bear’s ears headdress (figures 3.1g, 3.4k), which is represented as a pair  of short, round or squared ear-like knobs arising singly from each side at the  top of a warrior’s head, could represent either a pair of real bear’s ears tied  into the warrior’s hair, or his own hair knotted and tied up on each side of  the head to mimic this shape. In several Plains tribes, warriors who possessed  bear power wore either real bear’s ears or this knotted hair style (Ewers 1955b;  Mails 1973:352–354; Rockwell 1991:101), and this headdress is worn in rock art  by shield-bearing warriors and a few other humans across the northwestern  Plains (Francis 2007:219; Keyser 2004a:112; Mulloy 1958:126, 130). The sun-ray hairstyle (figures 3.10, 3.12d) at Bear Gulch represents dishev- eled hair used frequently in later Plains Indian art to represent women (Greer  and Keyser 2008; Horse Capture et al. 1993:85; McCleary 2008b:141–142, 248).  In every Bear Gulch example it is associated with a human figure identifiable  as female by the depiction of breasts and hips and/or a vulva. Several other hairstyles drawn much less frequently at these sites are similar  to later Historic-period examples. These include very long hair (sometimes  combined with an upswept forehead pompadour), and hair extensions shown  either as a hairnet-like attachment or dots painted along the length of a war- rior’s flowing tresses. Feather Bustles Feather bustles are drawn as a central line with multiple short lines branch- ing from it, representing a cord or leather strip to which multiple feathers  are attached. Such bustles embellish five freestanding shields and 185 shield- bearing warriors (figures 3.1, 3.3–3.5). Bustles are drawn either as single-sided  examples with feathers attached only to the lower side of the main stem, or  double-sided bustles that have feathers extending from both sides. One par- ticular single-sided example (figure 3.13c) obviously represents a stiffened,  erected buffalo bull’s tail with feathers suspended below it, since it has exactly  the same configuration as the erected tail (e.g., figure 3.8a) seen on early  Historic-period Mandan shields (Thomas and Ronnefeldt 1976:212, 217).

Note  women in a, b, and d. Scale bars are 5 cm.  Feather bustles were a common accoutrement among Historic Indian tribes  from the Southwest to the upper Missouri (Flint and Flint 2005:191; Thomas  and Ronnefeldt 1976:212, 217) and were often illustrated on decorated robes and  war shirts (Keyser and Brady 1993:figure 1; Maurer 1992:186; Taylor 1998:63).  Rock art examples are much less common, occurring at only two other sites  (Gebhard et al. 1987:figure 20; Keyser and Poetschat 2009:14, 37), but the Castle  Gardens example (figure 3.1i) also appears to be an erected buffalo-bull’s tail.  86 JAMES D. KEYSER </page> <page sequence="22"> Figure 3.13. Streamers, probably made from animal tails or other  parts, are worn by these Bear Gulch shield-bearing warriors at the heels  of their moccasins (a, b, d) and at their knees (c). Note erect buffalo-bull  tail bustle on c and Hand of God shield design on b. Scale bars are 5 cm.  Although sometimes illustrated as hanging from near a man’s waist (Catlin  1973 [1844]:figures 223, 289; Keyser and Poetschat 2009:14), all Bear Gulch  and Atherton Canyon examples are attached directly to a shield, as was more  frequently illustrated (figure 3.8a, b) by Catlin (1973 [1844]:figures 172, 287;  C. Taylor 2001:10) and Bodmer (Thomas and Ronnefeldt 1976:217). WARRIORS AND WEAPONS 87 </page> <page sequence="23"> Face Paint Just more than 100 humans (including 88 shield-bearing warriors) at these  two sites wear nine repeated face paint or tattoo designs (figure 3.11). All are  simple geometric line patterns carefully drawn across the head, or sections  of the head filled in solidly with pigment or scratches. The most common  show the warrior’s head decorated with a series of deliberately spaced vertical  lines or bisected by a vertical line, but other warriors wear a cross centered on  the head (figure 3.11a) or have half their head (either vertical or horizontal)  solidly colored (figure 3.11 d–f ). All of these patterns are duplicated in both  ledger and robe art (Berlo 1996; Taylor 1994:191; 1998:13, 48–49, 62; Maurer  1992:191, 195), but face paint is not commonly illustrated elsewhere in rock art.  Among other known Plains shield-bearing warriors only 16 have facial lines  that might be paint or tattoos and only the tear-streak motif (figure 3.11g)— repeated on seven different warriors—is found multiple times (Keyser 2006b). Animal-Skin Medicine Bundles There are 24 personal medicine bundles (figures 3.3d; 3.4a, o; 3.14a, d)  illustrated at Bear Gulch and Atherton Canyon, including the skins of 17  small weasel- to fox-sized animals, five fox or wolf pelts slung over a war- rior’s shoulder, and two bird bundles, one tied in a warrior’s hair and another  attached to a spear. Most small-animal-skin bundles are attached to a war- rior’s shield, but one is suspended from the waist of a rectangular-body  human and another is freestanding. Pelts worn by shield-bearing warriors sometimes obscure the warrior’s head,  and one clearly arches up overhead and extends behind (figure 3.14a). But  given the well-documented and characteristic lack of Western perspective in  Plains-warrior art (Ewers 1968:8–13), these were clearly intended to show ani- mal skins slung over the shoulder as they were worn in Historic times (Keyser  2007a:65; 2008a:67–68). One bird bundle (figure 3.14d) tied in a shield-bearer’s  hair is an elongated, cigar shape with short stubby wings and a short line  extending further back with small “knots” tied in it. This bundle is paired with  the warrior’s hawk-beak mask and face paint indicated by a solidly scratched  lower half of his face. Medicine bundles and animal pelts are only rarely illustrated in other  rock art (Keyser 2008a:64; Keyser and Klassen 2001:71; 2003; Keyser and  Poetschat 2008:43, 62), but bird bundles worn in a warrior’s hair and fox or  wolf pelts are quite common in robe art and ledger art (Barbeau 1960:147,  figure 99; Bates et al. 2003:290–295, 301; Berlo 1996:93, 103, 114, 166, 208–209,  215; Brownstone 1993:19; Horse Capture et al. 1993:103; Keyser 2004a:69–71,  88 JAMES D.

Moccasin Tails Fifteen shield-bearing warriors wear streamers attached to the heel of  both moccasins. Extending out to the side or straight down from the heel,  these range from simple straight lines, to fan-like groups of two or three  straight lines, to long lines with a knot tied near each end (figure 3.13a, b, d).  Similar but unelaborated pendant streamers are also illustrated hanging at  an oblique angle from one or both knees of six other shield-bearing warriors  (figure 3.13c). Such streamers attached to a warrior’s moccasins or to garter  belts at his knees are commonly portrayed in robe and ledger art (Afton et al.  1997:66–67; Berlo 1996:78–79, 85, 98, 149, 153, 155, 169, 175, 183, 197, 221; Stirling  WARRIORS AND WEAPONS 89 </page> <page sequence="25"> 1938:27–33; Thomas and Ronnefeldt 1976:221) and they are shown in rock art  at Writing-on-Stone and Joliet (Keyser 2004a:100; 2008b:63, 68; Keyser and  Klassen 2001:22, 230). Weapon Decorations Rock art weapons at Bear Gulch and Atherton Canyon are often elabo- rately decorated (table 3.1), primarily with feather flags, but also with smaller  feather or hair “fluffs” and elaborate tabs or tassels. Feather Flags and Fluffs Almost 370 lances and a single bow-spear are embellished with a distinc- tive feather flag in one of four basic patterns: oval, maple leaf, spade, and split  spade in order of frequency (Fossati et al. 2010). Attached to the forward third  of a spear’s wooden shaft between the point and handgrip, these flags (figures  3.1, 3.4, 3.11, 3.13) are often augmented with a small “fluff ” drawn as a more-or- less matched set of short, upward-pointing, oblique lines placed on each side  of the spear shaft in a “point down” chevron design. Many fluffs are found just  below the feather flag, but others occur just behind the spear point. They could  represent the downy barbs commonly found on the quill at the base of the  feather’s vane, smaller eagle plumes like those attached at the base or tips of  eagle feathers that were used in Historic-period headdresses and other ritual  items, or decorations of stiffened animal hair. Frequently the flag itself is further decorated with various combinations of  vertical or horizontal lines and solid colored areas drawn within its outline. A  limited set of decorative patterns common to all types of flags suggests that  these symbolically indicated the performance of different sorts of brave deeds  and/or the attainment of special status or position within a military hierarchy  (Fossati et al. 2010). Oval flags are far more common than any other, making up just more than  70 percent of all recorded examples (Fossati et al. 2010). All flag types decorate  the weapons of shield-bearing warriors and other humans, and a few also  elaborate freestanding spears. Elsewhere in Plains rock art similar weapon  flags are uncommon, though more than half a dozen oval and spade flags are  drawn at Writing-on-Stone (Keyser 1977a:figure 14b; 1977b:31, 44, 49; Keyser  and Klassen 2001:199, 229, 247) and single examples are carved at other sites  in Montana and Wyoming (Fredlund 1991:4; Fossati et al. 2010; Keyser and  Klassen 2001:246). Bodmer illustrated somewhat similar feather flags and hair fluffs attached  to the butt end of Mandan warriors’ spears (Thomas and Ronnefeldt 1976:172,  90 JAMES D. KEYSER </page> <page sequence="26"> 212, 217), but nothing similar is drawn in robe or ledger art. Feather or hair  fluffs also adorn each of the four drawings of a single bow-spear in the elabo- rate Bear Gulch coup-count tally (figure 3.10). Positioned on the bow stave  both above and below the handgrip, these fluffs are paired with longer stream- ers in two instances. Similar decorative elements are common on most robe  and ledger art bow-spears (Keyser 2008b). Tabs Roughly triangular tabs or tassels, drawn most commonly as a cluster of  two to six short lines, but also shown as a clearly triangular attachment, adorn  the ends of 27 weapons, including maces, clubs, a knife, a lance, and three  bow-spears (figures 3.5e, f; 3.10a, b). One distinctly triangular tab on the lower  end of a bow-spear also has a pendant feather. These items represent either  clusters of feathers, streamer tassels, or quilled or beaded pennants hang- ing from the bottoms of these weapons. Similar decorative elements (figure  3.15) are commonly illustrated on various rock art weapons (Keyser 1977a:76;  2008b:66; 2008c:3–4; 2010:89; Keyser and Cowdrey 2008:28–30; Keyser and  Klassen 2001:225, 229, 236; McCleary 2008b:265–266; Parsons 1987:260) and  frequently adorn hatchets (figure 3.16) and bow-spears in robe and ledger  drawings (Barbeau 1960:148, 170, 171; Brownstone 2001b:80; Greene 2006:83;  Keyser 2008b:64; Keyser and Cowdrey 2008:29). Beaded tabs are common on  ethnographic specimens and in Historic photographs where they hang from  hatchets and pipe stems (C. Taylor 1994:77, 200; 2001:8). Battle Compositions and Tactics In several cases Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric warriors at Bear Gulch  and Atherton Canyon are arranged in compositions that tell us a great deal  about how pre-horse/pre-gun warfare was conducted and how it was viewed  by participants. Foremost among these compositions are at least 19 instances  where groups of 5 to 14 warriors occur in a horizontally oriented row or pha- lanx of men posed as if marching off to war or standing ready for battle (figures  3.3, 3.6). Most ranks are exclusively shield-bearing warriors, but four rows also  include one or more other combatants. Likewise each phalanx contains several  individuals who appear to have been drawn by the same hand, suggesting that  most of these compositions are the work of single artists. Individual warriors  in rank often wear quite elaborate headdresses and other regalia, including  moccasin tails and bustles, and carry highly detailed weapons and decorated  shields. A few ranks, identified by superimposition sequences as the earliest  WARRIORS AND WEAPONS 91 </page> <page sequence="27"> Figure 3.15. Tabs and tassels are commonly drawn in Historic- period rock art, especially decorating tomahawks. (a, d) Writing-on- Stone; (b) McKee Spring; (c) Nordstrom-Bowen.  examples of the Bear Gulch style, are composed exclusively of warriors with  solid-colored shields and almost identical arms and accoutrements, but most  ranks are composed of warriors whose shields have elaborate heraldic designs  and who carry various weapons. In one rank of 12 shield bearers and two other  men, nine warriors carry plain shields, two men have decorated shields, and  one carries a solid shield. Despite the fact that many of these compositions appear to be drawings by  single artists, in nine instances obvious ranks of warriors have been modified  by later artists who superimposed from one to seven of the original figures  with a second shield-bearing warrior drawn directly over the original image,  92 JAMES D. KEYSER </page> <page sequence="28"> Figure 3.16. This extremely complex tab decorating the handle of a tomahawk shown  counting coup is illustrated on a bison robe in the Deutsches Ledermuseum, Offenbach,  Germany. Photograph by the author.  using the existing figure as a template (figure 3.17). Such carefully crafted  superimpositions are termed “direct conjoined overlays” (Kaiser and Keyser  2008). The most complex of these shows an original rank of nine painted solid  and decorated variety shield-bearing warriors that was later modified by an  artist(s) who scratched directly conjoined shield figures on at least seven of  the original warriors (figure 3.6c). Another complex composition shows a later  rank of warriors superimposed on an original phalanx and clearly related to  it by a three-part conjoined overlay (Keyser et al. 2012). In some cases (e.g.,  figure 3.6d, e) it appears that a later artist also added warriors to the original  composition (sometimes to accompany the direct conjoined overlay). Often  these are smaller warriors placed on the periphery of the original group. Thus, the Bear Gulch and Atherton Canyon artists obviously intended to  show groups of men prepared for—or actually marching off to—war; and such  depictions were drawn during both the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric  periods. That these ranks of warriors were a crucially important motif is docu- mented by the careful effort often expended to reuse them through the means  of direct conjoined overlays and added warriors. Notably rare among these shield-bearing warriors, however, are scenes of  combat showing two or more warriors actually fighting one another. Among  the more than 1,000 shield-bearing warriors, only 17 pairs of opposing figures  WARRIORS AND WEAPONS 93 </page> <page sequence="29"> Figure 3.17. Ranks of shield-bearing warriors often show multiple examples of direct  conjoined overlays, indicating reuse of the specific imagery. At Bear Gulch (a), two  warriors (middle) are conjoined on an original group of six (bottom row); top row shows  rank of warriors as it appears today. At Atherton Canyon (b), two warriors (middle) are  conjoined on original group of four warriors (bottom row); top row shows rank of warriors  as it appears today. Note that the light gray lines in b indicate parts of the original figure  incorporated into the overlaid figure. Scale bars are 10 cm.  and one pair of warriors fighting a third enemy are engaged in what might  represent hand-to-hand combat (figure 3.18). This is less than 4 percent of the  total shield bearers at the site. Furthermore, several of these combat “scenes”  are drawn in such an extremely sketchy manner (e.g., warriors lacking shield  heraldry and using the simplest of weapons) that they appear almost as an  afterthought, unlike the carefully detailed ranks of standing warriors that  characterize these sites (e.g., figure 3.18d, f, g). In contrast to the relative paucity of shield-bearing warriors fighting each  other, however, Bear Gulch V-neck warriors show at least five identifiable  combat compositions (four of which are quite detailed), involving 10 of the 33  humans. Thus, more than 30 percent of V-neck figures are illustrated in the  act of fighting. Likewise, among all Bear Gulch–style shield-bearing warriors only two  are shown with floating weapons counting coup on them, and 25 more are  wounded by an arrow. In contrast, there are more than a dozen examples of  94 JAMES D. KEYSER </page> <page sequence="30"> Figure 3.18.

These include three unique shield-bearing warriors and three V-neck  humans in a coup-count lineup. In addition, capture hands8 touch three other  V-neck figures. In all, more than 60 percent of V-neck humans are engaged in  individual fighting actions, while fewer than 5 percent of shield-bearing war- riors give any indication of individual combat. Instead, shield-bearing warriors are illustrated as corporate groups, and  when the artists wanted to show their destruction they sometimes defaced  these figures using “rub outs” created by scratching so heavily across the origi- nal figure that it is all but obliterated. More than two dozen shield-bearing  warriors and a row of several other Late Prehistoric–period humans are  rubbed out in this manner. While some rub outs may have been scratched  by later Historic-period artists not responsible for the original Bear Gulch– style figures, others almost certainly were done by Bear Gulch–style artists.  Whether this signified victory over enemies or the loss of one’s own military  comrades cannot be determined. Strategy, Tactics, and Motives Given the weaponry and battle compositions documented in the Late  Prehistoric/Protohistoric–period rock art imagery at Bear Gulch and Atherton  Canyon, what does this imagery tell us about strategy and tactics used by these  warriors and the possible motives that caused them to fight? In fact, we can  infer some specific details about the use of certain weapons and the function of  particular examples, and also the warriors’ psychological motivation for warfare. The Efficacy of Precontact Weaponry From the types of weapons that dominate Bear Gulch and Atherton Canyon  rock art and those carried by shield-bearing warriors at other northwestern  Plains sites (see Keyser 2006b), it is clear that precontact warfare was fought  primarily at close quarters with “brute force” implements. Bows and arrows,  which strike an enemy from a relatively safe distance, were used by fewer than  6 percent of the armed Bear Gulch–style shield-bearing warriors; and only an  additional 25 examples (fewer than 3% of the more than 1,000 individuals) have  enemy arrows sticking in them. Interestingly, these percentages are about the  same for shield-bearing warriors at all other published northwestern Plains sites,  where 8 of 180 (4.4%) of the armed, Late Prehistoric shield-bearers use bows  and arrows (Keyser 2006b), and only 7 (2%) of all shield bearers are shot with  arrows. Instead, throughout the northern Plains, armed shield-bearing warriors  96 JAMES D. KEYSER </page> <page sequence="32"> Table 3.2.

Furthermore, two of these weapons—clubs and maces—would have been  truly effective only when used to disarm an opponent and beat him to death  with multiple blows. Imagine the mayhem caused by wielding the equivalent  of a baseball bat or an axe handle studded with one or two 10–15 cm (4–6  in) long antler spikes. But spike maces may have had an even broader func- tion. Larry Loendorf (2009) has suggested that these weapons could also have  served to hook an opponent’s shield and pull it away from his body so that  other warriors would have had a better opportunity for a close-quarters kill. In  either case, killing like this would have been face to face; up close and personal. The fact that so many Bear Gulch–style lances are tipped with what appear  to be some of the earliest metal blades in Plains rock art (Keyser and Kaiser  2010) is also suggestive of close-quarters combat. Given the hand-to-hand war- fare suggested by clubs and maces, a lancer armed only with a spear tipped  with a several-inch-long, very fragile chipped-stone point would have been at  a distinct disadvantage against a club-wielding opponent who could parry a  thrust and shatter the killing point with one well-placed blow. Conversely, metal  points are certainly less fragile and are more likely to have remained intact even  after multiple thrusts and parries. Hence, they must have been seen as extremely  more potent and more valuable weapons, and thus were quickly adopted. Some limited evidence suggests that bow-spears may be an exception  to the brute force nature of these battles. Carried by one Bear Gulch–style  shield-bearing warrior and shown in use counting coup in the Blackfoot-style  WARRIORS AND WEAPONS 97 </page> <page sequence="33"> coup-count tally, these weapons are decorated very similarly to the most elab- orate of their Historic-period counterparts (Keyser 2008b), and tipped with  long lethal metal points. However, of the four bow-spears shown counting  coup, only one strikes a blow (touching the enemy’s headdress) that could  possibly have been immediately fatal, and even this may not have caused a  fatal wound. Others hit the shield of one warrior and the legs of another, and  a third bow-spear arches above two female captives. Such non-lethal blows, and the symbolism showing captives under control  of this powerful weapon, are exactly the same for bow-spears depicted in led- ger art, where they rarely strike a fatal blow but instead record a counted coup  or are shown being brandished to exercise their power. This is also consistent  with ethnographic reports where special “thunder bow” bow-spears were not  used to kill enemies, but rather to count coup by striking the foe with the  flat of the lance point and to magically strike at or control enemies from a  distance (Grinnell 1972:Vol. 2:83–84; Keyser 2008b:62; Powell 2002a:63–68;  2002b:56–57). In short, it appears that the bow-spear in the coup-count tally  was portrayed more as a magically imbued weapon used to count coup and  control enemies than a close-quarters killing tool. Finally, many warrior artists obviously took great care to elaborate their  weapon, far beyond any functional necessity. Lances and bow-spears are  adorned with a feather flag and/or eagle plume or animal-hair fluffs; bow- spears have a tab or tassel at the proximal end; and clubs and maces sometimes  have a tab or streamers attached to their handle end, and the barrel is carved  or painted with lines and geometric elements. The only purposes such things  could have served were as decoration, personal aggrandizement, or possibly  the infusion of the weapon with supernatural power. In none of these cases do  these elements improve the weapon’s function, but they do show a high value  placed on such elaborations by their owners. The Psychology of Precontact Warfare V-neck warriors at Bear Gulch, which are dated within the same Late  Prehistoric and Protohistoric timespan as the Bear Gulch–style shield-b earing  warriors (Keyser et al. 2011, 2012), provide even more detailed information  about how at least one precontact group viewed warfare. Apparently drawn by  early Blackfeet intruders into this area of central Montana (Keyser 2006a:71;  2011; Keyser et al. 2012),10 these particular V-neck warriors are in compositions  that typically show direct hand-to-hand combat and emphasize counting of  several different coups. Involving the fewer than 30 Blackfoot-style V-neck  warriors at the site are at least 16 different coup-count episodes, including  98 JAMES D. KEYSER </page> <page sequence="34"> multiple instances of hand-to-hand combat, braving an opponent’s fusillade  of fire, touching (but not killing) an enemy, revenge killing, and capturing  enemy women and children (Greer and Keyser 2008:94–95; Keyser 2006a,  2011; Keyser et al. 2012). Another shield taken by a capture hand documents  the capture of war booty in the same part of the site as most of these combat  scenes, but unfortunately this image cannot be securely associated with nearby  Protohistoric-period Blackfoot-style petroglyphs, and may instead be a later  Historic-period coup count. Likewise, six V-neck war captives, including four women, a prepubescent  female, and one child, indicate that women and children were “fair game”  in the Protohistoric period, exactly as they were in Historic-period warfare.  Possibly more important, however, these figures suggest that even at such an  early date women and children were a commodity worth capturing, either for  the slave trade or to bear children that would replace warriors fallen in battle.  While these practices are well documented in the Historic record (Keyser et al.  2006) and inferred for Protohistoric times (Lewis 1942:49), this is the first rock  art demonstration that they commonly existed in precontact warfare. Finally, one coup-count tally, identified as a Blackfoot artist’s drawing (Keyser  2006a:71; 2008a:71; 2011), shows several obvious coups, including touching of  enemies, revenge killing, and capture of women (figure 3.10). Dated to the  pre-horse/pre-gun Protohistoric period, the image is a striking demonstration  that the concept of coup counting and advertisement of such honors at sacred  sites existed in pre-horse Plains warfare. With this marked emphasis on coup counting by V-neck warriors, we  can infer that deeds of bravery similar to those central to Historic Plains  warfare (Grinnell 1910) were also a key element of Late Prehistoric and/or  Protohistoric-period warfare—at least to the Montana Blackfeet. Similarly,  other evidence also suggests that war honors were the basis for warfare actions  undertaken by the artists responsible for drawing Bear Gulch–style imagery.  In Historic-period Plains cultures, moccasin tails are so strongly associated  with the performance of specific deeds of bravery (Lowie 1956:217; Mallery  1972:436; Thomas and Ronnefeldt 1976:251) that it seems almost certain that  those illustrated at Bear Gulch are similarly honorific. But not just moccasin  tails support the assertion that a system of ranked war honors was in place on  the central Montana plains prior to the horse. Elsewhere, Keyser (Fossati et  al. 2010:119–121) has argued that the various forms and relative proportions of  different weapon flags “represent various earned honors such as the accom- plishment of specific deeds of bravery in warfare or the attainment of ‘officer’  positions within a pan-tribal military organization” (Fossati et al. 2010:120).  WARRIORS AND WEAPONS 99 </page> <page sequence="35"> In addition, a strong case has been made that wolf-hat headdresses and ani- mal pelts worn by several warriors likely represent attainment of the honor- ific “scout” position, as did similar wolf symbolism in Historic times (Keyser  2007a:67–68; 2008a:67–68). In addition to counting coup (as evidenced by the above-described imagery  and insignia), precontact Plains warfare also apparently had a strong super- natural component. Several heraldic designs common on Bear Gulch–style  shields suggest that in addition to their defensive utility, shields also played an  important psychological role in offensive warfare. Two repeated Bear Gulch  shield designs show a bear painted so that it appears to be coming out of the  shield to directly confront the owner’s enemy (Keyser 2004b; Kaiser et al. 2010;  Keyser and Kaiser 2014). These designs are quite similar to Historic-period  heraldry used by several tribes for exactly such psychological “shock” value  (Keyser 2004b). Likewise, designs incorporating eyes and teeth, and another  with a human arm and hand reaching out from a darkened half of the shield,  have also been interpreted as representing supernatural power in a way that  was intended to frighten or confuse an attacking enemy (Keyser and Kaiser  2014; Schaafsma 2000:113). Other items, such as medicine bundles and bustles also provide an indica- tion of the supernatural basis for precontact Plains warfare. In Historic times,  medicine bundles were derived from visionary imagery in which a spirit helper  instructed the supplicant to acquire protective amulets. The presence of such  bundles at both Bear Gulch and Atherton Canyon is strong indication that  one major premise of precontact warfare was that a man was better off with  supernatural assistance. Likewise, Prince Maximilian noted that many war- riors wore “an appendage of feathers, intended to represent the [buffalo] bull’s  tail, hanging down their backs” (Thomas and Ronnefeldt 1976:202). These  bustles, along with the erected buffalo-bull tail bustles incorporated as part  of the shield were widely understood to symbolize a buffalo bull’s aggres- sive behavior (Maurer 1992:125),11 something that a warrior would be only too  happy to embody and advertise. A Transition from Corporate Combat to Individual Honors Viewing the phalanxes at Bear Gulch and Atherton Canyon as fighting  units, a few observations can be made about the structure of combat-ready  groups in the Late Prehistoric–period culture responsible for drawing Bear  Gulch–style shield-bearing warriors. Chronologically, the earliest phalanxes  (and related single warriors) favored the bow and arrow as the weapon of  choice and a solidly colored, otherwise undecorated, shield for protection. A  100 JAMES D. KEYSER </page> <page sequence="36"> warrior’s headdress was uniformly a tasseled scalplock or a roach. Another  phalanx of similar size and age, shows a slight change in preferred weaponry  to very long spike maces and lances, but the warriors’ shields remain undeco- rated, shown as plain circles without either pigment or scratches for infilling.  Headdresses are tasseled scalplocks, roaches, or bison-horn bonnets. Then, very rapidly over the course of a few generations (150–200 years), pha- lanxes diversified markedly. In this period, each phalanx is typified by a variety  of shield designs, several different weapons (often with unique weapon flags  for decoration), and multiple types of headdresses. Among the warriors com- posing these groups bows are very rarely the preferred weapon. What this tentatively suggests for the ethnic group drawing these figures is  a transition from a fighting unit with a more corporate identity (limited shield  designs, weapon types, and headdress styles) in which individuals intentionally  did not stand out, to a fighting unit more obviously composed of individuals,  where many (if not all) of the participants were readily identifiable. This change,  combined with the more close-up and personal nature of combat (as indicated  by shortened spike maces and clubs, and lances with large killing points), implies  an increased emphasis on personal deeds and individual self-a ggrandizement.  What we appear to be seeing in this transition is the beginning of the Historic- period focus on the accomplishment of individual war honors. ChangIng Warfare Patterns on  the northWestern PlaIns So what do Plains rock art warfare compositions indicate about the origin  and evolution of the Plains warfare complex? To address this, one must first  summarize the model of Plains warfare as reconstructed from ethnohistoric,  ethnographic, and historic sources and then compare and contrast that to  the first-person rock art record of Plains warfare to evaluate how closely the  two correspond. Fortunately, we have one good ethnohistoric account that provides a rea- sonable sketch of Protohistoric-period warfare (and even a glimpse of precon- tact warfare actions), at least through the eyes of one man, Sahkomaupee, an  aged Cree living with the Blackfeet in 1787 (Lewis 1942:46–52; Secoy 1992:34– 37). Several other early accounts provide additional sketchy data about war- fare immediately after the earliest contacts with Euroamericans (e.g., Lewis  1942:45, 50, 54–55; Loendorf and Porsche 1985:80–85). Then the later Historic- period warfare complex is so widely described and well known (e.g., Grinnell  1910; McGinnis 1990; Mishkin 1940; Smith 1938) that it became a cultural icon  WARRIORS AND WEAPONS 101 </page> <page sequence="37"> by the turn of the twentieth century with “Wild West” shows, “dime novels,”  and paintings by Russell and Remington, and it has been celebrated ever since  in books, art, movies, and television. The only detailed account of how northwestern Plains war was fought  before the widespread use of horses and guns is the one Sahkomaupee pro- vided when he told David Thompson in 1787 about how and why warfare was  conducted during his young adulthood (Lewis 1942; Secoy 1992; Thompson  1962). Summarizing Sahkomaupee’s lengthy account, Secoy described pre- horse/pre-gun warfare as: taking two forms. Both put a premium on numerical strength. The first one,  usually preferred, was for a large war party [sometimes as large as several hun- dred warriors] to locate a small, isolated enemy camp . . . and make a surprise  attack at dawn, slaughtering the inhabitants. The second was used when the  enemy was too vigilant to allow a successful surprise attack [because their  scouts were out patrolling], or when both sides were nearly equal in num- bers. . . . Under these conditions the battle was drawn between two opposing  lines of infantry, armed with bows, spears, clubs, and very large leather shields,  the men separated by about three-foot intervals [but not all warriors had  shields and sometimes two men sheltered behind a single shield]. The battle  began when the lines had advanced to a point within archery range of each  other, at which time the warriors, protecting themselves with their shields, sat  on the ground and subjected the opposing line to archery fire for a varying  period. The next stage of the battle arrived when one side decided to substitute  shock for fire. A chief would then lead the . . . charge. . . . The ensuing hand-to- hand struggle would usually be brief and bloody, and the issue quickly decided.  The defeated side would either flee in a complete rout and be hotly pursued  by the enemy warriors until the latter halted to struggle among themselves for  loot, trophies, and scalps, or, if the defeat were not so severe they [the defeated  party] would retreat in a fair state of organization, maintaining the line forma- tion and carrying off their dead and wounded. (Secoy 1992:34, summarizing  Sahkomaupee’s account in Tyrell 1916) Hidatsa oral history shows the corporate nature of such warfare. Describing  a battle that took place about ad 1740, when there were a few horses but no  guns, Bear’s Arm told of separate ranks of shield bearers and bowmen working  together to assault an enemy group taking refuge atop a butte: The men with shields were told to go ahead and all the others would follow  closely behind them in a compact group. Each man, using his bow and arrows,  102 JAMES D. KEYSER </page> <page sequence="38"> was supported by a shield carrier who walked in front to deflect the [enemy]  arrows with his shield, thus protecting the man in back of him. (Bowers 1965:351,  as summarized by Loendorf and Porsche 1985:81) As author of one of the most specific discussions of Plains warfare history,  Lewis has combined Sahkomaupee’s account with other historic sources to  provide a slightly more in-depth model. Lewis argues that pre-horse-period  warfare was largely a corporate action involving hierarchically organized mili- tary forces fighting to expand and/or defend hunting territory and capture  women, whose importance was “to strengthen the tribe, both by their own  numbers and as child bearers” (Lewis 1942:49). Various bits of ethnohistoric  evidence from several sources further suggest that truly effective fighting dur- ing pre-horse times was at close quarters with shock troopers’ weapons, and  effort was focused primarily on amassing superior forces to overrun and anni- hilate small, band-level enemy villages (Lewis 1942:52; McGinnis 1990:4, 6;  Secoy 1992:34). Otherwise, battles between relatively equally matched groups  were apparently hours-long “standoff-type” conflicts where few were wounded  and warriors were rarely killed. Nevertheless, in this system, coups were, in fact,  counted, women were captured, and multiple casualties occasionally occurred.  However, usually this happened only when the victorious force was able to  rout the other, due either to their numerical superiority, or—as these new,  game-changing “weapons” arrived in the region—the presence of the horse or  gun (Lewis 1942:47–48; Secoy 1992:36–37). Following the initial introduction of horses, when a few became available  to warriors, these animals afforded equestrian groups a distinct advantage.  Combined with leather armor and military tactics diffused from the Spanish  Southwest, horses were first heavily armored and typically used somewhat like  “tanks” to crash through enemy defenses and rout opposing pedestrian forces  (Secoy 1992:36–37). Sahkomaupee reported that “the Snake Indians . . . had  Misstutim (Big Dogs, that is Horses) on which they rode, swift as the Deer,  on which they dashed at the [Piegans], and with their stone Pukamoggan  knocked them on the head, and they [the Piegans] had thus lost several of  their best men” (Secoy 1992:36). In a few years, however, the arrival of guns obviated the horse’s advantage  as a tank, but the rapidly expanding horse herds increased the animals’ value  for nearly every aspect of everyday life, from baggage hauling to hunting and  warfare, and the increased supply of horses changed warfare into a series of  quick-hitting surprise attacks and horse raids that relied primarily on stealth  and light cavalry tactics. This sort of warfare was undertaken not by a large  WARRIORS AND WEAPONS 103 </page> <page sequence="39"> force led by a war chief and his various officers, whose intent was to smash an  enemy village or opposing military force, but instead by a highly motivated  individual who handpicked a small cadre of accomplished warriors and kins- men to accompany him in his personal quest to steal horses and acquire war  honors; for it was these horses and coups that embodied a man’s wealth and  gave him status (Lewis 1942:53–59; McGinnis 1990). This horse-and-gun war- fare has been described in intimate historical detail (McGinnis 1990; Mishkin  1940; Smith 1938), often including first-person recollections of famous war- riors who fought both in well-documented battles and in hundreds of other,  nearly anonymous, horse raids (Ewers 1985:171–215; Linderman 1962; Miles  and Lovett 1994, 1995). So, how does the rock art record correspond to this ethnohistoric/ethno- graphic reconstruction? The topic has been previously addressed, albeit with  a much more limited data set that included only the then newly recorded  imagery from Writing-on-Stone and Verdigris Coulee (Keyser 1979). Keyser  (1979:44–48) originally suggested that Plains rock art compositions illustrated  a notable change in both strategy and tactics from Prehistoric- to Historic- period Plains Indian warfare. He contrasted the paucity of individual combat  scenes in Late Prehistoric–period rock art to the commonly depicted scenes  of individual actions that characterize Historic-period rock art, and suggested  that the rock art showed that prehistoric warfare was primarily a large group  activity conducted by shock troops whose motives were essentially economic  (the acquisition and protection of hunting territory), while Historic Plains  warfare focused instead on the individual and his actions—termed coups— which were done primarily for purposes of self-aggrandizement and subse- quently recorded as rock art to validate a warrior’s status.12 As part of his  argument Keyser (1979:45) asserted that “no example of a Prehistoric period  combat or battle scene explicitly depicts a warrior counting coup or acquiring  any war honor,” and in the next paragraph he indicated that the same was true  in Writing-on-Stone’s few Protohistoric-period scenes. More than three decades later we have considerably more information, and  we can modify parts of those conclusions, confirm some, and augment others.  Initially, recording and study of dozens more rock art sites from Canada to Texas  (e.g., Conner 1980; Keyser 1984, 2006a, 2010; Keyser and Klassen 2001; Klassen  1995; Parsons 1987) has identified many more Protohistoric-period images so  that we now have large samples from all three periods for comparison to one  another and to the ethnohistoric record. Furthermore, comparison of these and  other rock art images to Biographic art drawn on robes, war shirts, and in ledger  books (e.g., Brownstone 1993, 2001a, 2001b; Keyser 1987a, 1996, 2000; Keyser  104 JAMES D. KEYSER </page> <page sequence="40"> Figure 3.19. Prehistoric- (e) and Protohistoric-period (a–d) coup counts  occur occasionally in Plains rock art: (a–d) weapon capture; (e) capture of  woman. (a) Ellison’s Rock; (b) Red Canyon; (c, d) Verdigris Coulee; (e) No  Water. Note tear streaks decorating faces in a and b.  and Brady 1993; Keyser and Klassen 2001, 2003; Petersen 1971) has led to the  recognition of readily identifiable coup counts in Protohistoric-period rock art  (Keyser 2006a; 2010:92, 96–98; Keyser and Klassen 2001:224–253; Keyser and  Poetschat 2005:137–155; 2009:83–84; Klassen 1998:55–57) and also even a few in  Late Prehistoric–period imagery (Keyser 2006a; Keyser and Poetschat 2009:84).  Though illustrated in a typically more static, less fluid style than later Historic- period images, these Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric–period coup counts (e.g.,  figure 3.19) show a variety of Biographic conventions, including weapon cap- ture, loser’s posture, the capture hand, floating weapons, capture of women, and  the fusillade of fire that are among the most common in the Biographic art  lexicon (Keyser 1987a, 2006a, 2010; Keyser and Poetschat 2005:153; 2009:84).  These scenes prove unequivocally that coups were counted and documented in  WARRIORS AND WEAPONS 105 </page> <page sequence="41"> precontact warfare, even though fighting was primarily conducted with shock  troops who fought in close-quarters combat with clubs and maces and pro- tected themselves with oversized buffalo-hide shields and, later, their mounts  with leather horse armor. This evidence for coup counting corresponds well to  Sahkomaupee’s description of the aftermath of one such rout: The War Chief . . . rushed on their line and in an instant the whole of us fol- lowed him, the greater part of the enemy took to flight. . . . Part of us pursued  and killed a few, but the chase had soon to be given over, for at the body of every  Snake Indian killed, there were five or six of us trying to get his scalp, or part of  his clothing, his weapons, or something as a trophy of the battle. (Secoy 1992:37) What do rock art warfare compositions indicate about the size of precon- tact war parties and whether these actually became smaller through time?  Late Prehistoric–period rock art warfare compositions are usually war parties  portrayed as ranks of five to more than a dozen warriors (table 3.3). In several  examples these men are shown fighting as interacting groups of four to seven  combatants (figure 3.20). Certainly there are instances where two men square  off one-on-one (e.g., figure 3.18), but these individual combat scenes are pro- portionately far less common in both Late Prehistoric– and Protohistoric- period imagery than they are in Historic-period rock art (table 3.4). But do illustrated rock art forces document the actual sizes of the fighting  forces in these battles? This seems unlikely since Plains Biographic rock art  is renowned for its use of synecdoche, where a drawing of a single weapon  or person or a part of a person or horse can stand for multiple actual persons  or animals. Thus, a hoofprint may stand for a horse, a human footprint for a  warrior, a tipi for a village, or a group of stacked freestanding weapons for a  force of combatants (Fredlund 1990; Keyser 1977a:70; 2000:38, 50–52; 2005:35).  Likewise, in such a system, a group of horses, weapons, or even humans often  indicates the relative size of the force in a fight rather than an actual count of  participants. Essentially, then, a structured group of things often simply indi- cates the concept of “many.” However, given the continuity of structure, context, and content demon- strated for Plains Indian warrior art from the Late Prehistoric, Protohistoric,  and Historic periods (Keyser 1987a, 1996, 2000; Keyser and Klassen 2001;  Keyser and Poetschat 2005:137–169; Klassen 1995, 1998; Magne and Klassen  1991), we can compare the relative size of forces depicted at various times  as an indicator of relative war party size (table 3.3). Across the northwest- ern Plains, almost exactly one-third of Late Prehistoric–period warfare  compositions include five or more warriors. Nearly half of the ranks of Late  106 JAMES D.

Shield-bearing warriors are more often shown fighting in larger groups  with an apparent corporate structure, in contrast to Historic-period combat compositions:  (a) Writing-on-Stone; (b) Williams Coulee; (c) Gateway.  Prehistoric–period warriors obviously prepared for battle at Bear Gulch  and Atherton Canyon include five to 14 men (table 3.3); all equipped more  or less the same. Several other northwestern Plains sites show similar size  forces (Keyser 1977a:69; 1979:43; Keyser and Klassen 2001:238–240; Keyser and  Poetschat 2005:115, 147; Schuster 1987:32). In addition, when actually shown  fighting, these larger forces are bunched together and appear to be interacting  as organized opposing groups (figure 3.20). Direct combat between two Late  Prehistoric–period individuals (figure 3.18; see also Keyser 1977a:68, figure 13a)  is shown far less frequently than in Historic-period rock art. As depicted in rock art, Protohistoric-period warfare is very similar to that  from the Late Prehistoric period (table 3.3). Across the northwestern Plains  about one-third of Protohistoric-period warfare scenes involve five or more  WARRIORS AND WEAPONS 109 </page> <page sequence="45"> men, and at Bear Gulch and Atherton Canyon these are often ranks of war- riors drawn as if awaiting combat. Protohistoric-period combat at other sites  includes smaller fights involving only two or three men (Keyser 1977a:69,  1984:49; Keyser and Poetschat 2005:126–127) and larger ones showing groups  with as many as three or four combatants on each side (figure 3.21). In the  post-horse Protohistoric period these fights often include horsemen, and there  seem to be more examples of hand-to-hand combat between pairs of warriors  (e.g., Keyser 1977a:64, 68; 2010:89, 92; Keyser and Poetschat 2005:141–151). Historic-period warfare is markedly different. By far the great majority of  warriors—70 percent of the 70 warfare scenes—show a single warrior either  fighting a single enemy, stealing horses, taking a weapon, or counting coup on a  structure (figure 3.22, table 3.3). Considering the size of specific fighting forces,  the trend is even more notable, with more than 93 percent of Historic-period  imagery showing single warriors or war parties of two to four combatants, com- pared to only 77 percent of Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric–period forces with  that few people (table 3.4). Thus, while the two biggest battle scenes—one  involving more than 100 people at DgOv–81 at Writing-on-Stone (Keyser  1977a:70; 2004a:84–85) and the other showing 26 combatants at La Barge Bluffs  (Keyser and Poetschat 2005:36)—are far larger than any other rock art compo- sitions, they are a distinct anomaly in all Plains rock art combat images.13 But  synecdoche rules even these large scenes, since the fight reportedly portrayed by  DgOv-81 actually involved hundreds of warriors and resulted in more than 300  reported casualties (Dempsey 2007:29; Keyser and Klassen 2001:254–256). Therefore, acknowledging the significantly synecdochical character of Plains  warrior art we can understand that many if not most of these warfare images  represent more warriors than are portrayed. But the fact that there is such a  greater proportion of Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric–period scenes composed  of relatively large groups of warriors (table 3.4) indicates that war parties in  Prehistoric times were, in fact, actually significantly larger than those common  in Historic times, at least as portrayed in rock art. This fits well with what we  know from Sahkomaupee’s report and the many other sources for late Historic- period warfare. This is also consistent with the existence of bastioned fortifica- tions designed to withstand massed attacks that dominate the Late Prehistoric/ Protohistoric–period Missouri River villages (Bamforth, chapter 1, this volume). The earliest northwestern Plains rock art horses, usually drawn as boat- form animals (Dewdney 1964; Keyser 1977a:34; Keyser and Poetschat 2009;  Keyser and Klassen 2001:19; Keyser et al. 2005), also tell us quite a bit about  Protohistoric-period warfare and enable us to evaluate how well it corresponds  to the ethnohistoric model.

These  animals are illustrated, however, not racing into or out of combat—with rider  leaning forward, quirting his mount, and reaching out to strike an enemy, as  is typical of Historic-period horse-warfare scenes (figure 3.22h)—but instead  typically as one to three animals with their riders often carrying shields (or  sometimes wearing their own body armor), and somewhat ponderously engag- ing pedestrian opponents. The visual effect of these compositions is to show the  horse as a sort of armored tank whose superiority in such shock-troop warfare  is evident in several compositions by the ineffectual spears or arrows attacking  but not killing the animal (occasionally arrows are stuck in the armor), the  relatively exaggerated size of the horses themselves, or the clearly illustrated  WARRIORS AND WEAPONS 111 </page> <page sequence="47"> Figure 3.21.

This Historic-period combat scene at Castle Butte shows that the winning  warrior at right has dismounted (note quirt and footsteps leading to fight) to forfeit the  advantage provided by his horse.  art adds significantly to our understanding of northwestern Plains warfare in  the transitional period from pedestrian to fully equestrian conflict. Finally, Historic-period rock art is replete with images showing individu- als fighting, stealing horses, capturing war booty, and counting coup (Keyser  1977a:68, 73, 1987a, 2007b; Keyser and Poetschat 2005, 2009). Although the  largest known rock art battle compositions occur in Historic-period imagery  (Keyser 1977a:70; 2004a:84–85; Keyser and Klassen 2001:254–255; Keyser and  Poetschat 2005:36, 90), the art is overwhelmingly dominated by illustrations  of individual actions oriented toward earning war honors, with more than 93  percent of warfare scenes involving four or fewer combatants (table 3.4). This  rock art correlates almost exactly with the warfare strategy and tactics so well  documented in historic and ethnographic records. ConClusIons Comparisons among Late Prehistoric–, Protohistoric-, and Historic-period  rock art warfare illustrations show that these correspond quite closely to the  114 JAMES D. KEYSER </page> <page sequence="50"> changing pattern of northern Plains warfare posited from the ethnohistoric  and ethnographic record (Lewis 1942:46–59; McGinnis 1990:1–48; Secoy  1992:33–77). But rock art images also add significant information not avail- able from ethnohistory. Bear Gulch and Atherton Canyon provide the richest  record yet available for arms, accoutrements, and battle tactics from precontact  times, and even highlight major psychological motives for how and why war  was fought on the northern Plains of central Montana during the pre-horse/ pre-gun Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods. With these incredibly  detailed images as a basis, we finally have a first-person account of how and  why war was fought during that time. Data from Bear Gulch and Atherton Canyon, when combined with evi- dence from other sites across the region, provide both strong support and  some corrections and elaborations for Sahkomaupee’s account. In terms of  weaponry, Sahkomaupee’s and Bear’s Arm’s experiences reflect more bow- men—at least in Protohistoric-period conflict—than we see in rock art, and  thus more archery action than is apparent from the data for all Plains shield- bearing warriors. This may reflect a real difference, or it may simply be due to  rock art artists’ desire to portray themselves with the weapons that put them  in close contact with the enemy. It must be noted, however, that of the four  known battle scenes in Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric–period rock art (fig- ures 3.20b, 3.21e), only two show a single bowman each (Keyser and Klassen  2001:229, 240, 247). Correspondingly, we have no battle formations that show  different ranks of shield carriers and bowmen without shields bringing up  the rear, as was reported by Bear’s Arm. The only indication we have of sig- nificant bow-and-arrow warfare is the one shield bearer in the Protohistoric- period coup-count tally who is facing 22 arrows. Whether this is an enemy  killed by overwhelming firepower or the artist/author of this tally braving an  enemy fusillade of fire, it clearly shows that some battles featured intensive  bow-and-arrow fire. Likewise, Sahkomaupee does not specifically mention spike maces even  though they are quite common in the Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric–period  imagery at many northwestern Plains sites, including Bear Gulch, Atherton  Canyon, Writing-on-Stone, Verdigris Coulee, Pictograph Cave, the North  Cave Hills, and Red Canyon (Francis and Loendorf 2002:149; Keyser 1977a:68,  69; 1984:32; 2004a:21; Keyser and Klassen 2001:196, 199, 246; Mulloy 1958:126).  For this weapon it seems likely that Sahkomaupee simply included them in  his reported “clubs.” Sahkomaupee’s account also mentions scouts, taking scalps, capturing war  trophies, and the fact that forces lined up in ranks often with some warriors  WARRIORS AND WEAPONS 115 </page> <page sequence="51"> who fought without shields. If we consider the taking of scalps and war tro- phies in precontact warfare as equivalent to how these same acts were treated  as coups in Historic times, it suggests that other coups were almost certainly  also counted by Prehistoric/Protohistoric–period combatants. Hence, exam- ples of all of Sahkomaupee’s observations can be found in the rock art data. But what of taking women and children as captives? Although Sahkomaupee  was apparently silent on this subject, Secoy (1992:38) notes that at least as early  as Protohistoric times, war captives quickly became a valuable trade com- modity in the effort to obtain Euroamerican trade goods, and he cites several  examples of large-scale capture of women and children on the eastern margins  of the Plains in the 1600s (Secoy 1992:41). The occurrence of several capture  scenes at Bear Gulch, coupled with the fact that by the late 1700s north- western Plains tribes were regularly capturing women and children to replace  fallen warriors and to augment groups hard hit by early smallpox epidemics  (Ewers 1997:194; Keyser et al. 2006:65), strongly suggests that war captives  must also have been important in precontact warfare. Rock art data also provide significant information about the spiritual  aspects of warfare that was not reported by Sahkomaupee. By reference to  Historic Plains Indian cultural practices, we can make some particularly  detailed conclusions about Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric-period warfare. For  instance, shield heraldry includes both anthropomorphic and zoomorphic  symbolism and compositional structures like those prevalent on Historic- period shields. By using analogy, we discover that these indicate that warriors  routinely obtained strong supernatural power to assist them in their warfare  actions. Furthermore, the structure of several heraldic designs suggests that in  part they were emblazoned on their shields specifically for the shock value of  frightening enemies. Finally, supernatural power was also embodied in medi- cine bundles, various headdresses, and even feather bustles that symbolized  aggressive behavior as a warrior’s desired quality. These are all directly analo- gous to similar items used in Historic times. Thus, the rock art record confirms and expands Sahkomaupee’s observations  of many aspects of Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric-period warfare. Finally, if one  carefully considers rock art warfare compositions and their structure in light of  the synecdoche characteristic of Plains Indian warrior art, it is clear that the rock  art data do, indeed, indicate larger military forces in Late Prehistoric times, fol- lowed by a transition to smaller war parties in the Historic period. So what light does this shed on the likely motivations for warriors in various  periods of Plains warfare? Historic-period Biographic art images are primar- ily concerned with recording an individual’s actual personal honors—achieved  116 JAMES D. KEYSER </page> <page sequence="52"> in horse raids and combat defending one’s own herds from enemies. One-on- one fights where the protagonist touches or kills his enemy or takes his weapon  or another war trophy are more than half again as common in Historic-period  rock art as in the combined Late Prehistoric/Protohistoric-period imagery  (tables 3.3, 3.4). In contrast, Late Prehistoric and many Protohistoric-period  warfare-related scenes are better characterized as corporate images, where  cooperating groups of warriors are shown in a battle-ready state, and when  they are fighting it is as a more or less organized group. This is exactly the  difference illustrated between Sahkomaupee’s report of Protohistoric-period  fighting and the fighting that is so well documented in most Historic-period  warfare. Of course Sahkomaupee reports that group cohesion broke down on  both sides during a routed enemy’s disorganized retreat, and ultimately—as  the Protohistoric-period scenes of V-neck humans at Bear Gulch so strongly  attest—warriors were out to earn honors by taking scalps and war trophies.  However, it was not until the horse provided a ready source of a relatively eas- ily captured commodity, and a mechanism for increasing the fluidity of war  parties and their effective range of influence, that small-scale, personal actions  became paramount in Plains warfare illustrations. aCknoWledgMents The research at Bear Gulch and Atherton Canyon has benefited from the  support of many people and organizations. Macie Lundin Ahlgren and the  Royal Melton family graciously provided access to Bear Gulch and Atherton  Canyon. Funding was provided by the Oregon Archaeological Society,  Montana Archaeological Society, Greer Services, and more than 30 private  donors. Among the latter I particularly want to thank Jean M. and Ray B.  Auel, David Easly, Carol Garner and Marty Geller, Fred and Jeri Kawabata,  Mike and Kellee Taylor, George and Cathy Poetschat, and Alison Stenger.  David A. Kaiser and George Poetschat assisted with this research in several  ways and Jean Harris constructed the tables. notes  1. See Keyser et al. (2012) for a discussion of how elements, motifs, and images differ  and how this affects comparison of tabulated imagery between sites. In this regard, the  same relative size ranking would be true if we tallied images or motifs for Bear Gulch  and Atherton Canyon versus other large Plains sites or site complexes. It should also  be noted that Bear Gulch is spatially smaller—and Atherton Canyon only modestly  WARRIORS AND WEAPONS 117 </page> <page sequence="53"> larger—than DgOv-2, by far the largest individual site in the Writing-on-Stone site  complex. In summary, by any measure both Bear Gulch and Atherton Canyon are as  large and complex as any other concentration of northwestern Plains rock art.  2. For imagery to compare to the Bear Gulch/Atherton Canyon shield-bearing  warriors, I originally used a database of shield-bearing warriors that (as of 2006)  included all known published shield-bearing warrior images. Throughout the chap- ter, when making comparative statements, it is this sample of warriors to which I  am referring. Certainly, there are many other shield bearers known at rock art sites  across the region that were not yet published when this chapter was written, but these  could not be considered here because they were unavailable to me. A shield-bearing  warrior compendium, completed long after this chapter was finalized, has since been  published (Keyser and Poetschat 2014) and contains data on more than 600 northern  Plains shield-bearing warriors at sites other than Bear Gulch and Atherton Canyon.  This was the entire sample of this motif—published and unpublished—known at the  time of publication. Superficial comparison of the results reported here with the data  in that compendium shows no significant discrepancies between the sample used from  the 2006 database and that in the compendium.  3. Throughout this discussion I use Secoy’s (1992) warfare patterns since his is still  the best summary of how the expanding frontiers of European firearms and horses  influenced Plains warfare.  4. Elsewhere on the northern Plains, bows are also rarely depicted as the shield- bearing warrior’s weapon of choice. Possibly this is due to the difficulty of using a bow  while burdened with the large shield, but the number of early Bear Gulch–style bow- men at Bear Gulch indicates that for some engagements it predominated. The number  of bowmen at Bear Gulch and Atherton Canyon who do not carry shields is also quite  small (15 of the 208 humans other than shield bearers). While this percentage is not  quite double the number of shield bearers who are bowmen, 6 of the 15 other humans  with bows are shown in hunting scenes. Hence, the number of bowmen who are shown  as warriors is almost exactly the same among both shield bearers and other humans.  5. The same drawing of this weapon is erroneously identified as a goad in another  publication on Bodmer’s art (Thomas and Ronnefeldt 1976:60), but that identification  was not made with access to the actual artifact in Bodmer’s collection. The form of this  piece unequivocally indicates that it was a war club.  6. Since publication of that 2008 article the bow-spear painted at the sixth site in  Big Coulee, Montana, has been called to my attention (Keyser et al. 2012:123).  7. “Hand of God” is used here not to imply that Plains Indians had a monotheistic  view of a single personified God. However, this depiction is undeniably a human arm  and hand. Elsewhere, Keyser and Kaiser (2014) suggest that the being whose hand and  arm is represented may be something similar to Long Arm, a popular mythological  118 JAMES D. KEYSER </page> <page sequence="54"> being who “lives in the sky, where you cannot get at him; but he can hurt you, for his  arm is so long that it reaches from the heavens to the earth” (Matthews 1877:69). Ver- sions of Long Arm are found among the Mandan, Hidatsa, Lakota, and Crow, and  long arms, apparently interceding from the heavens to the world of mortals are drawn  at several northern Plains rock art sites.  8. The capture hand is a Plains Biographic art convention used to show several  things including touching an enemy to count coup and capturing an enemy woman or  a war trophy (Keyser and Poetschat 2012:40–44).  9. See note 2.  10. The V-neck warriors at Bear Gulch and Atherton Canyon have been identified  as belonging to a Blackfoot style of this image based on extensive analysis of both rock  art and early painted bison robes and war shirts (Brownstone 2001a; Keyser 2006a, 2011;  Keyser et al. 2012:233–237, 349–350). Characteristic size and shape (including the occa- sional V-neck hourglass body shape), features such as heartlines and kidneys, types of  associated figures, and characteristic accoutrements (such as weapons and ceremonial  feather fans) are the basis on which such an identification is made. Certainly there are  other V-neck figures in Plains rock art that are the product of other tribal artists.  11. Maurer (1992:125) actually notes that the buffalo bull’s urination, which is  shown on several Crow shields, is “an observed detail of natural behavior that is  associated with mating, aggression, and the marking of territory.” It must be noted,  however, that the posture of an aggressive buffalo bull also always shows a raised tail  (Maurer 1992:125–126, 248), and thus, this attribute is equally indicative of the bull’s  aggressive attitude.  12. Certainly some of the motive was economic (e.g., the capture of horses), but the  point made in the 1979 article is worth making again—that is, if the primary motive  for Historic-period Plains warfare were economic, it would make no sense to rank  stealing a picketed horse from in front of an enemy’s tipi higher than running off his  entire herd, nor would touching an enemy be ranked higher than killing him.  13. It should be noted that this analysis does not consider Biographic tally com- positions from any period. Such tallies found in both the Protohistoric and Historic  periods contain from 10 to more than 100 human figures and/or weapons.  14. Keyser (2010:96) has suggested, based on the relative sizes of the shields, that  one Writing-on-Stone scene shows such a pedestrian fight between one warrior  equipped with a large, pedestrian-sized shield and a second unmounted equestrian  combatant, who carries a smaller shield, but unlike many Historic-period art scenes  there is no indication (e.g., quirt, footprints leading to the fight, a horse standing by)  that the motivation of the warrior with the smaller, post-horse-period shield was to  forfeit his equestrian advantage. Very likely, he simply was engaged in this combat in  the absence of his horse. WARRIORS AND WEAPONS 119 </page> </plain_text>
