<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMMUNICATIONS VAN ALSTYNE ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RELIGION: AN ALTERNATIVE VIEW TO THE EDITOR: Van Alstyne's "quest for a coherent posi- tion" regarding the constitutional separation of church and state, in the December 1963 issue of this REVIEW, suffers from certain elementary defects. It begins by citing the wide disagree- ment ". . . as to the applied meaning of the opaque language of the religion clause," and proposes as its first (though least significant) objective to ". . . make clear which parts of the storm are entitled to be taken seriously and which are merely bluster." But its three more significant purposes all presuppose the correct- ness of the Supreme Court's actual understand- ing of church-state separation. Thus, contrary to first impression, Van Alstyne is not engaged in a quest for something as yet unknown but in the clarification of something already dis- covered and generally followed by the Court. In an area where disagreement admittedly abounds, however, he should first demonstrate why the Court's actual position (the immediate cause of the disagreement) deserves to be fol- lowed. And to do this he would have to explore the alternative positions with impartiality and care: no other method will serve his first objec- tive-that of distinguishing the serious from the non-serious criticisms of the Court. It is therefore surprising, and shocking to some, to be immediately confronted by a fiat deciding in favor of the Court's position on the basis of nothing more than the Court's own authority. Since 1947, we are told, the Court has pronounced so consistently and emphati- cally on the various unacceptable views of the establishment clause that ". . . there is no prac- tical benefit in re-evaluating them once again," and, again, that arguments in favor of such views ". . are no longer presentable in the Court" (p. 867). Away, then, disagreement, and begone bluster-the Court has spoken. But who, other than those already committed to the Court's position in this matter or narrow legal practitioners bent only on winning cases, will be persuaded by Van Alstyne's assevera- tions? Have we not heard of a Dred Scott decision that stood for at least thirteen years- all wrong? Are we not told that in Plessy v. Ferguson Justice Brown and the majority were wrong, and Justice Harlan right, for fifty-eight years? Do we not generally acknowledge decades of mistaken decisions excessively favor- able to property rights? Are there not liberals among us still objecting to the Court's constant upholding of the Smith Act ever since 1951? Why, then, does a Supreme Court position on separation of church and state going back to 1947 suddenly become hallowed and unassail- able? Naturally, nothing is more apt to pre- serve this position than the widespread notion that it is already permanent. At two crucial points within the body of his essay Van Alstyne's argumentation shows a similar weakness. He holds that one political objective of the religion clause, as rightly inter- preted by the Court, is "to respect the integrity of non-believers by disabling government from lending its authority in behalf of religion" (p. 868). In arriving at this view he insists that the establishment clause prohibits non-prefer- ential assistance of every kind to all religion, and he tries to extend the free exercise clause so that it too works in the direction of protecting both religion and irreligion. Without entering upon the difficulties inherent in the word "establishment" (which Van Alstyne never seriously considers), it is enough to reject the implausible view that the framers of the First Amendment took the word "religion" to mean all religious and irreligious beliefs. The free exercise of atheism and agnosticism is not protected by the free exercise clause because only a ludicrous violation of general usage, today and even more so in 1789, would call these "religions" and forbid their establishment as well as protect their exercise. Van Alstyne supports his view not by argu- ment but by citation from the Court itself- i.e., by authority. He tells us that the Court has identified Secular Humanism as a religion, and that Julian Huxley describes his own "evolutionary humanism" as a religion (p. 873). But is "religion" a term every individual can define for himself? Is every "philosophy of life" a religion, however emphatically it re- nounces the very idea of a divine principle? Is every group banding together for the further- ance of moral purposes (such as the Ethical Culture Society) a religion? Surely any defini- tion that would logically result in the Boy. Scouts being called a religion is open to more doubt and skepticism than Van Alstyne ex- presses. The quotations he supplies from Torcaso, Zorach, Everson and McGowan (p. 868) all affirm, as their central point, the idea that the 392</page><page sequence="2">COMMUNICATIONS 393 religious clauses of the First Amendment forbid forcing religious belief or disbelief on anybody. But are there not ways of publicly or officially expressing and approving religion in a non- preferential way that do not amount to "establishment" and do not interfere with the free exercise of religion? At President Ken- nedy's inauguration, representatives of the three major religions of the country partici- pated in the ceremony. God is invoked in our pledge of allegiance, motto and anthem. Are these clearly unconstitutional "establish- ments?" The language of the Constitution by itself would not suggest that the protection of non- religion and irreligion from governmental coercion derives from the religious clauses of the First Amendment. Simply put, preventing an establishment of religion does not guarantee freedom from governmental coercion to athe- ism, and the free exercise of religion does not include the free exercise of atheism. Even the only other phrase in the Constitution mention- ing religion-the prohibition of a religious test for public office in Article VI-may have been intended more for the protection it would afford the diversity of religious believers than for the protection it would also afford atheists. Atheists may therefore undoubtedly hold public office, but it would seem from the lan- guage of the Constitution that the only general protection for their living lives free from governmental coercion must be derived from the later non-religious parts of the First Amendment-from those guaranteeing free- dom of speech, press and assembly. Here is the likely source of safeguards for the expression of atheism and the assembling of atheists, to men- tion the extreme case only. But these safe- guards, while broad, are not as broad as those afforded religious believers by the First Amendment taken as a whole. By all interpre- tations, the religious clauses forbid government from favoring the beliefs of a specific religion, but it is far from certain that no public en- couragement can constitutionally be given to religion as such-or to all religions if it can be done without hurting any. If such encourage- ment is indeed permissible under the religious clauses of the First Amendment, it would not be forbidden by the clauses protecting atheists, agnostics or other non-believers in their speech, press and assembly. The religious clauses in- tend, above all, to protect religious belief, while the other clauses protect not belief but public expression and action. Government might therefore constitutionally encourage religion (and discourage irreligion) without in any way infringing on the rights of atheists so long as atheists are not prevented from speak- ing and assembling in their own right or com- pelled to speak against their will. This is the line of interpretation toward which a plain rather than a contrived interpre- tation of the Constitution would incline us. The Constitution is not clearly neutral between religion and irreligion; on the contrary, if any- thing it shows itself more favorably disposed to religion than to irreligion. Nevertheless, unless it can be shown that there is a vital public need for the public encouragement of religion, the whole question may have only theoretical im- portance. To show that there is such a need, we must begin by picturing the state of affairs in church-state relations toward which the present Court is pointed by the logic of "complete separation" or "strict neutrality." Although Van Alstyne does not accept Justice Douglas's determination in Engel to consider even the slightest public assistance to religion unconsti- tutional, he would clearly take further steps in this direction-for example, in connection with "religious slogans enacted by Congress into law" and prayers in the public schools (pp. 868, 869, 881). Yet the issue posed by Justice Douglas remains the crucial one: is not each and every public encouragement of religion unconstitutional, including the invocations of God by public officials, mottos on coins, and a whole variety of greater or lesser transgressions of absolute separation? The logic of the Court was originally established in Everson's hallmark passage calling for such separation, and though that passage was written by Black, Douglas alone has pushed for its full consequences. Either the logic of Everson will work itself out in decision after decision, steadily denuding the public of every vestige of religion, or some new principle will be found to justify calling a halt to this process. But the choice between these alternatives involves a problem of policy as well as constitutionality, and it cannot be de- cided wisely without inquiring whether a free society is served by the public encouragement of religion. Judging from the political point of view-the view we all share as citizens-religion is a part of free society and may either contribute to or detract from its well-working. According to Tocqueville, it (religion) is much more needed in democratic republics than in any others. How is it possible that society should escape destruction if the moral tie is not strengthened in proportion as the poli- tical tie is relaxed? And what can be done with a people who are their own masters if they are not submissive to the Deity?</page><page sequence="3">394 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW And Bryce echoes him: The more democratic republics become, the more the masses grow conscious of their own power, the more do they need to live, not only by patriotism, but by reverence and self-control, and the more essential to their well-being are those sources whence reverence and self-control flow. This point, and its implications, can be appreci- ated by liberals and conservatives alike. Both can see the immense importance to our society of the idea that the rights of men are not mere human inventions or conveniences and that the only legitimate aim of government is to secure these rights. This, after all, is what Jefferson attempted to teach in the Declaration of Independence-the same Jefferson who later authored the much-abused "wall of separation" phrase. But, in addition, a society stressing individual rights and individual self-care is in need of a balancing stress on duties and human brotherhood, and this element is best supplied not by the teaching of the Declaration but by our Biblical religious tradition. In order to consecrate the aims of our republic and renew our dedication to them, it is fitting that the ideas of God, created men, rights and duties receive public expression, approval and en- couragement. In this way religion, within the requirements of the First Amendment, can constitutionally serve to foster those attitudes and beliefs necessary and proper to the struc- ture of government established in the Constitu- tion itself. Thus, the official motto "In God We Trust" is neither more nor less constitutional than the public use of flags, pledges and anthems as such. A more mundane argument is also relevant and cogent. Members of the executive and legislative branches, paying no attention to the Court's words on this subject, continue to invoke religious symbols on solemn and public occasions, in circumstances that do not make a ''case or controversy." A long list of actions and usages that cannot logically be reconciled with a rigid doctrine of complete separation are thereby immune to judicial review. Is it sensible for the Court to commit itself to a formula so inflexible that it implies a futile condemnation of coordinate constitutional authorities, acting in their own spheres, when the formula is mocked in everyday practices that the Court cannot control? A line of reasoning acknowledged by Van Alstyne would, if perfected, offer a sound con- stitutional basis for the encouragement of religion. He admits that the use of religion (e.g., prayers) may have secular effects the state has a right to promote (p. 877). He mentions that school prayers were partly de- fended by the states employing them on the ground of promoting morality rather than religion per se (p. 875). But he quotes Justice Brennan to the effect that ". . . government may not employ religious means to serve secu- lar interests, however legitimate they may be, at least without the clearest demonstration that nonreligious means will not suffice (p. 878). No more is needed to construct a weighty case in favor of the public encouragement of religion, provided that "the clearest demonstra- tion" does not require a kind of proof beyond the capacity of human experience and wisdom ever to offer. Certainly this consideration-one of the most important in the history of political philosophy-should have been explored in Van Alstyne's essay. One final point. Van Alstyne specifically denies that any prayer, and, by implication, any verbal invocation of the deity-can really be nonpreferential and nonsectarian (p. 871). But, first, it is both closer to our tradition and intrinsically wiser to allow for possible consti- tutional uses of religion than to declare all such uses unconstitutional in principle. In the second place, however, it is far from certain that agreement cannot be obtained from those be- lievers in God still comprising the vast major- ity and for whom alone the free exercise clause was originally intended; in fact, they are in very widespread agreement on many public uses of religion right now. If this condition is met, the non-believer's freedom of speech con- stitutionally protects him against being forced to express himself as if he were a believer. He should therefore be permitted to abstain or withdraw from such utterance, but it should not be necessary for the state to keep every social as well legal pressure from being exerted upon him should he choose to abstain. The law cannot rightly compel him to conform to belief and expression, but it need not and should not cease to favor religion because of him. The precise wording of the First Amend- ment permits this; the national need enjoins it. I have dwelled on certain elements of Van Alstyne's essay to show its intrinsic weakness constitutionally and prudentially. Its tacit assumption that the public will equably bear further steps toward removing public support from religion is also open to challenge. The distinct possibility of widespread discord being precipitated, with consequent danger to the Court's status in our constitutional scheme of things, should prompt lovers of their country and the Court to seek an alternative. We need a clear constitutional principle permitting something short of absolute separation of</page><page sequence="4">COMMUNICATIONS 395 church and state without sacrificing religious liberty. Van Alstyne tried to inject into his dis- cussion of the whole issue an awareness of its various aspects and subtleties. Unfortunately, by permitting the Court to determine his prem- ises for him he was driven, willy nilly, in the direction staked out by Justice Douglas and thus toward a worse "simplistic dogmatism" than the one he sought to avoid. Only a less worshipful attitude toward the Court's prem- ises can serve as the basis of the real quest still to be undertaken. DAVID LOWENTHAL Wheaton College A BRIEF REPLY TO THE EDITOR: Without disparagement, Professor Lowen- thal's criticisms are reducible to the following four propositions: (1) An article which in part clarifies the Supreme Court's position respecting the separa- tion of church and state serves little purpose, because most of the Court's critics already have a clear understanding of what they are criticizing; it is the Court's "actual position" which is "the immediate cause of the disagreement." (2) It is indefensible to express even qualified approval of the Court's construction of the First Amendment, without some demonstration in the article itself that that construction is "correct" other than because the Court says so. (3) Alternative constructions urged by others should have been examined within the article, to determine why they are any less desirable or correct; in the absence of such a comparison, there is no reason why the course marked out by the Court "deserves to be followed."1 (4) A more desirable construction of the First Amendment would be based on the propositions that non-preferential governmental aid to theistic religions is constitutional, and that non-theists are adequately protected without reference to the religion clauses. The first three of these, succinctly stated, carry their own refutation, t believe, on their face and in the circumstances in which I was writing. I shall confine myself here to the fourth. In opting for a construction of the First Amendment different from that evolved by the Court, he argues toward the conclusion 1 Whether he means this in the sense that no one ought to comply with the decisions of the Court unless he is personally satisfied as to their correctness (as Governors Wallace and Barnet seem to believe), or whether he means that the Court should be urged to alter its position (as in Brown v. Board of Education), or that the Consti- tution should be amended (as after Dred Scott), I cannot presume to say. that non-preferential aid to (theistic) religion as such should be allowed as a matter of consti- tutional law. The conclusion is supported by what is offered as a "plain . . . interpretation of the Constitution, " and a "policy" which recognizes a "vital public need for the public [i.e., governmental] encouragement of religion." A few of the difficulties in this position are these: (1) There is no plain meaning on the face of the Establishment Clause, and the weight of the evidence respecting the understanding of its principal sponsors, James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, supports the view that it was meant to separate all religious matters from governmental processes as far as practicable. (2) Professor Lowenthal has failed to demon- strate any need for state support of religion, and there is significant evidence that governmental support of religion is not needed and that it might well be detrimental to religion itself. The churches in fact are thriving. (3) The virtual impossibility of providing governmental aid of a genuinely non-preferential character, even among theisms, renders the sug- gested standard worthless to serve the very need which called it into being. (4) Such little aid as might become available would necessarily reintroduce into the civil proc- ess the very kind of religious strife which the Court has wisely attempted to discourage, and would further isolate the non-conformist from a position of equality under the law. These objections could be developed at some length; the exigencies of space limit me to the last two. Significant state support on a non-preferential basis among theisms? It is remarkable that while Professor Lowenthal insists that govern- mental support for religion on a non-preferen- tial basis is greatly needed, he does not provide us with a single example of aid which would be permissible by that test. Rather, it is described only as "non-preferential assistance," "some- thing short of absolute separation of church and state," and something agreeable to "be-</page><page sequence="5">396 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW lievers in God still comprising the vast major- ity." It is doubtful whether any significant illustration can be given which would genuinely comply even with his rock-bottom constitu- tional test for neutrality, i.e., non-preferential among all theisms (although not neutral with respect to non-theists). Certainly state financial aid to religious schools would not qualify, for it would not be of equal benefit to all theistic religions. Not all sects rely upon such institutions to win or keep adherents to their faith, and those who do not would be significantly disadvantaged in being obliged to pay taxes for the support of their competitors who do. The preferential character of such aid is nicely attested by the fact that proposals to extend aid to religious schools have been opposed by a number of religious denom- inations-principally those which eschew paro- chial education as a necessary or proper part of their religion. It is helpful to note, in this con- nection, that one of the early religious bills opposed by Madison in Virginia was a tax bill for the support of all religions, Christian, "Mohammedan, Hindu or what have you."2 Similarly, no governmentally supported prayer would be permissible, because even among acknowledged theisms, there is wide disagreement respecting the assumptions con- tained within a given prayer. The Regents of New York were mistaken, for instance, in sup- posing that even the following prayer was equally acceptable to all faiths: Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our country.3 A number of faiths take exception to the very first word, "almighty," their position being that God is not almighty and that to insist other- wise is to commit blasphemy by holding Him responsible for the sins, crimes, diseases, and corruption so readily apparent in nature and mankind. The next word, "God," is also prefer- ential, for not all theisms are monotheisms; the singling out of one god as the God is not in keeping with Hinduism, for instance, and that was a faith acknowledged even at the time the First Amendment was drafted. To acknowledge "dependence" upon God is not consistent with the position held by some deists in the eight- eenth century, and some theists today, who regard God merely as a primordial first cause: God set the universe in motion much like a 2 Brant, James Madison, The Nationalist (New York, 1948), pp. 344-45. 3 Reproduced in Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 422 (1962). clock, but is not responsive to prayer. Sim- ilarly, to invoke God's blessing for one's country is distasteful to a number of conscien- tious theists who regard God as less nationalis- tic and more cosmic than some. Even were some prayer devisable to reflect a core religion, a number of faiths are opposed to the speaking of prayers in public or in unison. Indeed, as one surveys the range of theistic religions in the United States, from the most credulous forms of primitive anthropomorphism still popular in rustic parts, to the most scholastic theologies in other parts, he cannot fairly deduce any form of specific assistance equally deferential to them all. Finally, I would submit that religion itself cannot reasonably be restricted in its constitu- tional and free exercise sense to theisms alone. One need not rely upon references to James, Dewey, Huxley, Taoism, humanism, or ethical culture for support, for as thoughtful a theo- logian as Paul Tillich has seen fit to concur: Every human being has an ultimate concern, al- though not everybody calls it God. Not even the BIuddhists call it God but everyone knows it is a religion. And so I would say that they ... have their expressions of what the meaning of their life is and they are committed to it. They are often even willing to sacrifice most of their life or their whole life to it if necessary, and for this reason I would call them religions or, with a more tech- nical word, quasi-religions.4 Discord avoided and non-theists adequately protected? As a matter of policy and law, a test of non-preferential aid among theisms will not permit the kind of state aid which Professor Lowenthal evidently feels is needed, and this fact by itself argues convincingly against the acceptance of that test. On the other hand, to hold that such state aid is theoretically avail- able is to encourage the very kind of religious rivalries and internecine conflicts among theisms which should be avoided and can be better avoided through the standard adopted by the Supreme Court. That standard attempts to free the civil process from religious discord, while fully protecting each religion's right to compete for success in the marketplace of ideas and faiths. Let me last respond to Professor Lowenthal's insistence that those who are not theists receive all the protection they deserve from other parts of the Constitution, and that they ought not to be regarded as having any legitimate interest in the free exercise or establishment clauses of the 4 Tillich, "The Sum and Substance," University of Southern California Alumni Review, Vol. 44 (1963), 11, 13.</page><page sequence="6">COMMUNICATIONS 397 First Amendment. The response is contained in the following case. In 1948, Congress amended the Selective Service Act to limit draft exemptions for con- scientious objectors to those basing their objec- tion on a belief in "a Supreme Being." The exemption is still available today, whether or not the theistic objection might be regarded in some cases as naive, undeveloped, or com- pletely lacking in reflective judgment. The courts are not entitled to decide the rationality of the theistic objection, only its sincerity.5 This is as it should be, for to hold otherwise would be to reduce constitutional protection of the free exercise of religion to that which the state itself decided was rational. On the other hand, a religious objection to military service not bottomed on a belief in a Supreme Being does not qualify under the Selective Service Act. Under Professor Lowenthal's view, it ought not to qualify, since the free exercise clause is exclusively a haven for theists. Now we come to a specific case, testing whether the conscientious objector in question is adequately protected by other parts of the Constitution. The defendant in this case is the son of an exceptionally religious Roman Catho- lic family, an honor student in high school with an excellent academic record and with no record of any previous legal difficulties. When sum- moned for the draft, he considers the question of military service carefully, and finally con- cludes that conscientiously he cannot serve: My decision arises from what I believe to be con- siderations of validity from the standpoint of the welfare of humanity and the preservation of the democratic values which we in the United States are struggling to maintain. I have concluded that war, from the practical standpoint, is futile and self-defeating, and that from the more important moral standpoint, it is unethical. He is examined by a Hearing Officer of the Justice Department and investigated by the FBI. With the benefit of the FBI report, the Officer concludes that the defendant, is "a truthful, decent young citizen who conscienti- ously objects to joining in any manner any activity which would bear on military affairs." Under the statute, however, it is not enough that his objection be conscientious. It must, as well, rest on a belief in a Supreme Being. Un- fortunately for him, it does not: [He was anxious to explain that] skepticism or disbelief in the existence of God does not neces- sarily mean lack of faith in anything whatso- 6 See United States v. Ballard, 322 U.S. 78 (1944). ever.... Such personages as Plato, Aristotle and Spinoza evolved comprehensive ethical systems of intellectual and moral integrity without belief in God, except in the remotest sense. Finally, rejecting dependence upon his Creator for a guide to morality, [he] asserted "more re- spect for . .. belief in and devotion to goodness and virtue for their own sakes, and a religious faith in a purely ethical creed. When he is prosecuted for refusing to submit to military induction, he relies upon the First Amendment's religion clause and the Fifth Amendment's implied equal protection clause by way of defense. In keeping with Professor Lowenthal's preference for theism, however, the district court should (and does) brush these objections aside: (a) The free exercise clause of the First Amend- ment is not violated because it protects only the exercise of those whose religion is based upon a belief in a Supreme Being. Such a belief is not involved in this case, as the defendant readily admits. (b) The equal protection clause is not violated because it is reasonable for Congress to distinguish between those whose objection is theistic in char- acter and those whose objection is not theistic, in deciding who shall be exempt from military serv- ice. (c) The establishment clause is not violated, because the exemption provided for theists is non-sectarian. In any case, defendant has no standing to contest this issue. So this young man should be sentenced to prison, while others basing their objection to military service on some belief in a Supreme Being enjoy civilian status. Professor Lowen- thal's standard operates neatly: it is all right to exempt the theists, for religion should receive "public encouragement," unrestricted by the establishment clause which might otherwise rule it out; it is all right to jail this man, how- ever, for his is not the kind of religion which the free exercise clause meant to protect equal- ly with all others. Somewhere, however, we may suspect that the First Amendment really has been mocked here; most certainly, this is an instance where the other parts of the Constitu- tion scarcely afford equal respect for the in- tegrity of non-theists. A Constitution as insensitive as this would hardly be worth expounding. Happily, the Supreme Court has not expounded it in this fashion. And when this very case was appealed to the Circuit Court, which understood religion to reflect a breadth of philosophy including</page><page sequence="7">398 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW that which was bravely held by this young man, the conviction was reversed. The holding was that a classification for draft exemption purposes, based solely on an objection accord- ing to the dictates of a Supreme Being, is arbitrary; religion in the First Amendment is not limited to theisms, and a classification based on theism consequently denies the equal protection of the laws.6 6 United States v. Seeger, 326 F. 2d 846 (2d Cir. 1964). Earlier quotations in the text are taken from the case report which warrants a complete reading. For an admirable discussion of "religion" in a slightly different context, see Fellowship of Humanity v. Alameda, 153 Cal. App. 2d 673, 315 P.2d 394 (1957). The issue as of 1964 has thus developed to this extent. The free exercise of religious convic- tions is broadly protected from governmental restraint whether or not the religion in question is based on the mysteries or miracles of divinity. And, under the establishment clause, the suc- cess or failure of religious institutions is made to depend essentially on their own vigorous competition for communicants, unaided, as unencumbered by the government. I am hope- ful that few will see in this arrangement any "sacrificing [of] religious liberty," any "wor- shipful attitude" toward the Supreme Court, or any occasion for the caliber of the protest advanced by Professor Lowenthal. WILLIAM W. VAN ALSTYNE Duke University Law School BROWNLOW ON THE LEGISLATIVE REORGANIZATION ACT TO THE EDITOR: In his letter to Richard Neustadt, which appears in the December, 1963, issue of the REVIEW, the late Louis Brownlow refers at page 864 to what he considers to be "the ad- verse effects on the institution of the Presi- dency as the result of the La Follette-Mon- roney legislative reorganization which occa- sioned the proliferation of subcommittees and committee staffs-an effect which has set us a considerable way back on the road to the Congressional Government about which Wood- row Wilson was writing nearly eighty years ago. By this device," says Brownlow, "and the breakdown in party discipline, the 'Executive power' is being subsumed to a degree that seems to me to be much more difficult to handle than any encroachment on the part of the bureaucracy." Brownlow does not establish a cause-and- effect relationship in making his criticism and drawing his conclusions, but his selection of the Legislative Reorganization Act as an alleged cause of adverse effects upon the Presidency must not go unchallenged or be permitted to stand without analysis. Brownlow assumes that- (1) too many committees, subcommittees and their staffs affect the president adversely; (2) party discipline in the legislative process, particularly as it affected the relationship be- tween the president and congress, once existed to such a degree (apparently at some time prior to 1946) that we can speak of "the break- down in party discipline"; (3) the number of committees, subcommit- tees and their staffs is difficult to handle-he doesn't say difficult for whom, but presumably for the president to deal with in getting his legislative program passed; and (4) adverse effects only happened because of the La Follette-Monroney legislative re- organization. These assumptions are untenable. With regard to (1)-the mere number of committees and their staffs cannot be a reason for the executive power being "subsumed," i.e., contained and encompassed. One or two committee chairmen can facilitate or obstruct legislation recommended by a president. It can be just as difficult for a president to convince one chairman strongly opposed to a particular bill (even when there is little or no staff in- volved, e.g., the House Rules Committee) as it is to deal with several chairmen in the House and Senate who are not strongly opposed to particular legislation. Instead of an increased number of committees affecting the presidency adversely, actually such a situation gives a president more alternatives for getting particu- lar bills passed. The number of congressional committee staff employees, greater now than in 1946, is actually quite small when compared with their counterparts in the Executive Branch. The Department of Defense, for example, had 1,205,231 civilian and 2,675,018 military em- ployees with a total payroll of $17.6 billion in 1963. In contrast, the House and Senate Armed Services Committees had a combined profes- sional staff of 17 and a clerical staff of 21 in 1963, with expenditures of $165,335.94 for em- ployed personnel in 1963. Even if the Legislative Reorganization Act</page><page sequence="8">COMMUNICATIONS 399 had not been passed in 1946, there would have been an increase in the number of committees and their staffs. This increase would have been caused, in part, by the advent of the United States as a world power with a responsibility for keeping peace under cold war conditions. The atomic bomb was used in 1945, and in 1946 the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy was established, paralleling the creation of the Atomic Energy Commission. The Marshall Plan, foreign aid, military assistance, the Korean War, the development of long-range missiles and the coming of the space age-all these events created more work for both the executive and legislative branches. But the number of employees in the legislative branch, naturally needing more expertise among staff members required to deal with such legislation, is far less than the number of employees in the "bureaucracy" about which Brownlow writes. I think it can be said that, if the Legislative Reorganization Act had not passed in 1946, we would still have had an increase in the number of committees and in congressional staffs, but instead of subcommittees organized under major committees with well-defined jurisdic- tions, there would have been more separate committees, probably more overlapping, and less probability of the committee structure cohering, as it now does, around large subject- matter fields. For example, instead of the large area of responsibility now organized under the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, there might have been separate committees and separate chairmen for each of the areas now covered by subcommittees. This would have made it more difficult, not less, for any presi- dent dealing with foreign policies requiring legislation and appropriation by the Congress. Similarly, had the Army and Navy had sepa- rate committees, as they did before 1946, un- doubtedly there would have developed a sepa- rate committee for the Air Force, and then it would have been more difficult for a president to deal with the three committees than with the one Armed Services Committee-having one overall jurisdiction. The Armed Services Com- mittee avoided the interservice rivalry pattern which developed (and proved to be so difficult to handle) in the Department of Defense. With regard to assumption (2)-while it is true that a pattern of party discipline is not dis- cernible in the relationship between the presi- dent and Congress, this is nothing new. I could not agree that there was a "breakdown," from some former system of party discipline which was quite efficient in terms of legislative proc- ess, to some system which made it more diffi- cult for the president. It is always difficult for a president, but this element of party discipline must not be overemphasized in ascribing rea- sons for events which occur in executive- legislative relations. The personalities of the president and the majority leaders of the House and Senate are factors; when Eisenhower was president, even with a majority of Democrats in the House and Senate, effective relations prevailed between the Republican president and the Democratic Speaker Rayburn and Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson. History affords examples of more obstruction when the president and a majority of both houses of Congress have been of the same party. Assumptions three and four have already been answered above. Finally, the notion that the Executive power is being subsumed to a degree (much more difficult to handle than any encroachment on the part of the bureaucracy) by anything that happens in Congress will be news to many mem- bers of Congress who have increasingly com- plained that legislative powers are being dele- gated to the executive. Some of them deplore the reorganization powers granted the presi- dent. Executive agencies are reorganized and Congress does not have an opportunity to par- ticipate in the plans while they are being made, and cannot amend the plans even in small ways which might be an improvement. Congress appropriates money for military manpower and weapons which the president does not or will not spend. In fact, there is a growing belief in Congress that the executive is becoming too powerful and that the legislative power is being gradually diminished in the process. GEORGE B. GALLOWAY Legislative Reference Service, Library of Congress TO THE EDITOR: I would do Louis Brownlow no favor by in- terpreting or reinterpreting his passing re- marks in his letter to Dick Neustadt about Congress and the La Follette-Monroney Act. As a political reporter and the son-in-law of a Congressman, he became no mean expert on Congress and its variable virtues while George Galloway and I were still in grammar school. At times, in his later years, as he freely ad- mitted with a grin, he was a laudator temporis acti. Yet he did have, quite aside from that, an increasing concern with some of the newer con- gressional habits of which I may mention three: (1) The habit of limiting authorizing legis- lation to a single year, so that year after year the bureaucrats and their bosses must spend untold hours rechewing the same cud before</page><page sequence="9">400 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW the legislative committees and the appropriate Appropriations subcommittees. (2) The habit of permitting (or is it en- couraging?) congressional professional staff to propose a continuing series of subjects for investigation and hearings even when the Rep- resentatives or Senators have completed the inquiries that concern them. (3) The habit of ever-increasing Committee (not congressional) veto-power over individ- ual administrative actions such as real prop- erty transactions, and weapons procurement. Brownie believed that the first habit was unwise and unwarranted; it forces the repre- sentatives of the President to waste their energies because two committees are rivals for public attention. He believed that the second habit was a lurid example of allowing an ex- pert to be on top, rather than on tap-where he belonged-a question that fascinated and infuriated him. As for the third habit, he was convinced that it was both an unconstitutional interference with the President's responsibility for taking care that the laws be faithfully executed; and equally an abdication, in the Wilsonian sense, of congressional responsibility to an essen- tially irresponsible body. No doubt Brownie would have agreed that these habits were not created by the Legisla- tive Reorganization of 1946; he might have said that they were encouraged by it. At any rate, if I may depend on my own memory, he didn't like them, and neither do I. One more point. Congressional complaints about the delegation of "legislative powers" to the executive in the successive reorganization acts, passed by successive Congresses, hardly deserve citation, especially by so learned a sup- porter of our national legislature as George Galloway, in justification of an extension of congressional authority. Congressional power to reorganize, like con- gressional power to enact tariff legislation, was laid on the shelf when Congress came to realize, painfully, that congressional power was not synonymous with congressional competence. HAROLD STEIN Princeton University A POST-POLEMIC To THE EDITOR: I would like to clarify and comment on an issue concerning the notion of the "pre-scien- tific" world and understanding in the polemic exchanged between Professors John H. Schaar and Sheldon S. Wolin in their "Review Essay" on Essays on the Scientific Study of Politics (ed. Herbert J. Storing) and Professor Leo Strauss which appeared in the March 1963 issue of this REVIEW. It is too important to miss notice. Schaar and Wolin raised the question as to why Strauss's "pre-scientific" world and un- derstanding could not be called a "pre-logical" or "pre-philosophical" world or understanding, and whether a "post-scientific" understanding is possible. In my opinion, it could be called a "pre-logical" or "pre-philosophical" world or understanding. As a matter of fact, Strauss himself used the term "prephilosophic" refer- ring to the "natural world," i.e., "the way in which they [political things] present themselves in political life, in action" (Natural Right and History [NRH], 1953, pp. 79, 81), and criticized Max Weber for not having been concerned with "an analysis of social reality as it is experienced in social life or known to 'common sense'" (NRH, p. 78). It is also referred to as "the world in which we live" or "the world of common sense") as contrasted to "the world of science" (see also: What Is Political Philos- ophy? And Other Essays [WPP], 1959, p. 23, et passim and "An Epilogue," in Essays, p. 331, et passim). The question raised here by the reviewers is not entirely of their own fault: it is a legitimate question. Strauss is partially re- sponsible for this confusion. He writes that, "To grasp the natural world as a world that is radically prescientific or prephilosophic, one has to go back behind the first emergence of science or philosophy. It is not necessary for this purpose to engage in extensive and neces- sarily hypothetical anthropological studies" (NRH, pp. 79-80, italics mine). Moreover, in his reply to his critics, he rejects "in passing" the suggestion that "the notion according to which the 'world' is 'a whole' is of biblical rather than of Greek origin" (this REVIEW, March, 1963, p. 154). According to these state- ments, two things are clear: first, the "pre- scientific world" is of Greek origin; second, it tends, if one does not fully understand the meaning of the term "radically," to suggest that this "pre-scientific world" is a pre-his- torical world, i.e., the world prior to the de- velopment of philosophy and science. I would not question the truth of the first, but I would like to clarify the notion of the "pre-scientific world."</page><page sequence="10">COMMUNICATIONS 401 In the light of what Strauss attempts to de- scribe about the "natural world," the term "pre-reflexive world" seems to convey its mean- ing more adequately than the term "pre- scientific world": thus, it is "pre-conceptual," "pre-logical" and "pre-philosophical" in the sense that conceptualization, logic and philos- ophy are all reflexive activities. This "world" is not foreign to phenomenology and existential- ism, particularly in post-Husserlian phenom- enology. The term Lebenswelt (Life-world, the world of every-day life or the world of im- mediate, lived experience) was used and ex- pounded originally by Edmund Husserl, the founder of phenomenology, in his last and posthumously published work: Die Krisis der europdischen Wissenschaften und transzenden- tale Phanomenologie (2d ed., 1962). See also an English article by Husserl's student Ludwig Landgrebe, "The World as a Phenomenological Problem," Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, Vol. 1 (September, 1940, pp. 38-58). The Lebenswelt is one of the foremost areas of phenomenologists' and existentialists' concern today. The French existential phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty uses the phrase l'etre au monde which has its origin in Heidegger's in-der-Welt-Sein in his epoch-making Sein und Zeit. In this country, in addition to the late Professor Alfred Schutz who devoted much of his life to working at phenomenology of the social sciences, Professor John Wild of Yale University is the most enthusiastic proponent of the Lebenswelt and has applied it to social and political philosophy (e.g., in his latest book, Existence and the WVorld of Freedom, 1963). In this connection, we can also mention William James's "radical empiricism," and the British philosopher John Macmurray has independ- ently worked out a philosophy regarding "immediate experience" (see Interpreting the Universe, 1933). The Lebenswelt is the pri- mordial world of every-day life in the sense that it is "pregiven to both the man in the world of working and to the theorizing thinker" (Schutz, The Problem of Social Reality, 1962, p. 247). It is more rich, ambiguous, immediate and emotional than the reflexive world. Strauss's distinction between "scientific" and "common-sense" understanding is similar to the one that Schutz makes between the phe- nomenological epoche and the epoche of the nat- ural attitude (or Husserl's natiirlicher WVelt- begriff). Thus, the Lebenswelt is not the pre- historical world but the world of every-day life "Here and Now," even if the study of "primi- tive mentality" helps to understand it. Strauss lists Husserl and Heidegger among "the four greatest philosophers of the last forty years"-the other two are Bergson and White- head (WPP, p. 17). However, as far as I know, he has nowhere related his "natural world" or "pre-scientific world" to Husserl's Lebenswelt or Heidegger's in-der-Welt-Sein. To the extent that the task of philosophy is to describe and understand the Lebenswelt, Strauss's "phenom- enological" interpretation of classical polit- ical philosophy is a notable enterprise and suggests an important direction.
