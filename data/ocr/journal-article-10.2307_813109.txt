<plain_text><page sequence="1">English Journal April 1973 * Volume 62 * Number Four The Nature Book in Action Richard G. Lillard Chairman, Department of English California State University Los Angeles, California THE traditional nature book is a non- fiction work that is lyrical, informa- tional, and apolitical. As a type it began in the eighteenth century along with the romantic movement, which has never ended, and modern biological science, which is now competing in impact with the inorganic sciences. It has had steady authorship and readership in Western Europe and in North America, especially in England and the Northeastern United States. The nature book flourishes anew in the era of environmental concern and color photography. Since it deals with seemingly eternal life processes broader by far than the doings of Homo sapiens, it is not obsolescent as perhaps industrial man is with his obsession for the imme- diate moment. The nature book concerns itself with phenomena that take their own time, with self-perpetuating activi- ties that go on without help or notice from human beings. Nowadays the nature book, newly in- vigorated, hybridizes with the conserva- tionist battle book and its black-and- white photographs of poisoned mammals in contorted postures, muddy, littered slopes that once held forests, and turgid streams clogged with dead fish belly up. Mild or embattled, the nature book fits easily into the reading lists and the dis- cussion time of many English courses. It can serve as a basis for separate courses or for interdisciplinary programs, or for richly appropriate colloquiums on man's place amid natural things-on his proper role on land, on sea, and in the air. Examples are Sally Carrighar's A Day Editor's Note: This paper was presented at the NCTE Convention in Minneapolis, Min- nesota, November 1972. 537</page><page sequence="2">538 ENGLISH JOURNAL on Teton Marsh (Knopf, 1947), laid in Wyoming, Joseph Wood Krutch's The Desert Year (William Sloane, 1952), laid in Arizona, Helen Hoover's A Place in the Woods (Minnesota) (Knopf, 1969), Henry Beston's The Outermost House (Doubleday, 1928), a Cape Cod classic for forty years, or Josephine W. John- son's recent The Inland Island (Simon and Schuster, 1969), set on an abandoned Ohio farm. Though a few nature books like John Kieran's A Natural History of New York City (Houghton, 1959) deal with urban niches, most take rural or wilderness areas or quasi-wild borders such as the tidal marshes of Florida or Iraq. THE nature book is not a philosophical work like Emerson's Nature (1836), although the nature book implies the idea that freedom comes from choosing to live inside natural laws. The nature book is not literary analysis like Leo Marx' The Machine in the Garden (Ox- ford University Press, 1964) or a case his- tory like Robert Easton's Black Tide: The Santa Barbara Oil Spill and Its Con- sequences (Delacorte, 1972), not a taxo- nomic compendium like Ernest P. Ed- wards' A Field Guide to the Birds of Mexico (Sweet Briar, Virginia: Ernest P. Edwards, 1972), a collection of lore like the entrancing J. Frank Dobie books on coyotes and other animals, not a histori- cal work on geological epochs or evolu- tion, not a topic research book, however readable, like W. M. Wheeler's Social Life Among the Insects (Harcourt, 1923), or Peter Farb's Living Earth (Har- per, 1959). It is not a thesis book, built on research and travel such as Marsh's Man and Nature, or Physical Geography as Modified by Human Action (1864; reprinted by Harvard University Press, 1965) or William Thomas, Editor, Man's Role in Changing the Face of the Earth (University of Chicago Press, 1956). The nature book is certainly not a hu- manized fiction like Bambi (Simon and Schuster, 1928) or a moralizing fable like the present best seller, Jonathan Living- ston Seagull (Macmillan, 1971) which has no more to do with gulls than Aesop and La Fontaine have to do with frogs, foxes, crows, and asses. Richard Bach's seagull defies the slow processes of nat- ural selection and deliberately escapes from his own humdrum waterfront ex- istence, indeed, alters his species, to live a life of pure joy. He may inspire dullards to try for the power of positive thinking, but he succeeds only in fantasy. The text contradicts the photographs, that show recognizable, ungulled, non-gulling sea- gulls to such ungullible readers as exam- ine the book. The astute nature writer does all he can to avoid sentimentality, personification, and the imputation of conscious purpose to natural events. Such teleology, an absurdity, simply means that human val- ues get between writer and nature, writer and reader. Anthropomorphism is the curse of much children's literature, as when animals talk and think and possess proper names. Man-made judgments dis- tort observation. The "awkward" shape of the lake, says a writer. What is its shape? The "savage" wolverine. What does the wolverine do? The "ungainly" walk of the aardvark. How does an aard- vark walk? The "unearthly" screech of an owl? What is the sound? Women and men can make some legitimate preten- sions to being able to interpret fellow human beings but they had better only report about fellow creatures. In the con- text of nature, nothing is in itself beauti- ful or ugly. It is functional. It is. No good nature book imposes on other species any human-being system for es- thetics, morality, economics, comfort, or danger. As Margaret Millar points out in The Birds and the Beasts Were There (Random, 1968), men and birds differ in point of view. Man dislikes and avoids a patch of weeds; a goldfinch spends all day in it. Men hate a pile of trash; there a wren finds a spider, a thrush a worm,</page><page sequence="3">THE NATURE BOOK IN ACTION 539 a towhee a shelter, a wood rat a home- site. Man wants to fell a dead and there- fore superfluous tree; a woodpecker goes to it for luscious larvae and a snug nest- ing place. I hate telephone poles and overhead wires; mockingbirds sit up there and sing. T HE nature book is a personal state- ment, often charmingly literary, told at firsthand, by a well-rounded observer who is as much at home in the humanities as in the natural sciences, especially the biological studies. At his best, in Darwin Lambert's phrase, the nature writer is "a poetically inclined generalist." He is tol- erant, eloquent, reflective, well read, and also on his own freshly and patiently observant. Agassiz, who refused to con- nect the evidence that pointed to evolu- tion, said "Study nature, not books." The nature writer studies both books and na- ture. He stays in one place, often a small precinct, instead of travelling over earth's curvature. And his book shows in sharp, specific, sensuous detail how he lives in harmony with nonhuman nature, how he adjusts to this nature, examines it-mar- vels at its features large and small. The nature book has a place for the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, or Bar- ranca del Cobre in Chihuahua and So- nora, or for the Himalayas, but more often than not it celebrates the little things that make big memories. Edmund Jaeger gathered bookfuls of observations from his cabin sites in the Chocolate and other desert mountains. Henry Beston wrote of wildlife and the intricate rhythms of the Atlantic waves as he spent his days and nights at his lonely house on Cape Cod. John K. Terres learned a small world of raccoons and other organisms as he sat quietly in a tree above a North Carolina creek. William Beebe wrote one lively chapter about what he found in four square feet of Brazilian jungle soil under a wild cinnamon tree. Hal Borland calls one of his books Beyond Your Doorstep (Knopf, 1962). Jean Henri Fabre pioneered in entomological studies and derived ten volumes out of decades of studying one weedy garden in Pro- vence. Fabre illustrates a Park Service yarn. A man asked a naturalist friend how he'd spent the summer. "Well, I started exploring my backyard. I got only about halfway across it." In Listening Point (Knopf, 1958), Sigurd Olson of Minnesota tells how when he is on a canoe trip amid wilder- ness he chooses a camping place for the view, but he remembers it as the site for the little details that in time he noticed. Like the Louis Halle of Spring in Wash- ington (William Sloane, 1947), he wants to snatch the passing moment and exam- ine it for signs of eternity. The author of the nature book will admit that his presence affects the nature he is observing, but he wishes to intrude as little as possible. He wants to record not alter; understand, not possess; leave alone, not replace; be in on something al- ready a going thing, not in any way redi- rect or stop it. He dreams of seeing Eden as it was before Adam and Eve ate the fruit-an apricot, probably--before man and woman began to impose human values on nature, such as prudery-de- nuding a fig tree of leaves in order to hide human genitalia. In the huge world of the naturalist, man cannot acquire too much knowledge in the laboratory or in the field, but he can all too soon begin to apply his knowledge to kill animals, cut trees, move earth, and invent lethal chemicals unknown to nature. All too soon groups of human beings can learn how to make money and how to conquer or wipe out other groups of human be- ings. All too soon groups set out on the self-defeating task of trying to conquer nature or destroy it. N its unmilitant, serious, informed way the nature book celebrates life. It im- plicitly rejects the notion that nature is dead or obsolete, as now announced by some intemperate technologists. It re-</page><page sequence="4">540 ENGLISH JOURNAL jects the idea that in the long run man can win over nature. The nineteenth- century paintings called "still life" showed apples and quinces picked by man, draped ducks and grouse shot by man. The French name for such genre paintings is appropriate: "nature morte." Human beings can indeed kill individual living things; they can even wipe out entire species and genera, and they are much engaged the wide world over in exterminating species that rode to safety on Noah's cramped ark. With the Stel- ler's sea cow gone, the great auk gone, the dodo, the pygmy elephant, the Eski- mo curlew, the California grizzly, with a hundred species down to fewer than a hundred individuals each but with Tom, Dick, &amp; Harry multiplying like fruit flies, earth grows dull and duller, more monotonous, less varied. To all the destruction of the life in man's environment, the nature book is a heartfelt reply. It adumbrates or states an ethic broader than that of the Sermon on the Mount, for it includes the mountain itself and the native plants, animals, cliffs, canyons, waters-the whole ecological network of relationships. This encom- passing, dedicated concern is the land ethic of Aldo Leopold in Sand County Almanac (Oxford University Press, 1949), which says we must extend the Golden Rule to all elements in our en- vironment. For technological man is now the most powerful, evident, continuous force on earth for change or alteration. He is the leading force in all things hy- drological, geological, atmospheric- ecological. He should prepare an ethical impact statement for every proposal for altering the environment of man, beast, and plant-for altering hillside and plain, high sky and ocean deep. THE nature book announces unity, in- terrelationships, the balance of an ecosystem. In Beyond the Aspen Grove (Random, 1970), Ann Zwinger inven- tories her forty acres west of the Rampart Range in Colorado, tells about the food chain there, presents much about insects, fungi, sedges, arthropods, and plants, and she laments the absence of wolves, wol- verines, and grizzlies, now "pushed to extinction by man's narrowing of the wilderness." She finds her unity on a rock in the lake: The lake rock is a microcosm, and here I find stability and order, and an under- standing of my own place in an impec- cable design. From here I can see the seasons chain together in a continuity that runs through our lives. Each one of us has sat here, at one time or another, almost as much a part of the landscape as the lake rock itself, absorbing a sense of strength from the granite and a sense of freedom from the sky. Gavin Maxwell, whose Ring of Bright Water (Dutton, 1960) exuberates over the seashore wildness of Northwestern Scotland, treats familiarly of rabbits, whooper swans, greylag geese, blue and rorqual whales, and a wildcat. He has fascinating details on the inland migra- tion of elvers--eels-and he is particular- ly expansive on river otters. There are interludes when he travels to the Near East, to the swamps of the marsh Arabs and to London, but his book holds to a bay on the edge of the Western High- lands. In the foreword he says: In writing this book about my home I have not given to the house its true name. This is from no desire to create mystery -indeed it will be easy enough for the curious to discover where I live-but be- cause identification in print would seem in some sense a sacrifice, a betrayal of its remoteness and isolation, as if by doing so I were to bring nearer its enemies of in- dustry and urban life. Camusfe'rna, I have called it, the Bay of the Alders, from the trees that grow along the burn side; but the name is of little consequence, for such bays and houses, empty and long disused, are scattered throughout the wild sea lochs of the Western Highlands and the Hebrides, and in the description of</page><page sequence="5">THE NATURE BOOK IN ACTION 541 one the reader may perhaps find the like- ness of others of which he has himself been fond, for these places are symbols. Symbols, for me and for many, of free- dom, whether it be from the prison of over-dense communities and the close confines of human relationships, from the less complex incarceration of office walls and hours, or simply freedom from the prison of adult life and an escape into the forgotten world of childhood, of the in- dividual or the race. For I am convinced that man has suffered in his separation from the soil and from the other living creatures of the world; the evolution of his intellect has outrun his needs as an animal, and as yet he must still, for secu- rity, look long at some portion of the earth as it was before he tampered with it. This book, then, is about my life in a lonely cottage on the northwest coast of Scotland, about animals that have shared it with me, and about others who are my only immediate neighbours in a landscape of rock and sea. AXWELL'S statement catches many of the persistant themes of the na- ture book, including the selection of a specific locale that is a home, or a second home, or a definite locality where one spends a prolonged and loitering amount of time. In earlier generations of nature writers, in John Burroughs or W. H. Hudson, Enos Mills or John Muir, the locale is always specific, as in the earlier Henry W. Bates' The Naturalist on the River Amazon (1864) or the still earlier work by Gilbert White: The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne, in the County of Southampton (1789). The reader always knows where he is in space. The reader knows this in Dudley Lunt's Taylors Gut (Knopf, 1968)- about one estuary in Delaware, or Elna Bakker's An Island Called California (University of California Press, 1971), about one transect across the state from San Francisco Bay to the Colorado River. Maxwell does not, however, prescribe for himself a definite time frame as many nature writers do. In This Living Earth (American West Publishing Co., 1972), a pictorial study of one California mead- ow, David Cavagnaro takes three years, which he calls in turn "Awakening," "Discovery," and "Understanding." A year is common, as in Thoreau's Walden (1854), Krutch's The Twelve Seasons (William Sloane, 1949)-months-at his Connecticut home, Fred Bodsworth's heartrending The Last Curlew (Dodd, 1955), Hazel Heckman's Island Year (University of Washington Press, 1972) -set in Puget Sound-or Eliot Porter in his masterful book of photographs: "In Wildness Is the Preservation of the World" (Sierra Club, 1962). Some writers take the season, as do Louis J. Halle in Spring in Washington or Klaus and Elizabeth Gemming in Block Island Summer (Chatham Press, 1971). Allan W. Eckert takes only three weeks for his Wild Season (Little, Brown, 1967), set at a lake on the Illinois- Wisconsin border, and Sally Carrighar takes twenty-four hours for One Day on Beetle Rock (Knopf, 1944). Straight-line annalistic history through the years is man invented and man imposed on as- tronomy, geology, and human history. Nature works in cycles-the day, the season, the year, the life cycle, the suc- cession of plants and animals in a certain ecological niche or ecosystem, the evolu- tion and devolution of species, and though some present-day nature books are built on the old principle of the diary or journal, the fresh ones use the cycle, which parallels the recycling of waste material that at present is fashion- able, and properly so. In nature, begin- nings and endings go in all directions in concentric circles in cubic relationships. The great chain of being, more intricate than a stack of coats of mail, forever vibrates and rustles. FOR the purpose of comprehension, the nature book gives unity to the multifarious, multitudinous, orderly, end- less drama of its subject by concentrating</page><page sequence="6">542 ENGLISH JOURNAL on one lake or desert, one day or year. The microcosm suggests the whole, serves as synecdoche or symbol for the im- mensely larger and more prolonged. It is no wonder that the word island appears in numerous titles. Basically the nature book is a slice of life, a coordinate cross section of time and space, a unified look at the food chains, the symbiotic and parasitic rela- tionships, the webs of living things ad- justed to each other and to their varying inorganic environments. Little implies much. Genesis is reenacted each time a cell divides, an egg hatches, a seed sprouts, a mammal conceives, or the earth quakes. Everything comes out pretty much even. Says Hamlet: "A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm." No living thing escapes from the food chain. Before 1859 and The Origin of Species, as after, nature writers identified God and religion with natural beauty and perpetual balance in the ecosphere. For the John Burroughs of Wake-Robin (1871), for the Walt Whitman of por- tions of Specimen Days (1882), and for the Gene Stratton-Porter of Freckles (Doubleday, 1921), there was a grand spiritual design to nature. Nature was a she who taught lessons. She renewed one's health. She provided a sanctuary, a retreat for communion and exaltation. This notion often led to much personifi- cation and mushy rhetoric, though astute writers held to the facts and to sensuous detail rather than echo the religiosity. A specimen of nature writing at the transition point between metaphysi- cal fantasy and field observation is Susan Fenimore Cooper's Rural Hours (Syra- cuse University Press, 1968). This en- during minor work, published in 1850, revised in 1887, and republished in 1968, concerns a year in Cooperstown and the vale occupied by Lake Otsego. The author deals largely in specific detail. She is conscious that writing on natural objects "is now much less vague and general than it was formerly; it has be- come very much more definite and ac- curate within the last half century." Her topics, taken up during the round of a single year, are weather phenomena, ani- mals, trees, and flowers. Throughout the book Miss Cooper reports and comments on historic intrusions into the original natural balances of land and lake. The woods bison are gone. Wolves, panthers, and bears are scarce. Carolina parakeets grow rarer and rarer, as do passenger pigeons, for no longer in 1850 does she see "large unbroken flocks several miles in extent succeeding each other." The Indians are almost all gone, though she presents one touching vignette of three Oneida women-Awa, Cootlee, and Wallee-who come to the Cooper house and beg for bread and meat. Local anglers have introduced pickerel to the lake. The pickerel is "a good fish though inferior to some others in our lake." Miss Cooper is critical of men who insensately strip the forest of noble pines, who are waste- ful of wood and saplings and who stupid- ly cut down every tree instead of thin- ning the groves and leaving all the trees on knolls or along stream banks-who see a tree only as an enemy or a source for dollars. In four scattered passages she gives details on the Old World weeds that are invading fields and woods. "These foreign intruders are a bold and hardy race, driving away the prettier natives." In come foreign tare, shepherd's purse, mallow, thistle, burdock, or Jim- son weed, replacing pitcher plant and moccasin flower. European plantain, "a regular pathweed," follows cattle and workmen. She points out, too, that the process of clearing land upsets the har- mony of nature, for the plough uproots natives such as May-wings, squirrel-cups, or trailing arbutus. She is taking note of an unbalanced ecosystem half a century and more ahead of such plagues as Chinese chest-</page><page sequence="7">THE NATURE BOOK IN ACTION 543 nut blight, Dutch elm virus, and Si- berian white pine blister rust. She is speaking out like an early forest con- servationist, but she is concerned only in passing. Except for her pages on how men mistreat trees, her overall tone is without protest. Clearly she accepts the concepts of material progress and of the superior civilization of the non-Indian North Americans. And she proclaims "the immeasurable goodness, the infinite wisdom of our Heavenly Father," though this does not correlate with the extirpa- tion of species and the vandalism among the trees. She finds an orthodox comfort in the words of her God in the Bible and in His works which are the natural scene. A beautiful sixteenth of May throws her into several pages of post-Calvinist rhapsody: What have the best of us done to merit one such day in a lifetime of follies and failings and sins? The air we breathe so pure and balmy, the mottled heavens above so mild and kindly, the young herb beneath our feet so delicately fresh, every plant of the field decked in beauty, every tree of the forest clothed in dignity, all unite to remind us, that, despite our own unworthiness, "God's mercies are new every day." An unquestioned faith in God enables her to avoid any anxiety about the fu- ture. There is a parallel in Hidden Valley of the Smokies (Dodd, 1971) by Ross E. Hutchins, a ranger naturalist, who tells of his favorite haunts along a creek called Little River in Eastern Tennessee inside Great Smokies National Park. He con- centrates on insects, mammals, flowers, and trees. He is sad about the extermina- tion of chestnuts by the blight, for it deprives bear and squirrels of food and has reduced their population, and he mentions the danger of invasion of the park by Ural Mountains Russian swine, escaped from a North Carolina hunting preserve set up in 1912. But he shows no worry, not because he believes as Susan Cooper did in Almighty God but be- cause he believes that the Mighty United States will guard and protect national park lands. UT faith in any deity or any govern- ment now sustains few if any nature writers. World War II with the atomic bomb was a turning point. The bomb, the brutal, fateful symbol of applied sci- ence and governmental technology, marked a new era in nature writing as in foreign policy. With the big bombs and the big earth-moving machinery, the helicopters, and all the new technology for war against human beings, insects, and coyotes, neither wild nature nor isolated native tribes, not even the re- motest peoples of the Amazon jungle, were safe from destruction. It was no longer possible merely to study nature or to eulogize it. It was necessary to act. Friends of nature, friends of earth's sur- face, could no longer fully enjoy the present. With the alliance of Big Tech- nology, Big Government, Big Business, and Big Military Science, of Big Power and Big Money-with all of these had come what Alvin Toffler calls future shock (see Future Shock [Random, 1970]). Such shock, Toffler says, "is no longer a distantly potential danger, but a real sickness from which increasingly large numbers already suffer. This psycho- biological condition can be described in medical and psychiatric terms. It is the disease of change." Technology has greatly accelerated rate of change. Pro- gressive man, glib about "material prog- ress," impatient with evolution, eager to emulate the instant creation summarized in the Book of Genesis, deplores cultural lag and denounces nature's lag. Govern- mental and corporate bureaucracy itself, which plans the speedups, cannot keep up and breaks down into ad-hocracy. Shocked by the premature arrival of the future, millions of women and men are bewildered, frustrated, disoriented.</page><page sequence="8">544 ENGLISH JOURNAL Among these are admirers of nature, ecologists, biologists, farmers, home owners, and teachers, who now dread quasi-predictable destruction of open space and wilderness, the wiping out of species, and the bulldozing or blacktop- ping or roofing over of earth's choicest spots. No spot on the grid of latitude and longitude is safe from destruction by Technological Man. CONSERVATION groups, once de- voted to happy expeditions into wil- derness, now fight back against tech- nology and development. A prime ex- ample is the Sierra Club with its lobbyist at the legislature in Sacramento, its battle books, and its many legal actions, e.g., to save Mineral King, a valley in the Sierra Nevada. A new group, Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference, works to stop Consolidated Edison and save Storm King, a noble mountain upriver from Con Edison's Manhattan. GOO (Get Oil Out) and other organizations en- gendered by the Santa Barbara Oil Spill have influenced legislation and public administration at all levels of government and affected deliberations of the United Nations. Authors of nature books are in the fight, too, especially in books that have appeared since 1960. Active defense of unspoiled terrain natural relationships ap- pear, for instance, in Edward Abbey's Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilder- ness (McGraw-Hill, 1968) and in Adolph Murie's A Naturalist in Alaska (Devin- Adair, 1961). In one passage Murie de- fends the Alaska wolves as part of the total natural plan that includes Dall sheep, caribou, and moose. He says the wolves add "immeasurable richness and wilderness spirit to the landscape." Sigurd Olson defends bobcats against Minnesota bounty hunters, just as long ago John Muir, a one-man early con- servation movement, defended alpine wildflowers and tundra sedges against rapacious sheepmen. In their Yellorw- stone: A Century of the Wilderness Idea (Macmillan and Yellowstone Library and Museum Association, 1972), Ann and Myron Sutton celebrate an immense, "rare and priceless ecosystem [that] has been held intact and never commercially logged." The park is "an island of wil- derness in a sea of cultivated crops." Yet the Suttons make clear that Yellowstone's officials face the problem of modifying human behavior-of preventing over- fishing, any feeding of deer and bear, and all attempts to kill predators, of getting all housing facilities and autos, even all horses, outside the park-of re- versing the "vandalism of improvement." Alarm shows all the way through in books like the highly artistic Inland Island of Josephine Johnson, whose home on an old, abandoned farmsite has two streams. One, pure, rises on the farm and supports a hundred species; the other, blackish, bubbly, odoriferous, and dead drains sewage from the nearby town. Through- out the author is critical of hunters, trappers, and vandals who despoil the wildlife on or near her wooded acreage. Hazel Heckman protests steadily in her Island Year, set in Puget Sound on An- derson Island, which is six by three miles in size. She is in agony over ruthless, care- less deer hunting and over roadside spraying. To improve vision on blind corners, the highway men spray herbi- cides that kill everything-huckleberry, Oregon grape, ferns, kinnikinnick, black- caps, blackberries, lupines, foxglove, wild rose-and deprive birds and butterflies of food and refuge. She protests the "creeping destruction" of a new sub- division that brings widened roads, bull- dozed woods, drained marshes and swamps, and destruction of the leafy habitats of shy animals. Oil gets into lake waters, and septic tanks seep into them. Slimy algae spread on the lake bottoms. Scrapers clean off all vegetation for a shiny expanse of mobile homes, where city folks live in their gigantic tin cans. Says Mrs. Heckman: "Anderson Island</page><page sequence="9">THE NATURE BOOK IN ACTION 545 is no Grand Canyon, no Everglades, no redwood forest, to arouse public indig- nation. It is only one of the 'little wild places,' one endangered island in Puget Sound. But great losses are made up of small losses. We cannot shrug this off as progress. Nor is it just we who have lost. America has been deprived. Our children and our children's children have been cheated out of that wildness that should have been their heritage." JUSTICE William O. Douglas, like many other writers, combines lyrical description with tough out-and-out counter propaganda. In his My Wilder- ness: East to Katahdin (Doubleday, 1961), which takes up eleven varied lo- cales from Southern Utah to Central Maine, he lambasts those public officials allied with private commercial interests who drain natural waters and dry up the Everglades, who drop poisons from planes over Bridger National Forest in Wyoming and kill every creature in the food chain that eats meat, including foxes, martens, coyotes, bears, hawks, and eagles. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management men spray herbicides on willows and sagebrush in order to aug- ment stream flow and grass growth-all to help stockmen-and wipe out trout, moose, sage grouse, and much else. Books like Douglas' have led to the beginning of revised Federal policies. Douglas' chapter in A Farewell to Texas (Mc- Graw-Hill, 1967), on the pillage and heartless exploitation of the remarkable Big Thicket in Eastern Texas has given hope to Texas conservationists. A sequel is The Big Thicket: A Challenge for Conservation (Austin, Texas: Jenkins Publishing Co.; Chatham, 1971) by A. Y. "Pete" Gunter, Professor of Philosophy at North Texas State University. In many new nature books the future shock shows particularly in the final chapter. Mrs. Heckman calls her last chapter "Rape." David F. Costello ends his The Desert World: Plant and Animal Life of the American Desert (Crowell, 1972) with a chapter called "Man and the North American Deserts: History and Future." His pessimism and protest are in startling contrast to his earlier lov- ing chapters on plants, animals, desert scenery. He objects to housing-tract eye- sores, used-car lots, trailer courts, indus- trial plants; to jet planes and their con- densation trails; to dune buggies, camp- ers, vans, trailers, motorcycles, and ghetto campgrounds; to pipelines, strip mines, city and industrial dumps; to smog, which now accumulates in Phoenix and Las Vegas; and to dams, war games, and trophy hunting. John Hay and Peter Farb in their The Atlantic Shore (Harper, 1966) concern themselves largely with natural history from Long Island to Labrador. They are legitimately rhapsodic over what was there when Captain John Smith first ex- plored: "the high standing trees, the wild turkey, the otter, the wolf, the great auk, the sweet prodigality of these spring shores." But they admonish at once that "we may now be close to realizing that what is left will be kept only if we admit our need of it." In their final chapter, "The Shore in Human Hands," they report "the shadow of the former real- ity," the shad and salmon, and alewife reduced to small numbers, the shore birds few and far between, bald eagles scarce, ospreys doomed, headlands bulldozed, marshes filled in, shellfish beds polluted, freshwater tables falling and salt water penetrating underneath the land. Hay and Farb end on a bitter note: "Ours is an experimental civilization, experiment- ing with its own 'progress,' experiment- ing dangerously with its mother earth." DUDLEY Cammet Lunt, a conserva- tionist hunter, an activist in the prolonged fight to save Delaware's shore- line of marshes and estuaries from a com- bine of big oil companies and the Federal government, devotes a late chapter in</page><page sequence="10">546 ENGLISH JOURNAL Taylors Gut to "The River Road," once a lane between rows of blue chicory and hedges sweet with the scent of honey- suckle, a lane with views of white egrets at rest, great blue herons borne on pump- ing wings, and the miracles of iridescence called wood ducks. "The countryside would be alive with birds." Then came the year of 1955. In the spring of that year bulldozers appeared and they and their twin engines of destruction, the dirt carriers, began snorting through this countryside. This rich rolling river country, its trees, its spacious dwellings, the broad fields, the long lazy vistas of marsh and river, all were destined to oblivion. In the leveling, in great clouds of dust and smoke, they all disappeared. Swiftly mounds of topsoil began to squat here and to squat there. Derricks towered. Wire fences ran harsh and hard. Circular storage tanks began to take form. and. ... Today this stretch of the River Road is lined on either hand by the ugly tubs and tanks and, rising against the sky, the vast convoluted plumbing and towering stacks of an oil refinery, touted by the Tidewater Oil Company as the most mod- ern in the world. Overhead, day in and day out, night in and night out, a myriad of stacks pour forth fumes into the sky. Thereabout the air smells. Satellite enter- prises have burgeoned and continue to proliferate, and the whole 5,000-acre area has become an ugly industrial wasteland comparable to the familiar disfiguration of the once lovely Hackensack Meadows in Northern New Jersey. HE dread of the possible future that activates conservationists from Ha- waii to Delaware and from everywhere to the Stockholm environmental con- ference of 1972 drives nature writers and readers of their books into outright polit- ical activity, into campaigning for office seekers, lobbying for laws, circulation of initiative petitions, and into thinking through the problem to revolutionary conclusions. Limit the rights of private property and individual liberty and gun ownership. Devaluate the importance of Gross National Product, economic growth, and of money itself. Reject the idea of material progress, an ever-higher standard of living and keep only the idea of cultural progress. Denigrate chemistry and physics as master sciences and eco- nomics as the master social science. Pro- mote ecology to the rank of the master, all-inclusive science. It offers a secular plan for a meaningful life on earth. In despair conservationists and crusad- ing ecologists often write books with gloomy titles--The Exploited Eden (Harper, 1972), Silent Spring (Hough- ton, 1962), The Frail Ocean (Coward- McCann, 1967), The Darkening Land (Simon and Schuster, 1972), Omega- Murder of the Ecosystem and Suicide of Man (William C. Brown, 1971), The Closing Circle (Knopf, 1972), America the Raped (Simon and Schuster, 1969), Road to Ruin (Lippincott, 1969), Our Plundered Planet (Little, Brown, 1948), Our Crowded Planet (Doubleday, 1962), The Empty Ark (Scribner's, 1967), Last Chance on Earth: A Requiem for Wild- life (Chilton Books, 1966), The Silent Sky (Little, Brown, 1965), or Slaughter the Animals, Poison the Earth (Simon and Schuster, 1971). The authors of such books, prodding men to action, see man- kind, that is, wage-oriented labor and profit-oriented capital as living short- sightedly by the idea of a struggle against nature, a drive to conquer nature-an idea that now in an age of overpopulation and over-exploitation points to defeat for the human species. N contrast to the embattled crusaders, the quieter, only protesting nature writers present an ordered world in which man and nature must work to- gether as necessarily permanent parts of an organic-inorganic process operating through time in an ever-modulated harmony.</page><page sequence="11">THE NATURE BOOK IN ACTION 547 The nature writer with his benevolent outlook and vicarious imagination and the conservationist writer with his deter- mination to conquer human nature's brutal, greedy side-both writers can help man to correct his myopic econom- ics, his walleyed politics, his blind- folded education system with its voca- tional and monetary bias, and his envi- ronmental bad habits, which shock the eyeball even as they offend the nose and ear. The mind is properly horrified by illogical and senseless annihilation. The heart properly holds to natural beauties, wild creatures, and self-perpetuating life. WTe teachers of English at any level can make telling use of nature and con- servation books in courses in composi- tion or in courses dealing with portions of eighteenth-, nineteenth-, or twentieth- century literature. Such books fit into a course in report writing or intellectual history. There can be a course called Books about Nature or Literary Con- troversies in Conservation. Books by writers like Rene Dubos, Barry Com- moner, Garrett Hardin, Loren Eiseley, Paul Sears, Peter Farb, Raymond Das- mann, or Rachel Carson raise central is- sues that involve teachers and students along with everyone else. If our primary task is to teach writing, reading, thinking, and discussion, we can use informed, highly charged books on nature and the environment just as we use literary clas- sics and contemporary literature, films, and phonograph records. Whatever the books, together with re- lated articles, can tie in directly to the lives of students, as do books and articles about minority groups or about cultures on other continents. As Kenneth L. Don- elson of Arizona State University points out, one way to avoid boredom in class- rooms is to have students read books like Silent Spring, The Frail Ocean, A Sand County Almanac, The Inland Island, or John McHale's The Future of the Fu- ture (Braziller, 1969). In the brand-new campus journal, still in its mimeographed larval stage, Ecolit, an English professor recommends not only nonfiction such as Paul Ehr- lich's The Population Bomb (Ballantine, 1968) or the Robert and Leona Rienow's Moment in the Sun (Dial, 1967), but also science fiction such as Philip Wylie's melodramatic prediction of disasters in The End of the Dream (Doubleday, 1972), Harry Harrison's Make Room! Make Room! (Doubleday, 1966), or John Brunner's Stand on Zanzibar (Doubleday, 1968) (both concerned with overpopula- tion), or John Christopher's The Long Winter (Fawcett, 1970) (in which a de- cline in solar radiation produces a new Ice Age). Such fiction, along with conser- vation books, older nature books, photo- graphic books in the Sierra Club's Exhibit Format Series and the volumes in the Time-Life American Wilderness Series, and the new, active nature books with their accusing final chapters-these can enthrall students, impinge poignantly on their imaginations and lives, stimulate discussion, argument, writing, and fur- ther reading. To adorn such a course, there are always the seventeen-syllable haiku and all the rest of the world's na- ture poetry, such a play as Uncle Vanya (1899), and myths as old as those about Tantalus and Sisyphus. The Book of Genesis is a clue to the Judeo-Chris- tian idea that man has the right to domi- nate nature. The story of Pandora's box is a preview of present-day technology, which creates ten new problems while solving an old one. English teachers have the large body of established nature literature to draw on, including Walden but not Walden Two (Macmillan, 1948), and they now have a growing library of new titles to make use of in the everlasting effort to hold student attention and enlightened future citizenry. We human beings can- not destroy all life, but we can set back evolution by wiping out just about everything alive this side of our most successful rivals, the insects, this side</page><page sequence="12">548 ENGLISH JOURNAL of the algae, or this side of the anae- robic bacteria in our cesspools. But why should we do that? We evolved in the biosphere of the planet. Why not take ur- gent steps to remain a modest part of it? The planet is not leaving us. The anony- mous author of Ecclesiastes, a philoso- pher ecologist, had this to say: "One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever."</page></plain_text>
