National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Lent by the Department of the Interior In the years following the Civil War, science and art came together in the exploration of the American West. Ambitious federal surveys, funded between 1867 and 1878, mapped the nation in the common service of scientific knowledge, military control, and indus- trial expansion. The four largest surveys were led by George Wheeler, Ferdinand Hayden, Clarence King, and John Wesley Powell.' It was the golden age of the geographical and topographic survey, of the collection and inventory of natural specimens, and of the development of new theory about geological process and structure. Photographer and painter were often present with the naturalist at the moment of discovery. Expedition photography struggled to match its technical capacities to the challenge of documenting the western spectacle. Exploration called for both the empiricist, who longed to complete the map of the land, and the theorist, who strove to explain land forms the new maps re- corded. Questions raised by the West's unique landscape, as it was revealed in the art of the survey artists, forced the scientific mind into new depths of geological time and inspired a new respect for natural process. A successful scientist in this era, such as John Wesley Powell (1834-1902), was many things-a topographer and an explorer, a pragmatist, a leader and a politician, as well as a publicist and an entrepreneur. Powell was a largely self- trained geologist with considerable ambition and a flexible mind. In complet- ing his survey of the Colorado River region in 1873, he claimed to have solved one of the last great mysteries of western geography. The task had required years of travel, observation, and mapping through- out the West. It also required astute promotion of the survey's work back East. To this end, Powell collaborated with draftsmen, photographers, engravers, and 7 American Art</page><page sequence="2">IjI Me.5 M:Aj; ,ii ..7. a-</page><page sequence="3">1 Map of the Colorado River Basin, published by U.S. War Depart- ment, 1868 a professional painter, all of whom made images that recorded the profiles of geological time visible on the walls of the Grand Canyon. With the success they helped him earn, he was catapulted into a distinguished career as a federal adminis- trator of ethnology and geology. Examin- ing the role of imagery in the publication and promotion of Powell's geological work at the Grand Canyon in the 1870s charts the brief but significant intersection of elite science and the fine arts in American culture after the Civil War. Mapping the Grand Canyon In 1868, the topography of the Grand Canyon and the plateau country through which the Colorado River runs was still unrecorded. The blank hole in a War Department map of that year (fig. 1) represented an area of unsurveyed terrain some three hundred miles long and one hundred miles wide. For more than three centuries, since Francisco V~isques de Coronado first sent Fernando Alarc6n to ascend the Colorado River from the Gulf of Mexico, the Grand Canyon had defied exploration. Indian legend held that the river disappeared into the earth some- where in the center of the canyon, only to reemerge in a terrifying cycle of whirlpools and cataracts. It was not an inviting land. Despite strenuous attempts, army surveys of the region had remained incomplete. Lt. Joseph C. Ives of the War Department's Corps of Topographical Engineers made the last major effort before the Civil War by trying to ascend the Colorado River from its mouth in 1857-58. John S. Newberry, a trained scientist on the survey, recorded the first significant observations of the region's geology, and survey artists Edward Mllhausen and F. W. von Egloffstein produced dramatic illustrations for the official report. Ives's account perpetuated the impression of the canyon as a deep and gloomy hell, in which rocks "re- sembled the portals of the infernal regions" and cliffs seemed inhabited by "apparitions of goblin-like figures perched in the ... hollows."2 Von Egloffstein's illustrations, wildly exaggerating the vertical dimensions of geological features, reinforced such sublime notions (fig. 2). Billowing, fleecelike rocks soar above the level of the plateau to an improbable height and lack any clear delineation of the stratigraphy so characteristic of the area's geology. These visual concoctions deviated from the careful observations 8 Spring 1996</page><page sequence="4">2 J. J. Young after F. W. von Egloffstein, Big Canion, 1857-58.

Artistic rendering and geological observation thus remained largely independent of each other. Between 1869 and 1873, Powell's geographic survey covered the blank hole in the army map in three campaigns (fig. 3), starting with the first successful descent of the Colorado River in a harrowing expedition of 1869. By 1874, Powell proudly announced to Congress that he had "filled this blank and com- pleted the survey of the last unexplored region." He also called for the establish- ment of a more scientific survey of the land, a request that ultimately led to the founding of the United States Geological Survey in 1879. In 1875 the Smithsonian Institution published Powell's official report of his survey's findings.3 As early as 1867, Powell was already developing theories in the science of geomorphology based on his ideas about the Colorado River area. Powell clearly built on the work of Newberry, who had rejected any catastrophist explanation of the Grand Canyon's formation in favor of the study of gradual geological pro- cesses still at work. Newberry found evidence in the canyon region of the exclusive action of water and concluded that "the great caiions of the Colorado belong to a vast system of erosion." Powell's theories, which led to some of the key concepts of geomorphology still current today, depended on that crucial observation.4 Powell, like Newberry before him, was an advocate of the uniformitarian theory of Charles Lyell at a time when it was still highly controversial.5 Following Lyell, Powell reasoned that the key to under- standing the surface of the land was to look for processes at work in the present and to assume that they had worked at the same rate in the past. Powell saw the landscape in terms of gradual process- the result of periods of deposition, uplift, erosion, and volcanism. In contrast, catastrophists assumed that river canyons such as the Grand Canyon had begun in relatively recent geological time as a volcanic or faulted fissure, into which a river had then entered and followed its present course. Powell, the first to try to 9 American Art</page><page sequence="5">explain the Colorado River drainage system, argued that the course of the Green and Colorado Rivers preceded the formation of the geological structures they cut. The river was running, he theorized, before the mountains were formed, and the river cut into the earth at the same rate the earth was uplifted. Thus the river acted like a stationary whirling saw, against which the earth gradually pushed Powell... . argued that the course of the Green and Colorado Riv- ers preceded the formation of the geological structures they cut. up and folded or faulted layers of rock in its path. As the river cut vertically, its tributaries dug into the earth on either side, and the gradual action of erosion carved the wide chasm. By determining the relative age of the exposed rock and studying two great unconformities in the strata, Powell came to the conclusion that the Colorado River and its drainage system had already washed away some twenty thousand feet of rock and sedi- ment. In his view, to accomplish this the river would have had to have been working since the end of Cretaceous times, or some sixty million years. In short, Powell theorized that erosion, working at a constant pace through almost unfathomable ages, had created the Grand Canyon. The daunting task of presenting these new ideas and data would require not only texts, but images. The Many Roles of Survey Photographs Powell did not initially advocate visual records of his survey's work. It was all he could do on the first expedition of 1869 to supervise rudimentary mapmaking. Only with the second expedition of 1871-72, officially sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution, did Powell consider the value of securing a visual record with both drawing and photogra- phy. He encouraged his young cousin Clement Powell to take drawing lessons before joining the expedition, but the young man failed to acquire any useful skill. Major Powell's inclusion of a self- taught amateur artist, Frederick Samuel Dellenbaugh, seems incidental; the teenager was hired primarily as a boat- man, but he made numerous sketches of geological features and Native American petroglyphs. Powell quickly realized the advantages of including even a modestly skilled draftsman. In early 1873, he incorporated Dellenbaugh's drawings into the inventory of the scientific results of his survey, offering to display them at the hearings of the House of Representatives on further appropriations for his survey.' Both Powell and the government recognized the need for a photographer. A photographer on an expedition was hardly a radical idea in 1871; photographers had played key roles in expeditions since the first postwar geological surveys. For Powell, there were several potential audiences to consider for survey photo- graphs-the scientific community, which would consult the published reports and struggle to interpret the survey's findings; the politicians, who had to be persuaded to continue approving appropriations for the survey; and the curious general public, which wanted to see the spectacular discoveries of the western explorations. What these audiences shared was a belief in, even an obsession with, the ostensible truth of the photographic image. As Ferdinand Hayden had said of the survey photographs, "It is through the eye that we acquire most of our knowledge." Having the photograph was akin to possessing new knowledge. Even if the significance of the new data had not been 10 Spring 1996</page><page sequence="6">3 Map of the Grand Canlon of the Colorado, Showing Route Travelled by Major Powell, 1871- 72.

AS fully determined, audiences were eager to lay intellectual and imaginative claim to this new territory. Many of the same photographs ultimately circulated among all three audiences. The meanings of the photographs for these viewers varied, depending on what Rosalind Krauss has termed "photography's discursive spaces."7 It is this multiplicity of readings that renders the expedition photographs so valuable to the intellectual history of the West. Krauss has stressed the importance of separating the expedition photographs from the category of pure landscape imagery. The survey photographs were not intended to inhabit the same social or physical spaces as the elite genre of painting or pictorialist photography, a later movement. The first viewers of the official survey photographs were either survey scientists or Washington bureau- crats, who doled them out as special gifts. The government kept control over the negatives produced by the four major surveys until 1874, when they were first released for publication as stereoscopic views. But even before 1874, many leaked out as engraved reproductions illustrating travel articles in popular journals. Ulti- mately these images were highly mobile, circulating in varied intellectual, political, and social spaces. They might appear on the geologist's office desk or, in woodcut format, in the pages of published official reports. They traveled in the briefcases or graced the parlor tables of the eastern politicians who dreamed of the West and who weighed the nation's responsibility to this domain of scientific exploration and economic potential. Finally, as stereoviews or glass window transparencies, they were edifying amusements in the homes of middle-class Americans.8 These spaces were not fully discrete and impervious, and neither were the mean- ings the images generated. That the photographs had a documentary goal did not make aesthetic criteria irrelevant. Indeed, their visual merits were perceived as coexisting with scientific interest, as Hayden had argued to Congress when he 11 American Art</page><page sequence="7">defended the uses his survey made of photography. The artistry of these pictures supported their social and political functions: these views could at once persuade, instruct, impress, and delight. The Survey Photographers at Work In considering the impact Powell's ideas may have had on the survey's photo- graphs, one must first consider his level of interest in the work of the four photogra- phers who accompanied him at different times in 1871-72 and 1873. Powell gave all four general instructions about the kind of views that should be photo- graphed, and he worked closely with them when he had a particular shot in mind. He did not manage their activities in detail, however, and was not always present when they made pictures. Appar- ently the photographers had the freedom to select and compose scenes. But they varied considerably in training and ability, and some needed more supervision than others. Two enjoyed a close, personal relationship with Powell and may have openly welcomed his participation.9 The first photographer to work on the 1871-72 expedition was E. O. Beaman, a well-trained professional from New York. Beaman arrived in the field with state-of- the-art equipment-a large-format stereo camera and portable darkroom for developing the collodion wet-plate- process glass negatives. He also had a sharp eye for business and intended to make a profit from the sale of stereoviews. For that matter, so did Powell: his initial agreements with his photographers ensured that he would retain a large share of the profits from the sale of survey photographs, to be used either to support his survey or, as many sources maintain, to pay off his mortgage.10 Thus from the first, the rationale for doing photography at the Grand Canyon was in part com- mercial, and the interests and tastes of the eastern viewer-consumer helped shape the photographic enterprise. Convinced of the value of the photo- graph by the end of the 1871 field season, Powell took 250 views back to Washing- ton to bolster his funding appeals. In early Even if the significance of the new data had not been fully determined, audiences were eager to lay intellectual and imagina- tive claim to this new territory. 1872, Beaman left the Powell survey, and a rapid succession of photographers took his place-one professional, James Fennemore, and then two amateurs who were already members of the expedition, Clement Powell and Jack Hillers." In the field, necessity fostered quick and prag- matic solutions, and even though wet- plate photography required considerable skill, it could be learned in an apprentice arrangement. Hillers, who had first signed on as a boatman, became not only the expedition's chief photographer but also Powell's close friend and later the first official photographer of the Bureau of Ethnology in 1879 and the U.S. Geologi- cal Survey in 1881. His professional fate was clearly hitched to Powell's rising star. In their journals Powell's photogra- phers recorded the spectacular character of the scenery, the day-to-day details of river travel, and the ongoing work of topographical survey and specimen collection. They often emphasized the dangers and difficulty of their work. Photographer's equipment weighed more than a ton and had to be hand carried around rapids when the crew was forced to portage a boat. The men routinely scaled heights of up to three thousand feet 12 Spring 1996</page><page sequence="8">4 Jack Hillers, Marble Canyon near the Lower End, Walls of about 3,500 Feet, 1872.

National Archives, Washington, D.C. to make a photograph, only to have the session spoiled by rain or by wind top- pling over the chemicals in the developing tent. These and other misfortunes made the logistics of field photography a nightmare. But as to what the pictures document beyond the physical passage through the Colorado River region, the photogra- phers' journals are silent. To some extent, the expedition journal was better suited to recording action than thought, to detailed description than data analysis. But certainly the journals also reflected the personalities of their writers, and none of the photographers were scientists by training or inclination. Their scattered geological references fall more within the realm of topographic observation than theory-based geomorphology. Not surprisingly, specific comments on the land's elevation and structure appear more frequently in the journals of the scientists on the survey, Almon Harris Thompson and John F. Steward. Powell, however, kept detailed scientific debate to a mini- mum, taking walks alone "to geologise," as Hillers put it.12 At first Hillers showed little interest in geological processes. Early in the 1871 expedition he noted that the "old crags bespeak age, a fine study for Geologists," but he declined "to puzzle [his] head with the age of a stone." In the months that followed, however, Powell seems to have taught Hillers how to recognize basic geological phenomena, such as evidence of erosion, striking unconformities, and specific rocks and strata.13 Indeed, while the photographers' journals offer no evidence of Powell's developing thought, the photographs themselves provide not only a visual journal of the expedition but also a corresponding expression of Powell's emerging theories about geologi- cal process along the Colorado River. The Content of the Photographs Many of the photographs are clearly narrative, telling the story of the river trip. Some are mundane records, like brief journal entries, that show the crew setting up camp or repairing boats. Close-ups of individuals other than Powell are rare; rather, individuals are clearly subordi- nated both to the landscape and to the process of exploration. The most compel- ling photographs of the journey are those in which human presence is registered not by the crew members themselves but by their equipment-the apparatus of exploration.

They are also statements of gradual, incremental success-of having advanced thus far. They register the transition from terra incognita to domin- ion. Particularly evocative is the major's chair, lashed to his boat the Emma Dean, a veritable throne of command from which he watched for rapids and reviewed the unfolding spectacle of canyon scenery. The notion of a heroic journey accomplished was one that could be appreciated, even shared, by the potential audiences of the survey photographs. Some images register the act of record- ing by including photographic apparatus. In Hillers's view of Marble Canyon, a photographic developing tent and a box topped with a chemical funnel are visible at the far right. At first glance, they seem like another dark rock formation; then we perceive them to be the image-maker's tools. As Alan Trachtenberg has noted about pictures of a camera within a photograph, the result is twofold: first, the photographer reminds us that in spite of the realism of the photograph, this picture is still a picture, made by a person using technology; at the same time, the picture reminds us that a photographer actually visited the spot, placing the scene within a framework of actual experience.14 This self-consciousness of presence and affect is accorded primarily to the land- scape view; the ethnographic photographs produced on the survey generally follow the anthropological strategy of effacing any trace of Euro-American presence to sustain the illusion of a fresh encounter with untouched civilization. The long exposure time of wet-plate technology did not permit photographers to capture boats in motion, but rapids were nonetheless featured in photographs from the shore (fig. 5). To the adventure- minded viewer, a close-up of the tum- bling water emphasized the perils faced by the explorers in each boat. In another view inside Marble Canyon, the fore- ground is similarly composed with immense boulders (fig. 6). By raising the photograph's horizon line, Beaman increased the sense of physical obstruc- tion, thus inhibiting any imagined entry into the open river beyond. Human progress is figured as difficult, even impossible in this alien, unpopulated land, impressing us all the more with the achievements of the human passage that 15 American Art</page><page sequence="11">7 James Fennemore, View of Grand Canyon fom Lava, 1872. Albumen print. National Archives, Washington, D.C. we know has occurred by virtue of the photograph's very existence. Yet there is at least one other way to read these same pictures, one that has little to do with human exploration. Rather than identifying with the scale of human time and experience, the geologi- cally minded viewer could find here evidence of uniformitarian process, of "deep time" and a dynamic present."5 The rushing river is, of course, in Powell's view, the central agent of creation at the Grand Canyon; the rapids are the forceful sculptors of the earth. The huge boulders, which tend to accumulate and cause the rapids, are both records of the breakup of the canyon walls and the abrasive tools the river uses to grind its path deeper. A 16 Spring 1996</page><page sequence="12">8 Attributed to Jack Hillers, Cave Lake in Kanab Canyon, ca. 1872. Albumen print. National Archives, Washington, D.C. stable and forbidding boulder to one viewer is to another but a relative grain of sand in the continuing story of the Colorado River. While multiple readings of these photographs may have reflected the diverse expectations of their viewers, the mode of the picture's presentation also shaped response. An eastern collector of the stereograph may have been more interested in identifying with the absent explorer and vicariously experiencing an adventure on a dangerous river. A politi- cian may have been most impressed by a government report's visual evidence of a difficult and mysterious land conquered for the annals of military control and geographic knowledge. A physical geolo- gist might find in the photographs compelling evidence of how the earth's surface was formed. Any viewer might engage in aspects of these varied readings; Powell was certainly cognizant of all of them. In 1874 Powell told Congress that the chief goal of the survey's photography had been to record the structural geology of the area and to capture the outlines of cliffs and mountains that would be reproduced on the maps.16 Certainly his photographers produced spectacular studies of the profile of the land. But in such a mission, what is the role of the human figure that appears in so many of these photographs? The tiny person perched at the upper right of Fennemore's photograph of the river at Lava Falls (fig. 7) not only registers human scale in an alien physical environment but also serves as a geological measure. Sitting atop the cliff wall, he is a marker of man's recent arrival in the geological domain-a human cipher that tops both the strati- graphic column and the conceptual map of geological time that had been readjusted by uniformitarian thought. Here, the river is the great protagonist, the human figure more spectator than player in the great drama unfolding at his feet. Certainly the inclusion of human figures is a standard convention in landscape art; they allow us to locate ourselves imaginatively in the scene. Yet in these photographs the human figures do additional work. Their presence is part of what we could term the photographer's geological vision of the simultaneity of time; that is, while these figures clearly position the viewer in the recent present, they contemplate features that are the result of geological processes at work through "deep time."

What Powell found was not a stable landscape, but a land in flux. Through a physiographic reading of the earth's surface as nature's autobiography, the physical past, present, and future were at once linked. The metaphor of the land as a book to be read appears throughout Powell's writing on the canyon: One might imagine that [the Grand Canyon] was intended for the library of the gods, and it was. The shelves are not for books, but form the stone leaves of one great book. He who would read the lan- guage of the universe may dig out letters here and there, and with them spell the words, and read in a slow and imperfect way (but still understand a little) the story of creation. The Grand Canyon is an open book, the stone layers are pages, and the viewer is a privileged reader.

Not satisfied with this vast resource, he planned to enhance the visual record in a new way: in November 1872, he asked the professional painter Thomas Moran to join the next survey. Powell was well aware that Moran had accompanied Hayden's survey to the Yellowstone and that Hayden had used Moran's sketches to help persuade Congress to pass the National Park Bill in 1872 (Congress subsequently purchased Moran's spec- tacular canvas of the Yellowstone chasm for ten thousand dollars). Powell, a highly competitive scientist, clearly hoped to gain a similar commercial and political advantage for his survey. A painter of the Grand Canyon could help legitimize Powell's endeavors by linking fine art with that of elite science. Painting offered public celebration, commemoration, poetic commentary, and the aura of uniqueness in a way that survey photogra- phy could not. Painting also opened the doors to elite social and political spaces- gallery shows, museums, the halls of Congress-the domains of the educated and the powerful. The right painter could be useful in less elite spheres as well if he could furnish illustrations for journal articles, a concern that had emerged in Powell's publishing plans as early as the spring of 1872. Powell had everything to gain by bringing along a painter at what 21 American Art</page><page sequence="17">13 Thomas Moran, The Chasm of the Colorado, 1873-74.

In the late spring of 1873, Powell was losing financial support. For the first time, he failed to get the full appropria- tion he had requested from Congress. In fact, he received only ten thousand dollars, the lowest appropriation since his survey had been funded.'8 Perhaps as a result of this setback, he pressed his case even more strenuously with Moran, who made the decision only in late June to travel with Powell after canceling plans to rejoin Hayden. On 8 July Moran arrived in Utah with Jack Colburn, a writer from New York. The two traveled with Powell's survey for the next seven weeks.19 Moran's role was not that of a scientific illustrator. He had generated his own professional backing for the trip to the Colorado River region with commissions for illustrations from Appleton's, Aldine's, and Scribner's.20 With the geologist Thompson and the photographer Hillers, Moran made excursions into the region known today as Zion National Park and along the Vermilion Cliffs. In the main canyon of the Virgin River in Zion he made many pencil drawings, generally working sketches intended only to record plant life and geological detail. Yet even in such a summarizing study as figure 10, a view from the Temple of Sinawava, Moran's vista is well composed, extending 22 Spring 1996</page><page sequence="18">14 Thomas Moran, The Chasm of the Colorado (detail) beyond a dramatic proscenium of rocks, cottonwood trees, and cacti. Moran must have spent almost as much effort on his annotations as on the drawing itself. In the lower-right corner, pencil notes record plant names, and elsewhere brief color notes describe the red, white, yellow, and gray faces of the cliffs as well as dramatic surfaces stained by iron. The small notation "twice as large," inscribed in the sky in the center background, suggests how Moran had to struggle on his initial visit to capture the scale of this monumental terrain. Similarly, the penciled arrow that shoots above the cliff face in the left middleground records Moran's realization that he had not rendered the altitude correctly. Other notes describe geological features: at the far right the effects of recent rock falls on the face of the cliffs are documented with "radial sweep of large lines"; elsewhere he observed how the rock had been carved into tapering columns. The sheet is a compendium of quick observations to be recalled in the studio. Moran's party traveled to Mount Trumbull and then to the Toroweap, a dramatic area in the western reaches of the Grand Canyon. Moran was clearly overwhelmed by his first view of the steep inner gorge, declaring it "the most awfully grand and impressive scene" he had ever beheld. A pencil sketch notes that "where water lines enter the Cafion, they are generally white from lime water from the levels above." This observation exempli- fies how Powell's team was teaching Moran to see geological action in the landscape. Further evidence of geological theory appears in Colburn's account of the vista from Toroweap. Admitting his desire to see the landscape in terms of catastrophism, Colburn conceded that the shaping of the land was a product of nature's continuous processes and their slow rate of action: I think the feeling [here] is one of awe and wonder at the evidence of some mighty inconceivable, unknown power, at sometime terribly, majestically and mysteriously energetic, but now ceased. And yet the force 23 American Art</page><page sequence="19">that has wrought so wonderfully through periods unknown, unmeasured, and unmeasurable, is a river 3000feet below.21 From Toroweap, Moran's party joined Powell, and all left on 14 August for the Kaibab Plateau, where they camped until at least 25 August. They hiked onto the A stable andforbidding boulder to one viewer is to another but a relative grain of sand in the continuing story of the Colorado River. large Powell Plateau, which Powell claimed offered the greatest vista in the Grand Canyon-a rare, clear view of the Colorado River winding through the canyon's inner gorge (the river is visible from only a few places along the North Rim). From the crest of the Muav Saddle, Moran descended close to a thousand feet to make sketches (fig. 11). Although probably the farthest he ever went into the Grand Canyon, he was still almost four thousand feet above the river level. He hiked down through the layers of Kaibab and Toroweap limestone into the faulted drainage divide, where massive sandstone towers at the top of the Coconino layer are shown looming above him. These towers frame the vista of a creek rapidly descending along the Muav fault, visible at the center; the winding canyon of the tributary draws our eye to an invisible junction with the Colorado. Moran's pencil notation at the top-"The towers should be much higher"-indicates his ongoing effort to capture an appropriate sense of scale. Following Powell's practice of collecting Pai-Ute names for geographi- cal features of the canyon region, Moran noted on the drawing, "Pai Yuni Turn Pui Wi Neuv, name, The Three Standing Rocks in Muav Canyon."'22 While at Powell Plateau, the party witnessed a dramatic thunderstorm flashing through the canyon. Colburn described the event: Here we beheld one of the most awful scenes upon our globe. . . . A terrific thunderstorm burst over the canon. The lightningflashed from crag to crag. A thousand streams gathered on the surroundingplains, and dashed down into the depths .... The vast chasm which we saw before us... was nearly seven thousand feet deep. Moran captured this storm in a number of ambitious sketches (fig. 12). Using modern topographic maps, one can surmise that he worked at or near what is today called Dutton Point on Powell Plateau. Moran was clearly attentive both to the complexity of the rainstorm and to the terrain: the notation "SFM" on the mountains in the distance identifies the peaks of San Francisco Mountain visible on the horizon. Within the canyon itself, he marked the various strata with the letters R, G, and B for the red, gray, and black of the canyon walls. His rendering of the descending profiles of strata is sufficiently accurate to identify distinct layers. Particular buttes and plateaus within the vista are identifiable as well. The Colorado River winds through the left middleground, while the path of a large tributary in Hakatai Canyon is visible on the right. At the right edge of the page, Moran described a tiny butte as the "Sphynx," an apt name for a rock guardian gazing over a New World valley of geological kings. In so doing, Moran reinforced the survey's practice of naming distinctive rock features; besides Native American names, many literary and classical references were grafted onto the land as part of the act of claiming it for science.23 24 Spring 1996</page><page sequence="20">October 1873 found Moran back in New Jersey working up compositional studies for his monumental canvas The Chasm of the Colorado (fig. 13). The fate of the painting is well known: in July 1874, a joint committee of Congress decided to purchase it for ten thousand The West's unique landscape ... forced the scientific mind into new depths ofgeological time and inspired a new respect for naturalprocess. dollars and to hang it beside the Yellowstone canvas in the Senate lobby. Powell considered the picture an exten- sion of his survey's enterprise. That he traveled from Washington, D.C., to Newark at Thanksgiving 1873 and again in April 1874 to see the work in progress in Moran's studio indicates his engage- ment in its outcome. He may well have seen the picture as a key to reviving the government's lagging support for his survey. If so, he was not alone: in Decem- ber 1873 Hillers had asked Powell about the status of funds and the progress of "our Grand Canyon picture" by Moran, suggesting the proprietary attitude members of the survey took in the artist's work and the hopes they all shared for its success. Moran was so aware of Powell's eagerness to use the painting as a promo- tional tool that he cautioned him not to prematurely circulate the photograph of the preliminary underdrawing he prom- ised to send Powell.24 In that same letter, Moran wrote to Powell that he had "got our storm in good." He was referring to the storm they had witnessed together from Powell Plateau. Rain was clearly as central to Moran's conception of the Grand Canyon as it was to Powell's understand- ing of the area's geology. As Moran was painting the scene, Powell was stressing in his official report the importance of rain as the great erosive force in this area: "Though little rain falls [here], that which does is employed in erosion to an extent difficult to appreciate .... A little shower falls, and the water gathers rapidly into streams, and plunges headlong down the steep slopes, bearing with it loads of sand. "25 Moran's canvas presents an equally comprehensive view of the cycle of water, linking the sunlit pools in the near foreground to the distant rain clouds. The brightest spots at our feet are the little pools that reflect their source, the sky. The standing water and the deeply saturated color of the rocks both suggest the storm's recent passage. In Moran's painting we step into this natural cycle of rain and erosion. Water falling from an amphitheater, or erosion formation, collects in a tributary that descends into the steep, black gorge in the center foreground. A stream cuts around the cliff to an unseen junction with the Colorado River. The sky pours into the heart of the chasm, the tip of the rainbow pointing to the brightly reflective surfaces of the tiny stream. Everywhere the water dashes into the "thousand streams" described by Colburn. Other details point to the erosional cycle. A small cluster of pines in the left foreground is the victim of a recent forest fire (see frontispiece). Their ashen white trunks and the charred wood suggest the stand was recently hit by a bolt of lightning-a common partner to the flash storms in the canyon and, of course, a leading cause of the forest fires that denude the plateaus and hasten the removal of softer rocks by rains. Powell praised Moran for selecting a point of view from a plateau that had been deeply eroded by a stream. A review 25 American Art</page><page sequence="21">15 E. O.

University of Arizona Library, Tuscon S~ri:::: thousands of years have witnessed the progress of the work."26 In this painting Powell's impact on Moran is visible both in the grand scheme of erosion and weathering and in the small geological details. A prominent butte in the left foreground, whose wet cliffs glimmer in the sunlight, is a case in point (fig. 14). The formation appears to be based partly on the Holy Grail Temple, a butte named by Powell that appears in the far left of Moran's pencil sketch of the view from Powell Plateau (see fig. 12). The surface of the cliff wall is decidedly anthropomorphic, reminiscent of a classical frieze. One imagines the figures are seated and hold lances or staffs; many seem to be wearing helmets like Olympian gods. Although it has been proposed that the details of this butte pay homage to the presence of Native Ameri- can ruins in the canyon,27 the architec- tural frieze suggested here is decidedly Western, even Hellenic, and not Anasazi. Moran's invention probably reflected Powell's tendency to use classical architec- tural metaphors (primarily in his journal- istic writing, not his scientific prose) to describe cliff features in familiar cultural terms-as the dominion won by exploration. Art as Geology Having considered the impact Powell had on Moran, one could also ask what impact the artist had on the geologist. Powell praised Moran's painting for the truthfulness of its overall impression-"a most composite picture, a picture of many pictures." At the least, Moran's artistic style surely encouraged Powell at the very time he was composing his official report for the Smithsonian. Much has been written about this report, which has two parts-a flowery adventure narrative, allegedly a journal of the 1869 trip, and a more descriptive and theoretical scientific account. While Powell's preliminary reports are specific accounts of the field season in question, the journal section in his final report conflates three seasons. Despite Powell's later claim that he revised his journal only with corrections necessitated by its hasty writing in camp, his attitude toward history here parallels that of Moran's toward visual experience, that is, to gather data carefully, then edit and synthesize.28 In short, the best truth was not literal but representative and engaging. Powell may have felt encour- aged in this literary direction by the drama and persuasiveness of Moran's visual rhetoric. Powell was working in a competitive environment: Hayden and King both had substantial volumes out, and Wheeler had already published his 27 American Art</page><page sequence="23">17 Thomas Moran, Noon-Day Rest in Marble Canon, 1874.

Powell's action-packed adventure tale was designed to impress both the popular and the political reader at a time when future appropriations were at stake. Images play a central role in Powell's official report; many are engraved illustra- tions drawn by Moran or H. H. Nichols after photographs taken by Hillers. However, the illustrations for the first section, the narrative, depart as freely from their photographic sources as does Powell's text from actual chronology. Powell reproduced many of the images he was also using at the time to illustrate his two popular essays for Scribner's in 1875.29 The considerable overlap in the illustra- tions used in the two publications sug- gests the common ground of representa- tion in spheres that appeared to be discrete. Some of the illustrations in the 1869 journal even include blatant anachro- nisms, such as the presence of stereograph cameras, which were not used until the 1871 expedition. But most illustrations simply elaborate features present in the survey photographs. The transformation in mood, however, could be radical. Moran tended to make striking geological features even more dramatic and weird. An impressive photograph of an erosional column in Glen Canyon (fig. 15) became, in Moran's version (fig. 16), a haunting 28 Spring 1996</page><page sequence="24">19 Jack Hillers, Wu-Nav-Ai Gathering Seeds, 1871-72, Indians of the Colorado River series.

In this view the rock cleavage along joint fractures dis- solves into a clothlike shroud draped around a massive figure. Moran also extended the finger of water that sur- rounds the rock formation into a full river bend, thus encompassing the stone with a vast reflective surface that intensifies the image's brooding anxiety. Powell's narration of the voyage evokes a similar mood: "Danger and toil were endured in those gloomy depths, where ofttimes clouds hid the sky by day and but a narrow zone of stars could be seen at night."30 Moran's scenes were appropriate to Powell's journal, which mixed observa- tion, personal reflection, and memory. The second part of Powell's report is a more serious scientific treatise devoted to geological description and analysis. Although it is illustrated with strati- graphic charts and maps, Powell also included Moran's interpretations of geological and topographic data. For example, Moran's illustration of Marble Canyon (fig. 17), based closely on one of Hillers's photographs of Marble Canyon (fig. 18), accentuates the height of the cliffs and straightens their profiles to increase their verticality. Moran also extended the shoreline to create an illusion of even deeper space. The result is both a sense of claustrophobia and of human diminution, which enhances our appreciation for the act of exploration announced by the boat prominently figured in the foreground. While Powell's extensive work as an ethnographer is not under consideration here, the representation of Native Ameri- cans in the survey reports was also 29 American Art</page><page sequence="25">21 William Henry Holmes, Panorama from Point Sublime, 1882.

Dibner Library, National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution manipulated, like the landscapes, to achieve popular appeal. In 1873 Moran accompanied Hillers to the Kaibab Plateau to make stereograph views of the Pai-Utes. As Don Fowler has demon- strated, Hillers and Moran posed the native people in "effective attitudes," including clothing fabricated by Powell's sister and fake feather headdresses, to fulfill eastern expectations of "authentic" Indian culture.31 A further example reveals how Powell could endorse standard 30 Spring 1996</page><page sequence="26">conventions of exoticism at the expense of ethnographic accuracy. His publications re-present a female Mo-a-pa-ri-ats woman from the Virgin River area in a striptease that robs her first of her clothes and then of her identity. A photograph by Jack Hillers (fig. 19) of a woman in native dress gathering "ak" seeds identifies her with her proper name, Wu-Nav-Ai. In Powell's Smithsonian report, the same woman, still identified by her name, appears nude in an engraving, in which 31 American Art</page><page sequence="27">she discreetly stands behind a bush that covers her below the waist. The same image then circulated to its most popular venue, Powell's essay in Scribner's, where the woman loses her native identity by being renamed-significantly-"Godiva" (fig. 20). In naturalizing the aboriginal for Euro-American viewers, these images extended the survey's work of mapping and surveying the land into the intellec- tual appropriation of native bodies and culture. The Courses Separate Following the the success of his Smithsonian report, Powell turned increasingly from fieldwork to politics in Washington. He hired other geologists, notably Clarence Dutton and Grove Karl Gilbert, to complete the survey of the Grand Canyon area, and in 1879 he moved into a major administrative post at the Bureau of Ethnology; in 1881 he became the second director of the U.S. Geological Survey. Although he contin- ued to buy an occasional small painting from Moran, the personal relationship of artist and geologist had become distant by the end of the century. It was tourism, not science, that occupied Moran in the closing years of the century. From the early 1890s until his death in 1926, Moran worked with the Santa Fe Rail- road, producing popular Grand Canyon scenes to be displayed in the railroad's hotels or reproduced on napkins and menus.32 Following the completion of Powell's work, the next major survey of the Colorado River region was carried out by Clarence Dutton for the U.S. Geological Survey. His report, published in 1882, is a critical juncture in the history of scientific illustration.33 Dutton illustrated his report with work by two artists, Moran and William Henry Holmes. Moran's representations here are much like those he had done for Powell in 1873-75: space and scale are often distorted, and features are reorganized for the sake of dramatic or picturesque effect. Moran tended to make striking geological features even more dramatic and weird. Holmes, however, was a trained geologist and amateur artist who, having worked in the field with Dutton in 1880, brought an exacting topographic vision to the task of representation (fig. 21). His drawings are characterized by a tight rendering of geological features in which strata are so sharply differentiated as to be readily identifiable by stratigraphers. The combi- nation of conventional landscape devices in the foreground and schematic render- ings in the background gives his work a curious fusion of the real and the concep- tual. Further, his scenes are void of the dramatic atmospheric and lighting effects employed by Moran. Holmes sought legibility over impression, close observa- tion over generalized form, and the expansive view over the framed vista. Holmes's work stripped away the romance with which Moran had veiled the Grand Canyon in the 1870s. By 1880 Dutton, too, had debunked the romantic myths still clinging to popular notions about the region. Conscious of the power wielded by expectation, Dutton cautioned that "the observer who visits [the Grand Canyon] ... with the expectation of... a rapturous exaltation, an ecstacy arising from the realization of a ... grandeur and sublimity never felt before, is doomed to disappointment."34 Dutton dispelled the romantic fascination with the canyon's 32 Spring 1996</page><page sequence="28">depth and gloom that had appeared even in Powell's writing. He advocated the kind of careful and prolonged observation that shaped Holmes's clear, crisp images. The real magnitudes of the chasm only reveal themselves, Dutton claimed, with time, patience, and long familiarity--a formula of perception that valued the measure and direct vision of an illustrator like Holmes over the pictorial conven- tions of a Moran. In the 1870s, drawing, photography, and painting all played evidential, promo- tional, and even interpretive roles in the culture of exploration. Visual representa- tion extended the processes of observation and recording that led to the development of modern physiography and geomor- phology. Scientists and artists were politically and financially interdependent. Geologists such as Powell needed the skill of a Hillers and the vision of a Moran to make records compelling enough to promote their popular and scientific accounts. Painters such as Moran needed the expertise and organization of a survey to do firsthand studies of the remote marvels of the West. Exploration inspired a dramatic confluence of science and art. As the federal government grew more securely committed to the sponsorship of scientific inquiry, and as the requirements of geological illustration grew more specialized, the courses of geology and fine art would once again separate into their own channels. Notes This essay is dedicated to my father, Orlo E. Childs, a geologist who wrote his Ph.D. dissertation on the Grand Canyon, worked there for a time as a park naturalist, and, most important, opened my eyes to the beauties and complexities of the landscape of the West. He has generously lent his vast geological expertise to the research for this essay. A preliminary version of the paper was delivered in 1991 at the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, New York, Smithsonian Institution. I am grateful for comments and encouragement offered by John Klein, Katherine Manthorne, Angela Miller, Carl Resek, and Marilyn Symmes. I am also grateful to the staff of the Arizona State Geological Survey and to David Straight, West Campus librarian, Washington University, for assistance in making photographs. 1 The classic study is Richard A.

Beaman, assisted by Clement Powell and Hillers, produced at least four hundred negatives on the trip from Green River City to Lee's Ferry in 1871. Beaman resigned on 31 January 1872 and continued on his own, publishing several popular accounts of his travels through the canyon country. That winter Powell hired James Fennemore to develop Beaman's stereograph negatives; on 19 March 1872 Fennemore joined Powell's team as a survey photographer. Clement Powell continued as an apprentice but soon gave up, finding he lacked the inclination and skill. Hillers, however, learned quickly from Fennemore, and they worked together from April through early July 1872, covering the Grand Canyon's North Rim, the Henry Mountains, and the Colorado River between the Dirty Devil and the Paria Rivers. Fennemore resigned on 19 July 1872, having made only about eighty to a hundred negatives. His job now fell to Hillers, who made a total of more than three thousand negatives between 1872 and 1878. Many views attributed to Hillers are actually Beaman's. Attributions of the unsigned stereographs are best made according to the location. 12 Hillers, p. 141.
