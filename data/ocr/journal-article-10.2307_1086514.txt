KITTo, FERNAND CHAPOUTHIER, W. J. VERDENIUs. Entretiens sur l'antiquit6 classique, Tome 1. Vandoeuvres-Gen~ve: Fondation Hardt. 1954. Pp. 308. ($5.60) THE "Fondation Hardt pour I'Rtude de l'antiquit6 classique" held, in September, 1952, at a country house near Geneva, the first of a series of "Entretiens." The subject of discussion was important and con- troversial. The seven scholars who took part were distinguished repre- sentatives of five countries. Each gave a paper on some aspect of the common problem, and a general discussion followed in three languages: except that Professor Verdenius, whose own contribution was in admirably clear German, showed a Dutch adroitness by putting his comments on each lecture, with equal effect, into the language of the lecturer. This handsome book, which is the memorable record of what was said, is as international as that most international occasion; for, 35 THE PHOENIx, Vol. 11 (1957) 1.</page><page sequence="2">36 THE PHOENIX although it was published in Switzerland and is formally French, it was printed in Italy and aided by the Bollingen Foundation of New York. Mr. Rose, who is a native of Ontario and a graduate of McGill, and was until recently Professor of Greek at St. Andrews, is the author of the first, and introductory, lecture. This is concerned chiefly with analogies between gods and human society in early Greece. The gods, though not altogether without a moral nature, resemble Homer's "barons" in their lack of "respect for any sort of international code." They are all-powerful, but the barons, who are a "singularly enlightened aristocracy," are "on easy, even familiar terms with their gods" and display no marked religious awe or humility before the greater nobility of heaven. The theology of the lower classes, as seen in Hesiod and popular piety, is less transcendental and more concerned with justice here and now. In general, there is a conflict between the monotheistic tendencies of theology and the polytheism of the popular cult. Two interesting suggestions are made. "Hero," it is argued, was originally "gentleman or noble" and its later use as "potent ghost" points to a plebeian cult of the great dead. The founders, though not most of the adherents, of Orphism were probably upper-class: here there is a glance at the Franciscan Order and Methodism. Next, Professor Chantraine of Paris gives a detailed and precise account of the Homeric gods: the divine interventions, balypv (very possibly "apportioner"), Oe6s, the rational nature of anthropomorphism and personification, multiplicity and unity in the divine order, fate and the gods, "poetic justice." The discussion that follows is particularly helpful on poZpa and the importance of purely literary considerations in Homer's treatment of the gods. Professor Snell of Hamburg points out that Hesiod, in taking the separate figures of the gods and fitting them into a system, takes a considerable step towards abstraction. This point is well supported by an attractive interpretation of the names of the Muses and Nereids, which serve as the poet's account of the various aspects of poetry and the sea. A monotheistic tendency is rightly observed in Hesiod's search for the one origin of all gods and in the order of the world which Zeus creates. On the other hand there is the recognition of crudity and evil in the time before Zeus, the children of Night challenge, even in the present, the regime of Zeus, and there is the unexplained decline of men from the original age of gold to the wretched iron age in which the poet himself lived. Of particular interest are interpretations of Op. 3, where Snell finds the idea of Zeus as cause, and Theog. 11-21, which is said to provide a hierarchy of gods in order of majesty and holiness, and not of generations as in Theog. as a whole. A useful essay on the theology of the early philosophers is contributed by Professor Gigon of Bern. After pointing out the extraordinary</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 37 difficulties of the subject, Gigon begins with Hesiod's theogony and his claim to truth. With the philosophers, however, Gigon sees the origin of their theological speculation in a desire to overcome fear of the phenomena of heaven. There can be no doubt that philosophy must often have had this effect, but the purpose seems, as far as we can see, more appropriate to the sophistic age than to the sixth century. In Anaximander Gigon recognises a combination of the impersonal Un- limited with the personal actions that are attributed to it. This would accord very well with what earlier speakers had said of the personal and the physical elements in the gods and with Gigon's own recognition of the intertwining of physical and theological categories in Anaximander. However, he denies that the Unlimited is God, although he accepts the divinity of the innumerable worlds that are said to come from it. On the other hand he is right in recognising, in Milesian speculation, an attempt to find an adequate conception of the divine. The rarefaction and condensation by which Anaximenes is said to have generated the world from the original Air is regarded as qualitative and contrasted with the quantitative "separation" of Anaximander. This is surely to insist too much on a distinction of these categories in the sixth century, as if qualities could not be regarded as separating or as if Anaximander's "real things" must be simply quantities of the Unlimited. Xenophanes takes on a somewhat Eleatic cast, since Gigon defends his own earlier acceptance of Theophrastus' testimony that Xenophanes was the teacher of Parmenides and is inclined to accept a good deal from the Peripatetic work, De Melisso, Xenophane, Gorgia. Heraclitus remains obscure. Parmenides is dismissed as of no great importance for early theology, although it might have been thought that his negative influence, at least, was enormous. There is a good contrast drawn between the Mind of Anaxagoras and the Necessity of atomism: the one makes the cosmos the product of an art, the other admits only physical compulsion. However, Gigon denies stoutly that Mind is God. Finally, there is a brief but clear treatment of the sophists and the rise of atheism on the one hand and rational theology on the other. The discussion that follows is notable chiefly for what is said about the relation between the philo- sophic theology and popular opinion and for Snell's suggestion that Xenophanes B 18 refers to our gradual acquisition of knowledge of the gods and not to the advance of culture. Professor Kitto of Bristol, in his essay on Aeschylus and Sophocles, is more concerned with dramatic criticism, at which he is an expert, than with theology or religion. However, his main point, that the plays of both dramatists move, really and not merely conventionally, on both the divine and the human plane, seems to me true and profound. He is less helpful when he tries to state the relation between these planes. He thinks of the gods as symbols of an intelligible law that is</page><page sequence="4">38 THE PHOENIX at work in nature and in human affairs, but how this works is not ex- plained, except by metaphors. All this might have been clarified if the idea of law and justice had been put in its historical setting; but the modern reader, who thinks of natural law or a law of nature, is puzzled when neither of these views fits what is found in the plays. Indeed, Kitto himself has some good remarks on this point in a comment on the next lecture, and he shows his sense of this problem in his penetrating question (p. 193), "Is it not perhaps the case, that one of the historical develop- ments of the Greek mind, is in gradually disengaging the individual from the divine?" The late Fernand Chapouthier of Paris gives a very lucid exposition of the various passages dealing with the gods in Euripides. He recognises, as every one must, the critical spirit that the poet owed to the sophistic enlightenment and his evident lack of any unified theology. The novelty of this paper lies in a recognition in Euripides of what Gide called "la disponibilitg 4 l'accueil" in regard to all things human, including man's religion. In short, Chapouthier sees Euripides as genuinely religious, not by intellectual conviction but in sentiment, although he insists on the justice and the friendship of God. He finds a significant analogy for this combination of criticism with sensibility in Renan's Life of 7esus. This is a fresh view of Euripides that must be considered: the critical point, I should think, will be to decide whether his interest, critical or sympathetic, in religion implies a truly religious state of mind. Plato's theology is one of the truly perennial problems, and we are not encouraged to give an explicit account of it by his statement (Tim. 28c) that it is difficult to find the maker and father of this universe and impossible, after he is found, to make him known to all men. Professor Verdenius of Utrecht, however, gives a remarkably clear answer to this problem. He finds that the divine is prior to God, who is only a determin- ate appearance of that principle, which is, in fact, identical with the Good. Everything, therefore, is divine, or God, according as the order of absolute good is visible in it. We thus find a scale of the divine that corresponds with the hierarchic structure of reality. The individual ideas are a "transposition" of the Divine Good on the level of multi- plicity and so are gods too (Tim. 37c). The Demiurge, the maker of the world, comes next as the cosmogonical aspect of the divine. Lower in the scale come the world soul, the stars, and the gods of the city. The higher the position in the scale, the more abstract and impersonal is the god. There is much of interest, too, in the interpretation of God's care, goodness, and inspiration, and the paradox of man's relation to God. The lecture gives one, indeed, much to ponder, such as the explana- tion of Plato's apparent indifference to the conflict between monotheism and polytheism. Verdenius is perhaps less successful in explaining why Plato never speaks of the Good as the divine. He quotes the saying</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 39 (Laws 716c), that "God is the measure of all things," but omits the significant qualification, "for us." Above all, what need is there for God in such an ideal system? On the other hand, can the power and wisdom that is, for Plato, the cause of the world be reduced to an aspect of an eternally self-subsistent, but eternally transcendent, reality? No one expects a book of this kind to prove a thesis or to deal system- atically with its subject. Nevertheless, a number of themes, such as the cooperation of God and man, recur and gain illumination from the varied contexts in which they are considered. Most useful of all, of course, is the interplay of methods and points of view in dealing with the common subject. Here politeness, which is sometimes obtrusive, does not always conceal sharp differences, and these are instructive. The Foundation has made a stimulating beginning. We shall look forward to the publication of more discussions held under its genial auspices. LEONARD WOODBURY</page></plain_text>
