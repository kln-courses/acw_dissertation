The spectator of opera, sensuously enveloped In voice and song, may grasp rather little that Is Intelligible, short of the complex analytical listening which the musically-educated spec- tator can undertake to do* The spectator of an opera-film, on the other hand, may perceive rather little, since, according to Gilles Deleuze, the perceptual, phenomenal domain Is greatly reduced In the cinema; that would mark It off from other arts J However, what little Intelligibility there Is In live opera, and what little phenomenal I ty there Is In film, may yet be precious for the spectator- 1 1 stener 1 s pleasure In the event of an opera- film - or In Its non-event; since It Is said that In both theatre and cinema, "nothing really happens". But something does happen when the cinema - rea Im ma I n I y of Intelligibility - lends Its means to opera, realm ma I n I y of the sensible; In the spectator, In the body and the mind, opera changes slightly. The double displacement of the space of the sensible Into the cinematic men- tal Image, and of Intelligible Images Into the gestural space of opera, perhaps does nothing to bring musical education as some know It to a larger public. But It makes the performance an enactment, for the first time and for all Its public, of what the mus I cal -verba I compos 1 1 1 on had always been (but could only be appreciated as being, by the musically-educated few): an Inexhaustible play of different modes (the Intelligible and the sensible), both representational , but ambiguously so, and In varying degrees; and each mobilised by the fluctuations of Its juxtaposition to, and dissociation from, the other. Heterogeneity Opera Is a heterogeneous form; In the long term, every one of Its three dimensions - musical, verbal and visual - can only be In some way Illuminated by a new revelation of any other dimension. With Joseph Losey's 1979 film, Don Giovanni attains a visual dimension which led Trevor Nunn to refer to Mozart, his - 20 -</page><page sequence="3">librettist Lorenzo de Ponte, and the architect Palladio (whose villas appear in the film) as Losey's collaborators.^ This article is not about Mozart's music, and Mozart will not mind; he does not want to be placated at every turn by assurances that Losey, like da Ponte, is opposed to him as mortal is to god* Here the viewpoint is literary, and its object is just opera- film. That entails an intertextual and heterogeneous (textual -sens i ble) space which is not as new as opera-film itself. The so far unique quality of the film baffles generali- sation,^ and so I have sought to enquire how operatic charac- terisation and cinematic form can interact productively, on the basis of separate examples of the work of singer and film-maker; examples which are both external to that opera, that film, and comparable to what can be found in the film. This extended range of reference does not imply expertise in film criticism or musi- cal analysis, or specialisation in the work of one film-maker or singer. Literary criticism often interacts with the extra- I iterary. From a modernist viewpoint, cinematic construction is highly representational; it can even be said to imitate the closure of sonata form.* Opera-film might seem an altogether conservative way of maintaining some currency for an obsolete art-form. But Mozartean opera, at least, defies the label of musical fossil; for its performabl I Ity never leaves the experimental level. The huge popular success of the film of Don Giovanni has to do with Losey's commitment to communicating thoughtfully and rigorously with an actual and potential audience; his Is an uncompromising art which does not need critics' explanations to mediate between the films and their public. It Is Important to recognise that combination of rigour and accessibility,^ and to appreciate Its power, which In the case of that opera-film has refuted an assumption that operatic production must be simplifying and reductive In order to bring opera to a public lacking musical education. The consequences, In our understanding of opera, of that extraordinary becoming- Inte 1 1 Iglble of an opera through film, will not be appreciated as long as our conception of opera- tic singing continues to deny Intelligibility. The passionate pleasure of opera can be a pleasure In the tension between the sensual and the Intelligible. The 1979 film's success Is a massive collective Instance of Guy Rosolato's "second side" of - 21 -</page><page sequence="4">musical pleasure, called jubilation» He defines the first side as nostalgic yearning, attached to bodily excitement and to the child's pre-ref lexlve play with words; the side of jubilation undertakes, within those same or I g I nary sites, a liberating Intellectual prospecting of the attraction that they hold. Although Rosolato's theory of listening thus assumes a vague, Impressionistic grasp of the sung text, It Is evident that an attainment of textual Intelligibility must be a great gain of power for jubilation, which can extend also to the listeners detailed understanding of the sung text.6 Whereas Roland Barthes's "non-representational" theory of singing may be an Intensified version of the time-honoured Idea that singing Is pure Instrumentality and non-verbal expression, the Losey film's revelation of the suppressed linguistic dimension within the mus l cal -cinematic sonata form may be a case of going back In order to move forward.^ To reassert the diseurs I vlty of operatic singing Is also to open out the work of figure In operatic per- formance. More basic than the three d I mens Ions of opera, and characterising all the three dimensions, Is that other heterogeneity: that of the two modes, discourse and figure. Where there Is representation, be It musical, verbal or visual, It rests on the disjunction of the dlscourse-f Igure combination.® Ruggero Raimondi, describing the experience of filming the role of Don Giovanni which he has sung many times on stage, refers to the painterly fascination of what he then formulates as the writer ly superiority of cinematic figure over the figurai potential of staged opera: "Like a painter re-working one patch of colour several times to reach the desired shade, In film one repeats the same scene five times over, and at the end of the five times one discovers things one had not seen or understood previously; the scene gets Illuminated In depth. One does not hesitate, In film, to take a whole day over a single scene, to go Into Its meaning, and to unfold all the connotations which Its enonce alone does not reveal. That Is the fundamental difference between theatre and cinema: theatre allows a more global vision, unified In time, whereas cinema puts stress on the fragmentary, which makes analysis possible".^ What I would like to retain, from this formulation of the Intelligibility of the musical- verbal text discovered In film-making, Is Its most obvious and explicit assertion; namely, that there Is more than one route to - 22 -</page><page sequence="5">Intelligibility: not only storytelling, the unfolding of discur- sive signification on the level of Implication and connotation, but also figurai Ity, the exploration of a depth of vision through the undoing of the sight-sound Image here designated as light and colour. What Raimondi experiences for the first time when making the film of Don Giovanni with Losey, the quite new analytical work on the level of the fragmentary, Is effected, precisely, by fragmenting the Image, and that Is a possibility of film which distinguishes It from the operatic stage; but It Is also a possibility of film not so commonly opened up by film-makers. That film-work which defines Don Giovanni Is also, however, a defining characteristic of Losey* s theatricality In general, whether In film or (by all accounts) on the live stage. The generating, out of a dismantled figure, of a vision of humanity on the level of the drives - a vision of almost any Interaction of Individuals, or group behaviour, or Institutional functioning, as the dramatic play of the life-death alternative - that could well describe the dramatic deployment, In opera, of musical com- position, for which operatic staging as yet has no equivalent; but also, that Is the art of Joseph Losey, and It Is also the proximity of his work to that of Bertolt Brecht; not just an "Influence", but a I lke-ml ndedness such that the two were able to work together without words. ^ The breaking-down of an Image, what Losey calls the "stripping of reality", Is exemplified by the vividly economical scene twelve In Gallleo Galilei (scene eleven In the Bertolt Brecht-Char lés Laughton English version, Gal l leo) where Barberini, now Pope Urban VIII, Is being robed, progressively losing his recognisable Individuality and, simultaneously, his capacity to resist the Inquisitors pressure to force Galileo, by the threat of torture, to recant. As theatrical thinking, that dressing Is an undressing. Losey1 s remark, that the scene would be comprehensible even without Its dialogue, points to a mode of theatricality In which the sight-sound Image (staged, or cinematic) functions, through the juxtaposition of disparate or opposed elements, repetition and variation, from negation to "synthesis", In a manner similar to a musical formJ1 Working In the theatre In that way, Losey says, led him naturally to film. - 23 -</page><page sequence="6">Certainly, Losey* s cinematic construction of Don Giovanni colla- borates with Mozart1 s musical composition closely, not by a mere visual paraphrase (which would not be an artistic collaboration), but by formal Invention; for example, by other such jux- tapositions of disparate elements as those which, In Brecht* s scene, simultaneously construct Barberini as Pope and demolish him as an Individual losing the capacity to say No. Thus the film does not so much re-tell the music's story as open up the Irony and criticism so directly performed by the Mozartean figure; It Is obvious that the music-spectacle link must even- tually be studied In detail, and that this will be the truly for- mal analysis of the film's aesthetic force, and probably also a different, new revelation of the music. The foregoing Illustration from Brecht shows how a character Is constructed-demol I shed by theatrical thinking which Is a conscious denunciation of pol Itlcal-rel Iglous abuse of authority. An Illustration from a Losey film can show how he uses acting and cutting to dismantle psychic structures determining, and deter- mined by, social structures. Losey Is not primarily concerned with psychology, If at all (with "realistic" behavioural laws, determinisms), but with unconscious affects, psychic reality, which he approaches on the level of the drives. At the same time, however, and always In Losey's films, the acting presents a vision of the person, which has an autonomy, In relation to the narrative, somewhat comparable to that which, In painting, Is not narrative signification but "paint". It can seem that Losey does nothing with that vision, which Is partially Identifiable with his use of leading stars. It acquires a passionate Importance which Is a defining quality of his films. The vision of the person Is as likely to be realised In a tiny marginal scene of verbal "sound effects" as In the course of a detailed character-portrayal ; or rather, the former can supplant the latter, as an atomistic splitting and multiplication of the vision of the person. That occurs In the restaurant scene of The Servant (1963), In which overheard conversational fragments, forming the Invasive background to a meeting of the central couple, have a reality function comparable to that of the Italian architecture In Eve and Don Giovanni. The restaurant Is a disturbed setting for a multiply broken-up sequence which - 24 -</page><page sequence="7">decomposes a human tableau of three very poi Ite- looking couples, only one of which (the most superficial one) Is a man-woman pair; both the others are same-sex couples, and In both, an older adult Is putting It over the younger one: a comic revelation of the male pair, drink-loving celibate churchman caught at play; a harsher exposure of the female pair, the pathogenic Intimacy of maternal power; It Is a view of a world where both the public sphere of masculine authority and the private sphere of feminine authority generate patterns of unavowed homosexual dominance which will overwhelm the tentative heterosexual feelings and moves of the film's central man and woman. The violence of the cutting, and the camera's complicity with the Insidious pattern of dominance which the vulnerable couple mlsknows even as It Intertwines their attempts to make contact, Is part of what some people call the "coldness" of Losey's films. It Is not an aboli- tion of passion; I would call It a displacement of terror and pity, from an uncritical solidarity with the young couple and antipathy for the sadistic servant, to an appraisal of distress and emotional cruelty as productions of the hierarchical society which Is that of the film and of Its public. In such scenes, the vision of the person given by the actor1 s performance - an object of knowledge and of love - Is In exactly the same site as the figurai dismantling. The obstacle of reality (persons, musical compositions, buildings, natural settings) exists alongside the dismantling operation, as a requirement of the film's conscious processes, which are rational and moral. The representation of the death-drive - In the line of a stairway, the decomposed con- tent of a restaurant's noise, the enacted line of a character's Intention - takes over In the figurai, sensual dimension. The non-narrative aspect of all this - the destructive attacks of the "camera"; the openlng-up of relationships on the level of the drives; the peculiar Importance of the vision of the person; the nervous Intensity of the performances - may In a free sense be called Losey's Brechtlan practice, just because he links the cri- tical moves of his film-making to the work of Brecht. He descri- bes Brecht's plays as "frameworks for living theatre"; screenplays, too, are texts which generate a lot of space. Living theatre, and also film-making, superimpose linking an unlinking. What we mean by "Brechtlan" does not stay, In Losey's work (nor can It have done so In Brecht's, presumably) within the confines of conscious, ego-dominated thinking; Its essential - 25 -</page><page sequence="8">moves ar© primary-process moves, and Its recurring represen- tations criticise (break open) the social from the viewpoint of the drives. I2 Are there not, In singing, powerful equivalents of such visual figures, spatial enactments which open up the work of figure In the song before we see the singer perform on stage or In film? There Is frequently a reduction of the dlscourse-f Igure tension In opera, where vocal Interpretation can at times get Identified with Instrumental execution, so that expressive form prevails at the - more or less great - expense of discursive signification. Where discourse Is reduced to a merely operative function, figure may not be eliminated but Its power Is dimi- nished and treated as non-existent; It seems, strangely, that operatic discourse may at times share that Impoverishment with scientific discourse. Somewhat as modern science pushed symbolic forms out of speech and Into the arts, opera can at times simplify the music- language relationship, and pretend that the music Is the sole dimension of expressive rhetoric, with the language functioning Inside It as unimaginatively as a grammar. But opera has no necessary reason to treat language thus; and there have always been brilliant acting singers who have known better. Such singing, whenever It occurs, changes the whole operatic work (as Maria Call as* s stage .performances demonstrated to the world), for, once a textfs signification Is elaborated In performance, Its figures come Into their own, which means that each utterance then acquires a certain autonomy vls-a-vls Its context, so creating a dynamically changing context for the utterances that follow.^ That Is familiar In good non-operatic acting, but rare In opera. That effect of propos It lona I force In the highly musical singing of Callas may not only be the site of the public's huge emotional Investment In her as a star; It may also be the site of the difficulty she experienced, her awareness of an element of rejection on the part of her audience, patently not present In all her spectators, but collectively present as a social given of every performance. ^ It Is not just singers, but spectators also who can prefer to suppress discourse and figure. Paul de Man's Interpretation of the "resistance to reading" can help us to conceive the existence of a hatred of language (an Idea that we can derive also from Lacan' s theory that language Is subjectively experienced as a mutilation; language acquisition, - 26 -</page><page sequence="9">If that is so, "divides the subject"), which may be one aspect of the love of opera J 5 Not all spectators attend an opera with a willingness to experience change, mental change. Music, expe- clally opera, l s the art wh l eh a certa In pub 1 1 c ( not on I y those who resist the art of Callas, but doubtless some of her enthu- siasts also) Is most Inclined to treat as a religion, unmindful of the Freudian opposition of art and religion, which fits the present case quite well: the former uses the stuff of phantasy to turn phantasy Itself Into an object of thought, of knowledge; the latter uses phantasy to make people believe. A modern representation of character Is emerging today In operatic singing, a revolution In vocal characterisation, although one might never know It If one judged only from opera reviewing. Perhaps there Is a time-lag between this new emergence and the development of an adequate discourse to describe It; and so one may as well experiment with the Idea that the new figures of the person In opera are produced as effects of the deconstructed language of which operatic texts are made. To date the modern openlng-up of character through the figurai movement within verbal and musical dlscurslvlty from the time of Callas Is not, of course, to claim that such effects could not exist before her, or even that they are limited to opera and the representation of character. For the literary listener, one easily accessible reference-point for the d I scour se- figure tension In singing could be the well-known 1963 recording by Régine Crespln of two song cycles, Berlioz* Nuits d'etê (Gautier) and Ravel's Scheherazade (Tristan Kllngsor), In which the voice of the singer-poet does not constitute a characterisation; nor should It do so. It can be added at once that there Is no suggestion that singing must be discursive, although the dlv I ding- 1 Ine between that which Is and that which Is not doubtless marks off strong personal preferences, one way or the other, among listeners. A great asset of the prolifera- tion of technical means for recording opera Is that we can have a wide choice of modes of representation. A remarkable non- dlscurslve singer of today Is Kir l Te Kanawa, whose vocal beauty and expression of feeling assure her not only Immense public appreciation, but also a capacity for acting which was widely acknowledged by the public of the film of Don Giovanni. The only h I stor I ca I point I am making Is a very modest one, which Is that - 27 -</page><page sequence="10">changes occurring over the last twenty years In the definition of the person, changes connected with the new uses to which psycha- nalysls and language theory are put In the social and human sciences and In criticism, and which are already affecting the representation of the person In many arts, are also to be found In opera. But the Implications of such Innovation, for the understanding of operatic works, could be extensive. A very extreme Instance Is the singing of Katla Ricciarelli, subtler than Cal I as* s recorded work. She Is most dazzling In her ela- borations on a type of very vulnerable female character (Alda, Turandot...) whose Imposed or chosen Inwardness and withdrawal place a strain on "communication" so great that propos It Ion a I force comes and goes under the Impact of expressive force; the transfer of emotion on to speech becomes such an event as to undermine discourse. The crude plot-structure of Turandot Is that of a public defloratlon-rltual, "justified" by the primitive phantasmatlc terror of woman that It exists to placate; but the opera's form Is anything but that; It Is the radical Introversion of that structure by emotional paradoxes. Ricci arel 1 1 's portrayal of the princess (Karajan recording, 1982) gives that form to the mind's eye, capsizes the too-repeatab I e structure Into the unique emotional drama which Is all Puccini cares about, and generates around her psychic pain a chain of death- life reversals of power, a "law of the weakest" that moves down and up throjgh the Inverted hierarchy of the characters; so Inducing the thought that If Puccini could not complete the last act's love duet, It was perhaps because the work of transformation he desired It to accomplish Is already carried through from the start, by the opera's drastic collapsing of Its structure Into zones of pain. Such a portrayal Is a radical alternative to the normal mode of Interpretation of the role with forceful and volu- minous dramatic singing. The same listener may well be enthralled by brilliant examples of the role sung by both kinds of Interpreter; I might just formulate my preference for Ricci arel 1 1 's way by saying that I wish I could write as she sings. But the kind of Innovation that her work represents, Innovation In the dimension of character as an effect of figure, Is often overlooked In reviews of performed or recorded opera; It often seems to make Its presence felt, to some of the audience, not so much as an acquisition to characterisation, but rather as a loss to something else, a falling-short of some other, - 28 -</page><page sequence="11">established expectation. Yet such Innovations show that singing Is acting, and show how reflective an art acting Is, none the less so for being non-verbal (not creating a text) and elaborated after directorial advice. It Is therefore not just a case of cinematic construction opening up operatic character In completely new ways; film maxi- mises, by deploying them differently, thought-processes already active In singing; and also, It seems, thereby teaches singers how to bring that enrichment back Into their singing. Raimondi 's recordings made before 1978 already reveal a striking modernity of characterisation, where the roles permit.^ Although he undoubtedly makes use, In the film of Don Giovanni, of the pre- recorded soundtrack to Introduce tensions between the two musical dimensions of the vocal and gestural acting, his recent recor- dings present the whole tension of expressive and signifying for- ces within the vocal dimension.^ His description of the contribution to opera of cinematic construction, which I quoted near the beginning of these remarks, therefore applies also to his singing of today considered on Its own; that Is, Intelligibi- lity Is reached by two discrepant routes, the exploration of expressive forms, like the light and colour of the visual plane revealed during the filming; and a kind of storytelling In which signification Is fragmented and analysed. Such Interpretative work sometimes receives reviewers' attention. My own descrip- tion, notwithstanding Its literary tangent and Its purpose of Investigating the links of operatic discourse to cinematic figure, Is occasionally corroborated In press notices of Raimondi 's performances, when these are written by music critics who take the trouble to link observations of vocal technique with questions of signification. Jacques Lonchampt, In his review of the Opera d'Avignon production of Massenet's Don Quichotte (Le Monde, Paris, 27 April 1983), reported finding Raimondi at first unconvincing In an opera and a production for which the critic had little respect; however, the singer "moves slowly Into his role, opening up Its legendary material, epic In the windmill scene, full of pathos when he Is In the hands of the bandits, tragic In the proposal of marriage to Dulcinee, when his body slowly crumples, broken by age and love, while the frivolous woman laughs at him, before the sublime death scene In which Don Quichotte Is as If crucified on a plain In Casti I le. His voice, - 29 -</page><page sequence="12">a little limited In the lower register, but controlled with a suppleness and gentleness which are moving to hear In this grand fauve, retrieves something essential and authentic, a sort of absolute of goodness and human pain..." Lonchampt's review seems to make a neat separation of gestural rhetoric, the domain of the actor, to which Is attributed the presentation of literary allu- sion and narrative signification; and the art of voice, the domain of the singer, of expressive force and aesthetic form. But It Is more likely that the singing also signifies, and the gestural acting also fragments and constitutes the form. The view that the two disparate modes are condensed Into each element of the performance Is given by Hilary Finch (The Times, London, 23 August 1982), who wrote of Raimondi 's execution of the Confutati s In Verdi's Regulem at the Edinburgh Festival, that It was able to "move from satanlc fear to human pleading within seconds, always joying In his astute awareness of the melodic and harmonic shape of each line"; his singing was "the more moving for his concentration of human fear and awe Into the precise colouring of each vowel and phrase". In that account, the singer's storytelling Is understood as coinciding with the aesthetic form, because his Internalised Interpretation operates on the micro-level of the sma 1 1 est fragments of a linguistic unit, which are also the smallest phonic (sensory, sensual, "painterly") units. The Interest of this meeting-place of literary and musical descriptions of a singer's exceptional artistry Is that, whereas my description arises from a willingness to regard the linguistic and aesthetic dimensions of the performance as heterogeneous and unlinked, the music critics reach theirs by an unusual effort to 1 1 nk the conception of voice as a pure expressive Instrument for formal execution, to the domain of acting as storytelling and as a kind of writing. It Is a meeting-place where linking and unlinking Intersect. The Implication of that comparison of the ways In which literary and music critics can describe the kind of vocal perfor- mance which Raimondi Is now making his own, Is that In such per- formances, there Is a breaking-down of the conventional music- language opposition, and concomitantly, an erosion of the operatic hierarchy which subsumes language and spectacle under music. In place of that opposition and hierarchy, there Is a multiplicity of different dimensions and levels, which can be - 30 -</page><page sequence="13">viewed from an angle which emphasises their disjunction, or from an angle which seeks their articulation. Comparing these two angles has shown us that the disjunction and the articulation are one and the same thing; and so, from either a literary or a musi- cal viewpoint, it becomes appropriate to speak of the aesthetic force of such performance In terms of a fundamental operatic heterogeneity of forces. There is no loss to music, in this changing of opposition and hierarchy into difference; although Raimondi1 s work sometimes gets criticised, its high musical i ty is never questioned. But it is an inventive musical îty, an art, not a religion; and however perfect the closure of trie musical com- position being performed, the operatic juxtaposition of disparate dimensions of equivalent value entails articulations of the three systems with one another, so that they are therefore not per- fectly closed; there are, then, openings of the musical figure on to the workings of the verbal and visual figure, even If It Is no easy matter for anyone to state with precision what these ope- nings are. The divergence of the painting and writing functions, and their opening to one another (the process most nearly described, probably, in the quoted words of Hilary Finch) also break down the opposition of singer and actor. By extension, moreover, that tension and openness of the s Inger1 s divergent modes unsettles the conventional hierarchy of creator and interpreter, the superiority of the artistic processes of a director over those of a performer; for It Is possible to see those processes as the same in both, however diverse their pro- ductions. Heterogeneity Is exactly what Brecht says opera lacks. He globally distrusts opera for what he sees as Its degrading fusion of different arts to the detriment of the power of each. He therefore calls opera witchcraft, a cauldron for melting down Independence of thought, Into which the spectator Is the last Item to be thrown. In Mahagonny, Brecht undertakes to make a fresh start, to undo the fusion of music, words and spectacle J® On a certain level, of course, for classical opera, the sense of Brecht's term "fusion" is clear and unquestionable; but on another level, It refers more to a doctrine than to a reality. I would suggest that Brecht1 s attraction to opera is partly due to Its being constituted of disparate modes of representation which can certainly often be thought of as In competition or contradi c- - 31 -</page><page sequence="14">ti on with one another; It Is as If opera was an art form waiting for Brecht to maximise the discrepancies among Its elements. I referred earlier to what Losey's film-making has In common with Brecht I an dramaturgy, the generating of a vision of humanity out of a dismantled figure; and I suggested that the procedures Involved are analogous to those of musical composition and more especially, when carried out on the level of the representation of the drives, as In Losey's films, analogous to operatic com- position. In opera, It Is said, the non-musical dimensions are made to conform to the musical representation and to "fuse" with the music.19 But If one considers an opera In the light of Its vision of humanity - the operatic action, the total sight-sound Image of man that It proffers - then, compared to almost any other artistic vision of humanity, It must above all be said to be multiply split and scattered In both time and space. Deferred effect Is a fundamental factor of displacement In musical listening: much Is written about the power of repetition, In musical syntax, to make acceptable what at first hearing cannot seem justified, or really be heard.20 In the operatic context, that effect serves to represent characters, situations and so on by a kind of temporal spacing which, within the musical com- position, Is certainly highly organised and structured, above all In those works of the repertory of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries which are relevant to this article; and yet at the same time, considered on the level of the character or situation being represented, that spacing may well be a random scattering or dissemination quite radically at odds with the convention of pre- senting operatic character as a wholly předeš I gnated type. That becomes the more undeniable, from the moment that we are willing to Include, with the musical element, the linguistic and visual elements, as parts of that construction of characters or situations. Furthermore, In addition to this temporal spacing or dissemination, character, In opera, Is a series and/or simulta- neity of events which take place In at least two quite separate places, In the singer and the playing of the orchestra; and fre- quently, the orchestra paints a different portrait from the self- depict I on given In the singing. To that can be added the fact that a character can also be - as Is Don Giovanni - to a large extent depicted In the words and music of other characters, where he may have quite different attributes again from those repre- sented In the parts of the music and the slnglng-actlng perfor- - 32 -</page><page sequence="15">mance which are given as portraying him "directly". This Is not so much a constructing as a dismantling of character. The doctrine of the operatic fusion of music, language and spectacle, and all the work which Is done to produce, In practice, an appearance or effect of fusion, are ways (partially necessary, I do not doubt) of covering this essential spllttlng-up of an effect which never corresponds to a total Image, but to a multiplicity of diverse spatial-temporal locations and dimensions and modes of representation. That description seeks to stress the fact that, within the experience of an opera structured like Mozart's as an Instrumen- tal composition, the listener-spectator's perception of a character does not adhere to a sonata form; It Is, on the contrary, Inexorably anthropomorphic. But that fact often turns round upon Itself, since "anthropomorphism" is the name of an Imaginary move to impose on the world a reassuring Image of man as a totality, a unified whole. Thus, whereas a Mozart opera represents a dramatic action and Is not at all a mirror of a self, Its representation of character can become wishfully Iden- tified, as a vision of humanity, with the closure of the work's form. However, as the foregoing paragraph tried to Indicate, there cannot be any such Identification of any given character with the sonata form in which It Is engendered. But I have also tried to suggest that there Is an advantage for a figurai concep- tion In the fragmented reality of a character In operatic performance: an anthropomorphism de- formed by the primary pro- cesses. We read In Rosen not just that late eighteenth-century aesthetics shifts from the Imitation of sentiment towards a con- ception of music as an independent system, but also that In Mozart, the corruption of sentimental values by violence and sen- suality subverts all wishful Interpretations of the musical totality.21 So let us reverse the move just described, to fuse character with sonata form; and assert the separation of that form, which is highly unified, from character, which Is necessarily anthropomorphic: and that must mean ununified. That gives a place to language Inside an Instrumental composition which, as such, can do without It. But the Mozart-da Ponte characters cannot do without It. - 33 -</page><page sequence="16">Performance Musical commentary on a singer's vocal technique, and literary commentary on his Interpretation of the poetic text, both miss what I would like to see described: the singer's reali- sation of a role In the sensible-Intelligible space, that Is, the operatic character-effect, the mimesis, which Is completed In the spectator. That effect Is not accessible to a description grounded In semlologlcal codifications of discourse and musical discourse, since It Is an event; the performance as represen- tation Is only knowable through the energy of the performance, and the energy that the spectator Invests In the performance. That energy from two sites becomes the reality of the character, because seeing creates new representations. A performance Is a unique juxtaposition of energy and representat I on , momentarily generating a mimesis. A description of opera In performance must be fragmentary, and focussed on a few details; for how could one do justice to the partage des voix, the dividing-sharing of voices, the multiplicity of singular and differentiated Interpre- tations which converge In such a performance?22 We are In the uncodlflable space of an event; It Is traversed by the force of codes, but the codes are not that space, which Is constituted within the articulations of the three dimensions, musical, verbal and visual, that a given Interpreter effects In the singular per- formance. Yet the space Is figurai, generated out of the distur- bance of the three discursive systems by primary-process moves. It Is made out of differences. To describe It, we have to accept the non-sclent If ic and figurai nature of our own discourse. The language of the music- language relationship, at Its best, Is made of shifting and collapsible pairs of concepts which only operate as concepts long enough to create a situation In which they become figurai again. This does not mean that we should not use that language; nor, Indeed, that we must avoid entirely the semlologlcal classifications relevant to opera and to character. What has to be attempted Is a discourse both figurai and criti- cal . Some of Ruggero Ralmondl's own remarks on the performable character of Don Giovanni (which he distinguishes from his defi- nability as a literary or philosophical Idea) appear under the heading: "Chanter et penser le personnage". Thinking In singing - 34 -</page><page sequence="17">does not go without saying. The recourse to the trope, zeugma (consisting, here, of semantical I y dissimilar verbs entailing heterogeneous relationships to their common object), implies a first moment in which thinking was put outside vocal charac- terisation (chanter le personnage), before It could be asserted that It belongs inside It. Viewed from the perspective of theory, the trope actually depends on (and also performs) a radi- cal dissociation of two concepts, entailing also the disjunction of discourse from figure. The full Implication of the title is that what must be brought together In practice, for operatic per- formance to be an art, must be conceptualised separately In theory, for that art to be appreciated. "Thinking the character" does not mean referring to a body of knowledge about him, for Raimondi says that the role of Don Giovanni requires the performer to "divest himself of what he knows or thinks he knows about him". On the contrary, "thinking the character" is the Inventing of the performance from the non- 1 1 ngu i st I c I mp 1 1 cat I ons of the mus Ica I -verba I representation: Raimondi mentions, for example, Don Giovanni's passion, his sen- sual Ity, the lightning speed of his Intelligence. His remarks define character quite precisely as figure. Operatic charac- terisation is a work of figurai ity performed upon, within or on the edges of the accurately and sensitively executed "figures" or motifs of the musical text. Don Giovanni Is a character, Raimondi says, who must be allowed to erupt within the performer, with the greatest possible freedom from the performer's self. That describes an undlstanced Interpretation; however, the mental work Involved Is displacement (freedom from the self), In the Internal space; the work of form. Lyotard classifies the figurai by the triad I mage- form-matrix (corresponding to the discursive triad sign If ler-slgnlf led-deslgnated object); his c I ass I f I catory criterion Is that of v l s I b 1 1 1 ty : the Image Is seen, the form Is unseen seeable, the matr I x Is unseeable (vu, Invu visible, Invisible) (DF 283). The performer as self, In Raimondi 's account of his Don Giovanni performance, Is elided; the orlglnary model of this performance, then, would be phantasy (the subjec- tive equivalent, In Images, of myth), the matrix of figures, the mental scenario In which the unconscious subject Is not "on stage" but Is elided as "spectator"; for, If the subject were Involved In the scene, there would only be the subject's emotion; - 35 -</page><page sequence="18">there would be no mental representation. The undlstanced quality of the Inwardly "explosive" performance Is ensured by the performer's not showing to the public his own elision as spec- tator of his character; at the same time, the closeness of the derivation of this performance from unconscious phantasy ensures an extreme mobility between representation and explosive energy. A performance according to Brecht1 s principle of distan- ciation, then, would not be one In which a new externality of actor In relation to character was added; It would rather be a performance like the one Raimondi describes, corresponding to an Intrapsychic displacement. But the unseen-seeable elision of the actor as spectator would be deliberately made visible to the public. Such a description of acting makes sense In the light of Joseph Losey's cinematic elaboration of Brecht I an theatricality on the level of the unconscious drives - an elaboration which would seem unaccountable In terms of Brecht* s social critique alone, with Its Ideological opposition to the domain of the unconscious. As Lyotard observes, the artist Is one who strains to see the unseeable - the phantasy-matrix - anyway, even though It Is unseeable (DF 383). In live operatic performance, It Is possible that the relative rarity of highly elaborated acting, patently not a matter of lack of talent, Is due not merely to lack of rehearsal time In Itself, but also to the fact that the concentration necessary for perfect singing Inhibits the performer's Intrapsychic I Istenlng-spectatlng relationship to his character from having the kind of mobility necessary for operatic slnglng-actlng, for straining to see the unseeable. If phantasy Is the matrix from which the work of performance Is done, that would apply equally to undlstanced and to distanced acting; and If so, It then follows that opera-film Is even a necessary deve- lopment within operatic performance, since the use of pre- recorded sound frees the singers for acting. Filming with playback allows that elision of the self as 1 1 stener-spectator of the character as It unfolds. Some such hypothesis Is called for by the profundity of the enactment of the arias In the film of Don Giovanni; the more so, for the fact that the recitatives (filmed not with playback but In direct sound) are then accorded the time, the mental space, for contemplative and passionate slnglng-actlng. Of course, performance as such Is not phantasy (nor Is It myth), which Is always Invisible; character Is a men- - 36 -</page><page sequence="19">tal thing, represented as a visible Image (person); and perfor- mance Is the work of form which unfolds and unravels that Image; performance Is not Immediately visible but It can be made out by the spectator who undertakes to discern It. In an earlier article, I attempted to define operatic character from Ralmondl's film performance, as an "embodied" discursive activity, a reading not just of the semantic content of Don Giovanni's text but particularly of the "syntax" of the characterisation In the libretto and music comb I ned .23 The starting-point of that attempt was a theory of character to which I still hold, whereby character Is an elaboration of a type- portrait In which It Is the aspects not adapted to the type, the gaps between the elaborated characterisation and Its function for the action, which constitute the reality of the character.^ That theory places particular stress on the gaps between utteran- ces, and In opera, between any of the diversely-spaced elements of the mus I cal -verba I text. But the temptation of defining characterisation In terms of the features of articulation which ensure the transitions among all the written elements - of seeing characterisation as a syntactical operation - Is not ultimately productive of an adequate description of operatic performance, since It limits the description to linearity; It overlooks the heterogeneity of the two systems, language and music, whose ele- ments are articulated through the third heterogeneous dimension of gesture, the body, passionate energy. Obviously, no theatri- cal performance Is purely linear; It Is spatial and voluminous, "thick", as paint Is In painting. Its gaps are not mere pretexts for syntactical transitions, but are far more potent guaranteees of theatrical reality, of the mobility of character, Its figurai force of displacement and discontinuity. My misapplication to operatic performance of the linguistic model Is easily explicable by the present prestige of the linguistic system, not only In literary theory but also In musi- cal theory. There Is nothing which functions exactly like language; but the metaphor of a "language of music" Is widely used to Indicate that music (or some music) functions as a sign- system which has some characteristics In common with language. Charles Rosen's account of sonata form, whose patterns (not "rules") constitute the dramatic construction of a Mozart opera, - 37 -</page><page sequence="20">îs governed by the linguistic model, and made possible by his application to classical composition of the fundamental tenets (autonomy, coherence, unity) of literary New Criticism - tenets which perhaps find In sonata form, more than In poetic language, their true home. One may summarise a single page of Rosen's description of this Mozartean "language", to find it defined as dramatically representat l ona I by virtue of Its communi cat I on a I function, consisting of a generati vity grounded In its own abstractly patterned articulations ("grammar"); a powerful func- tion of designation (of objects, events, affects, symbolic meanings); and resolution or closure.2^ If operatic performance, joining two such similarly descrlbable systems (music and language) Is Itself a third linguistic operation, then It has processes In common with translation; but which ones? Leaving that question (as a question about translation) In abeyance, I prefer, today, to adapt to my earlier article Lyotardfs criticism of Lacan1 s theory of the unconscious as discourse: such a theory "omits the energetics". "It means making oneself an accomplice of the whole of Western ratio, which kills art at the same time as dream. One does not In the least break with metaphysics by putting language everywhere, on the contrary, one brings metaphy- sics Into Its own; one achieves the repression of the sensible and of delight (jouissance) . The opposition Is not between form and force, unless one Is confusing form and structure! Force Is never anything other than the energy which unfolds, crumples the text and makes It a work of art, a difference, that Is, a form" (DF 14). The linguistic model, articulating the dramatic potential of sonata form, helps Rosen to advance understanding of Mozart's opera. But we must recognize, at least, that operatic character Is figurai; that Mozartean character Is already, superabundantly, that "crumpling" of the mus l cal -verba I text, for which the criterion of visibility seems to be needed (even for the Image produced only audit l vely). Discourse on opera cannot afford to repress the sensible, It must be about opera In performance; syntactical articulations alone would not have made Hilary Finch think about the singer's joy In his singing. - 38 -</page><page sequence="21">Actor and Character In operatic performance, character Is figurai to the extent that a conventionally predeslgnated, highly codified type is undone; that parts of the character are detached from their codi- fiât) I e form, from their total foreseeableness, and subjected to pr imary-process deformations. The resulting effect of idiosyncrasy turns the role Into a "character part". In non- operatic theatre and in the best films today, It Is expected that even the leading players, the stars will treat their roles as occasions for character-acting; magnetic attractiveness is now pulled away from stable conformity and taken over Into mobility, eccentricity, a certain imbalance and excess. This modern deve- lopment is far less commonly seen In opera, but when it is, Its effects are considerable. Raimondi takes Don Giovanni that way; he did not learn the move from Losey's direction, for It has been a defining feature of most of his recorded singing; but It Is Intensified and Internalised since 1978. However, to describe the character of Don Giovanni as It arises out of character- acting is another matter. We were long ago put on guard by Sartre against describing a person as a cluster of tendencies; but descriptions of fictional characters still tend to be Just that. The figurai movement of character I sat ion is of course seen as anthropomorphic (only a semi otic analysis of character would set out to undo that effect) but that Is Its starting-point more than Its goal, which Is rather to change what "anthropomorphic" means, to give- to view the unseen and even the unseeable. The listener-spectator can only take up a position In the thinking- feeling of the textual-sensible space, and seek to ground a par- tial description In some element of the characterisation so basic as to be, with luck, an initial foundation of agreement among listeners and spectators. But only a foundation, of course: beyond that basis, each listener-spectator elaborates a singular representation, and It Is reasonable, on learning about someone else's perception, to hope for some surprises. It probably does not matter which basic question I put to the characterisation, since any one will pull the description Its own way; the Initial question I propose, then, Is that of the relation of the character to authority. Any voice at all, singing or not, has Its own perceptible - 39 -</page><page sequence="22">and partially analysable relation to Its authorities. Need It be said that the relation which Is discernible In characterisation - In artistic work - being a multiply-transformed derivative of the unconscious, Is to be regarded as external to the performer's personality? My observation about the aesthetic relationship of Ra l mondi1 s singing voice to authority - the basis which I suppose that other listeners would agree about - Is that It Is very loose* (Of course, one exception Immediately springs to mind: his 1974 Proclda, wholly glued to his Internal authorities through patriotic passion). The self-authority link, as such, whether of Identification (Moses) or of negation (Meph l Stophel es) or anything between those poles, Is not what makes voices Interesting, or characters real; It Is on the level of type- casting. But In many of Raimondi1 s characterisations, the authority-relation, far from being what Is taken for granted as the basic given of a bass or a baritone role, becomes something that does not go without saying, that Is opened up to question, generating a polymorphous figurai elaboration. The muslcal- dramatlc tension between functions then becomes a disjunction of the expressive unfolding from the representat I on of authority or of systematic transgression; of figure from discourse. That loose link to authority (In a register where convergence Is expected) thus makes room for the "other scene", a space of the unconclous In the singing voice. Scarp I a (1980) could be the basis for a differentiating description of Don Giovanni; his evil nature may offer com- parisons, In the context of authority, with the daemonic type of the mythic seducer. In his text, Scarp I a Is authority as power, Its deformation Into sadistic control and domination, and his own metaphors are vividly predatory and explicitly murderous. Whereas Tito Gobbi gives this role the full beauty of his voice, Raimondi makes his voice Incomplete. Within Its restricted emo- tional space, It alternates alarmingly between an extreme Inward- ness (Itself highly varied) and external expressions limited to two kinds: his brutal commands; and his Insinuating advances towards Tosca. Raimondi shows that Scarp l a* s recourse to metaphor Is the opening; that his external relations are the displacements of an Internal scene of massacre. A simple but subtle correspondence links the vocally quietest - deepest - pla- ces of Scarp I a1 s Inner space to his moves towards Tosca, and Its - 40 -</page><page sequence="23">violent sel f-aff Irmi ng climaxes to his assault on Cavaradossl. So, underneath the character's own conscious Identification of his eroticism with his hatred, a dimension appears In his thinking where we can hear their separateness, that Is, his Inner destruction of his love by his hate. It Is crucial, for the character-ef feet In the listener, that the first aspect of Scarp I a to be unfolded Is the mutilated love (the holy water). We do not hear a portrayal of Immutable evil, so much as a volu- minous, ever-changing representat Ion of a love that destroys Itself through Its determination to destroy the other's other, and so be fulfilled In the destruction of the object (which defi- nes sadism). In consequence, Scarp I a1 s murder by Tosca Is not merely a deliverance, but Is weirdly exempt from violence. There Is absolutely nothing In Raimondi 's Don Giovanni which could fit that description. The contrast Is not sufficiently explained by the performer's awareness of the chasm separating ver I s mo from the classical style. For Don Giovanni, Raimondi 's voice Is complete; that might seem at odds with today's Iden- tification of completeness with attachment; but It Is perfectly In keeping with Enlightenment self-love, and Is of Immense Interest In Its effects on the rest of the character I stati on, and thence, of the entire opera. The excess of this Don Giovanni Is not expressed In an outwardly relational way as transgression, like the fine defiance of the character In Eberhard Wachter's I nterpretatlon. Raimondi takes the seducer over Into excess In the mode of the passionate slngle-mlndedness of his own way of life. The passion Itself Is exactly the site of his Inner space; It Is what Is not fully opened to understanding. That space lies between the extremism of his passion, and the extreme tran- sí tori ness of his wish for any one woman. This perfectly sustained pitch of passion contained In the voice both signifies the "daemonic" In one certain form only - In the Freudian form, repet 1 1 1 on - and never takes It over to the rigidity of a symp- tom. Repetition Is truly pivotal In that way, a movement either of the death-drive (compulsion), or of the life-drive (variation). Raimondi 's Don Giovanni Is as voluminous as his Scarp I a, and more so than that, not because the text provides psychological detail (It doesn't), but because, from the start, he does not enclose the character In the limits of any psycholo- gical "knowledge". Nothing In the text encloses the seducer - 41 -</page><page sequence="24">inside the restrictions of behavioural categories; Raimondi impo- ses none, and the lack releases the force of the character. This singing treats the plot as a negative supply of Information; the character has tremendous energy, but Is destroyed from outside, not from within: he therefore has the powers to contain without damage that energy which his entire society cannot contain. That capacity, Don Giovanni's extreme containment, provides the drama- tic tension which is such a striking feature of the Losey film's Interpretation of the opera. Even before considering Ra I mondi1 s film acting and the contribution of the cinematic construction to the charac- terisation, we hear In the singing alone that process of "thinking the character" which Raimondi describes, and which does not freely deliver to us any obvious relationship of the bar I tone- 1 1 berti ne to his authority figures. Don Giovanni knows that others see him as a transgressor, but _he does not live his passion that way. His voice Is authoritative about the only thing that concerns him; we are brought to see that his passion is his authority.^ And finally, If we seek other performances recorded by Raimondi to which the Don Giovanni singing approxima- tes, the evil characters are no help; the very secular seducer's voice has more In common with the worshipper of the Rossini Petite Messe solennel le (1980): a very spacious expression of emotions, a sense of the sacred, whether addressed to an Internal object, God; or else celebrated as It Is acted-out, the loving pursuit of all women. All that precedes marks a decisive change from the otherwise current view of Mozart's Don Giovanni, often summed up In the statements: "He doesn't mean what he says"; "he has no self". Both statements are of course moral; Mozart disdained to charac- terise the seducer, It Is held, because he Is not really human. To have no self Is, in this sense, the logical punishment for dissoluteness; he who lets himself dissolve is not Integrated. In fact, however, the self of the seducer Is quite explicitly represented by the libretto and the music (sense of his rank, his honour, his courage; enjoyment of his reputation among others; and so on). The opera's power Is In this affirmation of his self-love anyway, In the face of his lack of any externally- agreed moral right to It. - 42 -</page><page sequence="25">The question of the self is an aspect of the authority- relation which may help us to articulate the very Inwardly- contained power of Ra I mondi1 s vocal character I sat I on with the outward-turned showmanship and seductiveness of his acting In the film. Our authority gives us our "master's voice"; our voice mirrors our object; to command Is to obey.2^ Putting that question of the mirror to this performance, we note first that the voice mirrors a force of which we know nothing except that the character loves It and believes In It to the point of dying for It; his Imaginary keeps him sane, and Intensely alive, but exposes him to external danger. In fact, the mirroring In Raimondi 's singing has already been touched on, and It emerges from the seducer's words: "E tutto amore" ("It Is all love"): the love of all women J_s his self-love, his "extended sentiment"; th I s Is a pi ace where the th I nk I ng of the En 1 1 ghtenment and of today can partially coincide - self-love as object-relation. It can do so, furthermore, on the level of critique: If we learn little about the seducer's specular relationship from Raimondi' s singing, It Is because Don Giovanni does not need mirrors, he has women to reflect back to him a perpetual ly-renewed flattering self-image.28 They are his greatest need, he says, greater than his need for air and food. One man constitutes his self by loving and leaving all women. Losey has been called a poet of mirrors; his Don Giovanni uses mirroring, however, for Donna Anna, and hardly at all for Don Giovanni. But that observation directs us the more pointedly to his one mirror scene, the bath that precedes the champagne aria. He dresses, seated before a mirror In which he displays no Interest, almost as If he doesn't see It. What he sees, Inten- sely, Is the scene Leporel lo Is describing to him, the servant's skill In handling the disturbance left In the community by the master's latest exploits. Losey focusses this scene on the man- to-man mirroring and shows a subtle master-servant reversal: this Is Leporel I o's competence, and as he tells of It he becomes beautiful, nobly eloquent and assured; Don Giovanni looks up to him, and takes up a hand-mirror for a rapid check of his own face, at that moment red-lipped (as he will be again, unmanned by the voice In the graveyard). The following frames show the two men talking In profile, a black-and-white double portrait framed by a window against an empty sky, which Is In turn disrupted by a - 43 -</page><page sequence="26">further opening, as Don Giovanni himself, pulling away to reassert his own role, throws open doors upon a long corridor, crossed with sunlight, at the end of which Masetto and Zeri Ina are seen to pass, quarrelling, before a fire with an Image of the sun-god above It. The overdeterml nation of the scene precludes any one analysis, but makes many possible. It opens up, opposite the contained quality of the seducer's voice, an empty space for the unconscious, Don Giovanni's "other scene", which can hold anything at all that his love of all women denies: the self's dépendance on sexual and class domination, a homosexual dimen- sion, a wish for the father's love, a sense of exclusion from the couple, a vulnerability; and anxiety (felt as guilt) about all of these. Losey's bath scene Is "unnecessary". The opera has no bath scene; It Is an added ornament borrowed from recent production conventions. For Losey's film-making, however, the charac- terisation of the seducer must at some point be an undressing. The trace of Don Giovanni's dress I ng-undresslng then stays on him through the champagne aria; It Is the vulnerability of his open throat, as he sings his most forceful self-expression; a contrast to the black Sadelan carapace of his travelling costume, and a presage of dangers to come. That Insertion of a vulnerability which leaks, as It were, from the added scene Into the rest of Act I, Is only partially a Brecht I an demolition which the direc- tor consciously controls. The bath scene Is unlike the rest of the film; It affects the whole film. Doesn't It get out of hand In some way that Donna Anna's mirror scene does not? It Is not ultimately Don Giovanni's mirror that counts, so much as the win- dow open to the empty sky - the same sky as that of Dal I a sua pace, Don Ottavio' s aria of Impotence; It seems at first that we move from that empty space to the "cause" of Don Ottavi o's helplessness, the seducer In his bath, but It Is rather that Ottavlo's space of unlinking leaks Into the seducer's bath. The scene Is not so much deepened by the mirror, as perforated by the window and then split open by the doors parting before a corridor of light. In the film's conscious thinking, the corridor links Don Giovanni's reassertlon of sexual dominance, by the "line of his Intention", to his next scene with Zeri Ina and Masetto; but the corridor also changes the whole scene of the démystification of the seducer Into an autonomous figure of woman's body... The - 44 -</page><page sequence="27">modern public of this opera Is much given to dreaming up a secret truth underlying Don Giovanni's pursuit of women; but the film, Instead of supplying the secret, works on that dream! ng, the public's and the film's; even as the conscious critique denounces a "castration anxiety" In the seducer, the film opens a space of castration anxiety within the denunciation Itself. The bath scene Is over deter m I ned, not as a revelation of the seducer's "psyche", but as the play, In a gap In the film's structuring, of the public's phantaslslng-about-a-seducer. Thereafter, however, the seducer never again looks exactly as he did before that scene; the character now partakes of the dispossessed space of the film-work. If the film-work thus performs a radical critique of the director's conscious, Brechtlan critique, does the latter then fall? Let us take that question by the detour of this one: Is It not Incompatible with Losey's film-making, that this film had the effect of making Raimondi a star? This Is not a matter external to the work; either to the opera or to the film. It Is perhaps the most direct route to the ambivalence of the myth's structure, Its side of delectation In the seducer's pleasure, and Its other side of delectation In his death; since the "star syndrome" In our culture has a similar love-hate structure. It seems that the phenomenon of the star Is studied much, and well, In Its social and commercial aspects. But I do not know If much attention has been paid to the fact that even the best films depend on stars, on their role In the public's wlsh-fulfllment, not only for reasons of the box-office, but also for purposes of aesthetic form. I remarked earlier that nothing leaves a deeper impression, In Losey's films, than the vision of the person which emerges as If unaffected by the critical dismantling of the camera. I could have added that The Servant provided an extreme example; Its use of a star, Dirk Bogarde, In the role of the sadistic servant made history. It Is therefore not accurate to say that Losey does nothing with the vision of the person; on the contrary, that vision Is the very site of the working-out of the aesthetic form. Not only Is the matinee Idol given over to the death-drive; the audience's perception of him, thus reversed Initially from Idealisation to extreme hostility, Is then reversed again In the - 45 -</page><page sequence="28">restaurant scene, whîch shows emotional behaviour in conforming middle-class people (the film's audience) which Is the same as the servant's; and the audience's "natural" tendency to want to Identify with the gently bred hero Is similarly undone. What happens here Is an aesthetic event which film alone (and Losey's above all) can bring about; and which Losey later repeats, dif- ferently, to transform the life of Mozart's opera: the aesthetic work (travai I ) Is located not solely "Inside" the film, but more precisely, on the trajectory of the spectator's Investment In the star; the director being the "first" spectator. The event Is a radical displacement of the spectator's Identification, generating anxiety; an anxiety felt even as a sense of "ugliness", and experienced as guilt (cf. DF 383-5), although the aspect of guilt Is doubtless mlsknown and projected back on the film. In these first days following the death of Joseph Losey, may we not already acknowledge that the ungenerous reception often accorded his work Is linked to the anxiety that It produces? Some things are taken personally because they were meant personally. It seems as If Losey's film-making "means" to bring out our anxiety, partly In the form of guilt; but It does not get under our skin by conscious Intention alone; what Is meant, In the manner of an unfailing Instinct, Is the placing of the conscious critique exactly where the representation Is felt to be disturbed by unconscious processes: that Is Losey's attrac- tion to danger. Losey said long ago that his film-work did not accept the constraints of an Ideology. His films' attention to the way In which social Inequalities and class consciousness distort emo- tions Is not of a different order from their obsessive represen- tation of the drives. There Is tremendous tension and unease In the layering of that conscious, ego-dominated ant l-v lo lent viewpoint over zones of difference, unlinking. And bulging out of the radically critical film there are those visions of the person, of which It becomes Impossible to decide, finally, whether they are mainly Intact or mainly voided, affected more by linking or by unlinking. They are passionate Images, and as Losey's films locate passion on an Intersection of the life-drive and the death-drive, their undecldedness must be essential to them. - 46 -</page><page sequence="29">If we want to ask what these images are made of - If we "desire to see desire at work" (DF 374) - we can only say that they consist of the character/actor/star. We can now see that that triad contains the whole figurai triad, classified by Lyotard as Image- form-matrix; although the two triads do not have a one-to-one concordance. The processes active In the vision of the person are two, and they are both reversals starting from the visible Image - which Is the character. Fundamental to these processes is the fact that we at all times see, on the screen, both the character and the actor (star); even though we do not see the acting (the form) unless we look for it, we know It is happening. When the spectator metaphorically condenses the character and the star, he Is pursuing his wish, "phantaslslng from the signified" (DF 375). That Is Illustrated by reports we hear of stars who worry about being cast as a certain kind of character which their public would not like them to act; perhaps an unnecessary anxiety, to judge from Losey's films. However, It Is evident that there must be that cinematic seduction Inviting a wishful condenslng-together of character and star. Losey always reverses It, but he could not do so If he did not first welcome It. Indeed, he plays with It lovingly; rewriting parts of the screenplay of Eve (1962), for example, to Integrate parts of the consciously-projected self-image, the machismo, the Welshness and so on, of Stanley Baker, Into the role of Tyvlan. But at the same time, the Tyv I an/Stan ley Baker metaphor Is destined to be reversed again: opened up and show for what It Is; and many times over. The second reversal, after the film has thus set the phan- tasy (the condensation of character and star) Inside the empty space of the work, Is that which brings us from the character to see what the actor (and/or director) Is doing, to see the work of form. The spectator's movement from character to actor Is quite unlike that from actor to star, although It Is work done upon the same material of phantasy; for that reason, I will use again the example from Eve. Near the beginning of the film, Tyvlan meets some former friends In a bar who tell him that It Is the first anniversary of his wife's death; he flings himself out of the bar and, one shoulder against the hard texture of the stone wall, he puts his hand up to cover his face drawn down by anguish and shame. His voice over Is reciting Emily Bronte's words: "If I forget thee...". The rest of the film unfolds that Image, and returns to the same place and time at the end. But the unfolding - 47 -</page><page sequence="30">of his "sterner des Īres", his sel f- des tru et I ve passion for Eve, Is not enough to elucidate the form of that scene; for that, Losey Inserts Into two later scenes a reproduction of Masaccio' s "Expulsion of Adam and Eve" (see Illustration), where the two anguished figures walk from left to right against a harsh stone landscape, gaze averted from the beholder; Adam covers his face with his hands; Eve's eyes and gaping mouth are drawn down by anguish. In the film's early scene, then, Stanley Baker, who Is being hlmsel f-belng Tyvlan, Is actually executing an Imitation of a fresco representing two people, one of them a woman. It Is through a long history of social I y- deter m I ned grief that the sexual couple Inside the Individual, the feminine Inside the masculine, becomes divided, and only In art that It can reappear: so the 1962 film finds a way to show what could not then be said. The abjectness of the Image annuls the spectator's disposition to Identify with the flctlveness of the a II -ma I e male, but In the same place as that annulment, the violence of the forces that subjugate the character Is shown to be the shared heritage - both the daydream Ideal and the consequent abjection - of the film's audience. The re-representing of Masaccio' s I nterpretat I on reverses the myth of Genesis, preparing a new mimesis on a higher sem I otic level. Exactly when those of us who like to see the acting can think that they are dealing with the naked Interface of actor and character, It turns out that the scene Is one of multifarious artifice; the vision of the person Is an actor's Imitation of a painted wall. So It Is exactly on the site of the wishful condensation of character and star that the film makes us see, with the acting, the work of form (cf. DF 384). That Is a surface description of the double reversal In Eve, adhering to the director's conscious symbol I sat I on. It thereby departs from Lyotard 's concept of work (travai I , which Is unconscious). That Is explained by the fact that the whole of Eve (self- 1 mage of man, Images of woman) Is In an almost hallucinatory dimension; the film has no outside, least of all In the directorial thinking. Of the Don Giovanni film, on the other hand, Losey said that he gave It no conscious symbolic elaboration, but that many things happen In his later films without his awareness. The phenomenon of the star Is not absolutely other than the phenomenon of cinematic construction, as subject Is other than text; the star "syndrome" Is not just outside In society, In - 48 -</page><page sequence="31">people's dreams and in the world of commerce. The star Is abso- lutely an object In the space of play, that Is, neither a part of phantasy nor a part of the real; neither an Internal object nor a whole object (an other acknowledged as such) but both Inside and outside, and not subject to reality-testing.^ The spectator's relation to the star Is part-representation, part-perception, or else It alternates from one to the other. Jean-Luc Godard asserted In a recent Interview (following comments about his direction of actors In Prénom Carmen): "La star, c'est le film"; It Is the film which Is the star.^ We must allow that that is so for him, since he says It; but I do not think the same affir- mation could emerge from a study of Losey's films. The space of play Is the space where works of art come Into being, objects which then endure as part of the real world. The star Is an essential component of the film, an artist whose person is his own and the director's raw material, both the support of the phantasy and Its principle of relinquishment ( dessa I s I ssement ) . The "emotional experience of space"-5 ^ can, thanks to the star, be transferred into the film, just as, thanks to the singer, It can be transferred Into vocal music. There is nothing aesthetically superior (or ethically!) In denying or decrying the function of the star In the film; It Is merely easier to approximate to a scientific description of the film If the aesthetic function of the actor-star Is left out of account. All these remarks are provoked by the event of the first great opera-film, for the juxtaposition of the sensual and intelligible means, as well as what has already been suggested, the sudden involvement of operatic character In cinematic form, in the figurai processes of the character/actor/star. The inten- sity of the public's response, not yet quite repeated for other opera-films, Is evidently partly to do with the potency of the living myth of Don Juan; that myth which Is not the same thing as the opera, but which the opera represents In a unique and criti- cal way. Let us use that evidence to summarise some major trans- formations effected by the film. The myth of Don Juan can obviously be described as integrative; It Is a myth generated by a religious and authori- tarian society, a story intended to demonstrate that the world and men are one, that the moral codes which make society cohere, - 49 -</page><page sequence="32">cohere also with the laws of the firmament. Don Giovanni, ossia Il dissoluto punito (Don Giovanni, or the Dissolute Punished) : dissoluteness, non- I ntegratlon, the dissolving of ties of attachment, Is divinely punished by death, by dissolution. That Is not a story which asks questions. The conventional manner of attending to an opera, with an Impressionistic grasp of Its ver- bal text, may allow the audience to believe that the great classical and Romantic operas are Integrative ceremonies, ritual reaf f Irmations of social-spiritual communion; whereas the study of their libretti reveals radical poetry which puts everything Into question. The Impressionistic grasp has enabled Mozart1 s Don Giovanni to serve for two centuries as the principal support of the Don Juan myth, which perseveres as a living myth unaf- fected by the wide spectrum of Interpretations that the opera has received in performance and In written commentary. The change which the 1979 film Introduces In that history can be Indicated, therefore, by remarking that the film presents the full impact of the libretto, elaborated in the detailed enactment of the perfor- mances and In the equally detailed construction of the sight- sound Image; in this way, the regime of the Impressionistic grasp of the sung text Is finished, and that of the intelligible sung text has begun. And, In that one fell blow, the i mmed I ate com- mun I cat I on of the Don Juan myth (a referential illusion If ever there was one) Is displaced by a phenomenon well known In the I Iterary domain: the text Is found to be many- level led; communication Is delayed. The operatic text does nothing, from end to end, but put the myth In question. The myth Is Integrative; but the opera libretto Is critical; and so is the film. One could formulate the work's (the opera's and the fllmfs) relation to the myth less negatively; one could say that a work of art which helps to keep a myth alive does contain that myth in some manner, even after one acknowledges that a literary reading of its text shows It to be something critically different from the myth.^ That formulation brings out the contrast bet- ween the opera's function in live performance, where It Is con- ventionally re-presented as the myth Itself, and so loses recognition for much of Its own unique work of form; and the opera's function In the film, where the figurai work shows the myth for what It Is, shows the gaps between Its operations of Integrative wlshfulness and the critical facts of the operatic transformation (cf. DF 147-151). - 50 -</page><page sequence="33">Don Giovanni himself, as normally portrayed by singers of today, becomes a mild embodiment of the other characters* nega- tive portrayal of him as a perfidious "monster"; that Is, he Is given as one who doesn't mean what he says and possibly "has no self". In the film (and before It also, apparently), Raimondi portrays him according to the positive sel f-assessments found In his text, his passionate belief In the Tightness of his own way, his love of all women. A most extreme tension Is thereby pro- duced between the seducer's thinking and the thinking of all the other characters. Losey underscores that pattern by undoing not only Don Giovanni's belief In himself, but also the other characters' moral righteousness. It Is undeniable that that very extreme tension characterises the music, as well as the libretto; but It Is not noticed that so much tension elaborates a critique of the myth. In his essay "Pour un statut sem lot I que du personnage",5-* Philippe Hamon suggests a schema for classification of the hero according to sociological categories: the Ideological values In the enonce, and thence the problem of the work's reception, of the public's Identifications and projections, which Is a h I stori cal -eu I tura I variable. The schema classifies the hero by permitted (social) and excluded (antisocial) relationships; for example, writes Hamon, the poles of conjugal love and male adultery are privileged In our society, and so the hero can assume these; but those of Incest, homosexuality and female adultery are relegated to the anti-hero and defined as the space of transgression. He adds that a different school or era would give the schema an Inverse valorisation (antisocial hero, homo- sexual hero, adulterous woman, opposed to the flatness of middle- class conformity, and so on). A schema of this kind brings out the Importance, In narrative, of binary oppositions, which of course are very prominent In the myth of Don Juan; they are still very present In Don Giovanni, although thrown Into question; In the film, the oppositions are broken down, revealed as wishful, and re-formed as the play of differences. As promiscuous male, Don Giovanni seems close to social acceptability In Hamon's schema; but he Is so extreme In his refusal of attachments and In the excess of his passion as to be a deeply antisocial character, recognised as such and treated as a villain. This ambiguity of the opera Is the film's opportunity for the double reversal. It - 51 -</page><page sequence="34">Is quite remarkable how close together are the pre-Revolutlonary year 1787 (the date of the opera) and the nlneteen-seventles and eighties, In that both are moments when what a hero Is Is In rapid mutation, and the Integrative (wishful) opposition of the social and the transgressivo gives way, at least on some levels, to explorations of less simply codlf table relationships and per- sons. Losey's films are all, In that respect, chronicles of our times. Raimondi took care to Indicate In an Interview, for the record, that he Is on the whole not like Don Giovanni; but that would hardly deliver him from unwanted aspects of stardom, If a large part of his public's Investment In that character-star con- densation were, precisely, an Investment In the Insight that Don Giovanni may not be like himself either; nobody's perfect. Part of Don Giovanni's ambiguity turns precisely around the uncer- tainty whether he Is a hero, or just some kind (but what kind?) of very Intense character. Raimondi does not enact him as a hero, as exemplary, superhuman or daemonic; the character-ef feet Is "just a man", but an exceptional one, belonging In the eighteenth-century category of "original" Individuals unlike others. There Is no suggestion that Don Giovanni Is a morally good character; but his own positive sel f-va I or I sat I on corresponds to the Enlightenment view that passion and movement signify life; thus that period tended to a positive attitude to libertinism and Inconstancy.34 Such a conception places Don Giovanni partially outside the good-evil opposition of the other characters' texts. It has to be borne In mind that wish- ful filment Is not only Idealising; It can also be persecuting and sadistic; this opera offers much to both those wlshed-for pleasures. That Is why, In the film, the undoing of the prestige of the seducer Is counterbalanced by the undoing of his attackers, with a concomitant sympathy and warmth In the portrayal of the seducer as well as of the other characters. But on the level of mythic thinking - for this still Is a living myth, that Is, It can be criticised and transformed by the opera and the film, but not killed - those fine differences are always reduced back to simple oppositions; and so It Is actually Inevi- table, given the film's deconstruct I on of the myth's moral manlchelsm, that Raimondi 's film characterisation of Don Giovanni should have provoked a polarisation of spectators' Interpreta- tions, from sadistic villain to hero of nature, life and love. - 52 -</page><page sequence="35">The polarised views amount to a reductive response to the subtlety of the performance and the film; but that Is because the thinking of the public reaction Is mythic. Whole mythological systems state social paradoxes which would be Intolerable If consciously thought; the Don Juan myth Is a fragment of such a system, and that can explain why a widespread Intolerance of paradox affects the reception of the film. The paradox of Ralmondl's Don Giovanni Is his capacity to tolerate In himself the energy that society can not. That Is what I call his containment; he Is disruptive, but not for himself. He disturbs a whole society, and yet his enactment In the film Is miracu- lously free of signs of Inner disturbance, behavioural automa- tisms or tics. There J_s a major split In Ralmondl's Don Giovanni; It Is between his contalnedness and his dissoluteness; linking and unlinking. Such a split In an Individual cannot con- tain the whole statement of a mythic paradox; but It Is enough to awaken resistances, which are on the soc I a I -my th I c level of the mind. So, curiously, the aspect of Ralmondl's performance which undoes the Integrative myth Is the I ntegratedness he accords to the man who Is hostile to attachment. Today, as also In the eighteenth century, many people eschew belief In mythic thinking, and so the operatic character, who always represented a mutation of social and moral attitudes, Is In mutation again; many people welcome Ralmondl's paradoxical portrayal, finding In It a new revelation of the opera. Those members of the public who do not tolerate the paradox, have In many cases concluded that the film represents Don Giovanni as perverse. But It Is precisely that paradoxical tension In the character I sat I on (holding linking and unlinking apart) which explains the fact that It has nothing In common with Ralmondl's truly perverse Scarp I a (In whom hate destroys love). In Scarp I a, the death-drive takes over comple- tely. In Don Giovanni, It Is In tension with the life-drive; life Is never any better Integrated than that, which Is why the opera and the opera-film should be seen as radical critiques of the myth. Charles Rosen explains the mutation, In Mozart, of the rela- tionship of ornament to musical structure, likening It to that In visual design, from Infinitely-repeating patterns to "a centrally placed point of tension and Its clarity of form", which could emphasise and articulate structure.^ If we consider how the - 53 -</page><page sequence="36">character of Don Giovanni unravels out of the musical perfor- mance, It can be seen that the operatic action, too, Is a figurai movement Indistinguishable from structure. We also see that In Don Giovanni» the very pronounced dramatic central I ty of the character of the seducer creates a clarity that Is by no means a matter of simplicity; that the centre Is repeatedly displaced and scattered across the work, and that It - the dramatic centre, the figure of the seducer - Is Itself a paradox. All of that Is con- tained In Don Giovanni1 s richest sei f-protrayal , Fin ch'han dal vlno, the champagne aria, where he commands an evening's festivi- ties "without any order", meaning that he wants three different dances to be performed simultaneously by everybody else (multiple forms of order) so that he can cut his swathe through the gathering, perform his own Improvisatory movement like a composer-v I rtuoso whose unwritten part Is nonetheless the heart of the work. So the figurai excess of character In relation to text articulates Mozart's style and Losey' s Brecht I an use of jux- taposed contradictions, which are ornamental devices that break structure down to make Its processes visible. Ralmondl's perfor- mance Is a major trajectory of that Mozart-Losey link, which he contains within the character as both his containment and his splitting. Thinking the character, from within such an Indepen- dent musical system as Mozart's, Is a large-scale Interpretation comparable to the actor's unfolding of a character by Imitating a painted wal I . Losey, for his part, never means to represent heroes; his thinking Is hostile to myths. He Is, however, very positive about stars; they are the way to undo myths. What he does with Don Giovanni Is, after all, already represented In the Masaccio figure In Eve; the harshness of the Christian myth's attack on sensuality Is no less denounced In the 1979 film, than Is that of the Book of Genesis In 1962. Losey has used the Masaccio figure In another film (M.Klein, 1976) and he has spoken of the fresco's Importance for him. Apart from the new representations that he generates from that representation of the couple, I see It also as an allegory of Losey 's films themselves; of the way In which the film - no star, but a secular reversal of the angel with a flaming sword - expels Its stars from the cinematic firmament of phantasy, and plunges them Into empty spaces of darkness and death where they represent (that Is the reversal of the biblical - 54 -</page><page sequence="37">myth) both tragically and humorously, not the triumph of seduc- tive beauty and Intelligence, but the destructive side of love and the averted gaze of shame; and where they show, by displace- ments of terror and pity and laughter, the work of form, the reversal of phantasy; their own work and the film's. For once It Is seen that the ornamental figure Inserted In the film's discur- sive dimension Is allegorical (whether It Is Masacclo's couple, or the bath scene In Don Giovanni, or the cabaret In M. Klein), then It Is clear that the film's operation on the actor, In general, Is a breaking-open of the wlsh-ful f 1 1 1 Ing aspect of the f I Im-narratl ve, to give wlsh-fu I f 1 1 ment Itself to view. That may not be what we love about the film, but It Is what makes the film art, and not religion; and as such, It rediscovers the loved opera. Peser I pt I on A small book by Bruno Bushart, published In 1959, presents a series of paintings and studies produced between 1902 and 1921 by the German Impressionist Max Slevogt, all of which represent the singer Francisco d1 Andrade Interpreting the role of Don Giovanni. 46 A commentator presents paintings which represent a singer representing a character and Interpreting a text, Itself the representat Ion, by a composer and librettist, which Is the most luminous link In a chain of representations of a myth that announces what It Is to be. In that representational chain, the content of the annunciation ceases to be the most Important thing, even If the myth of Don Juan Is Itself a cultural force. The essential thing Is the dividing-sharing of the voices, the "difficult community" of which the chain of hermeneutlc circles Is a figure.37 One can think of the history of the myth In terms of straight successions: chains of poetic representations of the myth, chains of productions of the opera, chains of singers, chains of Illustrators or of commentators. . . But the distinguishing feature of the chain I have just described Is Its heterogeneity. Its links have not only the singularity, the dlf- ferentness that Interpretations always have one from another, but are also disparate In medium and mode of representation. This chain has an appealing curl In It, as certain voices (or gazes) look back to see how the last voice showed the myth. So the chain curves around and becomes contained In just one of the many - 55 -</page><page sequence="38">performances that It contains, through the effect of enthusiasm produced In the audience by that performance; and then the painter's compositions contain also, with the performance, the future links generated out of the audience's enthusiasm. The story becomes Inseparable from Its transmission, and from the singularity of the one representation. The curl In the Interpre- tative chain Is not an Immobilisation; It Is a s I owing-down which makes different kinds of attention possible. The singer In the paintings can be seen as a figure of the "charged body" of the performer In modern theatre, and of the cinematic actor-star.^® The heterogeneity of the Interpretative charm-bracelet winding around the figure expresses, for me, an Impatience with the focus on homogeneous chains of signs endlessly Interpreting like signs. It Is not a closed circle. It Is modern In Its openness, and In the way that It Is not turned exclusively to the sign-systems operating In the work, but also to the energetic event, the work In performance.-5^ Representation becomes event, and multifarious description of the spectator's experience of the event. So the whole chain can now serve as a figure of the many modes of description made possible by opera-film, as can be seen In the singular Instance of the film of Don Giovanni, a further unique event In the chain of the myth and the opera. FELICITY BAKER, University College, London« FOOTNOTES 1. Gilles Deleuze, C l nema I : L1 Image-mouvement, 1983, espe- cially pp. 84-85. Cf. Jean-François Lyotard, Discours, figure, 1971. Lyotard treats film as the (phenomenal) domain of the visible, In the same way as he does poetic works. There Is a philosophical disagreement here, which need not deter my discussion. Deleuze holds that the cate- gory of "natural perception", the realm of phenomena, cannot apply In the case of cinema, which suppresses the perceiving subject's anchoring (ancrage) , as well as the horizon of the - 56 -</page><page sequence="39">world; whereas Lyotard1 s work Is a critical re-reading of the phenomenology of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, focussing preci- sely on the mode of definition of the phenomenal, trans- formed In his work by Freud's account of the mind. See Lyotard, op« cit., pp. 136-138, on the error of treating perception as external to emotion, among other things. Freud's thinking Is another large area of non-agreement of the work of Lyotard and that of Deleuze. The fact remains, for the non-phi losophlcal critic, that opera-film poses the relationship of the sensible (music and spectacle) and the Intelligible (film-Image and text). That would still be true, even If one Inferred from Deleuze1 s thinking that In an opera-film, the sensible Is strictly a matter of the remembering of live performances. But that Is quite unne- cessary for my purposes. 2. Trevor Nunn, letter to Joseph Losey, 27 October 1980. British film Institute, Joseph Losey Collection, Item 25: Don Giovanni, Box 3.
