<plain_text><page sequence="1">192 Altick Victorians and the Machine: The Literary Response to Technology. By Herbert L. Sussman. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1968. Pp. viii+261. $6. "Examining the relationship between mechanistic thought and mechaniza tion, whether in cosmology, aesthetic theory, the production of art, or bio logical science, is a central concern of Victorian intellectual prose." This statement, occurring early in Mr. Sussman's thoughtful and ably written study (pp. 7-8), strikes one as a commonplace, which indeed it is; but the remarkable thing about it is that until now no one has sought to explore its implications on a fairly broad scale. The topic is barely mentioned in, for example, Houghton's The Victorian Frame of Mind or Buckley's The Victorian Temper, the indexes to which do not even contain the words "machine" and "mechanism." Victorians and the Machine studies the "various, often ambivalent atti tudes toward the machine" revealed in the writings of seven authors? Carlyle, Dickens, Ruskin, Morris, Butler, Wells, and Kipling?and concludes that "whatever consistency may be found in the Victorian literary response lies not so much in a dislike of technology as in a more general opposition to mechanistic modes of thought" (p. 8). "In the machine . . . the Victorian literary imagination saw incarnated the power of the scientific intellect, and the finest writing on the machine centers upon the alliance of this abstracting intellect with the immense physical and social power of technology itself. The opposition to mechanized production, the celebration of hand labor, the aesthetic distaste for the machine are but expressions of the deeper conflict between rationalism and intuitionism, between scientific and organic modes of thought that is the true subject of Victorian writing on the machine" (p. 233). As these quotations suggest, Mr. Sussman's emphasis is upon the role of the machine and mechanism in Victorian intellectual history: that is, upon James Watt's ever-multiplying iron progeny as tropes for metaphysical con cepts and attitudes rather than as objects in themselves. Only in his chapter on Kipling and in his brief conclusion does his attention move from the ma chine as a capacious philosophical symbol to the machine as an aesthetic object and to the development of "a language that would express the new occupations and new perceptions of the machine age" (p. 209). He thus under states the extent to which the Victorians, long in advance of Kipling, seized upon the physical presence of machines in the contemporary setting as a fresh source of artistic, as distinct from conceptual or argumentative, termi nology. In his chapter on Dickens, for instance, he says nothing of the elab orately developed characterization of Pancks, in Little Dorrit, as a snorting, grimy, fussily backing and filling steam tugboat. And although he repeatedly mentions the "technological sublime" as a new genus of Victorian prose style, he does not explore the promising subject of the mode's aesthetic. This is but one of the inviting avenues of further examination and analy sis which the present book, like all good pioneer explorations of a wide field, suggests. Connected with it is another problem of language evoked by the age of machinery. Although the fringes of the topic, such as are implied in Dickens' plea for "a little standing-room for Queen Mab's chariot among the Steam</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 193 Engines," have been touched upon by various writers, we are still without a major systematic study of what might be called the countervocabulary of fancy in its several machine-related uses. Mr. Sussman shows that, just as the Victorians invoked the imagery of the Inferno and Milton's Pandemonium to express their hatred and fear of the machine, so too they fell back upon famil iar terms of comparison to articulate their sheer wonder at the new marvels of technology?the Arabian Nights, Faust, vitalism, anthropomorphism, extrav agant animism as in the celebrated example of the melancholy elephant in Hard Times. The encroachment of machinery and engineering into every as pect of ordinary Victorian life was accompanied by a sustained efflorescence of pastoral and fairy-tale descriptive language typified most memorably, per haps, by the name "Crystal Palace." The precise nature and significance of this linguistic response to new objects of experience, a literary language that sought to surround the physical ugliness and noise of the new technology with an aura of romantic fantasy, have not yet been adequately described or mea sured, though Jeremy Warburg made a beginning in his article in the Modem Language Review a decade ago. A wealth of material illustrating the reply of fancy to anti-imaginative mechanism in all its forms awaits the researcher: see, for example, the overextended causerie "Poetry on the Railway" (House hold Words, 2 June 1855), which celebrates the picturesque aspects of railway equipment and operation, even to finding wrecks a fertile subject for verse making. On the surface, such exercises in glamorizing the engines which were drastically altering the texture of Victorian everyday experience strike one as being assiduous attempts at mass-delusion: escapism on a gigantic scale. But can escapism always be distinguished from tacit acceptance? The uncertainty of the Victorians' reaction to the machine was vividly manifested in the essen tial ambiguity which marked their adoption of conspicuously nonmechanical language in mechanistic contexts. By organizing his study around the great Victorian authors' individual responses to the machine, Mr. Sussman enabled himself to concentrate upon what is undoubtedly the essence of his large subject. Among them, his seven writers express most of the really important and influential opinions of the age in respect to mechanism. (And his discussion reveals how useful a touch stone those opinions are to each writer's thought in general. It is almost axiomatic: Determine what part the machine plays in the writings of a given Victorian, and there you have a dependable key to his mind, inconsistencies and all.) But there is still room for a study of the "philosophy of the machine" as expressed in the age's nonbelletristic writings?in books like Andrew Ure's The Philosophy of Manufactures and the many discussions of the machine's significance to society that appeared in serious periodicals. Moving down to the realm of popular culture, we need a consideration of the way the machine was treated in such cheap publications as Chambers's Edinburgh Journal and All the Year Round. A comparison of the attitudes found among the sages and law-givers of the epoch with those designed for mass adoption would be most illuminating. Very probably it would give further support to Mr. Sussman's emphasis upon ambivalence. Mr. Sussman asserts (pp. 9-10) that "of the machines themselves only the most fantastic or grotesque creations, such as the steam hammer or the</page><page sequence="3">194 Flanagan stationary engine, caught the literary imagination." The narrowly literary imagination, perhaps, but not the imagination of Victorian writers at large; for one important use of the machine symbol, present to the point of monotony in the assessments and celebrations of early Victorian progress, was that of the steam printing press. This perfect token of the fruitful harnessing of tech nology to the age's cultural aspirations?the printed word, endlessly dupli cated, viewed as a broad and inexpensive high road to the social millennium, the agent of a beneficent and bloodless cultural revolution?was exempt from most of the strictures directed against the machine by Mr. Sussman's seven authors. As a familiar embodiment of Victorian optimism the symbol of the steam press would reward close examination. Indeed, even the old hand press was the object of sentimental veneration. Caxton was, as much as Watt and Arkwright, an early Victorian culture hero: witness, as one of innumerable instances, Maclise's illustration for Bulwer-Lytton's The Last of the Barons, showing him at work in Westminster. Stimulating as its coverage is within the limits its author adopted, Vic torians and the Machine is at least as valuable for its implicit suggestions of the many lines of inquiry which future students might follow. The impact of the machine upon the Victorian mind and sensibility is a subject that is not readily exhausted. Richard D. Altick The Ohio State University</page></plain_text>
