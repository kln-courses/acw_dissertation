<plain_text><page sequence="1">INTERVENTIONS: SINHA RESPONDS 561 Response: Modernism in India: A Short History of a Blush Ajay Sinha Partha Mitter's argument against the universalized canon of Western modernism reminds me of another Indian named Sir Sayed Ahmed Khan, who similarly railed against British imperialism in the nineteenth century. A British-educated judge in the northwest province of India and an outspoken educator, Ahmed Khan became a strong critic of British administration in India and, by 1885, a forceful voice in the nationalistic struggle against British colonial rule. Through out his career, Ahmed Khan remained invested in the over arching good of British cultural and educational institutions, and he used his education to discover and promote shared, humanistic principles through such research projects as a comparison between the Quran and the Bible. In other words, Ahmed Khan is one of the earliest examples of what Mitter has called a "cosmopolitan" Indian, one who initiates cross-cultural conversations as a way of "decentering" the coercive power of Western universalism. I want to begin my response to Mitter's provocative essay on modernism by draw ing attention to a transformative event Ahmed Khan re corded in 1869 during a trip to England, where he was to research and critique British histories of Islam. The event will serve as a guiding motif for my reflections. In a letter he wrote from England to a fellow citizen in India, Ahmed Khan recounts a visit with his two sons to the India Office Library. In this august institution where English men trained for civil service in India, Ahmed Khan's son Mahmud leafed through "a book in which the races of all India are depicted both in pictures and letterpress," when an Englishmen interrupted and asked if he was a "Hindustani" (Indian). Ahmed Khan's account of his son's reaction to this interchange is significant: "Mahmud replied in the affirma tive, but blushed as he did so, and hastened to explain that he was not one of the aborigines, but that his ancestors were formerly of another country."1 John Falconer and Christopher Pinney identify the book Mahmud was browsing through as one of an eight-volume photographic record of Indian tribes and castes called The People of India, published between 1868 and 1875. Falconer reviews the long and checkered career of this first and major document of British ethnographic photography, which was launched in the aftermath of the Indian Mutiny of 1857.2 Pinney analyzes in this photographic project a process of signification that turned individuals and couples into ethnic and racial categories arranged according to the levels of threat they posed to the British in the years immediately following the infamous insurrection.3 Pinney and Falconer differ in their interpretation of Mah mud's response to the Englishman's question. For Pinney, Mahmud's blush expresses "insult and resentment he felt at finding himself the object of such objectifying primitivist discourse."4 Falconer disagrees. The overall tone of the letter suggests to him that Ahmed Khan is "almost embarrassingly fulsome in his praise of English culture . . . holding it up as a model to which India must aspire." In his son's blush, Fal coner hears a response not to the insult of the photographs but to the "damning truth" they represent: "the lack of edu cational and social progress which, he felt, justly relegated his country to an inferior status and shamed his son into disown ing it."5 The Pinney-Falconer debate indicates that Mah mud's blush is open to interpretation. In drawing his own lesson from the embarrassing encounter, Ahmed Khan sum mons the recipient of his letter to "Reflect, therefore, that until Hindustanis remove this blot they shall never be held in honour by any civilized race."6 Mahmud's blush permeates the history of modern India and shapes not only the consciousness of the class of British educated Indians Ahmed Khan embodies, namely, the urban middle class, but also contemporary interpretations of that consciousness. I would like to explore the shape and struc ture of this originary blush, especially since it contains a bundle of impulses that becomes visible in various strands of modernist cultural practices, one of which is Mitter's essay. Ahmed Khan pinpoints three interrelated aspects to his son's response. First, Mahmud acknowledges being spotted (in the sense of both seen and marked) as Indian, accepting the visual signage of ethnic nationality available readily to a passing Englishman in the nineteenth-century idiom of "race." The ethnic marking may not have been problematic in itself in the nineteenth century (as it is today), at least for a visitor to the library who believes that the Enlightenment institution is available to everyone.7 The second aspect of Mahmud's response, however, is a disturbing realization that, perhaps unbeknownst to him, his curiosity over the People of India volume (a healthy Enlightenment attitude to assume in the library) might produce, at least in the eyes of the English man, a (photographic) doubling between him and the tribes cataloged. In other words, quite contrary to the self-aware ness of an Englishman, Mahmud's browsing of the volume may have seemed to him like looking into a magic mirror that renders him invisible.8 It is this shocking double take that prompts Mahmud to the third aspect of his blush, namely, a hasty explanation that expediently disengages him from the "aborigines" shown in the volume and produces an ancestry in "another country." In the letter, the "country" of Mahmud's ancestry remains unnamed. For now, it can be read as an expressive aspect of Mahmud's bruised desire to shake loose the universalizing and colonizing impulses of humanist knowledge, to which his father is otherwise deeply committed. Betraying an invest ment in universalism, though, "another country" seems also to be a placeholder for "civilization," a word Ahmed Khan invokes throughout the letter. His big wish is: "If Hindustanis can only attain to civilization, it [India] will probably, owing to its many excellent natural powers, become, if not superior,</page><page sequence="2">552 ART BULLETIN DECEMBER 2008 VOLUME XC NUMBER 4 at least the equal to England."9 Ahmed Khan invokes in this wish image of "civilization" what Pinney has called "else where."10 It is a fantasy of plenitude away from the colonial grid of visibility, where intellectual freedom offers the possi bility for Indians of cultivating their own self-awareness. While we can only second-guess what this place of intellectual fulfillment might look like, it is noteworthy that it is imagined through the colonial idea of nationality, in other words, an equation between geography, lineage, and the history of an ethnic group.11 In the bundle of impulses I have called Mahmud's blush, I see the early seeds of the self-critical, historicist modernism of scholars such as Partha Mitter. But if modernist impulses began for Indians at such sites of cultural encounter as the India Office Library, modernist cultural practices suggest several alternative endings to the originary moment. In my response to Miner's provocation, I want to hear out three articulations of that historical encounter, which I name vir tualism, feminization, and mimesis, exploring them, respec tively, in the work of the art historian Mitter himself, art critic Geeta Kapur, and artist Pushpamala N. The notion of alter native endings sets up, and keeps in play, a contest among the three examples, as will be revealed in their differing angles of light on Miner's premiere artist, Jamini Roy.12 Countermodern Virtualism As in Ahmed Khan, we see in Mitter a robust vision of modernism's potential for interconnecting humanity across the globe. Yet this vision is bruised by the imperialist tenden cies of the Western canon. Mitter reacts to being "spotted" as Indian against an "unmarked" Western modernism, leading us right away to the humanist's struggle between modern ism's promise of intellectual (and political) autonomy and its universalizing drive. In his attempt at "decentering" the co lonial and imperialistic meanings of modernism, Mitter em ploys and inverts the very terms of modernism itself. For him, "cosmopolitanism" is a major operative term that works against universalism. It is defined as a shared global aware ness of the agency of modern technologies such as the print media to create material connections between different parts of the world. As opposed to a vision of imperialism, Mitter imagines a fragmented world of somewhat autonomous global communities that define their own modernist prac tices through local interactions with the technological net work. In order to lend voice to this networked space of global modernism, Mitter introduces his key concept of the "virtual cosmopolis," one in which "asymmetrical power relations do not prevent the free flow and cross-fertilization of ideas" but rather enable "the periphery, whether formerly colonized or not, to contribute to the project of modernity on an intellec tual level." Mitter locates this exemplary "cosmopolis" in Calcutta, imagined as a city of Indian intellectuals. In Calcutta during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a Bengali intel ligentsia grew up as British-educated "interlocutors of colo nial culture," for whom the English language and culture opened up the Western world of Enlightenment knowledge and modes of thinking, "prompting one of the finest flower ings of a modern literary tradition." For Mitter, the poet laureate Rabindranath Tagore represents the best example of this Bengal renaissance. Mitter's Calcutta, where an ancestry in a literary renais sance takes shape against the colonial stigma, is strikingly similar to Mahmud's "another country." Mitter's "virtual cos mopolis" operates like Ahmed Khan's civilization, a place of "intellectual" plenitude, where a "dialogic relation" with the terms of imperialism and universal humanism brings about the possibility of cultural difference. Mitter's project is to elaborate on such dialogic terms within modernism, whose "ambiguities, instabilities, and fractures" open up a space for the colonized "to interrogate the capitalist/colonial world of modernity, enabling them to produce a counter modern discourse of resistance." His cultural politics turn on a dis cussion of "primitivism," which is arguably one such "coun termodern" term situated between modernism's imperialist tendencies and its cosmopolitan possibilities. For Mitter, the Calcutta artist Jamini Roy fully expresses primitivism's capacity to decenter modernism (Fig. 1). In the 1920s, the artist renounced his British academic training at Calcutta's Government School of Art and turned his interests to Bengal's folk and popular art, including narrative scrolls, terra-cotta relief panels in Bengali temples, and painted clay toys and cheap paintings sold outside the Kalighat temple in southern Calcutta. He also established a workshop of assis tants and family members for grinding minerals, preparing glue, filling in colors, and even making copies of paintings in his signature style of solid, black lines and simplified, read able shapes, enabling him to sell his works cheaply to a large clientele of urban, middle-class consumers. Mitter locates in Jamini Roy's workshop a radically different intention from Western primitivism, namely, "of making the signature mean ingless" and "thereby repudiating artistic individualism and the 'aura' of a work of art, the twin hallmarks of colonial art." In Roy's folk idiom, Mitter discovers what Ahmed Khan called India's "many excellent natural powers" that enable it to "become, if not superior, at least the equal to England." Roy's noble retirement from urban art serves "to restore through art the precolonial community that had been severed from national life during British rule." Primitivism thus becomes constitutive of modernist prac tices in India. It occupies a center stage in Indian modernism because it offers artists a claim to autonomy precisely through the countermodern turn expressed by Mitter. In a way differ ent from a Western artist, an Indian primitivist seeks affinity as well as ancestry in nearby, nonurban cultures instead of in the absolute alterity of remote cultures of the world. This is achieved variously, through the idiom of "folk" art, a direct, biographical link of the artist to rural India, or an affinity with ancient religious and mystical traditions. That primitivism facilitates a connection with, and restoration of, one's own past in India is demonstrated in standard accounts of Jamini Roy; his family came to Calcutta from rural Bengal, where, indeed, clay toys and scrolls were made. (In such accounts of rural, nonmodern artistic ancestry, it does not matter that Roy was not an artisan but belonged to a class of landowners.) Mitter develops this Indian logic of primitivism to explore in Roy both a signage of authenticity, of Indianness, as well as an intervention against Western modernism. As you will see, Kapur and Pushpamala work against this Indian conceit.</page><page sequence="3">INTERVENTIONS: SINHA RESPONDS 553 1 Jamini Roy, untitled, tempera on canvas, I6V2 X 41% in. Peabody Essex Museum, Salem, Mass., The Chester and Davida Herwitz Collection (artwork Succession Jamini Roy; photograph provided by the Peabody Essex Museum) Dissonant Feminization Art critic Geeta Kapur complicates Mitter's countermodern notion of artistic discontent in India. For Kapur, Jamini Roy's primitivist approach to an artisan's workshop demonstrates not merely his noble retirement but two competing inten tions. "The first intention of the workshop was to replace the bourgeois notion of the artist's uniqueness with an artisan's modesty and the second, to make art available to the Bengali middle-class robbed of its sensibility by colonial culture."13 The second intention conflicts with the first. While Roy's first strategy confirms Mitter's idea of "making the signature meaningless," it is precisely his synthetic, signature style that legitimizes a middle-class sensibility. Today, among thou sands of workshop-assisted Jamini Roys circulating interna tionally, a connoisseurly search for the artist's hand continues in a community of collectors as well as of upwardly mobile, diasporic Indians.14 Kapur presents my second alternative ending to Mahmud's originary blush. Kapur is a major critic who has almost single handedly shaped the terms of Indian art criticism in the last four decades. In the 1980s, when her view of Jamini Roy appeared as a small entry in an exhibition catalog, Kapur was formulating some of her most polemical statements regard ing modernism in India. In an important exhibition catalog in 1981 on figurative paintings, titled Place for People, Kapur staked an ambitious claim for the political mission of a "vi sionary artist" in India. She described the project in the following quotation from Walter Benjamin: "As flowers turn towards the sun, by dint of a secret heliotropism, the past turns towards the sun which is rising in the sky of history. A historical materialist must be aware of this most inconspicu ous of transformations."15 Within this frame, a visionary artist is charged with visualizing modes of figuration that lead the historical experience of a community toward the possibility of self-awareness. The historical materialist's view of Jamini Roy differs sig nificantly from Mitter's idealistic perspective. As opposed to the retiring, countermodern primitivist, Kapur's Jamini Roy devises "an emblematic form for his subject matter recogniz ing this to be a major point of coincidence between the primitive tradition of image-making and the modern." Kapur bases her analysis of Roy's "emblematic form" on the idea of figuration she was developing in the 1980s. For a start, she argues that Roy opens up the "decorative principle" of a flat modernist painting to include indigenous materials, such as cow dung and lime coating on homespun cloth, board, or paper, and earth and mineral pigments. The material texture of these surfaces recalls whitewashed mud walls of village homes, painted cloth, and narrative scrolls. The subject mat ter also shifts. Instead of the city landscapes, cafes, and broth els familiar in the West, Roy paints Vaishnava religious themes, such as the divine love couple Radha and Krishna, and especially the "social eccentrics: the Santhal tribes, the Vaishnava saints, and the Bauls the mad minstrels of mixed Hindu-Muslim origin." Roy's affinity with the inhabitants of rural Bengal, as well as village and tribal arts, comes to rest in a new artistic idiom of bold, black lines and highly simplified figures with robust limbs, all set in "a tight ornamental fit" against brightly colored backgrounds. For Kapur, Roy's orig inality is precisely in his rephrasing of the modernist "deco rative principle" so as to make his indigenous, subaltern subjects "spring forth into a configuration and cohere as a motif."16 While Mitter interprets Jamini Roy's folk idiom literally, as a return to rural and tribal forms of art, Kapur points to Roy's primitivism as a visual and figurative conceit. The 1980s were in many ways a decade of fruition for Kapur's materialist vision, to which her idea of figuration is foundational. As the decade progressed, Kapur's work reflected major cultural shifts taking place within India, expressing a crisis in the secularist socialist ideology on which India was first imagined and institutionalized after independence, and in which the critic's idea of figuration remained invested. Her key essays of the period are collected in When Was Modernism,11 and in the</page><page sequence="4">564 ART BULLETIN DECEMBER 2008 VOLUME XC NUMBER 4 shifting preoccupations of this text I find an especially com pelling articulation of Mahmud 's originary blush. In 1987, Kapur developed her exploration of the figurative power of modernism's decorative principle in a detailed monographic study of the artist K. G. Subramanyan. Like Jamini Roy, Subramanyan assumes the role of an artisan in a large and diverse series of works, including murals in fresco buono, terra-cotta tiles, cement reliefs, wooden toys, woven rope sculptures, woodcut prints, stage sets, and, especially, reverse painting on glass or acrylic sheets. In contrast to Jamini Roy's "emblematic form," which essentially dissipates into pictorialism, Subramanyan brings to his work "a kind of cultural wit, abundantly nourished by the popular art forms of India but also by the modernist initiative to construct and then deconstruct the image in full play."18 If Jamini Roy is a picture maker, Subramanyan is a sorcerer with a linguistic "trick to abbreviate, upturn, reanimate the signs."19 While Subramanyan's figurative compositions, like Roy's, "retain a close ornamental fit in the overall structure," his calligraphic brushwork puns between inanimate and an imate forms. In a large series of reverse glass and acrylic paintings, Subramanyan created erotic fantasies employing humor in a way that recalls the Japanese prints of the Floating World (ukiyo-e). For Kapur, these "funny, flamboyant, mali cious, seductive" works make "the very act of looking a con firmation of pleasure, making pleasure come full circle as the very basis of art."20 But Kapur's framing of Subramanyan is not fixed in 1987. An epilogue added to the essay in her 2000 publication, titled "Mid-Century Ironies: K. G. Subramanyan," dramatically turns the sorcerer on himself, shifting attention to the artist's libidinous energy. Reading the artist's personal subjectivity into the subjects he paints, a new turn in her work, Kapur finds that Subramanyan's interest in the female figure be comes "a form of sexual discomfiture" for a male artist, who moves like a "chameleon . . . through the pictorial maze of his own increasingly cruel vision." What used to be Subra manyan's pictorial wit has taken on the cast of misogyny, whose "sardonic sniff was diffused by the carnival of painterly seductions." In the end, misogyny shades into ironic mas querades of a visionary artist tortured by his times, which Kapur explains in relation to contemporary political culture of the 1990s: The assault on the body in later imagery has ultimately to do with the worsening social situation in India: the politics of an ascendant rightwing based on religious and ethnic aggression, a conflictual state where public murder in the form of communal riots escalates all the time. Subraman yan has depicted this aggression directly and deflected its impact into fables, parables, myths.21 The dissonance in Kapur's tone is deliberate, and it is con sistently applied in the book through her selection, reediting, and annotations of essays. When Was Modernism intends to map out modernist practices in India as a "theorized space for cultural encounters."22 That space is gendered in the very first essay of the book, where Kapur makes a provocative claim for modernism with reference to a major early-twenti eth-century artist: "Positioned as Amrita Sher-Gil is, at the beginnings of Indian modernism, we must on her account reckon with an inadvertent 'feminization' of modern Indian art."25 The statement is historically untrue, since we also learn later that a nineteenth-century artist, Raja Ravi Varma (1848 1906), is "an early protagonist in the Indian artist's passage to the modern."24 Kapur, however, is not concerned with chro nology. Rather, her emphasis is on the plurality of "begin nings" for the story of modern art in India, and the ways in which they can all be understood as feminized. Kapur's notion of feminization does not simply imply a focus on women artists (although the book begins and ends with them). More than that, it gives voice to a shift in feminist criticism of the 1990s from essentialist claims of women's voices to contributing deessentializing interventions to the dominant cultural myths and historical discourses.25 One such myth is that of a visionary artist, whose productive, figurative powers Kapur had explored in the 1980s. In 2000, Kapur's epilogue to Subramanyan's work introduces within that earlier myth a theme of crisis, which is developed more fully in the following chapter of the book, titled "Represen tational Dilemmas of a Nineteenth-Century Painter: Raja Ravi Varma." From here on, Kapur deliberately crafts a "choppy" terrain for the book, daring also to throw herself into the fray so as to "maintain the doubts and even the ideological mis apprehensions that attend an argument and stress the autho rial voice."26 In her performative acknowledgment of her own "representational dilemmas," I suggest, Kapur turns Mah mud's originary plight into an elaborately self-reflexive criti cal method. Fragmentation marks not only the critic's voice but also the organizing logic of the book. Fragmentation is emphasized in the last section of the volume, titled "Frames of Reference." The essays included in this section, first written as talks for an international audience between 1989 and 1996, create a po lyphony of mutually undercutting positions on the location of modern Indian art within global modernism. In the first essay of this series, "Detours from the Contemporary" (1989), Kapur is closest to her materialist interests of the 1980s. Here modernism offers Indian artists a way of imagining India's national culture as revolutionary culture. While its "univer sality" may seem Eurocentric and imperialist, "as modernism evolves in conjunction with a national or, on the other hand, revolutionary culture, it becomes reflexive. Through it one is able to mark historical disjunctures in western art, to expose its ideologies and thus to encourage national vanguard initi atives."27 This position approaches that of Mitter. By contrast, the book's last chapter, "Dismantled Norms: Apropos an Indian/Asian Avantgarde," makes of the national-modern culture an untenable paradigm, partly because it reveals its own ambitions to universality (fully indicated in the 1990s by the fascist temper of political culture in India), and partly because the visionary artist's gesture in forging "a certain equation of history, sovereignty and subject" has come to appear disturbingly masculinist.28 As opposed to national-modern culture's totalizing repre sentations of the Indian subject, "Dismantled Norms" ex plores two "transgressive" moves in the vanguard art of the 1990s. In one, artists break apart the "equation of history, sovereignty and subject," drawing attention to the marginalia of the national heroic myth. In the second, artists perform a doubling of modernist conventions, turning them into con</page><page sequence="5">INTERVENTIONS: SINHA RESPONDS 555 sumable, and therefore alterable, signs through masquer ades. The center of attention here is a group of women artists who subject the female body and persona to persistent frag mentation and masquerade through paintings, photography, video, and installations. Their transgressions are motivated by the desire to signal marginalized subjects as a "historical motif implicated by cultural myths and institutions such as the national museums and archives. It is toward the discovery of this motif in other words, the blush of the subaltern at institutional sites that the historical materialist sharpens her "feminization." Whereas Mahmud's marginalization in the India Office Library leads him to excitement and confusion, and Mitter to a countermodern turn, Kapur organizes Mah mud's historical blush into a comprehensive, if fragmentary, "conceptual topography"29 of Indian modernism. Mimetic Encounter The contemporary artist Pushpamala N. embodies my third alternative ending to the originary moment of 1869. In par ticular, Pushpamala points to a weak spot in the two "trans gressive" modes Kapur proposes for discovering the historical subject in India, namely, that of a critical modernist and a masquerading postcolonialist. In "Dismantled Norms," Kapur analyzes Pushpamala's work as a masquerade, turning on the artist's consistent use of photography. Since the mid-1990s, Pushpamala has worked on photographic projects in which she enacts a wide range of subjects and visual genres taken from India's popular culture. In a series titled Phantom Lady or Kismet (1996-98), Pushpamala photographed herself in simulations of movie stills, impersonating a stunt queen of 1930s B movies, clad in mask, cape, and leather boots and engaged in escapades.30 According to Kapur, the photograph for Pushpamala is "the perfect artifact; it is a symbolic thing but it is also a simulacrum the copy of a copy, the original for which does not exist."31 In this simulacrum, Pushpamala inserts her body as "an empty enigma." The body is seemingly "empty" because it is thoroughly assimilated into the simula crum, yet it is an "enigma" because we continue to recognize it when Pushpamala appears over and over again in all her photographs. The play of absence and presence allows the artist to disengage herself from the simulacrum of an image, as if she were the photograph's prescient negative or, in Kapur's words, "a kind of pristine self, a demonstrably false innocence, whereby she can conduct, as if from ground zero, a retake on the arts of representation." The ghost of the sovereign artist to which Kapur adheres in her analysis of Pushpamala weakens the edge of the trans gressions she describes in the new vanguard art: after all, the transcendent figure of the artist, fully in charge of self-repre sentation, is only a modernist fantasy, not a historical motif with which to dismantle the modernist norm. How should we address the question of the historical motif in, say, Pushpa mala's Toda from her photographic series Native Women of South India: Manners and Customs (2000-2004, Fig. 2)? Kapur might consider Toda a masquerade of a "perfect arti fact" from the field of British colonial photography. Follow ing Kapur's lead, one could argue that the artist's "demon strably false innocence" can be located in the way the image deliberately mixes two incompatible genres of colonial pho tography, the ethnographic and the anthropometric. While ethnographic photography calls for the subject to wear ac cessories similar to Pushpamala's heavy cloak and greasy, curly hair, so that the ethnographer may study in them the signage of cultural difference, anthropometric photography requires a naked, and possibly bald, subject to stand against a grid so that the scientist may acquire measurable evidence of the subject tribe's social and psychological tendencies.32 Pushpamala's mixing of genres violates the reality effect of the photograph and presents a parody of colonial science. The photograph's representational spell is also broken by the two hands holding up the backdrop on either side (one lighter than the other!), further making visible and legible the artifice of colonial photography. And, finally, the reality of viewing Pushpamala's series not in the browsing room of the India Office Library in 1869 but in a gallery space today and the viewer's recognition of the same artist's body through the entire series help to disentangle the modernist's "demonstrably false innocence" from the original referent.33 But I resist reading Pushpamala's doubling of colonial photography as either a critique of the colonial text or a modernist gesture toward a "pristine self." In Toda, as in other projects, the artist conveys a fascination with images and image genres that have a readable presence in the visual culture of modern India. Their wide circulation as commer cially reproduced prints and their persistence in the bazaar through long periods of time suggest their cultural reso nance, which the artist wishes to capture through mimesis. Pushpamala's doubling in Toda, then, is a mode of attach ment, not detachment, expressing a desire to grab hold of the visual trace of a historical past through a detailed corpo real process. First, as in all images in the Native Women of South India series, the original photograph is found within the popular print culture of urban India.34 The artist comes in contact with it as a concrete fossil from an unknown past after it has journeyed through a vast, global network of mass reproduction and commercial circulation that is authorized by popular consumption, making the image a residue of histories beyond the artist's purview. Second, as in the case of other images, Pushpamala has approached Toda with an en chanted literalism, that is to say, an interest in closely match ing her project with the found image.35 In an elaborate production including collaboration with photographers and retired cinematographers, a search for costumes and closely matching backdrops, the employment of painters of commercial film studio sets, lighting engineers, or crafts people to re-create objects such as the measurement stand in Toda Pushpamala materially reconfigures the visual trace into an embodied referent.36 Finally, it is this reconfigured referent that is subject to the conditions of photography and given the indexicality and the reality effect of a photographic image. How do we understand this doubling of a found image into a final photograph? I believe that the desire here is to rein carnate mimetically what historian Tapati Guha-Thakurta has called "the compulsions of visual representation."37 Guha Thakurta explores the accretion and persistence of images of ancient architectural monuments in the popular culture of modern India. In cataloging the traces of monuments in tourist posters, postage stamps, and high school textbook</page><page sequence="6">566 ART BULLETIN DECEMBER 2008 VOLUME XC NUMBER 4 2 Pushpamala N. and Clare Arni, Toda, from Native Women of South India: Manners and Customs, 2000 2004, sepia-toned gelatin silver print, 24 X 20 in. (artwork Pushpamala N.; photograph provided by Pushpamala N.) illustrations, she discovers an intersection between the visual accumulation in the popular imagination and an anterior image archive that was institutionalized and authorized in the nineteenth century by the discourses of colonial archaeology and art history. Pushpamala's work is also engaged with a doubling of residual history and popular culture. The key difference is that while the historian longs to find a network of material connections between history and cultural memory and ends up mourning the inaccessibility of the colonial archives "as an irreparable 'national' loss,"38 Pushpamala, with her elaborately staged figuration, reanimates the com pelling presence of the found image and produces a photo graphic record from it.39 Partly sharing in Guha-Thakurta's politics of nostalgia, Pushpamala's Toda points to a third solution to Mahmud's plight in the India Office Library. If Mitter's solution to a colonial encounter is to recoil into primitivism, and Kapur's is to reveal and contest the colonial artifice, Pushpamala's is to revel in a shamanistic exchange with the image world of the popular bazaar in order to invoke and activate the material presence of the historical archives underlying it. How might Miner's countermodern artist appear within Pushpamala's angle of vision? I suggest that Pushpamala would see Jamini Roy's folk idiom as a visual schema not unlike the colonial grid, against which his village and tribal subjects are similarly made visible and normalized as authen tic members of premodern India.40 Instead of a noble return to the village folk, Roy's primitivism would appear under Pushpamala's gaze as a museum effect. Just as a museum generates visual signs of cultural heritage and history through collecting, classifying, and displaying loose archaeological objects,41 so the transformation of a wide range of premod ern imagery into the folk style of a modernist indicates a new kind of pictorial repositioning. Pushpamala, however, would be interested not in "dismantling" Roy's pictorial conceit, as is Kapur, but rather in rekindling the productive power of his primitivism through a mimetic exchange between represen tations and real bodies.</page><page sequence="7">INTERVENTIONS: SINHA RESPONDS 557 Performative Identification In reflecting on Miner's challenge to consider modernism in the "periphery," I hope I have demonstrated that modernism in India is centered in, and fascinated by, something I have called a historical "blush." The blush rises at key sites of modernity, such as the India Office Library in London (or a British art school in India), where an Indian subject becomes aware of its own phantasmagoric appearance. I have elabo rated three articulations of that originary moment, in which the desire to approach the historical subject necessarily turns a modernist practitioner into an ethnographer, who is strangely fascinated by its own mirror image and beholds it as the historical and cultural Other. The three modes I have called virtualism, feminization, and mimesis represent for me three self-reflexive ethnographies through which history be comes problematic, enchanted, and visible in India. For me, the real provocation of Mitter's essay is in his daring proposal that a mimetic identification with the ethno graphic subject is a viable strategy for visualizing and inter preting historical encounters in India. The strategy of iden tification and the emotions of longing and fascination that accompany it, as expressed by Kapur and Pushpamala goes against the grain of a well-considered position in the West of what Hal Foster calls "critical distance" in dealing with "the cultural politics of alterity" in ethnographic scholarship and art making.42 Foster is weary of identification. He sees in it an "impasse" at which both "the cultural politics of left and right seem stuck": To a great extent the left over-identifies with the other as victim, which locks it into a hierarchy of suffering whereby the wretched can do little wrong. To a much greater extent the right disidentifies from the other, which it blames as victim, and exploits this disidentification to build political solidarity through fantasmic fear and loath In response to Foster's weariness over "reductive over-identi fication" and "murderous disidentification of the other," Mit ter may well point out that the very distinction between the left and the right expressed here relegates the Third World to the "periphery" of a dichotomous debate relating only to the First and the Second Worlds, and that there may be other modes of addressing the politics of alterity in contemporary, globalized encounters. Mitter's key intervention, in this con text, is in his idea of a "virtual cosmopolis." In spite of the problems of sublimation I have pointed out, the idea suggests a thoroughly globalized and networked space of cultural interactions in the Third World, where Foster's identification and distancing blur into a single, performative mode we may call self-reflexive identification. Mitter redrafts the old cen ter-periphery debate into a new question of globalization and localization of cultural practices. This new paradigm could, of course, become another dichotomy 44 But at the risk of betraying my own blush, let me resist such a distancing move toward dichotomies and instead call for a history of global modernism that remains passionately committed to, and fascinated by, the alterity of the historical subject within the contested territory of globalized cultural practices.

Ahmed Khan continues: "the photographs show that the pictures of the different manners and customs were taken on the spot, and the sight of them shows how savage they are the equals of animals." 2.

In the nineteenth century, the ethnic mark may even have been a way of gaining social acceptance and privilege, as Ahmed Khan amply dem onstrates in his other interactions with Englishmen and -women de scribed in the letter. 8. David Lelyveld's annotation of Ahmed Khan's letter, which Pinney cites (Camera Indica, 44), may possibly have accentuated Mahmud's anxiety: "If he had looked further into the later volumes he would have seen portraits of named individuals, some of them acquaintances of his fa ther, Muslims accused of practicing 'Hindoo rites in secret,' an Aligarh District landholder described as having 'features [that] are peculiarly Mohomedan [which] exemplify in a strong manner the obstinacy, sen suality, ignorance, and bigotry of his class.'"

Ahmed Khan, in Graham, Life and Work, 189, admires his "Bengalee brethrens" as well as "Mohammedans of Egypt and Turkey" as groups benefiting from the civilizing power of British education. 12. The idea of alternative endings derives from the commercial feature film industry. In choosing to privilege a single narrative resolution (and relegating the alternatives to "Special Features" on a DVD), however, the industry erases from public view what must have been fierce editing-room battles between filmmakers, producers, and distrib utors. 13.

Pushpamala's series Native Women of South India: Manners and Cus toms was exhibited in Edge of Desire: Recent Art in India, curated by Chai tanya Sambrani under the auspices of the Asia Society, New York, and Art Gallery of Western Australia (2004-5), and was also shown at the Bose Pacia Gallery, New York, in 2006. 34. Pushpamala mentions that Toda is based on a nineteenth-century, an thropometric photograph of an Andaman Islander she found in a pub lication by the art historian Vidya Dehejia, India through the Lens: Photog raphy 1840-1911 (Washington, D.C.: Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, in association with Mapin Publishing, Ahmedabad, 2000). 35. In the series Native Women of South India is another image in which Pushpamala is again seen against the anthropometric grid, but there she dresses up as a trapeze artist that recalls the photographer Mary Ellen Mark's Circus series. See Mary Ellen Mark, Indian Circus (San Francisco: Chronicle Books, 1993). In that example, where the colonial anthropomorphic trope is literally applied to contemporary popular culture, the juxtaposition suggests parody, befitting the "transgressive" aspect of masquerade Kapur points out. For a distinction, however, be tween this kind of literalism and what I am calling enchanted literal ism, see below. 36. Pushpamala based Toda on a published anthropometric photograph that indeed shows the subject naked. In deciding to stay covered in her own project, she admits to her concerns for modesty as a middle-class woman in India (conversation with the author, 2007). While this func tional excuse may still lead a postcolonial critic to point to the conflict between the colonial subject and modern Indian citizenry, I wish to take the statement literally to mean that the artist would have liked to have stayed as close to the real thing as possible. In other words, the wish here is for approximation, not critical distance. 37.

Pushpamala recalls Gyan Prakash's discussion of the famous Chor Ba zaar ("thief s market") in the city of Mumbai, in which junk, memora bilia, antiques, photographs, records, and other kitsch are treated as the accumulating, material debris from a fascinating history of the city itself. See Prakash, "Mumbai's Heretic Heritage," Art News Magazine of India 10, no. 2 (2005): 72-75. It is instructive to compare Prakash's Mumbai, Pushpamala's Bangalore, and Guha-Thakurta's Calcutta all allegorized debris of colonial and national histories with Mitter's Cal cutta, a "virtual cosmopolis" of the Bengal renaissance. 40.
