Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007 Abstract The paper examines three themes from the recent philosophical literature on place: the status of places as "concrete universals"; the narratively mediated agency of places; and the various ways in which human identity proves to be relative to place. I argue that these themes throw into new relief a set of correlative issues in philosophical theology concerning, respectively, God's supra-individuality, God's status as a final cause, and the divine grounding of human identity. On this basis, the paper proposes that knowledge of place is analogous to, and partly constitutive of, knowledge of God. Keywords God Place Agency Identity Introduction A theologian reading the philosophical literature on place, and the relationship of a place to its parts, will often feel on familiar ground, since many analogous questions arise in discussions of God and God's relationship to the world.1 Three recurring themes in the recent literature on place are of particular significance in this context: the status of places as "concrete universals"; the narratively mediated agency of places; and the various ways in which human identity proves to be relative to place. I shall argue that these themes throw into new relief a set of correlative issues in philosophical theology concerning, respectively, God's supra-individuality, God's status as a final cause, and the divine grounding of human identity. In recent years philosophers of 1 By "world" in this paper, I shall understand the entirety of the created order, and not simply this planet, or simply the world of human experience. M.

Springer</page><page sequence="2">150 Int J Philos Relig (2007) 62:149-169 religion have been much interested in the fruitfulness of various analogies between religious belief and other kinds of belief?especially perceptual and scientific belief.2 In this paper, I hope to provide the groundwork for a further perspective of this kind? one which seeks to assimilate knowledge of God to knowledge of place. Divine supra-individuality It is a commonplace of philosophical theology that God's reality has a supra-individual character. Aquinas develops the point in these terms: God planned to create many distinct things, in order to share with them and reproduce in them his goodness. Because no one creature could do this, he pro duced many diverse creatures, so that what was lacking in one expression of his goodness could be made up by another; for the goodness which God has whole and together, creatures share in many different ways. And the whole universe shares and expresses that goodness better than any individual creature.3 On this account, the world considered as a whole offers our best image of God. And since God's goodness is "whole and together" (and God is "simple"), Aquinas's sug gestion is, more exactly, that it is the world considered as an integrated whole that best images God. Of course, many faith traditions have thought that certain individu als?saints, prophets and others?offer a particularly clear revelation of God, but even here, the association between the sum of things and God is typically preserved. As John Paul II remarks: "In the incarnation of the Son of God ... the Whole lies hidden in the part."4 And in a similar vein, Mircea Eliade comments that: "The great paradox common to all religions is that God in showing Himself to mankind is free to take any form whatsoever but that, by this very assertion of His freedom, He 'limits Himself and reduces Himself to a mere fragment of the whole which He represents."5 There is then a broadly based tradition which sees God as in some way especially connected to the world as a whole?and as most clearly revealed in the world as a whole, rather than in particular individuals or in some "fragment" of the whole. To this extent, then, there is a consensus on the idea that God's nature has a supra-individual character. Theologians agree of course that the divine supra-individuality is not to be compared with that of a mere conglomeration of things; equally, it should not be con fused with the supra-individuality of a mere abstraction?since God is a personal and historical agent. However, there is also disagreement over what positive construal to place on the idea of divine supra-individuality. Some commentators have argued, for example, that Aquinas's approach fails to give sufficient weight to the personhood of God.6 So here is a first fundamental problem in philosophical theology?the problem of how to conceive of the divine supra-individuality?which can be brought into new 2 For modern "classics" in this genre, see for example Alston (1991) and Swinburne (2004). 3 Aquinas (1989), 1.47.1. 4 John Paul (1998), Section 12. 5 Eliade(1985),p. 56. 6 See for example Hartshorne (1968), pp. 152-167.1 return to this proposal below. ? Springer</page><page sequence="3">Int J Philos Relig (2007) 62:149-169 151 focus, I am now going to argue, by reference to recent philosophical writing on place. Let us begin by looking at the sense in which places may be said to be supra-individual. The supra-individuality of places In so far as places comprise a set of spatio-temporal particulars, there is evidently a sense in which they have a supra-individual character. But places are not supra-indi vidual in the sense in which a mere collection of things is supra-individual?for to speak of a place, in normal usage, is to indicate that the various things which belong to it constitute a real unity. Edward Casey puts this point by noting that we can think of places as genuine universals?because the classification of things in regional terms, or more generally as belonging to a given place, is not normally a matter of arbi trary demarcation. And accordingly, he comments that place "is situated between the Charybdis of sheer singularity and the Scylla of contingent commonality"7?in other words, places have a supra-individual and yet unitary character, and they are therefore neither "sheerly singular" nor just arbitrary agglomerations of individuals. To think of places as unitary in this sense is not, of course, to suppose that their constituent parts all possess some precisely delimited property?as though all their parts were to have the same colour or shape, for example. Instead, we might suppose that a place such as Dartmoor (the English national park), to take just one example, has a unitary character in so far as there is a kind of "atmosphere" which pervades the moor?where this atmosphere is defined by the set of moods, reflections and dis positions that are evoked by, among other things, the moor's geology (notably, the strangely weathered granite slabs or tors which mark the high points of the moor); its history (evident in the wreckage of various prehistoric and medieval settlements which lie across the landscape); its significance in literature (one thinks most readily perhaps of the hound of Conan Doyle's tale); and the characteristic cloud and other atmo spheric effects of the region. More exactly, to appreciate the character of Dartmoor, it is necessary to have an integrative grasp of how its geology, weather conditions, history, and architecture, together with the prevailing colours and scents of the moor in different seasons, and so on, all knit together so as to constitute a unified sense of place. So these various elements of our appreciation are not simply to be "bolted on" to one another. Instead, our understanding of the moor's geology, climate, prevailing colours, and so on, will enter into our appreciation of (for example) its architecture, and vice versa?for this same architecture would, of course, strike us very differently in another spatial context. Our appreciation of the moor therefore forms a kind of alloy which is not simply reducible to our appreciation of its various parts considered in isolation from one another. The unity of character that is displayed in the life of a human being is in some ways analogous to the unity of atmosphere that we associate with places?since human beings also vary in appearance over time, act differently at different times, and so on, and yet through these various episodes we can still identify a common thread, which marks out a given person as having a particular character or identity. In fact, a person 7 Casey (1996), p. 32. ? Springer</page><page sequence="4">152 Int J Philos Relig (2007) 62:149-169 who has a close, first hand acquaintance with Dartmoor, for example, will often come to think of the moor as akin to a kind of conversation partner?in so far as the moor has a "personality" which endures over time, and draws out of us a set of moods, thoughts and inclinations that are characteristic of the place. It is for this reason of course that we often turn to literature, rather than simply geography or geology, for an appreciation of place. These various themes?the unity of places, and their openness to representation in personal, conversational and literary terms?are all prominent in recent philosophical writing on place. For example, Jeff Malpas comments that: Perhaps one could say of the places to which Proust attends, as Heaney says of the Lake District landscape that occupied Wordsworth, that they are ... both "humanized and humanizing." The "humanized," "personalized" character of place can be viewed as itself indicating, first the character of places as unitary structures possessed of a certain identity and particularity of their own ... and, second, the obtaining of a certain interdependence, rather than simply a one-way dependence, between place and person.8 So Malpas connects the openness of places to personification (their "humanized" char acter) to (i) their unity (which reflects the fact that places have their own "identity and particularity") and (ii) their capacity to engage us interactively or, as we might say, dialogically or conversationally. Edward Casey has argued similarly that places are distinguished from "sites" by virtue of their distinct identity and their capacity to act upon us in ways that we cannot entirely foresee: A place is more an event than a thing to be assimilated to known categories. As an event, it is unique, idiolocal. Its peculiarity calls not for assumption into the already known?that way lies site, which lends itself to predefined cate gories, uses, and interpretations?but for the imaginative constitution of terms respecting its idiolocality (these range from placenames to whole discourses).9 So Casey too combines these two themes: places have their own individual character (they are "idiolocal"); and this individuality is tied to their capacity to transcend our preconceptions (a capacity lacking in "sites"). Although Casey does not make the connection here, it is natural to add, with Malpas, that these qualities are reminiscent of persons. For persons too, above all when we encounter them concretely, do not con form simply to some general type?and it is partly for this reason, of course, that they are not to be considered as mere resources, or used according to some pre-assigned sense of their relevance for our projects. So in these ways we can give some content to the thought that places are both supra-individual and yet unitary. Let's return now to the main thread of our discus sion, and consider how these themes might help to illuminate the question of divine supra-individuality. 8 Malpas (1999), pp. 184-185. 9 Casey (1996) p. 26. ? Springer</page><page sequence="5">Int J Philos Relig (2007) 62:149-169 153 The relationship of God to the world and of a place to its parts Aquinas's account of divine supra-individuality flows, of course, from his concep tion of God as subsistent existence?God is best imaged by the world as a whole, rather than by individual things, because God is not a particular thing of this or that kind, but the unrestricted act of existence. I am going to argue now that Aquinas's doctrine of subsistent existence can be re-cast using the language of place, and that this approach will provide a more satisfactory route into a broadly Thomistic account of God's supra-individuality. I shall begin by examining the connections between the idea of God as subsistent existence and contemporary philosophical accounts of place. In some passages, Thomas appears to spell out the idea that God is subsistent exis tence by supposing that there is some quality or activity of existing that is manifest in all creatures, and displayed pre-eminently by God in so far as God is the source of creatures. For example, he writes that: Whenever different things share something in common, there must be some cause of this sharing; precisely as different, they themselves do not account for it. Thus it is that whenever some one element is found in different things, these receive it from one cause, just as different hot bodies get their heat from one fire. Existence, however, is shared by all things, however much they differ. There must therefore be a single source of existence from which whatever exists in any manner whatsoever, whether invisible and spiritual or visible and material, obtains its existence.10 Of course, many commentators have baulked at the idea that existence is a common "something" which is shared by various existent things and displayed in unrestricted form by God.11 However, it may be easier to make a similar sort of point when thinking about the relationship between a place and its parts. For instance, we might suppose that the component parts of a place such as Dartmoor do all possess a common qual ity?namely, the quality that is picked out when we think of the moor as having a "personality" or the sort of unity of character that we have been discussing. (For ease of reference, let's call this quality, rather inelegantly I'm afraid, "Dartmoorishness"). This quality is, clearly, a kind-transcending quality: Dartmoorishness is not reducible to the particular mode of being that belongs to trees, or rocks, or any of the other entities found on the moor, nor is it simply some aggregate of these other modes of being?instead, it is a kind-transcending mode of existence that belongs to the moor considered as a unity, and to individual things in so far as they participate in that unity. As well as postulating a kind-transcending quality or activity which is common to all creatures, Aquinas makes two further moves in the passage I have just cited (even if the second is not entirely explicit)?he supposes (i) that there must be a source of any such quality and (ii) that this source will possess this same quality pre-eminently 10 Aquinas (1967), 1.65.1 1 * Commenting on a similar passage in De Potentia 1 2C, Anthony Kenny remarks: "if the 'esse' which denotes God's essence is like the 'esse' which is predicable of everything, except that it does not permit the addition of further predicates, then it is a predicate which is totally unintelligible": Aquinas (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1980), p. 58. ? Springer</page><page sequence="6">154 Int J Philos Relig (2007) 62:149-169 or without restriction. Here too there is a parallel with the ontology of places. Let us allow that individual stretches of heath, and so on, on Dartmoor are all invested with the "spirit" or "personality" or "atmosphere" of the moor?in this sense, they possess a common, kind-transcending quality. However, individual chunks of the moor do not possess this quality of Dartmoorishness in their own right?after all, if they were somehow to be detached from the moor, then they would display the quality in at most a fragmentary form, and perhaps not at all. So individual stretches of the moor are Dartmoorish only by virtue of their relationship to the larger moor and, considered in themselves, they express the quality of Dartmoorishness in, at most, a partial or fragmentary form. In contrast to its parts, however, the moor as a whole possesses the property of Dartmoorishness in its own right, and unrestrictedly. So the relationship between a place and its parts appears to offer a counterpart to Aquinas's conception of the relationship between God and creatures: Aquinas sup poses that there is a common, kind-transcending quality or activity which is manifest in creatures derivatively and partially, and displayed pre-eminently by the source of that quality, namely God; and we might suppose correspondingly that there is a common, kind-transcending quality that belongs to the constituent parts of a place?a quality which those parts possess only partially and derivatively, and which is exemplified primordially and pre-eminently by the place considered as a unity. While these pro posals are structurally analogous, the formulation involving place has two advantages I suggest: first of all, it keeps clear of the thought, which many have found to be intol erably murky, that the common, kind-transcending quality or activity which extends to all the parts of a place (or of creation as a whole) is existence; and secondly, it does not need to invoke any contentious metaphysics (it needs no Platonic doctrine of participation, for example) to explain how the constituent parts of a place are able to exemplify this kind-transcending quality only by virtue of their relationship to a reality which displays the same quality pre-eminently and non-fragmentarily. If the relationship of a place to its parts maps onto the relationship between God and creatures, as conceived by Thomas, in these ways, and if the first kind of rela tionship can be articulated relatively straightforwardly, then we might well wonder whether we can use the language of place to characterise the relationship of God and the world. This proposal faces one obvious objection?surely the relationship of God to creatures involves a more basic ontological distinction than does the relationship of a place to its parts? As we have seen, there is a sense in which a place such as Dartmoor transcends its parts?for the moor is a genuine unity, and it possesses pre eminently and primordially certain qualities that its parts possess only fragmentarily and derivatively. Philosophical theologians of a broadly "non-realist" persuasion may suppose that this sort of transcendence provides a satisfactory equivalent for the kind of transcendence which God enjoys vis-?-vis the world. But theological tradition has surely been committed to a more radical distinction between God and world?by vir tue of the doctrine of creation ex nihilo. To take account of this point of disanalogy we need to elaborate on our proposal, and for this purpose I shall make use of the ancient idiom of the genius loci. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="7">Int J Philos Relig (2007) 62:149-169 155 Elaborating the model: God as the genius mundi On the traditional conception, the genius loci is a power which inhabits a place. The concept of a genius presents, I suggest, a more direct analogy to the concept of God than does the bare concept of a place, or the bare concept of the unity of a place ?since to speak of the genius of a place is to speak of a power which inhabits the place and gives it structure. Despite this difference between the concepts of a place and of a genius loci, the qualities of places which we have been exploring seem to be straightforwardly transferable to their genii. (For present purposes, I simply bracket the question of whether there are any genii of this localised variety?the proposal we are exploring is purely conceptual in nature, and so does not require any commitment one way or other on this question).12 This is because a kind-transcending quality such as Dartmoorishness, which is possessed primordially and pre-eminently by the rel evant place considered as a unity, will also be possessed in a unitary and still more primordial and pre-eminent form by the genius of the place, in so far as the genius communicates its "personality" to the place, and thereby accounts for the unity of "character" of the place. Indeed, we might plausibly see the language of the genius loci as one way of trying to explain or otherwise capture the distinctive ontology of places?their person-like unity-in-diversity?that we have been examining. So the parallel that we have postulated between the God-creature relationship and the rela tionship of a place to its parts will extend to the relationship between the genius of a place and the parts of the place. While the concept of a genius loci is closer to the concept of God than is the bare concept of a place, in so far as it implies the idea of a power which communicates its likeness to a place, it still falls short of the concept of God in so far as the genius is not taken to be, in normal usage, the source of the being of a place. However, there is I suggest no reason in principle why the idea of a genius should not be extended in this way when we consider the idea of a genius whose locus is the world.13 Of course, the genius of a localised place is not naturally conceived as the source of the being of the place?in so far as that place forms part of a larger network of places, upon which it is dependent in various ways. But if we are considering the idea of a genius mundi, then this consideration no longer stands as a bar to the idea that a genius may not only communicate its character to the relevant locus, but also serve as the source of that locus's being. We can turn now to the central proposal of this section of the paper. If we understand the notion of a genius as open to extension in this way, then we may think of God as standing in the relationship of genius loci to the world. And by making this conceptual move, we can then re-cast the content of Aquinas's doctrine of subsistent existence as 12 If one wanted to a adopt a "non-realist" reading of genius language as used of God, that would be possible in principle?but again in my judgement not true to the import of the language of the major monotheistic traditions. 13 In speaking of the genius of the world, we are concerned with the human or existential meaning of the world?rather than with its character from a purely quantitative point of view, for example. However, as I am using the expression, "the world" is still intended to pick out the sum of created things, and not simply the lifeworld?albeit that the genius of the sum of created things will not be identifiable except by reference to the lifeworld. ? Springer</page><page sequence="8">156 Int J Philos Relig (2007) 62:149-169 follows: (i) each creature possesses, fragmentarily and derivatively, a common, kind transcending quality?a quality which we can understand by analogy with the quality of Dartmoorishness; and (ii) this quality belongs primordially and pre-eminently to God understood as the genius mundi. As we have seen, Aquinas's conception of God as subsistent existence offers a way of articulating the idea that it is the world as a whole that best images God. And this implication of his doctrine is preserved in the idea of God as the genius mundi, for it is also the case that the genius of a place is best imaged by the place as a whole, rather than by its parts. Thus Dartmoorishness, for example, is manifest only fragmentarily in the parts of the moor, and is revealed most clearly in relation to the moor as a whole; and accordingly it is the moor as a whole which offers our best image of the genius of the moor. This is because genius language involves, we might say, a kind of hypos tatisation of qualities such as Dartmoorishness. (Here again, I bracket the question of the sense, if any, in which we should be realists about genius language when it is used of places such as Dartmoor). Again, there are two reasons for favouring the language of the genius mundi over the language of subsistent existence as a way of making this Thomistic kind of point about God's supra-individuality: first, it enables us to speak of a common, kind-transcend ing quality or activity, which extends to all creatures, without having to think of that common "something" as existence; and secondly, it provides a relatively easy route (a route independent of any Platonic metaphysics, for example) to the thought that crea tures display this common quality only partially and by virtue of their relationship to a source which displays the quality in unrestricted form. There is one further important advantage that is conferred by the language of the genius?for this language helps to keep in central focus the idea that the world's source is personal (consider again the idea that the "character" of a place is to be conceived in personal or "conversational" terms), whereas Aquinas's talk of God as subsistent existence is not so readily open, I suggest, to the idea that personal categories should be at the root of any deep-seated appreciation of God's reality. Since Aquinas's account has often been criticised for its "impersonality," this distinction may prove to be a significant point of difference. Objections to the genius loci model This account is open to various objections. Let me consider just two. First of all, it might be wondered whether the entirety of the created order (as distinct from particular places such as Dartmoor) exhibits the requisite unity of "atmosphere" or character. No doubt some human beings will find that, in their experience, the world does not display this sort of unity. However, religious world-views surely do tend to think of the world as fundamentally unitary, in so far as it has a unitary source, and they think of human lives as properly governed by a unitary, overarching purpose, which has to do with relationship to that source. It is for this reason that the faiths can speak of certain virtues or dispositions of mind (humility, gratitude, resignation, and hope, for example) as properly displayed in all situations. So we might suppose that from a religious point of view, all situations, or all regions of the world, are infused by a common meaning?and an exposition of the concept of God which attributes this ? Springer</page><page sequence="9">Int J Philos Relig (2007) 62:149-169 157 sort of unity of meaning to the world will be, to that extent, true to the import of the concept. Of course, different traditions will have different accounts of what this overarching meaning?what we might call "world-ishness" (generalising from the case of Dart moorishness)?amounts to. From a Christian perspective, to take just one example, world-ishness will be conceived as, broadly speaking, regenerative love. And this qual ity?to use the terms of this paper?will be displayed primordially and pre-eminently by the genius mundi, and will be revealed more clearly in the whole sweep of world history than in isolated episodes, albeit that individual episodes will also exhibit the quality, partially and derivatively, in so far as they partake in this larger narrative. Turning now to a second objection, it might be said that even if the language of the genius mundi proves to be structurally analogous to Aquinas's notion of subsis tent existence for the reasons we have been considering, it is unclear why this should matter religiously. Let me attempt a response to this objection. Aquinas's doctrine of subsistent existence is important not on its own account, I suggest, but because it offers a way of expounding the idea that God is not fundamentally an individual entity or mind existing alongside the world?and in turn therefore it helps to give content to the idea that God is best imaged not by individual mundane entities, but by the world considered as an integrated whole. It is this combination of ideas that is articulated, I suggest, in the quotations I gave earlier, from John Paul II and Mircea Eliade. And this same perspective is implied in the remark of Rowan Williams (to take another figure who can speak authoritatively for a central strand of Christian tradition) that talk of God "is structurally more like talking about some 'grid' for the understand ing of particular objects than talking about particular objects in themselves."14 The underlying rationale for this kind of approach (whether it is found in John Paul II or Rowan Williams or Mircea Eliade) is, I suggest, a determination to avoid idolatry, or any perspective that would imply that God is an entity among entities, or a reality which exercises a claim upon us which might intelligibly stand in competition with the claims exercised by creatures. It is in this context that the genius mundi proposal has some importance religiously. For by offering a place-based counterpart for Aquinas's conception of God as subsis tent existence, this proposal offers a way of explicating the idea that God is not funda mentally an individual entity without reliance upon Thomas's potentially contentious metaphysics of existence and participation. For example, we can recast Williams' thought that talk of God is more like talk of a "grid" than it is like talk of "particular objects" by supposing that talk of God is more like talking about the genius of a place than talking about the place's parts. And just as the genius of a place such as Dart moor will be manifest partially and derivatively in the parts of the place, and imaged most clearly by the moor as a whole, so God, as the world's genius, will be imaged in fragmentary form by individual creatures, and revealed most clearly by the world considered as an integrated whole. It is this conception of divine supra-individuality, I suggest, that Williams and Aquinas alike are trying to articulate. 14 Williams (1984), p. 15. In this remark, he is expounding a comment of Wittgenstein. ? Springer</page><page sequence="10">158 Int J Philos Relig (2007) 62:149-169 Even so, the genius mundi model might be of no great interest if there were an abun dance of equally fruitful vocabularies for making this sort of point about the distinction between the reality of God and that of individual entities, but this may be doubted. As we have seen, John Paul II uses the language of whole and part to expound this dis tinction?but this picture requires further definition if God's unity and transcendence are to be preserved; and as we have seen, the kind of development that is required can be set out by means of the genius loci concept (suitably extended). Moreover, thinking of God-language as akin to grid-language is religiously less suggestive than thinking of it as akin to genius language?in part because grids are not standardly conceived in personal terms, and in part because, once more, grid-language will need elaboration if it is to be consistent with a proper sense of divine transcendence. And the doctrine of God as "subsistent existence" poses its own difficulties, as we have seen. So the language of the genius loci offers a way of making sense of the possibility of a mode of existence that is at once supra-individual, unitary, and personal?and to judge from theological tradition as well as contemporary discussion, there are not many creaturely analogies that will serve for this purpose?to put the point no more strongly. Of course, some commentators have thought that the human mode of existence exemplifies these same qualities?since the person considered as a mind-body com posite is supra-individual and yet unitary and personal. And in that case, it might be asked, why should we not think of God as a person whose body is the world? This Hartshornean picture would allow for a kind of divine supra-individuality (in so far as the world as a whole is taken to be the body of God), while also allowing the person hood of God to be conceived by direct analogy with the personhood of human beings. However, on this approach, it is not at all clear that talk of God is best considered as analogous to talk of a "grid"?talk of God will rather be akin to talk of a particular consciousness, unfolding over time. And while the world as a whole may be the body of God on this view, this is still not to say that the world as a whole offers a good image of God, only that it is a part of God. By contrast, if we take the idea of a genius loci as our central analogy for the concept of God, then we will clearly signal that God's reality is not to be modelled on that of an individual entity (not even a complex, unitary entity such as a human being) but upon the kind of unity that we associate with places, whereby individual entities are bound together by participation in a common meaning. To summarise our discussion so far, if we follow authoritative Christian commen tators such as John Paul II and Rowan Williams, then we should side with a broadly Thomistic (rather than, say, Hartshornean) reading of God's supra-individuality. And we can expound this Thomistic kind of perspective, while keeping clear of Aquinas's potentially problematic metaphysics of existence and participation, by thinking of the world's relation to God as analogous to that of a place to its genius. I want to turn now to another stock theme in philosophical theology: the nature of divine agency. Here again, I am going to argue, the literature on place provides a set of categories which can be used to articulate, and bring into new focus, a number of traditional theological affirmations. ? Springer</page><page sequence="11">Int J Philos Relig (2007) 62:149-169 159 The narratively mediated agency of places Contemporary philosophers of place have been much interested in the connection between the storied identity of places and their capacity to shape human choice. For example, Katya Mandoki cites the history of Mexico City as an extended illustration of the relationships between place, story and human behaviour. I shall begin by retracing some of her thoughts.15 Aztec myth records that the city of Tenochtitl?n was founded at the site where an eagle had alighted on an opuntia cactus. Mandoki explores the symbolism of this event in some detail, but for our purposes what matters is that from the beginning the significance of the site is understood in storied terms?rather than simply in terms of its usefulness in providing fortification, or resources, or a commanding view. In 1521, some two centuries after its foundation, Tenochtitl?n was overrun by the conquistadors and rendered largely uninhabitable. Even so, after some deliberation, Cortes decided that the capital of New Spain should be built on this same site. In the 19 century the city was to become the capital of the new republic of Mexico, and it is now the most populous city in the world. Throughout this time, Mandoki notes, the square established by the Aztecs has retained its role as the city's symbolic centre: The main city square of Tenochtitl?n became the colonial Z?calo during the sixteenth century and is still not only the city's main plaza but also the country's main center. It was there, of course, where the great Metropolitan Cathedral was built, with its combination of gothic, baroque, and neoclassical styles in fashion for the three centuries it took to build it, where the Inquisition's hangings took place, where a Montgolfier was elevated, where the main civic and religious cer emonies were performed, where goods and services were offered and acquired, and where revolts were ignited ... The Z?calo is now a place of peregrination from all parts of the country to demonstrate against the president and express dissidence.16 Mandoki is surely right to suppose that it is the accumulation of storied meanings borne by this site, beginning with the city's founding myth, that have guided later patterns of settlement and activity. It seems clear for example that Cortes chose to build his new capital on this site because of its symbolic significance as the focus of Aztec rule. To this extent, we might suppose that the site enjoys a kind of ontological ultimacy?in so far as it has continued to exercise its "pull" over the centuries, while various faiths, languages and political structures have all come and gone. As Mandoki puts the point: "The character of political power has changed, the religion substituted, the language replaced, but the site remains immutable through time."17 In this sense 15 In particular, I shall draw on her essay "Sites of Symbolic Density: A Relativistic Approach to Experi enced Place," in Andrew Light and Jonathan Smith, eds, Philosophy and Geography III: Philosophies of Place (New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 1998), pp. 73-95. 16 Ibid., pp. 85-86. 17 Ibid., pp. 86-87. ? Springer</page><page sequence="12">160 Int J Philos Relig (2007) 62:149-169 we might agree with her judgement that "the place, as a sponge that has absorbed various layers of time and history, is ultimate."18 So on Mandoki's account, the storied location of a given behaviour can help to fix the sense that attaches to the behaviour?as when a city is built, or a protest made, at a certain site. In this way, she is suggesting, places can give meaning and impetus to human choices.19 I want to consider now how this account of the agency and ultimacy of places may be mapped onto accounts of the agency and ultimacy of God. The storied character of divine agency Of course, all religious traditions tell stories about the world?they think of the world as created and redeemed, or see it as a theatre for the activities of human beings who stand in varying relationships to God, and so on. Following Mandoki's discussion, we might suppose that in this way the world can acquire a certain "symbolic weight" or exercise a kind of "gravitational pull" upon the activities of human beings.20 Of course, this account requires some extension of Mandoki's picture: here the idea is not so much that one region of the world may be symbolically weightier than another, because of the stories that are associated with it, but that the world as a whole can acquire a certain story-mediated significance, and that the meanings which attach to human behaviours will be shaped accordingly. Some religiously grounded theories of ethics appeal explicitly to this sort of con nection between world-narrative and human choice. For instance, Michael Banner?to take just one contemporary example?has argued for what he calls a "dogmatic eth ics," that is, an ethic which takes as its starting point the Christian story of what God has done in creation, reconciliation and redemption. An ethic of this kind will treat the story of the world?before and after the Fall, together with a view of its eschatological future?as a framework for determining the meaning that attaches to various human choices in the present. Drawing on various biblical stories (and following the example of Augustine), Banner seeks to construct a sexual ethic on this basis, arguing for the following three claims in particular: sexual relationships cannot be intrinsically cor rupt (because sexual differentiation belongs to the pre-Fall order of things: so on this point the Manichees are wrong); neither can such relationships be entirely innocent in our current condition (because they partake in the subversion of rational self-con trol that is the consequence of the Fall: so on this point the Pelagians are wrong); and finally, abstention from such relationships counts as a genuinely Christian calling (because celibacy anticipates the non-particular mode of relationship to others that we will enjoy at the eschaton).21 So in this way, Banner grounds a Christian sexual ethic 18 Ibid., p. 87. 19 It seems that Mandoki's account of the storied significance of the material world has a fairly general application. For example, even the history of a brick (specifically, the fact that it was once in a warm kiln) can condition our appreciation of it as a building material. See Christopher Day's observations on the ways in which particular materials may contribute to the spirit of a building: Places of the soul: Architecture and environmental design as a healing art. Amsterdam: Architectural Press, (2004), p. 167. 20 See "Sites of Symbolic Density," p. 89. 21 Banner (1999), pp. 21-26. ? Springer</page><page sequence="13">Int J Philos Relig (2007) 62:149-169 161 not so much in specific biblical injunctions about various kinds of sexual activity, but rather in the larger sweep of the biblical narrative, which helps to establish the char acter of the world (as fallen and redeemed), and thereby fixes the meaning of human choices, in sexual matters as more generally. There is an analogy, I suggest, between this account of the foundations of Christian ethics and Mandoki's reflections on the story-mediated power of place. On Mand oki's theory, those who hear the stories of Tenochtitl?n Square thereby find that their activities are "pulled" in certain directions?since these stories help to define the sig nificance of various prospective behaviours; and similarly, the stories of the world told in the Christian and other faiths help to fix its character, and thereby constitute certain patterns of life as fitting, while others are shown to be incongruous with their storied context. Of course, some appropriations of the story-based meaning of a place will be corrupt (we might think of Cortes's conduct in these terms, for example)?but even here, a person's conduct will be shaped by the history of the place, in so far at that history is taken to condition the sense that attaches to various behaviours. If we grant this parallel between Mandoki's treatment of the story-mediated agency of place and the account of Banner and others of the basis of Christian ethics, then we can identify a further respect in which it is fruitful to think of the world as a "place" and of God as its genius. We have already seen that thinking in these terms leads to a religiously suggestive account of God's supra-individuality?and now we have found that such an approach also sits very comfortably with at least some accounts of the structure of Christian ethics. Thinking of the world as a "place" with a story constituted significance also helps to underwrite a number of other familiar theological themes. In general, to specify the "character" or meaning which attaches to a place is to identify the genius ofthat place. (If Dartmoor is forbidding, for example, then the same must be true of its genius, since the genius of a place communicates its likeness to the place). And in the same way, therefore, if the meaning of the world is given in the motif of regenerative love (to keep to this example), then the genius mundi will be regenerative love. In that case, we might suppose that the stories which help to define the world's identity have a divine or quasi-divine status?since these stories will also help to fix the identity of God as the world's genius. This implication of the genius mundi model is nicely consonant with the traditional Christian teaching that the Logos?who is the account or story of the world's meaning that God speaks?is fully God; and equally it fits with the idea that the Torah or the Koran are at least akin to God by virtue of being eternal. As we have seen, Mandoki maintains that places such as the site of Mexico City have a kind of ultimacy in human history. More exactly, we might suppose that it is the stories associated with a place that are ultimate?in so far as a place's enduring significance depends upon such stories. On the view we are exploring, we could see these ideas as having a metaphysical application too, in so far as the stories which frame the meaning of the world help to constitute the identity of the genius mundi. This storied account of divine agency is I think somewhat distinctive when set within the context of recent discussion of divine power in the philosophy of religion: on the view we are examining here, God acts not simply as an efficient cause, nor sim ply by "luring" individual agents by shaping their consciousness of certain, valuable possibilities that are before them in a given context of choice but, rather, by estab ? Springer</page><page sequence="14">162 Int J Philos Relig (2007) 62:149-169 lishing a narratively constituted normative order which gives structure and impetus to human choice. And if the goal of a human life is congruence with the narratively constituted identity of the world (in sexual and other matters, as Banner proposes), then such a life must also aim at congruence with the genius mundi, since the world's storied identity is expressed primordially and pre-eminently by the genius mundi. And in that case, we can speak of God not simply as an efficient but as a final cause, in so far as the telos of a human life is congruence with the "character" or "personality" of the genius mundi. So on this point too, concerning God's status as a final as well as an efficient cause, the genius mundi model offers a somewhat novel route into a traditional theological affirmation. This general approach hinges on the thought that places (and the world as a whole) depend for their identity upon the stories with which they are associated. But there is also a dependence relation which runs in the other direction?after all, it is hard to see how a discourse which made no reference to particular things in particular places could count as a story, and in this sense it is stories which depend on places. Of course, a story will also involve the dimension of time: it will deal not just with places, but with what unfolds there. However, it might be argued that place is the more fundamental category for story-telling, in so far as the recollection of the past is concretised in terms of place. As David Harvey puts the point: "if it true that time is ... memorialized not as flow, but as memories of experienced places and spaces, then history must indeed given way to poetry, time to space, as the fundamental material of social expression."22 In any case, there is clearly a sense in which story depends upon place, and accordingly, we should add to Mandoki's account the thought that this is a relationship of reciprocal dependence?the identity of places is given in stories (as Mandoki notes), but at the same time stories require places if they are to "take place." As Philip Sheldrake comments: "If place lends structure, context and vivid ness to narratives, it is stories, whether fictional or biographical, which give shape to place."23 We might suppose that this further dependence relation (of stories upon places) helps to explain the connection which interests Mandoki. This is perhaps especially clear in the case of sacred sites. We might think that Jerusalem, for example, has a special significance, or symbolic weight, for Jews, Christians and Muslims because of what has happened there (this is Mandoki's point); but in turn, the city has acquired this symbolic weight because these stories genuinely depend upon it?hence the city is caught up into the divine initiative, rather than just being accidentally associated with it.24 Similarly, we might suppose that the world as a whole is able to acquire a certain symbolic weight in so far as it is a medium for the realisation of a divinely authored, or at any rate divinely authorised, story. 22 Harvey (1989), p. 218.1 am grateful to David Horrell for drawing my attention to this passage. 23 Sheldrake (2001), p. 17. 24 For a related perspective, see John Inge's "relational view" of place, where the significance of a site of pilgrimage, for example, is fixed by reference to what God has done there: A Christian theology of place. Aldershot: Ashgate (2003), Chapter 4. I address similar themes in my paper God, pilgrimage and acknowledgement of place. Religious Studies, 43, 2007, pp. 145-163. ? Springer</page><page sequence="15">Int J Philos Relig (2007) 62:149-169 163 To summarise our findings so far, by thinking of the relationship between the world and God as akin to the relationship between a place and its genius, we can bring into new focus, and into relationship with one another, two familiar strands of theolog ical reflection. First of all, we can help to explicate the idea that creatures possess, in a derivative and fragmentary form, a common, kind-transcending quality which is possessed primordially and pre-eminently by God?and in this way we can help to expound the religiously important idea that it is the world as a whole that best images God. And secondly, we can unfold the thought that God's agency is at least in part story-mediated, and God's identity at least in part story-constituted. The first of these themes offers a reformulation of certain Thomistic claims, while keeping clear of Thomas's arguably problematic metaphysics of existence; and the second provides a basis for the idea that God acts as a final cause, and in turn therefore a basis for the idea of a "dogmatic ethic." Place and human identity So far we have been concerned with the status of places as concrete universals whose identity is tied to the stories with which they are associated. I want to move now from a consideration of the storied identities of places to reflect upon the sense in which the identities of human beings are also storied and in turn therefore rooted in particular places. Again, I shall argue that various themes in contemporary philosophy of place turn out to have a larger, theological resonance. It is clear enough that a human being's self-concept is tied to the story that they tell of themselves?where this narrative specifies their relationships to "significant others," their formative experiences, and so on. And in turn, as we have seen, stories typically depend upon places. Moreover, this connection between story and place runs deep, in so far as places provide not simply the backdrop for the events recounted in a story, but the context against which those events can acquire a determinate sense?to put the point crudely, the act of swimming, for example, depends for its sense on whether I am at the local pool or being tossed by a large and potentially fatal wave. (We have already considered a specific case of this connection when discussing Mand oki's paper?she is concerned of course with the ways in which the meaning which attaches to an action can be relative to the storied identity of a place). So here is an initial reason for supposing that our sense of ourselves is place-relative. In brief, to tell my story, I have to recall various episodes from my past; and this recollection of my past doings and experiences will be, in the normal case, place-relative: it will involve envisaging various activities and experiences in their spatial context?for only so can I bring out the sense of those activities. And this suggests that certain places?for example, the places where I grew up or had certain formative experiences?will be important for my sense of self, because specifying the content of my self-narrative will depend essentially upon reference to those places. Jeff Malpas traces some of these same connections, and seeks to provide a psychological basis for them, in these remarks: The importance of memory to self-identity, and the connection of memory with place, illuminates ... the way in which the experience of places and things from ? Springer</page><page sequence="16">164 Int J Philos Relig (2007) 62:149-169 the past is very often an occasion for intense self-reflection ... The way in which such memories and places often become more important to us as we age, and the strong feelings (whether of fondness or, sometimes, of revulsion) that are typically associated with the places of our growing up and of our early life, can be seen as indicative of the founding role of those places in our narratives about ourselves and the establishing of our sense of self-identity.25 So following Malpas, we should say that there is a dependence relation running between: a person's sense of identity?their self-narrative?their memory of vari ous episodes from their past ?and (here expanding a little upon Malpas's scheme) the places which help to fix the meaning of those episodes. And Malpas is surely right to suppose that our emotional responses to places bear out this connection between place and identity. It is worth adding that the notion of "identity" which is in play here is, clearly, rather more broadly defined than the notion which has occupied some analytic phi losophers in recent discussion. There is of course a sense in which I would still be me even if I had done none of the things that actually constitute my life story.26 Even so, an existentially thicker sense of "identity" will be narratively structured, because our sense of self standardly depends upon what we have done?and it is this looser but still serviceable sense of identity that is the focus of Malpas's comments. Of course, there are further ways of understanding the connection between sense of self and place. As Christian Norberg-Schulz notes, a place can be the locus of a distinctive set of traditions and socially prescribed attitudes, which can stamp them selves upon a person's character, especially in their early, impressionable years. It is this connection that he has in mind when he remarks that: When a person wants to tell who he is, it is in fact usual to say: "I am a New Yorker," or "I am a Roman." This means something much more concrete than to say: "I am an architect," or perhaps "I am an optimist." We understand that human identity is to a high extent a function of places and things.27 We might think that place will also contribute to my story-mediated sense of self in so far as some of my memories are only retrievable on the basis of renewed, first-hand encounter with the place which was the scene of the remembered event. As Casey comments, these memories "belong as much to the place as to my brain or body." He explains: Think only of what it means to go back to a place you know, finding it full of memories and expectations, old things and new things, the familiar and the strange, and much else besides. What else is capable of this massively diversified holding action? Certainly not individual human subjects construed as sources of "projection" or "reproduction"?not even these subjects as they draw upon 25 J. E. Malpas, Place and experience, p. 182. 26 Compare Saul Kripke's treatment of proper names as "rigid designators" in Naming and Necessity (Oxford: Blackwell, 1980). 27 Norberg-Schulz (1984), p. 21. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="17">Int J Philos Relig (2007) 62:149-169 165 their bodily and perceptual powers. The power belongs to place itself, and it is a power of gathering.28 Here Casey, like Mandoki, is reflecting upon the agency of places. What his account adds to Mandoki's is the thought that places are not simply associated with various events (and expectations of events), and thereby endowed with a storied capacity to shape human conduct?they are also active in "holding" or "gathering" our memo ries of those events. This suggestion is perhaps most readily understood, as Casey notes, from the experience of re-visiting a place familiar from your youth, and find ing that memories come flooding back?memories that you could not have recalled independently of a further encounter with the place. (This provides of course further corroboration of Casey's observation that places cannot be assigned a pre-determined significance). So on this account, place enters into our sense of self not simply as the context which fixes the meaning of our past behaviours, or as the site of distinctive formative social influences, but as something like an organ of our own thinking: in some instances, even our memories, those thoughts which seem to belong to us most intimately in so far as they concern our own life story, are lodged as much in the place as in our "head."29 God, memory and human identity Let us consider now how some of these observations may be brought to bear upon the concerns of philosophical theology. Suppose we take in turn the points we have derived from Malpas (places help to constitute the meaning of the stories we tell about our selves), Norberg-Schulz (places are associated with distinctive formative influences), and Casey (places function as an organ of thought, in so far as they help us to recall our past). On Malpas's account, in the normal case, to tell my story I need to recall rele vant episodes in their placial context. And as we have seen, this connection between self-narrative and place holds in part because places help to determine the sense of what has been done. This point can be cast in the language of the genius loci: if I am to bring out the significance of my story, as distinct from just recounting a set of bodily movements, then I need to have some sense of the genii of the various sites that provide the scene for that story (here the notion of a genius can be taken in its contemporary, metaphysically "innocent" sense). This is because the narratively, and otherwise, constituted genius of a place will help to determine the meanings that can be borne by a particular bodily movement?the bodily movement of applying paint to a wall, for example, will have one significance when I am in my bedroom (which I am decorating) and another when I am at a school (which I am defacing). Moreover, as we have seen, the significance of the parts of a place such as Dartmoor is given in part by their relationship to the moor as a whole. And by extension, we might suppose that the significance of the moor itself will depend upon its setting Casey, "How to get from space to place," pp. 24-25. 29 This suggestion is reminiscent of "vehicle externalism" in the philosophy of mind. See Rowlands (2003), Chapter 9. ? Springer</page><page sequence="18">166 Int J Philos Relig (2007) 62:149-169 within some larger context. This connection whereby localised environments derive their meaning from more encompassing environments can be reiterated until we reach some ultimate environment?whose meaning will condition the meaning of all the relatively local environments that it subsumes. And if that is so, then any truthful ren dition of my self-narrative will have to allude not only to the genii loci of the particular, localised environments that are the setting for my life-story (since those genii help to determine the sense of what has been done), but also to the genius mundi, since this genius will help to fix the sense of these more localised genii loci. (Compare again the idea that the narratively constituted identity of the world fixes the significance of particular behaviours). So Malpas's account opens out, I suggest, from a consider ation of the relationship between personal identity and place to a consideration of the relationship between personal identity and God. And we might conclude then that the genius mundi model helps to corroborate this further theme familiar from theological tradition: the identity of a person is ultimately rooted in, is only fully specifiable by reference to, God. Turning to the second of our focal authors, on Norberg-Schulz's account, our places of origin help to define our orientation in the world, because of the ways of life with which they are associated?and in this sense, these places help to define our identities. Schulz infers from this proposal that true freedom consists not in place-lessness, but in rootedness in place. For place-lessness implies not so much a liberation from the restrictions of a particular way of life in a particular place but, rather, a severing of myself from the conditions which constitute my identity: It is characteristic for modern man that for a long time he gave the role as a wanderer pride of place. He wanted to be "free" and conquer the world. Today we start to realize that true freedom presupposes belonging, and that "dwelling" means belonging to a concrete place.30 It seems doubtful that true freedom requires, in general, continued residence in one place.31 But more plausibly, we might keep to the spirit of Schulz's proposal by sup posing that freedom requires at any rate some kind of continuity of self-narrative?if a person's life is root-less not simply in the sense that they have moved from place to place, but in the sense that such transitions of place have been accompanied by deep seated and ongoing dislocations in friendships, interests, and value commitments, then it may doubted whether that person's life could exhibit any kind of freedom that would be worth having. This is not to say that if a person's life commitments change radically over time, then the person cannot be free?just that in such a case there must be some coherent story to tell about how the later commitments emerge out of the earlier. So we might suppose that if I am to be truly free, then my life story should pres ent a broadly coherent narrative. Indeed, it seems that I should be able to grasp at least in general terms the respects in which my life story is coherent?otherwise I will be unable to set my present choices within the context that is provided by my life story hitherto, and unable therefore to see what sort of meaning is borne by my 30 Norberg-Schulz, Genius Loci, p. 22. 31 For a view precisely contrary to that of Norberg-Schulz, see Harries (1997), Chapter 11. &lt;? Springer</page><page sequence="19">Int J Philos Relig (2007) 62:149-169 167 present choices (and could any kind of freedom that was worth having attach to such choices)? We might suppose in turn therefore that my freedom will depend upon my capacity to rehearse at least some central episodes from my life to date. But at this point we can invoke again the thesis we have been exploring in relation to Malpas: namely, the idea that the capacity to tell one's own story depends upon a knowledge of the genius mundi. Granted that idea, we should conclude that my freedom, in so far as it depends upon a capacity to rehearse at least some of the respects in which my life story presents a coherent narrative, depends upon my knowledge of God. Again, this account meshes nicely with standard theological treatments of these questions, which suppose that authentic freedom is not a matter of criterionless choice but turns instead upon an understanding of God. For instance John Paul II comments on "the fundamental dependence of freedom upon truth, a dependence which has found its clearest and most authoritative expression in the words of Christ: 'You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free' (Jn 8.32)."32 On John Paul's account, it is knowledge of God's law in particular which constitutes a precondition of human free dom, rather than some sort of constraint upon it. Drawing on the conceptual resources of this paper, we might make the same sort of point by thinking of the genius mundi not as an agency that might somehow be set over against my freedom, or compete with it, but as the reference point which provides the crucial condition of possibility for my freedom (for the telling of a coherent and truthful narrative about myself). These reflections may well provoke a sceptical response: if my freedom is tied to my ability to tell a coherent narrative about myself, and if this implies an ability to see certain episodes from my past in the context provided by their correlative local ised genii loci, and in turn therefore from the perspective of the genius mundi, then is this not to say that I cannot realistically enjoy the kind of freedom that is in question here? In fact, here again, the implications of the genius mundi model echo theological tradition. For example, Saint Augustine famously affirms that it is through encounter with God that the narratological coherence of our lives is revealed and constituted: You are my eternal Father, but I am scattered in times whose order I do not under stand. The storms of incoherent events tear to pieces my thoughts, the inmost entrails of my soul, until that day when, purified and molten by the fire of your love, I flow together to merge into you.33 So here again we find that the genius mundi model brings into new focus a familiar theological claim?in this case the idea that restoring the coherence of our life-narra tives (and therefore making possible our liberty) depends upon knowledge of God and therefore, Augustine adds, upon encounter with God. On the genius mundi model we need not understand such an encounter in Augustine's Plotinian terms?on this model, what will matter fundamentally is simply that we should be granted some intimation of the storied significance of the world. Casey supposes, as we have seen, that the recollection of certain events may depend upon renewed first-hand encounter with the places wherein those events were set. This 32 From John Paul II (1993) Veritatis Splendor, reproduced in Gill (1995), p. 130. 33 Augustine (1991), XI, xxix, 39. ? Springer</page><page sequence="20">168 Int J Philos Relig (2007) 62:149-169 thought also points in the direction of an Augustinian kind of claim about the need for encounter with God if our life narratives are to be understood. For we might put Casey's point by saying that to know my life story I need renewed acquaintance not simply with relevant places, but with the genius of those places (as a condition of assigning a clear sense to what happened there). And in turn understanding those localised genii will depend, we might suppose, upon encounter with the genius mundi, which confers a determinate meaning upon them. So the writings of Malpas, Schulz and Casey suggest a further idea that is involved in the thought that the world's relationship to God is akin to that of a place to its genius ?namely, the idea that knowledge and experience of God is the foundation of our identity and our liberty. And here again the model coheres with theological tradition in the various respects we have discussed. On this account, God constitutes and reveals the significance of a person's past, and accordingly God is not simply an agent set over against us, but stands at the root of our sense of self, in rather the way that memory does?only the believer will add, of course, that God holds the significance of our past more securely. Concluding thoughts We have been considering some of the ways in which the categories of contemporary philosophy of place can help to bring into new focus a number of long-established affir mations in philosophical theology: God is both supra-individual and yet unitary and personal?and best imaged not by individual creatures, but by the world considered as an integrated whole; God acts as a final as well as an efficient cause; and knowledge of God (and encounter with God) is the ground of human identity and freedom. By thinking of the relationship of the world and God as akin to that of a place and its genius, we can see, furthermore, that these affirmations are not just discrete claims, but rooted in a single underlying account of God's reality. This approach also offers a way of endorsing a broadly Thomistic conception of God's supra-individuality, with out dependence upon his thought that existence is the common, kind-transcending "something" that is displayed by creatures fragmentarily and derivatively and by God pre-eminently and primordially. Finally, thinking of God as the genius mundi helps to foreground the idea that God is personal, while avoiding the anthropomorphism and attenuated sense of divine supra-individuality that is characteristic of (for example) Hartshornean accounts of the divine nature. I began this paper by noting that philosophers of religion have been much inter ested in the connections between religious belief and other kinds of belief. The account which we have been exploring is grounded in the analogy between God and place (or the genius of a place), and like these other approaches it is also issues in a somewhat distinctive conception of the epistemology of religious belief. This account suggests, first of all, that knowledge of God, as the genius mundi, is analogous to the kind of knowledge that we have of particular places, in so far as we grasp the genius of those places. Indeed, on the view we have been exploring, knowledge of God will have its roots in an integrative or synoptic appreciation of the identities of the places that con stitute the world. And if that is so, then knowledge of God will not be an achievement 4y Springer</page><page sequence="21">Int J Philos Relig (2007) 62:149-169 169 of the abstract discursive intellect alone, but will build upon the "conversational," sen suous and storied, and poetically mediated appreciation of relevant points of salience that is the mark of genuine knowledge of place.34 Acknowledgements I am very grateful to Peter Byrne and also to an anonymous referee for the Journal for very helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper.
