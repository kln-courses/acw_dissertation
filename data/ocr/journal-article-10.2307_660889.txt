<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SPIRIT THEORY IN EARLY MEDICINE' By JOHN LEE MADDOX, PH. D., Captain, U. S. A. QUICK to agree with Tennyson's hero that we "are heir of all the ages," we "announce with confidence" or "point with pride" that in the twentieth century civilization has reached an enviable peak. How far this is from being universally true is apparent when we observe the medical prac- tices of guillible and superstitious people, who in their search for a catholi- con have not yet learned with Sir Thomas Browne that death alone is the cure of all diseases. Yet we need not look to the tropics or to the antipodes to find proofs of man's eagerness to be deceived. Radios and twelve-cylinder racers are no guarantee against over-credulity; superstition may go clad in plus-fours or opera hats, in sables or glove silk. Neither Russia nor China is altogether unenlightened, according to modern standards-witness the alacrity with which Oriental and Muscovite have adopted, with dim percep- tion of consequences, Western garb, machinery, political methods-yet in those countries people are still occasionally beaten to death or buried alive at the instigation of local spirit doctors. In Harlem, in the heart of New York city, there are today, according to credible authority, more than a score of voodoo doctors, or negro shamans, reaping enormous yearly har- vests from the purses of their infatuated brethren. A writer in central Pennsylvania, lamenting the benighted condition of that region, observes that we consult "Powwow doctors"; we are "hexed" by those who have a grudge against us; we decorate our barns with odd designs to ward off the "evil eye"; we pass a baby three times around the leg of a table to cure the "liver groans!" And in a circular, distributed from Atlantic City, a Brooklyn "doctor" announces, for cash or credit, with prices ranging from $15 to $1000, "Spells of all kinds broken or released. Love apples in all forms. Black Cat's Ankle Dust, and all kinds of highly appreciated roots and herbs." All of which, not to multiply illustrations, may appear shocking and inexcusable to those of us who forget how slightly we are removed from the atavistic, how strong the primal ties between the aborigine and the elite. Yet it should not be difficult for us to trace back to the despised and ig- norant medicine-man a far-reaching indebtedness. From the practices of the sometimes barbarous, sometimes ridiculous shaman have derived various of our most scientific and effective methods of treating disease; to 1 A lecture delivered before the Anthropological Society of Washington. 503</page><page sequence="2">504 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 32, 1930 say nothing of numerous and not altogether shadowy resemblances be- tween religious ideas and civic institutions which heathen blindness and Christian progressiveness often possess in common. The when of the primitive doctor's evolution is not ascertainable, the why is reasonably obvious. One day, in the Philippine islands, I observed several Visayan natives engaged in smearing something over the doors and windows of a hut. In the air hung the familiar but unpleasant odor of garlic. Wondering, I asked what was the idea. A spokesman replied that a child had just been born in the house, which was being fumigated with gar- lic in order to keep out the asuangs-pernicious little spirits particularly fond of new-born children. When the malicious spirits smell the garlic, they take flight, for like some of us they cannot abide the pervasive and characteristic odor of the melting-pot. Asuangs are not, of course, the only spirits supposed to work mischief. According to primitive notions there are ghosts, demons, spirits everywhere. The very air is filled with them. If a man falls ill, spirits are responsible. If he loses his knife, hatchet, head-ax, or spear, a spirit took it away. If he accidentally trips over a stone, a spirit placed it in his path. Why, we ask, should primitive peoples live a world so filled with baleful creatures? It is not a pleasant world in which to live. The answer is simple: evil spirits, according to the crude notions of the savage, are directly respon- sible for the presence of bad luck, sickness, disease, and death. In his crude gropings after a philosophy to explain his woes, the primitive man, passing over indifference and agnosticism, settles upon a third alternative, faith: there must be something in which to believe, so he manufactures for himself an unseen foe responsible for the falling trees which maim his friends, for the beasts which devour them, and for the abysmal wickedness of human enemies. Dreams are the storehouses from which the primitive man draws his illusory spirits. In dreams he sees once more his imperious and implacable ancestors, and concludes, therefore, that they must be alive; even though, waking, he remembers that he himself had helped to dispose of their bodies. He dreams of dead enemies, and in the morning imagines that he is sur- rounded by their ghosts. During their earthly existence, these ancestors had maltreated him and these enemies had worked against him. Since death has made them invisible and carried them beyond his reach, he thinks their power has been increased, and naturally he ascribes his woes to their ghosts and spirits. Sickness, especially, he finds hard to explain. Who is responsible for it? An evil spirit, he concludes, has gained an entrance into his body and is tormenting it by way of compensation for earlier deeds.</page><page sequence="3">MADDOX] THE SPIRIT THEORY IN MEDICINE 505 Thus, the Finns believe that the souls of the dead feast on the hearts and entrails of the living. Spirits do not spare even a near relative, for these shades, being something like human, must eat and drink.2 The Zulu of Africa offer the sacrifice of an ox to the dead ancestor of whom a sick man dreams.3 Australian tribes believe sickness is caused by a ghost eating the liver of the victim.4 In Samoa illness and death are thought to be occasioned by the souls of the dead which have crept into the head and stomach of the living.' In cases of epilepsy, when the patient falls to the ground, foams at the mouth, his arms and legs torn by convulsions, the victim must be possessed by another spirit. Surely no man's own spirit would treat his body so. Similarly, spirit activity is the cause of all bad luck, sickness, and death. When a savage falls ill, it is not of hostile germs or bacteria that he thinks. He calls in a doctor who knows how to deal with the malicious spirit re- sponsible for his sickness and who, instead of administering ingredients to calm nerves and to kill germs, sets about soothing and banishing the pos- sessing spirit. The man who attends to the sick and demented is something more than a doctor. In the language of the North American Indians he is called the Medicine Man, or the Mystery Man--for "medicine" is used by the aborig- ines of this country to describe anything sacred, mysterious, or of won- derful power or efficacy. Hence, the medicine-man is not only doctor, but diviner, rain-maker, soothsayer, prophet, priest, and sometimes chief or king as well. He is, in short, the great man of his tribe. Sitting Bull, for example, the leader of the Custer massacre, was a medicine-man. The medicine-man answers to many names, for he is called among var- ious peoples, the shaman, the angakok, the voodoo-man, the obi-man, the conjuror, the magician, the wizard, and the sorcerer. But how does he rise to power? Sometimes he inherits the position from his father, but more often he has some unusual qualification that fits him especially for the post of mediator between the human and superhuman worlds. A typical case was that of Enchong, whom I met while serving with my regiment in the Philippine islands, and who was one of the most famous "spit-doctors" of that archipelago. He told me, when I asked him, of how he became a doctor: 2 J. Smirnov, Le Cannibalisme et les Sacrifices humaines chez les Anc'tres des Finnois orientaux.

S., 32, 1930 One day, as I was walking in the San Mateo mountains, I became very tired. I lay down at the foot of a tree to rest and refresh myself. Sleep overtook me. I saw a wonderful being in my dream. This being had long, white whiskers, and made mysterious motions with his hands, arms, and legs. And, then, he talked with me. And this is what he said: "Enchong, you are appointed chief doctor in these Islands. By virtue of this appointment you are empowered to heal all the sick that seek your aid. Spit upon them and you will receive their eternal gratitude." When I returned to my barrio [native village] I told everybody about my dream, and soon the sick from far and near were coming to my door. I healed them all by rubbing them with my saliva. Enchong, like quack doctors everywhere, was a great publicity seeker. His cures were notorious, and he was besieged by rich and poor alike for his miraculous saliva rubs. Civil authorities got word of his activities, however, declared him insane, and committed him to an asylum. And that was the end of Enchong. Other doctors' fame comes by different routes. A Pima Indian had only to recover from a rattlesnake bite upon the hand or near the heart, and he was elected chief wizard of the community'-rather a stiff entrance re- quirement, but then the position had its rewards. In Australia, again, a man was made a shaman as the reward of stupidly sitting upon the wrong end of the limb he was cutting from a tree, and climbing out unharmed when it fell to the ground.7 Spirits are responsible for the nomination and election of all medicine- men, and, naturally enough, insanity is an asset rather than a liability. The fact that an insane person is different from other people is proof positive that he has an indwelling spirit. Being, by virtue of his divinity, upon inti- mate terms with the gods, and possessing a knowledge of their nature and disposition, he is admirably equipped for devising ways and means of pro- curing celestial benefactions. The thoroughfare of shamanic honors, of being initiated into the mys- teries of the sacred calling and getting into the necessary inspired state is a hard road to travel. The medicine-man must often resort to sleeplessness, seclusion, and protracted brooding upon some morbid fancy in order to bring about hallucinations which prove his superior qualifications, both to himself and to his fellow-tribesmen. He is usually successful, for it is well known to medical science that the more frequently these diseased conditions of the mind are sought, the more readily they are found. The shaman tries 6 Frank Russell, Pima Indians. Bureau of Ethnology, Annual Report 26: 257. 7 R.

He then, without effort, possesses hallucinations in all the garb of reality. The horseplay initiation of college fraternities resembles somewhat the ordeal the shaman has to undergo when publicly inducted into office. Among the Dyak of Borneo the initiation ceremony is an elaborate process. The Menangs, or priests, lead the neophyte into a curtained apartment, while a medicine-man is posted on the outside to tell the awestruck specta- tors what is taking place within. The officiating priests, the publicity man outside announces, cut open the young man's head and take out his brains, for, says he, the candidate's mind must be clean and clear to enable him to penetrate the mysteries of evil spirits and the intricacies of disease. After having carefully washed the brains, the operating priest surgeons replace them. The priests then insert gold dust into the eyes of the candidate in order to give him keenness and strength of sight that he may see the soul wherever it may wander. The Menangs then plant barbed hooks upon the neophyte's finger-tips, so that he may seize the soul and hold it fast, and, finally, they pierce his heart with an arrow to make him tender-hearted. At last the new-fledged medicine-man emerges from the sanctuary looking fit and fine. We need hardly explain that all that was done to him behind the drawn curtains was a series of symbolic actions, representing the terrible things as they were described.8 Initiation among the Tschi-speaking peoples of the west coast of Africa is a more serious matter. The candidate there must undergo a purity test. A circle, three feet in diameter, is formed by glowing embers, and the neophyte is made to step within its clear space. Rum, kerosene oil, and other inflammable liquids are thrown upon the embers, so that the flames leap high in the air, sometimes higher than a man's head. After an interval this process is repeated a second and a third time, and the ordeal is over. If the candidate survives all three trials without sustaining injury, he is thought to be pure-the gods have protected their favorite from the fire. If, however, the intense heat compels him to leap outside the circle, or if he receives a burn or other injury, he is believed to be impure. Only those candidates, whom the gods especially love, come through the fire unscathed, and, as a matter of course, become highly honored medicine- men.9 Woman has her rights, too. Among the Karok of California, for instance, 8 H. Ling Roth, Natives of Sarawak and British North Borneo, 280-281 (quoting Arch- deacon Perham). Journal of Straits Asiatic Society, no. 19, 1887. 1 A. B. Ellis, Tshi-Speaking Peoples, 138-139.</page><page sequence="6">508 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 32, 1930 there are two classes of doctors: root doctors and barking doctors. The barking doctor is by far the more important person and is generally a woman. It is her office to diagnose sick cases. This she does by squatting upon her haunches, dog-fashion, and barking for hours. In addition to her diagnostic office, she doctors "poisoned" cases. This condition is very common among her people, for when sick they think they have fallen victims to witches who cause some noxious reptile or animal to grow through the skin into the viscera or intestines. When so attacked they apply to the barking doctor, who first locates the intruder and then sucks the "possessed" spot until the skin is broken and the blood flows. After having completed this part of the treatment, the shamaness takes an emetic and contrives to make it appear that she vomits up a frog or some other small animal which she pretends she sucked out of the patient."' In east central Africa the medicine woman combines with her func- tions of healing and prophecy the office of witch-detective, and in this capacity is the most terrible character in village life. It is to her, sup- posedly, that the gods, through visions and dreams, make known their will. When she sees the spirits face to face-always in the dead hours of night-she begins her operations by raving and screaming. She continues until the entire village is astir and she herself falls prostrate to the ground, where she remains in a state of catalepsy while the awe-struck villagers gather around, awaiting her revelations. At last she begins to speak, and her words are accepted as commands of the gods. Even should she com- mand human sacrifices she must be obeyed." The position of medicine woman is no petty or despised office. In Borneo, as a matter of fact, the very notion of a medicine woman is so full of mystery and power that male shamans deliberately assume the cos- tumes and habits of women, and are treated like women and do women's work. Such characters, known as manang bali, are most extraordinary persons, and in view of the enhanced prestige, which the idea of the feminine carries, go about their duties seemingly untroubled by the Nordic's mascu- line aversion to effeminacy.12 Medicine men and women are quick to appreciate the value of co- operation. They often work in associations, being banded together for their common interest. Among the Tschi-speaking peoples priests circulate bulletins of information conveying the intelligence of what persons are 10 S. Powers, The Tribes of California.

Ling Roth, op. cit., 270, quoting Brooke Low.</page><page sequence="7">MADDOX] THE SPIRIT THEORY IN MEDICINE 509 likely to seek advice, and upon what subject. A priest will sometimes frankly tell a client that his own god refuses to accord the assistance required, and pass him on to another shaman. The applicant, when he presents his cause to the second priest, learns to his amazement that the new doctor already knows the purpose of his visit.13 The medicine-man is a wise individual; he understands his people, and knows how to deal with them. Realizing that fear and intimidation are powerful expedients, he makes good use of these means of offense and defense. Such a weapon is the detective function, referred to in connection with medicine women. In time of adversity and disaster, the savage asks: "Who prevailed upon the spirits to despoil the crops or slay the cattle? Who caused the unclean spirit to enter the patient, and bring about his sickness and death?" For "proper" answers, these questions are always submitted to the servant of the gods-the medicine-man. Woe, then, unto those individuals who are persona non grata with the shaman! Upon them will he throw the responsibility of the misfortune, and the end of the recalcitrants will not be peace. Some of the ruder folk of Australia are unaware that death is ever owing to invisible causes. When, therefore, a man dies the belief prevails that it is only because some other person has killed him. The shaman is quick to turn this conviction to account. If murder actually has been committed, all is clear sailing, for in that case the medicine man is required merely to detect the criminal.14 If there has been no homicide, however, or if nobody knows who gave the fatal blow, the shaman is not at a loss, for immediately after death has taken place he unhesitatingly asserts that he received the name of the murderer in the dying confession, and bluffingly points out the direction in which the criminal lives. It may take several years to track down the insubordinate, but sooner or later the re- sourceful medicine-man settles the score."5 Among the Tschi-speaking peoples, priests are frequently employed to prevail upon the spirits to send death to persons who have offended or in- jured the applicants. The individuals against whom these priests work their evil magic sometimes die natural deaths, and in such coincidences the shamans take the credit, thus magnifying their office. In case the offender does not die from disease or accident, however, the priests, if they be 13 A. B. Ellis, op. cit., 128-129. 14 A. W.

Because of the sentiments thus inspired he controls the savage tribe and moulds the community after his own desire. It is plain, therefore, that an individual occupying an office so plenteous in possibility must, as already suggested, hold within his group a position of tremendous importance. The conviction of the shaman's supernatural origin, the effect of his adventitious aids, his superior mental and moral qualities in addition to the exhibition of truly wonderful powers, cause a feeling of awe which does not fail to assist in extending his spiritual sway over all classes. It is, accordingly, to the advantage of every tribal mem- ber to ingratiate himself with the medicine-man. If a person can so in- fluence the spirits that they will do his behest, it is obvious that everybody will strive to the utmost to make friends with him. Even if he has no mys- tical power, since by reason of his detective function he can throw the blame of evil fortune upon the insubordinate, every person in the society will show him respect, reverence, and even worship. The shaman is naturally keen in turning to advantage the unusual esteem and privilege which come to him by virtue of his office; and it is not surprising that he should use his power to elevate himself to the position of chief.17 The medicine- man in some cases exercises not only kingly power but pretends divinity;"8 he "goes from strength to strength." The shaman even invades the realms of the occult and takes unto himself the office of prophet. It is asserted that animals-pigs, dogs, grouse, sheep, and the like-are sentient to atmospheric changes. When slugs enter houses and cattle stand closely together, with their backs to the wind, a naturalist will conclude that a storm is at hand. As we go higher among the various forms of life, however, we find this atmospheric sensitivity becoming weaker and weaker, and when we arrive at civilization we discover that cultured man has, for the most part, lost the power to fore- cast through feelings and sensations. But even in civilization some in- 16 A. B. Ellis, op. cit., 142-145. 17 A. S. Thompson, The Story of New Zealand, Past and Present, 114; H. R.

Bastian, Der Mensch in der Geschichte, 468.</page><page sequence="9">MADDOX] THE SPIRIT THEORY IN MEDICINE 511 dividuals through rheumatic pains or sense of oppression can foretell the approaching storm. Many medicine-men possess this meteorological sense, and, by predicting the approach of storm and calm, fair weather and foul, come to be regarded as possessing supernatural power. Shamans do not confine their prophesying powers to the weather. They have a readiness at predicting other events with an accuracy which often seems uncanny. Some years ago, in northwestern California, a Kelta Indian murdered four persons, including Stockton, the Indian agent, and made good his escape. The murders created much excitement and specula- tion among the other Indians upon the reservation. A Kelta medicine- man, one day, suddenly cried out that he saw the fugitive at that moment with his spiritual eyes. He then proceeded to describe minutely the place where the criminal was concealed, told how long he had been there, and many other details. Subsequent events showed the spirit doctor to be substantially correct in everything he said.19 The ability to ward off bad luck and to bring good luck is the medicine- man's chief claim to distinction. The worst luck possible to a pastoral or agricultural people is a season of drought; the best luck imaginable an abundance of rain. When vegetation is dying, when there is no water to drink, when man and beast have no nourishment, the individual, who can make the heavens open and give forth rain, is a person of importance. Rain-making is one of the great methods by which the shaman seeks to establish his reputation. If his power stands the test here, he can rest assured of going through life with fame untarnished and place secure. Now no man by any flash of genius or by any measure of effort has ever succeeded in bringing about the proper atmospheric conditions necessary to produce rain. But whether or not the medicine-man is conscious of his impotence, he never allows his people to doubt his ability to open the heavens, and in view of their belief in sympathetic magic he sets to work as a rain magician. One of the principles of sympathetic magic is that any effect can be caused by imitation. Thus, in Brazil, it is the custom of the rain-maker to mount the roof of his house, vigorously rattle a dried gourd containing pebbles, in representation of thunder, and scatter water upon the ground, to prevail upon the gods to send rain.20 And whether rain falls sooner or later, the shaman need have no fear of losing caste; for when rain comes he takes the credit, and his people, since they are unable to appreciate negative evidence, allow one success to outweigh many failures. 19 S. Powers, op. cit., 91. 20 D. G. Brinton, The Myths of the New World, 184; Brinton, Religions of Primitive Peoples, 174.</page><page sequence="10">512 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 32, 1930 Sometimes, however, the medicine-man is placed in embarrassing situa- tions, from which he must use his wits to extricate himself. On one oc- casion, for example, an Australian rain-maker, after calling upon the spirits, planted his rain-stick in the ground. When it rained it poured, and the country was flooded. Later, the shaman, in the presence of his constituents, boasted of his success to a white man. The white man retorted, "If you made the rain, cause it now to cease raining, for the crops are being ruined." Whereupon the rain-maker naively explained that such a feat was impos- sible, because the floods had covered the rain-stick so that he could not find and remove it. The child-like natives accepted this explanation with- out question.21 It is evident, however, that this clever apologist is not always able to make his excuses tell. A plague, which killed many victims in a single day, once prevailed throughout Pima villages. Three medicine-men, who were suspected of having caused the disease, were put to death, "and no- body was sick any more."22 Among the Bari of the upper Nile, the rain- maker, who does not succeed in bringing rain when it is needed, loses not only his reputation but his head.23 During the British-Ashanti war of 1871-1874, a priest in the Ashanti camp was required to inform the public upon which day the English gun- boat, lying at anchor, would put out to sea. After making the proper con- juration he announced that the ship would depart upon the following day. The next day at sunrise, instead of the boat departing, two other enemy craft hove ominously upon the horizon. The priest was beheaded.24 On the other hand, particularly if the practitioner has been successful, he is well paid for his services. Here is a Sarawak doctor's price list: For getting back a human soul, six gallons of rice; for extracting an evil spirit, six gallons of rice; for securing the soul of the rice at harvest festivals, three cups of rice from each family in the neighborhood.25 The modern doctor's custom of making his fee proportional to the financial ability of the patient is, no doubt, the survival of a savage antece- dent. The native doctor of the Makhelchel (Clear Lake Pomo) of north- eastern California had a clever method of fixing his honorarium. He wrap- 21 W. E. Roth, Superstition, Magic, and Medicine.

He next drove a stake into the ground near the head of the sick man, and then bade family and friends of the invalid to stretch strings of shell beads (money) from the stake to ankles, knees, elbows, and wrists of the sufferer. When the medicine-man had "pow-wowed" sufficiently to make a well man sick, he pocketed the money.26 The Dakota often gave a horse in payment for medical services." In Korea the sums demanded by the shamans were at one time estimated to aggregate annually two and one-half million dollars.28 Sickness is so costly in Nias that persons often sell themselves into slavery to procure the funds necessary for medical aid."29 Is the shaman sincere about his "pow-wowing" or is he an unprincipled charlatan and unmitigated knave? Is he a conscious impostor and con- temptible quack or an honest man, doing his best according to the light given him? Candor leads to the assertion that this man is usually quite sincere and enters upon his profession in good faith. There are, of course, black sheep in every flock; but the majority of medicine-men honestly practice the principles of their art. In proof of this it is only necessary to observe that when a shaman becomes ill he calls in other shamans to treat him.30 Does anything positive, however, come from this hocus pocus treat- ment? Again the answer must be in the affirmative. Even though the efforts of the medicine men may seem well nigh imbecile, amazing results have been achieved by them. The shamans of the Similkameen (Okanagan) of British Columbia are credited with curing persons apparently in the last stages of consumption.3' In Liberia white people afflicted by certain kinds of tropical diseases have been cured by native doctors, after European medical men had confessed their inability to do anything for the patients.32 Concerning the success of a native healer of West Africa, it is related, We met a woman lately who had come from Freetown with, a dreadful disease in her face, and our doctors could do nothing for her; and so her husband brought her right up here in the interior to one of these "medicine men" to be cured "country 26 S.

S., 32, 1930 fashion," and she is getting better every day. Her suffering was intense, but now she has absolutely no pain, and is evidently on the high road to recovery.33 The way has now been cleared for an inquiry into the social significance of the shaman. Some writers assert that he is a parasite, that his influence has been altogether for bad, and that only after he has been routed from his entrenchments can civilization make any progress. It must be admitted that the medicine-man does no productive physical work, and that, there- fore, he may technically be called a parasite. Granting this, however, he produces indirectly, and, therefore, his efforts have not been in vain. He and his associates, supplied by other classes with bodily sustenance, constitute a leisure class. Without a leisure class it would seem impossible among savage as well as civilized peoples to attain any intellectual progress. For the leisure class the struggle for existence is eliminated, and these individuals of necessity have a surplus of mental energy to expend, and a large amount of leisure time to be consumed. That this energy and time have not been altogether wasted we have direct evidence. The priests of New Zealand, for example, turned to account their leisure time by ac- quiring skill in wood carving and in other arts; the shamans of the ancient Mexicans and Peruvians became adepts at mixing colors, at painting, at drawing hieroglyphics, at composing music and in reckoning time.34 In Oceania and central California the religious leaders gave careful physical, mental, and moral instruction to the boys and young men of their people.35 The observation of the heavenly bodies, the adjustment of the calendar, and the pseudo-science of astrology are indebted for their beginnings to the regulation by the priest class of religious festivals. From the study and practice of astrology came the real science of astronomy. Under primitive conditions the intellectual force of tribe and nation centers chiefly in the medicine-man class. The shamans hence become the preservers of the legends and traditions of the tribe and nation; and since they alone of their people are acquainted with the art of writing, it is the members of this leisure class who compile these legends into history. The medicine-man, therefore, was the first musician, painter, teacher, writer, historian, reckoner of time, physician, priest, and astronomer. The shamanistic class, furthermore, has aided social progress by enforc- ing an unbending, irresistible discipline upon wild and loosely governed tribes. The civil ruler does much to restrain the savage from cutting and slashing his way through life to the confusion and detriment of the com- 13 Dorothy Cator, Every-Day Life Among the Head-Hunters, 189. 34 J.

If the individual does not comply with the chief's laws, he loses his head, and no longer makes himself obnoxious; he generally obeys because he is afraid to disobey. Yet, law can be evaded; its guardian may be off the beat. The masters of the medicine-man, however, are omni- present at all times and the fear of human vengeance is not a circumstance to the fear of the gods. The chief can lash a culprit or turn him out of his holdings, but the gods can torment him both in this world and in the world to come. While the primitive man, therefore, might fail to conform with regulated conduct, he cannot forget that the gods and their repre- sentative are not mocked. As an illustration of the way in which fear of the supernatural works out in savage life, it is only necessary to say that among sundry peoples this fear is so intense that brave young men sometimes die of fright upon discovering that they have unwittingly violated one of the shaman's regulations."3 Many of these priestly laws enforce labor, thrift, personal cleanliness, chastity, fidelity between husband and wife; they require obedience to the regulations of the cult; they demand self-sacrifice, restrict personal freedom, prescribe the renunciation of pleasure and property, and, in general, are quite effective in disciplining savage peoples into an approximately fixed code of conduct. In view, therefore, of the shaman's service as a disciplinarian can it truthfully be affirmed that his presence in society has been a detriment? The medicine-men, moreover, cooperate with the civil powers in en- forcing submission to political authority as in a case which the writer observed at Bontoc, in the mountain province of Northern Luzon, Philip- pine islands. A Bontoc Igorot was serving in the Philippine constabulary when he sickened and died from pneumonia. At the funeral his relatives, believing he had been murdered by Benguet Igorot, traditional enemies of their clan, nearly prevailed upon the Bontoc people to make a head-hunting raid -upon the villages of Benguet for blood revenge. The United States authorities assembled the Bontoc priests and explained to them the real cause of the death. Those shamans then persuaded the angry relatives that their suspicions were unfounded, and the trouble was averted. It is in the field of medicine, however, that the shaman's contribution to social culture is most apparent. When called to the bedside of a sufferer, the medicine-man, like any other practitioner, first diagnoses the case. The diagnosis consists in determining whether the sickness is due to the influence of afriendly or unfriendly spirit. If an unfriendly spirit is present, the doctor sets about casting it out. 36 A. G. Keller, Social Science, 138.</page><page sequence="14">516 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 32, 1930 One method of casting out spirits, or exorcism, is that of causing the patient's body to become such a disagreeable habitation that the evil spirit will not remain in it. The shamans of Sumatra, for example, attempt to banish the evil spirit from an insane person by placing the unfortunate in a house and setting fire to the building, leaving the wretch to escape if he can."' In other tribes the sick person is fumigated, made to swallow nauseous substances and drenched with foul concoctions which only the savage imagination could conceive-all for the distinct purpose of dis- gusting and driving out the unseen intruder. Absurd, says the modern man. And yet the a'dministrdtion of vile-tasting substances for the pur- pose of routing evil spirits led to the discovery of drugs and medicines which have vomitory and cathartic effects-remedies indispensable in every modern medicine chest. Physical force is frequently employed by the spirit doctor to expel the disease demon. Among the Columbian Indians, in case of abdominal pains, the medicine-man pressed his clenched fists with great might into the center of the solar plexus.38 The writer has known many innocent old men and women of the Tagalog people, natives of the Philippine islands, when they were thought to be possessed by vicious spirits, to be cruelly beaten and otherwise maltreated because the doctors believed that in this manner the evil spirit could be exorcised. Navaho and Ojibwa medicine-men applied a bony tube, similar to a European stethoscope, to the part of the patient's body where the pain was most intense, and sucked in order to give relief." The California Indian doctors had a tube, called the "chacuaco," made from a very hard, black stone. This they used for sucking out the disease spirit.40 Preposter- ous, says the citizen of the twentieth century. The therapeutical ex- pedient known as "cupping," however, still in vogue, especially in country districts, had its beginning in this primitive sucking method. The native doctor of Alaska uses the bone of an eagle's wing as a sucking instrument.41 The transition from sucking with the mouth to a real cupping instrument is here seen. By use of a cupping glass, in case of a boil, for example, the blod is drawn to the surface of the body where the boil is located. The phago- cytes, then, combat and destroy the cocci bacilli, which have gained en- trance to the tissue spaces, and the patient is relieved.

Another method of exorcism is by kneading and massaging the body. This process as practiced in central Australia has been described as fol- lows by eye-witnesses: A middle-aged man fell sick. His illness was at once ascribed to the fact that he had deliberately done what he perfectly well knew was contrary to the custom, and no one was in the least surprised. "Amongst the men in the camp were five doctors, and as the case was evidently a very serious one, they were called into consultation. One of them, a celebrated medicine-man from a neighboring .... tribe, gave it as his opinion that the bone of a dead man, attracted by the camp-fire, had entered the body of the patient and was causing all the trouble. The others agreed with this opinion, but, not to be outdone by a stranger, the oldest [home doctor of the tribe] decided that, in addition to the bone, an arabillia, or wart of the gum tree, had some- how got inside the man's body. The three less experienced doctors looked very grave, but said nothing beyond the fact that they fully concurred in the diagnosis of their elder colleagues. At all events it was decided that both the bone and the wart must be removed, and under the cover of darkness they were in part [supposed to be] removed after much sucking and rubbing of the patient's body."42 Cases of this kind might be multiplied, but one must suffice. The point in question is that the shaman, in spite of an untenable theory, lighted upon a modern method of treatment. For the practice of osteopathy is based upon massaging processes. The osteopath, be it understood, does not pretend to remove an evil spirit or other disturbing agents; his object is to restore dormant organs to normal action. Massaging is recognized by physicians of repute as a therapeutic agency in cases of sprains, bruises, indigestion, and many other complaints. Again our savage friends have anticipated a distinctly modern method. Fire is regarded by the medicine-man as a powerful means of spirit expulsion. AccorJling to his theory fire is caused by spirit activity. Whence came fire? How did man first obtain possession of it? In volcanic regions its discovery is easily explained. It was belched up from the depths of the earth. To the savage mind there is but one explanation of volcanic erup- tion-it is mysterious, and therefore due to spirit activity. Hence the resulting fire either contains a spirit or is itself a spirit. In non-volcanic territories there is another explanation for the discovery of fire: electrical storms have always occurred over all the earth. Fire, then, must have come from the lightning's flash which ignited the trees of the forest and the 42 W. B. Spencer and F. J. Gillen, The Northern Tribes of Central Australia, 515-516.</page><page sequence="16">518 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 32, 1930 grass of the steppes. Since, however, lightning comes from the skies, it must, in savage thought, be sent by the spirits who abide in the heavenly regions. Fire crackles, sputters, and inflicts pain. Primitive man ascribes these powers to a spirit in the fire or to the spirit which is the fire itself. Now, since fire either is, or contains a spirit, may it not be used to drive away infernal spirits? This the savage believes, especially since he finds it useful in ridding himself of his mundane foes. Since, therefore, fire can vanquish earthly enemies, it can likewise drive away spirit adversaries. The reason- ing is clear. Thus, among the Yakut, a boy whose finger had become inflamed came to the conclusion that a "yor" or spirit, had established itself in the finger. This opinion was shared by a group of bystanders. Desiring to drive out the spirit, the boy took a burning coal and began to apply it around the place while blowing upon it. When the burned flesh began to blister, and then burst into a little crackle, the curious group which had crowded around him flew back with cries of horror. But the wounded boy with a smile of satisfaction said, "You saw how it (the spirit) jumped out."43 Curiously the medicine-man by his crude employment of fire uncon- sciously initiated a scientific procedure. Fire is the only infallible germicide knpwn to the scientific world. By it water is purified, surgical instruments are sterilized, and by the cooking of food, germs of disease are destroyed and many a period of sickness thus prevented. The invaluable process of cauterizing infected bites and wounds goes back to a cure by the Araucanians, by the Gilbert islanders, and by the Indians of southern California.44 When the shamans of those tribes applied the live coal to an infected wound it was, of course, for the purpose of driving out an evil spirit. What they really did, however, regardless of intentions, was to cauterize the wound. Water, too, in primitive thought, is believed to have a powerful in- fluence over spirits. The sea rolls, the breakers roar, the waves lash the shore. Floods overwhelm men and beasts, canoes are overturned and the occupants drown-all this calls for explanation. The savage reasons that water abounds in spirits who do these beautiful, mysterious, and terrible things. And so the shaman uses its occult powers. He observes that water can cleanse clothing, weapons, and the human body. Why, then, cannot water spirits cleanse and purify invisible stains? Here is an 41 W. G. Sumner, The Yakuts. Journ. Roy.

If the primitive doctor thinks the disease spirit is friendly, his method changes from exorcism to propitiation. Among all primitive peoples the most unfailing means of appeasing the angry gods and of securing their favor, is thought to be the offering of blood. The spirits, as has been sug- gested, are anthropomorphic beings, and since, therefore, they relished the taste of blood when in the flesh, they have not changed subsequently to their apotheosis. Thus, the rulers of the ancient Mexicans were the descendants of conquering cannibals. The idols, representing their gods, were fed with human hearts. When the priests represented to the chiefs that the idols were starving, war was waged and captives taken, "because the gods demanded something to eat.''45 It is not always necessary that the priest kill a victim, however, in order to obtain sacrificial blood. He sometimes cuts the skin of the victim's head with a seal's tooth, catches the blood in rags, and lays the bloody rags beside a corpse as a substitute. In other instances he simply pierces the ears and shoulders of the victim, gathers the blood in a sponge, and squeezes it into a sacred vessel.46 The striking thing about sacrificial blood-letting is that the shaman in his zeal to propitiate the spirits by blood offerings, unconsciously and inadvertently initiated a therapeutic agency which has never been aban- doned-that of venesection, or the cutting of veins in order to draw away the patient's blood. In the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, blood-letting was applied by doctors in every kind of sickness. During the latter half of the eighteenth century, however, there was a reaction against its excessive use, and the practice was to a great extent discontinued. But within the last quarter of a century there has been a revival in its favor, and it has been employed by progressive physicians in cases of advanced mitral disease, pneumonia, and other complaints. Here again the twentieth century practitioner owes something to the medicine-man, and has been benefited by the pioneering work of his precursor. Additional evidence that the shaman's contribution to the science of medicine has been most real and positive is forthcoming from the assertion that 46 Antonio de Herrera, General History of the Vast Continent and Islands of America, 3: 206-213 (translation by Stevens). 46 Julius Lippert, Die Kulturgeschichte der Menscheit, 2: 328.</page><page sequence="18">520 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 32, 1930 our materia medica owes tobacco, gum-copal, liquid amber, sarsaparilla, resin of tecamaca, jalap, and huaca to (the medicine men of) the Aztecs; and, again, that guiacum, ipecacuanha, and certain purgatives first became known through the In- dian medicine men;47 and from the fact that a painstaking, personal comparison between the Cherokee pharmacopoeia and the United States Dispensatory reveals the fact that about twenty remedies examined were correctly used. I have, in another place, traced scores of useful drugs back to the customs and practices of medicine-men.4" The shaman, therefore, adverse criticism to the contrary notwithstand- ing, is not a social octopus. Despite the strong conviction of many writers concerning the perniciousness of his influence, he and the principles for which he stands have always formed the conservative element in his group Despite the selfish aims and ambitions of the medicine-man and his fellows, the growth of political institutions has been tremendously promoted by the activities of the priest class. Despite the parasitical imposition upon society of this "hanger-on," certain phases of history, education, literature, and natural science have had their origin with him. Despite the shaman's oppression of the masses, he has been instrumental in the enforcement upon men of a rigorous, uncompromising discipline, and for that reason alone he represents one of the most socially beneficent institutions ever evolved. Despite the multitudinous faults and even crimes that have been laid to the charge of this personage, to him and his class must be credited the initiating, fathering, fostering, and for centuries of preserving the noble art of healing. Upon this fragile foundation the science of medicine has built its im- posing structure. Beginning with the blind gropings of the shaman in his efforts to expel or appease malicious or angry spirits, medical science left, long ago, the lap of its mother superstition, learning anatomy from Egyp- tian embalming, increasing its knowledge from the Greek study of living bodies, adding, as time went on, public hygiene from the Jews and the beginning of operative surgery from the Hindus. It acquired skill in sick nursing during the Middle Ages, and developed anatomy as a science during the Renaissance; it began the study of pathology and the practice of instrumental diagnosis during the eighteenth century. Nineteenth cen- tury practitioners brought the crude beginning of surgery well-nigh to a 47 Lucien Biart, Lez Aztiques, 285 (translation). 48 John Lee Maddox, The Medicine Man, 217-282.</page><page sequence="19">MADDOX] THE SPIRIT THEORY IN MEDICINE 521 state of perfection and organized medicine into a science; while contem- porary physicians have honored their profession by the introduction of anti- septic surgery, serums, and preventive medicine.

And the medical is one of those sciences which seems capable of boundless, measureless development; it is ever advancing, and showing the capacity for we know not what illimitable progress.
