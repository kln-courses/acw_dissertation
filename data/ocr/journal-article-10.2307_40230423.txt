Introduction In recent times it has become fashionable to emphasize the role of conceptual change in the (philosopher's) history of science. To judge from recent writers (Feyerabend 5-9, Kuhn 18), every significant theo- retical change in science is first and foremost a revolution in scientific concepts- a conceptual revolution. According to this view, every level of experience is affected by each fundamental theoretical change: physical theory, experimental practice and even perceptual experience. The Aristotelian patrician who watched the sun sink beneath the horizon not only had different beliefs (theory) about the phenomenon but actually saw something different from the Newtonian gentleman who saw the horizon rise above his eye-sun line, and the Einsteinian professional who saw the sun's varying geometrical relations to the world light-geodesies on which successive temporal stages of his eye world-line lay. Moreover, such is the completeness of the conceptual- experiential shifts undergone in a fundamental scientific change that it is impossible to meaningfully discuss the one theory within the confines of the other or, indeed, to provide any systematic, cumulative comparison of successive theories. This perceptual - conceptual shift creates the 'new world' view of theory change which these authors seem to favour. Not that I do not have sympathy for the view that during the history of science our theoretical conception of the world has undergone radical change. Nor that I feel irrevocably committed to some rigid form of Classical Empiricism. But I do find it difficult to accept the view of total change which has now become so popular, for this view has what seem to me two unacceptable consequences: (G|) There is a thoroughgoing change in perceptual experience paralleling each major scientific change, (C2) There is no rational account of the history of science possible (certainly no account on which scientific knowledge is in any sense cumulative). In this paper I want to examine the consequences of a particular doctrine of perception for this model of scientific change, in particular 59</page><page sequence="2">C A. Hooker the consequences of the role of conception in perception which this doctrine yields. My aim is to show how this doctrine, which has itself increasing scientific backing, avoids such extreme conclusions, while yet doing justice to the modern critique of rigid Empiricism. In the next section we shall outline the modern critique of Empiricism and in the sections following that present my own view of the matter. 2. The Critique of Empiricism and the Consequences Drawn Therefrom: Two central tenets of Empiricism are: (Ei) Sensory experience is independent of, and the foundation for, all knowledge about the world; (E2) scientific knowledge is inductive cumulative and unitary (the truth is one).1 The first tenet, Ei, is the foundation of empiricist epistemology. The justification of any claim to knowledge about the world, scientific or popular, must be in terms of the sensory evidence which speaks in its favour. Since sensory evidence cannot speak directly in the favour of knowledge claims referring to allegedly unobservable things and be- haviour, Empiricism consistently construes the meanings of theoretical sentences in terms of the meanings of observational sentences. Thus the epistemological programme of Classical Empiricism leads irre- sistably to a logico-semantical thesis concerning the logical structure and meaning of scientific theories.2 Sensory experience, already epistemologically fundamental, is now also semantically fundamental -it fixes the meanings of the basic observational terms in science (through the so-called 'ostensive definition'). One is thus prepared for the Thesis of the Given: The world presents itself to us in con- ceptualized units, the conceptually and epistemologically fundamental sensory givens. (Thus we see the grounds for the intimate connection between the Empiricist tradition in science and the Phenomenalist tradition in perception - the givens have usually been chosen to be sensations or sense data.) The second tenet, E2, which also determines Empiricist methodology, follows on naturally from the first. Since all general scientific claims must ultimately be justified in terms of sensory experience, such justi- fication can only be inductive and this dictates that the prudent scientist will work from the basic data to the claims which it will justify. The rules for retrospective assessment and prospective metho- dology are one and the same. Moreover, the independence of sensory experience from scientific theorizing guarantees that experience will not change, but merely accumulate, during the course of scientific progress. Thus scientific progress represents the accumulation of knowl- edge and science itself must be converging on that 'omega point' where it contains the whole truth. Sensory experience becomes the focal point 1 For a slightly expanded discussion of Empiricism and references see my 16. 2 This structure represents the 'classical' view of the structure of science as repre- sented in most texts. It has, however, changed somewhat over the years. Compare, in this respect, Camap's classical Aufbau, 2, with his later 3. See also, for example, Feigl 4 and Hempel 11 and my remarks in 16. 60</page><page sequence="3">Empiricism, Perception, Conceptual Change on which all theories must converge and the very singleness of this domain then guarantees that all theories must be consistent and, ul- timately, together form a single whole: the monolithic truth of science. Such is the unity of the foregoing Empiricist position that it is dif- ficult to reject any part of it without rejecting the whole. We shall now briefly discuss Feyerabend's rejection of the whole.3 The originating impulse of Feyerabend's critique of Empiricism is methodological. According to Feyerabend, Empiricism leads to the dogmatic demand that each successive theory in a given domain of experience shall agree with every preceding theory in that domain. This Consistency Condition, as Feyerabend calls it, means that all subsequent theories are critized by the criteria and claims of preceding theories. And this means raising those preceding theories to the level of dogma for they themselves become uncriticizable. But of course our earliest theories are also our crudest (not to mention our most anthropomorphic and superstitious). Thus Empiricism leads to the ridi- culous situation where our least reputable ideas are raised to the level of dogma. Moreover, because of its semantical reduction of the theoretical to the observable and its intimate links with the Phenomenalist tradition, Empiricism leads inevitably away from a Realist doctrine of perception (and towards Phenomenalism) and, correctively, away from a Realist doctrine of physical theory toward Instrumentalism. It leaves theories with only a second class status, which is a gross distortion of their role in the history of science and in the structure of human knowledge. But Empiricism is. as we have said, a coherent body of doctrine and anyone who wishes to reject it must develop his own account of the meanings of theoretical expressions and the nature and role of observation in science. Feyerabend totally rejects the centrality of the im- mediate experience in the structure of science which is characteristic of Empiricism and offers this central role to theories and theorizing. According to Feyerabend theoretical expressions obtain their meanings through the fundamental structures of the theories in which they occur rather than through any connection which they may have with sensory expereince.4 Indeed, Feyerabend extends this doctrine to all expressions of science, including the so-called observation language maintaining that (i) all sentences of science are 'theoretically loaded' and have their fundamental meanings fixed through their theoretical connections and (ii) which sentences are counted as sentences of the observation language is a pragmatic affair, being largely determined by the Theo- retical context.5 3 Kuhn's position, which is evidently not dissimilar to Feyerabend's ultimate position (at least to the extent that anyone can be reasonably confident as to what his position is!), has recently been discussed in detail- See 19- and we shall not discuss it further here. 4 See especially 9 where a syntactic criterion of theory-determined meaning change is offered, and also 7 and 8 passim. 5 This doctrine Feyerabend expounds under the heading of "The Pragmatic Theory of Observation." See 5, p. 144f; 6, p. 35f; 8, p. 212f. 61</page><page sequence="4">G A. Hooker According to Feyerabend the methodological ideal for science, the best procedure for the acquisition of knowledge, is the creation of a set of theories for each domain of science which have the following characteristics: (i) any two theories drawn from the set are mutually incompatible, (ii) each theory is factually adequate for the domain in question (i.e. it agrees with the known facts to within experimental errors and is, in principle, applicable throughout the domain under consideration, whether this domain has been fully investigated or not), and, (iii) each theory is coherent (i.e. the logical integration of each statement of the theory within the remainder of the theory is 'tight', so that the fundamental structure of the theory is to some degree inti- mately involved in every application of it).6 It follows that such Strong Alternatives, as Feyerabend calls them, will each have differing funda- mental structures. But from this and Feyerabend's doctrine of the meanings of theoretical expressions it follows that they will share no meanings in common- they are said to be 'incommensurable' theories. And since 'facts', and observation expressions in general, are formulated within the language of some theory, or at least their meanings are fixed by their theoretical context, any 'autonomy' of facts or observations vis-a-vis theories is completely removed. In this way Feyerabemd com- pletely undermines the sensory basis of the traditional Empiricist account. It is not hard to see how Feyerabend's doctrine leads to the two (unacceptable) consequences stated in section I. Feyerabend regards the major theoretical transitions of the history of science to be transitions between incommensurable theories. Indeed, since they are clearly tran- sitions between theories whose structures differ this conclusion is forced on Feyerabend by his own doctrine of meaning. But such a view fractures the history of science into a number of unrelated, and un- relatable, episodes. A succeeding theory cannot explain its predecessor, for explanation would require that it be both logically consistent with it and semantically related to it. But the successor relation is just that of strong alternatives to one another, i.e. it is one of incommensura- bility and inconsistency. (A fortiori, reducing one theory or domain to another is impossible.) Indeed, it becomes impossible to understand how one could decide between rival theories. Normally, we should say that an experiment is conducted the outcome of which, when formulated, refutes at least one theory and (preferably) confirms the other. Now confirmation and refutation are relations which can hold only between semantically related sentences and they are normally construed as requiring relations of logical compatibility and incompatibility respectively. But how can it be the same proposition, fact or whatever that has such relations to two incommensurable theories, both of whom confer their own charac- teristic meanings on any attempted formulation of the outcome of an 6 The rationale for this methodology is briefly summarised on pp. 490-1 of my 14. 62</page><page sequence="5">Empiricism, Perception, Conceptual Change experiment? Clearly no 'crucial tests' of a pair of rival theories is possible.7 It becomes difficult then to understand the history of science in terms of conflict, and the resolution of conflict, between rival theories. The key relations in the history of science seem to be psychological relations of association of ideas within scientists heads for there are no objective relations among incommensurable theories which would provide a rational basis either for a rational reconstruction of the history of science or for a methodological procedure for the resolution of contemporary conflict.8 Similarly, the Pragmatic Theory of Observation, with its emphasis on the 'theory loadedness' of observation, clearly entails that during a major theoretical change once accepted observational descriptions of situations will disappear to be replaced by quite different, incommen- surable observational description of those situations. The argument now runs: If a fact be regarded as an assertion in the observational language, a doctrine Feyerabend seems to accept, then clearly facts also come and go with theories. In a sufficiently general theoretical . change all facts in a given domain will be replaced in this fashion. But if every fact pertaining to an observational situation is replaced by a different, incommensurable one what can there be about that observational situation which remains the same? We shall have to conclude that the observational experience itself is in some sense different. We shall have to conclude, as we said, that Aristotle, Newton and Einstein are in different observational settings, have different perceptual experiences, at sunset.9 Such are the consequences of Feyerabend's anti-Empiricist position. Is the coherence of the Empiricist position such that all attempts to criticise it are faced with this alternative? I would like to feel free to accept Feyerabend's basic methodological criticism or strict Empiricism and of course I want to treat theories seriously as existing in their own 7 At least not in the usual sense of that term. Feyerabend devotes considerable time to elaborating a theory of the testing of theories which attempts to remove these dif- ficulties, but with dubious success (though this is not the place to go into the matter). For comments on Feyerabend's position along the above line see also Butts 1. Actually, there is an embarrassing clash between the claim that rival theories are (or ought to be) incompatible and the conclusion that they will (by virtue of their dif- fering structures) also be incommensurable - they simply cannot be both at once! But we overlook this point in what follows. 8 I am not of course claiming that the entire history of science has been completely rational. But I do believe that the 'conservative' position which reads into the history of science a good deal of reasoned Jnvpntion of new theories and reasoned triumph over preceding theories has a good deal more to be said for it than its con- temporary rejection would lead one to suppose. As I have said, I regard Feyerabend's critique of traditional Empiricism as a much needed and liberating emphasis on the other side of the story. But a truly reasonable assessment ought to be independent of the swing of the historical pendulum. 9 Here I only parallel the argument found in the last part of 8. Cf. also the illustrations which Feyerabend offers earlier on in 8 (e.g. that surrounding the rhinocerous drawing) and also his discussion of sunrises and other examples in 6 and 7. 63</page><page sequence="6">G A. Hooker right. Must I also then accept these less palatable consequences of his position? There are really only two points at which one could begin a pene- trating attack on Feyerabend's detailed position - one can attack his doctrine of meaning and one can attack his doctrine of perception. (Actually, of course, neither can be carried out without getting some- what involved in the other.)10 In this paper I want to present a doctrine of the relations between perception and science alternative to that which Feyerabend presents and indicate how this doctrine leads to a reassessment of Empiricism and to a more coherent account of theory comparison and theory evolution. We shall see, however, that the final upshot is not so very different in principle from some of the things which Feyerabend says and this will in turn raise very serious questions about evaluating the course of human scientific history and the nature and state of human knowledge. Paradoxically, precisely these difficult questions seem forced upon us by the very advance of that scientific knowledge. 3. The Reasonable Foundation of Empiricism The reader of the preceding section may have noticed the real, if implicit, 'soft' slide from "differing theoretical context" to "differing theoretical description of that context" to "differing observational des- cription of that context" to "differing observational context" to "dif- fering observational experience" that occurred in the third last para- graph. Let us keep these elements distinct. There is the non-linguistic physical context itself, there are the descriptions of that context, theo- retical and observational, and finally there is the sensory experience had by normal observers in that context (an experience whose inde- pendence from theoretical belief is at present in doubt). Now as soon as one isolates the components thus one can easily pinpoint the conservative's source of unease over Feyerabend's doctrine of total change. There is an obvious sense of change (though it may not be a clear sense) for which it is very plausible to believe that the non-linguistic physical context does not change just because of theoreti- cal changes. Moreover, there is as little reason to believe that the neuro- physiological structure of man's sensory equipment has changed signi- ficantly during historical times. Finally we add a third, reasonable scientific claim: the stimulated state of an organism's sensory equipment depends only on the physical context causally responsible for the stimu- lation and the neurophysiological structure of the sensory equipment. Put these three claims together and you arrive at the conclusion that the stimulated states of Aristotle's, Newton's and Einstein's sensory 10 Of course one could also attack his general methodology, and more fundamentally his epistemology, and even more fundamentally his general conception of human nature and human rationality. But I don't want to go to any of that here (and I shall probably never want to attack his general epistemology and methodology - though I have some misgivings about the conception of human nature and rationality which he is developing, cf. my 14). 64</page><page sequence="7">Empiricism, Perception, Conceptual Change equipment would all be more or less the same in the same physical sunset circumstances. Surely, the conservative asks, this kind of con- sideration must count for something in our accounts of science and of the history of science. The outstanding question, of course, is: "Does the stimulation state of an organism's sensory equipment uniquely determine the perceptual experience had and the content of the perceptual beliefs thus formed? " The answer to this question is now increasingly well documented in psychology and "No." The ultimate perceptual state of an observer is also a function of his beliefs, expectations, desires and so on.11 One of the aims of the rather sober methodology of the physical laboratory is precisely to remove as many of these factors as is possible (the impossibility of doing this in the case of the social sciences is one of the important complicating factors in their methodology)- but of course what cannot be removed is the background knowledge and beliefs, of which preceding theories will form an important part. So far it would appear that Feyerabend is on the right track. Per- ception shows precisely that flexibility and dependence upon other factors in the percipient's conscious state to which Feyerabend appeals. In fact, a study of contemporary psychology leads us to postulate the following general theory of perception.12 Perception is fundamentally to be regarded as a process of selection, abstraction and trans- formation in the cortex which culminates in a conscious, judgmental state. That selected from, abstracted and transformed is the physical stimulation pattern produced at the sensory receptors by the impinging external world. The entire process, and not any one of its parts, con- stitutes our perceiving of the external world. (This is thus a thoroughly Realist doctrine of perception, there is not here any place for sensory data as usually conceived and certainly no place for data as perceived; the data of perception, i.e., contents of those perceptual judgments which climax the perceptual process, occur only as part of the per- ceptual act, they are not themselves perceived.) In the present context the important feature of this doctrine is its view of perception as a process. For the perceptual judgments, i.e., the culminating elements of the perceptual process, will themselves be functions of the preceding elements of the process. Thus we open up the possibility that perceptual judgments which we do in fact make are functions, not only of the incoming pattern of physical stimulation, but also of the kinds of processing skills and interests which we possess at the moment. A perceptual judgment then may be a function of our past experiences, our current emotional state, our current beliefs, our current foci of interests and so on, as well as all the actual patterns of stimu- lation of our sensory receptors. And such in fact has been found to be the case.11 11 See any good introduction to psychology. For detailed papers see, for example, Held 10, Henle 13, Kohler 17, Snyder and Sendon 21, and Wittreich 22. For a detailed Realist philosophy of perception which takes these matters into account see my 15. 12 Here I briefly summarize the doctrine as presented in 15. 65</page><page sequence="8">C A. Hooker To judge from the scattered observations Feyerabend has made about the nature of perception (see especially 5 and the last section of 8) Feyerabend would himself largely subscribe to this process view of perception. And within this view it is very easy to accommodate Feyer- abend's insistence on the influential role of theories in determining the percepts had. For to arrive at the conclusion that the content of his perceptual judgments will be, at least in part, a function of those theoretical beliefs we need only add that among a man's beliefs which are active in the perceptual process are those physical theories which he holds at the moment. In fact, we can sum up the relationship between Feyerabend's doctrine of the status of role of observation in science and the present doctrine of perception as follows: Feyerabend's claim concerning the theoretical dependence of the observation language, and of observational claims, in science would be vindicated if among those factors which were active in determining the cortical perceptual processing of the incoming physical information were found the theories in which the percipient believed. Moreover, if we attach the rider that the defense of the doctrine must be a reasonable or plausible one, I think we may strengthen the foregoing statement by the addition of the "only if" connective as well. Now, and this is the second im- portant point to be made here, whether or not a percipient's theoretical beliefs influence his perception of the world is a matter open to em- pirical psychological investigation. Finally, I believe that psychological research provides clear support for the following answer to this em- pirical question: with some exceptions, which are almost totally peri- pheral to the pursuit of modern science, a percipient's theoretical beliefs do NOT influence his perceptual processing activity.™ For example, one can imagine that an Aristotelian watching the setting sun would perceptually adopt the earth as the fixed reference frame and have a perceptual experience of the sun sinking toward it, while a Newtonian, perhaps, may adopt the sun as the fixed reference point and have a perceptual experience of the horizon rising toward it (just what you would do with the Einsteinian is uncertain). But only under pathological circumstances of the deepest kind would we expect to be able to convince any homo sapiens that the sun was square and have him actually see a square sun, or that {he Sun stood still in the sky and have him actually fail to see any relative sun-horizon motion, or that the sun was green and have him see a green sun, or ... It is true, of course, that the rival physical theories in question do not disagree about these latter facts, but then again it is no accident that no theory has been put forward under which the sun is square or green or ob- servably stationary in the sky. For the fact of the matter is that it is downright impossible to believe that our theories could effect our per- ceptions of these aspects of the sunset situation whilst ever we re- mained sane. (We might, of course, attempt to defend these views through some elaborate theory of mass illusion or hallucination or the 13 See again the detailed references listed in the bibliography - and there are many others besides these- and the summary of the situation given in my 16. 66</page><page sequence="9">Empiricism, Perception, Conceptual Change like, but then we should be conceding precisely that our actual obser- vational experience did not agree with the theory.) Similarly, one would expect the Aristotelian and us to agree, on looking at a cloud chamber, that there was a metal box there with a thin white curved streak of something-or-other in it. More fundamentally, one could hardly believe that our specific scientific theories could alter our fundamental per- ception of the world in terms of three-dimensional objects in space and time which we of "Western culture" share in common. The only kind of exception to the general scientific theory-inde- pendence of our most simple perceptions which I have been able to pinpoint and which are at all realistic arise in situations which are perceptually ambiguous in various ways. The type of case illustrated in the preceding paragraph (i.e. concerning 'absolute' sun, horizon motion) is where one has a certain 'illusion proneness' built into a situa- tion, by this I mean that there are features of the situation which are continually tempting us to interpret it first one way and then in another. In such circumstances a percipient might resolve the ambiguity de- cisively in favour of one alternative on the basis of other things, in- cluding theories which he believes. A similar kind of circumstance is of the sort illustrated by the blowing scarf in the darkened room which is perceived as a scurrying cat. Here, paucity of information provides a certain kind of structural or functional ambiguity so that, initially, a variety of ways of seeing situations are offered. In the appropriate circumstances, for example, entering an unknown laboratory in poor lighting conditions, we might expect such situations to present them- selves under conditions where the percipient's knowledge of science became of importance for his initial formation of perceptually active interpretative processings.14 Thus despite its initial palusibility, and despite my acceptance of a major characteristic of perception which Feyerabend avows, I must reject his specific claims concerning the significant role of theoretical beliefs in the formation of perceptual experiences. And with this re- jection we undermine much of the foundation of his doctrine of the theoretical dependence of observational terms- certainly we undermine the suggestion that the world of perceivings, of 'simple' observational truths, is in a constant state of flux at the behest of theory. We con- servatives see as the grain of truth in the old Empiricist tradition the core of perceptual experience which is, as a matter of fact, independent of which scientific theories are believed at the time. But I have already granted that much of Feyerabend's general critique of empiricism is acceptable. And I believe there is even considerable truth to his claim that the observational language is indeed theory-laden. The question then before us is whether it is possible to do adequate justice to the points which Feyerabend makes whilst yet retaining the reasonable 14 That is, we might expect a scientifically trained person to arrive more rapidly and more accurately at an adequate way of perceiving the situation than would his scientifically untrained counterpart. Note that by 'more accurately' here I do not mean 'theoretically more correct', but rather intend to refer to the perceptual level adequately prescribed in terms of metal boxes, benches, glass tubes and so on. 67</page><page sequence="10">G A. Hooker core of Empiricism for which I have argued in this section. In the next section I shall attempt to offer a doctrine which effects precisely this reconciliation. 4. Theory-Dependence and Observation in Science. We shall begin by reminding ourselves of a point stressed by the doctrine of perception which has been adopted. The very possession of intelligible sensory experience already presupposes the possession of a rich conceptual framework in terms of which the mind actively processes the incoming physical stimuli. As I have already remarked, the doctrine of perception which centrally enshrines this point runs directly contrary to the Empiricism account under which we experience the world as a series of presentations of conceptualized 'givens' from which the mind acquires both its percepts and its concepts- this entire aspect of Empiricism is gladly rejected.15 Now let us single out those concepts, the possession of which is a necessary condition for having intelligible perceptual experience. My initial aim in developing the doctrine of this section is to construct a language, employing only these concepts, which is explicitly free from any specific scientific theoretical commitment. Let us refer to the set of concepts in question as the Co concepts. They are to be sharply distinguished from the concepts which are employed in the theoretical interpretation and theoretical explanation of sensory experience. Let us refer to the concepts employed in this latter task as the d concepts. The fundamental level of Co concepts are the categorial concepts of space, time, causality, identity, quality, and so on. At a more specific level they include the determinable concepts of shape, size, position, motion, colour, sound and so on. At a more specific level still they include the determinates of these determinable properties (e.g. three feet to the left, square, red and so on). The collection of all these con- cepts form a single coherent conceptual scheme, possession of which is a necessary condition for the possession of intelligible sensory ex- perience. By contrast the Ct concepts include those of the electron, the field, of voltage, of a cloud chamber and so on. Possession of these Ct concepts is not a necessary condition for the possession of intel- ligible sensory experience.16 Before developing the doctrine any further it is necessary to draw some distinctions in order to separate off the purified Co language from dangerously similar languages which nonetheless retain a specific theoretical commitment. The first distinction which is necessary is that between two quite different uses which we make of the same typographical or verbal sign designs. For some sign designs (typographical and/or verbal) are used 15 For further criticism along these lines see Hooker 15, 16 and Sellars 20. 16 The distinction being drawn in this paragraph has a thoroughly Kantian flavour- as, indeed, has the entire doctrine of perception on which it is based- though the specific doctrine developed here does not coincide with Kant's, for it does not eive an a priori status to claims concerning space, time etc., nor does it treat these as forms of intuition. 68</page><page sequence="11">Empiricism, Perception, Conceptual Change in an ambiguous fashion, on some occasions the concepts which they are used to express belong properly to the Co level and on other occasions they are used to express concepts which belong properly to the CT level. Consider the typographical sign design SPACE. One of the uses this design has is in sentences which any ordinary person, of any literate age in our Western culture, would naturally write down in order to express his sensory experiences, beliefs about the world and so on. Another use for the same design is in the sentences a modern physicist uses to explain quantum theory. In these two uses two dif- ferent, though related, concepts are being expressed. (And if we accept that a word is a use for a sign-design, then we must say also that two different words are being used - though this is, unfortunately, not our usual habit.) The two concepts are related, for they have a common core, namely that content of the concept of space necessary for the concept to be usable in the understanding, or the rendering intel- ligible, of our sensory experience. In its ordinary usage the concept may have little more than this necessary core to it. (The necessary occurrence of the word "may" here makes necessary, but is also ex- plained by, the next distinction to be discussed- see below.) The latter concept, on the other hand, carries all of the theoretical content of the theory from which it was culled. A sentence is to belong to our Co language, therefore, if and only if each of its components is being used in the first of the two ways discussed here. Unfortunately, even the ordinary, or common sense use of a concept may carry with it a tacit theoretical commitment. Consider, for ex- ample, the concept 'solid'. The Oxford English Dictionary gives two components to its standard meaning: (i) hard, resisting penetration, and (ii) completely filled up, lacking interstices. But pretty clearly component (ii) is a primitive theoretical attempt to explain why there are any solid objects in sense (i). Many of the words in our ordinary English language are like this and in this sense the semantics of a common language conceals all manner of theoretical commitment derived from earlier (and now largely forgotten - indeed, probably largely subconscious) theorizing. But this fact makes it necessary to distinguish between natural language and our purified Co language. Roughly speaking, the Co language is to be the natural language use of Co concepts, but stripped of all their component or tacit theoretical commitment. The drawing of these two distinctions, which seem both possible and reasonable to draw, should dissolve any temptation the reader may have had to object to saying that possession of concepts such as that of space were a necessary condition of intelligible or sensory experience by pointing out that one can have intelligible sensory ex- perience without understanding modern physics. The point made in the felt objection is true but compatible with the doctrine developed here. Equally, there will be those readers who feel that it is impossible ever to free natural language from its theoretical commitments. To possess a language at all according to these people, is already to have formed conceptions of the world and thus to be committed as to its 69</page><page sequence="12">C A Hooker general nature - a thoroughly 'purified' language would be simply no language at all, but a contentless ghost. I am myself one of those people! Indeed, the very doctrine of perception which I espouse commits me to this point of view, for one evidently cannot have sensory experience at all until one has formed conceptions which will permit one to process the impinging physical stimuli in a coherent fashion, but this is surely already to have committed one's self as to the general nature of the world. But I remind the reader that in distinguishing the Co language I am distinguishing it from language which has specific commitments, i.e., which has theoretical commitments belonging to specific theories of science. If the reader will be patient, I shall later explain in what larger sense I nonetheless conceive of the Co language as carrying with it a theory-like commitment. But for the moment we can surely agree that it is possible, by carrying out the detailed ex- amination of the concepts of our ordinary language, to systematically free them from theoretical commitments drawn from specific scientific theories and the existence, throughout history, of the general run of the 'scientifically uneducated man' provides plausibility to the view that such a language can be constructed. Returning to the development of the doctrine, we are now able to distinguish between descriptive sentences pertaining to the features of an observational situation drawn from the Co language and des- criptive sentences pertaining to the same situation drawn from the CT language (or, for that matter, from theoretically loaded natural lan- guage). Consider, for example, our sunset context. In the Co language we might describe it as "a round, golden light in a blue sky moving closer and closer to the horizon." In Ct concepts it may be described as "a fiery ball in the ninth sphere rotating downwards" or "a gaseous emitter of visible electro-magnetic radiation located at one focus of the ellipse which is the projection of the earth's geodesic space-time path on to a three-dimensional spatial hypersurface." Or again, consider the description of the cloud chamber in the Co language. This might run "a thin, white floating line bending to the right inside a black metal box." The same situation might be described in the Ct language with the sentence "an electron passing through a cloud chamber." Now it is the description in the CT language which is the key description for physical science, for physical theories, but it is the description in the Co language which is the key description for traditional Empiricism.17 17 Indeed the possibility of a description in Co terms is the grain of truth behind the old idea of a purely phenomenal language. Such a phenomenal language, in the sense in which the original Empiricists intended it, has been flatly rejected along with the rejection of sense data. And as we shall make clear below, the characterization of our Co language as one which is totally free of assumption of theorylike commitment is also to be rejected. A second comment is also worthwhile. I am uncertain as to whether the category of Co concepts ought to be extended so as to cover other dimensions of normal life. For example, whether such concepts as chairs, excitement, anger, hope, cheating, building and so on ought also to be counted among the Co concepts. If it were decided that they should be, or that at any rate they had an analogous status and role to play, then this would provide some understanding of the linguistic philosophers' otherwise mysterious and annoying tendency to talk about common language as if it were un- 70</page><page sequence="13">Empiricism, Perception, Conceptual Change Now let us suppose- surely very reasonably- that the possession of a concept is intimately tied to the possession of a certain neuro- physiological cortical structure and of certain cortical processing techniques.18 Assume, moreover (and again very reasonably) that the cortical structure and processing techniques which a person acquires is a function of his hereditary structure and of his environment and that in respect of this latter his cortical development is dominated by the macro-physical features of his environment first and by his socio- cultural environment second. Finally, we make the assumption that at least for literate Western man (but surely also, for most men, whether literate and 'Western' or not), the macro-physical and fundamental socio-cultural environ- ments in which they are raised are essentially the same. (These environ- ments include seasons, rocks, trees, animals, water and so on). One therefore expects, what we anyway find, that the dominant patterns of cortical organization will be essentially the same throughout the human race - certainly this will be the case within a single culture.19 Putting all these premises together, we conclude- what is surely reasonable anyway- that, short of radical change in our cortical structure or sensory equipment, the incoming sensory stimuli being fed to the cortex and the processing of those stimuli in the cortex will remain essentially unchanged throughout the human race and through- out its history. It follows that our Co conceptual scheme and Co lan- guage, and of course our fundamental perceptual experience, will also remain essentially unchanged globally and historically. From which it further follows that these aspects are independent of any specific scientific theories which occur during the historical evolution of science. To be more precise, let us suppose that facts are tied down to des- criptions. Since our Co level descriptions of observational contexts will remain essentially unchanged throughout scientific theoretical change, the facts which such descriptions identify will also remain unchanged. It is in this sense that we can legitimately speak about the same obser- vational context and the same perceptions and factual description of it. Moreover, the existence of the Go language makes possible another fundamental level at which connections are made between contexts in which different theories may operate. This level is the demonstrative alterable and free of assumption. Once again, I remind the reader that I have flatly rejected the view that ordinary language is free of theoretical commitment and that I shall reject the view that even the Co language is free of a theory and like commitment. 18 This is, after all, what my doctrine of perception commits me to. Note that I am not embracing Materialism in this claim. The claim made in the text is one to which every reasonable doctrine of mind-and-brain will surely have to assent. 19 At this point I should rightfully enter a discalimer pertaining to such works as Ben- jamin Lee Whorff's on the Hopi Indians. But an examination and reconciliation of the conclusions which Whorff draws would require a lengthy and intricate discussion concerning what it was to possess a concept and the relation of that possession to effective behaviour, for which there is not the space that is necessary. I shall instead simply comment that, at least in respect of effective behaviour (i.e. survival value) the Hopi Indian does not differ from the rest of mankind. 71</page><page sequence="14">C A. Hooker level. Thus I and others may (non-verbally) point out the same object even though I and my communicant's theoretical descriptions of the object might differ. Similarly, I can place my communicant in a sunset situation, for example, to let him see for himself what it is like, rather than describing it to him. But notice that for the use of such demon- strative indication to be understood at all the participants must already possess a rich conceptual scheme (just consider, for example, the com- plexity of understanding what pointing is), i.e., they must already possess an effective Co conceptual scheme. Now the facts which are pertinent to a theory are Cj descriptions of a situation where the terms employed are drawn from the theory. Now let us consider the situation of theoretically described facts (i.e., sentences drawn from some Ct language which are asserted to be true under some theory) when there is a major theoretical change. Suppose, for example, that the succeeding theory is, as Feyerabend would have it, incommensurable with the theory it is succeeding. In this case, the theoretical facts described in terms of the Cj concepts pertaining to the original theory will simply have to be dropped, they will simply 'disappear', to be replaced by new facts, i.e., by new sentences con- taining Cj concepts drawn from the new theory and held to be true. This is the sense in which theoretical facts are obvious theory-laden and come and go with theories. Co level facts, on the other hand, are not theoretically-laden in this sense and do not come and go with theories. (It is probably because we persist in using the same word at one time at the Co level and at another at the CT level that we fail to recognize this distinction between Co level and CT level facts). The relations between theoretical and untheoretical facts (there is a reason for the "un"- see below) are roughly given by the so-called 'corres- pondence' rules of traditional Empiricism. These rules will be a lot more complicated than traditional Empiricism has traditionally allowed- see my 16. The position developed here, though sympathetic to a portion of empiricist belief, must be shown compatible with Scientific Realism, for this latter is, I believe, the only realistic philosophical position. Though I cannot give the argument in detail here (it is given in my 16) I can state the salient points. The first preparation for Realism was laid earlier with the rejection of the doctrine of the given and of any indu- bitable foundation for epistemology. It follows that all claims, in parti- cular the simple observational claims made in terms of Co concepts, are open to criticism and revision. Such criticism will be directed by our theories as well as by other experience. If we also allow that, at least in principle, the theoretical terms can achieve an observational role (i.e. can enrich and correct and/or displace our simple obser- vational concepts) then the foundation for Realism is complete. Whether this is possible in fact, and what its connections are to the various levels of observational report I must have for discussion elsewhere (cf. 16); suffice it to say that our ability to train scientists so as to respond to situations with reports formulated in Cj concepts means that there is at 72</page><page sequence="15">Empiricism, Perception, Conceptual Change least a core of truth in Feyerabend's doctrine of the pragmatic choice of observational terms. It is now time to develop the view that, while the Co level may be untheoretical, it is not without its theory-laden dimension. Once again the springboard for the doctrine is the doctrine of perception de- veloped earlier. Recall again that a central tenet of that doctrine was that for the perceptual process to be carried to completion the cortex must be capable of some appropriate kind of processing of the incoming pattern of physical stimulation. Moreover, it is not hard to show that under the appropriate circumstances, there are a variety of variants on the basic perceptual processing technique open to the cortex and that it sifts through these to find the one appropriate to the situation, i.e. that particular process leading to further successful action in the situation.13 At the most general level, of course, the perceptual processing tech- nique which brains employ is never given any occasion to alter. We see the world in terms of three-dimensional objects located in space and time. We even perceive the world in Euclidean terms under almost all circumstances, even though our natural perceptual space is not Euclid- ean but a complex Riemannian curved space (because, of course, the camera-eye embodies a complex, non-linear projection of the scene before it). Of course, one supposes that much of this basic processing technique is inherited, though much also seems to be learned. Precisely where the division lies is still a matter of considerable controversy. But there seems every reason to believe that the entire technique we have developed, doubtless over a very long period, is essentially in response to the environment and is, therefore, at least in principle, as flexible as we find its sub-variants to be even today. The cortex, then, has a fundamental structure which determines the ways in which the incoming physical stimuli are sorted, transformed and so on in the perceptual process. And according to our view of what it is to possess a concept this means that we possess a fundamental conceptual scheme the concepts of which are active in perceptual pro- cessing (i.e. the cortical structures which are implied by the possession of those concepts are part of the determining perceptual process), and which determines, therefore, the content of our perceptual experience. Now the possession of such a cortical structure (of such a conceptual scheme) precludes the possession of other cortical structures (of other conceptual schemes), and thus represents a commitment on our part (albeit neither voluntary nor conscious) to certain ways of understanding the world. It seems reasonable, therefore, to say that in this sense the possession of a coherent perceptual experience at all implies a com- mitment on our part to a certain theory-like approach to the world- it is a commitment on our part to organize and understand the inter- actions of the world with us in a certain way rather than others. In this sense even the Co level has a theory-like commitment. It is not, however, a commitment which can, as a matter of empirical fact, be affected by theoretical change in science - it can be affected only by a radical neurophysiological change (and perhaps by a radical change in our environment, but then only over the course of many generations). 73</page><page sequence="16">C A. Hooker Insofar as we find the same kind of cortical structures throughout, mankind shares this same theory-like commitment in common. Insofar as we could have found, or may possibly yet find, heriditary and/or fundamental environmental differences which are capable of issuing in fundamental differences in the perceptual processing technique then one would not expect all mankind to agree upon this theorylike com- mitment. In a sense which I shall not attempt to explore in this paper, whether or not there is this variation within the human race seems to be a matter of empirical investigation.20 I believe that it is impossible to have any kind of coherent experience (in a sense to have any kind of recognizable experience at all) without approaching the world with some kind of interpretative apparatus in hand. To this extend I am fundamentally on Feyerabend's side. But to the extent that Feyerabend refuses to distinguish between the culture- wide or even species-wide common core of perceptual experience which we do have and which is the reasonable (if misunderstood) core of Empiricism on the one side and the development of specific theories of science and their theoretical descriptions of observational situations on the other, and to the extent that Feyerabend simply misplaces the active role of theory in perception, I am a dissenter from his doctrine. The view presented here does, however, attempt to reconcile the reasonable core of Empiricism with the reasonable core of Feyerabend's critique of rigid Empiricism. I believe it succeeds. August 1971 20 I remind the reader that we have distinguished between the Colanguage and natural language. According to the view developed here natural language will have two kinds of theoretical commitment. It will have the dimension of theorylike commitment in- trinsic to the Colanguage and in addition whatever specific theoretical commitment is built into the language. 74</page><page sequence="17">Empiricism, Perception, Conceptual Change BIBLIOGRAPHY 1.
