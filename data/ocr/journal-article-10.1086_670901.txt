      <p>The time has come to disentangle, in the “controversial legacy” of Konrad Lorenz, the challenges for a “philosophy of ethology” involved in “unraveling the major forms of conceptual mystification and social exploitation to which both genetic determinisms and traditional environmentalisms have fallen prey” (p. 38). Each of the four chapters of <italic>Konrad Lorenz e l'etologia contemporanea: L'eredità problematica di uno scienziato inattuale</italic> is devoted to an aspect of Lorenz's work, introduced by a brief historical reconstruction and widened into a discussion of its later influence.</p>
      <p>The first chapter spans from “Darwinian” to “ethological” revolution, emphasizing the fundamental continuity of both in the naturalization of mind and behavior and in the emancipation of scientific discourse from teleology and anthropomorphism, although most attention is devoted to the controversial sociopolitical implications of Darwinism. Lorenz's ethological revolution comes in two parts: comparative ethology, starting in the 1930s, later expanded together with Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt to human ethology; and the program of a natural history of knowledge, active from the 1940s up to the making, together with Donald Campbell and Karl Popper in the 1970s, of evolutionary epistemology.</p>
      <p>The focus of the second chapter is genetic determinism. Lorenz eased the strictness of his original view of innateness in the confrontation with British ethology, developing his theory of the “innate teaching mechanisms,” but he resisted the dissolution of the dualism between innate and acquired “into a continuous spectrum.” His controversial book <italic>On Aggression</italic> appeared in the 1960s under the banner of innateness, and Eibl-Eibesfeldt's later <italic>Human Ethology</italic> (1989) diagnosed a pathologization of originally conservative aggressive behavior in the perturbing context of contemporary society. No genealogical link can be established, however, between Lorenz and sociobiology, as the latter is incompatible with Lorenz's commitment to an active conception of the organism and to the evolutionary role of exploratory behavior as prior to genetic mutation.</p>
      <p>Evolutionary epistemology is dealt with in the third chapter. Marco Celentano begins in the early 1940s, with Lorenz's naturalization of the Kantian <italic>a priori</italic>, then moves on to the “Russian Manuscript” of the mid 1940s. This paved the way for a genealogical, no longer biologistic, natural science of man, which would be accomplished in the 1970s, at the time of his convergence with Campbell and Popper. A particular emphasis is laid, however, on the distance between Popper's dualism and Lorenz's monism (the issue of inductivism is not considered) and on the still deeper divergence in their political approaches. Popper's almost “Leibnizian” progressivist optimism contrasts with Lorenz's critical approach to contemporary society and its developmental model.</p>
      <p>The development of evolutionary epistemology in the Altenberger Kreis, which eventually brought about the founding of the Konrad Lorenz Institute in the 1990s, is marked by the attempt to reconcile adaptation and auto-organization. This “constructivist” shift would be enhanced in the late 1990s, leading to the new pluralistic reformulation of the evolutionary epistemology program, whose latest manifesto is Werner Callebaut's 2006 call for an epistemology of “integration.” Celantano is sympathetic to Rupert Riedl's program for a “second Enlightenment,” which opposes a conception of science and society based on the subjugation of nature and the manipulation of minds, although it still misses the millenary historical process of “the abasement of human minds and bodies” (p. 84).</p>
      <p>The last chapter, “Lorenz and Modern Civilization,” looks at the evolution of his “critical theory of society” since the 1970s. In Celantano's view, Lorenz's “diagnosis” of modern technocratic society, undermined by biologistic remnants and by the same imagery of genetic deterioration that he held at the time of his involvement with Nazi ideology, lags behind his “prognosis” (p. 120). His critical analysis of social conditioning and media manipulation of typically human cognitive and social mechanisms is still valuable for the ethical task Celantano ascribes to a new philosophy of ethology. The book also provides a useful bibliography of Lorenz's writings and their Italian translations.</p>
