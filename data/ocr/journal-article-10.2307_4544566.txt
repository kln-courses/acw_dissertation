IN this paper I propose to examine first the notion of recognition of a thing as being of a certain kind and then, more briefly, the notion of recognition of an individual. A typical case of what I mean by recognition of a thing as being of a certain kind would be the recognition of something in the next field as a hare; a typical case of what I mean by recognition of an individual would be the recognition of a man as my old school-friend Smith or of a place as where we had lunch on Easter Monday. I do not discuss the general logical character of the verb " to recognize "; I shall spend no time issuing warnings against dangerous talk of the " process " or " activity " of recognition. I would merely, as a preliminary, draw attention to one point. We may speak of recognition as of a datable event; e.g., I may have recognized the object in the next field as a hare five seconds ago; here to recognize is to identify. But we may also say that in a well-known city we recognize nearly everything we see whenever we walk the streets; to recognize in this sense I must be able to identify things, but do not spend my time constantly doing so. I shall throughout be discussing datable recogni- tion unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. 1. Recognition of things as of a certain kind. Throughout section 1, recognition of a thing as of a certain kind will be meant whenever the word " recognize" or its cognates occur. (a) Recognition and Identification All recognition is identification; if, for example, I recognize an object as a hare I identify it as a hare. But, as will be shown immediately, not all identification is 2 B</page><page sequence="2">.260 J. 0. URMSON. recognition. My object in this sub-section is to set out the criteria that an identification must fulfil if it is to count as a case of recognition. (i) I may come to know of what sort something observed is without myself succeeding in identifying it, and, afortiori, without myself recognizing it. Example.-I find a wild flower that is absolutely strange to me; I do not recognize it. I take it home and look it up in the reference books in vain; I fail to identify it. Then a botanist tells me that it is gentiana amarella; he identi- fies it for me. (ii) If I identify something by evidence obtained subsequently to observation I have not recognized it. Examples.-I see a strange wild flower. I take a specimen home and find from the reference books that it is gentiana amarella. I have now identified it, but it would be absurd to say that I have now recognized it. Perhaps I shall recognize this sort of plant in the future. I have a sample of a white granular substance. I do not recognize it. I dare not taste it. By chemical analysis I identify it as, show it to be, common salt. But I do not recognize it as common salt by chemical analysis. (iii) Identification at the time of observation may be by look, or taste, or smell, or feel, or sound, or signs and symptoms, or accent (persons), and so on. If the look, taste, smell, etc., is a characteristic feature of the sort of thing in question, whether it be a defining property or not, the identification is a case of recognition. If the look, taste, etc., is not a characteristic feature of the sort of thing in question the identification is not a case of recognition. Identification by methods other than by characteristic features, such as by testimony or by circumstantial evidence, even if made at the time of observation, does not count as recognition. As my lists are (inevitably) incomplete and the expression " characteristic feature " is (inevitably) vague, this poinl will be more liberally illustrated by examples than the first two were.</page><page sequence="3">RECOGNITION. 261 Examples.-I may identify a plant in the garden as a delphinium. If the look is that of a tall spike of flowers, etc., then I have recognized it by its look, since this look is a characteristic feature of delphiniums. But if I have been told that the delphiniums are wilting and subsequently identify the plant as a delphinium by its wilted look it is not a case of recognition; for a wilted look is not a charac- teristic feature of delphiniums. I may recognize a car as a Rover by its look. In particular I may recognize a new model by the characteristic shield on the radiator which contains the word " Rover " as part of the design. But if I identify the car as a Rover by reading the word " Rover" on the shield, without realising that it is always written on Rover cars in that particular way, it does not count as recognition; I might just as well have read the word " Rover " on a notice stuck up by the car. This shows the difference between recognition by a word treated as a piece of decoration that is charac- teristic and identification by written testimony. I may know from past observation of my piano that the middle C, and only the middle C, has a tinny sound. If you now play the note on my piano, I can recognize it as an example of middle C on my piano by the tinny sound which is a characteristic feature of the middle C on my piano. But it would be dishonest pretence to have absolute pitch on my part if I were to claim to recognize the note as an example of middle C; it is not a characteristic feature of middle C to sound tinny. However I have certainly identified the note as a middle C, by recognizing it as a middle C on my piano. Further, if I identify the note you produce by observing which key you depress, it does not count as recognition of the note; to strike a certain key is one reliable way to produce a middle C, but this way of producing the note is not a feature of it. I may recognize a person's illness as a case of measles by the characteristic signs and symptoms; we regard the spots as a feature of the disease. But though a reading on a thermometer of under 32 degrees Fahrenheit is a reliable sign that the weather is frosty, it would be odd to say that 2 B 2</page><page sequence="4">262 J. o. URMSON. one recognized the weather to be frosty by the thermometer reading. Unlike the measles spots, the thermometer reading is regarded as too external a thing to be a feature of the weather. I may of course recognize frosty weather by the feel of the air or the look of the grass. Hoary grass blades are a feature of frosty weather. (iv) A characteristic feature of a kind need not be an invariable feature of that kind. Thus I may recognize a Rover car from its shape in spite of the fact that post-1949 Rover cars are of a different shape from earlier models. (v) The extent to which a characteristic feature must be peculiar to a kind to be used for recognizing that kind cannot be precisely determined. It would be absurd to claim to recognize a rabbit as such by its having four legs; in less extravagant cases it will be a moot point whether we count a correct identification as recognition or a lucky guess. The problem is not very important because we normally use a complex of characteristics for recognition, none of which on its own need be peculiar to the kind; or a characteristic which is not peculiar may now and in these circumstances be a reasonably reliable basis for a claim to recognition. The extent to which recognition is regarded as certain, reliable and secure will largely depend on how nearly peculiar the characteristic feature relied on is. It is clear that there are marginal cases in which it is possible, but not obvious, that an identification should count as recognition. There are no hard and fast criteria of characteristic features. An expert may recognize a painting as of a certain old masterbythe brushwork; butifheidentifies it as ofthat old master by the way, peculiar to his paint and varnish, that the pigment and varnish have cracked, it is marginal whether we should say that the expert has recognised the painting as an example of the master. There are obvious reasons for and against counting these clues as characteristic features of the master's paintings. We may roughly summarise these results by saying that for a case of identification to count as recognition it must be by some feature, rather than external clue; the feature must</page><page sequence="5">RECOGNITION. 263 be characteristic of the sort of thing; the feature must be accessible to observation rather than discoverable by research or experiment. (b) Recognition and language. I commence this sub-section with two quotations: " Unless I did know what it makes sense to say, unless I were used to talking about colours and to understanding people when they did, then I should not know what red is and I should not know red when I see it." (R. Rhees, Sup. Vol. XXVIII, p. 80.) " Primary recognition may be pre-verbal or non- verbal (indeed secondary recognition may be pre- verbal too). It occurs before we have learned to use words." (H. H. Price, Thinking and Experience, p. 76.) Though these two statements are not technically contra- dictories it is clear that we have here a thorny question. I propose to start this investigation by making out the case for saying that it is not possible to recognize something as being an X unless one understands the word " X " or a synonym of " X ". This is at best an extravagant view, but it will be convenient to start from it. It is often said, with justice, that while it is a matter of convention that we use the word " rose " as we do it is not conventional or arbitrary what things are called roses, given its arbitrarily established use. But there is a danger of our confusing this truth with the following falsehood: it is convention, or arbitrary, that we use the word " rose " as the name of roses, rather than some other word, and that we do not use the word " rose " as the name of some other kind of thing, perhaps butterflies, but that all else in our use of the word " rose " is non-arbitrary, non- conventional. This is a falsehood because there is something else that is logically arbitrary or conventional about our use of the word " rose "; it is logically arbitrary that the word " rose ", or any other word, is the name of all that we count in fact as roses and of nothing else. Not only might we have called lilies " roses " and roses " lilies ", or had two quite different words for roses and lilies; we might</page><page sequence="6">264 J. o. URMSON. have had no words with the meanings that "rose" and " lily " in fact have, but have had a word which was the name of some roses and some lilies and another word which was the name of the remainder of both. This last example is certainly scientifically absurd. But let us take the case of chairs and sofas. Armchairs and upright chairs are species of chair; they are both chairs and not sofas. But it would be quite natural, as well as logically feasible, to include armchairs and sofas under one name, perhaps " sofa ", and to restrict the use of the word " chair" to such as are not armchairs. There would then be no words functioning as "chair" and "sofa" now do. Mild cases of this sort occur whenever there is a re- classification in biology. But if this is correct, then learning the meaning of " rose or " cat " is not simply learning to what class, already given as such, the noise is conventionally applied, but is also learning how to determine a class. The class of roses (cats) is determined by the usage we establish for the word " rose " (" cat "). To say this is only to make, rather elaborately, the point that there are no logically natural kinds; and if there are no natural kinds it is logically arbitrary whether two things are of the same kind. But to be able to recognize something as a rose or a cat I must be able to determine which things belong to the class of roses or cats. If the preceding argument is correct it follows that I cannot recognize something as a rose or cat, or as of any other kind, unless I know the logically arbitrary rules defining the class in question; and itwould seem that the rules defining a class are learnt by learning the correct use of the word or phrase that names that class. If this is so it appears that we have established the contention that one cannot recognize something as an X unless one understands either the word " X " or a synonym of " X ". But one misconception must be guarded against. Since a characteristic feature by which we recognize something as an X may not be a defining property of X's, to recognize something as an X is not to determine that it may properly be called an X. For example, I suppose that the main,</page><page sequence="7">RECOGNITION. 265 perhaps the only, defining property of a Rover car is that it should be a car assembled by the Rover company. Certainly it is not a defining property of a Rover to have the characteristic look by which I recognize it. I simply know that Rover cars do have this characteristic look as a matter of fact. But I could not have found that Rover cars do have this characteristic look unless I knew how to determine what things are Rover cars. Thus to recognize something as an X rather presupposes an ability to use the word " X " correctly than is a direct exercise of that ability. This concludes my statement of the case for the con- tention that to recognize something as an X one must understand the word " X ". I believe that this contention is essentially correct, though I have deliberately overstated it. I shall first examine an objection to it which seems to me wholly without substance, and then modify it in the light of other difficulties of a kind that will help us to understand the nature of recognition better. I deal first with a common but baseless objection. It will be said that if a number of things are of the same kind they will instantiate a common (and probably complex) universal; it will also be said that whether a thing does or does not instantiate a certain universal is determined by the nature of things and is in no way dependent on human convention. I deplore this language; but I am prepared to accept these statements as true (with reservations and qualifications which are not immediately relevant and which might well be accepted by those who hold this view). It will now be said that given these admitted points it follows that recognition may be pre-verbal. For to recognize something as of kind X is to recognize it as an instance of the universal X-ness, which I might do either by observing that it has the character X-ness directly, or by observing it to have a feature, perhaps a look, that I have found to be a reliable sign of the presence of X-ness. But whether it instantiates X-ness is not a matter of con- vention, nor is convention required for me to have observed X-ness in other things previously, remember doing so,</page><page sequence="8">266 J. o. URMSON. and thus tell that the thing is of the same kind as those other things. Whether we have the word " X " depends mainly on whether the universal X-ness is of sufficient interest for us to wish to talk about it. But X's instantiate X-ness whether or not we bother to give it a name. This argument is essentially confused. To say that if a number of things are of the same kind they will instantiate a common (probably complex) universal, which I have admitted, is tantamount to saying that if a number of things belong to the same class they will all fall under some single principle (probably complex) of classification; similarly the agreed statement that whether or not something instantiates a universal is not a matter of convention is tantamount to saying that whether something does or does not fall under some given principle of classification is not a matter of convention. But to say that a set of things forms a class (or part of a class) according to some principle of classifica- tion is ambiguous, and so therefore is the statement that they instantiate a common universal. We might mean that the things form a class according to some established principle of classification or that they would do so if we employed some possible principle of classification. Now in order that I should recognize something as of the same kind as some others, let alone that I should recognize it as of a certain kind, it is not enough that I should have correctly observed that it falls with them under some possible principle of classification. The notion of things, being of the same kind is narrower by far than that of their merely having some feature in common. Thus if to say that two things are of the same kind were merely to say that it is theoretically possible to find some principle according to which they could be classified together, some universal or other under which they both fall, we could never be mistaken when we say that two things are of the same kind; for there is always some universal, some principle of classification, to be found under which they both fall. This is absurd. Or again, if to say that two things are of the same kind were to say that they both fall under some one noticed universal, while it would be possible</page><page sequence="9">RECOGNITION. 267 to mis-classify by faulty observation, and perhaps in some other ways, all judgments that two things were of the same kind based on correct observation of a similarity or common feature would be indifferently and equally correct. But then there could be no incorrect way of classifying things, but only success or failure in following some way or other; while I contend that classification is logically arbitrary I am not prepared to accept this radical view. One way that faulty recognition can arise is precisely from thinking that the correct observation of certain similarities is sufficient for saying that two things are of the same kind when it is not sufficient. A child, for example, may think that the observable features of a hare justify him in taking it to be of the same kind of animal as a rabbit; but they do not. The situation becomes still more acute if we take the case of a thing being of a certain kind instead of that of two things being of the same kind, though there is no difference of principle. Exactly what properties a thing must possess to be, say, a cat is clearly logically arbitrary; our principles of zoological classification might put an emphasis on tails and exclude Manx cats from the species. It is no use to say that each may decide for himself what simple ideas will comprise his complex idea of a cat in a world in which we successfully use the word " cat " for communication. One is tempted to say that it is a standing miracle that Price (Thinking and Experience, p. 37) and others who claim pre-verbal recognition of cats do not have to revise their whole set of concepts when they come to learn.language. But this would be to put the point badly; it is so easy to learn the use of the word " cat " precisely because it is so natural, though logically conventional, to classify cats together from among familiar objects. But if it is natural to follow a certain rule, the rule may be none the less logically arbitrary, and unless we are following a rule we are not classifying. Would people so readily claim pre-verbal recognition of, say, ammeters ? I conclude, then, that noticing a similarity between a set of things, though it is to notice a possible principle of classification, is not to recognize a kind. There are far</page><page sequence="10">268 J. 0. URMSON. fewer kinds than there are noticeable similarities. We have a kind only when the possible principle of classification is used as such; among the host of observable similarities some are arbitrarily selected to be our principles of classification. If anyone claims to recognize -something as of a kind, not following an accepted principle, he mis-recognizes. It seems inevitable to regard these principles as enshrined in our linguistic usage, especially of common nouns that are names of kinds. I now turn to some other difficulties in the thesis that to recognize something as an X, I must understand the word or a synonym. Difficulty 1.-It is obviously an exaggeration to say that to recognize a kind I must know the class name; someone who was able to recognize cats could teach me to do so without teaching me the word " cat" or a synonym; I might refer to them as things of the same kind as the little animal that lives next door. More generally, someone who knows the rules of classification enshrined in language can teach me to follow these rules without teaching me the relevant pieces of language. This objection is obviously both correct and of minor importance. Difficulty 2.-A naturalist in the South American jungle may see a queer beast that belongs to no species with which he is acquainted by experience or description. May he not half an hour later recognize another beast to be of the same kind? But he neither knows the name of them nor has been taught the logically arbitrary rules enshrined in the correct use of the name. We must certainly admit that the naturalist may be correctly said to recognize the second beast as of the same kind, which compels us to modify again our original linguistic thesis. But it is important to see that the required modification is slight; certainly we must not conclude that here we have a case of pre-verbal recognition. It is only possible for the naturalist to claim recognition because he has a wide experience of the language of zoological classification; he knows the principles on which names are given, what sort of criteria are used for classifying</page><page sequence="11">RECOGNITION. 269 beasts of this type. He will also need experience of what sorts of characteristic are or are not constant in various general types of fauna (he would not readily claim recognition of butterflies, as of the same kind, from the colour). In a sentence, he can recognize that two unfamiliar animals are of the same kind because of wide experience of the principles of classification in the sphere in question. Even so his claim to recognition will be hazardous and, if he is wise, tentative. Here then we have a case of recognition based not on an understanding of the relevant classificatory apparatus but on an informed extrapolation to it from known classificatory principles. It is worth while to contrast the case of a person presented with a wide variety of unfamiliar things, for example a non-technologist presented with many unfamiliar tools; he would not be able to recognize which were of the same kind. He might guess a few cases correctly from absolute similarity of appearance-relying on his knowledge of a very general principle of classification; but this would be hazardous guessing, not recognition. Someone might thus claim to recognize a cabbage seedling as of the same kind as a brussels sprout seedling. But it would be hard to find someone who did not know that tools are not called by different names according to the grade of steel used, etc.; to the extent that he has this knowledge he begins to approach the case of the naturalist. Difficulty 3.-But it may be said that animals can recognize things to be of a kind, and they at least cannot do so on the basis of language; their recognition at least must be pre-verbal. Now in the sequel I am going to admit that it might in some circumstances be proper to say that an animal can recognize a thing to be of a certain kind; but I wish first to say that most such claims are probably false. It is important that this should be shown since otherwise we are tempted to say that since these are cases of recognition, and all that the animal can do is so and so, recognition only involves so and so. Let us take first the claim that cats can recognize a dog as a dog, or a pheasant recognize a blackberry bush. Now it is beyond doubt that</page><page sequence="12">270 J. o. URMSON. a cat reacts in much the same way to more or less all dogs; we are all too familiar with the relevant phenomena for detailed exegesis to be necessary. It is true to say that British cats react to dogs in a way in which they react to nothing else. But what if wolves, jackals, hyenas and the like roamed our streets? Would not the behaviour of cats in regard to most of these be the same as it is to dogs? In so far as behaviour differed there would more likely be a similarity between behaviour towards wolves and bull- terriers than towards bull-terriers and lap dogs. If cats, without training, were to react to all dogs differently from the way they reacted to everything else, in such a way that it could not be regarded as appropriately different reaction to different situations, I should not know what to say; as I should not know what to say if a baby was born that used the word " north " correctly from its first hour. But let us leave the anthropomorphism in which we indulge from time to time to deal with a more serious case. In The Physical Background of Perception (p. 85) Adrian says: " A rat, or a man for that matter, can be trained to recognize triangles or triangularity. After learning that it will be rewarded with food if it jumps towards a white card with a black triangle on it, it will adopt a hopeful attitude to a white triangle on a black ground and will jump towards it rather than towards a square or a circle, and the triangle may be large or small, filled in or in outline, with apex pointing upwards or downwards. The rat seems able to differentiate the figure, so that the three angles are now the only features of it that matter and the absolute size and the position on the retina do not." Rhees, on the contrary, says (op. cit.): " A bull may charge at a red flag, and rats may be trained to react in one way to red lights and in another way to blue lights, but neither the bull nor rat knows what red is and neither knows that this is red." We could no doubt insist on talking in Rhees's way, and speak only of the reactions of rats. But it seems to me that Adrian's terminology here is perfectly proper and at least as good as that of Rhees, while his physiology is presumably better. Rhees's way of dealing</page><page sequence="13">RECOGNITION 271 with Adrian's talk of rats recognizing triangles would be too short. It seems to me that Adrian is following a good linguistic practice in speaking of rats being trained to recognize triangles and not speaking of them as naturally recognizing obstacles or fire (or of cats naturally recognizing dogs). It would be quaint to say that a rat naturally recognizes an obstacle as an obstacle; it can discriminate what we call obstacles and act appropriately. Again, if Adrian had been content to work only with black outline triangles on a white ground it would be absurd to say that the rat had learnt to recognize a black outline triangle on a white ground; once again the rat discriminates and reacts appropriately after conditioning as it reacts appropriately to obstacles naturally. The basis for Adrian's claim is that his evidence seems to show that the rat has learnt to follow a logically arbitrary rule, a contention which one may or may not find empirically surprising but not logically absurd. Adrian, whether right or mistaken, can properly claim that the rat has learnt to recognize a triangle, because the rat seems to follow a logically arbitrary rule which Adrian himself, from his knowledge of the linguistic rules for the use of the word " triangle ", can also follow. Ultimately the teaching of the rat to recognize a triangle must stem from a knowledge of the linguistic rules for the use of the word " triangle " and our claim (which the rat itself cannot make) that it does so recognize triangles can only be justified by reference to such rules. Thus we must agree that recognition of a kind is possible without learning the relevant portions of language, and even possible for an animal that can never learn to speak; recognition then may be non-verbal and, in a sense, pre- verbal. But the possibility of recognition still depends ultimately on language; it is simply that we may be trained to follow the rules constituted by linguistic use without learning the language. Normally in human beings the training incorporates the learning of the language itself. If we wish to say that recognition as it occurs in brutes is recognition in an extended or derivative sense, well and</page><page sequence="14">272 J. 0. URMSON. good; but it can be recognition. But that recognition can be pre-verbal in the sense of being independent of the logic of language we have not admitted and must not admit. I conclude that the statement that to recognize something as an X requires an understanding of the word " X" or a synonym is a rather drastic overstatement of a basically sound position. (c) Recognition by features and recognition offeatures. We have been examining recognition of things as of a certain kind by characteristic features such as look, sound, smell, signs and symptoms. This is, I think, essentially what Price would count as secondary recognition in his discussion in Chapter II of his Thinking and Experience. My debt to Price's discussion throughout this whole paper is great; but I have had occasion to differ from him already on some points, and I must do so to some extent again. I find his account of secondary recognition misleading. He says of it that it may be " roughly " characterised as inferential or mediate. But clearly realising that we do not explicitly infer from a thing's characteristic features to its being the sort of thing it is, he says: " Perhaps the best way to put it is this: secondary recognition is recognition by means of signs. The noticed characteristics are taken as signs of others which are not at the moment noticed." But recogni- tion by signs, as we have seen, is in fact only one among the ways in which one may recognize something. One may recognize measles by its characteristic signs, for example; but, first, cases of identification by signs when the signs are not characteristic features do not count as being recognition, as one cannot recognize frosty weather by a thermometer reading; secondly, recognition by signs which are characteristic features is but one way of recognizing alongside recognition by look, taste, smell, etc. It is an abuse of language to subsume these other cases under recognition by signs; the characteristic appearance of a monkey, for example, is not a sign of a monkey. I say no more on this point since it is dealt with in Austin's " Other Minds ", Logic and Language, volume II, page 148 ff., where</page><page sequence="15">RECOGNITION. 273 the dangers of this way of speaking are adequately brought out.' If we recognize kinds of things by characteristic features, we are clearly led to raise the question what sort of identification of these features is necessary for us thus to recognize kinds by them. In discussing this question I shall be discussing what Price calls primary recognition; but rather than offer an explicit criticism of his view I shall merely present my own positive account of the matter. I clearly may recognize a shape as that of a house, or a symptom as one of those of measles, etc. No doubt, in general, if I can recognize an X by characteristic feature , I must be able to recognize f as the characteristic look, taste, smell, or what you will of an X. But there are other ways in which we may recognize a feature apart from recognizing it as characteristic of the kind X. I may be properly said to recognize a colour as that of the gentian; but equally properly I may say that I recognize a colour (perhaps of a hat) as gentian blue (or green, or red), or I may recognize it as the colour of our dining room curtains. Similarly I may recognize a sound as that of an oboe, as a C natural, or as the same as I heard yesterday. We may recognize a feature in at least these three ways, as characteristic of a kind, as being itself of a kind independent of any kind of thing, or as being a feature of some individual thing. The question that I now wish to raise is whether we need to recognize a feature in any way other than as characteristic of an X when we recognize a kind by it. That this at least is necessary is obvious; it is the reverse of the same coin. I think that some would wish to say that we must be able to recognize the feature in some other way than as the characteristic. feature of the sort of thing in question if we are to recognize the sort by it; to me this seems false. I shall try briefly to show that it is false, but greater attention to what is involved in I The whole article is useful for the light it throws on recognition. But Austin's statement " ' Knowing him to be jack' means that I have recognized him as Jack " is clearly false. There are, as I have laboured to show, ways of coming to know him to be Jack that cannot count as recognition.</page><page sequence="16">274 J. 0. URMSON. recognizing, e.g., a colour as blue, would be needed in a finally satisfactory discussion. I may recognize a flower partly by its colour (and recognize the colour as of that flower); let us suppose that the colour is in fact mauve. But I may not know that the colour is called mauve; I may myself stupidly consider it to be a shade of blue, or I may never have considered the question of what colour it is. All that is necessary for me to recognize the flower by its colour is that I should be able to identify the flower (perhaps by verbal instruction), be able perceptually to discriminate that colour (not be colour blind, for example), and discover by observation that this colour is sufficiently peculiar to the kind of flower to count as a characteristic feature, and then be able to recognize it as the colour of that sort of flower. I need form no other concept of the colour than as of that flower. Similarly I may recognize the oboe by its sound without having classified the sound as slightly acid and reedy or in any other way. I give one more example. All but the tone deaf may be able to recognize a certain tune. A tune is a succession of sounds at certain intervals, in a certain order, in a certain rhythm, and perhaps within a certain range of tempi. Some tunes can be recognized by only a selection of these features, perhaps by the rhythm alone, or by characteristic intervals even when the rhythm is not given. Now a musician may recognize the rhythm as perhaps dotted crotchets and quavers in common time, or the intervals as a second followed by a third followed by etc. But only the comparatively musical have either the gift or the technical equipment of concepts to do this. Most of us have to be content with recognizing the rhythm as that of the tune and so on. This example seems worth producing as a case where not only is any other sort of recognition of the features unnecessary for recognition of the thing, but also recognition of the features as of a kind is, for most people, impossible. One final example; Adrian assured us that rats could recognize a triangle, so that the three angles are the only</page><page sequence="17">RECOGNITION. 275 feature of it that matters. But Adrian does not claim that rats can recognize angles; I imagine that rats would have to undergo a new and stiff course of training for them to achieve that. I conclude therefore that recognition of features independent of recognition of kinds of things is unnecessary for recognition of things as being of a certain kind. But I do not deny that there are other sorts of recognition of features and that they are well worth investigating. One final point on recognition of features. If asked how I recognize a kind of thing I may answer " by its look " or " by its colour " or " by its sound ". What if I am asked how I recognize the colour or sound? It seems that no answer of the same kind may be available; I do not for example know how to answer the question how I recognize the smell of kippers as the smell of kippers, though I can say how I came to be able to recognize it. That the question should be inappropriate is, I take it, at least part of the point of Price's calling primary recognition " in- tuitive " or "immediate ". But it is worth noting that there may be an answer. I may recognize an oboe as such; if asked how, I answer that I do so by its sound. If asked how I recognize its sound I may now answer that I do so by its characteristic reedy and slightly acid quality. If asked how I recognize the quality to be acid and reedy I should be inclined to say that this is not a case of recognition -that is how I would describe the quality. As already pointed out, I do not have to recognize the quality except as characteristic of the sound of oboes. If I were asked how I recognized it as such I could give no answer. In a sentence, it is worth noting that features as well as things can be recognized by characteristic features. But I suspect that Price is correct in holding that we can always be driven back to a stage at which there is no answer to the question " How?" (d) Recognition and having the concept. Price says: " Whatever else a concept may be, to possess a concept is at least to have the capacity of recognizing 2 c</page><page sequence="18">276 J. 0. URMSON. instances if and when they are observed." It will be useful to produce a variety of examples in refutation of this. Example 1.-I have the concept of middle C. I know its relation to other notes, have heard it often, etc. But, alas, I can recognize a sound as middle C only under special conditions, and the same is true even of many gifted musicians with a thorough knowledge of musical theory. Only people with absolute pitch are capable of recognizing a sound as middle C if and when they hear it. But having absolute pitch is surely not requisite for the possession of the concept of C natural. That is an example of lack of natural gift standing between possession of the concept and recognition. Example 2. -Most of us have the concept of " mate in four"; but we cannot recognize cases if and when we observe them. Phenomenal skill at chess would be required for that. Probably we can all of us recognize cases sometimes when we observe them. Example 3.-Let us take Price's own examples of the concepts of Inflation and of Revolution. Surely a man may have a good theoretical grasp of these concepts and know all the facts in a given situation which in fact make it revolutionary or inflationary, but fail to see the facts clear and whole from among accompanying complexities, and so fail to recognize the situation as inflationary or revolu- tionary. May he not later say " How did I fail to recognize it " rather than "I did not realize that that counted as such a situation"? It seems to me nearly incredible that Price should say of these two concepts: " Yet anyone who really does possess them must ipso facto be capable of recognizing an inflationary or a revolutionary situation if and when he encounters one." This is so incredible that Price perhaps only means that one will always have the theoretical, intellectual equipment for recognizing an instance of a concept that one possesses, though one may be incapable for other reasons. But even so it is not true that an essential part of having any concept is the theoretical, intellectual capacity to recognize instances;</page><page sequence="19">RECOGNITION. 277 for there are some concepts of which it is impossible to recognize instances, because things falling under the concept have no characteristic feature by which they are recognizable. Example 4.-One may recognize an expectant mother as such since expectant mothers have characteristic features. But what would it be to recognize a mother as such or, still better, a father as such? In view of the possibility of foster-parents, adoption, or uncles rearing orphaned nephews, there seems to be no way of identifying a father as such with reasonable certainty except by asking. There are other reasonably safe methods of identifying a man as a father (such as hearing a child call him " daddy "), but these sorts of identification cannot count as recognition. In general, though not invariably, things falling under relational concepts have no characteristic features by which to recognize them. There are also concepts instances of which can be identified only by methods of research too protracted and complicated for the identification to count as recognition. I conclude from our study of recognition that the most Price can claim is that anyone who possesses a concept must have the theoretical, intellectual, equipment to identify an instance if and when he observes one. Some would dispute even this on other grounds which are not our present concern-I take it that Kneale claims to have the concept of natural necessity without being able to identify instances. This is the end of my discussion of the recognition of things as being of a certain kind. 2. Recognition of individuals. On page 39 of Thinking and Experience Price says: "Recognition of individuals itself depends on recognition of characteristics. . . . To recognize an individual person or object, I must first recognize a characteristic characterising a present particular. But I must do more than this. I also remember an earlier particular- Jones-as-he-was-last- Wednesday-which was an instance of that same charac-</page><page sequence="20">278 J. 0. URMSON. teristic. And then, further, I believe, or unquestioningly take for granted, that there has been a spatio-temporally continuous series intervening between these two, in such a way that the whole series of particulars constitutes the history of one persisting individual." Waiving irrelevant qualms about series of particulars that constitute persisting individuals, I can recognize this account of Price's as an account of what may well take place. For example I may indeed first recognize a characteristic of a present particular as " hair-lip and cleft chin ". Next I say to myself that I saw a particular like thatW-hair-lip and cleft chin-last Wednesday. Then I say to myself "Why, it must be the same person." (Price would, of course, claim that it need not be a verbal matter, as I have made it.) This could happen; before we ask whether anything like this always happens when we recognize an individual let us look more closely at this account of the matter. First comes recognition of a characteristic; but we have seen that more than one thing can count as recognition of a charac- teristic. Ex hypothesi, this cannot be the sort of recognition which we exemplified earlier by recognizing a colour as the colour of the dining room curtains-that is more like Price's second stage. Nor is it recognition of a characteristic as a characteristic feature of a kind-recognizing a colour as the colour of gentians-for this has to be a characteristic which distinguishes an individual from others of the kind. It seems that it must be the sort of recognition of which recognizing a colour as blue or a taste as bitter are typical examples. Next comes remembering another particular similarly characterised, a memory that could be verbalized as " I saw something like this last Wednesday." Finally we believe that the two particulars go to constitute the same individual. I have said that we can recognize a person in this way; but surely it is a most unusual way. A very small child may recognize its mother as an individual (though not as a mother). It will be put off or deceived by no substitute. But I do not for a moment believe that its recognition</page><page sequence="21">RECOGNITION. 279 proceeds according to Price's analysis. No doubt a baby must be able to discriminate perceptually some of its mother's characteristics, no doubt it recognizes her by them in the sense that if she had no combination of characteristics unique in the baby's experience it would not recognize her, but this is far from saying that it first recognizes the characteristics. I believe a baby can recognize its mother at an age when it can recognize neither characteristics nor sorts of things. But it may be said that a baby's recognition of its mother is called recognition only by courtesy; it is not full recogni- tion. If that be said it is unnecessary for me to contest the issue, for the point can be illustrated, if not so conspicuously, from adult recognition of individuals. Though I am capable of recognizing many characteristics as of a kind-hair-lip, cleft chin and so on-I do not normally recognize people via a recognition of their characteristics as of a certain kind. I recognize most people by the general look of their faces without having any idea at all of what distinguishes their faces from others; I can recognize the look as the look of N's face, but would be at a loss to say how it differs from the look of countless other faces. Just as when I recognize a thing as of a kind by a characteristic feature I do not have to recognize the feature independently, though I must notice it and be able to recognize it as a feature of the kind of thing in question, so with recognition of individuals by characteristic features. Moreover it is surely not necessary to the recognition of an individual that one should remember an occasion on which one has seen a similarly characterised particular. When I recognize people whom I meet I could no doubt often call to mind an occasion on which we have previously met but usually I do not. It is not uncommon to find onself saying " I recognize him; when and where on earth can I have met him before? I have no recollection." But though it is often reasonable to suppose that one must have met a person whom one recognizes, it is certainly not necessary to recognition that one should have met him. One can well recognize a person from a description or from 2 D</page><page sequence="22">280 J. 0. URMSON. a photograph-as is shown by the sort of letter that is written by a stranger who is to meet one at the station- "You will be able to recognize me by the following . . It seems to me, precisely because the notion of kind, whether of thing or of characteristic, is not involved, that recognition of individuals is at least more nearly pre-verbal than is recognition either of kinds of things or of features; it is dependent on neither. If the example of the baby recognizing its mother be accepted, as I accept it, as a genuine case of recognition, then recognition of individuals must be accepted as completely pre-verbal on occasion. I have argued that to recognize as an X involves following logical rules determining what is an X; to recognize some- thing as an individual is certainly a sophisticated and difficult case of recognizing as an X and is not pre-verbal. But that does not prevent recognition of an individual from being pre-verbal. I have made no attempt to discuss exhaustively in this paper what Price calls primary recognition; that would be a serious gap in any discussion of recognition that claimed to be exhaustive. The problem is important and difficult. But I do claim to have shown that neither in the case of recognition of things as of a certain sort nor in the case of recognition of individuals is there any need to acknowledge that some logically independent recognition of characteristics is necessarily presupposed, or that recognition of charac- teristics is basic and fundamental to all recognition. Such a view seems to me akin to the Lockeian doctrine of simple and complex ideas, and this doctrine, with its apparent simplicity and inevitability, seems to me a major impediment to correct philosophy.</page></plain_text>
