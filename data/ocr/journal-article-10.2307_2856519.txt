Pp. xviii, 226; 190 black-and-white illustrations. $30. IN this imnportant book Professor Forsyth examines the history and function of Romanesque statues of the Virgin in Majesty, with special emphasis on developments in France. The subject is of many-sided interest. The best of these carvings rank with the outstanding works of the period. The earliest are also among the first statues in the round in Western art, following a general eclipse of plasticity in monumental sculpture after the fifth century. Their appearance, and in the course of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, ever more enthusiastic acceptance, must raise fundamental questions about the religious conscience of the early Middle Ages, at the level of both high theological speculation and popular piety, since the eastern and western traditions, whatever their differences, were united in an overwhelmingly negative disposition toward all but two-dimensional effigies of holy persons. The substance of the matter thus straddles the domain of art, ritual and belief. Nor is it exhausted by a consideration of the background surrounding the genesis of the statues and of the context which makes intelligible their style and purpose. Many, objects of devotion before they became historical artifacts, inspired a body of stories and customs designed to explain their appearance and illustrate their effects. The existing literature, much of it not directed to the critical reader, is apt to make an immodest display of this treasure of miracles, along with that effusion of sentiment which depictions of the Madonna so readily inspire in some souls. Since these statues have remained in use long after the end of the Romanesque period, some down to the present day, they have in many instances been repaired or remodelled to suit the taste of the times, or conversely, to emphasize whatever traits of archaism that might attest to an ancient origin. In this rehabilitative func- tion, modern restorers in the service of dealers have taken up the trail set out by their predecessors under clerical sponsorship. Given the perishable</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 109 nature of the materials involved, the fact that a relatively large number of statues of twelfth-century workmanship has survived at all is no doubt due to their continued ability to arouse a potent mixture of fascination and trust in their wonder-working power. The earliest statue of the Virgin of which there is some record is that made on commission of Bishop Stephen II (937-84) by the goldsmith Adelelmus for the cathedral of Clermont-Ferrand, probably not long after its dedication in 946. Like the somewhat later and still surviving statues of Essen (generally placed in the late years of the tenth century), Hildesheim (associated by tradition and arguments based on style with Bernward's tenure), and Paderborn (made for Bishop Imad, 1051-76), it was simul- taneously designed as a container for relics. This has led some authors to suggest that it was the presence of the sacred particles within the statue, offering to the faithful a kind of reconstitution of the body in its integral form, which provided the justification for the revival of free-standing an- thropomorphic images. In a well-considered discussion tending to show this theory in need of qualification, Professor Forsyth points to the existence, based on documentary sources, of monumental effigies of secular rulers in Carolingian times. These perforce did not incorporate any relics, but neither could they be regarded as cult objects with a claim to a place on the altar or in the sanctuary. The cutting edge of principle asserted by the prohibition against plastic images of the Virgin and of the saints, still well articulated by the scholasticus Bernard of Angers at the beginning of the eleventh century, lies closer to the category of monumental images of Christ on the cross, whose existence is also recorded as early as the Carolingian period. A recent study by R. Haussherr, cited by Professor Forsyth, has shown that less than half of the surviving Ottonian crucifixes, which may be regarded as follow- ing in the same tradition, are furnished with reliquary caches. This point, however, also has some limitations for the argument, since images of the crucified Christ were, as Bernard of Angers explicitly states, exempted from the general condemnation of depictions of sacred persons in the third dimension. When we come to the early sources concerning statues of the Virgin and of saints now lost, the presence of relics is often mentioned, and also occasionally translations, though sometimes altogether omitted. But given the imprecision of the documents, such an omission is not conclusive evidence that none were deposited in the work in question.' Thus, while the author, following the lead of H. Schrade and C. Beutler, amply succeeds in demonstrating that the renewal of sculpture in the round in late Carolingian times had roots in earlier practice independent of the cult of relics, the radical change in doctrinal orientation from rejection to benevolent toler- 1 As far as this reviewer can see, the only goldsmithwork statue specifically mentioned by Forsyth (p. 79) as having no provision for relics is the well-known bust of St. Baudime at Saint-Nectaire. Although, I am not in a position to positively assert the contrary, J. Taralon, Treasures of the Churches of Frqnce (London, 1966), p. 262, states that on the back of the work, which is hollow, "is a board fastened with pins, which could be removed to insert the relic."</page><page sequence="3">110 Reviews ance and even enthusiasm toward anthropomorphic statuary within the sphere of the cult retains for us a problematic quality that reflection upon antecedent developments does not fully dissipate. Among the specific antecedents of the seated Madonnas should be counted, as the author suggests, the statues of various pagan mother god- desses whose cult flourished in the provinces of the late Roman empire. How far forward in time a residue of these cults might have perpetuated itself in remote regions after the establishment of the new faith must inevitably be a matter of speculation. As late as the ninth century, however, there was still some official concern lest representations of the Virgin and Child be taken for Venus and Aeneas or similar groups in the pagan pantheon. This reviewer would expand this line of enquiry into the sources of other an- thropomorphic reliquary types, given the form of separate parts of the body, like the foot reliquary of St. Andrew in Trier and the somewhat later series of arm and head reliquaries, whose initial appearance and development may be said to parallel that of the seated Virgins in time. Is there a possible reminiscence here of the votive offerings consisting of heads, limbs or other corporal parts, in wood, stone and bronze, deposited at shrines reputed for their curative powers in the hope of obtaining relief from afflictions, which the upsurge in activity in the field of Gallo-Roman archeology of recent years has brought to light in considerable hoards? In contrast to these necessarily fragile conjectures, the treatment of the function of the statues is grounded in a very broad base of documentary reference. These sources range from those records designed to advertise the virtues of a particular statue, to literary compositions sometimes based on ancient topoi in which the statue comes to life to console a repentant sinner, accepts a ring from a flirtatious young man or weeps in response to insult. Summarizing her views published in an earlier article (Art Bulletin 50 [1968], 215-22), Professor Forsyth also suggests that the statues were employed in the performance of plays of the Nativity cycle. It is well known that in the rubrics of the pertinent manuscripts, an imago, to which a procession of clerics impersonating the Magi directed their homage, is sometimes specified. Although such a term may refer to a painting, relief or a statue, K. Young was of the opinion that a three-dimensional figure was probably involved, and it is more than reasonable that we should look to the carvings here studied as the possible objects designated in the texts. On the other hand, such a function can best be ascribed to statues from places of a certain size, where the divine service could be given some scope through the avail- ability of supernumerary clerics or pueri attached to the local school. Very partial though it may be, the provenance of the manuscripts - Nevers, Lambach (?), Rouen (a fourteenth-century text) - makes this clear, whereas the pattern of distribution of the statues extends to very small and isolated churches where it is unlikely that the liturgical drama was ever enacted. In relation to the group of statues from the pioneering era of the tenth and eleventh centuries, sixteen in number, according to Professor Forsyth's</page><page sequence="4">Reviews 111 painstaking tabulation, the images of the twelfth century present two significant innovations. First, the presence of relics seems to become more of an occasional rather than a necessary complement to the work. Secondly, the wooden core is no longer, in obligatory fashion, sheathed in a revetment of precious metal. Instead it is conceived as a self-standing entity in its own right, manifesting at its full worth the expressive articulation of the material and the brilliant effect of polychromed surfaces. To these developments should be added the appearance of identifiable regional styles and icono- graphic types, perhaps reflecting the demand for copies of outstanding images now lost, like those of Chartres or Le Puy, and even of individual masters, as is suggested by the author. So far as France is concerned, the largest and most cohesive group of images stems from Auvergne. Many were first made known by the late L. Brehier, an indefatigable student of the monuments of the region, but it is fair to say that Professor Forsyth's more comprehensive and penetrating treatment of the subject should remain unsurpassed for some time. Hers is in fact the first overview of this material based on the application of exacting criteria of stylistic analysis. Projected against the broad outlines of the development of Romanesque and early Gothic sculpture, many of the statues find a much more secure niche than heretofore in the chronology. The famous statue of Notre-Dame de Bon Espoir in Dijon, for example, often claimed as a work of the eleventh century, is here more plausibly redated into the third quarter of the twelfth. As this example also indicates, the author has sought to counteract the still widely prevalent notion that these carvings were exclusively produced by Auvergnat workshops. This widening of the perspective is most welcome, though the extension of the focus of study to the borders of modern France has inevitably raised the difficulty of finding a satisfactory method for dealing with those relatively homogeneous groups of works from areas which now straddle those boundaries. This problem is particularly acute in the case of the large body of statues from the area of the Pyrenees, which is inseparable from sculpture classifiable as of Spanish origin. The author's text is completed by an invaluable detailed inventory of 110 statues, all, save six, illustrated, in many cases by more than one photograph. The entries in this catalogue, varying in length in accordance with the interest of the piece, are full of pertinent observations, though since few of the statues have been subjected to analysis under laboratory conditions, they do not claim to be exhaustive. Given the large number of statues to have survived, shading off at the most commonplace level into what might be called folk art, the author also probably took the only practical course open to her in limiting her selection to a Register of Principal Examples. It is naturally foreseeable that interested readers will be led to question the inclusion of some carvings on the list, or deplore the omission of others, though the author has reduced, if not (as will be seen below) altogether eliminated, the temptation to quibble, through the inclusion of two appen- dices. The first lists statutes of secondary interest, or, one gathers, doubtful</page><page sequence="5">112 Reviews authenticity. The second is a record of the most notable carvings of this type from Belgium, Germany and Switzerland. Spanish, Italian and Scandinavian examples, except when mentioned in the body of the text, are omitted, though a brief bibliography refers the reader to the most important works on material of other than French origin.2 The comments which follow are directed to the corresponding numbers in the Register. 3. This quite well-published statue, from Notre-Dame de Montvianeix, and said to be in a private collection there, is identical with a carving acquired in 1967 by the Metropolitan Museum (No. 67.153), though following the ar- cane ways of that institution, only recently placed on exhibition at the Cloisters. 23. Although I have not seen it "in the flesh," I have serious doubts about the authenticity of this work, now in the Duke University Art Museum, Durham, N.C. This is based less on the unsatisfactory quality of the surface, which has virtually lost its polychromy, than on the fact that it appears to be a literal copy of No. 20, a statue in the R. S. Shriver, Jr., Collection in Washington, D.C. While a considerable degree of consistency may be ex- pected in images belonging to the same iconic family, the resemblances, which I have checked with the help of additional views of both statues, go here beyond reasonable bounds to a virtual duplication of all salient fea- tures. A statue belonging to the same series has recently been acquired by the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Buenos Aires (Gazette des Beaux-Arts, 80 [1973], 80). 47. As the author points out, the La Chomette (Haute-Loire) statue has been cleaned in recent times. A photograph published in Almanach de Brioude 35 (1954), pl. opposite p. 194, represents it in its present state, though the view prior to restoration published by Professor Forsyth retains its value as documentation. This work, along with other statues in the area, are listed by A. Casati, "Inventaire et classification des statues de la Vierge et de l'Enfant de la region brivadoise," Almanach de Brioude 18 (1937), 67 ff., which should be added to the bibliography. 101. As Professor Forsyth indicates, the Beaulieu statue, which she places in the second half of the twelfth century, has been assigned widely divergent dates. To the earlier opinions quoted should be added that of W. Sauerlaen- der (Revue de l'art 3 [1958], 83), who argues for a date not later than 1130. WALTER CAHN Yale University 2 To the extensive Selected Bibliography found at the end of the volume should be added an early source, J. Branche's La vie des saincts et sainctes d'Auvergne et de Velay (Le Puy, 1652), which contains an inventory of the principal shrines of the Virgin in the region, including a brief description (69-70) of the statue of Orcival (Forsyth No.,31).</page></plain_text>
