GWINN VIVIAN ARIZONA STATE MUSEUM ABSTRACT During January and February 1964, an archaeological survey of the Lower Gila River was undertaken by the Arizona State Museum to locate sites endangered by future Gila River channel alterations. The 85 sites located in the survey reflected occupation in the river valley by several culturally distinct groups. Anglo American, modern Papago, historic Western Yavapai, historic and prehistoric Yuman, and prehistoric Hohokam sites were represented.

Wasley, Archaeologist, Arizona State Museum, was assisted by the author on an archaeological survey of the Lower Gila River (Fig. 1) to determine what archaeological or historical material might be endangered by a proposed Department of the Interior river chan- nel clearing project. Funds for this salvage archaeology were provided to the Arizona State Museum by National Park Service contract No. 14-10-0333-1133 as part of the Interagency Archaeo- logical Salvage Program. The area under consideration extended on both sides of the river from Blaisdell, about ten miles east of Yuma, to the Painted Rock Dam on the Gila River, some twenty miles northwest of Gila Bend. This paper is a report of sites located by the survey. The 120 miles of river area surveyed were examined by vehicle and on foot. Work progressed from the west to the east. Sites were recorded in the survey system of the Arizona State Museum and site cards and collections are stored at the Museum. Previous archaeological work along the Lower Gila River include surveys by Gila Pueblo (Gladwin 1930), Schroeder (1952) and Breternitz (1957). Malcolm Roger's investigations in this area for the San Diego Museum of Man are not in published form. The Gladwin's survey of western Arizona included the Lower Gila River. Fifteen sites were located between Gila Bend and Yuma, 11 of which were Yuman sites. Four sites near the Gila Bend area showed a mixture of Colonial or Sedentary Hohokam pottery with Yuman ceramics. The Gladwins concluded that Yuman sites on the Gila River probably marked camp sites of raiding parties. Schroeder's survey on the Lower Gila River was made in con- junction with a survey of the Colorado River below Davis Dam. Reconnaissance of the Lower Gila River included the area of the Wellton-Mohawk Canal Project and the Painted Rock Reservoir area. Thirteen sites were recorded from these two areas on the Gila River. Lower Colorado Buff Ware was found at most sites, and Gila Plain was found at three sites in association with pre- dominant amounts of Lower Colorado Buff Ware. Breternitz surveyed the Lower Gila River from Yuma to the Painted Rock Mountains in 1955 and reported 13 sites within the drainage of the Gila River and one outside the drainage. These sites included petroglyphs, a trail, a historic site, and pottery sites characterized by Lower Colorado Buff Ware and occasional other sherds which included Sedentary Hohokam types. 99</page><page sequence="6">The topography of the Lower Gila River changes only slightly throughout the surveyed area (Fig. 1). The river marks the center of a broad, often vaguely defined valley, and the shallow river channel frequently spreads over a wide area. Sand dunes form on or near the river edge in many places, and occasional volcanic remnants, as at Texas Hill and Agua Caliente, stand as landmarks within the valley. Beyond the river the land is usually flat, covered by desert pavement, and cut, primarily on the north, by minor washes. Vegetation concentrated in the river bottom and along its borders consists of mesquite, willow and salt cedar. Palo verde is most often found in the minor tributaries, and creosote and cacti cover the flats beyond the river. This picture of the valley is undergoing transformation in several areas which are being developed for agriculture. The valley from Yuma to Texas Hill is marked by extensive irriga- tion systems and numerous fields producing crops throughout the year. Archaeological and historical remains in this area have been almost totally destroyed. Some cultivation is carried out in the vicinity of Dateland and in the Dendora Valley. The completion of the Painted Rock Dam and development of wells promise addi- tional water for the Dendora Valley. It was noted that large scale clearing of land for cultivation was in progress at the time of the survey. Persons have inhabited the Lower Gila River valley and used the river course as a major route of travel since prehistoric times. As a result the overlay and mixture of cultural remains in favor- able areas along the river is great. Several authorities have employed historical, archaeological and ethnological data to iden- tify various indigenous ethnic groups with geographic sections of the river valley or with actual occupation sites on the river. The most thorough studies have been undertaken by Spier (1930), Schroeder (1952, 1961), and Ezell (1963). A general history of Spanish and Anglo-American explora- tion and exploitation of the Lower Gila can be found in Edwin Corle's popular account, The Gila, River of the Southwest. More detailed references to the Spanish era can be found in Schroeder (1961), Ezell (1963) and Bolton (1916). Basic references to the Anglo-American period can be found in Barnes (1960) and Hinton (1954). Locations of the 85 sites recorded are shown in Figs. 2, 3, and 4. Sites were broadly classified as Anglo-American and Indian. Additional categories within these classifications and correlated site numbers are indicated in Table 1. 100</page><page sequence="7">101 I N ARIZ X:3 ARIZ X 4 it.Muggins Mts. Laguna Mts.

Mr. Albert Wynn of Yuma, Arizona, who reported this site, believed it was a refuse dump for one of the placer mining camps established in the area after 1858. No house foundations are present in the vicinity of the dump, nor would they be expected since it is noted that miners working in the nearby mountains resided in temporary quarters (Barnes 1960: 373). Material collected includes stoneware, porcelain, beer bottles and such metal objects as harness fittings, wire and horseshoe nails, a drift bolt and canteen cap. Cartridge cases of 12, 20 and 410 gauge and 38, 25 and 22 calibre, and unidentified scraps of seashell were also present. Thirty-five fragments of Indian-made (?) clay figurines were found in the dump. These represent parts of cows and horses including several well modeled cows heads. Wynn has collected similar pieces and in addition has an almost complete "cowboy" whose straddled legs appeared to have been fashioned for placing on a horse (Fig. 5). FIG. 5. Clay figurines from Arizona X: 3:2, a historic refuse area, were fairly well fired, appeared to have no temper added to the clay and were buff to gray in color. Features were modeled, incised or punched, or a combination of these techniques. In addition, torsos were often decorated with incised straight or zigzag lines and punching. No painted decoration was present. 106</page><page sequence="13">TOWNSITES Gila City Gila City, located at the northern end of the Gila Mountains and on the south bank of the Gila River, twenty-four miles east of Yuma, was established in 1858 by Jacob Snively, following discovery of deposits of placer gold in the Gila Mountains. A post office was established on December 24, 1858 with H. Busch as postmaster (Barnes 1960: 373), and between 1858 and 1862 several thousand men moved into the area to dry wash the placers in the Gila, Laguna and Muggins Mountains. During this period only four or five permanent adobe buildings were erected. The Snively ranch served from 1858 to 1861 as a station on the Butter- field Stage Route. A flood in 1862 wiped out most of the town but did not deter more miners from coming to the area for at least one more year. Unprofitable mining quickly diminished the town's size after 1863; the post office was discontinued on July 14, 1863, and J. Ross Browne in January, 1864 noted that, "At the time of our visit the promising Metropolis of Arizona consisted of three chimneys and a coyote" (Browne 1950: 77). Barnes (1960: 373) adds that in 1872 Gila City was no more than a single house, a stable and a corral. A post office was established at Monitor in the area of what had been Gila City on December 3, 1890 and con- tinued to function until March 3, 1904, although most activity had moved east approximately one and a half miles to the town of Dome, formerly Castle Dome, which was established at a siding of the Southern Pacific Railroad. A post office was established at Dome on December 16, 1892 and is in use at the present time. The actual site of Snively's Gila City was not located with any certainty in the present survey, and it is questionable if any trace of the original few adobe buildings exist, since this narrow strip of land between the Gila Mountains and the broad valley of the Gila River has been chosen for the location of the Southern Pacific Railroad, the Wellton-Mohawk Canal, and a wide graded road. Collections were made in the area one half to one mile west and north of Dome on either side of the road cut. House founda- tions occur on both sides of the road and a historic dump is located on the south of the road. Material from this dump yielded scrap iron, broken machinery and wire nails. In addition, bottles tenta- tively identified as having held beer and medicine were collected. Positive identification of the Gila City townsite is difficult since the area has been inhabited continually, though at times sparsely, since 1858. This long occupation is best demonstrated by finding in the above mentioned dump a telegraph insulator marked "Feb 107</page><page sequence="14">22 1870; Jan 25 1870; Jan 1? 1879; W. Brookfield 55 Fulton St. N.Y." and a 1939 Arizona automobile license plate. Palomas Palomas, originally named Doanville for John Doan, an early settler in the area, lies on the north bank of the Gila River approxi- mately six miles north and west of Aztec. Agricultural develop- ment was begun as early as 1885 on this section of the river and the Doanville Post Office was created on November 22, 1889. The Mohawk and Palomas irrigation districts, one on either side of the river, reportedly developed from 1,000 to 3,000 acres for culti- vation by 1890 (Ross 1923: 99). The name of the community and post office was changed to Palomas on April 18, 1891. Prosperity of the district continued until a flood in 1905 washed out the canal heading, which coupled with other damage resulted in the rapid decline of farming in the Palomas district. George Wharton James (1903) reported a visit to Palomas sometime during or prior to 1903 for the purpose of studying "Yuma-Apache" basketry. He found four families of "Yuma-Apache" residing in the area and makes reference to local farmers. J. Fred Nottbusch operated the one store (Fig. 6). Ross (1923: 216) reported that in 1920 Palomas had a population of 46; primarily Mexicans living in scattered adobe and wooden houses. Little farming was being done at this FIG. 6. Nottbusch's store, Palomas, in 1964. Ross reported in 1923 that the store provided water, meals, groceries, and gasoline for persons using the Phoenix to Yuma road which passed through the town. 108</page><page sequence="15">time, but some Mexican ranchers had herds of cattle. Population continued to decrease and the Palomas post office was closed on August 31, 1938. The revised edition of Arizona Place Names (Barnes 1960: 382) reports that Palomas is gone and the entire area under culti- vation. However, farming which centers around an area north of Dateland has not yet expanded to Palomas and the nearest fields are approximately a mile west of the abandoned town. The town- site is marked by a dense growth of salt cedar which can be seen for several miles in any direction. The most prominent building standing, a large roofless, rectangular, adobe structure, is all that remains of Nottbusch's store. Other structures reported in 1920 are scattered at some dis- tance from the above mentioned store and are mostly small one or two room "sandwich houses" usually with a corral adjacent to the house. The term "sandwich house" is used to designate house construction in which walls are constructed of mud-daubed poles further strengthened by horizontal planks nailed or otherwise secured to wall frames. A large abandoned canal forming part of the old irrigation system passes to the south of the townsite and can be followed west for more than a mile. Material collected was from refuse dumps which lie to the west and north of the site. In some areas they are probably a meter in depth. The collection includes beer, medicine and shoe-blacking bottles, mentholatum and cosmetic jars, fragments of ceramic dolls, harness fittings and a wagon part; 10, 12, and 16 gauge shotgun shells, and pieces of broken crockery. STAGE STATIONS Mohawk The ruins of the Mohawk Stage Station are on the south side of the Gila River approximately a mile and a half west of the Mohawk Mountains. The first of two stage stations at this site was built in August 1857 and was known as Peterman's after the name of the owner. The station consisted of two buildings separated by a passage-way which led back into a corral to the north of the station. In 1860 a Butterfield station was established here, and the name was changed to Mohawk. A new building was erected approximately ten feet north of the old Peterman station and though somewhat larger resembled the older structure. The build- ing was constructed of adobe blocks set on a sandstone block and adobe foundation. In the following year the route was discon- 109</page><page sequence="16">FIG. 7. Low adobe walls and an adobe mound are all that remain today of the Mohawk Stage Station. This station served as a regular stop on the Butterfield Overland Route from 1860 to 1861. tinued, and apparently the buildings were abandoned very shortly thereafter, for in 1864 J. Ross Browne made no mention of the station and reported that from Antelope Hill to Texas Hill the only features were desert mesas and sand bottoms (Brown 1950: 81). Today the original Peterman's station is distinguished by a series of low adobe mounds covered with a dense growth of mes- quite. The second or Mohawk station was reported by Schroeder in 1952 as a three room structure with walls in some places stand- ing to a height of fourteen feet (Schroeder 1952: Fig. 31). Since 1952 most of the walls have been knocked down, presumably by treasure hunters, who also have dug several large pits in and near the building (Fig. 7). Cultural remains were collected primarily from an area south of the Mohawk station and may represent refuse from both sta- tions. Stoneware and porcelain were not common. Plate window glass and fragments of glass containers for medicine, ink, wine and relishes were identified from survey collections. Hole-in-top cans, a lard bucket and several pieces of an iron stove were noted. Three white clay pipe fragments were found at the site. A stem from one pipe has a portion of two words impressed on oppo- 110</page><page sequence="17">site sides; ". .. DOUGALL" and "GLAS......". The latter word is probably Glasgow as a number of clay pipe manufacturers were established in Glasgow, Scotland. The other name may be McDougall. Wilson (1961: 13) notes that a D. McDougall made pipes in Glasgow from 1853 to 1881. Antelope The Antelope Stage Station was built by John Kilbride in 1857 on the south bank of the Gila at the base of Antelope Hill, sometimes referred to as Antelope Peak. Although it was not one of the original Butterfield Overland Stations it did appear on the itinerary of the Overland Route in 1859. In 1864 Browne wrote that a station at the hill was in charge of two soldiers who sup- plied hay for Government teams (Browne 1950: 81), and in Hin- ton's Handbook of 1877 it was noted that a ranch in the Gila valley supplied the Antelope Peak Station (Hinton 1954: 173). Ross did not refer specifically to the stage station, but reported that an adobe house and several corrals near the bridge spanning the Gila were abandoned and dilapidated (Ross 1923: 163). At present the exact location of the stage station is not known. J. Ross Browne's sketch shows the building to the north and east of the hill. Conkling reported that the station had been located on the west side of the hill and that a group of adobe buildings destroyed by a railroad branch line were believed to have been part of the station (Conkling 1947: Vol. 2: 186). No trace of adobe buildings can be found in the area between the river and the base of the talus as it has been completely disturbed by the con- struction of not only the railroad but by a paved road from Tacna and a graded road paralleling the Gila. On the basis of the quantity of historic material recovered, the site designation has been applied to that area several yards west of the old approach to the concrete bridge destroyed in the 1920 Gila River flood. This area probably corresponds to the locality of the adobe house and corrals mentioned by Ross. The area between the talus and the river has been leveled and no signs of wall remain. A poured concrete floor of a small rectangular room is visible at the eastern side of the leveled area. Evidence of an earlier occupation by makers of Lower Colo- rado Buff Ware is considered elsewhere. Items of more recent non-Indian manufacture were numerous. British and American stonewares, and a broken Chinese porcelain rice bowl were collected from the site. British stoneware from the Alfred Meakin ceramic works in Tunstall, England was identified on the basis of hallmarks, as was American stoneware made by 111</page><page sequence="18">a b FIG. 8 a.

A disc-like plug in this pipe probably served to keep tobacco out of the smoker's mouth. the S &amp; W Baggott company which operated from 1853 to 1895 in East Liverpool, Ohio. Several bisque ware fragments of dolls' heads and arms were found. Medicine bottles were the most common glass containers. Objects of metal included wire nails, nuts, bolts and screws. An iron knife handle, an Esterbrook stick-pen point, grommets and miscellaneous harness fittings were also recovered. Shotgun shells were represented by 12 and 20 gauges; other cartridges included 32 and 22 calibres. One complete white clay pipe (Fig. 6a) and 12 fragments were in the site refuse. There is no spur on the complete specimen, and the stem is very short. Examination of the end of the stem showed that it had been molded short. Wilson has described clay pipes which required an additional stem, usually a reed about 10 inches long, which could be discarded for a new one when clogged with tar (Wilson 1961: 6). There are no identifying marks on this pipe. Eight bowl fragments had no identifying marks and of the eight only two retained a portion of the spur. A ninth piece had an impressed T D on the bowl, the diagnostic feature of "T D" type pipes. A discussion of this type of pipe can be found in the Johnny Ward's Ranch report (Fontana and Greenleaf 1962: 95-96). Of three stem parts one had no marks while two were decorated with raised lateral diamond shapes on opposite sides of the stem. FARMS/RANCHES Five sites marked by a predominance of non-Indian artifacts and some type of architectural remains were designated as Farms 112</page><page sequence="19">or Ranches. They were recorded from an area approximately five miles northwest of Dateland to Oatman Flat in the Dendora Valley. All were located near the river, above the channel, but the height above the bottomlands depended on the local topography, some being located on a floodplain almost on a level with the river while others were situated on silt banks twenty or more feet above the river course. Architectural remains were present at all sites. House struc- tures with one or two rooms were found at Y: 3:22 and Y: 3:27 and structures with more than two rooms were recorded at Y:2:5, Y: 3:17 and S:16:16. Corrals were present at Y:3:17 and Y:2:5. House construction varied. The structure at Y:3:17 was of frame construction. A depression in the area of the fallen house suggests the presence of a basement, root cellar or other partially if not entirely subterranean room. Corrals at this site were exten- sive and stock raising may have been as important as agriculture at this farm. Adobe block construction was used for the single room house at Y: 3:22 and the series of rooms at Fourr's Cabin, S: 16:16. Sev- eral cottonwood beams in place at the Fourr Cabin indicate a flat roof. The building material used at Y: 2:5 is unknown; nothing remains of this structure at present but a concrete floor and a chimney of the same material. The small one room structure at Y: 3:27 is outlined with roughly squared basalt blocks. There is no indication that the walls were carried higher than one stone. The scarcity of cultural material at this site suggests that the building may never have been completed or that it served only as a temporary shelter. Artifacts were gathered from refuse associated with the structures. Indian pottery was found at three of the sites. Three Gila Plain sherds at Y: 3:27 are probably not attributable to the site. The only other items collected were a fragment of unidenti- fied seashell and a stemmed glass. The only site with Lower Colo- rado Buff Ware was Y: 3: 22. That portion of the site occupied by the historic house is designated as area A. Approximately ten yards to the north and west of area A are a series of eroding sand dunes from which Lower Colorado Buff Ware was recovered. This portion of the site is designated as B. The Lower Colorado Buff pottery in area A probably represents wash from the dunes. One sherd of Papago Red was collected from Area A at Y: 3:22. Papago Red was also found at S: 16: 16 in association with Papago Plain. 113</page><page sequence="20">Historic material was similar at all sites. Pottery of modern Mexican manufacture was found at the Fourr Cabin site. All other historic ceramics were stoneware or porcelain. Identifiable hallmarks on these latter wares indicated a large percentage of American products, in particular stonewares produced in the Liverpool, Ohio area. An exception to this trend was found at Y: 3:17 where stoneware imports from England and Holland were collected. Medicine bottles are common at most sites. Identifiable medicines include Hamlins Wizard Oil, Syrup of Figs and Rum- ford Chemical Works. Equally as common were beer, wine, gin and whiskey bottles. Fragments of jars and glass lids of the Kerr and Mason companies were indicative of home canning. With the exception of a square cut nail found at Y: 3:22, all nails collected were the wire type. Twelve gauge shotgun shells and 22, 32, 38, 41, 44 and 45 calibre revolver and rifle cartridge cases were represented. Buttons, both mother-of-pearl and milk glass, an egg beater, tin cans including the hole-in-top type, ceramic doll fragments, dry cell battery cores, and harness fittings were also recovered at one or more of these sites. Dating of these sites was based on analysis of artifactual material and historical documentation. The only site which could be documented with certainty was S: 16: 16 or Fourr's Cabin. Wil- liam Fourr settled in Oatman Flat in 1869 and presumably con- structed or began construction on the building known as Fourr's Cabin. This building was situated approximately a quarter of a mile southeast of the ruins of an early Butterfield Stage Station. Fourr was still residing in Oatman Flat in 1872 when he attempted to establish a toll-road across the flat. Sometime between 1872 and 1915 the building was abandoned for in 1916 it was rehabilitated for use as a school house (Conkling 1947: 177). By 1920 Ross reported that it served as the J. W. Jordan ranch house and was ". .. a very substantial structure of adobe, originally used as a station on the stage line which ran along the bank of the river from Yuma to Gila Bend and thence across the desert to Tucson. It was then called Oatman's Flat Station" (Ross 1923: 159). Appar- ently Fourr's Cabin was mistaken for the earlier stage station which was in ruins at the time Fourr constructed his home, and of which no trace remained at the time of the survey. The Dendora Valley Quadrangle 15 minute series of 1951 shows the Jordan Ranch. At the time of the survey the building was in ruins and the area on all sides of the structure under cultivation. Condition of the building suggested that it had been abandoned for some time. 114</page><page sequence="21">Early occupation at the Fourr Cabin was further substantiated by the occurrence of purple or "desert" glass in the trash around the house. Prior to World War I glass "mix" was not standardized and glass with a high manganese oxide content, which tends to turn purple when exposed to sunlight, was produced. Standardiza- tion after 1917 reduced the ratio of manganese oxide and in so doing reduced the degree of color change. Standardization also effected bottle necks which prior to 1917 were hand finished and now became entirely machine molded. Although slight purpling occasionally occurs in more recent bottles, hand finished necks and a purple color are usually indicative of bottles produced prior to World War I. The building and corrals at Y:3: 17, approximately two and one half miles northeast of Palomas, are located within a quarter mile of the Palomas irrigation district canal. This canal was twenty-two miles in length and was first used in 1887. Cultivated areas now covered with dead mesquite to the west of Y:3:17, indicate that this site is probably one of the farms or homesteads which flourished in the Palomas area between 1885 and 1905. Artifacts from this site include English and Dutch stoneware imports marked with the country of origin. This marking was required by the United States Government after 1891 (Ormsbee 1959: 16). A hole-in-top can from this same site may predate the turn of the century, when this type of can was replaced by the open top can. Finally an eggbeater from Y: 3:17 had two inscribed patent dates of 1888 and 1891. Purple glass and hand finished bottle necks suggests occupa- tion in the early 1900's at Y: 3:22. The date for this site can be further corroborated on the basis of a stoneware plate marked with a 1910 calendar, a roll strip can opener which could date as early as 1895 and a crown type bottle cap with foil liner, first introduced in 1907. Among surface finds at Y:2:5 were purple glass, machine finished bottle necks and clear glass. Identifiable stoneware from this site was produced by the Homer Laughlin Company, estab- lished in Liverpool, Ohio in 1874. Material from Y: 3:27 was scant and not diagnostic for dating. DAMSITE West of Oatman Flat the Gila River has cut through a basalt flow and forms a narrow canyon for several miles. Arizona S: 16: 9 and S: 16: 11 are a complex of structures on the south side of the river at one of the narrowest points in the canyon. This complex includes a large rectangular stone and cement building above the 115</page><page sequence="22">river and the remnants of an early attempt to dam the Gila at the base of the cliff for irrigation purposes. This project, known as the South Gila or Sentinel, was begun in 1892 but was dis- continued in 1893 as a result of lack of funds. Davis (1897: 77) reported that the plan at that time was to construct a fifty foot overflow dam with both faces of the dam protected by asphalt concrete. Ross reported that the diversion site and headwaters of this irrigation system were owned by the Southwestern Fruit and Irrigation Company; the canal was 22 miles in length. Of further interest is the fact that "No land was ever cultivated under this project, and it was only during times of flood that water flowed in the canal .... This irrigation project is now abandoned" (Ross 1923: 100). The large rectangular building at S: 16:9 is of cut stone and cement and though roofless is in fair condition. A water tower and kiln of similar construction are also present. S:16:11, the dam site, is marked on both sides of the river by the remains of concrete piers and on the north side of the river by a large earth embankment. Anglo material culture was found at both sites. Glass bottles for medicine, liquor and sauces were present. Among the more interesting was part of a round-bottomed green glass bottle of the type used for sodawater, ginger beer or "Belfast sparkling water." A broken telegraph insulator marked "Brookfield" prob- ably was from the same manufacturer as that found in the vicinity of Gila City. A small piece of white clay pipe with an impressed T on the bowl was found in a refuse area near the stone house and is representative of the "T D" type clay pipes. Metal objects included a boat spike, hole-in-top can, and a 44 calibre cartridge case. Papago Plain and Papago Red was collected at S: 16: 11. This pottery was no doubt from Arizona S: 16: 10, a tent camp site on the mesa, discussed under Papago sites. INDIAN SITES POTTERY Ceramics from the Lower Gila River have not been fully described or studied. Malcolm Rogers' material is largely unpub- lished, and Schroeder's Lower Colorado Buff Ware data (1952, 1958) is mainly based on pottery from the Colorado River rather than from the Gila. Breternitz (1957) added new information, but his survey was limited and his material based on 14 sites. Studies in the Painted Rocks Reservoir area (Schroeder 1961; Wasley and Johnson 1965) were restricted to a small section of the Gila River. 116</page><page sequence="23">Since the present survey was not oriented toward a ceramic study, and the survey collections do not represent consistent sam- pling, a detailed analysis of Lower Gila ceramics is not possible here. Such an analysis would require investigation of ceramic data from beyond the Gila River valley, particularly in northwestern Papagueria (see Ezell 1954) and in the Colorado River area. This requirement is beyond the scope of this paper. Nevertheless the need for ceramic examination was evident. Pottery (Table 2), found at almost all Indian sites, was a major guide in arriving at some type of cultural classification for a site, and was a means by which sites might be compared and the results interpreted. During the course of the survey it became clear that Indian pottery from surface collections could be separated into three basic groupings: modern Papago, Hohokam, and river Yuman, the latter generally referred to in recent literature as Lower Colo- rado Buff Ware. These three groupings served as a framework for an examination of the survey collection. Modern Papago pottery made up a small percentage of the total ceramic collection. Only three types were involved, and all were easy to distinguish. More specific comments can be found in the section dealing with Papago sites. Hohokam pottery was generally restricted to the extreme east- ern end of the survey area (the Painted Rock Mountain region). Types were representative of the Pioneer, Colonial and Sedentary periods,as known at Snaketown in the Gila Basin. Hohokam occu- pation of the Painted Rock region after A.D. 1150 is at present a matter of controversy. In part the argument concerns the cultural affiliation of a pottery which is common to the area in question and is characterized by a temper of "quartz and black particles" (Schroeder 1958: Ware 16, Type 8). Schroeder, who identifies this pottery as the Gila Bend Series of Lower Colorado Buff Ware, contends that sites with this pot- tery were occupied by the Lower Gila Branch of the Hakataya sometime after A.D. 1150. W. W. Wasley and Alfred Johnson have implied in personal discussions that they consider Schroeder's Gila Bend Series to be a variety of Gila Plain, hence a Hohokam type, and to be representative of the Classic period. My examination of sherds from the Painted Rock area tended to establish the existence of Gila Plain, Gila Plain: Gila Bend Variety, and the Gila Bend Series. As noted below the Gila Bend Series differs from other Lower Colorado Buff Ware Series in several respects, but whether this pottery was made by Hakataya, 117</page><page sequence="24">TABLE 2.

For the purpose of this paper Gila Plain and Gila Plain: Gila Bend Variety are considered as Hohokam types, and the "quartz and black particles" tempered pottery as the Gila Bend Series of Lower Colorado Buff Ware. Pottery identified as Lower Colorado Buff Ware (Schroeder 1952: 16) on the basis of temper, paste, texture, surface color and surface finish was collected from fifty-five sites and accounted for 70 percent of the total sherd count. As Schroeder's series division of this ware was based on differences in temper to a large degree, approximately 1,000 of the Lower Colorado Buff Ware sherds were examined with the binocular microscope to establish broad categories of tempering material. No attempt was made during this examination to place sherds in Schroeder's ceramic series; rather sherds exhibiting similar temper were grouped and a description of each temper group was given. A total of six groups was distinguished. Several sherds selected from three of the groups were thin sectioned for petrographic analysis. This analysis is furnished by Mr. Richard G. Sense, graduate student in geology and anthropology at the University of Arizona. Temper Group 1 - Angular basalt particles Color of these particles ranged from black to brown with varying shades of red-brown, green-brown and purple-brown. Usually occurring in medium amounts, these grains were medium to large in size. Petrographic analysis: "Arroyo sand composed of augite diabase. Rock fragments show little modification from their original shape, i.e., as they would appear at the outcrop. Several subangular grains of quartz. Temper in sherd 30%." Temper Group 2 - Rounded or subangular sand Sand was primarily quartz, but other minerals occurred giv- ing a variety of color. Most often the sand was medium in size but coarse and fine particles were also present. The amount used fluctuated and did not appear to be diagnostic. Petrographic analysis: 1. "Quartz sand. A few fragments of quartz monzonite. Quartz 95%, quartz monzonite 5%. Temper in sherd 15%." 2. "Arroyo sand. Fragments of rhyolite, quartz monzonite. Quartz grains probably derived from rhyolite and monzonite. Rhyolite 80%, monzonite 202,. Temper in sherd 40%." Temper Group 3- Subangular to angular grains of quartz Quartz grains were occasionally mixed with small amounts of rounded colored sand. Size ranged from coarse to medium, but 120</page><page sequence="27">fine and very coarse particles occurred. As with rounded sand the quantity did not appear to be diagnostic. Petrographic analysis: "Sand temper. Quartz, angular to subangular 60%, granite fragments 40%. Some rounding of granite showing trans- portation from source. Temper in sherd 20%." Temper Group 4-Angular fragments of sherd, clay or possibly tuff Fragments were white or tan in color with small grains of sand sometimes inherent in the larger pieces. Size of fragments and the amount used varied considerably. Temper Group 5- Mixed sherd and sand The sand was most often rounded and the sherd or clay par- ticles were frequently small in size. Quantity and color varied so as to not appear diagnostic. Temper Group 6--Unidentified It appeared that no tempering agent was employed in these sherds. After sherds were separated on the basis of temper, an attempt was made to isolate other diagnostic features for each temper group. Vessel walls of the basalt tempered pottery (Temper Group 1) usually were thicker and tended to crumble more easily. Fur- thermore, no sherds in this group were found with a stucco finish, common in other temper groups. Diagnostic structural differences in Temper Groups 2 through 5 were not apparent enough to establish distinguishing traits. In general, sherds with sand temper appeared to be thinner than those with sherd, or sherd and sand temper, although this was not always the case. The fact that the sherd tempered sample appeared. to be harder than sand tempered pottery could not be consistently demonstrated. Surface color was of no value in separating groups. Color ranged in all sherds from gray through brown to the more usual tans, buffs, and oranges. A stucco finish was applied to all but the basalt tempered pottery. In most cases a sand stucco was used; however, some sherd tempered pieces have a stucco of ground sherd. A polished red and unpolished cream variety were found only in the sand tempered and basalt tempered pottery. Rim shape was useful in one case; folded or tuckered rims occurred only on pots tempered with angular quartz sand. The sample of painted pottery was too small to be of value, 121</page><page sequence="28">except for indicating the scarcity of decorated types. Temper in these sherds included angular sand, rounded to subangular sand and sherd or clay fragments. Sherd size was small and design elements, with the exception of several parallel lines and one partial scroll, were not determinable. Whether primary classificatory value should be given to tem- per is questionable, but the lack of other diagnostic traits rendered necessary the treatment of this pottery as a Ware only, or as a series divided on the basis of temper differences. The spatial dis- tribution of these temper groups suggested there was some value to the division. Since temper in several of Schroeder's series were similar to the temper groups, series names were applied where correlation seemed plausible. These correlations were based on printed descriptions of the series and sample types from surveys of Schroeder, Breternitz, and Ezell. In addition Schroeder per- sonally examined a number of Parker Series sherds from the survey collection. Temper similarities between basalt tempered sherds and Schroeder's Gila Bend Series is close. The temper evidence is further supported by the lack of stucco sherds, thick vessel walls, and cream and red varieties. Areal distribution is also in accord with Schroeder, although sites with this pottery occurred further west than he noted. Sherds tempered with rounded to subangular grains of sand were classed as the Lower Gila Series. Schroeder (1958: Ware 16, Type 22) has noted that Palomas Buff (Lower Gila Series) ". .. was originally set up as a catch-all for the Lower Gila types by Rogers. There are a variety of somewhat similar tempered sherds that occur in the region that might well be included under this name, except for the fact that the gritty paste is lacking and the temper particles are not as abundant or small. These latter have some resemblance to Topoc Buff." (Salton Series). He remarks on the other hand that sherds of Topoc Buff with small sand temper usually contained abundant temper (1958: Ware 16, Type 18). It is my opinion that abundant small sand temper could produce a gritty paste. Although both Schroeder and Breternitz identified Topoc Buff as well as Palomas Buff from the Lower Gila River area, I was unable to arrive at a satisfactory method for separating the Lower Gila Series from the Salton Series on the basis of differ- ences in sand temper. Furthermore, Schroeder indicated that the Salton Series ranged sporadically from Needles to Ehrenberg. Because the quantity found on the Gila was too great to suggest 122</page><page sequence="29">trade, it seemed more appropriate to classify sherds with rounded to subangular sand temper as the Lower Gila Series. Sherds with angular quartz temper were correlated with the Parker Series. Similarities include the tempering material and the presence of a tuckered or folded rim. Differences may repre- sent a variant of the basic Parker Series. Such a variant was recognized by Harner, who described the Fort Mohave variant of Parker Buff, which differed from the series type by the presence of the parcher form and inclusion of copper-colored mica in the temper (Kroeber and Harner 1955: 18-19). Although Schroeder found this series well represented on the Colorado River he did not find it in comparable quantities on the Lower Gila. He believed that its presence on the Lower Gila prob- ably represented trail breakage (Schroeder 1958: Ware 16, Type 1). Breternitz on the other hand found Parker sherds as the domi- nant series in four of five historic sites he located. The same asso- ciation of Parker Series with historic material was noted in the present survey. The small sample of sherd or clay tempered pottery was cor- related with the Palo Verde Series. Correlatable traits are the occasional inclusion of small amounts of sand or angular quartz mixed with the sherd temper, and shrinkage areas or voids in the core. With the exception of a large number of sherds found near the Painted Rock Mountains most sherds with this temper were found at sites at the western end of the Gila. Schroeder postulated that the range of the Palo Verde Series included the area of Yuma and trade or trail breakage along the Gila (Schroeder 1958: Ware 16, Type 12). No correlation was made between sherd and sand tempered pottery and the La Paz Series for not only was the sample small, but no consistent definition of the temper of the La Paz Series has been published. Its description has varied from "Fine sherd and small rounded quartz grains in fairly abundant quantities. Sherd tempering sometimes lacking" (Schroeder 1958: Ware 16, Type 24), to ". .. abundant fine to small subangular sands, with occa- sional small yellowish or reddish fragments of hematite always being evident" (Schroeder 1961: 18). No correlation was made with non-tempered sherds. Following correlation of the survey collections with Schroe- der's ceramic series, the inter-series associations and their spatial distribution were considered. The Gila Bend Series accounted for thirty percent of Lower Colorado Buff Ware. Its distribution was largely confined to the 123</page><page sequence="30">area from the Painted Rock Mountains west to the eastern edge of the Palomas Plains. The majority of the sites with this pottery were on silt bars at the edge of the basalt flow south and west of the Oatman Mountains. Sites with this series were rare in the Palomas Plains, although a small clustering was located on both sides of the Gila River at Big Ethel Wash, which drains the west- ern peripheries of the Palomas Plains. Very small quantities found no further than seven miles west of Big Ethel Wash mark the western limit of this series. At approximately half of the sites Hohokam pottery, notably Gila Plain, was found with the Gila Bend Series. Other sites showed a mixture of the Gila Bend Series and other series of Lower Colorado Buff Ware. Sherds of the Lower Gila Series accounted for thirty-seven percent of Lower Colorado Buff Ware. Its occurrence geographi- cally was from the Painted Rock Mountains to Antelope Hill. Where common to predominant, it usually occurred at sites clus- tered in one area and was sparsely represented in the intervening regions. On the north bank of the Gila the first cluster area extended from west of Agua Caliente to approximately two miles east of Big Ethel Wash. Other sites were grouped in an area east of Texas Hill. On the south bank these sherds were common in sites from the northwest tip of the Painted Rock Mountains west to the eastern edge of the Palomas Plains. West of the Palomas Plains the series was predominant at only two sites, one in the neighborhood of Agua Caliente and one near Antelope Hill. This series occurred with the Gila Bend Series in the Painted Rock Mountains to Palomas Plains area with differences noted for oppo- site sides of the river; the Gila Bend Series, usually the predomi- nant type on the north side of the river, was quantitatively smaller on the south side. In the region west of the Palomas Plains the Gila Bend and Lower Gila Series were rarely mixed, and at only one site, Y:3:4, was the Gila Bend Series predominantly larger. Occurrence of the Lower Gila Series with Hohokam pottery was not consistent and no pattern was apparent. The Parker Series made up fourteen percent of Lower Colo- rado Buff Ware. It was not present on the south side of the Gila, and with few exceptions, did not appear on the north side east of Agua Caliente. This series was predominant at sites clustered in the area of Palomas. At three sites west of Palomas, Parker Series sherds were found with the Lower Gila Series, and the latter series was quantitatively larger. The minor association of the Parker Series with other series and with Hohokam pottery did 124</page><page sequence="31">not appear significant. More importantly, historic material was fre- quently found in sites where the Parker Series was predominant. The Palo Verde Series totaled nine percent of Lower Colo- rado Buff Ware. This series was the only one present at X: 7:2, a site at the base of the Muggins Mountains and Y:5:3, located approximately two miles east of Antelope Hill. Pottery with sherd temper was found in significant numbers at sites on the south bank of the Gila near the Painted Rock Mountains, but elsewhere its appearance was sporadic, and no pattern of association with other series is apparent. Eight percent of the Lower Colorado Buff Ware was a mixed sherd and sand tempered pottery. It was distributed thinly from the eastern limits of the Palomas Plains to the Mohawk Mountains and was found with all series discussed, with historic material and at sites with Hohokam pottery. Sherd and sand tempered pot- tery was predominant at only three sites, all in the Palomas Plains. It was the only type at two of these sites and at the third was associated with small amounts of the Gila Bend Series. Unidentified sherds accounted for two percent of the total Lower Colorado Buff Ware count. This group was not further treated and was considered only as unidentified sherds. HISTORIC SITES Papago Five sites, four of which were on the south side of the Gila, were considered historic Papago. Two of these sites were village or house group sites. Arizona X: 3:4, an abandoned village site, was located approxi- mately one and a half miles west of Dome on a talus ridge of the Gila Mountains. The site was reported by Dr. Bernard Fontana of the Arizona State Museum, who was directed to the locality by Alfredo and Lorenzo Coz. The Piman speaking Coz brothers, both in their early 60's, are the only residents of an area near Dome, referred to locally as the Dome Sand Papago Village. They and their sister, Sara (Fig. 9), who lives near Roll, Arizona, may be the last Papagos who recall occupation of the village at Arizona X: 3:4. Remnants of several rectangular wattle and daub houses were present at the site and were constructed of upright ocotillo and sahuaro ribs plastered with mud. Although no round brush houses are present today, the Coz brothers advised that this house type had been used (Fontana, Personal Communication). At least two 125</page><page sequence="32">FIG. 9. Papagos photographed near Dome, Arizona in September 1963. From left to right they are, Joseph Rodriguez, Lorenzo Coz, Alfredo Coz, Sara Coz and Amelia Coz Rodriguez, daughter of Sara Coz. Papago stone shrines were to the east, separated from the house area by a small arroyo. No name was remembered for the village, but the nearest named feature in the area was "hardened soil." Papago Plain and Papago Red found at the site were tempered with sand, but contained no additional vegetable matter or horse manure. Papago Plain ollas and a small bowl of Papago Red were forms noted. No non-Indian ceramics were observed, but glass fragments, tin cans, and milk glass buttons were found in associa- tion with the Papago pottery. Ezell has noted (1954: 24) that toward the end of the nine- teenth century a group of Arenefios or Sand Papagos settled near Dome, and Childs (1954: 30) reported to Dobyns that "Sand Indians" moved to Gila City to work the placers after gold was discovered in 1858. The Coz brothers did not know whether X: 3:4 was established prior to or after a 1905 or 1906 flood in the Gila which washed out a bottomland Papago village. Sara, about 70 years old, remembered that the village was occupied when she was a child. Arizona X: 8:5 included three one-room structures in a plowed field on the south bank of the Gila approximately four miles north- east of Wellton. The buildings had collapsed and refuse areas nearby were churned by plowing. Walls of the structures were of horizontal sahuaro rib poles secured by means of wire and nails 126</page><page sequence="33">(nails examined in the wall were wire nails) to a frame of posts sunk into the ground at the room corners and in intervening spaces. No covering on the horizontal poles remained, and the type of roofing was not apparent. Papago Plain was found at this site in addition to American stoneware, medicine bottles and miscellaneous bits of glass and metal. This site may represent a small farming village. Gifford (1936: 253) reported that Papagos farmed in modern times along the Gila River from Gila Bend to Dome. The single structure at S:16:17 had burned. Charred posts indicated that it was possibly similar in construction to houses at X: 8: 5. This burned house, associated refuse area and nearby cor- ral were located on the north bank of the Gila on the eastern edge of the Palomas Plains. Sand tempered sherds of apparent Papago origin were in the refuse. Non-Indian artifacts included stoneware and broken glass. In addition, a pin type identification badge issued by the United States Reclamation Service Yuma Project, which operated from 1906 to 1909, was recovered. Evidence for a tent camp was found at S: 16: 10. This site was located east of the Sentinel Irrigation company buildings at S: 16: 9. All pottery at this site was of Papago manufacture. In addition to Papago Plain and Papago Red, twelve pieces of Papago White-on- Red were found. Fontana (Fontana and others 1962: 104) states that Papago White-on-Red ". . . seems to have two variants based on background color, perhaps due to firing control." These vari- ants, a white-on-red and a white-on-brown, were both present at S: 16:10. The white paint is fugitive. Fontana places this type in Period I which dates A.D. 1700 to 1860. Arizona Y: 4:4, a refuse area, was located approximately four miles west of Oatman Flat at the base of the basalt flow bordering the Gila on the south. Refuse was scattered over a silt flat near the abandoned South Gila or Sentinel irrigation canal. No evi- dence of structures was found. Papago pottery included Papago Plain and one sherd of Papago Red. Historic non-Indian ceramics were represented by stoneware. Purpled glass fragments, the base of an opium bottle, a metal button and tin cans of the hole-in-top variety were also collected. The similarity of material collected at Y: 4:4 and S: 16: 10, and the proximity of both to the old Sentinel or South Gila irrigation canal suggests the possibility that they may represent temporary camps of Papagos hired as canal construction workers. 127</page><page sequence="34">Yuman The term Yuman is used here to denote language affiliation and not specific tribal group. During the summer of 1955 Breter- nitz (1957) located five widely separated sites on the Lower Gila River in which Lower Colorado Buff Ware (specifically the Parker, Palo Verde and Salton Series) was associated with cans, glass, and miscellaneous metal. (The present survey relocated two of these sites: Y: 2:1 and Y: 3: 1.) All were termed campsites, and Breternitz made a further division on the basis of their loca- tions: three occurred in mesquite flats on the river bottom and two in sand dunes on the flood plain margin above the mesquite area. He considered the sites in sand dunes to have been tempo- rarily used for the gathering and processing of mesquite beans. Although he found no indication of surface habitations in the mesquite flats, the amount of material culture present suggested to him that these sites were of a more permanent nature. An additional ten sites with Lower Colorado Buff Ware and historic non-Indian artifacts were recorded in the present survey. Nine of these sites were within a three mile radius of Palomas. The tenth was near Rocky Point at the southern end of Oatman Mountain. All were located near the river edge above the river bottom, five being in sand dunes and five on mesquite flats. The quantity of material from sites in the Palomas area indicated fairly permanent occupation regardless of topographical location. The Rocky Point site may have been occupied only temporarily. Seven of the above sites in the vicinity of Palomas have been identified tentatively as historic Yavapai (Upland Yuman), and will be treated in a following section. The remaining three sites, which are described below, are considered to have been occupied by an unidentified Yuman speaking people. The distinct remains of four houses and suggestions of two others were present at Y: 2: 13, a site west of Palomas. The four well defined houses were roughly square and averaged fifteen feet on a side. All were marked by depressions and appeared partially subterranean. Construction was of large vertical timbers placed at the corners with horizontal poles nailed between these corner posts to form the walls. Adobe ridges around the perimeter prob- ably represented plaster washed down from the walls. Roofing could not be determined. These houses, with associated refuse mounds, were in an area roughly 120 by 200 feet. Sherds of the Lower Gila and Palo Verde Series were col- lected in refuse areas. Two Palo Verde sherds from this site appeared to have been stuccoed with a thin application of cement. 128</page><page sequence="35">Acid applied to the coating produced a bubbling reaction. A large quantity of non-Indian items, including American stoneware and porcelain, glass bottle fragments and pressed glass were recovered. Cartridge cases from this site covered a wide range of calibres. Stove parts, clock parts, wire nails and tin cans were also found. One fairly complete school slate with incised lines and a small slate rod which may have served as a writing instrument on the tablet were also collected. The number of houses, and the proximity of the site to Palomas may signify settlement by Mexicans or Anglo-Americans rather than Indians, in which case Indian ceramics may represent trade. As reported earlier, the Palomas area was important for a number of years as a farming center. The site designation Arizona Y:3:15 was given to a refuse area on the east bank of Big Ethel Wash at its confluence with the Gila, and to two cremation pits approximately thirty yards to the east of the refuse. Eight sherds collected from the refuse area were identified as Gila Bend Series, and another as sherd and sand tempered (Temper Group 5). Historic items included a leather shoe sole with lead tackets, an iron axe-head, glass, porce- lain and stoneware. Fragments of two bone china plates (Fig. 10) from the Minton Ltd. China Works at Stoke-on-Trent, England were also recovered from the refuse area. Two diamond shaped English Registry Marks, one impressed, and one printed, were present on an intact portion of one plate. These marks, used to register plate shape and design with the British Patent Office, indicated class of material, day, month and year of registration, and the identity of the registrant. The impressed mark on the plate in question revealed that the plate shape was registered on January 10, 1880. The printed hallmark indicated design registration on September 14, 1880. An additional impressed mark was used by the Minton China Works from 1842 to 1942 to indicate year of manufacture. The year mark on the above mentioned plate was for 1881. The pattern on both plates is Faisan, executed in a brown color. J. E. Hartill, Managing Director of Mintons Ltd., in corre- spondence with the author advised however that the pattern was probably created in other colors as well. This pattern was appar- ently popular since Hartill also noted that orders for Faisan were received as late as the 1930's. Indeed, its popularity was wide- spread when one considers that two Faisan-patterned dinner plates of "the worlds most beautiful china" once graced the table of a Yuman household. 129</page><page sequence="36">FIG. 10. Fragments of two Minton bone china plates found in a Yuman site, Arizona Y:3: 15, on Big Ethel Wash. These plates were manufactured at Stoke-on-Trent, England in 1881. The Faisan pattern was first printed by transfer from a hand engraved copper sheet. After firing the print, the brown color was painted in by hand and fired again, the process being known as print and enamel. The cremation pits were approximately three feet square and appeared as depressions with sloping sides. Fragments of bone, charcoal and sherds scattered around the pit edge suggested recent pot-hunting. Sections of several charred beams protruded from the pit edge in both cavities, implying that the limits of the original pits may have been greater. A handful of burned human bone was found at each hole. In addition, a small fragment of vesicular basalt metate, a round quartzite river cobble possibly used as a one-handed mano, and a portion of a thin schist disc were recovered from Pit II. The disc is similar to one reported by Breternitz from Arizona X: 8:1. The Gila Bend Series pottery from both pits appeared to be somewhat harder than typical sherds of this series, and refiring had caused a graying of the core, making the basalt temper less distinguishable. Vessel shapes determined from large sherds included a deep straight sided bowl and a small globular olla with a short recurved rim. The small amount of sherd or clay tempered pottery from Pit I, identified as representing the Palo Verde Series, also contained small amounts of basalt temper. The one 130</page><page sequence="37">painted sherd recovered from Pit I was decorated with a parallel black and white band. Temper in this sherd was rounded sand, typical of the Lower Gila Series. A sherd area between the Gila River and the southern point of Oatman Mountain, S:16:25, may represent a temporary camp. Sherds were identified as the Lower Gila Series and the Palo Verde Series. These series were those present at Y: 2: 13, described above. Unidentified stoneware and a machine finished glass bottle were found with the sherds. Yavapai Within a three mile radius of Palomas, seven sites were located which were characterized by a mixture of Anglo-American items and predominant amounts of the Parker Series. These sites are believed to have been occupied by Western Yavapai after 1900. A number of Western Yavapai were placed on the San Carlos Apache Reservation in the late 1870's by the United States Army where they remained until 1900. After their release in 1900, some members of this group drifted to the Gila River where they took up residence at Palomas and Agua Caliente. Five of Gifford's informants had resided at Palomas for a short period of time (1936: 249). One of the best records of Yavapai occupation at Palomas is that of George Wharton James (1903: 146-153), who visited the "Yuma Apaches" sometime prior to 1903. James reported that there were twenty to thirty families residing at Palomas and Agua Caliente, who made a living as ranch helpers. Women wove bas- kets for sale, and several are illustrated by James. Other photo- graphs accompanying the article showed that Anglo-American utensils (buckets, cans and enamel ware in particular) were in use. A simple domed brush shelter was also pictured. A murder and a suicide occurred during James' visit, and he describes the subsequent cremations in detail. Each corpse was placed in a pit between bundles of greasewood, and personal property was placed on the pyre. Following the cremation most brush shelters were fired and the area abandoned. Ross (1923) made no mention of the Yavapai at Palomas. Farming had declined in this area after 1905 and it is likely that the Yavapai families had departed. Gifford's informants indicated residence at Castle Dome and Arlington after living at Palomas. Sites found during the survey were almost always located near the river on recent dunes and on the mesquite flats fronting 131</page><page sequence="38">the dunes. In most cases a site comprised little more than cultural material scattered over the dunes and flats. House remains were limited to a single burned structure at Y:2:15A, marked by a low mound of orange-baked adobe on a silt knoll by the river. The house outline measured approximately 12 by 15 feet. Several burned adobe impressions of small poles were found in the mound. An area of prehistoric cultural material eroding from sand dunes north of the structures was designated Y: 2: 15B. Historic material was similar to that collected from historic farms and ranches. Both domestic and imported stoneware was found. A number of East Liverpool, Ohio potters were identified including: C. C. Thompson Pottery Company, established in 1868; Knowles, Taylor and Knowles, established in 1870; Homer Laugh- lin China Company, established in 1874; and the Potters Coopera- tive Company, established in 1892. Stoneware of the Wheeling Pottery Company, founded in 1879 in Wheeling, West Virginia, was also found. British stoneware was made by Alfred Meakin of Tunstall, England, and Thomas Furnival of Cobridge, England, the latter company established in the mid-1800's. Besides British and Ameri- can stoneware, part of a Chinese porcelain rice bowl was collected from Y: 2: 15A. Many of the glass bottles had originally held medicine. Frag- ments of liquor and beer bottles, Carter's ink bottles, and wide mouth canning jars were numerous. The inventory of metal objects covered a wide range. Cart- ridge cases, stove parts, silverplate and iron spoons and knives, harness fittings, zinc bottle caps and hole-in-top cans were re- corded. A cow bell, keyhole saw and door hinge were single items recovered. In addition to the wire nails usually found, common cut square nails were represented in collections from three sites. Fragments of white clay pipes were found at Y:2:15A and Y: 3: 10. The piece from the latter site had a raised T on the bowl indicative of the "T.D." type pipe. As noted previously, sherds from the Parker Series were found at the seven sites. Samples from several of these sites were sent to Schroeder who confirmed the identification. In five cases sherd and sand tempered pottery (Temper Group 5) was present in small amounts. Lower Gila sherds were found at two sites, and the Palo Verde and Gila Bend Series were each present at one site. There is no valid reason for believing that any of this pottery was produced by the Yavapai. Ground gravel or sherds and occa- 132</page><page sequence="39">sionally mashed cactus or chopped grass is given as a tempering agent for Western Yavapai pottery by Gifford (1936: 280). A Western Yavapai informant of Gifford's thought that pottery making was a useless art, and James reported no pottery manu- facture. It is possible that the Palomas Yavapai occupied previ- ously inhabited sites and used no pottery, however, it is my feeling that the Parker Series found may represent trade with the Mohave. Schroeder (Personal Communication) has noted that Mohave pottery may have reached the Yavapai by way of the Cibola-Agua Caliente Trail. PREHISTORIC SITES Pottery sites with no associated historic material are con- sidered here. These include Yuman sites, Hohokam sites and mixed Yuman and Hohokam sites. This division has been made only on the basis of pottery. Characteristics such as occupation in sand dunes and the presence of large quantities of cracked stone were not found to be consistently valid for site type desig- nation. It was not felt worthwhile to consider mixed sites in a separate section; therefore, in order to avoid possible confusion or repetition when dealing with them, the following points con- cerning mixed-site ceramics are made. No correlation could be established between specific series of the Lower Colorado Buff Ware and Hohokam types. Gila Plain and Gila Plain: Gila Bend Variety occurred with all series and were present at mixed-ceramic sites with the exception of Arizona S:16:13. Twelve sherds of a Tanque Verde-like Red-on-Brown were found with the Lower Colorado Buff Ware at Arizona S:16:13. Predominance of Gila Bend and Lower Gila Series at the sites of mixed ceramics probably reflected the spatial distri- bution of these series. Decorated Hohokam sherds were found with Lower Colorado Buff Ware in only five sites, and in three of the five only one Hohokam sherd was recovered. The remaining two were interest- ing as they represented wide temporal differences. Several sherds which may be Sweetwater Red-on-Gray or Snaketown Red-on- Buff were found at Arizona S:16:22, in addition to Gila Butte Red-on-Buff and Santa Cruz Red-on-Buff. Arizona S: 16:13 on the other hand was marked by the presence of twelve Tanque Verde- like Red-on-Brown sherds noted above. It is noteworthy that S:16:22, a site proportionately high in Hohokam pottery, produced four Trincheras Purple-on-Red sherds. Also three sherds of Gila Polychrome were collected from 133</page><page sequence="40">two sites with a predominance of Lower Colorado Buff Ware. Finally one sherd identified as Fourmile Polychrome was collected from a site where only one sherd of Gila Plain was found with Lower Colorado Buff Ware. In mixed-ceramic sites with a high percentage of Hohokam pottery, areal occupation by Hohokam peoples was likely. By contrast the quantity of Hohokam pottery found at mixed sites with a high ratio of Lower Colorado Buff Ware was usually of such small number that occupation by the Hohokam was doubtful. Yuman Lower Colorado Buff Ware sherds with no associated historic material were found at forty sites. Twenty-four sites had only Lower Colorado Buff Ware. Sixteen sites showed a mixture of Hohokam pottery and Lower Colorado Buff Ware; at nine of the sites Lower Colorado Buff Ware was more common, the reverse being true at the remaining seven sites. In addition, three pre- historic Lower Colorado Buff Ware sites reported by Breternitz (Arizona X:8: 1, Y:3:2 and Y: 3:3) were revisited and collections made. These sites were found throughout the survey area from the Muggins Mountains near Yuma to the Painted Rock Mountains. They occurred on both sides of the river, although they were more numerous on the northern bank. Sites between Yuma and the Agua Caliente Mountains were almost exclusively Lower Colorado Buff Ware sites. Gila Plain of Hohokam origin was collected at three sites (Arizona Y:3:25, Y:3:26 and Y:3:27) within a radius of three miles on the west side of the Agua Caliente Mountains. Scattered sherds of Hohokam pottery have been found further to the west in minor amounts. Both Schroeder and Breternitz record Gila Plain from Arizona X: 8:1 near Ante- lope Hill, but none was identified from the present survey collec- tion. From the Agua Caliente Mountains to the Painted Rock Mountains there was a mixture at most sites of Lower Colorado Buff Ware and Hohokam pottery. All sites were near the river and were usually above the river bottomlands, on a silt bank, or in the area of Oatman Mountain, on silt bars in rincons of the basalt flow (Fig. 11). Described physiographically, site location ranged from large stabilized sand dunes to eroded silt flats and gravel terraces. Whereas some dunes have become stabilized, others have eroded after stabilization and are characterized by eroded dune remnants with cultural material scattered over the dune and the surrounding flat. The final erosion 134</page><page sequence="41">of the dune leaves material scattered either on a level surface or in some cases on an erosion-cut flat. No correlation could be drawn between any ceramic series and the degree of dune erosion. No evidence of structures was found at any of the sites. These sites were characteristically marked by the presence of cracked stone in piles or scattered over the site area. These stones were usually fist-sized river cobbles, although larger stones were not uncommon. They were frequently shattered and probably repre- sent the contents of roasting pits or hearths excavated into the sand dunes. The mixture of Lower Colorado Buff Ware and Hohokam ceramics at the eastern end of the survey area has been noted. In addition a mixing of the Lower Colorado Buff Ware series was predictable at most sites throughout the survey area. Although specific geographical boundaries cannot be drawn for the cessa- tion of one series and the beginning of another, the present survey suggests that while mixture of the series is constant at both indi- vidual sites and throughout the survey area, proportions of certain series do increase or decrease spatially when plotted for the entire area. On the basis of these proportional changes three divisional areas were recognized. They are: 1) Painted Rocks Dam to Agua FIG. 11. Arizona S: 16:7. A typical mixed Yuman-Hohokam site on an eroded silt bar near the Gila River. 135</page><page sequence="42">Caliente Mountains, 2) Agua Caliente Mountains to Texas Hill and 3) Texas Hill to Yuma. It was realized that the borders may fluctuate widely, and may not exist at all, in view of the fact that collections were limited to sites near the river. It should be noted that sites were well represented in the first two divisions. Th third division, Texas Hill to Yuma, is under heavy cultivation and only six sites with pottery were recorded, as opposed to seventeen in division 2 and twenty in division 1. The Lower Gila Series, or pottery tempered with rounded to subangular sand, was found in all three divisions. It accounted for forty-one percent in division 1, sixty-five percent in division 2 and thirty-eight percent in division 3. Pottery tempered with sherd and sand was found in small but fairly constant amounts: one and one-half percent in division 1, three percent in division 2 and four percent in division 3. The Gila Bend Series was best represented from the Painted Rocks Dam to Agua Caliente, division 1, and accounted for fifty percent of the total count from that area. It decreased to thirteen percent in the second division, Agua Caliente to Texas Hill, and accounted for only three percent in the third division. The Palo Verde or sherd tempered series was the major series in the Texas Hill to Yuma division and made up fifty-five percent of the count. It decreased to only two percent in the middle divi- sion but increased to seven percent in the eastern division largely due to the number of sherds found at a few sites near the north- western tip of the Painted Rock Mountains. The Parker Series was best represented in the middle divi- sion from Agua Caliente to Texas Hill, where it accounted for sixteen and one-half percent of the sherds and was the second most common series found. Only one-half percent of this series was found in division 1 and it was absent in division 3. No evidence was found during the survey, nor can substantial evidence be drawn from survey data, which might give temporal significance to one or more of the ceramic series. Survey data does suggest that a pottery tempered with rounded to subangular sand, tentatively correlated with the Lower Gila Series, may have extended the entire length of the Lower Gila. It may be significant that most sherds of the series collected in the area from Agua Caliente to Texas Hill were from sites which were not only further from the river than usual, but were from dunes which often showed more weathering. Although the survey data does not suggest when it took place, there appears to have been a spread of basalt tempered pottery, the Gila Bend 136</page><page sequence="43">Series, from the east down the river toward the west, terminating in th area between the Agua Caliente Mountains and Texas Hill. Conversely, the Palo Verde Series or sherd tempered pottery is found most commonly in the western end of the survey area and probably spread to the east. The Parker Series, predominant in the middle division, cannot be shown to have spread from either east or west and may have been brought in via northern trade routes. Artifacts at these sites were scarce and many sites produced nothing more than a few sherds and scattered broken stone. Material found with only Lower Colorado Buff Ware did not differ significantly from that found in mixed sites. Chipped stone was rare and was represented by projectile points and scrapers. The two complete and two fragmentary pro- jectile points collected were from Arizona Y: 2:15 in a small blow- out in the face of one of the dunes. One projectile point was non-stemmed, triangular, straight based, and made of chert, while the other specimen was of obsidian, stemmed and side notched with expanding notched base. The two obsidian fragments were not identifiable as to type. Scrapers were side or end scrapers with unifacial chipping. Materials used included jasper, chert, and obsidian. Chopping tools were common in sites with a high proportion of Lower Colorado Buff Ware. All were manufactured from quartzite river cobbles and were classed as either flake or core choppers. The former, which have some resemblance to mescal knives, do not appear to have been pressure flaked and the small irregularly spaced chips on the cutting edges are probably use marks. The core choppers retain the general shape of the original cobble with several large flakes removed from one or both ends. Some specimens show pounding marks on one end. Hammerstones are of river cobbles and differ from the chop- pers only in that no flakes were removed and use marks are limited to scars on the pounding surfaces. River cobbles were also employed as one-handed manos. The one shaped mano was oval, and while both faces were ground one was concave. Other unshaped manos showed grinding marks on one or both surfaces. Two fragments of vesicular basalt metates were of such small size that the type could not be determined. Shell was found scattered throughout the survey area, but a definite concentration was noted from the Agua Caliente Moun- tains to the Painted Rock Mountains where it was commonly found at sites which showed a mixture of Lower Colorado Buff 137</page><page sequence="44">Ware and Hohokam pottery. Included in the collections were whole, worked, and fragments of Olivella and Conus shells. Glycymeris shells were found in an unaltered state, with per- foration through the umbo for suspension and most commonly as fragments of bracelet. Only fragments of Cardium shell were found, as well as an unidentified bivalve with an iridescent interior. A gastropod spiral cut for a bead was collected at Ari- zona X: 8:6. A bone awl with both point and base missing was found at Arizona Y:4:3. It was made from the split and ground long bone of a small mammal. Miscellaneous items collected from these sites included one small chunk of unworked turquoise from Ari- zona Y:3:14 and fish vertebrae from sites Y:2: 15-B and Y:3:21. Hohokam Twenty-five sites were distinguished by the presence of Hohokam pottery. Of the twenty-five, nine had only Hohokam pottery. Seven of the remaining sixteen sites showed a pre- dominance of Hohokam pottery, while the other nine had more Lower Colorado Buff Ware. Sites with Hohokam pottery extended from the Painted Rock Mountains to approximately three miles west of the Agua Caliente Mountains. A single sherd of Gila Plain was found at Arizona Y:3:8 in the vicinity of Big Ethel Wash, and this same type was found by Breternitz and Schroeder near Antelope Hill. By far the greatest concentration of Hohokam sites was within the Dendora Valley bounded on the east by the Painted Rocks Mountains and on the west by the Oatman Mountain basalt flow. With the exception of Arizona Y: 3:8, Hohokam sites were located on the north bank of the river. These sites were commonly marked by material eroding from a silt or gravel flat on the river edge or on the first terrace above the river. Hohokam sites were seldom situated near a dune area, but dunes were not common in the Dendora Valley. Most sites covered approximately one acre. By contrast, S:16:22 was considerably larger than most sites and covered twenty to twenty-five acres. The area encompassed by this site was readily distinguishable as erosion had cleared the surface resulting in the exposure of cultural material. Site areas were characterized by scattered sherds. Cracked stones found on Lower Colorado Buff Ware sites did not occur frequently, but were present at S:16:22 and S:16:23, both mixed-ceramic sites. 138</page><page sequence="45">Features at these sites were limited to trash mounds at S:16:21 and S:16:32, and cremations at S:16:22, S:16:23 and S16:32. The trash mounds were low and did not rise more than two feet above ground level. Cremations were detected by the presence of burned bone and charcoal fragments eroding on the surface. A cremation discovered at S:16:22 contained a number of burned Olivella shell beads and a tubular stone pipe. Of four hundred and twenty Hohokam sherds fifty-four percent were Gila Plain and thirty percent were the Gila Bend Variety of Gila Plain. Separation of the variety from the type was based on Johnson and Wasley who advised that "The presence of quantities of mica in the paste of Gila Plain is its major diag- nostic feature. The local Gila Bend variety of Gila Plain is dis- tinguished from Gila Plain by the fact that it has less or no mica as a component of the paste" (Johnson and Wasley 1961: 24). This type and its variant were found at all Hohokam sites and were, with one exception, the only Hohokam sherds found at mixed-ceramic sites with a high percentage of Lower Colorado Buff Ware. The few decorated sherds found were: Gila Butte Red-on- Buff, 4%; Santa Cruz Red-on-Buff, 2%; Sacaton Red-on-Buff, 1%; Sweetwater Red-on-Gray, .5%; and Snaketown Red-on-Buff, .5%. Tanque Verde Red-on-Brown sherds accounted for three percent of all Hohokam sherds but these sherds were all from S:16:13 and were the only Hohokam sherds present. Non-ceramic material from Hohokam sites without Lower Colorado Buff Ware was practically negligible. Four one-handed manos were recovered from Arizona Y:3:8. Artifacts found at sites where Hohokam pottery was pre- dominant included three sherd discs fashioned from Gila Plain, Santa Cruz Red-on-Buff and Trincheras Purple-on-Red. Glycy- meris shell bracelet fragments were collected from three sites. The artifacts from Arizona S:16:22 included a large chip of tubular stone bead, a bifacially chipped knife of chert, frag- ments of Cardium shell and Glycymeris bracelets, an Oliva shell bead, bits of unidentified shell, and the Olivella shell beads and stone pipe from the cremation previously noted. The tubular stone pipe (Fig. 8b) is 9 cm. in length, 2 cm. in diameter at the proximal end and expands to 4 cm. at the dis- tal end. The pipe was drilled from the distal end to within approximately 1 cm. of the proximal end where drilling was reversed. The bowl is wide (2.2 cm. interior diameter) for a 139</page><page sequence="46">depth of approximately 1.5 cm. but then constricts. The interior diameter of the proximal end is .4 cm. The pipe was decorated with an encircling incised line .4 cm. below the distal end. Rim notches extend from the encircling line to the bowl edge. Other simple geometric designs on the body of the pipe consist of two incised lines, horizontal to the long axis of the pipe, separated by, though not connected with, two parallel lines. The horizontal lines are fringed with shorter lines extending upward at an angle. A small disc-like plug of fired clay was found inside the pipe. One edge of the plug is slightly beveled for a more secure fit. The size of the plug indicated that it fit near the proximal end. Two known references to pipe plugs are that of Kaemlein who reported a similarly plugged pipe from the Bluff site in the Forestdale Valley, Arizona (Kaemlein 1958: 25), and that of Kidder, who found plugged ceramic pipes at Pecos (Kidder (1932: pp. 156-157, Fig. 154, f, g). While Hohokam sites were few in number and Hohokam pottery accounted for only twenty-five percent of the total sherds collected, data from the survey were valuable for establishing the western fringe of the Hohokam on the Gila River. Although occasional Hohokam sherds were found to the west of the Agua Caliente Mountains, nothing indicated that occupation by the Hohokam west of these mountains was more than sporadic. Evi- dence was poor for Hohokam settlements beyond the Dendora Valley and survey data would suggest that Hohokam occupation of the area under consideration was intensive during the Gila Butte and Santa Cruz phases and extended no further than the Palomas Plains. NON-CERAMIC SITES Lithic A lithic site, Arizona Y:3:7, was discovered on a southern gravel terrace above the Gila River. Implements were found eroding from a sand dune on the terrace top. The tools, fashioned from river cobbles, included core choppers with primary flaking and flake choppers. In addition to the choppers, hammerstones and a one-handed mano were collected. Trail Arizona X: 8:3 was the only trail site recorded within the survey area. It was located on a terrace above the river bottom- lands and could be followed in the desert pavement for several 140</page><page sequence="47">FIG. 12. Petroglyphs on volcanic boulders at Painted Rocks in the Dendora Valley, Arizona. hundred feet, terminating where the terrace was cut by small washes. One worked sherd of Lower Colorado Buff Ware and one core chopper were found along this trail. Cremation Cremated human bone was recovered from sand dunes at Arizona Y:2:12. The partially calcified bone was eroding from packed sand. No grave offerings were associated with the bone, and no ceramic material was found in the sand dunes, although a fragment of a cardium (?) shell was collected. Petroglyphs Petroglyphs occurred at six sites, two of which, Arizona X:8:4 and X:8:7 were previously located by Schroeder. Petro- glyphs were pecked into boulders on the terrace at X:8:3 and X:8:2, on the volcanic outcrops at Radium Springs, X:8:4, and volcanic cliffs at S:16:16 and Y:4:2. Sandstone boulders were utilized on the north slope of Antelope Hill, X: 8: 7. Designs were similar to those at Painted Rocks (Fig. 12). The most common motifs were ovals, circles, concentric circles, circles connected by straight lines, spirals, and meandering lines with or without circles at one or both ends of the line. 141</page><page sequence="48">Short squiggles and anthropomorphic stick figures were common. A bird, and possible bird or animal tracks occurred at X:8:4, as well as a shape resembling a serrated spearhead in which circles were executed as solid forms. Modern incised names were present at Antelope Hill (X:8:7), one of the most legible being "1908 Freelan Neahr". SUMMARY An archaeological survey of the Lower Gila River, under- taken to locate sites endangered by proposed changes in the river channel produced 85 historic and prehistoric sites. It was determined that channel alterations will destroy some archaeo- logical areas and endanger others. More importantly, this survey illustrated the need for salvage work beyond the channel project. It was evident that site loss resulting from channel changes would be minor compared to the extensive destruction of sites by cultivation, made possible by channel clearing and irriga- tion projects. Approximately 100 sites on the lower Gila River below the Painted Rock Dam have been reported by Schroeder (1952), Breternitz (1957) and this writer. Most of these re- mains will be destroyed by channel projects or eventual culti- vation. A review of data from the present survey will indicate the information that would be lost. Anglo American occupation of the area was evidenced by 12 sites. Treatment of historic American material was not always consistent, however, and a purely historic survey would no doubt disclose many more sites representative of American settlement on the river. On the other hand, a number of docu- mented historic sites, including several stage stations, were searched for but not found. This site loss can probably be attributed to the periodic Gila floods which markedly alter the valley floor. The sites found reflected the varied interests of Americans in the Gila River valley. These included mining at Gila City, farming at Palomas, ranching at Fourr's Cabin, daming the Gila at Oatman Mountain for irrigation, and stage travel on the Butterfield Overland Route. The 73 Indian sites recorded were representative of both historic and prehistoric use of the river valley. Remains of several recent Papago settlements and single units were scattered throughout the survey area. A cluster of Western Yavapai camps near Palomas marked a brief period of Yavapai occupa- 142</page><page sequence="49">tion on the river in historic times. In addition, several historic camps occupied by an unidentified Yuma speaking people were located. Prehistoric remains were the most numerous recorded. Occa- sional non-ceramic sites were located, primarily petroglyphic, but most sites were pottery bearing. Lower Colorado Buff Ware sites, usually located in sand dunes or silt flats, extended from near Dome to the Painted Rock Dam. Temper differences in this pottery from west to east were noted and appeared to coincide with several of Schroeder's Series in this Ware. The quantity of material at these sites suggested that many were occupied per- manently. Prehistoric remains at the eastern end of the survey area were largely Hohokam. Small habitation sites with associated refuse mounds dating from the Colonial Period were the most common. The survey revealed that the archaeological potential of the the Lower Gila River is greater than has been suspected. As recently as 1962, Schroeder (1952: 52) wrote that ". . . occupational evidence on the Lower Gila is scant, thinly spaced, and in the nature of trail camp sites only". Five years later Breternitz (1957: 12) reported additional sites on the river, some of which he believed were occupied permanently. He was not able how- ever, ". . . to establish any clear cut (ceramic) series distribution along the Lower Gila River.", and concluded that the Lower Gila River region presented ". .. a picture of mixed ceramic (cultural) relationships". This picture began to change when Schroeder's survey of the Painted Rocks Reservoir revealed permanent occupation of the Reservoir area, and four patterns, or periods of occupation within this area. We believe that the most recent survey data indicates that the cultural picture on the entire Lower Gila River is equally as complex. In brief, our survey has revealed that the Lower Gila River was occupied extensively and intensively for a long, but undetermined, period of time. Permanent or semi-permanent sites on the Gila were common and indicated more than temporary use of the river, although utilization of the river valley as a route of travel was of prime importance. Some patterning in ceramic distribution along the river was evident, though it was not always clear cut. Hohokam pottery was largely restricted to the area east of the Palomas Plains, and most frequently, types were of the Gila Butte and Santa 143</page><page sequence="50">Cruz phases. Occupation by the Hohokam in this region after A.D. 1150 is a matter of controversy. Until the cultural affiliation of sites with the Gila Bend Series of Lower Colorado Buff Ware is resolved by excavation and study, no definite statement can be made. The Gila Bend Series, as determined by the survey, was centered in the area from the Painted Rock Mountain to Agua Caliente. Generally, sites sites with this pottery appeared to represent permanent or semi-permanent occupation on silt bars along the river prior to historic times. The mixture of Hohokam ceramics with this series at these sites may reflect reoccupation of the same area. The Lower Gila Series seemed well established in the area from the Painted Rock Mountains to Antelope Hill. Although this series was occasionally found with historic material, the impression gained from the survey was that Lower Gila Series remains predated historic contact, were permanent or semi- permant sand dune habitation sites, and represented the major prehistoric occupation of the Lower Gila River from the Painted Rock Mountains to Antelope Hill. The Palo Verde Series was found on dune sites at the west- ern end of the survey area. Few of these sites remain as a result of cultivation, but it is probable that they were once as numerous as those in uncultivated areas to the east. Like other Lower Colo- rado Buff Ware sites these were undoubtedly occupied on at least a semi-permanent basis. The greatest concentration of the Parker Series was in the vicinity of Palomas. Historic and ethnographic sources suggest that this pottery may have been made by the Mohave and carried to the Palomas - Agua Caliente region via the Cibola - Agua Caliente Trail for trade with Western Yavapai. Western Yavapai occupation at Palomas and Agua Caliente after 1900 is well documented. 144</page><page sequence="51">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Several persons helped to make this report more complete, and I would like to thank them at this time. Albert "Buck" Wynn of Yuma, Arizona reported several sites near Yuma, which we included in our survey. Help in the identification of historic materials was generously given by Arthur Woodward, by Mrs. Ralph G. Vaughan, who examined the glass and bottle fragments, and by J. E. Hartill, Managing Director of Mintons Ltd., who provided detailed information on Minton bone china. Richard G. Sense, graduate student at the University of Arizona, Department of Anthropology, made a petrographic analysis of pottery tempers and answered my many questions regarding the geology of the area surveyed. Albert Schroeder, Archaeologist for the National Park Service, furnished data relevant to Lower Colorado Buff Ware and checked the identification of a number of sherds. In addition valuable comments were offered by Dr. William Wasley and Dr. Bernard Fontana of the Arizona State Museum and by Cameron Greenleaf. The photographs used in this paper were furnished by Dr. Wasley, Dr. Fontana and Douglas Lindsay, photographer for the Arizona State Museum.
