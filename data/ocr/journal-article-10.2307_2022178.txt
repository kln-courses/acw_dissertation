<plain_text><page sequence="1">614 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY BOOK REVIEW Nature and Judgment. JUSTus BUCHLER. New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1955. 199 pp. Nature and Juidgment continues the project initiated in To- ward a General Theory of Human Judgment, to explore what it means to be a human individual, "to arrange what emerges from the study of man in nature with the greatest possible breadth." Human "products" are the focus of attention, and Nature is treated tangentially as the scene and partner of that process we call the human beiing. "The principal problem is to define the generic conditions and properties of the human product. By a product I understand anything at all that issues from human life or human relationship-and I conceive every product as a judg- ment." The chief difference between Natutre and Judgmnet and its predecessor is in the way the themes are treated rather than in the themes discussed. Its manner is more discursive, relaxed, informal, and relatively concrete. Less formidable use is made of the tech- iiical vocabulary of the earlier work, and considerable effort is made to explain the use of technical terms and their relations to terms in ordinary every-day or philosophical use. His theses are more discursively elaborated in terms of comparisons with other philo- sophic statements, Dewey's and Whitehead's especially. The book consists of four long chapters, the first of which, "Judgment," elaborates the concept of judgment (allied with the notion of "product") as the element and unit of human action. The second chapter, "Query," offers a generalized account of human action where judgments became elaborated methodically. Chapters 3 and 4 take up the exposition of a generalized theory of experience and of meaning, respectively. Man is born with and acquires "natural obligations "-com- mitments, needs, aims-which reveal themselves and are cumu- latively shaped with respect to form, content, and direction by the process of associational living. The meeting of these obligations takes the form of choices and avoidances. These choices are termed "products," "utterances," or "ijudgments." Judgments constitute the active dimension of "proception" (or, loosely, experi- ence). These, when supplemented by the passive aspects of ex- perience-relations and events that happen to the individual,- constitute the "proceptive domain" (the experienced world of the individual). The basic modes of judgment are doings, makings, and sayings. Art, morality, and science are "grand products"; they are developments and transformations of what is found in</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEW 615 the simplest forms of action, in the simplest exemplifications of choice and assertion. The unity of human nature is found in the unity of these judgments and the unity of experienced nature is likewise found here, for they are but two sides of the same coin. The judgments of an iindividual are not atomic and isolated. They form in every individual "general attitudes" which are dispositional formative factors of individual products and at the same time cumulative resultants of individual judgments. In relation to these attitudes, judgments are what are expressed of the individual; they are the forms which general attitudes and general positions of the individual take. It follows from this that assertions about nature are not only declarative but inherently appraisive. A judgment about nature expresses the" stance" of the individual, what he is, what his positioln is. A judgment is a pronouncement on the world and reflexively oni the individual. The conception of "genleral attitude" has this basic dual signifi- cance for Professor Buehler's treatment of experience. It is signifi- cant for the definition of the unity of the individual and it is in the matrix of his iinterpretation of the interrelatedness of judg- ments within a mode and between modes of judgment which to- gether constitute the experienced world. All interpretation, mak- ing, description are pronouncements or applied attitudes and they are also appraisals. "To run from a situationi is, indifferently, to pronounce it as danigerous or to appraise it as dangerous. To describe an object as red is, indifferently, to pronounce on the presence or absence of a giveln color, or to appraise a color as de- serving or not deserving a given predicate" (p. 14). The re- jection of a hard and fast separation of modes of judgment is basic to Professor Buchler's argument. There is not only an iinherent fusion of the descriptive and the evaluative or the expressive, but also an opposition by the author to the distinction, if taken as ultimate, between "prizing" and "appraisal." Appraisal is pres- ent in the simplest prizing as it is in the simplest pronouncement. Purposeful, methodical behavior constitutes "query." Query is the generic name given to all forms of methodical behavior- making, doing, assertiin. It is in essence interrogative behavior, the questioning aspect of any process, anid it is found in all three modes of judgment, not only in the assertive or scientific. The persistent theme of Professor Buehler's treatment of query is that "scientific" inquiry is not the sole mode or model of inquiry. The forms which query takes in art and morals are as fundamental and inderived as is the form of assertive inquiry found in science. They are not to be regarded as attenuated, distorted, or cryptic forms of the assertive mode. In all developed human enterprises.</page><page sequence="3">616 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY in science, art, and morals, all modes of query actually co6perate and fuse. As judgment is generalized to include all active experience and as query is an extended concept of intelligence applied equally to feeling, action, and assertion, so meaning is approached in terms that permit three equally legitimate modes, with cointinuity andi co6peration between the modes. Assertive judgnmeilt is not the exclusive domain of meaning and the miieaning( present in other modes is not primarily of an assertive character. In short, op- position to a too-limited view of meaning dominates the discus- sion. Even Peirce s view of meaning is criticized as overly nar- row in conception. For Professor Buehler any procept or experi- enice becomes a meaning or ineaningrful when, as a first condition. it becomes a fully actualized judgment, that is, when it plays a role or function within an organized experience, a prospective domain- or, more specifically, within a "perspective" of a perspective do- nain. An item of experience or a judgrment reaches its full status as a meaning when the role it plays is one of "articulating per- spective" by identifying. predicting, describing, or disclosing other judgments in a perspective and in the disclosingo a perspec- tive itself. The emphasis upon articulation is important, for to articuilate is more than to denote what is already giveni; it helps to constitute and to create as well. Within this broadeiled concept of the conditions of meaning, all modes of judgrment emerge as vehicles of mleaning, for they all, potentially, make available some order or perspective within which the meaningful procept is an element. And again, as in query, all modes of meaning arc likely to be present in some degree in any complex activity. Professor Buehler is elaborating a "transactional" view of man in nature, to use the term appropriated among others by Dewey. This transactional orientation places the author in the stream of philosophers runniilg from Aristotle through Peirce, Dewey, White- head. The author is concerned to make clear the relations be- tween the positions taken in these books to those philosophers with- in this broad tradition. The transactional perspective is especially important in Professor Buchler's analysis of the individual human being and experience in terms of "proception" and the correlative notions of "procept," "proceive," and "proceptive domain." Experience as something uniquely mental or accruing addi- tively to behavior is not taken as fundamental or as fruitful by Professor Buchler. His starting point, like that of Dewey, is experience as a process. "Life," he quotes Dewey, "is no unin- terrupted march or flow. It is a thing of histories, with its own plot." For Dewey any experience is inherently a temporal proc-</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEW 617 ess, a transactiou marked by individuality. While in agreement wvith this emphasis Professor Buehler is concerned to define the larger unity of the individual. "But the living individual as such has a history and this history has certainly an uninterrupted flow and it is the nature of this history or process that is most in need of investigation . . . we shall name the process in question proceptionl or the proceptive process and describe the individual in question as a proceiving individual or proceiver" (p. 110). Ex- perience, as Dewey uses the term, has all the characteristics of proception but is largely restricted to histories within the history of the individual; proception is the name given to the total proc- ess which emerges. lt is similar to experience but broader. The key-note characteristics of experience as Dewey approaches it are retained, however. To proceive, as to experience, is "not some- thing done to something else or visited upon something else"; it is "an entire relation with its relata and [does] not imply that something, has become an object of an act." "At the risk of initial imprecision let 'proception' suggest the inseparable union of process and receptivity, all movement in nature with impact by nature, of things shaped with events accepted. The emphasis is on historicity and natural involvement" (p. 111). "Proception," he goes on to state, "is needed to identify and to preserve con- ceptually the precise character of individual historicity, individ- uated process." So, also, congruent with this, "the term 'pro- cept' is needed to identify and to fix the status of a natural complex that enters into this process." "Proception is the actualization of procepts." The unity of subject and object, or rather the fact that subject and object are dimensions of a totality, that process and continuity are essential traits, is a primary emphasis of Pro- fessor Buehler. This mutual involvement through a temporal process of individ- ual and environment, of subject and object, as well as the other characteristics mentioned, is of course emphasized in the notion of "organism" of Whitehead. The orientations at this general level of Whitehead and Buchler exhibit extensive family resemblances. Indeed, somewhere between Whitehead and Dewey is the direc- tion Professor Buchler appears to be taking. In many ways his sympathies lie more with Dewey than with Whitehead, but Dewey's orientation is too humanistic and insufficiently ontological. In the area of proception Buchler is aware of the artificiality of White- head's solution of the problem of the individual autonomy and of the need to avoid this; at the same time he is concerned with the threat to individuality from the other side as represented by James' and Dewev's emphasis on pluralism. This does not mean</page><page sequence="5">618 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY that the orientation is eclectic, joining in marriage the two philoso- phies; rather, Professor Buchler finds difficulties often of an op- posite character in both Dewey and Whitehead. Starting with the same orientation, however, Buchler is attempting to articu- late the characteristics of man, nature, and their inter-relations so that the weaknesses of both philosophers receive a common cor- rection. The adequate characterization of individuality is a major case in point. The individuality of processes, such as that of the life history of a human being, is threatened in the direction of atomism by the pluralism of Dewey and the monism of mutual iinvolvement of every event with all events in Whitehead. In agreement with both, Professor Buchler insists that individuality needs definition within the context of the fact that "man is characterized by a state of natural debt, by a perpetual incompleteness." This fact "does not cast doubt on the existence of individuals but emphasizes only the extended nature of individuality, it's communicative es- sence, and the indefinite bounds of its relatedness" (p. 106). It does, however, cast doubt if the involvement of processes is such that as with Whitehead every actual entity is present in every other actual entity. "Repugnance to the doctrine of disconnected substances need imply not the opposite doctrine but the more con- servative likelihood that an individual can be present in other in- dividuals. We require, then, to avoid two positions: that of anthropomorphism, by limiting 'experience' to human individuals; and that of the doctrine of internal relations, by not merely admit- ting degrees of relevance, but so couching the conception of ex- perience as to recognize a meaning for irrelevance" (pp. 106-107). To this latter task a considerable part of the third chapter "Experience," is devoted. A general theory of experience is developed in such a w ay as to define, interpret, and translate into the conceptual family of proception notions such as "funded experience," "awareness," "having and undercoing experience," and the like. In these terms also an effort is made to clear up confusions, contradictions, vaguenesses, and to correct over- and under-extended notions within the philosophical tradition that takes experience as fundamental. Little space is taken to point up the inadequacies of those philosophic positions that do not take as basic the orientation of experience as transaction, such as traditional empiricism and rationalism. One general answer offered to preserve individuality in re- latedness is to distinguish three or more "worlds," concentrically arranged: "the first world (the indefinite whole of nature) is the entire actual and possible world past, present and future; the</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEW 619 second (his world) is the world without which a given individual would not be (as illustration, sun and air in so far as it affects every process-' the world that sustains his existence along with other existences') ; the third, the proceptive domain (or content of an individual's experience), is the world without which he would not be what he is" (p. 120). The latter world is not equiv- alent to consciousness or conscious experience. None of the larger worlds are unavailable in principle, for they may all become rele- vant to the uniqueness of the individual. While this summary statement on relevant relatedness and degrees of relatedness cruelly oversimplifies the discussion, it does indicate the direction of Professor Buehler's treatment, and it illus- trates the affinity with Dewey as well as the difference in level of analysis with Whitehead. A "meaning for relevance" is qualita- tively clarified by Buchler, but it is neither rendered as precise nor given the technical scope which Whitehead gives to his analysis of relatedness. Whitehead's prehension does leave every event, in- cluding that of the human individual, internally related to all events. It is doubtful whether the doctrine of perspectives, per- perspective elimination, and prehensive unity does more than complicate the situation. At the end it leaves one with some of James' feelings of claustrophobia. Professor Buchler avoids this in intent, but he does so by the looser method of allowing concepts like potentiality to do the work of keeping degrees of irrelevance significant, and there is in this the danger that, without his realiz- ing it, the notions of consciousness and awareness creep in to make the distinction between the "worlds," something he wishes to avoid. Terms like " affect,'" related to,"" involved in " are discussed and illustrated (pp. 121, 143 ff.), but no comprehensive or systematic analysis is made. Instead, a defenise of "involved in" as a central term is made by contrasting it with alternatives for the relation of the individual and his environment, such as subject-object. Dimen- sions of the phrase are made explicit, but it is left open-ended in meaning and has only implicit definition. Whether when Professor Buchler carries forward this analysis both in exactness and in its application to other individualities he will avoid the difficulties to be found in AWhitehead's treatment remains an open question. One notes a recurrent issue here, however. Related and analogous prob- lems arise with respect to his efforts to establish a broadened con- ception of experience, of meaningr, of judrment (and in the previ- ous book, of "perspective") while yet restricting these notions to human beings and avoiding anthropomorphism. Proception is, for Buchler, definitely something constituting the human enterprise. At times this appears to be only a provisional</page><page sequence="7">620 THE JOURNAL OF' PHILOOSOPHY limitation of attention, but it is more. It is intended, as it were, metaphysically. Professor Buehler is concerned to limit the notion of proception to human experience. On the other hand, procep- tion is consistently described as a natural complex with internal relations to its lived environment, its proceptual domain. He in- tends, that is, to correct overrestricted analyses of experience. The mode of analysis used with respect to proception seems highly congruent with that which Whitehead uses for all processes generally. Yet Whitehead is criticized for the overgeneralization. The possible disparity between the orientation and the intended conclusions drawn within that orientation is deepened when one connects Professor Buehler's treatment of meaning and of judg- ment with that of experience. Any product of human behavior, every "utterance" whether conscious, unconscious, spontaneous, random is an instance of judgment though not of "query," which is a more limited dimension of the proceptive process. Products are judgments because they involve selection, discrimination, exclu- sion, determinateness; they involve, however simple, an appraisive dimension. Judgments, as we have seen, need not involve the as- sertive mode, since the active and expressive modes have equal primacy for defining a judgment. But if this is the case and if none of the usual limitations such as consciousness, purpose, assertive judgments are required, it becomes a problem to determine how Buehler 's treatment of experience as constituted by judgments differs in extensioin from Whitehead's. It would seem to apply to any organlized process whatever, human or not. The problem of limits shows up on the other side when the criticism of Whitehead referred to is placed in juxtaposition with the criticism made of Dewey's treatment of experience. Though Dewey is credited with making helpful and extensive revisions in the orthodox attachment of experience to the mental, he is, nonetheless, charged with the error he seeks to correct, namely, overintellectualizing experience, converting expressive and active modes of judgrments into cryptic forms of the assertive. The criticism is that, for Dewey, "an experience" which involves the intellectual or assertive is inade the paradigm of experience. He finds it also in the distinction Dewey makes between gross experi- ence and the refined objects of experience, a product of inquiry. There is also the fact that, for Dewey, wlhat makes experience to be significant is the utilization of occurrences within an end-means, or antecedent-coinsequence, or part-whole perpective. While it is a moot question whether Dewey has, in this criticism, been sympathetically read, and whether to an extent not recognized bv Professor Buehler, he himself does not have or would be forced</page><page sequence="8">BOOK REVIEW 621 to have a positioll very close to that of Dewey if he is to avoid the Whiteheadian, the criticism does seem to place Professor Buch- ler very close to the position of Whitehead. The chapter oni meaning again illustrates the tension. Professor Buchler holds that there may be meaning in situations where com- munication is present only in the broadest sense and where meaning does not directly involve sign functions, either in the narrower sense of acting as proxy or in the broader sense where the sign function exists only in the sense of something acting- as an "in- strument fostering judgment." The element of awareness is not a necessary conditioin; and acting and making as well as asserting are modes of meaning. How then, the question arises, does mean- ing so broadly construed in its range and colnditions differ from a procept (any event that enters into an individualized history) '? Professor Buchler raises this as a problem and proposes to resolve it by adding further conditions for any procept (experienced entity) to function as a meaning. In general, the chief factor, and the one that sums up his approach to meaning, is that it functions to " articulate an order or perspective" of which it is an element. The perspective need not be mental or assertive, however, but may be an order of acts or contrivances. The discussion of " perspective ' and "articulatioi)" is among the best and most fruitful parts of the book, but with respect to the central question of why any pro- cept is not a meaning, this reviewer is not clear. To point up the issue. Whitehead would, in Buchler's terms, identify proception aind meaning and he would make proception categorical for existence geinerally and w-ould not restrict it to human experience. He would finally, make "meaning" a funda- mental relation between events. For reasons that Professor Buch- ler makes clear, one might not be happy with this position, but it may be that Whitehead is simply carrying to its logical conclu- sion the inherent dialectic of the orientation which Professor Buch- ler shares. The basic ambiguity here discussed is suggested by the title of the book, Nature and Judgment. Why is not the title restricted by the term "Human"? The concern of the book is certainly with human nature and judgment. Yet the concern appears at times to be but a paradigm of all natural process, all transactions. and as such justifies the broader title. The problem of individuality and of the scope of judgment, experience, inquiry, and meaninoy which we have emphasized in this review are certainly central problems in this book, but with- in the concern and discussion of these topics, Professor Buchler has included considerable material. His commeints on prevailing</page><page sequence="9">622 TIHE JOURNAL OFi PHIILOSOPIHY philosophies and problems, though not made in a form which will have much effect on those against whom they are directed, are often illuminating, and for one familiar with the writings of Peirce, Dewey, Santayana, and Whitehead there is much here that is clarifying both with respect to these philosophers and with respect to the positioin which Professor Buehler is elaborating. On the whole it is, though difficult, a very rewardingf book and deserves careful study. EDWIN N. GARLAN REED COLLEGE</page></plain_text>
