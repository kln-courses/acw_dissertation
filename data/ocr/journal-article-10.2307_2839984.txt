HAROLD PEAKE.- The Finnic Problem.--The modern inhabitants of Fiilland contain both Nordic and Mongoloid elements, but the balance of evidence tends to show that the language and tradition are derived from the Asiatic element. A fresh examination of the archwological evidence seems to show that the first wave of these Mongoloid people arrived in the Baltic region on the retreat of the Ice Sheet, and were responsible for the Maglemose culture, which developed later into that known as East ScandinaVian or Arctic. Towards the close of the Neolithic Age the Nordic people arrived in Denmark from the Russian Steppes, and advaniced into Scania and Westergotland, driving before them the Maglemose-Arctic folk, who retreated to the north, whiere they survive as Lapps. Further Mongoloid tribes were well established at the junction of the Oka and the Volga early in the Bronze Age. In the middle [ 155 ]</page><page sequence="2">No. 83.] MAN. [iOctober, 1919. of that period they were occupying the margins of the Finnish lakes, and at the same time Nordics from Sweden were occupying the Baltic seaboard. In the fifth century B.C. the Nordics took to the fjords alid to piraey, and there was a geueral movement to the south and west. Meanwhile the Mongoloid tribes occupied the whole of Finiland, the Baltic provinces, and East Prussia. When, abollt A.D. 1000, the period of piracy ceased, fresh Nordic immigrants arrived, from Sweden, who were the ancestors of the present Nordic population of Finland. Miss M. A. CZAPLICKA.-History and Ethnology in Central Asia.-Otir existing classification for Eastern Europe and North and Central Asia, is based on historical rather than ethnological data. In the " Ural-Altaic " group are included five " races "- Finnic, Turkic, Tungusic, Samoyedic, and Mongolic-who are said to be linguistically alike but, otherwise, to form separate races. But the "Mongolie race " cannot be shown to form a distinct group in the same sense as the other four; arid its appearance in the saine ranks with Turks and Finns is due to the ethnologists' uncritical adoption of the history of the Jinghis Khan period. Ethnologically the Mongols form a bridge betweeni the Tunguis and the Turks, originating in a mixture of those two races on the steppes of Mongolia. Another misleading term "Tatars," is simply a name of Tungusic origin for a clan which at the time of Jinghis Khan belonged to the same confederacy as did the Mongol clan. REV. FRANCIS A. ALLEN.- Traces of Polynesian, Mlelanesian, and Australoid Elements in Primitive 4meriea.-The writer brought forward evidence to support the view that Melanesian, Polynesian, and Australoid stocks are represented in the native populations of America. PROFESSOR H. J. FLEIJRE.--A Comparison oj an Ancient and a Surviving Type of Man.--Geographical study of anthropological types in modern populations has revealed nests of persons resembling in maniy ways types of pre-Neolithic periods, especially Combe Capelle and closely related examples. A. number of skulls from long barrows in Britain, from certain French dolmens (Bas Moulins and Billancourt) and from Swedish megalithic graves show a grading from Combe Capelle characters to Nordic. Modern representatives of these characters have been found in Somaliland, Abyssinia, and Egypt, Sardinia, Tras-os-Montes, Portugal, North Italy, the Rhone Valley, Austria, Runmania, Russia, and India. About twenty-four cases have been studiedl in the vicinity of Plynlymon and in remoter parts of S.W. Wales, all men of pure local descent. There is thus a strong presumption that we have a persistent type. Most of the individuals noticed in Wales have the lhair rather straight with low orbital index and prominence of the zygomatics. But rare individuals witlh marked prognathism have the hair very curly, and suggest a "negroid character." The latter character is emphasized by Giiuffrida-Ruggeri in the name "Eurafrican type." F. G. PARSONS;.-The Physical Characteristics oJ the Modern Briton.-The author invited discussion as to the most valuable and practical data in determining the charac- teristics of the modern inhabitants of the British Isles. The following were suggested as especially significant in view of an analysis of the data at present available :-The cranial and cephalic index, attention being called to the fact that the index of the British Isles is the lowest in Europe ; the orbital index and the orbita'l height, the latter being valuable as a means of discriminating between the Nordic and Mediterranean types; the cranial heights and facial indices; standardized orthogonal projections of the normae of skulls; stature and its quick reaction to environment; eye colour and the presence of browii pigment in hair anid skin colour; and the features, especially the contour of the nose.

DUDLEY BUXTON.- The Anthropology of Cyprus.-Froim head measure- ments of the living it would appear that the population of the villages investigated falls ilnto two groups which cannot as yet, however, be differentiated with certainty into the Alpine and Mediterranean types. Anl examination of a short series of ancient skulls affords evidence that the ancient types correspond with the modern. E. WV. PEARSON CHINNERY.-Some Glimpses of Unknown Papua.-The com- munities of woolly-lhaired people discovered in recent years in the mountain regions -of New Guinea are distinctly shorter than those of the bush lowlands. who in tiurn differ physically from the coastal people. It will be found on further investigation tnat a Negrito-Papuan element exists also in the tribes of the Owen Stanley Range, all of which appear physically to be the results of a mixture between earlier stocks of short and tall light-yellow and dark-skinned peoples. ARCHAEOLOGY. R. R. MARETT.-Recent Archceological Discoveries in the Channnel Islands.- (1) La Cotte de St. Brelade.-A cuttingf 12 feet deep has been driven from outside the entrance along the W. wall of the cave. Immediately beyond the entrance there existed in Mousterian times a sloping platform, where flint-knapping operations were carried on. Above 500 pieces, ranging in quality from mere workshop refuse to highly finished implements, have already been unearthed here. In the vicinity is a rich rodent bed, which presents some peculiar features. Grotte de la Belle Hougue.-A cave has been discovered which, may be, contains Pliocene remains. The finds includie shells of various species, the most interesting of which is Astralium rugosum, at present confined to more Southern waters; and teetb, bones, and numerous pieces of antler belonging to Cervidee, which Dr. Andrews is at present disposed to bring into close relation with Cervus Etueriarum and Cervus Issiodorensis, Pliocene deer from Auvergne. Associated are small stalactites of unique occurrence in a Jersey cave. T. W. M. GULRIN.-NAotes on the Discovery of a Human Figure Sculptured on a Capstone of the Dolmen of DMhus, Guernsey.-The recently discovered' sculptured humani figuire on the under surface of the second capstone of the central chamber of the dolmen of Dehus, Guernsey,' shows an affinity to the anthropomorphic figures of the late neolithic and aenolithic periods of the valleys of the Seine and Marne and of south-easterti France. Its presence in the central chamber, the first structure to be erected, proves the latve date of the dolmen. The worship of the divinity represented by the figure existed for a very long period in Guernsey, one of the two existing statue-menhirs in the island being probably of the Iron Age. J. L. MYREs.-Excavations in Cyprus in 1913.-(l) In a Bronze Age necropolis at Lapathos on the north coast, a sequence of tombs was obtained covering the "Early " and " Middle" Periods of the Bronze Age. The "Middle" period began not earlier than the Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt. (2) The late Bronze Age necropolis at Enkomi, near Famagusta, yielded a good deal of information as to the history of an IEgean colony on this site. (3) The well-known " megalithic " monument near Enkomi, popularly called " St. Cathterine's Prison," was shown to belong to the historic necropolis of Salamis, and probably to its Graeco-Roman stage. (4) The "Bamboula" mound in the outskirts of Larnaca was shown to consist of late Greek and Graco-Roman stratified debris, overlying a fortification wall and other remains of the Grmco-Phcenician city of Kition. The earliest remains here go back only to the beginning of the Early Iron Age. [ 157 j</page><page sequence="4">No. 83.] MAN. [October, 1919. (5) A sanctuary site at Levkoniko yielded a series of Cypriote sculpture beginning in the seventh or eiglhth century B.C. The figures were those of nmale votaries carrying various emblems of a local deity eventually identified with the Greek Apollo. (6) The Byzantine site at Lampousa on the north coast near Lapa,thos yielded only evidence of wholesale quarrying of the older settlements during the Middle Ages. STANLEY CASsoN.-Some Balkanz Antiquities found during the period 1915-1919. A number of accidental discover-ies were made duiring the war in the course of military operations in Macedonia, but owing to the circumstances thorough systematfr investigations were not possible. A nuimber of finds were made in prehistoric mounds, including inicised, pebble-polished anid painted vases, among the latter being examples of " red oti white " ware similar 'to that found in Thessaly. Imported wares and evidence of foreign influence were present. The balance of evidence showed that the early civilization of Macedonia belonged to the North rather than the South. A number of Roman sites were identified and a number of isolated discoveries of the classical period were made. H. KIDNER.-Recent Discovery of an Utnrecorded 'ype of Circular Earthwork in the New Forest.-This circular earthwork is situated on the west side of Hatchet Moor, Beanlieu Heath. The circular bank is sliglhtly over 2 ft. high, and 21 ft. wide; and is continuous the whole way round without gap for entrance. There is neither outer nor inside ditch, nor central mound. The setting of the earthwork on the open moor in association with bowl-barrows; the width, spread, appearance, vegetation and consolidation of the circular bank--all support the conclusion that it is of Bronize Age date. The earthwork differs from a typical disc-barrow in not lhavinrg either inner ditch or central mound. It may have been intended for purposes of religious ritual, and only secondarily, if at all, for sepulchral uses. G. BROWNEN.-Hedenesbury or Hengistbury of Prehistoric Time.-On the western bank of the estuary of the rivers Avon and Stour are the prehi4toric (earthwork) northern defences of an important settlement commanding the w.aterways from the Solent and Cbannel to the hinterlands of Wilts, Dorset and Somerset and their prehistoric sanctuaries, &amp;c. The township or settlement possessed a port just within the estuary with an acropolis, and has afforded proof of trade with ancient Gaul more than two millenia ago. Among the many and curious finds obtained was a hoard of some thousands of coins-a few only being Roman and dating from the Republic nearly to the Roman departure from Britain. The great bulk was British and Gaulish in type. It is suggested that this port is to be identified with that named Bolveltaunia mentioned in the Ravenna lists. This would harmoniise with the late Sir' John Rhys's selection of the river Stour as the boundary line betwixt the Brython and Goidel. Archaeological Investigations in ullalta.-Report of the Committee.-- This year's work has consisted of excavations at Ghar Dalam, in that part of the cave floor separating the Trench described in the Report of the British Association of 1916, aud Trench No. II, described in the report published in the Journal of the Rloyol Anthropological I`nstitute of 1917. Potsberds belonging to various epochls, some being of a very fine pattern, and a few implemelnts were met with; aanimal bones were, as Usual, found in great profusion. Human remainis occurred at a lower level than that in which the Neanderthaloid miolars were found itn 1917. Later work consisted in the digging of three trenches. In Trench I potsherds of various epochs were found in profusion. Animal bones were also fouud in the greatest abuidance, and evidence of man's work has been traced to a rather low [ 158 j</page><page sequence="5">October, 1919.] MAN. [No. 83. level. In Trench II potsherds were not so common as in Trench I, but aninial remains were found in equal abundance. Amongst the important finds iln this trench are several specimens and marny fragments of a marine shell belonging to a species which is at presenit very rare in iMaltese waters, not to say extinct. Trench III is still beinig excavated. I1t shows some groups of stalagmites of various sizes. A coatinlg of stalagmitic formation has preserved many of the animal remains in their anatomical position. Discussion.-In a joint meeting with Section C( (Geology) Mr. REGINALD SMITH opened a discussion on " The Post-Tertiary Geology of the District [of Bournemouth] " with special reference to the Flint Implenments in them," his communication being illustrated by a collection of flint implements lent for the occasion. ETHNOGRAPHY. F. J. RICHARDs.-Badaga C2lans.--Tle Badagas are not an " autochthonous " jungle tribe, but are comparatively rec-ent immigrants from the Mysore counitry. Accournts hitherto recorded of the sections of the Badaga community fail to discriminate between enidogamous groups and exoganlous clans. The typical Badaga hamlet consists of members of one clan, relate(d to the Badagas of other hainlets either as "brothers " or "-in laws." Ckln lhamlets are federated into clan cult groups for celebration of agricul- tural rites. Badaga Cult Groups are federated into Nads and associated with other endogamovis groups of the Badaga community and other Hill tribes for purposes of ecoiiomic aind social autonomy. The important ceremonies of the harvest festival were described in detail. The Badaga community exhibits traces of at least two migrations, (a) the early Badagas and the Hoysala conqtuest, (b) the TUmmattur conquest and Linigayat influenice. Associated clans are apparently intermediate. E. W. PEARSON CHINNERY.-Stonework and Goldfields in Papua.-The objects unearthed during gold-digging operations in the mountainous districts of the interior of Papua incltide pestles, some carved to represent birds vith snake-like heads, and some encircled by knobs; mortars of granite ; axe heads of obsidian ; pierced quartz objects of variouis sliapes (Yodda). On the summit of a large hill near the Yodda goldfields is a large mortar and at the Girlwu river is a lhuman image of which the forehead retreats to a point at the back of the head and the hands are crossed on the stomach. Near the mouith of the Giriwu river ornamented pottery, and at Rainu (Collingwood Bay) ornamented pottery obsidian objects, pestles and conus shells with incised designs have been found. On the S.E. coast, near the old Gibara (Milne Bay) goldfield, stones with chipped conceatric circles, standing stones and circles of stone sitting places have been discovered. The evidence of the stone objects in Papua slhows that it was visited at some time by stone-using people who differed in many respects from the present inhabitants. It would appear from the distribution and character of the objects that the stoiie- users had some interest in a gold-bearing counLtry. RELIGION. A. M. HOCART.-Death Ritual in Eddystone Island of the Solomons.-The Eddystone Islanders expose the bodies of their dead in the embryonic position. After the funeral four men catch the soul on a dracaena leaf and(I a ring, in order to secure the soul's services in divination. T'he widow may be strangled, but more often she is confined in a small enclosure witlh her knees drawn up ; she may not wear any finery, nor eat of food cooked in the house. On the fourth day a big feast is held, at which a long prayer is recited which enables the soul later on to go to the laud of the dead; but in the meantime it goes to wait in the cave at the [ 159 ]</page><page sequence="6">No. 83.] MAN. [October, 1919. top of the highest hill. After ten or twelve days the skull is fetched away and put in the sun to bleach. The next event is a small feast called "Bathing." On the eighteenth day the skull is put into the skull-house by the mortuary priest, who makes a burnt offering of pudding. On the thirty-sixth day a small feast is held, and four baskets are burnt. On that day the ghosts come to take away thle deceased to the land of the dead. Sometimes a sadnce is held at night to converse with the ghosts, who answer by whistling. Life in the other world is exactly as in this world, only it goes on at night. On the fiftieth day is a big feast, which closes the series for ordinary people. The day before they bury the string on which the days, or rather nights, were counted, and put a basket into the skull-house. For chiefs they have a feast on the hundredth night; then, after a lapse of time which depenids upon supplies, they hold the final celebration or Night Festival, which is one of the great fuinctions in Eddystone. In olden days it appears to have been often combined with the great head-hunting feast. W. CROOKE.- The Cults of the Mother Goddesses in lndia.-Tihe cult of the nmother goddess is prominent in Minoan, early Hellenic, Western Asia, and Babylonian ritual. In Vedic mythology goddesses hold only second rank, and some at least of the modern Hindu goddesses seem to have originated among the non-Aryans, who had at a very early period reached the agricultural stage. It has been the habit to derive all the mother goddesses from the cult of Mother Earth. But there are other types of goddesses-the Jungle Mothers, deified women, and elemental deities which cannot be readily connected with earth worship. The progress of anthropomorphism can be traced from the aniconic to tthe iconic stage, in the periodical rest and awakeniing of the mother goddess. Her energies are recruited in two ways; by the rites of the sacred marriage, and by the blood sacrifice, often specially of male victims. HAROLD PEAKE. - Santiago; The Evolution of a Patron Saint.-Among the megalithic monuments on the western side of the Iberian Peninsula, which ini course of time became objects of veneration, two-a menhir and a hollowed stone-stood near the port of Padron, and were known as Patronus and Barcha, " the skipper and the boat." In the Holy War which the Galatians waged against the Saracens, Santiago, or St. James, was selected for their patron, and his cult became associated in the minds of the natives with the megalithic Padron or Patronus. In spite of many attempts by bishops and others, it was found impossible to dissociate the two cults, and the traditionjal story of St. James gathered around itself many features which belonged to the original megalitlhic worship. PROFESSOR CARVETH READ.-Magic and Science. REv. H. J. D. ASTLEY.-Primitive Art as a Means of Practical Magic.-- Primitive artistry varies from the highlest perfection, as in the cave-drawings of France and Spain, to examples that appear like the first efforts of children. But none of the work was dolne for a purely artistic purpose, or to gratify the esthetic sense. Magic supplied the stimulus to the artistic instinct. This explains not-only the drawings of animals, but also such drawings, for example, as those of the Dancinlg Women in the Cave of Cogul. To primitive man the image or svmbol is the same thing as the living actor, alnd what is represented as being done by the symbol is as though it were being actually performed by the producer of it. EXCURSION. Members of the section visited the Dorchester Museum on the afternoon of Wednesday, September 1OLh, when tlhey were entertained at tea by the Curator and MIrs. Acland. They afterwards visited Maumbury Rings, where M1r. C. Prideaux gave a short account of the results of the recent explorations, and the Maiden Castle Earthworks.
