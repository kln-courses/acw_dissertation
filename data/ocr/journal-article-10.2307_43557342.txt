<plain_text><page sequence="1">^HÂ£all for Papers The Science Teacher (' TST) is seeking manuscripts that describe new and creative ideas for the secondary science classroom. Manuscripts should provide worthwhile ideas and practical help for teachers as they relate to the themes listed below. TST also always encourages manuscripts outside of the listed themes. Common Core State Standards : Math and Science Connections SUBMISSION DEADLINE: DECEMBER 15, 2013 As the Common Core State Standards are adopted by more states, science teachers look for ideas for incorporating them into their teaching practice. This issue will focus on the CCSS in mathematics. Share tips for addressing the mathematics standards found in the CCSS and aligned with the Next Gen- eration Science Standards. Crosscutting Concepts in Science SUBMISSION DEADLINE: ONGOING The Next Generation Science Standards - and A Frameworkjor K-12 Science Education upon which they are built - identify seven crosscutting concepts of science - those big ideas that "bridge disciplinary boundaries" and have "explanatory value throughout much of science and engineering." They are: 1. Patterns 2. Cause and effect: Mechanism and explanation 3. Scale, proportion, and quantity 4. Systems and system models ) 5. Energy and matter: Flows, cycles, and conservation 6. Structure and function 7. Stability and change Have you found a way to effectively teach these crosscut- ting concepts in your science classes? If so, please share them with our readers. i Disciplinary Core Ideas: Motion and I Stability: Forces and Interactions ' SUBMISSION DEADLINE: FEBRUARY 1, 2014 The Next Generation Science Standards - and A Frameworkjor K-12 Science Education upon which they are built - identify Motion and Stability: Forces and Interactions as one of the disciplinary core ideas of physical science. This interdisci- plinary concept is central to all of the sciences. Have you found a creative way to engage students in this all-important idea? If so, TST wants to hear from you! Disciplinary Core Ideas: Ecosystems SUBMISSION DEADLINE: MARCH 1, 2014 A Frameworkjor K-12 Science Education and Next Generation Science Standards identify Ecosystems: Interactions, Energy, and Dynamics as a disciplinary core idea of life science. These complex systems can be small or large, and the future of planet Earth depends on our understanding the dynamic interactions of and the natural and anthropomorphic threats to these sys- tems. Please share your teaching tips for this central concept. Scientific and Engineering Practices: Analyzing and Interpreting Data SUBMISSION DEADLINE: APRIL 1, 2014 The Next Generation Science Standards - and A Frameworkjor K-12 Science Education upon which they are built - note the importance of allowing students to engage in the practices of science. Direct involvement with these practices can give stu- dents an appreciation of the wide range of approaches used in science to understand the world, and a better understanding of how scientists work. Students must learn to collect data care- fully and systematically, but even more importantly, they must learn to analyze data to reveal patterns and relationships and thus discover the meaning of raw data. Facility with spread- sheets, charts, graphs, and mathematics should be a skill that all our students acquire. Students also need opportunities to analyze large data sets such as those available as never before across the internet. Have you found interesting ways to incor- porate this practice in your science classes? Please share your activities and teaching strategies with TST readers. Science for All SUBMISSION DEADLINE: ONGOING TST is seeking manuscripts for this annual issue devoted to the inclusion of all learners. The issue offers ideas and strategies to mitigate academic achievement gaps associated with ethnic- ity, socioeconomic status, gender, physical disabilities, limited English-language proficiency, learning differences, and even gifted abilities.
