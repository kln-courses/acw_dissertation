Bible Versions Englert, Donald M. C., The Peshitto of Second Samuel. Journal of Biblical Literature Monograph Series, Vol. 3. Philadelphia: Society of Biblical Litera- ture and Exegesis, 1949. 102 pp. A monograph originally undertaken as a dissertation for the Ph.D. at Dropsie College. It deals with the transmission of the Syriac text, the relation of the MT to it, and the way in which it has been influenced by other versions. Gehman, Henry S., "The Theological Approach of the Greek Translator of Job 1-15" (JBL, September, 1949, 231-240). A comparison of the Old Greek version with the MT of Job 1-15 brings to light several of the theological tendencies of the translator. Hammer, E. W., "The Onkelos Targum" (Inter- pretation, April, 1949, 174-183). The writer suggests that a study of the Onkelos Targum frequently eluci- dates the meaning of the Hebrew text. Orlinsky, H. M., The Septuagint: the Oldest Transla- tion of the Bible. Cincinnati: Union of American Hebrew Congregations, 1949. 20 pp. A short introduction to the LXX. Payne, J. Barton, "The Relationship of the Chester Beatty Papyri of Ezekiel to Codex Vaticanus" (JBL, September, 1949, 251-265). By comparing the Codex Vaticanus with the eight leaves from the Chester Beatty biblical papyri containing portions of the Greek text of Ezekiel 11:25-17:21 the author comes to the conclusion that the Chester Beatty text is closer to the original LXX for Ezekiel than any other we have. Stenning, J. F., The Targum of Isaiah. Oxford: At the Clarendon Press, 1949. 232 pp. An edition of the Tar- gum of Isaiah which reproduces the text and super- linear pointing of the British Museum MS. Or. 2211. In the critical apparatus the evidence of some ten other manuscripts is cited. Vis d vis the original is an English translation. II. Philology Byington, Steven T., "Plow and Pick" (JBL, March, 1949, 49-56). An examination of the words in the Old Testament used for agriculture implements. Gordis, Robert, "The Translation-Theory of Qohelet Reexamined" (JQR, Vol. 40, 1949-50, 103-116). The continuation of a controversy concerning an Aramaic original for the Hebrew text of Ecclesiastes. Dr. Frank Zimmermann and Dr. C. C. Torrey favor an Aramaic original. The writer opposes such a theory. This article is a response to a previous one by Torrey, "The Ques- tion of the Original Language of Qoheleth," JQR, Vol. 39, 1948, 151-160. Gottstein, M. H., "Afterthought and the Syntax of Relative Clauses in Biblical Hebrew" (JBL, March, 1949, 35-47). The adumbration of a few rules of Hebrew syntax for the purpose of a better interpretation of Old Testament texts. Koehler, Ludwig, Lexicon in Veteris Testamenti Libros. Vols. III, IV, V. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1949. This is a continuation of the Hebrew-Aramaic lexicon of the Old Testament which is being produced in successive volumes. Koehler is the editor of the Hebrew section and Walter Baumgartner is the editor of the Aramaic division. Obermann, Julian, "The Divine Name YHWH in the Light of Recent Discoveries" (JBL, December, 1949, 301-323). Two Phoenician inscriptions recently discovered at Karatepe, in Southern Anatolia, lead Professor Obermann to believe that the Tetragramma- ton was originally the causative participle of the stem hwy. The expression "I am YHWH" should best be translated "I am he who sustains, maintains, estab- lishes." Quell, Gottfried &amp; Stauffer, Ethelbert, Love. London: Adam and Charles Black, 1949. 76 pp. This important monograph is one of a series of key words from Gerhard Kittel's Theologisches Wdrterbuch zum Neuen Testament which are being translated by J. R. Coates. It deals with love in the Old Testament, the words for love in pre-biblical Greek, love in Judaism, in the teaching of Jesus, in the Apostolic age and in the sub-apostolic age. Reed, William L., The Asherah in the Old Testament. Fort Worth, Texas: Texas Christian University Press, 1949. 116 pp. It is the author's thesis that the word "Asherah" is used in the Old Testament only to refer to the goddess of that name and her image, and there- fore we should abandon the "sacred pole" theory. Zimmermann, Frank, "The Question of Hebrew in Qohelet" (JQR, Vol. 40, 1949-50, 79-102). A reply to the article by Dr. Robert Gordis, "The Original Lan- guage of Qohelet" (JQR, Vol. 37, 1946, 67-84). It is 202</page><page sequence="2">RESEARCH ABSTRACTS 203 Zimmermann's contention that there was an Aramaic original to Ecclesiastes, while Gordis denies it. III. Introductory Works Aalders, G. Ch., A Short Introduction to the Penta- teuch. London: The Tyndale Press, 1949. 173 pp. Although the author does not assert that Moses is the final and sole author of the Pentateuch, he does claim that "he had a very large and prominent part in the prior origin of it" and he is to be viewed as "God's intermediary to give the people of Israel its funda- mental legislation." Bentzen, Aage, Introduction to the Old Testament, Vol. II. Copenhagen: G. E. C. Gads Forlag, 1949. 300 pp. This is the second volume of Bentzen's Introduction to the Old Testament, the first having been published in 1948. The first volume contained a study of the canon, the text, and the forms of Old Testament literature. In the second half of the work are to be found the introductions to the canonical books of the Old Testa- ment, as well as very brief introductions to the apocry- phal and pseudepigraphical books. Of particular interest is the presentation of the views of the "Scandinavian School" on the Pentateuch and the Prophets. Freedman, D. N. and Smart, J. D., God Has Spoken. Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1949. 268 pp. A book designed primarily as an introduction to the Old Testament for young people. It rests upon sound his- torical scholarship. Weiser, A., Einleitung in das Alte Testament. 2. neubearbeitete Aufiage. G6ttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1949. 337 pp. Besides many minor revisions the major change in this second edition of Weiser's work is the addition of a section on the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha. IV. Exegesis Abel, F. M., Les Livres des Maccabtes. Paris: J. Gabalda et Cie., 1949. 429 pp. A volume which con- tains the Greek text and a French translation on op- posite pages, as well as a commentary. Bewer, Julius A., The Book of the Twelve Prophets. Vol. I: Amos, Hosea and Micah. 79 pp. Vol. II: Zepha- -niah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Haggai, Zechariah, Obadiah, Malachi, Joel and Jonah. 112 pp. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, Publishers, 1949. The first two volumes of a series on the prophets. For each book there is a brief introduction with an outline of the historical back- ground, the message and the most important literary problems. The translation used is the King James with full footnotes explaining the text. Caiger, Stephen L., Lives of the Prophets. London: S.P.C.K., 1949. 333 pp. A revision of an earlier edition first published in 1936, with the most important change being the addition of chapters on Samuel, Elijah and Elisha. The treatment is popular, but the author certifies to his readers that "the assured results of biblical research have not been ignored." Crook, Margaret B., "A Suggested Occasion for Isaiah 9:2-7 and 11:1-9" (BL, September, 1949, 213- 224). It is contended that Isaiah 9:2-7 and 11:1-9 were originally a liturgy of enthronement and a corona- tion liturgy respectively, and the order of their emer- gence was probably the reverse of that in which they stand in the Old Testament. Further, these are liturgies suited to the coronation and enthronement of Jehoash of Judah in approximately the year 837 B.C., as is recorded in II Kings 11. Engnell, Ivan, The Call of Isaiah. Uppsala: A. B. Lundequistska Bokhandeln, 1949. 68 pp. A monograph on Isaiah 6 written from the viewpoint of the Scan- dinavian traditio-historical school. In it Professor Engnell argues trenchantly for the essential reliability of the MT and also defends the genuineness of all of Isaiah 6:13. Two notes at the end of the work contain the author's comments on P. Kahle's The Cairo Geniza and the "Jerusalem Scrolls." Flack, E. E., "The Book of Exodus" (Interpretation, January, 1949, 78-95). A suggested method of study for the book of Exodus. Goldman, S., In the Beginning. New York: Harpers &amp; Brothers Publishers, 1949. 892 pp. A voluminous work on the book of Genesis. It contains a summary of the contents of the book, a discussion of its historical background and authorship, a treatment of the style and viewpoint of Genesis, and a study of its relation to other literature. Heinemann, H., "The Date of Psalm 80" (JQR, Vol. 40, 1949-50, 297-302). The theory is advanced that Psalm 80 was composed in the time of Saul. The phrase "man of thy right hand" in vs. 17 would refer, then, to the first king of Israel. Hempel, J., Worte der Profeten in neuer Uebertragung und mit Erliuterungen. Berlin: Alfred T6pelmann, 1949. 324 pp. A notable contribution to the study of Israel's prophets. It contains three main sections: First, a consideration of the historical and literary frameworks of the prophetic writings. Second, a study of the nature of the call of the prophets, together with a treatment of each individual prophet. Third, a systematic presenta- tion of the teachings of the prophets, including ethical monotheism and its implications in human life, the prophetic understanding of nature and history, and prophetic eschatology. Hertzberg, H. W., Das Buch Hiob. Stuttgart: J. G. Oncken, 1949. 173 pp. Containing a new German translation of the book of Job with a commentary, this work is designed for the general reader. The author's effort is to come to an understanding of the book as it now stands rather than to isolate various secondary passages. H6lscher, Gustav, Drei Erdkarten: Ein Beitrag zur Erdkenntnis des Hebrdiischen Altertums. Heidelberg: Carl Winter: Universititsverlag, 1949. 73 pp. This monograph presents, first, a brief survey of the general geographical knowledge of the Hebrews. Then it analyzes three selected passages (Genesis 2:10-14,</page><page sequence="3">204 RESEARCH ABSTRACTS Genesis 10, Jubilees 8-9), and provides a map to illus- trate the geography implied in each. Hyatt, J. Philip, "The Book of Amos" (Interpreta- tion, July, 1949, 338-347). An outline of a study of the book of Amos is presented here, together with a selected bibliography. Jefferson, Helen Genevieve, "Notes on the Author- ship of Isaiah 65 and 66" (JBL, September, 1949, 225- 230). A study of the use of the article, the sign of the accusative and the relative pronoun suggests that chapters 65-66 of Isaiah are not by the author or authors of Isaiah 56-64. Jellicoe, Sidney, "The Prophets and the Cultus" (Expository Times, June, 1949, 256-258). A considera- tion primarily of Amos 5:21ff. and Jeremiah 7:22ff. Leslie, Elmer A., The Psalms: Translated and Inter- preted in the Light of Hebrew Life and Worship. New York: Abingdon-Cokesbury Press, 1949. 448 pp. The expressed intent of this volume is "to bring to the average reader of the Bible, in nontechnical terms, the sifted results of the most reliable scholarly study of these lyric expressions of Hebrew life and worship." Dr. Leslie acknowledges his indebtedness in the study to Hermann Gunkel, Sigmund Mowinckel and Hans Schmidt, and naturally there is special emphasis upon the Sitz im Leben of the Psalms. The translations are his own, at times based upon emendations of the MT. Morgenstern, Julian, "The Despoiling of the Egyp- tians" (JBL, March, 1949, 1-28). Following the sugges- tion of Prof. J. Coppens, the writer wants to change the vowel pointing of Exodus 11 :b slightly, and read: "Afterwards he will send you away, just as they send away a bride..." This changed text, he believes, can be integrated closely with a major theme and literary strand of the exodus narrative. Morgenstern, Julian, "Two Prophecies from 520- 516 B.C." (Hebrew Union College Annual, Volume XXII, 1949, 365-427). An analysis and interpretation of Isaiah 55:1-5 and Isaiah 60:1-3, 5-7. The scion of David, to whom Isaiah 55:1-5 alludes, is Zerubbabel, Morgenstern avers. The passage is to be dated the last quarter of the year 520 B.C. Isaiah 60:1-3, 5-7 refers to the New Year's Day of 516 B.C., the day of the dedication of the second Temple. Upon the basis of this dating the writer then seeks to reconstruct the history of the period between 520 and 516 B.C. Mowinckel, Sigmund Olaf Plytt, Jesaja. Oslo: Gyldendal Norsk Forlag, 1949. 161 ff. This book represents a challenge to Biblical students to learn one of the Scandinavian tongues. Power, A. D., The Proverbs of Solomon. London: Longmans, Green and Co., 1949. 256 pp. A translation of Ecclesiasticus with a detailed glossary at the end. Robinson, H. Wheeler, The Cross of Hosea. Phila- delphia: The Westminster Press, 1949. 64 pp. In this little book the writer treats three basic themes in the book of Hosea-the nature of God, the inwardness of sin, and the victory of grace. Roach, Corwin, "The Relevance of Jeremiah" (JBR, October, 1949, 231-235). A brief study designed to show the meaning which the message of Jeremiah has for our age. Slotki, I. W., Isaiah: Hebrew Text &amp; English Transla- tion, with an Introduction and Commentary. London -&amp; Bournemouth: The Soncino Press, 1949. 337 pp. In this volume the Hebrew text of Isaiah appears in full vis d vis the English with a commentary beneath. Sonne, Isaiah, "Psalm Eleven" (JBL, September, 1949, 241-245). Suggested emendations of Isaiah 11. Sparks, H. F. D., "The Witness of the Prophets to Hebrew Tradition" (JTS, Vol. 50, 1949, 129-168). An investigation of the Hebrew prophets brings to light traces of mythological, legendary, historical, legal and poetical traditions. Weiser, Artur, Das Buch der Zwilf Kleinen Propheten. Vol. I: Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadja, Jona, Micha. G6ttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Rauprecht, 1949. 261 pp. Another volume in the new Gattingen set of com- mentaries Das Alte Testament Deutsch. It contains only the first half of the Book of the Twelve. A short intro- duction appears at the beginning of each of the prophetic writings. V. Theology Baab, Otto J., The Theology of the Old Testament. New York: Abingdon-Cokesbury Press, 1949. 287 pp. This is one of the very few volumes on Old Testament theology to appear in English in recent years. The author asserts that "the key to the understanding of biblical religion and history is the biblical faith by which biblical men lived." Using this "key" he then proceeds to examine the Old Testament according to the classification derived from systematic theology- "God," "Man," "Sin," "Salvation," etc. Buber, Martin, The Prophetic Faith. New York: The MacMillan Company, 1949. 247 pp. Translated from the original Hebrew by Carlyle Witton-Davies, this book is concerned with describing that Old Testa- ment teaching which reached its climax in the prophets of the eighth, seventh and sixth centuries B.C. "This is the teaching about the relation between the God of Israel and Israel." Buber begins with the Song of Deborah and traces this "teaching" back through Moses to the Patriarchs. Then he follows it through the canonical prophets to Second Isaiah, where it reaches its most profound dimensions. Eichrodt, Walther, "Revelation and Responsibility," (Interpretation, October, 1949, 387-399). An investiga- tion into the Biblical norm of social behavior. The article has been translated by John Bright. Heidt, William George, Angelology of the Old Testa- ment: A Study in Biblical Theology. Washington, D. C.: The Catholic University of America Press, 1949. 119 pp. A rather complete compilation of all the Old Testament materials concerning angelology. Part one treats of "Angels at the Heavenly Court" and part two is concerned with "Angels in the World of Men." Hooke, S. H., The Kingdom of God in the Experience</page><page sequence="4">RESEARCH ABSTRACTS 205 of Jesus. London: Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. Ltd., 1949. 160 pp. A study which demands the attention of the Old Testament student because of its rich con- sideration of the Old Testament thought lying in the background of the experience of Jesus. Also, the first two chapters are on the divine kingship in the Hebrew religion. Johnson, Aubrey R., The Vitality of the Individual in the Thought of Ancient Israel. Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1949. 107 pp. The first of a proposed series, this monograph analyzes the basic Hebrew words necessary to an understanding of the biblical view of man. Nephesh and ruach are carefully studied, as well as the various other Hebrew words for "flesh," "head," "face," "palate," "tongue," etc. The final section is on the Hebrew view of life and death. Knight, George A. F., From Moses to Paul: A Christological Study in the Light of our Hebraic Heritage. London: Lutterworth Press, 1949. 194 pp. It is Pro- fessor Knight's contention that New Testament Chris- tology is the natural and inevitable result of Hebraic thought from the time of Moses. Langton, Edward, Essentials of Demonology: A Study of Jewish and Christian Doctrine, Its Origin and Development. London: The Epworth Press, 1949. 234 pp. A thorough and comprehensive study of demonology in Jewish and Christian teaching. There is full docu- mentation and an extensive bibliography of the subject. Lofthouse, W. F., "Poneron and Kakon in Old and New Testaments" (Expository Times, July, 1949, 264- 268). Two Hebrew words are analyzed in this article-- ra' usually rendered "evil" and rasha' normally trans- lated "wicked." Marsh, John, "Man in the Old Testament" (Ex- pository Times, September, 1949, 335-337). A brief sketch of the Old Testament teaching of man, which teaching, the writer says, "reveals the need for religion as the source and power of responsible human life, and yet the danger of religion if it be not concrete service in the events of history...." Porteous, Norman W., "Ritual and Righteousness" (Interpretation, October, 1949, 400-414). The sub-title of the article is: "The relation of Ethics to Religion in the Prophetic Literature." The Hebrew prophets, Dr. Porteous maintains, have taught us that our worship "should leave us face to face with him who would have a man 'do justly and love mercy and walk humbly' with him." Ramsey, Arthur Michael, The Glory of God and the Transfiguration of Christ. London: Longmans, Green and Co., 1949. 160 pp. A book of interest to the student of the Old Testament because of its treatment, pri- marily in the first chapter, of the theophanic term "kabod," the "glory" of Yahweh. Richardson, Alan, "Instrument of God" (Inter- pretation, July, 1949, 273-285). A short study of the unity which underlies the biblical doctrine of salvation. Thomas, John Newton, "What is Man?" (Inter- pretation, April, 1949, 154-163). The sub-title gives the gist of the article: "The Biblical Doctrine of the Image of God." Vischer, Wilhelm, The Witness of the Old Testament to Christ, Volume I: The Pentateuch. London: Lutter- worth Press, 1949. 264 pp. Part of Dr. Vischer's controversial work Das Christuszeugnis des Alten Testa- ments has been translated by A. B. Crabtree and appears under this title. One quotation will suffice to indicate the direction of the study. After alluding to Luther's assertion that the man with whom Jacob wrestled at Peniel was Jesus Christ, the writer avers, "Fantastic though the interpretation may appear, it is in fact conclusive. That is the central miracle attested by all the stories and words of the Bible, that Jesus Christ appeared as a man upon earth to wrestle with men, and to be overcome of them." Vischer, Wilhelm, "Words and the Word" (Inter- pretation, January, 1949, 3-18). The sub-title is: "The Anthropomorphisms of the Biblical Revelation." Trans- lated by John Bright, this essay seeks to underline the theological profundity of the anthropomorphic ex- pressions of the Bible. Whitfield, George, God and Man in the Old Testa- ment. London: S. C. M. Press, 1949. 144 pp. Using the Old Testament as a source book, the author of this little volume strives to answer some of the basic questions of human life. Each question is treated in a chapter: "Who is God?" "What is the Meaning of History?" "What is God like?" "What does God want?" "How does God speak?" "What are the Limits of Religion?" Zimmerli, W., Das Menschenbild des Alten Testa- ments. (Theologische Existenz Heute: Neue Folge 14) Miinchen: Chr. Kaiser Verlag, 1949. 27 pp. A succinct and discerning treatment of Old Testament anthro- pology. Zimmerli isolates the basic convictions con- cerning man which are common to the various strands of biblical thought. VI. History Albright, William Foxwell, "The Biblical Period." An article appearing in The Jews: Their History, Culture and Religion, Vol. I, pp. 3-69. Edited by Louis Finkelstein. New York: Harper and Brothers, 1949. It is a synoptic presentation of the history of Israel to the fourth century B.C. The article is now available as a separate monograph under the same title, "The Biblical Period." Daniel-Rops (sic), Sacred History. New York: Long- mans, Green and Co., 1949. 433 pp. A translation from the original French by K. Madge. It is a popular, and at times rather uncritical, treatment of the history of Israel. The same book translated by the same person appears in England as: Israel and the Ancient World. London: Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode, 1949. 321 pp. The two translations vary slightly. Pfeiffer, Robert H., History of New Testament Times with an Introduction to the Apocrypha. New York: Harper &amp; Brothers Publishers, 1949. 561 pp. A com-</page><page sequence="5">206 RESEARCH ABSTRACTS pendious work which furnishes the companion volume to the author's previously published Introduction to the Old Testament. There are two parts to the book: one on Judaism from 200 B.C. to 200 A.D., the second on the books of the Apocrypha. The section on Judaism is further divided into two subdivisions: (1) Palestinian Judaism, with treatments of its political, religious and literary history; (2) Hellenistic Judaism, containing a study of Hellenism in general, the Jews in their Dis- persion, and Alexandrian-Jewish literature. Rowley, H. H., Recent Discovery and the Patriarchal Age. Manchester: Manchester University Press and the John Rylands Library, 1949. 38 pp. This is a reprint from the "Bulletin of the John Rylands Library," Vol. 32, No. 1, September, 1949. Its thesis is that there is a general historical core to the legends of the patri- archs. Snaith, N. H., The Jews from Cyrus to Herold. Wallington: Religious Education Press, 1949. 206 pp. After a brief section on the history of Judaism from 538 B.C. to 70 A.D., this book deals with the main strands in the development of Judaism, i.e. Separatism, the Glorious Future, Temple and Synagogue etc. VII. Miscellaneous De Boer, P. A. H. (editor), Oudtestamentische Studien, Deel VI. Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1949. 218 pp. There are two articles in this volume, both of which are in English. The first is a study by the editor: "Research into the Text of I Samuel xviii-xxxi". It is a continuation of his previous research on the relation between the Hebrew text and the renderings of the Targum, Peshitto and Septuagint. The second essay is a posthumous work by B. D. Eerdmans: "The Com- position of Numbers." The opposition of the writer to the four documents of the Graf-Kuenen-Welhausen school is quite evident. Higgins, A. J. B., The Christian Significance of the Old Testament. London: Independent Press, 1949. 190 pp. A book designed to show the importance of the Old Testament for the Christian in his use of the Bible. Marcus, Ralph, "On the Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible" (JBL, March, 1949, 29-34). The7 adumbration of "certain elementary principles of the. textual criticism of the Hebrew Bible." Rabast, Karlheinz, Das apodiktische Recht im Deulo- ronomium und in Heiligkeitsgesetz. Berlin-Hermsdorf:: Heimatdienstverlag, 1949. 48 pp. Following his pro- fessor, Albrecht Alt, the writer of this brochure finds' two types of law in the Old Testament-apodictic and casuistic. Apodictic law is of Israelite provenance,, while casuistic law originated in non-Hebraic cultures. The purest form of apodictic law is to be found in the: Book of the Covenant, and in contrast to casuistic law, is rhythmical in form. Rylaardsdam, J. Coert, "The Apocrypha and the Bible" (JBR, July, 1949, 175-180). The thesis is presented that if we define the Bible as a cultural and historical record the Apocrypha should be included. The problem of the principle of canonization, however, still awaits fresh theological formulation. Winnett, Frederick Victor, The Mosaic Tradition. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1949. 219 pp. Reflecting the rather widespread dissatisfaction with the Graf-Wellhausen theory concerning the composi- tion of the Hexateuch which is prevalent today Pro- fessor Winnett's work presents a fresh approach to the problem. He contends that the original Mosaic tradi- tion, which is to be found in Exodus and Numbers, was transmitted by the northern kingdom. However, after the fall of the northern kingdom, the Jerusalem priests, in order to magnify their sanctuary, "developed a completely distorted version of the national tradition which eventually took the form of the book of Deu- teronomy (4:44-26:19)." The priesthood of the post- exilic period, then, sought to harmonize the two ver- sions, and at the same time added a great deal of new material which is designated by our symbol P. Zeitlin, Solomon, "Jewish Apocryphal Literature" (JQR, Vol 40, 1949-50, 223-250). Treating the relation of Jewish apocryphal literature to normative Judaism, this disquisition serves somewhat as an apologia for the edition of the Jewish Apocryphal Literature re- cently undertaken by Dropsie College.</page></plain_text>
