<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE - ROLE OF THOUGHT IN MEDICINE. WE have before us a very interesting address delivered by M. Helm holtz before the annual meeting at Berlin of the Military Schoolof Medicine. As an old man, he is led to compare his-dissertation of thirty-five years before, delivered, towards the end of his studentship, before a similar assembly, with the present one. At that times he tells us, most of the knowledge he possessed on matters medical, and most of the material used in the elaboration of that dissertation, were obtained from books. Books played then a much more important part in medi cal study than they do to-day. The struggle between the old methods of study and the new, the fight between authority and experience, had commenced. The change between that time and this is described in language full of beauty and simplicity, and some of Helmholtz's ex pressions are worthy at once df the true man of science and of that cultivation of the imagination commonly thought to be distinctive of the poet. In his reference to the memories which press upon him and the terms of veneration in which he refers to "My Lady Medicine", we are reminded how close is the connection between the spirit of scientific research and the poetic faculty. The true scientific man and the true poet both indeed cultivate the imagination, the former paying most attention to the preliminary steps which justify the imaginative conclusion, and the other giving prominence to the latter at the ex pense of the former. Those of our readers who are interested in the steps by which medi cine has become what she is, will do well to read this address. Side by side with its main inquiry into the principles of scientific method in the experimental sciences, we have some interesting references to facts in the history of medicine which cannot be too carefully kept in mind. We are reminded that the humoral pathology attributed all diseases to changes in the blood, lymph, bile, and. black bile; that to dyscrasike and acrimonies was then transferred the power formerly ascribed to the humours; that acids and alkalies succeeded dyscrasike and acrimonies; and that spirit and vis viva-vital force-with the occult qualities of absorbed substances, took the place of these. Haller's doctrine of irritability, irritants, and irritation, was the next theory to dominate the medical mind, and to be upheld with as much party spirit as its pre decessors, as the only true source of all diseases. The brilliant discoveries of Muller in physiology seem to Helmholtz to entitle him to as high a place in that science as that accorded to Newton in physics. To his influence may be traced, through the labours of Schwann, Henle, Du Bois-Reymond, Virchow, Lieberkuhn, Max Schultze, and a host of others, that use of experiments, instru ments, and laboratories, which form the method of inquiry of to-day. But important as we find this address in reminding us of historic facts in the continuity of thought in medicine, it is still more important from its inquiry into the principles of scientific method in the experi mental sciences. Few men are more competent that Helmholtz to aid us in such an inquiry. From I849 to i8?6, he had every year to ex pound the general pathology of the ancients, dealing with conceptions, general and theoretic, on the nature of disease, and the principles proper to its treatment. Medical studies teach the fundamental rules of scientific research with an earnestness not felt in other domains of knowledge, since the question whether our principles have been false or true obtains a terrible reality in the presence of death and family grief. It is no new conclusion, though it comes with additional value from the lips of such an inquirer, that the cardinal error of past methods in medicine has been the use, loose and ill-defined, of the deductive method. This was not an unnatural error, since it was considered in early times that thought was the grand distinction between man and the lower animals. It was, therefore, easy to fall into the error of formulating general conclusions, without inquiring whether the facts tallied with them or not. Two initial sources of confusion there were which</page><page sequence="2">738 THE BRITISH MEDICAL 7OURA'AL. [Nov. x6, i878 consisted in considering this the fundamental property of animal life, and in extending it without consideration to the other orans and tissues which offered no analogous phenomenon. With this theory was inseparably bound up that of the vital force-anirna inscia, or wvrei;a. This had a somewhat theological character; was thought to be subject to error, to passions, to idleness, to fear, to impatience, to grief, to im. prudence, to despair; and the function of the doctor was to treat it accordingly. The animna inscia gave place in turn to vital force, and a distinction was made between the first effects of disturbing agents, the .tyrplonat(a morbi, and those due to the reaction of the vital force, the syinwpAomtala reaetionis. Vital force, in turn, was thought to play too uni. versal a part, and much the same errors were made regarding it as re garding the apisna inscia of Stahl. As illustrative of the spirit of the time and of the fondamcntal difference of opinion concerning the value of the methods employed then and now, we are amused to be told of an old practitioner who thought the use of a seconds hand on a watch a dangerous innovation in counting the pulse, and of another who objected to the use of the stethoscope as degrading his patient to the level of a machine. But the genius of Miuller altered all that, and, in his hands and those of his brilliant successors, the medical mind became familiar with such methods of research as are afforded by the use of the microscope, of physiological chemistry, of the thermo. meter, of the ophthalmoscope, of the laryngoscope, and of the oto scope. In conclusion, Helmholtz lays us under still greater obligation to him by pointing out that there are two chief causes for the hatching of meta physical systems. On the one hand, man desires to be considered as a being of a superior order, elevated far above the rest of nature. Ideal ism gratifies this desire. On the other hand, man desires to dominate the world absolutely by his thought, in the state to which it has at present attained. This desire materialism attempts to satisfy. The past generation has groaned under the yoke of the idealistic meta physic; the present generation must defend itself against the material istic. Materialism, though a very useful hypothesis, is still only a hypothesis; and we must not fall into the error of converting natural law discovered by means of it into any power like that of the occult qualities of the alncient medicine. We have every reason to be en couraged by the results of the scientific treatment of medicine, and we shall do well to follow in the same line. might have operated, whatever the method of inquiry, but whose bane ful influence was all the more felt because of the faultiness of the method. There was, first, the tendency of knowledge to be altered in its transmission from hand to hand; the other was the confusion intro duced by the use of language itself. Helmholtz points out that the use of a general name implies a reference already to natural laws, of the other things denoted by the name. The use of the word mammalia, for example, implies a large number of facts about the animals in question; as that they are warm-blooded, have a many-chambered heart, a vertebrate column, and that they suckle their young, etc. 1-lence the use of such a term seems to assume that we have always had all the knowledge included under it. Hlence also one reason for that psychological anthropomorphism to be recognised as well in the "ideas" of Plato as in the "immanent dialectic" of the "processus" of the world of Ilegel, or the "unconscious volition" of Schopenhauer. The science of nature, which formerly was confounded with medicine, has retarded the steps of philosophy. The deductive method seemed capable of doing everything. Socrates, it is true, had developed, in the most instructive way, conceptions founded on induction, but the best part of his wotk had remained uncomprehended, probably even by himself, and certainly so by his hearers. Numerous pathological theories were developed by different inventors, who were affected by the progress of this or that part of natural science. These had their followers, who, exaggerating the theories of their masters, drew from {hem conclusions purely logical, and taken from their own preconceptions, which they did not trouble themselves to compare with nature. The narrower and more worthless the theory, the more intolerant it proved towards all innovations, and the more its adherents clung to authority. Hence the great anatomist Vesalius was cited before the Theological Faculty at Salamanca; Servetus and his book were burned at Geneva; and the Faculty at Paris interdicted the demonstration of the circulation of the blood discovered by Harvey. It is not, however, to be supposed that all the conclusions of these speculators were incorrect; on the contrary, some of their theories linve, in a striking way, anticipated one or two of the most comprehen sive generalisations of modern science. Sulch, for inistance, was the notion of Hippocrates concerning innate vital heat, which he supposed to be sustained by nourishment, and to be the source of all vital move ments. Here we have an anticipation of the equivalent between mechanical labour and heat, and indeed of the whole law of the con servation of energy. Such, also, was Stahl's theory of the " phlogistic" in chemistry, wlhich, if it were translated into lateit heat, might serve as an anticipation of the great discovery of Lavoisier. But the most part of such anticipations were altogether valueless; and there was nothing to hinder any accepted theory from being subverted by the succeeding generation, and the opposite held in its stead; for it seemed to have escaped notice that conclusions can never have a value greater tlan the premisses oni which they rest; and that, unIless each new de duction from the premisses in its turn verified them, the premisses themselves must be false. True it is, for example, that we make a deductive use of the law of gravitation; but we are justified in doing so, because Kepler had already established the law on the inluctive basis, and because each new deduction becomes in turn an experimental verification of the law. Intolerince or opposition to any opiniion may generally be taken as in(licative of the narrow ba.is on which the opinion rests. IHle who builds on a solid foundation can admit an error; he has been wrnng, that is all. Not so he who founds on an u11veliEi!d hypothesis; to him, every opponent is a knave or a fool.
