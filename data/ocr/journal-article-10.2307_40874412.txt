The Baluchi Language The Baluchi language belongs to the Iranian family of Aryan languages, one of two Iranian languages among those of Pakistan, the other being Pashto. The Baluchis themselves consider their language to be only a corruption of Neo-Persian, a dialect of modern Persian, but European linguists see it rather as a modern form of an old Iranian dialect which is not the same as that which gave origin to modern literary Persian. However, it is not very clear what exact form it took because Baluchi is seemingly derived from the group of old Iranian dialects called "Eastern," but also possesses some characteristics of the Western group. At present, Baluchi is spoken by slightly more than 700,000 people in eastern Iran and in the Pakistani pro- vince previously called Baluchistan. It should be noted that not all of the inhabitants of this province speak Baluchi. In fact, in the northern area, Baluchi gives way to Pashto (see the following article), which is the most commonly spoken language in Quetta, the capital city of Baluchistan itself. To the east, in some zones of Baluchistan, a dialect of Sindhi is spoken and in the same Baluchi linguistic zone there exists a Dravidian language island where Brahui is spoken. Baluchi-speaking areas are scattered beyond the borders of Baluchistan, even as far as Soviet Turkmenis- tan. One of the most interesting linguistic characteristics of Baluchi is that it well perserves some old medieval Persian sounds, even in intervocalic positions; for instance, ãdên ("mirror") for the Neo-Persian a'iriê. The numbering system is also interesting as it shows clear traces of vigesimal numbering: 60 is sai-ghZst9 or "three 20' s"; 80 is chär-ghlst, or "four 20 fs"; etc. Of course, modern Baluchi, especially in the mixed speech areas, is evidently barbarized by mixture with Sindhi, Pashto and Persian because it is not protected by a written literary tradition. Baluchi does not have a "classical" literature and when it is sometimes written, it is, of course, written in the Arabic script. Examples are not lacking, though, especially in translations of the Bible, of "Roman Baluchi," or Baluchi written in Roman script. Educated Baluchis, when they wish to compose in a literary manner, write in Persian or, in the case of those in Pakistan, use Urdu. *From Storia delle letterature del Pakistan (Milan, 1958). Translated from the Italian by Bernard Blair; reproduced by permission of the author.</page><page sequence="2">- 44 - Modern Baluchi is divided into two major dialects or groups of dialects: the first is northern, or northeastern, called "Sulaimani," which has Indo-Aryan loan words, especially from Sindhi; the second, the southern or southwestern MMakrani" dialect, with many Persian loan words. Makrani refers to Makran, the name of the Baluchi coastal region of Iran and Pakistan. B, Baluchi Literature - Prose As stated above, Baluchi literature is, for the most part, popular ^ and not written, and it consists of poems sung at evening gatherings by minstrels called dom or lori, or stories told in prose by narrators. Northern Baluchi has been studied most attentively and it is in that dialect that the "ballads11 were collected in the basic work of Longworth Dames . ^ We will first consider the prose. This is mostly narratives or novelle characterized by (a) stories of prophets and saints; (b) stories from the more or less legendary history of the Baluchis; (c) stories of fairies and génies; and (d) stories of love and romantic adventure. Some of these have been collected from the oral recitations of the people by European scholars. Among the latter types of stories are those from the great common Islamic heritage such as Laila and Majnun, Bahram-Gur and Gulandam, while others are purely Baluchi, such as the story of Dosten and Shir en, of Shah Murid and Hani, etc. The Baluchis however, even when telling well-known stories, relive them in an original form with a sense of fantasy and attention to descriptive detail which seem to be their own and which have brought some to compare their literary taste with that of the ancient Arabs. One curious and anthropomorphic tale of the mi ' vãg &gt; or Muhammad's ascent to heaven, tells of the Prophet dining with God in the celestial world, separated from Him by a curtain. The hand of God appears now and then from behind the curtain to take food, and to Muhammad fi amazement, he recognizes a ring on God's finger which he once had thrown into the jaws of a ferocious tiger that barred the path of his adventurous journey to heaven. On order to give an example of the narrative technique of a Baluchi story, we have translated one of them literally. It is a Baluchi version of "The Water of Life in the Land of Shadows," a motif found very widely in Muslim narratives. We note that the words at the beginning of the story seem to place the events in a primordial age outside of known time. Both the opening and ending are stereotyped and common to all narratives and fables in prose. ^ May He be praised; there is none so great as God. Once upon a time there was a king and this king called forty of his servants and said, "I am going to seek the Water of Life. Come with me, but do not bring any old men. If I see an old man, I will kill him."</page><page sequence="3">- 45 - The servants replied, MSo be it." Now, one of the servants of the king went home to pick up his things in order to go with the king. His father said to him, "Son, where are you going?" The son said, "We forty men are going with the king to seek the Water of Life, because the king wishes to drink the Water of Life so that he will never die." Then the father said, "Take me with you because I will be useful to you." The son said, "The king has said that if we take any old man, he will kill him. If I take you with me, the king will kill you." But the father said, "Prepare a trunk and put me inside; thus I can be useful to you and the king will not see me in the trunk." The son said, "Very well; since you insist, I will take you with me. But if the king sees you and kills you, the blame will be yours. My strength will certainly not be enough to tear you away from the hands of the king," The father said, "Our hope is in God; what will be will be." Then the young man loaded two trunks on a camel; in one he put his father and in the other, his belongings, and then he went to the king. The others had also prepared their baggage, and scarcely had he arrived when they all set out on the voyage. On and on they traveled, and a day's journey from their country, they halted before some mountains where the Water of Life was to be found. They rested a while; they ate and drank tea. Then the king commanded ten horse- men to seek the Water of Life. Each one mounted his horse and they entered the Land of Shadows^ and they rode their horses into the darkness. The king also went with his men as far as the Land of Shadows and there they unpacked their baggage. And now let us leave the king and hear about the men. They departed, but the Land of Shadows confounded their minds and they became lost. The king waited with his eyes fixed on the road, but they did not return. The next day the king sent another five horsemen. They left and did not return. Then the king called his servants around him and said, "Why is it that two days have passed since I sent out my men and they do not return?" They replied, "How can we know why they do not return?" The king said, "Alas, if only there were an old man here, how useful he could be today!"</page><page sequence="4">- 46 - Now the young man who had brought his father went to his father. The father asked, "So, have the men returned?" The son said, "No." The old man said, "Even if the king sends you, do not go because you will be lost." Then the son of the old man said to his father, "Today the king missed the presence of an old man. He called us and asked why the men he sent out did not return, but we could not answer." The old man said to his son, "Go to the king and say, fI have a father and I will bring him to you if you do not kill him. f" So the son of the old man went before the king and said, "0 King, 0 Qibla of the World! 5 I have a father and when we all came here, he came with me because he loves me very much. Now I will bring him to you if you do not kill him!" The king said, "Bring him. I will not kill him." And the son went and brought his father. The king then said, "Two days have come to pass since I sent my men to bring me the Water of Life, but they leave and do not return. Why does this happen?" The old man said, "Because when they went into the Land of Shadows, found the water, took it and set out to return from the Land of Shadows, they could not find the way because the Land of Shadows has neither beginning nor end. It is a vast land out there." Then the king said, "And what must one do so that they do not lose their way?" The old man said, "Do one thing. Command the men to take thirty or forty mares, then tie the foals of these mares at the entrance to the Land of Shadows, then send the men to get the Water of Life." "Very wise," said the king. So the king sent ten horsemen to get mares. They went off and returned with thirty mares. The king said, "Leave the foals of the mares and thirty men take the thirty mares and look for the Water of Life." They tied the foals and rode off on the mares. Now the old man said, "Take knapsacks with you and you will not regret it." Some turned back to get knapsacks; others did not. Then the old man further said, "When you reach the water, put anything you see into the sacks. When you have filled the sacks and turned the horses back, don't spur them, but let them carry you back by the right path."</page><page sequence="5">- 47 - They said, "So be it," and left for the Land of Shadows. The king and the old man stayed behind with three servants. Now let us leave them and see what happened to the horsemen. They rode and they rode. At a certain spot they heard the gurgling of some water. They advanced to the water and filled one or two bottles. Some took to picking up everything they saw. Many pebbles were washed about in the water and everyone who had a place to carry them picked up the stones. Those who did not bring sacks put some pebbles in their pockets. Others did not take them and they made fun of those who did gather the pebbles and said, "Aren't there enough stones out there that you have to carry them from here?" So they turned around on their horses and the horses followed the correct path and came out of the Land of Shadows. The men carried the water, presented it to the king and then opened their knapsacks. They looked and saw that what they had thought to be stones had turned to gold. They were no longer stones. Now those who did not carry an^ were sorry and even those who did carry them complained. Some said, "Why did I not bring any with me?" And others said, "Why did I not fill my clothing with the stones?" Everyone lamented and was sick at heart. Then the king wanted to drink the water, but the old man said, "0 King, 0 Qibla of the World! Come, let us go, you and me, to that mountain and there you may drink you water." The king said, "Let it be so." The king and the old man went to the mountain and sat down at the base of a tree. Then the king said, "Now I will drink the water from my bottle." The old man said, "Wait. Let us first perform our afternoon prayers and then you may drink the water." The king said, "So be it." And then the king and the old man made preparations for prayer. When they were about to begin their prayers, something round driven by the wind hit against a rock and then against another, and each time it struck, said "Wack, wack." The king finished his prayer and asked the old man, 'bid man, while you and I were praying, there was something like a ball of wool which the wind blew against one rock and then against another and each time it made a cry and said 'Wack, wack.' What the devil was it that made that noise?"</page><page sequence="6">- 48 - The old man said, "Once upon a time there was a king and he, like you, drank this water. Now three hundred years have passed and he has not died. His subjects have all had enough of him and he has been exiled from his country and no one loves him anymore because he is too old. And that is why he goes wandering around these mountains. And he is so light that the wind blows him from one stone to the next, but he never dies." And now the king said to the old man, "If things are like that, I will not drink this Water of Life." The old man said, "0 King, 0 Qibla of the World! You may do as you wish; but if you drink, even you will become as that king." The king said, "I would not think of drinking this water anymore.11 Striking the bottle against the tree, he broke it, and the tree has remained green and fresh until this day. The king departed for his horsemen and, leaving that place with his servants, returned to his land and sat again on the throne. And I fled from there and I wish for myself good fortune and for each of you a sweetheart! * * * It is noted that traditionally stories should only be told in the evening. If they are told during the daytime, the Baluchis say, they can bring bad luck to the narrator or to the house where this infraction of the rules takes place. The "epic ballads," which almost always treat the Baluchi migrations and the wars between two principal tribal groups, the Rind and the Lashari, form a midway point in Baluchi poetry. These ballads are infused with the imaginative influence of classical Persian and its very facile and primitive rhyming system. Some of the ballads can be said to breathe true epic qualities into the burning events of the stages of migration, the names of their victorious chiefs, the battles, and the long incursions on horseback of warriors "who passed like lightning and returned rolling like the thunder." They tell of tribes which "arose as one, driven by desire for water and destiny," invading new lands "like showers that fell during the rainy sea- son." This epic quality is very rare in other Islamic literatures. Among the most famous heroes of these ballads are Nodhbandag and Mir Shakar. The ballads usually begin by mentioning the Battle of Karbala,6 and the oldest of them, judging by the archaic expressions, can be dated in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Here is an example of one of the few collected from the southern dialect: The clans of Aleppo trembled with anger The day Yazid lifted his head. When Sultan Shad Husain was slain The clans conceived their hatred for Yazid. The Lashari advanced from their camp And with them marched the generous Nodhbandag.</page><page sequence="7">- 49 - Shaihak followed him closely with the Rind And descended beyond Rodbar, Crossed the Desert of Lar And found themselves before the bazaar of Pahra.^ Beyond the borders of Bampur They went, the men of the harnessed horses, And women of beautiful necklaces With sheep and cows in great herds. Women with slovenly hair Captured Prince Shaihak, forger of swords. The just, generous Nodhbandag Settled in the desert country. The Lashari halted at Lashar° And the Rind at the bazaar of Pahra. And three years passed, one by one, By the will of God, generous and powerful. And then came the attack of the Ghazi, Those Turks on swift steeds. And the army carried the sword from Iran (There was no place left even there for lions) ; They marched like the lightning and like the wind And roaring, they marched like thunder From Kec to Makran, all the way to India, Up to the river in the region of Sindh, From Sarbaz to the desert Mand. And Gohar, the heroine, followed. 9 They went always in search of streams and lakes, And they passed beyond Pagaya-land. Those carrion Sabuki were put to rout, The Kurds and the Khalkhali, devourers of men!10 May the Mari have nothing to do with the Rind, May the dwellers of the highlands remain in peace! With Nodhbandag the Chief, the generous hero, And Shaihak, the gallant warrior, The clan rose as one, - The longing for water enraptured them, and destiny too - And they paused near rivers and rills Studying the ground, the mouths of streams. Kec11 did not please the Rind When they stopped on the nude plains of Kolwa.1^ And a year passed entirely From the time Shaihak settled at Ashal. Shakar13 like a scintillating ruby Arose then, fortunate hero; The minstrels came to Gar and to Danda, From Dora to Saghik for a while, From Zig and from Chambar to Mala, Up to Hortan and to the bazaar of Tanda.</page><page sequence="8">- 50 - And leading them, Nodhbandag came; Nodhbandag passed beyond the Hari and above, From Ghish-Kaura to Gulkaura.^ They came down like rainfall in the rainy season And then toward Kackhi and Sibi. All the Rind went away together. In addition to migration, the next important subject of Baluchi epic ballads is the "Thirty Years War" (1489-1511) between the Rind clan led by Mir Shakar, the son of Shaihak, whom we have already mentioned, and that of the Lashari led by Gwaharam. Other tribal wars in the sixteenth century also serve as subjects for these ballads. Some others related the under- taking of the Baluchisin 1555 to help the exiled Moghul emperor, Humayun, in the reconques t of Delhi. There is no lack of other ballads of later wars in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries 0 The Baluchis have conserved these ballads in large folios (daftar) written in Arabic script. Buller, in the Baluchistan District Gazeteer (Series VII, pp. 81-82), describing the content of some of these folios, mentions a . * a poem about the migration of the Rind, other poems that give details of the history of various princes of K5c, one Ballad of Ghulam All which describes the Battle of Malik Dinar Ghik'ki against the Taqï Khln, a General of Nadir Shah, and still another about Otman Kalmati and the Battle of Hammal-ë-Gîhand and the Portuguese, . . . As we can see, some of the ballads are recorded even with the names of the authors. The cycle of Dosten and Shiren is particularly noteworthy among the poetic áãstãn^ about love and romanceo Dosten, a soldier of Mir Shakar, chief of the Rind, is delivered as a hostage to the Turks. His cousin and fiancée, Shiren, waits for him faithfully for many years until she is obliged to marry against her will o But just as they are about to celebrate the wedding, Dosten, released from prison, returns, having ridden his steed madly through the mountain gorges. Here is how Dosten tells the chief who held him prisoner that his mare could no longer live in the plains and longed for the highlands (disdain for the hot plains of Sind and love for the mountains is a common theme of Baluchi poetry) : "Zanghi is my chief; Gwaharam is my leader and friend, owner of marvelous mares. I swear by your beard, by the new- sprouted hair of your face, my mare, pursuer of wild asses, is sado She does not want to drink the water of the Indus, nor eat the reeds and grass of Kar jal of the Sind. She longs for the herds of wild asses of the highlands and misses the sweet pastures, the wild asses of the Pass of Phitokh and wells filled with fresh water. The flies and mosquitos of the desert irritate her0 The reptiles do not let her sleep. The Malwari barley is too coarse for her."</page><page sequence="9">- 51 - And there came a man from Khorasan, his clothes and his face filthy with dust, and he carried with him loads of red dye, bags of finest bhang^ and balls of musk from Qandahar. He had with him a message from the Rind; in truth, a message from Shir en. "There is a rain over Konar, over the plains and the hills of Mangachar and in the sweet valleys of Sanni. The wells are full to the brim and the water trembles like the leaves of the tree of Gwan. It ripples like the waving fields of sugar cane. Cattle herdsmen have begun to move as have Mezhdar, Sahak and Yar Khan, owners of sheep and goats. Women have tied their bundles and the camel drivers have loaded their packs. Through the valleys of Bhanvar and Hagahu the yellow camels have bent their knees, the male camels in long tied lines, the females with their feet hobbled. Shiren has pitched a beautiful tent on the broad land of Narmukh." There frequently was rivalry among the poets of different tribes, each one singing the glories of his race and deprecating the rival tribes. Minstrels were instructed by poets to memorize a particular poem and then referred these minstrels to the rival tribe. Up to this point, we have not given any names of poets 0 The most famous Baluchi composer of love poems is Jhan Durrak, who lived in the second half of the seventeenth century and was persecuted by his prince, Nas ir Khan of Kalat, for disputes over women c The imagination of his expressive songs are very interesting. Avoiding use of artificial rhetoric of standard lyrics, they utilize a technique of construction which is "European" in its emotion: The rain which falls unexpected from the sky comes from the direction of my love. Last night I met her face to face* The sky was aflame with lightning; it is my loved one who woke me. The perfume of her braids sweetly clung to me. The pain of separation sharply stings me during the waking night and leaps up like flame from the wood of Kahir. I stir restlessly in my midnight wake in sweet expectation of meeting my love. Last night the flickering lightning came reeling like a drunkard from the direction of Jalgo, and it brought me a message from my love. It seemed that someone had wrapped my body in a mantle of flowers o To the south, the sky embraced a rainbow, and nearby, an azure cloud seemed to my eyes the face of my love. There is also the poetry of religious theme and moral content, the stories of prophets and saints. The dastanagh, which have a few poems with love themes sung accompanied by the nairighï, or Baluchi flute, are especially prevalent among the mountain Baluchis, while among the city people, the pahëli and the dosukhane, other types of short lyric composi- tions, are common» Some of these are composed during caravan voyages and recount the events of the trip, a kind of lyric comment on daily activity.</page><page sequence="10">- 52 - In Pakistan there is also starting a modern local press and some poets have begun to imitate the Persian ghazal and to use patriotic Islamic themes. Gul Khan Nasir, born about 1910 at Mushki and who studied at Quetta, should be particularly mentioned. He has published a collection of Baluchi poetry called bulbäng ("The Cry") and a history of Baluchistan (tärZkh-i-balüchistan) in Urdu. One of his poems, nafir ("The Trumpet Call") calls young Baluchis to awaken and spring to the defense of Islamic ideals, including an invitation to imitate the Arabs who "march to the reconquest of Israel." Azad Jamaldine, born about 1919, is also from Mushki and in 1953 published A Cry of Defiance &gt; a collection of Baluchi verse, with a prose translation in Urdu. He also writes poetry in Persian and Urdu, and edits the monthly, baluchi* In spite of efforts to create a "written" poetry and prose in Baluchi, the most attractive part of the literature is still the "popular" (oral)"1*' themes. We will close this treatise with a brief three-line song: A sign of death is the burning fever; A sign of approaching rain, the gathering clouds; A sign of love is certainly a smile.</page><page sequence="11">- 53 - NOTES 1.
