<plain_text><page sequence="1">GLENDA ABRAMSON Hellenism Revisited: The Uses of Greek Myth in Modern Hebrew Literature l IT WAS ELIOT WHO PROVIDED the comment that could serve as a contextual summary of modern Hebrew literature: Whoever has approved of this idea of order, of the form of European, of English literature, will not find it preposterous that the past should be altered by the present as much as the present is directed by the past.1 In much the same spirit, Barukh Kurzweil maintained that modern ism consists of more than freedom of structure and increased imagery alone but that it is a continuing confrontation with every part of the poet's cultural heritage.2 Modern poetry, he said, is noted for its astonishing knowledge of its own sources, the heritage upon which it builds while striving to conform to a new reality. "Modernism without this confronta tion, and which does not know the dialectical process between the negation and affirmation of the past," he continues, "is only a fashionable modernism that quickly passes." He was, of course, referring to the poet's own cultural tradition. Despite his generally rather tendentious and often contradictory critical approach to Hebrew poetry, Kurzweil is pointing to a trend in European Symbolist and post-Symbolist literature which con firms his position, a culturally determined allusiveness which has its source in mythology derived from classical antiquity. The literature has developed within a precise framework of language, reference, tradition and belief, the recourse to the myth as a subtext having allowed the writers to place themselves in a culturally defined context in which and PROOFTEXTS 10 (1990): 237-255 ? 1990 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">238 GLENDA ABRAMSON from which they are able to create a new literary world. Joyce's Ulysses must be the most celebrated modern example of this procedure, and various other works, mainly dramatic, as effectively demonstrate the marriage of classical myth and modern thought.3 Although critical of the Hebrew poets' exact methodology Kurzweil recognized the references to Jewish tradition in their works and would perhaps have been gratified to discover that allusiveness remains a fundamental component of Hebrew literary aesthetics. There has been a great deal of scholarly discussion about Judaic allusiveness and intertex tuality associated with Jewish religious sources. Robert Alter, for one, speaks of . . . the pecular central tradition of the Hebrew novel in which the principal rhetorical device is literary allusion . . . [By means of this] a continual tension?usually a pointed ironic tension?is set up between the reminis cence of lofty spiritual ideals in the language and the fallen nature of the world which the language describes.4 This precisely describes the method employed by the majority of Israeli poets at some time in their career, and also of Eliot, Yeats and, to a certain extent, Pound, in opposing idealism with disappointed irony in their poetry based on myths. The Hebrew writers' recourse to Greek mythological sources, which is the subject of this study, has not as often been remarked as their Judaic allusiveness, despite there having been an outstanding precedent for mythological reference, in Shaul Tchernichowsky. The use of Greek myth by twentieth-century Hebrew poets does not constitute a trend but features sporadically in works from the yishuv period to modern Israel. There is no sustained historical impetus for such classical exploitation; in fact there were very few excursions into mythology by earlier Hebrew poetry, probably because of the age-old distrust of Hellenism as idolatry. Only in the nineteenth century, when Nietszchean ideas were sweeping Europe and entered Hebrew literature through Berdichewsky, did a greater interest in classical literature awaken. Kurzweil, of course, was wary of Berdichewsky's eagerness for certain features of Nietszchean ideology, defining his advocacy of it as "merely didactic and polemical rhetoric. . . ."5 Yet the spirit of the Jewish renaissance emanated from the romantic nationalism of nineteenth-century Europe and the new elements of humanism in Jewish literature were closer to the Hellenic mood than to that of traditional Judaism.6 With the entrenchment of secular literature, humanism occupied the world-view of the majority of Hebrew writers and for some of them classical mythology, like their own Jewish sources, came to offer an abundance of conceptual potential. Tchernichowsky was the most prominent among the Hebrew poets of the early twentieth century to plunder a non-Judaic system for his paradigms and metaphors. He appeared to some in his day to be</page><page sequence="3">Greek Myth in Modern Hebrew Literature 239 threatening Jewish spiritual absolutes from a standpoint uniquely estab lished as dangerous and destructive: that of Hellenism and pagan Canaan ism. This perceived threat derived from his adherence to the romantic movement, epitomized, for him, by Schlegel, Schiller and particularly by Goethe. Goethe's romanticism, conservative as it ultimately was, embraced all of nature, paganism and pantheism; like Tchernichowsky he was called "the great pagan," although in Goethe's case the term was not pejorative. No one can any longer believe that Tchernichowsky advocated praying to the Greek gods, yet as symbols they constituted a pervasive part of his romantic world-view. He used the heroes of myth as symbols in the creation of a new ideal, that of instinctual, elemental mankind versus society and its restraints, and he injected this ideology into his Judaic world. He used myth to invoke a distant culture which retained its vitality for him, and which he could contrast with the austere authority of a later tradition in the spirit of Leconte de Lisle's condemnations of Christianity's neglect of beauty. Tchernichowsky's poetics counterposes one cultural system against another, to formulate a dialectical literary syncretism. His pagan gods and heroes are symbols for an idea that dominates his poetic thinking; his emphasis on the Hellenic ideal in poems such as Sirtutim, for example, is similarly a dogmatic statement, or a reiteration of a world-view derived from romantic ideologies. The Greece summoned by the European and English romantic revival of classical mythology was not that of Sophocles and Socrates, but a roman tic fantasy; it is certainly no more than a vision in Sirtutim. 2 Since the Hebrew poets already possess a massive wealth of source material within their own culture, why should they borrow at all from external sources? Tchernichowsky made his purpose quite clear. His Hebrew poetic descendants resort to Greek mythology for different reasons although they have employed the same process of recognition of earlier myths or texts, and traditions not their own. While we recognize the poets' recognitions we are perhaps not as certain of their purpose. Their choice of particular myths is clearly more than convenience, rather, a matter of expressive artistic need, with their usage indicating a number of conceptual possibilities. First, this usage signals the poets' radical discontinuity with their own traditional past. The examples I have chosen as illustrations are taken from the corpus of poets belonging to three critically-demarcated generations: the "transitional" generation of the yishuv (Leah Goldberg), the ambiguous and inaccurately termed "Palmah" generation (Haim Guri, Yehuda Amichai, Nathan Yonatan, Nathan Zach) and the "State"generation (Dalia Ravikovitch). Whether or not they were</page><page sequence="4">240 GLENDA ABRAMSON born there, the cultural roots of all these poets are in the diaspora, and in some cases (Goldberg, Amichai) their relationship either to their personal or traditional history is equivocal. Second, the poets attempt to select narratives which they consider to be recognizable as universal paradigms instead of being confined only to Jewish tradition, in "a nostalgia for world culture/' to use Mandelstam's phrase.7 They require paradigms for the sake of "figuration/' in Alan Mintz's formulation,8 not derived from Jewish sources. Third, the poets implicitly identify the nature of Hebrew literature as being of European descent, by their adoption of the mechanisms of the European Renais sance and recourse to classical mythology in place of Jewish religious sources, in addition to other poetics associated with European literary movements. This complies with the poets' need to alter their traditional contexts. Fourth, James Diamond observes that "an artist who designs to write in Hebrew in the modern period rightfully can and must relate to the sacral literature of the past as his legitimate, exclusive and treasured cultural possession. But at the same time, because it is a sacral literature, it must of necessity constitute a problem for him."9 The development of modern Hebrew has, to a large extent, checked the automatic evocation of classical Jewish sources with every word or phrase. By utilizing non Judaic mythological sources the poets are further shifting the context of the language. The shock of the language encountering an alien cultural setting becomes an ironic comment in itself. Finally, and, I believe, most importantly, invoking mythological sto ries may be a pointer to the breakdown of ideological cohesion, for the use of non-Judaic sources no longer signifies treachery to the national culture. It offers the poets a means of making significant statements without having to depend on paradigms exclusively related to a religious order, itself dominated by the hand of God. Tchernichowsky was pilloried not only for doing that, but for using the pagan archetypes as a didactic means of rebuke to his own religious system. The artistic problem is then ultimately a philosophical and religious one. In the works of a number of English and European artists the choice of classical myth as a means of reinterpreting a later age signified a rebellion against traditional religion: To men like Shelley . . . myth became a new language in which the essential religious truths could be re-expressed.... It was no accident that when Blake and Shelley desired to give utterance to the yearning for a regeneration of mankind through love neither chose the figure of Christ for the sufferer and the redeemer; the one took the figure of Albion who should awake from his sleep, and the other the figure of Prometheus tortured upon his rock.10 Like the German novelist, Hermann Broch, who discerned the close link between religious aspirations and mythological structures,11 and like Shelley and Blake, the modern Hebrew poets have grasped a method by which "essential religious truths" can be re-expressed outside of an</page><page sequence="5">Greek Myth in Modern Hebrew Literature 241 established religious system. Their mythological poems surmount a purely personal expression in order to represent certain "essential reli gious truths"?"religious" meaning transcendent, ethical or universal? without being illustrated by Judaism. The poets' choice of classical myth over Jewish sources appears to be less a matter of assuming the myth's "nuclear idea" derived from an alien theological or cultural system, than modifying their own religiously-oriented traditional resonances. There is no significant philosophical difference in the means by which poets of different literary generations incorporate the myths, although there are stylistic features which characterize an earlier generation. Even these, however, are not consistent. For example, Leah Goldberg employs rhyme and metre and generally operates within formal lyric structures. Guri occasionally uses rhyme and tends to favor anaphora but his prosodic devices are not indicative of a school of poetry. The major divergence exists between Tchernichowsky and his followers since his recourse to myth was a functional part both of his poetics and his philosophy, which held the two cultural systems in juxtaposition. The contemporary writers do no such thing but they do demonstrate three noticeable methods by which they utilize the myths in their poetry: as simple analogy with myth largely serving a symbolic or allegorical purpose, the mythic heroes are not even archetypes since the destiny or ideology represented by their characters is ignored. A second method is a more sophisticated melding of Greek narrative and Jewish meaning and a third, is a tentative exploration of tragic capacity. The poets rarely explore the redemptive value of myth because the emotional structures of tragedy?according to Jaspers, struggle, guilt, suffering and death12?are not central to Judaic consciousness. A few of the poems summon the ideas of tragedy, or at least allude to tragic action, but generally aware ness of mystery in the myth becomes no more than an awareness of the mystery of human emotional responses. 3 The Odyssey provided modern Hebrew poets of different literary periods with the means for constructing elaborate metaphors for various areas of experience. There is no one in the Bible like Odysseus the wanderer, each of whose adventures provides a potential storehouse of imagery. At least four modern poets have raided this particular store house, Leah Goldberg, Nathan Yonatan, Yehuda Amichai and Haim Guri, each offering a varied personal interpretation of the story and its protago nist, reshaping the myth to give it diverse ideological meanings. Eisig Silberschlag observes that "[the fact that] some mythical fragments like the myth of Oedipus and Odysseus have exerted a greater power on the</page><page sequence="6">242 GLENDA ABRAMSON modern imagination than any other is an interesting fact that opens up windows into the psychology of its users and into the condition of modern man in the post-mythical age." This is no less applicable to modern Israel, where the figure of Odysseus the wanderer returning home has a particular potency. The examples that follow illustrate the metaphorical or allegorical function of the Odysseus myth in the Hebrew poems. Odysseus in his guise of warrior provides some of the poets with a particularly evocative archetype. In "The Lament of Odysseus" (Qinat Odysseus, 1948) Leah Goldberg has set her story in the context of the original yet, in order to comment on the nature of survival, she has extracted from the story one episode alone, Odysseus' visit to Hades in Book 11 of The Odyssey (the Nekuia), and altered its emotional focus. Her Odysseus descends to Hades after a fierce battle and confronts the dead of his army. Weary of wandering and grown old, Odysseus descended to Hades To seek the welfare of comrades slain by the sword. The shades of dead companions greeted him at the gate, His ears recall their weeping and death-cries? How are the mighty fallen! The flight of vultures over stench and decay. The one alive is a thousandfold alone among the dead. I come to Hades to beg your forgiveness. For we escaped great danger. A comrade's death is a mark of shame on my forehead, A mark of shame is my continued life, My ears recall your death cries. How are the mighty fallen! Goldberg transforms the literal illustrated in the story to the figura tive and invests it with an altered sensibility: Odysseus becomes a symbol of the survivor's guilt, since he is the only one left alive among the host of warriors. While this particular category of guilt is not unique to the Jewish experience, it has been widely discussed in the context of the Holocaust. In his monograph on Leah Goldberg Tuvia R?bner reports that she had difficulty in expressing her response to the Holocaust and therefore communicated it indirectly and reflectively. She herself wrote: One of my critics claimed that I do better in poems in which I deal with something "objective/' He cited "The Lament of Odysseus" as an example. I don't know whether I've ever written a more subjective poem! It was written during the war and I wanted to express the encounter with the dead, the encounter of a person who carries in his heart the guilt of remaining alive.13 The dead of Odysseus' army may therefore become the dead of another, later, war, yet the spirit of the original is retained in the hexame</page><page sequence="7">Greek Myth in Modern Hebrew Literature 243 ter and pentameter of the poem, and further formalized by a biblical refrain. Goldberg has therefore not only appropriated an episode from The Odyssey in order to express a deeply felt dilemma closely allied to Jewish experience, but also combined elements of two disparate texts which reinforce each other. Her fidelity to classical metre in the Hebrew distinguishes Goldberg from later poets who dispense with metrical allusiveness, retaining only the narrative as their source. Nathan Yonatan published "If We Live in the Sad Song" (Lu nihyeh bashirah hanugah) in 1974, almost thirty years after the publication of Goldberg's poem, and a year after the death of his son in the Yom Kippur War. This dark poem utilizes The Odyssey as a metaphor for modern war and its deadly aftermath, with Odysseus and his men the representatives of soldiers both living and dead. Yonatan's title is a textual allusion to a scene in Book 1 of The Odyssey where Telemachus, Penelope and the Suitors listen to the bard's song about the Achaens' return from Troy and the disasters visited upon them by Pallas Athene. Yonatan's "sad song" is a song of war and of memorialization. After the passage of years heavy with sea-waves of pride and salt Odysseus returns home, Winter already ploughing the sea, Without his comrades?Diomedes is defeated, The bravest of the sons of Hellas, Ajax, is dead, Elpenor rests alone on the seashore. Him alone Have the gods forgotten. He returns to his Ithaca, embraces Telemachus, His vein-swollen hands touch his streaming cheek While the rain weeps on their faces, on the olive groves, On the meadow. It drops On the Achean mounds, on their heavy clods of earth. Yonatan's language imitates the original, simple and declarative, with the narrative breadth of epic. He displays a greater recourse to the Homeric text than do his fellow poets but he also adds a later convention, that of the pathetic fallacy, in his description of the climate and country side of Ithaca. His Odysseus makes his way back to his family in a land where the landscape and the living are harsh and dark. There is no joy in his return. He is old and weary, preoccupied with the dead. The vocabu lary of the poem supports the adjective nugah (sad) in the title, in its emphasis on isolation, darkness, winter, rain, fog, gloom and heaviness. The heroes, Diomedes, Ajax, and Elpenor lie in "Rhadamantes' field" while Odysseus alone bears the heavy burden of life. He takes up the narrative which proceeds in the first person: "They are all there, in Hades, without me / therefore I am sad of soul," and he remembers Circe and Nausicaa. The poem is a bitter exposition not so much of war but of a life wasted in futile wandering which has left the warrior exhausted and</page><page sequence="8">244 GLENDA ABRAMSON estranged from his wife and son. An earlier generation might have seen this poem as an allegory of Jewish fate; the modern Hebrew poets take the archetypes as symbols of individual response to familiar experience in their own time, war and the loss of security and settled values. Both "The Lament of Odysseus" and "If We Live in the Sad Song" are comments on the outcome of modern wars, taking Odysseus and his conflicts as paradigms of experience known to the poets themselves. Like Goldberg, Yonatan presents the underworld as a focus of his poem, following the Homeric Odysseus' visit to Hades which represents an important psychological encounter and an idea which has no exact parallel in the Jewish sources.14 Their awareness of Hades allows the Odysseuses of Goldberg and Yonatan to confront and commune with their dead, a poetic concretization of the "memory" with which other Hebrew poets suffice when writing about the war dead. Despite the number of warriors and heroes in the Bible, Goldberg and Yonatan have selected Odysseus to represent the returning soldier and, more signifi cantly, the lone survivor. Mindful of Homer's Nekuia, and in the absence of a Judaic parallel, they explore the possibility of meeting the dead once again, in poems which incorporate a sense both of guilt and of unbearable separation. Yehuda Amichai, in "Takis Sinopoulos, a Greek Poet" (1968), reviews the myth differently, selecting the motif of Odysseus' exile from his native land to comment on the condition of a twentieth-century poet. His lyric "I" visits Sinopoulos, a Greek poet living in an apartment house in Rome, and comments on his restrictive heart ailment. They survey the city from Sinopoulos' fourth floor balcony. Amichai takes a literal example from The Odyssey, Odysseus electing to be lashed to the mast in order to resist the Sirens' song, and casts it as a metaphor for a situation in the present time, Sinopoulos' unwilling restriction to his own mast, his illness which hampers his creativity. The poem brings to mind a comment made by the pianist Sviatoslav Richter after he had visited the ailing Prokofiev: "He was alone and somehow completely grown soft," Richter reported. "His voice was subdued. 'They won't let me write,' he [Prokofiev] said, 'the doctors won't let me write.'" In a more literal sense, Sinopoulos' illness, his metaphorical confinement on the mast, prevents his ever returning to Greece and condemns him to physical and creative exile. Guri's "Odysseus" (1960) is perhaps the best known of the Hebrew poems in this subject, using the return of Odysseus to express the much discussed disillusionment of Guri's post-'48 generation. It describes the homecoming of the hero who finally reaches his city, "his native town which was not water," only to remain unwelcomed and alien in a changed world speaking an incomprehensible language. Odysseus, whose life has been on water, encounters dry land where he will not be recognized. He is the symbol either of a universal principle of profound emotional</page><page sequence="9">Greek Myth in Modern Hebrew Literature 245 change?a function of age or absence, or of a more specific change in a society which misunderstands and then rejects the returning soldier. There is sufficient evidence in the poetry and criticism of the 50s to substantiate this Odyssean symbol of ideological estrangement. In this poem Guri writes against the classical story of acceptance and forgive ness, and against the reader's anticipation of its happy outcome. His Odysseus exists in an open-ended narrative, remaining unknown in a world that has altered beyond any possibility of contact; only nature has remained constant and familiar. Dew came and fell on his head. A wind came, and kissed his lips. Water came, and bathed his feet like old Eurykleia, But didn't see the scar, and flowed on, as water does. 4 The poems I have referred to utilize the myths of Odysseus as metaphors or analogies for existential situations in the Hebrew poets' own time. Through the classical stories they meditate on general aspects of the human condition encompassing war, loss and grief, and on individual experience. These poets have reduced the borrowed work to only one of its narrative elements, the visit to Hades or the return of the hero, which they abstract from the whole and transform to the figurative. Together with this largely figurative function some of these poems combine two cultural systems, the mythic and the Judaic, either by recontextualization or by Hebrew linguistic reference within the frame work of the myth. Despite their assumption of the lineaments of an order outside their own religiously-oriented tradition, the poets show that the context of their poetry is neither pagan, nor even romantic in the sense of romanticism's replacement of traditional religion with a new faith of nature, beauty and humanism. The Hebrew poetry based on myth still functions within a Jewish framework of sorts. For example, in addition to her quotation of a biblical verse, Leah Goldberg has her Odysseus obliquely compare himself to Cain and in his remorse he alludes directly to Genesis 4:10 and 4:15 in addition to 2 Samuel 1:25. Many of the poems offer similar examples: Zach's Orpheus in "Orpheus Shouts" (Orpheus tsocek) hangs his harp on a tree, in an echo of Psalm 137:2. We are not told why he does so, whether he intends to join those who have done the same in mourning for their Temple; we are told only that his own intense grief begins when his harp is stolen. Yehuda Amichai has another Odysseus who will return home unrecognized, even by his faithful hound, after a voyage through life towards a bitter maturity.15 The Bible and Homer are combined in his poem, with the frequently repeated biblical phrase "and</page><page sequence="10">246 GLENDA ABRAMSON he lifted up his eyes and saw" subverted by Amichai in a disillusioned claim that for his Odysseus there is nothing to see. Ben-Zion Tomer's "Icarus" invokes Kohelet 9:9 ("He was reminded of all the women he had loved"); in Tuvia R?bner's complex "Orpheus" the description of the hero's joy at the prospect of seeing Eurydice again is linguistically reminiscent of Exodus 15:1 in its use of shirah with go'ot and the echo of the biblical ga'oh ga'ah in the poem's hay oh hay ah. Judaization of Greek mythology has an early precedent in Moshe Haim Luzzatto's conversion of Eros into a Hebraized abstraction, "Desire" (heshek), in his play, Ma'aseh Shimshon. The judaization of the modern texts, however, rests in more than such conversions or in textual reference alone. In fact one of the questions to be asked is not how the texts are judaized, but whether or to what extent they have remained doctrinally mythologized other than in borrowings of names and certain details from ancient stories, and whether in fact the judaization is merely in the lack of presentation of integral mythic factors. The most substantive metho dological difference between the poems based on myth and those with biblical subtexts is in the nature of the allusions. The Israeli poets' customary play on biblical and liturgical texts provides them with a strategy of irony which they cannot obtain from the classical Greek texts. The resonances of the myth must therefore derive from the narrative or the characters, not from the language. In "Odysseus" Guri alludes to The Odyssey by telescoping the entire epic into a single moment through a conglomeration of general contextual elements of the original: sea, waves, water, the Greek language, the scar, and the name, Eurykleia. In poems which ?re wholly based on biblical sources intertextuality is used as a central device: the biblical text becomes the paramount entity of the poem, for example in these lines from Guri's "My Samsons": The green withes are broken, the riddles are solved, my first grey hairs. See, my Samsons are returning, no nails in their eyes; they return to me from Gath when the fire fades away. See, my Samsons are returning to the thickness of their nights lit with foxes of fire. This is unlike "Odysseus" which of necessity emphasizes the centrality not of the original text, but of the story. There is no substitute for the poets' familiarity with the language of the text, their cultural key. Yet a needed paradigm is not always available to them within their own cultural system. Guri's "Odysseus" and Nathan Zach's celebrated "Orpheus" (1974) are two of the mythological poems which remain entirely within their own referential world. "Orpheus" combines a number of methodologies,</page><page sequence="11">Greek Myth in Modern Hebrew Literature 247 some listed by Ziva Ben Porat in her paper on the canonization of foreign texts,16 among them, the "filling in" or amplification of a detail in the original text. In addition to his elaborating on a significant moment in the Orpheus myth, Zach's contrived and untranslateable language in "Orpheus" reinforces its gravity, and the location of his variation in its own world is further emphasized by his use of a choral monologue entreating Orpheus to remain behind. The mythological framework per mits Zach to meditate on matters of fear, isolation and psychological compulsion contrasted to free will. The dramatic instant of mythical Orpheus' descent for the sake of obsessive love has no equal in the Bible, except, perhaps, for the case of King David's moral plunge for love of Bathsheba. The myth itself serves as a metaphor for a powerful and inexpressible emotion, or for the awareness of experience too awful for coherent expression, and by means of the jagged chorus Zach plays upon the reader's knowledge of the pitiful ending to the story. Zach's epic-style "Daniel in the Lions' Den" (Daniel begov ha'arayot) is more positively cross-referential in its evolution of the mythic hero into the angst-ridden but defiant Jewish one. Or it reveals the opposite, the mythologization of Judaic sources to conform with tragic precepts. Appearing in the 1982 collection, Kol hehalav vehadevash, it is the latest of Zach's Orpheus poems, "Orpheus Turns his Head" (Orpheus mafneh et harosh)f and "Orpheus Shouts" (Orpheus tso'ek) and the most famous of the series, "Orpheus." In "Daniel in the Lions' Den" Zach presents an Orpheus-like character, the biblical Daniel, who makes his own descent: When Daniel went down into the lion's den he found darkness there, and howling and corpses lying face to face. Daniel was a prophet, he appears in the Widsom books, carefully he made his way, so no one should be harmed, Aramaic at his service. Step by step and by the cold and the memory of his righteousness. Daniel wept. My God, my God, why have you forsaken me, why have you cast me into the lions' den. How will I get out. How could you do such a thing to me. Descending Orpheus, in the eponymous poem, similarly faced with the pit, is urged not to go. That poem begins, AI redet; "Daniel in the Lions' Den" begins Keshedaniel yarad.17 It continues with Daniel's lament to God and counterposes the righteous prophet and his unjust fate, in this way denying the biblical text in which God aided Daniel and his companions. While a tragic perception dominates this poem it is crisscrossed with validating biblical quotations, from the books of Daniel, Psalms, Proverbs and from Numbers, with the biblical allusions frequently self-referential. At the same time the description of the den of lions is not very different from that of Hades in "Orpheus" (Zach uses both terms, gov and bor), and</page><page sequence="12">248 GLENDA ABRAMSON Daniel's fate appears to fulfill the dire warnings offered to Orpheus by the chorus. In the third stanza Daniel begins, Orpheus-like, to sing. He "comes to terms" (hu mashlim Hm hehaser) with his loss of God. The lions become his emissaries (arayot hem tsirav ushelihav) just as the lion and the tiger lay beside Orpheus their master. Finally Daniel, like Orpheus, succumbs to the dark mystery of the descent; God has failed to help him and the king mourns his loss, a king who has snakes in his hair. Like "Orpheus," "Daniel in the Lions' Den" is a story of compulsion, or determinism which ends in death. On that night the king could not sleep [Esther 6:1] All night he remembered Daniel in great danger [Lam. 1:3] Man among men, into the pit, Thrown to be the lions7 prey. He woke at dawn from his heavy sleep, And there were snakes in his hair. The stone which shattered the image [Dan. 2:34] Became a great mountain and filled the whole earth. [Dan. 2:35] But there was none that could interpret. [Gen. 41:8] The biblical story of Daniel has a happy ending, for Daniel, anyway. The Orpheus myth does not, nor does Zach's poem about Daniel. Daniel's body is torn, as was that of the mythic Orpheus, and the dread of the chorus is fulfilled. My thoughts trouble me My words shall be heard Until the day dawns, or until In another, glorious place, My torn body will bloom. Daniel's insistence on prophesying reminds that a tradition of typology linking Orpheus and Dionysus indicates the possible divinity of Orpheus as a god of the death and rebirth of vegetation or a semi-divine mediator between the gods and mankind; on the other hand, the mortal Orpheus' connection with rite makes him a prophet (theologos) who had priests and disciples committed to writing down his holy words.18 In Zach's poem the Orpheus myth has been blended with the tale of Daniel, to provide a defiant, therefore tragic, Jewish prophetic hero. Abandoned by an uncar ing God he is still suffused with pietas and prepared to fulfil his mission, to descend into the pit in order to confront his destiny and perhaps be reborn through nature. "Daniel" reveals a second method of judaization, in fact both the judaization of myth based on the narrative element common to the stories of Orpheus and Daniel, descent into a dangerous place, and the invest ment of the Judaic source with mythic precepts. A third method of judaization rests in the mingling of ingredients taken from mythology</page><page sequence="13">Greek Myth in Modern Hebrew Literature 249 with the Jewish world-view. As in Leah Goldberg's poem, one narrative (or text) becomes an analogy of the other. The borrowed mythic elements are manipulated in order to present traits and responses which are incompatible with their inherent world-view. The Israeli mythological poems frequently reveal a Judaic approach to experience as they alter the moral premises of the mythic world to conform with their own. For example, Goldberg's Odysseus returns to Hades in order to beg forgive ness from his dead companions and to express his guilt for being alive. The visit of Homer's Odysseus to the underworld (the Nekuia) is a symbolic representation of his conquest of death and his transformation, for after encountering the shades he returns alive from Hades. Goldberg's Odysseus confronts the shades of his own world in order to apologize for remaining alive, an attitude unthinkable for the Homeric hero who escaped death in numerous adventures and lived to reclaim his rightful kingship in honor and glory. The classical Odysseus was rec ognized by Eumaeus, Telemachus, Eurykleia, and the dog, Argus. His return home was ultimately triumphant, unlike Guri's hero in "Odysseus" who returns almost unnoticed, remains unrecognized and unwelcomed in a place which is itself unrecognizable. Nathan Yonatan's Odysseus is also old and weary, preoccupied with the dead and his own death, alienated from his Penelope and bitterly tired of war. We cannot ignore the date of the poem's composition. Guri's Odysseus endures as an alien, his exile continuing despite his homecoming. To Guri and Amichai, Odysseus' protracted and enforced absence from home is the most significant symbolic confirmation of their world-view. Amichai's Takis/ Odysseus is, like Guri's, a lonely alien in a strange land; to all these Jewish poets Odysseus is a permanent exile, exemplifying an altered morality, and distanced from the ideology which sent him forth on his voyage. Homer's Odysseus was viewed in the fifth century as the prototype of pragmatism, "a practical politician for whom the end justified the means and who was devoid of scruples."19 These traits are sustained in the dramas by Sophocles in which Odysseus appears but are not any part of the Israeli appropriation of him. Nor do the Israeli poets' rendition of Odysseus recall Canto XXVI of The Inferno, itself removed from the mighty intentions of the original, or the hero as "crafty Ulysses." Dante portrays Odysseus as "seeking above all knowledge of the virtues and vices of mankind, and as symbolizing the restless drive of the intellect, in its dedication to knowledge forgetful even of the limitations imposed by God."20 Amichai alone of the Israeli poets creates an aged voyager, Takis Sinopolous, whose quest, although curtailed by infirmity, most resembles that of Dante's Ulysses: Sinopoulos "listens" and he "hears." The con stant attribute of all the judaized Odysseuses is weary old age; the location of the story is either in confrontation with the dead or in Odysseus's exhausted return home. The epic adventures through which</page><page sequence="14">250 GLENDA ABRAMSON Homer's Odysseus triumphs and Dante's Ulysses seeks wisdom are irrelevant to the Hebrew poets and are mentioned in passing only by Yonatan. Awareness of loss and of self is all that remains to the Israeli hero, and a sad reckoning with the dubious wisdom of maturity, in the spirit of Ecclesiastes rather than Homer. 5 The fourth and most convincing judaization of the myths is in the elimination of all mystery or ritual implication. It was their religious significance that distinguished myths from folktales or legends, for myths were recollections of the archetypal sacred. I suggested earlier that the artistic problem for the Israeli poets utilizing mythological sources ulti mately becomes a religious and philosophical one. The crux of myth is the relationship of humanity with divine powers. In addition it describes the unfolding destiny of the gods and also indicates the existence of a realm of power to which they themselves are subject. In European and Ameri can writing on mythological themes the gods are either represented or symbolized, and the fundamental struggle of mortal and immortal is generally preserved albeit internalized, in keeping with the psychological bias of our time. Israeli mythological poetry does not encounter the divinities, some times terrifying, sometimes capricious and arbitrary, against whom man contests. Frequently the Jewish God in the poetry of Zach and Amichai in particular exhibits the anthropomorphic failings which the Greeks often attributed to their gods but the obverse is not true of Israeli mythopoetry: the gods, so much an accompaniment to the adventures of mythic heroes, are absent and theodicy is not an issue. The anthropocentrism of the poems shifts them from the realm of mythology into that of symbol. The choice of biblical archetypes instantly implies a relationship with God, as we have seen in the case of Zach's Daniel and in a great deal of Hebrew allusive poetry. However, the Israeli writers ignore the theological world of the myth and its frequent realization in tragedy. They are able to free their mythological heroes from the strictures of divine imperative, despite their evocation in their poetry of "essential religious truths," love, suffer ing, sacrifice, and redemption. Orpheus, for example, is historically an embodiment of devotion and piety, a mediator of the divine, associated with the mysteries and, in his virtue of a good shepherd, is sometimes seen as a prototype of Christ. Yet the cultic value of Orpheus is generally ignored by Israeli poetry on the subject in its recollection of only the most superficial outlines of the story, and of the single trait of Orpheus' musicianship. Hermes, so important an element in Rilke's evocation of the Orpheus myth, does not appear at all in Zach's Orpheus poems, nor</page><page sequence="15">Greek Myth in Modern Hebrew Literature 251 does the god Hades when Zach's and Leah Goldberg's mythic heroes visit the underworld. R?bner's lyrical "Orpheus" hints at redemption but it is Zach's "Daniel in the Lions' Den" that is the notable exception: the mysteries are central to the poem, with Orpheus' Christlike attributes suggested by the quotation from Psalm 22. Despite his/her avoidance of the gods and the mysteries the writer's choice of myth frequently signifies the potential choice of the tragic perception. Greek mythology reflects an intricate ethical structure, and the possibility of its violation and the consequences of this violation for the individual and for society create the matter for tragedy. The origins of Greek tragedy lay in the mythological setting of a cosmic drama with its clashing divine and mortal powers. Tragedy has been defined as "an affair with the gods," concerned far more with man and the divine than with man and man. Israel's was a moral drama, growing out of the tension between the will of the Almighty God and that of humanity. Yet the Greeks created dramatic art out of mankind's struggle with the gods and fate while the Jews presumed that for them absolute submission to the idea of God's absolute decree replaced struggle. With its emphasis on God's unquestionable justice, Judaism was unable to suit the spiritual conditions of tragedy. This has not prevented some Hebrew writers from attempting to create tragic stories out of biblical material and to find in the Bible evidence of tragic form despite Kurzweil's observation that the biblical text is a document of faith deriving from an ethic totally at variance with the one that gave rise to Greek tragedy.21 For example, due to its adoption of the ethical rather than the tragic Judaism is unable to come to terms with the story of the Akedah. In the tragic world Abraham would have killed. Yet the tragedy potentially rests in God's command rather than in Abraham's obedience, a command for which the mortal would ultimately have had to bear full responsibility. Intimations of tragedy would rest in the uncertainty concerning God's purpose and the questionable morality of his command, for the possibility of divine error is fundamental to tragedy. Also, it is the world in which such things were possible, opposed to the Jewish world, that is tragic, not always the deed itself. For Judaism God's command is never questioned and is always known to be moral; consequently the biblical Akedah story has a happy ending and the hero is not required to suffer retribution. The ethical overcomes the tragic. Only later writings attest to the unease of scholars in the face of God's perplexing demand to Abraham. Most of the fundamental elements of tragic thought are comparably absent from the modern Israeli mythological poems, despite their tragic potential. The poets have retained the ethical core of their own tradition instead of relinquishing it to the tragic. They have not permitted the assumption of the tragic vision which explains suffering, which appor</page><page sequence="16">252 GLENDA ABRAMSON tions blame to the gods, which admits fate. However, exceptions, like Zach's "Daniel," provide a sense of tragic modality without entirely sacrificing their own moral world-view; these include: Leah Goldberg's "Antigone" and Dalia Ravikovitch's "The Robe" (Habeged). "Antigone" (1959) is the relentlessly sad confrontation of a person with herself, in a bitter emotional reckoning in the framework of the legendary Antigone's final agony. Try to sleep. Now try to rest. It is thus. Thus it is. Everything as promised. It is not treachery. All is written on the record of the earth That bore you. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. With their shrilling The birds drenched the sunrise of the dead. And those remaining alive Stayed in the town, the market, the road, the houses. You alone stumbled among the tombs. Every grave Told only you that on judgment day You'll testify to everything, but your reckoning Won't be beyond this world. Goldberg's heroine retains the tragic quality of her mythic forebear in her struggle to accept her destiny with resignation. The point of Goldberg's version, however, is that Antigone's judgment is in this world, in the realm of personal responsibility rather than in the ruling of the gods. She is not answerable even to the dead, only to herself. The chorus-like lyric voice urges Antigone to accept with resignation something that appears to be even worse than fate: self-judgment. With Antigone's tragic struggle internalized, she is both mortal heroine and god. The tragic drama of recognition and suffering becomes an inner one, with its outcome sus pended, as ominous as the clouds "hanging on the horizon like dead witnesses / to what will not happen." The legendary heroine hanged herself. Goldberg's heroine endures; but the grim interior landscape and the outer landscape of dryness, unnatural storm-clouds which are heavy but barren, references to the dead, the dry, choking earth, and silent tears, represent both Antigones' isolated desperation. Finally the choral voice offers some hope by referring obliquely to the Argive dead as those who have suffered a similar introspective journey and survived; in this way Goldberg preserves the tragic possibility of reconciliation, in this case with the self. In its suggestion of sin and retribution Ravikovitch's "The Robe" contains stronger intimations of tragedy. It is based on a detail of a little known myth that tells of Creusa (or Glauce) who was to marry Jason, Medea's divorced husband. As vengeful as ever, Medea sent Creusa a magnificent but deadly dress as a wedding present, a dress impregnated with poison which burnt her with an inextinguishable fire. Ravikovitch's</page><page sequence="17">Greek Myth in Modern Hebrew Literature 253 heroine is presented with a dress of fire which she not only accepts despite dire warnings, but subsumes as part of herself. The poem debates the fatefulness of pitting desire against the ordered world and conven tional morality, represented by a cautioning female voice, the choral voice that is a feature of a large proportion of the mythological poems. The content of "The Robe" is determined by the lyric "I" 's comment, "I don't believe in Greek tragedies," after having intimated that she knows the meaning of tragedy: You remember, I said to her, when I was six, They washed my hair with shampoo and I went out into the street. The scent of the shampoo followed me like a cloud. Afterwards I became ill from the wind and the rain. I didn't know yet how to read Greek tragedies. The "wind and the rain" are the agents of punishment for seeking the tantalizing perfume. Notwithstanding her illness the heroine courts retri bution again in the fiery robe, deliberately rejecting the lessons of tragedy. I know, I said, but not to take care. That perfume unsettles me. I said to her: No one need agree with me, I don't believe in Greek tragedies. But the dress, she said, the dress burning with fire. What are you saying, I cried, what are you saying? I'm not wearing a dress at all, It's me who is on fire. These and other "tragic" poems, notably Ben-Zion Tomer's "Icarus," avoid confrontation with the gods, and propose humanity against itself as the only crucial arena.22 Neither God nor the gods are anywhere to be found as judge or arbiter, leaving the individuals alone with their fate. That the solutions to the problems of suffering, retribution, grief, isola tion, fear, and desire which myth sought to explore, are not to be found within an established religious system is perhaps the overt message of the Israeli mythopoems. At the same time, the ethical subtext of the Israeli mythological poetry holds it firmly in the Judaic tradition, so that it does not have to be overtly judaized at all. Only Zach in "Daniel in the Lion's Den" chose the tragic over the ethical, for his Daniel died, the victim of a cruel God whom he vilifies. In this case the Judaic source is mythologized and the ethical embodied in the biblical story is rejected. The judaization of the mythic sources rests, in most cases, in retaining only the shadow of the myth while supplying it with a substance belonging to the Israeli poets' own cultural tradition. Ultimately all the Odysseuses, Orpheuses and other heroes and heroines reflect on their actions, lives and societies within the bounds of this tradition. The myths</page><page sequence="18">254 GLENDA ABRAMSON serve as symbols, paradigms and analogies rather than as the representa tives or the suggestion of cultural alternatives. The borrowing is of narrative and nomenclature, not of system. Ultimately these poems forego both paganism and Judaism, and the relationship in both systems of humanity with divine powers, in their placement of the hero's psycho logical experience at the center of their discourse. Significantly the poets have left themselves the choice of context and meaning by creating models which are not related to Jewish sources and which do not automatically bring to mind the particular didactic or moral context of a Judaic original.
