<plain_text><page sequence="1">PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR By A. Capell Introduction ^COMPARATIVELY little has appeared in English concerning the island of V^ Timor. Having recently had an opportunity of doing some linguistic research amongst natives of Portuguese Timor, which is even less adequately known than the Dutch portion of the island, it was thought advisable that the results of these studies should be set down in print, together with a summary of such other information as would be of interest to Australian students both of anthropology and linguistics, but which was not available to them in English. The island of Timor lies some 450 miles north-west of Darwin. It is about 300 miles long and an average of 60 miles wide. It is divided between Holland and Portugal, the Portuguese governing an area of some 7,450 sq. m. and the Dutch some 5,000 sq. m. The Portuguese area includes the enclave of Oe Kusi, on the north coast in the midst of the Dutch area. This enclave has an interesting history, being actually the first European settlement. Timor is of interest in numerous ways to the Australian student. It is far from impossible that the island may have served as a stepping stone for some, at least, of the aborigines of Australia in their movements into this continent. Not only theory, but actual observation suggests this. Physically, also, there is connection between the two. The fauna and flora are transitional types. Whilst the northern coastal area is typically Indonesian and tropical, the central mountain area and the southern coast produce the eucalyptus tree, and the landscapes are often very suggestive of the Australian. Those who have read A. R. Wallace's Malay Archipelago will recall his chapter on this subject, when he points out in addition to the above facts that monkeys cease at Timor, and many birds closely related to Australian species make their first appearance there. This study falls into two halves - the first is concerned with the people of the island, and rests upon reading in Dutch and Portuguese ; the second is a preliminary classification of the languages of both regions, and rests upon studies carried out personally as far as the Portuguese section is concerned, and culled from Dutch works. The printed sources are listed in a bibliography at the end of this paper. Part I The immediate source of this part of the paper is a book published in July 1943 in Portugal, and kindly brought to my notice by Senhor A. B. Labarinho, Consul for Portugal in Sydney. It is entitled Timor : Quarto Séculos de Colonizado Portuguesa,</page><page sequence="2">192 PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR O s I- I H s r5-^ il Vf VI li à ■- i r5-^ VI li ■- i *••</page><page sequence="3">PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR 193 by Captain José S. Martinho, and published by the Livraria Progredior at Oporto. Captain Martinho lived for many years in Timor, and is acknowledged to be well qualified to write about the island. His book is divided into three parts. Part 1 begins with a chapter headed with the intriguing title, " Timor Before its Discovery," and covers the early history of the island until the foundation of Dilli in 1769. Part 2 continues the history of the Portuguese part of the island to the present day. Part 3 contains a study of the anthropology of Portuguese Timor, including a sketch of the grammar of Tetum, the principal native language. This section contains about 160 pages, and has much of interest, which will here be summarized. The island of Timor was discovered between 1511 and 1515 by Antonio de Abreu " sent by Alfonso de Albuquerque, after the conquest of Malacca, in search of the Moluccas/' Martinho believes that at the date of its discovery by Europeans Timor was under the domination of Celebean rulers. The first settlement by the Portuguese was made in the Oe Kusi region, and the first capital was Lifau, in that area, until the foundation of Dilli in 1769. Thus what is now a small Portuguese enclave in Dutch territory was the first Portuguese colony in the island, long before any expansion of the colony in the direction of its present headquarters was con- templated. These colonists came immediately from the island of Solor, somewhat farther west. The actual foundation was made by a merchant named Costa, who called to his aid a Dutch deserter named Hornay. These two founded the kingdom of Oe Kusi between them. Hornay married a native, and his descendants for a long time held control of the island. Timor was nominally under the Governor of Góa, in Portuguese India, but the Hornay family was able to defy successfully control from outside. The original Hornay landed in 1613. The Dutch came into the island trade competition during the seventeenth century, and the struggle between the two powers soon began. In 1701 a new Governor, Antonio Coelho Guerreiro, landed at Lifau ; the da Costa of the day laid siege to him with Dutch help and almost rendered his position untenable. Such was the state of affairs in the island for many years. During the eighteenth century the power of the Costa-Hornay family waned, and finally governors appointed by the Portuguese Government itself were able to make good their authority. Subsequent struggles with the Dutch, told with spirit and in some detail by Capt. Martinho, forced the Portuguese to abandon Lifau and found Dilli in 1769. Subsequent treaties with Holland, and the general decline of Portuguese power, have brought about the present division of the island, about which Martinho has some very fiery words to say. The pacification of the island has proceeded slowly and not without many military campaigns, the latest of which (1911-12) finally established law and order in the Portuguese section of the island. This was until 1896 part of Macao, then autonomous under a governor at Dilli. Missionary work began very early, even before actual colonization, when Brother Antonio Taveira came from Solor to Timor in 1556 or 1557. This work is still being continued by missionaries of the Roman Catholic Church, but there are still many parts of the island which are not Christian.</page><page sequence="4">194 PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR The Population. Martinho does not give a total for the population of the Portuguese section of the island, but only rough numbers of speakers of certain dialects. Adding these up, and allowing for some tribes not listed in his figures, as well as proportionately for the Dutch area, the total population of Dutch Timor is 360,000 and of Portuguese Timor 412,000. The population falls into two main groups, but there are many mixed types. There is an apparently aboriginal substratum, commoner in some areas than in others, and an obviously intrusive Indonesian element. As will appear from Part II of this paper, this double composition is reflected in the languages of the island. The non-Indonesian portion of the population is found chiefly in the mountainous interior of the Portuguese section, and the non-Indonesian languages of which an account will be given in Part II include the Dagada, Makasai, Kairui and Bunak. At the same time, however, the Indonesian element in such languages as Tetum, Tukudede and Galoli is comparatively small, and these languages belong to the " eastern " section of the Indonesian group which is practically Melanesian in structure. It will be remembered that it was from eastern Indonesia that Friederici drew the Melanesians, though his final theory has not justified itself to students of linguistics. The extraordinary numbers of physical types to be found in Portuguese Timor have been remarked on by everybody who has written about the island, including the latest, Captain Martinho. It is the first feature that strikes the visitor to the Refugee Camp where the linguistic part of the present studies was carried out by the writer. The Portuguese have no colour bar, and the half-caste is not frowned upon. The Hornay and da Costa families who made the early history of the island were all of mixed blood, as has been mentioned. Amongst the women and children in the camp almost every possible type of hair and skin was found - even African, for negroes have been brought across from the Portuguese colonies in Africa. It is almost impossible to state what is the real Timorese physical type, although apart from the works of the Dutch students Ten Kate and Bijlmer, no physical anthropology has yet been done amongst these peoples, and we have to be content with general- izations based on simple observation. Martinho mentions a group of 35 skulls from Timor deposited in the University Museum at Coimbra in 1882, but only to show that figures based on them are hopelessly unreliable, because their place of origin is quite uncertain and may not even be Timor at all ! At the same time, there does seem to be a definitely Timorese type, if, as it seems logical to suppose, the present mountain tribes, speaking non-Indonesian languages, represent the earlier population of the island. A few summary notes from Bijlmer will be useful here. The mean height of these people agrees fairly closely with those of Flores and Sumba, viz. about 160 cm. On p. 91 Bijlmer says : " The Timorese differ quite distinctly from the Sumbanese. Their darker colour and the frequent occurrence of crisp hair entirely transfer them</page><page sequence="5">PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR 195 to the Melanesian side. If one wanted to distinguish in the Dutch East Indies only Malays and Papuans or Indonesians and Melanesians, one would have to place the boundary between these two races undoubtedly between Sumba and Timor and the latter would then fall on the Melanesian side. The appearance of the Belunese (the eastern part of Dutch Timor) is indisputably affected by their narrow-headedness, which strikes the eye all the more on account of their long face, by which their facial index seems to surpass even that of the Sumbanese. In that narrow face there is however a much broader nose." There is a long series of plates with descriptive notes in Bijlmer's book, showing the various types. About the western Timorese, whom he ca*s the Atoni, which is the word for " man " in most dialects of Dutch Timor, he says : " This people is still more difficult to recognize than the former, probably because the narrow- headedness as a distinguishing mark is lacking." Again, " In Timor and Flores there is a strong admixture of spiral-hairiness, and Mongoloid marks are by no means lacking. And that is what places them on the level of Melanesians ... In Timor and Flores one feels that one is absolutely no longer among Malays . . . After eastern Flores the Atoni of west Timor are most Melanesian." Illustrations in both Martinho and Bijlmer suggest a possible Australoid type amongst them, and some of those seen by the present writer in the refugee camp bear out the impression. Indeed Bijlmer himself says : " It is further not impossible that Australian influences have been active in Timor. Plate IV on p. 22 is very remarkable indeed and does not give an exceptional type." It is worth noting that Ten Kate found the longest skulls in Belu (central Timor), the shortest in eastern Flores and the narrowest in eastern middle Flores. He thinks possible a settling of Butonese (south-eastern Celebes) at Adonare (Solor I.) and of Ceramese at Beloe, and adds, as quoted by Bijlmer : " Although these people do not actually contain other race elements than those considered by us, this (settlement from Ceram) might be of importance with a view to the amount of Malay blood found in those districts." There is also the tradition mentioned by Martinho that Timor was under Celebean domination at the end of the fifteenth century. Bijlmer, from whom most of this summary is taken, adds : " As regards Timor my results satisfactorily connect with those of Ten Kate. I am further of the opinion that for the eastern part of Flores, apart from the extreme east, the pronounced dolichocephaly with highly negroid appearance has been proved." Keane, in Man, Past and Present, distinguishes in Indonesia (a) Indonesians, the pre-Malay long-headed element in Oceania, and (b) proto-Malayan or Malayan broadheads, the collective name for all the Oceania Mongols, and (c) Malay, as a branch of (b). The Indonesian element in Timor belongs thus to (a), the earlier type of Indonesian. Linguistically, however, the matter is not simple. The non-Indonesian languages do not bear any Australian affinities, but belong to that group which is vaguely called " Papuan." They are marked by certain characteristics which will be detailed in Part II, and they have correlatives farther east in the still imperfectly known languages of the Tanimbar group. The only other recorded non-Indonesian languages</page><page sequence="6">196 PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR in this part of Indonesia are those of northern Halmahera, but to this group the languages of Timor do not seem to bear any relation, either in vocabulary (as they do bear to the Tanimbar languages) or in structure, beyond the characteristics common to so many other " Papuan " languages, such as the use of postpositions instead of prepositions, and the placing of the object before the verb. The Indonesian part of the Timor population is no easier to define. Many of the women seen in the camp are tall and thin, with straight black hair and typical Malay features. They do not recall the shorter Javanese type in any way. At the same time there is so much mixture from other sources that it is almost a hopeless waste of time to attempt any segregation of types in the group. Even Chinese blood is not absent, and Eurasians from the other Portuguese colony of Macao are present. The Indonesian languages also seem to show more than one stratum of population, and suggest that influxes took place at different periods and in different regions. Political System, One of the marks of race-mixture is seen in the political system of the island, which is not simply that of so many primitive peoples in Oceania, but is marked by well-defined classes - less defined under European government than before, but still present. Martinho states that in Portuguese territory at least, Timor society is divided into five classes : leo-rai, the greater chiefs or kings ; dato, the lesser chiefs or nobles ; ema-reino, commoners, free, but not of noble blood ; ata, slaves ; and lutun, cattle keepers. The term lutun- di Tukudede term, for which the Tetum is luhan - " comes from the function they exercise, rather than from the culture of the land, viz. the keeping of the cattle belonging to the dato, chiefly buffaloes, whose corral or enclosure was called lutun in Tukudede, to which corresponds the term luhan in Tetum. Even to-day, when the long period of domination by the dato has passed, in regions where their influence was great, people are recruited by zones, by a sort of rural police, to look after the places where the cattle are pastured and fruits collected, places called cabo-leva." The old lutun has passed away, and seems to have been commonest in Tukudede-speaking country. The ata were slaves, and might be gained either by capture in war or by purchase, but the slavery was light and slaves were well treated. It was possible for them to marry into their masters1 families and to be accepted into the master's tribe, and this is another cause contributing to the race-confusion so marked throughout the island. The prices of slaves naturally varied ; " the head had special value, and when the combined price was paid in jewels, there corresponded with it a mutisala (coral collar). The value of each member depended on sex and age." Martinho in a foot- note adds that very few years ago an old native woman, a prisoner of war, was sold at Oe Kusi for a pig. The term ema-reino is applied to commoners who are not slaves. Ema is the common term for man in Portuguese Timor (atoni in Dutch Timor), while reino is the</page><page sequence="7">PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR 197 Portuguese for kingdom. The combination, as Martinho remarks, is probably later than the European conquest, and one would presume that it was originally ema-rai, " person of the land/' corresponding to leo-rai, " ruler of the land," but there is no actual evidence of this. Martinho says that the ema-reino were " the people, with no special function of government, which belonged to the two upper classes, and ema-reino is the name by which to-day we know the people of Timor apart from the chiefs." The governing classes were the dato and leo-rai ; in Dutch Timor nai and usuf are given. The latter is the higher of the two, and roughly corresponds to " petty king " of one of the many districts into which Timor was-and still largely is- divided. There is considerable uncertainty about both the spelling and the meaning of the term, and various definitions and derivations have been proposed. Martinho decides finally on leo, " region, inhabited area," and rat, " earth," both Tetum terms. The name, however, is common amongst all tribes except the Bunak, where lamak takes its place. The whole situation suggests that the Tetum-speaking people have made their authority felt throughout the island, for place-names that can be interpreted through Tetum are found in all regions where the language itself is not spoken. The ancestors of the Tetum would seem to have been one of the invading peoples who were responsible for the introduction of Indonesian language and culture into Timor. The Bunak speak a non-Indonesian language, and their territory stretches over the Portuguese boundary into Dutch Timor. The leo-rai, says Martinho, "was the final authority in native social organization." He was the ruler of a kingdom composed of a number of suku. This is the Malay for " quarter " and suggests that the system was introduced by Indonesian invaders, and imposed upon a simpler native system, presumably a gerontocracy, for the term dato, applied to the lesser chiefs, rulers of a suku, is also a Malay term. Magalhàes in his Subsidios para o Estudo Etnológico de Timor, p. 57, as quoted by Martinho, says : " The districts are grouped into suku as in various parts of Sumatra, and the native states are governed by a liorai, which may be a corruption of the Javanese word lurah (district chief), but which is more probably a corruption of that of the noble title lar ah, of some native chiefs of Sumatra." Martinho disagrees with both derivations, preferring a native explanation, and one is inclined to agree with him, even while granting that the system of government by leo-rai is foreign. He adds, " The power of the leo-rai was absolute, and was exercised by the instrumentality of the dato and their inferiors, close to the people." The leo-rai was the fount and source of law. Within his own household he administered it through the agency of a confidant, called durbasa, who in course of time became a sort of vizier whose favour, says Martinho, " litigants sought to gain by oiling his hands " ! The Portuguese took over the durbasa with the meaning of interpreter, and nowadays the term is applied to the interpreter of a secretary of the administration. The leo-rai was not bound by the law, which for others was constituted by use and custom. He could change or suspend it, and his decrees were absolute.</page><page sequence="8">198 PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR According to H. O. Forbes, Wanderings of a Naturalist in the Eastern Archipelago, about 1880, there were 47 leo-rai in Portuguese Timor. Each reino, he says, is divided into districts called suku, ruled by dato who receive their orders from the leo-rai. Under the dato are officers called kabo and tenente - these, obviously from the titles, being Portuguese creations. At the present time the dato, as I gathered from conversation in a refugee camp, is rather an exalted personage with whom the average commoner has little to do. This is obviously the result of the political eclipse of the leo-rai, and to this a great revolt against the Portuguese in 1911-12 largely contributed. After putting down that revolt, the Portuguese abolished for the most part these petty kings and divided their authority among the dato ruling different suku. Where the leo-rai is still found, he almost always represents a broken succession, the present ruler being elected from leaders of groups who were faithful to Portugal during the revolt, and not necessarily related in any way to the old rulers. The dato were thus minor chiefs, rulers of suku, and of foreign origin at first as individuals and always as an institution. Originally, no doubt, they were relatives of the leo-rai and received their suku as fiefs given in reward for services rendered. " But what leads us to conclude," says our author, " that the dato were, among the people of Timor, an aristocracy that fixed itself there, and that certainly through invasion, is the fact that only later the term dato has spread into other parts of the island, there being to-day some where the chiefs were never previously known by this aristocratic term, until the time that Coelho Guerreiro (1701) distinguished them with military rank." The term dato is also a common element in personal names, but chiefly within the Tukudede linguistic area, which would seem to have been the first area in which dato became an institution. The Village. There is no satisfactory term in Timor languages for " village," and illustrations as well as the letterpress in Forbes' book show that there are in reality no villages, but only hamlets - clusters of a few houses within an enclosure. See for instance the illustration on page 430 in Forbes. Martinho believes that the pre-Indonesian inhabitants were nomads. In Tetum knua and in western Timor kuan seems to be the only word for " village," and that refers only to a group of huts, with no reference to a surrounding territory. Bickmore saw a similar arrangement in Semau Island, off the western end of Timor. The territory is known as leo, combined in leo-rai as the name of the highest authority. The village is not built on any regular plan. " The leo-rai 's residence is situated on the best land, near to or far from the dwellings of his subjects. It and they are placed inside a palisade." (Martinho.) This palisade is distinct from the kota, a stone fortress, whose Malay name bespeaks its origin. The knua was normally located on a rocky height, like the Fijian koro to which it corresponds, for purposes of defence. There was apparently always a good deal of internecine warfare, and</page><page sequence="9">PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR 199 the island was divided even of old into two great sections, a western, called by Martinho Serviao, and an eastern, called Belu. In the villages the dead were buried " not far from their residences," and some- times within the actual dwelling. In the centre of the village was " a common house, in whose construction everyone took a part . . . This was a council house, where the chiefs and the old men held deliberations and conversed at times of rest. This house is called urna bo, and its shape was generally round." Travellers rested in the urna bo, and ate there on festive occasions. Under the Portuguese it has become a local Parliament House. Fortresses of stone were also constructed for protection. One such, illustrated by Martinho, is shown decorated with human skulls - never of local people, but of enemies killed. Houses differ in type not so much among tribes as according to locality, whether coastal or mountain. The normal house is square, with a roof rising to a central point. It is built off the ground, and entered by steps (Tetum, oda) and a door (tnatan=eye), but usually called by the combined name oda matan. Inside, it is provided with a number of sleeping places called lantén. The roof is of palm-leaves, or other leaves according to the material available in the locality. The top of the roof is crowned by a large planed piece of wood, serving to keep out the rain, and decorated with varying designs of birds or fish, imitating the bulkhead of a pro (ship - Malay, prahu). This looks like a memory of past history, and an Indonesian trait, for the modern Timorese is not a great sailor. This designed top-piece is, moreover, limited to people of rank. In the mountain regions the house is less pretentious in size, and generally round in shape. This division of house-types recalls Fiji, where the prevailing design is rectangular, but the houses of the interior tribes of Viti Levu seem normally to have been round in olden days. Describing the island of Semau, off the western end of Timor, Bickmore says that the villages consisted of a few round huts, made of sticks about three feet high driven into the ground, and roofed with palm thatch. The circular house occurs in various parts of Dutch New Guinea, e.g. in the Timorini country, upper Mamberamo River, and east of Lake Wissel in the Nassau mountains. In Timor the mountain house also lacks a specially made floor, being built direct on the ground. " Under the eaves one or more lantén marks the place of sleeping during the night, unless that is round the fireplace where the whole family sleeps together without any barriers." Martinho sums up the appearance of the round house by saying, " the dwelling looks like a big tortoise with its feet hidden by the eaves." Some examples are found built on piles like the square houses - and this was Forbes' experience in the Bibisusu region - and in some parts entrance is gained by a movable ladder communicating with the interior, through the floor. The leo-rai's residence is distinguished in size only, and conforms to the general design. House-building begins with a ceremony in honour of the spirits. The good spirits are asked for protection and the bad are placated. Pieces of meat from small animals killed at the right moment are distributed to them by being thrown around in a circle about the spot. Before a new house is inhabited, more detailed ceremonies</page><page sequence="10">200 PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR are performed. Larger animals are killed, and " about the rai-lulik (clan priest) the whole family gathers, listening anxiously to the incantations intended to remove the evil spirits which can cause illness." It is the dogs and pigs which do most of the cleaning up about the house. Until recently the house hardly boasted of anything that might be called furniture, except amongst the higher classes. People slept on bili , palm-leaf mats. Pots of earthen- ware (sana) or iron (sana best) serve for preparing food. Wooden plates or dishes (bikan) were in use. Spoons were known as kanuru or nguru in the coastal areas, but the commonest types were of shell or coconut, often very interesting. There was also a large spoon, kanuru suru, "for serving," a piece of coconut-husk, strengthened with the midrib of a palapa leaf and fastened with bamboo. The use of utensils for special ceremonies is dying out, but " in the urna lulik (temples) there are still preserved very old china pots, notable amongst them those of the old house of Camanassa, which are only used at the great ceremonies." These and some similar vessels were used by the dato lulik (sacred chief) to receive the blood of victims when special offerings were made " on the occasions on which some event of special importance in the life of the people was intended or hoped for." For carrying liquids, lengths of bamboo were used, in many parts known as kniku. A still longer piece (be: doran) was used for carrying large quantities of water. Family Life. Martinho has a very interesting chapter on family life and relationships. There are, as elsewhere, rules to be observed by pregnant women. The child when born is washed in warm water, and then wrapped in a cotton mantle, and the grand- parents take care of it. The first ceremony observed for the child is the " descent from the lantén, which gives the newly-born security of the outside against the evil spirits." Feeding is not carried out on any regular plan ; the child at its will tries foods of all sorts, and stomach disorders quickly make their appearance. Infant mortality in native life is high. The naming does not seem to be attended by special ceremonies, or to depend on special people, though Martinho is a little vague on the point. He writes : " The father or mother - in the districts I know - may have some chosen name, and it is this that the child receives, whatever the name may be, perhaps Fahi Te:n (pig's excrement) or Loro ana (young sun). If the child cries much, or is difficult in sundry other ways, the name may be changed. Serious and prolonged illness in later years may also lead to change of name and even of residence or actually of village. It is a matter of contacts with the spirit world. A change of name may serve to confuse ill-disposed spirits. Circumcision is practised on children from 8 to 12 years, but only in the coastal regions, and is plainly an introduced thing. Martinho himself believes that it is due to Muhammedan influence, but this does not necessarily follow. It may equally well be something that has come in with the Indonesian invading peoples.</page><page sequence="11">PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR 201 The child's education proceeds as in most primitive communities, by imitation. Gaming is in the native blood, especially cock-fighting (Tetum, futu ma:nu). Card- playing (djuga sur at, the former word being Portuguese, the latter Malay) comes next in favour, but as its name shows is a fairly late introduction. Another favourite game is bidu doit (bidu- dance, doit= copper coin - a Dutch word), especially with boys. There is also kaleik, played by boys of school age with a fruit of the same name, which is fired from between thumb and forefinger at the opponent's fruit similarly fired. Martinho lists and briefly describes some other games as well. Marriage is arranged by the fathers or closest relatives of the young people. A contract is arranged and payments decided upon after discussion. The young man may then frequent the house of his future parents-in-law, and even sleep with the girl. Before the marriage is finally realized, the youth's parents visit the girl's parents, and hand over the first payments in ordinary money. This is called in Tetum osan naran, " name money." The visit is returned later. The girl's parents receive buffaloes, horses, jewels and money and give back clothing and pigs to the value of a third of what was received by them. The difference represents the actual value of the bride. The conclusion of this process may be marked by a feast, at which relatives and other guests are present, but " even to-day," says Martinho, " the union of husband and wife takes place without ceremonial." The bride-price is not always paid in a lump sum. It may take years, and meanwhile the man is largely at the beck and call of his parents-in-law. Marriage is usually patrilocal, but in case of ill-treatment or quarrel the bride may run back to her parents' house and take the children with her. The parents may stir her up to take such action. In case of divorce, the children accompany the mother - one or all, according to the state of the marriage payments. These payments are known as belts1 in Dutch territory ; no name is recorded in Tetum, but the term barlak (barlaque) is used in the local Portuguese of Timor to describe them. Unfortunately Martinho does not give any indication as to whether there are clan organizations of any sort ; de Castro states that marriage is neither particularly endogamous nor exogamous, whatever that may be taken to mean, but there are certain definite groupings of villages for intermarriage in the region visited by Forbes. These will be mentioned below.2 The levirate is practised. " The woman may not want to marry or have the husband's brother to whom she falls, but not even so may she leave the parents- in-law's house." There are naturally wide departures from all this nowadays under Portuguese government and with the introduction of Christianity, but these were the usages general among the non-Christian tribes. 1 The word belts is not Timorese, but western Indonesian. For Dutch Timor Middelkoop gives (1) puah tnanus luman, " empty betel and betel-pepper/' and (2) puah manus mnasi, " old betel and betel-pepper/' in Molo, Fatu Le'u and Amfoan, with different terms in Amanuban. There are different usages associated with each name. 2 Middelkoop states that for his area the villages are exogamous, but does not mention any special relations between particular villages.</page><page sequence="12">202 PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR For Dutch Timor fuller information on marriage is given by Middelkoop. He lists the following types of marriage : (1) Request (in his Dutch, Aanzoek, though he admits he is making a special use of the word). The young man chooses his own mate, who seeks the sanction of her elders, who accept the youth's gifts if they agree with the marriage. There are variations on this theme in different districts. (2) Choice is made by the elders themselves on basis of marriage between cross-cousins of either type. It is here that village exogamy is mentioned by Middelkoop. Marriage of girls of 13-14 years with men of 40 is found. (3) Marriage by theft or elopement, in two varieties, (a) the youth arranges with the girl to accept him and with his own villagers to come to an appointed spot and take her. The girl leaves a recognized sign at home but her new village is only later revealed, (b) Pretended theft - the girl is taken from her own home but with the parents' foreknowledge and acquiescence. The former variety has a sub-variety in which the villagers come with the youth and take the girl secretly from her own home at night. Middelkoop also mentions two special and more limited varieties of marriage. The young people sometimes meet in the bush by arrangement : a fine is payable by the youth's parents or he serves in the girl's house. At Annas, in the Belu district - i.e. close to Portuguese Timor - a quite different method is found : The man brings in practically nothing, trusts the wife and takes a very subordinate position. He cannot take her away to his own village ; if children are born one only is sent to the man's parents. Middelkoop thinks this points to an invasion, for " the man always comes alone." The marriage here is matrilocal, but the children bear the father's name until they are introduced to the family magic, after which they bear the mother's family name. If a wife dies first, husband and children remain in her house. If the husband dies first, widow and children go to husband's family home " to make fire." If there are no children, then after the husband's death the widow shares the goods. If she refuses to do this sharing, she must present the man's family with one of her younger sisters as a hakef or slave. He also notes that parents tend to demand for a daughter the same bride-price that was given for her mother. This is one of a number of points in which Timor custom strikingly resembles that of Borneo. I have no full lists of relationship terms in any of the languages, but the following Tetum list supplies most of the terms : AMA-N .. .. Father; ama kwaik, father's elder brother; ama klaran, father's middle brother ; ama ikun, father's younger brother (lit. father's tail) ; ama usuk, grandfather ; ama hawat, foster father. ina-n . . . .

The only definite conclusions from these lists is the stress laid on age-relationships within the family, and the fact that the type marriage is with the mother's brother's daughter or father's sister's daughter. The terms themselves are chiefly Indonesian in origin, but more than one stream of Indonesian influence is indicated, e.g. western Timor MONE, husband, is a common Indonesian term for " male," but in Tetum is replaced by LA* IN, a word commonest in the Philippine group of Indonesian languages. The frequent ending in -/ in the western dialect is a mark of that dialect, along with Vaikenu and Roti, and will be discussed in Part II, " Linguistics," of this paper. The vocabulary in Part II will also supply some of the relationship terms in the other dialects. It is interesting to notice that even in the non-Indonesian languages most of the relationship terms are Indonesian, and not always the same as in Tetum</page><page sequence="14">204 PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR or the west. Thus "elder brother" is in Mambai KARA, the same in Makasai, and KA: in Bunak. It is Malay KAKAK, elder brother or sister, Tagalog KARA, even though Makasai and Bunak are not Indonesian languages. In some languages the exchange of terms for brother and sister is wider than in Tetum. Thus Makasai : RARA, elder brother ; kaka tufurai, elder sister. N0R0, younger brother ; noko tufurai, younger sister. In Waimaha, however, elder sister is wa'in, while younger brother is WARI, and younger sister is war i ano ata, a female WARI, but elder brother is BO'U. The Bunak dialect makes no exchange of terms at all : each has a different name : RA:, elder brother; ALI, younger brother, but nan, elder sister and kau fanan, younger sister. In Kupang and Vaikenu, the distinction of age is either not made or only incompletely made : Kupang, ABTABLANE, brother, and bata biha:ta, sister; Vaikenu, TATAF, elder brother and OLIF, younger brother, but olif Ufé, " female brother," i.e. sister. Monogamy is the normal practice, but a second wife is allowed under definite circumstances, such as the sterility of the first wife. Marriage payments have to be made in this case as in the first, and this fact often proves a hindrance. To-day, Martinho says, natives may pay for second or third wives, even when they have children by the first. In Oe Kusi and Noi Mutin monogamy remains the rule to this day. Martinho thinks he sees in these regions vestiges of matriarchy, but gives no reasons to support his statement. There is in these two regions no bride-price, but the youth goes into the parents-in-law's family for a time and practically earns his bride. Martinho states that he was told in Oe Kusi that monogamy had been intro- duced by " the first colonists who came from Malacca," and he is inclined to believe that this is right, as these people were already Christians when they came into Timor. He has nothing to say about tribal or clan organizations, but some very curious facts are given by Forbes for the country round about Bibisusu (in Martinho's map spelled Bubu-Susun) in the southern Tetum country, where most of his research was carried out. He says that a man of Saluki may marry a woman of Bidauk if he pays the bride-price, but cannot remain in Bidauk. A man of Bidauk may marry a woman of Saluki, and lives in the house of the bride's family, making no payment. Children belong to the woman, and inherit from her at her death, while the husband returns to his own district and cannot take any of the children unless there are more than two, in which case he may have at any rate one. This seems to be the remains of matriarchy to which Martinho refers. Men of Manufahi cannot get wives from Bibisusu, but men of Bibisusu can obtain wives from Manufahi. " The women of Bibisusu," says Forbes, " can obtain husbands from Manufahi if these men go and live during the lifetime of their wives in the kingdom of their wives. No purchase money may be paid and none may be accepted from them." He adds that the husband-giving clan is called vasau mane, and the wife-supplying clan feto sau.</page><page sequence="15">PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR 205 He does not give further details of local marriage arrangements, nor state whether there were regular wife exchange areas throughout the country. I have not been able to identify the term vasau mane (which occurs, with the relevant information, also in de Castro's notes), but feto-sawa, the correct form for feto sau, is a term of interest, showing the grafting of Indonesian terms on to a non- Indonesian language. Feto is a local word for " female " in Tetum, and does not seem to be Indonesian ; but sawa is an Original Indonesian word signifying " spouse." Another ground for divorce is adultery, but only if the woman commits it. In the regions where no bride-price is paid, this cause of divorce raises more difficulties than in the other parts of the island. In some cases custom allows the offender to be driven out of her paternal home, " despoiled of everything, including the articles of clothing that covered her." If the wife of the leo-rai committed adultery, her seducer might pay for the offence with his life. Child-bearing is regarded as the true purpose of marriage, but abortion occurs. Martinho says : " More than this, I will not say of unwedded women. Amongst these, abortion is a current practice, but they do it with certain precautions, though without scandal, using violent abortives either external or internal." It is permitted at times to an unmarried girl who has been seduced and is unwilling to bear her first child thus. Application can be made to authorities - the leo-rai or lesser chief - for leave, and our author says that this custom comes down from ancient times. Simple defloration was punishable by a fine, whose " price corresponds to that of the marriage- price, but its value diners from region to region." About Maubara, in Tukudede-speaking country, there is difference of practice. There " abortion, for girls who want to have lovers without being compromised, comes in to make its victims." In that area the bride-price is paid when the girl becomes pregnant. A small piece of cord with a knot tied in the middle is used as a symbol of mutual trust, and the lover swears faithfulness upon that, the knot symbolizing the union. The girl retains the cord, and it serves to guarantee the lover that he is really the father of the child that is conceived. If after a reasonable period no child is forthcoming, the two agree to cut the cord through the knot, and mutual obligation ceases. Each is then free to choose afresh. Prostitution is found, but chiefly in areas where Europeans or Arabs or Chinese are living. However, in some of the mountain areas, " among a population without half-castes, there are, as in the other centres, temporary unions, paid for perhaps with a coconut, a handful of tobacco, some game or a small sum of money." In parts of the island - Suai, Mau-katar, etc. - such women are looked down upon. The name " state women " is applied to them. Magic. Two persons of considerable importance in Timorese life were the matan do:k (Tetum, " far seer ") or mnani (Western dialect), the doctor, and the buan or suatji, the sorcerer. The matan do:k saw the future, solved mysteries and discovered criminals. He was called in when crime had to be judged. The criminal swore by</page><page sequence="16">2o6 PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR various oaths, e.g. by the earth, of which he would take a mouthful and chew it, or by the evil spirits, inviting them to come and eat his soul, if he were not telling the truth. The matan do:k would be called on to ratify such oaths. He was actually the healer of disease. He did not wear any special clothing, but used roots, grasses and leaves of plants. Martinho calls the matan do:k " sl clever charlatan, who managed to eat, drink and dress at the cost of the simple, and even gather enough for his old age. He describes rather derisively the methods employed in the doctor's practice. " The matan do:k never cured. Has someone a pain in the side ? Let all retire ; he would find out the cause of the evil. The patient was then submitted to a gentle massage, accompanied by muttered words. At a certain point, the practitioner gave an ah ! of surprise and satisfaction. From the side he had drawn out a fragment of iron or glass that the evil spirits or the suarji had put into the victim's body while he slept." This is the ordinary method of the shaman, and it is described also in Wilkens, Het Shamanisme bij de Volken van den Indischen Archipel ('s Gravenshage, 1887) as such. At the same time, the matan do:k never took such an office upon himself, it was a vocation from the spirit world and entered upon in a definite ceremonial manner. De Castro says : " A man goes to sleep one night knowing that his kohe (duly bag) is empty. On waking next day, he finds unexpectedly in his kohe, it may be, a small white stone which is lulik. He has received the lot, and he is a matan do:k. He now enters upon his profession. On going to consult about sickness in a house, he begins by dancing to the sound of his lakadou, until he becomes excited and exclaims that he is possessed by a malus-tan (prophetic spirit)." [Flores de Coral, p. 165.) The matan do:k also carried out ceremonies for the restoration of crops in gardens when disease appeared among them. Taking a few turns about the garden, he would then squat down in his chosen spot and dig in the earth, finally producing a piece of iron which he would throw to the owner of the garden as the cause of the evil. Martinho states that the Portuguese Government has put down the practice of the matan do:k, but it may be that as in Fiji such people still practice surreptitiously. The other important person in magic in Timor is the buan or suarji. Buan is the Tetum term for sorcerer, and suarji the western term, but it is also known widely throughout the island, and is the term generally used both by Martinho and de Castro. The matan do:k and the suarji were sworn enemies. The evil eye was one of the powers attributed to the latter, and in case of fatal illness the matan do:k would urge the existence of a secret enemy, a suarji, and would proceed to identify him, especially if the deceased were a person of rank or influence. The accused might be some poor inoffensive person, or someone the matan do:k hated, and on whom he might take vengeance without fear of retribution. The whole family of the suarji was classed with him, women and children included, and on such occasions all were savagely put to death, generally by impaling or burying alive, according to Forbes. The only means of salvation was to flee to another kingdom and live there under an assumed name. De Castro says that persons who were suarji feared the presence of the matan do:k. The suarji appeared in dreams to his victim and could be recog-</page><page sequence="17">PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR 207 nized by him, and hence if he lived long enough he could accuse him to the people at large. Suayi hang like bats to the lower branches of trees, it was said, looking for the klamar (Tetum, soul of the living) to steal. One of the practices of the suayi was to bury " medicine " under the threshold of a house and then go away, leaving it to do its work on those who passed over the threshold. This again strongly recalls the actions of the vakandrau-ni-kau in Fiji. It will be mentioned later than the suayi could take on animal form and behave as a werewolf. In religion the people of Timor are animists, except for a few Muhammedans about Kupang, and converts of recent centuries to Christianity. I find no mention in Martinho's book of the concept of soul-substance, so very common in Indonesia, including the non-Indonesian natives of Halmahera. The word common for it in eastern Indonesia, samayat, is found in Kupang and Dutch Timor generally, and also in Mambai. It is possible that klatnan, the Tetum word for " soul " is a corruption of it, and Tukudede maga is most probably so. The Dutch writers give numerous examples of ideas prevalent in Dutch Timor that presuppose the concept of soul- substance. Thus, lovers pull out seven hairs from their heads and exchange them, keeping them wound round a small piece of wood. If they neglect to rub them each week with oil, the person from whom they came gets headache. In case of breach of compact, then the hair can be used by its possessor to work magic on the person it is taken from. It was also a custom after a death for the whole family to cut their hair short, and after the death of a sovereign, all the men in the district had to do the same. The soul-stuff is here, as elsewhere in Indonesia, conceived as resident partly in the hair. The custom of making blood-brothers by drinking each other's blood is also found, and points to a similar concept, the soul substance being found in the blood. In the centre of the Dutch area, it is recorded by Grijzen that people believe a person has seven souls. If one of them leaves a man, he falls sick ; if all leave him, he dies. Four of these souls are said to be good and three bad. The former go to the sky-world, the latter remain on earth and become evil spirits. If they enter the spirit-world, they change into animals. There is a similar belief in the soul-stuff of plants. A native who plucks a plant as medicine keeps it, every now and then sprinkling on it grains of rice to keep strength in the soul-substance of the plant. Similarly at Kupang, a woman winding yarn will place rice and corn on the loom, so as not to become sick or lazy. In weaving it, she will " feed " it with rice so that it may not " run away " and the weaving be a failure. In Dutch Timor the spirits of the dead are called nitu. There is no mention of this word in Martinho, nor even in Mathij sen's Tetoemsch-Hollandsch Woordenboek, so that it evidently does not extend into the centre or east of the island. The term sdmayat already mentioned is applied in varied forms in different Indonesian languages to the soul-stuff, the spirit of the living person. At death, however, the term ceases</page><page sequence="18">2o8 PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR to be applicable, and the spirit of the dead is nitu or sanitu. This is the case, for instance, in Mentaway in the far west of the archipelago. The word nitu is reckoned by Dempwolff as Original Indonesian, and is common in the Philippines, Molucca, Rotti, and western Timor, in Celebes (Toradja), in various parts of north-eastern New Guinea, and in a disguised form (aitu) in Polynesia also. Mention will be made of the nitu beliefs in Dutch Timor later in this paper, especially in connection with the voho matan, the fetish-stones. The chief care of the bereaved family is to keep the nitu away : they will sometimes put a little basket of ashes at the foot of the grave, or in the part of the house where the coffin lay. Then in the morning they can tell by footprints whether the nitu has been about during the night or not. Life is ruled by the spirit world, which can make or mar it. All the activities of life are begun with reference to the spirits - beginning a garden, the native offers a little chicken-flesh to the spirits that may exist in the shelter of the trees he is about to cut down. " He does not cut down a tree in the forest, without lifting up his thoughts to the Beyond, seeking the protection of the good spirits ; and he does not go to war without submitting to the ceremonies of the dato lulik (sacred chief) that will make him secure from his fate.'' Even bandits out for plunder will first consult the spirits as to whether the night's work is likely to be satisfactory ! The spirits of whom he takes such care are those of his own forebears. Those who have not received due burial honours become evil spirits, waiting for opportunities to wreak vengeance in sickness or other punishments. Objects belonging to the dead are respected, especially if their owners have been people of rank. They are kept in the urna lulik (sacred house), cared for by the priest, the rai lulik. All sorts of objects are kept in these sacred houses - old war and festival drums, wooden swords, insignia of old leo-rai's, old uniforms and fire-arms, spears, jewels, clothes and pots, buffalo heads and horns. Of course not all these objects are parts of native culture, and Martinho does not fail to point this out, adding that these relics of Europeans betrayed in some revolt or killed in battle, are kept there with religious respect as great as that accorded to relics of the natives' own ancestors, " because these, too, represent pages of their history." The best account of the urna lulik is that given by Forbes {op. cit., p. 443). He states that there might be one for a family cluster of houses (knua)t and near the residence of the leo-rai a much larger one which was a sort of religious centre for the whole reino. There was a cleared space surrounded by a thick fence, the whole within a grove of trees, and standing on some high place. No twig or branch might be cut or broken within the enclosure, and no tobacco, horses or buffalo were allowed in it. The building itself was of bamboo, erected on piles, and possessed two doors, one in one side and the other at one end. Buffalo skulls decorated the outside of the building. The priest was called dato lulik or rai lulik. An old man or an old woman lived in the enclosure, and was called ata lulik (sacred slave), or there might be an elderly couple as caretakers, but in this case they had to leave the enclosure at night, as the two sexes might not sleep together within it. Of the two doors, one served for the dato lulik and the other for people who came to consult him. The priest's</page><page sequence="19">PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR 209 part was railed off by ornamented wooden pillars from the public part of the temple. Sacred objects (which will be mentioned below) were kept in the priest's part of the building. The dato lulik had special vestments in which to officiate : a broad band of scarlet cloth for the forehead, a circular breastplate of gold hung round his shoulders, two golden ear discs, and a gold crown with horns like those of buffaloes. In the temple was an altar (vatu lulik , or sacred stone) on which offerings were laid (though apparently not burned : part of a fowl, etc., would be laid there and the remainder cooked and eaten in common by priest and enquirer). The stones of the altar were said to have been given to the people of Timor when the world was first made. Some houses possessed private sanctuaries where offerings could be made by the householder for minor purposes. Further notes on the fetish-nature of certain stones is supplied from the Dutch side by Grijzen, who speaks of voho matan, " the eye of the offering-place/' and such stones are usually round, cylindrical or egg-shaped. Occasionally they resemble a man or an animal. A person may find such a stone, and then dream that the stone is his friend. That means that a spirit dwells in the stone, and this spirit has con- cluded a bond of friendship with him. The spirit or the stone then makes a test. If it asks for an animal, that means that it requires a human sacrifice. If the dreamer cannot supply it, he calls a sorcerer and breaks off the bond between them. If the spirit asks for betel, then he is satisfied with an animal sacrifice. Sometimes the dream precedes the finding of the stone. Sometimes such a stone is found in a person's betel-bag. An offering must first be made to the stone, and then it must be set in a specified place. A pile of stones, the voho, is erected, and the fetish placed on top of it. In the case of a small stone, it may be hidden under a pile of larger ones. The neighbourhood of such a stone is holy, and wood must not be cut near it. The voho matan looks after the welfare of the finder and his relations. If angered it may cause disaster to him and his. There are also " national " voho set up by the first founders of a kingdom. At offerings made to such a voho, members of the original family must be present to strew rice in front of it. In Belu, there is a stone placed in the middle of the rice-field, called taro uman, representing the soul of the rice. At sowing time a pig or a fowl is offered to it. The blood, eggs, etc., are offered to strengthen the soul-stuff of the stone. Similarly, too, the important sandalwood tree has a taro uman called ai húsar or navel of the wood. Offerings are made to it when sandalwood is cut. How far these beliefs and practices prevail also in Portuguese Timor is not stated. Further light on the use of the urna lulik in the Dutch area comes from a native teacher quoted by Kruijt (Het Animisme, p. 406), to the following effect : " In the idol-house there is set a cooking-pot, containing muti sala, gold and silver. In that house is also a basket hanging up, containing stones and roots and hen-eggs marked red and white, black and white, and there are also hung up two or three ancient swords and a gong. When war is undertaken, they take some rice and a fowl, a goat and a pig, the ears of which they cut off and bring into the house. The afore- mentioned objects are now addressed, and then the swords and the basket are taken cc</page><page sequence="20">2io PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR out and hung on a tree ; nobody is allowed to come near them or touch them, else sickness would result. Only the meo or warriors can take and sharpen the swords. When the fighters are ready to move, the gong is struck and a blast blown on a buffalo horn. They bind silver buffalo horns on their heads, and hang round their necks strings of muti sala, on which silver plates are fixed. Round their calves they fasten strings with long hair attached and put silver bands on their arms ... No one may enter the idol-house except the warriors {meo). On their return from the war, they first hang their clothes and the holy objects on a tree to cool them off, and then they are put away in the idol-house {urne le'u). At the beginning of the wet season people go and eat in the idol-house, rice and the ears of slain animals. At harvest time also food is given first to this house." All this fits in very well with what is said by Forbes concerning the eastern part of the island. Another thing mentioned only by the Dutch writers is the belief in werewolves. This is found in various other parts of Indonesia. Gramberg states that people who have the power to assume the form of an animal, such as a dog or a cat, are called suayi. Martinho uses this word in a different connotation, or rather with a somewhat vague connotation as " sorcerer," and the Dutch information is more definite. Gramberg adds that during the time of his transformation the suarji feeds principally on human blood. " In many villages/' he says, " there is someone who is regarded as such a fatal individual. Sometimes this idea is ascribed to innocent old people who have something peculiar in appearance or manner. Usually a suayi is respected, but if there is an outbreak of disease in a village, then all fear of him is forgotten, and the accused person is put to death without any form of trial." The natives of central Timor believe that a man can inherit the nature of a werewolf, either through con- tagion, e.g. by marriage or by eating at the same table as a werewolf. He can be recognized if seen standing on his head stark naked without any idea of what is happening around him ; also if it proves impossible to wake him from sleep. A definite test is to turn such a sleeping person about. The soul-stuff that has gone forth from him to take the werewolf form comes back, perhaps, in the shape of a mouse. It enters through the anus, too quickly to be seen. If the body has been turned round, it is lost for a moment and can be spied as it seeks to enter. The werewolf takes the shape of a dog, snake, centipede, owl, etc., and seizes the soul- substance of sleepers. If he eats this soul-stuff, he changes it into a buffalo, goat or pig, but such animals have a human head. " The werewolf man eats this animal up with his family, and the owner of the eaten soul-stuff dies," says Grijzen. The references to material objects buried with the dead or kept in the urna lulik suggest possibilities for the archaeologist, but probably none of these vessels would be very ancient. Our author says concerning such things : "In the present-day ceremonies there are properly speaking no sacred pots or utensils, but I recall having heard references to very ancient vessels of Chinese ware, to which was attributed a value that made them worthy of ftémali." This pémali is the Malay name for the state of sacredness, the tabu state described in Tetum as lulik, in Vaikenu and the west as le'u, and in other dialects by other terms. Incidentally, although the term</page><page sequence="21">PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR 211 urna, house, goes back to an Original Indonesian yumah, the other term is non- Indonesian - once again the combination of the two. In de Castro's Flores de Coral, lulik is said to be " that which gives or brings rain/' and he attributes the sacredness of eels (to be mentioned below) to the fact that they are met with in fresh water. This does not fully explain it, for such ideas reach beyond Timor. As in Melanesia, a palm branch placed before fruit trees makes them lulik and secures the fruit for the owners' uses. Thus the urna lulik is not only a temple but a museum of history. Amid these objects the rai lulik on the eve of fresh struggles came to perform his ceremonies, consult the entrails of animals, and mark with a mixture of betel, lime and areca nut the foreheads of the warriors to make them invulnerable. The temple stood usually in the village but might be outside, according to the position of the leo-rai's house. The word lulik means tabu or holy. Certain thickets are lulik places, because they are the refuges of souls wandering the world and thus are dangerous places to enter and interrupt the repose of the spirits. Even to-day, alongside bush tracks will be found heaps of little branches, on which passers-by will throw a twig as they go, each twig representing a prayer to the spirits of the bush to be propitious. Before setting out on a journey of any length, the native seeks to find out the will of the spirits, whether the journey will be blessed or not. The priest bears various titles, chiefly rai lulik but also makai lulik, dato lulik (sacred chief) or dato lelo (heavenly chief). He presides at rites, consults the entrails of animals to know whether any enterprise will be successful, his agreement is necessary before a war can be undertaken, and he makes the warriors invulnerable before they set out. It is through his agency that rain for crops and gardens is sought in time of drought. He is drawn from the ranks of the commoners and is not distinguished either by his dress or manner of life. He is neither doctor nor diviner. Martinho has an interesting footnote about the eel, which in certain mountain regions of Timor was practically a sacred creature. He writes as follows : " In certain regions of Timor, chiefly Maubisi, Ai-Leu, Turis-Kai, Sum and Manu-Fahi (these are mostly in Mambai country), eels were treated in small permanent waters with great care almost amounting to veneration. The eel was a sacred creature, that the Timorese could not ill-use. At a certain time of the year a festival is made for them and food given them in the water . . . The fact is that the Timorese consider the eel to be the spirit of the water, with the power of preventing the streams in which it lives from drying up, the liquid being needed for the plantations of corn and the gardens on the banks. In other parts such as Suai (south coast) and almost all the southern coast, the crocodile is the sacred animal, and receives a similar cult. These are the protecting animals of the tribe." Martinho gives no hint as to whether any form of totemism is present in the island. Further information about the crocodile-cult is forthcoming from the Dutch side in Veth's Het Eiland Timor. As- quoted by Kruijt (Het Animisme, p. 191), he says : " Another picture of the super- stitious honouring of the crocodile we find among the Timorese. In earlier times</page><page sequence="22">212 PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR there was a barbaric custom conjoined with the honour. The princes of Kupang - one of the states in the island - believed that they were descended from crocodiles, and whenever a new ruler ascended the throne, he gathered the populace with the nobles on the beach at the spot where the king was to be installed with a solemn offering to these creatures. This offering consisted of a pig with red bristles, but at the same time a young woman, beautifully dressed and decorated with flowers and rubbed with sweet-smelling oil, would be set right on the bank on a rock, and tied to a stone set there for the purpose. The crocodiles would then be summoned by the warriors present, and usually one of these monsters appeared quickly, and carried the girl back with it into the water, but according to popular belief, really married the girl." Bickmore has a briefer account also, from Semau. There is a certain superstition also about the gecko-lizard, which is regarded as a messenger of the nitu, spirits of the dead, and its call is believed to presage death in a household where it is heard. Such beliefs are not limited to Timor. De Castro tells us that the python was not venerated, but in Lautem, in the extreme east of Timor, certain small black snakes called rat nain, " lords of the earth " (Tetum term) were venerated. The Dagoda people, however, hunt and kill crocodiles. Certain species of monkeys also, about three feet long, were lulik to these people and could not be hunted or eaten. This looks like totemic belief, especially in combination with the statement already quoted that the princes of Kupang believed themselves descended from crocodiles. The Timorese do not make idols, but de Castro records the existence in the Museu Municipal at Dilli of some wooden figures from Lautem, chiefly of buffalo heads, and anthropomorphic carvings from Atauro (Pulo Kambing or Goat Island) of mede and female faces, some large, some small, and some curious figurines adorning shields and targets in various colours, which recall Polynesian sculptures. The Timorese do recognize the existence of at least one superior being, named Maroimak, who lives in lale:han, the sky, and along with Maroimak are two other eternal beings who carry on, the one a continual process of accusing humanity, the other of protecting it. " One is the agent of evil spirits, the other the advocate of good ones." Martinho does not see any Christian influences at work here, but it is not impossible that they are present. At the western end of the island the pantheon is richer. There, in Kupang, we find four beings mentioned : Usnenog Ape* en, the god who has created everything, Usnenog naik, " great god/' Usnenog Aiuta, " the giver," and Usnenog Naik Ifenai, the great god's wife, i.e. the earth. The first-named receives offerings of brown pigs, goats and fowls and rice, the second receives black offerings, the third brown ones, but they must be females, " while to the spirit of the earth everything can be offered." (Kruijt, p. 467.) Our Dutch authorities mention Nat Mèromak, " Lord God," as worshipped in Belu of their territory, close to the Portuguese border. He, however, is a " high god " in the sense of being too far above men to worry about them and men do not pay him much honour. He does, however, remain in touch with his creation, and he is invoked as witness of the truth of an oath. Of the dead it is said that Nat Mèromak has taken</page><page sequence="23">PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR 213 him to himself, and his name is often used in the making of solemn promises. Gramberg calls the deities Usi Neno, " Sun Lord," and Usi Afu, " Earth mistress/1 but gives similar details about them. Usi Neno is used by the missionaries for " God." Death and What Follows. Martinho says nothing about seven souls, but states that the soul of a departed person goes to lale:han, and that this sky-world contains a special department for the souls of warriors. The approach of death finds the dying person surrounded by relatives who happen to be within reach. When death has taken place, it is announced by loud wailings by the side of the body or at the door of the house, and messengers are sent to neighbouring villages with the news, and to summon relatives to the funeral. The body is placed in a coffin, or the hollowed trunk of a tree and wrapped in the best clothing available, and elaborate homage is paid to it by the relatives. A wake is observed, which develops into a night of orgy in the village. Friends and relatives sit around the corpse. One of the elders rises and eulogizes the deceased's virtues, and the others repeat in chorus the improvised lamentations of the leader with a simulated emotion. Finally the groups take their places again, and the youngest even play cards of bidu doit. The introduction of alcohol has not been without its effects. Songs are sung, which gradually become changed in tone, and the night often finishes with girls and youths going off to amuse themselves apart. The actual funeral is a time of renewed lamentations and Chinese fireworks are also called into service. With the dead are placed certain objects valued by him during life, such as his implements for preparing betel nut, a plate, basin, spoon, fire (vide Kruijt, p. 311). In the mouth are placed some coins needed for business deals in the other life. On the corpses of nobles there used to be put jewels and appreciable quantities of money. " Piles of earth alternated with piles of pots, cups and vases, which were often broken to avoid robbery, frequent in those times." As previously noted, there was no common cemetery, the dead being interred - Martinho does not say in what position - either close to or actually within the village. A process of mummification was practised, the body, lying in its tree-trunk coffin, being placed close to a fire, sometimes where the heat could get directly at itt like a smoking chamber. Martinho suggests that this was done when it was found impossible for the relatives to meet the full expenses of the funerals, the completion of which was necessary for the repose of the soul, and so the full funeral was delayed for financial reasons. He tells of the discovery in 1934 in a cave the body of a chief who perished in the revolt of 1911-12. To-day the funeral takes place twenty-four hours after death, and the body is honoured by the sacrifice of a buffalo, keeping the big ceremony for later. This ceremony was called akoi mate (burial of the dead), and was one of the biggest demands on flocks and herds. The ceremonies lasted for weeks and involved perhaps a hundred buffaloes and dozens of pigs and goats. Nowadays a tax has been placed</page><page sequence="24">214 PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR on the akoi mate in order to limit the number of animals used. At the time of the akoi mate, a special place is prepared in the house of the relatives of the dead for the honoured person to take part in the sacrifices. At a certain time/a horse is apparelled and led by the bridle by one of the relatives to the grave near which the spirit of the deceased is wandering, and which the Timorese believe they can see, wearing a counterpart of its human form. The horse is led back to the village by the bridle, and the crowd returns with it. Martinho does not give a full explanation of the rite, but the idea seems to be that the spirit rides back on the horse to take part in the final requiem. This ceremony of the akoi mate has not died out even in Christian communities, for our author records in a footnote that in Maubara in 1922 Christians were invited to a requiem for the soul of a departed member of the community, to be followed by an akoi mate. He adds : "In this ceremony the horse was to seek the soul of the dead person." A further paragraph is also of interest, and one could have wished that he had developed the theme a little more : " In less elaborate ceremonies, for people of inferior rank, the soul of the departed does not go to the feast. It is enough to have some earth and stones from the grave, that the relatives go to seek, and that take the place of the spirit." In the southern Tetum region, within Dutch territory, we are told again by Grijzen that the bodies of kings were allowed to remain for three or four days, then sprinkled with ashes, and the skin, flesh and internal organs scratched and pulled out. Parts that refused to come away easily were left for another couple of days and then subjected to the same treatment. When only the frame remained the family began to wail, because then at last is the man really dead. The frame was interred with splendid ceremonies, but the pieces of the body that had come away were simply buried in a hole. Another Portuguese writer tells that the corpse was exposed on the branches of a tree in an open coffin, or the wives of a deceased chief kept the body during the time of putrefaction in a kneeling position, and only when the flesh had decayed and the remains were reduced to a semi-mummified condition were they buried, facing the sun, " the chief's father." H. O. Forbes illustrates a curious grave pole, with holes through it in each of which is set a pig's jawbone. This is done for people of rank only. Bickmore mentions a grave-place on Semau, marked by a low wall enclosing a small irregular patch of ground containing one or more graves. These have foot and head stone consisting of pyramidal blocks of wood, set with the apex in the ground. In early times the funerals of kings had a more complicated ceremonial, " at times even tragic," says Martinho. That this is a reference to human sacrifice becomes clear from his next paragraph, in which he says, " Dominated by the idea that the soul, after the death of the body begins a new existence, in which needs of a material order are felt, the leo-rai could not go down to the grave without taking with him someone to serve him. His favourite servant had to accompany him in the same tomb. On the day of burial, this servant, mounting his master's favourite horse, passed through the village and enjoyed his last day of life." Both slave and horse were killed. Sometimes a number of slaves perished. Nowadays a dog is</page><page sequence="25">PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR 215 substituted for them. Grijzen bears out this practice for Dutch Timor and Veth says that in Kupang two or three slaves were buried alive with the body of a king. Grijzen says, however, that sometimes the horse was not killed but given to the wife's family. The after-life was not regarded as involving any ethical concepts or judgments. The soul was in a state of repose, and Martinho adds, " There are regions where many natives do not accept this belief about their destiny, but admit metempsychosis/' He goes on to add another interesting note : " The idea of laleihan varies from region to region. Some believe it is necessary to be tattooed before one can be admitted to Paradise, and those who reach the gate of heaven untattooed make a small expiation ; but there are others who do not recognize this and do not practise it." He has not made any previous reference to tattooing, but E. E. Long in the Encyclopedia Britannica article on Timor states that it is practised, and de Castro says that breast and lower arms were the places marked. Amulets also play an important part in Timorese life, but descriptions of them are forthcoming only for the Dutch area, from the pen of Grijzen. In Tetum they are called kakaluk, which may mean either the betel-box or an amulet, something in which stones and bits of roots of different kinds are kept. These are indicated also in dreams. They are kept in a small space within the ridge of the house roof. Those which have been in the house for generations are more honoured and more powerful than new ones. There are also kakaluk of tribal importance, which are talismans for war. The owner of a kakaluk must spread rice before it two or three times a day. Sacrifice is made to the old kakaluk if they are thought to be the causes of misfortunes. A kakaluk will be worn in battle as a sure protection to the wearer. Martinho adds at this point a note on inheritance. "The authority in the domestic circle, after the death of the head of the family, passed to the widow. After her death, it went to the eldest son who was capable of taking on the burden. If the children were minors and unable to exercise authority, they came under the protection of the nearest relative." If a man died without family, the leo-rai was regarded as his heir. He could also constitute himself a man's heir if he celebrated funeral rites in the man's honour. Property left by a dead man goes to the widow and children. The father inherits the goods of a son who dies without a constituted family. Some family possessions were never divided. Amongst these were jewels. These were regarded as family property and were transmitted entire from father to son. " Some of these jewels had names and histories that made them worthy of the urna lulik, and thither they would go." - Martinho adds that the transmission of property formed one of the most difficult administrative problems in Timor. He thinks that the great divergences of custom in different parts is due to mixture of races. According to Martinho, of outward sign of mourning there was usually none, but individuals might be found amongst the men who would not trim their beards, and women who would not do their hair, during a certain time. This does not altogether agree with the Dutch authorities. The author says that he has</page><page sequence="26">2i6 PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR never heard of women wailing for hire - which is not surprising, as such is not a custom in Oceania. Cultivation. Of foodstuffs one of the commonest is rice. In Tetum, as in most Indonesian languages, there are three words for rice : hare is rice in the husk ; fos (western Timor mnes) is rice husked but uncooked ; cooked rice is he:tu (western Timor maku). It is interesting that both the dry and the wet methods of cultivation are in use, according to locality, for in the mountainous interior, if I interpret Martinho aright, the dry method of cultivation is used instead of terracing. Rice grown by wet cultivation is called hare rai halai, literally, rice of the garden ground, and rice grown by dry cultivation is called hare rai loron, summer rice. The chief instrument of gardening is the ai suak, a digging stick about a yard and a half long, with one end pointed. Wet-cultivated rice is planted just after the rainy season, or even before the rains have finished, and a certain amount of terracing is then practised in the inland parts. The irrigation channels (western Timor opa) are built by communal labour by the inhabitants of one or more knua. The water is distributed by means of pots, and buffaloes are used to tread the ground into a state of morass. The seed is then planted, after having been put into water for a few days to germinate, inside bags, so as to root itself more easily in the ground. Sometimes little seed-boxes are used and the young rice plants are transplanted when they are about a hand's breadth high. This part of the work belongs to the women. The Tetum name for this process is suku hare, transplanting rice. De Castro provides the text of a Tetum song, which he calls a harvest-song, but which seems to fit better as a sowing-song, and to be a piece of sympathetic magic aimed at the production of a good crop. It runs as follows : Kotu hare malore Neli basa, Sa:ma hare malore, Neli basa, Neli ba nu: tahan Nu: malore ; Neli ba bu'a tahan Bu*a malore. Kulu leba rai monu, Notar raut ona, Rai monu lakate*u, Notar raut ona. With the alteration of his rau to raut near the end, his translation requires very little change : " We reap the rice dancing, and we go into the shade to thresh the grain. We go into the shade of the coconuts and dance, and thresh in the shade of</page><page sequence="27">PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR 217 areca palms. Now the breadfruit falls into our arms and in masses we will take them up. Now the turtle-doves settle, and the water is rising." Martinho does not describe the dry cultivation of rice in such detail, except to say that rice grown this way is called keru, which applies to mountain-grown rice in general, and that such rice is more aromatic than that produced by wet cultivation. The wet-cultivation land is allowed to lie fallow for a year after a crop is gathered. Dry-rice and corn are grown on the one system. From July to September the thick grass and undergrowth are cut down ; in October fire is applied to the now dead grass, the ground is cleared of tree trunks that do not burn away, and these are piled in heaps and burned again. Sometimes the inhabitants of a knua unite to clear a large tract of land in this way, and they unite also to build the lutun, the palisade which keeps beasts away. The planting of the rice and corn takes place in November, after the first rains. This is women's work, for which the ai suak is used. With this the holes are made in the ground, in which two or three grains are put, and covered over by skilful movements of the big toe of the right foot. The first weeding takes place after a month, and the second a month later ; between the two weedings sweet potatoes are planted, but, says our author, " for this purpose it is usual to prepare . . . special land, rather than grow it with the corn. But this is at the end of February and March, when the rainy season is nearly over." In certain parts of the north coast, where the water supply is assured, there is a second planting season, and corn planted at this time is called baiar bai loron, dry season corn, and the other is called baiar udan, rain corn. Hunting methods are of interest, in that they recall those used by Australian natives. The natives of Timor get together during the summer particularly, and fire large tracts of land- men, women and children all taking part. Spears, lances, bows and arrows have been prepared in advance, and the hunting horses made ready. The signals are given on trumpets of buffalo horn ; the hunters distribute themselves in groups around the country to be hunted, and this is fired from the circumference towards the centre. Buffaloes, pigs and other animals seek in vain for a way of escape from the flames ; " mad with terror, hearing close at hand the infernal noise of the burning vegetation, they rush in a body straight in the direction where the hunters are awaiting them." Trained hunting dogs are kept in leash until wounded stragglers have to be dealt with and then they are loosed. The hunt may last for a week, and dozens or even a hundred victims may be taken. The whole procedure, however, is not without risk to the hunter, and limb or life may be lost, horses be lamed or dogs killed by the infuriated animals. If meat is plentiful, it will be cut in strips and dried over a fire or in the sun. " Thus prepared, it sells at a good price in the Chinese market, and is an object of barter in the regional bazaars." Head-hunting. Some mention must be made of the practice of head-hunting, which was rife throughout the island. There is even a special word for a headless corpse - western Timor tu:taf. The term nitu, spirit, is also applied to such a body. This was not</page><page sequence="28">2i8 PEOPLES AND LANGUAGES OF TIMOR only the common, but also the recognized, method of gaining the prowess of the enemy. It did not develop into cannibalism in any form in this island. There is no mention by any author of even ceremonial cannibalism. Heads were never taken from one's own locality, but only those of other tribes, and the warriors returning victorious sang songs about the heads they had taken. One in the non-Indonesian Makasai dialect is given by de Castro : Kirilili ! Rubi Lai gi da' e ai last ! Rifilili ! Bada keikei I Rubi Lai gi da e ai lasi. This he translates as " Traíala ! Rubi Lói's head is cut off." After the ceremonies were over, the warriors (meo) hung up the heads on a lulik tree. Again one may be permitted to make a comparison (without committing oneself to historical conclusions) with Fiji. In that group also the killing of a certain number of warriors gave a man the right to certain titles of valour. In Timor, " the head of an enemy was the greatest trophy a man could bring back to his village from the war. He feels himself exalted by his action, and so gains, with this trophy, his consecration ; the title of asu-ai, the valiant, or cutter-off of heads." The word itself seems to mean in Tetum wood-dog, but if I interpret it aright, its real meaning is still not explained. Cutting oñ an anemy's head was the custom that remained longest alive in the mind of the native out of all his old customs. The cutting was done with the surik-ulun, " head sword." A man could not merely claim for himself the title of asu-ai. It was officially bestowed after trials and ordeals had been gone through in addition to the fact of one or more heads having been brought back. In such ordeals it was always the women who demanded most. " The obstacles were, sometimes, of such difficult forms, the jumps and obstacles to cross so great, simulating attacks on forts or the chase after enemies, that not all ever came through with clear proof. But there was in these ceremonies, as in all the manifestations where love or fear rule, the possibility of stratagem and trickery : a dato never failed to become a sure asu-ai ; the girls were the first to demand this quality for him." Martinho notes the absence of secret societies in Timor. After noting this fact, he passes on to a discussion of the relative place of different elements of the social organization in Timor, comparing them with Celebes and Borneo. These, however, do not concern us here. Such conclusions as can safely be drawn regarding the relationships of the various elements of population in the island, can be best drawn after a consideration of the available linguistic data as well, and this will be the subject of the second part of this paper.
