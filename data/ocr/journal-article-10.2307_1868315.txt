DIGGINS Once catch well the knack of this scheme of thought and you are lucky if you ever get away from it. It is all you can see. William James, "Hegel and Hi.s Method," 1909 THE LIFE OF Max Eastman offers one of the most remarkable careers in twentieth-century American intellectual 1history. During his rich and ac- tive literary years, he wrote over twenty books dealing with art, science, poetry, philosophy, humor, journalism, esthetics, anthropology, religion, capitalism, socialism, Soviet culture, German politics, Freudian psychol- ogy, and Marxism. He also composed five volumes of verse, a novel, two volumes of memoirs, a pioneering analysis of the young Trotsky's person- ality, and two collections of brilliant biographical portraits in which he brought to life an unlikely gallery of close friends and acquaintances: Eugene Debs and Albert Einstein, Carlo Tresca and Edna St. Vincent Millay, Ernest Hemingwvay and George Santayana, Johln Dewey and Sig- mund Freud, Bertrand Russell and Charles Chaplin. In addition, he pub- lished the radical journals The Alasses and The Liberator and later be- came, ironically, a "rovingr editor" for Reader's Digest and one of the first editorial advisers to William Buckley's conservative National Review. Mloreover, after having mastered Russian in a little more than a year, he skillfully translated Pushkin as wvell as Trotsky's monumental three-volume History of the Russian Revolution, edited an abridged Das Kapital for the Modern Library, smuggled out of the Soviet Union a copy of Lenin's "Testament," and produced a historic documentary film on the Russian Revolution.l Eastman's reputation was as magnetic as his writings were prolific.

Between 1912 and 1923 he became one of the dominant figures in American cultural life. His career before World War I con- sisted in a sustained round of intellectual and political activism. WVhile writing poetry, lecturing in philosophy at Columbia University, and edit- ing the lively, sardonic Masses, he championed the cause of the anarcho- syndicalist Wobblies, became a leading spokesman for the radical feminist movement, and, together with his adored sister, Crystal, organized the American Union Against Militarism. Durino these joyous years Eastman emerged as the orphic bard of the Left, the eloquent lyricist of libera- tion. "When I was up at Columbia University," wrote publisher Lincoln Schuster two decades later, one of the most unforgettable and most glamorous experiences I recall in my student life was the first lecture I heard by Max Eastman before the Socialist Study Club. He came before us then as the fair-haired apostle of the new poetry, the knight errant of a new and rebellious generation, the man who was making Ilis dreams come true-as poet, as thinker, as editor, as teacher, as psychologist, as philosopher, as a yea-sayer of the joy and adventure of living in the fullest and richest sense of the word. Even then Max was already a glamorous, exciting figure in the world of letters and in the world of adventure. Life was bursting in all its radiance all around-him. For him existence was a fight, a song, a revolution, a poem, an affirmation. Max is a dazzingly many-sided person, but his lust after the real, the intense, the beautiful enriches and colors his whole life, and his revolutionary ideology gives it direction and discipline. Thus an exuberant vitality courses through all hiis personal history-an uncompromising courage and passion for justice control it at every critical point. Whether life is a pageant or a predicament, a crisis or a contemplation, Max is always feeling and celebrating the qualities of things. The higlh spiritedness of youth and the deep thinking and clear seeing of radical teaching enabled him to integrate the qualities of the poet, the scientist, alid man of action, and above all, the man who never betrays his sense of beauty or sense of humor.2 The very man who "looked Beauty and spoke Jtustice"3 to the Green- wich Village Left would become a heretic to the next generation of Amer- ican radicals-the Old Left of the 193os. For Eastman became the first requires thorough knowledge of Russian and sensibility to the demands of literary art. In the estimate of critic F. W. Dupee, "Eastman's a(lmirable translation has made The History of the Rtussian Revolution an English classic." (Leon Trotsky, The Russian Revolution, ed. F. W. Dupee [Garden City, N.Y., 1959], viii.) Eastman also translated Trotsky's The Real Situation in Russia, The Revolution Betrayed, and, most significantly, The Young Lenin, which has just been published by Doubleday. Trotsky's important biography of Lenin wvas started in 1933, but both his uncompleted manuscript and Eastman's unfinished translation mysteriously disappeared for thirty years, only to turn up in Harvard's Houghton Library a short time before Eastman's death in 1969. Whether the Trotsky-Eastman manuscript was accidentally lost or deliberately suppressed for the duration of Stalinism, as Eastman suspected, is unclear. The library had no record of how it was acquired. The author would appreciate hearing from anyone with information regarding this matter. 2 Max Schuster to Victor Gollancz, May 13, 1936, Eastman Papers, Lilly Library, Indiana University. 3Joseph Freeman, An Americatn Testament (New York, 1936), 103.</page><page sequence="3">40 John P. Diggins major Amnerican writer to subject Marxism to a penetrating philosophical and psychological critique by bringing Fretud's insights to bear upon the Marxist concept of ideology. Indeed, he was perhaps the first writer in the Western world to draw a critical distinction between the ideas of Marx and the actions of Lenin in order to make a case for the October Revo- lution that would infuriate both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. He was also one of the first literary intellectuals to expose the suppression of cultural freedom under Stalin, and one of the first radical partisans of Lenin and Trotsky to renounce the whole Soviet experiment. This paper focuses primarily on Eastman's critique of Marxism as a philosophical system, for many of the issues raised in his analysis remain worthy of attention after a half century of debate and revisionism. While most contemporary Marx- ists concede the terrors of the Stalin regime, few concede the limitations of Mfarxism as a philosophy of history. Indeed, thanks to the revival of Heegel and the recent attention devoted to the writings of the Frankfurt school, philosophic Marxism is more alive today than it has been since the 1930S. The revival of Hegelian Marxism makes Eastman's reflections more relevant than ever. MAX EASTMAN'S radicalism sprouted from native soil. Before he had be- come a convert to Marxian socialism in 1912, he had already taken his stand on the Left as a staunch agnostic, a severe critic of nationalism and militarism, and a witty castigator of class distinctions. His early intel- lectual hero-es included Mark Twain, whom he had known as a youth in Elmira, New York; WValt Whitman, the democratic poet of "communion" and "amnativeness"; and Thorstein Veblen, whose Theory of the Leisure Class offered him both a critique of orthodox economics and a justification for his assault upon respectability. Despite his commitment to Veblen's cool, controlled rationalism as well as John Dewey's scientific methodol- ogy, Eastman was imbued with a religious idealism inherited from his "hieroic" mother and "saintly" father, both ordained Congregational min- isters. Their "Christiani ideal," he later reflected, "demands that life itself, as we live it, be transcended and superseded and changed. It is a utopian ideal, and ethically, at least, revolutionary." The generational transfusion of idealism came particularly from his mother, whom Eastman always looked back upon as his "first great companion." As a freshman at Oberlin College, Annis Ford Eastman had written a theme that proposed "the theory that God himself is joy-a vast stream of joy surrounding all of us." His mother impressed upon him the idea that life should be lived in- tensely as a continuous adventure in self-realization and social responsi- bility. "She believed that the essential secret of the joyous life, no matter where you start from, is to be ever in a state of growth.'"4 4 Max Eastman, Enjoyment of Living (New York, 1948), 23, 236, 293; Heroes 1 Have Known (New York, 1942), 104-42; Great Comtipaniorns: Critical Mermioirs of Somie Famous Friends (New York, 1959), 299-312.</page><page sequence="4">Getting Hegel out of History 41 A basic tension resides in Eastman's early intellectual development-a tension he believed Marxism would resolve. Eastman's idealistic thirst for a "vast stream of joy" found an outlet in poetry, in the subjective realm of emotion, mystery, imagination, love, beauty, moral vision, and freedom. At the same time his agnostic revolt against religion found an outlet in science, in the objective world of fact and experience, in the verifiable processes of natural causation, and in logical analysis and empirical ex- planation. Eastman was aware of the dichotomy. Poetic man, he pointed out in 1913, is interested in describing the immediate qualities of things and receiving and realizing experience for the sake of experience, not as a means to an end, but as a "lust after the intense," not to learn about the world, but "to taste the flavor of its being." Scientific man, on the other hand, substitutes appreciation for achievement; his desire is to alter, manipulate, and control the environment with little comprehension of what is being transformed and even less capacity for enjoying what has been made. Nevertheless, Eastman originally hoped-as would Dewey- that the poetic and practical impulses within man could be reconciled, that creative vision and social action could be made compatible. For poetry is also "instrumental" knowledge since it "affects that significant imagery" in our mind and thereby renders abstract ideas concrete. And in life, if not in art, "the realization of ideas is part of the adventure of being."5 Thus before he had fully studied the subject, Marxism appealed to Eastman's two contradictory impulses-his poetic idealism and his scien- tific realism, his yearning for the imaginative world of the possible beyond the actual, and his dispassionate respect for the actual world of fact and experience. "It was this clash of impetuosities, the thirst of extreme ideals and argumentative clinging to facts, which led me to seize so joyfully upon Marx's idea of progress through working class struggle." As a phil- osophical proposition, Marxism seemed the soluition to the eternal dualism between fact and value, science and morality, empiricism and esthetics. Moreover, Marxism appeared to have answered one of the greatest problems in social philosophy: how to attain a perfect society with imperfect human beings. Eastman recalled Mark Twain's answer when the novelist was asked what he thought about socialism: "I can't even hope for it. I know too much about human nature." Marxism offered an answer to Twain's and Eastman's dilemma. While acknowledging the limitations of historic man, it fulfilled contemporary man's "need to line up fiercely with the ideal against the real." Instead of trying to change human nature, Marx took humankind "as it is" and used the class. strug- gle as a "driving force" to abolish the conditions that made human na- ture "work badly." A philosophy that turned paradoxes into truisms, Marxism resolved both the classical dualisms in epistemology and the existential antinomies in social reality. Psychologically, Marxism gave Eastman what poetry gave Yeats: the ability to hold together justice and 5 Max Eastman, Enjoyrnent of Poetry (New York, 1913), 3-19, 136-53.</page><page sequence="5">42 John P. Diggins truth within a single thought. "Here was a method," Eastman exclaimed, "of attaining the ideal based upon the very facts that made it seem unat- tainable. I need no longer extinguish my dreams with my knowledge. I need never again cry out: 'I wish I believed in the Son of God and his second coming.'" Far from exalting in his "conversion," however, Eastman preferred to call his new-found creed a "hard-headed idealism" that ac- cepted Marx's philosophy simply as a "matter of fact interpretation of history."6 Torn between reality and desire, between his skeptical knowledge of human limitations and his will to believe in the possibility of transcend- ence, Eastman saw in Marxism a system of ideas that enabled man to trans- form the real into the ideal and a program of action that furnished the means of overcoming the contradictions of class society. So inspired, he went on to become one of America's most eloquent spokesmen for the Bolshievik Revolution. Unlike other Village radicals such as John Reed and Emma Goldman, Eastman was not troubled by Lenin's reversal of trade-union policy, the Comintern's twenty-one "demands," and the ill- fated Kronstadt uprising. The sharp twists and turns in Bolshevik policy merely demonstrated to Eastman the superiority of Lenin's intellect- "that of astute, flexible, undoctrinaire, unbigoted, supremely purposive, and I judged experimental, intelligence."' In Eastman's panegyrics Lenin emerged as the "free-minded engineer of revolution," the man of action as well as ideas, the revolutionary who alone had the nerve to impose will upon reality and to seize history with both hands. In 1918, when the Bolshevik leader lay stricken by an assassin's bullet, Eastman published a poem in praise of Lenin's steadiness of will and fluidity of mind: Men that have stood like mountains in the flood Of change that runs like ruin through the earth, When murder takes the sanctity of birth, When food is fire and harvest-treasure blood, Men that like fixed eternal stars have stood, Their faith clear-shining sadly, and their mind Unmaddened by the madness of their kind- They were the godlike, they the great and good. With light, and mountain steadiness, and power, And faith like theirs in this all-fluid hour, You to the dreadful depth of change descend, And with its motions moving it, you blend Your conquering purpose as blue rivers roll Through all the ocean's waters toward the pole.8 Four years later Eastman visited the Soviet Union. At first he was im- pressed by the triumphs of the Red Army and by the energy and health 6 Max Eastman, Love and Revolution: My Journey Through an Epoch (New York, 1964), 14-16; Enjoyment of Living, 355.

Bolshevik leaders gracefully received him, and Trotsky befriended him as an intellectual comrade. But while Eastman toured the countryside and studied Russian in the Marx-Engels Institute Library, Stalin began to launch the campaign against Trotsky. Even though Eastman attended the 1923 Party Congress, he was unaware of the struggle for power behind the scenes. Then the danse macabre un- folded with Lenin's death in January 1924. As the party apparatchiks be- gan to move against the anti-Stalinist opposition, Trotsky advised East- man to leave the country with documents that would expose Russia's internal struggle for power. Those documents included important extracts from what later came to be known as Lenin's last "Testament," in which the premier, dictating to his wife from his deathbed, called for Stalin's re- moval from the post of general secretary. Eastman had the documents published shortly after he arrived in London in late 1924. He now started his long and lonely campaign to promote Trotsky, "the most universally gifted man in the world today," as the Bolshevik whose "superior moral and intellectual revolutionary greatness" made him Lenin's legitimate successor. The following year he moved to France and began working in the Bibliotheque Nationale on a book that, as a defense of Bolshevism, would shock the communist world.9 THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT in which Eastman was investigating the intel- lectual origins of Marxism was a critical period for the future of Marxist philosophy. In the early 1920S the Comintern embarked upon the task of "bolshevizing" national communist parties, an effort that led Soviet of- ficials to lay claim to the whole corpus of Marxism as interpreted by the Russians Plekhanov and Lenin. By and large the Soviet school of thought consisted in the scientific codification of Marx's ideas worked out by En- gels after his mentor's death. This version, which also pervaded much of Western socialist thought before World War I, had been prevalent among many Bolshevik party members before the Revolution. After 1921, when older professors of philosophy had been removed from Russian univer- sities, official Soviet Marxism amounted to what Gustav Wetter has aptly called a "crude" and "vulgar materialism."10 Three important European communist philosophers reacted to the petrification of Marxism: the Italian Antonio Gramsci, the Hungarian Georg Lukacs, and the German Karl Korsch. All three desired to re- humanize Marxism by returning to its classical heritage. Lukacs and Korsch especially sought to recapture the Hegelian dimension of Marx's 9 Eastman, Love and Revolution, 350-56; Since Lenin Died (New York, 1925); Leon Trotsky: The Portrait of a Youth (New York, 1925), v; "Lenin's Testament," Dec. 25, 1922, "Supplement," Jan. 4, 1923, Eastman Papers. Scholars of such diverse political views as Leonard Schapiro and Isaac Deutscher have praised Eastman's Since Lenin Died for its prescience.

The "dialectical conception of totality," Lukacs annouinced in 1923, would end the debate over materialism and idealism iby reui-i fying subject and object and synthesizing theory and practice in the trans- forming powver of the proletariat, whose uiniversal class consciolusness man- ifested the character of an idea realized as material force. Invoking a sim- ilar imperative, Korsch called upon plhilosoplers to grasp the "essential and necessary relation between German philosophy and Marxism." Only when the true function of the dialectic is properly conceived wvill Marx- ism remain a permanent revolutionary approach to history and reality. For a Marxism without Hegel can easily lose its power of negation, just as a Hegelianism without Marx lost its pover of realization. To reunite the two systems of thought was the role of the revolutioniary philosoplher. "If we do this," Korsch advised, "xve can see at once not only the inter- relations between German idealist philosoplhy and Marxism, butt also their internal necessity."1'' Eastman was unaware of the writings of Lukacs and Korsch. But it is a revealing irony in comparative intellectual history that the first Ameri- can to grasp the connection between Hegel and Marx went on, not to reaffirm it, btut to repudiate it. Eastman's Marx and Lenin: The Science of Revoluition (1926) is an unusual specimen in the vast historiogTaphy of Marxism. Unlike many other authors, Eastman did not plunge into traditional issues that made Marxism so controversial in the disciplines of economics, sociology, and political science-namely, the labor theory of value, the principle of class struggle, and the Marxist theory of the state. Similarly, he did not indict Marxism for offering a false science of "prophecy," as would the antihistoricist scholars during World War II. Nor did he maintain, as would many American liberals in the late 1930s, that the failure of the Soviet Union to realize the ideals of Karl Marx disproved the ideas of Marxism. Although he would come to regard Stalinism as fturther proof of the fallacies of Marxism, Eastman's original critique was philosophical rather than political. Essentially it revolved around two simple but embarrassing epistemological questions: how did Marx come to know what he knew, and how do we know that it is true? Appropriately, the book opens with a chapter on the function of thought. Drawing upon Darwin and Freud, Eastman explained how dis- coveries in biology and psychology changed man's conception both of the world and of himself. By illuminating the naturalistic foundations of human behavior, these genetic sciences demonstrated that iiind functioned as an instrument governing either the conscious interests or the unconscious desires of man. The "instrumental interpretation of consciousness" denied that mind could free itself from the natural drives that motivate it in 11 Georg Lukacs, History and Class Consciousness: Studies in Marxist Dialectics (1923), tr.

"Not only the prior thing in the world is matter and not mind," observed Eastman, ")ut the prior thing in mind is impulse and not reason."'12 Eastman recognized that Marx, in the "Theses on Feuerbach," had developed a functional view of intelligence that resembled the modern pragmatic mode of knowledge. But the "internal necessity" between Marx- ism and German idealism hailed by Korsch and Lukacs seemed to Eastman an internal fallacy. WVhat separated Marx from Hegel were two different ontologies regarding the role of mind. Whereas Marx located consciousness in "practical-critical action," Hegel believed that the nature of consciousness was to be "discovered by examining the relation between categories of pure logic." For Marx, that is, truth was made in action and praxis; for Hegel "absolute knowledge" was noninstrumental, something found in thinking about thinking, knowledge knowing itself. According to Eastman, Marx passed over this crucial distinction when he found himself at an impasse with Feuerbach's materialism, a doctrine that could show Marx and Engels that matter is more fundamental than spirit but could not tell them where matter "is going." Driven by the need to find purpose in the material universe, Marx and Engels thus returned to Hegel and found in the principle of the dialectic the meaning and direction of history.13 Discussing the Marxist interpretation of history, Eastman illuminated the way in which Marx had retained the central Hegelian principles of historical understanding: that history is a "process" unfolding irrespective of the interests of the historian; that the process has "some one cause" that explains "all" and that does not necessarily derive from the conscious purposes of men; and that "this cause has the property of being logical in development, and of advancing by contradiction, and by the negation of negation." These Hegelian principles played havoc with Marx's language of historical de- scription, and Eastman proceeded to subject that language to the test of causal analysis. He found, for example, the alleged "logical contradiction" between "productive forces" and "production relations" to be a species of "speculative logic"' that allowed Marx to confuse the terms "contradiction," "conflict," and "rebellion." Similarly, lhe criticized Marx for interchanging the verbs "condition" and "cause," for mixing the two distinct ideas of "re- flection" and "result" when discussing culture and the superstructure, and for absorbing contingency into necessity by insisting that historical accidents are "compensated by other accidents." Eastman was aware, to be sure, of the qualifications expressed by Marx, Engels, and Trotsky regarding unilateral determinism, but he was equally aware that no Marxist, not even Plekhanov, had developed precise canons of inquiry that would help analyze the degrees of determinism in order to do justice to the complexity of historical events.14 12 Max Eastman, Marx and Lenin: The Science of Revolution (New York, 1927), 13-18, 31. 13 Ibid., 19-31. 14 Ibid., 47-64.</page><page sequence="9">46 John P. Diggins Any sensibility to the variety of historical phenomena was precluded by Hegel's dictum to "penetrate the unity" of all phenomena. To Eastman the quest for unity and totality not only did violence to the rich diversity and particularity of human experience, it also identified the historian with history itself. Hence he sought to demonstrate the essential dualism between the historian as subject and history as object. Whatever may be the ultimate nature of history, it is the historian who brings to it the questions and prob- lems at hand. WVith Hegelian Marxism, however, this distinction collapses. Hegel's "subject-object identity" led to the doctrine of historical necessity, wherein causal explanations bccome shrouded under the bloodless ab- straction of an "inner logic." The practical upshot is that Hegel's dis- embodied philosophy of history precluded bold action as well as precise explanation. To Eastman it vas man, not "logic," who made events happen; it wvas human intelligence, not "Absolute Mind," that must interpret ex- perience; and it wvas Karl Marx, not "history," who was determined to pro- duce a social revolution. Thus there remained only one way to salvage Marx- ism from the errors of Menshevism and to "escape the bonds of German idealism" as well: "That is to take the revolutionary motive out of 'history,' where Marx and Engels surreptitiouisly projected it, and locate it in the human breast where it belongs."15 WVhat prevented Marxists from doing this was their belief in dialectical mnaterialism. Eastman simply could not accept the dialectic as a "universal law of motion" either in human thought or in the material universe. He rejected, as a proceduire of knowing, "the whole myth about negating negations, and seeking in everything for its opposite, and never resting in an affirmative stateinent, and studying, everything in its logical self-move- ment, its inner-hostility against itself, and remembering that things can be both themselves and their opposites, and that cause and effect merge into each other, and that quantity becomes quality, and that nature makes jtiumps-this whole mixture of scientific commonplace with Hegelian higher- log,ical buncombe." All this represented to Eastman a form of "animistic thinkin,," an exercise in which Marx projected his own "desires" onto external reality, read into the un-conscious material world the unfolding "spirit" of German idealism, and thus found in Hegel a philosophy of the universe in which he already believed. Eastman realized that Engels was gtliltier than Marx in attributing human qualities to the properties of matter. Thus Enaels's attempt to take Hegel's definition of freedom as "necessity become conscious" and apply it to the "laws of nature" showed "either a naive innocence of the problem he is talking about, or that Hegelian sophisti- cation which is a mockery of innocence." Still, Marx as well as Engels accepted Hegelianism in much the same way as man accepts "religion" as a means of reconciling himself to a universe in wvhich he finds himself alienated. In essence, Hegelianism answered a psychological need. It enabled 15 Ibid., 62.</page><page sequence="10">Getting Hegel out of HistorY 47 Marx and Engels to "rationalize their aspirations" by "co-operating" witl a world view in which both consciousness ("self-change") and conditions ("changes of circumstances") are moving dialectically in a "congenial direction," ascending "from the lower to the hig,her" (Engels's words); a world view in which "true thought and the material wvorld are doing the same thing, and doing it together.''16 When Eastman accused Marx and Engels of "projecting" and "rational- izinog" their own desires, he was engaging in a most audacious critique. At the turn of the century Benedetto Croce had also criticized the meta- physical deification of historical materialism. But Eastman, independent of Croce in particular and of European philosophy in g,eneral, wvas broaching an attack that was being articulated at the sarime time in Germany by the Hungarian sociologist Karl Mannheim-Marxism itself imay be regarded as an "ideology" subject to a sociopsychological analysis of the derivation of its meaning.17 Marx was hardly exempt from ideological thinking, Eastman boldly argued, for his mind, too, was influenced by a cultural matrix that prevented him from seeing the genesis of his own ideas. Hence lhe could scorn the very human ideals that motivated him "morality and justice"-only because he confided their realization to the material forces of history in the tunconscious process of rendering the external world obedient to his mnoral vish. Similarly, MIarx's "immanent laws" of capitalist production, whiclh supposedly brought centralization and class coniflict, seemed to Eastimian-i like a reification of the "iron laws" of classical economics, which supposedly brought competition and social lharmony. To Marx's declaration that capital- ism "creates with the necessity of a nlatural process the negation of itself," Eastman simply asked: "Is it not quite obvious that it is not MIarx's knowNl- edge, but his purposes, that is being expressed?"18 To read purpose iiito his- tory, to perceive a dialectic of negation whose essence is not disclosed by em- pirical perception but instead by philosophical reflection, was to Eastman the very "false consciousniess" of ideology that mntst be challenged by the 16Ibid., 32-46, 112. The charge of 'aniinisnl,' of reading itito mittcr the attributes of huiiimani values, is similar to the "pathetic fallacy" of some nineteenth-ceistlix romantic writers, who carried over to inanimate objects the emotions of hutman l)eilgs aIn(l thereb)v mlade nature sympathize with their own feelings.

Noting that Max Weber, Werner Sombart, and Ernst Troeltscli hada begun to move in this direction, Mannheim added: "The analysis of thought and ideas in terms of itleologies is imiuch too important a weapon to become the permanent monopoly of any onie party.

Diggins true knowledge of science.19 Significantly, he believed the new psychology of Freud would aid in this effort, and he attempted to relate Freud's analysis of personality to Marx's analysis of society.20 Marx himself had begun this effort at developing a "science" of human behavior, Eastman pointed out, and the "essence of Marx's historical wisdom," and "one of the deepest and wisest intuitions in the history of genius," was Marx's own critique of ideology as the distortion and falsification of conscious thought by society and culture. In the spirit of Freud and natural science, Eastman thus reminded contemporary Marxists of the young Marx's own courageous defiance of man's need for myths and ultimate spiritual meaning: The abolition of religion, the illusory happiness of people, is a demand for their real happiness. The demand that one reject illusions about one's situation, is a demand that one reject a situation which has need of illusions. In effect, the American agnostic asked Marxists to abolish their own religion, to discard Hegel and reject the opium of a "theology" that will overcome alienation, and thus to accept a world without myths, a history without redemption, and a philosophy that has no need of illusions: That rejection of illusions-religious, moralistic, legal, political, aesthetic-is the immortal essence of Marx's contribution to the science of history, and to history itself. And if he did not succeed in rejecting also the illusions of philos- ophy, those who really esteem his life and his genius ought to carry out that process. Marx himself declared that philosophy, like law and politics and religion and art, is subject to an economic interpretation at the hands of science. But he also declared-and within a year of the same date-that Hegel wrote the true history of philosophy. Since Hegel's history of philosophy is a history of 'the self-developing reason,' a 'history of thought finding itself,' these two statements are directly contradictory, and we have to choose between them. We have to choose between Marxism as a Hegelian philosophy, and Marxism as a science whlich is capable of explaining such a philosphy.21 The one true revolutionary who chose "scientific" Marxism was Vladimir Ilich Lenin. It was the great Bolshevik leader, Eastman argued in the second part of his book, who rescued history from the false consolations of Hegel. Lenin's call for a "vanguard" of professional revolutionaries indicated that he did not regard revolution as the inevitable outcome of the laws of history 19 "It is impossible, once you have defined ideology as thinking which is unconscious of its motives, to let Marxism continue to hide its motives in an animistic phIlosophy of the universe. Marxism as a system of dialectical metaphysics is ideological, just as all metaphysics is, but it is certainly the tendency and true end of Marxism to become a science." Ibid., 88. 20 Eastman feared that unless Marxists assimilated Freuclianism, reactionaries would use it for their own purposes. When the French communist Charles Rappoport critically reviewed his book, Eastman responded: "Have you really got nothing to say about the problem of the relation between Marxism and modern psychology? Have you read Hendrik De Man's counter- revolutionary revision of Marxism on the basis of modern psychology? Do you really know what is going on in the intellectual world" Eastman to "Dear Comrade Holy Father," Dec.

Lenin also displayed great insight when lie defined the Bolshevik party in psychological rather than in class terms, choosing for his cadre those who possessed "purposive ideas" and an appropriate revolutionary "state of mind." Thus Lenin's What To Do22 denied the "assertion that the material elements of the world are automatically evolving toward socialism, and [the] assertion that the thoughts of socialists are a mere reflection of the process." The year 1917 dramatized both these truths, for Lenin demonstrated that the nature of political organization, and not the stage of economic or social development, was the decisive factor in revolution. Hence Lenin's grasp of the autonomy of politics, his "policy of sharp turns," showed that the October Revolution was a "violation of Hegelian-Marxism." Mtoreover, Lenin's effort to build socialism through the very political superstructure he created indicated that bolshevism did not evolve from the "ripening" of the "contradictions" of capitalism. "No person," stated Eastman as though he were replying to Lukacs, "could possibly declare that the political forms existing in Russia, and the ideas propagated by the Communist party, are a reflection of existing economic conditions. Never did a reflection put forth such gigantic efforts to produce its likeness in the object reflected.' 23 Eastman was fully aware that Lenin "recommended-but never began-'a systematic study of the Hegelian dialectic from the materialist point of view.'" But Lenin believed in "dialectical thinking" without defining it operationally so as to constrict his own experimental approach to knowledge. He learned from Hegel that "truth is always concrete" and from Marx that praxis is the criterion of knowledge and that "maximum of flexibility" is called for in "revolutionary momnents." Thus in his philosophical writings Lenin could believe that mnind "reflects" the "ordered movement of matter"; in his political actions, however, he behaved in a way that gave mind a "dynamic function" enabling him to interact with and act upon the move- ment of history.24 Eastman did not accuse Lenin of inconsistency, for the Bol- shevik leader rightly regarded philosophy as a "weapon of 'party struggle.' " Nor did ILenin's awareness that the "revolutionary will" resided in the revo- lutionist result in the arrogance of power. On the contrary, such ulnderstand- ing led to "an unusual mnoral responisibility." Here Eastman was not resort- ing to the precepts of religious or Kantian morality; nor was he proposing 22 Eastman inisisted that this title, anid nlot Wlhat Is To Re Done, was the true English equiva- lent to the heading of Lenin's 1902 organizational manifesto. 23 Eastman, Marx and Leniin, 141, 14963. In direct contrast to Eastmiian, Lukacs inisisted that the Leninist distinction between the "subjective factor" of lhistorical awareness (the party) an-d its object (the masses) could be reconciled by the proletariat, whose revolutionary activity not only "reflects" the processes of history but "tranisformi's" them.

Diggins a return to the revisionist belief in ethical socialism, a proposition of Eduard Bernstein's that Eastman dismissed as "absurd." Rather, he was suggesting that the revolutionist must be existentially aware that there is no escape from political morality by invoking the laws of history. "Whenever the word 'ought' has meaning, it will be affirmed that such a man ought to know his own motives, and be honest with those whom he leads." Lenin possessed this critical self-awareness when he demanded that the professional revolu- tionist be (in Lenin's words) "devoted," "heroic," "self-sacrificing," and "honest." Whereas Hegel relegated ultimate ethical issues to absolute "reason" and Marx to the end of "pre-history," Eastman saw in Leninism the possibility of restoring political responsibility to the mind and will of man. "There is no element in the Bolshevik tactics of Lenin more vitally important than the transparent purity of his motives, and his perfect in- tellectual honesty before the proletariat."25 With Leninism, then, the im- perative of revolutionary praxis is liberated from the deceptions of meta- physics; the true humanization of Marxism has begun. WHEN EASTMAN'S BOOK appeared in the United States in 1927, he had already been pretty well ostracized by the Communist Left. Party leader William Z. Foster had remarked two years earlier that Eastman had "killed himself in the Movement by his treatment of the Trotsky question"; and Mike Gold, soon to become editor of the New Masses, advised V. F. Calverton that Eastman, despite his "fine mind," was "a thorough bourgeoisies [sic] in esthetics" who preferred the "Platonic" way of life. Distrusted by party officials and disliked by self-appointed literary theoreticians, Eastman was dismissed as an amateur philosopher whose effort to assimilate Freud and Marx and expunge Hegel could not be taken seriously.26 Liberal intellectuals, although impressed by Eastman's lively style and anti-Hegelian witticisms, had serious reservations about the book. Eastman's celebration of Bolshevism disturbed the Nation reviewer, Henry Raymond Mussey, who noted that the exaltation of "will" was also characteristic of right-wing movements. Searching for an ethical position, T. V. Smitlh slhrewdly pointed out that Eastman had inadvertently denied Lenin the right to make a revolution, since the only Marxist justification for revolution was the presumption of its inevitability. On a similar note, the philosopher Horace Kallen warned Eastman that Leninism itself could become a "reli- gion" of empirical powver worship. In your "eagerness to escape the hypostasis of Hegelian dialectics," Kallen told Eastman, you are in "danger of hypostasizing organizing leadership as 'scientific.'

G. WVells, and Sigmund Freud. Continental Marxists who read the book (it was translated into French and Spanish) tended to respond, not surpris- ingly, according to their views of Freudian psychology on the one hand and Hegelian philosophy on the other. A Swedish writer hailed the work as the start of a "Copernican revolution" in making Marxism a science and in "laying the psychological basis of Marxian sociology." A young student at the Frankfurt am Main Institut fur Sozialforschung, wvhile doubting that East- man's scientific attitude could sustain a revolutionary temperament, none- theless welcomed the book as a relief from the tedious, abstract "fetishism" of metaphysical Marxism.28 The more seasoned communist thinkers, however, saw concealed in the bud of Eastman's argument the worm of revisionism. Charles Rappoport, a founder of the French Communist party, attacked the American "sophist" for failing to see that a Hegelian philosophy that re- placed the "immobilismo" of "Being for the eternal youth of Becoming, is eminently revolutionary." Georg Lukacs, the Hungarian philosopher who two years earlier had tried to reconcile Lenin and Marx, claimed Eastman was attempting to provide a theoretical platform for the "international Trotskyist" movement based upon "Anglo-American empiricist nonsense." With pompous sarcasm, Lukacs termed Eastman's description of the "prim- itive animism" of dialectics a "grand and indubitably original conclusion," and he felt it necessary to "renounce categorically" Eastman's psychological "additions" to Marxism as completely as the "contributions" of Max Adler. Unfortunately, the most learned Hegelian Marxist of the period never came to grips with Eastman's argument. Lukacs described Eastman's critique of dialectical materialism as a reflection of the "skepticism" that inflicts the "socially rootless, declasse" intellectual with corrosive doubt, yet he himself 2 Eastman, Love atnd Revolution, 461; J.

Pro- fessor Martin Jay, author of The Dialectical Imagination: A History of the Frankfurt School and the Institute for Social Research, 1923-I950 (Boston, 1973), informs me that Swede's letter "captures perfectly" the mood of the Institute for Social Research in its early years. "All this is the more gratifying to one," Swede told Eastman, "who has spent hours of exasperating argu- ment in a Marxist Institute with a younger generation setting down to an orthodox religioni and the worship of an iconographical literature, not to mention blackboards full of mathematical 'juggling with blocks of iooo k 4- 400 w of Marx's divisions of capital's functions, and the like. God! the hours I've spent listening to the debate of seminiarics anid studenit circles on the Hegelian dialektik, with not a single voice to point out that the problems can no longer be solved (if they ever were) by means of straw splitting philosophical coniceptions. Even the leader, faced with an audience of enthusiastic youth coniviniced that Relativity is a further installment of bourgeois ideology substituting fluctuating i(leas for Newton's absolute ma- terialism, that Freudianism and Bergsoniism are insidious attacks from the rear, and that the xvar can be waged with the sword in one hand and the 'Geschichte der Historiko-materialismus' in the other . . . is constanitly being brought up against the inherent contradictions in a Marxist M.I.H. and being forced to devise defenses against the logical coniclusion that we may sit with our arms folded and wait for the millennium to blossom from the dung of capitalist decay." Swvede told Eastman he had miienitionied his book to a colleague at the Institute, who replied, "Ah, yes. Just a journalist!"</page><page sequence="15">52 John P. Diggins remained skeptical of any attempt to "round out" orthodox Marxism with the ideas of Freud.29 Lukacs's criticisms would not have disturbed Eastman even had he been awvare of them. The "illusions of philosophy" wvere, after all, the curse of a European mind supposedly "expiring" before the advance of science and psychology. In America, the land of scientific intelligence, Eastman was proud enough to believe that only he understood the limitations of philo- sophical Marxism and vain enough to claim that he alone was "the Left opposition.' '30 Yet the champion of Lenin and Trotsky would soon meet his match. In 1928 a young American philosophy student was awarded a Guggenheim fellowship to travel to Gernmany in order to do research on Marx and to attend lectures on the latest currents of philosophical Marxism. Ironically, Eastman's antagonist was not to be a European metaphysician but a home-grown pragmatist-Sidney Hook. Eastman "bungled a great theme," Hook annotunced in the Modern Quzarterly in 1928. He interpreted Marx's views as "the confused, personal expression of a queer German-at once hard-headed (scientific) and quasi-religious-trying to liberate himself from the metaphysical super- stitions of a still queerer German-Hegel." The barbed shafts of the scrappy young philosopher sparked a sardonic debate that dragged on for five years, at wvhich point editor V. F. Calverton wearily stepped in and put an end to the affair so that two radicals would no longer "vent their spleen in public to the obscene enjoyment of the bourgeois world. "31 In the first phase of the debate (1928-30) three isstues divided Eastman and Hook. As a thorough rationalist and a student of Dewey, Hook quiestioned whether Freudianism would, as Eastman assumed, advance Marx- ian analysis. Freud not only made psychic reality prior to social reality, he formulated theories of human behavior that represented the "grossest viola- tion" of scientific method. The extent of determinism in Marx's philosophy wvas also at issue. Hook agreed with Eastman that the theory of historical materialism suffered because of the failure to distinguish necessary and suLfficient causes and because of the "oscillating between the anthropo- morphic and functional" conceptions of causation. Eastman erred, however, in not seeing that Marxism poses no "inevitable ends" but only "effects" and "objective tendencies." Eastman also failed to acknowledge that Marx, in 29 Charles Rappoport, "Les Soplhismes Revisionistes," L'Hurnanite, Dec. 5, 1926; Georg Lukacs, "Eine Marxkritik im Dienste des Trotzkismus," Die Internationale, 10 (1927): 189-9o; and Lukacs, Lenin: A Study on the Unity of His Thoughit (1924), tr.

It is rather man-real, living man who acts, possesses, and fights in everything." But the mnost troubling issue was the philosophy of Hegel. No one "swallows Hegel whole," Hook maintained, least of all Marx, who used dialectical reasoning not to establish a universal law but to illuminate social "contradictions." Eastman was "poking fun" at Hegel and "ridiculing" his "cumbrous language" instead of trying to pene- trate his Teutonic prose in order to perceive his great insights. Eastman, Hook advised, ought to read Hegel's Phanomenologie des Geistes "as punishment. "32 Despite his cavalier tone, Hook could not so easily dismiss Eastman's Mllarx and Lenin, and when he began to work out his own interpretation of Marxism he emphasized the "systematic contrasts" between Hegel and Marx in order to "close the door tight to attempts at 'Erganzung' Marx by Hegelianizing him."33 Yet Hook astutely perceived the important ele- ments of continuity as well as change betwveen Hegel and Marx. Accordingly, he set for himself two basic tasks: first, to demonstrate how Heegel and Marx shared a common belief in the centrality of process, movement, and development on the one hand, and a common opposition to Kantian ethical idealism, sensationist empiricism, and bourgeois social atomism on the other; and second, to explain how Hegel and Marx were "utterly opposed in substance and spirit" regarding the role of philosophy, the function of mind, and the meaning of the dialectic. Thus against Hegel's philosophy of speculation and reflection (which arrives "too late"), Hook contrasted Marx's philosophy of praxis and transformation; and against Hegel's theory of mind as the vessel of logically necessary truths, he contrasted Marx's view of mind as the instrument of social action. As for the dialectic, Hook was certain that once Marx's version was stripped of its Hegelian termi- nology, one could grasp its meaning in its application. The dialectic enabled Marx to appreciate the structural interrelationships of society and to perceive the causal factors of social change in the processes of contradiction and resolution. Significantly, Hook pointed out similarities between dialectical thinking and "instrumentalist logic" in which knowledge expresses itself in practical activity arising from the conflict between human needs and social conditions. Moreover, Marxism and pragmatism shared a common criterion of verification. As a "method" of thinking, Marxism must therefore be considered "a huge judgment of practice, in Dewey's sense of the phrase, 32 Hook, "Marxism, Metaphysics, and Modern Science," 390-94. 33 Sidney Hook, "From Hegel to Marx," Modern Quarterly, 6 (Summer 1932): 33-43. Hook expressed indebtedness to the work of Korsch and Lukacs, though he believed that Korsch underestimated the difficulties in making the "formal aspects" of Marx's thought "practical," and that Lukacs linked "Marx up-unfortunately much too closely-with the stream of German classical philosophy."

Diggins and its truth or falsity (instrumental adequacy) is an experimental matter. Believing in it and acting upon it helps to make it true or false."34 As epistemology, Marxism and American pragmatism did have something in common, and had Hook confined himself to treating the dialectic as a "method" that sensitizes the mind to social antinomies, he would have avoided what Eastman called the "metaphysical pretensions" of philosophy. But never quite able to separate form from content, Hook was tempted to see meaning as well as method in the dialectic. Whatever the validity of his claims, Hook clearly went beyond the limitations of instrumentalist knowledge when he maintained that the "dialectical principle explains how human beings, although conditioned by society, are enabled through activity to change both themselves and society"; when he asserted that "in Marx as well as in Hegel the dialectic is, so to speak, the philosophical rhythms of conscious life"; when he argtued that Marxism is "a 'partial' or 'partisan' theory without ceasing to be an objective expression of the interests of the proletariat"; and when he declared that Marx offered the clear choice be- twNeen "communism" and "barbarism." Despite his Deweyite languag,e, Hook the revolutionist assumed the stance of a Jamesian radical, a "Marxist of the heart" who was not reluctant to invoke the will to believe and to act in order to "make" communism come true. Marx's philosophy of history, Hook declared in a moment of Roycean lyricism, "fuses the logic of analysis wvith the poetry of passion."35 It was this fusion, this systematic effort to synthesize objective description with subjective desire, that had earlier seduced Eastman the poet into declaring hiimself a Nlarxist. Now the whole effort seemed psychologically uiniderstandable and therefore plhilosophically unacceptable.

Why must Hook, Eastman complained, characterize Marx's philosophy "as 'naturalistic activism,' 'social behaviorism,' 'revolutionary voluntarism,' 'voluntaristic humanism,' 'voluntaristic realism,' 'activistic atheism,' 'critical historicism,' 'realistic evolutionary naturalismn,' 'Aristotelianism saturated with temporalism,' and other long-tailed horny epithets very disheartening to a man who is not accustomed to take his vacations in the library." The crux of the issue was not, as Hook implied, whether Marxism could be made compatible with the principles of American pragmatism. Although com- mitted to scientific methodology, Eastman never had much regard for the pragmatic definition of truth, which he sensed had more to do with power and control than with knowledge or wisdom.36 And while Dewey may have carried over from Hegel the ideal of identifying theoretical and practical consciousness, Dewey never studied Marx and did not deduce the idea of class struggle from the concept of the dialectic. Nor was historical in- evitability the issue, for Hook eschewed the deterministic elements of Marxism: socialism was a probability, not a necessity. The crux of the issue was the problem of the relation of mind to the external world. How is reality to be perceived? Can the scientific mind-as opposed to the philo- sophic or poetic mind, which rely upon reflection and intuition-identify the perception of reality with reality itself? Eastman returned to the "Theses on Feuerbach" for the answer, and here he seized upon the kernel of Marx's advice: The chief fault of all materialism heretofore (including Feuerbach's) is that object, reality, sensibility (Sinnlichkeit), is conceived only under the form of object or of contemplation; not as human-sensible activity, Praxis, not sub- 36 Both Hook and Eastman had studied under Dewey at Columbia University. "But I studied under Dewey," Eastman insisted, "not as a disciple of his pragmatist or instrumentalist philoso- phy, but always with a feeling that I stood 'to the left' of him-not only politically, but in the direction of scientific skepticism." Eastman had begun a thesis un(ler Dewey criticizing prag- matism from this viewpoint, "and I never receded from that thesis. Its bright point, I remember, was the rather impertinent remark that, 'if "the meaning of an idca is its results in action," then the meaning of pragmatism is to resign your chairs in philosophy.' " Eastman, "A Master Magician," Modern Monthly, 7 (June 1933): 290-93; see also Eastman's affectionate portrait of Dewey, "The Hero as Teacher," in Heroes I Have Known, 274-321. Eastman had urged Dewey to preside over a debate between himself and Hook. Although Dewey declined, stat- ing he did not "know enough Marx," he was willing to write the following statement for the possible reissue of Eastman's book: "Mr. Eastman has not only disentangled Hegelian metaphysics in a masterly fashion from Marx's fundamental conitribution to thotught; he has done much more by exhibiting the corro-ding animism which afflicts much philosophic, economic, and psychological writing even today." Dewey to Eastmiian, Feb. 7, 1933, Eastman Papers. See also Dewey's "Why I Am Not a Communist," in The Meaning of Marxism: A Symposium (New York, 1934), 86-go. Bertrand Russell also discerned epistemological similarities between Marxism and pragmatism and, like Eastman, remained skeptical of both philosophies. See Russell, "Dialectical Materialism," in Patrick Gardiner, ed., Theories of History (New York, 1959), 285-95; and "Why I Am Not a Communist," in The Meaning of Marxism, 83-85. But Russell, who had from the beginning criticized Bolshevism along with Marxism, had equally strong doubts about Eastman's praise of Lenin.

Hence the active side developed in opposition to materialism abstractly from idealism-abstractly, because idealism naturally did not recognize sensible activity as such. Feuerbach wants objects of sense reality distinguished from objects of thought, but he does not conceive of human activity itself as objective activity. As Eastman interpreted the passage, Marx was asserting that subject and object are identical, that the activity of the human mind and the motion of the material world are "the same thing, and that that thing is to be con- ceived subjectively as practical human sensible activity." To see man as an objective being who conceives subjectively, to regard human activity itself as objective activity, comes close to asserting that what is perceived is identi- cal to how it is conceived. This advice seemed to Eastman to be a reversion to the idealist fallacy of attributing reality to the knowing subject. Marx assumed he had saved the "rational kernel" and eliminated the "mysti- cal shell" in Hegel's philosophy. When Marx, however, made material activity the agency of spiritual realization, he inverted Hegel's ontology only to absorb his teleology. Thus, however it might be clothed in the language of materialism, philosophic Marxism would remain for Eastman a form of "animism," an attempt to read "subjectively" the ideal into the real in order to identify human purposes and desires with historical proc- esses and developments.37 Hook had tried to resolve the metaphysical problems of Marxism in somewhat the same way that Dewey had tried to resolve the metaphysical problems of pragmatism,38 but Eastman could accept neither philosophy. Marxism and pragmiatism demonstrated that knowledge was action and power, but neither could prove to Eastman that the ultimate nature of reality would be anything more than a projection of alienated man's need to find meaning in a meaningless universe. Eastman believed in "progress," and he believed that Lenin's great achievement showed that the world could be improved by acting upon it and transforming it. But Hegelian Marxism could not overcome the acute tensions that lay at the heart of Eastman's esthetic sensibility: the dualisms between moral vision and factual description, between mind and object, pur- pose and process, desire and reality.39 To Eastman history would remain a 37 Max Eastman, The Last Stand of Dialectical Materialism: A Study of Sidney Hook's Marxism (New York, 1934), 7-18, passim; "Marxism: Science or Philosophy?"

After quoting from a Communist manifesto summoning the intellectual to establish an "Interniational of Proletarian World Literature," Eastman warned: "In other words art and poetry, having with difficulty escaped from their bondage to religion, must now enter into bondage in politics. They must be regarded as subordinate to a single practical enterprise. No great or consecrated poet or artist in the world could sincerely sub- scribe to such a manifesto. Poetry and art may contribute vitally to purposive effort, but they are in their essence and definition distinct from it and independent of it. Their interest is in experience and not purpose, in being and not becoming. The only ultimate distinction which</page><page sequence="20">Getting Hegel out of History 57 problem for which philosophy offered no solution. This "doctrinal crisis" in Marxism made Eastman the first major infidel of the Old Left, the first radical philosopher to question the philosophical assumptions of radical- ism.40 Yet, curiously, Eastman's skepticism was itself based on the illusion that radical man can live without radical illusions. He demanded that Marxism divorce itself from Hegelianism in order to acquire a self-critical understanding of its own myths. Such a demand is a psychological if not a theoretical impossibility. A Marxist need not believe in man, but he must believe in the meaning of history illuminated by philosophy. Eastman could believe in Lenin and revolution, love and sexual liberation ("lust is sacred"), the joy of living, and nothing more. THE EASTMAN-HOOK DIALOGUE fascinated some American radicals and frustrated others. Eastman's refutation of Hegelian Marxism seemed to identify him with Bernstein and revisionism, yet his continued espousal of Leninism made him a staunch Bolshevik. At the same time Hook's defense of Marxism identified him as an authentic revolutionary, but his increas- ing doubts about the principle of the "dictatorship of the proletariat" made him appear less a Leninist than a Kautskyist. To find out who was left of whom, several independent radicals, especially those connected with the newly formed American Workers party, tried unsuccessfully to bring East- man and Hook together for what Max Shachtman amusingly called "The Debate of the Colossi."'41 Meanwhile, from Prinkipo, Turkey, Leon T'rotsky had been following the divisive affair. Although he was critical of Hook's effort to strip Marxism of its doctrinal significance and reduce it to a "method," Trotsky was more upset by Eastman's wholesale assault on Hegel and the dialectic. He warned The Militant that Eastman was "carrying out a systematic fight against materialist dialectics, the philosophical foundation of Marxism," and he advised Calverton and the Modern Quarterly that Eastman was embarking upon a "retrograde adventure.' '42 Trotsky's attack stung East- man. During these years he had been helping Trotsky publish his books can be made between poetic and practical langutage is that poetic language pauses to realize the existing nature of things mentioned, practical language merely indicates them for the purposes of action and adjustment" (Marx and Lenin, 183). Eastman's distinction between poetry as the realm of "being" and politics as the realm of "becoming" seemed to Hook a false dichotomy made by one who possessed "an intense animus against metaphysics [which] is very childlike." The distinction itself, Hook maintained, "is metaphysics, and bad metaphysics at that."

What distressed Eastman, however, was not Trotsky's ingratitude but his willingness to condemn Marx and Lenin before he had studied it (Trotsky admitted he had "only turned over the pages").43 Although in 1940 Trotsky would write a defense of dialectical logic, in the early thirties it was obvious that the Bolshevik hero had not pondered the epistemological issues that Eastman had raised." Indeed, at times Trotsky's own argument regarding the primacy of revolutionary "will" seemed to echo the very case Eastman had been trying to make in divorcing Lenin the revolutionist from from Marx the Hegelian.45 In the mid-thirties Eastman turned from the philosophical implications of Marxism to the cultural implications of Stalinism. Combining his knowledge of recent literary trends with his previous training in esthetics, he produced two books that challenged the cult of proletarian realism and brought to light the fate of artistic freedom in the Soviet Union.46 To the Stalinist Left these works represented the final acts of betrayal. Since the early twenties Eastman had been suspected by Moscow of being a counterrevolutionary and even a "British spy" for his publication of Lenin's "Testament" and his support of Trotsky. Now he was denounced as a "filthy and deliberate liar" (Mike Gold), a Philistine and hypocrite who "defoul[s] everything he touches" (Joshua Kunitz), and a "gangster of the pen" (Stalin).47 Then in 1938, during the height of the Moscow trials, the Daily Worker head- lined his name as an accomplice in the Trotsky "conspiracy." His old friend Carlo Tresca-an anarchist who had also been branded an "enemy" for publicizing the Kremlin's alleged involvement in the disappearance of Juliet Poyntz and the Stalinist responsibility for the murder of Andres Nin- advised Eastman to sue the Daily Worker for libel. Eastman did so, not to 43 Eastman to Robert LaFollette, June 7, 1933; Eastman to William C.

(Interview with Burnham, June 1i, 1971.) Burnham was willing to defend Marxism but not dialectical materialism, which he saw as "only a disguised form of monistic objective idealism" that falsely guaranteed the inevitability of socialism. See John West [James Burnham], "Max Eastman's Straw Man," The New International, 2 (1935): 220-25. 45 "It is necessary to remember that Marxism both interprets the wvorld and teaches how to change it.

Thus the insults of former comrades and the loss of old friends left him distraught, not only by the slanders of the Stalinists but by the "massacre of honesty and political clear thinking by our famous 'liberals.' " Yet the isolation of Eastman was a prelude to his vindication. For although the popular-front mentality made him a pariah to communists and fellow-traveling liberals, he could take some satisfaction from the intellectual countercurrents that began to surface around 1938. The esteemed philosopher Dewey now began to address himself to Marxism and to articulate criticisms that resembled Eastman's earlier analysis. Doubting that methods of political action could be "deduced" from a "fixed law" of social development, Dewey questioned whether means and ends could be "read out of" the presumed laws of society or nature. "Orthodox Marxism," Dewey observed, "shares with orthodox religionism and with traditional idealism the belief that human ends are interwoven into the very texture of existence-a conception inherited presumably from its Hegelian origins." As the decade drew to a close, American Trotskyists like James Burnham and Max Shachtman would also challenge the validity of Hegelian Marxism. "Comrade Trotsky," wrote Burnham just before resigning from the So- cialist Workers party, "you have absorbed too much of Hegel, of his mono- lithic, his totalitarian, vision of a block universe, in which every part is re- lated to every other part, in which everything is relevant to everything else, where the destruction of a single grain of dust means the annihila- tion of the Whole.' 49 More telling were Sidney Hook's second thoughts on the dialectic in particular and on Marxism in general. Having investigated the writings of the nineteenth-century Left Hegelians, Hook perceived disparities and distortions between the historical materialism of Marx and the dialectical materialism of Engels. In a brilliant philosophical analysis of Engels, "Dialectic and Nature," Hook now acknowledged that the concept of the dialectic had been appropriated uncritically from Hegel's speculative ontology and erroneously accorded universal status in mathematics, physics, chem- istry, biology, and geology, as well as in history and philosophy. As a con- stitutive principle inherent in every conceivable aspect of the universe, the dialectic functioned more as "mythology" than methodology.50 Several years 48 Eastman, Love and Revolution, 627. 49 Eastman to Calverton, Mar. 4, 1937, Calverton Papers; John Dewey, "Means and Ends," The New International, 4 (1938): 232-33; James Burnham, "Science and Style," reprinted in Leon Trotsky, In Defense of Marxism (Against the Petty-bourgeois Opposition) (New York, 1965), 196-97; Trotsky to Burnham, Jan. 7, 1940, Trotsky Archives. 50Sidney Hook, "Dialectic and Nature," The Marxist Quarterly, i (1937): 253-84; "Dialectic in Social and Historical Inquiry," Journal of Philosophy, July 6, 1939, pp. 365-78. Eastman applauded Hook's reconsiderations and described "Dialectic and Nature" as a "brilliant study" (Eastman, "Trotsky's Use of 'Dialectic,'" MS, n.d., Eastmiian Papers). Hook, in turn, welcomed Eastman's writings on Soviet culture and his effort to set straight the record on John Reed (Hook to Calverton, Aug. 26, 1936, Calverton Papers). Observing Hook "quietly changing</page><page sequence="23">6o John P. Diggins later Hook went on to juxtapose Lenin, the "event-making man," to the principle of historical determinism in order to demonstrate some of the same weaknesses in Marx's philosophy of history that Eastman had disclosed fifteen years earlier.5' Even more encouraging was the support Eastman received from the great- est literary mind of his generation-Edmund Wilson. In 1937 Wilson dug up a copy of Eastman's out-of-print Marx and Lenin and found it to be "the best critical thing I've read on this philosophical aspect of Marxism." Even though the book, Wilson informed Eastman, "suffers a little" from its ab- stract and negative tone and hence its lack of dramatic style, "it would have been a good thing if people had read it a few years ago when everybody was going crazy about Marxism." Wilson had studied Eastman's book in connec- tion with his own forthcoming work on the intellectual history of European socialism. "What I have written," he told John Dos Passos in 1938, "will fill the Marxists with horror." That fall he published a section of his manu- script, "The Myth of the Dialectic," in the Partisan Review. The editors wanted to have Hook, Burnham, Bertram D. Wolfe, and Meyer Shapiro re- ply, but, as William Phillips observed, these writers were no longer com- mitted to the issue and thus there was little chance of getting "a real loo1 dialectical materialist."52 Two years later, during the period of the nonag- gression pact, Wilson's magisterial To the Finland Station appeared. Here he described Eastman's book as a "remarkable study" to which he owed "a special debt." Wilson's analysis, although far more comprehensive in treating the complex development of Marxism, essentially followed Eastman's cri- tique of the dialectic as a "religious myth" and his celebration of Lenin as the revolutionary who turned ideas into flesh and made intellectual history the study of action as well as thought.53 his mind" about dialectical philosophy, some wondered whetlher Eastman's writings had any influence on Hook's "most startling" shift of attitude (Margaret Johlns to Eastman, Dec. 7, 1938; Alfred Bingham to Eastman, Nov. 4, 1938, Eastman Papers). It is doubtful that Hook would allow himself to be influenced by a part-time philosopher like Eastman. Perhaps the one thinker who impressed Hook in the thirties was Karl Korsch, whose lectures he had attendedl in Berlin. Hook tried to get Korsch to participate in various American symposia on Marxism, paid for his subscription to the Modern Quarterly, and sent him his own articles on Hegel and Marx (Hook to Calverton, July 14, 1934, Calverton Papers). In the late thirties Korsclh, now living in the United States, reconsidered his earlier synthesis of Marxism and German idealism and stressed the differences between Marx and Hegel (Korsch, "Leading Principles of Marxism," The Ma:rxist Quarterly, 1 [1937]: 356-78). In Karl Marx (London, 1938), he sought to convert Marxism into a theory of revolutionary practice and free historical materialism from the contemplative spell of Hegel-somewhat the same approach Eastman advocated a decade earlier. Unfortunately, even though Calverton urged Eastman to read Korsch's articles and books, Eastman felt there was nothing more to be learned from a German Marxist phi- losopher (Eastman to Calverton, Feb. 28, 1939, Calverton Papers). 51 Sidney Hook, The Hero in History: A Study in Limitation and Possibility (New York, 1943). 52 Wilson to Eastman, Oct. 5, 1938, Eastman Papers; Wilson to Dos Passos, Apr. 27, 1938, Dos Passos Papers, Alderman Library, University of Virginia; Phillips to Wilson, Aug. 31, 1938; Wilson to Dwight Macdonald, Sept. io, 1943, Partisan Review^ Files, Rutgers University Library. 53 Edmund Wilson, To the Finland Station: A Sttudy in the Writing and Acting of History (Anchor ed.; Garden City, N.Y., n.d.), 179-98, 372-402. Wilson, however, was less certain than Eastman that Lenin could be appreciated apart from Marxism. Although Bolshevism may</page><page sequence="24">Getting Hegel out of History 61 Thus the year 1940 saw the appearance of three important American books that rejected the dialectic as either a disguised theology, a pseudologic of organic totality, or a Phythagorian allusion suggesting the insurgent power of a phallic symbol: Eastman's Marxism is it Science, Hook's Reason, Social Myth and Democracy, and Wilson's To the Finland Station. The following year an erudite treatise was published that scarcely raised an eye- brow among America's disenchanted Marxists-Herbert Marcuse's Reason and Revolution: Hegel and the Rise of Social Theory. Here the German exile scholar attempted to explicate Hegel to the Anglo-Saxon world, to rescue German idealism from its perversions in the writings of Italian and German fascists, to present the dialectic as a revolutionary concept that retains the tension between the "is" and the "ought," between what is im- mediately given and what is ultimately real, and thus to offer a radical "critical theory" of existing society. But to most Old Left intellectuals in America, Hegel's philosophy was too ambiguous, too full of unresolved con- tradictions. At once a philosophy of negation and reconciliation, Hegelian- ism seemed to comprehend everything metaphysical and explain nothing political.54 Curiously, the German exile scholars at the Institute for Social Research in New York did not bother to respond to the American critique of Hegel and dialectical reasoning. Although they had been aware of the debates be- not have been the historical actualization of the dialectic, Lenin identified his deeds with the course of history just as Marx had identified his doctrines with the logic of philosophy. This raises the question whether Lenin could have, psychologically as well as philosophically, succeeded in making a social revoluition happen without the conviction that he embodiecl the will of Marxism. Although Wilson then avoided the issue (but later returned to it indirectly in Patriotic Gore [Galaxy e(d., New York, 1966], xvi-xix), a powerfuil case for the argument had been made earlier by Waldo Frank: "There is, moreover, Ino contradiction between the philosophy of Marx and the metho(lology of Lenin. Mr. Eastman (like most enemies of philosophy) is so simplistic that he cannot conciliate the concept of historical necessity (Marxism) with the necessity, within that niecessity, of human will to determinie its metho(ds of action, to choose, to fight and to create (Leninism). The dynamism of Lenin as an enginieer lies precisely in his being nurtured by the Welt'anschauung of Marx, his intuiition of life as an organism with an internal direction. Mr. Eastman, it seemns to me, is unable to understand Lenin because he rejects wvhat is profound and true in Maix. There is no antithesis between a social engineer and a prophet" (Modern Quar-terly, 5 [Winter 1930-31]: 448). To Eastman, however, whether or not Lenin was acting in the name of Marxism provedc nothing about the epistemological claims of Marxian philosophy, which demands that theory and practice be organically related. Eastman was an "enemy of philosophy" only to the extetnt that those who regarded themselves as philosophers failed to answer their own questions. "It seems to me," he wrote to another one of his critics who challenge(d him on the same issuie, "that this philosophical position of Lenin's ignores the essential problem whicih it preten(ds to solve. The problem about determinism and free will is: How to reconcile the asstumption of the mind that everytlhing is determined with its assumption that by knowinig these deteiminations, it can itself dletermine the future. Neither Engels nor Lenin approaches this problem, andl the reason is, I think, that they are not intereste(d in philosophical problems as such, but mer-ely in arriving at a practical, working attitude of mind. . . . In short, if you will think longer about it, I think you will see that you cannot possibly attribute to mind-and that means will, thought, and feeling-a dynamic effect uponl the ordered movement of matter without assuming that, at least wvhere mind arises, thele is an indetermination in that movement" (Eastman to Peter BerlinruLt, Sept. i6, 1933, Eastman Papers). 54See Sidney Hook's severe review of Reason and Revolution in the New Republic, July 21, 1941, pp. 90-91.</page><page sequence="25">62 John P. Diggins tween Eastman and Hook, the Frankfurt philosophers and sociologists dis- missed the affair as an extension of the "positivist emasculation of Marxism" that had begun in Europe, a subject to which Max Horkheimer had fully addressed himself a decade earlier. This attitude raises a difficult question in intellectual history: what is the relationship of philosophical ideas to politi- cal positions?55 Sidney Hook believed there was a clear relationship. Although certainly not a positivist, Hook did tend to associate the empirical, pragmatic habits of thought with progressive and radical tendencies, and the Hegelian, idealist modes of knowledge with conservative and authoritarian move- ments.56 This distinction may collapse before the vagaries of European intellectual history, but in twentieth-century America it did make sense in view of Dewey's and James's reaction to the Hegelian idealism of Josiah Royce and the resistance to scientific thought by conservative intellectuals who defended Southern agrarianism, classical humanism, or Roman Catholi- cism. With Max Eastman, however, we have an intellectual who came to radicalism by way of poetry. As a lyrical rebel of the Greenwich Village generation, he was aware of the radical tradition of Kantian and Hegelian idealism that had inspired Whitman and the American Transcendentalists. Yet while poetic idealism could inspire an indictment of society, it could not offer the basis for analyzing and changing society. Poetry, like philosophy, afforded only the "emotional realization" of ideas. "Why not say," Eastman remnarked in reference to Marx's dictum, "'Poets have sting the world . . . painters have painted the world; the thing is to change it.' " Only science enabled man to transform the world in order to realize the transcendent ideas born of poetry or philosophy. However, science also spelled the end of philosophical idealism. With Veblen Eastman believed that science would mnake man less "anthropomorphic," free him of the "animism" and "super- stition" with which nineteenth-century thinkers had reified metaplhysical ideas like natural law and thereby rendered man-made conventions beyond the control of man.57 This radical change in American social thought meant that history would now be studied in naturalistic terms in which there would be no place for the operation of disembodied forces, immaterial laws, or teleological systems. The American revolt against German idealism-most pronounced in the works of Dewey and Veblen-appears somethinig quite 55 Interview witli Herbert Marcuse, Sept. 14, 1972; John P.

His "subliminated materialism" betrayed the spirit of Hegel in the language of Darwinism, while his theory of class struggle "proceeds on the grounds of the hedonistic calculus" that is "closer to Bentham than to Hegel." "Animism" was also a favorite description of Veblen's.

The Frankfurt scholars' case against positivism was that its methodology isolated and compartmentalized phenomena, treated all forms of social existence as ontologically permanent, focused on factual data at the cost of ignoring normative ideals, and hence succumbed to "uncritical objectivism."59 This description hardly applied to Eastman, who originally wanted to make Marxism "scientific" in order to better assert its power of transformation: Mind's task is not to blur the real With mimic tints from an ideal, But to change one into the other by an act.50 Eastman believed that Lenin, not Marx, carried out this task, and his ad- miration of Lenin is perhaps best understood in light of Veblen's respect for the "matter of fact" engineer as the revolutionist of the future. Whatever "scientific" Marxism implied, the Old Left's repudiation of the dialectic does reveal a great deal about the bias against formal metaphysics in American social thought. Long before most other writers, Eastman cor- rectly perceived that any debate over the meaning of Marxism would iulti- mately be a debate over the meaning and validity of Hegelianism. His contribution to the critique of dialectical materialism would gain consider- able recognition in British scholarship, particularly in the work of Sir Isaiah Berlin, R. N. Carew-Hunt, and Raymond Postgate.6' In America East- man's limited influence waned further in the forties and fifties as he moved to the right and supported the cold war and defended free enterprise. Yet between the demise of the Old Left and the rise of the New Left, East- man's legacy was not completely forgotten. Indeed, Mario Savio, a leader of the Berkeley Free Speech movement, once declared: "A lot of Hegel got 58 John Dewey, Germani Philosophy and Politics (New York, 1915); Thorstein Vcblen, Imt- perial Germany and the Industrial Revolution (New York, 1915); see also Morton White, Social Thought in America: The Revolt Against Formalism (Beacon ed.; Boston, 1957), 147-60. 50i Max Horkheimer, Critical Theory: Selected Essays, tr.

See Love and Revolution, 127, 200-(3. 61 In Karl Marx: His Life and Environiment (Galaxy ed.; New York, 1963), Sir Isaiah Berlin called Eastman's Marxism is it Science "an essay of characteristic brilliance by this sharp and original critic and excellent writer, bitterly condemned as a heretic by orthodox Conmmunists" (p. 287).

Diggins mixed up with Marx's notion of history. Max Eastman pointed this out. The dialectic was a way in which Marx made the course of history coincide with his unconscious desires."62I But the skepticism of Savio could hardly pro- vide the emotional foundation on which left-wing movements are built. Nor could any New Left student who had read Eastman dare carry his psycho- logical analysis to its logical conclusion. For when the young radicals of the ig6os discovered a "new" Marx, they, too, may have been making his- tory "coincide" with desire. Once Marxism itself can be analyzed as an ideology, even radical self-consciousness may be seen as an objective illu- sion. There is no end to this mode of analysis when ideas are reduced to motives and thought treated as the rationalization of wish; no one is safe from the accusation of "false consciousness," least of all the accusers. The Old Left may have needed to believe in Marxism as a solution to the con- tradictions of capitalism, but the New Left needed to believe in it as an answer to the paradoxes of alienation. Thus the young radicals seized upon Marx's essentially Hegelian concepts of "estrangement," "alienation," and "reification" in order to turn a predicament of the human condition into a platform for social emancipation. After the belated discovery of the Economico-Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844, the meaning of Marxism would never be quite the same. The crucial distinctions that Eastman drew between Marxism and German idealism would now be reintegrated by the logic of perfect contradiction as Hegel reappeared in America as though the owl of Minerva were rising with the counterculture.63 The moral and political idealism of an older radical social movement or school of thought is often rediscovered by a future generation as a source of inspiration. A study of the deradicalization of a Left intelligentsia, how- ever, suggests that the skepticism of one generation can seldom be trans- mitted to another generation.64 Not even Eastman's rhapsodic, life-celebrat- ing, "affirmative skepticism" would be adequate for the young radicals of the sixties, who wanted "relevance" and not the lessons of experience from the authorities of failure. Thus only those of Eastman's generation who had followed his career could sufficiently appreciate his role as the critical con- science of the Stalinist era. This appreciation was perhaps best expressed 62 Quoted in Lewis S. Feuer, The Conflict of Generation: The Character and Significance of Student Movements (New York, 1969), 503. 63 For a criticism of the Marxist explanation of alienation, see John P. Diggins, "Thoreau, Marx, and the 'Riddle' of Alienation," Social Research, 29 (1972): 571-98. New Left philosophers in the sixties were engaged in a determined effort to refute Eastman and Hook, restore the dialectic to nature, and reunite Marx and Hegel.

Reviewing Eastman's Marxism is it Science and Stalin's Russia and the Crisis of Socialism, he praised the "natural genius" and "toughness" of a thinker who, like Trotsky, had been a hero to one generation of radical intellectuals only to become a heretic to another generation. Characteristically, Wilson found much to criticize in Eastman because he found much more to admire: Max Eastman's comprehension of the modern world is limited in certain re- spects, and this is probably another reason for the recent neglect of his work. As his novel [Venture, 1926] is quite non-naturalistic, so his discussion of the Soviet Union and of the general situation of the West does not include an adequate picture of economic and social conditions. It is strange that this student of Marxism should never have learned from Marx what is certainly most valid in his system: the class analysis of historical happenings. Max Eastman, as Philip Rahv has pointed out, tends to talk as if the fallacies of Marxism had by them- selves wrecked the Leninist revolution, and is not interested in finding out how the development of social forces has affected the application of ideas. But though it is true tlhat he thinks mainly in terms of psychological motivations, of philo- sophical and moral positions, his criticisms along these lines has, nevertheless, proved extremely salutary at a time when people were trusting to arrangements of statistical figures to demonstrate the rights and wrongs of History without being able to smell the corpses in the Lubyanka or to take stock of what was lhealthy at home. Max Eastman has continued to perform for us the same function that he did in the first World War: that of the winter log that floats in the swimming-pool and prevents the concrete from cracking by itself taking the pressure of the ice.65 IT IS TEMPTING esthetically to use Wilson's quote as a coda on which to end this study. But there are several reasons why it is necessary to continue. First of all, it would be wrong to conclude, as Wilson and Rahv suggested, and as the discussion up to now might imply, that Eastman's writings on Marxism amounted to "only" a study of ideas, a self-referential discourse on a disembodied metaphysical theory, and hence an abstract philosophical critique of no real significance because it gives no attention to "economic and social conditions." On the contrary, rather than an academic exercise in epistemology, Eastman's writings became far more important to the study and interpretation of contemporary history. Indeed, the debate over dialec- tical reasoning in the thirties reached its political climax in the historical issue of Stalinism. This unparalleled political phenomenon has continued to this day to intrigue and baffle scholars of all ideological persuasions. To the Old Left in general, and to Eastman, Hook, and Burnham in particular, the problem of understanding Stalinism became almost the problem of understanding history itself. For in the writings of their former hero, Leon Trotsky, the concept of the dialectic descended, as it were, from the meta- physical heights of pure philosophical discussion and entered history as a 65 Edmund Wilson, "Max Eastman in 1941," Classics and Comm?ercials (New York, 1950), 68-69.</page><page sequence="29">66 John P. Diggins real, vital idea whose validity was manifesting, itself in the "contradictions" of the Soviet bureaucracy. By examining, briefly the manner in which this problem was debated, we can not only see the curious interplay of philo- sophical ideas and the interpretation of historical reality, we can perhaps also begin to understand better the intellecttual origins of what came to be called, misleadingly I believe, "anti-commtnism."66 For the generation of the 193os the greatest analysis of Stalinism from the perspective of economic and social conditions could be found in Trotsky's The Revolution Betrayed, a work that Eastman translated and praised highly as a "prodigious feat of intellect." To the readers of Harper's Eastman showed just how sensitive he was to "social forces" when he described Trotsky's brilliant mode of explanation: The amount of free and fluid judgment he achieves within the framework of a rationalistic metaphysics is amazing-a tribute to his dexterity and the ingenuity of old Hegel. His sustained sense of human society as a process rather than a thing-the real wisdom concealed under the cant about "dialectic" -is also admirable. I find much truth too in his concrete demonstrations of the results of Russia's backwardness, and much empirical good sense in his insistence uDon the interdependence of the nations in any basic economic change they make. The idea of capitalist encirclement and the war danger-used by Stalinists to "blackmail the intellectuals and keep down the workers," as James T. Farrell truly says-is used by Trotsky with honesty and a just sense of its significance.67 Nevertheless, Eastman remained unconvinced by Trotsky's essential thesis- that Russia's isolation as a proletarian power and her "backward technic of production" accounted for the degeneration of the Revolution and the emergence of Stalinism. Such an explanation ignored fundamental prob- lems of human behavior that could hardly be dismissed as mere "survivals in a backward country of a 'petty-bourgeois psychology.'" Above all, con- fronted with the mutation of Marxist sociology by the unexpected growth of Soviet bureaucracy, Trotsky refused to reconsider his Marxist philosophy of history. Hence Eastman questioned what XVilson felt he should have learned most from Marx: "the class analysis of historical happenings." It was pre- cisely this obsolete analysis that could not fully explain Stalinism, a phenom- enon that developed out of novel historical conditions in which Marx's emphasis on property relations as the root of power no longer determined class behavior. Among American and European intellectuals, the problem of Soviet bureaucracy led to a search for the hidden defect in the whole history of communist theory and practice, the "original sin," as Isaac Deut- scher ironically put it, from which Stalinism took its malevolent birth.68 Hook and Victor Serge located it in the centralizing tendencies of Lenin's theory of party dictatorship; Will Herberg and Bertram D.

The immediate issue between Eastman and Trotsky, however, was not what had destroyed the Revolu- tion but what would save it, not the social conditions of backwardness that plagued Russia but the philosophical ideas that were still being invoked to restore Russia to her original revolutionary course. Insofar as Trotsky claimed to embody the heritage of Leninism, Eastman could rightly argue that in an ultimate sense it was indeed the "fallacies of Marxism" that prevented Trotsky from both understanding the historical significance of Stalinism and offering a political answer to it. Trotsky's theory of Stalinism contains a historical explanation within which is embedded a philosophical solution. Drastically simplified, Trotsky's interpretation held that Stalinism must be seen as a temporary "Bonapartist" political phenomenon, an "episodic relapse" that, like the Thermidorean phase of the French Revolution, would be undermined by its own "social contradictions" and ultimately destroyed by the proletariat as it rises again to resume the second act of the unfinished October Revolution. Although he would modify aspects of his theory and revise his timetable in response to events, Trotsky never doubted that Stalin's Russia stood suspended at a momentous historical turning point, a "bureaucratic interval" that could lead backward to "capitalist restoration" or forward to socialist revolution. Everything depended upon the proletariat, and, equally important, upon the intellectuals' commitment to the creation of a Fourth International and 69 "Violence, For and Against: A Symposium on Marx, Stalin, and Trotsky," Common Sense, 7 (Jan. 1938): 19-23. It might also be said that Eastman's own earlier defense of Lenin left hinm helpless before Stalin. Eastman had defended both Lenin's seizure of power and his method of party organization, and he cavalierly argued that a revolution had to be made because the transition to socialism was not inevitable. The question arises: if socialism is not inevitable, on what grounds may one defend a revolution made in its name? Whether or not Leninism begat Stalinism, clearly Lenin divorced the democratic ends of Marxism from the authoritarian methods of the Bolshevik party, thereby severing the "unity of theory and practice" and making power and success the standard for political action. In bringing to light the Hegelian content in Marxism, Eastman ignored completely the ethical and democratic foundations of Karl Marx's thought. Sidney Hook, to his credit, undertook before a hostile American public during the McCarthy era the thankless task of drawing the crucial distinction between the demrocratic traditions of Marxism and the authoritarian consequences of Leninism. (See Hook, Marx and the Marxists: The Ambiguous Legacy [Princeton, 195].) Indeed, Eastman's earlier Leninism results in an embarrassing cul-de-sac, as I try to point out in a forthcomning study where I compare his views with those of Dos Passos and Burnham. The dilemma might be formulated in terms of a reversible equation: Marx plus Lenin equals Weber, that is, bureaucracy; Lenin minus Marx equals Mussolini, that is, revolution for revolution's sake, or mere putschismo.</page><page sequence="31">68 John P. Diggins their willingness to defend the Soviet Union as a "workers' state," which, however "deformed" and "betrayed," had succeeded in preserving the collectivization of property and the means of production, the historic victory of the Russian Revolution.70 Many Old Left intellectuals in America couild readily sympathize with Trotsky's opposition to Soviet totalitarianism, a stance that characterized all that was best and noble in a world that was asked to choose the bad against the worst, Stalin against Hitler. They could not agree that Stalinism, any more than fascism, vould be brought down by a revolu- tionary proletariat whose historical mission was determined, not by a socio- logical analysis of its character, but solely by what Eastman called its "meta- physical position" in the Marxist scheme of philosophy. As the controversy developed, Trotsky realized that the sum and substance of the entire issue turned on the dialectical logic he employed both to affirm that the pro- letariat would break the "shell" of Stalinism and to deny that Russia's bureaucracy was an autonomous social stratum. He thus tried to draw Burn- ham into a debate over "The ABC of Materialist Dialectics." Burnham, the last of the "literary Trotskisants," declined, stating "I stopped arguing about religion long ago." Trotsky could only reply glumly: "I once heard Max Eastman voice th-is same sentiment."'71 On that note it could be said that for some American writers the intel- lectual cold war had begun. For Trotsky had called upon his followers to continue to resist Stalinism as "reactionary" and at the same time support Stalin's foreign policy in Eastern Europe as "progressive." This paradoxical proposition was offered not solely on the basis of Rtussia's national secuirity, the rationale used a year earlier by Stalinists to excuse the nonaggression pact and, curiously, used two decades later by some New Left historians to excuse Yalta.72 Rather, it derived from a fantastic philosophy of history that couild justify supporting Stalinism in Poland as revolutionary while continuing to oppose it in Russia as counterrevolutionary. At this critical point the issue of dialectical reasoning became almost a matter of life and death to Trotsky, for never did so much depend upon how the human mind perceived the unfolding nature of historical reality. He now plunged into intellectual history with all the passion, if not the sense of irony, of Perry Miller or Arthur 0. Lovejoy as he tried to find in Aristotle and classical philosophy arguments to use against Eastman.73 At the same time lhe 70 Leon Trotsky, "The Soviet Uniioni Today: The Workers State and the Question of Thermi- dore and Bonapartism," New Internationail, 2 (July 1935): 116-22; The Revolution Betrayed: What Is the Soviet Union and Where Is It Going, tr.

Seemingly fighting a one-man war against the power of Stalin with the ideas of Hegel, confronted by the defection of the intellectuals in America, Trotsky remained convinced that the "dual" nature of Stalinism could be understood only if one maintained a dialectical interpretation of history: It is not sturprising that the theoreticians of the opposition who reject dialectical thought capitulate lamentably before the contradictory nature of the USSR. How- ever the contradiction between the social basis laid down by the revolution, and the character of the caste which arose out of the degeneration of the revolution is not only an irrefutable historical fact but also a motor force. In our struggle for the overthrow of the bureaucracy we base ourselves on this contradiction.74 Trotsky remained equally convinced that it was "Eastman and his ilk" who had corrupted the mnind of a whole generation of American Marxist in- tellectuals to the point where it had lost the cognitive capacity to see "all things and phenomena in their continuous change" (but not the workers, who are "naturally inclined to dialectical thinking"). Since he held the epistemological key that would unlock the riddle of Stalinism, and since he saw himself as the last remaining revolutionary who possessed the Hegelian vision of history that would illuminate the meaning of events, Trotsky pro- ceeded to instruct Americans on how to think and how not to think. "Dialectical training of mind, as necessary to a revolutionary as finger ex- ercises to a pianist," is superior to "pragmatism" and the "banalities of 'com- mon sense,' " wrote Trotsky, as he endeavored to show how the "housewife," vailed in the ancient classical world before man had knowledge of evolution. It was then believed that a thing cannot both be and not be, cannot be itself and that which it is not. But Aristotle's logic of identity (A=A) underwent a revolution when man became aware that reality is changing and not static. Once the universe was perceived as dynamic and evolutionary, Hegelian-Marxist thought was the only way man could understand the laws of development. Now the logic of con- tradiction replaced the logic of identity, for a thing was seen to be in the process of becoming that which it is not, of growing, changing, and transforming itself into something else. Indeed, Trotsky insistecl with dialectical flourish, any other perception of reality would deny the existence of reality. For the antiquated axiom that "A is equal to A signifies that a thing is equal to itself if it does not change, that is, if it does not exist" (Trotsky, "A Petty-Bourgeois Opposition in the Socialist Workers Party," The New International, 6 [1940]: 35-42). In response to Trotsky's exposition, Eastman pointed out that the idea of evolution was quite familiar to Aristotle in the writings of Thales, Anaximander, Xenophanes, and Anaxagoras, who were discussed in his chapters on metaphysics, and it was also familiar to the classical world of Heraclitus and Solon. Eastman then maintained-and here he may have pushed his argument too far-that formal logic had no ontological status. When the Greek philosopher declared that A=A, he was not writing a "science of being" but an approach to reasoning, "not talking about existent things but consistent thinking. . . . The principle, A equals A, means that if you are going to be rational, or in other words talk sense, the meaning of your terms must not shift while you are talking. You cannot even argue-as Trotsky does so skillfully in that paragraph-that all existence is a process, unless by existence you mean existence and by process process. You could not even state that a pound. of sugar is always unequal to itself, unless the term pound of sugar remained identical in meaning with the term itself. That is what Aristotle perceived; that is what formal logic is about" (Eastman, Marxism is it Science [New York, 19401, 286-87). 74 Trotsky, In Defense of Marxism, 53.</page><page sequence="33">70 John P. Diggins the "illiterate peasant woman," and the "fox" in the woods all demon- strated in their everyday behavior unconscious "Hegelian tendencies."75 Trotsky believed World War II would be the ultimate test of his theory of Stalinism as a transitory episode about to explode, and he was prepared to concede that if the proletariat demonstrated its "congenital incapacity . . . of accomplishing the task placed upon it by the course of development, nothing would remain except openly to recognize that the socialist program, based on the internal contradictions of capitalist society, ended as Utopia."76 Trotsky did not live to see the death of the very dream to which he dedi- cated his whole political life, and his former followers were left to face Stalinism alone, without the historical certainties that Marxism had once guaranteed them. Stalinism, then, not "communism," was the terror and the mystery of the anti-Stalinist Old Left. And in a curious way, writers like Eastman, Hook, and Burnham would continue to carry on their old struggle against Stalinism unencumbered by the intellectual legacy of Trotskyism-the myth of the dialectic and its philosophical counterpart, the proletariat.77 Whatever the merits of their later attitudes toward the cold war in Europe and Asia, and however questionable the process by which anti- Stalinism may have grown into a morally indiscriminate crusade to defend a democratically illegitimate "free world," the dissolution of these twin myths was necessary. Stripped of its mystical "motor force" and mysterious power of self-negation, history could now be studied on its own terms, 75 Ibid., 50, 54, 83. After delving into Aristotle to refute Eastman, Trotsky embraced the entire universe in his "Open Letter to Comrade Burnham": "Every individual is a dialectician to some extent or other, in most cases, unconsciously. A housewife knows that a certain amount of salt flavors soup agr-eeably, but that added salt makes the soup unpalatable. Consequently, an illiterate peasant woman guides herself in cooking soup by the Hegelian law of the transforma- tion of quantity into quality. Similar examples from daily life could be cited without end. Even animals arrive at their practical conclusions not only on the basis of the Aristotelian syllogism but also on the basis of the Hegelian dialectic. Thus a fox is aware that qua(lrupeds and birds are nutritious and tasty. On sighting a hare, a rabbit, or a hen, a fox concludes: this particular creature belongs to the tasty and nutritive type, and-chases after the prey. We have here a complete syllogism, although the fox, we may suppose, never read Aristotle. When the same fox, however, encounters the first animal which exceeds it in size, for example, a wolf, it quickly concludes that quantity passes into quality, and turns to flee. Clearly, the legs of a fox are equipped with Hegelian tendencies, even if not ftully conscious ones. All this demonstrates, in passing, that our methods of thought, both formal logic and the dialectic, are not arbi- trary constructions of our reason but rather expressions of the actual inter-relationships in nature itself. In this sense, the universe throughout is permeated with 'unconscious' dialectics. But nature did not stop there. No little development occurred before nature's inner relationships were converted into the language of the consciouisness of foxes and men, and man was then enabled to generalize these forms of consciousness and transform them into logical (dialectical) categories, thus creating the possibility for probing more deeply into the world about us" (Trot- sky, In Defense of Marxism, 84). This fantastic discussion, which suggests a structure of mind in nature mediated through forms of language and behavior, could make Trotsky something of a precursor of French Structuralism. As Carl Becker might have said, not being a fox, I'm in no position to judge. 76 Leon Trotsky, "The U.S.S.R. in War," The Nezv International, 5 (1939): 327. 77 Eastman and Hook still believed in working-class struggle, which is not to be confused with the "proletariat." The former is a reality that can be studied in historical and sociological terms; the latter is an idea rooted in Marx's dialectical scheme of thought, a concept that can neither be affirmed nor refuted empirically, and hence better described as "philosophical."

Thus Eastman's original philosophical quarrel with Marx ended with Trot- sky. Once championed as Lenin's rightful heir, Trotsky was now regarded as the last heroic antagonist to Stalin, tragically continuing his struggle with nothing left save a philosophy of history "saturated with optimism."78 Ironically, the "metaphysical illusions" that Eastman believed Lenin had purged from Marxism re-emerged in the mind of Trotsky, whose entire edifice of belief in the meaning of events in Europe lay ultimately in the dialectic, and whose valiant but desperate hopes for the Fourth International would lie ultimately in ruins on the battlefields and in the concentration camps of World War II-history's answer to Hegel. 78 Eastman, "Russia and the Socialist Ideal," 382.</page></plain_text>
