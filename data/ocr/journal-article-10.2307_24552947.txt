<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRINTS &amp; PHOTOGRAPHS PUBLISHED Plate size varies. Individual titles are James Joyce, Joyce in the 1920s, Sylvia Beach and James Joyce in Front of Her Bookshop "Shakespeare &amp; Company ", Ford Maddox Ford, Joyce, Ezra Pound and John Quinn in Pound's Paris Studio 1923, James Stephens, Joyce and John Sullivan in Paris, Joyce's Dance by Desmond Harmsworth, Drawing of Joyce by Constantin Brancusi, Portrait of Joyce by Constantin Brancusi, and Cartoon of Joyce and His Friends by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Blake has taken drawings and photographs of James Joyce and his circle in the '20s and converted them to etchings evocative of the period. Blake's taste in appropriation is immaculate, whether reproducing a Brancusi portrait of the Irish charmer as three lines and a spiral or transforming the tone of vintage photo graphs to hatched patterns. Price: portfolio £2,500; single prints £200-£400. Published by Waddington Graphics, London. Frank Boyden, Changes (1983), a series of ten black and white lithographs signed and numbered by the artist in editions of 45. Each print is 12-1/2x17 in. and was printed on Rives BFK or Arches paper at North Light Editions in Portland, Oregon. Boyden is best known for incised drawings on rounded surfaces, usually of clay. His experi ence in working so directly served him well in making his first prints, which are refined yet immediate. He did them Mannière Noire, drawing with needles, razor blades, sandpa per, etc., on stones brushed with autographic ink, a technique he found less like drawing on clay than expected. "The difference of course is the incredible hardness of the stone as opposed to the soft pliable clay," he explains. "With clay one can sometimes cor rect a mistake but the stones are unforgiving. The last major difference is that the lines made in clay have volume, shadow, and high light. They are usually perceived as dark. Each incision on the stone appears as white." Like his other work, Changes stars archetypal forms from nature—in this case, a salmon and a raven—that "take various forms as they act and interact with each other. They have forms. They are shadows. They are reflections. They wear each other's shapes. They eat each other purposely or because they are blind." Some of his clay pieces also imply narratives. Familiar, too, is an ambiva lent conflation of form and image. But new is the suite's cyclic nature. "I think that per haps the story, or a narrative, emerged this time because of the media of the print. . . . My expectation is that the sum total of my future work will be more condensed and stronger as a result of the printmaking." How nice. Price: portfolio $1,600. Published by the artist, Otis, Oregon. Available in New York at Elements Gallery. John Buck, Jihad (1984), a lithograph in two blacks and a color blend signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 30. Each print is 44-1/2x30-1/4 in. and was printed on Rives BFK paper at Shark's Lithography in Boulder, Colorado. Buck continues to find dramatic graphic forms for his social and political theories. The central image of Jihad is a linked column of three spheres. Over and around this symbol for the Third World is a fiery rendering of a jihad, or holy war, replete with oil wells, minarets, planes, warriors, victims, and flames. A sub tle color blend and shift from red line on black at left and right to black on red at the center add a dervishlike spin to the image. Price: $750. Copublished by the artist and Shark's Lithography, Boulder. Francesco Clemente, Untitled (1984), a 14 color woodblock signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 200. Each print is 16-3/4x23 in. and was printed from 22 linden blocks on Tosa kozo paper by Tadashi Toda in Kyoto. Reizo Monjyu carved the blocks. This is a self-portrait on the lines of / (1982), though Clemente now pictures himself as more troubled than arrogant. Of all the Crown Point woodcuts done in Japan, his seem to be causing the most commotion. Some find the print merely a parody of the watercolor on which it is based, no more than an estampe done after the artist's origi nal. Others consider the carver equal to Cle mente as artist. And others couldn't care less how or by whom the work was done, content to enjoy marvelously sensual color and subtle imagery. For you to decide, but know the story. Price: $1,200. Published by Crown Point Press, Oakland. Pierre Collin, Au lavebo I (At the Sink I), Le réveil II (The Awakening ΙΓ) (1984), two etch ings with drypoint signed and numbered by the artist in editions of ten. Each print is 78 3/4x39-3/8 in. and was printed on Arches paper, Au lavebo I at Atelier Lacourière et Frelaut in Paris and The Awakening II at Ate lier Juan Barbara in Barcelona. Collin is an interesting French figurative artist whose work, particularly since 1981, has been influ enced by photography, not by a photographic reproduction of visual detail but a photo graphic range of perspective. By using un usual viewpoints, making the space of his picture vaguely unfamiliar, he loads the familiar with a psychic presence. The artist's studio seems a vast, lonely chasm, and a man waking up is menacing. Collin's exaggera tion of light and shadow is similarly unset tling. Recent large works also gain energy from size. Price: $1,600 each. Published by the artist, Paris. Available in New York at Area X Gallery and in Washington, D.C., at Brody's Gallery. Karen Erla, Untitled (1984), a monoprint signed by the artist. The print is 15-1/2x24 in. (image size) and 22x30 in. (paper size) and was printed on Arches paper by the artist in Harrison, New York. Erla considers her monoprints visual poems, an abstract archi tecture of shifting planes and spaces symbolic of urban landscape. In addition to soft ground and aquatint, she often paints plates with gesso, like a collagraph, or uses viscosity techniques to achieve pointillist effects. Color is seen through color is seen through color. Pierre Collin, Le réveil II, etching with dry point (78-3/4x39-1/4 in.), 1983. Courtesy Brody's Gal lery, Washington, D.C. Single editions and portfolios are listed in alphabetical order by artist or portfolio. All prints listed have been seen by a member of the PCN staff. For further information on any of the listings, it is suggested you contact your regular print dealer. Dike Blair, Lotus and Robot ( 1984), a litho graph with embossing signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 24. Each print is 37x7-1/2 in. and was printed on Copperplate Deluxe paper by Richard Finch at Normal Editions Workshop, Illinois State University, in Normal. Blair's first print is a Construc tivist image of circles and other geometric shapes poised in a vertical balance against a white ground. Some of these elements are embossed, reinforcing a sculptural presence also found in his paintings on glass. Price: $250. Copublished by the artist and Getler/ Pall/Saper, New York. Peter Blake, James Joyce in Paris (1983-84), a portfolio of nine intaglios signed and nurh bered by the artist in editions of50or75with 15 artist's proof each. Each print is 13x9-7/8 in. (paper size) and was printed on Rives BFK paper at Atelier Crommelynck in Paris. 176</page><page sequence="2">More than 20 plates may be used in one monoprint. Sometimes she adds a cursive script, much like graffiti, or rhythmic lines done with graphite, craypas, or rubbing stone. Plates may be reused, but each in the series is a different variation on one theme worked for some 20 years, "to be developed as though it were a Bach fugue." Price: $400. Published by the artist, Harrison. Available in Chicago at van Straaten Gallery. Joe Goode, Forest Fires (1984), a series of six lithographs signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 30. Each print is 8x20 in. (image size) and 14-1/2x26-1/4 in. (paper size) and was printed on Arches black paper at Cirrus Editions in Los Angeles. Goode has been painting forest fires for some three years now, and this is his second series of prints on the theme. As is usual for him, he did perhaps 20 plates, each worked with washes, and then decided on colors and com binations of plates for each print. All six in the series—an airy mesh of fire and smoke— share red, orange, and gray; one also has yellow, which appears green when printed on black paper. Gorgeous. Sizzlers, all. Price: $450 each. Published by Cirrus Editions, Los Angeles. Ellsworth Kelly, Orient Beach (1984), a black and white lithograph signed and num bered by the artist in an edition of 16 with state editions. Each print is 48x50 in. and was printed on Arches Cover 88 paper at Gemini G.E.L. in Los Angeles. Released at the same time are three other lithographs based on circle segments—Bai Rouge, Cul de Sac, and Cupecoy. Kelly's play of curved shape against rectangular ground is elegantly sub tle and powerful, as always. Surprising, how ever, are the painterly irregularities of each image, from the rough brushstrokes of Cupe coy to the mottled patterns of Orient Beach, which has a footprint at its upper right cor ner. In an untitled triptych, such strokes even establish the soft edge of each squarish image. Such surface interest evokes Kelly's recent sculptures of wood or Cor-ten, mate rials that change with time, but also relates to his experiments with chance in paper cutouts in the early '50s. Kelly thinks people think of him as more of a purist than he is; he stepped on the Orient Beach plate himself. These are authoritative works with a new direction in prints for the artist. Price: Orient Beach $1,200. Published by Gemini G.E.L., Los Angeles. Available in New York at Castelli Uptown, where the complete series will be shown November 10-December 1. Philip Larson, The Four Elements (The Four Times of Day) (1984), a series of four etchings with engraving and sandblasting signed and numbered by the artist in editions of 12. Each print is 30x22 in. and was printed by the artist on Arches cream paper at the Min neapolis College of Art and Design. Individ ual titles are Morning Fire, Midday Earth, Evening Water, and Night Air. Each is a moral izing still life showing the return of all living things to "the elements." Each features a cylindrical kitchen object, "a medieval fusing of an object's outward appearance with its inner nature," explains Larson. In Night Air, for example, a rat is lured by garbage fumes, gets trapped, and joins the heavenly air obrne. In Evening Water pickles in a jar descend as "drainlike surgical slices." "Eve rywhere the still-life tradition of analygous form works its relentless logic." Decorative patterns—hexagons, parallels, concentric circles, and ellipses—reinforce that logic, bestowing a civilized order to homely change. Based on earlier drawings, The Ele ments show off Larson's programmatic wit more obviously than recent gold-leaf proj ects, whose elegance can be a gold herring for those unwary. Printing, by the artist, is skillful. Larson can do it all. Price: set of four $1,600. Published by the artist, Minneapolis. Available in Minneapolis at Thomson Gallery. Beauvais Lyons, Catalogue of the Apasht Excavations, Volume II (1983-), a portfolio of 21 lithographs signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 15. Each print is 22x28 in. and was printed on Arches buff paper by the artist at the Arizona State University Print Research Facility in Tempe. The port folio consists of a title page, preface, four pages of text, 13 plates, and two views of the Etanicullah Monument, one as it looked c. 3000 BC and another c. 1922 AD. The monu ment represents the height of the Apasht civ ilization, destroyed by flash floods or Mongol invasions. Apasht shards, including remains of the Creation Codex, thought to be the world's first printed book, were found in four mounds at Hindu Koosh in 1922. This port folio reproduces a 1933 English translation of the French report of the discoveries. Prints reproducing the shards and Apasht creation theories are by Beauvais Lyons, director of Hokes Archives. The catalogue tells all one need know about the Apasht and more, for Lyons has not only created the prints but fabricated the shards and theories. He calls such mock documentation "artifactual fic tion," combining apparently factual docu mentation with an imaginary reality. His hoax is truly amusing, for he has a light touch with heavy footnotes and hermaphro dite Apashts. Lectures and museum exhibi tions further substantiate the fiction, as does this review. Price: portfolio $2,200. Published by the artist, Ogden, Utah. Michael Manzarakos, I Can't Hear You I, II (1984), two monoprints signed by the art ist. Each print is 38x24 in. (image size) and 42x28 in. (paper size) and was printed on Arches paper by the artist at Steven Sorman's studio in St. Croix, Minnesota. Manzarakos is currently using old photographs to restruc ture his memory of his past. For I Can't Hear You he used fragments of two photographs, one a picture of himself in 1978 and the other a photograph of the Everglades, where he Bruce McLean, Untitled, screenprint (39-3/4x31 1/2 in.), 1984. Courtesy Bernard Jacobson Gal lery, New York. was working at the time. By drawing on the plate, connecting the photographic images and expanding their imagery, he attempts to retrieve the experience. Then, building on that kinetic memory, he changes the frag ments and draws further for a deeper, more visually complex restructuring. Some recent series represent four or five such states of mind. Price: $900 each. Published by the artist, Minneapolis. Available in Minneapo lis at Thomson Gallery, where his works will be shown to November 24. Bruce McLean, Untitled (1984), a screen print in five color variants signed and num bered by the artist in editions of 20 each. Each print is 39-3/4x31-1/2 in. and was printed on Arches paper by Bernard Cull at Coriander Studios in London. McLean has cleaned up his printing act with a more care fully produced series of as yet untitled works, featuring motifs from recent paintings. Is he using or being used by the system? Again, an odd assortment of ladders, ballet shoes, pipesmokers, and wearers of hats, which may be pots, socks, or pocketbooks, mocks the pretensions not only of the Gucci set but the art world. The British performance artist decided to become a painter—"buy canvas and stretchers, and wear a beret, frequent art bars and chat a lot"—in 1982 when he noticed the many instant New Image paint ers and Neo-Expressionists running after sales in Berlin. His own works seek to expose the glibness of such art with easy parodies. Brightly colored and cartooned, the prints use their appeal to sabotage the system. Price: $500. Published by Bernard Jacobson Ltd., London. Available in New York at Bernard Jacobson Gallery. Giulio Paolini, Idea del tempio della pittura (1983), a four-part lithograph signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 100 with six artist's proofs. Each part is 9-7/8x14 1/2 in. and was printed on white stock by Colitti in Rome. Idea del tempio della pittura first appeared as eight pages in the magazine A.E.I. U.O. For the print (see pages 166-67), 177</page><page sequence="3">Kingsley Parker, Seafood, etching with aquatint (5x40-1/4 in.), 1984. Courtesy Condeso/Lawler Gallery, New York. each part is comprised of two facing pages as laid out in the magazine. Paolini uses paint ing reproductions, diagrams of Doric columns, and photographs to create his own hand-to-eye perspective. The study was intended for installations in Berlin and Paris. The print allows the work yet another read ing. Cased in a portfolio with text by art critic and publisher Bruno Corà. Price: $800. Published by A.I.E.U.O., Rome. Available in New York through Giuliana Setari. Kingsley Parker, Seafood (1984), a black and white etching with aquatint signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 40. Each print is 5x40-1/4 in. (image size) and 10-1/2x47-3/4 in. (paper size) and was printed on Rives BFK paper by Nancy Bro kopp in New York. Seafood is one of three additions to Parker's recent series of prints on tankers, all of which are amusing sight gags inspired by the ship's absurdly long shape. Massive piers block out all but the tanker's bow and funnel in Docking §1 and #2. In Seafood, only its stern is seen as it sinks in a sea of sharks. Such disaster is accepted with a childlike innocence. How could any thing so long sail the sea? As ridiculous are Peaceful Night and Daybreak: Under Siege in which a desert fortress literally faces attack. Parker's current anthropomorphism began with his play on the shape and title of his camelback sofa about three years ago. The sofa and fortress have been the subject of many paintings, but the tanker has been done only in print, Parker preferring to avoid the problematic specifics of "marine paint ing." Price: $200. Published by the artist. Available in New York at Condeso/Lawler Gallery. Jiirgen Partenheimer, Ying Yang (Passage) (1984), a black and white linocut signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 25. Each print is 11-11/16x8-1/4 in. (image size) and 21x15 in. (paper size) and was printed on German Etching paper by the artist in his studio in Diisseldorf. Partenheimer's recent prints are visually more complex than his earlier work, yet as ambivalent in their mix of suggested reference and abstract design. Such reticence is refreshing midst so much current angst. Price: $500. Published by Perma Press, New York. James Rosenquist, Electrical Nymph on a Non-Objective Ground (1984), a 14-color litho graph from 16 plates signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 30. Each print is 42x42 in. and was printed on white lami nated plastic at Universal Limited Art Edi tions in West Islip. There's no need for a frame. Rosenquist painted a stopout on the plate and then drew his image. When the stopout was removed, only a fragment of the image remained. A composite portrait of a billboard-beautiful woman is thereby trans formed into a splayed and charged geometry of spikes and angles. The idea—perfected in this print, Rosenquist's best in ages— informs his new paintings, introduced at Thordén Wetterling Gallery, Stockholm, this fall. Price: $2,800. Published by Universal Limited Art Editions, West Islip. Available in New York at Castelli Uptown. Julian Schnabel, Brenda (1984), an etch ing signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of fivfe with five proofs. Each print is 5x3 ft. and was printed from two plates on velvet by Jeryl Parker and Brenda Zlamany at Jeryl Parker Editions in New Paltz and framed without glass. One of six recent vel vet editions by Schnabel—who else?—Brenda is particularly successful. Colors of ink and velvet vary in each printing; these are pink and green on black velvet, pink on dark green, black on yellow, black on red, black on lavender, black on blue, black on pink, yellow on umber, and two browns on ivory. Brenda is printer Brenda Zlamany. Schna bel's wife can also be seen among the overlay of images, as can aspects of his country home where he worked on the copper plates through the summer of 1983. Lending haute couture irony to such summer sketching is the interaction of velvet and ink. The same pink was printed twice on the dark green Brenda, for example, but it seems two hues and sometimes shines. The velvet itself reflects and absorbs light, adding to the glamorous and tacky splendor. Never will prints be the same. Price: $8,000. Published by Parasol Press, New York. Available in New York at Martina Hamilton Gallery. Steven Sorman, Another Word (Yours) (1984), a five-color lithograph signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 25 with three artist's proofs. Each print is 58x25 in. and was printed on Kayasuki, Bitchu Torinoko, Domuku hanga, and black Moriki paper by David Keister and David Calkins at Echo Press in Bloomington, Indiana. Sor man continues to find new images of interest to enliven with painterly gesture, from the legs of his wife used in recent Tyler mono prints to the architectural ornament of Another Word (Yours), one of three new Echo editions. As usual, the print's format is com plex, with four sheets placed and collaged so that one may veil or change the printed image of another. The images themselves are irregular. A spiral becomes a plant or a column with Sorman, like a latter-day Wat teau, suggesting or completing a pattern at will, but cutting architectural grandeur with rough line and markings. Price: $1,200. Published by Echo Press, Bloomington. Pat Steir, The Tree After Hiroshige (1^34), a drypoint with spit bite, aquatint, and hard ground signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 30. Each print is 23-3/4x36 in. (image size) and 31-1/2x42 in. (paper size) and was printed on Arches Cover buff paper by Marcia Bartholme and Peter Pettengill at Crown Point Press in Oakland. Three panels are bordered by art markings and signs and color swaths. The panels are vertical, much like Japanese screens. Each views the famous Hiroshige tree from a different perspective, but the perspective is Steir's, not Hiroshige's. At left is her most faithful rendering of the tree, an abstraction of reality as art. At cen ter she brings this abstraction within her own system, creating an illusion. At right she comes closer still, and only her own gesture is seen. The desire to make a mark is primal in art, she believes, so that the third panel, which seems the most abstract, is really the most real. Such reordering of three perspec tives—abstraction, illusion, myth and desire —has been key to Steir's art for some time now. When working in Japan for Crown Point Press, she was intrigued to find a simi lar ordering of multiple viewpoints in J apa nese screens. Price: $1,000. Published by Crown Point Press, Oakland. Frank Stella, Pergusa Three Double (1984), a relief etching with engraving and screenprint signed and numbered by the artist in an edi tion of 30. Each print is 102x66 in. and was printed on two sheets of TGL paper at Tyler Graphics in Bedford, New York. The hand made paper is dyed with ten liquid dyes, with an additional 64 colors printed from seven etched magnesium plates, one woodblock, and 13 screens. Frank Stella and Ken Tyler have made printing history in the '80s with their Circuits and Swan Engravings. It is only fitting that Stella come up with another blockbuster in time for the opening of the Tyler Graphics Archive at Walker Art Cen ter. Pergusa Three Double, like the other Pergusa Three prints, keys to Stella's Pergusa Three con struction. But the signature Pergusa squiggle is not a vertical but two horizontals, with one part of the two-part print almost the mirror image of the other. Such balanced composi tion reinforces the surface strength of the image, an incredibly rich mix of colors, markings, and shimmer. The six progressive 178</page><page sequence="4">proofs of Estoril Five I are one of the high lights of the Tyler show at the Walker. It would be fascinating to see such progressives for Pergusa Three Double, but, though some trial proofs exist, its mysteries must remain mysterious. Price: $30,000. Published by Tyler Graphics, Bedford. Wayne Thiebaud, Dark Cherries (1984), a drypoint with aquatint signed and numbered by the artist in an edition of 25. Each print is 9x12 in. (image size) and 14x17 in. (paper size) and was printed on Arches 88 paper by Marcia Bartholme, Peter Pettengill, and Hidekatsu Takada at Crown Point Press in Oakland. Thiebaud's drypoint with aquatint Cherries (PCN, XV, 66) was a great success, and he understandably liked the image. Reworking the three plates, he substituted a deep aquatint ground for the tone and added a cross-hatched shadow around the bowl. Unfortunately, nice as Dark Cherries is, it's a case of more is less. Price: $1,250. Published by Crown Point Press, Oakland.</page></plain_text>
