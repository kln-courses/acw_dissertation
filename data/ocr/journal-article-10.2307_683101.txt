<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST and scripts. Had the advisors been more ac- tively involved in conceptualizing and devel- oping the exhibit from the outset, some of the discontinuities and inaccuracies may have been avoided. Places in the exhibit where a guiding native presence can be felt offer the most vivid and truthful experience to the visitor. The most compelling aspect of "A Mohawk Iroquois Village," amidst all the visual detail, is aural. As a visitor stands inside the long- house "watching" the storytelling scene, the voice of a Mohawk grandmother (Akwe- sasne's Delia Cook) speaks immediately next to her. The audio system is so clear, and the speaker's voice so beautifully inflected and comforting, that one feels enveloped by the sound. Despite the plexiglass partition, the sensation is to be drawn in, to become a listener by the fire. This works extremely well as theater, but it is no less accurate for that-it is real, and both historical and contemporary. Ron LaFrance, Director of Cornell's Native Studies program and a traditional leader from Akwesasne, served as facilitator, transla- tor, and ambassador as the project team sought to create the storytelling tape. Kahion- hes, John Fadden, was another resource for the stories. The three stories featured-the Seven Dancing Brothers, the Life Support- ers/Three Sisters, and the Great Bear-all emphasize lessons about community living. There is a good interpretive link between the storytelling tape and a video that plays continu- ously next to the scale model. Entitled "Seasons of the Mohawk: Traditional Iroquois Village Life," the video features Delia Cook, her grand- daughter, and Ron LaFrance discussing (in Mo- hawk with subtitles) social and ceremonial life as well as materials and processes of traditional food gathering. Contemporary outdoor scenes of their demonstrations are interspersed with shots of Seneca artist Ernie Smith's evocative paintings of seasonal activities. In this section of the hall it is possible to see continuities from life in a precontact village (the scale model) to the early 20th century (the Smith paintings) to Mohawk people today (in the video). The video reflects substantial native involvement in both conceptualization and production. More vid- eos are planned, on "Selecting the Site," "Build- ing the Village," and "Community Organiza- tion," and it is to be hoped that these will follow the pattern of showing the survival of many Iroquois traditions across time. Generally, though, connections between the life groups to native people today are hard to make. A visitor sees vignettes of possible past lives and in the Mohawk longhouse steps into a moment of virtual reality. Visually impressive from its life-sized constructions to its smallest 5/8-inch scale model figurine, the Hall of Na- tive Peoples still needs to enrich this presenta- tion with information that gives meaning to the details. Processes of change and continuity are either undiscussed or presented in a dry and factual way. Missing from a number of label texts is a sense of what these artifacts signify to Iroquois people. Information given about the full-size replica George Washington wampum belt, for example, concentrates on the number of beads used and the search for an exact purple dye. An excellent opportunity exists here to describe the great spiritual and political impor- tance of these belts to the Iroquois, and the reasons why a replica is displayed rather than the original. As museums consider renovating outdated exhibits or developing new ones, they can also break new ground in their methods of working with native people. More than serv- ing as advisors or reviewers, native consult- ants should hold fully collaborative decision- making roles from the earliest stages of creating exhibit concepts, messages, and de- signs. A commitment to involving a wide and equal team of relevant experts and practitio- ners will open up and integrate both the process and the results. Exhibits will look different, tell a variety of stories, and present new (and sometimes contradictory) ways of looking at information. The New York State Museum's Iroquois displays engage and in- form audiences most successfully when re- flecting this process of inclusion.

The new Fowler Museum of Cultural History conjures a resplendent visual dia- logue with the old campus's predominant Lombardian style. Echoed here in the new building are the picturesque tile roofs, square towers, arched doorways and windows, and an oculus glazed with protective filtering glass. A large wall case in the foyer displays a chronology of the museum from its estab- lishment in 1963 to the opening of the pre- sent building. Over the past 30 years, the museum has boasted a modest but distin- guished exhibition program and has ac- quired a collection of over 750,000 artifacts. The inaugural exhibitions embrace the in- tellectual passions of some of the most promi- nent figures responsible for the development of the new museum. Director Christopher Donnan relates his life's work on the study of ancient Peruvian ceramics; Deputy Director Doran Ross communicates his long-standing fascination for the elephant in African cul- ture; veteran Curator of Textiles Patricia Alt- man interprets a systematic collection of Maya costume donated by cocurator Caroline West; and museum benefactor Francis E. Fowler, Jr., shares posthumously his collec- tion of silver-one of the fruits of his fortune made from the invention of Southern Com- fort whiskey. Although the planners of the new Fowler Museum probably did not intend any mean- ingful associations between these four very disparate exhibitions, it could be argued that each in its own way deals with a common theme of disappearance. Hunted down by Western greed, elephants have now become an endangered species threatened with disap- pearance. Functioning as key symbols of eth- nic pluralism and indigenous identity, Guate- malan textiles may eventually be in danger of disappearing as a result of the nationalist ambitions of the central state. Retrieved as material records of the past, ancient ceramics are pressed into service as visual testimony to the now disappeared ancestors of modern Peruvian cultures. And, finally, the perma- nent exhibition of silver speaks to the disap- pearance of great affluence in America-a vanishing era in which vast family fortunes were often earned in a single generation, with enough surplus capital to endow a major mu- seum. Elephant: The Animal and its Ivory in African Culture is a monumental homage to the Afri- can elephant that explores both the repre- sentation of the elephant in African material culture and the use of the elephant body as raw material. In the first gallery, devoted to early portrayals of the elephant, amidst silk- screened images from prehistoric African rock art stand some of the exhibition's most precious artifacts: a 14th-century Nigerian bronze elephant from Tada and a terracotta elephant-head potlid from Ife. Objects that draw meaningful associations between their owners and the elephant's characteristic qualities of strength, nobility, and clairvoy- ance are highlighted. A dramatic change of mood is signaled by a swirling assemblage of elephant masks posi- tioned atvarying heights against a painted red background, suggestive of the hot color of power and majesty. The masks are contextu- alized and further animated by photographs and a video. Included in a section on "Urban Ele- phants" are a six-pack of Tusker lager and a box of Elephant Power laundry detergent. From its traditional function as a symbol of royal authority and spiritual force to its new role in advertising the intoxicating potency of spirits or the cleaning power of soap suds, the symbolic strength of the elephant has not been diminished-its metaphorical domain has simply been shifted and revised. The second half of the exhibition illus- trates how the elephant's body provides the natural materials for the fashioning of cul- tural artifacts. Included here are elephant tail flywhisks, ivory trumpets, callus and hair bracelets, and hide and bone masks. Sixteenth-century ivory carvings commis- sioned by European sailors as tribute to the Portuguese crown signal a shift in the exhibi- tion from the display of indigenous uses of the elephant body to its exportation to the West. African slaves transporting ivory from the interior to the coast are depicted on a 19th-century Loango tusk. Upon arrival, both the porter and his load were shipped over- seas. The cruel irony expressed in this carving is exacerbated by the fact that its medium of execution is itself the product of a monumen- tal tragedy-the signified thus becoming the vehicle of its own signifier. Turn-of-the-century photographs of Euro- pean hunters and traders, and a reconstruc- tion of a Victorian parlor appointed with ivory household items, document the West's obses- sive desire for ivory. From these various im- ages of dismembered elephants to their re- contextualization in the lap of bourgeois luxury, the viewer begins to get a sense of the 1081</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST profound impact of the West's appetite for ivory, which has led to the endangerment of a species. Turning the corner, even the most thick- skinned viewer is overcome with a feeling of depression. The gallery's raking light, beamed on walls bleached white as bone, bathe in radiant splendor the massive pachy- derm cranium that dominates the center of the room in evidence of the West's crime. In the dead-whiteness of this gallery, are we to reach a state of illumination? Small photo- graphs of protest, ivory burning, and the butchery of bloody carcasses provide an inti- mate experience of the carnage. Torn be- tween the exuberant celebration of elephant imagery in African culture and the bleak vi- sion of the elephant's potential future, one enters with mixed emotions into the silence of the final gallery, where a single closeup photograph of an elephant's eye reproaches the viewer with an urgent glance that asks us not to forget. The rich nuances and wide range of aes- thetic variability in Maya dress are demon- strated in Threads of Identity: Maya Costumes of the 1960s in Highland Guatemala. An orienta- tion room provides an introduction to re- gional geography, cosmology, the relation- ship between dress and gender, and the effects of change through time. A grouping of huipilsfrom the 1950s to 1970s conveys how new colors and materials, such as rayon and acrylic, have successfully been incorporated into Maya clothing. Guatemalan music lures the viewer into the second gallery, where offerings of 17 textiles, arranged according to major language groups, are laid out on altarlike slabs. The complex relationship between dress style and cultural identity is explored in the label copy, while images of Maya people and landscapes are projected on three screens. Concentrating on the range of styles and designs within single regions, low-relief man- nequins are positioned in regimental rows framed by huge monochromatic prints of the frosted peaks of the Chuchumatan Moun- tains and the haunting spectacle of Lake Ati- tlan. While the goal was to dramatize the spectrum and intensity of textile colors by diminishing any competing sensory stimula- tion from the landscape or the mounts, the result is that the textiles assume greater vital- ity than their wearers or creators-people thus being reduced to languid props on which to hang this vibrant dress. The absence of living voices and human agency is largely remedied in the fourth gal- lery by Susan Masuoka's bilingual video And This is Our Identity/YEsta Es Nuestra Identidad, which features interviews with Guatemalan immigrants in Los Angeles. In one of the most moving segments, Leonel Say, a senior at Los Angeles High, recounts how his mother was brought to tears when crossing Mexico on her passage to the United States, where she was obliged to remove her corte and huipil so as not to reveal her Guatemalan identity. The exhibition's theme about the relationship be- tween textiles and cultural identity is remark- ably well captured in this presentation. White plaster figures reminiscent of George Segal's ghostly modernist creations populate life-size dioramas of public and do- mestic scenes in which architectural features have been reduced to wooden frames and bolts of draped muslin. In this final gallery, the vibrant textiles resonate against the aus- tere backdrop of these minimalist construc- tions. The exhibition concludes with the words of a Maya woman who laments the shedding of traditional dress in the heat of the current political climate in Guatemala. While the ex- hibition as a whole offers a celebration of these textiles, this final epitaph reminds us of the fragility of traditions-as the politics of homogenization in the modern nation-state threaten the survival of cultural pluralism and the preservation of indigenous aesthetic forms. Perhaps more than any other exhibition in the museum's inaugural installations, Ceram- ics of Ancient Peru carries with it a strong peda- gogical lesson. Organized like a finely crafted lecture, the museum visitor is guided through a three-dimensional textbook profusely illus- trated with ceramics donated by Herbert L. Lucas, Jr., and other private collectors. The galleries situate these ancient ceramics in their proper context within a matrix of di- mensions plotted through time and space. The exhibition is divided by entranceways suggestive of the architectural features of an- cient Peru and painted in colors that evoke the predominant shades of the ceramics' slip. Anthropomorphic images lifted from the ves- sels are reproduced on the walls. The first gallery is divided laterally between the cul- tures of the south coast and the north. Mov- ing through the exhibit, one progresses from the Formative Period to the Florescent Pe- riod, with examples from the cultures of Nasca, Moche, Recuay, and Vicuis. Other gal- leries are devoted to the arts of the Huari Empire, the Period of Regional States, the Inca Empire, and the Colonial Period. 1082 [95,1993]</page><page sequence="4">EXHIBIT/PHOTOGRAPHIC REVIEWS Grouping ceramic vessels by subject matter, the exhibition's final gallery demonstrates the continuity of predominant themes through time. Distributed throughout the exhibition are displays of various tools and explanations of the techniques of production. An educa- tional component uses flash cards to instruct the viewer to distinguish between ceramic styles. On one visit to the exhibition, a weary mother was unable to extricate her child from this engrossing game. The melody of a Baroque harpsichord en- tices the visitor intoReflecting Culture: The Fran- cis E. Fowler, Jr. Collection of Silver. All manner of silver are exhibited in this opulent dis- play-drinking vessels, food service, flatware, candelabra, religious and personal items. Un- like the familiar installations of silver at art museums, where such objects are presented without interpretation as "decorative" arts, this exhibition, curated by Betsy Quick and Henrietta Cosentino, attempts to contextual- ize this embarrassment of riches as ethnohis- torical material culture. The exhibit is in- formed by current research in European social history, with its emphasis on recon- structing the past through attention to the details of domestic and private life. Galleries introduce the viewer to the tech- nology of silversmithing, the identification of guild punch marks, the role of women in the early European silver industry, and the sym- bolic function of silver as an emblem of wealth and prestige. Wall cases distinguish between rococo, regency, and other styles. One of the most remarkable galleries is de- voted to silver drinking vessels-a focus of Fowler's collection that grew out of his eco- nomic interest in whiskey. Beer tankards, wine coolers, and coffee and tea services are contextualized through enlargements of pe- riod paintings that depict similar items in use. In the final gallery hangs an oil portrait of Francis E. Fowler, Jr., holding a Russian Kovsch, an ornate silver-gilt and cloisonne commemorative drinking vessel. The return gaze of the benefactor urges the departing museum visitor to remember his generous gift. At first it may seem odd that a collection of European silver should be exhibited in this museum. Indeed, one may be tempted to dismiss the exhibit by assuming that Fowler's financial support depended on the inclusion of a permanent display of his collection. This exhibit, however, represents more thanjust a fiscal silver lining; it speaks to an emerging philosophy of cultural exhibitions that throws into question the traditional boundaries be- tween anthropology and art history. If it is no longer surprising today that African and pre- Columbian objects should be exhibited in art museums, why should a display of European silver seem out of place in this museum? Anthropology museums and art museums have inherited from the 19th century an awk- ward division of labor that has proved prob- lematic in representing accurately the vast array of material culture in the world. Since global societies are not fragmented into autonomous parts, why should museums charged with the representation of these so- cieties be separated into discrete categories? While anthropology museums and art muse- ums struggle in their respective ways to chip away at the academic boundaries that divide these two institutions, the Fowler Museum offers a new intervention into the discourse of museum representation. It defines itself neither as an anthropology museum nor as an art museum, but occupies the still ambigu- ous zone of a museum of "cultural history" that, in true postmodern fashion, defies facile classification. 1083</page></plain_text>
