<plain_text><page sequence="1">ADVENTURE LIT THEIR STAR. BY Kenneth Allsop. Crown Publishers, New York, 1964: 81/ X 6 in., ix + 222 pp., 11 illus. by Anthony Smith. $3.95. Kenneth Allsop's book, a reprint of the 1939 edition, may be regarded as a piece of fiction but it has the ring of authenticity. What he writes about a pair of Little Ringed Plovers (Charadrius dubius) in Great Britain, their migrations, their searches for secluded physiographic peculiarities, position on the Atlantic seaboard, and subjection to a temper- ing oceanic climate, it is on the one hand remarkably limited in its breeding habitats for birds and on the other "wide open" to wintering birds and birds of passage. Of the 354 species satisfactorily recorded, hardly more than 100 breed with any regularity, while 200 are involved in migration in the fall and half that number in the spring. Quite under- standably, the Cape has been a popular point of convergence by Massachusetts ornithol- ogists and bird watchers from fall to spring, a fact clearly reflected in the tremendous amount of information from which Dr. Hill has been able to draw. The book begins, logically, with a description of Cape Cod that I find satisfactorily thorough, followed by its ornithological history-an altogether impressive account of the attention given its birds by famous and not-so-famous people in the annals of New England natural history. Then, with introductory explanations, comes the main body of the book- the systematic or annotated list of 384 species (30 hypothetical) and finally an ornitho- logical summary, a bibliography, and an index to those species in the systematic list. The treatment of each species in the systematic list adheres to a set outline (modified when necessary to suit available data), consisting of eight paragraphs separately titled Status, Fall, Winter, Spring, Summer, Distribution, History. and Subspecies. Under</page><page sequence="2">Jtl. 78, No. 2 ORNITHOLOGICAL LITERATURE 247 Status is not the information one would expect but rather the basis for including the species in the list. Often it amounts to naming collections in which the species is rep- resented, but now and then it is a one-word statement, "Presumptive." This, Dr. Hill explains, "indicates a species which, on careful consideration of the evidence, I believe to have been correctly recorded but on the basis of sight records alone." For information on relative abundance that most of us would anticipate under Status, we must look under each of the next four seasonal categories. Here we find, in a(ldition, inclusive and extreme dates and dates of maximum numbers. Under Distribution is included ecological infor- mation relating chiefly to habitats. Under History are notes on such matters as "invasions" (with dates) and significant changes in populations and breeding status. This category exceeds all the others in being more than of local interest; anyone concerned about trends in populations will find it pertinent. All in all, the systematic list stands as a areat credit to Dr. Hill for he has assimilated spots in which to build a nest, their behavior when confronted with the destruction of their previous nesting grounds, their reactions to such innovations of man as radar may not always be found in the literature as phenomena described or demonstrable. But it is so persuasively depicted the reader feels that, if the events described did not occur exactly as the author puts them down, they must have transpired in some such fashion in order to have happened at all. No one has been an active participant among the tens of thousands of birds in spring migration winging over the English Channel (or up the Atlantic or Mississippi Flyways). But the author's depiction of the event, the sense of peril and struggle, is so objectively yet intimately told that the reader catches the urgency of the participants themselves-the insistent drive to reach land becomes a part of the reader's experience. The cold, hard odds that not all will reach safety is implied with a minimum of the anthropomorphic. The book is divided into three parts of which the first division (except chapters 6 and 7) and the first five chapters of the third division deal with the plovers without much intrusion of the human actors. The rest of the book, a comparatively small portion actually, deals with the struggle of Richard Locke to recover from tuberculosis and to find the nest of the Little Ringed Plover. The bouts with illness are the accessories of the novelist but no one interested in the outdoors will fail to respond to the obstacles, the excitement, and the frustrations which beset Locke in his quest. Allsop writes with economic imagery. A heron comes in "slanting down on its great cloaks of wings, stilt- like legs jammed out for the landing" (p. 60). London gulls each evening "oared across the sky like flotillas of white skiffs" (p. 100). His observations of the plovers, their mating, nesting, and resting behavior, their reactions to other animals in the area, are set down with a keen and discriminating eye for fresh and salient metaphor and image. In a foreword to this welcome reprint, the recipient of the John Llewellyn Rhys Memorial Prize, Allsop writes that the work is "a combination of personal observation, recorded facts and imagination. Imagination was sparingly used, for I wanted the story to be truthful and factual, wildlife seen through binoculars' lenses" (p. vii). In the main he has hewn to this line. Actually, so objective is his writing generally that when he permits human connotations to enter a description of an avian reaction, the reader feels the bump of unreality. For instance, when in a description of the female's response to the male's courtship display, the reader finds this human interpretation: "She watched him fixedly, acutely conscious of the flow of excitement that the insistent song aroused in her" and further along learns that the female is "enchanted by the glimmering stream of his flight," he-this reader at least-cannot help wishing Mr. Allsop would not do this when he can do objectivity with such precision.</page><page sequence="3">248 THE WILSON BULLETIN June 197N The fate of Allsop's plovers in this book ends on a happier note than Fred Bodsworth's curlews in "The Last of the Curlews" (1954). As Allsop points out in his Foreword, the first nest of the Little Ringed Plover in Great Britain was discovered in 1938. But the 1956 survey indicated 70 pairs and the 1959 survey nearly a hundred pairs. Latest returns, those of 1963, total at least 175 pairs (pp. vii, viii). "Birds can easily be overlooked," he concludes (p. viii). If that is true for "the London area's two hundred gravel pits" (p. vii), may it not be even truer of certain species of North American birds in such large areas in the United States as Texas or Alaska or, in Canada, such areas as the Prairie Provinces?- HERBERT KRAUSE.</page></plain_text>
