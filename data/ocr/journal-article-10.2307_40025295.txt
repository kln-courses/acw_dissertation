<plain_text><page sequence="1">Documenting and Analyzing Rock Paintings from Torres Strait, ne Australia, with Digital Photography and Computer Image Enhancement Liam M. Brady Monash University Clayton, Victoria, Australia 363 The deterioration of rock-art over time is an important concern for indigenous communities, archaeologists, rock-art researchers, and cultural heritage managers. Computer enhance- ment has emerged as an important tool in viewing poorly visible rock paintings. While most studies regarding this technique explore the methods associated with computer enhancement, there is little discussion of the results that can be generated beyond the recovery of images. This article presents results from the application of computer enhancement methods to rock paintings from the Torres Strait region in ne Queensland. The results obtained through the computer enhancement of deteriorated rock paintings are used to reveal degrees of preservation, interregional interaction, and previously undocumented spatial patterning across the strait. Introduction The creation of art on rock is a fixed, tangible expression of an artist's visual culture. Yet the permanency of these art- works over time is variable. Many artworks are damaged by both anthropogenic (e.g., graffiti) and natural factors (e.g., water or fire damage), which decrease the visibility of im- ages over time. Documentation of rock- art (paintings, stencils, and engravings) by professional rock- art recorders, archaeologists, and indigenous communities has until re- cently been undertaken by recording and analyzing those images that can still be viewed with the naked eye. Strate- gies for recording these images include making simple sketches, drawings, tracings, rubbings, and using conven- tional film photography. But how can we study those im- ages that have deteriorated or faded to such a point that they can no longer be viewed or recorded using conven- tional techniques? Furthermore, how can those images that have experienced considerable deterioration over time contribute to the analysis and interpretation of a region's rock- art assemblage? The introduction of digital technolo- gy and computer enhancement methods into rock- art recording presents researchers with an opportunity to record and examine heavily deteriorated images that would have been missed using conventional recording tech- niques. In this paper, I review the development of digital tech- nology and computer enhancement techniques for the documentation of rock paintings, describe the systematic computer enhancement process used on rock paintings during the Torres Strait Rock- Art Recording Project (2000-2004), and place the results in the context of spatial and temporal motif patterning across Torres Strait. The re- sults demonstrate an approach that incorporates computer enhancement techniques at both individual site-specific and regional levels. Additionally, this method can be used as a tool in the conservation and preservation of rock paint- ings, and as a technique to shed light on new or previous- ly unidentifiable spatial and temporal trends in a rock painting assemblage. Digital Technology and Computer- Aided Enhancement Techniques Digital technology and the application of computer en- hancement techniques for the documentation of deterio- rated rock paintings have been around for over two decades. Early attempts at image enhancement were the re- sult of concerns with the archival life of images captured using conventional photographic film. In particular, re- searchers wanted to improve the archival life of previously documented images without having to re-record a site or copy the slides when the colors began to deteriorate over time (e.g., Dickman 1984; Rip 1983, 1989). As a result,</page><page sequence="2">364 Documenting and Analyzing Rock Paintings from Australia with Digital Photography/Brady slides of images were digitized to improve their archival and storage life. Michael Rip noted that once images were digitized, the application of "digital image processing tech- niques" could be used to "artificially improve the dynamic range of the film and thereby the quality of the picture" (Rip 1989: 12). These early attempts at image enhance- ment proved that enhancing faded rock paintings was pos- sible, although drawbacks included having "the prerequi- site image recording and computer processing facili- ties... availability of image processing software and exper- tise... costs incurred during computer processing and pro- duction of output products" (Rip 1983: 79). These draw- backs disappeared in the 1990s with the emergence of eas- ily attainable and relatively inexpensive digital cameras and digital imaging software (e.g., Adobe Photoshop and Corel PaintShop). This technology opened up new possi- bilities for researchers to record and enhance heavily dete- riorated images, particularly paintings. Research on enhancement of rock paintings has focused primarily on method. For example, Clogg, Diaz-Andreu, and Larkman's (2000) description of the computer en- hancement of a post-Palaeolithic bull painting from Selva Pascuala, Spain, outlines the steps used in the enhancement process and compares the result with other recordings of the same image using conventional techniques. Discus- sions of the technical principles (e.g., color rescaling and manipulation of color saturation) behind the enhancement of a deteriorated image have been described by David and colleagues (2001) with examples of individual pictures from Dauan Island in northern Torres Strait. James Hen- derson's (1995, 2002) cross-polarization enhancement technique combines image enhancement with a specialized photographic technique to "produce high quality scientif- ic photographs" (Henderson 2002: 35). Similar tech- niques have been used in rock- art regions around the world including the United States, Canada, Australia, and Eu- rope (Brady et al. 2004; Briot 1999; Buchner, Hathout, and Russell 2000; Mark and Billo 2002; Hedges 1999). Additional computer-aided applications for the en- hancement of rock paintings have emerged over the last decade. Mosaics and panoramas of large panels or sites can be created using image manipulation software (e.g., Mark and Billo 1999), while analysis of superimposed pictures is aided through digitization of sketches and drawings of im- ages rendered electronically with different colors. This method allows for a more complete understanding of the form and sequence of pictures on complex panels (Area 1999; Brayer, Walt and David 1998). Robert Bednarik has addressed the problem noted by early researchers (like Rip and Dickman) of fading colors recorded in images using conventional film. His method of digitizing slides of rock paintings and reconstituting the colors using a computer- aided color calibration scheme (Bednarik 1995; Bednarik and Seshadri 1995) is a digital means of preserving colors in an image over time. Issues in Computer-Aided Enhancement Some issues regarding superimpositions and objectivity have been raised with the advent of computer-aided meth- ods of image enhancement. Manual tracing, sketching, and conventional photography have, until recently, been the norm in recording rock paintings, but with the technical advances now available to researchers, these earlier meth- ods may be insufficient in contexts where rock paintings are faded. David Lewis-Williams (1990) has remarked on the benefits of manually tracing an image, noting that this process is not just a descriptive one, but allows the re- searcher to note subtleties of superimposition and color (see Read and Chippindale 2000). I believe that digital photography and computer enhancement can now be used in addition to manual tracing and sketching and have sim- ilar benefits for the researcher. Furthermore, digital pho- tography, in combination with image enhancement soft- ware, can be used to identify additional superimpositions which may not have been visible to the naked eye upon ini- tial investigation in the field. The improvement of digital cameras and image enhancement software may have re- moved the need for manual tracing with its possible nega- tive impacts on rock paintings. Read and Chippindale (2000) have questioned the "ob- jective" nature of computer-aided image enhancement. I concur with their observations that "the individual using Photoshop impacts their [rock paintings'] composition, design and use by setting thresholds" and that "[t]hese fea- tures suggest that we should be cautious in claiming an 'ob- jective' label for Photoshop images: they are still products of a recording project initiated by humans and using hu- man discrimination" (Read and Chippindale 2000: 75). While there will always be a degree of subjectivity associat- ed with rock- art recording in general, computer enhance- ment should nonetheless be viewed as a tool that reduces subjectivity (a key component in accurate rock- art record- ing procedures) by means of defined threshold values for each color to be used in the enhancement process. While the technical properties and procedures used in the enhancement of faded paintings have been discussed extensively, application of these techniques has been rare. Case studies provided by computer enhancement re- searchers have focused only on the results obtained from individual pictures or panels, rather than on analysis at a re- gional scale. The research presented here attempts to fill this gap by discussing the results of a project that employs</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Held Arch neology /Vol. 31, 2006 365 systematic digital photography and computer enhance- ment of every picture made in a large region- Torres Strait in tropical ne Queensland. Torres Strait, Queensland The Torres Strait islands, located between Cape York Peninsula and sw Papua New Guinea, are home to Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal people (fig. i). The indige- nous inhabitants of Torres Strait are situated in a unique cultural region between Aboriginal Australian hunter-gath- erers to the south and Melanesian horticulturalists to the north. Sustained interaction between Cape York, Torres Strait, and sw Papua New Guinea (west of the Fly River) has created a primary sphere of interaction that operates through an extensive kinship and customary exchange net- work that links the inhabitants of these areas (see Brady 2006 for details of the social organization of this region;) (Barham 2000; Haddon 1904, 1935; Lawrence 1994; Vanderwal 2004). The indigenous residents of the Torres Strait region are commonly identified as "Saltwater Peo- ple" (McNiven 2003; Sharp 1992, 2002). This identity is a result of the strong relationship with the sea that is visi- ble in Islander and Aboriginal skills as fisherpeoples and dugong and turtle hunters, as well as in worldviews which reflect an intimate association with the sea. Torres Strait Is- landers and Aboriginal people are well-known for their rich artistic traditions. Highly decorative material culture ob- jects such as headdresses, canoes, drums, and sculpture, many of which were collected by the anthropologist Alfred C. Haddon during his research in 1888 and 1898, demon- strate the high degree of ornamentation engaged in by Tor- res Strait Islanders and Aboriginal people. While Torres Strait decorative objects have received attention in the ar- chaeological and anthropological literature (e.g., Haddon 1912; Farr 1987; Fraser 1978; Kaus 2004; Moore 1984, 1989), rock- art has remained at the margins of Torres Strait research until recently. Torres Strait Regional Rock- Art The earliest recording of rock- art from Torres Strait was undertaken by Haddon in 1888 at Kirriri, and again in 1898 atPulu (Haddon 1904a: 5, 1904b: 357). Recording consisted of describing the painting and stenciling tech- niques, and producing sketches and black and white glass plate photographic negatives of rock paintings. Following Haddon's early work, a limited amount of rock- art record- ing was carried out by amateurs, travel writers, anthropol- ogists, and archaeologists, although none of the studies was systematic, and images were often poorly recorded. A unique dichotomy exists in Torres Strait rock- art: paintings and stencils have only been recorded in the Western and Central islands, while engravings are restricted to the East- ern islands (McNiven and David 2004). Recording Rock Paintings in Torres Strait In 2000, the first systematic rock painting recording project using digital technology was undertaken at Dauan (the Kabadul Kula rock painting site) in the Top Western islands (McNiven, David, and Brayer 2000; McNiven, David, and Brady 2002; McNiven et al. 2004). The ex- posed nature of the boulder there, and its paintings, and their close proximity to the coastline made them suscepti- ble to extensive coastal processes (e.g., water and salt dam- age), thereby creating ideal conditions to test the capabili- ties of computer enhancement. Computer enhancement techniques were applied to several paintings that could not be identified or categorized because of deterioration, dam- age, or fading (called "indistinct paintings" here). When digital photographs of these paintings were manipulated using Adobe Photoshop, a significant number were en- hanced sufficiently, allowing us to classify each painting ac- cording to its formal attributes (hereafter a "determinate" painting; e.g., a turtle, canoe, or triangle). Some of these recovered images were used to identify patterns in design forms between Dauan and sw Papua New Guinea that re- flected interaction previously documented through oral traditions (Brady 2006). Following this successful project, other Western and Central Torres Strait Islander and Abo- riginal communities invited Ian McNiven, Bruno David, and the author to visit their islands to survey and record rock paintings using the digital photography and comput- er enhancement technique. These community- based rock painting recording projects developed into the author's doctoral research on design form patterning in Torres Strait rock paintings (Brady 2006). Over four years of survey and recording, a total of 983 paintings were formally identified from eight Western is- lands, one Central island, and one site at the tip of Cape York (298 paintings remain too deteriorated or faded to identify or categorize even after computer enhancement and were excluded from analysis). Torres Strait rock paint- ings mostly occur on large boulders found at low-lying coastal locations, exposed on flat plains, at the base, mid- point, or top of slopes, or in rockshelters. Given time re- strictions for fieldwork, only rock paintings from the West- ern and Central islands were documented. Monochrome paintings (red, white, yellow, mulberry, pink, black, or blue) dominate the Torres Strait regional assemblage (97.4%), with red paintings most prevalent (91.7%) (table i). Bichrome paintings (red and white, red and yel- low, mulberry and white) account for only 2.6% of all im- ages. Information regarding the temporal nature of the</page><page sequence="4">366 Documenting and Analyzing Rock Paintings from Australia with Digital Photography/Brady Figure 1.

Although computer enhancement of those images still clearly visible with the naked eye may seem redundant, clarification of some of the more intricate elements of the paintings was needed for comparative pur- poses with earlier recordings of the same images (see be- low). Only one island's rock paintings were not recorded dig- itally In the mid-1980s, members of a Queensland Muse- um expedition documented Ngiangu's rock paintings us- ing conventional film. As time constraints did not allow me to re-record these paintings with a digital camera, scanned slides from the Museum expedition were used in the analy- sis. Apart from this one exception, all rock paintings were recorded digitally using a Nikon Coolpix 990 series cam- era. Most of the art was recorded at 3.34 megapixels (the highest resolution available at the time of fieldwork). Pho- tographs of panels and individual paintings were always taken during daylight hours. Photographs were taken with and without flash, from various angles, and with and with- out standard International Federation of Rock Art Organi- zations color calibration scales (Bednarik 1995). The digi- tal camera was positioned with its focal plane as close to parallel to the surface bearing the painting as possible. The entire decorated rock surface was systematically pho- tographed with overlapping images. Each site was inspect- ed to record any trace of pigment to ensure that all paint- ings were recorded, even those that had suffered consider- able damage and were indistinct to the naked eye. An im- portant benefit to using digital photography is the large quantity of photographs that can be taken at low cost. Ad- ditionally, digital photography allows for rapid communi- cation of results directly to the indigenous communities, a key element of our community- based research projects (e.g., Brady 2006; David et al. 2004). Digital images were imported to Adobe Photoshop 7.0. The following commands were used to enhance faded monochrome rock paintings: Saturation, Selective Color, Curves, Hue, Levels, Brightness, Contrast, and Channel Mixer. These commands may be used to perform a variety of functions, such as increasing the intensity of selected col- ors, adjusting the tints of colors in the image, and creating greater contrasts between the background colors of the rock and the paintings. These manipulated images can be converted to black and white to highlight additional features. In this process, the Magic Wand command in Adobe Photoshop is used to select the color of the rock painting and convert it to black, while the background is converted to white (fig. 2). This method can also be used for bichrome, polychrome, and superimposed images where different shades of grey ac- commodate additional colors or paintings. Each color or painting is converted separately, and then overlaid to rep- resent the bichrome, polychrome, or superimposed paint- ings (figs. 3, 4). This particular approach to rock painting enhancement represents a systematic conversion method superior to manual tracing of the design onto paper. It is important to recognize that in all computer enhancement projects, the values associated with each enhancement should be record- ed so that other researchers know exactly what transforma- tions have been undertaken, allowing independent assess- ments and further testing of the results. Individual paint- ings are usually displayed in a three-picture sequence: orig- inal, color- enhanced, and black and white (and grey) con- version. Limitations to the computer enhancement method re- sult from the context of the painting. For example, some of the red paintings from Torres Strait are difficult to distin- guish from leached red iron oxide on the rock panel. While computer enhancement may be able to define the image that was painted on the rock, the black and white conver- sion becomes much more difficult if the red painting and</page><page sequence="6">368 Documenting and Analyzing Rock Paintings from Australia with Digital Photography/Brady Figure 2.

In some cases, changing the color of an image (e.g., adjusting the hue of a red painting so that it appears blue) makes the painting stand out more clearly against a background of similar col- or (fig. 5). Computer Enhancement of Torres Strait Rock Paintings As noted above, computer enhancement techniques were applied to the entire Torres Strait rock painting as- semblage. While the enhancement results from individual pictures have significant implications for the documenta- tion of Islander and Aboriginal cultural heritage, in the analysis of Torres Strait rock paintings in general, the re- gion-wide application of this method has also produced noteworthy results.

During Haddon's 1898 visit to the kwod (men's area) at Pulu Islet (off the coast of Mabuyag), he recorded: [a] large rock with an overhanging smooth surface facing the kwod. . . [o]n this surface are some nearly effaced paint- ings in red of various animals and other objects, such as a cassowary, spoon-bill (tapur), curlew (karuri), crayfish (ka- iar), canoe, and dugong-platform. There are also some handprints made by placing the outstretched palm and fin- gers on the rock, and spitting powdered charcoal mixed with water round the hand. . .1 was informed the men used to sit on a mat under the shelter of a stone as a protection from the sun, and then might make the pictographs, which I understood had no serious meaning (Haddon 1904a: 4). In 2001, Ian J. McNiven, Bruno David, and the Goemulgal community documented the same boulder (identified by the Goemulgal asMenjjuzi Kula) as part of a larger Goemulgal cultural heritage project (the results of this project, though unpublished, were submitted as final reports to Environment Australia and Coastcare Australia by McNiven and colleagues in 2002, and David and col- leagues in 2003, respectively). Initial observation revealed no visible trace of any stencils and only a few heavily dete- riorated paintings. The computer enhancement of digital photographs revealed several paintings, some of which were partially or completely obscured by thick black lichen growth. The paintings included a bird (curlew?), a canoe, a possible dugong-platform, and an infilled non-geometric shape (fig. 6). In McNiven and his colleagues' final report</page><page sequence="8">370 Documenting and Analyzing Rock Paintings from Australia with Digital Photography/Brady Figure 6. Pulu: computer enhancement of a canoe (center), infilled non-geometric shape (top), and an extended X-struc- ture (bottom right). The original photograph is on the left. to Environment Australia in 2002, their computer en- hancement of one of Haddon's black and white close-up photographs of the east face of the boulder revealed ap- proximately five hand stencils. Therefore, computer en- hancement was used successfully to verify Haddon's de- scriptions of some of the rock paintings he recorded in the late 1800s, although several were still too deteriorated to recover. Located only a short distance from Menguzi Kula (ap- proximately 50 m further inland) are two additional rock painting sites. Haddon sketched and reproduced a total of seven paintings (five anthropomorphs, a waterspout, and an hourglass shape [identified by Haddon as a drum]) from these two sites in 1898 (Haddon 1904a: 5). Docu- mentation of these paintings in 2001 revealed that they were in good condition, although computer enhancement added greater detail to some of the individual design ele- ments used in the waterspout. In one case a design element not recorded by Haddon (a headdress consisting of a downward-curved line from the head of an anthropo- morph) was retrieved using computer enhancement. KIRRIRI Haddon documented a series of rock paintings from Kirriri in the south- Western islands. A picture of a canoe is used here to illustrate the increased clarity our method brings to the image. Haddon's 1888 sketch of the hull of the canoe (fig. 7, top) is not clear. Computer enhance- ment of this image in 2003 revealed an upward curved line design rather than a closed rectangle. When the digital photograph was taken, the right end of the canoe (featur- ing a crescent-shaped design) had been obscured by white lichen growth, but with the computer enhanced picture and Haddon's sketch we can visualize the full form of the canoe. Other pictures at this site, including another canoe, a turtle, an anthropomorph, and several geometric shapes have also benefited from such computer enhancement. DAUAN At Dauan, the northernmost Torres Strait island with documented rock paintings, one site (Kabadul Kula, or Dauan 1) has been recorded twice- in 2000 and again in 2004 using a higher-resolution digital camera than was previously available (Nikon Coolpix 5700, 5.0 megapix- els). The most recent work updated the previous record- ings undertaken by McNiven, David, and Brayer (2000), and revealed three previously undetectable paintings (a cir- cle variant, a lizard, and a diamond variant). Three indis- tinct paintings were enhanced sufficiently to identify the images, while other previously identified paintings had some design elements greatly enhanced. A key picture that had its design elements clarified through computer en- hancement is a canoe originally identified by McNiven and colleagues (2004: 244) as having a crescent-shaped sail that resembles a crab-claw canoe sail- a design feature characteristic of trading vessels (lakatoi) involved in the well-established trading network that operated between Port Moresby and the Papuan Gulf region (Dutton 1982) (fig. 8). While the implications of this design feature are apparent in the context of interregional interaction in the Torres Strait and southern coastal Papua New Guinea (see Brady 2006; McNiven et al. 2004), documentation of this</page><page sequence="9">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 31, 2006 371 Figure 7.

They were di- rected to a large granite boulder, identified by the Mualgal community as Turao Kula, or "Lookout Rock," where some visible rock paintings are located, as well as various artifacts (e.g., marine shell, animal bone, use-worn ochre, charcoal and European materials) scattered on the surface at the</page><page sequence="11">Journal of Field Archaeology /Vol. 31, 2006 373 Table 2.

The entire boulder was photographed to see if any other faded images could be discerned. After enhancement, a small panel of paintings (previously un- known to the community and invisible to the naked eye), consisting of four palm trees with an anthropomorph climbing between two of them, became visible (fig. 9). The panel of paintings was identified by Mualgal Elders as representing a scene from the popular Mualgal oral tradi- tion about a boy (Goba) and his father on a fishing trip. While on this trip, the boy and the father were attacked by headhunters from a neighbouring island; the father was killed, but the boy survived by climbing and hiding in the trees (see Lawrie 1970: 45-46 and David et al. 2004 for further details and archaeological research on the Goba oral tradition). This same panel of paintings was recorded in the 1940s by Kylie Tennant, a travel writer who docu- mented a panel of paintings consisting of "a long nosed man climbing a coconut tree. There was a row of coconut trees gracefully drawn and true, not just indications, but verifiable coconut trees" (Tennant 1959: 193). The deteri- oration of this panel over a 60 -year period gives an indica- tion of the rate at which paintings fade on exposed boul- ders in Torres Strait. Regional Rock Painting Patterns While computer enhancement of digital photographs of individual rock paintings can be used to contribute to a more complete inventory of pictures from a site, this tech- nique can also be applied to studies of regional patterning of rock paintings. Of the 983 identifiable rock paintings recorded from Torres Strait, 113 pictures could be formal- ly categorized only after computer enhancement (table 2). A pattern emerged from the analyses based on the number of paintings (by island) categorized using only the en- hancement technique. The mid- western and top Western islands (from Zurath northwards) accounted for 90 paint- ings (79.6%) while the south-Western islands and Somer- set only featured 23 (20.4%) paintings categorized using this method. These results imply a discrepancy in the num- ber of paintings that were categorized using computer en- hancement between the south-Western islands and Somer- set on the one hand, and those from the rest of the Torres Strait on the other (fig. 10, table 3). This discrepancy may be explained by differences in Western Torres Strait geolo- gy, if the relationship between rock type and painting preservation is considered. The Western Torres Strait is divided into two main geo- logical units: the Badu Suite of granite (consisting of vari- ous types of granite including "leucocratic biotite granite, hornblende biotite granite, granodiorite and aplite") and the Torres Strait Volcanics Group (predominantly "rhy- olitic welded tuffs with minor agglomerate, volcanic brec-</page><page sequence="12">374 Documenting and Analyzing Rock Paintings from Australia with Digital Photography/Brady Figure 10.

The former is found predominantly in the mid-Western and Top Western islands, while the latter is restricted to the south-Western islands. The Somerset rock paintings were produced on sandstone (fig. io). Since rock paintings from this region have been assigned a relatively uniform and recent age (e.g., a few hundred years as a result of the effects of harsh</page><page sequence="13">Journal of Field Archaeology /Vol. 31, 2006 375 Figure 11. Computer enhancement of an arrow (original above). coastal exposure), it becomes clear that not all rock paint- ings documented from this region are deteriorating at the same rate. Rock paintings produced on granite are deteri- orating more quickly than those painted on Torres Strait Volcanics and sandstone. Thus, while other regional pat- terns in Torres Strait rock- art are evident (e.g., paintings recorded only in the Western islands, and engravings re- stricted to the Eastern islands, see above), computer en- hancement can reveal significant data for identifying fur- ther factors associated with rock painting preservation. Enhancement of individual paintings can also con- tribute to our understanding of regional patterning in Tor- res Strait rock paintings. Prior to computer enhancement, the distribution of arrow motifs was restricted to the south-Western islands and Somerset. Our enhancement techniques, however, revealed two heavily deteriorated ar- rows from Mua in the mid-Western islands that had been partially covered over by other paintings (fig. ii). The presence of the two arrows at Mua indicates that this mo- tif, originally thought to be restricted to the south-Western and Somerset region, had a wider distribution than previ- ously thought.</page><page sequence="14">376 Documenting and Analyzing Rock Paintings from Australia with Digital Photography/Brady Figure 12. Top) Haddon's (1893) color sketches of dancers with feather headdresses performing during the death dance at Pulu; Bottom) Computer enhancement (right) of an anthropomorph from Kirriri with a curved feather headdress that extends upwards and downwards from a central point on the head. Secondly, a distinctive form of headdress that was once thought to be restricted to the rock paintings from the mid-Western islands was discovered outside this sub-group of Western islands for the first time. Haddon (1893: 153-154) described this design element after observing a death dance at Pulu in 1898, and noted that the head dec- oration of the dancers consisted of either a single curved "filament" or a series of filaments that were decorated at in- tervals with white feathers. These decorated filaments ei- ther extended upwards from the forehead or extended up- wards and downwards from a central point on the fore- head. The latter type had only been documented in rock paintings from Mua (Brady et al. 2004), and, to the best of my knowledge, ethnographically from Pulu (fig. 12).</page><page sequence="15">Journal of Field Arch neology /Vol. 31, 2006 377 Computer enhancement revealed the existence of this dec- orative filament on a painting of a heavily deteriorated an- thropomorph from Kirriri, indicating that this design con- vention was not restricted solely to the mid-Western group of islands. Discussion The results presented from Torres Strait demonstrate that computer enhancement of digital photographs has sig- nificant implications for how rock paintings will be record- ed and analyzed in the future. The multiscalar nature of this technique allows significant conclusions about a rock painting assemblage that would, most likely, have been missed using a conventional recording process. The value of this technique as a recording tool is clearly demonstrat- ed in the recovery and formal classification of 113 paint- ings (based on identifiable design elements) that were orig- inally thought to be indistinct. This substantial number of paintings represents a considerable portion (11.5%) of the entire identifiable painting assemblage from this region. Haddon's early recording of rock paintings from two Tor- res Strait islands (Pulu and Kirriri) consisted of only a few images, yet assessment of these images illustrates the vary- ing rates of degrees of deterioration of rock paintings from different islands, and the increased clarity this technique brings to faded images. The social significance associated with some rock paintings can also be recovered through computer enhancement. The distribution of specific motif forms (arrows and headdresses) and the documentation of design elements (e.g., crab-claw canoe sails) that can be linked with an ethnographically- documented sail design from vessels involved in a trading network over 200 km to the east, have implications for the way we understand in- ter-island and interregional interaction in Torres Strait. Furthermore, this study of rock painting preservation in Torres Strait revealed the relationship between the preser- vation of paintings and the geological substrate on which they were painted. The rock painting/geological substrate relationship is significant in the broader context of rock painting taphon- omy. Bednarik (1994) has described some of the main taphonomic factors associated with rock-art (e.g., tech- niques, pigment or paint types, locations, media, climates, etc.). For Pleistocene rock- art in particular, he stresses the significance of site location in understanding taphonomic processes. While all taphonomic factors are important for documenting and interpreting the rock painting record, the most important factors for understanding the deterio- ration of Torres Strait rock paintings are geologically- based, if we are to judge from the relatively uniform age of the paintings, similar site locations (and therefore similar damage, e.g., salt and water from coastal exposure), and use of a single color in over 90% of documented paintings. Perhaps the most significant result of our research con- cerns the indigenous custodians of the rock paintings. In the case of Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal communi- ties, computer enhancement of deteriorated images pro- vides a detailed record of the artistic activity of their ances- tors. The results generated from this non- destructive recording technique demonstrate a new method that can be used in the preservation and conservation of indigenous cultural heritage. The cultural implications of this tech- nique are found in the role some recovered paintings play in the understanding of past interaction with neighboring groups, and in the education of younger generations of lo- cal indigenous groups about their cultural history (Brady et al. 2003). Conclusion The role and significance of computer enhancement ap- plications in the documentation and analysis of rock paint- ings have changed considerably over the last two decades. This method has important implications for indigenous communities, archaeologists, cultural heritage managers, and rock- art researchers. The development of this tech- nique, from its origins in specialized software used to en- hance slides of rock paintings, to commercially- available software programs used in combination with digital pho- tography, has allowed for considerable progress towards its inclusion in the rock- art recording repertoire. Indeed, tech- nological advances over the last four years alone have made available the most powerful recording tool ever to be em- ployed in the documentation of faded rock paintings. Fur- thermore, with these technological advances and the in- creasing inclusion of computer enhancement as a recording strategy, we can now move from individual, site- specific applications to the systematic use of this technique to doc- ument regional assemblages of rock paintings. In regions such as the Torres Strait this method has revealed a more complete rock painting record than was previously antici- pated.
