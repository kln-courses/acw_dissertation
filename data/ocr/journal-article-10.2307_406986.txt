<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROGER CROCKETT Texas A&amp;M University Raimund's Der Verschwender: The Illusion of Freedom It has been a popular contention in Raimund scholarship that Der Verschwen- der, the author's last play and one of his most successful ones, represents a break with traditional Baroque determinism. While in earlier dramas a hierarchy of supernatural beings intervened repeatedly to rescue mortal protagonists from their own errors and guarantee them thereby a safe, marionette-like existence, Der Verschwender is said to be the play in which Raimund cuts the strings. Whereas hosts of good and evil spirits pull the mortals of prior comedies in opposite directions while using them as pawns in their own private power struggles, the conflict in Der Verschwender is seen as strictly internal, fought within the soul of the spendthrift Flottwell and off limits to any inter- vention from above. Much speaks in favor of this contention. The relatively small amount of stage time devoted to the supernatural frame and the fact that Cheristane does not appear until the tenth scene emphasize Flottwell's preeminent position.' The fact that only the fairy Cheristane and the spirit Azur appear on stage, in contrast to the large number of allegorical and mythological characters in Raimund's other plays, with the exception of Der Alpenkonig und der Men- schenfeind, is a further indication of a shift in emphasis onto the human experience.2 Foremost among the arguments for a humanistic interpretation, however, is the decree of Fate (capitalized when it refers to the anthropomorphic author of the decree), an apparent declaration of Raimund's intention to place Flottwell's salvation or ruin into the latter's own hands. Concerning the spendthrift's future, Azur reads in "des Schicksals Buch": "Kein Fatum herrsch auf seinen Lebenswegen, Er selber bring sich Unheil oder Segen. Er selbst vermag sich nur allein zu warnen, Mit Ungliick kann er selbst sich nur umgarnen, 184</page><page sequence="2">CROCKETT: Raimund's Der Verschwender 185 Und da er frei von allen Schicksalsketten, Kann ihn sein Ich auch nur von Schmach erretten."' If Raimund has indeed set Flottwell free from all supernatural intervention, then we are not only seeing the first of his dramatic principals to be so released, but we are also witnessing a rather radical shift in philosophy by the author. Was the destruction of the supernatural frame in Viennese folk comedy, a process which Nestroy would later complete, given impetus by the- same dramatist who just a few years earlier had found the Baroque tradition in disarray and dedicated himself to reviving it? Most scholars who have dealt with the question at all seem to agree that it was. Writing in 1940, Heinz Kindermann remarked about Cheristane's powerless- ness and concluded: "[D]er Realismus dieser neuen Raimundschen Welt- und Menschensicht verbietet jeglichen Eingriff der Geister- und Feenwelt in die menschliche Endentscheidung."4 Three years later noted Raimund scholar Walter Erdmann wrote in this same antifatalistic vein: "Sein eigenes Schicksal kann der Mensch nur selbst bestimmen. Der Mensch ist, wie es Cheristane ausdriickt, frei von allen Schicksalsketten geworden, und nur er selbst kann einen aufwirts oder abwirts fiihrenden Weg bestimmen."5 He saw this new freedom, both a danger and a blessing for mankind, not as a sudden change but as the result of a gradual development at which Raimund first hinted in Der Bauer als Millioniir. It is this power to choose between surrendering to the pleasures of life on the one hand and allying oneself "mit den Cheristanen- kriften" on the other, he asserted, which binds Raimund to the Romantic movement and in particular to Novalis.6 More recently Giinther Erken also noted a weakening of the supernatural foundation: "Das Feenreich verk6rpert keine allmichtige Instanz mehr, sondern laiBt Raum fiir ein unbestimmteres Schicksal, das kaum definitiver zu bezeichnen ist als mit dem 'Lauf der Welt.""' One somewhat puzzling formulation of this interpretation is made by John Michalski: "Fairies and ghosts play a minor part in Raimund's last play. The fairy Cheristane and her assistant, the protective spirit Azur, are unobtrusive. They have no power to change the course of fate, and can only use their good services to persuade. Cheristane's and Azur's absence would in no way alter the course of the action."8 That Azur is far from unobtrusive will be demonstrated, and it is precisely because persuasion is impossible in the case of Flottwell that Cheristane through Azur resorts to stronger tactics. Leaning in the opposite direction is Rainer Urbach, who acknowledges some divine influence on Flottwell, if only conditional: "Flottwell hingt be- dingt noch von den G6ttern ab, zumindest steht er unter dem Schutz des blauen Himmels."9 The notable disagreement with the prevailing opinion, however, is voiced by Frank Schaumann. He perceives comments made by Cheristane concerning Flottwell's "kiinftig Los" and Azur's intention to save the spendthrift as running counter to the idea of freedom: "Vielmehr scheint es, als ob Raimund seinen eigenen Primissen untreu geworden ist, und in dem Bettler eine Figur geschaffen hat, die der von Cheristane ausgesprochenen</page><page sequence="3">186 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Spring 1985 Freiheitsidee zuwiderliuft."'0 Schaumann's observations, made briefly at the conclusion of a discussion of Azur's function as the beggar, need to be examined at greater length, because the issue of freedom in Der Verschwender remains problematic. Freedom is a matter of degree. A dog on a leash is freer than one in a narrow cage and may have much territory to explore before coming to the end of its tether. Yet measured against that of a dog in an open field, the freedom of the leashed dog is only an illusion. This example, though prosaic, is a valid illustration of the situation in which the spendthrift finds himself, in contrast to that of Raimund's other principal characters. It is true that Flottwell has been given more slack than his counterparts in earlier plays. It is questionable, however, that he enjoys the degree of freedom which most Raimund scholars contend, and which the decree of Fate, "frei von allen Schicksalsketten," seems to guarantee him. Fate's decree is actually directed more against Cheristane than against Flottwell, a fact which suggests that the traditional conflict between super- natural beings with humans as their pawns is once again at work. Cheristane is a fairy sent to earth by Queen Illmaha with a string of pearls. Contained in each is a benefaction which Cheristane is to use at her discretion to aid worthy mortals. Three years earlier, when she still had many undissolved pearls left, Cheristane had seen and fallen in love with the seventeen-year-old Julius Flottwell. Disguised as a peasant girl, the fairy had been meeting Julius regularly while secretly dissolving pearl after pearl to increase his family's fortune. Yet Cheristane has erred in the belief that wealth would bring social and moral stability to her beloved Julius. He is possessed of a wild capricious- ness and an appetite for life which, combined with his newly acquired riches, has transformed him into an incurable spendthrift. With her power on earth near an end, the lovesick Cheristane longs to warn Julius of the ruin that the future, which she has the power to foresee, will bring him if he remains on his present course. It is at this point that Fate issues its decree calculated to stop Cheristane from intervening, a decree which the fairy recognizes as punishment for her irresponsible behavior in falling in love with a mortal. Any analysis of the decree is complicated by the fact that fate can be defined in a narrow as well as a broad sense in Der Verschwender: that is, as the unseen, conscious entity Fatum, or as any supernatural intervention which affects Flottwell's life. In the narrow sense we have that presence which Giinther Erken correctly described as indefinite. It never appears, nor are the limits of its power ever defined. In the universe of Cheristane, Azur and Illmaha, as elsewhere in Raimund, justification for absolute power is never sought, but rather passively accepted. As Volker Klotz observes, there are undeniable parallels between Raimund's supernatural world and the political power structure in pre-March Vienna. "Was den Leuten im Alltag widerfuhr, begegnete ihnen, metaphorisch umgesetzt, in Raimunds Stiicken wieder: halt- los und ohne Richtschnur einer unberechenbaren, anonymen Welt ausgesetzt zu sein, worin gigantische Kimpfe zwischen unbekannten Machten nach un-</page><page sequence="4">CROCKETT: Raimund's Der Verschwender 187 bekannten Regeln ausgetragen werden."" This Fate is just such a veiled, arbitrary, in retrospect we can say "Kafkaesque" high authority. We have only its written word, but from that text and from comments which Cheristane makes about it we can deduce a calculating and vindictive nature. If Raimund intended to show Fate freeing humankind from its dictates, he has done so less than convincingly with this narrowly defined character. What we are shown instead is a very active, discerning Fate, which makes conscious deci- sions and records them in a book to give them permanence. On the other hand, one does not have to look far to find a situation on the Viennese folk stage in which human beings are truly free and totally dependent upon themselves. In 1834, the same year in which Der Verschwender appeared, Nestroy wrote his satirical sequel to the highly successful Lumpazivagabundus comedy: Die Familien Zwirn, Knieriem und Leim oder der Weltuntergangstag. Here the character Fatum, far from keeping written records of his decrees, appears as a sleepy old man, too lazy to listen to the petitions of his supplicants: Fatum: Ich wei3 alles. (Vortretend, fiir sich) Ich wei3 gar nichts, aber ich bin zu faul, die ganze Geschichte anzuh6ren. Es ist etwas Prichtiges, das Schicksal zu sein, man tut rein gar nichts, und am Ende hei6t es bei allem, was geschieht, das Schicksal hat es getan.'2 Here with typical Nestroy acrimony is portrayed the ultimate bankruptcy of divine guidance. Mankind is truly "frei von allen Schicksalsketten," uncom- fortably so, because along with absolute freedom comes absolute responsibil- ity. The same cannot be said for Raimund's Verschwender. Fate's decision not to intervene is a conscious choice, and it is also a motivated choice if Cheris- tane's statement is to be believed: Mir ist bekannt des Schicksals strenger Spruch, der, mich zu strafen, tief ersonnen ist. (II,363) Raimund's Fate, in contrast to Nestroy's, is by no means giving up once and for all the right to intervene in the affairs of mortals. Coincidentally, in this case, Fate is angry with Cheristane and has chosen to avenge itself on her through the object of her love, Julius Flottwell. Thus the mortal has indeed become a pawn in a supernatural power struggle, just as Lottchen had been in Das Madchen aus der Feenwelt, Hermione in Die gefesselte Phantasie, Alzinde in Moisasurs Zauberfluch and Phalarius, Ewald and Simplizius in Die unheilbringende Zauberkrone. In Der Verschwender, however, this jockeying for influence by fairies, kobolds, and good and evil allegories has supposedly been eliminated a priori. Not only the shadowy personification of destiny, the author of the edict, is to refrain from influencing the spendthrift's life. The word Fatum in the line: "Kein Fatum herrsch auf seinen Lebenswegen" applies to the lesser spirits as well. Cheristane and Azur acknowledge that it applies to them. Cheristane does not dare warn Flottwell of the poverty she sees in his future because she be-</page><page sequence="5">188 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Spring 1985 lieves she is enjoined from doing so by the decree. Thus in a broad sense, fate must be defined within the framework of this play as any supernatural intervention. During the three years in which Cheristane was increasing her proteg6's wealth and with it his potentially ruinous fault, there was no attempt to halt her intervention. Now that a drastic measure is needed to undo the damage and effect Flottwell's rescue, Fate decrees it impossible. The spendthrift is left to his own devices at a point when his vice has become too deeply ingrained in his character to be removed without some sort of radical assistance. Fate knows this, as does Cheristane, who exclaims that Flottwell could give away a world in order to prolong the life of a fly. The spendthrift's destiny has been placed in his own hands by a retributive act precisely at the critical time. Thus Fate's non-intervention decree is itself an intervention to insure that the course of Flottwell's life, predetermined by his character flaw, will hasten to its disastrous conclusion. Far from decreeing itself out of existence, Fate is still very much in control. Indigenous to every Raimund play characterized by a curse is a condition or series thereof which, if fulfilled, releases the protagonist from the power of the curse. Lacrimosa, for example, faces banishment unless her daughter Lottchen disavows wealth and marries a poor man who must be her first love. In Hermione's kingdom the evil sisters Vipria and Arrogantia will remain all-powerful unless the queen, who has vowed to wed a poet, marries a king who is fit to rule. Moisasur curses Alzinde and her kingdom until such time as she weeps tears of joy in the arms of death. Phalares, wearer of the pernicious magic crown, remains invincible unless three seemingly impossible conditions are met. In all these cases the conditions are placed on mortals, but their success or failure becomes the active concern of supernatural beings on both sides of good and evil. The hapless mortals waver back and forth between influences from opposing parties until good triumphs over evil and the conditions are met against heavy odds. In Der Verschwender, however, a significant change takes place in the nature of the curse and of the combatants. The curse is no longer imposed from without as in earlier plays, but rather it is a preexisting internal one, a manifestation of Flottwell's character flaw. Technically there should be neither combatants nor a battle, because the spendthrift must be left alone to decide his own destiny. The condition of free will placed on Flottwell has its predecessor in the ninepin scene in Das Madchen aus der Feenwelt. There we learn from the allegorical figure Hafi that a spell has been cast on the ring which Karl will try to win. The ring will give its wearer unlimited wealth. "Wenn er aber diesen Ring neun Tage besitzt, erfiillen ihn die Geister mit dem h6chsten MenschenhaB, und er ruhet nicht, bis er sich und Tausende zu Grunde richtet. Nur wenn er ihn vor dieser Zeit freiwillig von sich wirft, ist er gerettet ..." (I, 237; emphasis mine). With or without the curse of self-destructive misan- thropy, the presence of the ring in Karl's hands insures Lottchen's misery and</page><page sequence="6">CROCKETT: Raimund's Der Verschwender 189 Lakrimosa's banishment. Karl must be convinced to rid himself of it. The method which Raimund chooses to accomplish this leaves little doubt that the important condition of free will has been circumvented." Credibility is strained by the intense cajoling, threatening and ultimate show of force with which the allegory Zufriedenheit defeats Hafi and "convinces" Karl to throw away the ring. Any speculation that this confrontational scene could be inter- preted as the theatrical externalization of an internal conflict within Karl is refuted by Lottchen's sudden, radical, externally motivated change of mind about following Karl into wealth. That she ceases in mid-argument to love him unconditionally can only be explained by the magical intervention of Zufriedenheit, who does not hesitate "im Interesse ihrer Wirksamkeit sich zu verkleiden und zu verstellen, List zu gebrauchen und Haf3 zu erzeugen, zu intrigieren und zu liigen um der Liebe willen."'4 The allegorical figure plays her trump card by casting a spell on Lottchen, which renders her unable to look upon wealth. Although Karl is technically free to choose, the outcome is all but predetermined. Between Lottchen, whom he loves unconditionally, and wealth, which he only sought as a means of obtaining Lottchen, only one choice is really possible. That Raimund would take liberties with the concept of freedom in a drama which makes no pretense of being anything but a traditional magic play is not surprising. That he resorted to the same tactic in Der Verschwender, however, a play which begins with the promise of human freedom and responsibility, sug- gests that Raimund was unable or unwilling to dispense with the comfort and security of a deus ex machina ending. On the one hand he has constructed a vicious circle from which there should be no possible escape. A wealthy man is driven to prodigal behavior by a character weakness exacerbated by the ease with which Cheristane's benefaction has multiplied his wealth. With salvation from within as well as from without rendered impossible, Flottwell should have to follow his inclinations and reap the disastrous consequences. On the other hand, Raimund does not allow this to happen. If in the case of the fisherman Karl, Raimund had maintained at least the letter of the law while violating its spirit, he now takes the final step of circumventing the law entirely. By the play's conclusion both the spirit and the letter of the law lie in shambles. Lining up on the traditional side of good in the war for Flottwell's salvation are Cheristane with her ruse, the product of her "liebgequilter Geist," and her proxy Azur, determined and armed with an arsenal of deceptive ploys. Facing them on the "battlefield," in place of the evil demons and allegories of previous plays, stands the mortal himself, vulnerable and unaware of the presence of the supernatural forces which are fighting against and ultimately for him. Can this battle really be a legitimate circumvention of Fate's decree? Cheristane has won a fair fight only if she has left intact Flottwell's freedom: not only his freedom not to reform, but also his freedom to fail and bear the consequences. One senses, however, before the first figurative blow is struck, that this is not going to be a fair fight.</page><page sequence="7">190 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Spring 1985 No longer capable of helping her beloved Julius herself, because her power on earth is due to end with the dissolution of her last magic pearl, Cheristane appoints the guardian spirit Azur to remain near Flottwell as her surrogate. The spirit takes the form of the spendthrift in his fiftieth year, a year which the latter willingly relinquished to Cheristane without knowing its significance. The plan is for the fifty-year-old, destitute Flottwell to beg as much money from the young, wealthy Flottwell as he can in one year. Azur accomplishes this, gathering and saving all the alms to be returned to the giver in the moment of greatest need and despair. In this way Flottwell's "Ich" in the form of a Doppelgdnger can preserve him from the otherwise inevitable poverty at age fifty. Raimund had employed the Doppelgdnger motif successfully in two previ- ous comedies. Concerning the allegories Youth and Age in Das Mddchen aus der Feenwelt, who reveal to Wurzel his past and future condition, Laurence Harding writes: "These allegories have a dramatic existence of their own, but they are also an inseparable part of the main character's personality."'" These are the requisites of a believable Doppelganger, and they later characterize the Astragalus-Rappelkopf relationship in Der Alpenkonig und der Menschen- feind. There the motif is no longer relegated to an episode, but is central to the plot as the medium through which the misanthrope is confronted with his antisocial behavior and ultimately cured. Astragalus, who takes over Rappel- kopf's body, also duplicates the voice and attitude of the original. Rappelkopf, temporarily housed in the body of his brother-in-law Silberkern, has quite literally been split into two parts. His soul can only watch helplessly as his own thoughts, wishes, actions and feelings are reproduced in minute detail by his Doppelgdnger. Here there is no doubt that Rappelkopf's double is indeed an extension of his "Ich." "Damit lost sich das Spiegelbild von dem Urbild los und handelt frei" writes Heinz Politzer.'6 He acts independently, but his actions are determined by the psyche of the original. Each movement, each word, though technically no longer controlled by the misanthrope, are movements the latter would make, words he would say if he were in control. This is far from the relationship Raimund creates between Flottwell and Azur. Azur is exceedingly unconvincing as Flottwell's "Ich." He is a shallow Doppelganger because the likeness goes no deeper than physical appearance. Azur appears as Flottwell is destined to appear at age fifty; however, behind the exterior is not the future Flottwell but the present Azur. Raimund has taken a major step beyond Astragalus-Rappelkopf in the creation of Azur. No longer does the Doppelgdnger have merely an independent existence beyond the control of the original, now he has a mind of his own. Azur is indeed an intricate character. He is Flottwell's foil, ultimately his savior, but he is not his "Ich." In the third act we find the real Flottwell poor but with his dignity intact. He reacts to his poverty with resignation and does not wish to be a burden on his former servants or take any more from them than they freely offer. However, Azur in the guise of the beggar is aggressive, burdensome, dis-</page><page sequence="8">CROCKETT: Raimund's Der Verschwender 191 honest, and not above using intimidation to achieve his ends. The valuable necklace which Flottwell hurls out the window in a moment of rage is spirited off by the watchful beggar before it can be retrieved moments later by the contrite spendthrift. This is hardly an example of alms willingly given, nor is the large sum of money coerced from the anxious Flottwell in the chapel as his rendezvous and flight with Amalie hang in the balance. That Azur's intervention goes far beyond merely playing on the generosity of his protege is confirmed by the spirit's admission in the third act: Ein Jahr lang hab ich den Tribut durch List Und schaudervolle Angst von dir erpre6t. (II, 449) It is clear that Flottwell does little toward his salvation of his own free will. For all intents he is controlled from above. Azur retains his supernatural powers while assuming the form of the mortal. He is capable of materializing and disappearing at will. He has foreknowledge of Flottwell's whereabouts at all times, and he is invisible to everyone but the spendthrift, a fact which enables him to move about in the latter's circles unhindered. Azur knows his protege's weakest points and when and how to attack them. When all else fails he resorts to theft and coercion. In short, he plays the spendthrift like a marionette. While not rendering Flottwell's transgressions inconsequential, Azur's intervention does most definitely alter the course of the action. One loss does remain uncompensated, that of Flottwell's wife and child. It is this discomforting fact which prompted the objection by Raimund's friend, the director Ludwig Schmidt, that a more satisfying ending would have allowed for the return of the child along with the treasure. Raimund replied in his often quoted letter of December 20, 1835, that it was not his intention to reward Flottwell for his misguided generosity. "Nur vor der unverdienten Schmach und dem emp6renden Undanke der Menschen wollte ich ihn geschiitzt wissen" (IV, 499). The loss of Flottwell's family, however tragic, must be kept separate from the loss of his fortune through wastefulness. The latter is documented throughout the second act; whereas the former is reported long after the fact in the most general terms: "Ich habe Gattin, Kind und all mein Gut durch eigne Schuld verloren" (II, 419). We are further told that they were lost on a journey to South America which he had undertaken against his wife's wishes. However, this is all the information we are ever given about them, and there is no basis for the assumption that Flottwell's impulsive generosity, the cause of Cheristane's concern and Azur's intervention, was the reason for the loss of his family. This loss was caused, in fact, by a very different type of fate than that which consciously manipulates the spendthrift's life during the one year on which the play's action concentrates. The fate which took Flottwell's wife and child, the great equalizer which applies the carpenter's plane to rich and poor alike, belongs to the unfathomable mysteries of the universe which even the mighty Fatum cannot decree out of existence. It is this incomprehensible fate, that for Nestroy played such an important role in the guise of "der Zufall," which Raimund now de-emphasizes.</page><page sequence="9">192 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Spring 1985 It is interesting and significant to this study that Raimund allows so little to be made of this most tragic chapter in Flottwell's life. In the final monologue among the ruins of the ancestral castle, where the spendthrift laments his foolishness and admits full guilt for his present condition, there are plaints for lost riches and impending misery, but his wife and child are never men- tioned. In Flottwell's joyful reunion with Valentin, Rosa and their children after the return of the treasure, there is a moment of unfulfilled expectation for the audience. Flottwell talks of bringing his former servant's family into his home and paying for the children's education; however, despite this excel- lent opportunity to reflect upon his own lost child, he never does so. We must conclude that Raimund had no interest in developing this subplot and that wife and child were intended to remain peripheral- so much so that the general joy and relief Flottwell feels after the return of part of his former treasure is not tempered by any bittersweet reflections upon them. In defending his position on this matter to Schmidt, Raimund continued: "Der Gedanke mit dem Wiederfinden seiner Tochter ware bey einer andern Anlage des Stiicks gewiB ein sch6ner, versbhnend wirksamer, aber Cheristanens Macht auf Erden endet ja fiir immer, als sie diese, die letzte Prle [sic] opfernd verldl3t. Azur beg[l]eitet ihn nur als sein verarmtes Ich ein Jahr" (IV, 499). Thus we can properly deduce that everything which lies outside of Cheristane's and Azur's power to control is unimportant: the wife, the child, the prodigal dissolution of a fortune and ultimately the nineteen years of freedom in which these disasters occurred. Only the events of that one year when the supernatural powers were in control and the safety net was being woven are significant. The rest remains anecdotal. Precisely by de-emphasizing the loss of Flottwell's family, Raimund is forcing his audience to concentrate all its attention on the events which lie within the power of Azur to manipulate. This is hardly a play about freedom. In spite of all he has lost, Flottwell does not have to pay nearly the full penalty for his sins. On the contrary, his latter years will be spent in comfort. While he will not possess as much as he once did when he was too rich for his own good, he will nevertheless be able to live well and also engage in responsible philanthropy toward Valentin's family. His years as a spendthrift and his brief taste of abject poverty will serve him henceforth as an example and a deterrent to any such future behavior. In modem judicial slang he has received a slap on the wrist. Considering the Biedermeier ideal of contentment and the golden mean, Flottwell is better off now than he was before. From the restless life of an impulsive spendthrift whose wealth and frenetic lifestyle did not translate into true happiness, through a brief sojourn in poverty, Flottwell has arrived at a safe middle ground. He has descended from the hill on which his life, like his ancestral castle, had lain in ruin to join Lottchen, Karl, and Raimund's other redeemed mortals in the figurative "Tal der Zufrie- denheit," as the Alpine cowherds sing the Biedermeier admonition: "Zufrieden muB man sein" (II, 454).</page><page sequence="10">CROCKETT: Raimund's Der Verschwender 193 In contradiction to Fate's decree, Flottwell's "Ich" has not freed him from the tyranny of his vice, which would surely have doomed him to die a beggar, nor has his salvation been free of supernatural intervention. Despite his stated intention to free his mortal protagonist "von allen Schicksalsketten," Raimund seems to have been unable to free himself from his dependence on an ever- watchful providence. Thus he has permitted Cheristane and Azur to circumvent the decree by methodically ignoring it and hiding the transgression behind the veneer of the Doppelginger. Despite an apparent weakening of the super- natural frame and a greater concentration on the human level, Raimund has actually given us nothing significantly different from his earlier magic plays. He has certainly slackened Flottwell's tether and allowed him to stray closer to perdition, but Azur's final appearance in the moment of despair is merely another Baroque deus ex machina. It is an assurance that although man strays, the spirit world is ever on guard to save him from himself and give him a second chance.
