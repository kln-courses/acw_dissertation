THE PILOT AND COPILOT of an experimental V/STOL air- craft reported, on August 25, 1965, an abnormal condition in one of the aircraft systems and were told to make a pre- cautionary landing. Shortly thereafter, an aircraft system failed, and the crew immediately initiated their escape sys- tems. The two seats separated from the aircraft almost si- multaneously, with the aircraft at a speed of 90 knots, in a violent pitch -roll maneuver, fully inverted and slightly nose down, and at an altitude of only 390 ft. Both pilot and copilot had separated from their seats and had fully inflated personnel parachutes at an altitude of 230 ft. The two se- quences are shown in Fig. 1. These remarkable recoveries were possible because of the unique method of parachute stowage and deployment utilized in the North American Aviation LW series of es- cape systems. Development of this series of escape systems began in 1959. The effort resulted from the recognized need for an advanced escape system with new design concepts to satisfy the recovery requirements for: 1. Conventional aircraft at low altitudes with high sink rates and /or adverse attitudes. 2. Flying platform type test beds. 3. V/STOL aircraft. The first of the LW series of escape systems was qualified for the U. S. Army in November 1960. The design of all aircraft escape systems to date, with the exception of the LW series of escape systems, has been such that the recovery capability at altitudes and speeds where most ejections occur is degraded. More specifically, the personnel parachute is not deployed until after sufficient time has been allowed to permit the man to decelerate from V of the aircraft. Therefore, inherent to the de- max sign of these escape systems is an unnecessary time delay at altitudes and speeds where time is most critical and where the majority of ejections occur. Generally, the seat -man mass was allowed to slow down for some time period follow- ing seat aircraft separation, and then the man was released from the seat. Following seat -man separation the para- chute was deployed, usually by an automatic opener. This time from ejection to personnel parachute deployment varies from 2 to 3 sec. The question that led to the LW series escape system con- cept is an obvious one -- why wait 2-3 sec with the attendant loss of recovery capability to deploy the recovery parachute if it can be deployed immediately? The basic design criteria of the LW-3B seat system, there- fore, was to overcome this area of deficiency in escape sys- tems. Two unique changes were incorporated in the LW-3B seat toward providing improved recovery capability for the crewman. To enable immediate parachute deployment, the parachute was stowed on the outside of the seat back, as noted in Fig. 2, and a two -mode system operation pro- vided. ABSTRACT The LW-3B Escape System was designed for low and me- dium performance V/STOL aircraft. The recovery capa- bility of the system at speeds less than 200 KEAS, where most ejections from these aircraft occur, exceeds all con- temporary escape systems, with the exception of other LW systems, which utilize the same parachute deployment sys- tem. This advance in the state of the art was achieved by a arranging a standard, 28 ft personnel parachute so that it is deployed immediately after seat -aircraft separation, thus reducing as much as 3 sec the time from initiation of the escape sequence to full inflation of the recovery parachute. This paper describes the operation of the two -mode LW-3B Escape System and its development and qualification pro- gram. 2153</page><page sequence="2">2154 B. C. SOLOMONIDES AND R. L. CARTER Fig. 1 - Two live ejection sequences from experimental V/STOL aircraft (time from initiation to full chute-2.06 sec) Fig. 2 - LW-3B es- cape system SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The LW-3B escape system is a two -mode system. The mode of operation is automatically set by a speed /altitude sensor unit, mounted on the aft cockpit bulkhead, at the time of ejection. If the ejection occurs at a speed less than 200 KEAS and altitude less than 10,000 ft, the system op- erates in the "low mode." If the ejection occurs at speeds greater than 200 KEAS and/or altitude greater than 10,000 ft, the system operates in the "high mode." Speeds and altitudes for low and high mode operation are shown in Fig. 3. When the speed -altitude sensor selects the low mode operation, a parachute deployment gun forcibly deploys the personnel parachute immediately after the seat emerges from the cockpit.

C. SOLOMONIDES AND R. L. CARTER Fig. 6 - Dual low mode ejection sequence from the deploying parachute expedites the achievement of line stretch and full inflation of the parachute canopy, as shown in Fig. 4. Harness release is accomplished by the personnel parachute at line stretch. The inflating para- chute canopy then immediately separates the crewman from the seat in a positive manner that precludes seat /man/para- chute collision or interference. Fig. 5 shows this separa- tion. The parachute gun also contains a high mode 2.0 sec time delay cartridge which is initiated in all ejections by a static line attached to the aircraft bulkhead. This arrange- ment effectively provides a backup to the low mode para- chute deployment system. Fig. 6 shows a dual low mode ejection sequence at static speed. The low mode sequence of events is shown in Table 1. If ejection of the LW-3B system occurs at an altitude above 10,000 ft or at speeds in excess of 200 KEAS, the speed altitude -sensor locks out the low mode system, and, as noted previously, only the longer time delay or high mode system will be in operation. The high mode 2.0 sec delay cartridge allows sufficient time for the seat to decelerate from a V max of 500 KEAS to a safe velocity for parachute deployment. Aircraft with lower V will result in the high mode car- max tridge delay being of shorter duration. Upon expiration of this high mode time delay, it then actuates the parachute deployment gun and forcible extraction of the personnel parachute is realized. Fig. 7 depicts high mode parachute deployment. Again, harness releases is accomplished by the personnel parachute reaching line stretch, and the crew- man is immediately separated from the seat by inflation of the parachute canopy as occurred in the low mode arrange- ment (Fig. 8).

The high mode sequence of events is shown in Table 2. The parachute canopy and associated hardware is pack- aged in a container which is affixed to the rear of the seat back. This container can be mounted on either the left or right side of the seat back. This personnel parachute is a standard 28 ft flat canopy with a 40 in. diameter improved pilot chute. This pilot chute provides about 75-100Â°/o more drag than the standard 36 in. diameter pilot chute. The personnel parachute can be manually deployed by pulling the handle located on the left side of the seat headrest.

Fig. 10 shows parachute schematic. Left- and right-hand seats are used for two -place aircraft, whether they be a tan- dem or side -by -side arrangement, to provide lateral separa- tion between the seat trajectories. The personnel parachute being mounted on the side of the seat produces an asymme- trical load with respect to the rocket thrust line. The rocket thrust, therefore, induces a left and right roll to the left- and right-hand seats, respectively. Thus, the left-hand seat moves up and to the left and the right-hand seat moves up and to the right. Lateral separation of the seat trajectories</page><page sequence="6">2158 B. C. SOLOMONIDES AND R.

These trajectories are illustrated in Fig. 11. Collision between the two trajectories is not possible as it is, particularly at very low speeds, with two seats of the same design. Although present day rocket catapult forces and their rates of onset are well within human tolerance limits, vertebral injuries still occur during ejections. One contributing factor of such injuries is improper body position during the cata- pult stroke. To reduce the possibility of such injuries, the LW-3B system provides positive, automatic torso positioning through the use of a ballistically powered inertia reel, which is actuated at the time of escape initiation. As shown in the schematic, Fig. 12, the initiation of the escape system by pulling the D -ring, which is mounted on the front of the seat bucket, fires the two M-99 initiators. Pressure from one of these initiators fires a 0.4 sec time de- lay in the catapult. Gas pressure produced by the other in- Fig. 11 - Dual ejection trajectories Fig. 12 - Initiation system schematic itiator fires the ballistic inertia reel and redundantly fires the catapult time delay. (It is to be noted that the rocket catapult used on the LW-3B seat contains two primers and two firing pins to actuate the catapult charge.) The ballis- tic inertia reel positions and restrains the crewman's torso within 0.3 sec after initiation of the escape sequence. Since</page><page sequence="7">LW-3B ESCAPE SYSTEM 2159 Fig. 13 - Automatic torso positioning and restraint the initiation of the catapult is delayed 0.4 sec, the crew- man^ body is properly positioned and restrained prior to catapult initiation. The position of the inertia reel relative to the crewman's shoulders is such that it pulls him back against the seat back and down onto the seat cushion. Thus it prevents vertebral injuries from either improper body po - sition or negative aircraft acceleration during ejection cata- pult firing. This operation is shown in Fig. 13. With this inertia reel capability, the pilot may eject himself without hesitating to position himself properly for the ejection catapult acceleration. More significantly, he can eject his crewman (if aircraft is so configured) without warning. This permits complete evacuation of the aircraft and recovery of both crewmen in the shortest possible time. The catapult -rocket unit installed on the LW-3B seat has a rocket impulse of 940 lb -sec, a peak rocket thrust of about 6380 lb, a burning time of 0.28 sec, and a thrust angle of 48 deg 15 ft. The catapult -rocket unit is located on the seat such that the rocket thrust is always below the center of gravity of the escape system ejected mass. For seat adjust- ment the rocket, seat, and man move up and down as a unit; therefore, no shift in the e.g. relative to the rocket thrust vector results from seat adjustment. Fig. 14 shows the rocket nozzle angle in relation to the seatman e.g. location. The catapult subjects the crewman to peak acceleration of 12- 15 g's with a rate of onset of acceleration ofl50-180g's/ sec. The velocity imparted to the ejected mass by the cata- pult is 42-44 fps. The e.g. pattern of the ejected mass (man-seat com- bination) was empirically determined from data obtained through measurements and weighing of human subjects of many different sizes and shapes. Utilizing this data, the rocket -catapult was positioned on the seat in a manner to permit the rocket thrust vector to be below the seat -man ejected mass at all times. During the development and qual- ification program of the LW-3B escape system, the moment arms (rocket thrust eccentricity relation with the seat-man e.g.) demonstrated were twice the maximum condition which would be realized during real egress from a disabled vehicle. This demonstration was accomplished using both 5 and 95 percentile anthropomorphic dummies. As noted pre- Fig. 14 - Rocket nozzle angle in relation to e.g. Table 3 - Required Seat Maintenance Item Maintenance Required Catapult rocket Replace every 3 years Initiators Replace every 2-1/2 years Parachute thruster cartridges Replace every 1-1/2 years Static line cutter cartridges Replace every 18 months Inertia reel Proof load strap every 18 months Parachute Repack every 180 days Seat Periodic visual inspection viously, the rocket -catapult utilized on the LW-3B system can be considered a low or small impulse rocket motor. With the LW-3B system, low speed stability problems are avoided by the use of this small impulse unit. This is pos- sible because of the immediate deployment of the para- chute. The parachute then acts as a drag device and dam- pens the head aft pitching produced by rocket thrust-e.g. eccentricity, but still permits sufficient altitude to be gained from the thrust to effect safe recovery of the crewman. The LW-3B seat system uses a standard GFE, RSSK-9 sur- vival kit. This is a rigid kit with a volume of approximately 3 1600 in. . The volume is adequate for the PK-2 survival equipment, the AN/PCR-49 radio and battery, rations, sun- burn ointment, distress signals (flares) SEEK-1 kit, emer- gency oxygen, and other items. The LW -3B seat system is readily adapted for seat sequenc - ing. One arrangement currently employed in an operational aircraft is shown schematically in Fig. 15. The seats are in a tandem arrangement; therefore the aft crew man is al- ways ejected first from the aircraft. With this sequence ar- rangement, when the pilot initiates the ejection sequence he simultaneously fires both his and the rear crewman's</page><page sequence="8">2160 B. C. SOLOMONIDES AND R. L.

The rear crewman can eject himself at any time without interfering with the pilot. When the rear crewman ejects, the booster initiators between the two seats serve as check valves to prevent pres- sure from reaching the pilot's seat. There are other arrange- ments for sequencing which can be provided, depending on crew seating locations and the criteria of control desired. The simplicity of the LW-3B design results in minimum maintenance requirements as noted in Table 3. The replace- ment time shown for the ballistic items is based upon con- servative U. S. Navy estimates of installed life. No other maintenance is required. No special tools are necessary for this seat system. WEIGHT BREAKDOWN A weight analysis of the current LW-3B ejection seat configuration is shown in Table 4. RECOVERY CAPABILITY The recovery capability of the LW-3B escape system is presented in Figs. 16-19 in terms of required terrain clear- ance of seat -aircraft separation for successful recovery from various aircraft flight conditions. The flight conditions are described by an angle of dive between 0 and 180 deg, and an angle of roll between 0 and 90 deg. When using the charts as shown, the dive angle must be applied first, followed by the roll angle. For example, an aircraft in level inverted flight with wings inclined 30 deg to the horizontal is de- scribed by 180 deg dive angle and a 30 deg roll angle. To illustrate the correct method for reading the charts, assume that the aircraft has a velocity of 200 KEAS, a 60 deg angle of dive, and a 90 deg angle of roll. It is seen in Fig. 18</page><page sequence="9">LW-3B ESCAPE SYSTEM 2161 Alti tudÂ« Required for Recovery - Feet 1600 ^ Ä¼ 7 120Â° 90Â° 60Â° 1200 -,50Â» /30Â°" looo â¢ ' ^SNVssN/^'' 180Â° 200 KEAS QÂ° Fig. 17 - LW-3B escape system recov- ery capability, 30 deg roll Altitude Required for Recovery - Feet 1600 t 1 7 120Â° 90Â° 60Â° 0Â° Fig. 18 - LW-3B escape system recov- ery capability, 60 deg roll Altitude Required for Recovery - Feet 1600-1 S 1 7 120Â° 90Â° 60Â° 1400 ' Ã¡SQJSÅ¾^- ~ / 1200 ^ o ^^30Â°' 400 ^^'^00 K E 0 180Â° 0Â° Fig. 19 - LW-3B escape system recov- ery capability, 90 deg roll that if the seat -aircraft separation occurs above 285 ft, the crewman will be recovered. The exceptional recovery capability of the LW-3B sys- tem can be illustrated in still a different manner. At speeds of 200 KEAS or less the crewman will be recovered if ejec- tion of the seat occurs at an altitude of 350 ft regardless of aircraft flight attitude. In addition the recovery capability of the LW-3B in level attitude -sink rate conditions is shown in Fig. 20 in terms of recovery altitude above the point of aircraft separation. All presented recovery data are based on average values for ejected weight, rocket thruster moment arm, and parachute inflation time. LW-3B TEST PROGRAM The LW-3B ejection seat has been subjected to a rather extensive test program on both specific hardware compo - nents and total seat system configuration. Static structural tests were conducted to verify crash integrity for 40 g 's fore and aft, 20 g 's lateral, and 30 g 's vertical. Forty full scale seat firings were conducted. This test program consisted of the following: 1. Test Firings - North American Aviation, Columbus (7 tests) - (a) 5 single static tests. (b) 2 runway truck tests at 30 knots. 2. Sled Tests - Holloman AFB, New Mexico (33 tests). All 33 full firings conducted at Holloman AFB were from the OV-10A sled and all seats ejected through production canopy glass. (a) 4 dual static firings. (b) 2 dual 70 knot firings. (c) 6 dual 200 knot firings.</page><page sequence="10">2162 B. C. SOLOMONIDES AND R. L.

(e) 1 single 460 knot firing. In addition to die test firings there have been three emer- gency egress evacuations from two aircraft with the LW-3B seat system resulting in three successful live recoveries. Two ejections were low speed, low altitude (speed 120 knots, altitude 400 ft) and the third was a high speed ejec- tion (430 knots, altitude 2000 ft) from an aircraft in the process of disintegrating. CONCLUSIONS The test program of the LW-3B escape system and cur- rent data from the three live ejections has shown that it is performing as designed and will recover an airman without injury or incapacitation throughout its operational r&amp;ige from static up to and including 460 KEAS. Throughout the testing program this seat system had demonstrated remark- able recovery capability. This LW-3B escape system bears the promise of providing exceptional emergency escape needs for low and medium performance V/STOL type air- craft both current and future configurations.</page></plain_text>
