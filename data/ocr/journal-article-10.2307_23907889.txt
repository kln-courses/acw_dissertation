We then assess the field, its growth, increased interdisciplinary opportunities, lesser marginalization, and improved research methodology but also the challenge of arriving at theoretical coherence, studying all types of religious and spiritual understanding and experience, and researching the richness and complexity of the religious vari able itself. Hie six articles that follow detail possible new developments, as covered in our con cluding overview. Keywords Psychology of religion, current research, psychology of religion, history, psychology of religion, opportunities From time to time it is important to take stock of a field's current health and to assess where a field is headed. It is obvious that we do not have a crystal ball and that a snapshot of the field at some point in the future will likely provide a picture considerably different than what is portrayed here. Nevertheless, we will, in this special section of the Archive, project what we believe are promis ing avenues of research that have the potential to help direct continued devel opment in the psychology of religion. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2008 DOI: 10.1163/157361208X316935</page><page sequence="2">6 K. H. Reich, P. C. Hill / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 30 (2008) 5-18 A Brief History Psychology of religion is frequently considered a child of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, if one understands earlier efforts by theologians and philosophers to deal with the human psyche in regard to the transcendent as being part of the psychology of religion, its history goes back at least to Philo of Alexandria and his pneumatology,1 to Augustine of Hippo and his grades of inner maturation (Augustinus, 1962), and even to earlier times in the writings of Hindu and Buddhist sages. In the Christian Middle Ages, religious/spiritual development was a genuine concern in the writings of St. Bonaventura (1979), Teresa of Avila (1979) and others. If one visualizes the phenomena described by these authors over against simply listening to the religious or theological language, then psychological categories and dimen sions clearly appear. As just one example, consider how the 16th Century work of St. Teresa of Avilas Interior Castle has drawn the interest of three con temporary psychologists of religion. Mary Jo Meadow (1992) demonstrates marked parallelisms between St. Teresas seven Mansions (grades/stages) in her Interior Castle and Jane Loevinger's full and intermediate ego stages 3 to 6 (conformist stage, self-aware level; conscientious stage, individualistic level; autonomous stage; and integrated stage). Rachel Julian (1992) interprets Tere sa's Interior Castle as a treatise on the development of object relations and finds the way clearly marked. Helmut Reich (1996) points to differing parallels between Teresa's Mansions and both Fowler's and Oser's developmental stages. Influenced by the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, psychologists of reli gion towards the end of the 19th century sought to free themselves from the ology and philosophy via strict adherence to a scientific approach. We will not restate this history since others (e.g., Heine, 2005; Henning, Murken, &amp; Nes tler, 2003; Loewenthal, 2000; Wulff, 1997, pp. 21-48) have provided helpful analyses about our field from the pioneering days ofWilhelm Wundt, G. Stan ley Hall, William James and Sigmund Freud, through its neglect by psycholo gists during the second quarter of the 20th century, to its rebirth in the second half of the 20th century, and on to its present growth. Ongoing Research Reviews of research in the psychology of religion (e.g., Emmons &amp; Paloutzian, 2003; Spilka, Hood, Hunsberger &amp; Gorsuch, 2003; Wulff, 1997) reflect the " See e.g., http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/philo.htm.</page><page sequence="3">K. H. Reich, P. C. Hill I Archive for the Psychology of Religion 30 (2008) 5-18 7 multifaceted nature of the object of our field of study. That is, current research treats religion and spirituality as (a) a dependent variable (of genetics and evo lution; the brain and its workings; experience, specifically in childhood and youth such as attachment, socialization, education; gender; cultural environ ment; etc.); (b) an independent variable (in coping; views of death; drug usage; helping behavior; mental and physical health; prejudice; virtue development; etc.); and (c) a mediating process (conversion; development; mystical, religious, or spiritual experiences; positive and negative affect; prayer; religious cognition; etc.). Indeed, religion and spirituality are complex and rich phenomena. A current snapshot of the field (e.g., Paloutzian &amp; Park, 2005; Roehlkepar tain, King, Wagener, &amp; Benson, 2006) suggests that the following research areas, though not an exhaustive list, are all quite prominent: (i) spirituality, its nature (also in relation to religion and religiosity) and its links with personal ity; (ii) religion/spirituality and health or well-being (including positive psy chology); (iii) religion/spirituality and emotions; (iv) religion/spirituality and virtues (forgiveness, gratitude, humility, etc.); (v) neuropsychology of reli gious/spiritual experience; (vi) religion and political action (including religious fundamentalism); (vii) impact of religion on decision-making and evaluation; (viii) cognition and religious development; (ix) effects of differing language use on religion; (x) extended and improved methodology including religious narratives, hermeneutics, and linguistic analyses; (xi) religion and meaning making; and (xii) cultural variability. A vigorous continuation of research on all of these issues is clearly desirable, especially if they can provide understand ing to contextual variations; that is, to what extent is religious and spiritual experience common across traditions and cultures and, conversely, to what degree are such experiences unique to specific traditions and cultures. There fore, continued research also into the biological component is crucial; though promising (e.g., D'Onofrio et al., 1999; Hay, 2006; Hay, Reich, &amp; Utsch, 2006; Spilka et al., 2003, ch. 3; Wulff, 1997, ch. 3), such research yet needs to be strengthened especially as regards neurobiology (see e.g., Fine, 2006; Rock well, 2005; cf. Reich, 2006). Studies of adolescents (e.g. Spilka et al., 2003, chs. 3, 5) may be of particu lar interest in this regard. Adolescence involves crucial developments such as puberty, marked cognitive development (e.g, Ozarak, 2005; Reich, 2003), increased interactions with one's peers, and distancing oneself from one's par ents that are more or less consistent across cultures. Does religious and spiri tual development also reflect this intercultural consistency? Similarly, it would be wise for psychologists of religion to research even more intensely the spiri tuality of young children with a view to becoming clearer about their inbuilt</page><page sequence="4">8 K. H. Reich, P. C. Hill / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 30 (2008) 5-18 personal resources and creativity (religious imaginings). In terms of practical application, such findings would presumably be helpful for religious educa tion, especially if the outcome should show that also in regard to spirituality, children can contribute more to their own development than is generally assumed—and that a mistaken educational approach can do more harm than suspected (e.g., Boyatsis, 2006; Boyatsis, Dollahite &amp; Marks, 2006; Hay &amp; Nye, 2006). Without a spiritually sustaining worldview, life for many can become difficult and end up in misery (e.g., Scharfetter, 2004; Tugendhat, 2006). Another area that would benefit from more recognition and open minded research is that of spiritual healing, and similarly controversial topics involving possibly mechanisms not deducible in a straightforward manner from the current state of cognitive neurosciences. Assessment of the Field Any honest attempt to develop a set of "objective" indicators of the fields cur rent health would likely yield a mixed assessment. Of course, such objectivity cannot be truly attained, but we have attempted to discuss some potential indicators below and, indeed, our brief (and surely arguable) assessment sug gests that there is both hope and concern about the field s future. We will first look at some positive indicators and then, just when we are buoyed with hope, we will also consider indicators of a challenged field that is, in some sense, in need of repair. Positive Indicators First, in recent years, the field has grown markedly. Memberships in profes sional organizations such as the International Association for the Psychology of Religion (LAPR, die Gesellschaft) and Division 36 (Psychology of Religion) of the American Psychological Association (APA) are at record levels. Conferences sponsored by these organizations reflect that prosperity. LAPR is invigorated (Beizen, 2003) with more participants attending its 2006 conference than ever before and Division 36 now holds an ever-growing mid-winter conference in addition to its well-attended program at the summer APA convention. New conferences (e.g., children's spirituality, religious cognition) have recently been held and were well-attended. Three pertinent handbooks (Paloutzian &amp; Park, 2005; Roehlkepartain et al., 2006; Wulff, in press) and one encyclopaedia (Dowling &amp; Scarlett, 2006) were either recently published or are about to be published. Professional journals within the psychology of religion are prosper</page><page sequence="5">K. H. Reich, R C. Hill / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 30 (2008) 5-18 9 ing. The Archive for the Psychology of Religion, the major publication sponsored by the LAPR, is flourishing once again and Division 36 will launch its own APA journal, Psychology of Religion and Spirituality. The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion increased its annual page count from 280 to 332, while the journal Mental Health, Religion &amp; Culture has recently expanded from two issues per year to six. Second, a number of interdisciplinary opportunities await psychologists of religion. For example, recent publications promote the benefits of collabora tive efforts with neuroscientists (e.g., Azari, Missimer &amp; Seitz, 2005; Hamil ton, 2006; Paloutzian &amp; Swenson, in press; Rogers &amp; Paloutzian, 2006; cf. Reich, 2006), including extension into neuropsychotherapy (e.g., Grawe, 2004, 2007). Psychologists of religion would be well-advised to also consider the possibilities of teaming up with cognitive scientists and anthropologists who have displayed an increasing interest in religion (Barrett &amp; Keil, 1996; Boyer, 2003; Koss-Chioino &amp; Hefner, 2006; Whitehouse, 2004 but see also Reich, in press). Third, related to interdisciplinary opportunity, the psychology of religion has an opportunity to be less marginalized than in the past. The very fact that religion continues to hold sway over large portions of the worlds population (with Europe being more the exception than the rule) is increasingly recog nized by psychologists and other social scientists. Some social scientists (e.g., Hunter, 1983; Stark &amp; Bainbridge, 1996) propose revisions to classic secular ization theory suggesting that religion no longer recedes in the face of moder nity as much as it has been revised by modernity. Richards and Bergin (1997) have referred to the increasing openness toward religion and spirituality as a new Zeitgeist. Such change not only creates greater exposure for the field but, as Hill (1999) points out, also provides both greater opportunity and respon sibility to constructively influence the discipline of psychology as a whole. There is perhaps nothing that will raise psychology of religion's stock higher than our ability to provide "new modes of thought that transform an area of study by shaping new perceptions of the data and new theories" (Jones, 1994, p. 194) within the entire field of psychology. As an indication of success, estab lished mainstream journals devoted to other domains appear to be publishing more articles on the psychology of religion and have even devoted entire issues to religious themes (e.g., Baumeister, 2003; King &amp; Boyatsis, 2004; Maehr &amp; Karabenick, 2005; Sinnott, 2002). Religious and spiritual development was a topic for the first time in the prestigious Handbook of Child Psychology (Oser, Scarlett &amp; Bucher, 2006), a recent article has appeared in the Annual Review of Psychology (Emmons &amp; Paloutzian, 2003), and the American Psychologist</page><page sequence="6">10 K. H. Reich, P. C. Hill / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 30 (2008) 5-18 published a series of four papers on religion and health (Hill &amp; Pargament, 2003; Miller &amp; Thoresen, 2003; Powell, Shahabi, &amp; Thoresen, 2003; (Seeman, Dubin, &amp; Seeman, 2003). Such inroads into mainstream psychology were only a pipedream a short time ago. Fourth, as with the rest of psychology, new research methodologies, with promise of furthering the field, are being increasingly utilized by psychologists of religion (e.g., Huber, 2003, cf. Hutsebaut, 2006). Specifically, psychoanaly sis has come a long way since the days of Freud and Jung: A relational para digm, supported by empirical research, is the order of the day (Aletti, 2003; Corveleyn &amp; Luyten, 2005; Jones, 2002; Sperry &amp; Shafranske, 2005). Such utilization of new research methodologies can be attributed to at least two factors: (a) a contemporary philosophy of science that is cautiously willing to consider results from less standard research methodologies, though a full embrace is far from being fully realized (Beizen &amp; Hood, 2006; Sandage, Cook, Hill, Strawn, &amp; Reimer, in press); and (b) new measurement techniques that encourage alternatives to traditional self-report data (e.g., physiological measures and other measures of cognition being developed, cf. Overgaard, Gallagher &amp; Ramsoy, 2008). Here it is sufficient to say that as new research methodologies are brought on line and applied to the psychology of religion, the possibility of new insights gained is enhanced. The contributors to this special section discuss other signs of promise for the field; we simply highlight these four indicators as a source of hope for continued advancement in the years to come. Unfortunately, our assessment of the field to this point is incomplete. The challenges yet facing psychologists of religion are immense. Challenges Ahead Perhaps the most important characteristic of a field's success is theoretical coherence, an element that seems to evade the psychological study of religion. Though the need for greater theoretical development has long been recog nized, the field continues to be driven by a hodgepodge of empirical articles on isolated topics. Long standing in the shadow of Allport's intrinsic-extrinsic theoretical distinction, recent years have witnessed a large number of mid-level theories dealing with such topics as attachment, religious coping, spiritual development, spiritual transformation and the like. Such theoretical models are useful and provide guidance to many important research agendas. How ever, in themselves, they do not yield a coherent strategy for the field as a whole. Perhaps, given the richness and complexity of the subject matter, a</page><page sequence="7">K H. Reich, P. C. Hill / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 30 (2008) 5-18 11 single overarching theoretical framework is unrealistic, yet worth striving for (cf. Reich, this issue). Second, the religious landscape appears to be undergoing seismic shifts that will undoubtedly provide new challenges for researchers. Not only is there an increasing plurality of religions especially in the West, but there is also increased plurality in terms of the definitions and understandings of what is "sacred," the object of a spiritual and religious search (Hill et al., 2000). For many, a spiritual journey will continue within the context of organized reli gion where the sacred is defined through institutional authority; for others, that journey will be far removed from any institutional affiliation and the sacred may take on any number of subjective and idiosyncratic qualities. The psychology of religion must necessarily be flexible to study all types of reli gious and spiritual understanding and experience. At the very least, this will require that psychologists of religion go beyond a narrow Judeo-Christian understanding if they are to study the richness and variety of religious and spiritual experience (e.g., Mohrhoff, 2008). Third, the psychology of religion must become a research topic of worth in its own right. So much research treats religion as an important predictor vari able of other processes of great interest to psychologists (e.g., mental health). There is nothing wrong with this and, indeed, religions and spirituality are sometimes robust predictor variables. However, much of this research does not help us understand the richness and complexity of the religious variable itself. Convincing philanthropic and government agencies that religion itself is a variable worth researching (and funding) is perhaps a tangible challenge ahead for psychologists of religion. We therefore approach this special section of the Archive with a mixed assess ment, recognizing both promise and challenge. To this extent we highlight a number of contributions that we believe have the potential to be unusually fruitful. Preview of the Six Contributions At the 2006 LAPR conference in Leuven the idea of this special section arose, and by a process of co-opting the present authors agreed to the joint enter prise. Each contributor has been requested to write, as much as possible, in non technical language, thus hopefully making this collection also a good source for seminar discussion for students and other non professionals. The underlying understanding of the psychology of religion is as follows. Psychology of religion has the task, first, of approaching religion from without</page><page sequence="8">12 K. H. Reich, P. C. Hill / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 30 (2008) 5-18 by providing (as much as possible) law-like relationships; that is, to identify reoccurring states or events with clearly recognizable, "invariant" features. In increasing order of penetrating the phenomena under study, these features are recognized as characteristic patterns, contingent antecedent-consequent rela tions, and cause-and-effect relations—Erklären. Second, the task is to approach religion from within by seeking understanding—Verstehen. Briefly, the enter prise of the psychology of religion is understood as seeking to express religion and its personal adoption (religiousness or spirituality) in terms of psycho logical categories and variables. Of course, there exist other approaches such as that of religious psychology (i.e., psychology in the service of religion). Such an approach is not banished here but cannot be assumed to be self-understood and acceptable as a matter of course; it needs to be argued and justified. The papers presented in this special section represent well both Erklären and Verstehen. In the lead article authors Peter Hill and Nicholas Gibson suggest that what is most profitable in the psychology of religion is not a grand, over arching theory but rather the applied development of mid-level theories drawn from general psychology. Arguing that a good mid-level theory will (a) be able to sustain a systematic program of empirical research, (b) be useful to other theories within the psychology of religion, and (c) offer something back to the discipline of general psychology, they focus on three such mid-level theories, each chosen as representative of different developmental stages in terms of their productive value to date. The authors present the case, based on the criteria just enumerated, that attribution theory represents theories of great promise, yet thus far with little yield. Attachment theory has been more suc cessful in yield, yet has much more to offer the field. Representing mature theories that indeed have made a difference in the psychology of religion, but yet with few signs of slowing, is religious coping theory. Researchers are encouraged to further the psychology of religion not only by fully utilizing these three theoretical models, but also to use these models as exemplars for future theoretical developments. In the second article, Peter Nynäs also calls for further theoretical develop ment to move the psychology of religion forward. He calls into question the religious cognition hypothesis, favored by some, that religion is explained by attraction to counter-intuitive representations; that is, when our basic cogni tive ontological expectations are violated, they become salient and take on a religious quality. Arguing that counter-intuitive representations alone do not explain religion, Nynäs promotes a broader cognitive-analytic perspective, one that better appreciates Otto's (1923) notion of the wholly other, of religious representations. He maintains that the precursors of religious meaning involve</page><page sequence="9">K. H. Reich, P. C. Hill / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 30 (2008) 5-18 13 trajectories of specific preverbal memories that emanate from the tripartite sense of self, other, and world. Such trajectories lead to the capacities of relat edness and meaning that may help explain religious belief once one is capable developmentally (a "mentalization capacity") to grasp a separate dimension of mental activity related to religious experiences, symbols, representations and so forth. Admitting that such a perspective comes from a literature that is not a coherent theory, Nynäs stops short of proposing a new theory. Rather, he has successfully achieved his aim of promoting a theoretically integrative approach that carries with it important methodological implications (e.g., a hermeneu tical turn) for the psychology of religion. The next two articles consider the future direction of the psychology of religion from applied and culture specific perspectives. Valerie DeMarinis con siders the function and dysfunction of existential worldviews as issues of pub lic health in postmodern Sweden, an extremely secularized country with a most encompassing welfare system. She suggests that the psychology of reli gion can play a central role in identifying and assessing the functionality of such existential worldviews and thereby help shape the public health system within that society. The issue and context addressed in the article by Sara Sav age and Jose Liht is religiously motivated violence. Specifically, they draw from three theoretical models in social psychology—terror management, uncer tainty reduction, and social identity—to help better understand how religion sometimes motivates and justifies the use of violence. At the same time, how ever, these authors caution against a strictly reductionistic use of these models and believe that psychologists of religion can be part of a multidisciplinary effort that broadly maps how clashes of religious values can originate and maintain global conflicts and terrorist activities. The theme of multidisciplinary approaches to the psychology of religion is perhaps stated in its strongest form in the article by Peter Hampson and Eolene Boyd-MacMillan. Since the object of study for psychologists of religion involves another intellectual tradition, the psychology of religion stands to benefit, so argue the authors, from a greater acknowledgement of what theol ogy brings to the table. They provide examples both of how theology and psychology likely would benefit from interdisciplinary efforts as each acts as a hospitable, but critical, friend of the other. This special section closes by a return to some of the key issues raised in this introduction: searching for psychological universals that may underlie reli gion, adopting a more conceptually and methodologically inclusive approach to the psychology of religion, and constructing more comprehensive models. In the final article, Helmut Reich proposes that a more intense exploration of</page><page sequence="10">14 K. H. Reich, P. C. Hill / Archive for the Psychology of Religion 30 (2008) 5-18 religiously significant psychological universals may help propel the field for ward. To date, psychologists of religion have done little to systematically iden tify what aspects of religious experience are common across traditions and cultures and what are uniquely specific to each. Among possible research can didates in considering such universals, Reich contends, are religious rituals, contingent events such as illness or natural disasters, fear of death, spiritual transformation, value prioritization, and construction of meaning. Such effort will have methodological implications such as an appreciation of what both emic and etic approaches bring to the psychology of religion. Reich also encourages psychologists of religion to consider multilevel framing of their subject matter that will necessarily involve the hospitable challenge and cri tique across disciplines similar to that articulated by Hampson and Boyd MacMillan. Reich provides some of his own previous work on relational and contextual reasoning (RCR) as one example of such multilevel framing. Finally, Reich maintains that the psychology of religion can only benefit from the development of a genuine overarching model that is capable of not only inte grating empirical findings that lack conceptual coherence but that will be a useful heuristic providing direction for further development. Concluding Remarks Having looked into our crystal ball, we see a certain future of our field. We are aware of our limitations, and also of the fact that not everybody is interested in this kind of hypothesizing. Nevertheless, having been active in the field for a number of years, and having witnessed first hand its meanderings (and occa sionally its stagnation), we believe this special section to be of value. Hope fully, some researchers looking for a new activity will take their cue from here. Maybe, some conference organizers will add something to their program from these seven articles. And perhaps, in a number of years a fresh effort of this type will be undertaken to review the field again, assess the progress made, point out remaining challenges, and indicate ways forward thought to be promising. Finally, as guest editors, we would like to thank all co-authors for their effective collaboration, and the Archive Editors for their support.</page><page sequence="11">K. H. Reich, P. C.
