<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TALMUD ON TRIAL The Disputation at Paris in the Year 1240 By JUDAH M. ROSENTHAL, College of Jewish Studies, Chicago, Illinois IN THE 13th century the Church reached the height of its development and power. Innocent III (1198-1216) was the first to call himself "Vicar of Christ." This term implied according to later interpretations that it was wholly neces- sary for one's salvation to be subject to the Roman Pontiff.I The same pope was the moving spirit in the war against the Albigensian heresy. The renascence of free thought and philosophy in Southern France was utterly set back in this war. The Catholic reaction was triumphant with the victory of the Church in the war of Investiture. The spiritual power was declared and accepted as superior to the secular. The first quarter of the 13th century witnessed the emergence of new clerical orders, the most important of which were the Franciscans (1208) and the Dominicans (1217). In the year 1215 the famous Fourth Lateran Council known as the Great Council met. It accepted seventy decrees or canons which reflected the policy of the militant and victorious Church. These served as guides for the policy of the Church in the succeeding centuries. In 1233 Gregory IX (1237-1241) established the Inquisition.2 The triumphant onslaught of the Church against its enemies affected also the position of its most ancient enemy, the Jews. Its basic attitude towards them had been already See Warren 0. Ault, Europe in the Middle Ages (1932), 373. 2 Op. cit., 395. 58</page><page sequence="2">THE TALMUD ON TRIAL-ROSENTHAL 59 outlined by Christian theologians and rulers many centuries before. The philosophy of the Church in regard to the Jews had already been formulated in the fourth century by one of its greatest teachers, St. Augustine (354-430), author of The City of God. Like his contemporary Rufinus he com- pared the Jewish people to Cain,3 in whose punishment to be a wanderer upon the earth all his life he saw the proto- type of the punishment of the Jewish people. The theory he formulated about the attitude of the Church to the Jews was sanctioned by it and accepted by all Christian theo- logians until recently.4 The Jews according to medieval Christian theologians deserved to be completely annihilated or at least expelled from all Christian countries for the most heinous crime in the history of mankind, deicide, Godkilling. The Church, however, did not insist on the execution of this sentence because of the following reasons: 1. The Jews were the masters of the Scriptures, of the veritas hebrea, and, therefore, have to be saved from anni- hilation, as St. Augustine had said, "in order that the Church should not lack their testimonies concerning those prophecies." It drew its teachers of Hebrew from among converts, and if the Jews were to be destroyed or expelled, 3 Cf. Rufinus on Ps. 59.12. PL XXI, 880. 4 City of God, XVIII, 46. Commenting on Ps. 59.12 Augustin writes: "Slay them not, lest my people forget it, but scatter them abroad with thy power." Here did God show mercy to his chosen, even by the Jews his enemies, because as the apostle says through their fall comes salvation to the Gentiles (Romans 11.11) and therefore He slew them not, that is, he left them their name of Jews still, although they be the Romans' slaves, lest their utter dissolution should make us forget the law of God concerning the testimony of theirs. So it were nothing to say "Slay them not," but that he adds, "Scatter them abroad" for if they were not dispersed throughout the whole world with their Scriptures, the Church would lack their testimonies concerning these prophecies fulfilled in our Messia."</page><page sequence="3">60 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the Church would not attain the Hebrew truth, the veritas hebrea. 2. Since Jesus was born among the Jews, the Jewish race was superior to other races and should be preserved. 3. The Scriptures predicted that at least a part of the Jews would recognize the Divinity of Jesus and embrace Christianity. 4. As long as Christianity was not accepted by all the nations of the world, and was not even yet well established among those who professed to be Christians, the Jews were needed as witnesses for the truth of Christian teachings and for the testimony of the life and crucifixion of Jesus. The last reason, was the main theological argument, presented by all leading theologians throughout the Middle Ages and until our times for continuing the existence of the Jewish people.5 The English theologian of the first half of the 13th cen- tury, Alexander of Hales in his work Summa Theologiae Solutio also came to the conclusion that the Jews should not be destroyed and that they deserve protection. He stressed the difference between the Jews who deserve protection, and heretics and Muhammedans who ought to be anni- hilated. He emphasized that it was essential that the Jews be preserved for the sake of the Church.6 The Church, however, never yielded to the idea of a coexistence of Jews and Christians. It sensed danger in such a situation to the Christian society. It blamed the Jews for all heretical movements. It had to increase its vigilance so that the Jews should not contaminate Christian minds. s Guido Kisch, Jewry Law in Medieval Germany, 102. 6 J. Guttmann, "Alexandre de Hales et le judaisme," REJ, XIX, 227.</page><page sequence="4">THE TALMUD ON TRIAL-ROSENTHAL 61 The last four decrees of the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 dealt with the Jews. The Church accepted its drastic measures for the purpose of degrading the Jews and separat- ing them from the Christians. One of these decrees was that the Jews should wear dress differing from that of the Christians in all Christian countries and at all times.7 The Church felt it even necessary to maintain its own guard over the Jewish religion against any departure in Judaism from the orthodox tenets and practices. It was interested in utilizing every opportunity in order to undermine Judaism from within, and hence showed great interest in any internal strife within it. The Provengal and Spanish Jewry in the twenties and thirties of the 13th century faced a struggle over the attitude towards the study of philosophy which centered in the main over the works of Maimonides. It was the famous war between the Maimonists and Anti-Maimonists.8 The Church welcomed the appeal from the Anti-Maimonists for assistance. The leader of the Anti-Maimonists, Solomon ben Abraham of Montpellier appealed to the Dominicans of his city in the following words: "See, the majority of the Jews in the Provence are heretics and unbelievers. They follow the teachings of Moses of Egypt (i. e. Maimonides) who wrote heretical books. You are destroying your heretics, help us to destroy our heretics."9 The Church was glad to lend a hand in the war against the "heretics." The works of Maimonides were burnt in Paris and Montpellier in 1232 by the Dominicans with the 7 See Mansi, Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima Collectio, vol. 22 (Paris and Leipzig, 1903), 1055. 8 See Joseph Sarachek, Faith and Reason: The conflict over the ratio- nalism of Maimonides, 1935, Part II. 9 ,ih owi orvniy D'Lp n inn wnpni :4 III , n'-in nlmln n ip ano itvN u'pixn wnvt 3ain -ixL, in9m ': Dw'nI9I wD D r1 ni 3DD y '33 ': IHN 1L.. nNL 1-1a 03 w n n_.

It never gave up the hope for the ultimate conversion of the Jews to Christianity. In the 13th century foreign missions increased their activities. The Dominicans especially showed great zeal in spreading Christianity in foreign countries. They established special chairs for oriental languages at the universities for training missionaries. They were also in the forefront preaching Christianity to the Jews. They established special courses in Hebrew and employed Jews and converts as teachers." The number of learned converts in the 13th century who put their knowledge of the Talmud and their zeal for conversion at the disposal of the Church was steadily on the increase.II These converts col- lected all the polemical arguments and charges which they found in the writings of various adversaries of talmudic Judaism of previous generations. The anti-talmudic literature had behind it a long history and hailed from different and divergent quarters. The attacks on the Talmud by the Church are as old as itself. It admitted that if the Jews were to be tolerated, they had the right to live according to the laws of Moses, i. e. they had the right to refuse to recognize the fulfillment of the Law by Jesus since they did not accept Jesus as Messiah.

It was aware that the Jewish sages even took the liberty of changing some of the biblical laws through the device of interpreting biblical passages in accordance with changes they desired to effect and that the Rabbis attributed great importance to Oral Law, giving it superiority in weight and authority over the Written Law. The New Testament put in the mouth of Jesus the complaint that the Pharisees transgressed the commandments of God for the sake of tradition.12 The Mishnah-Deuterosis was the target for attacks by various Church Fathers and especially by Jerome.I3 The study of it was forbidden by the emperor Justinian in the year 533.'4 This prohibition was repeated by various Spanish council in the 7th century.'5 Talmudic legends with gross anthropomorphic contents were the targets of ridicule and biting criticism in the writings of many Christian theologians like Agobart of Lyons in the 9th century,'6 the convert Petrus Alphonsi in the 11th century,I7 and in the 12th century the famous abbot of Cluny Petrus Venerabilis, who made an investi- gation of the Talmud with the assistance of Jewish converts.'8 Talmudic legends and rabbinic conceptions were also the subject of ridicule by Zoroastrian anti-monotheist polemists, like Martan Farrux (9th century) in his work Skand Gumanik Vicar,I9 and also by Muhammedan theologians, 12 Matthew 15.3-6.

This literature was well known to learned Jews in Western European countries, especially in Spain where a Karaite tradition persisted until the 14th century.22 Karaite communities in Spain were mentioned in Jewish as well as in non-Jewish sources from the 11th to the 14th century.22a The first to take note of the Karaites in Spain was the Muhammedan theologian Ibn Hazm, who in his above cited work spoke of "the Ananites of Toledo and Talavera."23 For the end of the 11th century we have the testimony of the chronicler Abraham ibn Daud (ca. 1100-1180) who in his book Sefer ha-Kabala related the activity of Ibn Altaras and his widow. Ibn Altaras was a pupil of Abul Faraj Furkan ibn Asad, a known Karaite scholar of Jerusalem at the end of the 11th century. Ibn Daud emphasized the decline of the Karaites in Spain after the death of the siecle Skand Gumanik Vicar, Paris, 1945, 199 ff. Cf. Judah Rosenthal, Hiwi al Balkhi, 1949, 33, n. 144. 20 I.

Ibn Daud says that Judah "asked the king not to let the heretics open their mouths in the whole land of Castile and the king complied with the request and the heretics were sub- dued and did not continue to lift their heads."26 Despite Ibn Daud's gloating that the number of the Karaites in his time was dwindling and near extinction, they did not dis- appear completely from the Spanish scene. We hear again of their suppression in 1178 when the Carrion incident took place. According to a report of the convert Abner of Burgos (Alphonso of Valladolid, 1270-1348) given by Alphonso de Spina (d. 1491) in his Fortilatiumfidei, a quarrel broke out in 1178 in the city of Carrion between the Rabbanites and the Karaites.

The Karaites were subsequently suppressed through the intervention of Joseph ibn Alfakar, the physician of Alfonso VIII (1158-1214).27 Again at the beginning of the 13th century we hear of the suppression of the Karaites through the efforts of the influential courtier, Todros ben Joseph Halevi Abulafia and his son Joseph. Joseph mentions the part of his father in the suppression in a letter written after 1232, the year in which the works of Maimonides were burnt as a result of the war between the Maimonists and the Anti-Maimonists. Joseph writes: "Also my father and master of blessed memory went in the footsteps of my grandparents in his zeal to remove from our provinces the abominations of the heretics until he succeeded in destroying their fortresses and pulled down to earth their glory and there was not on the day of God's wrath a remnant when he executed judgment upon them and upon their books."28 The Karaites evidently survived the persecution also this time, since we hear of them at the end of the 13th century. The famous Cabbalist Moses de Leon (1250-1305) felt it necessary towards the end of the 13th century to write a letter against the Karaites in Spain asking for their suppression, as related by Alphonso de Spina in the name of Abner of Burgos.29 27 Cf.

The Italian scholar Shemarya of Negroponte is supposed to have gone toward the close of his life to Spain in order to influence the Kara- ites there to accept rabbinic Judaism. He longed for the reconciliation of Karaite and Rabbinic Judaism, as the realization of the dream of his life.30 Karaism continued to be an influential factor in Spain, as evident also from the polemics against them in philo- sophical works of such Spanish Jews as Judah Halevi and others.31 The above mentioned chronicler and philosopher Abraham ibn Daud wrote his chronicle Sefer ha-Kabbala (Book of Tradition) with the main purpose of refuting the contentions of the Karaites. The influence of Karaite anti-Talmudism and rationalism is particularly evident in the anti-talmudic charges of various converts in the 12th and 13th centuries. To the charges culled from anti-talmudic writings of various origins the converts added new ones. They sought to show that the Talmud was full of blasphemies against Jesus, Mary and Christianity in general. They were able to find many stories and statements which could be con- sidered as blasphemies.

The Fourth Lateran Council accepted in its 68th canon the resolution to put on the secular power the responsibility and the obligation of being the guardian against blasphem- ing the name of Jesus, the Holy Mother and Christianity in general.32 The literature of that period echoed the outcries against the anti-Christian blasphemies in the Talmud. Alexander of Hales was also of the opinion that books containing such blasphemies should be burnt.33 For the first time in their history the Jews had to meet still another great challenge. They had at the trial in Paris to answer in public whether or not they considered the Christians as pagans. The Talmud contains many hostile statements and discriminatory laws against non-Jews. The problem was, do these laws and statements refer also to Christians or not? The rabbinic scholars in Christian countries were of the opinion that the Christians were not to be identified with pagans. Especially extremely out- spoken on this question was the Provengal scholar of the 13th century, Menachem Hameiri, who wrote that the Christians were to be considered as Jews in all matters of civil law.34 However the liberal conception of the rabbis was not always shared by the masses. The average Jew did not differentiate between the non-Jew in the Talmud and the non-Jew of his time. 32 Illud autem districtissime inhibemus, ne in contumeliam Redemptoris prosilire aliquatenus praesumant.

The French Dominicans believed that they had enough evidence against the Talmud to put it on trial before the Inquisition which had the right to condemn it as part of its duty to combat heresy everywhere. There is no unanimity in the sources as to who was the main instigator of the trial against the Talmud. According to the majority of sources it was the convert Nicolaus Donin.3s But evidently more converts collaborated in col- lecting the evidence in preparation for the trial.36 We have very little biographical information on Donin. He is called in Latin sources Rupellus which means that he was a native of La Rochelle. But there are several places named La Rochelle, and it is not clear from which La Rochelle he came.37 We do not know the influences on Donin's life before he was converted to Christianity. Some admit the possibility that he became convinced of the truth of Karaism.38 His rabbinic opponent at the trial, Rabbi 35 According to Ducange, Glossarium ...

Therefore we have separated him and then excommunicated him. From that time on until today he has been planning evil against us, to destroy all of us."39 But another contemporary, the Spanish scholar Jacob ben Eli reports that Donin was a heretic who did not believe even in the Torah of Moses and that he was the instigator of the blood libel against the Jews. According to Jacob ben Eli, Donin was a rationalist who never became a good Christian and at the end of his life met a violent death.40 Another source relates that he was condemned at the end of his life for disobedience to the Church.4I The details of the trial against the Talmud are well known.

Rabbi Yechiel was interrogated on Monday and Tuesday, the 25th and 26th of June. Rabbi Judah ben David was interrogated on Wednesday, the 27th of June.46 42 See S.

The Rabbis admitted the truth of many of them.48 We do not know how long the trial lasted and what verdict the judges passed at this trial. The final verdict of guilt and condemnation was not announced till May 1248.49 Twenty four carloads of books had been burnt at the stake in Paris six years before the announcement of the final verdict, on Friday, the 6th of June, 1242.50 The Jews made many efforts during these years to obviate the calamity but without success. Gregory IX in an Apostolic letter before the trial urged the Bishop of Paris to burn the books about to be seized from the Jews.5s Only later did the Jews succeed in changing the verdict of condemnation of the whole Talmud and of burning to a verdict of censure or elimination of all the anti-Christian passages.52 Reports of the Paris trial were published by both sides, by the Church in Latin and by a pupil of Rabbi Yechiel in Hebrew.53 .. .on1 ln 'm rrn ia1n ' ql.

A scholarly edition of the Hebrew report is still a desideratum,54 but it has been the subject of many scholarly investigations.55 Also parts of the Latin source and other documents with bearing on the trial have been published and competently treated.56 Whether Rabbi Yechiel faced Donin at the trial is un- certain. According to the rules of the Inquisition the accused was not supposed to face the accuser at the trial.57 The Hebrew report, however, gives a dramatic picture of clashes between Donin and Rabbi Yechiel at the trial as well of the participation of the Queen Mother and the judges in the verbal duels. It is impossible to see in the Hebrew report merely a literary creation of Joseph ben Nathan Official, a pupil of Rabbi Yechiel, as Professor Baer suggests.58 The report bears traces of genuineness. Rabbi Yechiel evidently faced Donin at the trial. The charges were read to the accused at the outset of the trial and Rabbi Yechiel was given a chance to answer them, and probably a discussion developed in which Donin took part. Neither the Latin source nor the Hebrew report preserved the original order of the charges as they were read to the Rabbi Yechiel to Palestine but before his death in the year 1268. See Kisch, op. cit., 12. The name Joseph Official is mentioned in the colophon at the end of the Thorn edition of the Vikuach. On the departure of Rabbi Yechiel to Palestine see Z.

The Latin source does not contain any account of the procedure. It only enumerates the charges and the confessions of the Rabbis.6? The author of the Hebrew report gives a detailed but a confused description of the trial. He was interested in elaborating on the victory of his revered teacher Rabbi Yechiel over the wicked convert Donin and he dramatized the situation. He converted what was the usual trial before a court of the Inquisition into a disputation between Rabbi Yechiel and Donin. It is evident from the Hebrew report itself that it was a trial and not an ordinary disputa- tion.6I Rabbi Yechiel protested but without success against the trial which he wanted held before the pope in Rome.62 It is also evident from the fact that the Rabbis were asked to take an oath at the outset and they refused, that we have to do with a trial and not with a disputation.63 In the main, both sources agree with each other and complete each other. Our concern in this study is the charges levelled against the Talmud. The analysis of these charges is the purpose of the following investigation. The charges against the Talmud at the trial of Paris are summarized in thirty five articles in the appendix to a large collection of excerpts from the Talmud and Rashi. The collection known as Excerpta Talmudica, or Extractiones de Talmud, was com- piled by the convert Thibaut de Sezanne upon the request 59 Ibid. 60 Loeb, REJ, I. 6I See Vikuach, ed.

This work was edited in the years 1248- 1255 during the absence of Odo from France, who partic- ipated in the sixth crusade.64 The appendix was the work of Donin and other converts. We may add to these 35 articles or charges some of the charges contained in the Hebrew report and missing in the Latin source. We cannot include all of the charges in the Hebrew report and missing in the Latin source, since, as already pointed out by Pro- fessor Baer, some are probably additions of the pupil of Rabbi Yechiel, the author of the report.65 The talmudic excerpts collected by Donin were divided by him in the following categories: 1. On the authority of the Talmud (De auctoritate Talmut). 2. On the sages and the teachers (De sapientibus et magistris). 3. On blasphemies against the humanity of Jesus (De blasphemiis humanitatis Xristi). 64 Isti sunt errores in libro Thalmut quorum translationem fr.

The Hebrew report already foreshadows a new turn in the history of Jewish-Christian polemics. It ascribes to Donin the tendency to find in the Talmud hints for the messiahship of Jesus. According to this report Donin quoted the following two talmudic passages: 1. b. Sanh. 98: nr,1 ii o D6lyn Orh' -' y en -l ln 1n 1', and ibid., 5ls nmnm ,ain nDin 5inw -1y N3 - In 1I '. See Vikuach, ed. Thorn, p. 13. The proof for the messiahship of Jesus from the Talmud was first introduced by Raymundus Martini in his famous work Pugio fidei (ca. 1280 C. E.). See S. Lieberman, 1''Pv, p. 43. It is t erefore doubtful whether these passages were discussed at the trial in Paris whose purpose was to condemn the Talmud. They are not mentioned among the 35 charges. They may however have been a matter of discussion between converts and Jews before Martini.</page><page sequence="19">76 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW 4.
