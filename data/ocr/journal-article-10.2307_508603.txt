ROBERTSON. Routledge. I931. Pp. vi+i86. 6s. net. WHEN Mr. Robertson speaks of carrying the " scientific spirit " into our scrutiny of problems of authorship, he apparently does not admit that psychological evidence may be scientific in this sense, or that an estimate of a personality made by its aid may be as strict in its inductions as his own criticism and equally severe in its " concern for testable evidence " in another field. So it comes about that, in this study of the Marlowe canon, we are occasionally reminded of a late humourist's description of a well-attended Sunday service at which only God was left outside; in this thorough and careful examination of evidence for authorship, the only source of evidence that seems to escape notice is human nature. It is upon such grounds as these that a reader may differ from Mr. Robertson upon certain questions of date (such as that of Edward II) and of the canon of Marlowe's works. The main part of the book is a discussion of Marlowe's " hand" and some new theories are advanced in Part II, Chapters II and III, "The Assignable Plays in the Folio " and " Assignable Collaborative Work." The first of these groups includes the Henry VI plays, Richard III, Henry V (part), Julius Ccesar (part), and The Comedy of Errors. The later chapter contains some suggestions perhaps even less anticipated, including the old King John, Alphonsus Emperor of Germany, The Taming of A Shrew, Edward III, A 'Larum for London, and Arden of Feversham, together with the Folio plays, Richard II, Romeo and Juliet, Titus Andronicus and The Merchant of Venice. The chapter on Marlowe's genius and character is full of good points and shrewd estimates, such as the study of Marlowe seems to call out in many of those who discipline themselves to "look through his eyes." The happy application of Pater's phrase, " a hard and gem-like flame," to one aspect of the genius of Marlowe, dwells in the memory. Though in a detailed examination one would question certain statements-the anthropomorphic habit of mind, the lack of religion and the innate chivalry with which Marlowe is REVIEWS 329</page><page sequence="2">R. E. S., VOL. 8, 1932 (N9 31, JULY) endowed-and would, perhaps, question whether more importance might not be attached to the Elizabethan habit of drawing upon common sources of imagery, this part of the book is happily free from that disregard of the psychological evidence which is a disturbing element in Part II. U. M. ELLIS-FERMOR. The Phoenix Nest (I593). Edited by HYDER EDWARD ROLLINS. Cambridge: Harvard University Press [London: Humphrey Milford]. I93I. Pp. xliii+24I. Price $5.00 (2Is. net). THIS is the fifth, and after Tottell's Songes and Sonettes the most interesting, of the Elizabethan poetical miscellanies that Professor Rollins has so far edited. The plan of the work is in general that adopted for his previous reprints-a comprehensive introduction precedes the text of the poems, which are followed by exceedingly full notes and useful indexes. The introductory and explanatory sections are characterised by sound and careful scholarship, and there is little doubt that this edition will remain the standard for many years. As regards text The Phoenix Nest is the easiest to deal with of all the Elizabethan anthologies, as only one edition is known to have been printed, every page of which bears marks of diligent proof- reading and careful press-work. Moreover, the poems as there printed are almost invariably superior in text to the versions found in contemporary books and manuscripts, and of all but three or four The Phoenix Nest provides the earliest text known. In the purity of its texts The Phoenix Nest stands in strong contrast to Tottell's Miscellany, but in other respects the two collections are so strangely similar that it is not entirely fantastic to regard the later one as in some measure an attempt to do for the followers of Sidney what Tottell's Miscellany had done for the school of Wyatt and Surrey forty years before. Both anthologies sought primarily to represent the " new poetry " of their day; and in each case the authors-Lodge and his fellows no less than Wyatt and Surrey and their imitators-were drawing mainly upon French and Italian sources for their inspiration. To this cause also are due the metrical experiments, e.g. sonnets, that constitute a main feature of both collections but are absent from the intervening miscellanies, such as The Paradise of Dainty Devices. 33?</page></plain_text>
