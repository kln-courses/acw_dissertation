<plain_text><page sequence="1">PETER SWIRSKI Of Games with the Universe: Preconceptions of Science in Stanislaw Lem's The Invincible ven a general overview of Stanislaw Lem's fictions cannot fail to remark the extent to which his works reflect on the narrative and speculative premises which have gone into their making. Although it would not be easy or even neces- sarily possible to offer a tidy divisio of Lem's patterns of self-reflexive commentary, it is useful at least to identify its two principal ele- ments. The twin mutually supporting tactics that dominate most of Lem's scientific fiction can be traced to the narrative and meth- odological, or, more generally, literary and speculative, specifics of the genre with which his name is synonymous. The narrative self-awareness of Lem's fiction, prominent at all stages of his career, is often mediated through an examination of cultural and linguistic interpretive problems that reflect on the role and meaning of semantic models in epistemology and cognition. In Lem's first serialized novel, Czlowiek z Marsa (A Man from Mars, 1946), a failure in communication leads to the destruction of an alien from Mars; in his first literary breakthrough, Astronauci (The Astronauts, 1951), narrative self-reflexivity is apparent during the decoding of a Venusian magnetic "document"; and in the earliest of his novels to be translated into English, Eden (1959), the issue re- turns in the interplanetary communication problems that hinder both the humans and their translating computers. Toward the mid- dle of Lem's career this profound awareness of, and attention to, the role of conventional communication codes (whether narrative or scientific) finds its quintessential expression in the verbal extrava- gance of futurolinguistics and morphological forecasting described Contemporary Literature XXXV, 2 0010-7484/94/0002-0324 $1.50 ? 1994 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System</page><page sequence="2">SW IRSKI ? 325 in The Futurological Congress (1971).1 Afterward there is, of course, the celebrated A Perfect Vacuum (1971), where Lem takes to task postmodern literary conventions by self-reflexively parodying their premises, and more recently the still untranslated Wizja Lokalna (On-site Inspection, 1983), a tour de force of cultural interpretation, with an Earth-Earth dictionary appended to the text proper.2 In so many of its fictional incarnations, Lem's oeuvre consistently illus- trates and comments on why, as he himself puts it, "a language crammed full with neologisms is necessary, and not just a perverse game with fantastic sounds" ("On the Genesis" 386). Sustained neologistic paronomasia is one of Lem's fundamental ways of in- vestigating the unknown and estranging the familiar, especially when his own fiction is the subject of such investigation and es- trangement. Even though the writer's modeling tool is a natural, not a mathematical, language, just as mathematics can reflect from a metalevel onto its own statements, narrative discourse offers ex- tensive opportunities for self-examination. The other of Lem's self-reflexive tactics originates in his fiction's integral affiliation with the broadly conceived discourse (and phil- osophical metadiscourse) of science. From the early Investigation, through his best-known texts, such as Solaris (1961), The Invincible (1964), and Master's Voice (1968), down to the recent Fiasco (1986), Lem's works achieve their remarkable degree of cognitive and thematic coherence by virtue of being what they are about.3 This coherence should not, of course, be equated in Lem's case with a monomaniacal attachment to any single theme. On the contrary, there are few contemporary writers in any field who can match the extent and depth of his interests. The brief (and by no means exhaustive) synthesis of Lem's major themes compiled by Michael Kandel, in his zany but informative review from A.D. 2238, lists cybernetic man, life, individuality, consciousness, creators and their creatures, religion and its metaphors, utopias, epistemolog- 1.

Despite this thematic embarrass de richesses, it is possible to isolate some of the fundamental ideas that consistently recur in Lem's writings, examined and re-examined from every epistemic angle.4 One such concept that illustrates and illuminates some of the cen- tral problematics of Lem's fiction is the simultaneous inevitability and insufficiency of scientific or, more broadly, cultural anthro- pomorphism. By examining The Invincible, a prominent text from the middle of Lem's golden phase of 1961-68, I propose to analyze the epistemological importance of this dominant theme in the frame- work of its particular fictional narrative as well as vis-a-vis Lem's entire fictional oeuvre. This approach helps identify as well as unify many of Lem's diverse novels as fictionalized models of method- ologically viable approaches to the unknown. The Invincible spells out and illustrates the vagaries of a typical scientific process of investigating the alien-in the novel, a synonym for the unknown- while commenting broadly on the patterns and limitations of hu- man cognition. Naturally the two self-reflexive tactics (narrative and methodologi- cal) must not be conceived of as categorically distinct-in fact, for obvious reasons, they hardly ever appear in pure (that is, "uncon- taminated" by each other) form. Thus the prominence accorded to the epistemic reading of The Invincible is also a reflection of its intrinsic appeal as a work of fiction. The novel's acclaim and im- mense popularity with the reading public (especially in Germany, where it first became available in translation) owe a great deal to its fast-paced, tightly structured plot, whose genuine narrative nov- elty would seem to enthrall all readers.5 In this sense, The Invincible is without doubt one of the more accessible works in Lem's oeuvre, noted for its literary and speculative ambitiousness. Similarly, one must not overlook the richness of the novel's symbolism, held to- 4. Kandel attempts to do so in his introduction to Mortal Engines. 5. The English translation of The Invincible has actually been made from the German. On the subject of the novel's popularity, see Ursula K. Le Guin's eulogy of Lem as a storyteller.</page><page sequence="4">SW IRSKI * 327 gether by subtle but pervasive stylization after the gothic story (the haunting elements of mystery, madness, death; the ghastliness of setting; the ghostliness of the "corpse-spy"; the derelict tower of the Condor; the Frankensteinian echoes in the Invincible's gigantic robot Cyclops). On the other hand, notwithstanding the riveting plot, suggestive symbolism, and numerous other points of conventional narrative interest, it is clearly the nonfictional cognitive problem that animates The Invincible. The present analysis of the novel and of the preconceptions of science that animate it is designed to do justice to Lem's fundamentally realist speculation on the road to cognition.6 It is characteristic that Lem himself authorizes such an interpretive strategy by bluntly evaluating his own text as a "de- cently executed narrative 'vehicle' based on a nonfictional prob- lem" (Beres 52).7 The novel opens with the Earth space cruiser the Invincible land- ing on Regis III, a desert planet in the Lyre constellation, on a mission to investigate the disappearance of its sister ship, the Con- dor. From the beginning Regis III abounds with unsettling myster- ies. Flora and fauna are extinct except in the ocean, which teems with marine life. The wreck of the Condor is a scene of insane devastation, and its dead crew appears to have been ravaged by premortal amnesia. Another mystery is the presence of a "Black Cloud" of metallic micro-elements ("flies") which is suspected of having destroyed the Condor. Baffling and enigmatic, the entire planet gradually assumes the mien of a puzzle-forensic, military, and scientific-which defies the crew's preconceptions of what should and should not be found in this part of the universe. In- trigued and mystified, the scientists onboard the spaceship launch a full-scale investigation of the mysterious phenomena, confident in their conceptual and technological acumen. There is no doubt that the staying power and importance of The Invincible owe much to the scientific sophistication of its depiction 6. The quintessential testimony to this attitude can be found in Ziembiecki's inter- view with Lem, "'... Knowing Is the Hero of My Books ...'" 7.

CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE of earthmen's frantic efforts to model and comprehend the alien phenomena of Regis III. At the same time, however, Lem's text is also a model of a typical process of cognitive investigation, and thus representative of an entire class of cognitive investigations. Very early in the novel it becomes obvious that the methodology employed by the scientists onboard the ship is replicated by the structure of the narrative. The Invincible passes from description of basic research and gradual accumulation of empirical data, through the hypothesis stage, to the point where a dominant theory emerges as a coherent picture of experienced reality. The final hypothesis does not make any neopositivist claims to the absoluteness and completeness of its truth and accuracy, but in the empirical spirit of a more moderate form of realism, it leads to a pragmatic verifica- tion of its main premise, the nonsentience of the Black Cloud. The twin cognitive investigations conducted by the crew and the book itself are obviously informed by the same scientific procedures that have achieved multiple successes-lunar landings, transsolar probes, planetary studies-in the exploration of space. But the text does not stop at the rather simple concept of adopting the principles of scientific modeling for its narrative purposes. The Invincible also explores the idiosyncrasies of a typical scientific investigation of the genuinely "alien," exposing and demolishing familiar misconcep- tions about the process. If science is the cognitive vanguard of the cultural buffer zone that humankind erects vis-a-vis the universe, then the interface between cultural (including scientific) models and natural (that is, presumably ontologically neutral) phenomena must be a scene of constant conceptual friction, resulting in redescriptions and reorientations of the former.8 Lem's The Invincible is a prime exam- ple of such an interface between the epistemic systems of the ship's human crew and the cosmic phenomena they encounter on Regis III. From the very beginning, the ostensibly scientific, or purportedly objective, nature of the Invincible's examination of the new environment is inevitably tinged with anthropomorphism. 8. Practically any of Lem's philosophical writings can serve as a basis for this view; in fiction probably the most explicit examples are Lem's remarks on positivism and the nonintentionality of the physical universe in Master's Voice (28-34).</page><page sequence="6">SW IRSKI ? 329 The crew's use of names such as "Cloud," "flies," "bushes," and "city" deliberately effaces the alien nature of phenomena that have no parallel in the part of the universe known to humans. The "city," which in reality bears no resemblance to any terrestrial settlement, is a junkyard of gigantic machines, victims in the planet's evolu- tionary struggle. The "bushes" are tangles of metallic symbionts with miniaturized Y-shaped crystals, which in turn look and be- have totally unlike the "insects" or "flies" that the crew sees them as.9 The greatest misnomer, however, is that of the Cloud, whose highly concerted actions give the impression of being synchronized by a single "mind." The Cloud's deadly effectiveness, best illus- trated when it defeats Cyclops, the Invincible's most powerful com- bat machine, is interpreted by the ship as a sign of deliberate strat- egy. Falling prey to an anthropomorphic interpretation of the Cloud as the enemy, the crew ascribes to it the entire baggage of inten- tionality (beliefs, desires, intentions), reacting to it as if it were a rational being. Such behavior is psychologically and cognitively understandable as an endeavor to assimilate that which clearly exceeds the crew's conceptual horizons. All the same, even if we grant that "one cannot assimilate the Unnamable" (Lem, Fantastyka 74), a mere bestowal of taxonomic labels is tantamount, in fact, to assuming that it is possible to bring the unknown directly into the realm of concepts and values imported (literally, in this case) from elsewhere. Such an approach constitutes an act of self-deception as well as outright cognitive violence-a semantic and methodologi- cal evasion of the problems of penetrating the nature and structure of the alien phenomena. The symbolic personification and, through it, domestication of the Cloud's purely instinctual behavior is partially aided by the character of the planet itself. Regis III is in many respects a sur- prisingly Earth-type (even if not Earth-like) planet, resembling it in size, density, pressure, and ocean salinity; in fact, even "the skeletal structure of the [excavated] vertebrates" appears to be 9. Lem has adopted the basic concept of a macro-organism composed of replaceable microelements from Olaf Stapledon's novel Star Maker. For a brief discussion of this concept, see Stoff 17-18.</page><page sequence="7">330 * CON T E MPORARY LITERATURE "typical" (Invincible 30). These superficial similarities obscure the deeper reality of Regis III and its cybernetic evolution, blinding the human scientists to those aspects of it which are not so famil- iar. The observation that we should always try to look beneath the surface to fathom underlying principles is, of course, quite banal but reflects the fact that it is a problem widespread and deeply rooted enough as to constitute an almost inseparable part of our human experience. It is little surprise, then, that Regis III's super- ficial similarities to Earth initially induce a plethora of working hypotheses which obstinately try to assimilate the inscrutable workings of the Cloud within the confines of a familiar conceptual framework. Beguiled by the routine of their normal exploratory activities, the scientists attempt to force the alien world into a preformed and relatively inflexible network of both tacit and overt beliefs that serve them as a modus operandi in this un- known part of the universe. In the end, however, their ad hoc theories have to be discarded for the only one that fits the facts- however fantastic it may sound. After weeks of grueling investigations and spectacular defeats by the Black Cloud, an extravagant hypothesis is put forward by one of the ship's biologists. The Cloud is proposed to be a terminal product of the cybernetic evolution of machines, sole survivors from an alien spaceship, from the Lyre constellation, that had crashed on Regis III. Although capable of organized and destructive perfor- mance, the Cloud is not a sentient entity; in fact, it is described as a circumstance not unlike a storm or an earthquake-a natural phe- nomenon which must be approached and investigated as such. Despite the manifest advantages of Lauda's hypothesis in terms of consistency and comprehensiveness, as well as analytic and predic- tive power, the Invincible's other scientists appear unable (or plain unwilling) to accept its full implications. Instead they continue to deceive themselves in personifying the Cloud into an opponent-a fatal error that dramatically alters the rules of the investigative process. In terms of mathematical game theory, any form of cognitive engagement of the universe at large must be construed as a non- zero-sum game of imperfect information, in which human explora- tion is not perceived as antagonistic toward any part of the neutral</page><page sequence="8">S W IRSKI * 331 and inanimate universe.10 Any difficulties or failures can and must be explicated in terms of insufficient knowledge, inadequate meth- odology, or poor conceptual apparatus. One should keep in mind that, in fact, "zero-sum games are almost always an approxima- tion" (Morton Davis 82), an idealization admissible in modeling which, however, almost never accurately reflects the complexities and subtleties of real-life situations. Even situations that apparently offer no inducement to cooperative behavior-such as buyer and seller haggling over price, or two nations at war-are rarely clear- cut. After all, both customer and shopkeeper might prefer to close the sale, and both warring nations might wish to confine their hostilities to military campaigns, rather than extending them to the civilian population. Imprisoned within the anthropomorphism of their strategic discourse, the Invincible's scientists erroneously per- sist in believing that they are engaged in a zero-sum game, where one side's defeat is held to be a victory for the other. Such dogged myopia impedes their acknowledging the plain insufficiency of Earth-born and Earth-bound cultural paradigms in regard to Regis III and the evolutionary formations that define its alien character. Who are these emissaries of humankind, and why do they fail so dramatically to overstep the confines of their anthropomorphic iden- tity? The answer seems to lie in a number of striking imbalances that The Invincible displays in the presentation of its narrative agents. Only Rohan, navigator and second-in-command, and Horpach, the commander, are accorded enough prominence to emerge as indi- viduals. Even at that, the differences between them are carefully balanced in order to suggest that their individuality is only as separate as two sides of the same coin. Rohan's grudging identifica- tion with Horpach, originating in a "dream to himself ... become commander of the Invincible some day" (59), is emphasized by his being characterized entirely vis-a-vis the commander. Disdainfully aloof toward the crew, the two leaders regard each other in equally rigid hierarchical terms. They never rise above a strictly profes- sional level in their relationship; in fact, although "they had flown 10.

Their marked lack of deviation from a military code of behavior, com- bined with strict adherence to canonized procedures of extrater- restrial exploration, invites a similar inflexibility in the men under their command. Through this reductionistic depiction of the two leaders, Lem raises questions about the complicity of the twin disci- plinary apparatuses of the modern world-science and the mili- tary. The uneasy alliance of scientific enterprise with the industrial- military complex is, of course, of paramount concern to all of us, especially when the latter dominates the former's research agenda to the point of becoming the chief dictator of its priorities and strategies.1 Characteristically, for a short while after landing, ordinary crew members seem to resent such excessive rigor, despite the fact that Horpach's adherence to the "third step routine" (11) is motivated by his overriding concern for their safety. The irony of the situa- tion, which casts doubt on the all-times-and-places validity of any routine, is that every measure Horpach takes fails to make any difference in subsequent encounters with the Cloud. Any attempt undertaken to guard against unknown perils can, almost by defi- nition, be only of a generic, never a specific, nature. When faced with such extraordinary circumstances, one must either look for support in the inflexibility of well-tried formulas from the past or else fall back on the intangibility of an intuitive response. The latter trait, so typically human (at least in all nonreductionist ac- counts), leads back to the dialectical tension between the inade- quacy and the necessity of the human mind to perceive and expe- rience the infinite richness of the universe. At the very least, then, the crew's intuitive recklessness about the ground rules of plane- tary exploration contrasts sharply with the inflexibility of their commanding officer. His rigidity of thought and behavior is obvi- ously inconducive to forming an adequate approach to the phe- 11. This is without doubt another of Lem's perennial topics; the chain of novels sharing this concern runs the entire gamut from his first, Czlowiek z Marsa (A Man from Mars, 1946), to the latest, Pokoj na Ziemi (Peace on Earth, 1987). Although I see little evidence that the military rigidity of the commanders is to be taken as a direct comment on the political and ideological situation in the former Soviet Union, the possibility of such a reading must at least be acknowledged.</page><page sequence="10">SW IRSKI * 333 nomena that baffle the men. All this goes a long way toward explaining why they insist on reducing their difficulties to some- thing familiar that can reward their coded, step-by-step routines with cognitive and investigative success. It is of little surprise that the preponderance of profession over personality in the leaders is even more drastic in the case of the forty-five crew members identified in the course of the novel. Their names, accompanied by a designation of expertise, are the sole differentiating features within their circle; even their cabins on the ship are nameless, bearing only function initials: Ch. I., Ch. Ph., Ch. T., Ch. B. Clad in uniformly white suits (which cannot but evoke the impression of lab smocks), the ship's many specialists emerge as a de-individualized group agent, subservient to the mili- tary commanders of the Invincible and reflecting their limitations. This particular reductionistic imbalance is seen by Ewa Balcerzak as consistent with Lem's overarching interest in the common, rather than the unique, problems of human existence.12 Balcerzak argues that in the context of Lem's literary fictions it is inevitable that "man becomes a figure portraying humanity's scientific thought, its moral dilemmas, metaphysical and cultural problems, etc." Under the pressure of the cognitive goals that Lem sets for his texts, she adds, "it is not difficult to simplify the presentation of protagonists" (49), who are conventionally complexified in order to retain their mark as individuals. These comments are as valid here as in many other of Lem's "alien contact" novels. Even the early Eden essentially foreshadows the epistemic problem of The Invincible: in this 1959 novel, a group of "instrumental" specialists seek to understand an alien world and are forced to acknowledge the conceptual (and linguistic) shortcomings of their earthly experience. Lem's stereotypical picture of an all-male scientific community onboard the Invincible ironically reflects the stereotypically neo- positivist program that fails so miserably on Regis III.13 Irony can 12. Such a characterization of Lem's writings, while mostly true of the last phase in his career, can be applied only selectively to his earlier works. 13. During an interview with me in the summer of 1991, Lem argued-somewhat disingenuously-that the introduction of more female characters to his plots would necessitate a considerable increase in narrative complexity that could only be achieved</page><page sequence="11">334 * CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE also be read into the reductionistic imbalance of specialists among the crew members. Without exception, all of them represent natural sciences, the "hard" disciplines which, devoted exclusively to the physical-ergo presumably neutral and invariant-aspects of the universe, are supposed to be untainted by anthropomorphism. In the end, however, these scientists are proven all the same to be encumbered by earthly epistemic preconceptions, as they grapple with phenomena not wholly amenable to normal human science. There is only one agent in the novel who, besides comprehending intellectually the implications of Lauda's hypothesis, is granted a moment of epiphany into the nature of the Cloud and, through it, the nature of the planet and cosmos at large. It is Rohan, braving the Cloud in his solitary search for missing crew members, who finally welcomes it "as something that is simply other, of no use to him and ultimately irreducible to human patterns" (Slusser, "Invin- cible" 1051). Significantly, this heroic action is accomplished only when, guided by the insights of Lauda's theory, Rohan forsakes old modes of thought and behavior. Not just metaphorically but liter- ally stripped of protective shielding, he confronts and survives the encounter with the Cloud by adjusting to it rather than trying to dominate it. Rohan comprehends the essence of life on Regis III which, owing its existence to the inhabitants of the Lyre constella- tion, like a cybernetic golem evolves beyond its original creators' plans into a hermetic and autonomous system. The Cloud's autarky places it outside the sphere of values created by human culture. The scientists' pathetic attempts at taming its "otherness"-taxonomizing it as "necrosphere" while trying to justify its annihilation-cannot hide the failure of their technocentric and anthropocentric approach. It is of course ironic that a human being is chosen to perform this dangerous mission whose success (as well as his own life) hinges on the correctness of predictions derived from Lauda's hypothesis. It is important that, since the camouflage mechanism could have equally well been used to shield a robot, there was, at least in theory, an option of risking a machine rather than a member of the crew. The imperfect human being, equipped with a fallible mixture of intu- at some expense to the cognitive issues always at the forefront of his fiction. On the question of science and gender, see Haraway, and Harding and O'Barr.</page><page sequence="12">SW IRSKI * 335 ition, unpredictability, and even outright quirkiness, turns out al- most paradoxically to be better suited to the task at hand. The miss- ing crew members, victims of total amnesia, are so unpredictable in their behavior that only another human being is believed to be able to conjecture and intuit their whereabouts. The same human traits responsible for precipitating the disaster and loss of contact are now called forth to play a crucial role in the rescue attempt. Here the novel brings out into the open its generic self-reflexivity as a strategy for dealing with the conceptual alienness of the mod- eled circumstances. After all, The Invincible must present the reader with a phenomenon genuinely alien, that is, irreducible to any facile human categories, while operating within the semantically familiar terms of a natural (that is, human) language. Its task thus parallels the efforts of its fictional scientists. They too, using the conceptual flexibility of the language (whether natural or mathe- matical) at their command, try to write the unknown phenomena into the semantic field familiar to them. Since these efforts are the only ones available to them-truly, we cannot know what we do not know-the scientists are perfectly justified in renewing endeavors to comprehend what defies their comprehension. At the same time, the novel makes us acutely aware that what is missing from this picture of inevitable anthropomorphism is the scientists' awareness of the situation. The metalevel from which they could reflect on the nature of their own cognitive reflections is granted to the reader in an asymmetric fashion: the same problem is approached differently in the book (by the scientists) and by the book (by Lem). The promi- nent lacuna in the crew's analysis of the situation is precisely the cognitive link that the author submits to the reader as a key to the situation modeled in the novel. The self-reflexive difference in perspective endows The Invincible with its epistemic dimension: the inevitability of cultural (including scientific) anthropomor- phism need not be tantamount to a higher-level blindness to its insufficiency. A good case in question might be the recent development of the so-called chaos theories, which investigate physical systems that are ultrasensitive to their starting conditions (for example, turbu- lence or the weather). Although the essential core of science is built around the known laws of nature, which are often described as</page><page sequence="13">336 * CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE simple, symmetrical, and elegant, the real world (represented by the solutions to the equations that express these laws) is certainly not. Due to the irresistible intelligibility of simple linear phenomena, the essentially Newtonian approach to the physical world domi- nated science's way of looking for patterns and regularities in na- ture. The recent emergence of chaos studies as a systematic field of scientific inquiry therefore marks an important turning point in trying to redress this particular anthropomorphic imbalance in our research. Chaotic, or nonlinear, systems differ from linear ones in that they "require a knowledge of the whole in order to understand the parts because the whole amounts to more than the mere sum of its parts" (Barrow 170). These systems abound in the physical world, but since they are not amenable to mathematical investigation by means of linear modeling (differential and integral calculus), they were historically accorded little analytic attention, significantly dis- torting the picture of reality constructed by science. Consonant with the reductionistic presentation of the crew in Lem's novel is a similar anomaly evident in the depiction of the mobile piece of Earth they inhabit-the Invincible. The spacecraft is viewed exclusively as an instrument of technological power at the expense of its role as a habitat for the men living in it. Even the single seeming exception is no exception at all; the perfunctory description of Horpach's cabin confirms the lack of any "indication that the spaceship's commander had been living [t]here for years" (151). The Invincible exchanges its personal dimension for the sym- bolic status of an instrumental extension of human scientific cul- ture, a mechanical arm designed to reach out into the universe. Unfortunately, exploration on anthropocentrically (de)limited terms is tantamount to domination, and under "trial by fire" the Invinci- ble sheds the guise of a scientifically neutral space probe for the titanium-molybdenum armor plates of a fighting machine. Armor vincit omnia is the unwritten motto of the ship, gloatingly described as capable of generating energies that can turn mountain ranges to dust and dry out oceans. In the end, however, the space cruiser is proven far from invincible, when the Cloud defeats half of its crew and most of its military equipment, including Cyclops, a machine so invulnerable that "no one had ever heard of [its] defeat" (126). As Madison Davis rightly points out, much as in Shelley's "Ozyman-</page><page sequence="14">SW IRSKI ? 337 dias," the desert of Regis III makes a mockery of the vanity and arrogance so apparent in the ship's name (32). The Invincible emerges as the novel's pivotal symbol, manifest- ing not only the frailty of human enterprise in the face of alien reality but, on a more general level, the nonsense of anthropo- morphic notions in confrontation with the forces of nature. In Rohan's acerbic exegesis, one should indeed "Conquer the void, of course; why not? But don't attack what already is, that which in the course of millions of years has achieved a balanced existence of its own, independent, not subject to anyone or anything ... neither better nor worse than the existence of the amino-acid compounds we call animals or human beings" (146). The implied censure gains addi- tional power from the contrast between the technologically splen- did chronotope of The Invincible and the short-sightedness of its sci- entists. Although the novel's temporal dimension is only obliquely hinted at in a reference to Earth's "highly developed technology that had already flourished for centuries" (18), superluminal com- munication, hibernation, and antimatter technology well surpass present-day capabilities.14 It is in the thesis that mere instrumental advancement does not guarantee conceptual maturity that the novel's irony is at its most overt. On the one hand, the irony clearly alludes to and ridicules the anticognitive bias of mostly gadget-driven sci- ence fiction, whose conceptual sophistication quite often boils down to the "them or us" (zero-sum) alternative. On the other hand, it comments on the nature of conceptual strategies in the scientific rather than the literary camp, by exposing the inherent, culture- driven limitations of their modeling power. This theme is not limited to Lem's fiction writing; its most extensive treatment is to be found in the 580 pages of Summa Technologiae, Lem's scientific and futurological magnum opus, which contains some of his most wide-reaching reflections on evolution, including the evolution of culture and the goals it adopts as its guiding principles.15 Begin- 14. Untypically for a writer who "avoid[s] like the plague" (Csicsery-Ronay, "Twenty- two Answers" 255) the problems that he doesn't believe can come about, Lem speculates here beyond contemporary science.

Over the centuries this approach gave rise to a number of "design arguments" that saw evolution as a goal-oriented phenomenon geared toward the bene- fit of humans. A modern version of that argument is the so-called strong anthropic principle, which, in its most militant formulation, submits that the emergence of the human species was essentially preprogrammed into the big bang. This cosmologic speculation, which reduces the universe to the role of a convenient assembly line for its terminal product, the human species, is ultimately grounded in an a priori conviction of some form of transcendence in human evolution. Of course, the premises of the strong anthropic principle can be refuted on purely logical grounds. It is obvious that, together with the human species, a number of other species as well as purely physical phenomena emerged into existence in the course of the unique path taken by evolution. If we grant this rather straightforward premise, it is clear that whatever the identity of the species or object in question, there can be no logical argument (other than a circular one) which could identify it as the teleological fulfillment of an evolutionary grand design. It is still possible to assert the truth of the strong anthropic principle, but now the range of its assertions is infinite: the uni- verse evolved in order to create x, where x is any conceivable entity that exists. Although not exactly meaningless, any such knowledge is trivial and thus of no epistemic value to us. It should also be noted that the particular relations among the values of constants in nature which have resulted in the evolution of humans (and which constitute the argumentative essence of the strong anthropic princi- ple) are only necessary for the existence of life; the emergence of life and the human species is not demanded by these coincidental values of the laws of nature, merely permitted. In Summa Technologiae Lem interestingly juxtaposes the evolution of biology with the evolution of culture, highlighting the parallels and similarities between them-especially the fact of their contin- gent development.

In a world devoid of total determinism (a thesis that applies equally to Niels Bohr's observer-dependent and Hugh Everett's realistic interpretation of quantum theories), the habitually revered imma- nence of cultural goals must be recognized as contingent on the interplay between historical contextuality and (empirically defined) randomness. The notion of cultural values not subject to the contin- gent and particular must be replaced by the notion of created values that are as contingent and particular as the culture which articu- lates them. By taking away the illusory comfort of transcendence, the recognition of evolutionary contingency confers responsibility for cultural values back onto the society that creates them. The absence of unique cultural necessity should under no cir- cumstances be confused with a renunciation of epistemic validation or authentication, both grounded in some moderate form of scien- tific realism.16 The world of human values is categorically different from the physical world with its infinitude of phenomena devoid of any semantic context (intentionality). We must not confuse the claims that the world exists independently of any cultural activity and that cultural values can exist independently of any such activity. The contingency of cultural values in no way undermines the existence of an empirical, spatiotemporal reality; it only denies its inten- tionality, implicit in the notion of an evolutionary absolute, and cautions us about the way we speak of that reality. The rejection of teleology in cultural evolution is tantamount to the recognition that the road ahead, though not completely arbitrary, is not leading toward any specific end or ideal. The Invincible's scientists assume blindly that their cultural pat- terns and values will hold for all possible worlds they might en- counter in their travels across the stars. They forget that, since their culture and its guiding values do not represent transcendent con- stants but are entirely man-made, the rest of the universe does not have to conform to them-especially when (mis)taken in game theory terms for an active opponent. While tirelessly adapting to 16. This position can be conveniently identified with Paisley Livingston's recent study Literary Knowledge: Humanistic Inquiry and the Philosophy of Science, or the work of Richard N. Boyd.</page><page sequence="17">340 * CON T E MPORAR Y LITERATURE the circumstances that continuously deregulate its homeostatic bal- ance, culture is not always able to assimilate phenomena which are truly "alien." We cannot automatically impose our exploratory goals in the illusion that we are in possession of a transcendent monopoly on doing the right thing. The ultimate validation for our scientific goals is to be found in our culture, and is thus of our own making. Repeating the message that "no cultural necessity exists in our growth toward knowledge; for we often take that which has arisen by accident for what is necessary, and mistake the ephemeral for the eternal," Lem urges us to assume full responsibility and peri- odically examine and reflect on the ever-changing nature of our cultural goals (Microworlds 238). This analysis would not be complete without mention of the structural closure of Lem's novel, which ends just as it began, with the word "invincible." This classical circularity, indicating a return to the point of departure, is appropriate, as the earthmen do com- plete the mission they were sent on-after a fashion. They pene- trate the mystery of Regis III, but not before they learn that "in- vincible" does not translate into "infallible," especially where human-based models cease to suffice as cognitive referentials. In this sense, The Invincible is an important link in the entire chain of Lem's novels, in which the extent, the meaning, and the limit of what is human are defined in parabolic encounters with the alien.
