<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANNALS, AAPSS, 421, Sept. 1975 College Textbook Publishing in the 1970s By PHTT.T.P WHITTI;N ABSTRACT: Two-thirds of all books purchased each year in the United States are bought in an educational context. Yet very little has been written about educational pub- lishing in general and college textbooks in particular. This article presents a general discussion of college text- books, covering their role in American higher education; the economics of textbook publishing; the ways in which texts are created; constraints on innovation in text publishing; and the concept of the "managed" textbook. Phillip Whitten is a free-lance publisher, author, editor and film producer cur- rently under contract to several major publishing firms. From 1970 to 1974 he served as an editor and as publisherfor two educational publishing companies. He is co-author of Anthropology: Contemporary Perspectives, Race and Politics in South Africa and The Study of Anthropology, and co-editor of the Encyclopedia of Anthropology. He will receive his Ph.D. from Harvard University this year. 56</page><page sequence="2">COLLEGE TEXTBOOK PUBLISHING M ENTION the word book, and such titles as The Godfather, Valley of the Dolls and Catch 22 are likely to come to most people's minds. Very few people think of text- books initially. Yet Paul Samuelson's Economics text, first published more than a quarter century ago and now in its tenth edition, is among the most successful books of all time, often selling 200,000 copies a year. Other textbooks are invariably high on the list of best-selling books each year. Two-thirds of all the books pur- chased each year in the United States are bought in an educational context. Of some $3.5 billion spent last year on books, $900 million was spent by elementary and secondary schools, $900 million by students and institutions at the college level, and more than $500 million by industry and community agencies in voca- tional and non-degree programs of various sorts.1 The demand for education is a major reason for the existence of books. The demand for education is also a major reason for the existence of most publishers, and educational publishing often is the source of a substantial portion of their income. Yet most discussions about publish- ing focus on the much smaller, fictional trade book segment. And while there has been little analysis of the publishing industry in general (as Lewis Coser points out else- where in this volume), educational publishing-and in particular, the textbook-has been almost entirely ignored. This article presents a general 1. John P. Dessauer, "Books in Education," Publishers Weekly 206, no. 26 (30 December 1974), p. 27. See also, John P. Dessauer, Book Publishing (New York: R. R. Bowker, 1974). discussion of college textbooks: their role in American higher education; the economics of textbook publish- ing; the ways in which texts are created; and some recent innova- tions within the industry. ROLE OF TEXTBOOKS IN EDUCATION In contrast to the late 1960s, higher education today is in a period of economic retrenchment. While enrollments are leveling off and costs climb precariously, state legis- latures are reducing college and university budgets, and federal aid to education is only a fraction of what it was several years ago. College instructors are being called upon to teach a heavier load, their classes contain increasing numbers of stu- dents, and numerous innovative pro- grams in both the form and content of education are disappearing from the college landscape. There is a renewed emphasis on the impor- tance of structure in education, and students are oriented more and more towards careers. One result of these trends is that college textbooks, which had de- clined in use in the period 1966 to 1971, are experiencing a major resurgence. A 1974 survey con- ducted for the Association of Ameri- can Publishers (AAP) by Daniel Yankelovich, Inc., reported that the basic textbook was the primary teaching tool at the college level, with 81 percent of college instructors using one in their largest under- graduate course.2 According to the survey, there were "strikingly abrupt changes" in campus attitudes be- tween the late 1960s and the early 1970s-changes in attitudes which, 2. A Study of the College Textbook Market, prepared by Daniel Yankelovich, Inc., for the Association of American Publishers (February 1974). 57</page><page sequence="3">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY among other things, signaled an in- creasing reliance upon textbooks. The Yankelovich study reported that textbook use was strongest in two- year schools (90 percent) and in sci- ence and mathematics (87 percent), and somewhat weaker in the social sciences and humanities (74 percent) and in institutions with 20,000 or more students (67 percent). While 43 percent of faculty members fore- saw a decline in the importance of texts, that percentage was signif- icantly less than the 60 percent fore- casting a decline in a similar AAP- sponsored study in 1972. In response to the statement "most students just do not seem able to learn the necessary material un- less a course is structured for them with a text, assignments, tests and grade," the survey reported that 46 percent of the faculty members agreed fully, while another 44 per- cent agreed partially. THE TRADITIONAL TEXT With textbooks assuming an in- creasingly important role in the edu- cation of college students, it seems reasonable to look at the ways in which texts are created. Textbook publishing in general did not develop as a specialized business until the latter part of the nineteenth century, largely as a consequence of industri- alism and the need to educate large numbers of immigrant chil- dren. With immigrants streaming into American cities from many different parts of Europe, it became neces- sary to develop a uniform cur- riculum throughout the country. As William Jovanovich points out, "it is a distinctive feature of Ameri- can educational history that text- books are partly the means by which the school curriculum became reg- ularized-and . . . courses of study became more uniform-from state to state within the Union."3 Thus a collaboration between educators and private-sector publishers grew. The schools inscribed patterns of in- struction. The hundreds of publishers issued books on their own financial speculation, to fit the patterns; and by a process we would term . . . reinforce- ment, the books made the course just as often as the course made the books.4 Similarly, textbook publishing at the college level did not come into its own until the 20th century, when the opportunity to earn a college degree became a possibility for many more than just the children of the elite, and as rapidly increasing num- bers of young adults began to avail themselves of that opportunity. It be- came practical for instructors, par- ticularly at the introductory level, to assign one core book for their courses-one book which presented the major concepts and facts covered in the course. Today, traditional college texts are created virtually as they were some 50 years ago, although it now is very rare for a book to "make" a course.5 There is widespread con- sensus among academics throughout the United States on at least the core content to be covered in intro- ductory courses in psychology, soci- ology, anthropology, political sci- ence, biology, geology, physics and most other subjects. A traditional text typically is cre- ated in the following manner: -An instructor is asked to submit a proposal by an acquiring editor 3.

Emphasis in the original. 5. The only recent example at the college level is Jacob Bronowski's The Ascent of Man (Boston: Little, Brown and Co., 1974). 58</page><page sequence="4">COLLEGE TEXTBOOK PUBLISHING or by a "college traveler"- a salesperson who visits college campuses within a geographical territory.6 Until recently, editors often would vie with one an- other to sign up the "biggest names" in a particular discipline, or instructors who taught very large introductory courses and whose adoption of his or her own book would go a long way toward ensuring the book's finan- cial success. In recent years, however, the number of large adoptions has declined as deci- sions on which books to use have been left increasingly to the individual instructors.7 The wise acquiring editor is less con- cerned with signing the big- name author than with signing an academic with excellent writ- ing and pedagogical skills and a commitment to teaching. -The proposal is sent out for a market review, usually to three to five other instructors. As a re- sult of the reviews, the project may be dropped or accepted, or the author may be asked to re- vise it. Once a proposal is accepted, a contract is signed. The contract typically includes a royalty of 12 to 16 percent; an advance against anticipated royalties;8 and a stipulation that the author will turn over a com- 6. Only rarely does an unsolicited proposal or manuscript ultimately result in a book. 7. The Yankelovich study (pp. 53ff.) reports that in 1974, 79 percent of the instructors made their own decisions regarding book adoptions, an increase of 3 percent from 1972, continuing a trend that developed in the early 1960s. 8. Although the size of advances has declined since 1970, it still is common for a well-known academic to receive an advance in excess of $15,000. I know of several instances involving well-known academics in which considerably larger sums were ad- vanced; the books were never written and the money never returned. pleted manuscript to the pub- lisher at a specified time- seldom less than two years after the date of signing, and often longer. -The author then presumably begins to write. In many cases the book is never completed. However, if it is, it typically is finished some three to five years after the contract has been signed. -At this point, the manuscript is assigned to an in-house editor -only rarely the same editor who signed the book. Graphics are often treated in a casual manner. Since most contracts stipulate that the cost of photo permissions will be charged against an author's royalties, he often supplies the photographs, using himself, colleagues and free material as his primary sources. The usual result is a book that is considerably less visually attractive and inviting to students than it could be. -After approximately 12 months the book is edited, produced, printed, and added to the large list of titles the traveling sales- person has to sell, most of which he or she will never read. Thus, the traditional text typically is created in a way that seems to work against its becoming an effective learning device. It takes from four to six years to produce. The author does not have sufficient information about his or her potential market. Learning is presumed to take place in a linear, verbal fashion, and the visual, gestalt component of the learning experience is not carefully coordinated with the manuscript. Unlike elementary and high school publishing, where editors typically are people with teaching experience, college acquiring editors usually are 59</page><page sequence="5">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY former salespersons. The system generally does not allow an editor to stay with a project from start to finish-one persons signs a proj- ect and works with the author, while another edits the book.9 Under this kind of system it is not surprising that traditional texts are often tedious affairs, poorly writ- ten, visually unattractive, and sev- eral years out of date when they are published. ECONOMICS OF TEXTBOOK PUBLISHING Every textbook represents a sub- stantial investment on the part of the publisher, with a large portion of the investment occurring several years before there is any return at all. To discover why and how large sums are needed to develop text materials, let us examine the budget of a hypothetical college text, Sociology in the Modern World. The book is 500 pages in length, modestly il- lustrated in two colors, accompanied by an instructor's manual (a must), priced at $12.50, and three years in development, with a first-printing run of 20,000 copies. Thus, before a single copy has been sold, the publisher has run up expenses of almost a quarter million dollars, as delineated be- low: Advance ................ $ 20,000 Manufacturing ($1.50/copy) .......... $ 30,000 Plant costs .............. $ 33,000 9. Within college publishing the acquiring editor has a higher status and salary than other editors and usually is a male. The editor who actually edits the manuscript is paid considerably less and usually is female. See, for example, Women in the Boston Area Publishing Industry: A Status Report, (Boston: Women in Publishing, March 1975). Editorial ............... $ 17,000 Graphics ............... $ 30,000 Marketing costs ......... $ 60,000 General and administra- tive (25 percent) ..... $ 47,000 $237,000 Once the book has been pub- lished, additional costs in marketing and promotion are incurred. Let us assume that our sociology textbook was a success, and that over a two- year period it sold a healthy 50,000 copies. The financial statement might then look like table 1. Our pre-tax profit of $79,000 represents a tidy 15.8 percent of net sales. Of course, not all books are as successful as this one. If Sociology in the Modern World had sold 20,000 copies, we would have lost $75,000; had it sold only 10,000 copies- and there are many texts that do not do even that well-our loss would have been greater than $126,000. This budget tells only part of the story, however, because if a book appears to be successful, the pub- lisher must, by the second year of publication, begin to recommit a portion of the return on his invest- ment to the next edition of the book. CONSTRAINTS IN TEXT PUBLISHING As a consequence of the history of American education and edu- cational publishing, the textbook has become a synthetic product. It is synthetic in the sense that, unlike a theoretical paper or a scholarly work, it is not, and cannot be, the work of one person's mind-indeed, it would suffer if it were. Most of the content of a text is known before it is written. It is a vehicle in- vented from a professional consensus 60</page><page sequence="6">61 COLLEGE TEXTBOOK PUBLISHING TABLE 1 HYPOTHETICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT FOR SOCIOLOGY IN THE MODERN WORLD N et sales (books) ...........................................................

Thus a $12.50 book would bring $10.00 to the publisher. f For the purposes of this financial statement, we have assumed constant dollars and have not figured in the effects of inflation or other time-related factors. on what an introductory course in a given subject ought to consist of, wherever it is taught. Any text that varies significantly from the con- sensus is simply not likely to sell well. This consensus on the core con- tent of a given subject is necessary before a publisher invests the large amount of money needed to produce and market a college text. Unfortunately, this same consensus is also a source of great frustra- tion to innovative publishers and would-be textbook authors, for it generally sets severe constraints on the extent of innovation possible in a given book. It is possible, how- ever, to include a limited number of innovative features in a text that is expected to sell well, so long as the majority of the book's content remains relatively conventional and undisturbed. Four years ago, for example, there were few textbooks in sociology that included chapters on biosocial be- havior; now there are many. The Study of Society (November 1973) was among the first sociology texts to include a chapter on sex roles; now virtually all new texts include such a chapter. Likewise, there have recently been innovative attempts made in the organization of content within chapters, based upon psycho- logical theories of learning.10 By and large, however, innovations have been on a modest scale. 10. See, for example, David E. Hunter and Phillip Whitten, The Study of Anthropology (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1976); Michael McKee and Ian Robertson, Social Problems</page><page sequence="7">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Another constraint on innovation in textbooks involves the way in which the publishing industry con- ceives of its relationship with the academic world. Most educational publishers feel that their role should be confined to reflecting accurately the generally accepted canons, the conventional wisdom and the cur- rent paradigm of an academic dis- cipline. Generally they do not feel it is their role to take the lead either on issues of principle or in changing any part of the conven- tional wisdom. Consider, for ex- ample, what should be a non- controversial matter-the issue of sexist language, sexual bias and role stereotyping in textbooks. Three years ago sociologists Joseph W. Schneider and Sally H. Hacker examined the impact of the generic term man in introductory sociology texts." They asked 306 students in introductory sociology from three Midwestern colleges to assist in illustrating chapters for a proposed textbook. Some students were assigned chapters with "man" in the title-"Political Man," "So- cial Man," and the like-while others were asked to illustrate com- parable chapters without "man" in the title, such as "Society" or "Political Behavior." The results were significant: 64 percent of those receiving the sex-defined titles brought in pictures of males only; only 50 percent of those receiving the neuter titles produced male- only photographs. Schneider and Hacker then sent their data to more (New York: Randon House, March 1975); and The Study of Society (Guilford, Ct.: Dushkin Publishing Group, November 1973). 11. See, Joseph W. Schneider and Sally H. Hacker, "Sex-Role Imagery and Use of the Generic 'Man' in Introductory Texts: A Case in the Sociology of Sociology," American Sociologist 8 (1973), pp. 12-18. than 100 major publishers, hoping to "affect the sensitivity of colleagues and the policy of publishers." Only 20 percent of the publishers replied. Of this group, half agreed with the findings but were not sure of the significance for them as communi- cators.l2 Ironically, one-third ofthose replying felt that they, as publishers, had no responsibility to act until society itself changed. Late in 1973, several texts were published which attempted to elim- inate sexist bias. In 1974, McGraw- Hill announced an 11-page set of guidelines "for equal treatment of the sexes" that went into full effect with 1975 publications. By 1975 a number of other publishers followed suit. Rather than take the lead on an issue in which they, as professional communicators, presumably were expert, most publishers did not act until the problem of sexist bias had become an important political issue that threatened to affect sales sig- nificantly.13 A third constraint is the adoption process, that is, the procedure by which textbooks are chosen for course use. Most text adoptions are now made by the individual in- structor, rather than by committee or by the chairman's fiat, as in the past. An instructor teaching an intro- 12. Some of the reasons given for use of the word were: "'Man' is a short word"; "'man' has a meritricious suggestion of dignity about it for many people." 13. Publishers, however, do not seem to be alone in their ambivalence about sexist language. In a market survey conducted in October 1974 for Harper &amp; Row, more than 500 instructors of introductory anthropology were asked whether publishers should make a conscious effort to eliminate sexist language in their anthropology texts. Only 61.1 percent said yes and 38.9 percent said no; at the two-year schools surveyed the response was even more dismal, with only 50 percent answering affirmatively and 50 percent negatively. 62</page><page sequence="8">COLLEGE TEXTBOOK PUBLISHING ductory course in psychology, eco- nomics, sociology, biology, chemis- try or the like, probably is visited by at least a dozen college sales- persons in the fall, each pushing his or her company's newest text; by early spring 25 or more new and revised texts may have come across the instructor's desk. He or she can- not possibly read all of them, giving them careful consideration, but will probably skim through the books, perhaps checking the index, and gain a general impression of each text, largely through its design and graphic features. The instructor may then leaf through some tables of contents, checking primarily to see whether all the basic material of a course is covered. Finally, the instructor may select a few books and read one or two chapters in each, most likely in his or her specialty. If, by chance, a book with a new and challenging orientation or organization intrigues the instructor, he or she may never- theless, upon reflection, decide that the potential gains for students are not worth the effort of revising and reorganizing lecture notes based on, and coordinated with, a traditional text. Another kind of constraint on in- novative publishers is one that de- rives from the needs and abilities of students. A current example is the emphasis on "readability" or "read- ing level." Publishers are resorting increasingly to simplified language in texts to respond to a new element on the campus scene-the college student who cannot read at traditional college levels. Most of the pressure for simplified books comes from community colleges, which have grown in enrollment by some 500 percent in the past 10 years to a current figure of about 3.5 million students. The number of students taking remedial English at four-year colleges has risen dra- matically in recent years as well. At the University of California, for example, the percentage is close to 50.14 To meet the needs of college students who read at high school levels, and to compete successfully with other companies, publishers are employing so-called readability for- mulas and touting their books' scores on these tests in their promotion pieces. These formulas attempt to provide a readability index for a book by analyzing word length, sentence structure and sentence length. The two most widely used formulas are probably the Flesch15 and the SMOG.16 These formulas are ex- tremely rigid in their conceptions of what constitutes readability and are simple enough that an intelligent editor can develop procedures for editing a manuscript that will ensure virtually any score desired.17 In addition, the statistical validity of the techniques is open to question. A 14. See, Iver Peterson, "College Textbooks Are Being Simplified to Meet the Needs of the Poor Reader," New York Times, 7 November 1974. 15. Rudolf Flesch, "A New Readability Yardstick,"Journal of Applied Psychology 32 (1948), pp. 221-233. For a current applica- tion of the Flesch test, see, Barry Gillen, "Readability and Human Interest Scores of Thirty-Four Current Introductory Psychology Texts," American Psychologist (November 1973), pp. 1010-1011. 16. See, for example, G. Harry McLaughlin, "SMOG Grading-A New Readability For- mula," Journal of Reading 12, no. 8 (1973), pp. 639-646. 17. A readability expert once advised me that the word anthropomorphic was too dif- ficult to include in an introductory sociology text and advised substituting the word man- like throughout the book. The next time you come across the word person-like in a text- book, you may be assured that it was substituted for the original anthropomorphic by a liberated readability expert. 63</page><page sequence="9">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY SMOG score, for example, is derived managed text from a traditional text as follows: are the following: 1. Count 10 consecutive sentences near the beginning of the text to be assessed, 10 in the middle and 10 near the end. 2. In the 30 selected sentences count every word of three or more syllables. 3. Estimate the square root of the number of polysyllabic words counted. 4. Add 3 to the approximate square root. This gives the SMOG Grade, which is the reading grade that a person must have reached if he is to understand fully the text as- sessed.18 Publishers and authors may dis- like the shackles that such reductive, rigid formulas impose on them, but it is becoming increasingly the case that if a book is to sell well in the large junior college market, it must not score higher than 11th to 13th grade on such tests. THE MANAGED TEXT Perhaps the most interesting development in college textbook publishing in recent years has been the introduction of the "managed book" concept. The idea, now some six years old, involves an alternate way of creating college texts and seems to have the potential to ensure the creation of excellent, well-written innovative books, al- though that potential cannot be said to have proved itself yet. The pri- mary elements that distinguish a 18. McLaughlin, 'SMOG Grading," p. 639. The reading level of this article, for example, is 17; it might have been less if only the words editor and publisher contained two syllables rather than three. 1. Control over all aspects of the book rests firmly with the pub- lisher. 2. The time needed to create a book is reduced drastically. The optimum period of time to create a managed text-from inception to bound books-is 16 to 18 months. 3. Because control and authorship remain with the publisher, a lower royalty rate can be paid to the academics involved in a given book. The first managed text was begun in 1969 at CRM Books, with the people involved having only vague notions of the potential significance of the concepts with which they were working. The text, entitled Psy- chology Today: An Introduction, was a resounding success, selling 186,000 text-edition copies in its first year at a price $2 above its competitors.19 The book's well-pub- licized financial success served as an impetus for other companies to begin managed book projects of their own. In retrospect, however, it is clear that the book's success was due to other factors largely incidental to its being a managed book. These factors included: (1) the fact that Psy- chology Today, a magazine pub- lished by the same company, was already a well-known name among most of the people responsible for adopting psychology texts; (2) the list of 38 major psychologists as the contributing consultants to the book; and (3) the first use of new market- ing techniques such as telephone sales and direct mail (seven full- color mailings announced the book 19. Plus 20,000 copies of a trade edition averaging $10 above the text price. 64</page><page sequence="10">COLLEGE TEXTBOOK PUBLISHING before its publication). Indeed, PT: AI, as it is known, and two of the next three books produced by CRM were uneven books, promising more than they delivered-a judgment reflected in the marked decrease in second-year sales of the books. Because ofPT: Al's initial success, however, Appleton-Century-Crofts began in 1971 to work on its own variation of managed books, and in the same year the new Dushkin Publishing Group (DPG) began to produce managed books exclusively. By February 1975, Appleton-Cen- tury-Crofts had been bought by Prentice-Hall, where it was operated under the new managed book divi- sion; CRM Books had been bought by Random House; and other companies, including, inter alia McGraw-Hill, Harper &amp; Row, W. H. Freeman, Addison-Wesley, and Holt, Rinehart and Winston were experimenting with managed books. Initially, contributors to CRM and DPG managed texts were paid a flat fee for their contributions, usually about $500 per chapter. No royalties were paid, and the so-called author of the book was the publishing company. This procedure resulted in an enormous front-end investment in manuscript, especially in the years before adequate techniques for man- agement and quality control had been developed.20 The result was a high-risk, high-gain situation: if a book sold well, it could be a very profitable venture indeed; if it did not sell well-and most did not-it could produce a staggering loss. A procedure involving consider- ably less risk was later evolved by Appleton-Century-Crofts. Basically 20. Some of the books published by CRM and the Dushkin Publishing Group cost in the neighborhood of $100,000 for manuscript alone. it involved the development by an in-house editor of a detailed outline for a book, based upon market information. The outline was then fleshed out into a manuscript by a professional writer, under the guidance of an academic who was listed as the author of the book but who generally did little of the actual writing.21 The writer was paid a flat fee for his or her work, and the academic was paid a modest royalty, usually two to six percent. Most managed books today are being developed by more sophisti- cated strategies involving variations of these two kinds of procedures. The managed book concept provides the pubisher with a great deal of control over his product and allows him to address issues he is unable to confront effectively with more traditional texts, for the following reasons: -Through extensive market re- search, a publisher can deter- mine what the contents of a book for a particular market or market segment should be. -He can collaborate with several academics who are specialists in the various fields of a particular discipline, rather than rely on only one or two academics who cannot possibly be equally knowledgeable in each field. - He can hire a professional writer to do the actual writing of the book. Most academics are not highly skilled at communicating, which is not particularly surpris- ing since most of their training is to prepare them to do com- 21. Managed book publishers have learned that the academic community demands the name of an author on the cover of a book. There now exist several successful managed textbooks whose so-called authors wrote virtually none of the book. 65</page><page sequence="11">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY petent and effective research. When they do write, it usually is for a professional journal whose readership consists not of relatively unsophisticated col- lege undergraduates, but of their academic colleagues. A professional writer can work with academics to communicate their ideas effectively to under- graduates. In addition, a pro- ficient writer can gear his or her writing to a specified reading level. -A publisher can control the design and graphic features of a book and integrate them care- fully with textual material. -He can produce the book in 16 to 18 months and bring it out at the prime marketing time of the year (generally November to February), when most instruc- tors are making their adoption decisions for the following term. -Finally, because he pays a lower royalty to the academics in- volved in a particular book, the publisher can invest the money saved in market research; evalu- ation and revision of the book; graphics; ancillary materials; and marketing and promotion. Managed books have come a long way in a very short time. The con- cept provides the publisher with an ability to control, to an unprece- dented degree, all aspects of the creation of a book. As publishers have learned to use their control, the quality of the books produced has improved radically, but it is clear that there remains room for much additional improvement. Educational publishing, for the re- mainder of the 1970s, will not re- semble at all the halcyon days of the late 1960s. In a time of economic retrenchment and static enrollments, only those publishers who can develop techniques to reduce their financial risk will survive; and only those publishers who can learn to produce quality books consistently, with the maximum innovative ped- agogical features permitted by exist- ing constraints, will prosper. It is a worthy challenge. 66</page></plain_text>
