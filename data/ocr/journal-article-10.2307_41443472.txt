<plain_text><page sequence="1">Moses Mendelssohn and the Religious Enlightenment , David Sorkin, Lon- don, Peter Halban Pubi., 1996, 214 pages, Â£20, ISBN 1870015 27 4 Moses Mendelssohn has often been hailed as 'the symbol of the fusion of Judaism with modern culture' and as 'the symbol of the Haskalah' while, on the other hand, he has also been maligned as 'the symbol and false prophet of assimilation'. The aim of this excellent study is to correct these 'two-faced' interpretations of Mendelssohn as a 'symbol of contradictions' which stem, according to Sorkin, from 'creative misreadings of his life and work'. Sorkin convincingly portrays Mendelssohn as a conservative figure who did not rep- resent a departure from the Jewish tradition, but sought to renew it. Being nei- ther wholly medieval, nor wholly modern, Mendelssohn belonged to a transition period which allowed him to believe that Judaism was compatible with the ideals of the Enlightenment. While he lent his full support to the process of Jewish acculturation, he firmly rejected assimilation. Sorkin's book takes into account the often-neglected Hebrew works of Mendelssohn and analyses three overlapping phases in his thought: he shows how Mendelssohn's interest in the fields of philosophy, exegesis and politics were linked and entirely consistent and to what extent he thought that his endeavours would contribute to a revitalisation of Judaism. 158 EUROPEAN JUDAISM VOLUME 32 No. 1 SPRING '99</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Appropriating the Enlightenment thought of Christian Wolff, Mendelssohn sought to demonstrate that Judaism was in perfect harmony with natural reli- gion and, like Maimonides, he defended logic as an instrument to correct belief, if necessary, but where Maimonides had used Aristotelian categories, Mendelssohn used Wolffian ideas and concepts. Sorkin successfully demon- strates that Mendelssohn, although adhering to a kind of 'practical rational- ism' of the Andalusian tradition, was not a rationalist like Maimonides, but rather closer to Yehuda Halevi in spirit. In this context, Sorkin points to the lasting, but hitherto unacknowledged influence of J.G. Reinbeck (1683-1741) on Mendelssohn: Reinbeck had accepted the utility of philosophy, but had also emphasised its limits: ultimate theological issues were not contra but supra rationem , pointing beyond reason towards God's infinite power and wisdom. Mendelssohn's enduring achievement was to have revived the tradition of biblical exegesis, defending the rabbinic method against the mainstream crit- ical view of his contemporaries. Influenced by Wolff's aestheticism, he thought that the 'sublime' message of the Psalms should 'edify' the readers. Sorkin demonstrates how Mendelssohn's Biur takes issue with Maimonides over his attack on anthropomorphism in the Guide and over a number of Aris- totelian elements which had influenced the great medieval philosopher. Mendelssohn's conservatism is obvious, too, from his opposition to J.G. Eich- horn's 'higher criticism' and from his own view of history, which Sorkin sums up as follows: although Mendelssohn acknowledged history in the Penta- teuch, he did not recognise the Pentateuch as a product of history (p.85). While the Hasidic movement opposed Mendelssohn's Biur as a symbol of the Haskalah , others attacked him for making the Torah 'a maidservant to the German tongue'. In his third part, Sorkin examines Mendelssohn's political contributions, whereby he tried to combine absolute obedience to the Jewish Law with obe- dience to the law of the state. Mendelssohn successfully intervened on behalf of the Jewish communities on several occasions, e.g., he interceded to defend a line in the Aleinu prayer which had been censored by the Christian authori- ties. Mendelssohn's arguments for liberty of conscience were carefully bal- anced with his conservative notion of the state and yet he emphasised the vital role of the oral tradition within Judaism and that an abrogation of the Law could not be accepted, nor could there ever be a quid pro quo of religious observance for full civil rights. Sorkin's careful analysis presents Mendelssohn as a Jewish thinker who made Jewish issues central to his thought and actions. His preference for prac- tical reason over speculative thought allowed him to reconcile faith and reason in the Andalusian tradition, while his views on Judaism remained unchanged. EUROPEAN JUDAISM VOLUME 32 No. 1 SPRING '99 159</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Soon after Mendelssohn, however, in subsequent Jewish thought, Wolffianism would be toppled by Kantianism, and Judaism's uniqueness would be sought in its 'essence', rather than in Mendelssohn's definition of a 'divine legisla- tion'. The historicism, too, which Mendelssohn had rejected, would, during the nineteenth century, revive Judaism with its ideas of process and develop- ment, and through the scholarly efforts of the Wissenschaft des Judentums movement Judaism would be given a completely new direction and a new vision. David Sorkin's thorough and convincingly argued study portrays Mendelssohn as a transitional figure who, although using novel means, still remained firmly embedded in traditional Judaism.
