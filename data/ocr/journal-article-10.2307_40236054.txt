<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael C. J. Putnam Silvias Stag and Virgilian Ekphrasis Someone asked to comment on VirgiPs use of ekphrasis, the topos or sub-genre whereby an author brings narrative of events to a halt in order to offer pause for a detailed act of description, would no doubt first turn to his great imaginings of work of art1. There are six of them in totoy three lengthy, three more compressed, all with direct bearing on the meaning of the poem as a whole, in fact, in my view, metaphoric in sometimes astonishing ways for the text in which they are embedded. But there is also a séries of other ekphraseis which dot the epic. The majority of thèse are centered on landscape. We hâve, for instance, the magie harbor at Carthage which re- ceives Aeneas and his battered ships after the initial storm but whose menacing backdrop - Virgil calls it a scaena and prépares us 1. I adopt the term ekphrasis more out of convenience, and because it is standard in commentaries, than out of any certainty that Virgil would have approved, or even known, of its use which only became fully established as a rhetorical term during the Second Sophistic. The dosest équivalents in late Republican Latin would have been evidentia, descriptio or the borrowed enargeia. The standard discussion of ekphrasis is by P. Friedländer, Jobannes von Gaza und Paulus Silentianus, Leipzig 1902, 1-103. Cf. also H. Lausberg, Handbuch der literarischen Rhetonk, Munich 1960, 1, 399-407. For important treatments of par- ticular exempla see also G. Zanker, Enargeia in the Ancient Criticism of Poetry, «Rhein. Mus.» 124, 1981, 297-31 1 ; S. Bartsch, Decoding the Ancient Novel, Prince- ton 1989, 7-13, with notes; D. Fowler, Narrate and Describe: The Problem of Ekphrasis, «Journ. Rom. Stud.» 81, 1991, 25-35; A. Vasaly, Représentations: Im- ages ofthe World in Ciceronian Oratory, Berkeley 1993, 20, n. 6, and 90-1, n. 3-4. For non-«notionary» ekphraseis, that is, for examples of such descriptiones not dealing with works of art, the usuai introduction involves some form of the verb «to be» (cervuserat, est locus, etc.). This serves to remind us that, in whatever way the description may be extended and whatever the diverse manifestations of tem- porality it may contain, as far as its context is concerned it is essentially a static, rhetorical phenomenon. The motion of narrative proper for all intents and pur- poses cornes to a halt, and, though the future story line may be enhanced by such a pause, thè reader must stop to absorb a compressed, intense vision, however ani- mate aspects of that vision might be, before the activity of narrative per se can be resumed.</page><page sequence="2">108 Michael C. /. Putnam for thè tragic dimension of , and allusions to tragedy within, the subséquent story of Dido. Then there is the brief account of the island of Tenedos near the beginning of book 2. The Greeks bury themselves there {condunt is Virgil's word) just as they also hide in the wooden horse, and both land-mass and animal soon release their destructive énergies on the city of Troy. Or we have the astonishing first sighting of martial Italy in book 3 with turreted rocks and twin walls given it by nature and an omen of four horses, white like those of a Roman triumph and, nearer to hand, of Turnus as he enters the epic's final battle. But there is one example of ekphrasis which is doubly spe- cial, namely the portrayal in book 7 of Silvia's tamed stag whose flushing by Iulus's hounds and shooting by their master is the initial cause of fighting between the Trojans and the na- tives of Italy. The épisode is special because there is no other description of an animal elsewhere in the Virgilian corpus and because there is no parallel in the poet's primary model, the Homeric epics. It was found wanting in antiquity not for any lack of genius in the portrayal but because such a pretext for war it détails was considered trivial2. 1 would like to examine it closely, first putting it in the setting of book 7. 1 will then fol- low out the many allusions made in the épisode to the Eclogues and Georgics. My point is that such a concentration of référ- ences illustrâtes the changes which epic's narrative of war's in- cipient history brings to the spiritual worlds Virgil has created in his previous pastoral and didactic work. I will then turn to several startling parallels between the épisode and its context with the initial poems of Propertius's third book of elegies. 2. Macrobius (Sat. 5, 17, 1-2) offers évidence for ancient disapprovai of the pas- sage. A pejorative word on occasion applied to it is sentimental (see, e.g., R. D. Williams, ed., The Aeneid of Virgil: Books 7-12, London 1973, on. 7, 475 f.). For a summary of the responses of ancient and modem critics to the passage and for a sensitive reading based on comparison with thè simile at Aen. 4, 68-73, see J. Grif- fin, Latin Poets and Roman Life, Chapel Hill 1986, 170-2. The connection is also made by A. J. Boyle in the course of a discussion of deer imagery running through- out the epic («The Canonie Text: VirgiPs Aeneid» in Roman Epie, ed., London 1993, 93). Ν. Horsfall (Virgilio: l'epopea in alambicco, Naples 1991, 110 and notes) finds VirgiPs source in an epigram of Meleager on the death of Phanion's pet hare (AP 7, 207 = Gow-Page 4320-27). Examples of ekphrasis in the Greek novel deal- ing with animais are listed by S. Bartsch (op. cit. supra, 11 and 12-13, η. 12) as pan of a valuable discussion of the development of the topos.</page><page sequence="3">Silvia' s Stag and Virgilian Ekphrasis 109 These will be seen to continue thè metapoetic dialogue Virgil had previously initiated by acknowledging his own earlier poetry and to emphasize the confrontation between epic and elegy which is at the heart of the episode's distinction. My purpose is also to speculate on the relationship between this trenchant self-consciousness and the meaning of ekphrasis. It is a productive thesis to propose that analogies exist between Virgil's descriptions of works of art and the artful poem which they embellish, as if ail the notional ekphraseis, that is to say descriptions of imagined pièces of visual art, in the Aeneid were partial metaphors for that grand act of descriptio which is the poem itself. I would maintain much thè same premise for the ekphrasis of Silvia's stag. The ekphrastic moment, as conjured into being by Virgil hère, makes time stop for a rétrospective glimpse into a concise emotional history. Through it we observe the texturing of a work of art, indeed a multivalent symbol for aspects of poetry itself, and in particular for a world of lyric-elegiac intensity. Virgil has created an extraordinary instant of reflectivity where we watch him not only reviewing himself and his own past writing but coopting for his special purposes some of the symbolism his great contemporary Prop- ertius imagines in order to illustrate the generic différence be- tween elegy and epic. This, too, is a version of art looking at art, telling us much about its grandeur and also about its vast poten- tial for failure. We begin with the ekphrasis proper, followed by three lines that effect the transition from description to ongoing narrative (7, 483-95): cervus erat forma praestanti et cornibus ingens, Tyrrhidae pueri quem matris ab ubere raptum nutribant Tyrrhusque pater, cui regia parent armenta et late custodia eredita campi, adsuetum imperiis soror omni Silvia cura mollibus intexens ornabat cornua sertis, pectebatque ferum puroque in fonte lavabat. ille manum patiens mensaeque adsuetus erili errabat silvis rursusque ad limina nota ipse domum sera quamvis se nocte ferebat. hunc procul errantem rabidae venantis Iuli commovere canes, fluvio cum forte secundo defilieret ripaque aestus viridante levaret.</page><page sequence="4">110 Michael C. J. Putnam There was a stag of extraordinary attractiveness, with majestic antlers, whom the sons of Tyrrhus and their father, Tyrrhus, had reared, torn from his mother's teats, Tyrrhus whom the royal herds obeyed and to whom the guardianship of wide acreage was entrusted. Silvia, their sister, accustomed him to her bidding, using every care to adorn his antlers with weavings of soft garlands, combing the beast and washing him in a limpid spring. Accepting her touch and accustomed to his mistress's board, he wandered in the woods and of his own accord he once again betook himself, late at night though it be, home to the threshold he knew. The frenzied dogs of Iulus on the hunt star- tled him as he wandered afield, when he chanced to float down a stream and seek refuge from heat's swelter on a greening bank. The ekphrasis proper is a study in metamorphosis. It détails the story of a beautiful stag to whom violence is done by snatching him from his mother but who through the ministrations of Sil- via is absorbed into an apparently motherless family and be- comes gradually tarne. The séries of verbs in the imperfect takes us into a world of process in time past, a process that is mimick- ed in the itérations of the language itself . We twice take note of the beasts* horns and we are twice told that it became accus- tomed to Silvia and her treatment of him (adsuetum, adsuetus). With custom comes civilization - the combing, washing and eating that are part of ordinary human existence, which the animal joins, sustained now not by its naturai wildness but by the accultured world of Latium. This story of domestication takes a magical turn at thè end of the description through allusion to the stag's continued spon- taneity. Assimilation into a human household apparently in no way diminishes thè animal's naturai tendency to roam and yet return to the new source of its well-being. Civilization and freedom complément each other in this extraordinary creature. It is as if Virgil were imaging for us an embodiment of the abstractions which, according to Latinus, speaking to the Tro- jan emissaries, typify his people. They are, he says (7, 203-4), Saturni gentem haud vinclo nee legibus aequam sponte sua veterisque dei se more tenentem3. 3. 7, 203-4. The main différence between Latinus's characterization and Evander's later depiction of the évolution of humankind on the site of future Rome is that</page><page sequence="5">Silvia' s Stag and Virgilian Ekphrasis 111 die race of Saturn righteous not by bonds nor by laws but self- controlled by its own accord and following the custom of the ancient god. Virgil has Latinus pun on one of the ancient etymologies of /ex, as if it were derived from ligoy to bind, and build his définition of justice based not on compulsion and constraint but on in- stinctive, innate adhérence to custom. It is for this «golden» moment of wildness become civilized, held captive in its free- dom only by the tugs of proven habit, that the stag stands as emblem. Throughout the description runs the implication that the stag has suffered metamorphosis not only from wild to tarne but from animai to human, and this suggestion takes firmer shape as the subséquent épisode evolves (496-502): ipse etiam eximiae laudis succensus amore Ascanius curvo derexit spicula cornu; nec dextrae erranti deus afuit, actaque multo perque uterum sonitu perque ilia venit harundo. saucius at quadrìpes nota intra tecta refugit successitque gemens stabulis, questuque cruentus atque imploranti similis tectum omne replebat. Ascanius himself also, kindled with a love of special praise, aimed shafts from his [bow's] curved horn. Nor does the god abandon his straying hand, and the arrow, sped with loud roar, passed through his belly and through his groin. But the wound- ed animai fled back within the dwelling he knew and and passed groaning within his steading, and, bloodied and as if in prayer, was filling the whole dwelling with his complaint. Gemens and questa are regularly associated with humans, not animais, and the phrase imploranti similis substantiates the anal- ogy . The stag lacks only thè use of words to keep from express- ing human émotion by human means. Critics are right to see Virgil formulating a parallel with Dido4. The stag is placed in a Latinus sees no need for laws whereas Evander teils of Saturn as giving laws (leges, 8, 322). The dynamic of énergies already inhérent in Italy at the time of Aeneas's arrivai has been well discusseci recently by R. F. Moorton, The innocence of Italy in Virgil's Aeneid, «Amer. Journ. Philol.» 110, 1989, 105-30. 4. See above, n. 2.</page><page sequence="6">112 Michael G /. Putnam literal version of the figurative situation in which the poet posi- tions thè tragic queen as the dénouement of her story begins to unfold in book 4. The stag is saucius, wounded, just as Dido is saucia in thè book's first line, and, in the book's initial simile we find Dido as a cerva wounded fatally by Aeneas as unwitting shepherd whose hunting instrument is a letalis harundo, a dead- ly rééd. And, as the book progresses, and metaphor becomes reality as she approaches suicide, we hear of the questus that she utters in soliloquy5. One of these complaints, that she was not allowed to pass her life more ferne, in the manner of a wild creature, appears somewhat less curious, given this wider con- text, than when it stands alone6. Had circumstances been other- wise and Aeneas not impinged upon her world, she might have continued through life with a type of freedom similar to that which Virgil allots both the Latins and Silvia's stag. But there is a further aspect to the relationship between Silvia and her stag to which the analogy with Dido lends credence. The détails of the épisode urge us to visualize the stag not just in human terms but in the particular metaphorical role of be- loved. I will return in a moment to the elegiac vocabulary that tinges the whole description. Here I would like to point to one significant détail, namely the wounding of the animal per uter- um... per que Uta7. Aeneas's metaphorical arrow wounds Dido in the side. Iulus's arrow passes through the genitalia of the anim- al, emasculating it. The implicitly erotic relationship between Silvia and her stag, animal become quasi-human lover, reaches an end with the intrusion of Iulus and his hounds, and with the advent of thè more abstract «love of special praise» (eximiae laudis amore) which motivâtes him as hunt turns to war and an implicitly physical eroticism that civilizes mutâtes into a spir- itual cupidity that destroys8. 5. 4,553. 6. 4, 551. 7. Cf. the uses of Uta at Catullus 11, 20; 63, 5 and 80, 8. 8. Georgia Nugent suggests in conversation that the animal serves as a sacrificial victim, symbolizing perhaps the loss of Italian integrity before the onslaught of (civil) war or before a différent, merged world. This may well be part of Virgil's purpose. But serta, through their association with convivio, and poetic creativity, are distinct from the vittae that bedeck a victim. We think of Sinon as potential</page><page sequence="7">Silvia' s Stag and Virgilian Ekphrasis 113 In this context the phrase imploranti similis must enter our discussion once again. It abets the humanization of the stag but it also continues an aspect of the ekphrastic moment into the on-going narrative. Virgil uses similar phrases of Ganymede, anbelanti similis, in the brief decription on the victor's prize cloak in book 5 and of Porsenna on thè shield of Aeneas, indig- nanti similem similemque minant?. We are watching two of the several paradoxes of ekphrasis at work. Not only does it strive to make thè visual verbal, it also brings alive to thè mind's eye a creature or an event, giving it dimensionality and, in the case of Silvia's stag, a continuous existence. Within thè story line Silvia has created out of her pet stag something richly human, and Virgil, through the mysteries of description, has manufactured a work of art that leaps from ekphrasis into narrative, carrying with it a reminder of its intellectual birth10. The scene as whole, set (at least as Latinus envisions it) in the pre-lapsarian, pre-Trojan eden of Latium, illustrâtes one of the few what we might cali positive relationships in the poem. And in a book given to studies in metamorphosis it stands out for its affirmatory quality. Book 7 begins with a vision of Circe who turns men into beasts and ends with two emblems - the shield of Turnus which flaunts a depiction of Io in the process of receiving the bristles of a cow and, in its last line, thè lance of Camilla which consists of a pastoral myrtle capped by a spear- point. Both represent what has happened in the course of the book whereby the arrivai of the Trojans, and the machinations of Juno and her fury Allecto, transform an essentially peaceful landscape into one which battens on war, and the latent vio- human offering (2, 133) or of the priest Haemonides at 10, 538, sacrificed (immolet, 541) by Aeneas. Moreover the stag is only wounded. We never hear of his death (cf., e.g., 8, 641; 11, 197-8 and 12, 213-5 where animal sacrifice does occur). How close the language of hunting is to that of war may be seen by comparing line 478: ...insidiis cursuque feras agitabat with 2, 421 ...fudimus insidiis totaque agitavimus urbe,... 9. 5, 254; 8, 649. 10. Several words in the passage abet the undercurrent of eroticism. Erilis (490), e.g., may refer to the mistress of an animal or the domina of an elegiac lover (Cat. 68, 136; Ovid H. 9, 78. Erus is équivalent to husband at Cat. 61, 109). Both aestus and levare can refer not only to external heat and its assuaging but to love's «swirl- ings» as well (aestus: Cat. 68, 108, Prop. 2, 33, 43; levare: Cat. 2, 10, Prop. 1, 9, 34).</page><page sequence="8">1 1 4 Michael G /. Putnam lence of man and nature is tugged to the surface and made the paramount goad for motivating events. In this larger context the stag ekphrasis, in itself and then as it becomes an animated part of contemporary events, stands apart from the intellectual framework in which it is placed. But there are also détails in the nearer setting that further the distinction which Virgil has created. We might first note the powerful use of chiasmus here, and in passing observe how the rhetorical figure compléments the topos of ekphrasis, defining it, as it were, one verbal ploy abetting another to create what Joyce calls an «epiphanic moment»11. Before the ekphrasis we learn of the «sudden madness» (subitam rabiem) which Allecto throws before Iulus's hounds (canibus), and as action recommences it is his rabidae canes which proceed to bay the stag12. To introduce the ekphrasis and its aftermath, the narrator tells us that (481-2) ...quae prima laborum causa fuit belloque animos accendit agrestis. this was the initial provocation of the troubles and inflamed the spirits of the rustics with war. And after the ekphrasis Virgil varies the same image as the focus of action narrows on to Iulus and we learn that he pursues the hunt, and initiâtes the war, because he is, as we saw, «kindled with a love of special praise» (eximiae laudis succensus amore)10. There are also éléments within the ekphrasis proper that help draw it into the narrative. Curiously, spontaneity and wander- ing figure in the characterization of both the stag and Iulus. The stag intuitively returns home in the evening14 and Iulus of his own accord directs his wounding arrow. The stag in its freedom roams (errabat) at will and Iulus's right hand is said to be wandering (erranti) until guided by divine power, as if to say that there exists a commonality between man and beast, hunter and hunted, that is ruptured by the intervention of a higher 11. Cf. M. Nänny, Chiasmus in literature: ornament or functionï, «Word and Image» 4, 1988, 51-9. 12. 479,493-4. 13. 496. 14. ipse (492, 496).</page><page sequence="9">Silvia' s Stag and Virgilian Ekphrasis 115 authority which focuses man's ambitions along with his shoot- ing skills15. There is one détail linking description and action which underscores the distinction between thè past time of thè ekphrasis and contemporary events, namely Virgil's treatment of thè idea of hörn and its use. Twice in the ekphrasis Virgil calls attention to the anders of the stag. They form a major aspect of his grandeur (cornibus ingens) and their implicit hard- ness, which we are presumably to accept as metonymy of his ferai nature, gains suppleness, and therefore becomes graced by a form of civilization, when Silvia intertwines them with soft garlands16. As we move from description to narrative proper we find ourselves watching Iulus direct his arrow against the beast «from thè curved horn» (curvo cornu) of his bow17. As exphrasis merges with action, peace yields to war, life is over- taken by death and an attribute that adorned an emblem of nature evolving into culture is turned into a means of destruc- tion. The failed, idealizing artistry of ekphrasis, and its unique moment, becomes the practical unremitting artistry of hunting as it blends into battle. Virgil implicates still further reaches of his context in both the particular and generai aspects of his point. After she has finished the last act of her tripartite maddening of Latium and war is now assured, the fury Allecto alights on the ridge-pole of a lofty steading (513-4): pastorale canit Signum cornuque recurvo Tartaream intendit vocem... she sounds the shepherds* signal and directs her Tartarean voice on curved horn. An animal's horn has been put to yet another martial use, now as hunting horn serving as bugie. We are perhaps meant to make the further evolutionary change in material, via metony- my, from horn to métal, as the plot unfolds and we develop sophistication from hunting animais to fighting men, but Virgil 15. 491, 498. 16. 483, 488. 17. 497.</page><page sequence="10">1 1 6 Michael G /. Putnam keeps Iulus and his transitional bow before our mind with the brilliant metaphor intendit18. Allecto may be blowing a war- trumpet but metaphorically she is stretching and aiming her voice like an arrow sped from a bow of hörn, further to expand Iulus's initial, limited gesture into the whole countryside. Allecto's action takes more generalized, and final, shape later in the book during the course of a double descriptio depicting the customary procedure of Romans going to war, one aspect of which involves the consul's throwing open of the twin Gates of War. This time, as Roman custom is ratified, now and for the future, there is no question that hörn has given place to bronze (613-5): ...reserat stridentia limina consul, ipse vocat pugnas; sequitur turn cetera pubes, aereaque adsensu conspirant cornua rauco. The consul unbars the creaking doors, he himself gives the sum- mons to battle; then the rest of the people follow and brazen horns breathe together in shrill agreement. Virgil makes his point through a golden line of stunning vir- tuosity where the force of allitération and assonance builds to- ward the final two words, cornua rauco, whose letters repeat each other in both orderly and helter-skelter ways to abet the cali to war. VirgiPs treatment of thè word cornu and its mutation from positive use within the ekphrasis to negative outside exemplifies in parvo a larger intellectual schema within which the descrip- tion is set. Virgil carefully places his création through ekphrasis of Silvia's act of civilizing in a wider context to which it is made to appear antipathetical. Allecto attacks two victims, Amata and Turnus, before devoting her malign attentions to Iulus and his hounds, but only in thè case of the last épisode is her contri- vance of madness dignified with the label art (475-7): Dum Turnus Rutulos animis audacibus implet, 1 8. Virgil also uses intendere of stretching the strings of a lyre (Aen. 9, 776). There is thus a further musical aspect to the metaphor and a further hint that war corrupts the artistry of peace to its own malicious ends. On the musical, as well as martial, aspects of the metaphor cf. J. G. Landels, A Hellish Note, «Class. Quart.» 8, 1956, 219-20.</page><page sequence="11">Silvia' s Stag and Virgilian Ekphrasis 117 Allecto in Teucros Stygiis se concitat alis, arte nova,... While Turnus fills thè Rutulians with a spirit of boldness, Allec- to hurls herseif on Stygian wings against the Trojans, in a new piece of artistry... It is this «new art» that both spurs Iulus on his way and intro- duces, by contrast, the ekphrasis of the stag19, and such is like- wise the art to which Allecto can allude when the épisode is past and she can report to Juno the successful completion of her enterprise (545): 'en, perfecta tibi bello discordia tristi;...' «Behold, Discord with war's sadness, finished off for you,» Putting final polish on the manifestations of Discordia that she has engendered has now been acomplished. The artistry of war, unlike Silvia's accomplishment, battens on disjunction and per- fects a fractured, violent world. Virgil allots to Juno herseif a variation of the same image as the narration takes up after her departure (572-3): Nee minus interea extremam Saturnia bello imponit regina manum. Nor in any lesser fashion meanwhile does the Saturnian queen apply her final touch to the war. The phrase extremam imponit manum combines two idioms. Imponere manum means «to apply oneself» while extrema manus carries the notion of an artist's «finishing touch»20. The energy that Juno and her minion hâve expended on disrupting the Latian countryside is that of an artisan bringing to fruition an imaginative design. It is no less metaphorical than Silvia's bravura accomplishment to which it serves as both frame and foil. 19. The phrase novas artis is used of Venus's trickery in exchanging Cupid for Ascanius and thus preeipitating the downfall of Dido. On the connection between Venus and Allecto see R. Ο. Α. Μ. Lyne, Further Voices in Vergil's Aeneid, Oxford 1987, 18-20. 20. See OLD s. v. manus 13b and 20.</page><page sequence="12">1 1 8 Michael C. /. Putnam The perversion of the pastoral landscape is implied both in détails, such as Allecto's pastorale Signum and the pastoralem myrtum of Camilla, now tipped with a spearpoint, and in the larger impact of Junonian chaos. Hitherto we have examined the stag exphrasis as the antithesis of this metamorphosis by placing it in the context which the Aeneid itself provides. I would like now to return to the description and make use of allusion to explicate other intellectual worlds which it inhabits. To begin I will make one last bow to Juno and Allecto, this time to thè start of the épisode and the first words of pétition which the Olympian makes to thè creature she has elicited from the nether régions to do her disruptive bidding (331-2): hunc mihi da proprium, virgo sata Nocte, laborem, hanc operam... «Grant me for my own, ο virgin daughter of Night, this task, this effort,...» Here, too, the notion is that what Juno expects of Allecto is a form of artifice-making, a séries of labors that converge into one grand figuration of Discordia^ in her practical endeavors and in the poet's verbal realizations of them. It is not long since we have heard of «clothes, the effort of the women of Ilium» (Iliadum...labor vestes) as the last of the gifts Ilioneus offers Latinus as envoy of Aeneas21. The labor which Juno asks from Allecto is a parallel metonymy, the crafting; in three épisodes which make use of the «thousand arts of harming» (mille nocendi artes) that are at her beck, of a world at peace into a vision of war^2. From the beginning we anticipate the outcome of the épi- sode. We are also lured at thè start into another poetic realm of particular importance to understanding the ekphrasis of Silvia's stag, and that is the world of the Eclogues. Juno's words to Allecto allude to thè opening line of eclogue 10, the last of the collection: Extremum hunc, Arethusa, mihi concede laborem:... Grant me, Arethusa, this final effort. 21. 7, 248. 22. 338.</page><page sequence="13">Silvia' s Stag and Virgilian Ekphrasis 119 VirgiPs use of labor at this crucial moment has its own special design. Το offer thè «efforts» of writing in place of the poem itself anticipâtes two aspects of thè work to come. It warns us that what follows is to be devoted to a study of the «trials» which love brings, first to Gallus and in the end to the speaker, and of the resulting tension between elegy and pastoral which is the imaginative nub of the poem23. It also anticipâtes the transi- tion to the Georgics, with their own intricate brand of labores, which Virgil is intent on making as the poem draws to a conclu- sion. In my view the allusion from Aeneid 7 back to the final eclogue has a more expansive goal which we might consider emblematized in the replacement of Arethusa by Allecto, virgin daughter of Night. The muse as fountain-nymph, whose fresh water remains untainted by sait, just as she herself escaped rape as she made her way from Greece to Sicily, becomes in Aeneid 7 a furious figure of blackness unleashed on Latium. The opposition between pastoral and elegy or between pastoral and georgic on which eclogue 10 builds is replaced by the universal perversion of a pastoral landscape - and of pastoral ideals - which is the inspiration of Juno and her servant. An allusion to eclogue 10 also marks the end of the Allecto épisode as it had thè beginning. At line 550, five lines after her announcement oiperfecta discordia and immediately before the goddess dismisses her back to the lower régions, the Fury en- thusiastically catalogues further areas where she could put her disruptive talents to work. Among the possibilities, she announces (550): accendam...animos insani Martis amore. «I will inflame the spiri ts [of thè neighboring cities] with a love of maddened Mars.» Virgil would hâve us remember the use of the final phrase that he puts on to the lips of his poet-soldier friend Gallus, en- visioned about to leave thè amatory life he has been made to conceive for himself within the confines of the pastoral pleasaunce and return to the violence of war: 23.

Putnam nunc insanus amor duri me Martis in armis tela inter media atque adversos detinet hostis24. now a mad love of hard Mars retains me in thè midst of weapons and hostile foes. Once more a détail from thè final eclogue, this time contrasting the easeful life imagined by Gallus within the shepherds' land- scape with the realities, and perverse eroticism, at large, helps define the artistic mission of Allecto. But the most obvious contrast with Allecto's corrupt version of pastoral or, better, corruption of pastoral cornes from the stag ekphrasis where the présence of the Eclogues is most strongly felt. Let me begin with the three Unes from eclogue 10 immediately preceding those I quoted earlier, still part of Gal- lus's dream: 'serta mihi Phyllis legeret, cantaret Amyntas, hic gelidi fontes, hic mollia prata, Lycoris, hic nemus; hic ipso tecum consumerer aevo.' «Phyllis would pluck garlands for me, Amyntas would sing. Hère are cool fountains, Lycoris, hère soft meadows, hère a grove; hère with y ou I would be consumed [with love] for my whole life.» In Aeneid 7 the garlands which Gallus imagines being woven for him by Phyllis become those with which Silvia intertwines the horns of her stag. They absorb the epithet mollis, left in eclogue 10 attached to some vaguer «meadows,» while thè chili fountains of Gallus's whimsy become thè puro fonte in which the stag is bathed. But référence to the weaving of garlands allows us to reach backwards in the book of Eclogues and to be stili more spécifie. Virgil combines the verb intexo with the adjective mollis twice in the Eclogues as he does when descrìbing how Silvia adorned the stag, mollibus intexens...cornua sertis. The first occurs in eclogue 2, during Corydon's imagined séduction of Alexis into his figmented domain where a beautiful naiad will, with protreptic symbolism, join together a séries of flowers and herbs: 24. Ed. 10, 44-5.</page><page sequence="15">Silvia' s Stag and Virgilian Ekphrasis 121 turn casia atque aliis intexens suavibus herbis mollia luteola pingit vaccinia calta25. Then she paints soft hyacinths with yellow marigold, plaiting [them] together with marjoram and other fragrant herbs. The golden line brilliantly reifies the mingling of textures that at once allude to the sensés of touch, sight and smeli and adum- brate the erotic coupling that Corydon would will for himself . Even more germane to the ekphrasis is a line from the fifth eclogue which concludes a catalogue of the civilizing achieve- ments of the dead Daphnis. He taught men how to yoke wild tigers to the chariot, to introduce thè dances of Bacchus et foliis lentas intexere mollibus hastas26. and to interweave hard wands with soft leaves. Much the same could be said for the accomplishment of Silvia. Daphnis's acculturating power tempered the potentially martial thyrsus, which Virgil hère directly calls a spear, with leaves, mitigating hard with soft (all verbally mimicked in the entwin- ings of another virtually golden line). Silvia in her turn tames the rugged wildness of her stag by this very gesture of enclosing the rigid with the pliable. She becomes a Daphnis and, in a sensé, a Virgil, too, by her texturing27. These gestures illustrate what we might cali the assimilating potential of the pastoral mode, to absorb éléments foreign to it, even threatening to its fragile myth, and make them part of its fabric, even though sometimes only momentarily. So Bacchus's covert violence is coopted by Daphnis and the complex figure of Gallus finds a fleeting haven in the shepherd-poet's realm. Another trait of pastoral which is présent in the ekphrasis is its bent for spontaneity, for events occurring naturally which in other situations and in other poetic modes would come about 25. Ed. 2,49-50. 26. Ed. 5, 31. 27. For intexo and artistic weavings cf. Geo. 3, 25 (intexti Bntanni on a stage curtain) and Aen. 5, 252 (Ganymede on a cloak).

Putnam by effort or not at all. This form of pastoral idealizing, which is imagined to manifest itself in both animal and human kinds, is Condensed into the last lines of the ekphrasis proper: errabat silvis rursusque ad limina nota ipse domum sera quamvis se nocte ferebat. The stag is the perfect pastoral animal, demonstrating in itself what in ordinary situations would be either inculcated by train- ing or achieved by man's constant intervention. He is a transi- tory exemplar, located for contrast in epic's hostile environ- ment, of what we find imagined as an eternai verity in the idealizing extravaganza of eclogue 4 where, for example, ipsae lacté domum réfèrent distenta capellae ubera,...28 of their own accord goats will bring home udders swollen with milk. The phrase sera nocte also must enter our discussion. For the stag it means that, no matter how late the time, he still remem- bers to return home (which is to say, in elegiac parlance, that he remains faithful to his mistress)29. But Virgil also uses the phrase in eclogue 8 as part of a simile he puts in thè mouth of a witch attempting to bring her inconstant lover Daphnis back home from thè city. May yearning strike him, she cries, like that of a heifer for her bull, a heifer who distraught wanders in her search everywhere about «nor does she remember to with- draw even late at night» (nec serae meminit decedere noeti). Under less distracting circumstances the lover-animal would hâve remembered to return home no matter how late, but un- happy amory within pastoral, breaks the ordinary pattern of spontaneous, instinctual behavior. The stag's action is therefore made to seem the resuit of true affection displayed in a way that reflects an unimpaired évocation of an ideal pastoral moment. Other détails may add to thè picture. Some are positive, such as Silvia's act of adornment, for instance, which reminds us of 28. 21-2. 29.

Some are negative. For ex- ample, Virgil calls attention to thè wounding of thè stag in several ways. One is the phrase multo sonitu. It is unexampled elsewhere in Virgil nor does he ever associate the word harun- doy in its meaning of arrow, with sound, only with expeditious flight. The roar the weapon makes is therefore a miniature inst- ance of parody of the pastoral song that émanâtes from a slen- der reed, a song such as the speaker plans at the opening of eclogue 6: agrestem tenui meditabor harundine Musam: non iniussa cano31. I will ponder a rustie song on slender reed. I sing matters not unbidden. In the move from ekphrasis to reality we watch yet again another instance of metamorphosis from peace to war but this time with an added dimension. As we change from slender reed as instrument of song to the loud roar that aecompanies reed become arrow and now part of the apparatus of war, we leave behind an idealized world of the past, defined not only by its forced contingency to thè presenti destructive practicalities but by the world of poetry which characterizes it. Ekphrasis gives place to narrative, but we can now understand more clear- ly thè specialness of its design, depicting a pastoral scenario and therefore in this instance serving as a topos which participâtes in the rubrics of pastoral poetry itself . The phrase sera nocte tugs us into still another generic world, this time that of the Georgics. It recurs in one of thè more re- markable pauses in that poem when, in the fourth book, Virgil Sequesters time from his apiary universe to spend some thirty lines telling us what he will not teach - thè care of gardens, flowers and vegetables32.

His life is rugged and at the mercy of seasonal vagaries, yet it has its distinctly reward- ing sides. His small acres are not fit for cattle or vines. Never- theless he is the first to pick roses in the spring and fruit in the autumn and the first to harvest honey from his bees. Whatever the poverty of his circumstances, in Virgil's words, «he equal- led the resources of kings in his mind» (regum aequabat opes animis)33. One aspect of his daily habits stands out: ...seraque revertens nocte domum dapibus mensas onerabat inemptis34. and returning home late at night he burdened his tables with unbought meals. The last item, which Horace also echoes35, speaks to a gently idealized autonomy where man and nature are complementary while the first looks to the labor necessary to maintain this ba- lance. We are after all in a georgic world now, not a pastoral one. The f act that Virgil uses the phrase sera nocte also of the stag, intuitively returning home to its beloved late at night, might seem fortuitous or, at best, tangential were it not for one other détail which pointedly draws us from georgic 4 into the events which occur subsequently to thè ekphrasis and its immediate aftermath. Virgil spécifies, with a care underlined by thè narra- tori profession of autopsy, that the Corycian senex came from «under the towers of thè Spartan citadel» (sub Oebaliae...turri- bus aras\ which is to say Tarentum qua niger umectat flaventia culta Galaesus,...36 where the black Galaesus waters its tawny croplands.

Then there are other casualties: corpora multa virum circa seniorque Galaesus dum paci medium se offert, iustissimus unus...37 Many bodies of men there were round about and the old man Galaesus while he offers himself for peace in their midst, the one most just... Both Almo and Galaesus are names of rivers, the first a tribut- ary of the Tiber, the second Tarentum's stream. By giving thèse names to the first fatalities Virgil suggests the death of the land- scape and of what nourishes it that cornes through war. It is as if Silvia's world suffers another, now fatal, wounding and as if the Corycian senex and his setting where the Galaesus flows were epitomized in the figure of senior Galaesus who, peace- loving and just though he be, must also die38. The case of Galaesus has a particular point. He brings with him as intellectual baggage not only the splendid interlude of georgic 4, where the farmer, caught up in nature's demanding rounds, at last and for a fleeting instant takes on the individual- ity of a name. He also brings the symbolism of Tarentum itself . Lovers of Horace, for instance, will remember his mention of the Galaesus in the context of an ode which idealizes this south- ern city as one of earth's most beautiful spots, one whose citadel (arces) demands «Horace» and his addressee for their final resting-place39. This perfect landscape, Virgil would seem to say in Aeneid 7, is what becomes immediately vulnérable at the onslaught of war. The point leads us back to the connection of the old man near the Galaesus and the stag, both of whom return home sera nocte. It is not only thè loss of a pastoral 37. Aen7t 535-6. 38.

Hubbard, A Commentary on Horace: Odes II, Oxford 1978, 94-5. It is a curious fact of literary history that Propertius places Virgil singing of Thyrsis and Daphnis, that is composing his Eclogues, umbrosi subter pineta Galaesi (2, 34, 67- 8).</page><page sequence="20">126 Michael G /. Putnam Weltanschauung that the ekphrasis préfigures but of thè georgic world as well. The narrator will soon bemoan the fact that men now attend to the making of arms: vomeris huc et falcis honos, huc omnis aratri cessit amor;...40 hither honor of the ploughshare and the sickle, hither all love of the plough has yielded. War affects the further metamorphosis of deflecting a country - side away from living with the demands of nature as she reas- serts seasonal cyclicity. This mutation, and the losses it implies, also begins at the moment the ekphrasis and its model contents come to a stop. In subject matter we leave behind the bucolic and georgic worlds and replace them with history's martial narrative. We also are reminded once again that Virgil defines his ekphrasis not only by content and context but by allusion to the poetic genres of his past career. The ekphrastic pause here brilliantly recalls what the adoption of epic and the abandon- ment of pastoral and didactic poetry mean for the Virgilian career. Hitherto Virgil himself has been our primary focus for ex- planation of the ekphrasis, whether we were looking specifical- ly at its place in Aeneid 7 or at what it brings to bear from echoes of earlier Virgilian poetry. I would like now, while con- tinuing to make use of allusivity as a tool for investigation, to turn outside the Virgilian corpus and look to the relationship our ekphrasis bears to an extraordinary group of élégies by Propertius, the opening five poems of his third book. Though their exact date of publication is uncertain (internai évidence points most logically to 22 B.C.), there is no question that they were being written at the same time as Virgil was bringing his Aeneid to a close. My discussion will not pursue the impossible task of deciding priority of influence but will merely observe how imaginative interaction can shed light on both poets. For their grandeur and the spiritual consistency they display as a group the poems hâve something in common with another group of exactly contemporary poems, the six so-called «Ro- 40. 7,635-6.</page><page sequence="21">Silvia' s Stag and Virgilian Ekpbrasis 127 man» odes which open Horace's third book of lyrics as well as with the sphragis to his masterpiece, c. 3, 30. But, to generalize, whereas Horace's primary purpose is to examine certain ethical problems of deep concern to présent Rome, Propertius takes the opportunity such an introductory grouping offers to study his poetics, which is to say his poetic goals, thè magical power of his verse to subvert time and, in place of prominence, the conflict of elegy with epic and thè poet's continuing refusai to embrace epic thèmes. The first poem in particular looks to the speaker's inheritance as bard in the tradition of Callimachus and Philetas, and ex- amines the emblems which confimi him in this priest-like voca- tion. It is striking that two of these insignia Propertius shares with the ekphrasis of Silvia's stag. The first appears in the third line when the speaking «I» announces primus ego ingredior puro de fonte sacerdos Itala per Graios orgia ferre choros41. I myself first, as a priest, am setting out to bear from an un- touched source Italian mystic rites through the choruses of Greece. However complex the symbolism of the pentameter, the mean- ings of puro fonte in this context of self-revelation are clear enough. The phrase expands on primus to déclare the unique- ness of the poet's vocation and sources of inspiration, but it also speaks as well to Callimachean purity of expression and to a refined poetics that stands in contrast to the heavy expansive- ness of epic42. The distinction between epic and elegy is also central to the couplet in which the second parallel with the ekphrasis appears. Propertius has gone on to curse those who «delay Phoebus in arms,» which is to say, who hazard the inspiration of epic. The speaker's unwarlike triumph, he continues, will find his chariot drawn by tiny Cupids. Then, after offering assurance that many 41. 3, 1, 3-4. 42. On the meaning of puro fonte see W.

Putnam will praise Rome's impérial ambitions in thè form of Annales, while his own work is to be read in surroundings of peace, he addresses the Muses directly: mollia, Pegasides, date vestro serta poetae: non faciet capiti dura corona meo43. Nymphs (of the fountain) of Pegasus, grant soft garlands to your poet: a hard crown will not suit my head. Epie hardness has no part in Propertius's genius, only the plian- cy of elegy 's gentle thèmes. Given the symbolic weight of the phrases puro fonte and mollia serta in their Propertian setting, their appearance in adja- cent unes in the ekphrasis is ali the more astonishing. We are no doubt meant to imagine Silvia literally bathing her pet in an untouched source and interweaving its horns with soft gar- lands, but the other metapoetic aspects of the passage give us license to speculate here also on Virgil's deeper intent. Allusion to Propertian elegy and its emblems confirms what we have already sensed in the ekphrasis but expands another dimension to it only hinted at before. We appreciate yet again the under- stated eroticism of the description. We once more apprehend the passage as deliberately illustrating a world at peace soon to be disrupted by war. But from the symbolic aspects of the echoes we are also allowed a further glimpse of Virgilian self- consciousness. His ekphrasis, like Propertius's consécration into the mysteries of poetry, is equally a study in origination and originality, for its subjeet matter and for its cooptation of the emblems of elegy, as listed by its greatest Roman practition- er. At the moment when ekphrasis itself takes us within the world of elegy, the master-mind of the ekphrasis also appeals to a contemporary expert in an anti-epic genre so as further to define and refine the meaning of each poetic type. Propertius also helps us make the transition back into the epic narrative proper. Within the ekphrasis we have soft gar- lands, but the dura corona which Propertius awards to the wri- ter of epic soon takes métonymie shape in the «hardened far- 43. 3, 1, 19-20.

But there is one further détail of Propertian symbolism that the post- ekphrastic context takes up which serves again to emphasize the différence with the ekphrasis itself . Toward thè end of the third of thè elegies that introduce book 3 Propertius imagines the epiphany of thè muse Calliope who déclares that the speaker, whom we come near to calling the poet himself, will not be lured to arms by thè sound of a brave horse, that is, will not write epic: nil tibi sit rauco praeconia classica cornu flare, nee Aonium tingere Marte nemus45 Let not the martial summons blare for you on shrill hörn, (nor be it y ours) to imbue the Aonian mountain with Mars... We are reminded of the séquence whereby the tamed horns of the tamed stag suffer transformation first into the hörn of Iulus's hunting bow and then, as artistry further evolves, into the brass hörn of war as the consul calls the people to arms: aereaque adsensu conspirant cornua rauco. Once more that which stands as symbol in Propertius, this time for epic, not elegy, is used by Virgil literally as battling begins in earnest. Propertius can employ the hörn as part of a recusa- tioy to show emblematically that he will renounce thoughts of epic to continue on his career as elegist. Virgil embraces the hörn as the déclarer of war but his phrasing would lose some- thing special in its force were it not seen as part of a continuum with the stag ekphrasis and were not Propertius allowed to play his part in forging a link between ekphrasis and narrative, be- tween a sequestered intellectual world that shares important touches in common with VirgiPs earlier work and with Prop- ertius's contemporary aecomplishment, which is to say be- tween pastoral, didactic and elegiac poetry, and the epic's out- ward-expanding view of arms and men in history.

Putnam what is probably thè longest descrìptio of a person in thè poem, namely the ekphrasis telling us the past history of the warrior- virgin Camilla at 11, 537-84. 1 would like to conclude by com- paring the two passages to see what light their relationship can shed on one striking détail in the stag ekphrasis, namely the fact that the animal must be torn from its mother in order to suffer the métamorphoses that I have been tracing46. Why the need for violence and why the necessity for séparation from its mother for the process of humanization to commence? The story of Camilla is as original to Virgil as is the épisode of the stag. We meet her first at thè end of book 7 but she becomes a dominant figure in the narrative only in book 11 where her aristeia and death occupy a major portion of the book's last four hundred Unes. For some fifty verses before she enters the action for a final time we learn something of her past, how her father was exiled from Privernum, carrying her as a baby with him. We discover how, in escaping from his pursuers he dedicates her as perpetuai virgin to Diana, how she is reared on the milk of animais and lives the life of a huntress without thoughts of marriage. And, of course, her rôle as huntress pré- pares her, as it does Iulus, to make the easy transition to war- rior. The complementarity with the stag épisode can be succinctly put. Whereas the animal becomes anthropomorphic, leaving the wild for domesticity and a form of marriage, the opposite happens to Camilla. Humans foster the stag (nutribant) to be- come one with them whereas Camilla's father «nourishes her on the milk of wild créatures» (lacté ferino I nutribat\ suitable enough accompaniment to his own feritas47. She is brought up to choose thè country over thè city, the ferai over the human, virginity over a girl's normal course toward marriage, a man's pursuits over those of a woman, pursuits that soon lead her into the violence and bestialization of war. In the course of her adventures the poet appropriately compares her to the amazon warrior Penthesilea. 46. The violence implicit in the taming of the stag is also discusseci in an important article by E. Vance (Silvia's Pet Stag: Wüdness and Domesticity in Vergifr Aeneid, «Arethusa» 14, 1981, 127-38) who sees the taming as a perversion by the civilized Latins of the stag's true nature. 47. 7,485; 11,571-2,568.</page><page sequence="25">Silvia's Stag and Virgilian Ekphrasis 131 Virgil uses allusions to pastoral and elegy to secure in our minds the stag's adoption of a peaceful world where a creature ordinarily preyed upon by man can become a surrogate lover. In the ekphrasis of Camilla it is allusion to Catullus which tells us what will not happen in her life: multae illam frustra Tyrrhena per oppida matres optavere nurum48 Many mothers throughout the towns of Etruria desired her in vain as daughter-in-law. Virgil is referring to a moment in Catullus's second epithala- mium where thè iemale chorus compares virginity to a flower: multi illum pueri, multae optavere puellae49 Many boys, many girls desired it. Catullus's girls, whatever games they may be playing, are sharers in a wedding célébration. This world of marriage, and the lyric environment that gives it spiritual shape, must be eschewed by Camilla (and her inventor) in favor of the epic prowess that brings her glory and death. The stag is torn from its mother as it enters an apparently motherless family to be reared by humans. Camilla has no mother whose would be nourishment is replaced by animal's milk and a father's care. She stays with a double wildness that leads to war. For the stag the implication is that the world of his mother is équivalent somehow to wildness from which civiliza- tion takes him, doing violence but at the same time bringing culture. He is an animate version of the scepter of Latinus, de- scribed in book 12, which «lacks its mother» {maire caret\ eut in the forest from the bottom of a stump50. Only by being violently severed from woods and mother can it become sym- bol of politicai order imposed on their territory by the Latin fathers.

Putnam must tear from their mothers' bodies, or remove from their destructive shade, in order for them to become productive. Virgil may be suggesting hère that fatherhood (except in the twisted version of Camilla where paternity is in fact a form of maternity bordering on animality) and maybe even thè male world in generai by définition shares in the artistry of civiliza- tion-making. Viewed at large the text of the Aeneid would seem to bear out the point. There are few what we might cali accul- turating women in thè epic. Dido, dux f emina farti, woman in a man's rôle, has embarked on a civilizing mission but circumst- ances cause her doom. The Sibyl helps Aeneas on his way but only after experiencing the taming controls of thè male god Apollo. Venus has her helpful side. But when we survey the epic as a whole thè iemale spirit is largely conveyed as violent and disruptive. Juno's rage sparks the epic's initial storm and her jealous vendetta arouses Allecto as its second half com- mences. Mothers themselves as a group largely exert a negative force. Provoked by Juno they bum some of the ships in book 5, and book 7 finds Amata and her fellow «mothers set aflame by furies in their heart» (furiisque accensas pertore matres\ driven into the woods as ready victims of goddess and Fury51. And through VirgiPs genius they also hâve nearly the poem's last word. As he prépares to kill his suppliant foe at the epic's end Aeneas is described as being «set aflame by furies and terrifying in his wrath» (furiis accensus et ira /terribilis)52. As his epic con- cludes he is made to appear, as Juno did at thè start (accensa)53 and as do the mothers at the second beginning in book 7, a source of madness, not order. Silvia's stag must be torn from its mother to suffer taming, and the ekphrasis that describes her is an oasis of civility in a désert of wildness. As commentary on the largest context in which it is embedded, the epic as a whole, the ekphrasis still has something to tell us about the topos itself. It serves as vehicle 51 . 7, 392.
