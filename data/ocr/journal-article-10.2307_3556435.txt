Meanwhile they beguiled the intervening time with their talk and smoothed out a mattress of soft sedge-grass placed on a couch with frame and feet of willow. They threw drapery over this, which they were not accustomed to bring out except on festal days; but even this was a cheap thing and well-worn, a very good match for the willow couch. The gods reclined. The lines quoted stem from Ovid's description of the hospitality of the aged Baucis and Philemon to their guests.1 That these guests are actually the disguised Jupiter and Mercury is crucial to the narrative, but, as yet, Baucis and Philemon have no reason to believe that they are other than mortals (for the disguise, see Ov. Met. 8.626-7). The gods have visited a thousand other homes and a thousand times they have been turned away; what makes Baucis and Philemon unusual and earns them their final reward is their readiness to show kindness to complete strangers (Ov. Met. 8.628-30). In Book 1 of the Metamorphoses, Lycaon too is tested by a visit from Jupiter and pays for his violation of commensality by metamorphosis into a wolf (Met. 1.163-252). The corrupt generation which he represents will be wiped out in the flood from which only Deucalion and Pyrrha survive (Met. 1. 253-312). The same fate now awaits those who turned the visitors away (Met. 8.689-97). All this is familiar. What has not been noted by previous commentators on Ovid is the pun lurking in the lines quoted and its relationship to the morality tale which the poet presents.2 For those words which I have italicized in the description of the laying of the table at which the gods recline (lecto ... sternere . . . lecto) bring to mind the Roman rite of the lectisternium.3 This ritual features repeatedly in the first decade of Livy's histories,4 and the occasion of its first performance in 399 B.C. meets with the following description: duumviri sacris faciundis lectisternio tunc primum in urbe Romana facto per dies octo Apollinem Latonamque et Dianam, Herculem Mercurium atque Neptunum tribus quam amplissime tum apparari poterat stratis lectis placavere. privatim quoque id sacrum celebratum est. tota urbe patentibus ianuis promiscuoque usu rerum omnium in propatulo posito, notos ignotosque passim advenas in hospitium ductos ferunt et cum inimicis quoque benigne ac comiter sermones habitos, iurgiis ac litibus temperatum; vinctis quoque dempta in eos dies vincula; religioni deinde fuisse quibus eam opem di tulissent vinciri. 'I follow Ehwald in regarding verses 652-5a as interpolations. 2 Bbmer at Ov. Met. 8.657-8 points to his own note at Ov. Met. 6.431 'stravere torum' and to the parallels for the collocation collected there. He does not consider the possibility of a more specific allusion to the 'lectisternium'. 3 For this fairly obvious etymology, cf. Livy 22.1.19; Aug. De civ. Dei 3.17.2. 4 Livy 5.13.6-8, 7.2.2, 7.27.1, 8.25.1; cf. 21.62.8, 22.1.18-20, 22.10.9, 36.1.2, 40.59.7; 42.30.8; Macrob. Sat. 1.6.13. For discussion of the rite, its relationship to the Greek theoxeny, and its development, see K. Latte, R6mische Religionsgeschichte (Munich, 1960), 242-4; Ogilvie at Livy 5.13.6-8; M. Beard, J. North, and S. Price, Religions of Rome 1 (Cambridge, 1998) 63. For another allusion to the rite in Latin poetry, see Fordyce at Catull. 64.47.</page><page sequence="2">626 SHORTER NOTES The duumvirs in charge of the sacred rites then celebrated the first lectisternium ever held in Rome, and for the space of eight days sacrificed to Apollo, to Latona and Diana, to Hercules, to Mercury and to Neptune, spreading three couches for them with all the splendour then available. They also observed the rite in their homes. All through the city, they say, doors stood wide open, all kinds of food were set out for universal consumption, all comers were welcomed, whether known or not, and men even exchanged kind and courteous words with personal enemies; there was a truce to quarrelling and litigation; even prisoners were loosed from their chains for those days, and they scrupled thereafter to imprison men whom the gods had thus befriended.5 This ritual is a response to plague and seeks to regain the favour of the gods by their invitation to a feast.6 Couches are spread and their statues are set up in such a way as to seem to participate in the festivities. Their activity is thus conceived in strongly anthropomorphic terms. Three points may therefore be drawn from this. First, the tendency of the rite to invite the gods to eat as if they were human beings has some relationship with the Ovidian story where they actually seek to be taken for humans. Second, when Ovid refers to the employment of drapes not normally employed except on festal days, he may suggest that the hosts inadvertently replicate not just the modes of sacrifice typical of such days in general, but more specifically that particular mode of sacrificing to the gods as if they were dinner-guests which the lectisternium represents. Third, it is an important part of Livy's narrative of the rite that the symbolic feast set out for the gods in the temples is reflected in the private generosity of every house in Rome. All doors are open; all share their food freely with others; there is no discrimination between friend, enemy or even total stranger.7 The Rome at the time of this rite is therefore the opposite of the meanly suspicious and unfriendly world, every door barred to outsiders, which the gods find everywhere apart from the house of Baucis and Philemon.8 In both Livy and Ovid, the way that mortals treat gods (recognized or unrecognized) sets the pattern for how mortals should treat fellow mortals when they come to call. Two conclusions may therefore be drawn. First, it is evident that the Latin of Meta- morphoses 8.651-60 builds in an allusion to the rite of the lectisternium. Second, and more intriguingly, the behaviour rewarded in the tale of Baucis and Philemon is precisely that which is meant to filter down from the public rite to the home of the private citizen in the first lectisternium, while that which is punished is its polar 5 Livy 5.13.6-8. For this first celebration, see also L. Calpurnius Piso Censorius fr. 25 Peter = fr. 32 Forsythe = Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom. 12.9. Ogilvie at Livy 5.13.7 is surely right to claim that Livy and Dionysius share a common source for this episode in Piso. However, his further claim that the 'Bank Holiday atmosphere' which Dion. Hal. Ant. Rom. 12.9.3 specifically attributes to Piso is 'false' because unrepresentative of other performances of the 'lectisternium' requires some refinement. For, while it is true to claim that elements such as the freeing of prisoners and the reception of strangers are characteristics of the Saturnalia and their Greek analogues (see esp. Athen. Deipn. 639b-640a), it is incorrect to treat 'lectisternium' and Saturnalia as entirely separate categories. See esp. Livy 22.1.18-20 where a 'lectisternium' is followed by a 'convivium publicum' which henceforth becomes an annual part of the celebration of the Saturnalia. Piso presumably retrojects this second-century employment of the 'lectisternium' rite to its putative first performance at the start of the fourth century. It is in turn this form of the 'lectisternium' which gives Ovid's allusion its point. 6 Livy 5.13.4-5, 7.2.2-3, 7.27.1; Val. Max. 2.4.5; Aug. De civ. Dei 3.17.2. 7 Cf. L.
