November 4-13, 1982 An invitational exhibit of African art, de- signed to coincide with the 1982 African Studies Association Meetings hosted by Howard University, was conceived and as- sembled by James and Mona Gavigan of the Volta Place Gallery The stated purpose of this show was to support objectives of the recently organized Arts Council of the ASA, which seeks to encourage and promote "liaison with African scholars, artists and institutions con- cerned with the African cultural heritage," as well as to urge "the free and open . . . ex- change of ideas about works of African arts and information associated with them." "Uncommon Choices" was an uncommon show for several reasons. By bringing to- gether the selections of fifteen art dealers and galleries from the United States and abroad, it encouraged cooperation and communication among dealers. More importantly, its focus was the presentation of lesser-known genres and singular individual objects to stimulate the expression of ideas and the exchange of information among scholars, students, and other interested viewers. The occasion of the African Studies Association Meetings pro- vided an ideal time for the display of this handsome exhibit. The show's 52 objects from 32 African peoples revealed a diversity of content and form that was accentuated by unconventional characteristics of many of the pieces. An Ijo double figure, attributed to the 19th century by William Fagg, showed softer and more fluid lines than is typical of Ijo sculpture of this period. The two figures were joined by an intersection of their legs to form an X, with the female's right leg crossing over the left leg of the male. Possibly a shrine figure, it is one of only two of this type that are known. The other is in the Museum ffir Vl61kerkunde in Munich and is identified as Ibo, Oron, or Ogoni. A delicate Benin bronze dance wand with documented provenance is estimated by Wil- liam Fagg to be one of perhaps two dozen rec- ognized examples. He dated it to the 18th cen- tury. Others surmise that such wands may ac- tually have been staffs of office, such as those depicted in certain Benin plaques. The Benin culture was represented also by a fine small terracotta head. An Mbembe (Nigeria) headdress displayed grace, intricacy, and inventiveness in its form. The Janus head surmounted a long columnar neck attached to a basketry cap. On either side of the head were satellite figures-male and female-facing outward, their backs con- nected by a band of wood carved to arch over the finely articulated double-faced head. Among other objects to be noted for rare or unique qualities was a Bamana headdress selected as the cover piece for the small but tasteful fold-out brochure, designed by Del Lipp, that accompanied the show. The carved headdress, mounted on a basket cap, was dis- tinguished by two anthropomorphic heads surmounting zigzagged extensions that suggested body forms. Although a similar ob- ject is illustrated in Robert Goldwater's Bam- bara Sculpture from Western Sudan, this is not a typical form. Dominating one end of the gallery in this attractive installation were several pieces of exceptional strength, among them a powerful male figure fromnt the Basikasingo, a small group to the west of Lake Tanganyika, whose large carved figures adorned ancestral shrines. The dour stolidity of this example was relieved by unexpected angles in the planes of shoulder blades and hips, and deli- cate traceries incised into the back. A large Lobi maternal figure created an anatomical enigma by the manner in which child was joined to mother. Noteworthy for the force of its presence, a massive Bullom/Sherbro mask in the form of a ram was a rare example of the Thoma Society initiation mask studied by Carol MacCormack. In her chapter on Thoma initiation among the Sherbro or southern Bullom (Nature, Culture and Gender, eds. Carol MacCormack &amp; Mari- lyn Strathern, Cambridge University Press, 1980) MacCormack notes that Thoma, a coun- terpart society to Poro and Sande, initiates both boys and girls once every five years, and at only one site in Sherbro country During the ceremonies, six masks appear in pairs: animal-land and water; human-male and female; and finally, pure sound-consisting of male and female voices. According to Mac- Cormack, the masks, painted in the ritual col- ors of red, white, and black, are the only polychrome masks known for the Sherbro and Mende area. One long wall of the gallery displayed only Songe objects, in contrast to the prevailing di- versity of the show. Among the larger sculp- tures, a small adorned figure stood out, its face a compelling replica of a striated, kaolined Kifwebe mask. The most mysteri- ous, and as yet unidentified, piece in the show was a seated figure of clearly defined form, with chin in hands and elbows on knees. The Gavigans are to be commended for as- sembling an exhibition for the purpose of rais- ing questions rather than attempting to an- swer them. While a number of the objects are documented, many of them fall outside the boundaries of classical form and thus should stimulate the viewer to learn more about them. As a cooperative venture, the show was suc- cessful in balancing variety, consistency of quality, and individuality of the material. Nancy Ingram Nooter Washington, D.C. 71</page></plain_text>
