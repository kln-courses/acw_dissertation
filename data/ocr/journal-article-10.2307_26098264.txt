Yet mankind has largely moved beyond the arrogant dismissal of our fellow creatures as soulless machines, a divine gift for us to exploit without thought for their suffering or pain. Historians might now recognize that their, conventionally, most anthropocentric of disciplines needs to understand those animals that have contributed so much to shaping our past, to think with them and credit them with a perspective. Here, taking up the challenge laid down by the historian of the South African War Sandra Swart, an examination of the methodological issues surrounding the 'writing in' of animals into military history will identify an established tradition of 'subaltern studies' within the historiography of war, which has prepared the ground intellectually for the inclusion of non-human animals. Following this, a consideration of the experiences of horses during the American Civil War, informed by both contemporary records and modern equine science, will then demonstrate both the possibility, and the desirability, of according due attention to 'animal soldiers' in the writing of military history. Abstract Keywords animals in historiography, anthropomorphism, horses, American Civil War Sandra Swart has recently issued a provocative challenge, asserting that military his tory can be enriched by exploring the perspective of animals: noting their signifi cance not merely as flesh and blood tools but as sentient creatures that felt and suffered and whose behaviour in turn might profoundly have affected events. Her case study was the Second South African War, 1899-1902, which was notable both for the appalling suffering endured by horses and mules and because the conduct of the war, and thus its ultimate outcome, was particularly dependent upon their Corresponding author: Gervase Phillips, Department of History and Economic History, Manchester Metropolitan University, Geoffrey Manton Building, Rosamond Street West, Manchester, MIS 6LL, UK.

Firstly, I seek to situate Swart's challenge within both the context of the established relationship between military history and 'subaltern studies' (in this context 'subaltern' is a reference to 'low ranking' individuals and groups within societies, rather than low-ranking officers) and within the current methodological debates surrounding the study of animals in history. Secondly, having made a case supporting the possibility of writing animals into our work as historical actors, I shall attempt to explore the equine experience of the American Civil War. Such an approach inevitably necessitates a degree of speculation into the attitudes and feelings of a non-human animal, as well as inviting the charge of anthropomorphism. Indeed by 'giving voice' to the animal, the historian might be accused of mere ventrilo quism.2 Such an accusation, however, would ignore the demonstrated extent to which humans may claim to appreciate the perspective of animals. Consider the science of behaviour modification that requires a thorough understanding of animal psychology and recognition of the conceptual sophistication achievable (either innately or by learn ing) by some 'lower organisms'. It has been possible to establish, for example, that the pigeon can be trained to distinguish between artificial and non-artificial objects. It is also readily apparent that animals are aware of their own internal states (for example, hunger and satiety; sexual arousal and indifference) and respond in ways that can be understood and articulated successfully by humans. We can, therefore, readily disregard Descartes's principle that, because they cannot themselves express consciousness, animals must, per force, have no consciousness. A nutritionally deprived rat observed to gobble down food rapidly without hesitation and in larger quantity than normal can legitimately be described as 'hungry' (and it is not anthropomorphic to point out that its behaviour and internal state can be safely equated with a similarly nutritionally deprived human, suddenly pre sented with a large meal).3 Thus, the charge of 'anthropomorphism' is no longer quite as damning in the sciences as it once was. Many biologists now accept that 'animals are sentient and capable of consciously experiencing their emotions' and root that accept ance in evolutionary terms: 'feelings are part of the mechanism for helping animals to adapt to environmental challenges'. Scientists studying equine welfare readily identify 'negative [psychological] states such as pain, fear, hunger, anxiety and frustration' and 'positive states such as comfort or even pleasure'.4 Scholars in the humanities and social 1 Sandra Swart, '"The World the Horses Made": A South African Case Study of Writing Animals into Social History', International Review of Social History LV (2010), pp. 241-63, and 'Horses in the South African War, c.1899-1902', Society &amp; Animals XVIII (2010), pp. 348-66. 2 Swart, 'The World the Horses Made', p. 257. 3 Robert E.

Writing its history may then be possible too.5 I. Writing Horses into Military History: Some Methodological Observations Although Swart acknowledges that military historians have been better than social histori ans in recognizing the centrality of the horse to their discipline, it remains the case that his torians of conflict have often underestimated the profound importance of horses, both ridden and draft animals, to the tactical, operational, and strategic conduct of war, right up until 1945. Older works that placed the horse at the heart of their analysis of military operations, such as Charles Ramsdell's unduly neglected 1930 essay on how the fraught question of horse resupply shaped Confederate strategy in Virginia, are notable for their rarity.6 More recently, specialist historians of the horse have paid productive attention to their use in war. Ann Norton Greene, for example, devoted a chapter to the American Civil War in her study of the equine contribution to industrialization in the United States, demonstrating clearly that this was 'a war of animal power'.7 This is reflected in much recent military history too; for example, historians of the cavalry arm have long treated the animal as little more than an automaton, as unthinking and unfeeling as a tank.8 An impressive number of contempo rary authors, though, such as Stephen Badsey, Jean Bou, Robert Gaebel, Ann Hyland, Andrew Iarocci, Louis DiMarco, and Peter Edwards, have placed due emphasis on the physical and behavioural characteristics of the horse, on remount services, and on horse mastery or the care of horses in the field. Stephen Corvi, in his examination of the develop ment of British Empire veterinary services during the First World War, has recognized the emotional bond that characterized the relationship between soldiers and horses, a theme echoed in Richard van Emden's study of Tommy's relationship with the animals he lived alongside. Spencer Jones has further weakened the once orthodox view of the American 5 The literature on the evolution, physical characteristics, and behaviour of the horse is exten sive, but the following two texts are particularly recommended as accessible introductions: Stephen Budiansky, The Nature of Horses: Their Evolution, Intelligence and Behaviour (London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1997), and Mills and Macdonald, Domestic Horse. 6 Charles W.

Similarly, Emmett Essin's history of the robust and sturdy US Army mule is one of the most illuminating studies yet written of American military transport and supply, from the Second Seminole War through to the Second World War.9 In some instances, a proper con sideration of the role of the horse has had profound implications for understanding war at the very highest levels of national strategy and economic mobilization, as Daniel Roche has demonstrated for revolutionary France, John Singleton for the British Empire during the First World War, and Richard DiNardo for Nazi Germany.10 The increased prominence given to horses and mules within military history reflects broader developments, some now quite long-standing, within the wider discipline of his tory, which reflect the burgeoning academic interest in the economic, social, and cultural place of animals within human societies.11 Yet notwithstanding the positive contribution 9 Stephen Badsey, Doctrine and Reform in the British Cavalry, 1880-1918 (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2008); Jean Bou, Light Horse: A History of Australia's Mounted Arm (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010); Robert Gaebel, Cavalry Operations in the Ancient World (Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2002); Arm Hyland, Equus: The Horse in the Roman World (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1990); Andrew Iarocci, 'Engines of War: Horsepower in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, 1914-18', Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research LXXXVII (2009), pp. 59-83; Louis A.

Their atti tudes towards the horse are essentially instrumentalist, telling of how man has procured, employed, regarded, and cared for the horse. There are now scholars, such as Sandra Swart, Erica Fudge, Jon T. Coleman, Lorraine Daston and Gregg Mitman, who urge their colleagues to acknowledge animals' perspectives, reconsider the alleged human monop oly on the capacity for agency, and treat animals as historical actors rather than as passive objects of either human exploitation or magnanimity. As they do so, they invoke the legacy of the historian-activists of the 1960s and 1970s who, by recognizing the agency of the poor, of the slave, of women, and of racial and ethnic minorities, used historical writing as a form of redress for past oppression and revolutionized our understanding of the past as they did so.12 This is an invocation that military historians should welcome. Notwithstanding the unfortunate reputation that military history continues to suffer among some academ ics as the methodologically primitive, and slightly distasteful, study of battles, the discipline has, in actuality, a long and healthy pedigree of encouraging 'history from the bottom up', as evidenced, for example, in the work of Ella Lonn and Bessie Martin, who, during the interwar years, published academic monographs on the hith erto taboo subject of desertion during the American Civil War.13 Indeed, even during the nineteenth century, popular histories of that conflict had striven to include the ordinary soldier's perspective on combat and military service.14 Strikingly, too, those nineteenth-century professional soldiers using military history for didactic purposes, such as the French theorist Ardant du Picq, focused on the behaviour of the ordinary soldier in combat because, on battlefields increasingly characterized by physical disper sal, the agency of the individual became a matter of central concern to tacticians. Du Picq's work would begin a tradition of studying the motivation and behaviour of the combatant that would continue to the present through the work of military theorists, such as Samuel L.A. Marshall, and that has informed the work of historical sociolo gists, such as Tony Ashworth, and historians as diverse in their approaches to the 12 Erica Fudge, 'A Left-Handed Blow: Writing the History of Animals', in Nigel Rothfels, ed., Representing Animals (Bloomington, IL: Indiana University Press, 2002), pp. 3-18; Jon T.

It might, theoretically, be valuable, but one might legitimately ask if it is, practically, viable. The American Civil War soldier was the most literate to have fought up until that time; he left a wealth of evidence detailing his thoughts and his experiences in letters, diaries, and memoirs. Horses and mules, clearly, did not. Yet social histori ans have not allowed the absence of direct first-hand testimony to prevent them from exploring the perspective of the poor, the despised, or the illiterate, even if they have had to tease out the world view of marginalized groups from evidence created by social elites. Once again, it is worth noting that this approach has long been evident in the writing of military historians too: John Keegan has explored the experience of the ordinary combatant at Agincourt, while Michael Prestwich has considered 'the English experience' of warfare in the Middle Ages in detail, includ ing the lot of the common foot-soldier.17 There is, therefore, an established prece dent for giving voice to those historical actors who have left no direct testimony of their own. II. Comradeship: Horse-Horse and Horse-Rider Bonds in Wartime Horses are gregarious creatures. Even within a larger herd they form strong personal attach ments to other individual horses with which they spend more time engaged in mutual grooming and sharing space, standing together far closer than they would tolerate a less familiar animal. The domesticated horse, like the dog and cat, retains juvenile characteris tics into adulthood, and their 'friendships' often involve playful activity such as nipping, 15 Ardant du Picq, Battle Studies Ancient and Modern, trans.

The most significant inter species relationship, though, is that with humans. While horses have a general preference for the company of other horses they clearly form close bonds with humans too; it is well established that the companionship of an animal reduces stress and anxiety in humans, but equine scientists are now suggesting horses benefit from such relationships in a similar way. Horse heart rates decrease after affectionate contact with humans, and levels of agita tion appear to decline. Grooming is a particularly important activity: although it probably evolved originally as a behavioural mechanism to remove parasites from areas of the body such as the neck, withers, and base of the mane that an individual animal could not reach, grooming plays a key social role in creating and maintaining bonds, both between horses and between horses and humans. Its effects may be particularly magnified by the bundle of nerve tissue at the base of the neck, a favoured and clearly pleasurable spot for grooming.19 The bonds fostered by such activities as grooming are emotionally beneficial to horse and rider and contribute to the physical well-being of both too; recent studies having demon strated that strong ties of affection between horse and human significantly reduce the risks of both illness to the horse and physical injury to the rider. Science, in short, is now con firming what wisdom has long taught, as one is reminded by reading the injunctions of the classical authority Xenophon on the subject - 'see to it that the colt be kind, used to the hand and fond of men when he is put out to the horse-breaker' - and his emphasis on iove' and 'longing' between horse and man in his treatise on horsemanship.20 The evidence from the American Civil War suggests that such bonds could be created (or even carried over from pre-war association) and sustained under wartime conditions but that this was the exception, not the rule. In the majority of cases the logistical and operational demands of war, the ignorance of citizen-soldiers with little or no knowledge of horses, and ad hoc and deeply flawed procurement and remount services militated powerfully against the formation of those relationships that are so crucial to the mental and physical well-being of the horse. Even those who understood, and might have allevi ated, their misery generally chose to sacrifice them to the grim necessities of military service. Charles Francis Adams, Jr, then a captain in the 1st Massachusetts Cavalry, wrote to his mother in May 1863, telling her: you have no idea of their sufferings... I do the best I can for my horses and am sorry for them; but all war is cruel and it is my business to bring every man I can into the presence of the enemy, and to make war short. So I have one rule, a horse must go until he can't be spurred any further, and then the rider must get another horse as soon as he can seize one.21 18 Deborah Goodwin and Carys Hughes, 'Equine Play Behaviour', in Mills and Macdonald, Domestic Horse, pp. 150-7. 19 Budiansky, Nature of Horses, pp. 70-3. 20 Daniel S.

Horses are adaptable, and the importance of forming close bonds is signified by the speed with which they make such connections when separated from familiar surround ings and stablemates. While wartime procurement, be it legitimate purchase, seizure, or theft of horses, must certainly have severed many close bonds between companion ani mals, causing much anxiety and distress in the process, it did not, necessarily, preclude the formation of new bonds with other horses, fellows in a gun or wagon team, or within the horse-lines of a cavalry regiment. Yet, conversely, a number of specific conditions operative during the Civil War made it more difficult initially to establish such relations and unlikely that such bonds could be sustained for any length of time. The conditions in which horses were transported in railroad cars and thoughtlessly picketed were more likely to provoke fear and aggression between animals because they were crammed close together, a situation which provokes intense anxiety between unfamiliar animals. They were afforded little relief from this overcrowding as they were transported across country in journeys that could last unbroken for several days, and the situation was worsened by the lack of food and water as they were moved or picketed, which further heightened their anxiety and tension. A French observer, the Comte de Paris, was par ticularly struck by the conditions in which Federal remounts were held during the open ing months of the war: Immense corrals were established among the vacant lots in the neighbourhood of Washington and the Western cities to receive droves of animals emaciated by long journeys which the horse-contractors brought from Vermont and Kentucky. Taken a few days previously from the farm upon which they were grazing at liberty, never having been broken, these horses were crowded in a narrow space, carelessly picketed, badly fed, seldom groomed and without any shelter.22 Inevitably in these circumstances horses lashed out, kicking and biting at neigh bours, inflicting cuts and even broken bones, and giving every indication of their distress.23 The quotidian fact of death, too, was a powerful inhibitor in the formation and main tenance of close bonds between animals. Over the course of the conflict, it is likely that in excess of 1,200,000 horses and mules died on active service, a scale of 'wastage' that almost beggars belief. The Comte de Paris suggested that in the opening 12 months of the war 'more than one [Federal] regiment used up three horses to every man', and that 'it was only through the severest discipline that troopers were taught at last to take care of their horses'.24 According to the calculation of another French military attache, by 1863 22 Compte de Paris, History of the Civil War in America, vol. 1 (Philadelphia: Porter &amp; Coates, n.d.), p. 295. 23 R.J. Kendall, A Treatise on the Horse and Its Diseases (Enosburgh Falls, VT: 1891); F.C.

Other commentators were less euphemistic: Major General George Stoneman, appointed in 1863 as 'Chief of Cavalry', angrily described the brigade of the young brigadier general George Custer as 'great horse-killers'.25 Similarly, when Quartermaster General M.C. Meigs received yet another impatient demand for more horses that year, from Major General William S. Rosecrans, he replied by suggesting that Rosecrans husband his current stocks more carefully, observing caustically that 'We have over one hundred and twenty-six regi ments of cavalry, and they have killed ten times as many horses for us as for the Rebels. '26 The situation was similar in the artillery arm. Straining to pull a 'Napoleon' howitzer through deep mud and across streams and rivers, through broken scrub and dense wood land, as part of a six-strong team, the artillery horse had a life expectancy of seven and a half months.27 In these awful circumstances there can have been little opportunity for horses to form bonds with others of their own species. For a herd animal, with a strong preference for close social relationships, the camps and corrals of Civil War America may not only have been profoundly frightening places, they may, amidst all their bustle, have been very lonely ones too. A close relationship with a human rider or driver would have alleviated equine anxi ety considerably, and evidence for the formation and maintenance of strong sentimental attachments between horses and soldiers is easily located. Unfortunately, the circum stances of war, once more, rendered such friendships fragile and easily sundered. They are most apparent in the relationship between cavalry troopers and their chargers, espe cially in the Confederate service in the opening months of the war. This is a reflection of the South's system of procurement, for the Southern trooper rode to war on his own horse, sustaining an already established partnership. The horse was as well ridden and as well cared for as conditions allowed; understanding his dependence upon his horse, the experienced rider treasured his horse not merely as a comrade but also for its physical prowess and character. Much documentary evidence illustrates the warmth of feeling towards their mounts exhibited by Southern cavalrymen, not so much in overt expres sions of sentiment but in a robust pride in their mount's qualities and behaviour on cam paign. As a corollary, from the horse's perspective we should understand such testimony to reveal its trust in, and affection for, its rider. Consider, for example, the relationship between Jim Cochran, 2nd Tennessee Cavalry, and his 'nice bay mare' Lize, revealed in this letter to his sweetheart, 'Cousin Priscilla', written in November 1861: tell Jim he was greatly mistaken when he said Lize could not run fast, there is but twoo f.s/c] horses in the Battalion that can out run her... I learned her to stomp Yankies. I can ride her up to a man and tell her to paw a Yankee and you would laugh to see her rear up and strike the 25 The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies (Washington: US War Department, 1880-1901) [hereafter OR], ser.

She has more sense than many of the men in our Battalion.28 Lize's extemporized education for war is a reminder of the capacity of a healthy and contented horse to learn quickly. Contemporary military wisdom, such as that expressed by Colonel Francis J. Lippitt, maintained that 'three years are required for the thorough training and instruction of men and horses' for war, and in 1861 neither the time nor resources were available to even attempt such a task. The preference, therefore, was to raise light mounted units 'of a kind requiring comparatively but little time and training' to perform the tasks of outpost duties, patrols, escorts, foraging parties, reconnaissance, and providing the advance, rear, and flank guards to marching armies.29 Yet with a strong and established bond many Southern troopers and their horses showed a remarkable abil ity to adapt swiftly, even to the frightening ordeal of combat. William Blackford, 1st Virginia Cavalry, charged a Federal rearguard at First Bull Run, 21 July 1861, and his vivid account demonstrates his high regard for his horse, Comet, whose trust in his rider is implicit in his behaviour in a stressful and bewildering environment: Half the distance was passed before they saw the avalanche coming upon them, but then they came to a 'front face' - a long line of bright muskets was levelled - a sheet of red flame gleamed, and we could see no more. Capt. Welby Carter's horse sprang forward and rolled over dead, almost in front of Comet, so that a less active animal would have been thrown down, but Comet recovered himself and cleared the struggling horse and rider. The smoke which wrapped them from our sight also hid us from them, and thinking perhaps that we had been swept away by the volley, they, instead of coming to 'charge bayonet,' lowered their pieces to load, and in this position we struck them... I then plunged the spurs into Comet's flanks and he evidently thought I wanted him to jump over this strange looking wall I was riding him at, for he rose to make a leap; but he was too close and going too fast to rise higher than the breast of the man, and he struck him full on the chest, rolling him over and over under his hoofs and knocking him about ten feet backwards.30 Lacking such trust and understanding, a poorly trained horse would, in the chaos of con flict, obey the dictates of fear and excitement rather than the rider's wishes. W.H. Hitchcock, who charged with the US 5th Regular Cavalry at Gaines Mill on 27 June 1862, recalled: I rushed on, and almost instantly my horse reared upright in front of a line of bayonets, held by a few men upon whom I had dashed. My horse came down in front of the line, and ran away 28 Jim A. Cochran, letter to 'Cousin Priscilla', 28 November 1861, Filson Historical Society, Louisville, KY [hereafter FHS], Ms. MSS.CC. Although the Union prohibited the purchase of mares for military service during much of the war, the frequency of references to mares in surviving testimony suggests the rule was widely flouted. 29 Francis Lippitt, A Treatise on the Tactical Use of the Three Arms (New York: D.

The great horse breeding regions of the Upper South, Kentucky, Missouri, much of Tennessee, and trans-Allegheny Virginia, were under Federal control by mid-1862, which cut off the South's supply of remounts. However skilled and well-intentioned their riders or team sters had been, the hardships of campaign would soon begin to inflict appalling suffering on the overworked and underfed horses and mules of the Confederacy. In the end, that vital bond between horse and soldier was sundered by the continued insistence that men provide their own remounts when mounts were impossible to find, and a callous self interest began to dictate the treatment of horses. Major E.H. Ewing, inspector of field transport for the Army of Tennessee, protested that 'when a soldier is dismounted he is entitled to a furlough of thirty days to go home and remount himself. This makes [troop ers] mere horse traders, selling their animals whenever they desire to go home.'32 He was not mistaken: Private J.N. Cummings, 5th South Carolina Regiment of Cavalry, candidly wrote to his wife in October 1864, 'I was quite sick last night with chills and fever. I am better this morning. I have sold my horse to a dismounted man and will come home soon.'33 In other cases Confederate soldiers were parted unwillingly from their equine comrades; horse theft became endemic while the demands of the artillery, which had to remain mobile, also resulted in a transfer for many chargers to the exhausting duties of the gun team. In April 1862, in the Army of the Mississippi, it was felt necessary to dis mount many cavalrymen and pay them the assessed value of their horses, which were then handed over to the gunners to reinforce their depleted teams.34 For Southern saddle horses, the sustaining trust and affection nurtured by a familiar rider were early casual ties of the war. Southern horses and their riders were not quite the only example of positive and mutually sustaining human-equine relationships during the war. Under careful and experienced care, mules proved stoic and contented campaigners. Those soldiers who failed to treat them with respect, however, provoked a level of dissent that even those most doubtful of concepts of 'animal agency' would have to take seriously. Packing a mule and organizing a train were skilled jobs, but neither side could mobilize enough experienced packers. Although the mule is a hardy creature, and more physically resil ient than a horse, unequal loads and poor handling caused the animal pain, distress, and discomfort and, consequently, provoked ill-temper. One Union assistant quartermaster, Captain Charles Leib, wrote to his commander, characteristically (for a human) blaming 31 W.W. Hitchcock, 'Recollections of a Participant in the Charge', in Johnson and Buel, Battles and Leaders of the Civil War, II, p. 346. 32 Quoted in J.P.

They destroy everything, eat up trees and fences, and have nearly killed half my men.' The recruitment of skilled packers, whom Leib contemptuously described as 'French Creoles and Mexican Greasers', who knew how to work with the animal and understood the importance of having a 'bell-mare' to lead them, by drawing upon their herding instinct, changed the situation utterly, and soon could be seen '200 wild mules running loose in the streets, following, like so many sheep, an old gray horse, from whose neck was suspended a cow bell'.35 For a mule, as for a saddle horse, good com rades could make war bearable. III. Confusion, Pain, and Fear: The Experience of the Equine Recruit In the North, with the exception of a few state units, Federal government took responsi bility for the provision of mounts to its new cavalry regiments. The rush to get such units into the field quickly precluded adequate training for either horses or men. In these cir cumstances, the raw and unhappy mounts bit and bucked, shied and panicked. Captain J. Roemer, 'late an officer of cavalry in the service of the Netherlands', in writing for an American audience in 1863, commented on man's ambivalent attitude towards the horse, noting that well-attested tributes to the animal's nobility, courage, and loyalty could be contrasted with frequent complaints of its wilfulness, ill-temper, and obstinacy. 'The truth', observed Roemer, 'is that the horse is all of this, or none of it, according to the character of his education.'36 Like the green human recruits, rushed precipitately into combat unschooled in war, the untrained horses pressed into military service would react to the new and unfamiliar circumstances with debilitating bewilderment and fear. Once again, it must be acknowledged that the horses themselves could leave no direct testi mony to this effect but it is manifest in descriptions of their behaviour after being mus tered into service. It is also a valid speculation when one considers that, having been accustomed to humans who were calm and relaxed, who behaved in predictable ways, and who could, while mounted, communicate their wishes clearly through the 'aids' (the use of legs, hands, seat, posture, and voice), horses were now confronted by humans who were agitated and unpredictable, who rolled clumsily about in the saddle, and whose wishes were largely incomprehensible: the Northern cavalry recruits. The consequent difficulties that a raw cavalry regiment could experience in its earliest days were well illustrated by the ordeal of a company of the 10th New York Cavalry, undertaking its first escort duties in Virginia in December 1862, just six weeks after being mustered into service. Its captain recalled: Such a rattling, jingling, jerking, scrabbling, cursing, I never heard before. Green horses ... turned round and round, backed against each other, jumped up or stood up like trained circus horses. Some of the boys had a pile [of equipment] in front on their saddles, and one in the rear, 35 Essin, Shavetails and Bell Sharps, pp. 83—4. 36 Roemer, Cavalry, p. 421.</page><page sequence="13">172 War in History 20(2) so high and heavy it took two men to saddle one horse and two men to help the fellow in his place. The horses sheered out going sidewise, pushing the well-disposed animals out of position... Some of the boys had never ridden anything since they galloped on a hobby horse, and they clasped their legs close together, thus unconsciously sticking the spurs into the horses' sides... In less than ten minutes Tenth New York Cavalrymen might have been seen on every hill for two miles rearwards.37 Naturally, not every Northern cavalry recruit was as green as these particular New Yorkers, and the more fortunate horse may have found an experienced rider. Yet even a well-schooled horse, used to being ridden in civilian life, would not have understood the directions from its new soldier-rider, for it would have been used to being ridden with both hands to the rein, while 'the military style is, and must ever be, essentially a one handed style, for the soldier must have his right hand at liberty for his weapons'.38 Even 'well-disposed animals' would have appeared to their riders recalcitrant and disobedient, simply because they would have found the 'neck-reining' inherent in riding on a single rein confusing and not known how to respond. Only if the horse survived long enough and only if its rider were patient enough could it make the transition from bewildered recruit to responsive warhorse in the field. By the latter half of the war, the better Federal cavalry regiments had clearly fostered effective 'working relationships' between men and horses; at Fosterville, Georgia, on 19 August 1864, Colonel E.H. Murray charged with a brigade of Indianan and Kentuckian troopers against a brigade of Confederate infantry and a supporting battery: 'our men crossed and trampled the enemy's lines... the saber and the horses' hoofs were about our only weapon'.39 To a degree this demon strated improvements in standards of horse-mastery by Federal units in the field, but it would be well not to exaggerate the scale of this improvement. Cavalrymen who served under Philip Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley in 1864 still used up three remounts per year.40 As an exasperated Roemer was quick to note, many potentially fine mounts had been permanently ruined for service long before they saw the enemy in the field, because 'the injudicious selection of men for cavalry be productive of infinite mischief to their suffering mounts: What, for instance, can be expected from a stocking manufacturer, or a linen weaver who considers the horse a wild beast? We all know that such men rarely have confidence in their horses, but look upon them as their greatest enemies, against whom, for the future, they must struggle for their lives. They never learn to ride, never can preserve their balance, but hang on the horse like a senseless lump, which in order to preserve its equilibrium, unnecessarily wastes a large portion of its strength, and on this account is soon exhausted... The animal at last becomes refractory; he hangs upon the bridle, and, overcome by the pain of his mouth, curvets, rears, and bounds to escape suffering. The rider whose fear and anxiety increase, clings still closer, and labors intently by sticking with knees and heels, to make the best of the struggle. 37 Quoted in Theo F.

Thus the manner in which horses were treated and the attitudes humans dis played towards them are central elements in understanding their experience. Simple ignorance was the root of much equine suffering. In August 1862 Union General-in Chief Henry Halleck responded to Pope's complaints about his 'much broken down cav alry' by observing that 'the men are inexperienced as soldiers and they destroy their horses by hard and unnecessary riding. The strictest rules should be adopted to prevent all riding faster than a walk, except when actual service makes it necessary. In this hot season a cavalry regiment may be broken down by a few days' improper use of their horses.'42 The horses in question were probably permanently incapacitated, for high tem perature combined with muscle fatigue and strains is particularly conducive to serious leg injuries in horses.43 Even well-intentioned troopers could harm their horses through their lack of knowledge. Proper stable management (the sanitary care, feeding, watering, grooming, and nursing of horses) was hard to master and mistakes were made all too easily. Only experienced horsemen knew not to allow an overheated horse too much to drink or to bolt its oats. The importance of grooming to condition was not always appre ciated; the poorly groomed horse quickly grew listless, irritable, and susceptible to dis ease, particularly mange. Diseases of the soft tissues of the feet arose from a neglect of sanitary care; painful, suppurating saddle-galls and sore mouths were caused by poor saddling, or a failure to unsaddle regularly, and badly fitting bridles. A sudden change in diet or even an excess of food could be almost as harmful as insufficient forage, causing colic, a potentially fatal inflammation of the bowels, and digestive problems. In the win ter of 1864 the cavalry mounts of the Army of the Potomac, in quarters at Brandy Station, were fed an increased ration of grain to make up for a deficiency in hay, with ruinous consequences.44 There is, however, evidence that this ignorance was compounded by a callous indif ference to the suffering of animals, an indifference that seems altogether more morally culpable. In September 1864 Halleck was astonished to learn that in Arkansas, following the destruction of hay supplies by guerrillas, Union cavalry horses had been allowed 'to starve at post, while within a few miles the prairies were covered with rich grass'.45 The knowledge that the army would replace dead or injured animals may well have encour aged such utter thoughtlessness. Emmett Essin notes how thousands of mules were injured and disabled because lazy teamsters neglected to lock their rear wagon wheels 41 Roemer, Cavalry, pp. 380-1. 42 OR, ser.

Others left their mules in harness at the end of the day, not allowing them to roll over, failed to clean their hooves, or watered them at polluted rivers or streams, rather than taking the trouble to find an uncontaminated source.46 Similarly horses suffered because their injury or illness offered the prospect of furlough to their rider. It has already been noted how the personal bond between horse and rider originally evident in the Confederate army had been undermined by the 'horse trading' by which men could secure leave. In Federal forces a similar situation also eventually arose, in which horses were not traded but wilfully mistreated. Major General Judson Kilpatrick (who had himself earned the potentially rather ambiguous nickname 'Kill cavalry') complained of individual soldiers who deliberately 'neglect their horses and lose their equipments, knowing in either case that they will be sent in to Washington to refit'.47 In most cases the problem remained a simple selfish lack of interest in the wel fare of animals. Chaplain Henry Pyne recalled that when his regiment went into winter quarters at Warrenton, Virginia, in 1863, the troopers scoured the countryside to find materials to build huts for themselves, but the mounts were picketed in the open: 'no covering could be procured for them... and through the wind, the rain and the snow they had to remain exposed to the weather. To save the cost of a few tarpaulins the lives of many horses, worth thousands of dollars, were sacrificed.'48 For many horses the distress inherent in the transfer to military life would have been powerfully exacerbated by their individual unsuitability for military service. Relying on an ad hoc procurement system, in which poorly qualified inspectors purchased horses from the civilian market, the Federal army fostered greed and corruption by buying thou sands of animals that should never have been subjected to war's hardships. Despite the best efforts of the Union quartermaster general, M.C. Meigs, young horses under three, and old ones well into their twenties, were passed fit for service. Jaws swollen with dis temper and spavined limbs went unnoticed or unremarked by purchasers. In mid-1863 Meigs received a report that described a shipment of 100 horses from New York: only 48 were fit for service, while the rest were diseased, too young, or simply 'quite used up'.49 Later that same year General William Sooy Smith, chief of cavalry in Mississippi, com plained of 'fraud perpetrated on the Government by the inspectors and purchasing quar termasters', alleging that 'not one fifth' of the horses in the corrals at Nashville were fit for use: 'many of them are from fifteen to twenty years old, some are blind and some are badly spavined' .50 It takes no great leap of imagination to appreciate the misery that these elderly and infirm creatures must have endured in the last few remaining weeks of life allotted to them by human cupidity. Yet even well-bred horses in their prime were unprepared for the physical require ments of military service.

This records that the lieutenant's horse was valued at $425; five of his men rode horses valued at $300 or more and seven had horses valued at between $200 and $250. The least valuable horse in this small volunteer, independent company was valued at $ 150. At the time, a good saddle horse could be purchased for $125.51 Such valuable horses would have had the speed and strength required of mounts for cavalry of the line, but they were neither bred for, nor used to, the conditions of material deprivation and exposure to the elements that were the day-to-day realities of campaign life.52 In the Confederate service even the most funda mental requirements of maintaining a well-bred horse's condition were not met. For example, horseshoes, horseshoe nails, and skilled farriers were in short supply through out the war. As early as July 1861 officers in the field, such as Colonel Robert Johnston, of the 'Old Dominion Dragoons', had forwarded desperate requisitions to make up the deficiencies but had found that 'these stores have never been furnished', which left his agonized horses 'unfit for service'.53 In the spring of the following year Colonel Thomas Munford led the 2nd Virginia Cavalry during prolonged fighting in the Shenandoah Valley; the weather was hot, his regiment was 'under fire twenty-six days out of thirty', and its work 'had been eternal day and night'. His sore and hungry horses suffered accordingly: 'the roads macadamized and the cavalry unprovided with horseshoes, and being compelled to subsist them mostly on young grass without salt, I found my com mand in a most deplorable condition'.54 Similarly, in July 1864, Brigadier General Gideon Pillow noted one cavalry brigade that needed 1600 shoes, 'very many of the horses' feet being worn to the quick and utterly unable to travel'.55 The combination of hard marching and poorly fitting boots that caused so much agony to human recruits in pre-mechanized armies clearly had close parallels in the experience of these horses. For the horses and mules of the Confederate army, their situation deteriorated with each passing year. By late 1862 the horse question had begun to figure prominently in Robert E. Lee's strategic calculations, as he considered the position of the Army of 51 SCHS Ms. 43/633, South Carolina Militia Grey Riders: Assessed Value of Horses, 22 November 1861. Later in the war, scarcity of horses and chronic inflation would make it impossible to judge a horse's quality from the price paid for it. For example, in February 1865, Wade Hampton's cavalry paid $2000 (Confederate) for a single 'dark brown horse': SCHS Ms. 43/879, Certificate and Receipt for Purchase of Horse, 11 February 1865. 52 The best equine recruits for the American conflict, during which cavalry operations generally required stamina and endurance rather than speed and strength, would have been smaller, hardier horses, which were available in quantity from the west. Yet a cultural snobbishness against ponies militated against their employment east of the Mississippi. For example, Federal forces occupying Louisiana tried to find remounts locally, but thought the tough and intelligent 'Texan and Mexican mustang ponies... unfit for cavalry or artillery purposes.'

A month later stringent measures were taken to limit losses by '[impressing] upon all officers in charge of horses of the army the urgent necessity of energetic and unwearied care of their animals, and or preventing their neglect and abuse'.57 A few months later the fire-eating Virginia secessionist Edmund Ruffin confided sadly to his diary that 'it seems to me that our country &amp; cause are now, for the first time during the war, in great peril of defeat - &amp; not from the enemy's arms, but from the scarcity &amp; high prices of provisions &amp; the impossibility of the government feeding the horses of the army'. In his grandson's cavalry brigade, 'the horses have rarely had any feed but corn for some months - &amp; are generally without hay or other long provender'.58 Miserable as the experience of war for Southern horses must have been in 1861, by 1865 it had become a ceaseless torment, ended in most cases by death through starvation, exhaustion, or disease. IV. 'Faithful unto Death'? Injury, Exhaustion, Starvation The notion that horses have a particular capacity for 'faithfulness' rests partly upon their capacity to form strong bonds of mutual affection with particular individuals, and partly (but less surely) upon a phenomenon widely observed in battle for as long as man has ridden to war: the wounded horse that carries its stricken rider to safety before expiring of its own injuries. What actually drives the wounded, exhausted, or starving horse to make supreme last efforts as its own life ebbs away is a powerful instinct inherent in its evolution as a prey animal. Since the predator targets the injured and the weak, horses will expand every last effort to avoid the appearance of vulnerability. As an evolutionary strategy this characteristic may have served the horse well but it is also a characteristic that man has ruthlessly exploited, relying on the horse's capacity to endure through pain, exhaustion, and hunger in work and war. As the British hussar Louis Nolan (of Light Brigade fame) noted, 'saddles will be emptied, horses killed and wounded, but no horse, unless he is shot through the brain or has his legs broken will fall; though stricken to death he will struggle through the charge'. Indeed, Nolan illustrated his point further by writing of the rider-less charger that had lost a hind foot to a cannonball, yet rejoined his squadron and remained with it throughout the combat.59 The same phenomenon characterized the war in America. On the march, tired and foot-sore soldiers fell out, and the countryside soon swarmed with 'stragglers'; on the 56 The discussion that follows is largely based upon Ramsdell, 'General Robert E. Lee's Horse Supply', pp. 758-77. 57 OR, ser. I, vol. 19, pt 2, pp. 633, 642-3. 58 Quoted in Ramsdell, 'General Robert E. Lee's Horse Supply', p. 762 n. 7. 59 Louis Nolan, Cavalry: Its History and Tactics (London: Bosworth and Harrison, 1860), p. 302.

For the horse, instinct taught that endurance meant survival and, thus, ironically, it usually proved 'faithful unto death' to a far greater extent than did its human comrades. At Pea Ridge, Arkansas, on 6-8 March 1862, two Federal officers, Colonel Phelps and Colonel Dodge, each had three horses shot from under them. One of Dodge's unfortunate mounts had been 'struck by 20 balls' before finally falling to rise no more.60 It is worth noting in passing that horses were more likely than soldiers to suffer injury in battle because they were a high priority target. Major Charles Zagonyi, of 'Fremont's body guard', reported that 'many of my officers, non-commissioned officers and even privates, had three or even four horses killed under them', during a fierce engagement at Springfield, Missouri, on 25 October 1861. At Richmond, Kentucky, on 30 August 1862, Colonel Benjamin Hill, 35th Tennessee Infantry, detailed a whole com pany as 'sharpshooters' explicitly for the purpose of 'picking off the horses' from an enemy battery.61 The experience of Dodge's unfortunate mount would not have been particularly exceptional. The same powerful instinct that kept a wounded horse on its feet drove horses on even in the face of physical exhaustion. The bare outlines of some campaigns provide evi dence enough of the demands made of mounts. Over the course of Colonel Benjamin Grierson's raid through Mississippi and into Louisiana in April 1863, two regiments of Illinois cavalry marched 600 miles in less than 16 days: 'The last 76 miles was marched in 28 hours.' During the fighting around Bristoe, Virginia in October 1863, the 1st Maine Cavalry force-marched 90 miles without rest. In the same month, Minty's and Long's brigades, in pursuit of rebel raiders under Joseph Wheeler in Tennessee, 'marched and fought 247 miles in six days'. Brigadier General R.B. Mitchell noted that 'there was scarcely an hour during the whole pursuit that the horses were unsaddled. For days and nights together the men were in the saddle... some days making as high as 53 or 57 miles... our hasty movements giving them no time to forage on the country.' Predictably he ended his report with a request for 'a large number' of remounts to replace those 'faithful' horses that had obeyed their riders, strained their weary, aching legs, and gal loped on until death.62 Alongside exhaustion, hunger was the constant companion of the warhorse. Federal horses recuperating from marches were supposed to receive generous fodder: 101b of hay and 141b of grain a day. On active service this was an impossible ideal and horses were expected to live off the land. Yet the land was often an insufficient source of forage: on his return from the Grierson cavalry raid of 1864, Colonel Joseph Karge reported 'my horses are much worn down, having been fed for the last ten days on green corn. Many of them are foundered by the injudicious manner in which they are fed.'63 In December 1863 the colonel of the 92nd Illinois Volunteers, Mounted Infantry, reported from Alabama that: 60 OR, ser.

I am assured by my farrier and those familiar with the care of animals that it is occasioned by the want of long forage [hay]. Since leaving Decherd, 16th August last, we have been almost entirely without forage other than grain, and it in very scant quantities ... If we remain here my command must soon be dismounted.64 Attempts to carry extra fodder on the horses during campaigns simply added to their bur den. Major William Jennings, 7th Pennsylvania Cavalry, noted that forage 'packed upon the withers of the horses' did more harm than good, causing sore backs. Between 30 April and 13 September 1864 his regiment marched 902 miles from Nashville, Tennessee, to Blake's Mill, Georgia, losing 401 of 961 horses: 'the majority that died [or] were aban doned were literally starved'.65 While many Confederate soldiers were familiar enough with pangs of hunger, mass starvation was not a great killer of men during the Civil War and thus forms a unique, and peculiarly grim, characteristic of the equine experience of the war. 'Poor brutes!' wrote Charles Francis Adams, Jr, to his mother in 1863, of horses with withers swollen to three times their natural size [and] volcanic running sores pouring matter down each side ... How it would astonish and terrify you and all others at home with your sleek well-fed animals, to see the weak, gaunt, rough animals, with each rib visible and the hip-bones starting through the flesh, on which these 'dashing cavalry raids' were executed. It would knock the romance out of you.66 The 'volcanic' saddle sores, indicative of poor horsemanship, ill-fitting saddles, and the horses' loss of condition through poor diet and overloading were the bane of most nine teenth-century cavalry arms on campaign. The question of load was crucial; in addition to the rider, the weight of his dress, arms, accoutrements, ammunition, saddlery, water, and rations amounted to a further 1101b. This meant that even the horses of light regi ments, such as those raised in America, might carry in excess of 20 stone. On campaign, when the greatest physical demands were being made on the horses, troopers might be obliged to carry extra fodder or ammunition. Even heavy rain, by soaking the horseman's uniform and thick woollen overcoat, could add another 6 to 8 lb of weight.67 These were punishing burdens under which horses' backs would be lacerated, and their pace and endurance severely curtailed; exhausted, they could then fall prey swiftly to extremes of temperature, exertion, poor horsemanship, lack of nutrition, and disease. V. Disease: The Scourge of the Horse-Lines The experience of disease was markedly similar for soldiers and horses. Every concen tration of troops was accompanied by outbreaks of infectious disease.

Later, crowding, lack of sanitation, and a hostile environment and climate contributed to the spread of the familiar diseases of nineteenth-century war fare: dysentery, typhoid, and malaria. For horses, whose immune systems were further weakened by poor grooming, overwork, and lack of food, the same conditions bred a range of painful, disabling, and frequently fatal sicknesses. Standing for long periods in filth and mud caused a crippling condition known as 'hoof-rot'. In October 1863 Brigadier General Wesley Merritt, who thought that the condition was first contracted within the quartermaster's corrals in Washington, noted how 'the finest appearing horses in the command [became] disabled in one day's march'.68 Neither army ever managed to rid itself of the condition; in January 1865 Major General James Wilson informed the War Department that 'the grease-heel and the hoof-rot are again making their appear ance ... I have lost three valuable animals myself, notwithstanding the careful treatment they have habitually received. I attribute the disease to overwork, mud roads, and [lack of] long forage.'69 Worse still, the great concentrations of horses and mules with armies in the field or in government corrals facilitated the spread of infectious diseases fatal to horses, including distemper, farcy, equine influenza, and glanders, characterized by swelling of the jaw and a persistent discharge from the nostrils, the incidence of which reached epizootic proportions in late 1864. Glanders spread quickly in wartime condi tions: the infection would not become apparent for some time and thus paddocks, corrals, and lengthy railway journeys, where infected and uninfected animals crammed together, shared water-troughs, or touched noses in greeting, posed particular risks. Captain C. Baker, the chief inspector of horses, noted glumly in October 1864: 'I have no doubt but that many animals receive [glanders] in this way, by shipping sound animals in cars which have been occupied by diseased ones.'70 In July 1863, in response to the incessant problems of procurement, the shortage of remounts, and the 'wastage' of horses in the field, Federal government established the Cavalry Bureau. To some extent this bureau was able to ameliorate the suffering of some horses, although its prime motive was, naturally, military rather than humane. Civilian purchasers were replaced by cavalry and artillery officers, who were more qualified to select both riding and draft horses suitable for military service. Six new depots were established at Giesboro, DC; St Louis, Missouri; Greenville, Louisiana; Nashville, Tennessee; Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; and Wilmington, Delaware. These became the centres for the collection and training of remounts and the reception and organization of cavalry recruits. New, spacious, and airy stables were built and kept scrupulously clean. By the cessation of hostilities, and judging from a utilitarian point of view, these depots could claim considerable successes. During the two and a half years of its existence, the depot at Giesboro received a total of 170,654 cavalry horses: over 96,000 were issued to cavalry regiments; 1574 were issued to officers; 48,721 were sold; and 24,321 died. 68 OR, ser.

Of those too ill or worn out to fully recuperate, most were sold at public auction, usually for agricultural work, while less than a quarter of the veteran horses died or were destroyed.71 The hard school of war and the influence of the Cavalry Bureau's training of recruits eventually had some impact on the care of horses in the field too, yet, from the perspective of the weary, overloaded, and hungry mount in the field, there can have been little sense of relief from its suffering. 'The waste in active service is still too great,' it was reported a year after the Cavalry Bureau's establishment, 'but as the cavalry has improved in discipline and knowledge, it is believed that the horses last longer.' This slight improvement may have eased pressure on the remount service some what but it clearly indicates that, for the individual horse, the war remained an ordeal. VI. Conclusion Swart's suggestion that military history can be enriched by studying the perspective of the horse is surely correct. For example, even the most conventional operational historian must appreciate how the close bonds between horse and rider contributed to the early successes of the Confederate mounted arm during the war, and, as a corollary, how the difficulty of establishing such relationships under wartime conditions hamstrung many Federal mounted units in the same period. Similarly, the 'horse-aware' historian might look a little more kindly upon generals whose actions were genuinely constrained by the condition of their wagon-horses, gun-teams, and cavalry mounts, and a little less kindly upon their political masters who failed to understand this. That ignorance is strikingly apparent in Abraham Lincoln's sharp retort to General George McClellan when, after the battle of Antietam, the latter informed the president that he was unable to pursue Lee's retreating army because his 'broken-down' horses were simply too exhausted. Lincoln snapped back, 'Will you pardon me for asking what the horses of your army have done since the battle of Antietam that fatigue anything?' As it happened, McClellan's over worked, malnourished, and diseased horses had been very busy indeed, hauling artillery and supplies over rough terrain, undertaking extended reconnaissance missions, pursu ing Confederate raiders, and maintaining pickets covering 150 miles of the front, scat tered along the Potomac. (Interestingly, Lee had exactly the same problem following up his victory at Chancellorsville but, tellingly, the experienced soldier Jefferson Davis did not accuse him of having 'the slows', as Lincoln did McClellan.72) Yet attempting to recover the perspective of horse and mule serves a far wider purpose than informing operational history. Their experiences are integral to understanding the character of the war; it is, thus, difficult to justify leaving them out of its history. Military historians are still vulnerable to the charge that they sanitize their discipline by ignoring 71 OR, ser.

Consider, for example, Joanna Bourke's suggestion that the centrality of the act of killing has been 'glossed over' in many accounts of war.73 It is a charge that carries some weight, yet it is also the case that among those who have contributed to the study of warfare there have long been historians who have striven to explore the cruelty, the (historiographically) taboo, and the unsettling in their attempts to recover the full experience of (human) military service. There is a particularly strong tradition of this among scholars of the American Civil War, from Ella Lonn's and Bessie Martin's work on desertion, through to recent studies by Eric Dean, Thomas Lowry, and Christopher Hamner.74 It is within this tradition, perhaps, that the study of animals in warfare most properly belongs. Certainly a place for animals should be found, for to ignore animal suffering in our writing is to 'gloss over' another terrible reality of war, a reality that, once illuminated, would further help to 'knock the romance' out of the subject. 73 Bourke, Intimate History of Killing, p. 2. 74 See, for example, Eric Dean, '"The Awful Shock and Rage of Battle": Rethinking the Meaning and Consequences of Combat in the American Civil War', War in History VIII (2001), pp. 149-65; Thomas Lowry, The Story the Soldiers Wouldn't Tell: Sex in the Civil War (Mcchanicsburg, PA: Stackpole, 1994); Christopher Hamner, Enduring Battle: American Soldiers in Three Wars, 1776-1945 (Lawrence, Kansas: University Press of Kansas, 2011).</page></plain_text>
