BRUCE essays, all but one of which have been reprinted from other sources; consequently it offers no new theories with which the disciples of Alfred North Whitehead are not already familiar. The essays do, however, make a splendid exposition of the ideas which have marked the author as a great thinker and a liberal educator. "You may not divide the seamless coat of learning." That is the central thesis which runs through the book and which is demonstrated most clearly in the three chapters on the classics in education, the mathematics curriculum, and the place of technical education. Mr. White- head insists that the educated man must possess power of thought, power of action, and the imaginative initiative of art-all three. Three of the essays are distinctly the mathe- matician's treatment of "The Organization of Thought," "The Anatomy of. Some Scientific Ideas," and "Space, Time, and Relativity." DAISY B. GRENZOW PILLSBURY, W. B. The History of Psychology. New York: W. W. Norton and Company, 1929. x + 326 pp. The History of Psychology by Professor Pills- bury, who for long years has been at the Uni- versity of Michigan, is a summary of what the leading men of all ages have thought about "man's acts and his thinking."

Norton, 1929. ix + 443 pp. This is a new edition of the work published in 1925, with the first chapter completely re- written and minor corrections made throughout the volume. As the spectator of all time and all existence the philosopher must sooner or later give his view of the ultimate background of human life. Dewey has been so deeply con- cerned with distinctly human problems that it has not always seemed clear just what his metaphysical position was. This work comes nearer to an answer to this question. In his metaphysics he is a "Naturalist." But this term must not be taken as equivalent to "Materialist." Materialism is non-humanistic and finally pessimistic. Dewey is neither. The problem of life is the creation of value, and for human beings this means human value. Nature offers the raw material and the instruments for this creation. Nature is the mother of us all, and in her bosom we are nurtured. However, this does not warrant anthropomorphism, even of an idealisitic sort. Nature can become human, but it has not become merely that. On systematic classification in terms of traditional schools Dewey is very reserved. But the human has its place in the scheme of things, and we must concern ourselves with 307</page><page sequence="2">EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH BULLETIN the human knowing processes, the means of com- munication, the forms of social solidarity, as instruments in the creation of values. In the practical situation there seem to be two factors at work, in interplay upon each other, the indi- vidual organism and its environment, or "Ex- perience" and "Nature." These are the poles of the life situation. To cope with nature the experiential element must formulate an ade- quate method in science and philosophy. It must learn to face facts squarely, to gather up the contributions of history; but must learn also the art of constant readjustment. Life is precarious in even its greatest degree of stability. It must perfect its instruments and clarify its ends, which are essentially artistic and esthetic, the intrinsic values of life. To many the statement of how this occurs will seem the most significant of Dewey's works. ALBERT E. AvY MENDENHALL, EDGAR. The City School Board Member and His Task. Pittsburg, Kansas: College Inn Book Store, 1929. 104 pp. Mr. Mendenhall has designed this book to give the school-board member concise informa- tion as to his proper functions and to give this information in convenient and convincing man- ner. Since most school-board members come to the office with relatively little training for it, and are too busy to study elaborate treatises on the subject afterward this book should be of definite value. The sources of material are frankly named and include the opinions of school-board members themselves, the superin- tendent, and the college professor of administra- tion. The book will be found useful to school boards of small as well as large cities and to school superintendents. H. H. DAvis Cocss, A. W. The Pedagogical Value of the True False Examination. Baltimore: War- wick and York, 1929. x + 131 pp. A survey of the literature shows that the true-false test in common with other forms of new type examinations is superior to the old form or essay type of examination. When com- paring in terms of equal working times, the true-false test is as reliable as any objective examination. It is perhaps more difficult than any other type with the possible exception of the recall test. In a given working time, the true- false test provides a wider range of subject- matter. The chief contribution of this mono- graph is its suggestion of the objective examina- tions as instruments of instruction. The instruc- tional value is best obtained by having the pupils correct the test papers immediately after testing. In Mr. Cocks' first experiment, in a physics class, he found the true-false test 50 percent better than the multiple-choice test as a teaching device. He also found that the false statements are of about the same instructional value as the true statements. Examinations have, in addition to their values as measuring devices and instructional devices, a value as a motivator. It is concluded that the motivation value of the true-false test is probably greater than any other type of examination. This he attributes to the natural desire of pupils to distinguish the true from the false. This motivation value is increased if the test is followed by the correc- tion of the papers by the pupils themselves. The true-false test seems to be of particular value to dull pupils as an instructional device. It would probably be well for the experiments suggested in this monograph to be repeated using larger populations and a wider range of subject- matter than were available at the time the experi- mental work was done. It is also suggested that the statistical treatment be considerably refined and averages of attainment compared in terms of some standard measure of variability. It is quite possible that Mr. Cocks would have come to some other conclusion had he used better statistical treatment. HAROLD A. EDGERTON HOLLINGWORTIH, JLTA S. The Psychology of the Adolescent. New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1928. xii + 227 pp. Parents of adolescent sons and daughters will no doubt welcome this interesting study of the adolescent age as enthusiastically as will the stu- dent of psychology. The two introductory chap- ters deal with the physiological characteristics of adolescence and the primitive "pubic ceremonies." The remainder of the book presents in a most sympathetic and readable style the socio-psycho- logical problems of the adolescent age. There is an excellent chapter entitled "Psy- chological Weaning," which all parents ought to read. The discussion concerning the problems of vocational guidance, mating, and development of the personality are helpful. In the section en- titled "Additional Readings," are listed not only scientific and educational readings but also fiction and biography related to the subject-matter of the various chapters.
