<plain_text><page sequence="1">Beiträge/Contributions TORCHES", "KNUCKLE DUSTERS" AND THE LEGI TIMIZATION OF FORMATIVE PERIOD RULERSHIP David C. Grove Mesoamerica's earliest graphically expressed symbol system evolved during the Early and Middle Formative periods (c. 1200-500 BC). It is preserved today on pottery vessels and both monumental and portable stone carvings which have a distribution ranging from Central Mexico, in the north, to Honduras, El Salvador, and Costa Rica in the south. An^ understanding today of the meaning and role of most of these^ Symbols still eludes scholars, for even in its earliest manifes tations the symbol system was highly developed and ab stracted and the meaning usually implicit. Therefore, in attempting to gain an understanding of the symbolic content of the system, it is often necessary to rely heavily upon a few unique artifacts in which the abstract symbolism had been elaborated upon and made more explicit. Such rare examples are not always satisfactory nor overwhelmingly convincing as evidence, but when coupled with general patterns they can sometimes provide working hypothèses, as is the case with the following analysis. Two motifs from the early symbol system, the "knuckle duster" and the "torch", are the focus of this article. Both are hand-held objects which are depicted in Gulf coast Olmec art, but also frequently appear on artifacts from other areas of Mesomerica. The knuckle duster is an elongated object with a hemispherical bulge which seems to cover the knuckle area^ a™ of the hand (Fig. 1; Coe 1965:764-765)). The torch is a" vertical bündle of bound sticks topped by a motif which usually appears to represent a fíame (Fig. 2; Benson 1971:19 20; Cervantes 1969). The meaning of these objects has been debated in the literature, where they have been variously interpreted as ballgame equipment, weapons, or ritual-cere monial objects (Benson 1971: 19-23; Cervantes 1969; Coe 1965:762-765). The identification proposed here is very différent, and if correct, has interesting implications on current interprétations of Olmec cultural diffusion and pos sible linguistic affiliations. On Gulf coast Olmec monumental stone carvings, some anthropomorphic figures are depicted holding a pair of knuckle dusters, or a combination of one knuckle duster and one torch (e.g., San Lorenzo Möns. 10, 26). There, and elsewhere in Mesoamerica, similar combinations, as well as paired torches, are depicted engraved on greenstone celts, and held by small greenstone "baby-face" figures (e.g., Cervantes 1969: Fig. 1-14). These objects also occur on Gulf coast influenced carvings at sites such as Chalcatzingo</page><page sequence="2">(Möns. 12, 20; Grove 1984:120). Actual artifacts similar in form to knuckle dusters or torches have never been identified from Early or Middle Formative period archaeological con texts. Evidence suggests that both knuckle dusters and torches symbolize ritual bloodletters. They are part of a larger set of motifs related to bloodletting and symbols of rulership re cently identified by on-going research at the University of Illinois (Joyce et al 1986). When this larger symbol set was originally isolated, its meaning was uncertain. However, further analysis disclosed that several of the motifs have close analogs in both form and context to symbols in use over 1000 years later in Classic Maya public art. Those analogs pro vided several of the initial clues in identifying the symbols. Fig. 2) Hand held torches, a) From Cervantes 1976:Fig. 5; b) From Cervantes 1976:Fig. 13; c) From Benson 1971:Fig.20; d) From engraving on a broken jade, Salitron, Honduras, Hirth 1984: Fig. 5; e) From Gay 1971:Plate 24. Personal blood-letting by rulers is one of the most common thèmes found in Maya monumental art and hieroglyphic texts (e.g., Joralemon 1974; Scheie 1985; Stuart 1984). Maya rulers are depicted in bloodletting scenes holding bowls which contain bloodstained paper and stone or stingray spine bloodletters. When they are shown holding a bloodletter in their hand, that object is usually dagger-like in shape and is decorated by a supernatural's face and a headdress of three ^knotted bands (Joralemon 1974: Fig. 13, 24; Stuart 1984:Figs. 2b,c). The three-knotted-bands motif is common to bloodletting objects and becomes a very important identi fier of bloodletting paraphernalia, and of events related to the theme of bloodletting. According to Stuart ( 1984:15), blood letting rituals and their depictions in art demonstrated and affirmed the ruler' s ties to the supernatural realm, as nurturers of the gods. The images and objects related to bloodletting thus became important symbols of the act and of the vérifi cation of rulership itself. It has long been known that some bloodletting was practiced during the Formative period. Excavations have recovered objects such as stingray spines, shark's teeth, obsidian lan cets, and jade perforators at major Formative period sites such as La Venta (Drucker, Heizer and Squier 1957:Appendix 1), San Jose Mogote (Flannery 1976:341-344), and Chalcatz ingo (Grove 1984:108). However, the extent and ritual importance of bloodletting at those sites has remained un known. Our research suggests that a significant percentage of the early symbols, particularly on portable, "elite" green stone artifacts, were associated with bloodletting. If that interprétation is correct, then the symbolic and ritual impor tance of bloodletting to the emerging Formative elite may have nearly equalled that of the Maya.

The bündle terminâtes at at one end in a serpent head, and is also deco rated with a cleft baby-face head. From Navarete 1974: Fig. 14. The three-knotted-bands motif, so impor tant in Maya bloodletting symbolism, is also présent in Formative period art (e.g., Fig. 3; Navarrete 1974: Fig. 15-17), and is just one member of the early bloodlet ting symbol set. As Joyce et al (1986) discuss, this set includes a legless zoomorphic "shark" supernatural which is characterized by its large protruding front tooth, blank U-shaped eye, and X cross on its body (Footnote 1; Fig. 4, 5), a Y-shaped" shark's tooth" symbol, and a scalloped oval/circle motif. This latter, scalloped "sea shell" motif, seems to abstract or abbreviate the symbolic meaning of the entire legless "shark" zoomorph. A similar scalloped shell motif also appears in a bloodletting association on the Hauberg Stela, an early Maya monument (Scheie 1985: Fig. 4). The original identification of the torch as a symbolic blood letter was based on two différent types of data. The first piece of evidence came from the iconography of a large ceramic vessel (Fig. 6) originally published by Gay ( 1971 : Plate 23), in which several more explicitly depicted symbolic motifs are brought together asa coherent set. The vessel (and motifs) can be stylistically dated to the late Middle Formative period, or c. 600 BC, and may well have come from the area of Chal catzingo, Morelos (Footnote 2). The vessel's main design (Fig.6, 7) appears within a large square central panel. It is the profile of a supematural face, with along and well defined protruding front "shark" tooth, and blank U-shaped eye. This is the zoomorph associated with bloodletting and identifies the vessel's theme. Reinfor cing the theme are two Y-shaped "shark tooth" motifs on each side of the central panel. A knotted band occurs at the top and bottom of the panel, and the panel itself partly Covers a cen tral, third band. These three bands create the three-knotted bands motif, which again emphasizes the vessel's theme of bloodletting. Flanking the panel on each side are two addi tional large designs, a knuckle duster and a torch. Fig. 4) San Lorenzo Mon. 54. 61</page><page sequence="3">The torch is composed of vertical "sticks" which are held togetherby three bands. No knots are shown on the bands. The top of the torch bündle is decorated with the flame motif. This particular torch is unusual because two curved fang-like objects occur at the base of the flame, and the hand holding the torch passes through the center of the bündle. The area behind the hand is also decorated with a "fin" motif, a motif which appears elsewhere on the vessel and is another major attribute of the "shark" supematural (Joyce et al 1986). Fig. 5) One of the 4 engraved faces of the Las Limas figure. From Joralemon 1971 ;Fig. 253. Among all the torches depicted from this time period, this example is particularly valuable, for it clearly shows a large, thin, pointed object extending upward from the center of the bündle to the top of the flame. The pointed object is appar ently a bloodletting lancet. The torch thus fits in with the vessel's bloodletting-related iconography as expressed in the central panel, and the lancet serves to identify the torch as a symbolic bloodletter (Joyce et al 1986). Fig. 6) Ceramic vessel, possibly from the Chalcatzingo, Morelos, area. 62 The second line of evidence our research group used was linguistic, and strongly reinforced the corrélation between torch and bloodletter in the early symbol set. For several years now, scholars have recognized that in many Maya languages the words for pine torch and bloodletter are homophone (e.g. tah, chah: pine torch; ta, cha: bloodletter: Lipp 1985:86; Scheie and Miller 1983;Table 1,2). Such a homophone must have existed in Middle Formative period iconography as well, and the torch motif, with or without a lancet depicted, symbolized "bloodletter" and through the bloodletting ritual, rulership. The torch depicted on the vessel is decorated with a lancet within the flame. Some torches lack further décorations, but a significant number of others contain a small tooth-like motif within the flame (e.g., Fig. 2e) which Benson ( 1971 ; 19) terms the" double merlon" and Coe (1965:Fig. 43h) the "step motif'. This motif does not appear to change the symbolism of the torch. Instead, the "double merlon" can be identified as another motif of the bloodletting / rulership symbol set. Fig. 7) Drawing of the iconography of the vessel shown in Fig. 6. The vessel's torch yields additional iconographie informa tion as well. Above its fíame is a "three prong" motif, another common symbol in Middle Formative period art. The "three prong" motif is sometimes depicted above pointed objects protruding upward from cleft "celts" (Joralemon 1971:181) or as headdress frontpieces (e.g., Benson 1971: Fig. 5; Joralemon 1971:Fig. 177, 259). The motif has previously been identified as a "corn" symbol (Joralemon 1971:59-65), but because of its associated iconographie contexts its seems more likely to be related to bloodletting, and also with rulership. A corn and bloodletting /rulership association may also be possible, of course. Although the case for torches as symbolic bloodletters has some supporting data, the association between knuckle dust ers and bloodletters in far more circumstantial. The relation ship is hypothesized due to the common association of knuckle dusters and torches as paired objects. However, knuckle dusters themselves provide some additional support ing evidence as well. Although the knuckle dusters shown on weathered stone monuments appear undecorated, those on</page><page sequence="4">smaller, better preserved artifacts are frequently more elabó rate. The knuckle duster depicted on the vessel has a serrated "shell" motif decorating the hemispherical area over the back of the hand. Each tip of the knuckle duster is blunt, like those knuckle dusters shown on stone monuments, but the upper tip is also decorated to show a sharp point within the rounded area. Both the serrated "shell" design and sharply pointed tips are found on other depictions of knuckle dusters in portable art (e.g., Fig. lb,c). Finally, this knuckle duster is adorned, behind the hand, with a variation of the "fin" motif. Sharply pointed tips, and the incorporation of attributes of the blood letting symbol set on knuckle dusters indicates that they too may be symbolic bloodletters. The hypothesis that knuckle dusters and torches are part of a symbol set related to bloodletting is reinforced by a large corpus of iconography. However, it should again be stressed that the symbolic value of the torch and knuckleduster motifs was not merely the act of bloodletting but also the legitimi zation of rulership. Bloodletting by the rulers nurtured the gods and affirmed the ruler's links to the supernatural. The knuckle duster and the torch became Symbols of rulership. ' Several Middle Formative period sites outside of the Gulf coast, such as Chalcatzingo, Morelos; San Miguel Amuco, Guerrero; Xoc, Chiapas; and Chalchuapa, El Salvador, con tain monumental art. In the monuments at those sites, the hand-held torch became transformed in size into a large, tall bündle held by a personage, usually in the crook of their left arm. That bündle carries the same basic attributes of the smaller torches. It is sometimes depicted as a fíame (San Miguel Amuco; Fig. 8a), tied with three bands and with the three prong motif above the bündle (Xoc: Fig. 8b), or as a staff topped by the "double merlon" motif (Chalchuapa; Fig. 8c). These bundles or staffs identify the personage carrying them as the ruler. The torch as an important early symbol of chiefly power may be weakly reflected later in Classic period Maya hieroglyphic writing (e.g., glyph T59), where it was used again for the phonetic value "ta" (or variants). Within the hieroglyphic system it appears as an affix, and served as a locative noun in I particular verb-noun-verb constructions (e.g., Scheie " 1984:40-45). Interestingly, though clearly serving a locative Fig. 8) Large torch bundles carried in arm. a) From stela, San Miguel Amuco, Gro., Grove and Paradis 1971 : Fig. 2,3, and personal photos; b) From rock carving, Xoc, Chiapas, Ekholm-Miller 1973: Fig. 9, 10, 15; c) From Mon. 12, Chalchuapa, El Salvador, Anderson 1978:Fig. 8. function, the action in which the torch glyph was selected to be used as the locative is usually the accession of the ruler (or his wife) to a particular significant title. The torch affix appears with the title. Linguistic Implications Représentations of torches and knuckle dusters occur on a variety of artifacts which have been found in widespread areas of Mesoamerica. They are part of the large symbol system which is commonly identified as "Olmec", a system generally thought of as originating and diffusing from the Gulf coast. As I have discussed elsewhere (Grove n.d.), it is far more probable that the symbol system was not exclusively Olmec. It was a shared system and many of the symbols could have been originated by societies outside of the Gulf coast. The Olmec participated in the widely shared symbol system and utilized some of it in their art, but the wide distribution indicates that other rulers from other Mesoamerican societies also used the same basic system to legitímate and demón strate their power as well. The homophone between torch and bloodletter in the Early and Middle Formative periods, raises an interesting question regarding the symbol's origins and the language of its origi nators. Today, most Mesoamericanists accept the linguistic reconstruction of Campbell and Kaufman (1976), who sug gest that the Olmec spoke a form of Mixe-Zoque. However, the homophony between torch and bloodletter is in Mayan languages, and does not appear to exist in Mixe-Zoque. This suggests a controdiction in current interprétations. If the Olmec did indeed speak Mixe-Zoque, then this homophonic symbol originated outside of the Olmec heartland in a Maya speaking area and was adopted by the Olmec. Conversely, if the symbol was a Gulf coast Olmec innovation, the Gulf coast Olmec probably spoke a proto-Maya language rather than Mixe-Zoque. The use of the "double merlon" motif within the flame is common on the Gulf coast and elsewhere. The motif may have been an acceptable Substitute or équivalent for the pointed lancet within the flame (Footnote 3). Alternatively, if the double merlon was not a symbol whose sound value created a link between torch and bloodletter (or some quality of bloodletter) in Mayan languages, then it may have served served such a function for some other language group. Whatever the meaning of the double merlon, it also appears alone as a symbol, in non-torch contexts, some of which are clearly rulership related (e.g., Joralemon 1971: Figs. 86, 150). While it appears that the torch symbol originated among Maya speakers, its use was so widespread in the Formative period that it obviously was adopted by emerging elite in non Maya areas as well. Through the depiction of the small hand held torch or large torch bündle, Formative period rulers affirmed their participation in bloodletting and by such an act likewise legitimated their rulership. Today those symbols identify the rulers to us in the art. Ackno wledgements : Ideas in this article were stimulated by conversations with 63</page><page sequence="5">Linda Scheie, Susan Gillespie, Rosemary Joyce, Frank Lipp, and various gradúate students and skeptics. Brian Stross made valuable criticisms of the manuscript. Notes: 1 : In a recent article, Hales (1986:28) likewise identifies the "shark" supernatural, and suggests it as an antécédent to the Jester God. I agree that certain elements of the symbol set, including the "three prong" motif, do appear antécédent to that important Maya symbol. 2: Gay (1971 :Plate 23) identifies the vessel as from Chalcatz ingo. Over a decade ago I expressed the belief (Grove 1973) that the vessel was a fake because in iconography and formit was completely unlike any Chalcatzingo ceramics from the massive sample we had recovered in our excavations there. A year later our excavations uncovered a monument (Mon. 21:Grove 1984:Fig. 12) whichshares a rare basai motif with the vessel's iconography, an earth-monster mask, previously unknown inhighland central Mexico. This now leads me to believe that the vessel is authentic and from the Chalcatzingo area. 3: If perhaps the double merlon was a symbol representing "tooth" or possibly "step" (both eb in Maya), a possible homophone might have been a proto-Maya word similar to ebzah, a verb which today means "to sharpen".

ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: Fackeln, "Knuckle Dusters" und die Legitimation der Herrschaft in der formativen Periode. Im Text werden mittels neuer ikonographischer Methoden in der olmeki schen Kunst zwei gebräuchliche Motive, "Knuckle Duster" und "Fackel" analysiert. Der Autor identifiziert die Objekte als dem Blutopfer und der Herrschaftslegitimation zugehörig. Eine lingui stische Homophonie im Maya zwischen Fackel und Gegenstand zum Blutabzapfen führt ihn zu dem Schluß, daß die Schöpfer des Fackelsymbols ein Proto-Maya sprachen. RESUMEN: Torchas, "Knuckle Dusters" y la legitimación del poder en el período formativo. Mediante nuevos métodos iconográficos se analizan dos motivos corrientes en el arte olmeca, llamados "Knuckle Düster" y "torcha". El autor los identifica como objetos pertenecientes al sacrificio de sangre y a la legitimación del poder. Una homophonía que existe en la lengua Maya entre "torcha" y "objeto para el autosacrificio" le hace concluir que los creadores del símbolo "torcha hablaban una lengua Proto-Maya.</page></plain_text>
