He is sitting against the oven and waiting. He dreams of colors that the creator forgot to think of. . . . 'The fire is burning. Is it burning for me or against me? Will it give my dreams a permanent form or consume them? I know thousands of years' traditions of pottery workshops, everything that the potter can use. I know all, I used it all. But we haven't gotten the most out of it. The spirit of clay has not been subdued yet.'" (Adolf Loos, Trotzdem, 1900-1930) Within the research of frontier areas, scholars have developed an approach that sees the frontier as a zone of interaction that plays host to complex relations with the external world. The tension between frontier dwellers and the external and internal worlds is reflected in the archaeological record of frontier zones, indicating not only the influence of the center and selective adoption of central motifs, but also preservation of unique regional characteristics. First identified by Nelson Glueck, decorated "Edomite Pottery" became a fossil di recteur at Edomite and Negev sites dated to the end of the Iron Age II. While the ty pology, chronology, and distribution of the "Edomite" vessels have been analyzed at length, hardly any discussion of the sociopolitical significance of this pottery has yet been undertaken. This article analyzes decorated "Edomite Pottery" in light of the re newed study of the material culture from Tel cAroer in the Negev and with an emphasis on recent anthropological approaches. INTRODUCTION Nelson Glueck was the first archaeologist to systematically survey and excavate the ter ritory of Edom in Transjordan. He dated the decorated pottery he found there to the end of the Iron Age, noting that the clay of the painted pottery was well levigated, the vessels were well fired and in cluded a gray core and thin walls, and these vessels were painted in a distinctive style that he chose to call "Edomite" (Glueck 1934-1935:124-37; 1967: 27-28, pl. 1). During the 1960s, Crystal Bennett excavated the same area, and her work contributed much to our knowledge of Edomite pottery. Bennett excavated three Edomite settlements (Bennett 1966; 1974; 1975; 1984): Um el-Biyara, on a cliff some 300 m above the valley of Petra; Tawilan, in the hills north of Ein Musa; and Busayra, in the north of Edom, south of the Dead Sea. Bennett identified two ceramic groups in her excavations: one is characterized by typical forms and is undecorated; the other is decorated. This study focuses on the decorated group.1 Glueck's term for the decorated group of ves sels, "Edomite Pottery," heavily influenced scholarly 1 For a broad discussion of the undecorated Edomite group of vessels that appears in other regions in the southern Levant, see Na'aman and Thareani-Sussely (2006) and a response by Singer Avitz (2007). 35</page><page sequence="2">YIFAT THAREANI BASOR 359 research for many years, and the presence of "Edomite pottery" was generally associated with the presence of the Edomite kingdom (see, e.g., Beit-Arieh 1995: 303-16; Porter 2004: 388-89). During the 1990s, as a result of the political and ethnic overtones of the term "Edomite," Bienkowski suggested renaming it "Bu sayra Painted Ware," after the site where it was most commonly found. He thought this would connotatively align the ware with other ceramic assemblages from the ancient Near East that were named after the sites where they were thought to have been most prevalent (Bienkowski 1992: 7; 1995: 139). Excavations and surveys later conducted at Negev sites revealed that the distribution of Edomite pottery was not limited to the Edomite plateau but that pot tery of this type was also prominent at Iron Age II sites in the Beersheba Valley (Mazar 1985: 263-64, figs. 5-8)?at Tel Beersheba (Singer-Avitz 2004), Tel Malhata (L. Freud, personal communication), Tel cIra (Freud 1999: 194, figs. 6.83:5; 6.90:4, 16), Horvat Qitmit (Freud and Beit-Arieh 1995: figs. 4.2:17; 4.4: 11; 4.14:12; 4.17:37; 4.23), Tel Masos (Mazar 1985: 263-64), and Tel cAroer (Thareani in press). It was also prominent in the cArava, at Tell el-Kheleifeh (Pra tico 1993: 47, pi. 37-8-12) and Hazeva; and in Sinai, at the fortress of Qadesh Barnea (Bernick-Greenberg 2007a: 168-70, figs. 11.74-11.77). Only a few deco rated sherds were found at western Negev sites such as Tel Serac and Tel Haror (Mazar 1985: 264). Most of the studies of decorated Edomite ware published thus far?Oakeshott 1978; Mazar 1985; Freud and Beit-Arieh 1995; Freud 1999; Hart 1995; Bienkowski 1992; 1995; and Singer-Avitz 2004? have dealt with typology, chronology, and distribution. Despite being the focus of numerous investigations, to date there has been no comprehensive quantitative analysis of decorated Edomite pottery, primarily be cause of the relatively limited assemblage. Moreover, the treatment of the sociopolitical significance of this pottery has been limited as a result of the scholarly effort to avoid any equation of "pots and people." It seems that it was Bienkowski (1992: 7) who best expressed this tendency: Just because we call this pottery by the name "Edomite" does not necessarily mean that every place where this pottery was found was in fact Edomite. We have no evidence to determine if this pottery was lim ited to a specific ethnic group, but just to claim that this was the standard decorated pottery of the Iron Age II in a region that extended beyond the borders of Edom proper. Scholars' attempts to avoid the ethnic discussion have suppressed the development of a significant dis course about the social aspects of painted Edomite pottery. In her article on Edomite pottery, Eilat Ma zar (1985: 268-69) indeed suggested that decorated Edomite pottery is evidence of expanding commercial activity by tribes of Edomite origin into the Negev. But this suggestion was meant to explain the typological resemblance between the decorated pottery that was found at Edomite sites and that which was found in the Negev. It did not discuss the implications that this suggestion might have on understanding the social composition of the Negev population during the Iron Age II or the political and cultural role that the deco rated vessels might have played. Bienkowski and van der Steen (2001: 36-37) have claimed that Edomite pottery was produced by local tribal groups that were moving around the Negev and were taking part in the South Arabian trade system. More recently, Whiting (2007: 125-27) has argued that Edomite pottery produced in southern Palestine reflects processes of emulation and therefore this ceramic tradition selectively imitated vessels that were produced in the core area of the Edomite kingdom. Although this hypothesis explains why Edomite pot tery in Negev sites was produced from local clay, it fails, first, to address the Judaean cultural motives for this emulation, and second, to account for the presence of Edomite cooking pots of foreign origin as well as Edomite script and names in the local assemblages of Negev sites. I intend to raise for discussion questions regarding the sociopolitical and cultural functions of the Edomite pottery, but before I do, I present a basic definition of the decorated Edomite pottery and draw a layout of its geographic distribution. DECORATED EDOMITE POTTERY: TOWARD A DEFINITION The decorated Edomite assemblage includes bowls, kraters, chalices, incense burners, and stands that sometimes are wheel burnished but primarily appear with geometric schematic designs in browns, blacks, reds, and whites and with thick or thin stripes (fig. 1; table 1). Prevalent motifs include ladders, triangles, nets, triglyphs, and metopes (figs. 2, 3). Some of the vessels are also denticulated (fig. 4). It should be stressed that the decorated Edomite vessels were not imported from Edom. Petrographic analysis of the decorated Edomite vessels from Tel</page><page sequence="3">2010 "EDOMITE POTTERY" AND SOCIAL AWARENESS 37 cAroer, conducted by Yuval Goren and Mark Iserlis of the Laboratory for Microarchaeology and Metal Con servation of Tel Aviv University, has established that the majority of those vessels were made of local clay from the Judaean Hills and the Shephelah, while only a small group was composed of the greenish loess typi cal of the Negev region (Iserlis and Thareani in press). THE EDOMITE CERAMIC ASSEMBLAGE IN PALESTINE The series of decorated Edomite vessels is part of a large vessel assemblage typical of sites in southern Palestine at the end of the Iron Age (fig. 5; table 2). A few years ago, Nadav Na^aman and I (2006) raised the possibility that a series of undecorated carinated bowls usually identified as an imitation of Assyrian Palace Ware should be seen as part of a local phe nomenon whose origin is to be sought in neighboring Transjordan rather than in distant Assyria. It should be noted that morphologically there is no difference between these undecorated carinated bowls and those decorated in the "Edomite style." In addition to the series of bowls and kraters, the Negev Edomite pottery assemblage includes two types of cooking pots. The first is known in the literature as the "Edomite cooking pot" and was wheelmade. The second is called the "Negebite cooking pot" and was handmade. The latter was probably identified with the Negebite pottery assemblage by researchers because among its characteristics are the handmade design forms usually associated with local Negev no mad groups (Cohen 1986: 385-94; Heiman and Goren 1992: 145; Meshel 2002: 294-95; Bernick-Greenberg 2007b: 187-210). Yuval Goren (personal communication) has ex plained that the difference between the two types of cooking pots is merely technological: he maintains that handmade cooking pots were meant for use in slow-cooking dishes (such as casseroles), as opposed to wheelmade cooking pots, which were used for cooking dishes that required higher heat. Petrographic analysis has shown that, unlike the decorated group of vessels, which was local in ori gin, the Edomite cooking pot type that appears in Iron Age II Negev sites was made of sandstone typical of the Petra region and the Edomite plateau (Lower Cretaceous shales). As a result, the commonly held assumption that this cooking-pot type was imported from Edom has been confirmed. Moreover, the analy sis clarifies that the Negebite cooking pots were also made of clay originating from the Edomite plateau and that this vessel type was imported to southern Pales tine as well (Gunneweg and Mommsen 1995: 285-86; Iserlis and Thareani in press). DISTRIBUTION OF DECORATED EDOMITE VESSELS AT SITES IN SOUTHERN PALESTINE As mentioned above, besides being found in Edom proper, Edomite ceramics have been recovered from sites in southern Palestine from the Beersheba Valley in the north?Malhata (Liora Freud, personal com munication), Qitmit (Freud and Beit-Arieh 1995), cIra (Freud 1999), Masos, Beersheba (Singer-Avitz 2004), and cAroer (Thareani in press)?through the cArava in the east (as at Hazeva) and down to Tell el-Kheleifeh (Pratico 1993) and Qadesh Barnea (Ber nick-Greenberg 2007a) farther south. Unlike the group of vessels that imitates Assyrian ware and appears at various sites all over Palestine, such as bottles and imi tations of petal bowls (Na'aman and Thareani-Sussely 2006, with references), the distribution of the deco rated Edomite pottery at sites in Palestine is limited to the Negev and the south, with the Beersheba Valley forming the northern limit of distribution. Only a few decorated body sherds have been found west of this region (Mazar 1985: 264). The limited geographic distribution of the Edomite pottery raises important questions regarding the dec orated group of vessels. Why within the borders of Palestine is the distribution of the painted Edomite pottery and the Edomite cooking pots limited to the Negev sites? Is it possible that these artifacts reflect a politico-cultural territory, in contrast to various finds that appear in other regions in the southern Levant (such as the imitations of Assyrian ware)?2 Does the Edomite pottery found at Negev sites simply represent an Edomite occupation of Negev towns and a stylistic Edomite influence on the local Judaean population, or, as some scholars maintain, does it reflect a peace ful settlement of certain social groups (Edomites or locals)? To answer these questions, we need first to examine the Edomite pottery vessel types and the archaeologi cal contexts in which they are found. Next, we must try 21 refer here mainly to the Assyrian bottles and the flute bowls imitating Assyrian metal vessels. For further discussion, see Na'aman and Thareani-Sussely 2006, and for an opposing view see Singer-Avitz 2007.</page><page sequence="4">38 YIFAT THAREANI BASOR 359 Fig. 1. Selected decorated Edomite pottery from Tel cAroer. See table 1 for descriptions. to reconstruct the function of the decorated Edomite ware in the ceramic assemblage of the Beersheba Valley sites. Toward this end, and as a case study, we use the decorated Edomite assemblage found at Tel cAroer. DECORATED EDOMITE POTTERY FROM TEL cAROER At Tel cAroer (Thareani in press), 783 vessels and sherds attributed to the Edomite vessel groups were unearthed (table 3). Of these, 50 items (8 of which are complete vessels) belong to the decorated Edomite group (table 4), thus forming the largest assemblage of painted Edomite pottery known to date from any site in Palestine. Nevertheless, the Edomite group is only a small part (less than 7%) of the cAroer vessel assem blage, and the decorated section of this group repre sents an even smaller contribution (6% of the general Edomite group) (table 3). The 50 painted Edomite sherds comprise 8 complete vessels. But despite be ing a minority, it seems that among the general group of decorated pottery at cAroer (Edomite and non Edomite), the Edomite decorated group constitutes</page><page sequence="5">2010 "EDOMITE POTTERY" AND SOCIAL AWARENESS 39 Table 1.

It should also be noted that most of the decorated Edomite vessels were found in clean Iron Age Ilb-c archaeological contexts (table 6). The group of decorated Edomite pottery from cAroer includes bowls, kraters, chalices, incense burn ers, and stands (figs. 1, 6; tables 1, 7-9). The vessels are painted black or red and black or brown, on red or white slip. Some of the vessels are wheel burnished. The common decorative motifs include concentric circles, horizontal stripes, short lines, dots, metopes, triglyphs, ladders, nets, and schematic botanical pat terns (figs. 2, 7, 8). Examination of the designs shows that although the motifs are constant, their composi tion varies so that no pattern repeats itself exactly in the same manner. Like the group of decorated vessels from Busayra (Bienkowski 2002: 343), the Edomite vessels from cAroer were painted while the vessels were still on the wheel. Here as well, the brush control is imperfect and the thickness of stripes and decoration lines changes from vessel to vessel. Even though the majority of vessels are not bur nished, there are several cases where decorated Edomite vessels were wheel burnished. Table 10 shows that 35% of all decorated Edomite sherds from cAroer were wheel burnished. This notion also brings to mind the burnished Edomite vessel that was found at Tel Beersheba (Singer-Avitz 2004: fig. 1:1). This trend is in contrast to the decorated vessels from Bu sayra, where vessels were rarely burnished, and in the few cases when they were burnished it was by hand (Bienkowski 2002: 344). The difference between the two assemblages suggests an adjustment to the com mon Judaean technique of burnishing vessels on a wheel. Some of the vessels were decorated with plastic decoration that includes dentals or projections (figs. 1:3, 4, 6, 8, 12; 4; 5:2, 9, 20).

In the cAroer Edomite assemblage, the potters con sistently decorated eating, drinking, serving, and ritual vessels (figs. 1, 5, 6; tables 1, 2, 7-9). Most of these vessels were color decorated, but they were also occa sionally adorned with plastic decorations. Bowls make up more than 90% of the decorated types. The Edomite holemouth jar is decorated with projections, but the lack of color-decorated store vessels stands out. This is different from the pottery assemblage at Tel Malhata, where store jars decorated in the Edomite style were found (Liora Freud, personal communication). LOCATION OF DECORATED EDOMITE VESSELS IN THE URBAN SPACE Decorated Edomite vessels and sherds were found in various archaeological contexts at Tel cAroer (fig. 9; table 4). Public Context: A Caravanserai Many vessels and sherds?indeed, 50% of the decorated cAroer Edomite assemblage?were found in a longitudinal building exposed in Area A. According to our reconstruction, the building functioned as a car avanserai within the framework of the South Arabian long-distance trade network that was operating in the region during the Iron Age II (for a broader description and analysis of the Area A building in cAroer, see Thareani-Sussely 2007a). According to this recon struction, the building extended over an area of ap proximately 260 m2 (150 m2 of which was uncovered) and contained eastern and western longitudinal wings that included a row of rooms and a central open court yard (Thareani-Sussely 2007a: fig. 6). A small for tress abutted the northwestern part of the building (the Northern Unit); it contained a 25-m2 paved courtyard that was divided by a wall of columns. On the pebble pavement of this courtyard, the excavators found figu rines, animal bones, bone artifacts, grinding vessels, tabuns, and a stone basin. The pottery assemblage that was found on the floor included bowls, cooking pots, jugs, and lamps that are well known from the Judaean ceramic repertoire, along with painted Edomite bowls, denticulated bowls, a decorated incense burner and stand, a decorated krater, an Edomite holemouth jar, and a cooking pot (Thareani-Sussely 2007a: fig. 7). Excavation in the Southern Unit uncovered two central long, parallel walls, built on a north-south axis. Short intersecting walls abut the long walls to form a series of rooms (Thareani-Sussely 2008: fig. 8). In some of these rooms, brick benches and stone platforms were attached to the walls. The rooms them selves were pebble paved and were scattered with pot tery vessels, figurines, and weights. Domestic Industrial Context: The Extramural Neighborhood An extramural neighborhood located outside the fortification was excavated north of Area A, near a Roman tower. Its total area is estimated at approxi mately 7 dunams (7,000 m2). On a terrace on the south eastern slope, a relatively large paved building was found abutting the city wall. It contained four subunits and a wall of columns (Thareani-Sussely 2008: fig. 3). A unit excavated in the eastern section of the building contained brick installations, a tabun, a jar sunk into the ground, and metal slag. Farther to the southeast, an additional unit containing a clay basin, tabun, and bowl was exposed. Another part of the extramural neighborhood was revealed southwest of the Roman tower and the city wall, close to the assumed location of the Iron Age II city gate. West of the walls attributed to an Iron Age II podium, a pebble-paved floor of a courtyard was revealed with fireplaces and round stone walls that had been part of an installation. Excavation at this spot yielded a large number of vessels, figurines, and ani mal bones (Thareani-Sussely 2008: fig. 4). An addi tional stone installation that had probably served as a paved silo was found north of the courtyard. It seems that in its final stages this installation was used as a pit, since it contained soil, body sherds, and a small limestone altar. A broad building that had been used for a relatively long period was revealed south of the courtyard. It contained several paved subunit rooms, courtyards, and installations, including a tabun. The assemblage revealed in the building included Edomite bowls and cups, Judaean bowls, cooking pots, jugs, decant ers, juglets, lamps and jars, as well as weights, small stone altars, and horse and Judaean pillar figurines (Thareani-Sussely 2008: figs. 5-10).

This phenomenon should be seen as reflecting patterns of abandonment that occurred in the last stage of this road station's use (Thareani in press).

It should be stressed that this phenomenon did not result from a difference in the size of the areas excavated in the extramural and intramural areas. Both excavation areas were the same size, hence negating the pos sibility that more Edomite sherds were found in the extramural area because a larger area was exposed. It therefore seems that explanations for this phenomenon should be sought in sociopolitical factors. I discuss this below. DECORATED EDOMITE POTTERY FROM TEL cAROER: THE CHRONOLOGICAL ASPECT The assumption that decorated Edomite pottery ap peared at Negev sites for the first time toward the end of the seventh and the beginning of the sixth centu ries b.c.e. dominated research into this issue for many years (Mazar 1985: 268; Stern 2001: 288). Some scholars have maintained that Edomite influence was introduced into the Negev at the end of the Iron Age as Judaean authority in the region weakened (Glueck 1934-1935: 112-13; Bartlett 1989; Beit-Arieh 1996: 32-36; Stern 2001: 269-70). However, the appearance of an Edomite group of vessels at Tel Beersheba?and especially of a decorated Edomite bowl in Stratum II that is dated to the end of the eighth century b.c.e. (Singer-Avitz 1999; 2004)?as well as at other Negev sites such as Stratum VII at cIra (Freud 1999: fig. 6.84: 4, 6.87: 6) clarified the existence of Edomite pottery already in occupational layers that are attributed to the eighth century b.c.e. In addition to these strata, Tel cAroer Strata IV and III are dated to the eighth century b.c.e. as well (Thar eani-Sussely 2007b: 71; Thareani in press). More than 60% of the decorated Edomite vessels were found in Stratum lib, which is dated to the end of the sev enth and the beginning of the sixth centuries b.c.e. (table 11). Some 13% of the vessels were found in late eighth-century Stratum III, and an additional 6% in Stratum IV, dated sometimes in the eighth century b.c.e. If we combine the eighth-century Stratum III data with eighth-century Stratum IV data, it is clear that the results from cAroer support pushing back the appearance of decorated Edomite pottery in the Negev to the eighth century b.c.e., a phenomenon that was intensified during the seventh century b.c.e., when it reached its peak.</page><page sequence="13">2010 "EDOMITE POTTERY" AND SOCIAL AWARENESS 47 Fig. 7.

We can summarize the discussion of the pottery from cAroer as follows: 1. The distribution of the decorated Edomite pottery in southern Palestine is limited to the Negev sites, with the Beersheba Valley sites forming the north ern limit of this distribution. 2. The Edomite pottery assemblage is less significant than the Judaean assemblage. This is especially true in regard to the decorated Edomite group. 3.

Edomite storage vessels from cAroer are not deco rated with paint. 4. There is a tendency in the decorated Edomite group toward individual expression. The Edomite decoration is handmade and the decorative pat terns are unique. Although the motifs repeat themselves, they appear in differing compositions and on several vessel types. 5. In addition to the decorated vessels, the Edomite assemblage in the Negev also consists of un derrated ware, including imported cooking pots (wheelmade and handmade). Ostraca and seals bearing Edomite script and names also appear (such as qosa from cAroer and shuvnaqos from Qitmit) (Beit-Arieh 1995: 258-65; Thareani in press). 6.

Edomite vessels in the urban space were found in a public context (the caravanserai) and in domes tic contexts (the extramural neighborhood, rooms and buildings adjacent to the wall). 8. Despite the clear extramural concentration, deco rated Edomite pottery was found in one context also shared by typical Judaean vessels. 9. Decorated Edomite pottery at cAroer appears al ready in Stratum IV (attributed to the eighth cen tury b.c.e); it continued to appear in Stratum III at the end of that century, and subsequently with greater quantitative intensity during the seventh and early sixth centuries b.c.e. Having analyzed decoration patterns, vessel types, function, location in the urban space, and chronol ogy, I now address the significance of the decorated Edomite pottery in cultural terms. In other words, could the decorated Edomite pottery have a cultural significance, and what does the Edomite decoration style in the Negev assemblages represent? DECORATED POTTERY IN FRONTIER ZONES: AN ANTHROPOLOGICAL VIEW An ever-growing archaeological and anthropologi cal interest in marginal zones has brought scholars to deal with the political and social significances of the material culture of frontier sites. The frontier is defined as "the front tier" of a society and as "that part of a country which fronts another country." As the "front," the frontier defines a cultural boundary. The study of the frontier focuses on the peripheries or edges of particular societies and on the traits of the groups occupying that space. Hence, frontier research examines the causes of political and economic expan sion into new habitats, and its effects on indigenous societies and ecological systems. By this means, fron tier studies shed light on the processes that produce the spatial, temporal, and organizational variability observed in the archaeological record and enable a systematic study of non-central places (Green and Perlman 1985: 4, 9). Many studies have dealt with the frontier concept from a colonialist point of view, based on the perspec tive that the frontier is influenced in a single direction only?that the center influences the periphery but not vice versa. Thus, the frontier is depicted as a passive, static, isolated zone whose inhabitants waive their traditional way of life and assimilate into the culture of the central authority ruling the region (Lightfoot and Martinez 1995: 472-73, 475, with additional literature). A more recent approach sees the frontier as a zone of interaction and hybridization that maintains more complex relations with the outside world. On the one hand, the frontier is influenced from the center and selectively adopts elements that originate from the main source of power. On the other hand, the fron tier introduces unique regionalism and preserves typi cal traditional traits of the local groups (Parker 2002: 372-75; Thareani 2009: 188-89). The tension that exists among the inhabitants of the frontier?between the interior and exterior worlds?receives its expres sion and is reflected in the local material culture. This perception is of special relevance to the desert regions, for in this case there is a conceptual conflict that re searchers contend with, between isolationist images of deserts, on the one hand, and the human use of such environments to host webs of reciprocal relations and interactions, on the other. One useful model that helps to identify the social context of interregional exchange in frontier regions is the concept of trade-diaspora, which was developed</page><page sequence="16">YIFAT THAREANI BASOR 359 by Cohen (1969; 1971) in order to understand certain relations between Hausa traders and Yoruba commu nities in Nigeria. The strategy in which this model operates includes members of a trading group, who share kinship, language, religion, and common inter ests or other cultural criteria and who settle in market or transport centers along major trade routes and spe cialize in exchange while maintaining a separate cul tural identity from their host community. Their control over routes of movement and communication and their access to trade goods enable the trading group to func tion as intermediaries between their host community and the outside world. To maintain their ethnic unity in a changing realm, the trading group emphasizes its distinctive cultural identity, which plays a key role in their survival and prosperity (Emberling 1997: 305, 309-10; Stein 1999: 47-55, 173). Wiessner (1983), in her work on material culture, style, and social culture among the Kalahari San, coined the term "emblemic style" in regard to fron tier cultures. According to Wiessner, the material culture forms an unspoken means of communication and comes to be used as a medium in the discussion of social identity. Specific artifacts serve as emblems signifying the borders of the group and also carry dis tinct messages. According to this perspective, clear differentiation in material culture transmits a clear message about consciousness, relevance, or identity and provides a means for decoding social identity. The emblemic style embodies information about the existence of social groups in frontier zones and may require, for instance, considerable selectivity in the form and decoration of a pottery vessel. Thus, arti facts declaring social identity should be discernible in the archaeological record and should follow a distinct, limited spatial distribution. The fact that this phenom enon is limited in space and time raises the possibil ity of disparate and changing messages and opens a window for acquaintance with a specific social group. (For a discussion of the complexity of the term "style" and its archaeological implications, see Braun and Plog 1982: 509-13; Emberling 1997: 320-24.) Ethno graphic studies among tribal societies have shown that material culture plays an important role in preserving the identity of social groups in frontier zones, espe cially in times of interaction with other social groups. Contrary to Lightfoot and Martinez (1995: 485-86), who presented two mutually exclusive options for the way frontier people treat cultural influence from the outside?namely, to oppose any external influence and preserve their traditional way of life, or to stand for total cultural adaptation?it seems that the reality in the frontier is rather more multifaceted and com plex. Many scholars of the frontier point to middle stages where cultural groups choose to selectively adopt specific elements identified with the center but at the same time preserve the unique characteristics of their cultural identity (Shack 1973: 251; Wiessner 1983: 271-72; Emberling 1997: 309-10; Grahame 1998: 97-100). Furthermore, anthropological studies have sug gested that material culture plays an important role in signifying and preserving social relations within tribal societies and thus can provide information about social codes and undeclared patterns of inter action among societies (O'Shea and Milner 2002: 201). One of the most prominent elements by which groups and individuals tend to declare social identity is decoration. Wiessner (1983: 270) and Hodder (1985: 155-59) introduced cases of tribal groups in frontier zones that used decorated artifacts as a social strat egy and to preserve group borders. In both cases, the decoration formed a reaction to the presence of ad ditional social groups while it also served as a means of preserving ethnic identity in a changing, multicul tural environment. (For a contradictory approach that emphasizes the problems and risks embodied in the attempts to identify decoration as an ethnic marker and for the various ways "style" can be manipulated, see, e.g., Sackett 1982:71-82; 1986; DeBoer 1990:102-4; Jones 1997: 126; Dietler and Herbich 1998: 244-48.) Studies such as those by O'Shea and Milner (2002) about the material culture of prehistoric tribal societ ies illustrate how limited geographic distribution of artifacts is a reflection of territory and social borders. Graves (1991) examined decorative motifs among communities and tribes and found there was sub stantial and significant variability in the use of differ ent motifs from one community to the next. In other words, the attitude toward decoration in two different communities was dissimilar. Among Kalinga potters, decorative style was used to express belonging to the community and to mark borders with another group, such as the neighboring Baringo. Maintaining social identity in a changing environ ment becomes possible also due to the preservation of behavioral patterns such as eating and ritual habits. It should be stressed that the import of cooking ingredi ents and/or cooking pots is one of the main strategies for preserving eating habits. (This phenomenon is con spicuous especially among immigrant societies; see Yasur-Landau 2002:42-47, with additional literature.)</page><page sequence="17">2010 "EDOMITE POTTERY" AND SOCIAL AWARENESS 51 THE CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DECORATED EDOMITE POTTERY The location of the biblical Negev (the Beersheba Valley) at the southern edge of the Judaean kingdom dictated its role as a frontier zone. Situated at the southernmost point of the Beersheba Valley, the town of cAroer functioned as an intermediary between the settled Judaean areas to the north and the wilderness to the south (Josh 15:22; 1 Sam 30:28). It was this area where the kingdom of Judah coped with various eth nic groups, such as Judaeans, local tribes, and Arabs, rather than with a clear entity (such as a kingdom or a city-state)?a political situation that created a new cultural environment. In light of the above, it seems that Bienkowski's comment (1992: 7) that "the Edomite pottery is the standard decorated pottery of the Iron Age II in the area that extends beyond Edom" is insufficient and that the distribution patterns (intrasite and between sites) of the decorated Edomite pottery in Palestine is of some significance. The appearance of decorated Edomite pottery of local origin in the ceramic assemblages from Negev sites?a distinct phenomenon in the archaeological record, limited in time and space?enables us to view one of the social groups active in the desert frontier at the end of the Iron Age. One should add to this the cumulative evidence provided by the handmade and wheelmade Edomite cooking pots imported from the Edomite plateau and the appearance of ostraca bear ing an Edomite script and seals and inscriptions bear ing Edomite names. This array of evidence supports the view that the geographical distribution of the "Edomite" material culture has no connection with the modern concept of ethnicity or with the borders of the Edomite kingdom. Rather, the "Edomite" assemblage appeared with tribal groups of an Edomite cultural orientation that resided in the Judaean Negev toward the end of the Iron Age (Finkelstein 1992: 158-59; Na^aman 1999: 408-9; Bienkowski and van der Steen 2001: 39). In a recent article, I suggested that some of the artifacts found in Iron Age IIB-C Negev sites were used as an expression of, and as a means to declare power and social status among, local elite groups of common tribal origin that were active in the region and settled down in urban centers and maintained con nection with the Assyrian royal court (Thareani 2009). The acquaintance of these local tribal groups with the geographical sphere south of the Judaean kingdom, their control over desert routes, and their specializa tion in trade meant that they became ideal interme diaries in the South Arabian trade system. The role of agency that these tribal groups played was an im portant factor in the long-distance trade, which linked and generally harmonized the economic and political interests of the Assyrian empire and the Judaean king dom. It was for this reason that local tribal groups were motivated to settle in Negev sites, side by side with the Judaean population. Most of the decorated vessels from cAroer are lim ited to use in food preparation and consumption and ritual activities. It seems that the decorated vessels were used by people who met one another from time to time for communal eating and drinking and other ritual activities. Finding the vessels in domestic and public contexts alike supports this view. The majority of decorated Edomite vessels appear in the extramural areas of the town of cAroer. Could the decorated vessel assemblage that consists of merely a small quantity of the site's total assemblage reflect the existence of a social minority that performed its social activities on the margins of the town rather than in its center? As stated above, the bulk of the material culture from cAroer is Judaean, including ceramic vessels typical of other Iron Age IIB-C Judaean sites, as well as Judaean pillar figurines, script, names, seal impres sions, and Judaean shekel weights. The notion that these artifacts were found both inside and outside the fortified areas of the town indicates a Judaean con trol over Iron Age II cAroer, the southernmost point in the Beersheba Valley settlement system (Thareani Sussely 2007b: 73; Thareani in press). Alongside the typical Judaean material culture, the archaeological record of the site reveals a significant presence of the Edomite assemblage, including deco rated and undecorated ware, imported cooking pots, and Edomite script and names. In their article, Bien kowski and van der Steen (2001: 35-41) proposed the model of a tribal "Edomite" society. According to them, independent tribes carried out trade activities in southern Jordan and the Negev and were connected by a multiplicity of bonds and allegiances. The evidence from the extramural neighborhood at cAroer supports this perspective. The architectural and material culture found in Areas A, D, and C outside the town's fortifications point to the existence of com mercial, industrial, and domestic activities, such as the caravanserai in Area A (Thareani-Sussely 2007a), the road station in Area C, and the extramural buildings found in Area D (Thareani-Sussely 2008: 202-5), all</page><page sequence="18">YIFAT THAREANI BASOR 359 indicating the involvement of cAroer's inhabitants in trade. The stratigraphical sequence from the extra mural areas is similar to that of the intramural areas and shows that the former was a permanent settlement occupied from the eighth to the early sixth centuries b.c.e., and suffered two destructions (Stratum III, at the end of the eighth century and Stratum lib, in the early sixth century b.c.e.) (Thareani in press). More over, the local production of Edomite pottery and its adjustment to common Judaean techniques (such as wheel burnishing) distinguishes the Edomite pottery found in Negev sites from the pottery found in south ern Jordan. It therefore must be concluded that there is no evidence supporting a temporary occupation of the extramural neighborhood at cAroer or the emulation of Edomite pottery by the local Judaean population. Rather, it seems that the Iron Age IIB-C community of cAroer was composed of Judaeans, local tribes who settled in an urban environment, Arabs, and oth ers (Thareani-Sussely 2008: 207-9; Thareani 2009: 188-89). The fact that decorated Edomite pottery was found in the same archaeological contexts as Judaean pottery precludes any hard and fast differentiation between fields of occupation and intrasite settlement areas for these two ethnic groups. Nevertheless, that the great majority of the decorated Edomite vessels were found in the extramural neighborhood indicates a concentration of "Edomite" ethnic activities outside the fortified area of cAroer. The Edomite decorative style is indeed homoge neous and utilizes a particular repertoire of decorative motifs. Nevertheless, the vessels present a combina tion of motifs in changing compositions; no vessel is decorated like another. The "language" created by the decorated Edomite pottery maintained an inner dia logue among the Edomite group members, but at the same time left space for the individual expression of its members. It seems that the decorated Edomite ves sels preserved the group members' sense of belonging and identity. Equally, the decorated vessels marked the borders of the tribal territory (physically, and in terms of influence zones and ritual) and manifested social frontiers within the urban texture. Although such a conclusion can justifiably be drawn, a careful approach is required to avoid attrib uting decorative variants (compositions and various motifs) to ethnic subgroups. While some ethnoar chaeological studies attribute social meaning (such as different tribal origin) to distinctive decorative motifs, other studies challenge this idea, emphasizing that material-culture distributions provide only a limited indication of the divisions between ethnic groups (De Corse 1989; Shennan 1989: 13). "Thus different social groups may share a relatively homogenous material culture, while still maintaining 'ethnic' orientation or identity" (Lucy 2005: 91-92). The remoteness of the time period of our case study, as well as the lack of his torical evidence and the limitations of the archaeologi cal record, do not allow for such detailed argument. Against this background, I would like to suggest that in the desert frontier, in times of ever-growing interaction with the outside world, when serving, eat ing, and ritual vessels were decorated in a distinctive style, the phenomenon reflects a sharpening of tribal identity. The use of typical Edomite types is intended to preserve certain social behaviors and to communi cate a stylistic message about the ethnic identity of its users, in a milieu in which subgroups from local tribes settled in an urban environment and interacted with a variety of ethnic groups (Judaeans, Arabs, As syrians) within the framework of the South Arabian trade system. This use of Edomite pottery was con ducted in the spirit of a cultural tradition that enabled protecting an internal social identity and declaring it to the outside world. The archaeological finds from cAroer support the existence of an urban, multicultural society in an era of growing interaction between the Assyrian empire and the Judaean kingdom, an era that saw elite groups and tribal agents settling in an urban desert environment.
