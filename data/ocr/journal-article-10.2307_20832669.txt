<plain_text><page sequence="1">SAYYID MUHAMMAD JAWNP?Rl AND HIS MOVEMENT* (A HISTORICO-HERESIOLOGICAL STUDY OF THE MAHDIYYAH IN THE INDO-PAKISTAN SUB-CONTINENT) A. S. BAZMEE ANSARI I Al-Mahdi literally means the "guided one". As all guidance is from Allah (*l?? Cr" * &lt;?^*? 5^ it has come to mean one who is "divinely guided", but the word as such occurs nowhere in the Qur'an. Edward Pococke's vocalisation al-Muhdi2 which may mean the "director" or the "giver"3 is not supported by any original authority. The appellation al-Mahdi has been promis cuously used for some historic personages in the past e.g. the first 'Abbasid caliph *Abd Allah al-Safflh (see al-Yaqabi, Tar?kk, Leyden 1883, ii : 730) but its use is now restricted to only the one who will appear, according to popular belief, at the End of the World. According to a tradition the first four caliphs have been called "Khulafa aUr?shidin aUmahdiyyin^ i.e. the Caliphs who followed the right way and were (divinely) guided. There are other instances also of the non-eschatological use of the term al Mahdi e.g. the poet Jar?r5 applied it to the Patriarch Abraham, and Hassan b. Thabit al-Ansari,e to the holy Prophet. Usd aUQh?bah even uses this term for 'Ali b. Abi T?lib in contradistinction to the other three Khulafa where he is called "h?diyan mahdiyan\7 In some 'cases Husayn b. 'Ali has been given the honorific of "Mahdi ibn Mahdr? However, the term aUMahdi was not used in early Islam in its present and prevalent sense i.e. the one who is expected towards the End of Time and who will fill the Earth with equity and justice. It was first applied in this sense by the poet Ku?hthayyir *Azza' while praising Muhammad b. al-Hanafiyyah, a son of 'Ali and a step brother of Husayn b. 'Ali.9 According to Ibn Sa'd,10 Mukht?r al Thaqafi who started a campaign for avenging the martyrs of Karbala' designated Muhammad b. 'All i.e. Ibn al-Hanafiyya as the Mahdi. This Muhammad was followed by a number of persons, mostly fired with political ambition, who pretended to be the Mahdi. It may be noted here that all such pretenders were Shfites as most of *A gist of this paper was read at the 12th Annual Session of the Pakistan History Conference held at Dacca (East Pakistan) in February, 1962.</page><page sequence="2">42 A. S. BAZMEE ANSARI the SunnIs (cf. Ibn ghaldan, Muqaddimah, Eng. translation by F. Rosenthal, vol. ii, pp. 156 ff.) do not believe in the return or the emergence of a Mahdt towards the End of the World ; although they generally believe in a Restorer of the Faith who will slay the Dai jal. Bukh?ri and Muslim in their ?aiyihs do not make any mention of the Mahdt. Similarly none of the dogmatic theologians have any thing to do with him. Al-?ji, Nasafi and Taft?z?ni do not even obliquely refer to such a personage. It, therefore, follows that "in the midst of growing darkness and uncertainty?political, moral, theological?the Muslims clung to the idea of a future deliverer and restorer, and of a short millennium before (the) end."11 It appears most likely that the various Traditions that later found their way into the corpus of Hadtth literature sprang up as a result of the tumultuous conditions obtaining in the lands of Islam after the murder of Othmln ibn 'Affan, the third rightly guided Caliph. The conflict for power between 4 All and Mu'?wiyah i.e. the Fitnah and the subsequent tragic events unsettled the minds of people who began to yearn for the appearance of a Messiah who will rescue them from the state of turmoil and unrest that had gripped the lands of Islam. D. S. Margoliouth remarks, "for a quarter of a century after the death of Mohammad the Islamic world prospered exceedingly. While a constant succession of victories was crowning Moslems, a Deliverer and Restorer was not required. But as this period reached its end, the sky began to cloud over and in the year 35 (A.H.) we hear the doctrine that Mohammad himself was to return.A name was at this time produced for the expansion of this idea and this is Mehdi."12 As stated above, within half a century of the death of the Prophet, the traditions relating to the appearance of the Mahdt had gained wide currency in the world of Islam. The concept of the Mahdt in its current connotation as one who will deliver the world from injustice and corruption in religion is purely ShVite in origin.13 It is they who believe in the rafah of the Imam Muhammad al 'Askar? who they believe would reappear towards the End of the World. As these heretical beliefs became current in the strife torn lands of Islam, people began to wait anxiously for the appearance of the Mahdt. Consequently, many impostors came forward with the claim that they were the Mahdt and all those traditions which "predicted" the emergence of the eschatological personage began to be applied to all of them. A great uniformity,</page><page sequence="3">?AYY?D MUHAMMAD JAWNP?R? AND HIS MOVEMENT 43 for instance, was maintained in the names of the Mahd? and his parents. According to one tradition, it was reported that the Prophet said that the Mahd? would be a descendant of Fltimah, daughter of the Prophet and that "his name would conform to my name and the names of his parents to those of my parents."14 It has been clearly argued that most of these traditions are forged and concocted. Had that not been the case the name of the father of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah would certainly have been chang ed from 'Ali to that of 'Abd Allah. The name Muhammad is, however, common to all the pseudo-Mahd? s, such as Muhammad ibn al-Hanfiyyah, the first person in Islam to whom this appellation was applied ;15 Muhammad b. 'Abd Allah b. al-Hasan b. al-Hasan Mu?hann? b. al-Hasan b. 'All ; Muhammad ibn T?mart who claimed himself to be the Mahd? in the Maghrib ; Aba 'Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Mansar, the 'Abb?sid caliph ; the celebrated Mahd? of the Sudan and Sayyid Muhammad of Jawnpar whose personality and movement are the subject of this study. It is peculiar to Muslim masses that the credulous among them afe always ready to gather around such pretenders and lend them support. Political upheavals, social unrest, absence of peace and security and any extraordinary event invariably led to the appearance of a Mahd?, because according to the belief?an ill founded belief for that matter?of the simple Muslim masses these Mahdts heralded the approach of the Day of Resurrection. II In the Indo-Pakistan sub-continent, a man named Rukn (al Din) a resident of Delhi, was the first to claim himself to be the Mahd? ?bkir al-Zam?n during the reign of Firaz Sh?h Tughluq (752/1351?789/1388). He claimed that he was endowed with %ilm ladunn? (U^ (4*) and that he had not received education or instruc tion from any one. He further said that the names and particulars of all the created things, which were not revealed to any other Prophet since Adam, were known to him. He also claimed that the mysteries and secrets of the occult science of letters had been disclosed to him in a way never made known to any other human being and that he had composed treatises on the subject. He led people astray by his glib talk and perverted ideas maintain i?g that he was Rukn al-Din (Pillar of the Faith), Ras?l All?h. This was not only borne out by the local divines and theologians</page><page sequence="4">44 A. S. ?AZM?E ANSAR? but also the king himself heard it from the impostor. On the 'ulama declaring him to be a Kafir and worthy of execution he was mercilessly put to death by the order of FirOz Tughluq. He was flayed alive and on his death his flesh and limbs were cut into pieces.16 The movement started by him was thus nipped in the bud and faded out soon after it had made its appearance17. An entirely new chapter in the history of Mahdism was, how ever, opened with the claim of Sayyid Muhammad of Jawnp?r in 901/1495 at Mecca, while performing the taw?f.18 On his return to India in 903/1497 when he was 54 years of age, he re-asserted his claim to be the Mahdt in the mosque of T?j Khan Salar, a grandee of the kingdom of Gujarat, at Ahmad?b?d, followed by a reiteration of the claim with renewed vigour and force in 905/1499 in a village called Barhli near Nahrw?lah Pat?n (Anhilwar?) in Gujarat.19 Sayyid Muhammad was born, according to Mahdawi sources,20 on Monday, 14 Jum?d? 1, 847/10 September, 1443. No contemporary source, however, mentions either the day or the date of his birth. Even the early Mahdawi sources such as the Mawl?d by 'Abd al-Rahman (b. 903/1497), published recently under the title of Strat-i Imam Mahdz-i Maw'?d, the Matla aUWil?yat composed in 1016 A.H. by Sayyid Y?suf b. Ya'qob Hasan and Jannat aUWil?yat by Mansur Khan Burh?np?ri are absolutely silent on this point. The Shaw?hid aUWil?yat of S. Burh?n al-Din which mostly draws on the works mentioned above, makes no reference to the day of his birth. It is most likely that it struck somebody much later to name the day of the MahdVs birth as Monday which, as recorded in Sirah works, is the day of the birth of the Prophet. In this case Monday, there fore, seems to have been invented in order to make it tally with the day of the birth of the Prophet. We are strengthened in our surmise by the fact that while Shaw?hid aUWil?yat (see Notes), an early Mahdawi source compiled in the llth/18th century, clearly mentions Thursday, 19 Qhu'l Qa'dah 910/23 April, 1505 as the day of his death,21 the Mahdawi editor of another equally important and earlier source the Sir?j aUAbs?r, in his exhaustive preface, authoritatively gives it as Monday. This again is a clear attempt at tallying this day of the week with the day of the death of the Holy Prophet. Monday as the day of the MahdVs death must definitely be discarded as Djbu'l Qa'dah, 910 A.H. began on a Sunday. Similarly the names of his parents, as claimed and recorded by Mahdawi sources, are spurious. Ab?'l Fad! records</page><page sequence="5">SAYYiD MUHAMMAD JAWNP?RI AND HIS MOVEMENT 45 the name of his father as Sayyid Baddh? Uwaysi ; other sources, in cluding the Tuhfat al-Kir?m, although a much later work, give it as Sayyid iCh?n. Only the Jawnry?r-n?mah of Khayr al-D?n Il?h?b?d?, written at the behest of a British officer and by no means a wholly reliable source, gives it as 4 Abd Allah.22 The name of his mother has been mentioned in all early sources23 as Bibi ?q? Malik or ?gha Malik but the Mahdawi hagiographers have again converted it into Arninah KMtun in order to tally both the names of his father and mother with the names of the parents of the Prophet, which according to a tradition24 will be the names of the parents of the Mahd?. If will not be out of place to mention here that Ibn Khald?n has refused to believe in the mass of traditions relating to the Mahd?. Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan also took the same line. Iqb?l likewise did not believe in the appearance of the Mahdl as such, as he pointedly remarks : "He, whose Ego is awakened first, he is the Mahd? ; he is the one who will appear at the End of the World !" It appears most probable that following the Judaic belief in the appearance of a Messiah and the Christian belief in the emergence of Paraclete, the Muslims also nursed and adopted the idea of a Mahd?. Sayyid Muhammad received his early education from Shaykh D?niy?l Chisht?,25 a very learned man of his times and a murtd (disciple) and khal?fah of Sayyid R?jl Hamid Shah.26 At the age of seven he memorised the Holy Qur'an and showed such great promise even at the age of 12 that he was lovingly called Asad al 'Ulamti21 by his teacher. Thereafter practically nothing is known about him, his vocation in life, means of livelihood etc. The only significant event mentioned by the Mahdawi sources is his participa tion in a 'battle' between the ruler of Jawnp?r, Shah Husayn Sharqi (863/1458-881/1476) and one Ray Dalpat, the ruler oi Gawr. But this supposed battle is not mentioned by any historian of Bengal or India. Here again we see a clear attempt at crowning the Mahd? with the glory of taking part in Jihad against the infidels, and fighting a battle for Islam. It is not the place to discuss the nature of wars that the Muslim kings of India waged against the local non Muslim princes and potentates to determine how far these can be justifiably called holy wars or given the sanctimonious name of Jihad. It is a well-established fact that practically the army of every</page><page sequence="6">4? A. S. BAiZM?? ANSAS.? Muslim king or crowned head of India had among its officers non Muslims as well, some of whom even took the field at the head of the invading Muslim forces against their non-Muslim adversaries. In later times we find Muslims like Ibrahim G?rd? and Mir Habib fighting for their non-Muslim overlords against their co-religionists. Therefore, even this claim that Sayyid Muhammad fought a holy war against a non-Muslim king and killed him in battle does not hold good or add to the personal glory of the Sayyid. Ill In 887/1482 at the age of forty he left on a pilgrimage to Mecca in the company of seventeen persons. On the way he passed through D?n?p?r, Kalp?, Chander?, J?p?nir, Manda, Burhlnp?r, Dawlat?bad, Ahmadnagar, Bidar, Gulbargah, ?ij?p?r and Chetp?r, a small town in the district of Gulbargah, staying at every place for a considerable period. From the last mentioned place he proceeded to Dhabol Bunder in the end of 900/1495 after having spent almost four years in his wanderings winning some converts. He then left for Mecca where he reached the same year. By this time the number of his companions had swelled to 360. It was in Mecca that he announced, while performing the taw?f, that he was the Mahd?. The 'ufama of Mecca did not at all take him seriously. Mahdawi sources, however, claim that 'Ali al-Muttaqi, the author of Kanz al-Umm?l, who then happened to stay at Mecca, accepted his claim.28 This is not substantiated by any independent source. It remains a fact that 'Ali al-Muttaqi wrote two books?"Ris?lah al-Radd" and "al-Burh?n fi 'al?m?t Mahd? ?khir al-Zam?n" in refutation of the claim made by Sayyid Muhammad. On his return to India in 903/1497, Sayyid Muhammad reiterated his claim at Ahmad?b?d and two years later at Barhli, near Patan. Many of the Gujarat 'ulama, who did not take him seriously in the beginning, now decided to rebut his claim as he had been able to attract wide-spread public attention through a life of extreme piety, devotion to religion, his erudition and oratory. He came into conflict for the first time with the orthodox 'ulama at Ahmad?b?d. One day he publicly announced that he could see God with his physical eyes and also make others see Him. This was a very tall and heretical claim bordering on blasphemy, and gave rise to great hostility towards him. The 'ulama' concertedly challenged him to prove his claim, but the discussions and disputations that followed established the theological superiority</page><page sequence="7">SAYYID MUHAMMAD JAWNPUrI AND HIS MOVEMENT 47 of the Sayyid who practically vanquished his adversaries. This led to the 'ulama taking more effective measures in order to put a stop to his growing activities. A fatw? was consequently drawn up in which he was denounced as a heretic and condemned to death. Mawl?n? Muhammad Taj, one of the leading 'ulama and scholars of Ahmadab?d, not only refused to sign the fatw? against Sayyid Muhammad but also admonished his brother 'ulama and asked them to desist from demanding the death penalty for the Sayyid.29 However, the opposition and hostility towards him and his sup porters had risen to such a pitch that he was compelled to leave Ahmadab?d for Barhl? where he stayed for one and a half years. In 905/1499 while sojourning at this villagehe repeated his claim and invited contemporary palatines and potentates to accept him as the Mahdt. The Mahdawis claim that amcng others, Burh?n Nizam Shah of Ahmadnagar, Mahmod Begar? of Gujarat and Zubda? al-Mulk 'Uthm?n Kh?n of J?lore were convinced of the truth of his claim. The conversion of the chief of Jalore, 'Uthm?n Khan Afghan, is however not more than a myth, a pure fabrication. According to the official history of the rulers of Jalore (later of P?lanp?r), the Tartkh-i P?lanp?r (Bombay 1912, i, 16) Zubdat al Mulk 'Uthm?n Kh?n accepted Mahdism towards the end of his life. The same source also very clearly states that 'Uthm?n Kh?n died in 1540 Bikrami/889 A.H./1484 A.C., after a rule of 23 years. All sources agree, including the Ta'r?kk-i P?lanp?r (i, 25) that Sayyid Muhammad announced himself to be the Mahdt for the first time at Mecca in 901/1495. The Sayyid visited Jalore for the first time in 906/1500 or 907/1501 (cf. Tar?Mk-i P?lanp?r, i, 29), after he had publicly re-asserted his claim to Mahdism for the third and the last time at Barhl?, 3 miles from Anhilw?r? Pat?n, in 905/1499. 'Uthm?n Khin was dead in 889/1484 i.e. two years before Sayyid Muhammad claimed himself to be the Mahdi for the first time at Mecca. The statement of Mahdawi writers that 'Uthm?n Kfa?n of Jalore, among others, accepted Sayyid Muhammad as the Mahdt is totally baseless and without foundation. It is most probable that the successor of 'Uthm?n Kh?n, Malik Buddhan Kh?n son of Sal?r Khan, might have accepted the Sayyid as the Mahdt. A majority of the Muslim population of P?lanp?r, the later seat of government of the J?loris, even up to this day, continues to profess the Mahdawi faith. The descendants of Kh?tim al-Murshid Sayyid Mahmod, son and successor of Sayyid ghwandm?r, a son-in-law of the Mahdt,</page><page sequence="8">48 A. S. BAZM?E ANSARI settled at P?lanpur and were held in great esteem by the ruling family and the local people. Even to this day they are known as the Pir-z?dag?n and wield great influence both over the classes and the masses, by virtue of their being the spiritual guides of the members of the ex-ruling family of P?lanp?r, now merged with the new Indian state of Saurashtra. A P?lanp?ri scholar Malik Sulaymln (d. 1232/1816-7) has written a detailed history of the chiefs of Pal?np?r with particular reference to the Mahd? and the Mahdaw?s of the region. Much useful and inside information about the sect, its activities etc. can be gleaned from his book entitled "Kbatam-i Sulaym?nz", still in manuscript.* The author of the Tdrikk-i P?lanp?r seems to have made good use of this work, an important Mahdawi source for the events in Gujarat and the neighbouring territories, in which the Mahdaw?s were involved. At Ahmadnagar, the seat of the Niz?m Sh?h? dynasty, the local ruler Ahmad Nizam al-Mulk, having been greatly impressed with the Sayyid's oratory, piety and depth of religious knowledge came to regard him as a very venerable holy-man who possessed thaumaturgical powers. As Ahmad Nizam al-Mulk had no male issue he approached the Sayyid in the hope of seeking his benedic tion in getting a son to succeed him. The Sayyid on learning of the king's desire gave him a betel-leaf (pan k? biro) to chew, as a token of his being blessed with a son. Luckily the prophecy of the Sayyid came true and a son was born to him. This chance-birth of a male issue strengthened Ahmad Niz?m al-Mulk's belief in the Sayyid's being the promised Mahdz and he, along with his courtiers and noble-men, accepted the former as the Mahdz. In-later times this boy, Burhan Nizam al-Mulk, became so much devoted to a kkalifah of the Mahdz, Sayyid Khwandmlr, that he gave his daughter in marriage to the grandson of the Sayyid. The acceptance of the Sayyid by no less a person than the ruler himself had far-reaching consequences and within a short period of time practically the entire Muslim population of Ahmadnagar was converted to Mahdism. On his accession to the throne Burhan Nizam al-Mulk took strong measures for the wider propagation of the faith of the Mahdz. With this end in view he invited some of the leading Mahda w?s such as Sh?h Niz?m, Miyan Dil?war and Miy?n Ni'mat to settle at Ahmadnagar. With the arrival of these eminent persons, high-up *I learn this work has since been published.</page><page sequence="9">SAYY?D MUHAMMAD JAWNP?RI AND H?S MOVEMENT in the Mahdaw? hierarchy, the movement received a great impetus. Mahdism spread like wild fire throughout the dominions of the Niz?m-Sh?his and even up to this day heavy concentrations of Mahdaw?s are generally found in the Deccan and the areas adjoin ing Ahmadnagar and its suburbs. Under the influence of a powerful military commander, Jamal Khan Mahdaw?, one of the Niz?m Sh?hi rulers, Ism?'il Niz?m Sh?h b. Burh?n Niz?m Sii?h II who had ascended the throne on the deposition of his cousin Mir?n Husayn Nizam Sh?h, readily accepted the Mahdaw? faith and became one of its staunch protagonists and supporters. He was such a zealous Mahdaw? that "he commenced his reign by persecuting all those not of his own persuasion and by promoting to high offices, and retaining about his person, such as were Mahdevis" (Firishtah, Brigg's translation, ii : 277). All power, during his short rule of two years (1589-1591 A.C.) was in the hands of the Mahdawis, who were most intolerant of all those not being of the same persuasion. Among those who had to quit Ahmadnagar due to the policy of persecution and expropriation, was the noted historian Muhammad Q?sim Firishtah who had taken refuge with the Court at Bij?p?r. The high-handedness of Jamal Khan Mahdaw?, who commanded all power in the name of the King, soon gave rise to a feeling of discontent and disaffection. The chiefs of Ber?r also did not look upon the events in Ahmadnagar with favour or equanimity and they joined hands with a nobleman ?al?bat Khan to oppose the Mahdawis and to ultimately expel them from the kingdom of Ahmadnagar. Their efforts, however, did not succeed, although the movement did receive a set-back. On the deposition of Ismail Niz?m Sh?h by his own father, who now ascended the throne, the Mahdawis found themselves in a tight situation. The sun of their short-lived glory being eclipsed, they lost all heart. The first act of the new monarch, in sharp -contrast to his predecessor, was "to annul the orders respecting the Mehdvy doctrines, which Jam?l Khan had so strenuously enforced, and he even gave orders to put to death all who persisted in them, which had the effect of expelling the sect out of his dominions. The Sheea religion was again restored to its pristine glory." (Firishtah, Brigg's translation, ii : 247-8). It may, however, be noted that Ism?'il Niz?m Sh?h was only a boy of 12 years of age when he ascended the throne of Ahmadnagar on the deposition of his cousin. He only ruled for two</page><page sequence="10">50 A. S. ?A?ZME? ANSARI shaky years, i.e., 1589-1591 A.C. During this brief period Ism?il Nizam Shah was completely under the control and baneful influence of his all-powerful Minister Jamal Khan, who was an inveterate MahdawL To make so much of Ism?'?l Niz?m Sh?h's devotion to Mahdism, as has been done by some Mahdawi writers (cf. Muqddimah Sir?j al-Abs?r, p. 240), is therefore nothing but a vain glorious attempt at the distortion of historical facts while stating that Mahdism received an impetus after the accession to the throne of Ism?'il Niz?m Shah. It should have been clearly stated that he was only a boy of 12 years of age and that his rule did not last for more than a couple of years. The Mahdawi claim (Muqaddimah Sir?j al-Abs?r, pp. 126-7) that Burh?n Nizam Shah II who was responsible for the expulsion of the Mahdawis from his kingdom and for sup pressing the new faith, had repented and reaffirmed the claim of the Mahdi before his death bears a striking similarity with Jah?ngir's assertion that Akbar had renewed his full faith in orthodox Islam before his death and died as a Muslim. Ism?'?l, even after his depo sition did not renounce Mahdism ; his father had, therefore, to des patch him for reasons of state. IV When the 'ulama of Gujarat found that even the MahdTs expul sion from the city of Ahmad?b?d had no salutary effect on him and that bis activities continued unabated, they demanded his banishment from the kingdom. The reigning monarch contrary to the Mahdawi claim, had to acquiesce in the demand and order his banishment. Hounded from place to place with a band of devout followers, he visited Anhilw?r? Pat?n, J?lore, N?gore, Jaysalm?r and Thatta. At the last mentioned place he appears to have received on first arrival a warm and hospitable treatment. Q?di Q?dan, the q?di of Thatta and Shaykh Muhammad, a former q?di of Uohhgfeh who had settled at Bhakkar, were widely believed to be of Mahdawi persuasion.80 Even at Thatta much opposition was arous ed against him and while the simple unsophisticated masses of Sind, well-known for their religious credulity, took him at his word, the 'ulama could no longer stand the situation. They compelled J?m Nind? (Niz?m al-Din), the ruler of Thatta, one of whose nobles anda minister (Mad?r al-Mah?mm)t Dary? Khan, was favourably inclined towards the Sayyid, to order him to leave Thatta. The Mahdawi claim that the classes and the masses, the grandees and the military commanders of Thatta contracted their bay 'ah with the Mahdi is</page><page sequence="11">SAYYID MUHAMMAD JAWNP?Rl AND HIS MOVEMENT 51 without foundation. It is, however, a fact that in later years the Mahdawi movement did flourish and gain ground in some parts of Sind. Among other notables ?dam Shsh Kalhoro, the eponym of the KalborS dynasty of Sind, was counted among the followers of Sayyid Muhammad.81 Leaving Thatta for Khurasan and crossing the difficult, desolate and vast desert of Baluchistan the Sayyid reached Qandah?r, whose ruler, Shah Beg Argh?n son of Mir Qb?'l Nan Beg, the ruler of Far?h in Khurasan, at first took him tobe a pretender. Fearing trouble by the Mahdawis, he and his companions were asked by the local authorities to deliver up their arms and weapons and face the orthodox 'ulama in the Jami4 Masjid (congregational mosque) of the town. After hearing the Sayyid, a great and accomplished orator, Shah Beg felt shaky and changed his earlier opinion. He, however, sent him on to his father at Farih, who also on hearing his sermon, was greatly impressed. Mahdawi sources record a discussion between the Sayyid and the 'ulama of Khurasan32 which centred mainly around his claim to being the Mahd?. The replies that the Sayyid is reported to have given are not in the least convincing or satisfactory. To the most crucial question his reply, that he did not call himself the Mahd? but that God had ordered him to do so, sounds hollow and thoroughly unconvincing. The nature of his mission and claim is best illustrated by his own words as recorded in the Qawl aUMa^m?d by 'Ali al-Makki. The text is said to be that of a letter which the Sayyid wrote in reply to a query from the Sharif of Mecca. It runs as follows : "O people ! Listen and understand that I am synonymous with Muhammad ibn 'Abd Allah, the Messenger of God. God has chosen and appointed me as the Kh?tim al-Wil?yat al Muhammad?yah and the Khal?fah of the Prophet over his great ummah. I am the same person whose appearance has been promised in the End of the World and I am the same person of whom the Prophet has spoken. I am the one (i.e. Paraclete) mentioned in the Books of the Prophets ; the same who has been praised by the former and later generations and one on whom has been bestowed the Divine Caliphate. I call the people, in obedience to the commands of God and of His Prophet, to the right path. While making this claim, I am not in a state of intoxication but am in full possession of my senses. I do not stand in need of being brought back to them. I receive pure food from God and I do not need (the help) of any one but His. I lay no claim to territorial acquisition or government, neither have I a desire to establish a kingdom or state of my own. I look upon the amirate, country or state</page><page sequence="12">52 A. S. BAZMEE ANSARI as an impure and unclean thing. My duty is to pull you away from the love and attractions of this world. The raison d'etre of my call is (to show you the right path) and that I have been ordained by God to do so. With redoubled emphasis I am conveying my message to you. I have been appointed over all of you and you are duty-bound to obey me. I convey my message (da'wah) to all the peoples and the genii that with me comes to an end the Wilayah-Mufyammadiyah and that I am the vicegerent of God on Earth. He, who obeys me, in fact obeys God ; he who disowns me, in fact, disowns God Himself. O people ! accept me as the one Divinely appointed so that you may attain deliverance. Listen to me and hurry up to obey me, so that you may be blessed. He who disobeys me or refuses to accept me will be caught in the tight grip of God. O people ! fear the day when the mountains will be reduced to fine dust. Do not leave this world while you are in the grip of 'destruction'. Better take to doing righteous deeds as they are requited in the Hereafter and do not exchange them for base coins. You are intelligent and sensible people. If you think that I am an impostor and attributing wrong things to God, it is your duty to investigate (the truth) and hurry up with the matter. If you do not pay heed to what I say, your repudiation of me will be of no avail. You can and are in a position to sift right from wrong and if you allow me to persist in my false claim the responsibility will be entirely yours. I swear by God, and He is sufficient for this purpose, that I will avert the fate which is to befall the people of Muhammad ; I am the one who will save you from going astray. It is up to you, not to remain in doubt. You should compare my words, deeds and my ahw?l with the teachings of the Qur'an and if you find that whatever I do and say conforms with the text of the Qur'?n, then obey me and accept me. Otherwise kill me, as that is the best deliverance for me. Fear God and turn to Him with a lowly heart as God is Merciful and Compassionate ; He is not cruel to His slaves. It is glad tidings for him who lends an ear to it and receives it with an attentive heart."33 V In spite of his piety, devotion, selflessness and other admirable qualities, the Sayyid's tall claim to be the one appointed by God to appear in the End of the World or the one about whom there are a number of prophecies in the former Scriptures has been rejected by the Community. According to the Mahdawi sources many leading 'ulama, q?d?s and a majority of the people of Farah not only accepted Sayyid Muhammad as the Mahd? but some of the prominent scholars like ?adr al-Din Khur?s?n? and H?jj? Muhammad D?h? wrote treatises in vindication of his claim. But this is flatly contradicted by another</page><page sequence="13">SAYYID MUHAMMAD JAWNP?R? AND HIS MOVEMENT 53 Mahdawi account itself which says that the q?di of the town had grave doubts about the veracity of the claim put forward by Sayyid Muhammad and ordered the kotw?l to dispossess him (the Sayyid) and his party of their belongings and put them in prison. The kotw?l deprived them by force of all their arms and weapons and other possessions. The entire party was to be arrested and put into prison the next day, but the kotw?l seem to have changed his mind and let them off.84 After a stay of twenty-nine months, Sayyid Muhammad died at Far?h (now in Afghanistan), situated at a distance of 180 miles from Qandah?r, of consumptive fever on Thursday, 19 Dhu'l Qa'dah, 910/23 April, 1505. As the people of Far?h had refused to accept him as the Mahdt they also refused to allow his dead body to be buried in the town. He was ultimately interred in a garden belonging to a Mahdawi which lay midway between Far?h and Ruchch.35 In about 981/1573 more than 70 years after the death of the Mahdt, Sh?h Q?sim 'Ir?q?, the ruler of Far?h, started the construction of his mausoleum which was completed by his successor Yag?nah Sulf?n. Later a dome called *Ali Manzar, a covered tank, a commodious kh?nq?h, a reservoir and a large mosque were added to the complex by some of the local Ithn?' 'Asharl nobles and rulers as they held the Sayyid in high esteem. His tomb became a place of general pilgrimage, especially for the remnants of the Mahdaw?s who considered it a great act of piety to pay such a visit. Sh?h Ism?'il ?afaw? and Sh?h Tahm?sp later tried to destroy it. The tomb, however, still exists and was visited as late as 1341/1922 by one Husayn Sh?h Miy?n of Hyderabad (India). The Mahdawls of India, mostly concentrated in the south, in imitation of the visit of the orthodox Muslims to the tomb of the Prophet in al-Madlnah, consider it to be an act of piety and virtue to visit the grave of their leader. It will be interesting to know something about the religious ideas of the Sayyid. He contended, when challenged by the 'ulama' of Gujar?t, who belonged to the Hanafite school of law, that he did not follow any madhhab and that his madhhab was the Book of Allah and obedience to the Prophet. This clearly establishes that the Sayyid while on the one hand considered it below his dignity to follow any of the four Sunnite Im?ms, on the other he considered himself to be a Mujtahid, independent of others and above all sectarian considerations. In spite of these</page><page sequence="14">54 A. S. A2 EE ANSARI declarations the majority of the Muslims of India, mostly Hanafites, looked upon him as a heretic and the 'ulama of Thatta went even to the length of denouncing him as a K?fir.*6 The reason for this extreme denunciation must have been the improper personal claims of the Mahdi?indeed, there was a strong insinuation in his utterances and behaviour that he was playing a vicarious r?le to the Prophet; secondly also the fact that his rather socialistic-moral interpretation of Islam was contrary to the accepted understanding of the Faith. He is reported to have said, "He who has in his house a slave or a slave-girl cannot retain the faith (?m?n)." On another occasion he said, "He who has two suits of clothes and there is a brother who is needy, he should give one suit to his indigent brother otherwise he will be rendered a Kafir." Contrary to the Qur'?nic nass% the Sayyid did not favour the idea of cursing Satan as he thought that the time wasted in heaping imprecations on Iblis, should be devoted to remembering God. Similarly he was opposed to asking help, monetary or material, from others as he considered this act to be against human dignity and individual self-respect. But, how seeking material assistance from others in the hour of need, is un-Islamic passes comprehension. Similarly he characterised the Qur'an as Ishqn?mah (**U i.e. Book of Love.37 He also forbade his followers from eagerly looking forward to gaining (entry into) Paradise and fearing the (fury and torture) of Hell. He added, i.e. "he who seeks God is a male, he who seeks the World is a female and he who seeks the Hereafter is a eunuch."88 Perhaps the Sayyid thought that there was no link betwen seeking God and the Hereafter in glaring contrast to the teachings of the Qur'?n and the Holy Prophet. If in spite of his piety, a simple and austere life, sincerity and selflessness, he was denounced by the orthodox 'ulama1 there is nothing surprising about it. Coupled with his claim to being the Mahdi, these sayings of the Sayyid were enough to rouse the most vehement opposition against him and give rise to a demand as did the 'ulama of Gujarat for awarding death penalty to him and his followers supported by the fatw? of the 'ulama of Mecca. Mulla 'All al-Q?r? says in the Mirqat :39 ?y* (^JLfrtl oL^ j AjkU aJUj .J&amp;\ ?*?J'.</page><page sequence="15">SAYYID MUHAMMAD JAWNP?R?

They decided that the execution of the Mahdawis was obligatory in places where this could be (easily) enforced." Consequently the Mahdawis in Gujarat were bitterly persecuted and in 961/1554 eleven of them, who refused to renounce their faith and denounce the Mahd?, were executed by the orders of Sul??n Mahm?d Begar? of Gujarat, whom strangely enough the Mahdawis claim to have accepted the Sayyid as the Mahd?. Not only this ; after the death of the founder in far-off Farah his immediate succes sors were involved in two armed combats at two small places in Gujarat, Kh?nbil and Sadr?san in Shawwal, 930/ August, 1524 in which many Mahdawis, including Sayyid Khwandm?r the second yhal?fah and son-in-law of the Sayyid, lost their lives. VI Coming to the teachings of the Mahd?* it can be safely said that these had very little to do with theology or the creed. At best these can be called a code of social and communal life which he prescribed for his followers. He laid great stress on hijrah and set an example himself by roaming from place to place.40 This was clearly in poor imitation of the hijrah of the early Muslims to Abyssinia and the Hijrah of the Prophet. How far a migratory life is conducive to the formation of a compact, well-organised society in Islam, on which the entire structure of Islamic polity is based, is a question that needs no answer. Sayyid Muhammad also advocated shunning the world (tark aUdunya) and remaining aloof from the people ('uzlah an al-Wialq). This again is in direct conflict with the teachings of Islam, which exhorts its followers to lead a balanced life, paying due regard to the affairs of the world as well as doing their duty to God and His Prophet. Neither worldly pursuits are allowed to suffer at the cost of spiritual and religious observances nor religion is allowed to be sacrificed at the altar of secularity. Islam does not tolerate Yogism, monasticism, asceticism or rahb?niyyah in any form or shape. The life led by the Prophet himself is the best example for his followers to adopt and follow.</page><page sequence="16">56 A. S. BAZM?? A?SAft? Expatiating on what he meant by renouncing the world, the Mahdl is reported to have said that the world constitutes wealth, children etc "He who submits to the world and is submerged in it, is a K?fir\ he is further reported to have said.42 He also forbade the learning of knowledge and earning one's living because he thought that devotion to these pursuits weans one away from God and the implementation of His commandments. The Mahdawis explain away these sayings as having esoteric meanings. They assert that it is wrong to interpret renunciation of the world as monasticism or monkery. Similarly they ask the question : 'what was the vocation of the Prophet during his stay in Mecca after his Prophetic mission ?' They, therefore, maintain that to give up work is highly commendable, if it is done with the intention of devoting one's time exclusively to the preaching of Islam.43 The Mahdt made it an article of faith with his followers that they should always entertain the desire for 'seeing' ?od. He maintained that various verses of the Qur'?n suggest that God can be seen with physical eyes.44 When he made a similar claim at Ahmadabsd, after his return from the Hajj, he was challenged by the orthodox 'ulama* who finding him obdurate, had to demand his banishment from the kingdom of Gujarat. Doubtless some other Safi orders also entertain such beliefs but they never clothe them with the rigidity of a dogma. The indulgence of the Mahdt in abstruse, esoteric and metaphysical problems, beyond the ken of ordinary human beings, does point to his having been influ enced by S?fism, especially when we find that his first teacher in life Shavkh Dlniyal Chishti was himself a famous sfif?, and a disciple and l^talifah of another celebrated s?fi, Hamid R?ji Sh?h (cf. Ghul?m Sarwar L?hori, Khaz?natal-Asfiyah and n. 25, 26). It is however, a fact that the Chishtiyyah order to which Shaykh D?niyal and his spiritual guide belonged has never advocated the doctrine of the physical vision of God. Even the anthropomorphism never made any such claim or included such a belief in their teachings. The Sayyid also exhorted his followers to keep company with the ??diq?nis i.e. persons who are true to their word and deed. The term ??diq?n has further been explained, in the light of the comments of Fakhr al-Din al-R?z?4e on the verse L^1 ??^J'W?* l? CtJ^UaJI g \?jS* j ? to mean the ijma of the ummah because the unanimous decision (Jy) of the ummah is right (J^) and in the best interests (vl&gt;*0 of the community. Here in order to suit their</page><page sequence="17">SAYYID MUHAMMAD JAWNP?R? AND HIS MOVEMENT 57 own ends a curious twist has been given to the concept Ijmai.e. the consensus of the community viz. the Ummah. While himself strongly advocating the attachment of the individual to the community as a whole the Mahd? himself never agreed with the majority who denounced him as an impostor and a pseudo-Afafedi. He raised perpetual dhikr*7 i.e. remembrance of God, to the status of an obligation with his followers. He, however, defined dhikr to mean the performance of the canonical prayers in a state of complete absorption to the exclusion of everything else except the 'presence1 of God. In fact this led to the belief among his followers that when a Muslim is wholly absorbed in the remembrance of God and imagines himself to be in His 'presence, he, so to say, sees God ; and this all happens to him while he is still physically existent. It also faintly underlines the surmise that Sayyid Muhammad combined in himself the double r?les of a sufi and a scholastic theologian (mutakallim) like some early s?fts of the Baghdad school. Both these strains are discernible in his teachings. Perhaps the study of kal?m in his early life ultimately turned him, like the celebrated al-Ghaz?l?, into a sufi. But while al-Ghazall's robust spiritual and intellectual capacities rendered him a most creative figure in Islam, the Mahd? became a captive of shafh?t? tempting but insober claims. Among other tenets on which Sayyid Muhammad laid much emphasis are : (t) 'uzlah 'an al-khalq i.e. seclusion from mankind and (n) tawakkuf?. Is not 'uzlah 'an al-khalq tantamount to al-rahb?niyyah which the Mahdawis so vehemently disclaim ? It passes comprehension how can a man remain aloof from his fellow human beings and still continue tobe a potent and active member of society. Islam does not teach and encourage seclusion from people in any form or shape, it on the other hand impresses upon its follow ers the necessity and usefulness of leading a corporate life. The at tempts of certain Madhawl writers of a much later period to explain that the Mahd? only preached dissociation with those who have made a mockery of religion and who have succumbed to the guiles of the world are as crude and unconvincing as the teachings of their leader. The word khalk (&lt;3^) does not admit of the restricted meaning sought to clothe it with ; its scope is even much wider than that of the word al-nas On a deeper analysis of the teachings of the Mahd? one is struck by the close similarity between the esoteric teachings of the Mahd? and of the various s?fic</page><page sequence="18">58 A. S. BAZMEE ANSARI orders, particularly of the Baghdad School represented by al-Junayd, Ma-rflf al-Karkhi and al-Shibli etc. Tawakkul although expressly mentioned in the Quran has never been regarded by any imam, jurist or dogmatic theologian as one of the obligatory acts (uV) which a Muslim is required to perform, and whose denial throws one out of the pale of Islam itself. We are strengthened in our surmise when we find 'Abd al-Q?dir al-Bad?'an? describing the Say y id as one of the great awliya (saints) of his days.49 This estimation of the Sayyid is neither fantastic nor hyperbolical. Bada further writes : "Whoever adopted the pious company of the Sayyid, it was found in most cases that, detaching himself from his family and renouncing the world, he joined his followers. He scrupulously abjured sins and other prohibited acts and absorbed himself in the remembrance of God. The Mir (i.e, the Mahdi) wielded such a great influence over the hearts of people that some notorious dacoits with swords besmeared with blood came to him (with foul intentions) but after listening to him explaining the Qur'an joined the band of his companions and themselves attained sainthood (wil?yah). Out of these companions many became famous walzys such as the celebrated saint of Kalpi, Sh?h Burhin al-D?n who remained in the company of Shaykh Il?hd?d, a companion of Sayyid Muhammad, for three days only and became a friend of God. This Miy?n Il?hd?d, a resident of B?ri, was in his early days a dacoit like Fudayl ibn 'Iy?d. But after contracting his bay1 ah with the Mir, he became one of the most perfect of the saints. Many others like him, have benefited from the company of the Mir."50 In spite of the tall claim, to his being the Mahd? ?khir al-Zam?n, which Sayyid Muhammad so categorically made, the fact remains that he was the first person to launch a purely Islamic religious movement in India and for that matter the first of its kind in the sub-continent, shorn of even the slightest semblance of politics, whose aim was to regain the pristine glory of Islam and present this religion to the masses in all its purity (of his conception). Opinions may differ as to the results achieved but all non-Mahdawi sources are unanimous in saying that the character and teachings of Sayyid Muhammad were above reproach. His honesty of purpose, integ rity, selflessness, contempt for worldly gains, resignation to the will of Allah and above all his own example fired the Muslims of the day with a new zeal and fervour and many forsaking the</page><page sequence="19">SayyId Muhammad JawnpDr? and h?s movement 5$ comforts of a settled life, dedicated themselves to the service of religion and fellow-travellers on the path to Deliverance. VII A significant feature of the social life led by the Mahdawis was its corporate and communal character. The founder, Sayyid Muhammad, wherever he went made it a point to always stay out side the town or the village and set up a camp for himself and his followers. This was known as the da ir ah*1 akin to the Turkish tekke or the Syrian or SanOsI z?wiyah or in some aspects the Persian ih?nqah. Here he and his followers, away from the hustle and bustle, attractions and enticements of the settled population, lived, stayed and prayed together.52 The reason for establishing these camps has not been clearly stated hy Mahdawi sources but they apparently came into existence as a result of the desire to escape persecution or harassment at the hands of a hostile population. What was, to all intents and purposes, adopted purely as a pre cautionary measure became, in course of time, a welt-established convention. The second plausible explanation of the establishment of the da'irahs is the principle of 'uzlah 'an al-khalq so vehemently preached by the Mahd?. The disadvantages of translating this principle into practice have been nowhere more clearly manifest than in the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent where their remaining aloof from the other communities led to the widening of the gulf already existing between the Muslims and the non-Muslims. Although this aloofness gradually developed into creating the sense in the Muslims of being a separate nation, resulting ultimately in the establishment of Pakistan, the same principle cannot be applied with equal force everywhere. Life in these dairahs was led on the pattern of a joint family system, almost on the same lines as understood and practised in present-day Hindu India. Describing the dairah at Bayanah of Shaykh 'Abd All?h Niy?zi Afghan, a devoted and staunch follower of Sayyid Muhammad, during the reign of Isi?m Shah S?r, Niz?m al-Din Ahmad Bakhshi says, "He who entered the majlis of the Shaykh would not attend to his business or vocation and cutting adrift from his family join the d?'irah of the Mahdawis. If he was a tiller of the soil, he would spend one-tenth of his income from</page><page sequence="20">60 A. S. ?AZMEE ANSAR! land in the way of God. As a matter of common occurrence the father would part from his son, the husband would desert his wife, and take to a life of austerity and self-abnegation. Whatever came to the dairah, by way of fut?h (offerings), was equally divided among the inmates, irrespective of age or social status. If there was nothing to eat in the dairah the poor inmates went without food for two or three consecutive days but never mentioned this fact. During these forced periods of starvation they spent their time in contemplation and meditation and purification of their souls. They kept swords and shields and all other arms always ready at hand. Whenever they came across anything which was against the SharVah either in the city or in the market-place, they first resorted to dissuasion failing which force was employed. Among the city authorities, he who was favourably inclined towards them helped them and he who did not like them, found himself helpless to harm them."53 It is fair to conclude from the foregoing that the Mahdawl movement was not a wholly peaceful movement but a semi-militant organisation which even considered the use of force permissible for the furtherance of its aims. Much has been made of the principle of 'equitable distribution' (*?&gt;**JI &lt;J*) of the offerings or what the members themselves possessed among the inmates of the camp, organised purely on party basis, and has been extolled and described as the forerunner of Socialism preached by Marx. Small organisations or groups when they come into existence with a fixed programme cannot afford to make an invidious distinc tion between member and member, as such a step would cut at the very roots of cooperation and secondly lead to internal dissensions culminating in the disintegiation of the organisation. The complex ion of the life in a Mahdawi dairah demanded that whatever came to the camp by way of offerings must be equally distributed among the inmates as these did not belong to any one individual. It was the common property of the entire community and no single individual had a right to misappropriate it. Sometimes this principle of 'equal distribution1 was carried to ludicrous extremes. Once, while the Mahdi was camping in Khur?s?n, someone made a present of grapes to him. A companion took one grape out of the bunch and put it in the mouth of the suckling of the Sayyid. At this the Sayyid was so furious that he made the poor infant disgorge the grape declaring that the grapes were communal property and could not be used before they were distributed among the members of</page><page sequence="21">SAYY?D MUHAMMAD JAWNP?RI AND HIS MOVEMENT 61 the dairah.55 It is, however, a bit puzzling that all the inmates of a da ir ah were not necessarily sincere and devout followers of the Mahdi as he himself once said that "there are in my da ir ah mu'mins, k?iirs and mun?fiqs (hypocrites)."56 A peep into the life of the Mahdawis living in a dairah is afforded by the Naqliyy?t of Bandag? Miy?n lAbd al-Rashid57 an important Mahdawi author. According to its anecdote No. 244, if any inmate of the dairah of Sayyid Mahm?d, the son and successor of the Mahdi, committed a sin either by tongue, foot, eye or ear, the leader of the community called together all the inmates of the dairah and those of the migrants (muh?jir?n) who happened to be there and called for trustworthy witnessess. When the exami nation of the accused and the witnesses was over he would ask the migrants (muh?jir?n) as to what was the punishment prescribed by the SharVah for that particular sin. The decision they gave was duly carried out.58 Nothing in the way of awarding punishment to transgressors was done without mutual consultation. This system of deciding cases is akin to the modern system of trial by jury. Perhaps we hear its echoes in the Jirga system prevailing in the tribal and special areas of Pakistan. How far this system of trial by jury is Islamic and compatible with the high-sounding claim of the Mahdi is something for the students of Islamic jurisprudence and law to judge. On the one hand, he claimed that he was out to follow th? Book of God and His Prophet, on the other he ruled it in order that even in matters about which there was a clear n?ss resort could be had to practices, which were neither adopted by the Prophet nor were in accordance with the injunctions of the SharVah. It is futile to take shelter behind the Qur'anic injunction of mutual consultation (XLII : 38) as no such consultation is permissible in 'ib?d?t (modes of worship). No precedents of adjudication of cases, involving violation of the SharVah by mutual consultation are forthcoming either during the period of the first four Caliphs or in the time of the Prophet himself. The Mahdawis living in these dairahs used to say their prayers together, and invariably after zuhr (fajr and *asr also) prayers one of them would stand up and preach, choosing as his text a verse of the Qur'?n. Sometimes it so happened that the person called upon to preach could not muster up sufficient courage to do so in the presence of the leader of the community or of the camp commandant ; the duty then reverted to the latter to the great</page><page sequence="22">62 A. S. ?AZM?E ANSAR? relief of the former59. A rather strange feature of the corporate life in these d?'irahs was that neither the Sayyid nor his followers ever went to the house of a person, outside the dairah, in response to an invitation for meals or for visiting the sick or for offering condolences. On one occasion, however, this convention was broken. While on his way back one afternoon from the congregational mosque in Khurlsln (most probably Qandah?r) the Mahdt and his companions were invited to lunch by a person whose house fell on the way to the dairah. The Mahdt declined the invitation but permitted his other companions to go and partake of the food.60 Ordinarily, as stated above, the Mahdaw?s did not accept invitations nor attend other social functions held by the non-Mahdawis but preferred to lead a life of isolation and aloofness. This indirectly proved a great hindrance in the way of the rapid spread of the movement because of the hush-hush character of the communal life in the dairah. Not only that ; this policy of isolation led to a number of fantastic stories about the Mahdaw?s becoming current in non-Mahdawi circles. Najm al-Qhani Ramp?r? quoting Mull? 'Ali al-Q?r? says that "the Mahdawis used to erect their huts side by side and each hut had an aperture in it so that the neighbours could see what was going on in one another's hut. The matters came to such a pass that if one Mahdawi lay with his wife, the other, from his own hut, looked on because they believed that all the Mahdawis were brothers to one another."61 The Mahdt considered himself, in one sense or the other, a compeer of the Prophet. Not only that ; he adopted for himself, without any rhyme or reason, the kunyah Abu'l Q?sim which was the kunyah of the Prophet and, as stated in the beginning of this study, attempts were also made to bring about similarity in the names of the parents of the Mahdt with those of the parents of the Prophet. The Mahdt was even made to carry like the Seal of the Prophet, the Seal of Wil?yah, imprinted on his back.62 According to the same anecdote which mentions showing of the 'seaV by the Mahdt to one Y?suf Jawnp?r?, a very pious and learned man, the latter asked him as to how old he was. The Miranji, as the Sayyid was popularly known, replied that he had absolutely no idea. In the light of this direct evidence right from Mahdawi sources even the date and day of his birth as generally given out and accepted, become highly doubtful. The apocryphal nature of the</page><page sequence="23">SAYYID MUHAMMAD JAWNP?RI AND HIS MOVEMENT 63 anecdote apart, is it not a clear case of religious forgery ? Drawing on the same analogy the companions of the Mahdt were described and known as the ?aiyabah and the blessing-phrase (God be pleased with them), was invariably used after their names. The successors of the Mahdi are all styled as the Khulafa of the Mahdt. In later and more recent times we find the successors of the Sudanese Mahdi also styling themselves as the Khcdtfah. (Of these, Khalifah 'Abd'llahi gained prominence in history). Even the verse which was in its situational context applicable only to certain Companions of the Prophet has been very boldly applied to the companions of the Mahdt.** Many more such instances can be quoted but the few cited are adequate to establish that the Mahdawis firmly believe that Sayyid Muhammad, if not fully equal to the Prophet, was in close proximity to the Prophet's status.65 VIII On his death in 910/1505 in far-off Farah in a strange country, the followers of Sayyid Muhammad finding that his influence was on the wane in Khurasan dispersed and many of them returned to their homelands. His son, Sayyid Mahm?d, who succeeded him as his first Khaltfah and is known in Mahdawi circles as "Mahdi , returned to R?dhanp?r (Gujarat) after a year's stay at Far?h after the death of his father. He established a number of dairahs in Gujarat, from where his father and his followers had been earlier turned out. He began to send out select persons in all directions for propagating the faith of the Mahdt. These early Mahdawi preachers were like the Isma'ili dais. They used to roam about the towns and villages, preaching their doctrines and asking the people to restrain from unlawful acts. It was during the 'caliphate' of Sayyid Mahm?d that the institution of the dairahs took root rather firmly and besides 12 such dairahs in Gujarat, there sprang up small Mahdawi settlements in Khur?s?n. Samarqand, the Indo Gangetic plain, Northern and Central India and the Deccan.66 At the instance of the 'ulama of Gujarat, who had earlier led a seering campaign against his father, Sayyid Mahm?d was captured and put into prison. Unable to bear the rigours of a hard prison life, he expired on 4 Ramadan 919/November 1513, some ten years after the death of the Mahdi. By this time the Gujarat authorities had turned completely hostile to the Mahdawis. Sayyid ?Q?wandm?r, the son-in-law of the</page><page sequence="24">64 A. S. BAZMEE ANSARI Founder, who succeeded Sayyid Mahm?d as the second Eihalzfah, had to face an extremely hard time. He was expelled from 20 different places and knew not where to go and what to do. The 'ulama of Gujarat published a fatw? permitting the public execution of the Mahdaw?s. The foreheads of those who professed Mahdism were branded with red-hot iron shaped like a crow's paw. On their refusal to renounce Mahdism two boys, sons of a dyer, were executed.67 When it was discovered that even this repression failed to deter the Mahdaw?s and that their movement was gaining momentum, a huge force consisting of a very large number of troops under the command of 'Ayn al-Mulk was sent against them. Sayyid Khwandmir, who was then camping at Kh?nb?l, 8 kos from Pat?n, fed up with leading a restless life, having been driven from pillar to post and hounded from place to place, at last decided to face the forces of Muzaffar Sh?h Gujarati (917/1511-932/1525). The clash took place at Kh?nb?l in 930/1524 and the desperate Mahdaw?s fought against the superior numbers of the royal army with indomi table courage and killed some seven hundred of them. The imperial army took to flight before this onslaught but in the m?l?e Khwandmir was wounded. Two days later the king's forces, having assembled again, took the field at Sadr?san, 12 kos from Kh?nb?l, in the parganah of Kakrej, and in spite of the redoubtable courage and contempt for death shown by the Mahdaw?s, none of them escaped the sword including the wounded commander, Sayyid Khwandmir.68 These are the only two instances of the Mahdaw?s coming into direct clash with established authority. Claiming as the Mahdaw?s do that they firmly believe in God and the Prophet and that Sayyid Muhammad adopted it as a principle to follow the Book of God and His Prophet, their action against a Muslim government established by law and authority and backed by the majority of the Muslims was nothing short of Khur?j i.e. revolt ; and if the Gujarat authori ties launched a police action against them, they were perfectly justified. After the death of Khwandmir. the movement appears to have withered and suffered a severe set-back. The third Khaltfah Sh?h Ni'mat, was originally an outlaw who had absconded after killing seven persons and had taken to a life of banditry and pillage. Later he contracted bay ah with Sayyid Muhammad and for some years succeeded in evading the law. After the death of the Founder, he returned to Gujarat and established dairahs in Patan, J?lore,</page><page sequence="25">SAYY?D MUHAMMAD JAWNP?RI AND HIS MOVEMENT 65 Ahmad?bad, Ahmadnagar and at certain places in Kh?ndesh. He was killed by a Pathan chief, obviously of Sunnite persuasion, at Manoli, a small village in the vicinity of the fort of Lohgarh near Poona, in 935/1528 along with a number of his followers. He was followed by two other Khallfahs but they do not deserve any men tion. It appears that the institution of Mahd?wi &amp;hil?fah did not survive long as after the death of the fifth caliph, Shah Dil?war, at Borkher? near Awrang?b?d in 944/1537, we no more hear of the Khaltfahs, the line having apparently come to a close. IX After remaining in a state of coma for some decades the movement again erupted during the reign of Islam Shah S?r (1545-1554 A.C.), when a very pious and holy man 'Abd Allah Niylzi Afghan, who had accepted Mahd Ism, at the hands of the afore-mentioned Sh?h Ni'mat, somewhere in Gujarat, set up a d?'irah at Bay?nah70 near the modern BharatpOr. Through his piety, utter disregard for worldly gains, devo tion to religion and spirit of public service he was able to attract a very large number of devotees who accepted Sayyid Muhammad as the Mahdi. In 955/1548 when Islam Sh?h S?r was marching against the Niyazis, who had risen in revolt against him, he halted at a small place in the neighbourhood of Bay?nah and heard of the public attention that 'Abd Allah was drawing. Sensing a possible seed of rebellion in the teachings of the Shaykh and his numerous disciples, Isl?m Sh?h ordered the commandant of Bay?nah to send 'Abd All?h Niy?zi along with his followers to him. Fearing maltreatment at the hands of the king and possibly death for the Shaykh* the commandant secretly advised him to leave the place. 'Abd Allah, fearless of the consequences, boldly decided to face the wrath of a king who was out to deal death to the Niy?zis. The Shaykh came to the camp-court of Islam Sh?h and on a prompting from the Shaykh al-Islam Makhd?m al-Mulk 'Abd Allah Ans?rr Sult?np?ri, an arch enemy of heresy and heretics as he was then known to be, the infuriated king ordered the Shaykh to be severely lashed. Immediate ly the king's men fell on the poor man, beat him so severely that he was taken to be dead. He, however, survived the ordeal and lived to a ripe old age of 94. He died thirty-eight years later in 993/1585 at Sirhind, where he had settled after renouncing Mahdfem and led the life of a holy man.71 In view of the beliefs of the Mahdawis as delineated above, how far is it reasonable to attribute</page><page sequence="26">66 ?. S. ??ZM?? ANSAR? jealousy or personal enmity to the Makhdam al-Mulk insofar as the followers of Sayyid Muhammad are concerned ? 'Abd All?h Sult?np?ri, or for that matter any other religious divine holding a high influential office in the State, would have certainly been guilty of putting a premium on heresy had he connived at the teachings of the Mahdaw?s and compromised with them. We need not go here into the case of Shaykh 'All'i, a devoted disciple of 'Abd All?h Niy?zi and the tragic end that he met, as that is too well-known to be described. 'Abd al-Qadir al-Bad?'?ni, Nizam al-D?n Ahmad Bakhshi and other historians have paid glowing tributes to both 'Abd All?h Niy?zi and Shaykh 'Ala'i for their devotion, piety and selflessness.73 On the death of Shaykh 'Al?'i in 955/3548 the movement practically collapsed as we do not hear much of it thereafter. However, during the reign of Akbar, the Mahdawis were again active in Patan and other parts of Gujarat. When Akbar visited Gujar?t in 980/1572 after its conquest by the Moghuls, a group of local 'ulama including Muhammad T?hir al-Fatani, author of the Majma' Bxh?r al-Anw?r% attended on the emperor. Akbar noted that T?hir al-Fatani came to the court bareheaded, an act considered in those days as a mark of disrespect. The emperor, out of curiosity, enquired of him the reason for his not covering his head. The Mull? told him that he had taken a solemn vow that unless his community, the Bohr?s, forsook Mahdism and reverted to the fold of orthodox Islam, he would not wear the turban. The emperor thereupon placed the turban on his head with his own hands and assured him that as the head of the Muslim community in India and the protector of the Faith he would see to it that the Mull? had no cause for complaint. The Mahdawis temporarily recoiled into their shell but raised their head again after some time, compelling T?hir al-Fatani to once more gird up his loins against them. With the intention of seeking redress at the Imperial Court he started for Agra but was treacherously assassinated by a Mahdawi fanatic on the way.74 Kh?n-i A'zam Mirz? 'Aziz Kokalt?sh during his governorship of Gujar?t took some strong measures against them and tried to stamp out the movement, but it seems to have gone underground as the Mahdawis continued to survive and we hear of them again first dur ing the reign of Sh?h Jah?n and later that of Awrangzib.75 In 1056/1646 during his viceroyalty of Gujarat, Awrangzib once came to know of the arrival of some Panni Pathans of the Mahdaw?</page><page sequence="27">SAYYID MUHAMMAD JAWNP?Rl AND HIS MOVEMENT 67 persuasion at Ahmad?b?d. Horse-dealers by profession they had earlier visited Burh?np?r, which was also a centre of Mahdism and where even up to this day some Mahdawis still exist. Awrangzib, a champion of orthodoxy, on learning of the arrival of these Mahdawi merchants, deputed Mufti 'Abd al-Qawiy and Q?d? 'Abd al-Wahh?b to question and catechize them. The poor merchants not being thoroughly grounded in the tenets of Mahdism pleaded their inability to satisfy the critical scholars. Awrangzib at their instance sent for some Mahdawi 'ulama and divines from P?lanpQr. The chief (ra?s) of P?lanpQr, Muj?hid Kh?n, immediately complied with the princely orders and in consultation with the local leading Mahdawis asked Sayyid Raja, who was reputed to be a great scholar and was also thoroughly conversant with the traditional sciences, to proceed to Ahmad?b?d and face the orthodox Sunni 'ulama. In the month of Rabi I, 1056/May, 1646 a mub?hathah (disputation) took place between the Mahdawi scholar and the Sunni 'ulama . Offended with the observations of Sayyid R?j? both Q?di 'Abd al-Wahh?b and Mull? 'Abd al-Qawiy demanded the former's expulsion from Ahmad?b?d through a fatw?. The Kotwal, who was charged with serving the order of expulsion on the Mahdawi scholar, was a very strict man and while Sayyid R?j? along with his companions was engaged in taking midday meals in a garden near the city, he was killed in a scuffle with the men of the Kotw?l. Twenty-two other Mahdawis also lost their lives in the m?lee that followed. They were all buried at the spot where they were killed. The mausoleum of Sayyid R?j? still exists in Ahmd?dab?d and is visited by the devout Mahdawis. (cf. Gul?b Miy?n, Tarikh-i P?lanp?r, Bombay 1912, i : 116-20). During his Deccan campaigns when Awrangzib set up his temporary headquarters at Ahmadnagar, in 1094/1683 he sent for some Mahdawi 'ulama living there and asked them certain questions about their faith. As the Mahdawis practised taqiyyah and said that they also believed in the Unity of God, Prophethood of Muhammad, respected all the four Caliphs and did not decry any one of them, and further neither denounced nor denied any of the four madh?hib, Awrangzib did not consider it necessary to take any measures against them or even order their banishment. The only thing they (the Mahdawi 'ulama) confessed was that they believed in the coming of the Mahd? and his passing away.76 Obviously Awrangzib did not find it a sufficient ground for taking punitive</page><page sequence="28">68 A. S. BAZMEE ANSARI action against them as the Shi'ites also believe in the re-emergence on the palingenesis of the Mahdi, the Imam al-Muntazar and the orthodox % ulama and the Sunnite Muslims have tolerated them and neither excommunicated them nor decried them as heretics or unbelievers.77 With the exception of Islam Shah Sor who (mostly for political rather than purely religious reasons) got 'Abd Allah ffh?n Niyaz? punished and his disciple Shaykh 'Al?'i of Bengal put cruelly to death, no other monarch or ruler seems to have persecut ed or suppressed the Mahdawis by force. It appears certain how ever, that some sections of the public were opposed to the Mahdawis and did not tolerate them. Feeling oppressed and persecuted the Mahdawis, like the Assassins also seem to have taken to the cult of the dagger and wielded it freely in order to silence their opponents or despatch those who refused to be coerced. As late as 1292/1875 Aba Rija' Muhammad Zarnan Kh?n Sh?hjah?np?rl, a tutor of the Niz?m Mir Mahbob 'Ali Khan of Haydar?b?d, who had the audacity of probing into the secrets of Mahd ism and publishing his observa tions in his Urda work Hadiyah Mahdawiyyah (ed. Cawnpore 1293/ 1876) paid dearly with his life.78 He was murdered in cold blood by a Mahdaw? fanatic while engaged in prayers in a mosque in the city pf Haydarlb?d. After committing the heinous crime, the murderer made good his escape and remained untraced and con sequently unpunished. These murderous activities of the Mahdawis, their belief in the quasi-prophethood of the Mahd?, deviation from the teachings of the Founder and last but not least the revivalist movement launch ed by Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi, the Mujaddid-i Alf-x Th?n?* which completely overshadowed all other movements, led to the rapid decline of the Mahdaw? movement and its ultimate eclipse. The immoderate teachings of the Mahd? could not stand up to the mature, sober and Islamically creative message of the Mujaddid, himself a great Shaykh and an equally great S?f?. Mubarak N?gori, the father of Aba'l Fadl and Faydi, the two evil geniuses of the Court of Akbar, was also widely believed to be a Mahdaw?.79 He had addressed a letter to one '?lim Bi'll?h, a Mahdaw? scholar and author of Sir?j al-Abs?r, in the course of which he says : i.e. (In the mind of) this unlucky but sympathetically inclined</page><page sequence="29">SAYYID MUHAMMAD JAWNP?Rl AND HIS MOVEMENT 69 wretch some doubts, by way of (seeking) truth and not by way of bigotry or prejudice, have arisen. Their removal is requested.80 It would not be surprising if the father had also communicated Mahdawi beliefs to his sons who cleverly thought of investing Akbar with the glory of the Mahdt. Their plans were, however, thwarted by the emergence of Shaykh Ahmad Sirhindi, whose teachings attracted wide attention not only in India but even in far off places like Samarqand, BukhSra and Transoxiana. Small pockets of the Mahdawis still exist in India, mostly in the Deccan and parts of Gujarat. A number of Mahdawi works such as Ins?f-N?mah, Shaw akid al-Wil?yat, Sir?j al-Ab$?r% Naqliyy?t, Mak?tib Miy?n Shaykh Mustafa Gujarati and many others have recently been published though some of them are only "meant for the Millat-i Mahdawiyyah"*1 In Pakistan, on migra tion from India, they have established a dairah at Shahd?dp?r in former Sind. The Dhikr?s, a sub-sect of the Mahdawis, are still found in large numbers in the former Baluchistan and Kalat regions. Unlike other sects the Mahdawis in Pakistan have sedulously kept aloof from all sorts of political or polemic activities inasmuch as their presence in Pakistan is not generally known. To all intents and purposes they appear to have confined their acti vities to the religious sphere and that too among the Mahdawis only. In Karachi the Dhikr?-Mahdawis hold religious meetings on every Thursday night. At these meetings dhikr and other rituals are performed which go on till daybreak. It is, however, difficult to say what actually takes place at these exclusive and secret meet ings as they are not open to the non-Mahdawis. The Uhikrzs themselves are also most reticent and uncommunicative on this point. NOTES 1. Qur'?n, XVI : 93. 2. Porta M?sts (1655), Sign No. xvi ; cf. Encyclopaedia of Islam, iii: 112a. 3.

This is not improbable because a sincere man like Saiyid Muhammad must have seen that he had not achieved what the Mahdi was expected to achieve within his life-time." The repentance of the Mahdi is absolutely unfounded and no reliable source mentions it. Mahdaw? sources, on the other hand, emphatically assert that the Mahdi remained steadfast in his claim to Mahdiship till the last moments of his life, (cf.
