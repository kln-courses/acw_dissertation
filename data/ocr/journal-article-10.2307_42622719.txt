Though the paintings may be related thematically - by the destruction of idols, cAli supports the Prophet Muhammad in the restoration of monotheism at the Meccan Kacba through the removal of the traces of polytheism which had accumulated there since the time of Abraham (who was also a destroyer of idols) - this is not my primary concern.2 Rather, these manuscript paintings are of particular interest because they directly engage in making images of the destruction of images (the images in both paintings are idols). Hence the two paintings appear to risk the very practice that they depict, and conjure the common idea that Islam was against representational images. This last understanding - as well as the idea of Islam as publicly "aniconic" from its beginning - is often noted by scholars, even if the same scholars have also noted the times and places where the practice of mak- ing images flourished, and thereby have chipped away at the Orientalist view of Islam as an unchanging, static monolith.3 One aspect of image making that remains elusive in the reckonings of different art historians, however, seems to be a point made in the images we see: that they are manifestly not what we see. Both paintings undermine the reality of the idols by emphasizing their materiality - the idols are clearly fashioned from stone or metal, hence the use of gold and silver pigments in the paintings - and by showing that the idols are powerless in the face of human threat: they can only sit pas- sively before their attackers. The idols do not possess the life force often ascribed to them by those who question the creative prerog- ative of their makers, the ability to fashion and create (treated as synonymous in the Quťanic usage of the verb sawara) reserved to God alone.4 That said, the two paintings locate these three-dimensionally fashioned objects amid scenes populated with human figures, some among them - Muhammad, cAli ibn Abi Talib, and Abraham - the most important actors in Islam and thus especially sensi- tive subjects of representation. The later painting, following a convention developed from at least the mid-fifteenth century, veils the faces of both Muhammad and cAli.5 Because the paintings appear to involve a 119</page><page sequence="3">contradiction, they raise the question of what legitimated them in the face of per- petual anxieties about the nature of images and their use. A simple answer would be that the specific formal language developed and applied by artists distanced the total visual field of the two-dimensional painting from the sensation of actual vision. The abstract properties of paintings, and the habit of always placing limitations on the detail even in portraiture, which would seem to require it, eliminated the risk of reading the painting as real. The act of depiction, incor- porating both painting and drawing, required an image that negated its claim to any real- ity in its representational mode.6 This essay explores the mode of depic- tion employed in painted images of prophets and men, the Prophet Muhammad being the prime example, and a range of perspectives on and explanations for the figurai portrait in the Islamic lands between 1300 and 1600, extracted from written sources.7 The recep- tion and production of selected examples is also studied from the courtly contexts of Safavid Tabriz, Timurid Herat, and Otto- man Istanbul in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Safavid Tabriz When Dust Muhammad, royal calligrapher and courtier, sat down to compose a preface and to compile an album of collected works of art for the Safavid prince Bahram Mirza in Tabriz in 1 544-1 545, he was acutely con- scious of an endemic tension in the Islamic lands regarding the legitimacy of image mak- ing and of portraiture in particular. (The two terms image and portrait tend to be sub- sumed under one Arabic noun, sur at, though the difference between the two is some- times marked in Persian language texts by the use of chihra-gusha to specify a painter of portraits.)8 His preface narrated a history of calligraphy and depiction from their begin- nings until 1 544-1 545. In the section of his preface discussing artists and illuminators of the past, Dust Muhammad notes that the "masters of depiction" ( arbab-i tasvir ) need not "hang their head[s] in shame" ( sar-i khijalat dar pish ) in the face of the "manifest of Mus- lim law" ( bi-zahir-i shať ) because the "begin- nings of this craft can be traced back" [maal-i in kar muntaha . . . mi-shud) to the prophet Daniel.9 To prove this claim, Dust Muhammad adduces the tradition of the "Chest of Witnessing" ( sanduq al-shahada ). When Adam mourned the fact that he would not see the prophets among his offspring, God sent him the Chest of Witnessing, which contained portraits of the prophets housed in "several thousand compartments" ( chand hizar khana ), as many compartments as there would be prophets in the span of human time. In the tradition related by Dust Muham- mad, the portraits were revealed to the com- panions of the Prophet Muhammad in Constantinople during an audience with the emperor Heraclius. There, each portrait was unrolled, shown to the prophet's compan- ions, and identified by Heraclius. (Though the point is unstated, Heraclius' familiarity with images, derived from his immersion in the cult imagery of the Byzantine world, vouch- safed his ability to identify the portraits of the prophets.) The meeting culminated with the revelation of a portrait that caused the companions to weep, because they attested that it depicted the Prophet Muhammad. Heraclius then explained that the portraits he possessed were copies painted by Daniel after the divinely created archetypes. Dust Muhammad concludes the anecdote by re- iterating the origin of portraiture through Daniel and states that "because of this, the painter's mind need not be scratched by the i.

In Dust Muhammad's preface, the tale is inflected with a religious polemic. The Chest of Witnessing portraits are copies after acheiropoieta, "unmade" images fashioned by God, constituted at the beginning of time and encompassing all of God's creation and its prophetic lineage. This series spanned the time between Adam, first man and first prophet, and Muhammad, "Seal of the Prophets" ( khatm al-nabiyyin ) in the Mus- lim faith. The revelation transmitted to Muhammad would "seal," or close, the earlier revelatory traditions of the Jews and the Christians, the "People of the Book" ( ahi al-kitab). In presenting and identifying the portraits stored in the chest, Heraclius participates in proving Islam's legitimacy and its abrogation of Judaism and Chris- tianity, the other monotheistic religions. Regardless of the facts that Heraclius can identify all the prophets who preceded Muhammad, and that it is the Muslims in his midst who authenticate the image of Muhammad, the box indicates Islamic des- tiny from the beginning of time by func- tioning as a proleptic artifact. Although knowledge of the portrait tradition had been lost to Islam - this "relic" had been cast outside the boundaries of the "abode of Islam" (dar al-Islam) - the legitimacy of the art form could not in itself be questioned, regardless of what doctors of Islamic law had to say on the matter. Dust Muhammad sanctions depiction most directly by invok- ing a divine prototype - a complete set of images that were clearly distinct from their referents, both fashioned, conveniently, by God - and gives depiction a prophetic author- ity through the figure of Daniel. Though versions of the Chest of Wit- nessing story from the tenth century and later - occurring in histories and the "Stories of the Prophets" ( Qisas al-anbiya ') genre - typically dwell on descriptions of each indi- vidual prophet's facial features or the color of silk employed for each image, such ele- ments are stripped from Dust Muhammad's version. But Dust Muhammad is not un- concerned with the visual aspects of these portraits. Through a literary sequence of other stories in his album preface, which plays on inference, Dust Muhammad can suggest that the pictorial idiom current in non-Islamic traditions, whether Manichaean (derived from the false prophet Mani) or, by extension, European, is wholly distinct in visual terms and hence not permissible. Non-Islamic painting traditions, embodied by such examples as Mani's Artangi Tablet (. lawh-i artangi ) in Dust Muhammad's his- tory of art, confused viewers about the ontol- ogy of the image in front of them. The optical naturalism employed by their painters was ROXBURGH 121</page><page sequence="5">a mode of visual trickery that misled view- ers into equating what they saw with the real thing. These viewers of Mani's Artangi Tablet were also constrained by their guilelessness (or mulishness, bi-ghill), impure spirit (their hearts could not reflect the 'Tight of Islam 77 [nur-i Islam]), and short-sightedness (. kutah nazarani). When Dust Muhammad juxtaposes the story of the Chest of Wit- nessing with the story of Mani's Artangi Tablet, he sets up an implicit comparison. Dust Muhammad's objective was nothing less than to deny the legitimacy of Mani's image and his claim that the painted silk he fashioned was proof of his prophethood.10 The comparison in Dust Muhammad's art historical preface between the Chest of Wit- nessing and the Artangi Tablet guarantees a legitimacy for the mode of depiction prac- ticed in Iran. The album assembled by Dust Muham- mad showed these broad visual comparisons, as well as the specific subject matter of Islamic prophetic portraiture.11 Primary examples of the latter were a series of paint- ings depicting scenes from the Prophet Muhammad's ascension, the mťraj (fig. 3), presumably extracted from an illustrated volume of the Mťraj -nama (Book of ascen- sion). In his journey of supreme initiation, the Prophet Muhammad travels with Gabriel and the beast Buraq from Jerusalem to the seven heavens and the throne of God before traveling to paradise and hell. Reiterating a structure occurring in his preface, Dust Muhammad attributes the Mťraj -nama paintings to the artist Ahmad Musa, who was active in the fourteenth century and "lifted the veil from the face of depiction" ( parda gusha 3i-yi chihra-yi tasvir shud va tasviri ki hala mutadavil ast u ikhtirac kard).12 This last passage concludes by noting that Ahmad Musa "invented" ( ikhtirac ) the pictorial idiom ( tasviri ) practiced until the sixteenth century in the time of Dust Muhammad. Ahmad Musa stood at the head of a sequence of artists, a concept of artistic genealogy that is expressed in the album proper by interrelated visual examples, such as a late- fifteenth-century drawing attributed to Shah Muzaffar (fig. 4). The sequence of works dispersed through- out the album infers a relation between Shah Muzaffar's drawing and Ahmad Musa's chronologically earlier manuscript paint- ings and is merely one of many visual inter- relations established between sets of works, whether calligraphies, paintings, or draw- ings in the album. Though viewers could reach their own conclusions about the spe- cific relation between these separate studies and their place in the visual tradition, Dust Muhammad is ultimately claiming that the Persian images are exempt from any blame. Ahmad Musa, through the unique powers of his creative agency, invented a way of depict- ing things in the world that revealed some- thing unseen (hence his act of "unveiling"): 3.

This cyclical model of history, which positions Ahmad Musa as a recurrence of Daniel, is a common struc- ture in Dust Muhammad's conception of a history of art. Dust Muhammad's specific theorization of depiction is thus far anomalous, perhaps even unique in the Islamic lands, especially his articulation of the visual differences between artistic traditions. He does not, however, dwell on the precise means of rep- resenting the Prophet Muhammad, or any other person, for that matter.15 If these por- traits represented the prophets, how did they do so? If the image was to be identified, how would the individual prophet be recognized? It is on this score that Dust Muhammad's telling of the Chest of Witnessing story departs from most earlier versions.16 In an earlier version, from Mascudťs Muruj al-dhahab (Meadows of gold), a history writ- ten before 956, the story is transported to China, where an Arab named Ibn Habbar from the Prophet Muhammad's tribe (the Quraysh) is asked by the king of China: "'Would you recognize your master [sahib), that is to say the Prophet, if you saw him?' He replied, 'How could I, since he is with God?' The king then said: 'I do not mean his [person], I am talking of his portrait [surah).'"17 A box is then brought to Ibn Habbar, from which a scroll (darj) is removed that bears images of the prophets. The nar- rative in Mascudi's history supplies much more information about the iconography and composition of the images examined by Ibn Habbar, but, more important, it clearly distinguishes between the person, now deceased, and his image.18 The Arab goes on to explain that he recognized the Prophet Muhammad and other prophets - including Noah, Moses, and Jesus - "by what was depicted of their things."19 The story relo- cates the burden of recognition to the prophets' attributes - whether Noah's ark, Moses' rod, or Jesus' donkey - and avoids the question of likeness (which Ibn Habbar evades by noting that these people are long since dead and that he had not seen them). In each telling, the core story is slightly modified or adapted. The ultimate source of the Chest of Witnessing story is probably the hadith , traditions relating actions or utter- ances of the Prophet Muhammad by those who were close to him, as well as informa- tion about his appearance, virtues, and ROXBURGH 123</page><page sequence="7">miracles mediated through the early bio- graphical compilations. Several stories from the biographical literature concern Muham- mad's predestination as it is verified through verbal or visual sources. Most stories men- tion either the corroboration of verbal descriptions of the Prophet, as related by his companions to strangers who had not met him before, or the confirmation of such descriptions by Christians and Jews who had not seen him. References to visual rep- resentations are rare. In one example, an early Muslim named Jubayr ibn Muťim is presented with an image of Muhammad by Christians in Syria and is able to confirm its resemblance.20 The aspect that makes Dust Muhammad's story unique is his unquali- fied assessment of the image as licit. Its legitimacy is ensured by notions of artistic creativity - the specially endowed artist simply reflects something unseen by others, giving a deft twist to notions of subjectivity - and artistic form - the Islamic image is dis- tinct from other art traditions that employ visual trickery.21 Timurid Herat What is striking about Ahmad Musa's paint- ings is their direct and untroubled portrayal of the Prophet Muhammad. In this respect, they are like other well-known historical examples from the period of Ilkhanid Mon- gol rule over Iran (1256-1353), especially the historian Rashid al-Din's Jamic al- tawarikh (Compendium of chronicles).22 In the section of Rashid al-Din's world his- tory relating events from the period of the Prophet Muhammad and the caliphate, numerous paintings freely show episodes from the Prophet's life. Of a later date, but comparable in its pictorial treatment of the Prophet Muhammad, is a copy of the Mťraj- nama , dated 1436 and made in Herat, Afghanistan, during the time of the Timurid ruler Shahrukh (r. 1 409-1 447), son of Timur.23 The Mťraj-nama text is a Chaghatay Turk- ish translation from Arabic sources and is accompanied by a second text, Farid al-Din 'Attar's Tazkirat al-awliya 3 (Memorial of the saints), which contains biographies of seventy-two Sufi mystics. Of the two texts copied and bound into a single book, only the Mťraj-nama contains paintings. For a text of such brevity, it is uncommonly heavily illustrated. One of four terrestrial scenes in the 1436 Mťraj-nama takes place in the mosque at Jerusalem, where Muhammad meets the prophets who preceded him (fig. 5 ). Abraham, Moses, and Jesus introduce themselves to the Prophet Muhammad, each one dressed in a brown head covering resembling the shawl ( taylasan ) once worn by judges ( qadis ). Abraham asks Muhammad to lead the others in prayer.24 Each prophet, including Muhammad, is identified by a flaming golden halo. After the prayer, Muhammad ascends to the first of seven heavens. There he meets the prophet Adam, who is depicted as phys- ically larger than any of the others, though the adjacent text has nothing to say about this difference. (Adam's large size can be explained by the fact that men and women have become smaller with the passage of time and the gradual debasement of mat- ter, a process noted in the Stories of the Prophets literature.) Throughout the entire sequence of paintings, the Prophet Muham- mad is shown consistently as a man of middle age - his beard and mustache are brown - wearing a white turban, green robe, and sandals. Moving on, the Prophet Muhammad meets the angel of prayer - a multiple-headed angel (modeled after the Buddhist deity Ava- lokitesvara) who sings litanies in praise of God with its seventy heads, each head endowed with seventy tongues - as well as the prophets Zacharias and his son John, who dwell in the second heaven (fig. 6). Much as the angels resemble one another in the depiction of the hair and wings, these two prophets, standing with their hands covered in deference to Muhammad, appear to be the same age and to share the prophetic attributes of Muhammad. The other pairs of prophets that Muhammad meets - Jacob and Joseph, and David and Solomon (third heaven), Ishmael and Isaac (fifth heaven), Aaron and Lot (fifth heaven), Noah and Idris (sixth heaven) - are differentiated only by the colors of their robes and of their beards and mustaches (brown or white) to signal broad differences in age.25 When the Prophet Muhammad later comes into the presence of God and prostrates himself before the throne of God, anthropomorphism ceases: proxim- 124 ROXBURGH</page><page sequence="8">5 .

During his journey of supreme initiation, Muhammad is not known to the angels guarding doorways, and he does not know the majority of the prophets he meets. Gabriel introduces Muhammad to the angels guard- ing the gateways to each successive heaven and also to the prophets who dwell in each one. Even Abraham, in the seventh heaven, who had introduced himself to the Prophet Muhammad in terrestrial Jerusalem, is unknown to Muhammad in heaven (flg. 7). Muhammad sees Abraham, with a white beard, standing on a large pulpit ( minbar ) of green emerald and asks Gabriel: "Who is he?" Gabriel answers: "It is your ancestor, Abraham the prophet."26 Muhammad steps forward, and the two prophets greet one another. ROXBURGH 125</page><page sequence="9">6.

And the paintings - much like Ahmad Musa's - do not help identify them: they eschew physiognomic peculiarities, resort- ing instead to typologies for angels and for prophets. If we are to recognize prophets from their portraits, the pictures tell us, we can do so only through the differences in the colors of their robes, their types of head- gear, or their mounts. 126 ROXBURGH</page><page sequence="10">y.

In the section describ- ing figures who have already entered para- dise, we learn that they are all the same: they are all the height of Adam (sixty cubits); they are all thirty years of age (the age attained by Jesus); they are all as beautiful as the prophet Joseph (who was proverbial for his good looks in Islamic tradition); and they are all identical in manner to Jacob. More- over, these perfect denizens of paradise have no unwanted body hair or beard, and their eyes are coated with antimony [surma].27 This passage explains the sameness attained by human beings in paradise, and even the typological similarities between Muham- mad, who is still among the living, and the prophets he meets.28 Muhammad's perfec- tion had been secured in his early child- hood.29 This persistent leveling of difference among the elect is further emphasized by the broad range of figurai types used to represent the sinners. Their diverse physical features - different skin tones, hair colors, body sizes, and expressive, contorted faces - are a suit- able visual adjunct to the reality they face in hell: the form of torment meted out to them matches their specific sin. Ottoman Istanbul As we return to the sixteenth century and the Safavids' contemporaries and counterreli- gionists, the Ottomans, we encounter an unprecedented number of illustrated books containing portraits of living or once-living men, whether prophets or sultans. The six- teenth century - whether one looks east or west in the Islamic lands - witnessed the production of many illustrated books con- cerned with such subjects as the stories of the prophets (biographies of Muhammad among them) and the Shťite imams, and divina- tion (for example, the Fal-nama attributed to the Shťite imam Jacfar al-Sadiq).30 Chief among these books is the Siyer-i Nebi (Life of the Prophet), commissioned by the Ottoman Sultan Murad III (r. 15 74-1 5 95) and brought to completion by his successor Mehmed III (r. 1595-1603). Arranged in six volumes, the Siyer-i Nebi contains more than eight hundred paintings that enhance the descriptive properties of the text and the many events occurring from before Muhammad's birth until his death.31 Like the illustrated Timurid Mi craj-nama of 1436, the paintings in the Ottoman Siyer-i Nebi of 1595 are characterized by an ecsta- tic aesthetic. These are highly legible com- positions, overtly didactic in their directness: texture is suppressed, and sparse surface detail and limited extraneous elements avoid distracting the eye. They are painted with a bright, luminous palette, often of pastel hues and shimmering gold. Similarities to books on the history of the same period are chiefly evidenced in the frequency of illustration. But the countenance of the Prophet Muham- mad, freely shown in the 1436 Mťraj-nama and the early-fourteenth-century world his- tory of Rashid al-Din, is now consistently ROXBURGH 127</page><page sequence="11">concealed behind a white veil, his head framed by a golden aureole. The occulta- tion of the Prophet's body - sheathed entirely in cloth - occurs even in infancy when he is tended by his wet-nurse Halima (fig. 8) and before he receives his first revelation on Mount Hira outside Mecca (fig. 9).32 The painting of Muhammad on Mount Hira gives the impression of radiating light. After he returns to Mecca from Mount Hira, his wife Khadija notices the brilliant light emanating from his face. It is this "light of Muhammad" (nur Muhammad ) that offers the primary means of identification in the text and paint- ings of the Siyer-i Nebi.33 The same technique of portraying the Prophet continues throughout the multiple volumes of the text. In a series of paintings that portray events from his life, his bat- tles, and his miracles, he is shown wearing a green robe and a white turban and veil. In every instance, his invisibility ; or an unavailable physiognomy, secures his iden- tification among gatherings of people who are invariably deprived of any individual- ity. In this respect - despite the presence of the veil - the visual language of the por- trait in the Siyer-i Nebi resembles the phys- ical anonymity characteristic of the earlier Mťraj-nama. The visual appearance of Muhammad in the Siyer-i Nebi is all the more surprising given an earlier experiment in Ottoman por- traiture, discussed below, and the fact that descriptions of the Prophet were in circula- tion, which ultimately gave rise to a calli- graphic form termed hily e (Arabic hily a) in the Ottoman world. The hily e comprised a calligraphic arrangement of the "authenti- cated" description of the Prophet Muham- mad, and other texts, as a verbal diagram on sheets of paper.34 The description of the Prophet is usually given on the authority of cAli ibn Abi Talib, who described the Prophet in this way: "He is neither exceedingly tall, nor unduly short. He was of medium height. His hair was not short, nor too curly, nor was it very straight nor long. It hung with a wave. He was not thin. His flesh was firm. His face had a roundness. His skin was of rosy whiteness. He had large black eyes with thick long lashes. His bones were large and strong. He had very broad shoulders. . . . Between his shoulders he had the Seal of Prophethood. . . . Whoever saw him for the first time was awestruck."35 Such descriptions, which expanded phys- ical attributes into moral qualities, were available in a sixteenth-century copy of a book by al-Qadi cIyad ibn Musa (d. 1149) made for the Ottoman Sultan Süleyman the Magnificent (r. 1520-1566),36 and yet they did not yield particularized visual portraits of the Prophet Muhammad. Even here the textual description is a cautious balance between carefully noted elements (the seal of prophet- hood, broad shoulders) that could conjure a 8.

In his preface to the book, titled Kiyafetü'l-insaniye fi Sema 3il ' ül-Osmaniye (The appearance of humanity in the dispo- sitions of the Ottomans; also known by the short title Sema 3ilname ), the court histori- ographer Seyyid Lokman explains his reason for compiling the text (completed before 1 5 79 )-38 Lokman writes that his purpose was to describe the physical characteristics of past sultans, and that, together with the artist Nakkash Osman, he had reviewed sources which might provide either verbal descriptions or visual depictions of the Ottoman sultans.39 The problem lay in the fact that although the visual appearances of sultans who had reigned during Nakkash Osman's life were known to the artist - Süleyman I, Selim II, Murad III - earlier Ottoman rulers, especially from Osman Gazi to Murad II, were obscure. Sultans Mehmed II, Bayezid II, and Selim I were among those who had died before Nakkash Osman's life- time and their portraits (figs. 10-12) appear on separate folios of the Sema 3. ïlname . In his preface, Lokman notes the "dis- covery" of a portrait series of the earlier sul- tans painted by European artists. Lokman and Nakkash Osman approached the grand vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha for assistance. With the imprimatur of the reigning sultan, the vizier procured the European portraits. Nakkash Osman used these to produce por- traits of the first twelve Ottoman sultans and reconciled these images against what was known from native verbal descriptions assembled by Lokman. These included ref- erences to the shapes of eyebrows, beards, moustaches, and the form of noses and eyes. For imperial costume, Lokman based his descriptions on earlier texts, principally by Hoca Sadeddin Efendi. Gülru Necipoglu sug- gests that this information may also have been acquired "firsthand" by Lokman on 10.

A portion of Sadeddin's work describes the sultans' tur- bans housed in the tombs in Bursa.40 Several illustrated copies of the Sema bí- name were made,- copies after Lokman and Nakkash Osman's version perpetuate its visual models. In each of these books, an "authorized" sequence of painted portraits accompanies the text to produce what can only be considered the tightest of correspon- dence between word and image, arranged in a parallel structure. As Necipoglu has noted, the Sema 'úname was the first example to involve both text and image in "repre- senting the personality of a sultan."41 The six portraits from the sequence shown here - Osman I, Orhan, Murad I, Bayezid I, Mehmed I, and Murad II (figs. 13-18) - reveal physiognomically distinct individuals, and yet the visual language of the sultans7 pos- tures and the architecture that frames them achieve the formal coherence - patterned on repetition - that is essential to the concept of imperial genealogy.42 In this respect, the visual language of the painted images in the Sema'ilname is comparable to that of calligraphy. Gauging the shapes of the letters of calligraphy, and the crucial spaces between successive words and lines, accustoms the eye to pattern recognition. The same process allows viewers to distinguish the facial configurations of the successive Otto- man sultans. The extraordinary circumstances of the creation of the Sema'ilname, discussed by Filiz Çagman and Gülru Necipoglu, amount to a reconstitution of verbal and visual order. The burden of establishing accurate physi- ognomy stemmed from the equation between physical appearance and character: capturing the form of individuals was essential to con- veying their moral being.43 Lokman's illus- trated Sema'ilname , in its concern with mapping human geography as the key to human nature, is predicated on observation. Or that is what Lokman claims when he writes that the "veracity" ( sihhati zahir olmagile) of the European portraits "became apparent" and that they were "drawn cor- rectly" ( rast kalem).44 They were authenti- cated by comparing available portraits of the sultans made in the Ottoman artistic ROXBURGH 131</page><page sequence="15">1 6.

The sim- ilarity between the two sets was held to confirm the accuracy of European models of the earlier sultans' portraits, for which there were no Ottoman models. What was Lokman looking for in the Euro- pean portraits? Did he simply intend to pro- vide Nakkash Osman with models? Or were the European images held to be authentic records whose authority resided in their sty- listic attributes? Here matters become com- plicated. The Ottoman portraits clearly depart from the visual language of the post- Renaissance European paintings because they avoid the European codes of optical naturalism: the use of modeling, chiaroscuro, a naturalistic palette, and perspective. The Ottoman portraits of the sultans effectively selected what was needed from their Euro- pean sources and applied the information to a preexisting local visual language that was wholly consistent with a long-standing Islamic visual tradition developed from the late fourteenth century onward in Iran.45 This adaptation is fully revealed in the images of the Sema ilname but is not described in its text. There are other artistic vectors at work in the Sema 'ilname: one can think of the later Ottoman books of genealogy, the Silsile- names, that lay out the history of the prophets and trace the Ottoman dynasty's origin to Noah; all of the historical figures depicted in portrait medallions (fig. 19);46 or an earlier and more distant visual analogue, a group portrait of nine authors - arranged in a grid that resembles a painted table of contents - who had advanced the science of snake-bite antidotes (fig. 20). This paint- ing appears in a copy of Pseudo-Galen's Kitab al-diryaq (Book of antidotes,- c. 1250).47 In both examples, serial portraits show dynas- tic and intellectual authority. With figures positioned in a sequence, the portrait becomes a relational entity. Subtle internal differences are established by juxtapositions. The same process functions critically in the Sema'ilname despite its stated documen- tary. Equally important in Lokman and Nakkash Osman's Sema'ilname project is the echo of the topos of the Chest of Wit- nessing. The authority of the Sema 3. ïlname is similarly founded on a source outside the Islamic lands.48 The notion of the portrait meant many things within the premodern Islamic lands and achieved as many different forms. What the examples in this essay share, however, is 132 ROXBURGH</page><page sequence="16">19- Adam and his descendants, page from a Silsilename (Book of genealogy), Baghdad, October 1597, opaque pigment on paper Topkapi Palace Museum, Istanbul, H.i 324, fol. 20b; photograph Topkapi Palace Museum ROXBURGH I33</page><page sequence="17">a level of circumspection. Dust Muhammad wants to confront anxiety about the image and the practice of depiction by siting their origin in a prophetic model (Daniel), derived from God, and a virtually prophetic artist (Ahmad Musa) who created a model perpet- uated throughout Iran. Dust Muhammad's wider theory of artistic process and subjec- tivity reveals the common notion that the artist's or calligrapheťs works were impres- sions of their makers: hence the use of the noun athar. The word also had the meanings of "trace/' "footprint," and "memorial" or "monument"; thus its meaning as "work of art" always carries a connotation of prece- dent. This is also the word that Lolcman uses to refer to the European portraits of the Ottoman sultans. It is a suggestive and highly metaphorical term that reiterates the notion that form, whether the human form created by God or images made by an artist, involves the impression of a presence. In every instance, overly descriptive elements that might unduly distract viewers, espe- cially in treatments of prophets, angels, or sultans, who were already perfect beings, are suppressed. The paintings accompanying the Mťraj-nama of 1436, the Siyer-i Nebi of 1595, and the Semďilname of 1579 entail an avoidance of description and a controlled visualization of difference. Whether in the context of production or of aesthetic appraisal, resemblances are translated into a language of absolute attributes, an ideal. In the instance of certain "portraits," espe- cially of prophets and sultans, the mirage of the real embodied in verbal description cycled back into an abstraction. 20.

Peter J. Chelkowski (New York, 1975), 103-168. According to Ibn al-Kalbi (d. 819?), Hubal was one of the most popular idols of the Quraysh (Muhammad's tribe) and it was located inside the Ka'ba. Hubal "was of red agate, in the form of a man with the right hand broken off." The Quraysh fashioned a replace- ment hand from gold. See Hisham Ibn al-Kalbi, The Book of Idols, Being a Translation from the Arabic of the Kitab al-Asnam, trans. Nabih Amin Faris (Princeton, 1952), 23-24. Ibn al-Kalbi notes that the stones ( ansab ) worshipped by the Arabs were called idols ( asnam ) and images ( awthan ) when they resembled living beings (Ibn al-Kalbi 1952, 28). Ibn al-Kalbi's subject matter - his simple choice of writ- ing about idols in the pre-Islamic period - made him the target of many attacks. Indeed, the author Rabghuzi writes in 13 10 in his "Stories of the Prophets" of a time when "it was lawful to make statues of good and pure men after they had died, and to look at them" (Nasir al-Din ibn Burhan al-Din al-Rabghuzi, The Stories of the Prophets: Qisas al- Anbiya-An Eastern Turkish Version , trans. H. E. Boeschoten, J. O'Kane, and M. Vandamme, 2 vols. [Leiden, 1995], 2:414). 2. Also see Ibn al-Kalbi for accounts about the per- version of Abrahamic monotheism and the Prophet Muhammad's treatment of the idols at the Kacba (Ibn al-Kalbi 1952, 4, 27). 3. The term aniconic - referring to the nonuse of images - was coined, and usefully employed, by Terry Allen in Five Essays on Islamic Art (Sebastopol, Calif., 1988), chapter 2. An assessment of the materials available for the study of painting of religious subjects is available in J. M. Rogers, "The Genesis of Saf awid Religious Painting, " Iran 8 (1970): 125-139. Rogers' notion of a "religious" painting - referencing subject matter or themes that deal with figures from Islamic history or its cosmology - is modeled after, and expands on, the work of Thomas W. Arnold, Painting in Islam: A Study of the Place of Pictorial Art in Muslim Culture (Oxford, 1928), chapter 6. 4. In the text accompanying the painting of Abraham destroying the idols of the Sabians, for example, Abraham challenges the idols to eat and speak; when they do not, he hits them (Souček 1975, 118). For a recent survey of the many materials available for the study of idols and idolatry, as well as a rich bibliogra- phy, see Finbarr Barry Flood, "Between Cult and Culture: Bamiyan, Islamic Iconoclasm, and the Museum," Art Bulletin 84, no. 4 (December 2002): 641-659; and G. R. Hawting, The Idea of Idolatry and the Emergence of Islam: From Polemic to His- tory (Cambridge, 1999). 5. Christiane J. Gruber, "Eschatology in the Visual Arts of Islam, Fourteenth to Sixteenth Centuries," in Madness , Mayhem , and Millennia: Eschatology East and West , ed. Christopher Beali (Ithaca, N.Y., 2007), suggests that the veil was introduced at first because of "metaphorical, rather than regulatory, impulses." The Prophet Muhammad's ineffability, another explanation for the use of the veil, is also suggested by many sayings such as one cited in Rabghuzi: "The people of the world were amazed: No one could look him directly in the face" (1995, 2:531). 6. Despite these efforts, viewers sometimes "dis- abled" the image by either rubbing out the face or inscribing a line across the neck. For examples, see Flood 2002. 7. Mughal painting offers the most notable exception to this visual language in the Islamic lands before 1600. Under the Mughal emperor Akbar and his suc- cessor Jahangir, court painters pursued the artistic possibilities of naturalism, presumably in response to both European artists and to painted and printed sources. A brief discussion of the Mughal material, and salient literature on the topic, is provided in Priscilla P. Souček, "The Theory and Practice of Por- traiture in the Persian Tradition," Muqarnas 17 (2000): 97-108; 101. The essay by Souček is a superb introduction to the materials and the many issues at stake in the study of portraiture.

Expanded discussion on the creative agency pos- sessed by some artists can be found in Roxburgh 2001, 183-189. 1 5 . In assembling this album, Dust Muhammad penned attributions to artists on single-page works and also identified the subjects of portraits. Several of the portraits show historical figures, including the last Timurid ruler, Sultan Husayn, and the Shaybani Uzbek ruler Shaybak Khan. 16. Many of these sources are discussed in Roxburgh 2001, chapter 6. Other sources, mainly from earlier historical periods - recorded in texts by Bayhaqi, Abu Nu'aym, Ibn al-Faqih, and Mas'udi - are summa- rized and discussed in Oleg Grabar and Mika Natif, "The Story of Portraits of the Prophet Muhammad/7 Studia Islamica 96 (2004): 19-37.

In his Qisas al-anbiya3 completed in 13 10, Rabghuzi notes that Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, and Jesus all introduced themselves to Muhammad before the prayer began (1995, 2:597-600). Rabghuzi also tells us that Moses was of "tall stature77 and " awe-inspiring/7 and that he held a staff. 25. In the text of the 1436 manuscript, the Prophet Muhammad meets, in order: Adam, John (Yahya), Zacharias (Zakariyya), Jacob (Yacqub), Joseph (Yusuf), David (Da'ud), Solomon (Sulayman), Ishmael (Isma'il), Isaac (Ishaq), Aaron (Harun), Lot, Moses (Musa), Noah (Nuh), Idris, and Abraham (Ibrahim). 26.

An alternative explanation for the style of the paintings is provided by Séguy, who notes: "How- ever, luminosity of color, purity of line, and subtlety of decoration make up for the ignorance of perspec- tive, the lack of foreshortening in the carpets and floor- tiles, as well as for the absence of chiaroscuro77 I1 977/ 35)- It must also be noted that the paintings in the manuscript were not intended to form a com- pletely coherent system. Despite what we know of the condition of men in heaven, the impulse to dif- ferentiate the prophets in the manuscript paintings extends to varying the color of their hair to denote relative age. 29. In his telling of the tale, Rabghuzi notes that the angels Gabriel and Michael, in the form of white birds, came to Muhammad when he was four years old. They removed Muhammad's heart, washed it, and then returned it to him (Rabghuzi 1995, 2:529). Elsewhere in Rabghuzťs stories, he notes that the 136 ROXBURGH</page><page sequence="20">angel Gabriel usually visited the Prophet Muham- mad on earth in the form of Diyha al-Kalbi, a con- temporary of Muhammad (1995, 2:595). The Prophet Muhammad saw Gabriel only twice in the form of an angel. His six thousand wings were studded with emeralds, pearls, and rubies (Rabghuzi 1995, 2:596). 30. Rogers (1970) discusses many of them. See also Rachel Milstein, Karin Rührdanz, and Barbara Schmitz, Stories of the Prophets: Illustrated Manu- scripts of Qisas al-Anbiya' (Costa Mesa, Calif., 1999). 3 1 . The text is Mustafa Darir Erzurumlu's Anatolian Turkish translation of 1388, which was based on earlier biographies of the Prophet Muhammad. Zeren Tanindi notes that Darir had to choose between two existing biographies, one by cAbd al-Malik b. Hisham (d. 834), the other by Abu al-Hasan b. Ahmad b. cAbd Allah b. Ahmad al-Bakri (active in the thirteenth century). He selected the latter. See Zeren Tanindi, Siyer-i Nebi: Islam Tasvir Sanatinda Hz. Muhammed'in Hayati (Istanbul, 1984), 10. Her study is a comprehensive account of the Ottoman manu- script. Also see Filiz Çagman and Zeren Tanindi, The Topkapi Saray Museum: The Albums and Illustrated Manuscripts , trans., expanded, and ed.

For a modern Turkish translation of Darir's text, see Mustafa Darir, Siyer-i Nebi: Pey gamber Efendimizin Hayati , ed. M. F. Gürtunca, 3 vols. (Istanbul, 1977). 32. The practice of veiling the Prophet Muhammad was by this time widespread and not particular to Ottoman Turkey. See, for example, the Asar-i muzaffar, a Persian verse translation by Khvaja Sayf al-Din Muzaffar Bitikchi of the Siyer-i Nebi , copied in Iran or Central Asia in 1568 (Topkapi Palace Museum, Istanbul, H.1233; one folio is now in the Pozzi collection, Musée d'art et d'histoire, Geneva, inv. 1971-107/60). 3 3 . Even when the Prophet Muhammad is identified as a future prophet by the Christian monk Bahira, he verifies the identity by locating the muhr (seal) between Muhammad's shoulders. The "seal" com- plements the physical descriptions that Bahira was aware of from the Torah and the Gospel in the story recounted by Rabghuzi (1995, 2:538). 34. Several examples of the hily e are illustrated in Nabil F. Safwat, The Art of the Pen: Calligraphy of the 14th to 20th Centuries (Oxford, 1996), 52-69. 35. Safwat 1996, 46. 36. The title of al-Qadi Tyad b. Musa's work is Kitab al-shifa bi-tacrif huquq al-mustafa (Safwat 1996, 46). 37. Cooperson describes cAli's account as a "thick description" and observes that the specific details "defamiliarize their object ... to compel attention to previously unremarked detail and so create the impression that one is experiencing the object for the first time" (2001, 11). 38.

Necipoglu discusses the impact of the sequence and its subtle visual differences and parallels, which stress continuity and establish the "unified familial group identity of the Ottoman dynasty" (Necipoglu 2000, 34, 36). 43. This is a long tradition in Islamic societies and one that produced a large number of aphorisms, mostly appearing in wisdom literature, which brought together the traditions of the Greeks, Per- sians, and Arabs. Such books were variously philo- sophical or political in their orientation and function and not exclusively directed toward the ruler. One illustrative aphorism is attributed to Plato: "A king should start with reforming himself before he sets out to reform his subjects; otherwise, he would be like one who wants to straighten a crooked shadow before straightening his stick which is casting the shadow" (cited in Dimitri Gutas, Greek Wisdom Literature in Arabic Translation: A Study of the Graeco-Arabic Gnomologia [New Haven, 1975], 52). Also see Charles-Henri de Fouchécour, Mor alia: Les notions morales dans la littérature persane du ¿elye au felice siècle (Paris, 1986). Aspects of character also found expression in speech and in writing, a belief that further enhanced the status of calligraphy and created the idea that calligraphy was a moral deposit of its maker (the notion was later extended to the arts of depiction).
