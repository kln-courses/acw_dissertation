By Marshall Sahlins. xv + 120 pp. Uni- versity of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, 1976. $3.95 (paperback). Why are People? Richard Dawkins (pro) and Marshall Sahlins (con) are the latest con- tributors to the fastest growing controversy in science: sociobiology. Their books make interesting counterpoint reading because the biologist Daw- kins and the anthropologist Sahlins present nearly opposite points of view about the extent to which social behavior, including our own, reflects a consistent history of the differential reproduction of genes. Each book is a popularized account of a recently developed point of view; compared to, for example, G. C. Williams' Adaptation and Natural Selection (1966)</page><page sequence="2">88 Book Reviews neither book is as original or complete. Both were written with a broad audience in mind and Dawkins , in particular, is well organized and easy to absorb; it is also somewhat notorious because of Dawkins' ebullient tone and because of his choice of a startlingly anthropomorphic and metaphorical style, in which various biological particles, in particular genes, are caused to take on such human attributes as "inter-marrying" and "having babies." Sahlins' was written (p. xv) "with some sense of urgency" and, perhaps as a result, it is not as tightly woven or plainly presented as Dawkins'; neither is it as heavily metaphorical. The prosaic style of both authors, their avoidance of technical language and complex mathematics, and the timeliness (46% of Dawkins' references and 47% of Sahlins' are from 1970-77), relative brevity, reasonable price, and wide- spread availability of each book makes it possible to use both to supple- ment courses or seminars. With his exuberance and his metaphors, Dawkins begins early to lull the reader into believing that he is consuming a set of well documented conclusions rather than one man s reasoned opinions. First he defines the object of his primary interest, the gene. Embellishing on G. C. Williams' definition (Williams, p. 25: "... any hereditary information for which there is favorable or unfavorable selection bias equal to several or many times its rate of endogenous change" and, p. 24: "that which segregates and recombines with appreciable frequency"), Dawkins suggests that a gene (p. 30) is ". . . any portion of chromosomal material which potentially lasts for enough generations to serve as a unit of natural selection." This sort of definition, guaranteed to make geneticists blanch (for example, Lewontin, 1977), is not only circular (causing Dawkins' conclusions to be unfalsifiable), but evades an intriguing paradox about the level at which or the unit on which natural selection most consistently acts to cause evolu- tionary change. The paradox is that although genes may be the smallest self-replicating biological particles, they can only reproduce through indi- viduals, phenotypic entities created by collections of genes cooperating to compete with each other. Dawkins considers this puzzle briefly, but in the end he is content to treat genes as if they were independent objects; thus he downplays the points that genes are never transmitted alone and that they cannot spread except by helping their bearers. He proceeds by asserting that because genes are the fundamental particles of evolutionary change, they are also the most basic units of egotism. By definition, they behave selfishly. In Dawkins' fanciful prose (p. 21) "Now they [genes] swarm in huge colonies, safe inside gigantic lumbering robots, sealed off from the outside world, communicating with it by tortuous indirect</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 89 routes, manipulating it by remote control. They are in you and me; . . . their preservation is the ultimate rationale for our existence ... we are their survival machines." Dawkins next argues that because genes are passed from generation to generation and because the ontogeny of at least some behavior is devel- opmentally canalized, all behavior is linked, however circuitously, to genes. An appreciation of the selective forces causing some genes to outreproduce others can lead to a greater understanding of why organisms behave the way they do because phenotypes are nothing more than selfish genes buffering themselves against past perturbations and unpredic- tabilities in their environment. In the applicability of these two assertions to human behavior lies the crux of the sociobiology controversy. Dawkins builds his case by considering the degree to which the selfish gene approach holds the key to the solution of various puzzles about the behavior of nonhumans. After presenting J. Maynard Smith's application of game theory to behavior, searching for evolutionarily stable strategies of aggression and courtship (Chapters 5 and 7), and discussing W. D. Hamilton's formulation of the possible relationship among kinship, coop- eration, and competition (Chapter 6), and R. L. Trivers' hypothesis link- ing parental investment to sexual selection (Chapter 9), Dawkins con- cludes that natural selection has indeed operated most consistently and efficaciously on genes. He succeeds in reducing some very recently ad- vanced, reasonably complex arguments to their essentials and synthesiz- ing them in support of his viewpoint. Dawkins also leaves many substantial issues unsetded. For example, in Chapter 3 he skips over the enigma of sex, the very existence of which seems contradictory to the selfish gene^hypothesis, by stating (p. 47) that "Seen from the selfish gene's point of view, sex is not so bizarre after all. ... if sexual, as opposed to nonsexual, reproduction benefits a gene for sexual reproduction, that is a sufficient explanation for the existence of sexual reproduction." In Chapter 8 Dawkins presents Trivers' view that there is no inherent bias in the outcome of parent-offspring conflict and he chides R. D. Alexander (1974) for suggesting (Dawkins, p. 145) that ". . . the parent will always win." Alexander did not make that proposal, and to argue complete lack of bias ignores differences in size and power, experi- ence, and control of vital resources (e.g. mother's milk) that cause parent-offspring interactions to be more asymmetric than relationships among other similarly related individuals, such as siblings. The data that Dawkins believes most impressively support the selfish gene hypothesis were presented by Trivers and H. Hare (1976) in a study of social and</page><page sequence="4">90 Book Reviews nonsocial insect sexual investment ratios (discussed by Dawkins in Chap- ter 10). Because Trivers and Hare did not take into account multiple mating by eusocial insect queens, worker oviposition, and mating rivalry among genetic relatives (local mate competition) in generating their pre- dictions, their conclusion that selfish genes control colony reproductive behavior roughly in proportion to their numbers is at least premature (Alexander and Sherman, 1977). Whether or not the gene is the unit of selection is the subject of intense debate, not an established fact. In his final chapter (11), Dawkins suggests that memes (rhymes with screams), units of imitation rather than genetic substance, are the basic particles of (human) cultural transmission (Cloak, 1975, has developed a similar hypothesis in greater detail). Dawkins proposes that (p. 206) "... memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain via . . . imitation" and he admonishes skeptics for forgetting (p. 214) that "... a cultural trait may have evolved in the way that it has, simply because it is advantageous to itself (his emphasis). If the adoption of new memes were more frequently associated with reproductive handicaps to their adopters (i.e. if "cultural" and "biological" change were always clearly differentiable and more often opposed) or if memes were more often passed in fashions not parallel to genetic transmission (i.e. not primarily from parent to offspring), the meme hypothesis would be more testable. As Dawkins has used the idea, memes spread in much the same way genes do - by helping their bearers. Because of this, Dawkins' at- tempt to distinguish between biological and cultural character transmis- sion on the basis of memes, thus to disassociate himself from what Sahlins terms "vulgar" sociobiology, is unsatisfying and unconvincing. The an- swer to Dawkins' question "Why are people?" does not appear to lie in the meme concept; because of the parallels Dawkins draws between memes and genes, one wonders if it lies in the selfish gene approach. A viewpoint more in contrast to Dawkins' than that presented by Marshall Sahlins would be difficult to imagine. Sahlins' theme is that the theory of natural selection is not applicable to organisms characterizable as having culture, such as humans. Unfortunately for a field of inquiry already marred by acrimonious debate, Sahlins does not restrict himself to underscoring the necessity for caution and sensitivity when dealing with our own species (cf. Campbell, 1975). Rather he labels most indi- viduals exploring the possible link between natural selection and human behavior as "abusers" of biology and he attacks their work as either "vul- gar" or "scientific" sociobiology, depending on whether or not they (p, 4) "... make the case that human social organization represents natural</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews 91 human dispositions." This means that many of Dawkins' heroes are Sahlins' heels - which would be amusing if the issues involved were not so important and statements made about them so open to misinterpretation. In his first two chapters Sahlins develops his critique of sociobiology. In Chapter 1 Sahlins' thesis is that culture causes natural selection to fail as a general theory of human behavior. He believes that sociobiologists have not adequately taken culture into account and dealt with its conse- quences for their hypotheses because (p. 14) "Sociobiology is compelled to take a naive behaviorist view of human social acts." With litde more justification than that presented by Dawkins, Sahlins proceeds to dichotomize evolutionary and cultural change. To distinguish the two he suggests that cultural evolution is Lamarkian in the sense that acquired characteristics are transmissable. He also emphasizes that culture is prob- ably a more important determiner of 20th century mores than differential reproduction of variant genotypes. Singling out E. O. Wilson, the 27th chapter of whose 1975 book Sociobiology helped rekindle the whole con- troversy, Sahlins argues (p. 11) that "... the sociobiological reasoning from evolutionary phylogeny to social morphology is interrupted by cul- ture . . . The same human motives appear in different cultural forms, and different motives appear in the same forms. A fixed correspondence being lacking between the character of society and the human character, there can be no biological determinism." Few students of human behavior, least of all human sociobiologists, are likely to disagree. Do these argu- ments, however, deny a relationship between natural selection and human behavior? In Chapter 2 Sahlins takes up this question. First he challenges that biology (p. xi) "... is completely unable to specify the cultural properties of human behavior or their variations from one human group to another." In support of this assertion he argues that Hamilton's formulation of kin selection has little or no general applicability to humans because genealogical kinship and human social behavior do not always parallel each other. In Sahlins' words (p. 18) "If kinship is not ordered by indi- vidual reproductive success, and if kinship is admittedly central to human social behavior, then the project of an encompassing sociobiology col- lapses." With examples from various South Sea island cultures, Sahlins casts doubt on the notion, which he accuses human sociobiologists of harboring, that simple relationships exist between natural selection and human behavior. In his last two chapters Sahlins attempts to portray human sociobiologists as modern social Darwinists and he admonishes those who analyze human behavior and societal rules in harsh, cut-and-</page><page sequence="6">92 Book Reviews dried terms of cost/benefit decisions. These chapters are less substantive than the first two and are more obscurely written, less well documented, and unnecessarily rancorous. Sahlins' examples of humans behaving in ways that are apparently inconsistent with sociobiological hypotheses present considerable food for thought. Regrettably for the force of his conclusions, Sahlins be- haves as an advocate about each, discussing few or no alternatives to the sociobiological hypothesis which he has singled out as being incorrect; such alternatives are readily available. I shall illustrate this by presenting four of Sahlins' examples and a few of the alternatives suggested by Dawkins and his approach. The point is that the complexity of human behavior requires that appropriate hypotheses be postulated and consid- ered. Because of Sahlins' narrow presentation, few of his examples of a complete absence of a relationship between natural selection and human behavior seem conclusive. In the second chapter Sahlins argues that the very existence of a family structure characterized by patrilocal residence and marriage outside the hamlet (an arrangement found among 34% of the world's societies) casts considerable doubt on the kin selection hypothesis. This is because, ac- cording to Sahlins, each generation a man "loses" his daughters to emigra- tion and therefore lives among only half his descendants, perforce cooperating with individuals sharing less than the maximum possible genetic relatedness with him. In considering this example it is legitimate to ask if daughters are really "lost" under these circumstances; i.e. unless one suggests that nearly all parents in nearly all species "lose" offspring when the latter disperse, they are not. Further, if daughter-exchange initiates or strengthens between-group alliances, fathers may continue to assist their daughters both directly and indirectly after emigration. Even if one were to consider emigrant daughters as "lost," it seems inappro- priate to ignore the nearly ubiquitous individual biological advantage associated with avoidance of consanguineous sexual relationships as a fac- tor which might help to maintain this marriage system. Thus, Dawkins (p. 107) suggests that "Incest taboos testify to the great kinship-consciousness of man, although the genetical advantage of an incest taboo is nothing to do with altruism; it is presumably concerned with the injurious effects of recessive genes which appear with inbreeding. (For some reason many anthropologists do not like this explanation.)" Sahlins next indicates that there is a lack of correspondence between genealogical relationships and kinship terminology in Polynesia. In one particularly inbred society, the village of Naroi, men seem to "choose" to be classified as cross-cousins (offspring of opposite sex siblings) more often</page><page sequence="7">Book Reviews 93 than they "choose" to be classified as brothers (or parallel cousins, off- spring of same sex sibs). According to Sahlins (p. 34) "Choice is possible when two people are connected in two different ways along nearly equal genealogical paths." This pattern of classification is, in Sahlins' view, antithetical to kin selection because (p. 35) "... whether kinship is traced through two brothers or a brother and a sister constitutes a fundamental social difference, though it makes no genetic difference." In considering this example, it could be important that the sexual asymmetry in certainty of parenthood inherent in internal fertilization (i.e. men are less certain who their genetic offspring are than are women, because children come from a woman's own body) potentially creates situations in which a man s closest genetic relatives might be his sister's offspring rather than his wife's children. In other words, it might matter whether kinship is traced through sisters or a brother and a sister, especially if philandering is common (as Sahlins, p. 48, suggests that it is in Polynesia). Widespread cuckoldry might cause genealogical reckoning through common female ancestors to more consistendy reflect degree of genetic overlap than simi- lar ciphering along male lines or through a man's marriages; thus, Alexan- der has suggested (1974 and in press) that uncertainty of paternity may be important in developing hypotheses about the significance of the "mother's brother" phenomenon - nepotism directed by uncles to sororal nieces and nephews in preference to wives' children. Returning to the Naroi example, it is interesting that men from this village in particular might be tempted to fabricate cross-cousin relationships, thereby frustrat- ing attempts to clarify genealogical connections and kinship terminology. Sexual competition in Naroi is intense (Sahlins, 1962) and cross-cousins are preferred marriage partners. It is possible, therefore, that Sahlins' data indicate attempts by men to increase the number of their potential wives by "reclassifying" parallel cousins, or even distantly related or unre- lated men and their sisters, as cross-cousins (the application of kinship terms to distandy related or unrelated individuals is known from numer- ous societies, including our own: consider the multiple uses of the term "brother" in the United States today). In the villages of Keteira and Nuku, near Naroi, sexual competition among males is less intense than in Naroi (Sahlins, 1962) and outbreeding is general. Interestingly, Sahlins (1962: 164) reports that, unlike Naroi, the number of a man's classificatory cross-cousins in both more closely approximates the number of his classificatory brothers. Two other points brought up by Sahlins deserve mention. On p. 44 he states that "For biologists, the coefficient of relationships among siblings, first cousins and second cousins passes from 1/2, to 1/8, to 1/32, respec-</page><page sequence="8">94 Book Reviews tively, as compared to the Rangiroan 1,2,3. . . . the epistomological prob- lems presented by a lack of linguistic support for calculating r, coefficients of relationship, amount to a serious defect in the theory of kin selection. " Is this assertion correct? Perhaps what really matters is that Rangiroan family members are categorized according to their relative degrees of relatedness to ego; if differential treatment accompanies this identifica- tion, as Sahlins suggests that it does, the kin selection hypothesis does not seem to be weakened, regardless of whether or not "r" is calculated. In Dawkins' words (p. 103) "Just as we may use a slide rule without ap- preciating that we are, in effect, using logarithms, so an animal may be pre-programmed in such a way that it behaves as if it had made a compli- cated calculation" (his emphasis). Later Sahlins asserts (p. 49) that "... unusually high infanticide [in Tahiti] needs special explanation" because "If the success of any one child is favored over the others, it would not be in the interest of the parent's inclusive fitness, a clear violation of the formula k&gt;l/f." One sort of "special explanation" not discussed by Sahlins would be to suppose that there is a high incidence of congenital defor- mities among Tahitian newborns; then it would be in the interest of the paren ťs inclusive fitness to rear only their healthy children. A more realistic proposition is that if prominent Tahitians kill more daughters than sons while lower ranking parents do the opposite, infanticide might be a manifestation, albeit a seemingly barbaric one, of sex ratio ad- justments by parents in their own interests. In this regard it is interesting that Sahlins remarks that high-ranking, powerful parents prefer sons in this society. Richard Dawkins has given us a ponderously metaphorical but nonetheless reasonably illuminating summary of what post-Lorenzian so- cial behaviorists are up to. As evidenced by a number of favorable reviews in the popular press, his book makes the search for the basic unit of behavior exciting to nonspecialists. Because he links animal behavior to selfish genes with plausible but as yet largely unsubstantiated arguments, however, the question of whether or not the selfish gene is the unit on which natural selection operates remains open. Marshall Sahlins asserts that natural selection and culture are competing alternative explanations for human behavior, and that the former is largely inapplicable to humans because of the importance of culture in shaping the 20th century society we inhabit and the rules by which we live. While Sahlins' examples emphasize the complexity of human social behavior and the importance of avoiding oversimplification in testing sociobiological hypotheses, his treatment has not laid the substantial issues to rest. Until Sahlins, Daw-</page><page sequence="9">Book Reviews 95 kins or someone else impartially sets forth all appropriately competing hypotheses to explain a human behavior or group of behaviors, generates predictions from each, and objectively and straightforwardly tests among them, the debate over human sociobiology will continue. A comparative perusal of this pair of timely books will not take more than a few evenings; each is as valuable for its shortcomings as for its successes. Literature Cited Alexander, R.
