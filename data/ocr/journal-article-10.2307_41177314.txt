<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mapping the Logic of Models in Science and Theology Frederick Ferré My purpose in this paper is to show that the notion of the "model," which has received considerable attention and stimulated much controversy among scientists and philosophers of science, should be recognized as of central importance to theologians and philosophers of religion. In order to reach my goal I shall have to survey and attempt to make at least roughly intelligible a domain for which there exist few charts and within which there is as yet little agreement on boundaries, trail markings, or compass directions. To do a really comprehensive job, such as is urgently needed, will not be possible within the limitations of an essay; but if the existence and fertility of the territory can be established and if a few major landmarks can be plotted with reasonable accuracy, even a large scale logical map may prove useful. I Models and Theories The term "model" has one fairly common use, found most frequently among social scientists and psychologists, that is more or less equivalent to "theory." One word becomes a virtual synonym for the other. Such a rough and ready way with language, however, will not satisfy our present needs. It not only conflates what can usefully be distinguished but also may subtly beg important questions by leading us precritically into what will later be seen as a particular view of models and their logical role. Some preliminary formal analysis of "model" is required to set off models from theories without prejudicing later material analyses. One such formal description of "model" and "theory" is offered by Ernest Nagel, who distinguishes between (1) the "abstract calculus" which provides the logical skeleton of a theory, (2) the "rules of correspondence" which connect the implicitly defined statement-forms of the theory with experience, and (3) the "model" which serves to provide an interpretation for the abstract theory.1 Dr. Frederick Ferré is Associate Professor of Philosophy at Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and author of Language, Logic and God. This paper was first presented at the "Week of Work" of the Society for Religion in Higher Education at Drew University in August, 1962. Ernest Nagel, The Structure of Science: Problems in the Logic of Scientific Explanation (New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, 1961), Ch. 5. [9]</page><page sequence="2">The Christian Scholar Equipped with these distinctions, Nagel proceeds to use "model" and "inter- pretation" interchangeably:2 the statement-forms of a theory's abstract calculus remain devoid of intelligibility until provided with a sense, and that which provides this sense for the theory is its "model." (Nagel should not be misunderstood to be speaking temporally. The theory does not necessarily stand first a naked skeleton of statement-forms, later fleshed out by a model. These are stages of analysis, not of development.) But useful as this proposal for the use of "model" and "theory" can be shown to be in many respects, Nagel's analysis has the unfortunate conse- quence of making every theory separated from a "model" (in his sense) merely a theory -form; and once again substantial questions are obscured by making a "model" (i.e. "interpretation") of some kind necessary, by definition, for every "theory" that is fully to be a theory. R. B. Braithwaite avoids this danger by maintaining that the distinction between a model and a theory is properly located in the relative epistemological priority of those higher-level formulae of the calculus that contain theoretical terms.3 A model and a theory, for Braithwaite as for Nagel, utilize the same formal calculus-skeleton; but for the model it is the initial formulae of the calculus that are epistemologically prior (i.e. intuitively clear to us) whereas for the theory it is the derived formulae of the calculus that possess this priority, the initial formulae gaining interpretation in reverse order from the order of logical dependence.4 Given Braithwaite's terminology it is logically possible that a theory may stand in full independence from any model, since it is not a logical necessity, prima facie at least, that epistemological and logical priority must parallel one another for the provision of an adequate interpretation for the statement-forms of a theory's calculus. But, on the other hand, it is also perfectly conceivable that operating with the same terminology one might discover reasons for insisting (as Braithwaite does not) that models and theories are somehow essentially linked together by logical, epistemological, or psychological bonds. Because of the initial neutrality of this formal analysis of the relation of models to theories, I shall make use of it in what follows. A model, let me repeat, is not itself a theory but fits to some extent, or is believed to fit, the same abstract calculus as does the theory; the difference between them resides in the fact that a theory draws the meaning of its initial (or "abstract" or "theoretical") formulae from the meanings of the lower level formulae that have been deduced from those logically prior but epistemologically secondary initial formulae, whereas a model presents the meaning of its high level formulae somehow directly. 2Cf. ibid., pp. 90, 95, 96, 107, etc. 3R.

[10]</page><page sequence="3">Mapping the Logic of Models in Science and Theology Views of Models Just what it is that makes for this "direct presentation" of meaning - what "models" are, not formally and abstractly but concretely and "in the flesh"- has been the subject of sharp debate and, I am afraid, of much needless misunder- standing. I shall now offer, as data which will have to be drawn together into some kind of order, a sampling of substantive views on this subject. One familiar and frequently influential view of models has taken them to be essentially mechanical contrivances designed to illuminate, by their working, the meaning of a scientific theory. Lord Kelvin, it is said, complained that he could not frankly consider himself to "understand" a physical theory unless he could build some such mechanical model to illustrate it.5 Another view considers models as primarily scale reproductions (larger or smaller) of an object or type of object being studied. The relation between the planets, their sizes, satellites, relative orbits and orbital speeds, and so on, are often shown by a scale model at a planetarium. If it is a working scale model, the theory (for instance) explaining apparent planetary retrograde motion can be made vividly intelligible; but whether or not a scale model also "works" (à la Kelvin), much of value may be learned from it.6 Others may mean by "model" only a mental picture of some kind. The late Arthur Pap, for example, comments: " It is a natural tendency of the human mind to think of physical reality as something that can be pictured, on the analogy of of the objects of common-sense experience. As a result, physical theories are intuitively satisfactory only if they gain pictorial content through models." 7 Sup- porting Pap's view that models are something essentially picturable are such men as Sir James Jeans, to whose views we shall need to return before long, and the great physicist P. A. M. Dirac who is quoted by Schrödinger as having said in conversation: "Beware of forming models or pictures at all." 8 A fourth view, cited by physicist and philosopher Henry Margenau, is that models are best understood as "auxiliary concepts" 9 which are more useful for the purposes of theory-construction than of description. This position, Margenau says, holds "that science, released from the bondage of sensory experience, no longer describes reality but makes 'models' of reality which serve only the purpose of 5For a specific case, cf.

[11]</page><page sequence="4">The Christian Scholar explanation and calculation." 10 Such a view, premised on "release" from sensory experience, would seem to involve the "wnpicturability" of models and thus to depart sharply from Pap, Dirac, and Jeans. Margenau is not alone, however, in recognizing a use of the term "model" for referring to what cannot be pictured. A fifth usage finds "model" equivalent to "analogue," and thus applicable to wholly formal and unpicturable domains of thought. The British philosopher Mary B. Hesse, for example, notes that Riemann's non-Euclidean geometry functioned as an important model for Einstein's general theory of relativity. In light of this and many other similar cases the term "model" may even mislead: "Sometimes the models used in physics are purely mathematical in character, and this is why the word analogue is generally preferable to model, because the latter may seem to imply something mechanical or at least picturable." " With this position 12 we have moved far from Kelvin or Dirac, for whom "model" (for better or for worse) should "imply something mechanical or at least picturable." A sixth conception of "model" finds the essential question not in the issue of picturability or non-picturability but in the capacity of a model to focus language drawn from one domain of discourse onto another and less familiar domain. Max Black supports this view of what he calls "theoretical models" and declares: "the heart of the method consists in talking in a certain way."13 It is this general sort of model with which we shall be largely - but not exclusively - concerned in the present essay. Let us, finally, bring to a close this sampling of views on the meaning of "model" - that elusive companion to a theory that somehow brings epistemological familiarity (for good or ill) to the abstract logical structure of pure theory - by noticing a striking use of the term by Stephen Toulmin. Toulmin, in his latest book on the philosophy of science, discusses those broadest understandings that men may have concerning the natural order. In any such view, Toulmin says, we find some elements that are taken as simply self-explanatory, basic truths that simply "stand to reason" and on which all other explanations are based. "Such models and ideals, principles of regularity and explanatory paradigms, are not always recognized for what they are; differences of opinion about them give rise to some of the profoundest scientific disputes, and changes in them to some of the most important transformations of scientific theory . . ." 14 "Model," here, has obviously come to "Ibid., p. 45.

Has this brief excursion revealed nothing but ambiguity and equivocation ? Or can we, as map-makers, hope to lay hold of some principles of projection with the help of which we may discover form and intelligibility within the logical terrain we have now surveyed ? Our next task must be to develop, if possible, such carto- graphic tools as may be applicable to this pursuit. II The differences of opinion and usage which we have noted may on inspection be seen to fall into three classes. First, there is a class of questions concerning a model's degree of concreteness - whether a model must be of a sort to be actually built or may only be pictured or, perhaps, merely be conceived. This class of questions is directed at discovering what I shall call the type of a model. Second, there is a class of questions concerning a model's degree of indusiveness - how much a model may be supposed to represent: a single entity, a general species of thing or event, or still wider domains of thought. Here the questions revolve around what I shall name the scope of a model. A model's scope, it will be noted, does not necessarily depend on its type or vice versa. Third, there is a class of questions concerning a model's degree of importance - how highly valued should models be: are they indispensable, dangerous, or may they "be taken or left alone"? This sort of query is concerned with what I shall label the status of a model. Judgments of status may, or may not, vary with different attributions of type and scope. Let us now put these distinctions to use in an attempt to sketch in an orderly way the major features of the landscape before us. Mapping Models in Terms of Type Some models, as we have seen, may be of a type that permits their being built in the laboratory or the shop. Mechanical models and scale models have already been mentioned. Some scale models are supposed to work, as certain models of steam or gasoline engines; some scale models fortunately do not, as, for instance, the huge model of a locust used in zoology lectures. Working models, likewise, may or may not be true to scale. The logically important function of the scale model is to permit spatial relationships to be read off in true proportion; the logically significant function of the working model is to illustrate a process and to permit temporal elements to be read off in true succession. In those cases where one has a scale model that also works, one is given a representation of both spatial and temporal relations. In other, commoner, cases when one has a model either built 15Sir William Thompson, quoted in Black, op. cit., p. 229. [13]</page><page sequence="6">The Christian Scholar to scale or built to function mechanically, but not both, the temporal and the spatial proportions of the model, respectively, are logically irrelevant. This notion of "relevance" and "irrelevance," as we shall see throughout the present study, is of critical importance for any logical analysis of models. Still another kind of model of the type that permits construction may be neither a working model nor a scale model. We are all familiar with the models constructed out of little balls and dowel to illustrate various sorts of molecules and their structure. These models are neither expected to "work" (as in a model steam engine) nor to be true to scale. At the same time, however, they "work" logically by offering an epistemológica! immediacy to the theoretical term "molecule" which, as a term appearing only in the higher level formulae of the calculus-skeleton of the molecular theory, would apart from a model of this or of some other kind have needed to have had its meaning derived much more in- directly. At this point we find ourselves approaching a type of model which fulfills its function of offering epistemological vividness to that which it represents merely through mental images. It is clear that any model which can be built may also be pictured. The reverse, however, is not so obviously true. Some picturable models may defy construction. Cosmologist Fred Hoyle's "steady-state universe," for example, may with a stretch of imagination be crudely pictured in the "mind's eye": a spheroid blob surrounded by absolutely nothing, in which hydrogen end- lessly pops into existence in the center at the same rate at which constantly accelerating galaxies around the edges twinkle out of existence. But such a model could not even conceivably be built in the laboratory shop ! There may, indeed, be some difference of opinion as to whether Hoyle's model can even be a mental picture. Sidestepping this controversy, which is not really important to the typology or to the thesis being presented in this paper, I am brought directly to the most inclusive type of model, within which all previously mentioned types must fall. Here we permit the term "model" to apply to anything that manifests the formal characteristics of a model and can merely be conceived. It goes without saying that all models that can be built or pictured must be con- ceivable; it is not the case that all conceivable models can be pictured or built. It is no doubt on some such ground as this that there are those 16 who warn against taking "picturability" as a defining characteristic of models. That warning is well taken. Within this most inclusive model-type we find a contrast between "sub- stantive" and "formal" models.17 The latter group will contain, for example, such models as are drawn from pure mathematics, where, as has frequently been the case in mathematical physics,18 "the mathematical formalism of one theory can 18Cf. pp. 11-12 above. 17Nagel, op. cit., p. 110. 18Cf. ibid., p. 111. [14]</page><page sequence="7">Mapping the Logic of Models in Science and Theology serve as a model for another theory with a more inclusive scope of application than the original one."19 Here, too, we may find many of Black's "theoretical models," in which a "way of speaking" is of the essence. But theoretical models will not fall exclusively or even for the most part within the class of "formal models." Many of the ways of speaking which serve as models for one domain will be drawn from other, familiar, domains of life and discourse. And all these "substantive models," in contrast to formal models, will be such because they have been drawn from domains of familiar "filled" experience rather than formal relationship. All constructable or visualizable models are, of course, of the substantive variety, and it is argued by some that all substantive models are at least visualizable.20 Is this the case ? Most substantive models will, indeed, be picturable, but an interesting issue is raised by the question whether this is true for all. Erwin Schrödinger, for example, urged (some years ago) that irrelevant details simply be eliminated from sub- stantive models of science, and he asserted that this process of selective elimination could be accomplished "without leading to the consequence, that no visualizable scheme of the physical universe whatever will prove feasible."21 But he went on immediately to acknowledge that one of the first "irrelevancies" to such important theoretical entities as electrons will be "the property of possessing this or that definite color, though common to all perceptible objects . . ." 32 Can the electron be "visualized" as colorless ? We can hardly understand the question and still answer affirmatively, but if our answer is negative we shall be forced to admit that at least some substantive models defy our imagining if not (pace Berkeley) our conceiving. This, however, is a puzzling conclusion, if a model's logical function is some- how to represent something with an epistemological vividness greater than that possessed by the theory ! To what extent are we any longer "using a model" when we merely conceive the unimaginable? Is Schrödinger supposing that the model of the electron is without color (and thus unvisualizable), or, as seems more likely in context, does he take the model qua model to be fully equipped with some color but "read" or interpreted in such a way that the color aspect of the imagined model is deliberately ignored or suppressed as logically irrelevant ? Once again we note the importance of our conventions of interpreting what is relevant, an importance that is underscored by Schrödinger who warns us that "it will be necessary to acquire a definite sense of what is irrelevant in our new models and schemes, before we can trust to their guidance with more equanimity and con- fidence."23 The understandings of "model" encountered in our initial sampling have 19Nagel, op. cit., p. 111. 20Cf. ibid., p. 110. "Schrödinger, op. cit., p. 165. 22Ibid. *3Ibid. [15]</page><page sequence="8">The Christian Scholar proved to be far from mutually exclusive, at least with respect to type. Instead of spending our energies arguing with Kelvin against Hesse or with Black against Pap, we have discovered certain logical relations of inclusion and subordination among different concepts of model. In place of sheer diversity we have found some degree, at least, of underlying order. Whenever we encounter some use of "model" we shall do well to locate it as precisely as we can within the framework of types we have begun to construct. Mapping Models in Terms of Scope A second framework which may be provided our growing logical map of models deals with the extent of a given model's field of application. At one extreme we find models with scope limited to a single entity like the city of ancient Troy, or the Friendship Seven, or the projected North Campus. In these cases the model may serve the function - when correctly interpreted with respect to its logically relevant features - of permitting measurements or manipula- tions, as well as an immediate mental grasp of the subject matter, which would be difficult or impossible to obtain from the original. It is noteworthy that models of this restricted scope usually have the highest proportion of logically relevant features. A model that represents the Queen Elizabeth, for example, will properly be interpreted as offering a great many more "relevant" details than a model representing, say, Cunard liners or twentieth century steamships in general. In this way we move from models with scope limited to simple entities to models with a scope that is representative of a general class of entities. It is worth noticing that models with general rather than particular scope may in fact also be models of a single entity. A model of the De Witt Clinton, for example, may - depending on the context of its "reading," that is, the conventions of its inter- pretation - stand for the whole class of early steam railroad trains rather than the Clinton alone. But, on the other hand, a model with general scope may deliberately be fashioned so as to be unlike any particular member of the class of entities modeled, like the composite airplane appearing on some air mail postage stamps. This practice has the logical effect of emphasizing that the model is not to be interpreted as representing uniquely any single entity of the class within its scope - and thus that a large number of particular features of the model (e.g. the exact angle of slope of the rudder, the position of the cockpit windows, the length of fuselage relative to wingspan, and the like) are logically irrelevant. It will be evident that my examples, although not drawn from science, have a bearing on the use of models in scientific inquiry. An astronomer may find a model of the moon useful as a model of particular scope, but he may in another context use the same model as representing simply "satellite" - in which case many features of the model that were logically relevant in the first use will become irrelevant in the new "reading." Even more obviously, an astrophysicist who [16]</page><page sequence="9">Mapping the Logic of Models in Science and Theology utilizes Bohr's model of the sodium atom to help in his explanation of certain absorption lines in a spectrogram will not "read" his model as having unique reference to a particular atom. He will, instead, consider a great many features of his model as logically irrelevant - including not only (as Schrödinger mentioned) the color he may imagine the electrons to have, but also (as quantum theory insists) the fact that his model's electrons in their "orbits" all may have simul- taneously determinable velocity and position. Widest of all scope, at least for scientific models, is possessed by those models mentioned by Schrödinger as visualizable schemes "of the physical universe" or dis- tinguished earlier by Toulmin as explanatory paradigms for the whole natural order. Models of this breadth of scope are no longer interpreted as representatives of limited classes of entities or events but as "conceptual archetypes" 24 and 25 for the synthetic organization and the synoptic "seeing" of all that is within the purview of the natural sciences. Once again, however, very simple and particular (as well as esoteric or abstract) phenomena may be chosen to function as models of this most comprehensive sort. Aristotle's model for a "self-explanatory" dynamic prin- ciple, drawn from particular common-sense experiences of objects "naturally" at rest when not being pushed or pulled,26 undergirded much of his thought and. significantly, even spread its influence as far in time, space, and subject matter as to the first two of St. Thomas Aquinas' Five Ways of proving the existence of God ! 27 Mapping Models in Terms of Status Any model, such as Aristotle's, that can function in dynamical explanation and in theological speculation is bound to stir philosophical controversy. Con- troversy, however, surrounds the entire territory we have been engaged in charting. There are those who insist that models are dangerous, others who consider them helpful but inessential, and still others who defend their employment as both rational and crucially important. A final set of conceptual guidelines will be provided for our logical map by an examination of the arguments stated by various sides of this dispute and by our own evaluation of the merits of the cases presented. The physicist Dirac, we remember, warned Schrödinger against "forming models or pictures at all." And Sir James Jeans advances a case against models which would support that warning. It is perfectly possible, if a model is formally defined as an epistemologically familiar interpretation of a theory's abstract system of logical relations, for more than one such model to be found that would per- 24Stephen C.

II, Art. 3. [17]</page><page sequence="10">The Christian Scholar fectly "fit" a single theory. But then, Jeans says, it would be impossible to choose between these models since, ex hypothesi, each is unable to be faulted "in the only property by which it could be tested, namely the power of predicting phenom- ena." 28 The models, however, may be mutually incompatible, though each fits the formal structure of the theory being interpreted. "Neither model could, then, claim to represent reality," Jeans concludes, "whence it follows that we must never associate any model with reality, since even if it accounted for all the phenomena, a second model might appear at any moment with exactly the same qualifications to represent reality." 29 Why, if models are thus deceptive, have many physicists sought them and worked with them ? Jeans explains that pictorial representations come more naturally to human minds than abstract mathematical formulae because "our mental faculties have come to us ... from fishes and apes."30 The pressures of survival would have naturally selected for mental traits "more suited to deal with concrete facts than with abstract concepts, with particulars rather than with universals; minds which are more at home in thinking of material objects, rest and motion, pushes, pulls and impacts, then in trying to digest symbols and for- mulae." 31 Our simian heritage must be overcome, however, for the sake of progress. Physicists may make use of many cognitive techniques: "but the final harvest will always be a sheaf of mathematical formulae."32 To suppose otherwise is to be deceived by the Neanderthal in modern man. "Beware of forming models or pictures at all !" Taken together with this case against models and this description of human mentality, it is especially revealing to note Jeans' repeated warnings that "knowl- edge of reality" or "understanding" of the "loom of things" is impossible for human beings. Apart from the concrete pictures and ideas drawn from sense, he seems to be saying, cognitive satisfaction is not to be had. The "sheaves of mathe- matical formulae" will be of use in describing our past observations and in predicting future observations, but they are of little use in understanding. "We see," Jeans says, "that we can never understand the true nature of reality."33 Try as we may "to replace unintelligible universals by intelligible particulars,"34 we shall always fail. Intelligibility tantalizes but always escapes us. Models would serve to provide understanding and intelligibility if only they could be trusted, but - alas ! - this is forever beyond our reach. But is it ? Jeans' case against models, though a powerful warning against an 28Sir James Jeans, Physics and Philosophy (New York: The Macmillan Co., 1943), p. 10. "Ibid.

[18]</page><page sequence="11">Mapping the Logic of Models in Science and Theology uncritical abuse of models, is nevertheless an overstatement in need of modifica- tion. The first assumption - that the only way of choosing between models is in terms of their predictive power - is open to serious question.35 Even if this assumption were established, however, it would not follow that just because more than one model could be formulated for a theory, neither model could "claim to represent reality." One of these models might still be supposed to "represent reality" to the exclusion of its rivals, just as an honest man at a Liar's Convention might continue to tell the truth though every one of his assertions is countered by a host of incompatible ones. Jeans himself later modifies his stand when he comes to recapitulate his argument. Instead of denying models the logical right even to claim to represent reality because of the possible plurality of predictively indis- tinguishable models, Jeans merely notes that in this situation: ". . . we should have at least one perfect model which did not correspond to reality. Thus we could never be sure that any model corresponded to reality." 36 From the outright denial that a model can represent reality to a warning against undue confidence in the representative power of models is a significant step. It is in this connection interesting to note that Jeans' earlier conclusion, "whence it follows that we must never associate any model with reality . . .," is not repeated in his later statement of the argument, whence it would not any longer follow. Instead, a more moderate conclusion is drawn: "In brief, we can never have certain knowledge as to the nature of reality." 3r With this more temperate view, Jeans very nearly approximates the position of those who, like R. B. Braithwaite, argue that models may have their uses but that they had better be used cautiously and with the steady awareness that a model, like alcohol, is a potentially dangerous luxury. Braithwaite acknowledges that "to think in terms of [a] model is ... frequently the most convenient way of think- ing about the structure of [a] theory . . ,"38 But this convenience consists primarily in permitting us to think about a theory without at the same time having to expend the effort of thinking explicitly about the symbolic structure in which the theory is expressed. Since the theory's formal structure is "given" immediately and easily along with the concrete structure of any model that "fits" it, "the use of models allows of a philosophically unsophisticated approach to an understanding of the structure of a scientific deductive system." S9 The perils of unsophistication, however, lurk close at hand. Braithwaite is quick to distinguish two such perils which may be serious enough under some conditions to militate against the use of models at all. They are, first, that "the 35Stephen Toulmin argues to good effect on this question in Toulmin, op. cit., passim. 36Jeans, op. cit., p. 175, italics supplied. *7Jhid 38Braithwaite, op. cit., p. 92. "Ibid., pp. 92-93. [19]</page><page sequence="12">The Christian Scholar theory will be identified with a model for it . . .,"40 and, second, that someone will be misled into "transferring the logical necessity of some of the features of the chosen model on to the theory, and thus of supposing, wrongly, that the theory, or parts of the theory, have a logical necessity which is in fact fictitious."41 Both dangers, if I may express them in terms that I have introduced earlier, reduce to forgetting that the model is a model and thus to taking certain of the model's "logically irrelevant" features (empirical or logical) as "logically relevant." "Think- ing of scientific theories by means of models is always as-if thinking," as Braith- waite says. But as long as this is kept in mind, even Jeans is ready to accept some limited use of "pictorial representation." "Although we can never devise a pictorial representation which shall be both true to nature and intelligible to our minds, we may still be able to make partial aspects of the truth comprehensible through pictorial representations or parables. As the whole truth does not admit of intelligible representation, every such pictorial representation or parable must fail somewhere." 42 The main trouble with nineteenth century physics, it turns out, is not (as we might earlier have gathered from Jeans) that models were used at all but that the mistake was made "of treating the half-truths of pictorial representa- tions and parables as literal truths." 43 Even half-truths, however, are better than no-truths - if we can decide which "half" is which ! Granting, as Braithwaite says, that "the price of the employment of models is eternal vigilance," 44 what in general shall we look for to help us exploit the value of models without falling prey to their irrelevancies ? There is little use in ordering us to keep our eyes peeled without at the same time describ- ing the colors of friend and foe. Here Jeans, in a far mellower mood than before, becomes explicit. Models can be compared with maps, he says; and just as two- dimensional projections can never tell the whole truth about a three-dimensional object, so models are limited to telling partial truths. But maps can be faithful to aspects of reality (even though distorting other aspects) and we can, if we are careful, use a map only for the purposes suited to it, avoiding the misleading consequences which would follow from taking its logically irrelevant features as logically relevant. The model of "light as a wave" and the model of "light as a particle" each contains partial aspects of truth, Jeans says. "Neither of these can of course tell the whole truth. In the same way, an atlas may contain two maps of North America drawn on different projections: neither of them will represent the whole truth, but each will represent some aspect of it. An equal area projection, for instance, represents the relative areas of any two regions accurately, but their shapes 40 Braithwaite, op. cit., p. 93. "Ibid., p. 94. 42 Jeans, op. cit., pp. 15-16.

So long as we can only draw our maps on flat pieces of paper, such imper- fections are inevitable; they are the price we pay for limiting our maps to the kind that can be bound up in an atlas. The pictures we draw of nature show similar limitations; these are the price we pay for limiting our pictures of nature to the kinds that can be understood by our minds." 45 The important thing, then, is to be aware of which features of a model are functioning, in context, as relevant and which are not; we need to keep in mind, that is, what kind of map we are using. It may be that many features will be relevant; it may be that they will be few. In any case we are warned that no sweeping a priori assumption that reality must resemble our models will be permitted. Resemblances of many kinds there may be between model and the reality modeled, but "the only resemblance required is that of formal structure." 46 If a model can be depended upon for no more than formal or structural resemblances, and if a theory, unaccompanied by model, can provide this structural resemblance without raising the danger of subtly introducing irrelevancies and falsehoods into our conceptions of things, might we not be better off without models, despite their limited usefulness as intellectual conveniences ? If there were no further logical considerations, this "take them or leave them alone" attitude toward models might be the most rational one to adopt. But there are further points of considerable importance to take into account before drawing any final conclusions about the proper status of models. A model may be regarded not only as a labor-saving device, with Braithwaite, but also as a heuristic tool of no mean value. One must not overlook the usefulness of models at every stage of the theoretical enterprise. First, models may be of in- calculable help in the original process of suggesting and formulating theories. As Ernest Nagel points out, offering copious historical backing for his claim, "a number of outstanding scientists have been quite explicit about the important role models play in the construction of new theories." 47 But this is only the start of the model's heuristic usefulness. Once a theory has been formulated and its main assumptions clarified with the aid of a model, it still remains for these assumptions to be explored, and the model may in this connection suggest new questions to be asked about the theory and hint at new domains for the theory's application. Nagel offers a good example of this process: "In the historical development of the kinetic theory of gases ... the model for the theory suggested questions about the ratios of molecular diameters to the distances between the molecules, about various kinds of forces between the molecules, about the elastic properties of molecules, about the distribution of the velocities of the molecules, and so on. Such questions would 45 Jeans, op. cit., p. 176. 46Braithwaite, op. cit., p. 91. 47Nagel, op. cit., p. 108. [21]</page><page sequence="14">The Christian Scholar perhaps never have been raised had the theory been formulated as an uninterpreted set of postulates. But in any case, these questions led to the deduction of a variety of consequences for the theory, some of which served as hints for reformulating experimental gas laws and for recognizing new ones."48 More even than thus suggesting ways of extending the power of the theories "embedded in them," models may also be useful in offering ideas for relating theoretical concepts to empirical ones. Another example or two will help to illustrate this function: "Again, the interpretation of optical theory in terms of waves propagated in a medium invites the association of theoretical expressions referring to the amplitude of waves in the model with the intensity of the illumination; the wave interpreta- tion also suggests the linking of theoretical expressions referring to the interference of waves with the dark lines (or absence of illumination) observed in certain expe- rimentally generated patterns of light and shadow." 49 But these heuristic functions, important as they are, do not exhaust the logical usefulness of models. There is no longer, I hope, the danger that the employment of models will be contemptuously considered merely "a prop for feeble minds . . . or a convenient short cut to the consideration of deductive systems . . .," 50 but it still may not be fully recognized that models sometimes, as Max Black says, are "not epiphenomena of research, but play a distinctive and irreplaceable part in scientific investigation. . . ." 51 In what way can this claim be defended ? First, beyond its purely heuristic functions, a model may "contribute to inclusive systems of explanation"52 not merely in terms of the limited domain of a single theory but in terms of its power to relate that theory plausibly to our whole conceptual account of reality. In this way a well chosen model may link widely divergent domains of understanding in a freshly intelligible way, sub- stituting coherence and unity for fragmented and partial explanatory systems. An- other way of putting this would be to say that a good model, as a "speculative instrument," 53 has the function of helping us "to notice what otherwise would be overlooked, to shift the relative emphasis attached to details - in short to see new connections." 54 Second, can this function be shown really to be an "irreplaceable" part of scientific investigation ? Our answer to this will depend on our view of the essential purposes of science itself. If, with Jeans, we conclude that "we can never under- stand what events are, but must limit ourselves to describing the pattern of events in mathematical terms . . .," 55 and that "the study of physics has driven us to the 48Nagel, op. cit., p. 113. *9Ibid.,pp. 113-114. 50Black, op. cit., pp. 235-236.

But if, as I believe, the aim of science is not merely prediction but also understanding, then it will turn out that "science progresses, not by recognizing the truth of new observations alone, but by making sense of them."57 For this, models are needed to supplement theories serving as bare techniques for predicting. Even Jeans recognizes the presence of this wish for "making sense" of observations - while denying any possibility of its fulfillment - when he notes: ". . . we not only wish to predict phenomena, but also to under- stand them. Thus it is not surprising that philosophy and science alike have found this [predictionist] mathematical description unsatisfying . . ,"58 Grant science the function of making sense of phenomena, illuminating data, searching for under- standing of reality, and models achieve a cognitive status of their own which defies replacement by the abstract calculi of theoretical constructs. Only at the price of shrinking science from what it is - a humane and imaginative attempt at rigorous understanding of wide domains of being - into a cramped technique for anticipating impacts on the senses, can one suppose that models are "disreputable understudies for mathematical formula." 59 We are well warned, by those who consider the status of the model to be primarily a dangerous incitement to metaphorical thinking, against approaching the use of a model literally, expecting the wrong things from it; we are also well warned, by those who look at models as primarily convenient luxuries, against adopting models uncritically being lured off into pseudo questions by logical irrelevancies. But we are now prepared to proceed, vigilantly but aware that models can add great power to our cognitive pursuits, with the knowledge that, risky or not, models put a tool in our hand for understanding what, without models, may remain opaque. And for the sake of understanding as best we can - within all our human limitations - we should perhaps be willing to take even serious risks. Ill I shall assume for the purposes of this essay that theology, like science, is interested in understanding - as far as may be humanly possible - the reality in which men find themselves. This is not, of course, an uncontroversial assumption; there are those who deny that theology is even concerned with cognitive questions, quite part from her success or lack of it in answering them. Against this point of 56 Jeans, op. cit., p. 15. 57Toulmin, op. cit., p. 81. 58 Jeans, op. cit., p. 174. 59Black, op. cit., p. 236. [23]</page><page sequence="16">The Christian Scholar view, whether resting on philosophical or theological grounds, I have elsewhere 60 argued at some length, but I shall not repeat those arguments here. Instead, let me simply note that a faith unconcerned with cognitive issues is emasculated. It is well for theologians to remind their critics (and their churches) that faith is not reducible without vastly important residue to cognitive assent given various propositional elements; but this salutary warning against the reduction of faith to "mere belief* must not be confused with an elimination of belief from faith. Without the reten- tion of some element of belief, the theologian is required to abandon any pretense to interest in truth or falsity; he is forced to give up any chance of giving point or justification to his attitudes, emotions, utterances, or behavior; and he is con- demned, as a purveyor of one more item of personal taste, to isolation from the determinative issues of life - toward which, ironically, his faith prompts him to speak with "the wisdom of serpents" - an isolation no less complete for its being self-imposed. Assuming, then, that theology is not indifferent to truth about reality, it becomes relevant to ask whether there are models in theology as well as in science and, if so, how they should be related to other models on our logical map. Finding the Models of Theology If we continue to understand by "model" that which provides epistemological vividness or immediacy to a theory by offering as an interpretation of the abstract or unfamiliar theory-structure something that both fits the logical form of the theory and is well known, we shall find models in abundance within theology. In a very straightforward sense, every parable (as Jeans hinted in quite a different connection) is a model: " 'Listen ! A sower went out to sow. And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it. Other seed fell on rocky ground . . .' And he said to them, 'Do you not understand the parable ? How then will you understand all the parables ? The sower sows the word. And these are the ones along the path, where the word is sown; when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word which is sown in them. And these in like manner are the ones sown upon rocky ground . . .' " 61 Here is an epistemological vividness offered by imagery drawn from common experience, but imagery which is deemed appropriate because it shares a common logical structure with a theory that can be duly stated, independent of the model, to a few initiated disciples. "Here is how you may think about it, if you like . . .; but here is how it really is . . .," is a frequently repeated pattern, and not only in Western religions. The open and 60Cf. my Language, Logic and God (New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1961), Chap. 12; also K. Bendali and F.

[24]</page><page sequence="17">Mapping the Logic of Models in Science and Theology abundant use of models, analogues, similitudes, seems to be an entrenched part of the religious mentality. But clearly labeled uses, as in parables, are not exhaustive of the uses of models within theology. Within Christian thought, for example, there has been a long established practice of searching the scriptures for covert models of theo- logically significant figures or events. The many "types of Christ," for example, allegedly found by fundamentalist and pre-critical - or, interestingly, by some of the very newest and most sophisticated 62 - biblical scholarship are noteworthy here. Jonah's "three days and three nights in the belly of the fish," to choose but one crude example, has been taken as a model of Jesus' three days in the tomb. And in this sort of searching for significant models we may be discovering the quest for a unity and coherence in the biblical account as a whole which can bring together into a simple focus what might otherwise seem a sheer, vast multiplicity. Looking at one thing, and without in any way failing to see it in itself, many other things are seen as well. Finding or forming models in this sense of underlying patterns of structure within his religious tradition may help the believer see new connec- tions within his data. And such "seeing" through models, by giving his theo- logical beliefs increased internal coherence, may strengthen the believer's sense of the intelligibility of his faith. That this sense of intelligibility is illusory, however, apart from additional external relations of coherence between the cognitive context of faith and all estab- lished knowledge was one of the most important emphases of the liberal theo- logical movement of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; and it remains the one permanently valid contribution of all "rational theologies," despite their many notorious defects. It is with respect to this domain of theological interest - interest in cognitive ties with all knowledge and in beliefs about reality that can be simply true or false, rather than "true within a certain 'language game' " - that we discover another sort of employment of theological models, most conveniently called the metaphysical use of models or, for short, "metaphysical models." When the Judeo-Christian scriptures set about representing the nature of ultimate reality, this enterprise is not approached through abstract theory but through epistemo- logically vivid stories and anthropomorphically immediate images. Ideas drawn from one area of experience are put to work in another area - an area in which, we are explicitly warned, these ideas have no proper place. The keystone of the biblical ontological scheme, the concept of God, is beyond human conception: "His ways are not our ways, nor His thoughts our thoughts." But in spite of such reminders, the theoretical term "God" is constantly interpreted in terms of epistemologically vivid personal models. The very warnings against supposing our concepts of God 62Cf. Ronald W. Hepburn's critiques of this form of theological interest in models in "Demythologizing and the Problem of Validity," New Essays in Philosophical Theology (New York: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1955), and "Poetry and Religious Belief" in Metaphysical Beliefs (London: SCM Press, 1957). [25]</page><page sequence="18">The Christian Scholar to be literally representative are themselves couched in the language of the model: the personal His, the anthropomorphic attribution of thoughts to God. Even when, in the second of the Ten Commandments, the people of Israel are warned against making themselves graven images of God ("He Who Is," beyond images), or of forming "any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth," 63 the same commandment relies on forming verbal images of God and offering the epistemological "likeness" of human passions as a justification for this prohibition: ". . . for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments."64 Models, and warnings that what we have to think with are models; epistemological vividness, coupled with vehement affirmations of human ignorance before ultimate reality as it is in and for itself - this is the ambivalent approach of biblical religion.65 The dominant attitude of biblical faith is not nescience, however, but a sense of understanding. The models are trusted even when recognized as images and like- nesses of a reality that stands beyond human powers of imagining or comparing. And for Christians, of course, the models of the Old Testament - however helpful or even essential - all take second place to what they believe to be the one supremely reliable model for God, Jesus of Nazareth. In looking at one thing, a human life of a certain quality and with certain specifiable empirical charac- teristics, they are given a concrete interpretation of the abstract concept, "God," that is totally without the epistemological immediacy of the model. One of the tasks of the church, we may note, has been the difficult one of distinguishing be- tween what are properly to be taken as "logically relevant" and "logically ir- relevant" features of this supreme personal image of ultimate reality. Their prob- blem has been how rigorously to interpret the key epistemological statement of the New Testament: "He who has seen me has seen the Father; how can you say, 'show me the Father' ?" 66 Every christological formulation that takes that state- ment seriously is, whether consciously or not, a study in epistemology and an exercise in model-reading. Christian faith does not abandon the Old Testament, however, and because of this it has avoided the temptation to reduce the meaning of "God" to any single one of its models, including its supreme model. Instead, the great numbers of epistemologically immediate images, stories, and anthropomorphic conceptions of scripture are blended together into a panoramic mosaic picture of reality including God, man, and nature. This is a picture shot through, as we have seen, 63Exodus: 20:4. *Hbid. "Analogous things could be said, I believe, about other major religious traditions of the world, but defense of such a thesis must remain beyond the scope of this paper. 66John 14:9 (Revised Standard Version).

But if this composite picture, what we may call the biblical model of reality or the biblical metaphysical model, is properly taken as a model, it may be that the very falsity of its empirical pseudo claims falls into that "half" of all such "half-truths" which should be read as logically irrelevant. Perhaps, we may find, theological metaphysical models do not function as rivals to the models of empirical science. Mapping the Models of Theology How shall we locate the models, particularly the metaphysical models, of theology in terms of the triple conceptual framework we constructed earlier ? It will help to sharpen our understanding of them to plot their position in terms of type, scope, and status. First, as to type, it is clear that the models of theology are not of a sort that must be constructed. We have already noted an explicit Old Testament prohibition against such attempted constructions, and although this commandment is not felt by Christians to stand in the way of religious art, the fact remains that the Jews have shown that biblical models can function perfectly well without overt portrayal of this kind. At the same time, however, the very existence of artistic representa- tions of biblical imagery in sculpture, painting, stained glass, and the like, proves that we are not dealing with that type of model - at least in all aspects - which logically defies pictorial representation. The vigorously anthropomorphic Father God in Michelangelo's great "Creation," for example, should not properly be an object of embarrassment to the theological purist; on the contrary, the rugged vitality of Michelangelo's bearded patriarch is magnificently in keeping with a biblical logic which glories in anthropomorphism. The purist who squirms at anthropomorphism in his religious conceptions might well listen to Feuerbach's crusty truth: "He who dreads an existence that may give offence, who shrinks from the grossness of a positive predicate, may as well renounce existence altogether. A God who is injured by determinate qualities has not the courage and strength to exist."67 It might, however, be misleading to leave the impression that all "deter- minate" qualities are visualizable ones. "Picturing" language is sometimes rather loosely used. Sometimes it is said that one can "picture how Harry must have felt." But if more is meant by this than that one can visualize facial expressions, 67Ludwig Feuerbach, The Essence of Christianity (translated by George Eliot) (New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1957), p. 15. [27]</page><page sequence="20">The Christian Scholar gestures, and the like, associated with certain feelings, the metaphor of the "mind's eye" is being stretched rather far. Theological models, likewise, may be considered of the essentially "picturable" type only by an extended metaphor. The emotions of jealously or love cannot be pictured, strictly speaking, but they can be imagined. And in this sense we shall classify the bulk of biblical metaphysical models as substantive-conceptual in type.68 Within this type, as we saw earlier, there may be models open to imagination but not to visualization, models open to visualization but not to construction, and models open to construction as well as to conception and visualization. All the important models of biblical religion are to be found here, from the clearly labeled parables of Jesus to the overarching composite biblical model of reality as a whole, despite the presence in the Bible of some models which may be considered "formal" (note the importance of the numbers "seven" or "three") but which are definitely subordinated within the substantive mosaic biblical model taken as a unity. Next, turning from type to scope, we see at once that although there may be models of different degrees of appropriate extension within theology, the key metaphysical model of reality possesses the widest possible degree of application and relevance. There is nothing in principle, beyond the scope of the biblical model of nature, man, and God. The function of this model, indeed, would seem to be that of laying down guidelines for what may be counted as being real ! Therefore anything counted by Christians as real will - must, a priori - fall within the scope of this model. A consequence of this unlimited scope of the biblical metaphysical model69 is the notorious unfalsifiability of theological concepts.70 It would take us too far afield from models to the workings of theological theory itself to explore this issue in detail, but it may quickly be seen that a model which is taken to include, in principle, all real or possible events, cannot be disproved by any real or possible event that comes to pass. It has already, in germ, accounted for anything that might occur, and accounted for it within an interpretative framework that cannot possibly be tested independently of the framework, since any test - and any out- come of that test - that is real or possible is already accounted for within the framework ! The adequacy of the "fit" of theological models with respect to what- 68It should not be assumed that such a classification necessarily holds good for all metaphysical models. Aristotle's hylomorphic metaphysical system, for example, may utilize the formal-conceptual model of the grammatical relationship between subject and predicate. The application of my remarks to the whole field of metaphysical construction cannot, however, be made in this place. 69In contrast to their multiplicity of types, all metaphysical models, theological or otherwise, share this characteristic of unlimited scope. I would, indeed, wish to argue that such scope is the key defining characteristic of metaphysical models, providing both the necessary and the sufficient condition of their metaDhvsicalitv. 70Cf. Antony Flew's "Theology and Falsification" and subsequent discussion in New Essays in Philosophical Theology, op. cit., or my treatment of this question in Language, Logic and God, Chap. 3. [28]</page><page sequence="21">Mapping the Logic of Models in Science and Theology ever structure reality as a whole may have, then, is not able to be tested through straightforward empirical criteria; and it is seriously questioned by many whether any tests at all are possible. Max Black, for example, warns that the widest models may become "permanently insulated from empirical disproof," and that the consequence of this development is the model's becoming "a self -certifying myth." 71 But it is not necessarily the case that "open to empirical disproof" or "self- certifying myth" are, as Black here assumes, the only viable alternatives. To explore this question further here is impossible, since any methods of testing models - including metaphysical models - are inseparable from the theories with which the models are associated, and this additional question must remain beyond the reach of the present study.72 Touching even briefly on this falsification controversy, however, brings us inevitably to the question of the status of theological models. What importance or value do they have ? Such a question always demands the counter-question: "Value for what!" To begin most narrowly, the biblical metaphysical model provides theology with the possibility of offering intelligible interpretations for its lesser parables and models. We have noted earlier that a parable is of the form: "Here is how you may think about it, if you like . . .; but here is how it really is . . ." What is it, though, that the interpreter of the parable must put in place of his parabolic imagery ? He is forced back upon more imagery, perhaps of wider scope and different emotional impact than before, but imagery none the less. Jesus' parables of "The Kingdom" substitute homely likenesses for more august ones, but likenesses of one sort or another are not avoided: certain characteristics drawn from a mustard tree or a pearl of great price are used to bring into vivid focus certain others drawn from the human experience of living in great societies under the reign of kings. Of course this divine "King" will be "ruler" of all creation who will be "just," "merciful," "slow to anger," "aware of and concerned about his lowliest subject," and so on - he will be far superior to any king actually experienced and his King- dom will be far more wonderful than any earthly kingdom ever known - but the dependence on some form of the personal root model will remain vital to the inter- pretation of any lesser model or figure of speech. In terms of the intra-theological interpretation of theological parable, then, we discover that the metaphysical theological model has an essential status. This point must be generalized, however; for not only are the models of theology essential for interpretation of theological discourse within the language using community but - at least equally important - these models are necessary for the expression of religious beliefs to the world at large. Apart from concepts 71Black, op. cit., p. 242. 72But cf. Language, Logic and God, op. cit., and Exploring the Logic of Faith, op. cit., especially Section 10 of the latter, for a suggested method of testing a metaphysical model- cum-theory. [29]</page><page sequence="22">The Christian Scholar intelligible to human minds, theology remains empty of meaning to friend and foe - as well as to the theologian himself ! And it is in the models of theological theory, not in abstract theory itself, that all intelligible theological ideas are rooted. Let us briefly, without plunging deeply into the nature of theological theory as distinct from models, consider why this must be. First, it might be supposed that theology could rest content with giving its theoretical terms ("God," "Christ," "the world," and the like) merely implicit definitions, that is, definitions reflecting the logical relations of these terms within the abstract calculus of the theory. To this we may reply that implicit definitions of this kind can always be provided within an uninterpreted formal system, but such definitions remain purely formal. On the basis of implicit definitions it is pos- sible to construct well-formed formulae of the system in question (e.g. "God was m Christ reconciling the world to Himself"), but this turns out to be no more than the manipulation of empty tokens. The apparent intelligibility of such formulae is due to the model by which we habitually interpret these terms. Shorn of its model-evoking terms, the resulting formula (e.g. "A was in B relating C asym- metrically to A") would more accurately reflect the emptiness of a theology attempting to depend on nothing but implicit or syntactical definitions. But, second, the theoretical terms of a scientific theory may be given a meaning indirectly and without a model by the expedient of our working back from the theory's lower level experimental formulae to the higher level theoretical formulae of which the former are logical consequences. May this not be done in theology ? No, it may not; and the reason for the theologian's inability to define his higher level formulae indirectly in terms of the particular observation- statements they entail and exclude is the fact, briefly noted above, that theological systems cannot be falsified by any observation-statement. If they cannot be thus falsified, they cannot be supposed to entail any particular observation-statements; for if they did so entail any particular observation-statements, the empirical dis- covery of such statements to be false would be tantamount, by modus tollens, to a falsification of the theological system. It may be argued that the theologian's difficulty is due to the fact that his system entails every possible observation-state- ment. But this, if so, would have the same net logical result, with respect to the present question, as if his system entailed no observation-statement, since no particular empirical meaning can be derived for the system in either case, and that which means nothing in particular is no better off than that which means nothing at all ! Theological models provide the particularity of concept that would otherwise be missing from theology. Even the theologian's technical vocabulary is not so independent of his model as he might think. Is "God's transcendence" under discussion ? An analyst need not look far before he finds the thinly disguised spatial metaphor that underlies this term. Everywhere the model peeps through, and it is more difficult than many realize to be rid of it and still to say the same thing that was intended before. [30]</page><page sequence="23">Mapping the Logic of Models in Science and Theology "Transcendent ? That means above the universe. Above ? Well, not really above, but beyond. Beyond ? No, not in space- but simply not exclusively in the universe. ln...T Is this merely a difficulty, or is it a logical necessity that without his model the theologian simply cannot say what he wants to say without a change of mean- ing ? That is, is it a logical necessity that the theologian must depend on the model ? I have been trying to show that models are necessary in terms of the cognitive enterprise of the theologian, and I think the case is sound. But whether or not I have been correct in my argument so far, the injection of non-cognitive dimensions of meaning into the question should tip this balance quite independently of the previous logical considerations. For it is without doubt the imagery of the models in theology which evoke the communal adoration, obeisance, awe, devo- tion, ecstacy, courage - the emotive and conative dimensions of faith that constitute it religious faith rather than philosophical speculation or metaphysical system- building. I am not claiming that imagery alone can support such non-cognitive elements - courage without belief that courage is appropriate in the situation is something less than courage ! - but it is precisely because the models of faith are taken as trustworthy, that is, believed to be in some sense true, that their non- cognitive functions are possible. Toward a theory without the vividness and im- mediacy provided by the biblical model, however, such responses could never be expected; and without the language of the model, having the power to bring together and to intertwine domains of personal value and of ontological plenitude in emotional as well as cognitive relation, distinctively religious dimensions of meaning could not be expressed by the believer. The status of metaphysical models in theology, then, is essential, since it turns out that the presence of these models is a necessary condition73 of theological meaning and belief. But to what extent, we may still ask, is theology itself essential ? Models may be of the greatest importance to theology, but of what importance is theology to us ? There can be no simple answer to this question, and a full answer would be too much to undertake here. I shall make only two brief and unsupported points. First, theology is at least no worse off, in epistemological principle, than rival meta- physical systems. Every metaphysic relies, no less than the theological metaphysic, on its own model; and in its long history the personal model of biblical faith has proved itself not only highly evocative, non-cognitively, but also an interpretative 73But not a sufficient condition, since a model must be provided with relations to other domains of interest and knowledge and must be explicitly affirmed before it can be considered to be functioning fully theologically. It is perfectly possible, for example, that an important biblical model - or even the key biblical model of reality itself - may be contemplated aesthetically or otherwise entertained in thought without being given a full theological employment. The missing element, in these cases, is the "theory" or "conceptual synthesis," concerning which space forbids me to deal in this monograph. [31]</page><page sequence="24">The Christian Scholar tool with claims to real cognitive power. Second, it must be acknowledged that metaphysical beliefs are indeed useless in connection with the scientific enterprise of solving empirical problems or with predicting and controlling the world. Thus, if human life can be lived to its full entirely with reference to the anticipation and the manipulation of one's environment, then metaphysics - and with it theology on its cognitive dimension - is without importance and the status of metaphysical models may be reckoned low. //, on the other hand, man is more than a tool-user and a problem-solver, // his yen for understanding first principles and his thirst for searching out the most nearly intelligible and the most nearly reliable notion of the ultimate nature of things is inexpungeable - // these characteristics are constitutive of man (and these are not questions invulnerable in principle to empirical testing, though the tests would be extremely difficult and time-consuming), then theology, as one candidate for metaphysical truth, is potentially of the greatest possible importance. And if there are those who find full contentment in tool-using and problem solving, for whom the vast speculations and unsettleable disputes of meta- physicians are only a waste of precious time, they are asked to be tolerant toward those others to whom these questions seem the very stuff of life. Grasshoppers, as well as ants, must live as best they can. IV We have now reached the point in this study where I can bring the models of science and theology into a single focus. In order to make this possible I have attempted to impose some definite form on the protean concept of "model" in general, with particular emphasis on the fields of science, wherein the notion is most often encountered; and I have attempted to chart the location and logical character of models for the field of theology, wherein they are seldom explicitly acknowledged at all. Now, taking readings from the conceptual map with which we have provided ourselves, let us attempt to determine the distances, relative posi- tions, and topographical relations of these models, which, in both fields, we have discovered to be useful instruments for understanding, Reading off Common Features of the Models in Science and Theology There are certain features shared by scientific and theological models by virtue of their being models that no longer need detailed reviewing here: e.g. that any model models something else to better or worse effect, that any model is offered within a context and for a purpose, that these purposes even for the same model may not always be the same in different contexts, that different purposes lead to different characteristics of models being taken as "logically relevant" or "irrelevant," that models have heuristic value in formulating theories, that any use of models in- volves certain risks, and so on. More interesting now are certain particular conse- [32]</page><page sequence="25">Mapping the Logic of Models in Science and Theology quences of these general constitutive characteristics of models as they make them- selves analogously felt in the two fields. James Clerk Maxwell, working scientist, made some perceptive comments on scientific models (he calls them "physical hypotheses") which, with certain signif- icant exceptions, could almost be echoed in somewhat modified language by a working theologian. I shall reproduce his words, quoted by Max Black, as a basis for discussion. "The first process therefore in the effectual study of the science must be one of simplification and reduction of the results of previous investigation to a form in which the mind can grasp them. The results of this simplification may take the form of a purely mathematical formula or of a physical hypothesis. In the first case we entirely lose sight of the phenomena to be explained; and though we may trace out the consequences of given laws, we can never obtain more extended views of the connections of the subject. If, on the other hand, we adopt a physical hypothesis, we see the phenomena only through a medium, and are liable to that blindness to facts and rashness in assumption which a partial explanation encour- ages. We must therefore discover some method of investigation which allows the mind at every step to lay hold of a clear physical conception, without being com- mitted to any theory founded on the physical science from which that conception is borrowed, so that it is neither drawn aside from the subject in pursuit of analytical subtleties, nor carried beyond the truth by a favorite hypothesis." 74 First, then, a model simplifies the data at hand "to a form in which the mind can grasp them." And if this is important within a branch of science, how much more pressing still must be the importance of this possibility for a theology which hopes to bring meaning and order to the "scheme of things entire" - including not only all the data and all the conclusions of all the sciences but also all the realms of value, obligation and aspiration felt by men ! The theologian, like the scientist, is justly grateful for his model. But both, second, need to be wary since models permit this simplification by requiring their users to "see the phenomena only through a medium." A model may be useful - may even be indispensable for many purposes - but it is not the same thing as what it models. A model filters the facts. And the temptation to forget this because of the values of the model can become great, great enough to deprive the user of the model of appropriate humility before his own intellectual powers and before the realities mediated by his model. Both scientists and theologians frequently stress the virtues of humility and the serious consequences to those who become "wise in their own conceits." And it is interesting to note that the greatest among scientists and theologians have been more prone to take these warnings seriously in their own work than have their lesser followers or men in the street. The creative scientist is usually well aware of how far his models fall short of exhausting his subject matter, and the sensitive theologian is sharply conscious 74James Clerk Maxwell, quoted in Black, op. cit., p. 226.

This means, third, that the reliance upon models in either of these fields demands that we learn how to employ an epistemologically immediate conception "without being committed to any theory founded on the [domain] from which that conception is borrowed." The physicist must not permit himself to become committed to the point by point relevance of the theory of wave-dynamics, when he is studying the behavior of light, even though the theory is fully established in its own domain. He must remember that the conception of the wave is still a borrowed conception and that however fruitful it may be in its new application it remains a model. Conversely the theologian needs to resist supposing that because elements in the models he uses have a domain in which they would properly be taken as empirical propositions (e.g. "the bush was burning, yet it was not con- sumed") he needs, ipso facto, to be committed to the primitive theories and physical conceptions reflected in that domain. A well confirmed theory in one domain may prove a very good - or a very poor - model in another domain; and, likewise a poorly confirmed or even a positively discontinued theory may find new life as a model in another domain. The logic of a conception used as a model must be distinguished from its logic - its usefulness, degree of confirmation, truth-value, and so on - when it is used in its own proper domain. Both theologians and scientists will gain maximum value from their models, then, when with the benefits of simplification from seeing their subject matter through the medium of a model, they combine a conscious freedom from commitment to any theory grounded in the model's original domain. Lurking behind our use of models, whether as scientists or as theologians, there may be some question as to the degree of actual correspondence between our model and what it models. This is no less true for theologians than for scientists. Jeans, we have seen, discourages the scientist from expecting such corre- spondence; Braithwaite, agreeing, asserts that "thinking of scientific theories by means of models is always as-if thinking . . .," 75 and Toulmin adds, "to think that A is B is one thing, to think of A as B is another. . . ." 76 The relation, as we have seen, between model and subject is not identity. Still, as Black points out: "we pin our hopes upon the existence of a common structure in both fields." 77 May the "structure" hoped for in common be more than logical structure alone ? May scientists and theologians hope for some kind of imaginatively accurate representa- tion of this subject matter through their models ? In some cases the answer is plainly negative, when there are convincing grounds in principle that prevent even conceiving such a model without contradiction. A familiar case of this sort in "Braithwaite, op. cit., p. 93. 76Stephen Toulmin, The Philosophy of Science (New York: Harper &amp; Bros., 1960), D. 165. 77Black, op. cit., p. 238. [34]</page><page sequence="27">Mapping the Logic of Models in Science and Theology science has to do with the theoretical impossibility of producing an imaginative model that can be supposed to correspond to the electron.78 And a similar theo- logical case would be with respect to the theoretical impossibility of "visualizing accurately" an ex hypothesi invisible God. In other cases, where there are no reasons to judge one way or the other, it would be foolhardy to make an assertion either way. Certainly one's sense of the explanatory power of a model is enhanced by one's supposition that it may be "quite a lot like" that which it models, but where there are no grounds there can be no cognitively relevant judgment. In still other cases, however, it may be possible to test a scientific model against its original. Nothing stands in the way in principle of observing directly the molecules of gases that are now modeled as little elastic pellets like billiard balls. Perhaps more powerful electron microscopes will one day permit a point for point comparison of billiard balls and simple molecules. Then the scientist will know just how accurate or how inaccurate his models have been. And he will need his billiard ball model far less than before. At this point, however, we take leave of the features shared by scientific and theological models and begin to notice points of divergence between them. These similarities have perhaps been instructive; the divergences may be no less so. Reading off Divergent Features of the Models in Science and Theology Previously, in examining the status of theological models, we noted the dependence of theology on its models - particularly on the key composite biblical model of ultimate reality - for the very statement of distinctively theological dimensions of meaning and belief. The model, we say, is a necessary condition of theological theory. This dependence, not shared by scientific theories, leads to a consequence which was not pursued earlier. Cognitive assent cannot be given to theological theories alone, stripped of their models, as can be done (in principle at least) for scientific theories which in Maxwell's earlier-quoted words "may take the form of a purely mathematical formula" rather than the form of a "physical hypothesis" or model. Any act of cognitive assent to theology's claims will have a necessary reference to theology's model of reality. But cognitive assent to a claim, P, incorporating P into one's scheme of things, is equivalent to affirming that P is true. Thus, since every theological truth-claim has a necessary involve- ment in the key theological model, the model in this sense must be judged true or false if any theological statements at all are judged true or false. This is not usually supposed to be the case with respect to scientific models, which are termed "fruit- ful" or "misleading," and the like, but not "true or false." Theological models, however, are of the essence for theology, and any attempt to withhold the notion 78Cf. Norwood Russell Hanson, Patterns of Discovery (London: Cambridge University Press, 1958), especially Chapter VI, "Elementary Particle Physics," for a clear discussion of the logical grounds of this impossibility. [35]</page><page sequence="28">The Christian Scholar of truth from these models is in effect a move to deny theology the right to deal in truth or falsity at all. Theological models, however, cannot justly be judged with respect to truth or falsity apart from the theories that articulate them, interpret them, and relate them to other cognitive domains, i.e. that provide the conventions for "reading" them cognitively. Here we have moved out, once again, to the edge of the subject matter to be dealt with in the present study, but it will at least be noticed that if theories in theology are never intelligible or true qua theological theories without models, so theological models do not function (cognitively, at least) without some theory, however implicit or however crude. A further difference which may be startling to those accustomed to the high rate of turn-over among the models of science is the remarkabe resistance to change exhibited by theological models. The situation in this respect is reversed in the two fields. For science, models are altered, discarded, or replaced with relatively little compunction as knowledge increases and the demands of theory develop. The highest level theoretical constructions, however, are tampered with only when absolutely necessary - and then reluctantly, since altering the prime theories of a science can bring about a major scientific revolution that may sweep away the patient labors put in by many over long periods of time. For theology, theories on the interpretation and the linking up of models to other areas of thought are abandoned or replaced in the light of increasing knowledge far more readily than are the models themselves. And the highest level models, those at key posi- tions within the overarching model of reality, are defended at all costs - defended most bitterly against the prophetic personalities who are usually the very ones who best succeed in altering the fundamental religious models - in the knowledge that a change in model signals a religious revolution that may sweep away that which has received the devotion of multitudes over the ages. The logical characteristic which may account for this interesting reversal is the difference between the scope for scientific and theological models. Theological models, sharing the unlimited inclusiveness of all metaphysical models, are in a limited sense "above change." Their empirically unfalsifiable character makes of them not necessarily "self -certifying myths" in all respects (since theological models do change and religions are reformed - and abandoned), but it does free them from the kind of forced change that is both the despair and the glory of the sciences.79 79My remarks about the experimental unfalsifiability of theological models should not obscure the requirement that the cognitive dimensions of theology eventually stand exposed to some forms of critical evaluation (that is, broadly speaking, to "verification" or "falsifica- tion"). These forms or methods will have the character of metaphysical testing in general, wherein the model-cum-theory's power to make coherent sense out of all empirical fact is one vastly important component. In this extended sense, then, even metaphysical world views are "falsifiable"; but this is "falsification" of a different kind than is being spoken about in most current discussion. The true "falsification" of a metaphysical position is more like an erosion [36]</page><page sequence="29">Mapping the Logic of Models in Science and Theology Just as a mountain of experimental data cannot move a mustard-seed of faith, so scientific conclusions and models of limited scope, cannot by themselves threaten or support theology. The science versus religion conflicts of yesteryear, on which we may now bring this study to a close, rested, most commentators now agree, on a mistake. But what was the mistake and on whom did it rest ? The answer to this ques- tion is not so simple or straightforward as is sometimes assumed, inasmuch as exclusive responsibility cannot be thrown onto either the scientist or the theologian and inasmuch as the mistake itself is less garish than are the colors in which it is sometimes painted. Essentially, theologians and scientists both misinterpreted the logic of theo- logical models, "reading" them as empirical assertions which could be (and were, on this interpretation, in fact being) disconfirmed in just the way appropriate to the assertions of astronomy, geology, or the like. Both must share responsibility for the error. But there are mitigating circumstances often unrecorded by modern analysts: the theories associated with theological models still tended to encourage just the error that was made, and it was only later, thanks largely, no doubt, to the way in which theological models refused to "stay falsified," but could endlessly bounce back from every scientific victory, that the logic of theological affirmations began to come clearer to all sides of the dispute. To compound the situation, the logical status of the scientist's own assertions were also not altogether clear to either of the contending parties. Just as theologians needed to learn that their statements of universal scope were not designed to rival the function of the scientist's limited and empirically confirmable propositions, so scientists required a warning against supposing that their carefully controlled and empirically specific statements could be set to work as propositions having un- limited scope and in competition with theology's - while remaining scientific state- ments.*0 If a sentence bred in science's neatly fenced pasture wanders off to frolic in metaphysics' Elysian Fields, it had better expect to receive new brand-markings ! Here, then, is a more complex picture than is normally offered. Scientific models and theories can, it seems, be metamorphosed into world-hypotheses of un- limited scope and thus become genuine metaphysical rivals (or allies) of theological models and theories. And the latter, while not entailing any specific empirical consequences or permitting straightforward empirical falsification can never be in- different to scientific conclusions, sirice they have as one of their most important cognitive functions the simplification and bringing into coherence of all knowledge. It was a mistake for scientists and theologians to have battled so hard over, say, the theory of evolution. Yes, but it was a mistake with many levels to be un- than an explosion - a gradual process in which the inadequate metaphysical view is not dis- proved but, rather, is quietly abandoned. 80Cf. Stephen Toulmin's excellent article, "Scientific Theories and Scientific Myths" in Metaphysical Beliefs, op. cit., for a discussion of scientific propositions gone astray. [37]</page><page sequence="30">The Christian Scholar tangled. Theologians were wrong to argue, qua theologians, for the immutability of biological species; but scientists were equally wrong to argue, qua scientists, that the evolutionary model, once scientifically established, could take the place of the God of theism.81 Both these questions must be argued with appropriate tools and on appropriate grounds. The concept of fixed species may be better or worse biology than the concept of mutating species, but to determine which is the case biological and paleontological arguments, not metaphysical ones, are appropriate; the model of a personal deity may or may not be better metaphysics than the model of an evolutionary universe, but to guide our choice metaphysical arguments, not biological or paleontological ones, are required. These points may help to place in logical focus the tensions which still may be found between science and religion - enlightened men in both fields knowing that they ought not to have any conflicts with the "other side," and yet finding grounds for anxiety or relief in pronouncements made or conclusions published. To a certain extent it is legitimate and even essential for theologians to be con- cerned about the models and theories of the sciences. Not only is it theology's job to offer (ideally) a conceptual synthesis containing all such models and theories but it may be that new models of great scope being developed by scientists may offer cognitive support or challenge. Where there is a challenge it will usually be found that the challenger is attempting to replace the theological model with the claim to do the cognitive job of the biblical picture of reality but to do it more adequately. And when there is support it will usually be found that the model taken by the theologian as promising support will do so by providing the theological model with new theoretical ties to other domains of established knowledge, these new semantical connections thus increasing the power of the biblical model to do its cognitive job more effectively than before. When a new model appears in field- theory, for example, the theologian may adopt it as part of the interpretative net surrounding his model and may draw upon it to help explicate that primary model and to draw coherent relations between it and other bodies of knowledge. "Perhaps this is what Christian faith means by 'man's freedom,' " a theologian might say, "man's behavior and choices determined by a field of forces responsibly controlled but not mechanically compelled. . . ." As such the scientific model (no longer used scientifically in any sense) becomes subordinate to the key biblical model itself, but it may thus function for theology with considerable importance. Unfortunately, it may acquire such importance to the theologian that when scientists, who have in the meantime hurried on, tell him that the model is "on the way out" or that it is being replaced or radically altered in its own domain, the theologian may feel threatened and thus be tempted to argue against the scientists - far over his depths 81Cf. Julian Huxley's Religion Without Revelation (London: Max Parrish, 1957, revised), Ch. IX, for a book that is well written and thoughtful but none the less an excellent specimen of this mistake.

And so the weary science-religion conflict goes on. My paper, for want of existing maps to follow, has had to make its own way through the underbrush. I hope that this initial exploration has not distorted its subject matter any more horribly than did the quaint old maps of Greenland or Africa now resting, peacefully, in antique shops. But even they, for all their faults, once served a purpose, until other expeditions and other cartographers returned to correct their errors. Similarly, this venture will have served its main intended function if it can attract others to see - and to improve - for themselves. Maps, after all, are logically no more than models. And models, we have learned, are to be taken as sacred only in theology.
