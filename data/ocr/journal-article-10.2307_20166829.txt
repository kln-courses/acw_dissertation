The Western classicist and modernist encounter with pre-Columbian art In 1520 the German artist Albrecht D?rer saw the objects that were sent to Europe from Mexico by the conquistador Cortez. These were displayed at the Town Hall of Brussels on the occasion of the celebration of the installation of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor. D?rer went to the Netherlands in order to see Charles V about his pension and to find new patrons for his paintings, prints, and sketches (Panofsky 1955a:205). D?rer wrote in his travel diary: I saw the things which have been brought to the king from the new land of gold (Mexico), a sun all of gold a whole fathom broad, and a moon all of silver of the same size, also two rooms full of the armour of the people there, and all manner of wondrous weapons of theirs, harness and darts, very strange clothing, beds, and all kinds of wonderful objects of human use, much better worth seeing than prodigies. These things were all so precious that they are valued at 100,000 florins. All the days of my life I have seen nothing that rejoiced my heart so such as these things, for I saw amongst them wonderful works of art, and I marvelled at the subtle Ingenia of men in foreign lands. Indeed I cannot express all that I thought there. (Conway 1889:101-102)' This passage is usually cited to affirm the beauty and artistic quality of pre-Columbian art, since it was written by a European artist of great stature. It is found, as a seal of approval, on the frontispiece or in the introductory essay of many books on pre-Columbian art (Nicholson with Keber1983:29).2 But what exactly does D?rer note in this passage? Perhaps what is most striking is his enthusiasm, yet in the next paragraph, he is just as enthusiastic about a huge fish bone: "At Brussels I saw many other beautiful things besides, and especially I saw a fish bone there, as vast as if it had been built up of squared stones. It was a fathom long and very thick, it weighs up to 15 cwt, and its form resembles that drawn here" (Conway 1889:102). Apparently, this was curious enough for him to draw it. In the next paragraph he speaks of another curiosity, a great bed that could sleep fifty. In the paragraph before the Mexican antiquities he describes the Town Hall and the King's house in equally laudatory terms: "And I saw out behind the King's house at Brussels the fountains, labyrinth and Beast garden; anything more beautiful and pleasing to me and more like Paradise I have never seen" (ibid.: 101). Read in context, then, D?rer's enthusiasm for the Mexican objects is not particularly remarkable. What he actually says about the Mexican objects is that they are of unheard-of value ?a hundred thousand florins. Perhaps value in this context has to do with the actual worth of so much gold and silver. He lists what these objects seem to be, such as weapons and strange clothing, but he says nothing about their appearance. Although he notes that some of these were wonderful works of art and especially commends their subtle Ingenia, or inventiveness (a category much valued in sixteenth-century theories on art), his last remark is very telling: "Indeed, I cannot express all that I thought there." This suggests that D?rer had difficulty verbally expressing his experience of these objects. He did not have this problem with Roman columns that he saw in Aachen, which he described as "well-proportioned" and "correctly made according to Vitruvius's writings" (ibid.: 106), nor with a Jan van Eyck painting that he calls "full of thought" (ibid.:117). A preliminary version of this paper was presented at the Mellon Society of Fellows in the Humanities at Columbia University, 18 November 1986. In several seminars on Teotihuacan art the following students made helpful suggestions and I would like to thank them here: Sue Bergh, Debra Hassig, Joanne Pillsbury, Patricia Sarro, Anne Schaffer, Andrew Shelton, Sarah Travis, and Margaret Young. 1. D?rer carried two little books with him, the contents of which both descended to us either in whole or in part. In one of these books he jotted down items of expenditure and occasional miscellaneous records and impressions. The original volume has been lost, but an old copy of it remains in the Bamberg library. The other was a sketchbook, and many of its leaves may still be seen in the public and private art collections of Europe (Conway 1889:92). 2. Keen's statement is typical: "The genius of Aztec artists and craftsmen had aroused the enthusiasm ... of a giant of Western art, Albrecht D?rer" (1971:70).</page><page sequence="3">106 RES 19/20 1990/1991 Figure 2.

Reproduced from Victor W. von Hagen, The Desert Kingdoms of Peru (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1965), pi. 134. What is also striking is what isn't there: D?rer traveled with his notebook and a sketch pad, and he frequently refers to sketches he made along the way, such as that of the giant fish bone. A surviving sketch of the Beast garden is also mentioned in the same section of the notebook, but nothing about sketches of the Mexican material. The Mexican curiosities were fascinating to see, for D?rer, but they were perhaps too alien to have any significance for his art. This inability to comprehend an alien culture was not limited to the visual forms of their "curious" material objects. B?cher (1981:32) has suggested that the physical features of the Native Americans who were brought to Europe by various explorers and conquerors, beginning with Columbus, were similarly elusive to Europeans. Attempts to describe or to depict them were generally in terms of their similarity or dissimilarity to Negro or Caucasian types, the only two races widely known at the time. For example, Bucher quotes a passage from D?rer in which he states that there are only two species of mankind, whites and negroes. Often, however, Indians were simply regarded as "ugly Europeans." D?rer's sketch of 1515 of a Tupinamba Indian in the margins of a Book of Hours made for Maximilian I, could just as well be a European dressed in an Indian feather costume (fig. 1). The conceptualization is similar to what an eighteenth-century costume design for Papageno in Mozart's opera The Magic Flute might have been (Chiapelli 1976:fig. 44). In the many famous books that have been published on the New World by the De Bry family, often there is not even a pretense at representing correctly Native American people, architecture, or works of art. The Incas bringing gold and silver treasures for the ransom of their king (fig. 2) are European classicizing figures walking toward a building with an arched doorway (De Bry 1596). Their nakedness is meant to indicate their savagery, even though Inca culture was practically obsessive about textiles, and clothing was essential in the cold highlands. Bucher has shown how the De Bry illustrations created a fantasy of a sometimes noble, and sometimes barbaric "Indian" that remained canonical for European thought for several hundred years without bearing any resemblance to reality. The subtext of much of the De Bry books suggests alternatively a "barbaric (cannibalistic) Indian" thus justifying their conquest by Protestant northern Europeans, or a "noble and moral Indian" tortured unjustly by Catholic southern Europeans, whose right to conquest is therefore ethically less than that of the northerners. Although there are many long lists itemizing the objects that were brought from the New World, there is not a single illustration from the sixteenth century. This is astonishing in itself. Moreover, though they were much</page><page sequence="4">Pasztory: Still invisible 107 admired as curiosities, these objects were hardly treated as treasures. The gold and silver were melted down, as is well known; other objects simply disappeared. Of the hundreds of Mesoamerican textiles that were sent to Europe and listed in the accounts, not a single one has survived. Some works, such as Aztec feather shields and insignia, were eventually rediscovered in the nineteenth century when they turned up in trunks in attics (Nowotny 1960, Anders 1971). Some were given to children as toys to play with. The Codex Borgia, for example, was saved only after children had burned holes in it (Humboldt 1810: 1:248-249). Evidently, after their value as curiosities had worn out, the objects had become worthless, because they had no meaning for the West. Until the nineteenth century, pre-Columbian styles remained largely invisible. This "invisibility" is also evident in the drawings made of pre-Columbian monuments by travelers, adventurers, and explorers, despite their evident interest in them. In many eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European drawings, these monuments are depicted either in a hesitant, irregular, and childishly naive style, or they have been reinterpreted through a classical style (Pasztory 1982:fig. 12). A drawing of 1832 of a now-destroyed relief from Palenque by the adventurer Count Jean Frederic Maximilien de Waldeck (fig. 3) reduced the Maya ornaments to a few that went well with a classicized body and drapery and left out most of the glyphs. The classicizing of pre-Columbian ?mages may have been a more or less Conscious attempt to prettify what seemed less attractive. It is hard to believe that Waldeck spent almost a year sketching the ruins. Certainly, his belief that the Maya derived from the Phoenicians, Chaldeans, and Hindus, while not in accord with his Europeanized drawings, does indicate the persistent assumption that the American Indian was not a unique ethnic or racial type, but some kind of a mixture of already known people (Bergh 1985). D?rer's description shows that in the sixteenth century even a great artist could only deal with the anomaly of so different an art by focusing on its strangeness, and at best commending it for being inventive. It is impossible to know from the available information to what extent D?rer was aware of the stylistic distinctions of this art, which were not generally appreciated until several centuries later. A great deal of progress was made in the latter half of the nineteenth century in the scientific study and recording of pre-Columbian antiquities. It is, however, only with the development of Modernism in the beginning of the twentieth century that pre-Columbian art received aesthetic affirmation. Henry Moore had described his discovery of pre Columbian art in the 1920s in the following words: Mexican sculpture, as soon as I found it, seemed to me true and right, perhaps because I at once hit on similarities in it with some 11th century carvings I had seen as a boy on Yorkshire churches. Its "stoniness," by which I mean its truth to material, its tremendous power without loss of sensitiveness, its astonishing variety and fertility of form invention, and its approach to a full three-dimensional conception of form, make it unsurpassed in my opinion by any other period of stone sculpture. (Russell 1968:30-31) This language is familiar in talking about art even today. The Modern Western artist's unique ability to see pre-Columbian art is related to the desire to create a nonclassical modern art. Moore wrote that it was important to get rid of the "complete domination of later, decadent Greek art as the only standard of excellence" (?bid.:22). This new vision is accompanied by a different Figure 3. Waldeck, lithograph of the Palenque Beau Relief. Reproduced from Brasseur de Bourbourg, Monuments Anciens du Mexique: Recherches sur les Ruines des Palenque (Paris: Arthus Bertrand, 1866).</page><page sequence="5">108 RES 19/20 1990/1991 verbal system of analysis and a specific descriptive vocabulary. In this system, terms such as "stoniness," "form-invention," and "three-dimensionality" are used as terms of approbation. D?rer, too, had an art theory and vocabulary, but he was concerned with perspective and proportion and classical authors on art, such as Vitruvius, none of which could he use in relation to pre-Columbian art. Nor could the term "full of thought," which he applied to van Eyck, be transferred outside of his familiar culture. For Henry Moore the primary qualities of sculpture are formal ones, irrelevant of cultural subject, function, time or place of origin, and they make it possible for him to bring together such unlikely juxtapositions as eleventh-century Yorkshire carvings and a sculpture from Chichen Itza. The only things these works have in common is that they are nonclassical. This attitude makes it possible for Moore to adopt some aspects of pre-Columbian art. He can borrow a male ritual altar figure and transform it into a reclining female nude within the Western tradition without feeling that this might be inappropriate (fig. 4). Moore visually refers to Mexican sculpture as a new authority for the kind of "universal" art he hopes to create. Mexican sculpture and eleventh-century Yorkshire art now replace Vitruvius as models.3 In Henry Moore's twentieth century, the art of the whole world is accessible both in reality, through travel, books, and museums, and conceptually, through comparative formal analysis in which all art styles can be described and distinctions drawn between them.4 Foreign works of art are appropriated through this discourse and incorporated into a global "modern" tradition. Closer analysis shows, however, that the language of Modernism is in large part merely an inversion of the classical language of art. The major difference is the decision as to what is perceived as beautiful or meaningful. What was "tremendous power without loss of sensitiveness" to Moore would have been merely "crude" by classical standards; while Moore dismissed Greek art as "decadent," D?rer would have seen in it "harmony and proportion." The balance of opposites is posited as an ideal by both the modernist and classical points of view, Figure 4. Henry Moore, Reclining Nude, 1929, stone, 81.28 cm. Collection of the City Art Gallery, Leeds; below, Chacmool Chichen Itza, limestone, 1.48 m. National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City. Reproduced from Philip James, ed. Henry Moore on Sculpture (London: Macdonald, 1966), p 41. which both assume a three-part development in art, of crude beginnings, a florescence of harmonious balance, and a final fussy deterioration. While the terms of approbation refer to notions of balance and harmony in both systems, the modernists apply them to what had been described as crude beginnings by the classicists and find artistic value primarily in the first third of the three-part system. That first level of development had been particularly derided in the classical view, because classicism emerged, point by point, in opposition to what it defined as "archaic." There can thus be no real agreement between modernists and classicists, although they both operate within the same system of thought. The value system of Modernism merely turns classicism on its head without providing a radically different mode of approach. 3. For an excellent analysis of Henry Moore's interest in pre Columbian art, see Barbara Braun, "Henry Moore and pre-Columbian art," Res 17/18 (Spring/Autumn 1989): pp. 159-178. 4. Describing his days on a scholarship to the Royal College of Art in London, Henry Moore wrote: "And not far away [i.e., from his lodgings], I had the National Gallery and British Museum and the Victoria and Albert with the reference library where I could get any book I wanted. I could learn about all the sculptures that had ever been made in the world" (Russell:22).</page><page sequence="6">Pasztory: Still invisible 109 Figure 5.

Thompson, The Rise and Fall of Maya Civilization, 2d ed., enlarged (Norman, Okla.: University of Oklahoma Press, 1954; 1966). The role of modernist artists in validating pre Columbian art, as art, in the first half of the twentieth century is well established. Here I want to emphasize the importance of the language that describes objects in terms of form, that compares the formal properties between objects of different times and places, and that places objects in a hierarchy of value, creating greater and lesser works of art out of the traditions of others. Writings on pre-Columbian art begin in this tradition and use European formal criteria in developing a non-Western art history. In this way Covarrubias (1957) and Toscano (1984) defined Maya style as naturalistic and curvilinear (fig. 5), and Teotihuacan as abstract and rectilinear. Covarrubias's "cubistic" drawing of the colossal unfinished sculpture from the quarry of Coatlinchan is in itself a validation of abstraction (fig. 6). The language ^^HlflL 1*%.??

The problem, however, is that formal analysis defines art on a continuum from abstract to naturalistic, which is primarily of concern to European art history. The naturalistic and curvilinear style of the Maya makes of them the "Classical Greeks" of the New World. The ideological rivalries of Europe are thus replayed on new soil. Today a double standard continues to operate in writings on pre-Columbian art. Although artists such as Henry Moore validated its non naturalistic traditions, the styles that are most valued aesthetically and monetarily in the marketplace and that confer the highest scholarly prestige in academia are still the most naturalistic ones such as the Maya of Mesoamerica or the Moche of Peru</page><page sequence="7">110 RES 19/20 1990/1991 (fig. 7). C. H. Reed who, in 1910, had the chance to select 250 Moche vessels for the British Museum from a private collection of 800, wrote a brief apologetic note about them in The Burlington Magazine. He begins by asking the reader to forgive him for even bringing up the art of so strange and primitive a people. He agrees with his imaginary reader that most of these pre-Columbian arts are rude, but exempts from these the Moche portrait vessels, which he finds astonishingly similar to the representation of Jean Duc de Berry on his tomb at Bruges, especially as it is known to him through a drawing by Holbein. He assumes as obvious that naturalism should be associated with superior civilizations because it is the art style of the technologically and politically superior West. Because of the association of naturalism with higher civilizations, it is preferred over abstraction for historical as well as aesthetic reasons. In this sense, even when it is valued by modernists, abstraction is associated with primitiveness. What they assert in effect is: "I don't care if it is primitive, that is precisely why I like it." In modernist thought, primitive remains, and necessarily must be "primitive," but it is relished. This double standard produces, paradoxically, a great interest in realism wherever it occurs outside of the West: naturalism is considered to be the highest form of art and, by extension, of civilization, whether one likes it or not. Recently, great enthusiasm greeted the discovery of portraiture among the Maya, both among scholars and the public interested in pre-Columbian art (Kubier 1969; Scheleand Miller 1986). Major unspoken distinctions are made between the abstractions of Western and so-called primitive peoples. For the modern artist an important aspect of abstraction is the reaction against the naturalistic classical tradition. In the case of Picasso in particular, there is proof in his early career that he could work in a naturalistic vein. Yet the assumption is that Eskimo artists, for example, cannot produce a realistic ?mage, that abstraction alone is accessible to them. In other words, for the modern artist abstraction is a choice, but for the non-Western artist it is a given. Moreover, for the modernist artist abstraction is a great achievement, while for the non-Western artist it is merely an inadequate attempt at representation. This point of view has been expressed most forcefully by Gombrich (1960) who argued that "conceptual" abstract art predates the development of "perceptual" naturalistic art, and that the creation of abstraction is easy and comes naturally, while the development of realism is a slow and difficult process comparable to the successive discoveries in Western science. Although Gombrich has been refuted by Bryson (1983) and others, his developmental model is still the dominant one. Such were the tenets underlying the Primitivism show of 1984 at the Museum of Modern Art, in which tribal works of art were exhibited alongside the modern European art that was supposedly influenced by them (Rubin 1984). Several reviewers (e.g., McEvilley 1984; Danto 1984; Ashton 1984; Bois 1985; and Clifford 1985), most of whom were highly critical of the exhibition, pointed out that one of its most striking features was the great contrast between the amount of explanatory texts around the works of modern art and the brief descriptive labels under the "tribal" pieces.5 In effect, what the exhibit conveyed was that for the modern artist abstraction is a complex visual, philosophical, and intellectual undertaking, while for the "tribal" artist it is something simpler and more natural. The exhibition evoked the following interpretation in the viewer: tribal artists use abstract forms because that is their inherited tradition, and, rather than innovating and experimenting with visual forms, they stick to tradition. Their abstraction is a lack of imagination, while ours is the height of imagination. Moreover, the captions demonstrated that forms that appear to be unusual in the West are in fact representations of a native's everyday reality. A twisted nose, for example, represents a type of illness and a literal physical deformation on a Pende mask, or the strange protrusions on the side of a Sen ufo mask represent a woman's coiffure (fig. 8). In this line of reasoning, the tribal artist loses out on "inventiveness" because the images are descriptions of reality after all, though they are not represented in a naturalistic style that would redeem them. Here, too, abstraction was seen as earlier than naturalism and therefore, by a Gombrichian historical definition, developmentally primitive. By these revaluations European modern art remains superior ?because of the historical situation in relation to classical art, because of the verbal and philosophical forms of awareness and analysis associated with it, and because of the element of choice present for the artist. This means that although the original interest that turned 5. Although the critics Ashton, Bois, Clifford, Danto, and McEvilley cringed from the simplistic art history and politics of the MoMA exhibit ("The Museum of Modern Art has given us a nineteenth-century model on the most pressing issues of the about-to-dawn twenty-first century." McEvilley 1985:68), the alternatives they suggested were meager. All the authors suggested a deeper contextualization within the individual societies and a broader historicization of the relationship of their societies to ours. They argued against Rubin's formalist asesthetic, but had no theory of art with which to replace it.</page><page sequence="8">Pasztory: Still invisible 111 Figure 7.

Westerners to non-Western art was its conventionalized and abstract character, given the discourses now available, it is still extremely difficult to talk about the less naturalistic traditions in a positive fashion. Recently, the art historian Robert Thompson showed pictures of some modern art works, including several Picassos, to a group of Africans.6 They interpreted them not through form but by meaning ?a heavy black stripe on the body and the dark circles under Picasso's eyes were interpreted as signs of something powerful, as in witchcraft. This exercise did not primarily show that Picasso's art has universal meaning that can be intuited by anyone, but rather that all people see foreign art through their own frameworks of significance. It is the critical discourse developed in the twentieth century that makes it possible to see and analyze pre Columbian art, but what is lacking is the existence in these traditions of local discourses that could be analyzed V / Figure 8.

In still existing "tribal" societies it is possible to collect that kind of information and to put objects into historical, ritual, and philosophical contexts. Oral traditions, information on artists, patrons, and rituals provide what is in effect a "text." For cultures that are known exclusively through archaeology and that have no writing systems, the possibility of textualizing seems hopeless. One is left with the images and alien systems of description and analysis. The archaeological attitude to artifacts is that they are primarily bearers of factual information, much like the illustrations in a lost ethnographic text. The costumes are assumed to be the ones worn, the weapons the ones used, the rituals reconstructed from the actions shown. Thus the artworks are interpreted: "This is what they did," "this is what they looked like." To some extent this is a reasonable assumption; artworks do reflect many aspects of reality. Generally, however, rather than representing life as lived, they show life from a very 6. Lecture at Columbia University, 1987.</page><page sequence="9">112 RES 19/20 1990/1991 specific point of view, much as modern advertising shows daily life from the point of view of those desiring to sell certain products. It is worth contemplating how people from another planet might reconstruct twentieth-century civilization on the basis of advertising ?mages. Some things they would know a great deal about, such as laundry soap, while other things would be a closed book. How would they reconstruct twentieth-century life on the basis of modern art if texts were not available? Because so many art historians dealing with pre Columbian art write for their peers who are largely anthropologists and archaeologists, their approach tends to collapse into a "soft" anthropology. In the recently popular catalogue, The Blood of Kings, Schele and Miller claim that they are not so much interested in analyzing Maya art, as in reconstructing Maya ritual. Their approach to such reconstruction is literal. For example, on the basis of the scene of a victim tied to a scaffold on a pottery vessel from an unknown source (Schele and Miller 1986:pl. 92) and the representation of a ruler shown seated in a niche above a ladder on a stela from Piedras Negras (ibid.:fig. Il, 4), they have reconstructed a Maya accession ritual that goes something like this: A victim was first sacrificed on the top of the scaffold. The ruler then stepped into his blood and subsequently climbed up into the niche. The footsteps present on the cloth over the ladder of the Piedras Negras stela are thus interpreted as being "bloody" and situated in an imaginary narrative that ties two different types of objects from different places together. Footprints, however, are common signs that are used in a number of Mesoamerican cultures to represent movement in a certain direction, without any indication that feet were dipped in blood, or anything else. They are symbolic and allegorical rather than literal. Aesthetic commentary by Schele and Miller is largely a validation of the skill, aesthetic refinement, and naturalistic representation found in Maya art, which makes it accessible to the Western viewer. These criteria might be a post-Modern revival of essentially nineteenth century concepts of art, as illustrated by Reed's enthusiastic evaluation of Moche art.7 The agenda of Schele and Miller is in some ways the opposite of Rubin's and that of the Museurh of Modern Art exhibit: the naturalism of Maya art is extolled in order to raise the level of Maya civilization in our eyes. (At the same time, its barbaric blood rituals are sensationalized so that we can revel in exoticism without jeopardizing our sense of cultural superiority.) 7. See, for example, the works of Charles Jencks, a tireless promoter of post-Modern art and architecture. Whether we favor abstraction or naturalism, the language of aesthetics in twentieth-century Western culture is deeply involved in the "ranking" of traditions and artists against each other, relevant as much for what is taught in schools as well as what is bought in galleries and museums. Moreover, even in the most intellectual polemics, such comparative artistic ranking of non Western traditions is often the justification of various current political postures. According to radical intellectual discourse, there can be no evaluation of the art of any group, whether ours or that of others, that isn't tainted by various ulterior motives and agendas that are both cultural, political, and personal. Without doubt, we are all attracted to the fields we study by mysterious empathies that are best left in the unconscious or on the couch of the analyst. This empathy may in fact be that critical factor that allows us a special insight into our fields of study. I am not assuming that absolute impartiality is available to anyone, nor that it is even desirable, but I am suggesting that in our interpretations we might encourage attitudes of greater detachment. Detachment is gained in comparisons. Perhaps we can cultivate the attitude of a hypothetical natural scientist studying birds and insects, to whom ants and hummingbirds are of equal interest, while trying to fit both ants and hummingbirds into some viable intellectual scheme. Perhaps our hypothetical natural scientist can even maintain a reasonably impartial attitude in studying ants, though perhaps preferring to watch hummingbirds, or vice versa. Such a scientific metaphor and model is very much the product of Western civilization and as such is not, by any means, value free. Nevertheless, the analysis of beings other than humans has allowed natural scientists a degree of detachment less available to anthropologists and historians. The following analysis of abstraction in the art of Teotihuacan is presented not to "raise my culture above your culture," but instead in this spirit of natural history. II. The Teotihuacan aesthetic of abstraction in cross-cultural perspective It is no accident that what is perhaps the most abstract tradition of Mesoamerican art, the art of Teotihuacan, has so far been the least studied and is the least known. Teotihuacan art has frustrated archaeologists and art historians alike by being resolutely non-narrative and non-naturalistic. Teotihuacan was the first great city in Mesoamerica, with pyramids that compare in size with those of Egypt and a population that was probably over a hundred thousand (fig. 9). Teotihuacan flourished</page><page sequence="10">Pasztory: Still invisible 113 Figure 9. View of Teotihuacan. Photo: Esther Pasztory. between a.D. 1 and 750, thus, more than 800 years intervened between its collapse and the Spanish conquest, when Westerners began the textual recording of pre-Columbian cultures. Because Teotihuacan is located in the same region as the later empire of the Aztecs, early writers tended to see it as an earlier version of Aztec culture. This was not an unreasonable assumption. Actually, the language spoken at Teotihuacan is not known, nor is the ethnic group to which the people belonged. What we have is the ancient city, 50 kilometers northeast of modern Mexico City, with an architecture of gigantic scale ?the avenue alone is nearly 1.6 kilometers long and up to 40 meters wide. The Aztecs, who came to power 500 years after the fall of the city, were greatly impressed by its ruined state, and thought that it must have been built by the gods. Hence, they called it Teotihuacan, meaning "The Place of the Gods," or "Where the Gods are Made" in N?huatl. They believed that the last creation of the world took place within the shadow of its pyramids. According to the various accounts thay gave of it to the Spanish chroniclers, for the Aztecs Teotihuacan was a place shrouded in myth and legend. Some years ago when I did my dissertation on the mural paintings of Teotihuacan, I, like the others who approach them, wanted to know mainly what they represented in a factual, archaeological way (Pasztory 1976). Using sixteenth-century texts and a contextual analysis of its signs and combinations in art, I identified a rain god, a nature goddess, and, more tentatively, a war god. I suggested that these gods had later Aztec parallels not in the sense of a specific continuity of gods and cults, but in the sense of belonging to generally similar religious systems and perhaps even comparable ritual traditions. The use of ethnographic analogy in interpretation was firmly in the tradition of pre-Columbian iconographie studies. I also tried to analyze the murals in terms of their style, and to create a stylistic chronology. I then tried to interpret this chronology in a somewhat W?lfflinian way by defining its period styles and eliciting possible cultural meanings from them. This part was less successful; I was plugging pre-Columbian matter into the machine of European art history. My results were some partial insights and a lot of frustration. Using Aztec texts to explain Teotihuacan, eventually it became necessary to devote some time to the study of Aztec art. It was a joy and a relief to work with a tradition for which abundant texts are available, but it led to the unexpected conclusion that the texts were not particularly helpful even in the case of Aztec art. Although the texts were very helpful in creating a cultural context, I found that the answers to my most pressing questions about Aztec art resided in the artworks themselves ?in their forms and compositional contexts. The textual references to works of art were rarely clear and specific enough to provide meaning. They remained interesting but marginal glosses (Pasztory 1983). My project on Aztec art, paradoxically, resulted in a greater confidence in dealing with the works of art in themselves. I decided to tackle the art of Teotihuacan once more. In a second encounter with the art of Teotihuacan what was most astonishing was the feeling that I was</page><page sequence="11">114 RES 19/20 1990/1991 discovering it completely anew. It was as though I had really never seen it the first time around, which showed how difficult it is really to see a strange style, how much it is seen through the personal framework of the viewer, and the extent to which seeing is determined by the availability of words to describe it. There is no sure way to account for the change, but through the convergence of contextual studies of pre-Columbian art and semiotic and structural literature, by 1983 Teotihuacan began to emerge for me out of its former obscurity. One moment of understanding came with the discovery of a rather simple relief fragment (fig. 10). I had known nothing about this relief fragment, until I found it in 1983 casually placed, leaning against a wall near the entrance to the Temple of the Feathered Conches. Inquiries led the guard to tell me that he thought it might have belonged to some unfinished excavations conducted many years ago and that it had been part of a heap of worked stones of various sorts piled under a tree. He did not know how or why the relief got to the wall it was leaning against. As far as I could tell, it had not been photographed, catalogued, or studied, which may perhaps be attributed to its severely abstract appearance. The image on the relief is abstract in the sense of a reduction and simplification of forms.8 Studies in perception have shown that humans are biologically predisposed to search for meanings even in very vague forms, such as clouds and driftwood. In this Teotihuacan design one is quick to see something reminiscent of a face. One may then note formal qualities, such as a flat squarish outline, within which in low flat relief there are two circular shapes and a rectangular one represented below a large rectangle subdivided into two sections. Assessing the organization of these elements, it may be noted further that the forms are kept separate without overlapping, that their organization is bilaterally symmetrical, and that geometric forms and horizontal lines predominate. The irregular hole in the center, which may be due to reuse or to a "killing" of the object, clashes with the sense of order in the design. The irregular upper edge indicates that something has broken off from the top. The language of formalism gets us more or less this far. The ?mage that is here called abstract is often called conceptual ?a term coined by Gombrich. Images that 8. Although the term "abstraction" is sometimes defined narrowly to include only non-figurative art, it is used here in the broader sense, to refer to an art in which all subjects are rendered in a strongly conventionalized style that results in a reduction to simple lines and shapes sometimes approximating geometric forms. Teotihuacan art is "abstract" in the sense in which the art of Paul Klee is abstract. Figure 10. Stone relief, possibly a roof ornament. Height around 50.8 cm. Teotihuacan Site Museum.

Placed next to the Teotihuacan relief, the Olmec head (fig. 11) would be called perceptual. The conceptual/perceptual dichotomy works best, if at all, at the two ends of the scale, for it is impossible to define at what precise point a conceptual ?mage becomes perceptual, and vice versa. The terms are therefore comparative. Art historians, discussing European art (a largely perceptual tradition), delight in demonstrating the many arbitrary conventions and patterns they find within naturalistic art (Brilliant 1987). A most telling statement along these lines was made by the seventeenth century Italian sculptor, Bernini, who said that in order to make his portraits look more alive he added projections and depressions to his sculptures that were not actually in the faces of his sitters (Martin 1977:274-275). All art then is conceptual, particularly ?mages created on two dimensional surfaces. The difference is that some seek to give the illusion of reality, while others attempt to create a reality that is not in the visible world, a process interpreted as abstraction.9 9. Realistic traditions may seek to represent an invisible world as well, as in the portrayal of monsters and imaginary creatures, but the</page><page sequence="12">Pasztory: Still invisible 115 Much has been made of ?ntentionality in the modern artist's use of abstraction at the beginning of the twentieth century.10 Is there any evidence in the case of Teotihuacan that would throw light on this question? Monumental art had been made by the Olmec and the Olmec-related Izapan tradition for nearly 1,000 years prior to Teotihuacan, starting at about 1200 bc. This tradition was based on naturalistic portraits and life-size figures commemorating dynastic rulers. Such monuments can be found at Chalcatzingo, an Olmec-related site not far from Teotihuacan, which, judging by the remains, was probably known to them (Pasztory in press). Teotihuacan was contemporary with the Early and Middle Classic Maya, who like the Olmec, had a tradition of naturalistic representation. In both Maya and Olmec art the primary subject is the dynastic ruler. On Maya monuments historic inscriptions in hieroglyphic texts name the rulers and their families. We know that the people of Teotihuacan and the Maya were in contact with one another, because of borrowings that are evident in their art. Some monuments suggest remarkably close ties. On Tikal stela 31, the Maya ruler is flanked by an individual dressed in Teotihuacan costume ?a shell necklace and big feather headdress ? and on the side he carries the frontal face of a Teotihuacan deity on his shield (fig. 12). Mayanists have not yet decided conclusively whether this figure is a "Teotihuacan ambassador" or possibly even the father of the ruler represented in front. As a system of representation, therefore, some form of naturalism was known and available to the rulers and artists of Teotihuacan. I suggest that abstraction was a Teotihuacan choice and not simply the "norm" of a tradition, and I have argued elsewhere that one of the reasons was precisely to differentiate themselves from neighbors whose cults of dynastic commemoration included individualized representation (Pasztory 1988 and in press). Obviously at this point this refers to collective aim of such representations is the creation of the illusion that these might be real, and it is a way of adapting the imaginary to the real world. 10. "Are anthropologists trapped in an outdated intentional fallacy?" asked Kirk Varnedoe and Rosalind Krauss in a position paper at a symposium of art historians and anthropologists in connection with the "Primitivism" show at MOMA. Discussion degenerated into a shouting match. I am aware of the current trend that questions the existence of ?ntentionality of the modern artist, and sees him as the vehicle of concepts current in society. However, since ?ntentionality is generally denied to earlier arts on the basis that everything in them is determined by tradition, it is necessary to address this issue. I ntentionality may be irrelevant to Western art, which has had a surfeit of it, but needs to be demonstrated in non-Western art, which has had a surfeit of contextualization. cultural choices rather than a personal one, but that is merely how it looks from an archaeological vantage point. Although C?zanne, Picasso, and Braque loom large as innovators in Modernism, their acceptance and elevation as cultural ?cons were also collective cultural choices. Conversely, individual patrons and artists, while undocumented, were important in prehistory too. As I will show later, we can sometimes reconstruct even now the nature of artistic innovation and audience response in some aspects of Teotihuacan mural painting. What was remarkable initially in the unknown relief lying against the wall, was obviously not a richness of imagery or representation, but its spartan language of signs that pulled together all of my previous knowledge about Teotihuacan art. A mural painting from the Tetitla apartment compound came to mind, immediately shedding light on the relief (figs. 13 a, b). In comparing these two ?mages, the "face" of the relief turned out not to be a face at all. What was read as "eyes" were actually earplugs and what was read as "mouth" was a Figure 11.

The face is, in fact, a set of costume elements (including the rectangular frame headdress) that are the insignia of the nature goddess represented on the Tetitla mural. The significance of this discovery lay not only in the explanation of the image's meaning; more importantly, I had acquired an insight into how Teotihuacan ?mages were constructed. The ?mage was probably meant to be read simultaneously in two ways: both as a face and as the insignia belonging to a face. It suggested an awareness of the absence of a persona, while at the same time implying its presence. This image tells us about faces ? evidently their visibility can be unimportant or suppressed ?and something about costume, which appears to be all important. The relief is the embodiment of a visual ambiguity and a double meaning, which oscillates between presence and absence. This relief is not the only work that shows the goddess without features. In the Temple of Agriculture mural small humans are shown making offerings to mountain-shaped forms with the insignia of the goddess of the absent face (see fig. 28). This comparison of the relief and the Tetitla mural dramatizes two processes that are at work in the art of Teotihuacan: the same subject can be shown reduced to a bare minimum of significant details, or it can be expanded to elaborate versions. Compressed ?mages approximate glyphs or emblems and seem to function as denotative verbal equivalents. In its most minimal form, Teotihuacan art seems to approach the forms of written signs. Expanded ?mages may be replete with a multiplicity of redundant signs, whose meaning may add connotative richness and variety to the essential denotative meaning of the emblem. Although the Tetitla image is clearly at the elaborate end of the scale ?n the representation of "nature goddess" ?mages, here too the human body ?s suppressed. The only human features of the Tetitla goddess are the yellow hands, which indicate the convention of representing female bodies in yellow that ?s shared with the Aztecs. The upper half of the face is painted green, presumably to represent a greenstone mask well known among Teotihuacan remains (fig. 14). Instead of the lower half of the mask, the bottom half of</page><page sequence="14">Pasztory: Still invisible 117 the face is partially covered with red paint allowing the yellow color of the face to appear as dots. In effect, except for the yellow dots, the face of the goddess is covered by a variety of means, including that of a mask, and/or facial paint. All the rest of the figure consists of dress and insignia. One of the evident conclusions to be drawn is that there is a strong Teotihuacan avoidance of the representation of the body, particularly that of the human body, and that deities are envisioned as consisting primarily of costumes and signs. This aspect of the Teotihuacan ?mage system has led some scholars, most notably Langley (1986), to see whether Teotihuacan art might have been structured as a system of writing. His aim was made clear in the preface where he says that: "Despite all the research directed to Teotihuacan there was no systematic catalogue of the signs that were incorporated in its art and constituted the sole vestige of a writing system without which it seemed inconceivable that the city could have developed on the grandiose scale to which its remains testified" (italics mine). Langley's exhaustive analysis of signs and sign clustering in Teotihuacan art demonstrates only a few instances of linear or numerical organization that can be considered parts of genuine systems of notation. Indisputable glyphs, very similar to later Mixtee and Aztec ones, occur in several murals (such as the Flowering Trees and Feathered Serpents and the Goggled Figures with Tassled Headdresses formerly in the Wagner collection, [Berrin 1988] and on a few vessels and conch shells, etc.) indicating that recognizable writing did exist at Teotihuacan but was generally not incorporated into works of art. The search for evidence of writing at Teotihuacan is motivated, in part, by the desire to upgrade Teotihuacan to the level of the Mayas and the ancient Egyptians. By treating the entire image system as a step towards the evolution of true writing, the art can only seem like a failed system of writing, rather than an image system presumably adequate to Teotihuacan and successful on its own nonglyphic terms. Paradoxically, the major contributions in Langley's study are the analyses of the nonlinear, multivalent structuring patterns of the signs. While the art of Teotihuacan is a failed writing system in the view of some, ?t is a failed representational system in the view of others. Teotihuacan is discussed in terms of lacking the major features of classical and Renaissance European art such as the representation of depth in perspective, modeling in light and shadow, and ?n general, a "perceptual" approach that creates the illusion that a two-dimensional surface is a "real" segment of the world. Many of these missing features are aspects of the much noted insistence on flatness in Teotihuacan painting and sculpture (Miller 1973:24; Toscano 1984:123-124). I suggest that what we see as the literal suppression of the human embodiment of the goddess is related to the Teotihuacan insistence on presenting experience ?n two-dimensional rather than three dimensional forms. It is interesting to note, in this connection, that the two relatively abstract traditions in Europe ?medieval and Modern art ?are also characterized by this rejection of the primacy of the human body and the sensory realm in association with a preference for flat surfaces. Gombrich once commented that the art of the world is a vast ocean of conceptual art, broken up here and there by islands of naturalism (1963:9). Western art history as a discourse began by tracing perceptual art styles from conceptual antecedents: Classical Greek style from Egyptian, and Renaissance styles from medieval. As a result, in the language of Western art history, conceptual painting styles elsewhere have been defined in terms of their differences from the ideal of classical arts. These descriptions are usually couched in negatives ? i.e., they don't have perspective, they don't have light and shade and modeling and so on. A litany of these negative traits can be found in Western descriptions of artistic traditions from Persian miniatures to Mixtee manuscripts (Stchoukine 1959:141-159; Robertson 1959:15-24).11 This negative tradition of describing nonclassical styles goes back to art history at the turn of the century when art historians were struggling to characterize and explain the "primitiveness" of early Greek art. For example, the following passage from Loewy's essay of 1907 on Greek art was quoted by Robertson in 1959 to explain the nature of Mixtee art: The main features of the human body are always shown in their broadest expanse and their most typical aspect... all areas within the outline tend to be colored in a flat wash of unshaded color and forms do not overlap more than is absolutely necessary. No attempt is made to represent three dimensional space in an illusionistic fashion. (Robertson 1959:23). Discussion of the possibility of what such arts have rather than what they lack, has been pioneered by Meyer Schapiro, whose interests in medieval and Modern art 11. Robertson (1959:16) uses the term "horror vacui" to describe the distribution of elements in Mixtee manuscripts, which he says "we associate with various kinds of so-called primitive art." Nevertheless, he defends pre-Columbian conceptual art by suggesting that the "forms of manuscript signs are controlled by the same general artistic conventions that governed Archaic Greece, Egypt, or even contemporary primitive art" (1959:24).</page><page sequence="15">118 RES 19/20 1990/1991 '*3E*? Figure 13a. Mural Painting of the goddess from the apartment compound of Tetitla, Teotihuacan. Photo: INAH Mexico. Figure 13b. Drawing of the goddess in the Tetitla mural of Figure 13a. Reproduced from Laurette Sejourn?e, Burning Water: Thought and Religion in Ancient Mexico (New York: The Vanguard Press, 1956), fig. 80. have brought him closest to this issue (1969). Using semiotic analysis, he suggested that the flat field on which an image is made, whether a piece of paper or a wall, already has inherent in it certain properties: it has an edge and a possible frame, a definite center; it implies directions of top and bottom, right and left, and concepts of above and below. Accordingly, although the inherent structural properties of the flat field are variously exploited in different traditions, unrelated works often show striking structural parallels. Schapiro made the important observation that such flat fields do not seem to be the earliest of human arts, since complex human artifacts such as flat and neatly bounded walls, stelae, and various types of papers, panels, and books, are usually coeval with settled civilization (ibid.-.486-490). Taking these ideas further, Summers has discussed the Teotihuacan mural of Tepantitla to demonstrate what he called the "planar structure" of "conceptual order" (1982). His use of the semiotic term "sign" for the various elements of the design, which were previously called symbols or motifs, is very useful since there is no need to make any distinctions in terms of what the signs mean, whether they are symbolic or not.12 Signs in Teotihuacan art are visually designated by being clearly outlined and are rather freely moved from one ?mage to the next according to the requirements of iconography. Summers argued that the primary aim of such "conceptual order" and one naturally suggested by the flat field, is a representation of the structural relations of hierarchy. In the case of the Tepantitla mural (fig. 15), that hierarchy consists of the centrality of the large nature goddess shown frontally, while smaller priest figures are shown in profile in relation to her (fig. 16). Still smaller human figures are placed in the scenes below them. Unfortunately, in his article too, the discussion is implicitly arranged in an evolutionary sequence, from abstraction to naturalism; Tepantitla is followed by an Assyrian relief, which is in turn followed by a Jan Van Eyck painting, all of which show variation on a bilaterally symmetrical plan demonstrating "hierarchy." The contribution of Summers's article lies in his notion of "conceptual order," which can be used to bind together art from various times and places without any negative implications. Almost all "conceptual" traditions in which hierarchic values and size relations are primary, lack perspective projection in the rendering of space. It would, in fact, be inconsistent with them ?size differences have contradictory meanings in hierarchic and naturalistic representations. Yet the "flatness" of Teotihuacan art and of most conceptual art is too often taken for granted. Miller's description of Teotihuacan painting is overly emphatic: 12. Actually, as early as 1959, Robertson used the term "sign" to analyze the elements of Mixtee art (p. 23).</page><page sequence="16">Pasztory: Still invisible 119 * *"-\ ? Figure 14. Detail of the face of the goddess from Figure 13a. Photo: Esther Pasztory. A remarkable stylistic feature of Teotihuacan murals is the flatness of the ?mages in painting. The motifs represented ?n any Teotihuacan mural are invariably shown in an attitude which emphasizes the two-dimensionality of the motif, i.e. the broadest aspect of it which has height and width. It is as if all the motifs represented in the murals are pushed forward, compressed, flattened out against the picture plane by some invisible force behind the ?mages in the painting. If one were to draw a ground plan of the ?mages in a Teotihuacan mural, the space shown would be as thin as a piece of paper. In fact the paper analogy is particularly appropriate here because much of Teotihuacan painting looks as if it were composed of motifs which are paper cutouts pasted on a flat surface. (Italics mine.) (M/7/er 7973:24; A more than cursory examination of Teotihuacan painting indicates that this is not quite the case. Many examples can be cited to show that even in such flat conceptual styles the artist is aware of problems of space and of the complexities of translating three dimensions into two dimensions. In the Teotihuacan mural (fig. 17) of a coyote dressed in a feather headdress (referring allegorically to a deity), the torso of the animal, and especially the collar shown looped around its neck, suggests dimensional form. Western art history has dealt with this type of spatial projection only as a "primitive" form of representation, in which the artist nevertheless has some glimmerings of perspective. (Miller's denial of the rendering of space in Teotihuacan art suggests that the strength of the "conceptual-perceptual" paradigm of Western art history might have channeled his vision and interpretation as much as the actual appearance of the murals.) In a persuasive study of the geometry of projective systems in world art, Hagen has shown that all two dimensional renderings belong to one of four projective systems (1986). Each of these systems is internally consistent and coherent and is, moreover, related to the "natural perspective" of vision. She terms these the metric, similarity, affine, and projective projections (fig. 18). In the metric, or orthogonal projection, planes and projection lines are both parallel; such projections assume multiple observer station points. Metric projection characterizes "flat" or "planar" styles such as Egyptian, Teotihuacan, or medieval art. Metric projection has the advantage of preserving more visual invariants than any other type of projection, such as angles and parallels, that relate to the way things are. In that sense, metric projection is the most realistic. In similarity projection the planes are parallel, but the projection is from a single, central station point. Similarity projection is characteristic of one-point Renaissance perspective. There are fewer invariants in this type of projection, because the entire image is reduced in scale, and a number of invariants, such as right angles, have to be distorted. In affine projection, the planes are not parallel to</page><page sequence="17">120 RES 19/20 1990/1991 Figure 15.

Hagen's example of affine perspective is primarily the Japanese Yamato-e painting, in which multiple station points from a distant viewing point result in a "bird's-eye" perspective. In affine projection neither people nor structures diminish in size in the distance. Hagen's last category is projective projection, in which planes are not parallel and the projection is from a central point. Post-Renaissance European art and some types of Chinese painting are her examples. This type of projection distorts information the most, and has the fewest invariants, but appears to us to be the most realistic and has been called "perceptual." The reason for this may be that our actual experience of the world is rarely stationary but is always in motion, as we walk about and look in different directions. We are therefore used to making fast spatial appraisals of our situation, in which we pay little attention to the invariants important to how things really are, and as they are represented in metric projection. Metric projection assumes a huge, stable world that requires multiple station points for the observer in order to be experienced. It is an all enveloping projection of the world. Similarity projection, by contrast, is man-centered: it shows the cone of vision from a single station point. The view may be "deep" but it is also "small and narrow." In Hagen's view, neither metric nor similarity projection is any more realistic than the other, they simply measure reality differently. This makes a major step forward in the analysis of spatial representation: Hagen analyzes projection systems not as levels of technological or psychological-perceptual developments, but as cultural choices. There probably is a relationship between the types of projective systems and the world view, socio-political development, and other aspects of a given culture, but they are not tied irrevocably to cultural levels. She notes, for example, that renderings in projective perspective can be found in Paleolithic and Bushman rock art (?bid.:232-238).</page><page sequence="18">Pasztory: Still invisible 121 Figure 16.

In general, the mural painting of Teotihuacan fits neatly into Hagen's metric division. In the case of the coyote mural (see fig. 17), however, the position of the legs and of the chest are rendered not in metric but in affine projection. Although the coyote mural does not show foreshortening, it suggests space by a combination of metric and affine renderings. (Hagen mentions other instances in which two projective systems are combined. There are other examples where affine details are "nested" [her term] in metric paintings or similarity projection sections "anchor" a painting otherwise mainly in projective projection.) Hassig notes similar examples of metric projection combined with details in affine rendering in medieval art (see Hassig's article in this issue).13 13. Especially interesting in medieval art is the classical image making system based on projective projection, light and shade, and modeling that is adapted to a metric projective system. Bits and pieces of the classical remain in postures and draperies, but the overall system The importance of space in a painting tradition as "flat" as that of Teotihuacan, may be illustrated by one of the most enigmatic creatures in its iconographie repertoire, the so-called net jaguar (fig. 19). This feline has no substantial body at all in many paintings, in that it and the background are often the same color, but the spatial turnings and twinings of the net that defines its body are carefully detailed in such a way that once again one is aware of both presence and absence. This is a quintessential Teotihuacan image and is not found in the art of any other Mesoamerican culture. Unfortunately, since it did not outlast the collapse of the city, all that is known of this creature is that it is shown in water, fertility, and military contexts, information that is so generally true of Teotihuacan images as to be of little use. It illustrates, however, that spatial renderings are not only not "missing" in Teotihuacan art, but that in fact Teotihuacan was obsessed by the play between two and three-dimensional renderings in its mural paintings. In descriptions of such "conceptual" painting it is often asserted that composition follows the law of clarity: body parts and elements are arranged so that they offer the greatest visibility in order to display all the necessary information, often in the form of discreet signs. Actually, Hagen has shown that "clarity" is partly the result of the many invariants inherent in the choice of a metric projection mode. Clarity as such, however, does not always appear to be an important or even primary value in representation. This is the case at Teotihuacan, where despite the clear and heavy outlines and metric projection, murals are often hard to decipher (figs. 20 a, b). (Miller [1978:63-64] was the first to note this.) In part, this is due to their color, based essentially on shades of red, green, blue, and yellow with only a rare use of black and white. As a result, the color values are very close and especially difficult to distinguish in black and white photographs. The artist of the Tetitla mural has situated an already spatially confusing net jaguar against an ornate background that is based on diagonal stripes. It is a visual feat to distinguish the road and temple that are located next to and partially "behind" the feline. Deciphering difficulties abound, too, in medieval stained glass or Irish and Persian manuscripts, all of which require considerable familiarity in order to be "read" (see Hassig's article in this issue). Clarity is therefore not the key to the understanding of conceptual styles or the choice of metric projection. is metric, ornamental, hierarchic, and semiotic, rather than being perceptual. It illustrates the fact that styles do not necessarily progress from metric to projective and that at any point a shift may be made from one to the other.</page><page sequence="19">122 RES 19/20 1990/1991 -^ ** Figure 17. Mural fragment of a coyote with headdress and necklace. Reitberg Museum, Zurich. Photo: Douglas Fraser. As any ordinary man in the street baffled by Modern art can testify, such an "abstract" rendering seems to hide as much as it informs. Unlike naturalistic art, which after brief acquaintance with its conventions is readily accessible to a wide public (note the popularity of movies and novels), abstract traditions are inherently more difficult to access. In the Tetitla painting of the Net Jaguar and the Temple, once the eye gets used to the decorative complications, it becomes clear that all the space unfolds in overlapping layers, as in a pop-up book. The one exception is the path with the directional footprints, which takes a turn and moves from the front layer with the feet of the jaguar to the back layer with the temple in a passage that defies the logic of the rest of the painting. This point of disjunction makes it the focus to which the eye returns over and over again. Consequently, the "empty space" at the entrance to the temple acquires the kind of visual resonance that may correspond to symbolic meaning. Here, too, we may be dealing with an absent presence. In the art of Teotihuacan, space is sometimes denied and sometimes asserted, as the artist explores the possibilities of two and three dimensions for expressive purposes. Particularly evident in this mural is the need for the viewer to explore the mural actively in order to discern what it represents. It requires time, interest, and energy. Such painting assumes a public thoroughly educated into its conventions and willing to play such a game of visual hide-and-seek. One might say, by contrast, that naturalistic representation encourages a more facile and passive viewing.14 A description of non-Western conceptual painting that is based on negative factors will result in a definition of an art that lacks life and possibilities unless it is moving towards realism. Non-naturalistic styles, however, do have considerable aesthetic and expressive potentials of their own. One major advantage of a non-naturalistic style is, for example, that it can go into a great variety of formal directions without losing visual coherence. Body parts can be disassembled and reassembled at will as separate signs, without looking as if an organic body had been violently mutilated (fig. 21). The destructive aspect of the nature goddess, for example, can be suggested by her disembodied mouth full of teeth and her hands turned into claws. Her headdress turns into a shield that can also be read as a medallion; as such it is similar to a glyph-sign, since glyphs may be elaborated into medallions as well (fig. 22). This kind of an image can be 14. The accessibility of naturalistic images is desired as a mode of communication by certain contemporary artists such as Duane Hanson (Bush 1976) but is condemned in the form of media ?mages by many modern critics as untruthful, precisely because accessibility makes these ?mages "diabolically seductive" (Baudrillard 1987). In an article entitled "Immigrant Writing: Give Us Your Maximalists" (The New York Times Book Review 28 August 1988), Mukherjee writes: "I feel that Minimalism [by which she means a sort of abstraction] is nativist, it speaks in whispers to the initiated. As a newcomer, I can feel its chill, as though it were designed to keep out anyone with too much story to tell."</page><page sequence="20">Pasztory: Still invisible 123 described as a diagram, rather than the more coherent and substantial ?mage suggested at Tetitla. Of course, the "coherence" of the Tetitla ?mage is merely one of degree, and is perhaps read into it by those of us who are used to organically coherent European images. In Teotihuacan art, signs can be composed in a way that results in the visualization of a "naturalistic" scene. In this detail from Tepantitla (fig. 23), a stream, consisting of bands of eyes and fish signifying water, meanders next to vertical and horizontal sections of green and blue that represent cultivated fields, further so designated by squash plants. Trees and plants, including corn and cacao, grow along the banks and a human figure is shown seated under a tree. The double meanings of the ?mage delight the viewer because one sees it as a scene and a set of signs simultaneously, as in some of the poetry of e. e. cummings, where both the words and the shapes of the poem on the page are meaningful. One can readily imagine that the people of Teotihuacan similarly enjoyed this kind of visual play. It is mistaken to read such ?mages as heading towards naturalism ?n any evolutionary sense. The possibility of unfolding the sign is, apparently, always there; the wavy lines that stand for water can open up to show shell-gatherers half in and half out of the water (figs. 24 a, b). In still other contexts, decorative homogeneity takes precedence over natural appearance. One example, originally from an apartment compound called Techinantitla (fig. 25), is a mural of little trees with glyphs above their roots which looters cut up into more than 40 fragments. In trying to reconstruct their original sequence, it has been shown that nine glyphs correspond to nine different flowers. Some of the flowers have been tentatively identified, such as the marigold, which is still considered sacred ?n Mexican Day of the Dead ceremonies (Pasztory 1988b:137-161). Yet identification is difficult because these engaging plants do not necessarily look like the species they represent. The agave cactus, for example, is represented by the glyph of three cactus spines ?n the trunk of the tree on the right of this fragment and by the spines hanging from the yellow flowers, which function purely as signs. The function of these trees ?s to denote "plants" purely as signs. The artists are perfectly capable of rendering cacti and do so on several other murals. The Techinantitla plants, however, are not intended to look like any species, but, rather as plants in general. This is also indicated by the fact that they have roots; in the "scene" at Tepantitla the plants did not have roots because there the laws of scenic representation required that they be inside the earth. The Techinantitla plants in this context could look like anything from vines to trees, because their appearance was secondary to the desire for symbolic coherence and decorative design. The attitude towards ornament and decorative design has been essentially negative in the twentieth-century West, which seems to be one chapter ?n a long European polemic for and against ornament that can be traced back to classical Greek authors. Gombrich (1979) summarizes this polemic, and suggests that various classical and Renaissance authors associated ornamental restraint with morality and elegance, and ornamental excess with sexuality and vulgarity. In general, therefore, the Western classical tradition has been against ornament, and Gothic and later rococo styles were at times condemned on Figure 18.

In the nineteenth century, industrialization and the machine replication of ornamented things drove many artists and historians into two directions ?either into the veneration of the handmade work of the craftsman, as in the followers of William Morris, or into the elimination of ornament altogether, as in the work of functionalist modern architects. For a brief period the ornamental arts of exotic non-Westerners such as Muslims were extolled in reaction against classical values, but basically the anti ornamental approach exemplified by Adolf Loos came to prevail, primarily in the modernist architecture of the first half of the twentieth century that was largely stripped of decoration. In 1908 Loos published an essay entitled Ornament und Verbrechen in which his motto was "ornament is crime" (cited in Gombrich 1979:60). The twentieth century thus inherited a combination of classical and modern functionalist ideas firmly set against decoration. Ornament has made a comeback in post Modern architecture, curiously in the context of a classical revival, which places bits of classical ornament on essentially modern buildings. The current atmosphere therefore may be more positive for the understanding of decoration. Decorative art has also been losing out in traditional Western art history because of art historians' preoccupation with meaning. The search for hidden meaning in iconography exemplified by the work of Panofsky (all the more precious when it was hard to find) had resulted in a tendency to see ornamental art as literally "meaningless" and therefore "mere" decoration. There is not much point in trying to find meanings for decorative art and thus provide validation for it.15 Current art historical attitudes, which see works of art as not having a single intrinsic meaning, but as sites for the production of various meanings, and which focus on the function of the work of art, allow for the formulation of functions and meanings for ornament that had not been possible in earlier discourses. It is perhaps not accidental that decorative and formal elaboration appears to go hand in hand with abstract "conceptual" traditions. The real question is not what ornament means, but what it does. The illusion of naturalism requires that most of the image be "readable" as a segment of the visible world ? even if the representation is of imaginary beings such as dragons or angels. Turning the tables on our usual discourse, one might say that naturalistic art "inhibits" the development of ornament. Ornament is relegated either to areas reserved for it, such as frames and borders outside of the 15. At one time it was thought that all ornamental designs in "primitive" art were meaningful and symbolic in the sense of having some "magic" meanings associated with them. However, thorough ethnologists such as Lowie (1954: 156-161) have shown that among many, such as the Plains Indians, much of decorative art is named purely for the convenience of the craftsman or woman, and that names, and occasional symbolic meanings, vary from person to person.</page><page sequence="22">Pasztory: Still invisible 125 Figure 20a.

The border designs and the picture field do not and cannot intermingle. When ornament overwhelms the forms that give dimensional clues, as in the paintings of Gustave Klimt or in Russian icons, the effect of the real is diminished. The relegation of ornament to borders also creates a clear hierarchy of the naturalistic ?mage, seen as superior, in relation to the ornamental frame. Non-naturalistic traditions, by contrast, find freedom, variety, and excitement precisely in ornament, which they allow to move in and out of the central and privileged places of ?mage making. They thus create an imaginary world that is more unified and interconnected. Since recognizable forms, such as persons or trees, need not be composed according to projective rules of perspective, they can be reshaped, distorted, and adapted in a great variety of ways, while still maintaining the minimal clues that provide an identification.16 Since these recognizable forms are already usually highly stylized, they fit perfectly with the patterns of stepped frets, interlaces, zigzags, loops, chequerboards, braids, chevrons, and other geometric designs. 16. Gombrich's (1963:330-358) most interesting observations deal with the fact that an ?mage may be recognized and even considered "realistic" on the basis of very few lines and shapes. Such "minimal clues" must by definition be conceptual, even if they aim to evoke something real.</page><page sequence="23">126 RES 19/20 1990/1991 Figure 21.

Saul Steinberg's wonderful cartoon (in Gombrich, ibid.:194) (fig. 26) visually explores the contrast between naturalistic and abstract ?mage making and results in one of those visual contradictions that evokes laughter. In this cartoon, he put together a "scene" from stylized bits of ornament and renderings of birds, leaves, houses, and design elements that could be at home anywhere from manuscript illuminations to peasant textile embroideries. In the center of this "landscape" a flat, anthropomorphic feline waters a plant in the form of a stylized ornament with a three-dimensionally rendered watering can. It is the inappropriateness of the watering can in the scene that is funny, as well as the idea that an embroidery-style plant could need watering.17 17. In a conversation subsequent to the completion of this article, Saul Steinberg explained that the stylized designs in the work had been Steinberg's drawing evokes another dimension of ornament. His lively calligraphy suggests that ornament is the work-energy that has gone into the making of something beautiful and intricate. Although decorative designs in most traditions often have names, and sometimes limited symbolic meanings, a prime meaning of all ornament is to give a heightened sense of the important, the precious, the valuable, perhaps even the inaccessible, to whatever surface it is on. Ornament is also a clear sign that this is the imaginary realm of image making and not the visible world. There are no hidden cut out of typography boob to make up the houses, furrows, and plants. Besides the feline and the watering can, all the birds and the rabbit were drawn by pen. His intention had been to demonstrate that stylized designs, which derive originally from nature, can be turned back into nature by the artist who is capable of such a double vision.</page><page sequence="24">Pasztory: Still invisible 127 meanings or searches necessary beyond what is visible on the surface. Ornament may, therefore, be both exciting and restful. Most Teotihuacan mural paintings were in apartment compounds, usually on the walls of verandas where roofs protected them from rain and light from the open patios made them visible. Since large expanses of walls had to be covered, various compositional strategies were used. The most common is the repetition of a figure at intervals all along the wall, against a plain red background (fig. 27). Some walls were divided into a decorative trellis, like wallpaper, with figures inside each diamond. Like the net of the net jaguar, the trellis could be rendered as a dimensional design (Miller 1973: figs. 159-162). Multifigure scenes occur, but they are the exception rather than the rule. Doorways and walls are usually framed by ornamental borders of a great variety of designs (see figs. 15, 27). This discussion is not an attempt to show how "complex" these traditions are and thereby equate complexity with aesthetic worth. My aim is really descriptive ?neither praising nor diminishing any tradition. The discourse based on the traditions of Western naturalism and Western art and art history is not necessarily wrong, but it has cast a shadow that has made other traditions still invisible and incomprehensible. Although nearly a century of Modern art has educated artists and some art historians, many in other fields, including anthropology and archaeology, still deal with art in terms of a nineteenth-century realistic bias. As the conference at the Museum of Modern Art in association with the Primitivism exhibit indicated, specialists in Modern art also see non-Western art as in many ways simpler and aesthetically less challenging than Modern art. In removing the shadow cast by the European tradition, I hope that pre-Modern "conceptual" art, whether exotic or European, might be defined in terms of its own limitations and potentials. It was clear to me in trying to understand Teotihuacan art, that I needed to look at the art of other cultures. Now that the various local traditions of art are a matter of history in books and museums (and whatever new arts emerge will be global in nature) it may be possible to determine the laws and principles of past image-making based on cross-cultural comparison. A willingness to decontextualize works of art is essential to this task. It is hoped that this examination of Teotihuacan art will open a dialogue with scholars working on similar abstract traditions elsewhere in the world. My hypothetical conclusion, which is that such arts seem to combine three approaches that are Figure 23.

Clearly, the art of Teotihuacan represents only one possible mixing of these elements. I will conclude this discussion by going in the opposite direction and contextualizing Teotihuacan mural painting by a brief look at the specific archaeological situation. III. The Teotihuacan context: collective ideology and the individual Mapping of the ancient city began in 1962. This long term project, directed by Ren? Mill?n, has resulted in the first thorough cultural history of the site (Mill?n 1973). The monumental architecture of Teotihuacan began with the building of two huge pyramids around the time of Christ. At that time the city was laid out with a north south axis oriented 15?25' degrees east of true north. The scale of the city plan is overwhelming even in the modern era and must have been staggering in the local context of small chiefdoms and states. Teotihuacan was the first urban state in Mesoamerica. In its first phase, population was already 40,000 and at its height (a.D. 400-700) the population was estimated at 150,000</page><page sequence="25">128 RES 19/20 1990/1991 Figure 24a.

Teotihuacan was an irrigation civilization in the sense that the main staple, corn, was grown in irrigated fields. Agriculture, however, was of local importance only. There was not enough for great surpluses: the San Juan river is a brook in comparison with the Nile. What made Teotihuacan the largest and most important city in Mesoamerica for nearly 800 years is not known. Craft activities and trade ? in wares such as obsidian, a material necessary for cutting, which is available in mines near Teotihuacan, and in luxury goods, such as thin orange pottery ?have been suggested as explanations. What is striking about Teotihuacan is that there are no images of dynastic rulers, nor of conquests or prisoners, no scenes of investiture such as are common in Olmec, Maya, and Aztec art (Pasztory in press). So far no great burials with dazzling treasures have come to light. This is usually interpreted to mean that at Teotihuacan social integration was achieved through religion directly without the mediation of deified rulers who are nearly as great as the gods themselves. It would seem that at Teotihuacan political and religious rule was vested in the same persons, but they kept a low profile. The importance of religion is suggested by the size of the pyramids that were presumably temples, and by the small size of the representations of humans in relation to those of the gods, as in the Temple of Agriculture mural (fig. 28).

Unlike the named, individualized Maya rulers, all of these Teotihuacan elite individuals are shown in anonymous processions. Indeed, everything at Teotihuacan seems to have been done to depersonalize the appearance of religious and political power in human office holders. As described earlier, the gods are often faceless, the communicating and expressive aspect of their mouths hidden by large nose ornaments (see fig. 28). The introduction of mass production in the form of molds resulted in the standardization of objects such as clay figurines and incense burner ornaments after A.D. 300. Even the most prized greenstone masks look highly standardized (fig. 29). In view of all this the usual notion of Teotihuacan is of a rigid state controlling all aspects of the life of its citizens. The city itself was built on a grid plan, which too, would imply centralized control and order. While twentieth-century artistic discourse has validated tribal art and found in it individualistic creativity combined with a sense of community, the art of the early states such as Egypt, Mesopotamia, Mesoamerica, and Peru have been seen as authoritarian, if not totalitarian. While it is not my intention to discuss this issue in detail, it is relevant to the interpretation presented here. Standardization of some of the art of Teotihuacan has been seen as a denial of individuality and a curtailment of individual "creative" rights, rather than in any positive light, such as practicality, affordability, or community mindedness. There is as much evidence at Teotihuacan for state control as there is for individual freedom.18 18. Octavio Paz (1972:87) has decried the "sentimental identification" of Mexico with the pre-hispanic world. "Our art critics wax ecstatic about the statue of Coatlicue, an enormous block of petrified theology. Have they ever looked at it? Pedantry and heroism, sexual puritanism and ferocity, calculation and delirium: a people made up of warriors and priests, astrologers and ?mmolaters." William Rubin rather more coyly dismisses pre-Columbian "archaic" civilizations from his notion of Primitivism on the basis that they were "courtly" rather than tribal (1984a:74, n. 14 and p. 3). Vamedoe (1984:665-667), however, approaches the subject head on. Referring to the work of Michael Heizer and Robert Smithson he states: Their archeological imagery referred not to the creative handwork of tribal artists but to the vestiges of lost societies that embodied vast collective labor and ambitions to cosmic knowledge ... the admiration for vast collective feats (such as those of the mound builders, the people of Stonehenge, and the pre-Columbian societies</page><page sequence="28">Pasztory: Still invisible 131 Around A.D. 250, the relatively insubstantial original dwellings of the Teotihuacan population were torn down and masonry apartment compounds were built (fig. 30). These compounds were standardized in size, about 50 meters square, and housed a number of patrilocal families, 60 to 100 in a compound. The compound's internal plans were, however, all quite different, with ten to fifteen individual apartments consisting of rooms around patios. The apartment compounds have high walls, one or two entrances, and no windows. Presumably, when in their homes, the people of Teotihuacan spent much of their time in the sunny patios or on the shaded porches. The dark inner rooms must have been largely for storage and sleeping. In the dense concentration of the city, the apartment compound's plan appears to emphasize privacy and separation. A household temple is often built on one side of the central patio, and a shrine or altar may be located in its center. Mural paintings were primarily on the walls of the verandas facing the patios and courts. It is not known as yet whether mural paintings were found in most apartments or whether they were restricted to certain families either by caste entitlement or by wealth. Perhaps the most astonishing fact about Teotihuacan is that this art of mural painting and the apartment compounds in which it appeared did not belong to the rulers. Many of the buildings that have been designated as possible palaces and/or administrative structures lack murals, with a few exceptions. Nor are the murals usually found in temples (except for some early murals such as the so-called Temple of Agriculture murals). There is no difference in quality between murals in apartment compounds and room complexes near major temples, such as the so-called Palace of the Sun near the pyramid of the Sun. Between a.D. 500-750, mural paintings appear to have been mainly in the houses of what we might call the "upper middle class." The structuring of the city and of its arts tells us something not only about religion but about the nature of the community as well. Along with the denial of naturalism, portraiture, and a personality cult, there is an emphasis on the corporate nature of the city which is made up of separate, different, but, in many ways, similar units. There are approximately 2,000 apartment compounds, and, if they corresponded to social units, the heads of each could easily have made up some sort of political body. The exertion of so much labor in housing the general population in itself signifies a degree of commitment to the community as a whole, that is unique in Mesoamerican "complex" societies. A ritual object comes into use when the apartments are built, and because it has been found in the central patios or buried with the founder of the compound in several instances, it is presumed to be related to compound ritual. It is a very peculiar ceramic object, called the composite incense burner (fig. 31). The incense is burned in the flowerpot-shaped lower half and the smoke escapes through the chimney in the back of the upper half. It is more significant, however, when it is viewed as an expressive object rather than as a purely functional one. A mask is visible framed by flat pieces of clay; this suggests the glimpse of a deity through a temple doorway. The observer is distanced from the mask, literally by several layers of clay frames that appear to represent in three-dimensional fashion the spatial world of the murals. Small signs called adornos were made in molds and attached to the framework. The analysis of the clay has shown that the framework and the masks were sometimes made of different, better clay than the clay of the adornos that were glued on by stucco (Berlo 1982). The framework and the mask were reused evidently, while different combinations of adornos were made for different occasions, persons, and/or rituals.

Yet at the same time the model of Primitive societies, often in some of the same aspects, has equally been invoked as the source for artistic liberation and personal self fulfillment ... a concern with immediate private experience, especially seen as irrational, intuitive, and anti-authoritarian.</page><page sequence="29">132 RES 19/20 1990/1991 Figure 30.

The remains of archaeological cultures rarely afford such glimpses into the personal or individual relationship to society and religion as does the Teotihuacan incensario. As mentioned above, because of the rigid axial layout of the city and because of the religious subject matter, the tendency has been to see Teotihuacan as an authoritarian and theocratic place. This is reinforced by the flat, conceptual art style, which it is assumed connotes minds that are bent on higher matters than flesh and the earth. This bias is not unlike the usual "religious" interpretation of the entire art of the Middle Ages, despite evidence of the humorous and the playful in capitals and manuscript marginalia (Schapiro 1947).19 Although no texts survive from Teotihuacan to tell about the individuality of patrons and artists, some sense of that too can be gathered from the mural paintings themselves. 19. In this citation, Schapiro takes up the cause of medieval art by trying to link it with Modern art: The common view [is] that medieval art was strictly religious and symbolical, submitted to collective aims, and wholly free from the aestheticism and individualism of our age. I shall try to show that by the eleventh and twelfth centuries there had emerged in Western Europe within church art a new sphere of artistic creation without religious content and imbued with the values of spontaneity, individual fantasy, delight in color and movement, and the expression of feeling that anticipate modern art. (1947, p. V Playfulness, in the sense of a secular and possibly humorous creative inventiveness appears to be an integral part of Teotihuacan art. By extension, it must also have been a value for the citizens by and for whom it was made. Elaborate borders framing different sections of the wall are characteristic of Teotihuacan mural painting programs. When the murals are well preserved, it is apparent that these borders often combine themes from adjacent walls or from the various personages who are represented on the walls. Evidently, the design of the border called for some kind of creative fusion of the elements to provide transition from one field to another. In the case of a mural from Atetelco (fig. 32), which consists of a coyote and a net jaguar, the border is in the form of a serpentine creature made up of the intertwining body of a coyote and a net jaguar. The creature has a coyote head and net jaguar legs rhythmically disposed along the interlace. While coyote and net jaguar are standard beings of symbolic and allegorical significance and may represent animal aspects of certain deities, this particular creature ? serpent/ coyote/net jaguar ? is unique to this mural. It is unlikely to have been a separate creature with mythic reality, since no other representations of it have been found. It may have been the artist's way of bringing the two ?mages together into a new design and a new conceit. Whatever their verbal description for this might have</page><page sequence="30">Pasztory: Still invisible 133 been, whether they saw it ?n terms of form or subject, symbol, or humor, ?t ?s easy to imagine the compound headman and the artist delighting in this inventive solution to the border problem.20 This brings the discussion full circle back to Albrecht D?rer and Henry Moore, who used the word "inventiveness" to describe pre-Columbian art. Inventiveness is also William Rubin's favorite term for both tribal and Modern art, although he will not accept it for "court" or "ancient archaic" art, which he considers excessively "static."21 Perhaps the post-Modern viewer has an easier time seeing inventiveness in the art of early states. Inventiveness may be, in fact, the key word in this paper, and perhaps better than Gombrich's term, "conceptual." The term "inventive" emphasizes the active making of something new, whereas emphasis on the "conceptual" is on rigid sch?mas in the mind that act as censors. I suggest that the "conceptual" arts defined by Summers and Schapiro are characterized not only by the importance of placement and hierarchy, but also by a protean compositional mode in which an image can be condensed into what is almost a glyph, or expanded towards various types of elaborations and complexities such as scenes and decorative arrangements. Even in the most non-mimetic traditions, the artist is always aware of the spatial problems created by the transformation of three-dimensional reality into two-dimensional images, and uses this awareness in various ways as he composes figures in depth and creates scenes. The principles governing such art are not only, or even necessarily, clarity but the communication of multivalent messages, contradictory presences and absences, visual puns, and many other types of ambiguities. It is mimetic art that is, by comparison, all too clear in the moment, mood, and point of view represented. Non-mimetic arts represent imaginary worlds in which different kinds of things are possible that are impossible in the real world. The term "imaginary" may be opposed to "mimetic" in a way that is less prejudicial to both. In imaginary traditions a decorative matrix is usually devised in which signs and ?mages can be located together and can oscillate between reality and symbol, evoking meanings that range from the profound to the amusing. In mimetic traditions the matrix is a ground-sky convention into which things and figures are placed in arrangements that convey the illusion of a visible world. Because imaginary artistic traditions require such a thorough familiarity with an arbitrary ?mage system, as well as a willingness to enter into the serious game of image-reading, I suggest that the socio-political contexts of such traditions are likely to be either small in scale or highly integrated and in some ways closely knit, or societies that for various reasons are not concerned with communicating with cultural outsiders or "others." These Figure 31. Composite Ceramic Censer. Clay with traces of paint. Teotihuacan Site Museum storeroom. Photo: Esther Pasztory. 20. The deployment of artistic "play" more for its own sake than at the task of expressing something of great collective importance is also found in the "margins" of medieval art. We might consider a great amount of Islamic art as the riot of playful ornament takes center stage, since the important subjects are not represented at all. Ornament in that context represents not only joyful decoration, but the absence of deeply meaningful subjects. In Islamic art, ornament becomes a total screen. 21. The invention just mentioned, which led in some African and Oceanic societies to an often-astonishing artistic multiformity, constitutes one of the most important common denominators of tribal and modern art. Few remaining sculptures of the Dan people ... are much more than a century old; yet the range of invention found in their work far outdistances that of court arts produced over much longer periods, even millenia. (Rubin 1984a:3).</page><page sequence="31">134 RES 19/20 1990/1991 arts are in some ways the opposite of advertising: they intrigue and even challenge, but they do not seduce. Even Modernism, with its elitist avant-garde, supplies these criteria of an educated and exclusive circle of artists and patrons opposed to a mass culture that is largely involved with realistic modes of representation.22 22. The conflict between the office workers and Richard Serra over his abstract sculpture, T/7ted Arc, demonstrates these mutually antagonistic ?mage systems in our own times. In 1979, the General Service Administration commissioned a large public sculpture from Richard Serra. The work Serra produced, titled T/7ted Arc, was a plain, inward-leaning rusted steel band, 60.96 m long and 3.65 m high, which bisected a sunken circular plaza in front of Lower Manhattan's Federal complex. Complaints by Federal Plaza employees that Serra's sculpture was threatening, obstructive, and ugly led to public hearings on the question of its removal. Well-known figures in the art community spoke on Serra's behalf. The defense included the argument that Serra's use of industrial steel was a deliberate gesture of solidarity with the working class and that the abstract sculpture radically (and positively) reconfigured an institutional space ? that is to say, that the work was an implicitly political statement and that its removal constituted censorship. Tilted Arc was finally dismantled and removed on 15 March 1989 (Storr 1985, Serra 1989). Figure 32.
