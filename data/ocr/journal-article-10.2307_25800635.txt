<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of World Prehistory, Vol. 7, No. 3, 1993 Cultures of the Eighth and Seventh Millennia BP in the Southern Levant: A Review for the 1990s Avi Gopher1,2 and Ram Gophna1 The Pottery Neolithic of the southern Levant (the eighth and seventh millennia BP) was a crucial period in which the foundations were laid for the development of complex societies and urban civilization. This article summarizes the current state of research in this area during this period. Past and present research in Israel and Jordan is reviewed, and methodological problems in fieldwork and analysis are discussed. We attempt a systematic definition of the archaeological entities. For each such entity, we present the available data on chronostratig raphy, characteristics of the material culture (including lithics, ceramics and architecture), burial customs, figurines and images, economy, and site-distri bution. While the Yarmukian and Jericho IX occupied territories of similar size and seem to represent entities on the scale of a "culture, " the later Wadi Raba entity extended over a larger area and was of longer duration. A chrono stratigraphic summary is presented, and the major entities are compared in terms of site-types, economy, burials, and geographical distribution. KEY WORDS: Pottery Neolithic; southern Levant; Yarmukian; Jericho IX; Wadi Raba. INTRODUCTION Compared with the wealth of information on the southern Levantine Pre Pottery Neolithic, especially in the ninth millennium BP (all dates used here are uncalibrated radiocarbon years) (Mellaart, 1975; Moore, 1982, 1985; Bar-Yosef, 1981; Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen, 1989; Gopher, 1989c; Rollefson, 1989a) and the Chalcolithic cultures of the sixth millennium BP (de Vaux, 1966; Levy, 1986, 1987; Gilead, 1988), there are very few syntheses of the Pottery Neolithic 'Institute of Archaeology, Tel Aviv University, Ramat Aviv 69978, Israel. 2To whom correspondence should be addressed. 297 0892-7537/93/0900-0297S07.00/0 ? 1993 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">298 Gopher and Gophna of the eighth and seventh millennia BP. This period has not been investigated in detail, perhaps because it is too late for the Paleolithic and too early for Biblical archaeology (the Bronze and Iron Ages), the two main foci of interest. There are today sufficient data to document the "collapse" of the pan Levantine Pre-Pottery Neolithic system, which reached its apex in the ninth millennium BP (Rollefson and Kohler-Rollefson, 1989; Rollefson, 1989b, 1990a). It is widely accepted that very different socioeconomic systems appeared in the southern Levant during the eighth and seventh millennia and laid the foundation for the development of complex, urban societies. The aim of this article is to survey the state of research on the eighth and seventh millennia BP and to point out unresolved questions. We also propose a chronocultural frame work to describe the relationships among the major archaeological entities in the southern Levant (Fig. 1). History of Research The cultural sequence of the eighth and seventh millennia BP in the Levant was outlined from the late 1920s on, based on stratified tells such as Jericho (Garstang, 1935, 1936; Garstang and Garstang, 1940), Byblos (Dunand, 1973) and, in the northern Levant, Ras Shamra (Schaffer, 1948, 1961; de Contenson, 1963) and the Amuq sites (Braidwood and Braidwood, 1960). Other major sites in the southern Levant were Ghassul (Mallon et al., 1934), the Besor (Wadi Ghazzeh) sites (MacDonald, 1932), Megiddo (Shipton, 1939), and Bethshean (Fitzgerald, 1934, 1935). The principal scholars involved were the site exca vators and Albright (1943) and Wright (1937). Pottery-bearing prehistoric en tities were named after particular strata, such as "Jericho IX," "Jericho VIII," "Byblos Neolithique ancien" (NA), "Byblos Neolithique moyen" (NM), "Amuq A," "Amuq B," etc. In the 1950s, after work at Shaar Hagolan, the "Yarmukian culture" was defined as a distinct entity (Stekelis, 1950-1951). In the early 1950s, the "Wadi Raba culture" was identified by Kaplan based on excavations at Tel Aviv (Kaplan, 1958c), Wadi Raba (Kaplan, 1958a), and Teluliot Batashi (Kaplan, 1958b). Both Kaplan's and Stekelis's definitions were based primarily on char acteristic ceramic assemblages, mobile art (clay and stone figurines), flimsy architectural remains, and flaked and ground-stone assemblages. These cultures were placed within the chronostratigraphic sequence by comparison with the sequences from Jericho, Ghassul, Byblos, Ras Shamra, the Amuq sites, and even Mesopotamia and Anatolia. Jericho was reexcavated in the 1950s and Kenyon (1957, 1960, 1970) coined the terms "Pre-Pottery Neolithic A and B" and "Pottery Neolithic A and B" (hereafter PPNA, PPNB, PNA, and PNB), which became household words among those dealing with these periods. Kenyon's PNA parallels Gar</page><page sequence="3">Pottery Neolithic in the Southern Levant 299 Fig. 1. Map showing the regions and wadi systems mentioned in the text.</page><page sequence="4">300 Gopher and Gophna stang's Layer IX, and her PNB is related to Garstang's Layer VIII. The very few Yarmukian sites excavated in the 1950s include Rehov Habashan in Tel Aviv (Kaplan, 1958c, 1970, 1978). Jericho IX/PNA was excavated at Lod, Teluliot Batashi (Kaplan, 1958b, 1977) and, perhaps, at Tel Ali (Prausnitz, 1957, 1960, 1961, 1970b, p. 157, 1975). Wadi Raba material was excavated at Tel Ali (Prausnitz, 1960, 1970b) and sites tested east of the Jordan, such as Tell esh-Shuneh and Tell Abu-Habil (de Contenson, 1960). Ghrubba (Mellaart, 1956) yielded a peculiar assemblage, which caused much confusion (Kirkbride, 1971; Gopher and Greenberg, 1987). Attempts to summarize the available data were made by Kaplan (1960) and de Vaux (1966). In the 1960s, PN layers were excavated at Kfar Giladi, Hamadiya, Ein el Jarba (Kaplan, 1965a, b, 1966, 1969), Kabri (Prausnitz, 1959, 1969), and Tel Abu Zureiq (Anati et al., 1973). The stratigraphy of the large-scale excavation at Munhata in the Jordan Valley (Perrot, 1964, 1965, 1966a, b, 1967, 1968; Gopher, 1989a; Garfinkel, 1992) placed the Yarmukian culture ("Shaar Hagolan phase") as the earliest in the pottery-bearing sequence. The Yarmukian was overlain by the intermediate "Munhata phase" and then by Wadi Raba culture (Perrot's "Wadi Raba phase"). Based on the Munhata sequence, Perrot recon structed a developmental sequence that was directly influenced by events occur ring in the northern and eastern Levant. In the Beqqa Valley (Lebanon), a few eighth and seventh millennium layers were excavated, including Ard Tlaili, Neba Fauor, and Labweh (Kirkbride, 1969; Copeland, 1969). There was little fieldwork from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s. Small scale excavations took place on the coastal plain at Nizzanim (Yeivin and Olami, 1979), Givat Haparsa (Olami et al., 1977), Herzliya (Prausnitz et al, 1970), Newe Yam (Wreschner, 1977; Prausnitz, 1977), and Qatif Y-3 (Epstein, 1984). Reports of earlier excavations such as Shaar Hagolan (Stekelis, 1966, 1972), Byblos (Cauvin, 1968; Dunand, 1973), and Ein el Jarba (Kaplan, 1969) were published, as well as several summaries (Perrot, 1968; Kirkbride, 1971; Moore, 1973; Noy, 1976, 1977; Gophna, 1982). These were later placed in a wider context by Moore (1978, 1982, 1985), while a major synthesis by Mellaart (1975) incorporated the Levantine Neolithic into a Near Eastern perspective. In the 1980s, a new chapter of investigations began. Yarmukian sites in Jordan revealed architectural features, such as at Ain Ghazal (Rollefson and Simmons, 1986, 1988; Rollefson et al., 1991; Kafafi, 1990b; Kafafi et al., 1990; Simmons et al., 1988), Jebel Abu Thawwab (Kafafi, 1985a, b, 1986, 1988), and Ain Rahub (Muheisen et al., 1988; Kafafi, 1990a). A summary of the Neolithic period in Jordan was recently published by Kafafi (1987), in which he used the terminology of Moore (1973, 1982). In Israel, PN was excavated at Tel Tsaf (Gophna, 1979; Gophna and Sadeh, 1988-1989), Tel Qiri (Baruch, 1987), Jarba B (Meyerhof, 1982) and a nearby</page><page sequence="5">Pottery Neolithic in the Southern Levant 301 unnamed site (Meyerhof, personal communication, 1991), Nahal Betzet I (Gopher, 1989b; Gopher et aL, 1992), Nahal Zehora I and II (Gopher and Orrelle, 1990; Gopher, 1991), Nahal Qanah Cave (Gopher et aL, 1990; Gopher and Tsuk, 19?1), Tel Dan (Gopher and Greenberg, 1987), and Kabri (Shefte lovitz, personal communication, 1992). Submerged sites of this period were surveyed and tested off the Carmel coast (Galili and Weinstein-Evron, 1985; Galili, 1987; Galili et aL, 1993). PN layers were also exposed at Tel Teo in the Huleh Valley (Eisenberg, 1986), at Yiftahel in the Lower Galilee (Braun, 1984, 1985, 1986), and at Horvat Usa in the upper Galilee (Getzov, personal communication, 1992). Excavations were recently renewed at Shaar Hagolan and Tel Ali by Garfinkel (1991a, b, 1992). In southern Israel, excavations were conducted at Qatif Y-3 (Epstein, 1984), in several pre-Chalcolithic occupations in Nahal Besor (Gilead and Alon, 1988), and in aceramic strata dated to the eighth and seventh millennia in Nahal Issaron (Goring-Morris and Gopher, 1983), in Qadesh Bamea 3 (Bar-Yosef, 1980), and at Biqaat Uvda (Zass, 1980). After these excavations and the final reports on Jericho (Kenyon, 1981; Kenyon and Holland, 1982, 1983) and the flaked stone (Gopher, 1989a) and ceramics from Munhata (Garfinkel, 1992), we knew considerably more, but Jericho IX, the "Munhata phase," and the "Ghrubba phase" remained prob lematical. In the 1980s, definitions were suggested for regional or temporal entities, such as the "Proto-Ghassulian" in central Israel (cf. Meyerhof, 1982) and the Qatifian and Besorian in southern Israel (Gilead and Alon, 1988; Gilead, 1990; Goren, 1990). Rollefson proposed that the PPN lasted into the first half of the eighth millennium BP in what he called the PPNC (Rollefson and Sim mons, 1986; Simmons et aL, 1988; Rollefson et aL, 1992). Despite all the effort noted above, reconstruction of the PN framework in the southern Levant remains difficult, because of inadequate publication, poor techniques of excavation and analysis, and the scarcity of organic remains and radiometric dates. METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS Field Methodology Neolithic sites of the eighth and seventh millennia BP may be 1-2 ha in area and contain many pits, as well as dwelling stmctures, which result in the mixing of assemblages. It is desirable to open large horizontal areas in order to understand intrasite structure, but doing this with the techniques used on Paleo lithic sites is especially difficult, since the Neolithic strata are often deeply buried under multicomponent tell sites. On the other hand, excavating Neolithic sites with the techniques typical at Biblical sites (as has often been done) results in</page><page sequence="6">302 Gopher and Gophna a considerable loss of data. This period thus falls between two stools in terms of field methods, and which method is chosen is important in determining the results of the excavation. Excavations of PN sites in our region have had two major limitations. First, the grid units (which were not used at all in Israel until the late 1950s) and context definitions are too large to permit detailed analysis of intrasite variability. This limits our reconstruction of social structure and of behavior through the study of households, activity areas, communal areas, etc. Second, excavated sediments were rarely sieved in the past, causing major problems for quantitative analysis. This has improved recently but is still not universal. Flo tation, for example, is very infrequent, thus limiting the potential for both ra diocarbon dating and reconstruction of the economy. Thus, excavations of PN sites are limited either in scale or in level of recovery, resulting in poor spatial control and the loss of important data. Assemblages are very rarely contextually secure, and it is sometimes impossible to assign them to taxonomically ordered and quantitatively defined archaeological units (cf. Clarke, 1978). Analysis The many terminologies for archaeological entities of the eighth and sev enth millennia BP are plagued by low-level systematics or, in Clarke's (1978, pp. 26-30) terms, value judgments, nonspecific generalizations, and ambiguities in their definitions. It is often unclear whether a term refers to a time unit, a cultural unit, or a spatial unit. Names have been assigned to clusters of assem blages that may be similar and distinctive (such as the Yarmukian) and, some times, to clusters with a much lower level of cohesion. The chaos is compounded by the use of terms such as "culture," "subculture," "assemblage," "tradi tion," and "complex" for similar archaeological phenomena. These anomalies result from insufficient research, a large body of unpublished data, and the many small assemblages coming from problematical contexts. Earlier, nonquantitative research also hampers the application of systematics to such a range and scale of different entities. Additional problems in time-space systematics are the use of long-distance typological, but nonquantitative, comparisons, mainly of ceramic traits (e.g., Kaplan, 1960), and the neglect of seriation and the study of diffusion processes. These result in distortions in both chronological and geographical assessments. The complex events which took place in the eighth and seventh millennia BP in the Levant demand appropriate treatment at a more advanced level. The archaeological units must be ordered in a systematic hierarchy, which places entities at a level appropriate to the scale of the phenomenon and the stage of social organization. To attempt this, we use Clarke's (1978, pp. 299-300) term "archaeological culture," which is "an entity of high information content and</page><page sequence="7">Pottery Neolithic in the Southern Levant 303 specific to a socio-cultural system." Since we limit ourselves to basic consid erations and because of the problematic nature of the data, our operative defi nition of a culture follows Renfrew (1972, p. 19) as a "constantly recurring assemblage of artifacts ..." in a definable space/time framework. Aspects of environment, economy, demography, religion, and ideology are also included. However, for the eighth and seventh millennia BP, the data are not adequate to meet either Clarke's or Renfrew's criteria: the almost complete absence of ra diocarbon dates and the contextual and stratigraphic problems prevent accurate mfeasurement of time spans; the low number of excavated sites (as opposed to reported find spots) hampers the geographical definition of each entity; and it is very hard to find repetition in elements of material culture since very few quan titative data are available. In spite of this, we have attempted to place the available data in a chronocultural and geographic framework which, we hope, fits the nature and complexity of the period. We use the smallest homogeneous cultural units (with as limited a geo graphical range as possible, with a short time span, and with assemblages which are both qualitatively and quantitatively repetitive) as a starting point for the reconstruction of larger regional scale units. Two points must be remembered: first, that this is not a goal in itself but, rather, a means of improving our ability to reconstruct, interpret, and explain the cultural processes that operated in the area at this time and, second, that the data now available can support such an attempt and that only the systematic arrangement of the data will allow research to progress and specific problems to be isolated. OBSERVATIONS ON THE "GREAT NEOLITHIC GAP" The high degree of integration of PPNB populations and cultures in the Levant has been recognized since the mid-1970s (Mellaart, 1975; Cauvin, 1978; Moore, 1978, 1982; Gopher, 1985, 1989c, 1993). The PPNB interaction sphere was recently discussed by Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen (1989). The interaction sphere affected all areas of life by way of intense cultural contacts expressed on social, economic, and demographic levels. Networks of trade, information exchange, and, most probably, gene exchange operated efficiently throughout the Levant. At the very end of the ninth millennium BP, these networks appar ently ceased to function and the system that had operated for some 2000 years, during which the agricultural revolution was implemented, is no longer apparent. There has been very little discussion of this process and its mechanisms (Rol lefson and Kohler-Rollefson, 1989; Rollefson, 1989a, b, 1990a). It has been suggested that the main reason for the change was a hotter and drier climate, which affected the subsistence system. It was thought that there was a hiatus of a millennium or more after the PPNB in the southern Levant (de Vaux, 1966; Perrot, 1968; Moore, 1973; Kenyon, 1970). It has been proposed that the dry</page><page sequence="8">304 Gopher and Gophna areas were abandoned and the population moved to more northerly parts of the Levant; the establishment of new sites in northern Israel and on the Lebanese and Syrian coast are presented as part of this migration into more humid areas. Mellaart (1975, pp. 67-69) accepted this general scenario but suggested that the reaction to climatic change in the southern Levant took the form of adoption of seminomadic pastoralism. He accepted that there was a gap in settlement but thought it lasted only 500 years and ended with the appearance of pottery producing groups in the southern Levant and the reestablishment of new settle ments. One of the basic problems with the alleged gap has been the poor chro nology, based on old 14C dates from Byblos. Today, it is clear that Byblos was founded around 7700 BP or perhaps a little earlier (Mellaart, 1975; Moore, 1978, 1982; Gopher, 1985). Similar or slightly earlier dates are known from Tell Ramad and there are now dates in the first half of the eighth millennium from the PPNC layer at Ain Ghazal, the Yarmukian of Ain Rahub, and Atlit Yam (Table I). Eighth millennium dates are also available from Munhata and Sefunim, although these are problematical, and from submerged sites off the Carmel Coast (Table I). In the desertic areas also, there were eighth millennium settlements both in the Transjordanian desert and in the Negev and Sinai (Table I). In the 1970s and 1980s, the "1000-year gap" shrank and the climatic basis for its existence became less tenable (Rollefson and Kohler-Rollefson, 1989; Rollefson, 1990a). In his review of the Levantine Neolithic, Moore states that the gap was only a few centuries long and involved only a reduction in settlement intensity (Moore, 1978, p. 379). One of the main reasons recently offered for the gap was significant population growth during the PPNB and environmental degradation as a result of uncontrolled exploitation (Rollefson and Kohler-Rol lefson, 1989; Rollefson, 1990a). The "large gap" problem resulted from inadequate research and exagger ations, and is not a problem of prehistoric continuity. Whether there was climatic change at the end of the ninth millennium and beginning of the eighth is still in dispute (Goldberg and Rosen, 1987, Fig. 2.1). However, a decrease in the extent and intensity of settlement is evident at this time in the Negev and Sinai. The association of a hiatus and cultural crisis, accompanied by large-scale pop ulation migration, was apparently etched deep in the attitudes of archaeologists concerning the means by which populations adapted in the region. THE PPNC: A NEW PREPOTTERY NEOLITHIC CHAPTER At Ain Ghazal in Jordan, in clear stratigraphic context above the PPNB and below the Yarmukian, Rollefson discovered a unit that was named PPNC (Rollefson and Simmons, 1986).

The excavators estimated that the PPNC falls at the very end of the ninth millennium and the first half of the eighth millennium BP (Rollefson, 1989a, b).* Rollefson has laid out his arguments to justify the new PPN unit in several recent publications (Rollefson, 1989a, b, 1990b; Rollefson et al, 1992) and has also discussed at length the collapse of PPNB and its influence on the new facies (Rollefson and Kohler Rollefson, 1989; Rollefson, 1990a). The PPNC of Ain Ghazal differs from the PPNB in several aspects: the nature of the settlement, architecture, typology and technology of the flaked stone industry, economy and social organization, burial traditions, and ritual and ceremonial paraphernalia. Rollefson sees the changes in Ain Ghazal as a continuous process against a background of minor climatic fluctuations and environmental disturbance by human overexploitation. He believes that the pop ulation adjusted to a new social and economic system, in the framework of which he defines Ain Ghazal as a "fluctuating population centre" (Rollefson and Kohler-Rollefson, 1989, p. 85). Despite stress, the settlement grew in the PPNC, but the population was now supported by seasonal movement based on *A series of additional PPNC radiocarbon dates was recently published (Rollefson et al., 1992) which corresponds well with that estimation.</page><page sequence="11">Pottery Neolithic in the Southern Levant 307 livestock exploitation and an economy with a greater emphasis on livestock and less on cereal agriculture. Rollefson's arguments reflect one of the options offered by Mellaart (1975) to explain the change in subsistence and economy as the late PPN populations adapted to new conditions: that some populations chose not to emigrate to Mediterranean vegetational regions in the northern and western parts of the southern Levant. Such emigration would not, in any case, have been easy, since other groups were already established there. In light of Rollefson's suggestions, we can reconsider the data from sites such as Atlit Yam (Galili, 1987; Galili et aL, 1993) and Tel Ramad (de Con tenson, 1971). [Another PPNC occurrence, in stratigraphic context, was recently uncovered by Garfinkel (cf. Wolff, 1991, p. 496) in Tel Ali (Garfinkel, 1992).] Atlit Yam is a single-component site dated between 8100 and 7600 BP and reflects an adaptation different from that of the PPNB and based on intensive marine activities, including fishing in shallow and deep waters, cereal and le gume agriculture, and inland hunting (Galili et aL, 1993). No domesticated animals were originally reported (Horwitz and Tchemov, 1987), but it now appears that domesticates are present (Horwitz, personal communication, 1991). Moore (1978, p. 359) suggested that Tel Ramad was occupied at the begin ning of the eighth millennium BP. He claims that his Neolithic stage 2 continued in Tel Ramad Level II up to 78-7700 BP and his Neolithic 3 (in our terms, PN) began in Level III. The latter is similar to By bios NA and continued up until 7500 BP. Moore, like Rollef son some 10 years later, hinted at a PPN unit in the early centuries of the eighth millennium. We believe that the pottery of Tell Ramad (de Contenson, 1971) must be later than is suggested by the dates for the site. Ain Ghazal suggests that PPNC represents an integration of settled village agriculture (of PPNB origin) with a flexible new system of animal-exploitation (pastoralism?). If so, it had significant repercussions on settlement patterns, population density, and relationships with the richer Mediterranean zones. It is thus possible that when the PPNB system ceased to function in the late ninth millennium, as the result of environmental stress caused by both climatic and anthropogenic factors, the southern Levant saw the development of a variety of new subsistence strategies based on regional and local adaptations. However, it is still hard to characterize cultural entities within the PPNC, since we still have no clear geographical parameters, no details on material culture or behavioral patterns, or even a well-established chronology. THE YARMUKIAN: THE EARLIEST POTTERY IN THE SOUTHERN LEVANT Although Yarmukian pottery and flint tools were found in Megiddo in the 1930s (Layer XX; Shipton, 1939), they were not recognized as representing a separate cultural entity. The Yarmukian was defined by Stekelis after his 1949</page><page sequence="12">308 Gopher and Gophna 1951 excavation of Shaar Hagolan, mainly by the unique assemblages of ceramic vessels, and stone and clay figurines (Stekelis, 1972). Stekelis's suggestion that the Yarmukian parallels the Byblos NA layer was a major innovation in terms of relative chronology and meant that Yarmukian pottery is the earliest known pottery in our region. This led to a bitter argument with Kaplan, who saw Jericho IX as the earliest ceramic entity in Israel (e.g., Kaplan, 1977). Kaplan made small excavations in other Yarmukian layers in the 1950s (Kaplan, 1958c, 1970, 1978) and 1960s (Kaplan, 1965a, b, 1976) and others recorded isolated occurrences. In the early 1960s, Perrot exposed the Yarmukian Layer 2B in Munhata on a larger scale. Subsequently, the chronostratigraphy of the Yarmukian was clarified and the first faunal assemblage was analyzed (Ducos, 1968, 1969). In the early 1980s, work at Ain Ghazal, Jebel Abu Thawwab, Ain Rahub, and Wadi Shu'eib in Jordan marked a new stage of research. Yarmukian was excavated in Nahal Qanah; renewed excavations have taken place in Shaar Hagolan and Yarmukian was found at Nahal Zehora II on the southern fringes of the Jezreel Valley (Gopher and Orrelle, 1991). Chronostratigraphy In good stratigraphic contexts, the Yarmukian lies above PPN, as at Ain Ghazal, where it is immediately above the PPNC; at Munhata, where Layer 2B is above a PPNB layer after a gap of unknown duration; and at Wadi Shu'eib (Simmons et al., 1989). Layers in good stratigraphic context above the Yar mukian are assigned either to the Wadi Raba entity, as at Habashan Street in Tel Aviv and perhaps at Wadi Raba, or to an undefined pre-Wadi Raba entity called, for example, "the Munhata phase" in Munhata (Perrot, 1968). The very few dates for the Yarmukian include one from Ein Rahub, two recently obtained from the Nahal Qanah cave and possibly two dates from Munhata (Table I). There are no dates available for the Yarmukian of Ain Ghazal. For purposes of comparison, the Byblos NA dates fall within the second half of the eighth millennium and perhaps slightly earlier. Lithics Technologically, there was still a high standard of blade production, and bipolar cores are still present, although less common (Stekelis, 1966, Fig. 35 37). The debitage, however, is dominated by flakes. The tools include sickle blades, arrowheads, axes, bifacial knives, awls/borers, scrapers, notches and denticulates, and numerous retouched flakes and blades (Figs. 2 and 3). The main innovations are the appearance of distinct subtypes of the Byblos and Amuq points and new types of small arrowheads called Haparsa and Herzliya points (Bar-Yosef, 1981; Gopher, 1989c); new types of coarsely denticulated, bifa</page><page sequence="13">Pottery Neolithic in the Southern Levant 309 Fig. 2. Yarmukian sickle blades, arrowheads, and awl-borers from Shaar Hagolan (after Stekelis, 1966).</page><page sequence="14">310 Gopher and Gophna Fig. 3. Yarmukian bifacial tools, endscrapers, burins, and a core from Shaar Hagolan (after Stekelis, 1966).</page><page sequence="15">Pottery Neolithic in the Southern Levant 311 dally retouched sickle blades; bifacial knives; and low numbers of prototabular scrapers (scrapers made on tabular flint, forerunners of Chalcolithic fan-scrap ers). Arrowheads and sickle blades may be used for sedation. The trends in arrowhead forms indicate that Shaar Hagolan is earlier than Munhata Layer 2B (Gopher, 1985, 1989a, c). The former is very similar in composition to the Byblos NA assemblage (Gopher, 1989a, pp. 144-145). Type frequencies of sickle blades again indicate that Shaar Hagolan is earlier than Munhata 2B and show the marked resemblance to Byblos NA (Gopher, 1989a, pp. 145-147). The small sickle blade sample from Nahal Qanah Cave is very late in the Yarmukian sequence, which accords well with the radiocarbon dates (Table I). Pottery Yarmukian ceramics have certain distinctive traits, mainly in form and decoration. Types include bowls of various sizes, including short pedestalled bowls, chalices, platter-basins, necked jars, and hole-mouth jars (Figs. 4 and 5). Bases are usually flat or sometimes pedestalled, and handles include knobs, ledge handles, and small loop handles placed between the rim and the shoulder. Decoration includes triangular, red-painted fields separated by reserve bands delimited by two incised lines with an incised herringbone pattern between them. Some items have painted decorations without incisions, as at Nahal Qanah Cave and Munhata 2B. The appearance of vessels with painted decoration but no incisions in the Yarmukian is worthy of note, and it is perhaps significant that they appear in Munhata and Nahal Qanah, both late in the Yarmukian sequence. Yarmukian assemblages also include a large proportion of undecprated items, which are rarely emphasized in most reports. Architecture Both circular and rectilinear buildings occur in the Yarmukian. In Munhata 2B, there was a circular, dry-stone structure and many pits (Gopher, 1989a, pp. 9, 77). At Shaar Hagolan, Stekelis's excavation revealed round hut-bases, a rectangular hut, and a cairn with a burial beneath it; additional rectangular stone structures were exposed by Garfinkel (1991a, p. Ill, Fig. 100, 1992). At Hama diya, a hut was constructed in a natural basin (Kaplan, 1965b, 1976). Similar use of natural bedrock depressions is indicated for the Yarmukian occupation at Nahal Zehora II. In Transjordan, both rectilinear and circular structures were exposed at Jebel Abu Thawwab (Kafafi, 1985b, 1988). At Ain Ghazal, the Yarmukian layer revealed large, rectilinear, stone houses, as well as "apsoidal" and "semiapsoidal" houses (Rollefson et aL, 1991, 1992). In summary, Yarmukian structures had stone foundations, plaster was used</page><page sequence="16">312 Gopher and Gophna Fig. 4. Yarmukian bowls, kraters, holemouth jar, and a platter from Nahal Qanah Cave. occasionally, but it is not yet clear whether mudbrick was used. Sites also contain pits of various sizes. In By bios NA, the tradition continued of rectan gular buildings with lime-plaster floors. Burial Customs Very few burials have been exposed in Yarmukian levels. At Shaar Hago lan, one lay under a cairn (Stekelis, 1972); a flexed burial was found in a pit at Munhata 2B (Perrot, 1968); and one burial was found in Rehov Habashan</page><page sequence="17">Pottery Neolithic in the Southern Levant Fig. 5. Yarmukian jars from Nahal Qanah Cave.</page><page sequence="18">314 Gopher and Gophna (Kaplan, 1970, 1978), but none at Ain Ghazal. At Wadi Sh'ueib there are two burials from the PN levels but it is not clear whether they are with the Yarmukian or Jericho IX (Simmons et aL, 1989): one is a child, flexed and lacking a cranium, in a circle of stones, reminiscent of Byblos NA, below a mud floor; the other, a secondary burial of an adult, was close to the child and also lacked a cranium. At Byblos NA, infants were buried in ceramic jars, children were buried flexed in cradle-like devices probably with grave-goods that include pot tery and bone tools, and adults were usually buried flexed, on their sides, in single graves without grave-goods. A cluster of adult skulls was buried in a rectangular basin. Figurines Rich assemblages of images have been found in the middle Jordan Valley sites (Shaar Hagolan, Munhata) and smaller numbers at Ain Ghazal and Jebel Abu Thawwab. The Shaar Hagolan and Munhata assemblages include incised stone pebbles with anthropomorphic images and body parts. Clay figurines are usually interpreted as representations of women associated with fertility or other rituals (Yeivin and Mozel, 1977; Garfinkel, 1992). At Shaar Hagolan, most of these items were not excavated but collected from the surface. However, their presence in the excavation as well reinforces their inclusion in this assemblage. Similar items appear in other Yarmukian contexts, such as Hamadiya (Kaplan, 1970, 1976), Rehov Habashan (Kaplan, 1970, 1978), and Tel Qishon (Amon and Amiran, 1981; Rot, 1976), but are rare. At Byblos, the incised pebble figurines were associated with a few specimens made of clay (Dunand, 1973). Economy The known Yarmukian fauna is mostly from Ain Ghazal, where the assem blage included 71% domestic sheep and goat, 11% pig, 9% cattle, and 6% gazelle, showing an economic shift from PPNB faunas (Simmons et aL, 1988; Kohler-Rollefsonera/., 1988; Kohler-Rollefson, 1989). The Jebel Abu Thawwab fauna included 68% domestic sheep and goat, 13% cattle, and 15% gazelle; pig was represented by a single individual. At Munhata, Ducos's (1968) iden tified 55% sheep and goat, 20% cattle, and 22% pigs in Layer 2B but insisted on their nondomestic status. Plant remains from Ain Ghazal included wheat, barley, lentils, and peas in the Yarmukian (Simmons et aL, 1988). At Jebel Abu Thawwab, emmer wheat and two-row wheat were identified as well as lentil, pea, and, most probably, pistachio (Kafafi, 1988). The Ain Rahub plants included emmer wheat, two-row barley, and flax (Muheisen et aL, 1988).</page><page sequence="19">Pottery Neolithic in the Southern Levant 315 Site Distribution (Fig. 6) Jordan Valley. Sites are dense where the River Yarmuk meets the Jordan, indicating that the Jordan was not a barrier. No Yarmukian finds are known from north of Lake Tiberias but are reported south of the Yarmuk-Jordan con fluence and the Beth Shean Valley?for example, near Tell es-Saidiyeh (Glueck, 1951, PL 149: 9-10) and at Murabbat in the Judean desert (Benoit etal., 1961). The problem of Jericho PNA remains open; in our opinion, this layer is not Yarmukian although some sherds resemble Yarmukian (Kenyon and Holland, 1982, cover plate and Figs. 32-33). Jezreel Valley. A few sites and find spots are known within and around the Jezreel Valley, such as Tel Kishion in Nahal Tavor, Nahal Zehora II in the Menashe Hills, and Megiddo and Abu Zureiq within the Valley. Central Hill Country. We have no information except for Nahal Qanah Cave in the Western Samaria Hills east of Tel Aviv. Coastal Plain. The only excavated site is Habashan Street in Tel Aviv, but there are hints of Yarmukian presence at Wadi Raba and at Nahal Timna near Kibbutz Revadim. There is no evidence for Yarmukian in Judea and the Negev. The meager data from Magal may indicate Yarmukian occupation of the Coastal Plain north of Tel Aviv. Jordanian Plateau. Several Yarmukian sites have been excavated on the Jordanian plateau and its western slopes, such as Jebel Abu Thawwab in the north, Ain Rahub farther south, and Ain Ghazal near Amman. Wadi Shu'eib reflects a distribution toward the Dead Sea. Possible Yarmukian presence has been reported in the Upper Galilee at the newly excavated site of Horvat Usa (Getzov, personal communication, 1992). The presence of Yarmukian finds so far north must be regarded with caution since the finds are meager. We see the Neolithique ancien at Byblos as a somewhat different ceramic assemblage belonging to another regional system in spite of similarities to the Yarmukian, but detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this paper. The major distribution of Yarmukian thus lies in an east-west band across central Israel and Jordan, spanning all the topographical units of the southern Levant: the coastal plain, the mountainous ridges and valleys, the Jordan Valley, and the Jordanian Plateau. This band is very narrow from north to south, reach ing from the Nahal Soreq area to the Nahal Hadera in the coastal plain and from the Dead Sea to the River Yarmuk in the Jordan Valley and Jordanian plateau. Possible sites in the upper Jordan Valley and the northern parts of the coastal plain require further investigation, but at present, this limited band is all that is known (Fig. 6).</page><page sequence="20">316 Gopher and Gophna Fig. 6.

Flaked stone assemblages share common elements in sickle blades and arrowhead types. The faunal and floral evidence shows management of ovicaprines and cattle, raising the possibility of pastoralism, and of pig, which may reflect greater sedentism, as does cultivation of cereals, pulses, and flax. Geographically, Yarmukian sites cut across all topographic units of the southern Levant, covering an area of some 10,000 km2. Although the chronol ogy is not clear, the sites can be dated to the last two-thirds of the eighth millennium BP. There were also contemporaneous archaeological units to the south of the Yarmukian, in the Negev and Sinai and in the southern parts of the coastal plain. There are hints of eighth millennium sites in the Negev mountains, such as Qadesh Bamea 3 (Bar-Yosef, 1980), and in the southern coastal plain (Noy, 1976, 1977). No pottery was found in these sites, so they cannot be assigned to the Yarmukian. Contemporaneous sites are also known north of the Yar mukian. A possible non-Yarmukian candidate is Hagoshrim (Perrot, personal communication, 1992). There are other sites dating to the second half of the eighth millennium in the Beqqa (Kirkbride, 1969, 1971; Copeland, 1969) and the Lebanese coastal plain. JERICHO IX: WAS IT AN INDEPENDENT CULTURAL ENTITY? Jericho IX was defined after the Garstang excavations in Jericho (Garstang, 1935, 1936; Garstang and Garstang, 1940), on the basis of analysis of the ceramics (Ben-Dor, 1936) and notes on the flaked stone assemblage (Crowfoot, 1935, 1937). The ceramics were identified by their forms and their painted and burnished decorations and by secondary features such as handles and bases. The production technology was seen as of minor significance. Additional data on the nature of the settlement were few. Over the years, other assemblages or handfuls of sherds were assigned to the Jericho IX entity, mostly by Kaplan or through consultation with him. The most important Jericho IX site was still Jericho itself, in which the reexcavation by Kenyon revealed a layer she called PNA that was considered parallel to what Garstang had called Layer IX. Other sites with Jericho IX pottery include Teluliot Batashi Layer IV (Kaplan, 1958b) and Lod (Kaplan, 1977). Problematical finds were made at Tel Ali (Prausnitz, 1957, 1960, 1970a, p. 157, 1975), and another possible location, Abu Zureiq in the Jezreel Valley (Anati et al, 1973, PI. XXIX: 1, 2, pp. 79 98). Jericho IX sherds were collected in Megiddo (Shipton, 1939). In the coastal plain, assemblages assigned to the Jericho IX entity come from Nizzanim (Yei</page><page sequence="22">318 Gopher and Gophna vin and Olami, 1979), Givat Haparsa (Olami et al., 1977), and possibly Herzliya (Prausnitz et al., 1970). Recently, a handful of lithics from Tel Lachish was assigned to the Neolithic (Rosen, 1988-89) and this accords with notes made by Tufnell (1958). Jericho IX sherds are reported from Wadi Shu'eib (Simmons et al., 1989), from the Dhra area (MacDonald, 1988), and in the Wadi Hasa area at Khirbet Dhariya (Bossut et al., 1988). Sherds with typical painted burnished bands were collected by one of us (R.G.) from Magal and Tel As weir and were recently excavated (by A.G.) at Nahal Zehora II. Jericho IX items also appear in Horvat Usa (Getzov, personal communication, 1992). Recently, a Jericho IX layer was excavated by one of us (A.G.) at Lod. Chronostratigraphy Assemblages assigned to the Jericho IX entity are usually earlier than layers bearing Wadi Raba pottery (see below). This is the case at Jericho, assuming that Jericho VIII is indeed a variant of the Wadi Raba culture; at Wadi Raba itself and in Teluliot Batashi Layer IV, Jericho IX sherds were found below Wadi Raba layers. A similar case can be made for Tel Ali, if Jericho IX material is present, and for Abu Zureiq. Other sites yield no stratigraphic information. At Jericho, the Jericho IX assemblage overlies the PPNB (Kenyon's PNA above PPNB), which may be why both Kenyon and Kaplan, ignoring the stratigraphic gap in Jericho, assumed that this was the earliest pottery in Israel. Kaplan (1960) also used long-range comparisons with Mersin and Hacilar in Anatolia and with Mesopotamia to support his arguments. Munhata is problematical. If it has an assemblage that can be assigned to the Jericho IX entity, it is what Perrot called the "Munhata Phase" (Layer 2B1), which, according to Perrot, is stratigraphically post-Yarmukian and pre Wadi Raba. It is hard to identify such an intermediate phase in the lithics (Gopher, 1989c) or in the pottery (Garfinkel, 1992), but Perrot's suggestion should not be ruled out. The only dates are one from Nizzanim (on bone) in the first half of the seventh millennium BP and a questionable date (on burnt earth and with large standard deviation) from Givat Haparsa in the mid-seventh millennium (Table I). These dates are of low reliability but hint that the Jericho IX entity falls in the seventh millennium BP. Lithics The scarcity of quantitative data on debitage and cores prevents detailed technological comparison of the Yarmukian and Jericho IX lithic assemblages. In the assemblages published from Jericho, Givat Haparsa, and Nizzanim, bipo lar cores seem to be altogether absent and flakes dominate the debitage. Blades</page><page sequence="23">Pottery Neolithic in the Southern Levant 319 are overrepresented in the tools because of preferential selection. The tools are mainly arrowheads, sickle blades, axes, bifacial knives, awls/borers, scrapers, notches and denticulates, and retouched flakes and blades (Figs. 7 and 8). Sub types of Amuq and By bios points are still present in small numbers, along with the more numerous Haparsa, Nizzanim, and Herzliya arrowheads and some transversal arrowheads (Olami etal., 1977; Yeivin and Olami, 1979; Crowfoot Payne, 1983). Among the sickle blades, the narrow, coarsely denticulated types (typical of the Yarmukian) are associated with thicker and wider specimens, sometimes curved or trapezoidal in shape and often covered by bifacial pressure flaking (for typology, see Gopher, 1989a, pp. 95-108). Long knives made on tabular flint appear in small quantities, and scrapers on tabular flint herald the later fan scrapers. Seriation of flaked stone assemblages such as those from Nizzanim and Givat Haparsa, and especially the arrowheads and sickle blades, shows that they are later than Yarmukian assemblages such as Shaar Hagolan and Munhata 2B (Gopher, 1985, 1989a). They also seem to postdate the Jericho PNA (Gopher, 1989a). Pottery According to Ben-Dor (1936), Kenyon and Holland (1983), and Kaplan (1977), the Jericho IX ceramic assemblage includes two elements, a cruder and finer kind. The former is coarse, porous, straw-tempered, handmade pottery made of light creamy ware. It has an uneven surface and is usually grass smoothed. The main forms are bowls with rounded or straight, upright or vertical sides. Hole-mouth jars have inverted rims and sometimes bear cylindrical knobs and triangular knob-handles. Jars have long, straight, narrowing necks and weak shoulders. Flat trays with angular sides are also found. Handles occur on jars, on or just below the shoulder, and on large bowls. Handle types include large and small loop-handles, lug-handles, horizontal pierced handles, and knobs. Flat, pedestalled, and ring-bases appear. Decoration includes burnish on plain and simple red slip. The finer element comprises chiefly wide, open bowls with or without handles, small jars, and cups. The ware is fine, light buff without organic additives. On the inside faces of the bowls and the walls of the jars and cups is a geometric pattern of dark brown, or red, paint with horizontal band and chevron and lattice reserve areas left unpainted, showing the original creamy</page><page sequence="24">320 Gopher and Gophna Fig. 7.

The brown or red paint was burnished, creating a further contrast between the luster and the matt (Fig. 9). Architecture The only evidence we have are isolated sections of stone walls and plastered pits, revetted by low walls of adobe and stones. The most conspicuous features are the pits, shallow depressions, and hearths. The pits are thought to have been borrow-pits for mud for bricks (Kenyon, 1957). The reports of Nizzanim and Givat Haparsa indicate pits, hearths, and hut-bases, but with no signs of struc tures (Yeivin and Olami, 1979; Olami et at., 1977). Round sunken mud-brick structures were discovered in recent excavations at Lod (A.G., 1992). Economy The only faunal data are from Nizzanim where caprovines, cattle, and pig represent domesticates, while gazelle and fish represent wild fauna. In Jericho, the PN levels provide very limited data, but the dominance of sheep-goat is still apparent (Clutton-Brock, 1971). Plant remains are problematical but suggest the presence of cereals and legumes (Hopf, 1983). Burials Fragments of adults and a child were found below a floor at Nizzanim (Yeivin and Olami, 1979). At Lod, two burials were recently exposed in shallow pits; these were primary burials of adults in contracted positions, intact with skulls. Figurines A schematic anthropomorphic representation was found at Givat Haparsa (Noy, 1977, Fig. 9: 19, p. 30), and a single fragment of a clay object in Teluliot Batashi Layer IV (Kaplan, 1958b, p. 19, Fig. 9: 33) may be part of a zoomorphic figurine. Typical Yarmukian clay figurines and incised pebbles are absent. Site Distribution The Jericho IX distribution includes sites and find spots in the southern parts of the coastal plain and the Shephelah such as Wadi Raba, Lod, Teluliot Batashi, Givat Haparsa, Nizzanim, and Lachish. The few sherds from Magal may indicate the presence of Jericho IX in more northerly parts of the coastal plain. No Jericho IX material is reported from the hilly area of Israel. Jericho</page><page sequence="27">Pottery Neolithic in the Southern Levant 323 Fig. 9. Pottery vessels from Jericho Layer IX of the Garstang excavation (after Ben-Dor, 1936).</page><page sequence="28">324 Gopher and Gophna itself is the only known site in the lower Jordan Valley. Jericho IX assemblages are known in the Jordan Valley north of Jericho apart from the problematical Tel Ali in the middle Jordan Valley. Jericho IX potsherds are reported from the Jezreel Valley at Abu Zureiq and Megiddo and from the Menashe Hills at Nahal Zehora II. Find spots were reported from Jordan in Wadi Shu'eib, ca. 20 km west of Ain Ghazal; from the Dhra area, east of the Dead Sea; and from the Wadi Hasa area south of Dhra (Fig. 10). This distribution covers ecological zones from the coastal plain and its trough basins, through the low hilly Shephelah to the Jordan Valley and areas to the east of the Dead Sea. Like the Yarmukian, Jericho IX seems to be a local phenomenon. It differs from the Yarmukian in its more southerly orientation, with sites in the southern parts of the Shephelah and the coastal plain, in the lower Jordan Valley and around the Dead Sea. No Jericho IX occurrences have been reported from the high, northern parts of the Jordanian plateau or the mountainous ridges of Israel. The Jericho IX and Yarmukian distributions seem to overlap in the area from the Soreq basin in the south and to the Jezreel Valley in the north, but the Jericho IX sites extend farther south (compare Figs. 6 and 10). The possible presence of Jericho IX or Jericho IX-like ceramics in the Lower Galilee [at Tel Asweir or Yiftahel (Braun, personal communication, 1992)], and even in the Upper Galilee [at Horvat Usa (Getzov, personal com munication, 1992)], may have important implications. Summary Our data on Jericho IX provide a few of the elements needed for a cultural definition. The pottery is quite distinctive, mainly in its painted and burnished surface treatment and its decorative elements. This is supported by petrographic analyses (Goren, 1991). Compared to the Yarmukian, the Jericho IX pottery seems at first to be less distinctive, but we believe that it does stand apart. The major differences between the Jericho IX and Yarmukian ceramics are (1) the innovative use of slip, paint, and burnish in Jericho IX, which indicates a different technology in prefiring vessel preparation; (2) different decorative elements and motifs; and (3) different vessel shapes, mainly in the jars, but also in bowls and hole mouth forms (the Yarmukian platters and pedestalled bowls are almost completely absent from Jericho IX). In fact, surface treatment of painted and perhaps burnished brown and red bands did occur in the Yarmukian (in Munhata 2B, Nahal Qanah Cave, and Nahal Zehora II). Painted-burnished band patterns also appear in Wadi Raba assemblages such as Ein el Jarba (Kaplan, 1969, Fig. 9), and Nahal Zehora II. It is not likely that all these assemblages are mixed, but it is possible that what</page><page sequence="29">Pottery Neolithic in the Southern Levant Fig. 10.

The sequence from Jericho may indicate a similar trend. The lithics are another distinctive element. The typology of the sickle blades and the arrowheads, and the bifacial knives and tabular scrapers seem to form a characteristic assemblage which postdates the Yarmukian. However, evidence for this is scarce, and the technotypological and stylistic homogeneity of the coastal assemblages (Nizzanim and Givat Haparsa) may be a geographic feature. Other information, such as architecture, economy, burials, and figurines, is scant, making it difficult to identify repetition in Jericho IX traits. The chro nology can be inferred only from stratigraphic data, with almost no radiometric dates. In sum, Jericho IX is an archaeological entity that merits recognition. It covered an area somewhat larger than that of the Yarmukian and had an unknown time span. We believe that areas to the south and north of the Jericho IX distribution were also settled, but the present state of knowledge does not permit a fuller reconstruction. WADI RABA: A MAJOR CULTURE OF THE SEVENTH MILLENNIUM BP The Wadi Raba culture was defined as an independent entity by Kaplan based on his work in the Tel Aviv area (Kaplan, 1958a, c). Excavation at the site of Wadi Raba yielded specific pottery assemblages as well as shaped sling stones, which were a new category of finds. There were also architectural remains in a stratigraphic sequence that included both Wadi Raba and Ghassulian remains. During the 1950s and 1960s, Kaplan excavated other Wadi Raba layers at Teluliot Batashi and Ein el Jarba. At Tel Ali, Prausnitz (1957, 1960) and Suss man (1990) exposed layers which could be assigned to Wadi Raba. Other Wadi Raba sites were excavated in the Jezreel Valley at Abu Zureiq, Tel Qiri (Ben Tor and Portugali, 1987), Munhata Layer 2A, and Kabri (Prausnitz, 1969, 1970b). To these, we may add layers at large tell sites such as Jericho Layer VIII, Bethshan Layer XVIII, and Tell Farah (North) (de Vaux, 1976). The excavation of Byblos (Dunand, 1973) yielded pottery, mainly Neolithique moyen, which shows some similarities to the Wadi Raba assemblages. Other variants which are related to Wadi Raba have been published from sites in the Beqqa [Ard Tlaili (Copeland, 1969)]; in the Huleh Valley [Tel Dan (Gopher and Greenberg, 1987), Beisamoun (Lechevallier, 1978; A. Asaf, per sonal communication, 1991), and Hazor springs (Stepansky, personal commu nication, 1991)]; in the middle Jordan Valley [Tel Tsaf (Gophna and Sadeh, 1988-1989; Gopher, 1988-1989), Tell esh-Shuneh, Tell Abu Habil (de Con</page><page sequence="31">Pottery Neolithic in the Southern Levant 327 tenson, 1960), and the recent reexcavation of Tel Ali (Garfinkel, 1991b, 1992)]; in Upper and Lower Galilee [Nahal Betzet I (Gopher, 1989b; Gopher et al., 1992), Shlomi (Braun, personal communication, 1991), Einot Zipori (Z. Gal, personal communication), Tel As weir (E. Yanai, personal communication), and the recently excavated Horvat Usa (N. Getzov, personal communication, 1992)]; on the coastal plain [Tel Mevorakh (Goring-Morris, 1984), Newe Yam (Wres chner, 1977; Prausnitz, 1977), and submerged offshore sites such as Kfar Samir, Tel Hreize, and Megadim (Galili, 1987; Galili et al, 1988)]; and in the Jezreel Valley [where two Wadi Raba sites (Nahal Zehora I and II) were excavated (Gopher and Orrelle, 1990, 1991) and other were tested (Meyerhof, personal communication, 1992)]. Altogether, some 35 assemblages are assigned to the Wadi Raba entity or its variants. However, our knowledge is still very incom plete. Chronostratigraphy Wadi Raba layers occur stratigraphically above Yarmukian or Jericho IX. Jericho VIII/PNB, which may be Wadi Raba, is later than the Jericho IX/PNA. Similarly, at Munhata, the "Munhata phase," which, according to Perrot (1968), is related to Jericho IX, is overlaid by the Wadi Raba layers. (If the "Munhata phase" is not Jericho IX, then the Wadi Raba layer lies directly above the Yarmukian Layer 2B.) Wadi Raba occurs in pre-Ghassulian contexts in a few sites, including Wadi Raba, Teluliot Batashi, and Munhata. Wadi Raba assemblages are thus later than both Jericho IX and the Yar mukian and predate the Ghassulian. A similar scheme is inferred for Byblos where the Neolithique ancien lies below the Neolithique moyen and recent, that have better parallels in the Wadi Raba assemblages and are overlaid by the Eneolithique. There are very few radiometric dates for Wadi Raba. The few dates from Ard Tlaili and Newe Yam (Table I) cover the first half of the seventh millennium BP. Dates from submerged sites along the Carmel coast may fit within this range, although the associated assemblages are scanty. The dates from Byblos Neolithique moyen and recent are problematical but may hint at a similar range. A single date from Tell Tsaf falls in the seventh millennium, as does one date from Tell Qatif Y-3 (Table I). These two dates come from layers with ceramics which are clearly different from the Wadi Raba assemblage as defined by Kaplan. A few seventh millennium dates from the southern Negev (Nahal Issaron and Biqaat Uvda; Table I) provide some information on the desert groups. This scatter of dates is very difficult to interpret. There are no dates from the sites where the Wadi Raba culture was originally defined, and the dates from Ein el Jarba (Kaplan, 1969) are unreliable. However, there is no overlap between the dates for Wadi Raba layers and those of the Yarmukian: the latest</page><page sequence="32">328 Gopher and Gophna Yarmukian dates are very late eighth millennium BP, while the earliest Wadi Raba dates are at the onset of the seventh millennium. The chronological rela tionship between Wadi Raba and Jericho IX is more complex. The dates from Nizzanim and Givat Haparsa (Burian and Friedman, 1989) (Table I), which were assigned to Jericho IX, also fall within the seventh millennium. The age of the later part of the Wadi Raba period is unknown. The earliest dates for the Ghassulian in Israel are sixth millennium BP, or sometimes slightly earlier (Gilead, 1988). Thus, we assume that the Wadi Raba assemblages and its variants north of Nahal Soreq cover much of the seventh millennium BP. Lithics Technologically, the lithic assemblages from Munhata Layer 2 A and Nahal Zehora I (Gopher, 1989a; Gopher and Orrelle, 1990) are dominated by flakes (with flake:blade ratios &gt;2:1). High frequencies of debitage, debris, cores, and core-trimming elements indicate on-site production. Cores usually have one striking platform and are irregular in shape. Cores with two striking platforms are rare and, when present, bear no resemblance to the typical, PPNB, bipolar cores. Among the tools, the almost complete absence of arrowheads is notable. Sickle blades are very typical: rectangular, backed and double-truncated, and in varied, but always significant, frequencies (Figs. 11 and 12). Bifacial tools, awls, borers, endscrapers, and truncations each make up ca. 5% of the tools. Notches, denticulates, and retouched flakes and blades together usually account for about half of the tools. Burins are either very rare, as at Munhata (Gopher, 1989a) and Nahal Zehora II (Gopher, 1991), or very common, as at Nahal Zehora I (Gopher and Orrelle, 1990). An interesting phenomenon at the last site is the presence of chamfered pieces, which account for some 7% of the tools (Fig. 12). Pottery Wadi Raba pottery is handmade but may have wheel-thrown rims (Fig. 13). It is constructed from coils, and there is some variety in the composition of the fabric. Decoration was applied before firing. The assemblage includes a variety of bowls: rounded, straight upright, V-shaped or carinated, with inverted, everted, or cutoff rims. A small, thin, highly fired, carinated bowl of grit-free fabric, usually slipped and burnished in a deep glossy black or red, is charac teristic of this assemblage; these are usually referred to as "Dark Faced Bur nished Ware" after Braidwood and Braidwood (1960) and also include larger bowls and rare platters with everted or rounded sides. Pedestalled bowls occur and are usually large and heavy. The typical Wadi Raba jar has a characteristic bow rim and appears in almost all of the assemblages assigned to this entity or</page><page sequence="33">Pottery Neolithic in the Southern Levant 329 ^^^j^^^^ ^ ^^^^ ^ Fig. 11.

Hole-mouth jars are also present, both large and small, and some times slipped and burnished. Pithoi have thickened triangular-section rims, sometimes with knobs or lugs. Handles include characteristic large loop-handles with splayed attachments, lug-handles, and small pierced handles. Vessels stand on flat, ring, or convex bases. The broad range of surface treatments includes primary plain smoothed, slipped, slipped and burnished, and various incised, pointille, impressed, combed, painted, or applied plastic motifs. A red painted band around the inside and outside of vessel rims is a common feature (Fig. 14). Architecture Rectangular dwelling structures with field-stone foundations occur at Wadi Raba, Ein el Jarba, Munhata, Jericho VIII, Tel Ali, and Nahal Zehora I and II. Some of these structures are large and show evidence of internal subdivision. Kaplan (1972) suggested that their floors were of trodden earth (terre pisee). At Byblos, the use of lime-plaster floors is conspicuous in all three Neolithic layers. We do not know what materials were used for walls. Kaplan suggested adobe, but bricks seem to have been used as well. Pits of different sizes appear in many Wadi Raba sites and have been interpreted as dwelling pits or borrow pits for mud-bricks (Kenyon, 1957, 1960; Perrot, 1968); it seems unlikely that they were lived in. The Wadi Raba sites have a variety of rounded, paved, lined pits made of stone, or brick, or both. Circular basins lined with plaster were sunk into the floors at Nahal Zehora II and at Ein el Jarba. Small, irregularly shaped paved areas are sometimes found outside walls. Burials At Ein el Jarba, three adults were buried under the floor of a structure with their skulls intact (Arensburg, 1970). The only other data relate to a fetal burial in a jar from Nahal Zehora II (Gopher and Orrelle, 1991). Jar interments of babies are known from Tel Dan (Gopher and Greenberg, 1987), the PN layers of Tell Teo (Eisenberg, 1986), and Qatif Y-3 (Epstein, 1984). An adult buried in a shallow pit in the PN layer of Nahal Betzet I was supine with hands folded on the chest; the skull was absent (Gopher, 1989b). At Byblos, there was a variety of burials (Dunand, 1973). Figurines A carinated hole-mouth jar from Ein el Jarba bore an applied image of a human figure which appeared to have a headdress. This and a similar item from Tepe Gawra were interpreted by Kaplan (1969, p. 18) as the prototype of a</page><page sequence="37">Pottery Neolithic in the Southern Levant 333 Fig. 14. Wadi Raba incised and painted decorative elements from Ein el Jarba (after Kaplan, 1969).</page><page sequence="38">334 Gopher and Gophna figure related to a fertility cult concerned with the renewal of youth, the bringing of rain or the like. Clay animal figurines are known from Munhata, Nahal Zehora II, and Wadi Raba-related assemblages, such as Tel Tsaf (Gophna and Sadeh, 1988-89, p. 33, Fig. 12: 1) and Nahal Betzet I. Economy Faunal assemblages from sites in and near the Jezreel Valley show a dom inance of domestic sheep and goats, followed by cattle and pigs (Davis, personal communication, 1992). There are rare elements of game and isolated fish bones. Spindle whorls, loom weights, and other weaving equipment suggest the use of animal hair, possibly goat hair since there is a high frequency of goat bones in the faunas (Davis, personal communication, 1992). A prototype of a churn from Nahal Zehora I might indicate the preparation of milk products. In addition to the cereal cultivation attested by phytoliths (Rosen, personal com munication, 1991) and recently discovered seeds, there are claims for the inten sive use of olives on the coastal plain at the very end of the eighth millennium (Galili et al., 1989). An olive stone was found at Tel Tsaf (Gophna and Kislev, 1979; Lipschitz, 1988-1989). Settlement Distribution Figure 15 shows the distribution of Wadi Raba sites and all related variants. If these are all regarded as the Wadi Raba entity, then it is spread over a wide area from Nahal Soreq in the south to the Beqqa Valley in the north, including the coastal plain, the mountain ridge, the valleys of northern Israel, the Lower and Upper Galilee, and the Jordan Valley. However, if we use the stricter criteria of Kaplan's definition of the (normative) Wadi Raba culture, its distribution includes a dense area within and around the Jezreel Valley, with extensions southward to the Soreq Valley and northward to the Upper Galilee and Huleh Valley. It is not clear whether other Wadi Raba concentrations occur in the northern coastal plain of Israel or in the southern coastal plain and the Shephela areas south of the Soreq Valley. The Wadi Raba Entity Sensu Stricto: Summary The "normative" Wadi Raba does fulfill most of the criteria for the defi nition of an archaeological culture. It includes a group of assemblages which display clear repetitiveness in the various components of material culture, some of which, such as sling stones, are very specific.

However, there are other contemporaneous assemblages that do not meet the strict definition and are discussed separately below. Wadi Raba Variants These variants seem to be parts of the same entity and differ from each other mostly in details of their ceramics. We rarely have sufficient data to characterize each variant and their dating is unclear. Jericho Layer VIII (or the PNB) differs from normative Wadi Raba pottery (Kaplan, 1960, 1972), leading other scholars not to assign it to the Wadi Raba entity (Crowfoot-Payne, 1983; Kenyon, 1957, 1970). No comparable material is known in the area, and this assemblage is therefore considered as unique. North of Jericho, the Fazael/Farah variant includes assemblages from the Wadi Fazael springs area, Tell Farah (North) (de Vaux, 1976, p. 397) in the outlet of Wadi Fara, Khirbet Makhrukh (Eisenberg, personal communication, 1989), and finds in the Eastern and Western Samaria Hills (Finkelstein, personal communication, 1992). These may be combined with Jericho Layer VIII in an undatable subregional unit, occurring mainly in the lower Jordan Valley and the mountainous area to the west. There are only sporadic occurrences from the central mountain ridge of Israel, and these tend to be west of the Jericho area. The Tel Bethshan-Tel Tsaf variant, or "bichrome painted variant," is found in the middle and lower Jordan Valley both east and west of the river. This variant was recently described in detail (Gophna and Sadeh, 1988-1989) and has distinctive ceramics. It includes sites in the Bethshan Valley, such as Tel Tsaf and Bethshan on the west side of the Jordan, and Tel esh-Shuneh I and Abu Habil II on the east side; the southernmost site is Qataret-es-Samra by the Wadi Zarqa (Leonard, 1985, 1989). The few indications from petrographic analysis at Tel Tsaf (Goren, cited by Gophna and Sadeh, 1988-1989, p. 31) point to an easterly origin for this variant. The Huleh Valley (upper Jordan Valley) variant includes material from Tel Teo, Tel Dan, and perhaps Hagoshrim, which have varied levels of similarity to normative Wadi Raba. These sites are generally earlier than the "normative" Wadi Raba, as suggested by the stratigraphy at Tel Dan (Gopher and Greenberg, 1987) and the finds of Tell Teo and Hagoshrim. The Huleh Valley variant seems to be related to the northern provinces in Lebanon, such as Ard Tlaili. Normative Wadi Raba also occurs in the Huleh Valley at Beisamoun (A. Asaf, personal communication, 1991) and Tel Dan. The Northern Coastal Plain-Western Galilee variant includes assemblages from the Nahariya area, such as Achziv (South) (Prausnitz, 1968) and possibly Kabri (Prausnitz, 1969). It extends east to the Upper Galilee mountains, includ ing Nahal Betzet I (Gopher et al., 1992) and Shlomi (Braun, personal com munication, 1991).</page><page sequence="41">Pottery Neolithic in the Southern Levant 337 The Carmel-Coastal Plain variant includes Newe Yam and probably some of the submerged sites off the Carmel Coast. Another entity found in the southern provinces of Israel and parts of Jordan in the second half of the seventh millennium BP is the recently defined Qatifian. This has been described in the Nahal Besor area, adjacent to Tell Fara (South) (Gilead and Alon, 1988; Gilead, 1990), on the basis of controlled excavations at sites such as P14 in the Besor basin and Qatif Y-3 (Epstein, 1984). Dll, also in the Besor, had Qatifian and later "Besorian" elements, both preceding the Ghassulian (Gilead and Alon, 1988; Gilead, 1990). The lithic assemblage is flake-dominated, with irregular flake cores and a low number of tools. Notches and denticulates predominate, associated with retouched flakes and blades, awls, burins, scrapers, a few fan scrapers, and rare bifacial axes (trapezoidal, elongated, and elliptical) and sickle blades. The two classes of ceramics have only a small repertoire of forms: jars with high, slightly everted necks and handles on the shoulder, and scalloped hole-mouth jars with handles on the belly; bowls are straight-sided, upright, and V-shaped. Surface treatment is primarily grass-smoothing, with very occasional painted and applied plastic motifs. A distinctive handle has an unusual push through attachment technique and a flat section. Coarse thick bases are characteristic. Architectural features include pits, hearths, paved areas, and postholes on living floors. An infant jar burial was found at Qatif Y-3. A single date from Qatif (Table I) and the presence of "late" sickle blade types (C, D, and E of Gopher, 1989a) place this unit late in the seventh mil lennium, thus suggesting a continuous sequence of cultural development for southern Israel from the Late Neolithic to the Chalcolithic. Economic continuity is seen in the mixed farming based on sheep/goat, pig, and cattle combined with agriculture (Gilead and Alon, 1988; Gilead, 1990). Goren (1990) has recently refined the definition of the Qatifian and enlarged its geographical distribution. In addition to Qatifian sites in the Feinan Region (Najjar et al., 1990), he suggests that they also occur in the Dead Sea area (for example, at Tuleilat Ghassul) and that there may be Qatifian at Teluliot Batashi in the Soreq Valley, stratigraphically later than the Wadi Raba assemblage. The distribution of Qatifian in areas which were later the core of the Ghassulian distribution leads Goren to believe that the latter developed there and subse quently moved northward. The Qatifian now seems to be distributed from the southern Mediterranean coast and the southern Shephela area to the Rift Valley-Dead Sea area and up the Jordanian plateau (Fig. 16). It may date to the second half of the seventh millennium BP, and has distinctive assemblages, both typologically and tech nologically. The Qatifian is thus one of the better-defined seventh millennium cultural entities in the southern Levant.</page><page sequence="42">338 Gopher and Gophna Fig. 16.

The relationship between them and more desert-oriented units such as the Qatifian remains to be studied. At the moment, the archaeology of the seventh millennium in the southern Levant resembles a chest of drawers: the known variants all fit into the same chest, but their spatial and temporal parameters are little known and they are identified primarily by their ceramics. It is possible that what we see here is a larger archaeological entity: a culture with regional subcultures (Clarke, 1978, p. 299). Geographically, the Wadi Raba sensu lato, including all variants, is larger than the Yarmukian or Jericho IX. It also displays more diversity and spatial segregation. DISCUSSION In surveying the available data on the eighth and seventh millennia BP, we must accept that excavation methods were inferior in the past. Standards have now improved, but there are still excavations in both Jordan and Israel which do not meet the required level of stratigraphic control or recovery techniques and are far removed from the standards found in Palaeolithic archaeology. This is a major obstacle in any attempt to characterize the Neolithic pottery-bearing entities quantitatively. The shift to a full and sieved collection of pottery is very difficult to achieve even in the 1990s. The field methods of Biblical archaeology persist, in which sieving is not a regular procedure, and preliminary analysis of the finds is carried out in the field, including the selection and discard of material (mostly potsherds) regarded as "nonindicative." This avoids numerous tech nical problems and saves both laboratory time and space. It also fosters the fossile directeur attitude, so that the quantification of pottery in a statistical framework is still in its infancy. Recently, quantitative data have been produced for pottery assemblages in the laboratory, but without any corresponding change in field techniques. The tradition of full recovery is better established for lithics, especially when the excavators are prehistorians, but even here, there are many selectively recovered and biased collections. Thus, the basic problem which we face with pottery-bearing entities is establishing criteria for controlling their variability. This will be hard to do except quantitatively. Fossiles directeurs are inadequate for analysis that aims to isolate clusters of assemblages and assign them to their proper entities. The use of long-distance comparisons is misleading, since sometimes we are dealing with distances of hundreds of kilometers and diffusion occurring in different ways and at different rates. Even if communication in the Neolithic was much</page><page sequence="44">340 Gopher and Gophna faster than we imagine, still the adoption of new ideas and behavioral patterns was not as fast as simple communication. There are also problems in the terminology used for this period. Rollefson's suggested "PPNC," which is a continuation of a 35-year-old tradition, does not fully accord with our own approach since his taxon represents a time unit. We would have preferred a cultural unit such as "Ghazalian," with the time range of the PPNC. Nevertheless, Rollefson is very cautious about suggesting a cultural entity, given the lack of data from other sites which might be linked with Ain Ghazal. He chose a term which is neutral but which also suggests that the PPN continues after PPNB. He relies on the stratigraphy of Ain Ghazal, and until this is supported by data from other sites, it will be difficult to reach a clearer definition of cultural units within the PPNC period. However, we fully agree with the basic suggestion that a post-PPNB unit lasted long into the eighth millennium BP. This unit occupies about half of that millennium, thus going far toward closing "the gap." It is possible that the complexity and diversity of cultures in this period, given the potential background of environmental change, make it difficult to recognize repetitiveness in the assemblages, but we assume that this will be solved by additional data. In our discussions above, we have maintained that the definition of a culture should include clear time and space parameters. This is based on the assumption that repetitiveness and similarities of assemblages largely represent group iden tity and that we are dealing with social units which were both geographically and demographically small in scale. It has been difficult to maintain this approach, because of gaps in the distribution maps, the fragmentary radiometric data, and the paucity of quantitative data needed to measure similarity. We believe that the unit which Clarke (1978) called an archaeological culture is the one most suited to describe most of the eighth and seventh mil lennium entities in the southern Levant, and we hope that our suggestions for the identification of a number of such entities will provide a foundation for future attempts at broader reconstructions. The terminology used in such a framework must be carefully chosen. The term "Yarmukian" is acceptable because it is a unique and well-defined entity named after an area in which it is common. "Jericho IX," on the other hand, is very problematical. The name should not have such a narrow stratigraphic connotation; it should have been called, for example, "Jerichoan," if, indeed, Jericho is part of the major con centration of its population. This term has been used in the past for different purposes, so another name would now be preferable, such as "Lod culture" or "Lodian," after the site of Lod. The term "Wadi Raba" also fulfills our criteria, even though the epony mous site is not in the area of greatest density of this entity. The assemblages assigned to the Wadi Raba sensu law should be split both temporally and spa tially, since they have a relatively wide distribution and a long time span and</page><page sequence="45">Pottery Neolithic in the Southern Levant 341 are more diverse than the Yarmukian or the Jericho IX-"Lodian" cultures. We have presented a range of cultural variants (regional sub-cultures?) of the Wadi Raba entity and these could be named as distinct variants: the "Etonian" for the northern variant (Upper Galilee and its coastal area); the "Huleh culture" in the Huleh Valley; the "Tsaf culture" for the Bethshan-Tel Tsaf variant; and the "Newe-Yam" or "Carmel" culture on the coastal plain of the Mount Car mel area. In the present state of knowledge, it is hard to define the space-time limits of these units or to reconstruct the relationships between them, but we believe that splitting in this way to the smallest possible unit is important to understanding the eighth and seventh millennia BP. A recent development in this direction is the Qatifian, which was originally described as a subculture (Gilead and Alon, 1988; Gilead, 1990); by virtue of its geographical range and other characteristics, it should be regarded as a culture (Goren, 1990). A chronostratigraphic summary with general geographic subdivisions is given in Fig. 17. The chronology is based on sedations of ceramic and lithic assemblages and is supported by stratigraphic data; the absolute chronology is based on the poor radiometric record and some speculation. There are two major points in this reconstruction. First, we believe that the Yarmukian should be generally earlier than Jericho IX, as at Abu Zureiq (Anati et al., 1973, pp. 79 98), most probably at Nahal Zehora II, and possibly even at Munhata. The possible overlap between the later Yarmukian and Jericho IX is left open (see below). Second, we believe that the Wadi Raba culture is generally later than Jericho IX and there is good stratigraphic evidence for this. Here, too, the possibility of some overlap remains. The Status of Jericho IX We argue for an independent status for Jericho IX, based on its distinctive ceramic technology (raw material selection and firing processes), vessel shapes, and decorative elements and on technological and typological aspects of the lithics. We cannot yet see it with the same clarity as the Yarmukian or Wadi Raba simply because we lack knowledge of it apart from the ceramics and lithics. A major issue in defining Jericho IX is its geographical distribution. Well defined Jericho IX sites are known in the Dead Sea area and in the Shefelah, south of the Yarkon, but northern occurrences are less clear. Its geographical center is thus in the south, as opposed to the Yarmukian, which is more north erly. However, elements of Jericho IX pottery occur on the coastal plain north of the Yarkon, in the Jezreel Valley, possibly the middle Jordan Valley, and even in the Galilee. Yarmukian or Yarmukian-like sherds are present at the same sites, and the scanty data indicate that Jericho IX is stratigraphically later than the Yarmukian and earlier than the Wadi Raba at these sites [such as Horvat Usa (Getzov, personal communication, 1992) and Abu Zureiq (Anati et al.,</page><page sequence="46">342 Gopher and Gophna YBP 5000 5200 5400 5600 5800 6000 6200 6*00 i 6600 6800 7000 7200 7400 7600 7800 8000 -\ 8200 NORTH TO THE SOREQ VALLEY JERICHO IX" CULTURE GHASSULIAN CULTURE WADI RASA CULTURE PPNB SOUTH INCLUDING DEAD SEA AREA GHASSULIAN ACERAMI C SOUTHERN NEGEV and NEGEV HIGHLAND SITES Northern Negev and Dead Sea area "JERICHO IX" PPNC PPNB Fig. 17. Chronostratigraphic summary of the archaeological entities of the eighth and seventh millennia BP. 1973)]. This might simply reflect the geographical distribution of Jericho IX, but since the Yarmukian is earlier than Jericho IX, there are alternative expla nations. Jericho IX might be seen simply as late Yarmukian, occupying all the Yarmukian area but with a rather more southerly orientation and some changes in material culture, which, nonetheless, retains Yarmukian affinities. The archaeological record shows declining frequencies of Yarmukian types and increasing frequencies of Jericho IX types, eventually reaching a peak. Alter natively, Jericho IX could be seen as a derivative of the Yarmukian, developing sometime during its later stages and being based farther south. The common origin or continued contacts would explain the presence of Jericho IX elements in the north and the general similarities in material culture. Again, Jericho IX appears to be something which eventually achieved independence but still seems</page><page sequence="47">Pottery Neolithic in the Southern Levant 343 to belong with the Yarmukian. We believe that when the Yarmukian appeared, it was the only pottery-bearing entity and that it was followed by Jericho IX and, later, by the Wadi Raba. The Yarmukian and the Wadi Raba Sites. We have only fragmentary information about the nature and size of Yarmukian and Wadi Raba sites. The Yarmukian record is diverse and includes several settlement types. There are large and dense village sites such as Ain Ghazal and, probably, Wadi Shu'eib, nonnucleated sparse villages such as Shaar Hagolan and, perhaps, Munhata 2B, single-household sites such as Hamadiya, and cave occupations as at Nahal Qanah. Wadi Raba, on the other hand, has village-sites of various sizes, which seem to be nucleated, as at Nahal Zehora I and II. None of the Wadi Raba sites is as large as Yarmukian Ain Ghazal, but sites such as Ein el Jarba and Tel Asweir may have been spread over a hectare. In architecture, circular structures have long been known in the Yarmukian (Munhata, Shaar Hagolan, Jebel Abu Thawwab), but more evidence of rectilin ear structures has been recently found. No complete buildings have been exposed, but they seem to be single-room houses. Wadi Raba constructions, in contrast, are more uniform and may be multiroom houses built of handmade bricks (as at Munhata 2A). Two points should be noted. First, sites of both entities include numerous pits of different shapes and sizes. In Yarmukian sites, these have been interpreted as pit-dwellings, because little was known of Yarmukian architecture before the 1980s; in Wadi Raba sites, the pits occur beside the buildings and have rarely been interpreted as dwellings. Some Yarmukian sites do show a preference for using natural shallow basins for the construction of their huts or houses, as at Hamadiya, Nahal Zehora II, and Munhata 2B, but the data from Jordan (Ain Ghazal, Jebel Abu Thawwab, Wadi Shu'eib) and the new data from Shaar Hagolan make it no longer acceptable to refer to Yarmukian settlements as "pit dwelling sites." Second, sites of both entities contain facilities for storage or other functions. We would note the plaster-lined basins in Wadi Raba sites (Ein el Jarba, Nahal Zehora II) and the circular silos built of mudbrick. Economy. The Yarmukian economy represents a change in the exploitation of animals which began in the PPNC (Kohler-Rollefson, 1989). Both household animals such as the pig and pastoral species such as sheep, goat, and cattle were exploited. We may also have early evidence for the use of secondary products like wool. Cereals, legumes, and flax were cultivated and almonds were gath ered. Hunting was still practiced. The Wadi Raba entity saw a continuation of an economy based on agri culture, livestock, and greater use of secondary products; there was almost no hunting. Cereals and legumes were cultivated and olives were used (Galili et</page><page sequence="48">344 Gopher and Gophna al., 1989). The higher frequencies of cattle and pig in Wadi Raba reflect a deemphasis of ovicaprines which has wide implications. The use of animal hair continued, as evidenced by the frequency of spindle whorls. The use of milk products is hinted at by early forms of churns. Overall, the Wadi Raba economy reflects an established rural society. The Nahal Zehora and some Jezreel Valley sites (Gopher, 1991) suggest some site specialization within a broader economic system, it is still premature to enlarge on this. Burial Customs and Images. One of the most conspicuous aspects of the Yarmukian inventory is anthropomorphic images. The rich collection of stone and clay images appears to reflect a new symbolic framework and new percep tions, probably related to changes in social structure. Yarmukian burials are on site and lack grave goods. In the Wadi Raba culture, burials were still on-site, but with an emphasis on treatment of infants (jar burials) and children, although still without grave gifts. There are also changes in images, as exemplified by the figure on the hole-mouth jar from Ein el Jarba (Kaplan, 1969, Fig. 7) and the clay animal representations. The practice of incising symbols on pottery seen in the Yarmukian (and Jericho IX) was further developed in Wadi Raba. A wide range of motifs appeared and the pottery is rich in apparent symbols. Both the imagery and the change in attitude toward infant and children's burials must reflect significant social changes from the PPN. Distributions. Site distributions, combined with data on site type and size, are potential means of reconstructing territorial divisions and identifying regions of denser population. This could even permit reconstruction of the level of sociopolitical complexity, as well as being vital for economic reconstructions. However, the limited data base makes this a very difficult task at present, but we would offer some suggestions. The middle Jordan Valley seems to have been an important focus of Yar mukian occupation, and this is supported by the fact that this area has the highest frequency of typical Yarmukian imagery items. Sites such as Nahal Qanah and Habashan Street hint at another potentially dense Yarmukian region in the central coastal plain and the lower reaches of the Samaria Hills. A case might also be made for the Jordanian plateau, as indicated by Ain Ghazal and the adjacent Wadi Shu'eib, or even the more northerly Yarmukian sites. We deliberately refer to a "dense Yarmukian region" rather than a "core area," since we do not wish to infer structural, socioeconomic significance, but merely to point out the denser areas of settlement. The estimated Yarmukian scale of 10,000 km2 is suitable for the face-to-face relations within a social group that Clarke (1978) defined as a culture, but it would be premature to examine demographics at this stage. The Yarmukian distribution suggests an adaptation in which the resources of all the longitudinal strips of the region were exploited. The Jericho IX dis tribution displays a similar strategy, as does the Qatifian to some extent. How</page><page sequence="49">Pottery Neolithic in the Southern Levant 345 ever, the mountainous ridge was very sporadically settled and may have served as part of a system of seasonal movement. Wadi Raba is more complex because the variants are distributed over a larger geographical area than the Yarmukian. The major site clusters of Wadi Raba sensu stricto, as defined by Kaplan, seem to have been in the Jezreel Valley and its fringes and perhaps on the central coastal plain and the Shephelah. The Wadi Raba variants are distributed on the coastal plain up to Lebanon, Galilee, Jordan Valley, the Huleh Valley, and to the Beqqa in the north. Neither the mountainous ridge nor most of the Jordan Valley south of Lake Tiberias was occupied by Kaplan's normative Wadi Raba. However, if we add the variants, the picture changes and all longitudinal strips are occupied, from the Gaza-Dead Sea line to the Upper Galilee and farther north. However, we know little about the chronology of the Wadi Raba variants or even about their material culture. Summary. At present, the Yarmukian looks much more homogeneous than the Wadi Raba culture. This may reflect differences in time span, since the Yarmukian lasted only half a millennium, while the Wadi Raba and its variants may cover twice that, allowing more time for diversification to occur. Our spatial analyses must take into account shifting boundaries. The border between the Yarmukian and entities to the south or north cannot have remained static, and this is also the case for Wadi Raba and each of its variants. In addition, local groups, which may be related to kinship networks at different scales or represent truly separate social groupings, may generate boundaries in material culture patterns which can create confusion in the archaeological record (Hodder, 1977). We should consider, in this light, the Jericho IX distribution and its relationship to the Yarmukian. CONCLUDING REMARKS Populations of the second half of the ninth millennium BP, economically based on agriculture, animal husbandry, and hunting, faced stress caused by climatic change, or human overexploitation, or both. As a result, there were major changes in settlement patterns and a variety of local adaptations was developed during the first half of the eighth millennium BP. Some of these late PPN populations reestablished themselves in large PPNC centers; some may have adopted a strategy of mobile livestock exploitation; others developed a marine-based economy coupled with agriculture, animal husbandry, and inland hunting; even in the desert, new adaptations were developed to cope with the changes. Around the mid-eighth millennium BP, or a little earlier, a new village system is evident with the appearance of the Yarmukian. Pottery, a highly visible innovation, may be a local development based on previously known technologies</page><page sequence="50">346 Gopher and Gophna or an influence from neighboring populations through secondary diffusion adopted by any one of many possible mechanisms. However, the new inventory of the Yarmukian imagery is unique and suggests new perceptions based on social realignment, a new attitude to human and natural resources, and perhaps even a new order in male-female relations. The Yarmukian is thus a new sociocultural system with new mechanisms for maintaining group identity and solidarity. The Yarmukian eventually developed into a rural agricultural system in the seventh millennium BP?the Wadi Raba culture, which seems to have had a larger and more complex social structure. However, the nature of the Wadi Raba system is far from clear. Developments in social and political structure which took place in the northern parts of the Levant and in Mesopotamia must have had an influence, if even indirect. Recovery from the late PPNB crisis can thus be reconstructed as including a first stage of diverse local adaptations (PPNC), followed by the reestablishment of an agricultural system now more mixed and including the use of secondary products. These developments were brought to a climax in the Ghassulian cul ture group, in a framework of varied regional cultures which practiced a complex economy and a rich symbolic life.
