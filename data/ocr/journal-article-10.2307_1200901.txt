<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Volume XXXVIII OCTOBER 1958 Number 4 RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM AND "UNIVERSAL" RELIGION MAURICE S. FRIEDMAN* HERE are many in our age who claim to have rediscovered the se- cret of the mystics and who offer us, in one form or another, keys with which to uncover their hidden treasures of meaning. Seeing the essential unity in the varied forms of religion, they quicken our hope for a universal reli- gion that will unite all generations and all cultures in a common brotherhood. Aldous Huxley, Gerald Heard, Ananda Coomaraswamy, Carl Jung, Bahai, the Ramakrishna Society-these are but a few of the many thinkers and groups who seem to be moving in that direc- tion. The element which they all have in common is an awareness of the im- portance of the symbolical interpreta- tion of religion, and their attempts to discover a universal religion or a "per- ennial philosophy" are nothing other than attempts to discover one universal symbol which can meaningfully be taken as the essence of all great reli- gions. The value of their attempts lies precisely in the incomparably greater value of the symbolic as against the simply literal interpretation of religions, for the varied forms and creeds of the great religions do, in fact, hide many common elements. "The truth is one," says the Vedantist. "Men call it by different names." The danger of these attempts lies in the failure of these thinkers to understand the impossibility of getting beyond the symbolic and hence the impossibility that their own formulations can ever be universal reli- *Professor of philosophy at Sarah Lawrence College since 1951, Dr. Friedman also teaches courses in comparative religion and in contem- porary thought as a member of the Faculty of the New School for Social Research in New York and the Faculty of the Washington School of Psychia- try in Washington, D.C. He will be guest lecturer at the William Alanson White Institute of Psychi- atry, Psychoanalysis, and Psychology, New York City, in the fall of 1958.

As a result, either they fall into a relativistic pansymbolism which affirms all religious manifestations in- discriminately, or they naively over- look the really important differences between religions and force them into a mold quite foreign to their spirit. The only way by which we can keep our foothold on the narrow path be- tween the forbidding cliff of a too rigid literalism and the abyss of a too flexible symbolism is by an examination of the problems of religious symbolism. The symbolic is not a negation of the literal but another and deeper level. To say a thing is a symbol does not necessarily mean that it is not what it is in itself but that it points beyond itself to some- thing of still greater importance. In contrast to the sign, the true symbol points to the thing symbolized by virtue of some quality in itself which is the same as that in the thing pointed to. But a distinction must also be made within the symbol itself, as W. M. Urban has shown in Language and Reality, between "intrinsic symbols" and "insight symbols." The intrinsic symbol points to some object which can also be known literally and directly without the aid of symbols. The insight symbol, on the other hand, points to a referend which cannot be known liter- ally and in itself because it is beyond the rational or the empirical or because it is utterly transcendent and uncon- ditioned. Thus the cross in its Christian usage is an intrinsic symbol which points to the sufferings of Jesus and the way of life of those who seek to follow him. But the sufferings of Jesus are themselves used as an insight symbol for a hidden process of redemption which can never be known directly and non-symbolically, yet is nonetheless an article of faith with the majority of Christian sects. The concept of God as a loving father, the concept of the Holy Spirit as the wind which bloweth where it listeth, the concept of Christ as the Word, the Jewish concept of the Shekinah or Glory of God, which is exiled from the Infinite, the Hindu con- cept of the avatar or incarnation of the Absolute-these are all insight sym- bols, and it is symbols such as these that form the primary material of all religions. If we recognize the central signif- icance of insight symbols in all reli- gions, we must also recognize the im- portance and the difficutly of proper interpretation of these symbols. It is on the basis of a careless, too easy, and one-sided interpretation of these symbols that many forms of occultism and universal religion thrive, even as many religious sects keep their ranks by a too literal, exclusivist, or tradi- tionally distorted interpretation. Be- cause symbols are a union of the con- scious and the unconscious, the denota- tive and the connotative, the rational and the intuitive, they must always, as Urban points out, contain some part of truth and some of fiction. Every true symbol announces itself as possessing a dual character: it speaks to us in its own name, and yet it informs us that it is merely a re-presentation of some- thing beyond it. For this reason we can- not entirely accept it as true or reject it as false. The paradox of symbol interpreta- tion lies in the fact that all symbols need to be interpreted and expanded, yet in this process much of the con- crete reality that we held by the tight mesh of myth and symbol falls out of</page><page sequence="3">RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM AND "UNIVERSAL" RELIGION 217 the frame of rational categories. Be- cause of the central importance of in- sight symbols in our religious tradi- tions and our culture, we cannot give up the task of interpreting them, diffi- cult as it may be; yet neither can we ignore the fact that our interpretations are necessarily symbolic and limited. The only fruitful course, then, is a dialectic between symbol and interpre- tation or, to speak more accurately, between one type of symbol and another -that of poetry and that of philosophy, that of religion and that of metaphysics, that of myth and that of concept-- for, in matters relating to the transcend- ent, even the most literal and rational language can only be symbolic. Positive theology undertakes to de- scribe the attributes of God, believing that these attributes, even if anthropo- morphic in character, have at least analogical significance in pointing to something that is actually true of God. It aims to divest theology of the cruder anthropomorphisms and yet to retain those anthropomorphic images, such as the Wisdom, Justice, and Mercy of God, which are insight symbols behind which we cannot see. Negative theology, on the other hand, emphasizes the utter unknowability and transcendence of God and contents itself with statements not of God's perfection but of all the many things which God is not. This is the via negativa of Plotinus and the neti, neti, or way of discrimination, of the Hindu Vedantist. For this school, God is not good but is more than good; he is not being but the ground and abyss of all being; he has neither attributes nor qualities and is unutterably beyond hu- man comprehension. Even to speak of him as God or person is symbolical and misleading, and for this reason many mystics distinguish between the per- sonal God and the Godhead, the Ground, the Eternal, or the Infinite. It is in the differing conceptions of God that we see most clearly the fallacy of those who seek a universal essence in all religions and ignore the very real conflicts between religions as to the na- ture of God. Even in the final stage of the great religions there is no agreement as to whether God is to be ultimately understood as Thou, I, He, or It. Ac- cording to Rudolph Otto, the basic and original element in all religion is an awareness of a transcedent numinous that is utterly beyond this world, "wholly other," that yet both attracts and terrifies men with its awful power. To this irrational, numinous quality of God there is gradually joined, in the course of time, those rational, ethical qualities of God which we are accus- tomed to associate with him. Yet we must never lose sight of the original numinous element, says Otto, for if we do, we have simply created God in our own image and forgotten the mysterium tremendum. In connection with the question of whether God is with or without attri- butes, we must ask whether everything that is said of God in terms of time is simply symbolic of an Eternal that is beyond our comprehension. To the mystic, time and space sink into un- reality before the awful being of Eter- nity; but to the prophet and the Jewish or Christian theologian the events of history are of the greatest significance and a God who does not in some sense enter into time is felt to be an unreal, philosophical absolute. Again there is a radical difference between those who conceive of God as entirely transcend- ent and wholly Other, as Barth and the</page><page sequence="4">218 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION neo-orthodox theologians have tended to do; the dualists, who divide the uni- verse between good and evil, light and darkness, God and the devil; the pan- theists, who see God as entirely im- manent in the world; and the panen- theists and mystics, who see God as both immanent in the world and at the same time utterly transcedent. If this last position is paradoxical, it is also the one that many of the profoundest religious thinkers of all ages have come to. We confront another paradox when we attempt to decide whether God is personal or impersonal. If it is impos- sible for us to conceive of God as really like man, on the one hand, it is equally impossible for us to conceive him as entirely impersonal in the way that we regard the rest of the world that is not man. If we do the former, we are uneasily conscious of the fact that our God is an idol which we have created in our own image. If we do the latter, we lose God altogether in some monism of matter, energy, or abstract conscious- ness. This paradox is often solved or at least transformed by referring to God as the superpersonal or as the Absolute which appears personal when turned in the direction of man. One of the pro- foundest expressions of the latter con- cept is Martin Buber's description of God as the "absolute personality," who "if he was not a person in himself . . . so to speak, becomes one in creating Man, in order to love man and be loved by him." Buber's concept of God as "absolute personality" stems from his philosophy of dialogue. In this philosophy he dis- tinguishes between the "I-It" attitude of man, in which he relates to people, animals, and things as knowing or ex- periencing subject to impersonal ob- ject, and the "I-Thou" attitude, in which man relates himself as a person to the unique reality he meets at each new moment. This reality is not for him an object to be experienced or to be fitted into a scheme of things but the "Thou," which is, for the time being, of importance only in itself. God, Buber says, is the Eternal Thou, that cannot by its nature turn into an "It." God can only properly be addressed; he can- not be expressed. If we attempt to ex- press him, even in the idea of the Abso- lute which is over and above all ideas, we turn God into an "It"-an object among objects, a thing among things. Following Buber, Paul Tillich has ap- plied this conception of God to his treatment of "the religious symbol" and on that basis has criticized the "critical- idealist" school of symbolism of Cas- sirer and Urban because they have maintained that religious symbols pro- vide some objective knowledge of God. Religious symbols do not give us an objective knowledge, says Tillich, but only a real awareness. Through reli- gious symbols we experience the un- conditioned as the boundary and source of everything conditioned, but the knowledge we attain of God through these symbols is not a theoretical, but an existential, truth, that is, a truth to which one must surrender in order to experience it. If all our knowledge of the divine is symbolical, what, then, are the pos- sibilities of getting direct contact with God or at least of discovering what part of the symbol is true and what part fic- tion? This is a question that cannot be answered with assurance. Every reli- gious person tends to make his own interpretation of insight symbols on the</page><page sequence="5">RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM AND "UNIVERSAL" RELIGION 219 basis of his religious tradition and his religious experience, and, by this same token, those who have neither tradition nor experience usually draw a blank when confronted with such symbols. The mystic claims to get beyond all symbols in direct contact with God, and the Hindu Vedantist claims that all reli- gious traditions and all religious paths -those of devotion, discrimination, meditation, and action-lead to the same Absolute. But even the mystic and the Vedantist express themselves sym- bolically and mythically when they try to characterize what it is that they ex- perience in their direct contact with the Divine. Aldous Huxley has called this mystical contact "unitive knowledge" -the union of subject and object in which one loses consciousness of one's self in the greater consciousness of the Divine. But if this is so, it also follows that when one returns to objective self- consciousness, one can find no literal or undistorted way of describing what one has experienced. Neither Huxley nor his philosophical counterpart, W. T. Stace, seems adequately aware of the difference between mystical experience and mystical philosophy or of the fact that experience can quite properly be in- terpreted in terms of quite different phi- losophies, each with equal metaphysical claim. Neither monism nor non-dualism necessarily follows from mystical experi- ence, nor is the abstract concept of non- duality the only or best means of rep- resenting the experience in which the intensity of reciprocal relationship tem- porarily submerges the awareness of one's self as a separate person, so that, as T. S. Eliot says, "you are the music while the music lasts." Because we cannot get beyond the symbolical in our description of the divine, all religions are constantly faced by the problem of idolatry and demon- ism-elevating to the status of the un- conditioned and absolute that which is only conditioned and relative. The one safeguard against this idolatry, accord- ing to Tillich, is "The Guardian," "namely the unconditioned character of the unconditioned over against any sym- bol in which a conditioned, finite, ex- haustible reality is made the expression of our ultimate concern." Buber, like Tillich, summons men "to penetrate again and again into the false absolute with an incorruptible, probing glance, until one has discovered its limits, its limitedness." At the same time he puts forward the concept of the "Imitatio Dei" in which man imitates the image- less God and seeks to make himself like him. Here man is, of course, limited to those attributes of God which he can know through his relation to God-wis- dom, justice, and loving-kindness. What, then, is our hope for attaining a universal, if still symbolic, essence of religion? Men like Whitehead and Urban would bid us look in the direc- tion of metaphysics, and here surely we shall find universal concepts, if any place. Yet metaphysics is, at its height, inevitably symbolic. It provides us with insight symbols that we cannot see be- yond, but metaphysicians are by no means agreed, and their differences stem as much from differences in their basic insights and assumptions as from the dif- ferences in their logic. Moreover, meta- physics always runs the danger of emptying the religious symbol of its living content and turning it into an "It"-a philosophical absolute with which no one could be in meaningful existential relation. Even less promising are the efforts</page><page sequence="6">220 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION of such men as Huxley, Coomara- swamy, Stace, and Jung. Huxley follows the modern Vedantists of the Rama- krishna Society in asserting that the identity of Brahman and Atman, the Absolute and the innermost soul, is the essence of all religions. Like them, he distorts all other religions in favor of one and makes a futile attempt to for- mulate a mystical essence which can- not be formulated. Coomaraswamy bases his perennial philosophy on the myth of the dragon and the dragon- slayer-the emergence of the many from the One and the re-entrance of the many into the One. But he, too, leaves unanswered the major issues about the nature of God and the relation of God to the world which divide the great religions. Like Huxley, he sets up a false universal which is contrary to the spirit of many religions. W. T. Stace's Time and Eternity con- tains a more systematic, but ultimately no more satisfactory, treatment of reli- gious symbolism from the standpoint of the "perennial philosophy." Here God and the mystic are identical within the mystic experience of the infinite and eternal which intersects time but is not in time. Not only are all mystical experi- ences identical, but all mystics are iden- tical within this experience. "There is, from within, no relation at all between one mystic experience and another, and therefore no likeness or unlikeness, and therefore no concept" (italics mine). But this statement is itself a concept, and no less so for being a concept of the absence of concept. Nor is Stace justified in identifying this concept with the non-symbolic and non-conceptual reality to which it refers, for it operates in the realm of subject and object in which even the memory of the mystical experience cannot guarantee the validity of the leap from experience to expres- sion in this and only this way. Stace's claim that "the eternal moment .. is the one God ... one self-identical point . . . which is everywhere, coexten- sive with the universe" is not derived from the mystical experience itself, for this experience gives the mystic no in- formation that he may carry away with him about the nature of God and the universe. It is derived rather from meta- physical speculation, stimulated, no doubt, by Stace's own mystical experi- ence and his sympathetic reading of certain kinds of mystical philosophy. Still less is the order of the world and scale of being with which Stace explains the intersection of the timeless with time a valid conclusion of mystical experience per se. How does Stace know that the divine order and the natural order coalesce in the mystical moment and "God is totally God"? Is the mysti- cal experience the proof of the truth of these metaphysical statements, or are the statements intended to be only sym- bols of the mystical experience? In either case we are faced with an immense gap between an experience which is defined as beyond discursive though and a world-picture which presupposes stages in God's self-realization and the sepa- rate, yet overlapping, existence of natu- ral and divine orders. Stace's uncritical identification of mystical experience and mystical sym- bol finds a corollary in his still more questionable attempt to solve the prob- lem of how one may judge the adequacy of religious symbols. The "more ade- quate" symbols, we are told, are those which are "higher" on the stage of con- sciousness, with the highest of all being the mystic who is one with God. "The</page><page sequence="7">RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM AND "UNIVERSAL" RELIGION 221 relation between the symbol and the symbolizandum is not that of resem- blance, but that of greater or less near- ness to the full self-realization of God." This "criterion," far from being easy to interpret, as Stace suggests, can hardly be applied at all, for it begs all the essential questions. It provides no support other than mere assertion for Stace's claim that "to find the scale of values . . . we have to look . . . to the eternal moment as viewed from within, ... to the experience of the mystic." Nor does it provide any criterion as to which type of mystic experience is "higher," which type nearer "to the full self-realization of God." It assumes, but in no way supports, the non-dualist mystical philosophy which Stace, unlike most mystics in the history of religions, holds to be the most valid interpretation of mysical experience. Finally, and most remarkable of all, it clearly depends for its truth upon an articulation of stages and degrees of mystic experience that only a mystic who had reached the "highest" level could properly make! Since Stace would hardly claim to have reached the highest level him- self, what entitles him to judge which mystics have attained a "higher" stage of consciousness than others and which have come "nearer" to "God's self-reali- zation"? Certainly not the testimonies of the mystics themselves, for they are by no means in agreement as to which experiences, symbols, and philosophies are the highest, nor can we divorce their statements from their immersion in par- ticular cultures and religious traditions which lead them to interpret their mysti- cal experiences in terms of one symbol or philosophy rather than another. The apparent tolerance of the modern Vedan- tist for all forms and manifestations of religion masks a value hierarchy in which the non-dualist stands higher than the qualified non-dualist, the yoga of discrimination than the yoga of action or worship, the impersonal Absolute than the God who can enter into per- sonal relations with man. Carl Jung, the Viennese psychoan- alyst, substitutes for the intended mean- ing of the religious symbol an uncon- scious process in which the individual reconciles himself with the collective unconscious and thus attains both per- sonal integration and spiritual power. Jung has made a real contribution to the understanding of comparative reli- gions, insofar as he has substituted the insight symbol for the Freudian sign as the proper means of interpretation. He is guilty, however, of a religious vitalism and relativism that not only leaves unanswered or unfaced all ques- tions of the nature of God and his rela- tion to the world but also provides no real normative content on the basis of which one could discriminate between those religious impulses which are good and those which are bad. Ultimately, "personal integration" is meaningless unless it is in terms of something. Jung's "collective unconscious" fails to pro- vide an adequate integrating center be- cause, for all its great energy, it does and must fall short of any conception of God as really transcendent and uncon- ditioned. Unlimited psychic energy can- not be identified with the divine without running the risk of falling into a demonic identification of spirituality and psychic power which leaves unanswered the question of motivation of the will. This criticism can be leveled against many of the forms of occultism, spiritualism, and scientific mysticism that are in vogue today.</page><page sequence="8">222 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Jung's psychology of religion is only one among many manifestations of the strong modern tendency to reduce reli- gion to symbolism, in which the "sym- bol" no longer corresponds to a tran- scendent reality or derives from a meet- ing with the divine but is merely a mani- festation of the psyche or an imaginative projection of man's own ideals and aspirations. When Jung advises his Catholic patient to go to the confes- sional, the pragmatic effect for which Jung hopes depends upon the patient's believing in the objective reality of di- vine forgiveness and not himself being a Jungian! "In earlier times, symbolism was regarded as a form of religious thinking," writes Abraham J. Heschel in Man's Quest for God. "In modern times religion is regarded as a form of symbolic thinking." This reversal of roles "regards religion as a fiction, use- ful to society or to man's personal well- being. Religion is, then, no longer a relationship of man to God but a rela- tionship of man to the symbol of his highest ideals." No pragmatic "will to believe" can make such "symbols" be- lievable. No psychological or social need to act "as if" these symbols had some reality independent of man can enable us to worship them. "Symbols can be taken seriously," writes Heschel, "only if we are con- vinced of man's ability to create legiti- mate symbols, namely, of his ability to capture the invisible in the visible, the absolute in the relative." The validity of these symbols will also depend, He- schel points out, upon our being in pos- session of criteria by means of which we can decide which symbols represent and which misrepresent the object we are interested in; which to accept and which to reject: In order to prove the validity of symbols in general and in order to judge the adequacy of particular symbols, we must be in possession of a knowledge of the symbolized object that is independent of all symbols. To justify and to judge symbols we are in need of non-sym- bolic knowledge [Man's Quest for God, p. 130]. Heschel's insistence that our indirect symbolic knowledge must be constantly referred back to the direct knowledge of religious reality is of the utmost im- portance as a corrective to the tenden- cies toward an idolatry that fixes the divine in the objective, visible symbol, toward a relativism that accepts all sym- bols as equally valid, and toward a sub- jectivism that reduces religion to "mere" symbolism. But is Heschel justified in treating the real symbol as a static, visible object that represents and gives indirect knowledge of an invisible divine object rather than as something that communicates the relation between man and the divine? Metaphysical analogies, as Dorothy Emmet has shown, are analogies between relationships rather than between one object which is fa- miliar and known as it is in itself and one which is either abstract or unknown. To say "The Lord is my Shepherd" does not mean that the shepherd is a known, visible object corresponding to an un- known, invisible God. It means that my relationship to God is, in one of its as- pects, analogous to the relationship of a good shepherd to his sheep (a shepherd such as we can imagine the young David to have been and not some modern em- ployee of a slaughterhouse!). Heschel himself treats symbols in this active, relational way when he speaks of man as a symbol of God and interprets man's being created in the image of God as man's potentiality of becoming like God through imitating his mercy and love. "What is necessary is not to have a sym-</page><page sequence="9">RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM AND "UNIVERSAL" RELIGION 223 bol but to be a symbol," writes Heschel. "In this spirit all objects and all actions are not symbols in themselves but ways and means of enhancing the living sym- bolism of man." The "non-symbolic" knowledge to which Heschel refers is, in the first in- stance, "the awareness of the ineffable," and it is this awareness, in his opinion, which represents the one universal ele- ment in all religions-the essence of reli- gious experience which is both the source and the criterion of religious symbols. The sense of the ineffable alone leads us to meaning-meaning which can never be fully expressed but only indi- cated. We encounter the ineffable as a powerful presence outside us, a spirit- ual suggestiveness of reality which gives knowledge without certainty. The in- effable is the "something more" in all things which gives them transcendent significance. It is an allusiveness of all beings, which teaches us that "to be, is to stand for." We do not proceed from God's essence to his presence, but from his presence to his essence. The tran- scendent significance in things and self is not a mystery at the edge of being but that which we are immediately and con- cretely given with the things themselves, an awareness that is within all our ex- perience, closer to us than the experi- ence itself. The "awareness of the ineffable" is not the knowledge of God as an object but of ourselves as known by God, em- braced by his inner life. We know only our relation with God, and we discover this relation when we perceive ourselves as perceived by him and respond to his demand. We come to understand the wonder as a question that God asks of us, and through this question and our response we come to the awareness of God "in which the ineffable in us com- munes with the ineffable beyond us." Although in many ways Heschel's attitude toward religious experience and religious symbolism avoids the pitfalls of the other universal definitions, we may question whether the awareness of the ineffable is a sufficiently broad and inclusive category to apply to all reli- gious experience and whether it is an adequate criterion for judging the va- lidity of all religious symbols. Heschel, moreover, frequently falls into a tend- ency to identify his categories and sym- bols of the ineffable with the ineffable itself. "The categories of religious think- ing ... are unique," he writes, and "on a level that is . . . immediate, ineffable, metasymbolic." But "categories of reli- gious thinking" are already, as such, a step beyond the "awareness of some- thing that can be neither conceptualized nor symbolized." "Religous thinking is in perpetual danger of giving primacy to concepts and dogmas and to forfeit the immediacy of insights," Heschel writes. Yet "insights" are not themselves immediate, even though they are derived more directly from the awareness of the ineffable than concepts. The fact that he is referring to a metasymbolic reality leads Heschel, like Huxley and Stace, to regard the images that he uses to point toward that reality as themselves be- yond the symbolic. He overlooks the possibility that here, too, may exist that "profound disparity .., .between experi- ence and expression" of which he is so acutely aware in connection with con- cepts. When Martin Buber speaks of God as the "absolute Person," the "Eternal Thou," who can only be addressed and not expressed, he is also, of course, using a symbol. But the relation of man to</page><page sequence="10">224 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION God to which this symbol refers is not itself symbolic, and the knowing that takes place in it is direct, if it is a true meeting. Moreover, this meeting with the Eternal Thou takes place in con- crete, daily life. The "Eternal Thou" as religious symbol is a product of the real meeting in the actual present of man and God. Only when the religious symbol becomes abstract and universal- ized, is that meeting forgotten. Thus the symbol stands in twofold relation to the direct relationship that gives rise to it. As long as it is recognized as symbol, it may point back to the non-symbolic religious reality. But when "the finger pointing at the moon is taken for the moon itself," as it says in a Zen Bud- dhist text, then it may stand in the way of man's meeting with God. Symbols dwell in the world of the "I-It"--of the subject-object relationship. But they may lead back to the reality of "I-Thou" --of direct, reciprocal relationship-or they may obstruct the entrance into "I- Thou." Originally the symbol looks both ways--back toward the concrete religious reality and out toward the con- ceptual representation of that reality. But eventually it is seen as pointing only to the abstract and the universal, and then it leaves the province of "religion," as Buber defines the term, and enters that of "philosophy": The religious reality of the meeting with the Meeter, who shines through all forms and is Himself formless, knows no image of Him, nothing comprehensible as object. It knows only the presence of the Present One. Symbols of Him, whether images or ideas, always exist first when and insofar as Thou becomes He, and that means It. . . . And God, so we may surmise, does not despise all these similarly and necessarily untrue images, but rather suf- fers that one look at Him through them. Yet they always quickly desire to be more than they are, more than signs and pointers toward Him. It finally happens ever again that they swell themselves up and obstruct the way to Him, and He removes Himself from them [Buber, Eclipse of God, "Religion and Philos- ophy," pp. 62 f.]. Buber's attitude toward religious symbolism implies a radical reversal of the idealist and mystical view which sees the symbol as the concrete mani- festation of some universal, if not di- rectly knowable, reality. For Buber the meaning of the symbol is found not in its universality but in the fact that it points to a concrete event which wit- nesses just as it is, in all its concreteness, transitoriness, and uniqueness, to the relation with the Absolute. The symbol does, of course, become abstract when it is detached from a concrete event. But this is a metamorphosis which de- prives the symbol of its real meaning just by giving it the all-meaning of the "universal" and the "spiritual." This all- meaning is always only a substitute for the meaning apprehended in the con- crete. It never really means a particular time, a particular place, and a particular event happening to individuals in all their uniqueness. Symbolic events are, instead, regarded as merely manifesta- tions of the universal and hence as having meaning not in themselves but only to the extent that they have lost their particularity. In opposition to this view, Buber understands the true sym- bol as deriving from and pointing back to the concrete relationship: It does not belong to the nature of symbols to hover timelessly over concrete actualities. Whenever the symbol appears, it owes its ap- pearance always to the unforeseen, unique oc- casion, to its having appeared the first time. The symbol derives its enduring character from a transitory event .... Everything else is only repetition, simplification, imitation [Has- idism, pp. 117 f.].</page><page sequence="11">RELIGIOUS SYMBOLISM AND "UNIVERSAL" RELIGION 225 Because the symbol means the cove- nant between the Absolute and the con- crete, its meaning is not independent of lived human life in all its concreteness. Not only does this lived concreteness originally produce the symbol, but only this can renew its meaning for those who have inherited it and save it from becoming merely spiritual and not truly existential. "All symbols are ever in danger of becoming spiritual and not binding images," writes Buber. "Only through the man who devotes himself is the original power saved for further present existence." The life of such a man, his non-symbolic meeting with the people and things that confront him, may ultimately, indeed, be the truest and most meaningful symbol of our rela- tion to the divine. For the modern man, too, the highest manifestation of the religious symbol is a human life lived in relation to the Absolute, and this rela- tionship is possible even when there is neither image nor symbol of God but only the address which we perceive and the demand to which we respond in our meeting with the everyday.
