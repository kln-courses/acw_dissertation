      <p>Though surprisingly little has been written about the relationship between Nietzsche's and Spinoza's practical philosophy, a survey of the literature reveals general agreement regarding the grounds for a comparison of their ethical projects. Both are described as adhering to the idea that the quest for human perfectibility is only possible within the horizons of immanence. For Yirmiyahu Yovel, this amounts to their common commitment to an ethics of self-overcoming, “whereby the immanent natural principle (<italic>conatus</italic> in Spinoza, <italic>will to power</italic> in Nietzsche) shapes itself into something higher than its raw givenness.”<sup>1</sup> This view is echoed by Richard Schacht, who sees Spinoza's attraction to Nietzsche as lying in the former's attempt “to do justice to our capacity to transcend our merely natural existence by way of its transformation,” but without appealing to transcendent values and without transcending nature.<sup>2</sup> In short, the suggestion is that Nietzsche and Spinoza are committed to a form of ethical naturalism, one that proceeds by way of practices of self-formation or self-transformation and that aims at the attainment of an enhanced form of human life characterized by an affirmative attitude toward existence, a love of necessity or “fate.”</p>
      <p>While the secondary literature on Nietzsche's relation to Spinoza does not go much beyond identifying this shared ethical ethos, the characterization of this ethos does reveal its common ancestry in the ancient Greco-Roman conception of philosophy as <italic>therapeia</italic>. Pierre Hadot argues that for the ancients, philosophy is understood as a way of life or spiritual exercise rather than as a purely abstract-theoretical activity.<sup>3</sup> The exercises recommended by the philosophies of classical antiquity are oriented to the practical project of “training people to live and to look at the world in a new way.”<sup>4</sup> Hadot suggests that with the absorption of <italic>philosophia</italic> by Christianity, philosophy's role was reduced to that of furnishing theology with conceptual material and that it is not until Nietzsche that philosophy becomes once again a concrete attitude and way of seeing the world.<sup>5</sup> In making this claim, however, Hadot overlooks the early modern revival of the classical conception of philosophy as an approach to life that contributes to human flourishing and thus as a therapeutic enterprise. This oversight is especially understandable in Spinoza's case. Spinoza's intellectual debts to ancient philosophy are overlooked by the majority of interpreters, who argue that he was mainly influenced by his contemporaries, especially Descartes. Among those scholars who have examined the influence of the Hellenistic tradition on Spinoza, however, there is general agreement that Spinoza's philosophy can be most fruitfully understood as a reworking of Stoicism. The recognition of the particular importance of Stoicism to Spinoza resonates with recent scholarly interest in Nietzsche's debt to the Stoic tradition and points to a common source in light of which it might be possible to compare and evaluate their respective approaches to ethics.</p>
      <p>That Spinoza and Nietzsche are united in their endorsement of key Stoic themes is readily apparent. There are, in fact, three major themes identified in the literature as points of convergence between Spinoza and Nietzsche that suggest the influence of Stoicism on their thought. The first concerns the Stoic reconciliation of a naturalistic perspective with an ethical perspective, and it appears in their common acceptance of modified versions of the Stoic doctrines of radical determinism, or “fatalism,” and <italic>amor fati</italic>. We can understand the significance of these related themes in general terms as a way of articulating the dual nature of human being as both an entirely natural, material being, subject to the same necessities as the rest of the natural world, and at the same time as a being capable of transfiguring and even perfecting that nature, <italic>precisely through</italic> an understanding of natural necessity and an acceptance of its own nature as “a piece of fate.” The second theme that dominates the secondary literature is the Stoic critique of pity, or the unegoistic emotions, which both Spinoza and Nietzsche endorse and develop in different contexts and which Nietzsche explicitly associates with both Stoicism and Spinoza.<sup>6</sup> The final theme, which is the primary focus of this article, concerns the place of the passions in the philosophical therapy that some have claimed both Spinoza and Nietzsche endorse.</p>
      <p>According to commentators, Spinoza and Nietzsche follow the Stoics in conceiving of ethics as a form of cognitive psychological therapy that provides techniques and strategies whereby we can change our beliefs, thought processes, and affective states in order to free our selves from the false evaluations of external events that are the cause of emotional turmoil. This conception of philosophical therapeutics entails a diagnosis of the passions, which are understood by the Stoics to be the primary obstacle to human flourishing, and presents them in terms that evoke their susceptibility to remedy. For the Stoics, it is the passions, or <italic>pathê</italic> (literally “things that one undergoes” in contrast to actions or the things that one does), that are the sole source of human unhappiness and bondage. In undergoing passions, we are subject to external influence, to the vicissitudes of fortune over which we have little or no control and which are, for that reason, potential sources of pain, frustration, disappointment, and emotional instability. The key to Stoic therapy lies in recognizing that while what fortune metes out is not “up to us,” the attitude we adopt toward acts of fortune is.<sup>7</sup> Once we realize that the sources of suffering are not external things and how they happen to affect us but rather our own irrational judgments about the value of externals, the way is open to us to refuse assent to those of our value judgments that are the cause of our passions and irrational desires and thereby to free ourselves from violent and excessive emotions and from the false estimation of the value of external things on which those emotions depend. The Stoic belief that the good life—the life of virtue, freedom, and happiness—is a life free from passion is reflected and expressed in the high value that Stoicism places on psychological independence, tranquility of mind, self-control, and self-sufficiency. What ground is there for thinking that Spinoza and Nietzsche endorse Stoic psychotherapy and thus the view that human flourishing requires the extirpation of the passions?</p>
      <p>There does appear to be a profound correspondence between the central message of Spinoza's <italic>Ethics</italic>—that freedom is achieved by mastering the passions—and the Stoic view. Spinoza tacitly admits this debt to the Stoic tradition when he describes human bondage in strongly Stoic terms as “man's lack of power to moderate and restrain the affects,” noting that “the man who is subject to affects is under the control, not of himself, but of fortune” (EIVpref).<sup>8</sup> Firmin DeBrabander argues that Spinoza is like the Stoics in considering the passions the principal obstacle to human flourishing and in casting them as amenable to intellectual therapy.<sup>9</sup> Spinoza also agrees with the Stoics that the passions are inadequate ideas of external things and that, as such, they may be amended through rational understanding. According to the standard reading of Spinoza's ethics, then, Spinoza's view is profoundly Stoic in its presentation of rational understanding as the key to liberation from bondage to passive affects. Rational understanding of nature is liberating because it enables us to replace the inadequate ideas that underpin the passions with adequate ideas and corresponding active affects that follow from and depend on our own power rather than the power of external causes. While passions signal our capacity to be affected by the external world, our receptivity to external influence, and thus our passivity, rational understanding makes us more active, independent, and self-determining. Moreover, because when we act on the basis of adequate understanding we act in ways that are reliably self-preserving or empowering, this type of understanding is also experienced as an intense and secure form of joy. Insofar as we are rational, Spinoza tells us, we are powerful, virtuous, free and able to enjoy a peace of mind and a species of joy that are immune from the vagaries of fortune.</p>
      <p>Even this brief description of the standard view of Spinozist ethics as a form of psychotherapy makes the parallels with Stoicism obvious and striking. Indeed, according to Alexandre Matheron, “of all the great classical philosophers Spinoza is the one whose teaching best lends itself to a point-by-point comparison with Stoicism.”<sup>10</sup> But although there is much textual evidence to support a Stoic reading of Spinoza's ethical project, this reading fails, in my view, to capture the more positive strains in his treatment of the passions and so fails to grasp how his conception of therapy diverges decisively from the Stoic model. Before considering the nature of this divergence, we need to familiarize ourselves briefly with the way in which Nietzsche's more complex and ambivalent relation to Stoicism has been addressed in the literature. We will then be in a position to raise the issue of the relationship between their respective understanding of the nature of the passions and their approaches to the role of the passions in ethical life.</p>
      <p>There are at least two different claims made about Nietzsche's Stoicism that are relevant to the question of how he conceives the passions and their impact on human flourishing. First, there are those who argue that Nietzsche appealed to the Stoic tradition primarily as a way of engaging critically with the deployment of the passions in a morality of pity. Martha Nussbaum is a key proponent of this position. She describes Nietzsche's project as an effort “to bring about a revival of Stoic values of self-command and self-formation within a post-Christian and post-Romantic context.”<sup>11</sup> According to Nussbaum, Nietzsche's critique of pity demonstrates his “acceptance of the full Stoic position regarding the extirpation of passion.”<sup>12</sup> In fact, she argues that Nietzsche goes even further than the Stoics by embracing “asceticism,” which is evident, she claims, in his rejection of the value of external goods to human flourishing and in his celebration of a radical, self-protective Stoic “hardness” that denies human vulnerability and finitude. This reading is distinctive in its claim that a commitment to Stoic values is an abiding feature of Nietzsche's thinking. By contrast, Michael Ure's exploration of the Stoic influences on Nietzsche's philosophy identifies significant changes in Nietzsche's attitude toward Stoicism during different phases of his thinking.<sup>13</sup> Ure argues convincingly that in the late 1870s Nietzsche draws heavily on Stoicism in his efforts to develop a new philosophical therapy for suffering as an alternative to the failed antinatural strategies for treating human suffering and vulnerability that he associated with metaphysics and religion. On Ure's account Nietzsche adopts a conventional form of Stoic therapy in <italic>Human, All Too Human</italic> and <italic>Daybreak</italic>, which turns on the Stoic insight that the sources of misery are not external but internal, and he proposes as the cure for this misery the Stoic strategy of changing our value judgments. This mainly positive appraisal of Stoic therapeutics gives way, in the early 1880s, to a more critical stance, which Ure interprets as a sign of Nietzsche's growing misgivings about the Stoic idea that “<italic>eudaimonia</italic> turns on the achievement of <italic>apatheia</italic>.”<sup>14</sup> On the basis of his reading of <italic>The Gay Science</italic>, Ure sees Nietzsche's increasingly critical attitude toward Stoicism as a sign of his rejection of the Stoic ideal of flourishing as requiring freedom from passion. These two readings provide strong evidence that Nietzsche accepted central tenets of the Stoic theory of the passions and experimented with a Stoic model of therapy in his efforts to give new meaning to human suffering, even if, on the second reading, he ultimately rejects the conventional Stoic model.<sup>15</sup>
      </p>
      <p>If we follow the standard reading of Spinoza's ethics, according to which passive affects or passions figure exclusively as sources of human unhappiness and bondage from which we must be delivered, then we might naturally be led to conclude that Nietzsche's increasingly critical attitude toward the Stoics on just this point must include Spinoza and that Nietzsche breaks with his philosophical forbears in his more positive assessment of the role of passion in a flourishing life. Without denying the importance of the Stoic ideal of human flourishing to the development of Spinoza's and Nietzsche's views, I nevertheless argue that it is Spinoza who first challenges the Stoic tradition's conception of the nature and goals of therapy and that he does so in ways that reveal a deep affinity with Nietzsche's philosophical perspective. The basis of this affinity is a shared commitment to the principle of the immanence of human being in nature. On Yovel's account, this principle implies three basic conceptual commitments: “(1) Immanence [or this-worldly existence] is the only and overall horizon of being; (2) it is equally the only source of value and normativeness and (3) absorbing this recognition into one's life is a prelude—and precondition—for whatever liberation (or, emancipation) is in store for humans.”<sup>16</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Since Stoic philosophy also embraces these principles and has been described as belonging to a tradition of immanence, we need to begin with a brief exposition of Stoic ethics, as well as the metaphysics on which it is based, in order to grasp the conceptual grounds for Spinoza's criticisms of Stoicism. These criticisms, I argue, turn on the claim that Stoic ethics falls foul of the version of immanence that Spinoza and Nietzsche endorse.</p>

         <title>Stoic Therapy: Virtue as <italic>Apatheia</italic>
         </title>
         <p>The Stoic ideal of virtue is founded on a particular metaphysics of nature.<sup>17</sup> To be virtuous is to live in agreement with nature. In the Stoic conception, nature, or “fate,” is rationally ordered, necessitarian, providential, and divine. To live in accordance with nature is to actively accept what happens as necessary, as fated, as the will of God. Moreover, since nature unfolds according to a divinely ordained providential plan, which is rational and, therefore, beneficial, everything that occurs can be understood not only as teleologically ordered but as ultimately ordered for the benefit of human beings, who may thus be said to enjoy a privileged place in the cosmos. This privilege, however, is not apparent from the perspective of one's ordinary human aspirations for personal survival, happiness, and success. Much of what happens is not within our control and may conflict with personal goals and desires. The Stoics thus suggest that detaching ourselves from this limited personal perspective and appraising our lives from the standpoint of the whole are central to the attainment of virtue. It is by evaluating what happens from the universal point of view that we bring our will into alignment with “the will of fate.” The acceptance of what happens as fated, which is supported by the conception of nature as providentially ordered, brings freedom from the passions that poison the lives of those who remain attached to external things and who therefore desire things to be other than they actually are. The Stoic sage can endure the assaults of fortune in a way that the passionate man cannot because his soul is in harmony with the cosmos—that is, he rationally pursues the ends that nature prescribes in the knowledge that its ends are ultimately appropriate to his rational nature, considered as part of the whole. Marcus Aurelius nicely sums up the attitude of detachment that is central to this therapeutic strategy: “You must consider the doing and perfecting of what the universal Nature decrees in the same light as your health, and welcome all that happens, even if it seems harsh, because it leads to the health of the universe, and the welfare and well-being of Zeus. For he would not have allotted this to anyone if it were not beneficial to the Whole.”<sup>18</sup>
         </p>
         <p>For the Stoics, as we have seen, the passions—defined as excessive impulses to seek or avoid something—are the primary obstacle to our <italic>telos</italic>, or agreement with nature. To be in the grip of a passion is to accord excessive value to things that make no contribution to our virtue. That we may be in the grip of passions raises the question of what power we have to bring about our own virtue and happiness. The Stoic response to this question, as I have noted, is to appeal to the distinction between that which is a function of our free rational choice, and thus “our own doing,” and that which is not. As Epictetus explains, “Some things are up to us, while others are not up to us. Up to us are conception, choice, desire, aversion, and, in a word, everything that is our own doing; not up to us are our body, our property, reputation, office, and, in a word, everything that is not our own doing. Furthermore, the things up to us are by nature free, unhindered, unimpeded; while the things not up to us are weak, servile, subject to hindrance, and not our own.”<sup>19</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Epictetus's distinction between what is “up to us” and “not up to us” is framed in terms of the distinction between the rational soul and everything external to it, above all the body and the web of dependencies in which it is caught. Our capacity to determine ourselves depends on the power of the rational soul to freely assent to or withhold assent from impressions. It is this cognitive power that enables the soul to exert control over passion and, indeed, in the case of the sage, to ensure that no passion ever takes root in it. As Derk Pereboom explains, in the Stoic conception, “passions do not happen to an agent. Rather, whenever an agent has a passion, it has in a sense been chosen by that agent. And accordingly, an agent can avoid struggling against passions altogether, because simply by exercising its power of assent, she can prevent any untoward passion from coming to exist at all.”<sup>20</sup>
         </p>
         <p>The Stoics thus propose two therapeutic strategies for extirpating the passions, one that affirms our power of voluntary, rational assent and one that affirms divine determinism. Each strategy stages the relation between self and world slightly differently. To affirm the power of voluntary assent as the source of freedom from the passions is to accord to the soul, but not the body, a power to transcend its determination by the external world. In Epictetus's formulation, the body is associated with that which is external, alien, and superfluous to the self. The true locus of the self is the active, rational soul, which must struggle for inner purity and intellectual liberation from body, world, passivity, and passion. This strategy assumes a rigid boundary between self and world, one that isolates and insulates the (mental) self in such a way as to allow it psychological independence and self-sufficiency “unperturbed by the distractions of the body.”<sup>21</sup> What counts as the self is thus radically narrowed, and it is set against a hostile external world whose assaults it must heroically endure. This opposition between self and world is overcome, however, in the self's identification with the whole. Since it is only from the perspective of the part, or particular individual, that things appear as external forces, as hindrances to the realization of personal desires, identification with the whole promises a total liberation from external determination and, thus, from the very possibility of passion. In effect, the full realization and affirmation of the rational will's deeper unity with the rationality of nature dissolves the boundary between the will and fate and with it the distinction between internal and external causes, which is the conceptual precondition for the experience of external determination, passivity, and passion.</p>
         <p>John Sellars has argued that these two strategies represent, in fact, two distinct stages on the path of philosophical progression toward the ideal of the sage, and he associates the final stage of Stoic ethics—which consists in dissolving the boundary between oneself and the rest of nature by identifying one's own will with the will of the cosmos or fate—with the affirmative ethics of Spinoza and Nietzsche.<sup>22</sup> While it is true that Spinoza envisages progress in ethical perfection as a matter of gaining an understanding of ourselves as parts of a more encompassing whole and that he views this process as involving an expansion of the boundaries of atomic individuality, his affirmation of the strict immanence of human being in nature precludes the possibility of a total liberation from external determination and, therefore, from the passions.<sup>23</sup> It is this aspect of the Stoic view, which he aligns with Descartes's position, that Spinoza singles out for criticism in his only explicit reference to Stoicism in the <italic>Ethics</italic>. The Stoics, he says, imagine that the affects “depend entirely on our will, and that we can command them absolutely. But experience cries out against this” (EVpref). What follows from such voluntarism, as Spinoza astutely observes, is a tendency to treat the passions as vices or diseases of human nature, which moralists “therefore bewail, or laugh at, or disdain, or (as usually happens) curse” (EIIIpref). To suppose that human beings can acquire an absolute freedom—that man “has absolute power over his actions, and that he is determined only by himself” (EIIIpref)—is to conceive of man in nature “as a dominion within a dominion” (EIIIpref). Against this anthropomorphic position, Spinoza insists that it is impossible “that a man should not be a part of Nature, and that he should be able to undergo no changes except those which can be understood through his own nature alone, and of which he is the adequate cause” (EIVp4). The strict integration of human being in nature means that we are necessarily acted on by external forces and therefore necessarily subject to passions. In sum, Spinoza charges Stoic ethics with falling foul of the principle of immanence in at least two respects. In identifying virtue with <italic>apatheia</italic>, or total freedom from passion, it elevates the virtuous person above nature, and in imagining the attainment of virtue as a function of the rational soul's voluntary control over its affects, it accords to the soul, but not the body, a power to transcend determination and so both denies the soul's natural status and problematically restricts what counts as the self to the active, rational soul or mind.</p>
         <p>Spinoza's refusal of human exceptionalism is thoroughly endorsed by Nietzsche. Like Spinoza, Nietzsche rejects “soul atomism” (<italic>BGE</italic> 12) and voluntarism as manifestations of a metaphysics that abstractly opposes man and world (see <italic>GS</italic> 346). Nietzsche mounts his keenest criticisms of the Stoics, however, against their account of suffering. In advocating measured endurance and rational indifference toward the external world, which is experienced as the source of unwanted suffering, Stoic ethics reveals itself to be motivated by the desire to escape vulnerability and pain. When interpreted in terms of this desire, the Stoic ideal of <italic>apatheia</italic> appears as a denial of the fundamental character of life as productive struggle and growth. I suggest that for Nietzsche, openness toward the world and <italic>increased capacity for being acted on and affected</italic> are the marks of a healthy, life-affirming form of existence and therefore that he must reject not only a Stoic ethic of heroic endurance but also the dissolution of the boundary between self and world on the same grounds because both postures express a negative evaluation of our capacity to be affected. In turning now to consider the alternative metaphysics and ethics that Spinoza and Nietzsche put forward, I argue that their ethic is distinguished from a Stoic ethic by virtue of its incorporation of a positive assessment of the value of the capacity to be affected into its ideal of human freedom and flourishing.</p>

         <title>Joyful Passions as a Condition of Flourishing: Spinoza</title>
         <p>Spinoza and Nietzsche are united in their insistence on the radical immanence of human beings in nature (see <italic>BGE</italic> 230). For both, nature is to be understood in terms of a single principle of dynamic power—<italic>conatus</italic> in Spinoza and will to power in Nietzsche— a striving or desire for expansion and growth, an effort to develop one's cognitive and corporeal forces in the direction of increasing the power to act, that is necessarily conditioned by the activity of other things. In other words, the activity and growth of particular individuals in nature is always a function of both acting and being acted on, of affecting and being affected. To exist, to be a living thing, is to strive to increase one's power in and through (affective) exchanges with an environment. The principle of the radical immanence of the human in nature thus entails the impossibility of transcending one's relations, in other words, the impossibility of eradicating passivity and, therefore, the passions, since these are the affective and ideational markers of our susceptibility to being affected by the external world. It is on the basis of this theoretical foundation that Spinoza and Nietzsche develop their ethics or practical philosophy. For both, ethics provides guidance for <italic>maximizing</italic> power or activity; that is, for realizing an <italic>essentially</italic> limited but expandable freedom for a self conceived as necessarily embodied and embedded in a natural and social environment within which it strives more or less effectively for self-development and growth. An ethics that focuses on power enhancement rather than on the achievement of a fully realized freedom or psychological independence from external determination opens up the possibility of a more positive assessment of the passions, insofar as it allows for a distinction to be made between that which promotes one's power and that which diminishes it. In terms of these criteria, only those passions that harm us, that deplete our power, that prevent us from becoming more active will count as bad. To the extent that certain kinds of passivity and passion are the condition for activity or help to augment it, they can be good.<sup>24</sup>
         </p>
         <p>This idea of a special cooperation between activity and passivity is at the heart of Spinoza's rethinking of the affects and their role in ethical life. Although Spinoza follows the Stoics in drawing a distinction between rational action as self-caused activity and passion as external determination, he makes it clear that in the strict sense “God alone is a free cause. For God alone exists only from the necessity of his nature … and acts from the necessity of his nature” (EIp17cor2). All other beings, or finite modes, are “determined to exist and act by another and to produce an effect in a certain and determinate manner” (EIp17). God (or nature) alone, as an infinite being, is completely self-determining because there is nothing outside him that could limit him (EIp17). In claiming that finite beings are subject to strict determinism, Spinoza is not denying them a limited freedom and activity. He is claiming, rather, that the capacity of finite modes to exist and to act is necessarily conditioned by the activity of other existing things.<sup>25</sup> We can understand Spinoza's position here as an attempt to unsettle the false dichotomy between total passivity on the one hand and activity as self-origination and control on the other. For Spinoza, finite beings are neither completely active nor completely passive. Rather, their activity is caused both by the action of other things on them and by their own power of acting, that is, by the immanent power of God or nature, which acts through each thing. It is because the essence of natural individuals is <italic>potentia agendi et patiendi</italic> that human power is expressed as <italic>conatus</italic>, that is, as the inherent striving of the individual for self-maintenance, expansion, and growth through exchanges with an environment. That is, the activity of finite individuals is a function of being affected in order to affect (i.e., to act). What Spinoza denies is that our powers of acting and thinking could ever be <italic>unconditioned</italic> and therefore that an individual could ever be the <italic>originating</italic> or <italic>sole</italic> cause of any activity. For Spinoza, we can produce the effects of which we are capable or develop those powers of thinking and acting that follow from our nature or essence only in collaboration with other individuals to whom we are related as parts of larger wholes. And this is because our power as individuals is “infinitely surpassed by the power of external forces,” so that if we are to persist and thrive, we <italic>must</italic> augment our powers through cooperative and mutually empowering interactions with external things.</p>
         <p>This vital interplay between our capacity to act and be acted on, to affect and be affected, is one of the most strikingly original aspects of Spinoza's ethics. For Spinoza, our receptivity, or openness to what can affect us, both leaves us vulnerable to those passions that undermine the striving for self-determination and increases our power of acting. As Hans Jonas observes, although our capacity to be affected may expose us to disempowering, destructive passions and desires, it is nevertheless the case that “only by being sensitive can life be active, only by being exposed can it be autonomous.”<sup>26</sup> It is in his theory of the affects that Spinoza articulates the link between the power of acting and affectivity. Spinoza defines affects as “affections of the Body, by which the Body's power of acting is increased or diminished, aided or restrained, and at the same time, the ideas of these affections. Therefore, <italic>if we can be the adequate cause of any of these affections, I understand by the affect an action; otherwise a passion</italic>” (EIIIdef3).</p>
         <p>Spinoza distinguishes here between activity and passivity in terms of the distinction between adequate and partial causation. We are said to act or to be active when we are the adequate cause of our thoughts, actions, and emotions, that is, “when something in us or outside us follows from our nature, and can be understood through it alone” (EIIIdef2). We are, on the other hand, said to be passive when what we do, think, and feel is not explicable <italic>solely</italic> in terms of our own nature but must also be explained by the influence of external causes. This distinction between actions and passions is complicated, however, by a division internal to the category of passive affects, between those that correspond to an increase in the body's power of acting and those that involve a decrease in this power. Spinoza develops this distinction in terms of the primary affects of joy and sadness. He defines joy as “that passion by which the mind passes to a greater perfection” and sadness as “that passion by which it passes to a lesser perfection.” Spinoza understands by perfection “the essence of a thing” (EIVpref). The essence of the mind consists in its activity, that is, in the fact that it thinks adequately or understands (EIVp26d). So, in the case of joyful passions, which are the affective indicator of an increase in power or perfection brought about by an external cause, the power of thinking adequately is augmented by external things. If the path of ethical perfection is understood in terms of the transition from relative passivity to increased activity, then we can say that anything that reliably promotes our joy and protects us from sadness would be regarded by Spinoza as contributing to whatever activity, perfection, or virtue (these are synonyms for Spinoza) we are capable of achieving. Thus, against the Stoics and their rejection of the value of external things to human flourishing, Spinoza is able to assert not only that “we can never bring it about that we require nothing outside ourselves to preserve out being” but furthermore that “our intellect would of course be more imperfect if the mind were alone and did not understand anything except itself. There are, therefore, many things outside us which are useful to us, and on that account to be sought” (EIVp18schol).</p>
         <p>But it is not just the mind's increased perfection and activity that concerns Spinoza. Or, rather, in a move that further distances him from the Stoics, Spinoza asserts that physical well-being and increased perfection are the <italic>preconditions</italic> for an individual's securing an increased capability for being affected and affecting and therefore of thinking.<sup>27</sup> This contention follows from his understanding of the substantial identity of mind and body. For Spinoza, mind is the idea of body and monitors in awareness the series of states of its body object (EIIp11). The more complex the body, the greater its capacity to be affected by other bodies. A defining feature of highly complex and powerful bodies is, therefore, “a capacity for being acted on in many ways at once” (EIIp13schol). Spinoza links the body's increased capacity for being affected and affecting with an increase in the mind's powers of perception and thought (EIVp38dem). If we want to perfect our intellect, we must do more than simply provide the body with basic necessities: “Indeed, the human body is composed of a great many parts of different natures, which require continuous and varied food so that the whole body may be equally capable of doing everything which can follow from its nature, and consequently, so that the mind may also be equally capable of conceiving many things” (EIVappXXVII).</p>
         <p>It is by expanding a body's favorable, empowering contacts with its environment so that it has more things in common with other bodies that the mind related to this body becomes more capable of thinking adequately, that is, of forming adequate ideas of its affections and affects.<sup>28</sup> And it is because Spinoza's ethics is concerned with the empowerment and liberation of the whole person as a union of mind and body that he rejects the Stoic reification of mind. For Spinoza, liberation cannot be conceived in purely psychological terms, cannot be thought of simply as a mental liberation from the passions, for the simple reason that our minds are not separable from our desires, bodies, and situatedness. On the contrary, our minds are determined by desires that express our body's material and social relations. As a consequence, cognitive therapy alone cannot liberate us. Or, more precisely, the transformation of our desires, values, and beliefs entails the transformation of material conditions, since they are in fact expressions of the same reality. It is for this reason that Spinoza presents the path of ethical liberation as realized in a process of increasing our power through broadening our cognitive and corporeal engagements with the world. It is on the basis of a diverse and rich set of relations with other beings in nature that we become capable of deepening our understanding of the affective relations that determine us as parts of a more encompassing whole. While Spinoza agrees with the Stoics in affirming independence of mind as the goal of therapy, he departs from the Stoics in refusing to construe independence as a function of transcending our affective attachments and relations with the world.<sup>29</sup>

         <p>Spinoza's recognition of the interdependence of passive and active power and of how an increase in the one entails an increase in the other implies a revaluation of our vulnerability, receptivity, and openness to what can affect us—a revaluation that appears especially in his consideration of the ways in which the passions themselves might be made to support our striving to increase our power.<sup>30</sup> He suggests that by building on and optimizing joyful pleasures and desires we may increase our power, perfection, and virtue. Consider in this regard his claim that “the greater the joy with which we are affected, the greater the perfection towards which we pass” (EIVP45schol), so that “if a man affected with Joy were led to such a great perfection that he conceived himself and his actions adequately, he would be capable—indeed more capable—of the same actions to which he is now determined from affects which are passions” (EIVP59dem). Although passive joys and desires are an increase of our power brought about by an external cause, Spinoza nevertheless recommends a therapeutic strategy that builds on and redirects such pleasures and desires rather than advocating an approach that would restrict, control, or eliminate them. He can do so because he understands joy as an increase in activity, an increase in our striving. Desires arising from joy are strengthened by joyful affects, by the power of external causes. Because human power is augmented by the power of an external cause in the experience of joy, Spinoza is able to accord a role to passive joy in his account of the transition to freedom. It is not surprising, therefore, to find joy emphasized in Spinoza's summary of his remedies for passivity in the final part of the <italic>Ethics</italic>, where he exhorts us to “attend to those things which are good in each thing so that in this way we are always determined to acting from an affect of joy” (EVp10schol). That Spinoza diverges decisively from the Stoics in according value to human passivity is ultimately confirmed in his theory of the highest good. For Spinoza, our highest good is to know and love God. As Matthew Kisner explains, “such knowledge counts as a kind of joy because knowing God increases our power, and as a kind of love because it comes about, at least partly, from an external cause, God, expressed as the prior modes that are the ultimate source of all our power. In this way, Spinoza claims that the thing of greatest value and the goal of an ethical life is an understanding of ourselves as dependent on and passive to God.”<sup>31</sup> In the understanding and affirmation of our passivity and our determination by the whole we become as powerful, active, and joyful as we can be.</p>

         <title>The Value of Suffering: Nietzsche</title>
         <p>Like Spinoza, Nietzsche recognizes and affirms the complex interplay between the capacity to affect and to be affected as fundamental to life, to growth in power, and to “health.” It is in just these terms that he frames his criticisms of the Stoic therapeutic model. When he claims that the Stoics “were consistent when they […] desired as little pleasure as possible, in order to get as little displeasure as possible out of life,” he makes it clear that his own instincts tend in the opposite direction: “To this day you have the choice: either <italic>as little displeasure as possible</italic>, painlessness in brief … or <italic>as much displeasure as possible</italic> as the price for the growth of an abundance of subtle pleasures and joys that have rarely been relished yet” (<italic>GS</italic> 12). Here Nietzsche hints at two therapeutic strategies for dealing with the pain and suffering that are the inevitable lot of vulnerable, natural creatures. The Stoic strategy, of which Nietzsche is largely critical in <italic>The Gay Science</italic>, is characterized by its negative evaluation of our capacity to be affected: it recommends a general loss of sensitiveness as the remedy for pain and suffering. But this leads, Nietzsche argues, not to the augmentation of life's forces, to joy and activity, but to their depletion and impoverishment. The reduction of our capacity for suffering also reduces our capacity for joy. Nietzsche elaborates on these criticisms of the Stoic account of suffering in a companion note from 1881:
<disp-quote>
               <p>I believe that we do not understand Stoicism for what it really is. Its essential feature as an attitude of the soul—which is what it originally was before being taken over by philosophy—is its comportment toward pain and representations of the unpleasant: an intensification of a certain <italic>heaviness</italic> and <italic>weariness</italic> to the utmost degree in order to weaken the experience of pain. Its basic motifs are <italic>paralysis</italic> and <italic>coldness</italic>, hence a form of anesthesia. The principal aim of Stoic edification is to eliminate any <italic>inclination to excitement</italic>, continually to lessen the number of things that might offer enticement, to awaken distaste for and to belittle the value of most things that offer stimulation, to hate excitement as an enemy; indeed, to hate the passions themselves as if they were a form of disease or something entirely unworthy; for they are the hallmark of every despicable and painful manifestation of suffering. <italic>In summa: turning oneself into stone</italic> as a weapon against suffering and in future conferring all worthy names of divine-like virtues upon a statue. […] If a Stoic attains the character he seeks—<italic>for the most part he already possesses this character</italic> and therefore chooses <italic>this</italic> philosophy—the loss of feeling reached is the result of the pressure of a tourniquet. I am very antipathetic to this line of thought. It undervalues the value of <italic>pain</italic> (it is as useful and necessary as pleasure), the value of stimulation and suffering. It is finally compelled to say: everything that happens is acceptable to me; nothing is to be different. There are <italic>no needs over which it triumphs</italic> because it has killed the passion for needs. (<italic>KSA</italic> 9:15[55], pp. 652–53)<sup>32</sup>

            </disp-quote>
In articulating the reasons for his antipathy to the Stoic strategy of extirpation, Nietzsche reiterates his view that Stoicism undervalues pain, stimulation, and suffering. Peter Groff argues that this criticism is potentially misleading insofar as it serves to cover over a deeper affinity between Nietzsche and the Stoics. To see this affinity we need, Groff says, to distinguish between eliminating suffering and banishing sorrow. While suffering can be understood as “an inescapable fact of embodied existence[,] … sorrow is merely one optional interpretation of that experience. In other words, sorrow and joy both have to do with one's interpretation and evaluation of the meaning and value of suffering.”<sup>33</sup> Groff argues that the Stoics and Nietzsche are actually united in their acknowledgment of the impossibility of eliminating suffering but not sorrow.</p>
         <p>No one could argue with Groff's claim that Nietzsche's fundamental orientation toward existence is “not one of recoiling, sadness, or regret, but rather one of affirmation, gaiety, cheerfulness, and joy” or, in other words, that Nietzsche refuses to interpret suffering as an objection to existence.<sup>34</sup> A close reading of the 1881 note, however, reveals that, contra Groff, Nietzsche <italic>does</italic> believe that a Stoic attitude toward existence constitutes an effective way of minimizing existential suffering <italic>and</italic> that it also expresses a sorrowful rather than a joyful or “life-affirming” interpretation of existence. Moreover, it is clear from what Nietzsche says both in this unpublished note and in published comments that he does not object to Stoic therapy on the grounds that it works to deaden painful affects. On the contrary, he recognizes that under certain circumstances resorting to radical measures like anesthesia and extirpation in the struggle against unbearable suffering or debilitating passions like fear is an essential expedient for the preservation of life (see <italic>GS</italic> 306). The fact that Nietzsche does not criticize Stoic therapy as a way of managing the passions under conditions of duress helps to clarify the real target of his criticism. For Nietzsche, the folly of Stoic ethics is in turning a useful strategy for dealing with destructive or debilitating passions into an ideal of human flourishing. It is the Stoic <italic>ideal</italic> of virtue as freedom from passion, along with the interpretation and evaluation of existence that undergirds this ideal, that Nietzsche calls into question.</p>
         <p>Nietzsche evaluates this ideal from the perspective of promoting the enhancement and growth of human power. For Nietzsche, power is essentially a matter of growth and expansion, a matter of increase and “becoming more.” In a remarkable echo of Spinoza, Nietzsche characterizes happiness as “[t]he feeling that power increases, that resistance is overcome” (<italic>A</italic> 53).<sup>35</sup> In other words, happiness or joy is the affective marker of successful striving to increase power against resistance, whether internal (other drives and affects) or external. This conception of the mechanism of power increase is clearly at play in Nietzsche's objections to the Stoic ideal of virtue. In denying value to stimulation, suffering, and passion, Stoicism also denies what is for Nietzsche a fundamental condition for growth in activity and joy; namely, openness to being affected. Insofar as Stoic ethics advocates withdrawal, endurance, and indifference toward the world, it closes the door to valuable sources of stimulation and struggle, thus impeding rather than promoting human freedom and flourishing.</p>
         <p>We can deepen our understanding of Nietzsche's critique of Stoic ethics if we consider the way he characterizes the desire that animates it. The desire for redemption from a world that is experienced as the source of unwanted suffering is typical, Nietzsche claims in <italic>GS</italic> 370, of those who suffer from the impoverishment of life. Those lacking in strength and vitality typically seek either “enclosure in optimistic horizons” as a means of insulating the self from a world perceived as the source of suffering or some form of affective discharge that serves to numb pain. The need for such measures betrays an incapacity to affirm “growing and struggling life” (<italic>GS</italic> 370), or life in its character as growth and struggle. The selection of radical expedients like extirpation in the struggle against a desire or passion is characteristic of “those who are too weak-willed, too degenerate to impose moderation upon it” (<italic>TI</italic> “Morality as Anti-Nature,” 2). By contrast, “openness towards pain and suffering, perceived as necessary for growth and production” is the mark of healthy, strong natures that enjoy an excess of life, that are strong enough to be open to the contingencies of the world, that are strong enough to be porous rather than hard.<sup>36</sup> In this light, Stoic insensitivity, detachment, and self-control no longer seem to be valuable attributes, to represent heroism or strength. On the contrary, they appear as signs of weakness, as forms of self-protection that express a fear of the world and its contingencies. Insofar as the Stoic ideal of virtue gives expression to a desire to be free from passion and suffering, Nietzsche pronounces it “hostile to life.”</p>
         <p>Herman Siemens argues that Nietzsche's distinction between impoverishment and excess serves to distinguish a bad from a good form of therapy. The difference between the two does not turn on the criterion of effectiveness as pain relief but rather is determined by the degree to which a particular therapeutic strategy exhibits an ability to “affirm life as it is.” Following Spinoza, Nietzsche suggests that to affirm life as it is means affirming the belonging together of pleasure and displeasure, of health and sickness: the simultaneous growth in passive and active power. An ethic of self-control that emphasizes the attainment of a fixed and final second nature, of a health and activity definitively freed from sickness and passion, cannot be life affirming. It would, thus, as R. O. Elveton observes, “be a mistake to read Nietzsche as offering a new version of an ethics of self-control.”<sup>37</sup> Elveton sees Nietzsche's opposition to the mastery of self-control recommended by Stoicism as entailing a rejection of the Stoic erection of “a fixed boundary between a clearly identifiable ‘mine’ and ‘not-mine.’”<sup>38</sup> While Stoic self-control depends on the assumption of the externality of the world and consequently imagines self-realization as independence, self-sufficiency, and retreat into the inner citadel, Elveton reads Nietzsche as urging acceptance of the world that is “as a world that profoundly extends into my own ‘depths,’ challenging me to rethink and reinterpret my ‘interior’ life.”<sup>39</sup> To accept the world as extending into one's depths is, I would argue, to expand the boundaries of the self to encompass its affective relations with the world, which is exactly what Nietzsche does. Nietzsche follows Spinoza in conceiving of the self as inclusive of its desires, drives, and affects. The self is not a “doer behind the deed,” not a thing that thinks, desires, and feels, but <italic>is</italic> the activity of thinking, desiring, and feeling. What Nietzsche adds to this Spinozist view is an appreciation of the internal multiplicity of the self, which he expresses in terms of the “metaphor” of the “soul as the social structure of the drives and the emotions” in their relations to one another (<italic>BGE</italic> 12). This process of internalization of affect and subsequent expansion of the inner world ironically owes something to the Stoic insight that our affects depend on our judgments about the value of things. This dependence of the affects on cognition internalizes my relations to the world and, for the Stoics, enables me to assume responsibility for my affective responses. But while Nietzsche follows the Stoics in conceiving of affects as felt inclinations and aversions that, as such, express judgments of value, he also embraces Spinoza's denial of the existence of a faculty of the will, distinct from intellect and desire, that would allow us to manipulate or control our affects. We are left, then, with an internal multiplicity of often conflicting drives and affects that we cannot surmount, transcend, or ultimately control. On these seemingly unpromising grounds Nietzsche develops an alternative account of flourishing as self-mastery. The virtue we are now called on to exercise is that of creatively shaping and transforming the inner world. For this form of self-creativity to result in the enhancement of power, in growth and fertility, it must not weaken or excise the passions. Instead, Nietzsche exhorts us to put the passions, “those impetuous torrents of the soul that are so often dangerous and overwhelming” (<italic>KSA</italic> 13:14[163]), into service and subject them to “a protracted tyranny” (<italic>KSA</italic> 12:1[122]), so that they may be turned to our advantage, becoming sources of strength and vitality instead of suffering.<sup>40</sup> Creation is, thus, “the great redemption from suffering” (<italic>Z</italic> II: “On the Blissful Islands”).</p>
