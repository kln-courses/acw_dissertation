Following the triumph of Peter Hill &amp; Nigel Simeone'sMessiaen (Yale UP, 2005), Christopher Dingle's masterly and insightful The life of Messiaen, deeply pondered over a lengthy gestation period, clearly possesses its own independent identity and perspectives, and his wide rang ing researches have thrown up some significant new information. The early chapters are particularly searching and contain a sensitive account of Messiaen's sheltered, female-dominated childhood, the boy bound in rap tures of adoration to his poetess mother, C?cile Sauvage, as her 'chevalier rose'. Moreover, Dingle displays a concise grasp of essential theological matters, integrated into the musical discussion in exemplary fashion. In his words, Le banquet c?leste creates 'the simultaneous experience of movement and stillness, and thus a representation of one of the greatest theological mysteries ? the ability of God to exist outside time yet to act within it'. He is right, too, to emphasise the crucial importance of those distinguished repre sentatives of the French romantic organ school, Tournemire and Dupr?, in Messiaen's musical formation, an aspect all too often passed over by musicologists: 'Dupr?'s systematic approach will have revealed to Messiaen the hidden framework existing behind his intuition [while improvising] and enabled him to extend it.' To a greater extent than Hill &amp; Simeone, Dingle is in touch with the darker psychological dimension, the inner conflicts, crises of faith, keen ambitions and frustrations. At the same time, despite the major achievement of La nativit? du Seigneur, he rejects the common perception of Messiaen in the 1930s as an organist-composer in the mould of his master Dupr? ? rather, this former student of Dukas is presented above all as an orchestral composer, whose early works in this medium exude an acute sense of personal and reli gious crisis. The concept of mortal conflict dominates Les offrandes oubli?es, with its brutal central lurch into sin, while the cited preface to the little-known Le tombeau resplendissant (1931) is a veritable confession of anger and despair expressed, I would suggest, in the rhetoric of Baudelaire: 'My youth is dead: I am its executioner. Where, fury, are you leading me? Why, trees, do you gleam through the night? Advance, retreat, hold out your arms! A sea swells at my ears! and it cracks, spins, dances, shouts, yells: the void enters into me!' Compare this with the following lines of that po?te maudit's Obsession: 'Grands bois, vous m'effrayez comme des cath?drales; [...] Je te hais, Oc?an! THE MUSICAL TIMES Spring 2008 91</page><page sequence="2">92 Beyond the birds tes bonds et tes tumultes,/Mon esprit les retrouve en lui; ce rire amer/De l'homme vaincu, plein de sanglots et d'insultes, [...] Car je cherche le vide, et le noir, et le nu!' This outburst may, at least in part, have been prompted by Messiaen's lasting grief over his mother's premature death, pent-up sexual desire - he was about to marry his soulmate Claire Delbos the following year - and frus tration with his bum jobs as a cinema organist (not mentioned by any bio graphers). Seeing the prospect of becoming titulaire of La Trinit? as the solution to his problems, he desperately tried to force the issue in a most revealing letter to his mentor Tournemire, reproduced in 'Correspondance in?dite' (Lorgue no.41 (1989)): Now, my dear Ma?tre, do you really believe that a competition would be so useful? Wouldn't it be for the best if everything were to be concluded in my interest? I don't know what to think and hope without hope. I tell you again that having renounced [the Prix de] Rome, this post is the apple of my eye. I desire it ardently for many reasons. I don't want to ruin my health and my composition in cinemas, and this position appears to me like a safe port, for family and financial reasons. For a man of his sensibilities, Messiaen had a dreadful war, involving hard physical labour in the Pioneer Corps. We learn more about his capture by the invading German army and four-day journey to G?rlitz in Silesia in appal ling conditions, locked in a cattle truck 'among the urine and the poo, nothing to drink, nothing to eat'. In Stalag VIIIA, by contrast, the extreme cold and lack of food induced Apocalyptic dreams ? these and the amazing sight of the aurora borealis inspired Quatuor pour la fin du temps. After repatriation, he spent the Occupation composing at ferocious speed some of his greatest compositions, which take their rightful place among the classics of modern French intellectual culture heroically produced during these dark and humi liating years, notably Sartre's L'?tre et le n?ant and Braudel's Le monde M?diterran?en a l'?poque de Philippe II. Dingle's discussion of Vingt regards sur VEnfant-J?sus is particularly fine, conceiving Messiaen's astronomically aware references to 'galaxies, photons, opposed spirals, inverted lightning' as that 'part of the creation story which equates with the moments after the big bang' ? in the composer's own mind at least, a reconciliation of the Book of Genesis with modern physics. It seems to me that, after the controversial 1945 premiere of Trois petites liturgies, the explosion of critical opprobrium directed at his religious-inspired concert works and their colourful textual inscriptions may well have been a natural reaction to Marshall P?tain's recently overthrown Vichy government and its debased Catholic propa ganda. No collaborationist himself, Messiaen's Gaullist and anti-Nazi sym pathies found expression in a commission by Radio France for Chant des d?port?s, in remembrance of the victims of the concentration camps. In fact,</page><page sequence="3">this occasional work, rediscovered as late as 1991, contains strongly populist elements with a strong tune in the style of La Marseillaise, reflecting the atmosphere of post-Liberation nationalist fervour. With his 'Tristan triptych', Messiaen moved away from his overtly reli gious ethos into a surrealist world of myths and dreams ? Harawi took some inspiration from Roland Penrose's painting of an inverted woman's head, Seeing is believing (reproduced in the book). Alive to the shattering emo tional crisis which the composer was going through, Dingle comments that 'the [mental] illness of Delbos, and his growing affection for Loriod may have precipitated a period of creativity underpinned by the [Wagnerian] idea of Liebestod.' In marked contrast, the more purely cerebral period of the Quatre ?tudes de rythme opened the door to total serialism: 'There is a sense, in the late 1940s, of the pupil becoming the ma?tre, of Boulez actively revers ing his relationship with Messiaen.' He rescued himself from this impasse through an intensive study of ornithology with Jacques Delamain; Dingle describes Catalogue d'oiseaux 's anthropomorphic treatment of birds in their natural habitats all over France, evoking feelings induced in the observer. Indeed, the story of the seabirds' cries in the twilight guiding Messiaen to safety on the Ile de Rouzic is deeply touching. As a church organist, he was affected by the 1962 Vatican II reforms, responding to the challenge, in Dingle 's perceptive thesis, with La Transfiguration de Notre-Seigneur J?sus Chrisr, a bold reaffirmation of Catholicism's traditional Latin-based liturgies and fundamental theological texts. In more worldly terms, too, there 's the very French element of la gloire ? such monumental works are seen as 'De Gaullist', a continuation of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic spectacles of Le Sueur and Berlioz. The ever industrious Hill &amp; Simeone reappear with an excellent short study Olivier Messiaen: Oiseaux exotiques, in Ashgate 's Land marks in Music since 1950 series. For his source material Messiaen used an anthology of six 78rpm discs entitled American bird songs, recorded in 1942 by Cornell University, supplemented by visits to the VIe Salon des Oiseaux in Paris, which provided him with nine tropical birds, among them the Hima layan Laughing Thrush and the Indian Shama. But whereas the previous R?veil des oiseaux (1953) constituted an empirical exercise whose formal plan literally followed a dawn chorus sequence, Oiseaux exotiques reveals a high degree of artistic freedom bordering on anarchy; not only are the birds from China, India, Malaysia and the Americas randomly juxtaposed, but also as he delved deeper into the birdsong, however, the search for musical counterparts to rep resent what he perceived in the birdsong inspired Messiaen's creativity. Imperceptibly, and probably unconsciously, the artist took over from the ornithologist. In most cases the final sketch seems overwhelmingly a matter of artistic licence, and in a few cases (the olive THE MUSICAL TIMES Spring 2008 93</page><page sequence="4">94 Beyond the birds backed thrush, for example) the transformation is so radical that the final version is hardly recognizable when compared with the original recording. Copious musical examples illustrate this elaborate process from first notations to finished score for solo piano and small orchestra - all that's missing are colour photographs of the various birds themselves, a counsel of perfection, alas. The authors' highly detailed yet admirably lucid comment ary reveals that, underlying the colourful birdsong riot, the work is formally structured with clear direction and purpose, employing extended episodes and brilliant cadenzas for the piano. Moreover, a tonal strategy ? notably the E major sunbursts ? coexists with a strict scheme of Indian and Greek rhythms. To provide the wider context of the work, Hill &amp; Simeone provide an interesting and well-researched account of the founding of the Domaine Musical by Boulez in 1954 to combat the musical torpor of postwar Paris. The enthusiastically received premiere of Oiseaux exotiques ? in a taxing pro gramme which included Barraqu?'s S?quence?took place at the Petit Th??tre Marigny on 10 March 1956 with Yvonne Loriod and an ensemble of leading Paris players under Rudolf Albert, a German conductor noted for his rhythmic accuracy, who had directed the first Paris performance of Turangal?la. Fortunately this outstanding performance has been preserved on record and can be heard on the book's enclosed CD, together with the original birdcalls - such is its quality that it compares favourably with sub sequent fine recordings by Loriod, B?roff, Entremont, Crossley, Donohoe and Thibaudet, all meticulously reviewed. 'Never play my music like an ?tude ' was Messiaen's own advice to Hill. IN a rapid change of partners, Dingle &amp; Simeone have collated an invaluable in-depth collection of 16 essays entitled Olivier Messiaen: music, art and literature, arising from the Messiaen 2002 International Conference at Sheffield. Stephen Broad in 'Messiaen and Cocteau' disinters the dynamic young composer's surprisingly acrimonious polemics against Cocteau's manifesto Le coq et l'arlequin and neoclassicism. In a small maga zine article of 1939 he employs heavy P?guy-style rhetorical repetition: 'Lazy: those artisans of sub-Faur? and sub-Ravel. [...] Lazy: the odious contrapuntalists of the "return to Bach" who offer us, without remorse, dry and doleful lines poisoned by a semblance of atonality' (and so on). Though the interwar cosmopolitan Stravinsky, too, came under fire for his rhythmic squareness, symbolising the void at the heart of neoclassicism, Messiaen hailed the earlier Russian ballet Les noces ? among the handful of miniature scores which he had carried into captivity?as the work in which many aspects of Stravinsky's progressive rhythmic language had reached their apogee ? superimposed metres, partial rhythmic modifications and the additive prin</page><page sequence="5">ciple. In 'Les noces and Trois petites liturgies', an assessment of Stravinsky's influence on Messiaen', Matthew Schellhorn provides penetrating analyses going far beyond the obvious similarities so cruelly exposed during the 1945 critical furore, to Messiaen's lasting chagrin. Fully acknowledging the artistic integrity of what the French composer regarded as his best music, Schellhorn presents both works as ritualistic in character, acts of worship played out in a non-liturgical environment, with significant quotations from the Biblical Song of Songs. There are arresting musical correspondences, too, notably between the opening section of Les noces and the 'Antienne ' of the Liturgies, where in both cases we find chant-like monodic unisons on the note E, sharp interjections of piano and percussion and arch-like cadential flowerings. In my view, far from making a soft pastiche for popular con sumption in the manner of Orff's Carmina Burana, Messiaen was surely paying an hommage to the great Russian master in terms of his own unique soundworld. In 'Musical analysis according to Messiaen', Jean Boivin provides a superb account of what went on in the famous and highly influential class at the Paris Conservatoire, drawing on the posthumous Trait? de rythme, de couleur et d'ornithologie as well as former students' recollections and published monographs. Messiaen's own musical culture, reflecting Dukas's eclectic outlook, was wide, with a preference for French composers, especially Rameau, Berlioz, Debussy and Ravel; but others outside this tradition such as Monteverdi, Wagner, Musorgsky and Berg also received enthusiastic con sideration, the main criterion of aesthetic value being harmonic richness, exotic modes, colourful orchestration, and rhythmic and melodic resource fulness. If, despite his own intensive exposure to Dupr?'s organ pedagogy, Bach doesn't seem to have featured to any extent in his courses, the tonal and structural aspects of Mozart and Beethoven were nevertheless treated with great flair, sometimes according to the a priori principles of d 'Indy's Cours de composition musicale. Moreover, the schematic, historically based ethos of that great pedagogical work is evident in Messiaen's illuminating demon stration, in an aria from Figaro, of the evolution of melodic gestures and ornamentation in Western music on the basis of the neumes of Gregorian chant; similarly, the survival of Greek metre from the Renaissance onward is seen in the way the Allegretto theme of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony fits the formula of dactyl plus spondee. Indian de?i-t?las, too, can be iden tified in certain modern masterworks, notably the Vijaya in Le sacre du printemps (Part II, fig.86.), whose legendary analysis in terms o? personnages rythmiques and their expansions and contractions proved such a revelation to the young Boulez and Les fl?ches. Yet, with his overriding emphasis on free dom and liberty, Messiaen was never the prisoner of any system ? indeed, Professor Boivin makes a most striking and unexpected comparison with THE MUSICAL TIMES Spring 2008 95</page><page sequence="6">96 Beyond the birds Donald Francis Tovey! This, on reflection, makes perfect sense, both being excellent pianists and musicians of vast general culture, embracing literature, the visual arts, philosophy, science and astronomy; in their teachings they employed symbolism, striking metaphors and inspired digressions to great effect, and ultimately stressed the immediacy of listening experience over a priori analysis and Teutonic-style conceptualism. Crucial philosophical matters are tackled by Andrew Shenton in 'Observations on time in O.M.'s Trait?9. In Messiaen's view, a musician 'must refine his sense of rhythm by a more intimate knowledge of experienced duration, by the study of different concepts of time and of different rhythmic styles'; reference is made to such thinkers as St Thomas Aquinas, Bergson and Einstein. Above all he draws on Bergson's once celebrated philosophy of duration, which conceives time not in terms of spatial values and clock measurement, but more subjectively and intuitively as a continuous flowing forward, bound up with a primordial conception of consciousness preceding intellect. From this Messiaen argues forcefully that 'for the musician too, duration is the weapon by which he attacks and convinces the listener', as if he were a 'demiurge' wielding supreme control over his creation and audi ence perceptions. Taking up Boivin's comparison with Tovey, I would sub mit that the latter's interpretation of 'Cum sancto spiritu' in Beethoven's Mass in D (Essays in musical analysis, vol.5) is most apposite in this context: 'Meanwhile the harmonies are rising through a series of six modulations, each a tone higher than the last. The result is that the listener, although the sequence of harmonies is quite simple, entirely loses his sense of key. He knows only that he is being whirled through a vast distance, but loses all consciousness of time.' Similarly, Messiaen maintains that 'music does not unfold in a prior time [tempspr?alable], in a physical time, but [...] creates its own time that expands, contracts, colours and modifies'. Thus a slow melody performed on a xylophone appears to take longer than if played by a violin, on account of the effect of the 'modes of attack', and the perception of the same rhythm in different parts of a work may be significantly different. Robert Fall?n, to whose pioneering research on Messiaen's birdsong transcriptions Hill &amp; Simeone pay generous acknowledgement, contributes a well-contrasted piece on Oiseaux exotiques, containing thoughtful dis quisitions on theology, surrealism and politics. The Trait? is cited with its references to certain early Christian fathers and their belief that God is co extensive with nature, notably St Bonaventure 's dictum that 'All creatures of the sensible world lead us to God: they are images of the source, Light, [and] the eternal Fullness of the Sovereign Archetype'. From this, Fall?n argues that birds belong to Messiaen's palette of symbols in a way that resembles Albert Schweitzer's approach to JS Bach. Messiaen also saw surrealism as compatible with Christianity, considering himself to be 'a Surrealist</page><page sequence="7">musician who exceeds his desire of the surreal by the supernatural'. Fascinatingly, we learn that he referred to musique concr?te as 'electronic surrealism' and frequently compared it to his own birdsong style; indeed, Pierre Schaeffer's composition of bird imitations from the 1950s L'oiseau RAI may well have helped to fuel Messiaen's intensive explorations. Even Cold War politics is thought to have exerted some influence: 'Neither abstract like serialism nor tonal like neoclassicism, yet representational like socialist real ism and modernist like the Western avant-garde, Messiaen's style oiseau offered a middle ground that enabled him to escape the political and aesthetic polarisation he discovered in Paris.' All this goes to show how engagent was with wider intellectual developments at this time, despite the ongoing domestic crises which threatened to overwhelm him. Jacques Tchamkerten's 'The evolution of the writing for Ondes Martenot' is a most welcome historical, technical and musical study of an instrument unfairly derided, like the romantic organ, by academics though its expressive possibilities were commended by d'lndy as early as 1928. The uses of the instrument in Trois petites liturgies and Saint Fran?ois d'Assise are clearly set out in tabular form, yet there is also much evocative writing. In the Liturgies, 'the impression is that [Messiaen] is searching to create a portrait of the human voice through the Ondes, a voice from another world, in dialogue with the earthly, tangible voices of the female choir'. By contrast, the epony mous movements of Turangal?la exploited Ondes equipped with a new improved metallic diffuser to create deathly sounds - joy giving way to dread and terror. After a period of 30 years, the enormous score of St Fran?ois in cluded three further developed Ondes, producing a huge sonic reverberation by means of vibrating bronze springs, while the playing potential had been vastly expanded by Jeanne Loriod, who receives a sincere posthumous tribute. Their wide range of expression encompasses St Fran?ois receiving God's grace, multitudes of birdsong, and the highly contrasting 'Stigmata' tableau with horrific chords in trills. This is by no means all that Music, art and literature has to offer, and I apologise to the other scholars whose articles receive, mainly for reasons of space, little or no mention. Conspicuous among these, Caroline Potter makes an interesting comparison of Messiaen and Dutilleux, Peter Hill discusses the various recordings of Quatre ?tudes de rythme with characteristic clarity and rigour, Allen Forte treats Messiaen's chords to pitch class set methodology, Dingle describes the sources and background to Saint-Fran?ois, P?re Jean-Rodolphe Kars discusses the Catholic liturgy with expert knowledge, and Simeone investigates more fully the Paris Opera's choreography of Turangal?la, resulting in the unfortunate Messiaen's brush with the law. The full text of his mother C?cile Sauvage 's extended poem the musical times Spring 2008 yy</page><page sequence="8">98 Beyond the birds L'?me en bourgeon, together with a translation and afterword by Philip Weiler, is a fine bonus.
