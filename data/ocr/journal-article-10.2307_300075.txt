<plain_text><page sequence="1">A DEED OF FOUNDATION FROM THE TERRITORY OF EPHESOS * By C. P. JONES Plate II The ' foundation ' in the juridical sense, ' the establishing of an institution, together with an endowment or provision for its perpetual maintenance', is a conspicuous pheno- menon of the Hellenistic and imperial periods.1 Though ancient foundations vary widely in form, purpose, and organization, two kinds predominate. One, of which the fullest examples are Hellenistic, is funerary. The founder forms an association, or endows one already formed, for the cultivation of his and his family's memory by means of ceremonies conducted at the family tomb. The organization is essentially private, and those responsible for the conduct of the foundation are the members of the constituent association. An elaborate and perfectly preserved example is that of Epicteta of Thera, dated about 200 B.C.2 The other notable form is characteristic of the civic revival of the principate. Here the founder establishes an endowment of which the direct or indirect beneficiary is the city, or some subdivision of the citizenry such as the boule or gerouisia. This foundation is essentially public, and the responsibility for administering it rests with the city officials. This type is illustrated by one of the longest of all known foundation-deeds, the dossier relative to the foundation of C. Vibius Salutaris dated to A.D. I04.3 As well as other kinds of foundation, such as those endowing libraries, salaries for schoolmasters, the maintenance of freeborn boys and girls (the alimenta), there are also hybrids between the two principal types already described. Thus T. Flavius Praxias of Acmoneia provides both for a college of six of his freedmen, presumably intended as a funerary association similar to Epicteta's, and for the boule and archontes of Acmoneia to see to the overall management of the foundation, including the protection of the freedmen.4 In the same year which saw the publication of Laum's book, Josef Keil and Anton von Premerstein (henceforth ' KP ') published a new foundation-inscription from Tire,5 a prosperous modern town in the Cayster valley some 50 or 6o kilometres east-north-east of Ephesos; in antiquity it was not a city but a village or katoikia of uncertain name, lying geographically in south-western Lydia but politically within the huge territory of Ephesos.6 Here KP saw three fragments which they recognized as coming from one * I am grateful to Orhan Armagan, Director of the Tire Museum, for information about the discovery of I. Ephesos 3334; to Dieter Knibbe for helping to track down material in Vienna; to Georg Rehren- bock of the Kommission fur die archiiologische Erforschung Kleinasiens, Vienna, for very generously supplying material from the Kommission's archives, and to Prof. Dr. Fritz Schachermeyr, Chairman of the Kommission, for permission to publish it; and especially to Sencer $ahin for readily supplying me with a squeeze and excellent photograph of I. Ephesos 3334, and for agreeing to my publishing them. For discussion of this material I am also grateful to Glen Bowersock and Peter Herrmann, and to those who contributed to a seminar held at the University of Toronto on I9 March I982. I have generally followed the style of abbreviations of Liddell-Scott-Jones, A Greek-English Lexicon; I cite the Bulletin epigraphique of J. and L.

KP, pp. 84, 86-8, argued cogently for identifying the ancient site of Tire with the 'ATa-rupnv v KaToiKar rather than Thyaira (Thyeira), which they placed about 20 km. to the north (cf. Keil, RE 6 A (1936), 656). A new inscription from Pesrefli K6yui about I5 km. to the east has been thought to support the identification of Tire with Thyaira (ZPE 33 (I979), 191-2; 1. Ephesos VII, I, 3293), but it mentions several villages spread over a wide area and cannot be used to localize one of them in particular.

All three seem now to be lost, but fortunately KP took a squeeze of their fragment c and published a small photograph of it (here enlarged as P1. II, i). By means of these discoveries, and by skilful conjecture, they achieved a notable feat of reconstruction, and the few subsequent discussions have added very little.7 KP rightly recognized the inscription to be part of a long deed of foundation, which from the script they assigned to the end of the first century of our era.8 The founder is a certain Peplos (lines i8, I9), and his main concern is to put on a permanent footing the upkeep of a family tomb (heroon) which is already built and contains the remains of a certain Paula, probably his wife (line io); to ensure the performance of commemorative rites Peplos establishes an association of herostai (line 2o), to whom he appears to make over by this document a large number of objects already in or around the tomb (lines 7-I7). In what follows I intend to show that a fragment recently published from Tire is part of the same text, and considerably affects the interpretation of the clauses embodying Peplos' intentions (lines I-7, I7-20); I will argue that the inscription shows with unusual clarity the elaborate precautions that a founder might take, even when placing his handiwork under the protection of the civic authorities, to protect it from official mischief or neglect. If I am right, the foundation of Peplos will also illuminate the internal history of Roman Ephesos, the capital of the province of Asia, and provide a chronological link between two famous inscriptions of the city, the edict of Paullus Fabius Persicus under Claudius and the foundation of C. Vibius Salutaris under Trajan. The surviving text has three parts. The first (lines I-7) contains the end of an elaborate series of sanctions: these were thought by KP to regulate the herostai established by Peplos, but it will be argued here that they are aimed instead at the magistrates of Ephesos. The second section, unique in the inscriptions of Asia Minor,9 is a list of objects in the heroon. The third (lines I7-20) looks like a postscript, and seems to permit Peplos to appoint a new herostes if one of the present ones dies. The fragment which I propose to add was seen by Sencer ,ahin in the Museum of Tire, where it had been brought after being found in the Yeni M\Iahalle (New Quarter) of the town in i968.10 The text is given thus: o]vyroEr[ ]Aax ELs 5ia[ 4 ]ov 'viauT[ ].ai TrpaXe[ av]8pcoTrov TO[ ]E KaG -r 5v [ 8 ]colapo?[ A photograph and squeeze (P1. II, 2) kindly supplied by $ahin allow some small but important changes. It can be added that the stone has a surviving top margin, and the height of the letters is 2 and not I * 5 cm. In line 2 the editors seem to have left out a letter, since between the pi and the oblique stroke visible at the right edge there is almost certainly a rho (the loop is just visible). In line 9 the first two letters are represented only by an upper horizontal and a worn triangle, so that EAt is more than uncertain. It is clear that the new inscription is a part of KP's inscription, and lies just to the right of their second fragment, which it touches in line 6. The first two of their stones also preserved the top margin. The letters of their inscription were also 2 cm in height; KP's photograph shows that the form of the letters and their layout, notably the width of the 7The only discussion I have noticed, as opposed to passing references, is by J.

JONES interlinear space, conform exactly with the new fragment. In lines 5 and 6 it exactly confirms restorations made by KP in the same lines, and in all the other lines it produces a text that is as good as theirs or better. The one discrepancy is that KP describe the marble of their fragments as ' bluish ' whereas that of the new one is white: exactly the same variation has been observed by Louis Robert in inscriptions from the sanctuary of Sinuri near Mylasa, and is presumably due to the different conditions of preservation below ground.11 In what follows, I am mainly concerned with lines I-7, since they are the ones most affected by the new fragment. However, I begin with a physical description of the stone and of the separate pieces; I then discuss its original setting; next, after adducing a parallel passage in the inscription of Salutaris, I discuss lines I-7 clause- by clause, and then consider what may have preceded them and what they imply about the whole document. Thereafter I discuss points of interest in the remaining lines, and finally give a revised text of the whole and a translation. The complete stone was a marble plaque at least 84 cm high and about I *35 metres wide, with the thickness varying from 2- 7 cm on the left to I * 2cm on the right. The letters are 2 cm high, with an interlinear space of I 2cm. The reconstruction to be offered here varies between 6i and 69 letters per line, or, counting iota as half a letter, between 58 and 64 5. The letters are carefully cut with no remarkable features except the rather wide omega: there are slight apices but no ligatures. The four fragments can be enumerated as follows, from left to right: A. 'Appovia (newspaper of Smyrna), 4 November I895 (non vidi), whence Ath. Mitt. 20 (I895), 503; KP fr. a. Seen by KP ' im Magazin des Schischik-Oglu Mehmed Effendi '; presumably lost. Broken to r., 1., and below. o * 8o (height), o 36 (width), 0 * 27 (thickness).

Broken to r., 1., and below. o 84 (height), 0. 5I (width), 0 22 (thickness). Contains lines I-20; in lines 8, Io, and I3-20 joins with A; in the other lines the gap is never wider than five letters.

There is a join with B in line 6; in the other lines the gap ranges from one to four letters; on the gap between C and D, see below. D. A. Fontrier, Movu. :uvpv. I876-8 (publ.

Seen by KP 'im Magazin des Kleanthes Gasasoglu' and presumably lost. Broken all around. 0o35 (maximum height), S344 (maximum width), OIZ (maximum thickness).13 To the left, if the supplements proposed below are correct, the interval between C and D varies from one letter (line 8) to four (line 9). Though the stone is broken along a line parallel with the r.h. margin, the number of letters missing on the right seems usually to vary from three (lines 7, Io, i i) to seven (line 3); with the same proviso about the present supplements, the minimum would be as little as zero (line 4), and it would have to follow that the mason had left very large blanks at the end of some lines. These four fragments all begin at or near the top of a single plaque, yet they clearly continue a text beginning on an earlier one. This first part must have been long enough to indicate the circumstances of the foundation, to list the members of the association, if TrPOYEypapxI4Evcv is correctly restored in lines I7-I8, and also to contain the regulations which the sanctions in lines I-7 are designed to protect: by contrast, the last surviving 11 Robert, Le Sanctuaire de Sinuri pres de Mylasa, MWm. de l'Inst. Franc. d'Arch. de Stamboul 7 (I945), IO and n. 3: ' plusieurs fois deux fragments se raccordent exactement, qui ont et decrits, l'un comme blanc, l'autre comme bleuatre ou gris '. 12 From the material supplied by Georg Rehren- bock, it emerges that KP also had access to a copy published in Honieros S (I877), iso (non vidi): from the fact that they do not cite it, I presume that it too is due to Fontrier. 13 That is, the maximum thickness is identical to that of C.</page><page sequence="4">A DEED OF FOUNDATION II9 clause looks like a postscript or codicil. There may therefore have been two plaques of roughly equal size, of which the present was the second, and they were presumably set into a wall of the heroon. This stood in or near the ancient village whose site is now occupied by Tire; since this was on the territory of Ephesos, the inscription presupposes Ephesian institutions. Peplos was presumably a wealthy Ephesian who had an estate somewhere in the vicinity and built his family tomb there. Another prominent Ephesian of the early third century also had estates in the area and took an active part in village politiCs.14 Further away, one Epicrates of Nacrason in north-western Lydia, approximately a contemporary of Peplos, had his will inscribed on stelai which formed part of his elaborate family monument, and this too seems to have stood on one of his country estates.15 Though KP correctly recognized the first seven lines as a penalty-clause,16 the new fragment shows that they erred on one important point. Evidently starting from the restoration already made by the first editor of fragment A, Eav BE Eri Pa[?], they under- stood the following sentence to refer to the introduction of an unauthorized body into the tomb. The psephisma was thus a decree of Peplos' association permitting this infraction, and those liable to the penalties were the other members; the citizenry of Ephesos was involved only if these failed to punish one of their own. It will emerge that, as in the foundation of Salutaris though even more exclusively, the penalties are aimed at the magistrates of Ephesos. I give in full the equivalent passage in the foundation of Salutaris," and then turn to consider Peplos' sanctions clause by clause (for text see p. 125). p6EVi6?

Lines I-2. Funerary inscriptions do frequently forbid the introduction of strange corpses, and E-tPaiAco is one of the words used.'8 The absence of an object, however, is strange, and the parallels suggest a conditional clause expressing an idea common in deeds of foundation, ' if anyone tries '. In the passage cited from Salutaris' foundation, this idea is expressed by a participle, 6o Trapao-as (line 32I): but elsewhere in the same foundation the conditional appears, ?i 8E TIS TMElpaeEfi crcDcoov in JUVVPOVAEOcai Tl TOIOUTOV, KTA.

'9 In the foundation of Peplos, the same idea can be expressed by restoring, not E3rPaQ[Au], but E'Tl&amp;a[A-Tra]120 ' if he tries '; the brachylogy, which is as normal in Greek as in English,2' must refer to actions described in the immediately preceding lines. The verb i-riPoAAcEaea is found in this sense within a comparatively restricted period of time. The first examples are apparently in the decrees inserted into Demosthenes' De corona, which are now recognized as Hellenistic compositions perhaps of about 200 B.C.22 The verb is 14 Robert, AJP I00 (I979), 158 n. 25, discussing KP, Dritter Bericht no. i I6 (IGR iv, I662; I.

JONES found with the same sense in Polybius and in inscriptions from the early second century B.C. down to the beginning of the Christian era: the latest example I have noticed is from A.D. 38, so that the present inscription is presumably the last in the series.'3 The same verb is found precisely in the penalty clause of one of the great foundations of Antiochus I of Commagene about 40 B.C.: OJTis 5' Gav 8laTatECOS TQa\Trs 8\Jvaplv iEpav . . .

It is not necessary, as they assumed, for the TO p?v of line i to be followed by a TO 5?, since in Hellenistic and later prose pE'v can be answered by Kai' and not 5?: 25 moreover, KP were forced by their assumption to exceed the normal length of line. Comparison with analogous texts suggests that 'VTrEvavTiov was followed by a participle agreeing with yflyicpa in line 2. Thus in a decree of Chios regulating an epidosis, [Eav 5 -ris y]pafyn iP pvTaVis iTpo[]}I [TraTr ?iS aA]Ao Ti P[ETEVEyKEIV T) KaTa[XpT1cYacYli] i lTrot1l Tis Ti Trapa T6ro TO [)1PlOpa, TO] T? yppaEV T 1paX8EV aKVpOV [E,TTc.

The participle here was presumably either yEvOPEvov or yEypacppEvov. The next words should have referred to the foundation itself: [TaQXT1p T1r 8laTatEl] produces a line of satisfactory length, but is not certain. The order is contorted, article, adverb,27 participle, noun dependent on the adverb, subject-noun, but these contortions of participial phrases are characteristic of Hellenistic prose.28 Lines 2-3. The construction of the next clause, from Ka' &amp;TroTElOQTCO in 2 to ,ip1a in 4, was seen by KP, and fragment C necessitates only minor adjustments. Since four letters are missing between B and C in line i, and three in line 3, [o TO]1JTO seems assured: [O TOIO]TO would probably also require a following Ti. As already observed, the next word began with pi rho followed by an oblique stroke interpreted in I. Ephesos as alpha: this is in fact the only possible letter permitted in this combination. qTpa&amp;tas seems evident, as in a funerary inscription from the Cilbiani further up the Maeander valley, ?i 8[E PT, 6] TO[UTO] irp&amp;ga; 'UrOKEiJETQl [ ]OSOUVQl El TOV piCov Sl[v&amp;plQ] ~3p'.29 At the end of the line, TrpOCKOCV[&gt;PTC1V] was apparently not a knowrNn Greek word before it was supplied by Fontrier here. The handbooks cite it only from this inscription and from two passages of the foundation of Salutaris, where it is again restored. In twzro of the three examples, including the present one, the commoner Trpo9Ko6o[&gt;pTpa] can be read equally well,30 and in the third [E'TrK]6OC7rCTV or perhaps [K]6i.Pirlv.31 The following word, as several passages in the foundation of Salutaris show, should probably not be vaoiu but TTIs or teas.32 23 Polybius: Mauersberger, Polybios-Lexikon s.v. l\r?pco II 4 A; note especially I i. 8.

With this use of &amp;A?'Sa may be compared the passage already cited from the foundation of Salutaris, FrT (vapta) 5ioYPv'pta iTEvTraKICYXEIXIa KaX E?iS TOV TOU XEEaooOU picKov a?Aa 6r (vapta) (25,000), though here the second sum goes to the fiscus.39 It is difficult to estimate the gravity of the fine stipulated by Peplos, 20,000 denarii, since the precise date of the foundation is unknown and figures from other cities may not be comparable. The fine laid down by Salutaris, 5o,ooo denarii,40 is much higher, but probably involves a much more elaborate foundation. Thanks to the excellent indices of Rudolf Heberdey, it is possible to form a very complete idea of funerary language and practice at Greater Termessus in Pisidia.41 Although the majority of the known tombstones here are probably a century or more later than Peplos' heroon, out of the five hundred and fifty or so that specify fines for violation of the tomb the highest is of ioo,ooo denarii, and only fifteen (about 2 5%) are of 20,000 or more. Oi Trp?EGc7f3JEpol designates the gerousia of Ephesos. The term is used for this body in inscriptions of Ephesos itself and of other cities of the province of Asia.42 The purpose of directing half the fine to them is evidently to add a further deterrent to violation of Peplos' provisions; in the same way other foundations make the boutle the partial or the con- ditional beneficiary.43 Lines 4-5. It is here that the new fragment imposes the most important change in KP's text. Having taken the decree of line 2 as one passed by Peplos' association, they proposed that the fine be levied on the guilty member by ' those who share with him in the heroon'. The reading of the new fragment in line i, however, suggested that the ' decree ' was one of the city of Ephesos, as in the foundation of Salutaris, and that receives support from the new fragment in these lines: where KP restored the genitive TO-) flp OU, it produces the accusative [T]Ov EvtaIvJT[Ov]. Thereafter, there is space for only one or two letters before the -XoVTES of fragment D: there is just room for [&amp;ap]XOVTES, with Evia'vrO'S as usual designating the civil year.44 Trusts for which a city was responsible were notoriously liable to neglect or abuse.45 A vivid picture of civil mismanagement precisely at Ephesos is given by the decree of Paullus Fabius Persicus under Claudius: one of his reforms is 33 For the related but even more drastic mechanism of invoking the emperor's protection directly, see Rigsby and Herrmann (above, n.

JONES that ' money left to the city or to a collectivity or association within it shall be lent on the terms under which it was left, and not be diverted by the magistrates (Orro6 TCOV apXOVTCrOV) for other needs or expenses '.46 The situation envisaged by Peplos appears to be one mentioned several times in Hellenistic inscriptions but not, to my knowledge, in later ones. If the magistrates or commissioners charged with the maintenance of a foundation colluded to break the terms, redress might not be available until their successors had entered office. When Attalus II gives Delphi a large sum to fund the education of young boys, the city sets up a board of epimeletes to administer the revenues; if the commissioners of any year do not hand over the amount due to the city within the prescribed period, they are disqualified from further office, and their successors are to inscribe ' them for one and a half times the amount due (aTltol ATaoypaqpEvTcO aTro TCA)V E1T&lt;txaacOTaeEVTC)V E1TTIVEXraV iTOT' cITO KcXl TO #6Av10).47 A decree of Thasos early in the third century, though not concerned with a foundation, has a series of mechanisms against repeal which closely resembles the present document. Anyone trying to subvert the terms of the decree shall pay a fine of a thousand staters to Apollo and of the same amount to the city, and the proposal shall be invalid; the apologoi are to prosecute, and if they fail to act will become liable to the fine themselves, and the apologoi elected after them (oi JE-rTa TouToUS caipEeEVTES) are to prosecute; so also may anyone else who wants to (o E`E\cAv), and if a private citizen prosecutes successfully he is to receive half the fine.48 With the ' magistrates of the following year ' is to be joined someone else, 6 -ra[ ---]a- . The first alpha was read both by the first editor and by KP, though KP's facsimile and the photograph show it to be very uncertain; their calculation of about ten lost letters looks correct. 6 Tra[pa TOUTCvc yvux]at, however, cannot be right now that the new fragment has eliminated the heroon to which TOXJTCO referred. Guardians of tombs are often mentioned in foundations, but only as watchmen: 49 that one should be entrusted with the prosecution of city-magistrates seems inconceivable. qxAcax or a compound of it, however, looks right, and it is tempting to suspect a reference to the paraphylax, who was a civilian officer charged with maintaining the peace of the territory, and is known in many cities of southern Asia Minor; in decrees his name sometimes follows that of the magistrates, as here.50 There happens to be a graphic representation of this functionary on a relief found some 20 kilometres south-east of Tire: he is shown mounted and accompanied by three sub- ordinates on foot, who are probably diogmitai.5' The paraphylax is frequently mentioned in inscriptions of Ephesos, with his title sometimes qualified with the genitives TTlS EIpT1VT1S or Tns Xc?pas.52 He would have been a suitable person for Peplos to invoke as a protector of his richly appointed heroon far from the city. To read TTa[paq]c]a, however, would require an extremely long gap at the end of line C: 6 Tra[p' aXCIToTs yc]ax, with the demon- strative pronoun referring to the magistrates, has been suggested to me, but the prefix -rcapa- in this word seems not to signify addition or accompaniment but watchfulness 'over' something. Lines 5-7. The restorations of KP in the sentence Eav 8EU . . . Xp'ThS are precisely confirmed by fragment C. The invitation to ' anyone who wishes' to prosecute has already been seen in the Hellenistic decree of Thasos, and is regular in foundations and bans on tomb-violation.53 The refinement, 'whether citizen or stranger', seems by contrast rare in such contexts, though common enough in others.54 The only similar provision I have noticed is again in the foundation of Aromation of Gytheum, which orders that ' anyone who wishes either of the Greeks or the Romans ' (TC5 OVOUkOIEVCA Kai 'E NNvCAv KaiX 'PcoPaicov) may prosecute the city for neglect.55 The proportion to be paid to the successful 46 I.

The extant clauses stipulate that the resulting decree shall be invalid, and the proposer shall be fined a total of 20,ooo drachmai; the fine is to be levied by the magistrates of the subsequent year and (perhaps) the paraphylax; if these fail to act, they shall be liable in turn, and may be prosecuted by anyone who wishes; if successful, he will receive half the sum awarded. Logic seems to require that the anticipated transgressors be only the magistrates, and not both magistrates and private persons, as in the foundation of Salutaris and usually. With this difference the corresponding clauses of Salutaris' foundation give an approximate guide to what preceded the conditional here: [wEvi bE a6E Co QapXovT1 Tj EK6iKCO 1TEiwpacQaL TrapEupCEaE PT18EPI( iT'iTE ?ETaeE?1Vai pITE iTpacAa'Ca Ti T-C)V UTtO TOIo 1ThT\U 51v8TaTCEVaypEVMV "T?TE E? y cYcaa1i Ti TO1OUT0V-] Eav 5E T-riS ElTlfp[AfTal], KTk Salutaris' foundation is also a guide to the juridical status of the document embodied in the present inscription. His dossier includes several documents, the principal ones being respectively a decree of Ephesos accepting the foundation, the deed itself cast in the form of a proposal to the civic authorities, and supporting letters from the proconsul and his legate. Of the four, it is the second that contains the most detail about the founda- tion, for example, an inventory of the statues to be given, and as here Salutaris is spoken of in the third person.58 The amount of detail in the present document suggests that it too is a deed in the form of a proposal to the city, no doubt made after much prior negotiation.59 The foundation of Flavius Praxias is similar, and there too Praxias is referred to in the third person, though ratification by the city is not recorded in a separate decree but merely noted at the end: 60 the same could have been done for Peplos. Lines 7-9. The sentence introducing the list of objects preserved in the heroon was again essentially restored by KP, and only verbal changes are necessary. In line 7, there no longer seems to be room for TO'rrco before TC- Tpcxp ; the phrase ?V (?-fi) T-5 'pc 4X also occurs in lines 9 and I4. In line 8, where KP hesitantly proposed TOC' [TrEpiEi-rrvoU], ' the funeral dinner ', fragment C preserves Q17-MO with part of a following upsilon just visible: to the left of the omega only about two letters appear to be missing. There seems no alternative to the very rare [rlp]coia'poO. However, the change is satisfactory, since the members of the association are herostai (line 2o), and the objects in the following list (portraits, sun-dial, and the like) seem to concern all aspects of the cult of the deceased and not merely the commemorative banquet.6' I have not found another example of lipcoicaios other than the one given by Liddell and Scott, but that one is satisfactory: a fragment from the large heroon at Mytilene which is usually thought to commemorate the famous Potamo, and so to belong to the reign of Tiberius; the word is here spelled with an omicron, but the difference is merely phonetic.62 Lines 8-9. ITEpiypacpr' seems a less usual word for ' list ' than aTToypacpT1 which I have accordingly restored: ypaci is also possible. Line 9. The Kxai following flTis seems to be merely pleonastic, as in line 7, and does not need to be translated ' also '.f3 Nevertheless, it is still implied that the same list had already been inscribed at the heroon before the present document was drawn up: no doubt 56 TAM III, I, p. 356. 57 LSJ s.v.

JONES it was on one of the ' inscribed stelai ' which the list itself mentions among the appurtenances of the heroon (line I S).64 The list itself is not affected by fragment C. Though this is the only inventory of objects contained in a heroon, other inscriptions list the sacred objects given by benefactors for the cult of gods or kings.65 KP observed that it seems to be drawn up by the material of the objects, at least after the mention of portraits at the beginning: marble and other stone (lines io-i6), metal (lines i6-I7), and finally wood (line I7). Inventories of temple- property in Egypt tend to be similarly arranged: thus in one from Oxyrhynchus under Caracalla, statues come first, then objects in gold, silver, bronze, wood, and cloth, and finally miscellaneous items.66 Lines 9-IO. KP are surely right that the words after yparrTac are names in the genitive. Of the first, only NON is visible in the photograph: KP read NONH, with the last two letters in ligature, but there are no other ligatures in the inscription. A name beginning Novv- may be suspected, for example, Novv[ias TT]aC'ArTs: a newly published inscription of Ephesos reveals a Nonnia married to a Flavius and clearly in the upper class of the city.67 Line io. KP understood ~cW'ia to refer to reliefs. ~cW'iov is first applied to an artistic representation by Herodotos describing the ' figures ' around the rim of a crater, and here reliefs, though not necessarily only of animals, are meant.68 Later the word either can or must designate free-standing, anthropomorphic statues ranging in size from figurines to colossi.69 A ' figure ' or ' figurine ' seems to be meant in an inscription of the third century A.D. from Egypt, in which a man dedicates a shrine and a ~cW'iov of his wife.70 The same sense may be surmised in an inscription of Ephesos mentioning a gateway [ocriv 1TTavTl TCA) AEU[KO]UOCD K007PCp Kai gc8iOIS y[EEAu w?VOls].71 At Tire the contrast may be between painted portraits of the deceased and sculpted ones: similarly, when Epicteta mentions Ta Cc5ia (pictures) Kaii TOS av8plcaVTrs Eav(JTOri TE (her late husband) Kal Kpa-rTcIYXAXou (her late son), the genitives appear to refer to both the accompanying nouns.7' 'Appo8ElalaKa, as KP saw, refers to the celebrated marble and workmanship of Aphrodisias in Caria.73 Line i6. The noun a&amp;KOVTLOYTfPES seems to occur only here: it may designate 'jets' or ' spouts ', since the next item is ' pipes ' or pumps '74 Lines I8-I9. KP's restoration of the relative clause is unconvincing. At seventy letters the line is too long, and TO q)iAavepcprrov is uncomfortably vague, since it can hardly refer to the privilege of line 6. It is tempting to follow it with some dependent phrase as TflS TOt' rlocAlPWOii ,1ETOVUCias, and to make it the subject of the verb ending -aK-rai: since the whole document has the form of a deed of foundation (ia'&amp;ra~is), the vterb may well be [8laTE']aKTal, which is regularly used with the dative.75 The whole line would then have sixty-four letters. Line i8 again has seventy in KP's restoration, even if the three blank ones are discounted: the removal of the TlVa would suffice, but any restoration must be conjectural. Line 20.
