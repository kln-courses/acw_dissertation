Il existe dans l'art et le folklore aléoutien des motifs reliés au folklore eskimo, dont quelques-uns se retrouvent dans la Chine ancienne. L'auteur documente ces motifs et s'in- téresse particulièrement à deux d'entre eux : l'origine de l'espèce humaine à partir d'un chien et le bourdon. Elle analyse le corpus folklorique ainsi que les références aux tradi- tions folkloriques des Aléoutes à la fin du 18e siècle et au début du 19e pour montrer comment la filiation et les contacts historiques peuvent expliquer l'apparition des mêmes motifs dans l'héritage culturel des Aléoutes et des Inuit. ABSTRACT: Eskimo motifs in Aleut art and folklore The occurrence in Aleut art and folklore of motifs associated with Eskimo folklore, some of which can be traced to ancient China, is documented. The primary focus is on two motifs: the origin of humans from a dog and the bumblebeé. The existing folklore corpus and references to folklore traditions held by Aleuts in the late 18th and early 19th centu- ries are analyzed to show genetic and contact-historical bases for motif co-occurrence in Eskimo and Aleut cultural heritages. Methodological note For the purposes of this essay, both folklore and art are defined functionally, following the description of folklore offered by Bascom (1953), which is here re- phrased as follows: folklore and art serve to sanction and validate religious, social, political, and economic institutions, and play an important role as educative devices in their transmission from one generation to another.1 The term folklore is taken to refer to oral traditions handed down over time not only in structured forms such as narratives, songs, or proverbs, but also in in- * Providence College, Providence R.I., U.S.A. 1 For more detailed definitions of functions of folklore see also Bascom 1954. ÉTUDES/INUIT/STUDIES, 1983, Vol. 7 N° 1 3</page><page sequence="2">formal statements by informants which pertain to their group's belief and value systems and concern symbolic vehicles: such as the bumblebee which stands for power (see below). The term art is taken to refer to visual symbols and representations, either three-dimensional, such as sculpture (subsuming carved, incised, and engraved objects) or flat art (subsuming painting, embroidery, basketry etc.) It is taken for an axiom that motifs central to belief and value systems per- taining to eidos and ethos of the group, will have great longevity and that their expression in visual symbols may be encountered even when the notions are not clearly articulated and/or not expressed in structura! folkloristic forms. It is assumed that visual symbols of such notions may persist when the notions them- selves have been rejected or suppressed on conscious level and hence "purged" from verbal representations. Therefore, absence of certain notions or ideas in folklore collected relatively recently is not considered as proof that such notions were absent in earlier times. Introduction Aleut art and folklore are very imperfectly known. With respect to art a modest beginning recently made by Ray (1981) has been followed by my own study (Black 1982). Folklore remains terra incognita . No analysis of the available folkloristic corpus, to be discussed in detail below, has ever been attempted, much less a comparative study of Aleut folklore in relation to other Alaskan Inuit, and North Pacific rim folk traditions in general. The available texts all date from the twentieth century. None can be consid- ered truly mythological, with the exception of the legend on the origin of sea otters, which is outside the scope of this essay. In respect to thematic content superficial perusal permits the following observations: 1) In distinction from Inuit folklore, Aleut corpus shows no evidence of the figure of Sedna - a female deity associated with the ocean and characterized as "mistress of sea animals"; 2) The origin of sea mammals is attributed to murder, usually by a human female or human male or males, with the exception of sea otters, who are a product of brother-sister incest. Whales are not included in this category. 3) Mention of whales is rare and less explicit than in Inuit folklore. In Inuit folk- lore, the whale figure rarely occurs, though the motif of human female-whale mating does occur. This motif has not been encountered in Aleut folklore. It is proposed that in both Inuit and Aleut worldview the whales may have occupied such an exalted place that mention in words was avoided. 4) The Big Raven motif is also rare and occurs only in tales collected in the West- ern Aleutians, on Attu Island (see discussion below). 5) The texts make no reference either to origin of humanity myths, and only tangentially to the bumblebee motif, specifically to the bumblebee as a symbol 4/L. T. BLACK</page><page sequence="3">of the power to kill. Nevertheless, data indicating that such concepts existed have been collected by more than one investigator (including myself) and are discussed in this essay. The origin traditions, as the following section on Aleut corpus will show, were recounted in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. These origin traditions clearly link Aleut folklore with Inuit folklore, as well as with ancient Chinese, early pre-Shang, folklore traditions. For this reason, these motifs have been singled out for more detailed discussion, and consti- tute the central topic of this essay. This essay cannot be considered a definitive analysis, but data and discussion presented herein are considered as basis for further research. It is believed that such research will shed a new light on Inuit/ Aleut relationship as well as on the origin of Eskaleut populations in general, and the possible links of such popula- tions in remote antiquity to ancient Chinese culture. Aleut folklore corpus The Aleut corpus folklore is meagre; much of it remains unpublished, some in the form of rough field notes scattered in various libraries and archives. Thus it is valuable to discuss the available folklore corpus here before examining the central topic of this essay. References to Aleut folkloristic notions are to be found as early as the late 18th century in reports of Russian merchant-skippers, and scientific investiga- tors; however, these do not constitute folkloristic texts. The first systematic folk- lore collection was undertaken only toward the middle of the 19th century by two scholar-priests, Ioann Veniaminov for the eastern Aleutians (Fox Islands)2 and Iakov Netsvetov for the central Aleutians (Andreanov Islands)3. Unfortunately, 2 Ivan Evseevich Veniaminov-Popov was the first resident parish priest to serve the Unalashka District of the Russian American Company. He served there from 1824-1834. His parish encompass- ed the eastern Aleutians, from Umnak to the Shumagin Islands, Alaska Peninsula, and the Pribilof Islands. In 1840, Veniaminov became a monk, was consecrated bishop and assigned to serve as the first Bishop of the newly established diocese of Kamchatka, the Aleutian and the Kurile Islands. Still later, he became archbishop of Kamchatka, with his see at Yakutsk, and then Metropolitan of Moscow and Kolomna, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church. Recently, he has been recognized as a Saint of the Church, and is now venerated as St. Innocent of the Aleutians. In addition to his two major works cited in this essay, he wrote many arcticles on a variety of topics, ranging from the description of fur seals and arguments for sea mammal conservation, to the history of orthodox Missions in Alaska and Eastern Siberia. His scholastic achievement was widely recognized in his own time. 3 Iakov Egorovich Netsvetov was the son of a Russian fur hunter and an Aleut woman. He was born in the islands, possibly on the Island of St. George and grew up there. Educated privately, by one of the fur hunters on St. George, he entered Irkutsk Seminary, and was consecrated priest - the first Alaska native to achieve this status - in 1828. He was assigned as the first resident priest to the Atkha District of the Russian American Company where he served until 1844. His parish encompassed the Andreanov Islands, the Rat Islands, Near Islands, the Commanders and the Northern Kuriles. In 1845, he was assigned as the first missionary to the Alaskan Interior and Norton Sound region. He founded the Ikogmiut or Kvikhpak Mission on the Yukon. He died at Sitka in 1864 and is buried there. He wrote several compositions of spiritual and moralistic content in Atkan Aleut, translated Gospels and adapted Veniaminov's translation thereof to Atkan Aleut, and compiled an extensive Atkan Aleut vocabulary (Netsvetov ms.). ESKIMO MOTIFS/5</page><page sequence="4">the fieldnotes of these men have never been located, and their work is known to us only through Veniaminov's publications (specifically, Veniaminov 1840, 1846), which respectively provide the cornerstones for ethnographic and linguistic stu- dies of the Aleutians. In his 1840 work, Veniaminov defined three narrative genres for eastern Aleut folklore, reproducing in Russian translation a text in each genre, as well as several songs, given both in the original eastern (Fox) Aleut dialect and in Rus- sian translation. In his 1846 publication, entitled An Experiment in Fox-Aleut Gram- mar, he attempted to analyze the structure of eastern Aleut songs; here he re- produced additional examples, including ten songs collected, transcribed in Aleut, and translated into Russian, by the Aleut Semeon Ivanovich Paďkov of Akun Island. In addition, Veniaminov published an excerpt with Russian transla- tion from an original Aleut composition by Ivan Kurbatov, Aleut resident of the Belkofski settlement, Alaska Penninsula, which was written in 1829. Kurbatov, said Veniaminov, had completed a book length manuscript by 1834 which is now lost (see Veniaminov 1980 : 2 : 278-305; 1846 : 85-87 and 1846 : 113-120). Information on Atkan folklore and Atkan texts with Russian translations, collected by Netsvetov, are contained in volume 3, part 1 of Veniaminov's 1840 work. Two narratives and several songs are presented.4 The next effort at systematic gathering of folklore data took place better than half a century later, by the Russian ethnographer Vladimir IFich IokheFson (Waldemar Jochelson) who headed an anthropological investigating team spon- sored by the Russian Imperial Geographical Society and financed by the Ria- bushinsky brothers in 1909-1910. IokheFson collected at least 142 texts (IokheF- son 1918), obtained from Attu in the western Aleutians, Atka in the central Aleu- tians, and Umnak and Unalaska in the eastern Aleutians as well as several tales on St. Paul Island in the Pribylovs. A small fraction of this material was published by IokheFson himself (1915, 1918, 1923, 1933) and additional narratives have been published by others, in a new transcription (Bergsland 1959, 1977) or in paraphrase (Hudson 1975).5 Some of IokheFson's material has been lost or is only preserved in various archives in the USSR and thus access to it is difficult. A considerable number of texts, however, have found their way into the holdings of the New York Public Library;6 none of these are from Atka, and only very few are from Attu. The 4 Additional data on folklore are to be found scattered throughout this work. Several allusions to Atkan folkloristic notions can also be found in Netsvetov 1980. 5 Hudson's charming rendering perhaps ought to be considered an original work, a variation on themes of Aleut folklore, and not as a bona fide example of such. 6 Not all material in the holdings of New York Public Library pertains to the Aleutians, and not all was received at the same time. The Aleutian linguistic materials and texts were prepared for publi- cation in English by Iokhel'son and the manuscript transmitted to Boas for final editing prior to pub- lication. Boas delayed the completion of the work, and it was never published. Finally, in 1943, long after Iokhel'son's death, the manuscript was offered by Boas to the New York Public Library. It is described by Yarmolinsky (1944). It may be that Boas' handling of Iokhel'son's work played a role in 6/L. T. BLACK</page><page sequence="5">majority come from Umnak and Unalaska Islands in the eastern Aleutians. For these texts, Iokhel'son himself supplied English interlineal glosses and free translations. Iokhel'son confirmed Veniaminov's classification of Aleut narratives into three genres and provided native terms for each (Iokhel'son 1933 : 75). Later, after Iokhel'son's death, Roman Jakobson classified and made an inventory of the texts, using Iokhel'son's definitions for the native categories. Jakobson assigned the majority of the texts to a native genre termed Unikax (sin- gular), which Iokhel'son had defined as 'a tale of mythological content, on animal protectors, guardians, and other supernatural beings". I must note here that this definition does not correspond to glosses of this term offered earlier by Venia- minov (1846) and by Netsvetov (ms.)7. Iokhel'son's definition is presumably bas- ed on explanations offered by his informants. As such explanations were offered in the context of changed attitudes and interpretations of traditional lore (in 1909- 1910 compared to Netsvetov's and Veniaminov's data drom the early 19th cen- tury) they may be considered emic. Jacobson's classification, however, is etic. No emic classification of the* tales collected by Iokhel'son exists. In addition to narra- tives, Iokhel'son's manuscript materials in the New York Public Library contain several songs and also letters written in Aleut to Iokhel'son by one of his field assistants and principal informants, Leontii Sivtsev, deacon of the Unalaska Church. Two sets of narratives are of particular interest to us here: the tales from Attu, told by two brothers, Filaret and Stepan Golodov, and the tales told by an old blind Aleut of Unalaska, Isidor Solovyev8, who, Iokhel'son seems to indicate, was an the decision by Iokhel' son's niece-by-marriage and heir to return the rest of his papers to the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. At least part of these papers, it appears, have been turned over to the USSR, in 1944, via the USSR consulate in New York, but a part was deposited in the New York Public Library. 7 The term unikax is glossed by Veniaminov as a just-so tale ļpobasenka, anekdoty 1846 : 64/ Nets- vetov, for Atkan, glosses this term as a table, fairy tale / shazka /. This gloss is confirmed by Bergsland for Atkan who identifies the meaning as "story, fiction" (1980 : 154). The texts collected by Iokhel'son from "Umnak Chief Ivan Suvorov" were recently published by Bergsland in a new transcription under the tide Unangam Ungiikangin-Aleut Traditions.. . Ungiikangin (traditions) is a term that does not appear in other sources. With respect to the two other terms given by Iokhel'son, I cannot find a corresponding term either in Veniaminov or in Netsvetov. Yorkadañadax /kadangadax/, glossed by Iokhel'son as meaning "ancient stories, concerning wonderful warriors, strong men and powerful chiefs", there is no exact equivalent in Eastern Aleut data though Veniaminov's vocabulary contains a term kadángin glossed as meaning "peoples of former times, ancestors" (1846 : 36). In Atkan Netsvetov (ms.) gives the term maqaxtaqas /plural/ glossed as historical narratives / istorila /. This term is confirmed by Bergsland who entitled the historical accounts of the Atkans Niiģiģus Maqaxtazaqangis (Bergsland 1976 and 1979). Iokhel' son's term tunúsax or tunusádax (1933 : 75) glossed as "narrative on the former or present life of the Aleut" corresponds to Veniaminov's term tunusyaq for eastern Aleut, glossed as "news", or "narration" /legend, in original vest;skazanie/ (Veniaminov 1846 : 59) and to Atkan tunuzas, var .tunum- kas glossed as "news" / vestii by Netsvetov (ms.). Bergsland confirms the latter forms, giving tunuzas c, plural tunuzas - news" (1980 : 144). 8 I retain Iokhel'son's spelling of the name. ESKIMO MOTIFS/7</page><page sequence="6">official story teller. Only the Attuan tales, in the entire Iokhel'son corpus, contain the motif of the Big Raven. Here, the Big Raven is, in at least one tale, associated with the killing of whales. The tales narrated by Isidor Solovyev are of interest because, Iokhel'son tells us in a footnote, they contain many archaisms not only in language but also in the notions expressed. It is one of these archaic tales which contains the motif of the bumblebee in association with power and the ability to kill whales.9 After Iokhel'son's sojourn in the Aleutians, little systematic attention was paid to folklore: several individuals, however, have collected considerable Aleut materials. Jay Ellis Ransom, an M. A. in anthropology trained in linguistics by Melville Jacobs, amassed a number of tales and other materials while serving as a teacher at the village school in Nikolski on Umnak Island in the late 1930's and later as a participant in several expeditions organized and led by the late T. P. Bank II. Ransom published little, focusing mainly on acculturation and new inventions (Ransom 1941, 1945, 1946). His field notes have been recently deposit- ed at the Suzzallo Library, University of Washington, Seattle (Ransom, personal communication) . Charles I. Shade, a member of the 1948 Peabody Museum of Harvard Uni- versity expedition to the Aleutians also collected a number of folkloristic accounts at Nikolski. His field notes were placed in the Peabody Museum but now cannot be found, and are presumed to have been lost. John P. Harrington, Smithsonian Institution, worked in the late 1930's and early 1940's on Unalaska and on St. Paul in the Pribilofs. He obtained a number of narrative texts from his principal informant, Ivan Alexeevich Yatchemeneff (son of Iokhel'son's principal assistant, the chief of Unalaska village) and from Alek- sandra Gromoff of St. Paul. The data obtained from the latter may be translations of texts recorded in English by Frederica B. Martin.10 In addition to these collections, I must mention the work of the famous Amer- ican historian, Frank A. Golder, who collected Aleut folklore between 1899-1902. In this period, Golder served as teacher, first in the village school on Unga (Shu- magin Islands), then at Belkofski on the Alaska Peninsula.11 He communicated with the Aleuts in Russian, and it is to be presumed that he obtained the texts (which he published in English) in that language, though we cannot exclude the possibility that some texts were written out in Aleut by Golder's informants. One 9 It should be noted, that several early observers including Veniaminov (1840) remarked that Aleuts eagerly listened not only to Aleut but also to Russian stories. In my opinion several Russian elements are to be found in narratives told by Isidor Solovyev (and others). One such example is his use of the "living" and "dead water" /zhivaia i mertvaia voda/ and repetition of an action thrice. Incor- poration of Russian folklore motifs, particularly of Russian fairy tale themes, into Alaskan folklore, but especially into the Aleut folklore, has been documented (Richard A. Dauenhauer, personal com- munication). 10 Information courtesy of the staff, National Anthropological Archives, Smithsonian Institu- tion and by Ms. Elaine L. Mills, editor and project director, for reproduction of J. P. Harrington papers on microfilm, now available. Aleutian materials are reproduced on reels 1-9. 11 See Wachhold (1979) for an account of Golder's activities in Alaska. 8/L. T. BLACK</page><page sequence="7">text Golder published was told to him in English by a school boy. Golder's papers are on deposit at the Hoover Library, Stanford University, and, like the other collections mentioned above, await examination by specialists. In general, Gold- eťs published materials indicate that he was meticulous in recording the context of narration, variants, origin, residence, age and sex of informants (Golder 1905, 1907, 1909a and 1909b). In a special class are two tales, both from Umnak. One is known only in pub- lished English versions, first by Dall (1878) and later by Elliott (1882). This is a very circums tan tive account of the invention of mummified burials, attributed to a chief (in Elliott, a king) of Kagamil Island in late pre-contact or early contact times. Elliott implies that he obtained the account in 1874, when at his initiative Captain Hennig, an employee of the Alaska Commercial Company, removed thirteen mummies from the caves of Kagamil. Dall states that the account was written out in Russian (implying that it was done for him) by the parish priest of the Una- laska church, Father Innokentii Shaiashnikov, of Aleut origin. A search among DalFs papers in the Anthropological Archives of the Smithsonian Institution fail- ed to bring to light any such composition by Father Shaiashnikov. Subsequently the tale has been repeated many times by, among others, Iokhel'son (1925 : 45), and, most recently, Laughlin (1980). It has been used as evidence that mummifi- cation burials are recent, and it has even been stated that some of the dead were known by name to Umnak residents (Laughlin 1980). I find this account entirely at odds with the account of mummies given by Veniaminov (1840) and believe this to be an on-the-spot invention, perhaps created by Father Shaiashnikov himself to appease persistent questioner(s). By now, through reading of published works, recent mummification has been incorporated into local lore. The second tale is known in several versions, among them the earliest by Veniaminov (1840), one told by an Umnak elder Sergie Sovoroff (1976)/Sergei Suvorov/, and by Laughlin (1980), with a more elaborate one appearing in the USSR. This concerns a relic, believed to consist of a tree stump, presently preserv- ed under a special structure just outside the church yard at Nikolski. In Venia- minov's time this stump was lying in the open; even then, it was held to have super- natural power to harm those who touched it irreverently or had no authority to do so. Veniaminov stated that this stump was believed to be a remnant of a cross erect- ed on the beach in 1756 by Stepan Glotov, the first Russian to record his landfall at Umnak. A dictated description of the relic's (called ikax in Aleut) origin, by the Aleut elder Sergie Sovoroff reads: "I do not know if it is something good or evil because we do not know how it got there in the first place" (1976). Members of the Soviet archaeological team who participated in a season of field work at Umnak in 1974 under the leadership of Laughlin have published accounts of the legend promoting it to a "Tree of Life". Laughlin (1980) does not ESKIMO MOTIFS/9</page><page sequence="8">go so far, but calls the structure which houses the relic "Monument House", which: . . . marks and protects the stump of a tall pole that stood here when the first Russians arrived. It was so tall that a raven on top of it looked like a wren from the ground. The Russians chopped it down to make a house and all of them died as a consequence. Anyone who touches the house in the mood of challenge and disbelief will suffer fear- fully. . . legend has it that Nikolski will survive, and its Aleuts, as long as the pole stump remains (1980 : 138 and 139, fig. 51). The irreverent treatment of the remnant of the cross and consequent mortality of the Russian crew appears also in Veniaminov's and Sovoroff s accounts. The latter simply talks about the ikax (tree, wood). The tale may have an historical basis, with the most likely candidates for the act being the survivors of the shipwrecked vessel Sv. Zhivotvoriashchaia Troitsa , skippered by Ivan Korovin, who made camp in the locality (and died of scurvy and wounds inflicted by Aleuts) in the summer of 1764, following the outbreak of major Aleut/Russian hostilities in the entire east- ern area of the archipelago. The notion of the "Tree of Life" appears to be recent elaboration and it may not originate with the native informants. Nothing even remotely resembling such an idea can be found in any extant datum on Aleut traditions. In the absence of any supporting evidence I tend to regard the evolu- tion of this tale as an example of folklore-in-the-making, constituting a fascinat- ing, and very challenging topic unfortunately outside the scope of this essay. We shall therefore return to consideration of other, and much earlier, data on Aleut folklore traditions in which Aleut origins from a dog, the sacred lake of water which rejuvenates, the bumblebee associated with the killer whales, and the raven who kills whales, figure significantly. Origin legends, life eternal, and power to kill The first published record of any reference to the Aleut belief system, with specific allusion to if not the origin, at least the nature of the world's human popu- lation, has come down to us only in a synoptic, at best second-hand, form. This reference appears in the "Explanation" appended to the "Report of the Admiral- ty College About the Map by the Ustiug Merchant Shilov" of 23 February 1767. According to data in the "Explanation", Shilov was familiar with the Near and Andreanov Islands, having visited them at various times prior to 1764. However, he mapped the eastern islands on the basis of testimony by other fur hunters and from two Aleuts, one from Samalga Island, and one from Umnak Island. Thus one may assume that his information pertains to the western or central Aleutians: No divine services nor lawful rituals, such as for marriage, funerals or festival gather- ings have been observed during his sojourn there, except that the people have a regard for the sun and moon. They have no idea about other nations, except about their own neighbors, and believe that these are the sole inhabitants of the world (in Andreev 1948 : 176). 10/L. T. BLACK</page><page sequence="9">A second reference, again second-hand, is offered by Johann Gottlieb Georgi, in his composite work, "Description of All the Nations of the Russian Empire..." (1776-1780). As Georgi obtained his information about a decade be- fore or even earlier in Kamchatka, also from fur hunters and Aleuts brought there aboard the fur merchants' vessels, the composite account of the Aleut belief system he presents most likely is based on data for the western and central Aleu- tians also. He says, in part: At their festivals given when whale carcasses are cast ashore, they offer thanks to their Deities in songs for such bounty /luck/, but disguise this thanksgiving with various antics /Gauckeleyen/ accompanied by drumming, etc. When partaking of such bounty, they throw small bits of flesh into the fire as an offering. They give their dead, as do all shamanistic heathen, their utensils to take along for their needs in the other life. They have small wooden house idols which they smear with blood and fat and believe that they are fed by this. The fire-belching or smoking mountains /volcanos/ they hold to be the abode of deities and spirits, and their shamans or sorcerer-priests direct their prayers to them. They, however, do not expect or fear anything either from the future or from the Deities, neither their mercy nor their anger (1776-1780 : 3 : 373). From the other extreme of the Aleut settlement area, the Alaska Peninsula, we have the first report of what seems to be an historical tradition, obtained be- tween July 1775 and May 1779 by Navigator Zaikov, skipper of the vessel Sv. Vla- dimir (see Zaikov 1782 and Pallas 1782). Having his base camp in the Issanotski Strait (False Pass, the strait which separates Unimak Island and Alaska Peninsula) at St. Catherine's Cove, Zaikov travelled widely through the area, to the Shumagin Islands, Kodiak, Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound. It is not clear from the published version, much abridged and worked over, if the traditions he reports were obtained from the Alaska Peninsula Aleuts or from their Yup'ik speaking neighbors who occupied the eastern end of the peninsula. In any case this tradi- tion, very different from the historical traditions later reported by members of the Billings/Sarychev expedition (see below) and by Veniaminov (in fact almost the exact opposite of the latter), states the following: The senior and best men of the American Cape Aliaksa assert that the Aleuts have descended from them and that in ancient times /the latter/ wilfully occupied all the islands even to the very nearest to Kamchatka, that is Attu and Agattu. With respect to religion, the report does not contain much information except to mention masked festivals during wintertime, when wooden idols in the shape of humans, birds, and animals were also made (Zaikov 1782 and 1790 : 159). Somewhat more circumstantial accounts of Aleut mythological traditions, including the origin from a dog, are found in the reports of the Billings/Sarychev expedition of 1785-1793. The archival materials (in the USSR) of this under- taking have never been examined in full, and published reports (Billings, see Tito- va, compiler 1978 and Divin, editor 1979; Sauer 1802; Sarychev 1802; Sarychev 1811 for materials on the cruise of the Chernyi Orel under Gall /Robert Hall/; Merck 1937 and 1980) contain abridged data. Of these, only three (Billings, Sary- ESKIMO MOTIFS/11</page><page sequence="10">chev 1802, and Merck 1937 and 1980) contain data on folklore, the account by Sarychev being the most detailed and reliable.12 In all three accounts, we find the mention of human origin from a dog. Billings (Titova 1978 : 44; Divin 1979 : 379) noted: On ancestors /progenitors/: The Unalashkans say that the first man and the first woman descended from a bitch /otsukiļ. This happened in the west and when the land was filled with people Inarodl , their descendants /descendants of the first pair/, many persons llyudil went eastward to seek for themselves a better land; thus all the neigh- boring islands, the land of Alaska and lands beyond it, were filled with inhabitants. Merck (1937, 1980) obtained his information with the aid of the one of the expe- dition's two physicians, Robeck (who engaged in linguistic investigations, collect- ing standard vocabulary according to a chart designed by Pallas), and through an Aleut interpretor who spoke Russian, Mikhail Lavrenťevich Milko v of Umnak Island. Merck wrote: Of their origin the Aleuts relate the following: a dog /Hund, may be of either gender/ came to these islands from the west and gave birth to a Being which in the front /upper?/ part resembled a human, but in the back /lower part?/ was hairy. From it they all trace their descent. Others say that a dog I Hund I descended from the sky /heaven, Himmel / at the westernmost point of the island of Umnak, and gave birth first to two beings somewhat resembling humans. Their descendants, in time, came to resemble humans more and more and finally assumed totally human appearance. As eventual- ly there came to be too many people, this gave cause for wars, and for this reason they spread through the islands; in time, they assumed the tribal names /Stammensnamen/ Kaualand, Sassignan, and Negjo /sic, 1937 : 124-125/. Sarychev also reports the legend of the origin from a dog: I was assured by a second tale that all Aleuts are descended from a dog Isobaka, may be of either gender/ which fell from the sky /heaven, s nebal onto the Island of Umnak and gave birth to two infants, of male and female sex respectively, who both had dog's 12 It is useful to consider the time of residence in the Aleutians of each author. The expedition, authorized in 1785, travelled to Okhotsk where ships were to be built. Slava Rossii, Billings flagship, was launched in 1789 and sailed to Kamchatka where the expedition wintered and where the second vessel, Chemyi Orel (Gall commanding) was constructed (launched in 1791). On May 9 1790 Slava Rossii sailed for the American coasts, returning to Kamchatka in October of that year. En route, June 1-14 was spent at Unalaska. Sailing again in April 1791, Slava Rossii followed the Aleutian chain, visiting several inhabited islands. Upon reaching Unalaska, after a very brief stay Billings turned north, sailing toward the Bering Strait. There he and his party, including Merck and Sauer, remained to investigate the Chukchi Peninsula, while the ship, under Sarychev's command returned to Unalaska. Here Sary- chev was joined by Gall, and both vessels wintered in Captain's Bay at Unalaska. The next year, 1792, both vessels returned to Kamchatka. Thus, Sarychev's stay was the longest. As he was charged with mapping of the area, he travelled widely, spending weeks at a time in Aleut villages, accompanied only by Aleuts. Thus, his knowledge was more extensive than that acquired by others. He also had less difficulty in communicating, as he had the assistance of several bilingual local residents, mostly Aleuts, while Sauer and Merck, Germans recently arrived in Russia, had additional linguistic barriers to over- come. Billings spoke his native English. His knowledge of Russian appears to have been minimal. 12/L.T. BLACK</page><page sequence="11">paws; from this pair, then, the humans descended. As the people multiplied, and it became too crowded to live on a single island, so that there were frequent civil strifes / mezhduusobiia / and discord, many were forced to seek other places of settlement. Some went east to Cape Aliaksa / Alaska Peninsula/, others west along the island chain which they settled and /eventually/ received various names... /1802 : 164, emphasis added/. As Merck during his sojourn at Unalaska travelled together with Sarychev to visit Aleut settlements in Beaver Inlet and Illiulliuk Bay, it is probable that they heard this tale from the same informants. However, Sarychev recorded another myth, to which he assigned greater importance, reporting it first and at greater length. This myth has never been recorded since, but nevertheless has a ring of authen- ticity and, like the origin from the dog, can be related to Asia, specifically to ancient China. The myth concerns a sacred life-giving and rejuvenating lake and the origin of death: Some say that the Deity ¡bog, God/, after he created the islands, also created human beings whom he made deathless. When they became old, they ascended a certain high mountain and threw themselves into a lake which was there /at its summit/. They re- emerged, young once again. In the meantime, the Deity became enamored of an /Aleut/ maiden and took her as a wife. Once, in conversation with him, she said that he made a great mistake when creating the Aleutian Islands, making them mountainous and treeless. Enraged by such temerity, the Deity inflicted death on the maiden's brother, and after this the entire human line became mortal (1802 : 164). This story links up with the Aleut ritual practices of daily ablutions, purifi- cation by water, and immersion in water of the wounded as well as of disobedient or cranky children. It can also be linked with the theme of brother-sister incest, explicitly stated in the tale of the origin of sea otters and to the sun/moon theme, wherein sibling relationship between these heavenly bodies is assumed. Although both of these myths are beyond the topic of this essay, let me note that, as indicat- ed even in the very earliest report by Shilov (see above), the Aleuts revered the sun and the moon (Veniaminov 1840), and that sea otters were symbolic of bene- volent ancestors, arbiters of social order and good conduct (Veniaminov 1840; Black 1981). Sea otter symbolism, which has persisted in Aleut art until very recent times, was characterized by sculpted, usually male, sea otter figurines carried in kayak bows and as cleats. These figurines of male sea otters were incised on the front with a motif which may be interpreted as a skeletal motif13 indicating the unity of the kinship group in the male line.14 In mythology, sea otters are trans- 13 I have linked certain aspects of Aleut art to Dorset tradition (Black 1982). On the basis of furth- er studies I have reached the conclusion that in the Aleut world view the sea otter may have replaced the bear so prominent in Dorset sculpture. The skeletal motif on the Dorset bear figurines (as well as on anthropomorphic figures) may not be indicative of shamanism but of ancestral links. 14 The unity of kin groups among several groups along the North Pacific rim, but explicitly so among the Nivkh (Gilyak) of the Lower Amur region and of Sakhalin Island, is expressed as unity of bone : we are of one bone (not flesh and blood, as among the Europeans). ESKIMO MOTIFS/13</page><page sequence="12">formed humans, as already mentioned, an incestuous brother/sister pair, saved from death by the benevolent Deity/Creator. Half a century or so later, Netsvetov and Veniaminov also noted the myths about human origin from a dog. Netsvetov's notation for the Atkans is terse: "They have descended from a dog" (in Veniaminov 1840, vol. 3, part 1). Venia- minov reports at greater length: Some say that in the beginning the earth was empty and not inhabited by anyone at all. Then, once upon a time, there fell from the sky /heaven, s neba/akadan , that is from above [Aleut term emphasized in original], two beings, in appearance resembling humans but with bodies covered with long hair [fur, shersť , also meaning animal hair]. From these was born a pair ingachagix /emphasis in original/ which resembled the first one, but hairless. From this latter pair all humans originated and eventually began to spread east, west and north. The south is not mentioned; they believed that there were no people in the south. The place where the first human originated was warm; there was no winter, no storms, but perpetual balminess of air. The first people were long-lived, strong, powerful. At first, the people lived peacefully, in amity, with- out envy, hatred, enmity or suffering of any kind. As the people multiplied, shortages and need grew, and their needs taught them to make tools to capture animals. Then came discord and enmity, and weapons were turned against people. Shortages and oppression by the stronger forced them to leave their original habitations and move farther and farther away. Thus all people originated (1840 : 127-128). Common elements in all accounts are readily apparent. It is also evident that by the end of the 18th century, mythological and historical elements had become fus- ed. In the version of the origin myth reported by Veniaminov, the reference to the longevity and might of the early humans may reflect an element from the sacred lake tale reported by Sarychev. That there was a separate, much more sober and realistic tradition of an ancestral homeland where fruits of the earth were abundant is attested to by Veniaminov himself who reported it in a different context (1840 : 271-272). In addition, Veniaminov recorded another origin myth which appears un- related to the two origin myths discussed hitherto, though the theme of discord and population dispersal also appears here. For the sake of the completeness of the record, I recount this myth here in synoptic form. It is a story of a solitary first man, who lived on the island of Yunaska, an active volcano in the Four Moun- tains Island group. He became lonely and wondered if there were other beings like himself in the world. He made himself a kayak of the type called ulilyat c15 and went in search for humans. On Umnak, on a path leading away from the beach, he met a woman whom he took as wife. From them originated all peoples in north- western America. At first, the pair generated a dog; their second child, a being of male gender, was quasi-human, quasi-animal, but had wings. At his own request, the parents killed him because he was unfit to lead a human existence. The couple's third child was a son, the fourth a daughter, both apparently fully 15 Possibly, an archaic term, as no recorded current or 19th century term for either single- hatch, two-hatch or three-hatch kayak can be related to it. 14/L. T. BLACK</page><page sequence="13">human. This boy and girl mated, and true humans are their descendants. Their children, however, spoke a different language in each generation. For this reason, people moved in different directions, with those who spoke the same language set- tling together. Those who moved away farthest east became the ancestors of the Chugach, Kenai people, Aglegmiut and Koloshi /Tlingit and Haida / but not of the Koniag (Veniaminov 1840 : 2 : 128-129)16. It is my impression that this myth contains elements found in the Koniag and Tlingit folklore. In considering all the versions of the origin myths, I am inclined to believe that the accounts of discord and population dispersal have an historical basis. The myth of the origin from a dog seems to be a relatively recent introduction, or pos- sibly re-introduction, of an Inuit motif, possibly from the Atka area or from the Four Mountains Island group, whose population was destroyed by the early 1770's. I have noted elsewhere that Atkan art (Black 1982) has very strong affinities to the art of Norton Sound and Lower Yukon-Kuskokwim areas, as well as with the Western Thüle art in general. Such features include double-image and realis- tic zoomorphic and anthropomorphic sculpture. Atkan traditions, too, have features in common with Inuit of historic times, such as dispute settlement by song duels (Nestevtov, in Veniaminov 1840, vol. 3, part I and Black, in press). The legend of origin from a dog, considered characteristic of Inuit folklore is traced, like the legend of the sacred lake to ancient pre-Tao, Chinese lore (Thompson 1966). Since Inuit and Aleut peoples share their ancestry, it is pos- sible that the dog-legend, re-introduced in the relatively recent past, found an echo in a memory of a more ancient similar tradition. If so, such memory may have aided the myth's acceptance and spread, especially because the Aleuts at contact did not possess domestic dogs.17 I tend to consider the legend of the sacred lake to be of more ancient origin as in both, the Aleut and Inuit later folklore corpus the notion is not explicit, though implicit references may be traced. As far as I know, Inuit folklore does not contain any narratives at all about a sacred lake that rejuvenates, but there are tales which refer to the restorative power of water - a belief maintained by the Aleuts also, even when the tale of the sacred lake recorded by Sarychev was for- 16 Elsewhere, Veniaminov records the purely historical tradition of movement eastward and of the belief that Aleuts who moved along the mighty river through the Alaska Interior eventually re- emerged at the sea coast, to become the ancestors (through mixing with local populations) of the Chugach and the Koloshi. Aglegmiut were considered newcomers from the eat, erstwhile enemies with whom peace was made under conditions of mutual respect. The Koniag of the Kodiak Island were considered implacable enemies and described in derogatory terms. It is worthwhile noting that the Tlingit vehemently denied any possible genetic connection with Aleuts (Veniaminov 1840 : 2: 272-275 and 279-290). 17 The Aleut language, however, contains a term for "dog" and it was said that in old times they had dogs, which either died out or were consumed during a period of severe famine. That dog was present in the Aleutians in pre-historic times has been confirmed by archaeological finds of dog remains, specifically on Akun in the Krenitzin Island group in the eastern Aleutians. ESKIMO MOTIFS/15</page><page sequence="14">gotten. This theme may be interpreted as a much attenuated rendering of the basis, sacred lake which rejuvenates motif, derived from a common source, that is as having a genetic basis. The second ancient motif which I consider to have been derived from a com- mon source by Aleuts and Inuit, is the motif of the bumblebee as a symbol of pow- er, specifically the power to kill, which has an ambivalent connotation (evil used for a good end). Neither in Aleut nor Inuit folklore does the bumblebee motif appear explicitly stated in narrative form. I first became aware of the bumblebee's importance when in the summer of 1975 I was getting ready to visit a site of an abandoned Aleut village which once had been populous and important; some of the men there had been hereditary whalers (field data). Aleut acquaintances began to warn me, ostensibly in jest, of the danger in that locality from man-eating bumblebees: giant creatures who would leave nothing but our bleached bones, if we were not careful. Underlying many joking remarks on the subject, I sensed an undercurrent which made me curious about the concepts pertaining to the bumblebee. In short order I learned that bumblebee imagery exists and that many men make "toys" for children or curios for sale which represent giant bumblebees. I found that all such figurines, of largish size, constructed of sea mammal bones (seal scapulas for wings) and other materials on hand, are always represented with a huge open maw painted red. Inavariably, the creatures have huge fangs - canines of sea mammals.18 Returning home, I consulted the Thompson (1966) Motif -Index of Folk Liter- ature... and found that the bumblebee is found in ancient folklore in northern China, where it is conceptualized as the catalyst that vitalizes the tiger: it is the bumblebee which enters or joins itself to the tiger that makes the beast ferocious. I concluded that the bumblebee in this instance stood ultimately for power and specifically for the power to kill. Searching Aleut folklore, I found in lokhel'son's corpus one tale told by Isidor Solovyev, specifically indicated as containing archaisms, in which an Aleut hunter is transformed into a killer whale so that he can kill whales. In the ritual process that accompanies transformation, bumble- bees emerge from the hunter's eyes (Iokhel'son ms., text 52). The hunter under- goes the ritual process three times, and with each successive transformation his power increases until it extends to his followers. Each transformation follows a three-step pattern: the emergence first of bumblebees and then of bottleflies from the hunter's eyes, and then the turning of his eyes to a vertical position. The signi- ficance of this sequence is not clear due to lack of any other data on such ritual transformations. However, I have concluded previously (see Black 1981; 1982) that a whale hunter had to undergo certain rituals associated with the notion of transformation into the killer whale and with the acquisition of ambivalently valued power to kill. William S. Laughlin confirms that there is an association be- 18 Such images are also made by Canadian Inuit. Robin McGrath provided me with the following information: "Arnaphialaaq Quuiaq - This woman (she died a few years ago) made bees for the craft shop at Spence Bay - fur body, antler legs, and faces with big teeth, wings from stretched dried fish fins. At the shop, the women also kept dried bees in ajar on the window ledge but I do not know why". 16/L. T. BLACK</page><page sequence="15">tween whaling and the bumblebee. In a recent work (Laughlin 1980), Laughlin specifically states that bumblebees, or their legs, were part of the "poison" used to "kill" whales, and that bumblebees (along with "black beetles and a little shrimp- like isopod") were "frequently used as a magical charm". Laughlin also states that the Aleut term for monkshood (aconite), said to have been used by Aleuts to con- coct poisons, is equivalent to "house of the bumblebee".19 On the basis of my study of Aleut art I have become increasingly convinced that not only do the Aleut and Inuit peoples share common remote ancestry, evidence by lingustic data, but that there was significant information exchange between the two groups throughout their history. Such links warrant intensive comparative study, and I felt that folklore would be a fruitful avenue of approach. Consequently, I decided to investigate whether the bumblebee, an ancient and powerful symbol connected to concepts of the ultimate power of life and death, is present in Inuit folklore. Whereas perusal of various published collections was rather inconclusive, inquiry among colleagues produced unexpected results. I learned that to this day the Greenland Inuit dread the bumblebee (LeMouël, verbal personal communication), and that in archaeological excavations a des- sicated bumblebee was found in a container believed to have been a shaman's talisman box (Helge Larsen, personal communication). Eventually, Robin McGrath drew my attention to a tale recorded among the Netsilik by Rasmussen (1930 : 366-367) about the big bee, or a cannibal troll- woman Ivigtarsuaq. This creature consumes her victims, leaving nothing but bare bleached bones. When her victim, the hero of the tale, escapes her clutches, she attempts to kill him by causing the sea to freeze over (equivalent to death), creating winter and thereby forcing the people to invent a new method of hunting sea mammals. Mrs. Mc- Grath also provided me with copies of the tale " The Girl and the Bee " (Lewis 1968 : 37-49) and two recent pictorial representations of the same theme that is central to the "The Girl and the Bee" story: a helpless human without food aided by the bee which turns into a raven (verbal representation) or thunder-bird (visual representations, see Arnaktauyok 1975 and drawings by Charlie, Tippett 1976). By far the most revealing is the pictorial story about the blue giant by Char- lie (composed 1975, text by Tippett 1976). Here the giant is pictured as large and powerful, taking a caribou, while a little boy, hungry and helpless, stands in the open. Nearby a small bumblebee feeds on a flower, while a bird hovers at a dis- tance above. The giant kills and cooks the caribou. Seeing this, the boy, the bum- blebee and the bird change their mien: they grow angry and larger. Then the giant takes seals, and the by now rather large bee rises into the air. The story ends with a picture showing a happy boy cooking both caribou and seal, with the thun- der-bird nearby and a very large bumblebee hovering above: a complete reversal of power relationships. 19 The term as given by Laughlin is anusnaadam ulangin. Ulangin derives from the root ulaa, house, homestead, dwelling. I was not able to find the term anusnaadax, presumably meaning bumblebee, either in Veniaminov or Netsvetov vocabularies, nor in the recent Atkan Aleut-English vocabulary by Bergsland (1980). Veniaminov, however, has a term for aconite: quangdix. ESKIMO MOTIFS/17</page><page sequence="16">In this context it is not inappropriate to remind the readers that in pre- contact time Aleut men, all of them hunters, wore clothing made of bird skins: cormorants, murres, and puffins, the cormorant skins being reserved for impor- tant men and chiefs. On Aleut hunting hats, images of birds were always repres- ented, either in abstract stylized geometric renderings painted on the hats sur- faces, or as sculpted figurines. Merck (1937, 1980) states explicitly that Aleut hunting headgear involved complex bird symbolism. Although, as I remarked earlier, the raven image is only present in Aleut folklore texts collected on Attu, the raven figure in these tales is associated with killing whales. Thus, the Attuan raven shares elements with the Inuit thunder- bird. Given the cultural diversity of the Aleutian archipelago population (Black 1982, and in press), it is quite probable that in the eastern Aleutians the raven figure was replaced by a generalized bird, most often a toothed one. A vague asso- ciation between the bird figures and volcanoes remained, but this association will not be discussed here for lack of space. This feature links the bird imagery of the Aleut to the thunder-bird figure of Inuit (and Koriak) folklore, but Aleut corpus contains no explicit thunder-bird figure. On the other hand, the thunder-bird visual image, appears to have been, at contact time, in the process of reintroduc- tion into Aleut culture from the Bristol Bay and Norton Sound areas, presuma- bly through contact with historic Inuit groups in western Alaska. On the painted closed-crown Aleut hunting helmets collected in the early 19th century in the extreme eastern portion of Aleut settlement area, the image of the thunder-bird does appear (see Black 1982). However, one cannot state with certainty if this imagery resulted from recent diffusion from the north, or was an echo of an older tradition, shared with Inuit, and lost among other Aleut groups who lived further west. The same questions apply to the image (also lacking a verbal tradition) of the three-stomached beast in the shape of a lizard which devours animals. This image appears on several eastern Aleut hunting helmets and on the single extant exam- ple of an Aleut bow. I am told that the three-stomached beast has a limited distrib- ution in the Norton Sound-Lower Yukon/Kuskokwim area of Alaska and that some (unnamed) scholars trace this motif to ancient China (Dorothy Jean Ray, personal communication). If so, the three-stomached beast falls into the same pat- tern we have seen in origin from a dog, the sacred lake, and the bumblebee motifs. The motif of the walrus-man, present in Aleut sculpture and folklore (reported by Veniaminov 1840), and in Inuit art (Ray 1981) and Koriak folklore (Vdovin 1973) upon further investigation may possibly do so also. The evidence of folklore, taken together with Okvik and Old Bering Sea types of art found in archaeological sites in the Aleutian archipelago and the Com- mander Islands (Fortescue 1 98 1 ) as well as the presence of Dorset elements in tool inventories and in art of the eastern Aleutians, raises new questions about genetic 20 The walrus-man image occurs in Inuit and Aleut art (Ray 1981) and also in Koriak folklore (Vdovin 1973). In Aleut folklore, a walrus-tusked face is an attribute of a child of brother-sister incest (Veniaminov 1840). 18/L. T. BLACK</page><page sequence="17">links between the Inuit and Aleuts as well as about their interaction within the last two millenia. Greater integration of Inuit and Aleut studies is called for, with a specific need for a thorough comparative investigation of the folklore and art of the Aleut, Inuit, Itel'men and Koriak peoples, as well as of that of the Kurile Islands and Ikhotsk Sea Littoral, to the Amur River area. Acknowledgements My colleagues were most generous in responding to my request for information re- garding evidence for the existence of a belief among the Inuit in the supernatural powers of the bumblebee.
