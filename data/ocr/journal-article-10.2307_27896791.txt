<plain_text><page sequence="1">Anatolian Studies 59 (2009): 81-93 Artemidi to ichnos: divine feet and hereditary priesthood in Pisidian Pogla Georgia Petridou University of St Andrews Abstract This paper examines an unpublished dedicatory inscription to Artemis (Ephesia?), which was found in Pogla in Pisidia by S. Mitchell. The dedication seems to have accompanied a sculptured bare foot or a foot with a sandal, which has not survived. The inscription is set against a whole set of feet- and footwear-related monuments and dedicatory inscrip tions from the nearby regions with special emphasis on similar dedications from Termessos. Moreover, the present paper examines the relationship between the Pogla dedication and another dedicatory monument in honour of Artemis Ephesia (in all likelihood from Cremna), which was first published and discussed by G.H.R Horsley in 1992. ?zet Bu c,ah?ma Pisidya Pogla'da S.

The new inscription pictured in figs 1, 2, 3 and 4 was found in 1994 by Professor Stephen Mitchell built into an ancient water trough in the modern village of Qomakh, which has been convincingly identified with the ancient city of Pogla near Andeda (fig. 5). The old name of the village, Figla or Fugla, is certainly reminiscent of that ancient name. More information on the identification of the modern with the ancient location can be found in Bean 1960 (55-65, fig. 1) and Levick 1974 (414-27). Description Text a is inscribed on the top of a fluted column (diameter: ca 0.5m); while text (3 is inscribed all around the column (width: 22 flutes; height: 0.55m). The average size of the letters is 3.2cm, while the three letters H, o and v in line 4 are bigger at about 3.4 cm. The letters p and r| in line 3 are in ligature. A substantial part of the lettering in lines 5 and 6 is missing due to the poorly preserved condition of the stone. Some lettering in lines 7 and 8 is also lost, because the column is buried in concrete (diameter: 0.45m) and embedded in the surrounding fence of the water trough.

The text flanks the two holes in the column shaft, one 7cm and the other 3cm in diameter. The small hole is 2.5cm deep, while the large one is filled with cement. The two holes appear to have supported an artefact in the shape of either footwear or a foot (with the big hole supporting the ball of the foot and the smaller one supporting the heel). The word ichnos can mean either foot or footprint.1 Since dedicatory footprints are most commonly hollowed out in a slab, or simply outlined, rather than sculptured and added on to the base/bomos as separate pieces, it is less likely that the artefact would look like a footprint, as argued by Castiglione (1970) and Bord (2004). However, Dunbabin (1990: 95) notes that footprints could be made separately, of different material, like the pair of stone footprints ca 16cm long found in the Temple of Nemesis in Rhamnous. More information on the Rhamnous footprints can be found in Touchais 1983 (751, fig. 30); while Canto (1984: 193) discusses Nemesis-Caelestis as the recipient of many similar dedicatory footprints, found especially in Italy but also on the Greek mainland and the islands. Consequently, although it is more likely that we are dealing with a sculptured bare foot or a foot with a sandal made of bronze or some other metal, we should not exclude altogether the possibility that the missing artefact had the shape of a footprint. An inscription from Panam?ra in Caria (/. Strat 248: 14-15, with Laumonier 1958: 274), for example, informs us about four golden ichn? dedicated either to Hera (Arena 1983: 100) or, more probably, to Zeus Panamaros jArykanda Phaselis* Fig. 5. Map of Pisidia (based on Horsley, Mitchell 2000: 179, fig. 58) (Guarducci 1942-1943: 323; 1974: 75), the owner of the sanctuary in which the inscription was found. Hatzfeld (1927: 106), the first editor, and Roussel (1928: 380), the first commentator of the inscription, do not even consider the first possibility. Arena, on the other hand, thinks Hera is the rightful receiver of the dedication in view of her close association with golden sandals as found in the Odyssey (11.604) ("Hpr)s xPuao7TE^^ou) and Hesiod's Theogony (454) (TT?TViav "Hpr|v 'Apyeiriv, xpuoE?ris tteS?Xois ?iifkf?auiav). The dedicators are Poplius Aelius Hekatomnos, who was a priest at the sanctuary, and his son Pheadrus. The text (lines 14-16) reads as follows: ccv?9r|Kav | Se Kai ?SpE?ov Trj "Hpa Kai Kara tt\v tou | 8eou ?v?pyiav ?xvri a?Tou xp?oEa T?GGEpa I Kai toTs [0u]oi?&lt;aa&gt;Gi ?xap?oavTo xa ?Ep?. Unsurprisingly enough, the four golden /c/w?have not survived. Hence, we have no way of knowing whether they were actually four golden footprints or four feet (with or without footwear). Compare Roussel's comment (1928: 380): 'c'est-?-dire des ex-voto en forme de pieds ou d'empreintes de pieds'. Guarducci (1974: 75) has put forward yet another possibility: the four ichn? may have been two pairs of soles made of gold or 1 ichnos as foot: Euripides, Bacchae: 1134; Heliodorus, Aethiopica: 7.8.7 (feet of the statue of Isis): p?TTrei jj?v a?T?v ?tti Trp?acoTTOV, toTs 'ixvEGl TTpoacp?s Tou ?y?AijaTos kt?.; vestigium as foot: Apuleius, Metamorphoses: 11.17 (ambiguous reference: feet of Isis or feet of the statue of Isis): exosculatis vestigiis deae, quae gradibus haerebat argento formata. Compare also Guarducci (1974: 74) and Henrichs (1968: 70, n. 62). ichnos as footprint: Iliad: 13.71-72 (footprints of Poseidon); Odyssey. 2.406, 3.30, 7.38 (footprints of Athena); Odyssey. 5.193 (footprints of Calypso); Homeric Hymn to Hermes: 220, 342, 351 (footprints of the baby Hermes); Herodotus: 4.82 (footprint of Heracles); Callimachus, Hymn: 6.5 (footprints of Kore); Luci?n, True Histories: 1.7 (footprints of Heracles and Dionysus); [Aristotle] De mirabilibus auscultationibus: 97.838 (footprint of Heracles); Diodorus Siculus: 4.24.1-3 (footprints of Heracles); vestigium as footprint: Cicero, De natura deorum: 3.11-13 (footprints of Dioscuri): ergo et illud in silice quod hodie apparet apud Regillum tamquam vestigium ungulae Castoris equi credis esses?; Valerius Maximus: 1.8.1 (footprints of Dioscuri), etc. More examples in Kotting (1972: 727-33). 83</page><page sequence="4">Anatolian Studies 2009 covered with gold. Hatzfeld (1927: 106, n. 3) rightly suggested that the dedication of the four foot-shaped objects seems to have been commanded by the god himself: 'Faut-il interpreter Kara tx\v ?v?pyiav sur le mod?le de kot? TTp?crrayna: conform?ment ? la manifestation de la volont? du dieu?' The divine will would have been manifested to Aelius Hekatomnos in the course of one of the god's divine epiphanies. Energ(e)ia is a synonym for epiphaneia: both in literary and epigraphic sources from the Hellenistic and early Imperial periods, energ(e)ia means 'divine manifestation' or 'manifestation of divine power'. Compare, for instance, the following passage from Diodorus Siculus (11.14.3-4): KaTaTrXayevTag tt\v tcov ?ecov ?v?pyEiav ... oi 5? ?EXcpoi Tris tcov 6ec v ETTicpavE?ag a??vaTov ?Tr?iavriMa KaTccX?TTEiv T?ig HETayEVEGT?poig. The reference is to the Delphic Soteria and the defeat of the Gauls, who under Brennus attacked the oracle in 279/278 BC. The two terms energeia and epiphaneia are interchangeable in our passage. Similarly, in an inscription from Panam?ra (/. Strat. 10: 2-4) we read: ?TTEi[or] ? li?yi?Tos Zeus rTav?|iapos]| [Kai Trp?TEpov ttoXXcxs Kai HEy?Xag ETTicpavETs ?vripyriGEV ?vEpyE?alg e?$| t?iv tt\&lt;; tt?X[e]cos acoTrip?av ?k TraX[aicov xp?vcov ktX., and in /.

The divine epiphany of Zeus Panamaros could have taken place either in a dream vision or in waking reality (more on this topic below). Returning to our dedicatory foot-shaped sculpture from Pogla, the possibility that it was made of stone or marble should not be excluded either. In the neigh bouring city of Termessos, Lanckoronski saw an impressive marble sandaled foot, over lm high, fixed on the top of a rectangular base made of limestone (fig. 6). The monument is now lost. The inscription on the base of the monument reads as follows. [?ECO 'Yvy?GTCO (?) UTT?p ?yE?]qS ?E?TTOIJTTOS e[?xt?v.

The dedicant is apparently a much-awarded multi-talented artist, named Theopompos, who had originally made two gigantic feet of this type using a bronze mould. Guarducci (1942-1943: 328) thought that more information on the identity of the honoured deity and the artist Theopompos would have been given in the inscribed base of the second foot. However, the name of the deity and the reason for the dedication is not certain. In supplying Theos Hypsistos as the honoured deity, Heberdey was influenced by the inscribed base of yet another monument of similar character from Termessos. ?ECO ETTTlK?cp 'Y &lt;y&gt; ?gtco Tux[i(?) os ?

AYToYEZTH ixrvEii oeoY Fig. 7. 77ie ichnos o/ TTzeos Hypsistos Epekoos (after Lanckoronski 1892: 76, fig. 27) The text (inscribed on a rectangular altar of about 0.65m high as shown in fig. 7) speaks about the dedicatory altar and the affixed ichnos, which were set up in honour of Theos Hypsistos Epekoos (TAM III.I 32; compare also Weinreich 1912: 20, no. 99, 36-37; Guarducci 1942-1943: 323; Dunbabin 1990: 94-95). On the top of the altar, there is a depression with traces for the attachment of a footprint or, more likely, of a bare or sandaled foot presumably made of bronze. The foot shaped monument in honour of Theos Hypsistos, as in the case of our foot-shaped sculpture from Pogla, has not survived. Sculptured feet with or without sandals or inscribed footprints, often accompanied by dedicatory or explanatory inscriptions, are found all over the Mediter ranean (from the Greek islands to Asia Minor and from Egypt to the Iberian peninsula) from prehistoric times onwards. More about this type of monument can be found in the studies of Guarducci (1942-1943; 1974) and Castiglione (1967; 1968; 1970), who has focused more on the foot-shaped artefacts from Egypt. Dunbabin's (1990) survey, on the other hand, focuses more on artistic representations of feet and footprints in the Graeco Roman world. For an exhaustive list of artefacts of similar character in Italy and Spain, see Canto (1984). Finally, Weniger (1923-1924), Henrichs (1968), Fauth (1985-1986) and K?tting (1972; 1983) all pay adequate attention to comparative material from literary sources. These artefacts are usually divided in two categories: (a) the feet of the pilgrims; and (b) the feet of the deities - though understandably enough, the borderline between the two categories is not always easy to set. In the first category belong a large number of sculptured feet and footwear, as well as inscribed feet, footwear or footprints, which date from the Archaic to the late Imperial age. Fairly unambiguous examples of the first category are the two rock-cut pairs of footprints (one of bare feet and the other of highly stylised feet with sandals) found in the Sanctuary of Athena Samonia in Crete (Itanos), which date from ca the sixth century BC (fig. 8) (contra Arena [1983: 99], who reads ?r)v\ oioi 5e tt?Se$, takes Arjv? as a dialectical variant of Zr]vi, and thinks that these footprints are dedicated to Zeus). The accompanying explanatory inscription in local Archaic alphabet reads as follows: Arjvio (t)o?5e tt?Ses 'these are the feet of Denias' (Inscr. Cret. III.VII 4; with Guarducci 1942 Fig. 8. The feet of Denias (after Guarducci 1974: 71, fig. 34) 85</page><page sequence="6">Anatolian Studies 2009 1943: 311). Comparative material may be found in Castiglione 1970 (98, n. 34) and Dunbabin 1990 (89, 90, n. 25), who refer to two more similar examples of outlined footprints accompanied by inscriptions with the owner's name: the first dates from ca the seventh or sixth century BC and comes from Thorikos (SEG 34 [1984] 43), while the second is dated to ca the sixth century and comes from Gordion (Young 1969: 279, no. 43, pi. 71, fig. 7). Perhaps, these highly stylised feet represent the feet of the pilgrim Denias and his need to commemorate his journey to the sacred place and all the difficulties he may have had to overcome to complete it. Thus, Denias and his pilgrimage to the sanctuary become part of the sacred place itself; by leaving his inscribed footprints behind, he immortalises his visit for posterity. However, in several cases there is a debate as to whether the footprints or the votive feet and footwear belong to the pilgrim or to the deity, the rightful owner of the sanctuary. The three votive bronze sandals dedicated to Apollo Corcyraeus, for example, found in his sanctuary in Corfu (Mon Repos) and dating back to the end of the sixth or the beginning of the fifth century BC, were inter preted on the one hand by Guarducci as representing the feet of the worshippers which were then dedicated to Apollo, while Dunbadin thought of them as representing Apollo's feet, and hence his presence in the sanctuary. The smaller one is made of bronze and carries the following inscription: 'ATr[??X]?vos tou 9opoupai[ou] 'of Apollo Corcyraeus'. The other two have wooden soles covered with bronze, and are of life size proportions (see Dontas 1973: 52, nos MR 936, 937; Guarducci 1974: 72, fig. 35; Dunbabin 1990: 95). One of the more unambiguous examples of foot shaped artefacts which represent the feet of the deity, not the feet of the worshipper(s), is perhaps the so-called foot of Sarapis (see Dow, Upson 1944: 58-77; Guarducci 1974: 73-74). The foot of Sarapis, that is a sandaled or naked right foot with the draped bust of the god affixed on the top, is known to us from several small-scale depictions on Roman Imperial coinage, such as the Roman-Egyptian drachm found in the Sarapeion in Alexandria which depicts the head of Antoninus Pius on the obverse and a bust of Sarapis on the top of a colossal foot on the reverse (fig. 9). Moreover, the same type of foot-shaped monument is known to us from large-scale representations in marble like those from Alexandria, Cairo, Athens, Turin and elsewhere (see Dow, Upson 1944: 58-77). Guarducci (1974: 75) thought that she recognised one further example of these dedicatory monuments featuring Sarapis in the ex-voto depicted in fig. 10, which comes from a small temple of the third century AD in Ras el Soda, between Alexandria and Abukir (compare also Robert 1955: 281; Bernand 1969: 109, fig. 78). On a small Fig. 9. Roman-Egyptian drachm from the Sarapeion in Alexandria with a bust of Sarapis on the top of a colossal foot (American Numismatic Society 1935-117-783) Fig. 10. Foot-shaped monument from a small temple in Ras el Soda (after Guarducci 1974: 75, fig. 36) 86</page><page sequence="7">Petridou marble column found by the entrance of the temple stands a marble foot with a sandal. On the front part of the column, a metric inscription explains that this is the votive offering of Isidoros, who was preserved safe and sound by divine providence when he was involved in an accident with his wagon. As to the identity of the recipient of the dedication, we shall never rise above the level of specu lation. As mentioned above, Guarducci suggested Sarapis, and she could even imagine a head accompanying the sculptured foot; but then again, as Bernand suggested, Isis was equally popular and would have been a good guess, given her strong links with healing epiphanies, incubation and, above all, in view of the great significance 'vestigia' have in her cult. (On the significance of footprints for the cult of Isis, see, for instance, Apuleius, Metamorphoses'. 11.17.3, 11.23-24; with K?tting 1983: 198; Dunbabin 1990: 96.) There may even be a pun between the name of the dedicant (Isidoros from Isis and down, that is 'gift of Isis' or 'gift to Isis') and the sculp tured foot that was offered to the goddess to reciprocate for Isidoros' feet. The inscribed text reads as follows. picp6e\g I ?? rrnTcov | cctt' ?xrma|-Tos, ?V0' | 'laiScopos acoSeis cxv|ti tto8cov | 0fiKEV ?xvos | laaKccpi. Having been thrown from his horses out of his wagon, and having been saved, Isidoros dedicates this foot to the blessed god(dess), to reciprocate for allowing him to preserve his own feet intact. Thanks to the surviving artefact, it is clear that the word ichnos here means foot and not footprint. More importantly, one can hardly fail to notice the intentional semantic ambiguity in depicting a foot, which alludes to the feet of the worshipper, while simultaneously success fully evoking the presence of the deity, and the active involvement of the latter in the life of the first. The brief survey above allows us to assume with a fair degree of certainty that a foot-shaped monument (either a footprint or a foot with or without a sandal) would also have been fixed on the top of the Pogla column. The problem, however, remains whether the sculpture was meant to signify the foot of the goddess Artemis or that of a worshipper called Artemeis. Although, as discussed above, the borderline between the two is not always easy to set, I am more inclined to believe that the two holes on the top of the Pogla column supported a foot-shaped monument, whose creation and dedication were ordered by the goddess Artemis, who manifested herself to the dedicant of the inscription in the course of a dream. At least this is what the phrase koto XpriuaTiou?v of line 4 implies. A similar verbal structure appears in the accompa nying inscription of the second dedicatory foot from Termessos discussed above (the one which was probably dedicated to Theos Hypsistos) where the reader is told that both the altar and the affixed foot or footprint were set up at a god's command (kcctcc keXeugiv). Both Kccxa keXeugiv and Kccxa xp^U0"1*10!-^ imply that some sort of divine epiphany had taken place in the course of which the deity manifested his will. These formulaic expressions are analogous to other standard epigraphic formulas meaning 'in accordance to a divine dream vision' (for example, MAMA 267A(III): Kax? ?E?ov vipov; or 276B kcct vipov) or simply 'at god's command' (for example, MAMA 277A(II): Kara tt[V ETTiTCcyrjv [to?] 9eou; for more examples, see Cameron 1939: 149, n. 18). Formulaic structures of this sort are often found in various combinations accompanying dedications of statues, images or other ex-voto monuments. An inscription from Lesbos (IG XII.2:108), for example, tells us about a bronze image of Artemis Thermia Omonoia Telesphoros Symphoros Tycha, which was dedicated at the command and oracular injunction of the goddess herself: kccttcxv ?TTiTa[ya]v kou XpTiUa"nG[u]ov auxag. Another dedicatory inscription from a Turkish village near Poimanenon informs us about an altar that was dedicated by Claudianus to Poseidon at the god's oracular injunction (KctTa xPrmaTlGU?v) after an earthquake (more in Hasluck 1906: 28). Robert (1978: 399) suggested that Claudianus was the god's first priest and the founder of the new cult, and translates koctcc xpTlnafioiaov as 'en ex?cution d'un song? oracu laire' ('at the command of an oracular dream') (compare also Hellenica I: 72). An oracular dream does not necessarily imply that the divination took place in a sanctuary. It is more probable that the deity manifested himself or herself in the dreams of the dedicant and revealed his or her divine will, as argued by Robert (1963: 381) (compare also IG XIV: 2413, 16: K?piE S?^ns Kai xP^U^v? xpnuocnoov noi ?v t[rj] Ta?T[r)] ?tt' aXr|0E?g hetcc uvruaris ktX.). In other words, the deity's divine epiphany (invariably conveyed in the Greek of the Hellenistic and Imperial eras by terms such as ETTicpavEia, ?v?pyEia, ?v?pyEia, Suvams, ?pETri) becomes somehow a prerequisite for the deliverance of the divine message. Compare here an inscription from modern Bagli (near Ayvali) in Pisidia (Sterrett 1888: 280-81, no. 400), where we are told that Preimos, the slave of Antiochos Voxos, was prompted to dedicate this votive monument to Meter Oreia at the goddess' command, which was revealed to him in the course of an oracular dream (kot? ?TTicpavE?av | tt\s 0eou xpTluaTi?0E?s). Apparently, these oracular dreams are targeted in particular towards members of the priestly 87</page><page sequence="8">Anatolian Studies 2009 personnel or individuals who later on join the deity's priesthood. We have already mentioned above the example of Poseidon's priest Claudianus, who followed the god's order as it was revealed to him in the course of an oracular dream. In another inscription, inscribed on a marble base from Nicopolis ad Nestum (modern Garrnen in Bulgaria), the priest of Zeus dedicates the statues which used to be placed on the base to the god Kara XpriiaaTiaia?v (IGBulg IV.2340). Are we then to assume that the dedicant of the Pogla ichnos fitted this pattern and was indeed a member of the priestly personnel? The dedicants In fact, the second part of the Pogla inscription, which is inscribed around the shaft and is far more damaged than the part inscribed on the top, reveals that there were two dedicants: one was Artemeis, the daughter of Trokondas, who was named, in all likelihood, after the goddess Artemis whom she served as her priestess; the other dedicant was a man, whose name survives only partly in line 5 as ]?nianus[. This line of the text is so fragmentary that the reading supplied is not certain. It is possible that we are dealing here with a cognomen, such as OXa. 'Aou?Siog Oa(3iav?g KaTTiTcoviav?q Ao?kios (/. Pisid. Cen. 34-35, 37, 39-41), A. 'Ate?Xios MaTpcoviav?g 'A?KXriTTi?Bcopos (/. Pisid. Cen. 91) or even something like M?p(KOs) A?p(r|Xios) MeiSiav?s nXaTcoviav?q ktX. {JAM III.I 21, 112-14), M?p(Kos) A?pOiXios) nXaTcovtavck 'Otccvtis (JAM III.I 108, 109-10), Map(Kos) A?pO?Xios) KX(a?Sios) O?aXiav?g Necoviavck (JAM III.I 101). In Imperiai Asia Minor, especially in the second and third centuries, cognomina ending in lavog or ianus are often attested (Salomies 1984: 93-104). Alternatively, we may simply have to do with an epichoric nomen proprium that has been modified by the Latin adjectival suffix ianus. As far as the rest of the names mentioned in the inscription are concerned, things are more straight forward. The simple theophoric name of the priestess Artemeis in line 6 is well attested in Pisidia. Compare here KP ??198-11 and Horsley 1992: 126, who counted about 120 examples in Termessos alone. In the same article, Horsley (126-29) provides an informative discussion of the proper names Artemeis and Trokondas in the epigraphic sources of Pisidia, which it would be pointless to repeat here. One could hardly fail to notice the itacistic orthographical difference between the Greek spelling of Artemis on the top of the column and what seems to be an indigenous name, Artemeis, rendered into Greek around the shaft of the column. Masson (1986: 126-28) has collected more epigraphic sources with examples of the female names Artemeis and Artemis. This difference may have been inconsequential in other contexts, since the two names would have sounded exactly the same (Horsley 1992: 126). However, in the present context, this variation in the spelling may reflect the need to preserve the Greek spelling for the name of the goddess in the first part of the inscription and the epichoric spelling for the name of the local priestess. If true, this may vindicate my initial suggestion that the ichnos in the first part of the text, as well as the missing ichnos monument, refer to the foot or the footprint of the goddess Artemis, rather than that of a pilgrim or a worshipper called Artemeis. A priestess named after the goddess she served is not an uncommon phenomenon as IBurdurMus 20 and other inscriptions show (see also Horsley 1992: 127). Artemeis' father is called Trokondas, a name which is also well attested in Pisidia, Lykia and Phrygia. According to Zgusta, Trokondas is an indigenoform based on the divine name Tarhu(nt)- (KP ?? 1512-31; Horsley [1992: 125] again has counted about 130 instances from Termessos, where it is by far the most common name). From the proper name that follows Trokondas only the letters g, co and possibly a second o survive, which makes its reading difficult. From its position in our text one may expect to find either a patronymic to Trokondas, like Artemeis Trokondou So[s]a (as in /. Pisid. Cen. 169.1: A?p. TpoK?vSag ??XcovoQ. Trokondas is so common, that it would not be surprising if Artemeis felt the need to identify herself further with a papponymic, in which case 2co[g]cc (genitive of Zcooag, a hypocoristic form that corre sponds to ?cog?(3ios or Zc?GavSpos) is very likely, as Stephen Mitchell has pointed out to me (personal communication). Both Artemeis and the male dedicant mentioned in line 5 seem to have been members of the priestly personnel of the goddess Artemis. A present participle (?e[po?|je]voi) is preferred in line 7 to a past one (ie[paG?ue]voi) because it suits better the estimated five letter lacuna of the line. The reading ?"nr|K?cp after the dative 0eco seems appropriate for several different reasons: (a) the word 0?cp often precedes a regional or a general cult epithet such as etttikoco in inscriptions of the Imperial era (Robert 1963: 382, n. 1); (b) epekoos, i.e. 'the one who listens to the worshipper's prayers', is a common epithet of Artemis in epigraphic documents that come from all over the Greek speaking world;2 (c) epekoos is a well-attested cult epithet in Pisidia both in relation to Apollo and his sister Artemis (Weinreich 1912: 32); and, finally, (d) epekoos is a cult epithet which appears in foot-shaped dedicatory monuments, like the ichnos monuments from Termessos (TAM III.I 32, 33) 88</page><page sequence="9">Petridou discussed above. The masculine form 9eco instead of 6eg in conjunction with a female deity is not particularly problematic, since we have several analogous examples in the literary sources of late Hellenistic and Imperial times.3 Another problem to solve is, of course, to determine which Artemis was the recipient of the foot dedication, since the name of the goddess accompanied by the different cultic titles of Ephesia, Agrotera and Pergaia is very common in the epigraphical documents of Pisidia (see Levick 1974: 422-23; and more recently, Horsley 2007: 24). Out of these three deities, Artemis Ephesia is most often called ep?koos in dedicatory inscriptions of a wide chronological and topographical range (Weinreich 1912: 8, nos 24, 25, 26). Hence, although it is not clear which of these cultic manifestations of Artemis is the recipient of the ichnos dedication, Artemis Ephesia seems like a good candidate given her popularity in the Pisidian cultic scene and the frequency with which she is called epekoos. Finally, reading kcct? in conjunction with e9o$ seems like a fairly certain supplement in view of a plethora of literary and epigraphic parallels. The syntac tical structure kcct? t? e9o$ accompanied either by a qualifying adjective (for example, KccTa t? TrccTpiov e9o$ or koctcx t? TraAai?v e9os, etc.) or a qualifying genitive (for example, kccto t? e9o$ tgov TrccT?pcov, KccTa to e9os Tfjg ?EpccTE?ac; or kcxtoc t? e9os t?\&lt;; ?opTf?s, etc.) is particularly common in Classical and post-Classical literature, and is found in two inscriptions, one from Magnesia ad Maeander and the other from Olympia: kcct? t? TraTpiov tcov ?yc?vcov e9o&lt;; (IvO 54); kqtcx t? TraTpiov e9o$ (JMagn. 110b).4 Hereditary priesthood in Pogla? All three key names of our inscription (with the exception of the fragmentary name of line 5), that is Artemeis the daughter of Trokondas, Trokondas and Artemis the goddess, are also present in the inscribed relief from the Burdur Museum (inv. no. 415.34.74) depicted in fig. 11. This inscription was published and commented on by Horsley and Mitchell in 2000 as /. Pisid. Cen. 31, as well as by Horsley in 2007 as IBurdurMus 21. Mitchell in his Cremna in Pisidia (1995) provides a fascinating account of the same monument as evidence for Cremna's transition from being an independent city to being a Roman colony, and for the foundation of the mystery cult of Artemis Ephesia in Cremna (Mitchell 1995: 54-56). However, the fullest commentary on the document and its signifi cance for the attestation of the mysteries of Artemis Ephesia and the hereditary priesthood of the goddess in Cremna is in the first publication of the monument by Horsley in his 1992 article in Anatolian Studies.

With purity and with a manner befitting the goddess he preserved the solemn mysteries of the goddess, as they were founded and transmitted, and he advanced them even further. Moreover, (they honoured) Artemis daughter of Trokondas, his own daughter, who also herself received the priesthood and likewise acted piously. As(s)yrios, Osaeis, Trokondas, Pia and Hermasta, the children of (H)erpias, (honoured) their own grandfather and their mother as a mark of piety and respect (translation by Horsley [1992: 121] with slight emendations). From the Burdur monument then, we learn that Artemeis and her father Trokondas were members of a long line of priesthoods of hereditary nature that served Artemis Ephesia for some three generations. Mitchell estimates that Artemeis' forefathers must have received the priesthood around 50 BC, that is almost a century before the date of the actual monument tentatively dated by Horsley to the first half of the first century AD on the basis of the letter forms and the stylistic details of the relief (see Mitchell 1995: 54-56; Horsley, Mitchell 2000: 62-63). Assyrios, Osaeis, Trokondas, Pia and Hermasta, who were Artemeis' children and Trokondas' grand children, erected the monument in honour of their grand father and mother. Although the location at which the monument was found is not mentioned in the museum's inventory, there are good reasons to believe that Cremna is the city of origin. These reasons are extensively discussed and debated in Horsley 1992 (124-35) and 2007 (25), Mitchell 1995 (54-56) and Horsley and Mitchell 2000 (62-63), and it is not necessary to repeat them here. The inscription on the Burdur monument provides the first epigraphic evidence of the growth and expansion of the mystery cult of Artemis Ephesia in Cremna (Horsley, Mitchell 2000: 62). Nevertheless, the cult of the tutelary deity of Ephesos was previously attested at Cremna by ample numismatic evidence (compare Aulock 1979: nos 1398-1403, 1554-59, 1613-20, 1621-23 and Horsley 1992: 130). These coins confirm that what may have started as a privately-introduced cult of Artemis Ephesia in Cremna at around the mid first century BC must have expanded and grown to be a civic cult by the second and third centuries AD, presumably after having received official sanction and promotion (see Horsley, Mitchell 2000: 63). Furthermore, Cremna was not the only Pisidian city which had embraced the cult of the most widely-celebrated Artemis in Asia Minor. Two inscrip tions from Termessos, one a sarcophagus text (TAM III. 1 Fig. 11. The Burdur dedication (after I. Pisid. Cen. 31, pi 31) 390) and the other a fragmentary epitaph (TAM III.1 830), attest to the popularity of the cult of Artemis of Ephesos. More significantly, in the fortuitous case that our Artemeis and her father Trokondas from the Pogla inscription are, in some direct or indirect way, connected to that other Artemeis from Cremna, her father Trokondas and her family of hereditary priests and priestesses, then the list of the Hellenised Pisidian cities (that is Cremna and Termessos so far) that found a place in their civic pantheon for the Hellenic tutelary deity of wild beasts and mountainous regions may just have to be expanded. However, it remains to be seen if there is indeed any sort of direct or indirect connection between the two texts. The personal names mentioned in the two texts, and their personal and cultic relationship with the goddess Artemis provide the most obvious and yet the most precarious linkage between the two texts. One could imagine that some of the seminal names in the family like the theophoric Artemeis and Trokondas - in all likelihood the name of the founder of the cult of Artemis Ephesia in Cremna - would have remained the same, and would have been passed on from one gener ation to the next. In the Cremna text, for instance, Artemeis' son Trokondas is named after his grandfather. Nevertheless, as far as dates go, it is difficult to see how 90</page><page sequence="11">Petridou Trokondas and his daughter Artemeis, the priestess of the goddess Artemis in the dedicatory inscription from Pogla, can be the same two people as Artemeis, priestess of Artemis Ephesia, and her father Trokondas mentioned in the other dedicatory text from Cremna, since the Pogla text has been dated by Mitchell to around the second or even possibly the third century AD (on the basis of the style of the monument and the fact that ianus is a common Latinised ending at the time in Pisidia), while the text from Cremna goes back as far as the first half of the first century BC. However, it is possible that the members of the priestly family mentioned in the Pogla inscription are the descendents of the same powerful family which was responsible for the dissemination of the mysteries of Artemis Ephesia in Cremna. In fact, the case of finding evidence of a powerful priestly family operating in more than one major urban centre is not without precedent. As discussed above, the Burdur monument speaks clearly for a priestly family that in all likelihood went on a pilgrimage to the great Sanctuary of Artemis at Ephesos, and, inspired by the experience, moved on to establish the mystery cult of Artemis in Cremna. Furthermore, Horsley has put forward the possibility of yet another priestly family who controlled the cult of a deity in one major civic centre and introduced it to nearby cities. In his commentary of IBurdurMus 2, a dedicatory inscription from Bagsaray (formerly known as Arvali k?y?) to Agdistis, Horsley notes that the same priestess named Breiseis appears to have been operating also in Sagalassos, as another dedicatory inscription, this time to hagnai theai epekooi, shows (on IBurdurMus 2, see Horsley 2007: 9-10; on the dedication to hagnai theai epekooi, see Waelkens, Poblome 1997: 147, fig. 67). Furthermore, in a recently published article Mitchell discusses the exciting possi bility of yet another priestly family, that of Hoplon, priest of Dionysus, having connections both in the Pisidian metropolis of Sagalassos and in some rural sanctuary near Ariassos in southern Pisidia (Mitchell 2008: 154 55). Consequently, we may not be far from the truth if we assume that the same priestly family which controlled the cult of Artemis Ephesia in Cremna may have continued to do so through the next decades and have re-emerged in neighbouring Pogla more than a century later as equally powerful and in control of the same cult. However, one must be cautious and recognise that, given the lack of wider cultic context for the Pogla column and the wide chronological gap between the two texts, the identifi cation between the priestly family mentioned there and the other one mentioned in the Burdur Museum example is far from certain. Nevertheless, the similarities between the personal names of the two texts and their personal and cultic relationships remain striking.
