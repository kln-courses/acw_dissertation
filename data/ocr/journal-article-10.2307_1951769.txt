<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NATURAL LAW THESIS: AFFIRMATION OR DENIAL? FELIX E. OPPENHEIM University of Delaware The age old contest between the proponents of natural law and their oppo- nents continues unabated, and a solution does not seem in sight. The reason, it seems to me, is simply that representatives of either side often quite literally do not know what they themselves, as well as their opponents, are talking about. Instead of arguing for their respective theories and against those of their antagonists, they knock down straw men. And since there are periodic "revivals" of natural law, and of its denial as well, the game continues end- lessly. Yet, I believe it is sufficient to state the issue clearly to realize that the advocates of natural law adhere to an incorrect epistemological view, and that political thought must dispense with natural law because it is a mistaken doctrine. I shall use the expression "the natural law thesis" to refer to the basis com- mon to all the innumerable theories making up the history of natural law. I shall try to formulate the precise meaning of the natural law thesis and of its denial. I shall give my reasons for rejecting the arguments advanced in favor of natural law and my reasons for holding the opposite view to be the correct one. I shall point out some general misconceptions as to what is, and what is not, entailed by the denial of the natural law thesis.' I shall refute the current belief that to deny natural law is to deny the possibility of rational choice and responsible behavior. I. THE NATURAL LAW THESIS The Meaning of the Natural Law Thesis: (a) It Does Not Belong to Empirical Science. Natural law doctrines are usually couched in the language of empirical science. "All men are endowed with certain inalienable rights" looks and sounds like "all men are endowed with two eyes" or "all persons in the United States are endowed with the right of free speech." This grammatical appear- ance is deceptive. The second and third sentences are empirical, because they contain only descriptive terms; e.g., the word "right" refers to a legal right within a given system of positive law.2 The same word "rights" is being used in the first sentence in a normative-ethical rather than in an empirical-legal sense; as a result, the whole sentence acquires normative character. Surely, the framers of the Declaration of Independence did not intend to make the ob- viously false assertion that all men do in fact have the same legal rights. 1 In the absence of a handier term for "denial of the natural law thesis," I have no choice but to use this clumsy expression throughout the paper. 2 The statement: "all persons in the United States have the legal right of free speech" can be empirically verified by referring to the First Amendment and to the fact that this provision has, on the whole, been enforced. 41</page><page sequence="2">42 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW Rather, they meant to exhort men everywhere to urge their respective govern- ments to give them those legal rights to which they are morally entitled.' Every particular natural law doctrine refers to rules of ethics in the area of political behavior; to moral rules as to what legal rules ought to be enacted, obeyed, and enforced; to ethical standards according to which a given legal or political institution or system is just or unjust. (b) It Does Not Belong to Normative Ethics. The normative component does not exhaust the meaning of the natural law thesis. Take Cicero's classical dictum: There is in fact a true law-namely right reason-which is in accordance with nature, applies to all men, and is unchangeable and eternal.' Cicero does not merely exhort all men to act in accordance with certain moral principles; he also means to affirm that these norms are objectively valid, regardless of anybody's subjective preferences and independently of any system of positive law. Similarly, to characterize "life" as a natural or absolute or self-evident or necessary right, or to claim that preserving life is commanded by natural or objective or eternal or true law, is to say the same as: the command- sentence "preserve life!" (or "do not kill!" or "murder ought to be punished") is demonstrably true. Natural law theorists differ widely as to the content of natural law, i.e., as to what natural law enjoins us to do. Philosophers of natural law also disagree among themselves as to how it can be shown that to do such-and-such is a natural law command or a natural right or a just law. But all the proponents of the natural law thesis agree that there are normative statements in the area of law and politics which are demonstrably true or false; that there are certain kinds of political behavior which can be proven to be morally right or wrong; that there are political institutions which are objectively just or unjust. This is the core meaning of the natural law thesis. The natural law thesis therefore does not belong to normative ethics; it consists of assertions about the truth or falsity of normative statements, rather than of the statements themselves. (c) It Belongs to Epistemology. The natural law thesis deals with the logical status of certain normative statements, namely with the question whether and how they can be validated. This is a problem of epistemology, more particularly of logical analysis. The natural law thesis belongs neither to empirical science nor to ethics but to epistemology. To subscribe to the natural law thesis is to adhere to the epistemological theory of value-cognitivism. Value-cognitivism claims that there exist intrinsic value-judgments which are cognitively true or false, regardless of the speak- er's or listener's intrinsic value-commitments. Intrinsic value-judgments stipu- late that some object or event or state of affairs is valuable or disvaluable in ' That these moral claims are "inalienable" means, that the corresponding legal rights ought not, not that they cannot, be taken away. 4 Republic, III, 22.</page><page sequence="3">NATURAL LAW THESIS: AFFIRMATION OR DENIAL? 43 itself and not merely as a means to some more remote goal. The natural law thesis affirms the cognitive validity of a certain sub-class of such value-judg- ments, namely of moral judgments about what is intrinsically good or just in the field of political or legal institutions and behavior. By implication, the natural law thesis bestows cognitive status on those commands which are logically en- tailed by such intrinsic moral judgments.5 To deny the natural law thesis is to deny that this category of intrinsic value-judgments and the corresponding imperatives are either cognitively valid or invalid. The Invalidity of the Natural Law Thesis. The validity of the natural law thesis depends on the epistemological question of the verifiability of intrinsic value-judgments. Only if value-cognitivism holds true can some particular natural law theory be correct. And even if value-cognitivism is true, some natural law theories must be false, namely those which regard demonstrably invalid norms as natural law commands. Suppose A claims that natural law enjoins everyone to disobey tyrannical laws, and B maintains that obedience to positive law, however unjust, is itself a natural law command. If it can be shown that noncompliance with despotic laws is intrinsically right, A's theory of natural law is thereby validated and B's theory refuted. The opposite would hold if it could be shown that obedience to positive law is always a moral duty. In either case, the natural law thesis itself would be substantiated. To refute the natural law thesis, therefore, one must show that no normative statement such as either A's or B's can be either proved or disproved. Every proponent of the natural law thesis might be expected to deal with the crucial question: given two incompatible intrinsic moral judgments (such as A's or B's), by what method shall we decide which of them, if any, is true and must be included in the catalogue of natural law commands? Yet the history of natural law from Cicero to Maritain reveals that this essential question is hardly ever asked, let alone answered. Most natural law theorists merely pro- claim that there is a "sacred, eternal, divine, absolute law"6 or profess their "unshakable faith in moral and legal values above and beyond the chaos and relativity of mere empirical 'givenness"'7 or assume that there is natural law because we need it so badly. What the natural law theorists hope to be meta- physical atom bombs capable of annihilating their "positivist" or "relativist" foes turn out to be mere firecrackers; to proclaim is not to demonstrate, faith is no substitute for proof, and assumptions must be warranted. I shall be concerned only with those natural law theories which have dealt with the validation of natural law norms, and shall briefly discuss the different methods proposed. I shall take my illustrations from writings of the recent "revival" of natural law, which, incidentally, form a set of very strict varia- tions on a very old theme. ' Cf. R. M. Hare, The Language of Morals (Oxford, 1952), P. 163 f., for a demonstration that a moral judgment such as: "to do x is just" logically entails the imperative: "do x 1" 5 Emil Brunner, Justice and the Social Order (New York, 1945), p. 8. 7 Anton-Hermann Chroust, "On the Nature of Natural Law," in Paul Sayre (ed.), Interpretations of Modern Legal Philosophies (New York, 1947), p. 80.</page><page sequence="4">44 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW (a) Natural Law Based on Divine Revelation. To characterize natural law norms as divine commands has been historically the most important argument for the natural law thesis. As restated recently by the Swiss Protestant theo- logican Emil Brunner, the origin of the dignity shared equally by all mankind is not to be sought in abstract reason, nor in a general order of being, but in the will of the living God.8 The argument that a command-sentence is objectively valid because it was uttered by God cannot be accepted exept by those who happen to believe in an anthropomorphic God who does issue commands, and moreover in the same God as the natural law theorist who uses this argument. As Brunner himself acknowledges: "But one thing is impossible-to believe in justice and yet reject the divine law of justice."9 Consequently, it would be just as impossible for anyone who does not share Brunner's religious faith to "believe in justice," i.e., to support the natural law thesis. Another example is provided by Ernest Griffith's recent statement: It is my hypothesis that the Christian and Hebrew faiths constitute a powerful matrix, a common denominator of those attitudes most essential to a flourishing democracy. Moreover, it would appear that it is these faiths, and especially the Christian faith, that perhaps alone can cloak such attitudes with the character of "absolutes."'0 The last sentence presumably means that the value-judgment "democracy is intrinsically good" is ("absolutely") valid. It follows that those who happen not to adhere to these creeds are bound to deny that democratic attitudes are "absolutes," i.e. that the corresponding value-judgments can be validated. However, a statement which is valid for some and not for others is not valid in the intersubjective sense in which this word is being used in scientific dis- course.11 (b) Natural Law a Self-Evident Truth. In their search for a broader basis, natural law theorists have turned to the concept of self-evidence. Two recent examples of this age-old doctrine: The term Natural Law is defined as that self-evident law which ... remains essentially -that is to say as to its very foundation and justification-independent of conviction or tradition.12 I know the reality of obligations and goodness with as much self-evidence as I know logical, geometrical, or causal necessitation.... I cannot doubt the obligation to keep promises or to spare unnecessary pain.1' 8 Op. cit., p. 39. Brunner becomes quite specific: "Private property is a right established by creation" (p. 148). "In fulfillment of the Creator's gift, man is also, by divine ordinance, granted freedom in the use of his sexual faculties" (p. 60)-with some limitations. 9 Op. cit., p. 46. 10 Ernest S. Griffith, "Cultural Prerequisites to a Successfully Functioning Democracy; A Symposium," this REVIEW, Vol. 50, p. 103 (March, 1956). 11 Catholics like Maritain avoid this pitfall; they consider belief in God helpful but not necessary to an awareness of natural law.

Carritt, Ethical and Political Thinking (Oxford, 1947), p. 43.</page><page sequence="5">NATURAL LAW THESIS: AFFIRMATION OR DENIAL? 45 A sentence is self-evident if it is either psychologically or logically impossible to reject it. As to psychological self-evidence, we need only to remember the attacks on Galileo or Darwin to realize that something is not proven true (or false) by the fact that it is generally and unquestionably believed to be true (or false). Besides, most of the so-called natural laws and natural rights have been far from self-evident in this psychological sense; the fact that they were proclaimed over and over again indicates that there could be, and that there has been, disagreement as to their validity and even as to their desirability. The view that natural law norms are logically self-evident has found its classical expression in St. Thomas Aquinas. As reiterated by Maritain: The only practical knowledge all men have naturally and infallibly in common is that we must do good and avoid evil. This is the preamble and the principle of natural law; it is not the law itself. Natural law is the ensemble of things to do and not to do which follow therefrom in a necessary fashion, and from the simple fact that man is man, nothing else being taken into account.14 A sentence is logically self-evident or logically necessary if it is analytic; i.e., if its denial results in a self-contradiction.'5 If "good" means whatever ought to be done, then "we must do good" is indeed logically necessary-and vacuous. Such a "principle of natural law" does not order us to do one thing and not another. No specific command can be derived either from this empty formula or from that other logically necessary sentence: "man is man." On the other hand, if "good" is defined as characteristic of certain actions and not of others, then "do good!" is a genuine command, but by no means logically necessary. The same dilemma applies to that other age-old adage of natural law: suum cuique. To cite a modern version: That justice consists in rendering to each man his due is the fundamental principle of all natural law.16 As long as the key word "due" remains undefined, the alleged principle "give each man his due!" is vacuous and cannot be violated even by the most ruth- less dictator. As soon as one specifies what is due and to whom, the sentence "suum cuique" acquires normative meaning and ceases to be logically self- evident. (c) Natural Law-Synthetic a Priori. The term "self-evident" or "necessary" is sometimes used to characterize non-analytic, i.e. synthetic, statements held to be true a priori. According to natural law philosophers of the Platonic tradi- tion, words such as "Justice," "Goodness," "Obligation" stand for abstract en- tities which can be perceived or intuited with the "inner eye" or with a sixth sense. According to Del Vecchio, natural law is: essentially transcendent, grasped by the mind a priori as an absolute and universal neces- sity, superior and anterior to any application of experience.'7 4 Op. cit., p. 36; italics Maritain's. 15 E.g., given the definition: "son" is a male offspring, the statement "all sons are male" is analytic. 16 Brunner, op. cit., p. 86. 17 Giorgio Del Vecchio, The Formal Bases of Law (New York, 1921), p. 332.</page><page sequence="6">46 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW Similarly, Barker asserts that: If law is to have value as well as validity it must satisfy, in the last resort, the demands of the general moral conscience, issuing and expressed in a general all-round notion of what is just and right in the conduct of human relations.'8 The Aristotelian variant of this school views natural law as somehow em- bedded in the teleological order of the universe. To quote the philosopher John Wild, one of the most important contemporary spokesmen for realism (as op- posed to nominalism): The theory of natural law also presupposes certain realistic epistemological principles. It implies . . . the capacity of human reason to apprehend . . . the perfective tendencies characteristic of the human species. When so understood and expressed in universal propositions, these tendencies are norms or moral laws. This realistic doctrine is incon- sistent with any view which regards norms as separated from existent fact or as arbitrary constructions made by man.'9 To speak in this fashion of justice as if it were a thing is to commit the fal- lacy of reification, and to ascribe conscious tendency or purpose to anything but particular human individuals is to commit the anthropomorphic fallacy. But the most important argument against ethical a priorism in its Platonic or Aristotelian variant can be put in form of the rhetorical question: If A claims that he has "grasped as absolute and universal necessity" that tyrannical laws ought to be disobeyed and B retorts that the moral duty to obey all positive law is "grounded in the abstract-universal nature of things," by what objec- tive, i.e., inter-subjective, criteria shall one decide whose reason is pure and whose sense of right is wrong? (d) Natural Law Derived from Facts. While the theories just mentioned tend to identify values with facts, naturalism attempts to derive the former from the latter. It seems trivial to point out that no normative sentence can be de- duced from an empirical statement.20 The naturalistic fallacy continues never- theless to tempt critics and defenders of natural law alike. The former try to derive "ethical relativism" from cultural relativity, thereby inviting the reply that diversity of valuations among cultures merely illustrates how many people adopt "wrong" values. Natural law theorists, in turn, take advantage of the more recent trend in cultural anthropology which emphasizes similarities rather than differences between the basic value commitments in different societies.2' Thus Jerome Hall, combining naturalistic with intuitionistic argu- ments, maintains that: The objective validity of moral judgments is known intuitively or, as regards problematic 18 Ernest Barker, Principles of Social and Political Theory (Oxford, 1951), p. 117. 19 John Wild, Plato's Modern Enemies and the Theory of Natural Law (Chicago, 1953), p. 66. 20 Deduction consists in making explicit what is logically implied by the premise; hence the conclusion cannot contain value-terms such as "unjust" or command-words such as "ought" unless the premise does. 21 Cf. Clyde Kluckhohn, "Ethical Relativity: Sic et Non," The Journal of Philosophy, Vol. 52, p. 666 (1955).</page><page sequence="7">NATURAL LAW THESIS: AFFIRMATION OR DENIAL? 47 situations, it is established by . . the consensus of informed unbiased persons and the universality of solutions among diverse cultures.22 As if, e.g., the fact that incest is a universal tabu could be taken as proof that incest is objectively evil and contrary to moral or natural law. One finds a similar argument in the field of jurisprudence: judges "fill the gaps" of the written law with the social norms of the "living law"; therefore, this set of unwritten norms has the quality of "higher," in the sense of natural, law. Judges, no less than legislators, do indeed make value-judgments (e.g., as to which of two conflicting interests is the more important). Certainly, "there is a set of specific values underlying our American legal order,"23 in the sense that there is a specific set of ethical norms which American judges have tra- ditionally implemented in the absence of relevant statutes or decisions. How- ever, the cognitive validity of these norms cannot be inferred from such prac- tices; nor does the fact that judges do apply these standards rather than others prove that they ought to continue to do so, as, e.g., Northrop seems to maintain.24 To argue that something is objectively valuable because it is being valued is to commit the naturalistic fallacy. Another widespread variety of the same fallacy consists in "deriving" in- trinsic value-judgments from pseudo-empirical statements which must be distinguished from mistaken empirical hypotheses. For example, the norma- tive statement "tyranny is unjust and contrary to natural law" has often been deduced from either one or the other of the two following premises: "tyranny is generally disliked"; or "tyranny is contrary to human nature." The former premise is empirical, but false (and even if it were true, the normative conclu- sion would not follow); the latter does not express an empirical generalization at all, and is neither true nor false. Indeed, there is no observation which could either confirm or disprove that tyranny is congenial or contrary to human na- ture. "Human nature" is, at least in this context, devoid of empirical reference and functions as value-expression to commend whatever is said to be in agree- ment with, and to condemn what is said to be contrary to, human nature. Con- sequently, the two sentences "tyranny is contrary to human- nature" and "tyranny is unjust" have the same, normative, meaning. There are many expressions which, like "human nature" function either descriptively or normatively, depending on the context; e.g. "fundamental needs," "social necessity," "true" (for: desirable), "informed, unbiased, sound opinion"25 (for: valuable), "born equal" (for: ought to be treated alike), "can- not" (for: ought not). When such amphibious expressions occur, the chances are that the author, while seemingly building a bridge from facts to values, is 22 Jerome Hall, Living Law of Democratic Society (Indianapolis, 1949), pp. 80-81. 23 Charles E.

II. THE DENIAL OF THE NATURAL LAW THESIS The Meaning of Denying the Natural Law Thesis. There has been widespread misunderstanding as to what it means to deny the natural law thesis, not only among natural law theorists but among critics of natural law as well. Hans Kelsen, perhaps the most influential contemporary opponent of natural law, has also done most to misrepresent the meaning and the implications of the very theory he is trying to uphold. To defend the denial of the natural law thesis it is therefore necessary to criticize critics and supporters of natural law alike. Since the natural law thesis implies the epistemological theory of value- cognitivism, to deny the latter is to deny the former. Following a recent trend in philosophy, I shall use "non-cognitivism" to designate the denial of value- cognitivism. This terminology seems preferable to "ethical relativism" or "positivism," not only because these terms are ambiguous but also because they have themselves become value-words, with an unfavorable connotation. Non-cognitivism maintains that intrinsic value-judgments can be neither valid nor invalid in a cognitive sense; i.e. that they are not capable, in principle, of test by reference to empirical evidence or of proof on logico-mathematical grounds. The denial of the natural law thesis is merely a special application of the epis- temological theory of non-cognitivism to intrinsic moral judgments in law and politics. While it would be logically consistent to deny the possibility of vali- dating certain ethical norms and still to hold that there are objectively valid value judgments in other areas, e.g., aesthetics, I do not know of anyone who has adopted the position of siding with value-cognitivism generally but against the natural law thesis in particular. The Validity of Non-Cognitivism. I believe the natural law thesis to be invalid because I hold value-cognitivism in general to be mistaken and non-cognitivism to be correct. As far as I know, all natural law theorists who have dealt in any way with the question of validation have used arguments similar to those I discussed. I indicated why I think that all these attempts to validate intrinsic value-judgments in general and alleged natural law norms in particular have failed. I am also in agreement with the positive arguments in favor of non- cognitivism, which I shall briefly summarize.2" Value-words do not designate objects, and it is misleading to use nouns such as "Justice" or "Goodness." Nor do value-terms stand for properties, and the adjectives "good" and "just" do not refer to characteristics of men, behavior, goals, or institutions.27 A value-expression in an intrinsic value-judgment 26 Cf. Charles L. Stevenson, Ethics and Language (New Haven, 1944); Alfred J. Ayer, Language, Truth and Logic (2d. ed.; London, 1946), ch. VI; R. M. Hare, op. cit. 27 "Justice is primarily the quality of a social order.... But what does it really mean to say that a social order is just? It means that this order regulates the behavior of men in</page><page sequence="9">NATURAL LAW THESIS: AFFIRMATION OR DENIAL? 49 refers to a relation which holds between an evaluating subject and some object or event or state of affairs which he values intrinsically, whether positively or negatively. Accordingly, to say that freedom of speech is intrinsically good or just is to commend those who protect free speech, not to ascribe to them the quality of being good or just.28 Hence, if A maintains that it is morally right to disobey tyrannical laws and B holds that disobedience to any law is wrong, A and B are not contradicting each other, but expressing their respective, albeit conflicting, value-commitments. The question whether the view of A or B is valid does not arise, because neither A's nor B's statement is either true or false, except in the limited sense that it does, or does not, reflect the speaker's actual value-commitments. Kelsen's statements "that value judgments have only relative validity" and "that only relative values are accessible to human cognition"29 are therefore misleading. Intrinsic value-judgments have no cog- nitive validity (because they have no cognitive meaning); only the fact that something is valuable to someone is accessible to human cognition. Natural law theorists are likely, at this point, to accuse their opponents of being no less dogmatic than they themselves are made out to be. I would reply that non-cognitivism presupposes only the rules of inductive and deductive logic which everybody applies in everyday life as well as in science. Value- cognitivism, on the other hand, assumes the validity of certain intrinsic value- judgments in addition to these same rules. Yet, there is a fundamental differ- ence between the former and the latter. For every conceivable value-judgment, there exists at least one alternative valuation which it is logically possible to adopt; but there is only one set of principles of inductive and deductive reason- ing. What the Denial of the Natural Law Thesis Does Not Imply. To clear up the misconceptions I mentioned before, it is necessary to point out what non- cognitivism in general and the denial of the natural law thesis in particular does not imply. (a) Non-Cognitivism and Empirical Science. According to a widespread belief among both critics and defenders of natural law, non-cognitivism as to values entails non-cognitivism as to facts. Thus, Kelsen seems to think that there are only two possible positions: "philosophical absolutism,"Y which believes in "the possibility of absolute truth and absolute values," and "philosophical rela- tivism, which recognizes only relative truth and relative values."30 Actually, it is just the other way: value-cognitivists, especially of the Pla- tonic variety, tend to contrast the certainty of the knowledge of good and evil a way satisfactory to all men, so that all men find their happiness in it.. . . Justice is social happiness." This sounds like pure value-cognitivism, of the naturalistic brand; yet it was written by Kelsen (in Sayre, op. cit., pp. 390-91). 28 "Value-terms have a special function in language, that of commending; and so they plainly cannot be defined in terms of other words which themselves do not perform this function." Hare, loc. cit., p. 91. 29 Hans Kelsen, "Foundations of Democracy," Ethics, Vol. 66, pp. 38, 42 (1955). 30 Kelsen, loc. cit., p. 16. Kelsen adopts the latter position, but realizes that it leads to solipsism, a "peril" from which he then tries to extricate himself; ibid., p. 17.</page><page sequence="10">50 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW with the unreliability of empirical cognition. Non-cognitivism, while denying that intrinsic value-judgments have cognitive status, do not question the ob- ectivity of empirical knowledge. However, by objective validity they do not mean that empirical hypotheses are absolutely true, but that they can be as- serted with a certain degree of probability relative to a body of observational evidence. There is no "absolute truth" or "certain knowledge" except within a given deductive system. (b) Non-Cognitivism and Extrinsic Value-Judgments. Since non-cognitivism does not doubt the objectivity of empirical knowledge, it cannot question the cognitive validity of so-called extrinsic value-judgments, for the simple reason that these are not value-judgments at all, but empirical statements to the effect that something is an appropriate means to a certain end. For example, given the intrinsic value-judgment that the protection of human life is desirable in itself, the assertion that punishing murder is just (as a means to that end) has the same meaning as the statement: punishing murder protects human life. The disagreement between proponents and opponents of the natural law theory is not about the objectivity of such empirical statements, but only about the possibility of validating genuine, i.e., intrinsic, value-judgments. Indeed, most natural law theorists believe that natural law determines only what is intrin- sically right and just, and rely on empirical science to find out how best (i.e., most effectively) to implement these basic norms. This distinction shows that non-cognitivism should not be made out to claim that value-language always lacks cognitive meaning. Expressions such as: "this is a good chair (or book or poison or law)" must be interpreted in their context. If the speaker or writer means to indicate that something con- forms to a certain value-standard, then "good" functions descriptively, and the statement that such and such is good is subject to empirical test, hence cog- nitive. If he wants to signify that something is valuable in itself, then only does he make an intrinsic value judgment which has directive rather than cognitive meaning. Unfortunately many political and legal philosophers leave their readers in the dark as to whether their value-words should be interpreted in the intrinsic or the extrinsic sense, and in the latter case they often fail to make their underlying values-standard explicit.3' (c) Non-Cognitivism and Value-Commitments. Non-cognitivism does not maintain that value-words, even in the intrinsic sense, are meaningless, but only that they have normative, evaluative, directive, rather than cognitive meaning. Natural law theorists are therefore mistaken when they claim, as e.g., Leo Strauss does, that the denial of natural law implies "the prohibition against value judgments in social science,"32 or, as Brunner puts it: 31 I realize that the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic value-judgments is an over-simplification. Usually, one does not select first some "ultimate" end and then considers the means; rather, one chooses between alternative states of affairs, each of which constitutes a whole network of means and ends, i.e., of causal relations. Cf. below, section (d). 32 Leo Strauss, Natural Right and History (Chicago, 1953), p. 52.</page><page sequence="11">NATURAL LAW THESIS: AFFIRMATION OR DENIAL? 51 If there is no sacred, eternal, divine, absolute law, there is no possibility of denouncing any form of law or polity or national act as unjust.33 Non-cognitivism denies the verifiability of intrinsic value-judgments but does not question the possibility or legitimacy of value-commitments, even in the social sciences, provided they are clearly characterized as such. The same natural law theorists who claim that their opponents cannot logically make any value-judgments accuse them sometimes of being, on the contrary, committed to a specific set of values, namely those underlying totali- tarianism of the extreme Right or Left. According to Brunner, The totalitarian state is simply and solely legal positivism in political practice, the abrogation in actual fact of the classical and Christian ideal of a divine "law of nature."34 This accusation is logically incompatible with the previous one, and just as un- founded. I have indicated that the dispute between the supporters and the op- ponents of the natural law thesis takes place entirely on the epistemological level and does not have any bearing on the level of normative ethics.35 Non- cognitivism, while denying that intrinsic value-judgments have cognitive sta- tus, leaves everyone logically free to subscribe to any set of political and ethical norms. Conversely, the natural law thesis is implied neither by the advocacy of totalitarianism nor by the support of free institutions. Yet, the United Nations General Assembly adopted, in this day and age (December 10, 1948) a Uni- versal Declaration of Human Rights which proclaims, in eighteenth century natural law phraseology, that "all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights" (Art. 1.) and that "everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person" (Art. 3). Evidently, the General Assembly did not in- tend to impose upon everyone the epistemological theory of natural law but merely to recommend to its member governments that they enact a certain kind of legislation. In order not to give a one-sided picture, I should mention that non-cognitiv- ists like Kelsen have made the analogous mistake of claiming that the natural law thesis implies a particular value-system-which could be the case only if this thesis were true. And so we have the amusing spectacle of natural law theorists and their opponents accusing each other of being necessarily com- mitted to totalitarianism.3" 33Loc. cit., p. 8. 34 Loc. cit., p. 7. 5 "For the differences between intuitionists naturalists, and non-cognitivists are differences in metaethics-in particular, they are differences about the nature of norma- tive utterances-and do not necessarily entail any disagreement in normative ethics, that is, on questions about what is good or bad, right or wrong, etc." W.

Contrary to Kelsen's often repeated claim "that almost all outstanding representatives of a relativistic philosophy were politically in favor of democracy, whereas followers of philosophical absolutism, the great metaphysicians, were in favor of political absolutism and against democracy" (loc. cit., p. 34), almost all political doctrines have been defended by proponents and critics of natural law alike.

Some natural law theorists have reacted to this as follows: admittedly, non-cognitivism does not deny cognitive status to extrinsic value-judgments or to other empirical statements but only to intrinsic value-judgments. Admittedly also, the denial of natural law neither precludes value-commitments nor entails any particular normative system. However, if valuations are but the expression of subjective value-feelings, all preferences are therefore capricious, all choices irrational, and all behavior irresponsible. Thus, according to Leo Strauss, the denial of natural law implies that we cannot have any knowledge regarding the ultimate principles of our choices, i.e. regarding their soundness or unsoundness; our ultimate principles have no other support than our arbitrary and hence blind preferences.... We cannot live any more as responsible beings.37 And John Wild criticizes the "extreme irrationalism" of the noncognitive or emotive theory of ethics which reduces the whole phenomenon of ob- ligation to the subjective compulsion of raw appetite or desire.38 To deny the natural law thesis is not to deny that the criteria of rationality are applicable to choosing and acting as well as to thinking. Conversely, ra- tional decision-making does not presuppose that intrinsic value-judgments have cognitive status. It would be paradoxical indeed, if rational behavior depended on belief in a mistaken epistemological theory. To make a rational choice," the decision-maker must predict the conse- quences of each of the alternative courses of action open to him in a given situation. His decision will be rational provided these anticipations are based on the total evidence available to him. Such predictions are, of course, true only with a certain degree of probability, and a decision may be rational, yet unsuccessful, and vice versa. The decision-maker must finally arrive at a comparative evaluation of the alternative states of affairs which he has anticipated. This is the only part of the decision-making process which non-cognitivism considers "arbitrary," in the sense that there are no objective standards for establishing a preference rank order among alternatives. Assuming that the decision-maker's predic- tions are warranted by the available evidence, his decision is rational if he chooses that course of action whose anticipated consequences are, on the whole, more valuable to him than any of the states of affairs he could have realized in- Oppenheim, "Relativism, Absolutism, and Democracy," this REVIEW, Vol. 44, p. 958 (December, 1950). 37 Leo Strauss, op. cit., pp. 4, 6. 38 John Wild, op. cit., p. 215. 89 One of the best introductions to this topic is Ward Edwards, "The Theory of Decision Making," Psychological Bulletin, Vol. 51, pp. 380-417 (1954), (with extensive bibliography).

Accordingly, when persons with different preferences decide differently in similar situations their decisions may be equally rational. Intrinsic value or preference judgments do not in general pertain to any of the alternatives which natural law theorists tend to view as "absolutes." As Dahl and Lindblom have pointed out,40 most people do not prefer any of the "grand alternatives" but desire to reach compromises between such extremes as liberty and security, diversity and conformity, capitalism and socialism. Preferences differ only when the question arises which point on the scale is to be considered the desirable optimum. Valuations apply neither to extreme goals, nor even to single ends, but rather to those alternative states of affairs which the decision-maker anticipates and evaluates as wholes. While different persons may choose differently, yet rationally, one and the same person "cannot have his cake and eat it." Someone who chooses in- compatible goals in the mistaken belief that they can both be realized by means of one and the same course of action, makes an irrational decision unless his mistake was unavoidable in the light of the incomplete evidence available. Thus, it is true that choice is a function of the degree of subjective prefer- ence as well as of objective probabilities. It is also true that unwarranted pre- dictions lead to arbitrary preferences, irrational decisions, and erratic behavior. On the other hand, the correct application of the rules of inductive and deduc- tive logic is a necessary and sufficient condition for arriving at preferences which are consistent and decisions which are rational. In conclusion, I shall answer the value-cognitivist's possible objection that I have tacitly assumed the objective validity of at least one normative prin- ciple, namely of the command addressed to everyone: "act rationally!"-My reply is that I have been referring, not to the intrinsic value-judgment that to act rationally is good in itself, but to an extrinsic value-judgment, namely the empirical hypothesis: whenever you want to bring about the state of affairs which, under the circumstances, will be most valuable (or least disvaluable) to you, apply the rules of rational decision-making. To whatever degree (great or small) it is within your power to influence the future, rational decision-mak- ing will maximize the probability (great or small) that the state of affairs you will help to bring about will be valued by you as the best of all possible worlds. 40 Robert A.
