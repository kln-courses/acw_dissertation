<plain_text><page sequence="1">December 1959 ORNITHOLOGICAL LITERATURE 395 Vol. 71, No. 4 THE BIRDS OF ALASKA. By Ira N. Gabrielson and Frederick C. Lincoln. The Stackpole Company, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and the Wildlife Management Institute, Washing- ton, D. C., 1959: xiv + 922 pp., 13 colored plates by Olaus J. Murie and Edwin R. Kalmbach, 1 fig., 1 map. $15.00. Publication of this volume, appropriately coinciding with Alaska's rise to statehood, provides ornithologists with one of the most useful regional works on any section of North America. A great amount of distributional material has been collated by the authors. Previously published records are nicely summarized and many heretofore unpublished data are made available. The book undoubtedly will stimulate further ornithological activity in the new state. The first 30 pages are devoted to an informative discussion of Alaskan ornithological history, beginning with the early Russian period and continuing through the "Modern Period" to 1958. This section is followed by "Some Interesting Aspects of Alaskan Orni- thology" (seven pages), dealing in part with a brief analysis of the avifauna. Here we are informed that the state list consists of 321 species (or 414 species and subspecies), of which only 162 species (233 forms) are "land birds." Nine species included in the book are not discussed in field guides or other works dealing with North American birds. Three of these, the Common Crane (Grus gruts), Gray-spotted Flycatcher (Hemrichelidon griseisticta), and Gray-headed Thrush (Turdus obscurus) are recent additions not included in the fifth edition of the A.O.U. Check-List. Casual or accidental forms total 104, and 56 of these are Old World birds. Of the 13 forms termed "regular migrants" (not known to nest in Alaska), the authors list only one land bird, Acanthis jlammea holboellii. They consider 174 forms to be permanent residents. The list of summer residents, includ- ing "a few species whose nests have not been actually found but which are almost certain to be breeders-consist[s] of 132 forms of water birds and 189 forms of land birds." However, the next statement tells us that the "total reported in this book is 306 forms of summer resident birds." The number of summer resident species is not given, and I find no statement of the number of forms or species positively known to breed in the state. Addition of the figures for these four categories (permanent residents, summer residents, regular migrants, and accidentals) results in 597 forms-183 more than the state's total as previously given in the text (and also in Tables I and II) ! A discussion of the highly plastic Rock Ptarmigan, Winter Wren, Fox Sparrow, and Song Sparrow terminates this section. This provides a concise summary of the trends of variation within these species, but the treatment of possible causative factors is very superficial. Some material is later dealt with in the species accounts and its repetition seems unnecessary. The next few pages deal wth Alaskan bird migration in terms of Lincoln's flyway theory. Alaska is considered to be the "northern terminus of routes that belong to all four of the major systems" insofar as migratory waterfowl are concerned. Also treated in some detail are four "more or less unique" Alaskan migration routes: (1) an Arctic route from the Alaska Peninsula and Bering Sea islands north along the coast past Point Barrow to the breeding grounds near the Arctic Ocean, (2) an inland route from Norton Sound northeast to the Colville River and the arctic coast, (3) the Asiatic route, presum- ably along the Siberian coast and across Bering Strait to the Seward Peninsula (used by "North American" birds such as Sandhill Cranes and Gray-cheeked Thrushes which breed in Siberia, and by the Rufous-necked Sandpiper, Bluethroat, Yellow Wagtail, Kennicott's Arctic Warbler, and other "Asiatic" birds nesting in northern Alaska), (4) the Pacific oceanic route, traversed by certain shorebirds that breed in Alaska and winter in Hawaii and other South Pacific islands.</page><page sequence="2">396 THE WILSON BULLETIN December 1959 Vol. 71, No. 4 Alaskan ecological zones then are discussed in terms of Merriam's "life zones," of which three occur in Alaska: Arctic-Alpine (coinciding with distribution of Arctic tundra- largely north of the Brooks Range and along the Bering Sea), the Hudsonian (occupying the interior valleys plus "narrow belts around all mountains"), and the Canadian Zone (restricted to a narrow coastal strip in southeastern Alaska). More space is devoted to Nelson's concept of "faunal districts," namely the Sitkan (corresponding to Merriam's Canadian Zone), the Aleutian (southwestern Kodiak Island, the Aleutians, and Pribilofs), the Alaskan (a strip from the Alaska Peninsula along Bristol Bay, Bering Sea, and the Arctic Ocean and including all islands north of the Pribilofs), and the Alaskan-Canadian (coinciding with the Hudsonian Zone of Merriam). Nearly 800 of the 922 pages in this heavy volume are devoted to the species accounts. The detailed descriptions of birds are "adapted or taken verbatim" from various standard works-Alexander's Birds of the Ocean, Bailey's Handbook of Birds of the Western United States, Bent's "Life History" series, Ridgway's and Friedmann's Birds of North and Middle America, and others. They will be useful to workers who lack extensive libraries or who prefer not to carry several bulky volumes into the field. There is no section on field recognition although this topic is occasionally dealt with under other headings. The General Range paragraphs have been condensed from the fifth edition of the A.O.U. Check-list of North American Birds. The important Alaskan Range accounts (for each species or, in the case of a polytypic species, each race) have been based on numerous sources, particularly the card files maintained by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and unpublished reports from hundreds of observers. Some of the Haunts and Habits sections contain much useful information-particularly the accounts of species with which Gabrielson has had extensive Alaskan experience. Consider- able material is taken from Bent's works and other publications. At times the reader is startled upon encountering anthropomorphic phrases or sentences which are out of place and contribute nothing worth while. There are too many careless statements, some of which require re-reading before their meaning is evident. Others are not clear even then. For example, under Sylviidae, on page 676, appears the statement, "Six species or subspecies have been recorded in Alaska." One must himself count the forms, page by page, to learn that four species and two additional subspecies of this family are on the state list. Numerous paragraphs are unnecessarily long owing to poorly worded sentences and repetition of details already discussed in the descriptions. There is a separate hypothetical list at the end of the book but the same information is given in footnotes for some of these species near their regular taxonomic position. Better organization and more careful editing of the Haunts and Habits material surely would have reduced the number of pages in the volume. Nomenclature generally follows that of the A.O.U. Check-list, but notable departures include recognition of Riparia riparia maximilliani (Stejneger), Leucosticte tephrocotis kadiaka (McGregor), and Passerculus sandwichensis crassus Peters and Griscom. The authors have assigned all Alaskan Gray Jays to Perisoreus canadensis arcus, rather than to P. c. pacificus, with no comment or apparent reason for their action. They also consider Anas carolinensis conspecific with A. crecca. Vernacular names are applied to subspecies throughout the book, and no overall specific name is provided for polytypic species. This surely will confuse the already befuddled amateur who has tolerated too many haphazard changes in "common" names during the past decade. In the introductory sections one notes such names as Thayer's Gull, Green-throated Loon, and Lapland Longspur which do not appear again in the book. Some of these, listed later on as Thayer's Herring Gull or Green-throated Arctic Loon cause only temporary diffi- culty, but the reader cannot determine from this book that the Alaska and Lapland</page><page sequence="3">December 1959 ORNITHOLOGICAL LITERATURE 397 Vol. 71, No. 439 Longspurs are one and the same. There are numerous other examples. Anas crecca, here including A. carolinensis, is called European Teal on page 31, Common Teal on page 159, and Green-winged Teal on page 285. The main account of Hylocichla ustulata is under the name of Swainson's Thrush, but there are at least two references to "Olivebacked" Thrush (pages 285 and 537). Names of this type sometimes are hyphenated on one page but not on another. A lack of consistency is likewise noted in use of the possessive in numerous vernaculars formed from men's names, e.g., Sabine Gull on page 23 but Sabine's Gull on page 462. Even the use of capital letters in bird names is not uniform. If one considers the total number of words, there are few typographical errors in the book. However, I noted at least 13, two of which have resulted in the misspelling of ornithologists' names. In addition, several bird names are incorrectly spelled: Picoides appears without the umlaut mark, the race arcticola of the Horned Lark is spelled "articola," and Oporornis appears as "Oporonis." Holboell's Redpoll is misspelled "Holbell's" (on page 30) and MacGillivray's Warbler is incorrectly written with a lower case "g." On the poorly labelled "topography of a bird" drawing (page 52) the tail feathers are called "retrices"; the crown, pileum, and occiput are evidently considered synonymous as are bill and culmen! One would further assume from this picture that nares is a singular word, and that the term scapulars includes all of the upper wing coverts. The other illustrations are not in keeping with the scope and importance of the book. There are no photographs and the single small map is inadequate. The color plates, depicting 52 species, are poorly reproduced-a trait seemingly characteristic of many recently pub- lished American bird books. In my copy three plates are badly out of register and others are lacking in clarity. Such careless work is inexcusable in a publication of this sort-and at this price. The text description of McKay's Bunting does not agree very well with the birds figured on plate 13-strangely situated facing page 338, among the shorebirds. Two outstanding features of the book are the gazetteer (compiled by Myra A. Putnam) and the admirable bibliographic list. The authors endeavored to "compile a bibliography of Alaskan Ornithology that would be as complete as possible." The result is 55 pages and approximately 1,010 titles, suggesting that they have at least come close to their objective. I noted only one minor discrepancy between a text reference and the corresponding title in the bibliography. The tremendous amount of work involved in the preparation of this volume probably never can be fully appreciated by anyone but the authors, for whom the project was entirely a "labor of love" undertaken in spare hours at home for several years until more time became available. It is a major contribution to regional North American ornithology, and most of my criticisms deal with points which will not seriously limit the usefulness of the volume to ornithologists. But it is a pity that a work of this magnitude, one surely to be used by scores of workers for years to come, must be marred by inferior illustrations, and by minor errors, confusing vernacular nomenclature, and loose statements which could have been easily corrected.-DALE A.
