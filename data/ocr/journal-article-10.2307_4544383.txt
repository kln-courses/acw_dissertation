<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ttie Aristotelian Society. I.-CAUSAL EFFICACY. By JOSHUA C. GREGORY. A SAVAGE croons a charm over his spear, or gets a wizard to croon it, to make the spear kill; he also points the spear, sharpens the point, aims truly and throws hard to make the spear pierce. Carveth Read parodies a famous saying to express this double reliance on magical efficacy and natural causes: the savage trusts in magic and keeps his bowstring dry. This double reliance pervades magical thinking: some Malagasy both charm and mesh their nets; when Melanesians construct a canoe, Malinowski reports, they urge the tool of tthe craftsman by magical methods. Socrates' proposal to cure the headache of Charmides by a leaf and a charm playfully perpetuates the double dependence on the medicament and the mnagical power. Magic, through its many methods and many diversities, rests upon a sense of efficacy. This sense of efficacy still rings in the word " cause," though logic, and even science, have tried to wring the causality out of causation. The anaemic reduction of causal efficacy to determinate sequence or logical implication is as historically intelligible as it seems to be mistaken. Pliny told a story of the basilisk in the first century to be repeated by Albertus Magnus in the thirteenth. As a corpse slain by the stare of a basilisk lay on the ground, a horseman rode up to it, touched it with his spear and fell dead. The magical stroke in the basilisk's stare lodged venomously in the corpse to travel up the spear and strike the horseman: the magical power can lurk, move and strike like a thing. The genuinely magical curse, the curse that genuinely blasts, is very like a bullet. The spell, says Carveth Read, is thought of as a force and conceived as a A</page><page sequence="2">2 JOSHUA C. GREGORY. thing. The cynic might remark on the great powers ascribed to spells if, as Robert Burton affirms, they were used to keep people honest. The core-concept of magic is fear of, reliance on, and manipulation of a power wvhich is thought of as a force-thing. In the ideal limit the magical power can do anything in any way at any time and in any place. This sense of omnipotence, however, is constantly checked and constantly qualified from the start. However confidently the spear- man or the fisherman or the canoe-builder relies on magical efficacy, -nature exacts a deference to her established routines. The blunt or badly thrown spear kills no deer; the unmeshed or ill-laid net catches no fish; the canoe must be built as the materials demand and seaworthiness dictates. Science finally supplants magic by conforming to, and recognising, the naturally imposed determinate routines. Collingwood notes that no " science of nature " would be possible if every death and every other event were ascribed to magic. In such a society the notion of magical power might reach the ideal limit of an absolutely capricious efficacy. No such people is known, and probably no such people exists, as Collingwood notes. It is very probable that no such people ever did exist, for the most prinmitive men or the most inveterately magically minded folk must conform to many natural sequences. Experience teaches the flint-knapper, for example, to knap prudently and that magic alone does not chip. Magical rites could be persistently believed to produce the great natural rounds, such as the growths of spring or the witchetty grubs of the Australian Arunta, though the natural rounds are not, in fact, urged by the magic. Magical efficacies could be persistently believed to make the spear kill or the net catch or the canoe float, though natural causal routines, utilized by art, are in fact sufficient. Deter- minate natural causes, however, do tend to wipe out the magic. After the storm had lasted for three days, Herodo- tus records, the Magians finally subdued the winds oni the fourth day by sacrifices and spells. When Herodotus suspected that the storm had spent itself, the sense of natural</page><page sequence="3">CAUSAL EFFICACY. 3 sequence had prevailed over the belief in magical efficacies. Dropping the magic out and leaving natural connexions in, as Herodotus dropped the spells, over-simplifies the complex relations between magical efficacies and deter- minate routines. Magical procedures had their prescribed routines, and natural sequences might mark the paths of magical forces. The powers of spirits, or of supernatural beings, such as gods, complicated thought and rite. The sun, for instance, according to a Peruvian Inca of the fifteenth century, is regular because he moves as an arrow flies where it is shot: determinate behaviour manifests supernatural compulsion. The sense of efficacy pervades the original causal sense, and magic is one testimony to the dynamic feel of things-to the " drive of the universe of which Whitehead speaks. Every event has a cause; every effect has a determinate cause; every cause has a determinate effect; in many recognizable uniformities like causes have like effects. The Law of Causality usually includes these four statements, though now one and now the other may be emphasized or ignored. The varying emphasis, also, may prefer to express the regularity aspect as the Uniformity of Nature. This statement of the Law of Causality will serve, though with Planck's reminder, in The Philosphy of Physics, 1936, p. 43, that the " concept of causality as applied to nature," or the " nature and validity of the law of causality," is difficult to define acceptably. Belief in the immutability -of the Law of Causation kept Tarrant at it, at the search for a " causative answer " to the puzzle. Like Daly King's fictitious The Curious Afr. Tarrant many minds have bowed to the authority in the Law of Causality. Ewing still has i" a strong inclination to regard the principle that every event has a cause as self-evident." Ewing's context reveals in him a sympathizer with the fictitious Tarrant (Arist. Soc., Suppl., Vol. XVII, 1938, p. 98). The Law of Causality presents itself in history very convincingly as its own pass- port. It also goes beyond the evidence, well beyond, for it is as obviously unproved, or unprovable, as it is convincing. Collingwood's supposititious pathologist seeks out causes because all the events of diseases are determinately caused:</page><page sequence="4">4 JOSHUA C. GREGORY. he confidently applies the Law of Causality. He simply accepts the principle, without question and without trying to verify it, because no one has discovered, or can discover, it: the Law of Causality is admittedly presumptive. The pathologist acknowledges both the authority and the widely inferential nature of the law. He may keep his temper when he explains that he sinmply assumes the Law of Causality, but he may be rude because he is touchy about his " abso- lute presupposition " (An Essay on AMletaphysics, 1940, pp. 31 f). According to the theory of orthogenesis an innate tend- ency lengthened the legs and complicated the molars of the horse. This internal orthogenetic change was quite independent of the animal's life in open plains and of its feeding habits. The " obstinate orthogenetic tendency" of biological theory, which follows its own unswerving tenor independently of the environment (Wells, Huxley and Wells, The Science of Life, 1938, pp. 480ff), has a meta- physical parallel in Collingwood's " absolute presupposi- tions." A " constellation" of absolute presuppositions cha- racterizes any society, or any member of it, at any phase of its history. As innate, secluded orthogenetic trends run independently of the environment, so the restless, intricate constellations come from the mind's " own resources " and change from phase to phase by adjustments to internal strains. The absolute presuppositions are used to interpret experience, as the horse does use its lengthened legs to scour the plain or its complicated molars to eat, but they begin and change independently of that experience, as the autonomous orthogenesis proceeds independently of the environment. Causation, or the Law of Causality, is an absolute presupposition : it is used to interpret experience when it is begotten, but experience neither begets it when it begins nor stales it when it fades or ends (Collingwood, I.c., pp. 48ff, 66f, 74ff, 174ff, 197, 268f). The Law of Causation, and thinking dominated by the involved notions, shifts the emphasis from efficacious causes to determinate connexions between events. The pre- occupation of science with determinate orders tends to drop out the efficacy as well as tne magic and then to deny</page><page sequence="5">CAUSAL EFFICACY. 5 that there is any efficacy to drop. Logical analysis, which takes cues from science as Mill did in the last century and many do to-day, acquires the same preoccupation and moves to the same denial. The Law of Causality seems more like an idealized transcript of experience than an enigmatically and wantonly begotten " absolute presupposition." When it rains it becomes wet: this seems too trite to be often said, or said at all, but it is an old saying. Since proverbs often use a single fact to spread a general truth, it may mean " every cause has its fixed effect." However this may be, the Law of Causality has a firm foothold in experience for, as Reid remarks, nature has established constant con- junctions which men observe and " confide in their con- tinuance." Conduct does depend upon a complex of uniformities. Water freezes in winter and not in the scorch of June; the billiard ball does not Inow run slowly forwards from the gentle cue and now leap violently up- wards. " The frost shall freeze " was a proverbial saying, and " the ball runs truly from a true cue " might be. Either spreads a general meaning through a great congeries of constancies which observation notes and conduct trusts. The constancies include obvious successions, such as thunder following lightning, great persistencies, such as water and its properties, and permanencies, such as the enduring crag. Collingwood (p. 48) speaks of modifications in pre- suppositions " created by a process of unconscious thought." There are uiniformities enough to predispose men to anti- cipate " a fixed and steady course of nature." Reid's " inductive principle " is the " prescience " of constant conjunctions. This prescience, this sense of constancy or regularity, suffuses experience and directs conduct uncon- sciously at the first. In this sense the " prescience is not the effect of reasoning " (Reid, An Inquiry into the Human Mind, 1764, Ch. vi, Sect. xxiv)-certainly not of con- sciously discursive reasoning. The impacts of experience are organized into a disposition to expect and rely on uniformities. The explicti formulation of the causal law is intelligibly an inevitable and reflective epitome of experienced, trusted</page><page sequence="6">6 JOSHUA C. GREGORY. and proved constancies. The law also becomes the despair or the prey of logic because experience does not vouch for its affirmation of universally constant connexions. It presents its idealized version of experience in spite of dis- concerting irregularities quite intelligibly. Bacon's prin- ciple, hits are noted but not misses, is not enough, for experience does not prompt the Law of Causality simply by adopting the regularities and dropping the vagaries. When Vesuvius shatters the steady city, the cause has still its appropriate effect. When dry wood burns brightly and wet wood sizzles there is a plain hint to look well round for causes, and in many fields causes are assiduously, and often successfully, hunted. Collingwood's pathologist is per- suaded too evidently by an accumulated mass of organized experience to be the innocent victim of a casual pre- supposition. The Law of Causality is perfectly intelligible as an idealized transcript, or version, of insistent experience. It has a sound core of realized uniformities; it appeals to many causal reductions of apparent irregularities and it persuades because interpretation so often must hunt out determinate connexions if it is to be at all. It obviously generalizes beyond the evidence, it is very assailable logic- ally and recalcitrant to definition, but it has been, and is likely always to be, an indispensable working faith. The Law of Causality may actually be recognizable by these signs as an idealized version of experience. It cannot exclude indeterminacy, for it is obviously only a convincing postulate without certainty, but it may be able to resist deposition even if indeterminacy becomes an established belief. History is a disconcerting comment on Hume's derivation of the " idea of efficiency " from " constant conjunction " (Treatise of Human Nature, Bk. I, Pt. iii, Sect. 14). Magical efficacies do not suggest derivation from regularities, and when emphasis falls on determinate connexions, as in the Law of Causality itself, science and logic frown on efficacy or flatly deny it. Science can easily deny causal efficacies because she only needs the regularities, or " pattern of events," for</page><page sequence="7">CAUSAL EFFICACY. 7 immediate purposes. The analytical chemist, for example, only requires the simple appearance of the white barium sulphate precipitate when he adds his barium chloride reagent to identify the sulphuric acid under test-no causal tie whatever is needed. The vogue of confining science to sheer description, prevalent as the nineteenth century ran into the twentiethi, was only possible because the immediate purposes of science do not need causal ties. When Max Verworn congratulated his own General Physiology on containing no mention of " cause," or Karl Pearson, in 1892, reduced causation to a " routine of experience," and the " idea of enforcement " to residual superstitions about spirits and storm-gods (The Grammar of Science, Ch. iv, Sects. 2ff, 8), the regularities had squeezed out the efficacies. In Poynting's address to Section A of the British Associa- tion, 1899, the aim of science to describe sense-data in terms of sense-data, and the superfluousness of causation are connected with the descriptions of observed similarities in physical laws. It is tempting to argue from unspecified causality in scientific laws to absence of causality in natural process. Dingle notes the normal fading out of causality from physics, and the " sign of incompleteness " in the retention of " a causal relation " during the correlation of experience. Causality may be an " initial necessity " of thought, but it is not a final necessity (Through Science to Philosophy, 1937, pp. 268f.). Mathematical formulations still more obviously ignore causal efficacies and lead to denials of them. Advanced sciences, Lord Russell explains, as in the law of gravitation, drop causes and effects out of their formulze or differential equations, so " cause " should also be dropped out of " the philosophical vocabulary " (Mysticism and Logic, 1919, pp. 180ff). Philosophers are perhaps too apt to credit science with the naive assumption that causal efficacies do not exist because causal relations do not occur in mathematical epitomes. According to Dingle, for example, Einstein has left nothing to be caused (Through Science to Philosophy, 1937, p. 270). Planck decides that " causality is something fundamental " (The Philosophy of Physics, 1936, p. 43), and Einstein, in an epilogue to Planck's Where is Science Going.)</page><page sequence="8">8 JOSHUA C. GREGORY. agrees with the author in refusing to deduce the absence of " causation " from " external reality" from the present inapplicability of the " causal principle " to " atomic physics." Sir Arthur Eddington still refers to " a long chain of causation in the physical world " (The Philosophy of Physical Science, 1939, p. 149). Whatever these scientists may think about causal efficacies, science has not been com- pletely seduced into denying causality, though mathe- matical formulations have been very hostile to efficacious causation. The logician also is hard on the causal efficacies. He likes to express the regularity or law as " If a lobster is boiled, it goes red " or " If X is a man, X is mortal." This drops out causal connexions and simply states bare relations between boiling and reddening or between being a man and being mortal. Since " If A, then B " is the logical form of implication, or entailment, causality risks a reduction from dynamism and efficacy to merely logical relations. For Ryle, for instance, in Analysis, 1937, 4, p. 9, the causal connexion allows inference. Ewing regards the " genuine necessary connexion " of causation as inconceivable with- out the " notion of logical entailment." This raises causality above " merely repeated sequence or concomi- tance," and Ewing's " closer link between cause and effect" seems to recognize personal agency and its physical analogue (Arist. Soc. Suppl., Vol. XVII, 1938, pp. 87, 99). The efficacies are ruthlessly ruled out when Lord Russell can find a meaning for " A causes B " only in "A's existence at any time implies B's existence at some future time " (The Principles of MlIathematics, 1937, p. 476). For Dewey the category of causation is logical (Logic, 7The Theory of Inquiry, 1938, p. 462). Lord Russell ". . . inclined to think that the relation of cause and effect, as ordinarily understood, is a smoothly logical relation manufactured from cruder materials " (Arist. Soc. Suppl., Vol. XVII, 1938, p. 46). The logical handling of causality tends to smooth it into a merely logical relation, and to obscure one great residual truth of magic-the pervasive efficacy of things. Causal efficaciousness, or any manifested causal efficacy, cannot, as it were, be caught on the hop: it cannot be</page><page sequence="9">CAUSAL EFFICACY. 9 perceived in any " one single instance," or comprehended distinctly in any connexion between two objects, or per- ceived as a tie, as Hume justly observes (Treatise of Human Nature, Bk. I, Pt. iii, Sect. 15). The activity in causation, Broad remarks, is probably a more primitive idea than regularity, but it is useless to science and unobservable. Any feeling of activity, he adds, does not guarantee activity in all causation (Perception, Physics and Reality, 1914, Ch. II). When Stebbing, in Philosophy and the Physicists, 1937, pp. 240f, notes the error of assimilating " causal connexions to constraining ties," or of importing " compulsion " extraneously into nature, a review by Broad confirms that for all " competent philosophers " the " meaning of causal determination " does not include " compulsion." Hobson also excludes from natural science the efficient causation which cannot be discovered in phenomena (The Domain of Natural Science, 1923, pp. vi, 79). The pervasive life of the body cannot be caught on the hop-it cannot be perceived as a dissected nerve or a waving arm or a frowning brow can be perceived. Wlhen animation pervades a style it cannot be pounced on at a single point as the sign " tiger " or its meaning can be pinned down by analysis. The sense of efficacy, or of continuously manifested efficacies, pervades experience. It is perhaps most evident, and is usually most readily admitted, in motives or purposes, or in feelings of self-efficacy, or in panic or in other " mental " experiences. Sir Walter Raleigh's " author," who thinks of himself as a cause, thinks so because he feels himself to be one. We sense the power of words over us of which Burke writes ". . . the face that launch'd a thousand ships " rings with an appeal to our sense of efficacy. A sense of efficacy, or of manifested efficacies, pervades perceptual experience. It pervades illusions and veridical perceptions alike, for the eye is as constrained to see the immersed stick look bent in the water as it is to see the stick look straight when it is waved in the air. We realise that our perceptual world is established in us. This pervading sense of pervasive efficacies is probably the fundamental and final guarantee of the inescapable external world- B</page><page sequence="10">10 JOSHUA C. GREGORY. or an integral part of it. The " circumambient efficacious world of beings," Whitehead insists, impresses its "causal efficacy " upon percipients, and experience in the "mode of causal efficacy " is both fundamental (Symbolism, 1928, pp. 65, 46ff) and usually dim in consciousness. The man does realize the efficacy when the flash makes him blink (Process and Reality, 1929, Cambridge, pp. 226, 246). The motorist feels the efficacy when the sudden flash of the red light pulls him up: he does feel it though Price does call the " sense-datum," in this case a red circle, cross or half- moon, " ineffective." Rather curiously, Price depends the assurance of material things more essentially on " horizontal causality " between external bodies than on " vertical causality " between objects and percipients. The sense of efficacy must sweep through the perceptual experience of the external world when promoted by it. According to Price we are first convinced that " causative " things exist, and then conceive c cause " by reflecting on their nature. This does not, perhaps, exclude the sense of the efficacious from the promotion of the original conviction, for a material thing " must have causal characteristics " (Perception, 1932, pp. 86, 101, 146, 150, 178, 309). In any case the concept of cause originates in the pervasive sense of efficacy. Price apparently denies efficacy to sense-data because they are not physical (p. 146). When a sovereign is, or was, minted, it ends a metallurgical process that includes many items such as melting, moulding and stamping. The metallurgical process intelligibly makes the sovereign, but a human purpose, equally intelligibly, makes the making. Various motives, conveniently comprehended under "financial," co-operate with metallurgical processes in a causal complex. However the financial motives may present themselves as the ground or reason of the sovereign, and however puzzling the relations between mind and matter may be, the sovereign does appear in a causal complex of purposes and physical processes, and this causal complex is pervaded by causal efficacies. No crass anthro- pomorphism is involved in this. The lecturer who ascribes a sense of the comic to his manuscript is anthropomorphic- ally wrong ; a lecturer who ascribes the same sense to his</page><page sequence="11">CAUSAL EFFICACY. 11 audience is anthropomorphically right, or usually right. If human purposes or motives are ascribed to physical things, the anthropomorphism is not, simply as such, mistaken. It probably is mistaken, but both physical causes and human purposes may be eJficacies, though differ- ently manifested. The red light is effective on the motorist because it can stir him through his sense of its significance: the whole causal complex includes this stir, the movements of his hands and the arrest of the car. The dynamic feel of things, the sense of manifested efficacies, pervades all experience. The mint is a field of causal efficacies set in the great universal field of causes. If, just as a sovereign is about to drop into currency, a bursting bomb shatters the mint, the effect, the sovereign, that would otherwise occur, does not happen. Lord Russell instances the effect of a fatal dose of arsenic anticipated by a bullet. Since the man is shot dead he does die, and he would have died from the dose, but in this instance, as in the bombed mint, there is causal intervention. Lord Russell argues strangely, by implication, that, because the bomb bumps out the effect of the mint, neither bomb nor mint is a cause (The Analysis of Mind, 1921, p. 94; Mysticism and Logic, 1919, pp. 180ff). If the cosmic efficacies had not placed the sun in his courses there would be no terrestrial gold to mint and no machines or hands to mint it. If the sun suddenly exploded into a fierce sweep of radiation, the restricted, steady causal field of the mint would vanish. Regularities, like the reddenings of boiled lobsters, disclose mnany similarly restricted and steady causal fields, though all such fields involve other fields throughout the whole universal field, and invasions may occur from one field to another. Efficacies may be obviously dynamic, like the shattering bomb, or at least ostensibly static, like the supporting pillars of a church. Price includes impenetrability among the " causal cha- racteristics " of matter, and the rocks piled on a rocky base among the prolonged manifestations of causality (Perception, 1932, pp. 130, 291). An ordinary lighting circuit is a recognizable causal field of dynamos, wires and other items. When the switch-</page><page sequence="12">12 JOSHUA C. GREGORY. on is said to cause the glow in the lamp, a particular event has been selected as cause and another as effect. The choice is logically arbitrary and practically wise, as in many similar instances. The injunction, or statement, if you pull the switch over the light will glow, is like the logical formulation of a natural, or causal, law. It obviously pre- supposes a sufficiently steady causal field, for if a dynamo fails or a wire breaks the switch is pulled. ineffectively. The necessity, so, far as there is necessity, does not lodge in the abstracted, or logical, relation, pulled switch-glowing lamp, but in the relevant causal field. Cause-effect relations usually are abstracted from causal fields. " If a lobster is boiled, it turns red " is a homely instance, though the first boiled lobster probably startled the cook, but it is instructive. Like a scientific law it mentions no efficacies, and like scientific regularities it pre- supposes a relevantly constant causal field. An abnormal pigment, for example, might turn the lobster green. An entailment, If A, then B, is, strictly speaking, absolute and necessary, though it can be softened into If A, then probably B. The boiled lobster reddens regularly enough to illustrate the connexion between entailment and causality. The entailment, If a lobster is boiled, it turns red, essentially states a repetitive regularity of sequence, and epitomizes a consequence of efficacies manifested in sufficiently determinate ways in sufficiently determinate causal fields. The necessity of the connexion between boiling and reddening resides in the relevant causal field: it is not absolute if an abnormal pigment can destroy it. " There is only logical necessity." Though Wittgenstein also says, " Death is not an event of life," death is very like a grim natural necessity. If a man is born, he will die: this truth makes Wittgenstein's " A necessity for one thing to happen because another has happened does not exist " sound oddly (Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, 1933, pp. 181, 185). The birth-death causal relation seems to be an inevitable consequence of a causal field. Cosmic cata- clysms, such as the earth perishing by fire, or terrestrial catastrophes, such as death in battle, confirm the inevit- ability. It has not, perhaps, the absolute, or logical,</page><page sequence="13">CAUSAL EFFICACY. 13 necessity of which Wittgenstein speaks, for a subtly con- trived elixir might break the causal course, but the familiar " If X is a man, X is mortal " is usually accepted as a genuine entailment. Socrates is a man, therefore he is mortal: this follows logically from the original entailment. If X is a man, X has red hair, Socrates is a man, therefore he has red hair: this is also logically valid. Logical validity is clearly different from causal connexion, and the necessity of the man-mortal entailment lies in a causal complex which ensures the inevitable causal connexion between birth and death. If the very simplified balance-sheet of a firm runs, expenses /310,000, takings /12,000, and profits C32,000, it assesses the consequences of many activities. So " all men are mortal " assesses a causal complex. Valid infer- ences can be drawn from the assessments whether the assess- ments are sound or unsound, but they depend for their final value on the justice of the assessments. Erroneous postulates are, at least, more readily confuted because logically valid deductions from them can be empirically checked. The discovery that Socrates has not red hair ruins the original entailment because a red-haired Socrates is a valid inference from it. If the inference were not valid the colour of Socrates' hair would be irrelevant to the entailment. The end of a time-fuse is lit; the fuse burns along to the charge and explodes it. This instance, used by Colling- wood in pp. 314f of his Essay on Metaphysics, raises, among other questions, the simultaneity and sequence of causes and effects. "The cause of the explosion is where the explosion is." It does not seem to be necessary here to settle the vexed question of the relation between the dis- crete and the continuous. In the causal field of the ex- plosion there will be, presumably, simultaneously and successively manifested or operative causes. If lighting the fuse is selected as the cause it is obviously temporally prior to the explosion-the selected effect. The chosen cause, or effect, is selected for obvious practical reasons, and without denying the total causal field. In all practical procedures or theoretical discussions causes and effects are c</page><page sequence="14">14 JOSHUA C. GREGORY, CAUSAL EFFICACY. thus selected. There need be no difficulty for the smoker who must fill his pipe before he smokes it, or for the analyst who contemplates the whole causal field. The vexed question of temporal priority, like the vexed question of necessity, is eased, if not completely clarified, by referring causal connexions to the variously manifested efficacies in causal fields. The supporting rocky base and the supported rocks are co-existent, but temporal sequence often does determine the choice of causes and effects, because they are so often picked from processes. The finish on the mountain peak results from an intention or desire to climb. A thick fog may break the causal course by invading the causal field. If the climber is challenged to climb the peak, and responds, the challenge would be the chosen cause. Relevant causes and effects can be chosen diversely from causal fields, and either cause or effect or both may be mental or physical- to use a convenient, if incompletely clarified, distinction. The sense of efficacy may direct the choice-the challenge, for instance, especially to a climber easily pricked, is recog- nizably efficacious. Recognizable causal runs also seem to determine choices of causes and effects. Regular sequences fairly obviously direct the recognition of causal runs. The causal run in the boiled and reddened lobster is clear. As long as the lobster is plunged in enough boiling water it does not matter whether it is boiled in a small pot or a great cauldron, whether the water is boiled by gas or electricity, whether the water is fed from a well or a tap, or whether the cook is old or young. The suc- cession of day and night is a reasonable guarantee of causal connexion, but it does not lie on a causal run in the same way as the boiling and reddening. The causal run is represented by the rotating earth, and the sequence is its intelligible consequence. The identification of causal runs is a product of experience and reflection, which may include the sense of efficaciousness in different degrees. Efficacy pervades this dynamic universe, and causal runs canalize the manifested efficacies.</page></plain_text>
