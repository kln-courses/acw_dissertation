He maintains that the authority for the text is the consensus ('ijmaC) of the nation as a whole and not a tradition leading back to a small group of sages or scribes. He concedes, however, that in the case of differences between the Tiberian and the Babylonian texts of the Bible, the former is preferred due to its being a more reliable tradition. He is forced to make this compromise on his notion of consensus by practical necessity. Similar notions regarding the authority of Scripture are found in Islam. In the early Islamic sources consensus is regarded as the crucial source of authority for the text of the Qur'ain. Eventually, however, Muslim scholars submitted to practical necessity and restricted the basis of authority to the tradition of specific Qur'dn readers. In a number of passages of his monumental work Kitab al- Anwar wal-mardqib,1 the Karaite author al-Qirqisani (first half of the tenth century) expresses his opinions about the text of the Bible. These include his views concerning the basis of authority upon which the text rests and those concerning the history of the text. In most cases these take the form of rebuttals to opinions which he attributes to the Rabbanites. A section (11. 12) detailing the arguments of the Rabbanites for the necessity of the tradition of the sages and its validity includes the Rabbanite argument that the tradition of the sages is the authority for the correct reading of the biblical text (11.12.3): The proponent of this [doctrine] argued as follows: Whoever opposes the sages, i.e., the Rabbanites, let it be said to him, "If when reading the Torah you follow the way it is written, you I Ed.

If a scribe errs in one letter with re- gard to defective and plene spelling, the sages know its place and its function. They have even ascertained the number of words, letters, and verses, and they have transmitted it (masaruha). Al-Qirqisani refutes this view (11.13.8) by claiming that in such cases, where the written text does not correspond directly to the way in which it is read, the correct reading is established not by the authority of the sages or by that of any specific group of people. 2 I.e., the letter W, when written without diacritics, can be read as either sh or s. Despite this ambiguity the reader knows in which words it is realized as sh and in which it is realized as s. Cf. the responsum of Hai Gaon (939-1038) T-S 8G5, ed. J.

There are three sources: Scripture (al-nass), reasoning by analogy (qiyas), and consensus ('ijmd'). Al-Qirqisani notes that some of his coreligionists name the third source "transmission" (naql). The same basic notion, however, is understood by both terms. Al-Qirqisani himself uses them together to refer to a single concept. This concept is defined as the agreement on something by the whole nation, including all of its sects, and its transmission by the whole nation from genera- tion to generation. Such is the true naql and ijjmdc4 It is not some- thing which is attributed to a specific group of people (huwa ma lam yakun mansiban gild qawmin bi-'a'yanihim).5 For instance, the knowledge of the incidence of the Sabbath is validated by the fact that it is the tradition of the entire nation. It is not based on the authority of a specific group of people. The biblical text is also established by this principle (11.18.5): Analogous to the Sabbath in respect of the true consensus and transmission (al-'ijmd' wal-naql al-sahfh) is the correctness of the Torah and of the other books of the prophets, which are in the hands of the entire nation ('umma) from East to West, with- out differences, additions, or omissions, but with the same text. The addition or omission of a verse occurs only in some copies by oversight or error. If an omission occurs, everyone recognizes that it is an error. They transmit it [= the text] from age to age, from the time of the prophets until the present. The same applies to the [tradition of] the shape of the letters of the alphabet, their ordering, and organization. Al-Qirqisani then deals with the claim of the Rabbanites that the present text of the Torah is not the one which was produced by 3 Cf. also 11.18.9. 4 Later Karaites also considered consensus and transmission to be two aspects of the same basic concept, e.g, Hadassi, Eshkol ha-Kofer (Gozlow, 1836), Alph. 169b; cf. S. Poznanski, "Anan et ses ecrits," REJ 44 (1902): 182; Z. Ankori, Karaites in Byzantium (New York, 1959), pp. 218ff. 5 P. 14210, 21</page><page sequence="4">62 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Moses but is a later version written by Ezra (II.18.6).6 The Rab- banites support this doctrine by the eighteen "corrections of the scribes" (tiqqune soferim). These constitute eighteen places in the Bible where, according to the Rabbanites, the original text has been changed (11.18.7). Al-Qirqisani denies that the text has been changed in these places. He claims that in all these cases the text is the original one. He bases his objection on the grounds that the doctrine of the tiqqune soferim is not a tradition established by consensus (laysa naqlan wa-la 'ijmd'an) (11.18.8): It has only recently become generally accepted. [At first only] a few scribes and vocalizers noted it in the codices, then [the doctrine] became more widespread. The proof of this is that there is no basis ('asl) for it in the old codices. Its origin is in the books of the Rabbanites, specifically in Sifre. We have already stated that what has been transmitted from a specific group of people and attributed to them is not a valid tradition established by consensus. Other arguments are adduced by al-Qirqisani against the doc- trine of the tiqqune soferim. It implies that the alleged authors of these changes, Ezra and Nehemiah, were wiser not only than the prophets but also than God himself. Moreover, if Ezra the scribe had made changes in the text, it is inconceivable that he would have recorded the earlier version of the verses, thus perpetuating them (11.22.2). If the motivation behind the tiqqune soferim was the re- moval of unacceptable references to God, especially those of an anthropomorphic nature, why were many other anthropomorph- isms left in the text (11.23.9)? In section 11.23 al-Qirqisani discusses the ketiv and qere. He re- jects the view of Isma'cl al-'UkbarT that the qere represents innova- tions and that the text should always be read according to the ketiv. The validity of the qere is established by the fact that there is a consensus among the nation that the words in question should be read differently from the way they are written. They do not ascribe this to the teaching of a specific group of people. With regard to the qere perpetuum of the tetragrammaton al-Qirqisanm states: 6 Cf. also 11.19.1, where al-QirqisanT mentions the view of the Rabbanites that during the time of the kingdom (al-dawla) the nation possessed only one copy of the Torah and that this was lost, so the Torah followed by the nation at present is not the original Torah produced by Moses.</page><page sequence="5">AL-QIRQISANI ON THE BIBLE--KHAN 63 We should like to demonstrate that nobody among the nation has [ever] read it according to the way it is written. If it were feasible that the reading had been changed and [the original] abandoned by all the nation from East to West or [that the read- ing had been changed] and they read what was not written, it would have been feasible for the same to happen to the text itself (al-'asl), [that is, for] passages and precepts to be removed, [the text] being thus changed, as we have mentioned previously.7 If the Rabbanites had been able to do this with regard to the qere and ketiv and the like, they would have changed everything which opposed their doctrines. But we have found many state- ments contradicting their claims clearly expressed in Scripture. The truth, therefore, is that they have not been able [to change] it and have not corrupted it, since it was widely distributed in the entire world (f T al-'alam bi-3asrihi). Al-Qirqisani here argues that when the text is read differently from the way it is written it should not be assumed that the written form is the original one and that the reading tradition is an innova- tion. He subsequently returns to the practice of Isma'll al-'UkbarT, who read Scripture as it was written (11.23.6). It is argued that this form is not correct, on the grounds that the reading tradition, and not the written form, expresses the correct meaning of the text: He would have to read JnlY1WV '3-1'W (Ps 119:166) with a shin and say rl M, so that it does not have [the sense of] 'hope' but comes [to mean] 'I have broken'. Likewise he would have to read 'ID)m t'U'W (Ps 109:162) as VW, so that it does not [have the sense of] "joy" but comes to mean "six." Also he would have to read 0b1W with a shin, and he would have to read every [in- stance of the word] ;7IY in the Torah as 1Y in accordance with the way it is written, so that it would mean "boy" and not "girl." There are countless other words of the same kind which lose their meaning and become impossible (istahala) if they are read according to the way they are written. Al-Qirqisanr goes on to point out that the written form of every word in Scripture can be read in several different ways. The cor- rectness of one reading rather than another can only be established by the 'ijmda of the nation (al-'umma). This represents the correct 7 A reference to the discussion of the tiqqune soferim.</page><page sequence="6">64 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW reading transmitted from generation to generation since the time of the prophets, even if it does sometimes conflict with the way the word is written (11.23.7). In sum, the import of al-Qirqisdnl's statements is that traditions about changes in the biblical text and in the reading tradition which allegedly occurred in the past should be rejected. The correct original text and reading tradition are to be identified with those upon which the whole nation agrees at present. So far the discussion has concentrated on general aspects of the text and of the reading tradition which were not the subject of differ- ences among Jewish communities. The deviations from the con- temporary 'ijmda of the nation as a whole which are mentioned are either hypothetical (e.g., 'rLnV instead of 'f1nt) or rejected Rab- banite traditions about past usage (e.g., the tiqqune soferim and the claim that a word was sometimes read according to the ketiv rather than the qere), or are those of small extremist minorities of no importance, such as Isma'll al-'Ukbarl and his followers. Al- Qirqisanl, however, is well aware that in his day there were numer- ous differences among Jews with regard to the scriptural text and reading tradition which would appear to invalidate the principle of the 'ijmd' of the entire nation. These were not differences adhered to by only a small minority, such as was the case with Isma'l al-'Ukbarl. The two major centers of Jewish culture, Palestine and Iraq, followed slightly different textual and reading traditions of the Bible. Clearly the principle of the 'ilmd' of the entire nation sanctioning a tradition implied that both the Palestinian and the Iraqi centers acted in unison. The use of the universal 'ijmd' principle to establish the correct text and reading tradition was therefore an ideal which was not always workable in practice. Al-Qirqisani cites the views of the Rabbanite Ya'qub ibn 'Ifraym (Jacob ben Efraim)8 with regard to the differences between the Palestinian and Iraqi centers (9ahl al-Sham wa-9ahl al-'Iraq) in the text and reading tradition of the Bible (IL. 16). Having adduced ex- amples of several words and phrases which occur in the reading 8 This Rabbanite scholar is mentioned a number of times in the Kitab al-Anwdr (cf. Index). The statement in 1. 11.2, la-qad sa9altu Ya'quib ibn 9Ifraym al-ShamT fa-qultu lahu, indicates that he was a contemporary of al-Qirqisani. For further references, cf. B. Klar, Mehqarim wa-'Iyyunim ba-Lashon ba-Shirah u-ba-sifrut (Tel-Aviv, 1954), p. 321, n. 7, and Jewish Encyclopedia, s.v.

The Iraqi tradition is fol- lowed by large numbers of people over a very wide geographical area. In fact, those who follow the Iraqi tradition are greater in number than those who follow the tradition of the Palestinians. If anything had been omitted, it would therefore be more likely that the omission occurred in the Palestinian tradition. The Iraqi tradi- tion has a validity equal to that of the tradition of the Palestinians. It is therefore acceptable for God to be worshiped by both traditions.9 Al-QirqisdnT refutes this (11. 17). He claims that God can only be worshiped with one reading tradition and that the only valid tradi- tion is that of the Palestinians ('ahl al-Shdm).'0 It is unreasonable to suppose that verses were uttered by God and committed to writ- ing in two parallel but conflicting versions (II.17.3). In some cases the differences in the reading tradition entail important differences in meaning (II. 17.4). One of the traditions must have developed as a result of changes introduced into the original. It was impossible (muhdl) for the Children of Israel who remained in the Land (of Palestine) to change the original reading. It follows therefore that it 9According to a statement in the Pentateuch commentary of Ibn Bal'am (A. Neubauer, Journal Asiatique, 5e serie, 18 [1861]: 452-453), Saadiah also held that the Babylonian and Palestinian traditions were of equal validity on the grounds that they were the result of two separate revelations (tanzTlayn). A similar view is expressed in a masoretico-grammatical work on the equal validity of the qere and the ketiv (S. Baer and H. L. Strack, Die Dikduke ha- Te'amim des Ahron ben Moscheh ben Ascher und andere alte grammatisch-massorethische Lehrstucke [Leipzig, 1879], p. 922-24): 1T DyD nl?3ll3 '2V71 X'12o ITT W'Ml '271 O'?3 '2V7 DtD? -Tnnl rn1n -?nm xmz' nF1 trnint n n'nim 1T On1 trhn l.1W1 "The prophet spoke on two separate occasions and in two places.

This conclusion is supported by the fact that there are differ- ences within the Iraqi communities regarding the reading tradition (11.17.5), and that their pronunciation of Hebrew has been influ- enced to a great extent by the local vernacular languages (11. 17.6). l The position of al-QirqisanT with regard to the biblical text is as follows. The text and reading tradition of the Bible are validated by the 'ijmd' of the entire nation (al- umma). Where there is no over- riding consensus in the nation as a whole with regard to certain aspects of the tradition, it is the reading (qirii'ii) of the Palestinians ('ahl al-sham) that is the correct and authoritative one. That is to say, the correct tradition is established by the 'ijmd' of the 'ahl al-shiim rather than that of the nation as a whole. There are a number of parallels between the bases of authority adopted by al-QirqisanT for the correct biblical text and those adopted by Muslim scholars from the second to the fourth cen- turies AH to determine the correct reading of the text of the Qur'an. The early generations of Qur'an readers felt a considerable amount of freedom in determining the reading of the 'Uthmanic fixed consonantal text. They often adopted one reading of the con- sonantal text rather than another on the basis of their judgment of its grammatical "correctness," unconstrained by any other cri- teria. 12 By the time of the 'Abbasid period, however, in the middle of the second century AH, the freedom allowable in the choice of Qur'anic readings began to be narrowed down. This was achieved by the introduction of two conditions for the selection of a reading, in addition to the requirement that it be grammatical and in con- formity with the fixed consonantal text: the condition that the reading must be based on the normative usage of prestigious readers of earlier times, and that the reading must be agreed upon by a majority of readers. The two conditions were not necessarily " Kitdb al-Anwar 11.16-17 was translated into Hebrew with accompanying notes by B. Klar, Mehqarim, pp. 320-328.

These principles soon prevailed over considerations of grammati- cality. Grammarians, for instance, began to accept readings which they recognized as grammatically inferior to other possibilities but preferable on account of their having been established by the agree- ment of a majority. Examples of such an attitude are found in the works of the grammarians STbawayh (d. ca. AH 180/796-7 CE)13 and al-Farra' (d. 207/822). 14 This stance can be interpreted as transitional between the earlier and freer attitude and the later cus- tom of considering all readings established by other principles to be grammatically superior.15 The grammarian 'Isa al-Thaqafi (d. 149/766) shows the earlier attitude by adopting readings which are against those of the majority if he judged them to be more grammatical. 16 The sources of authority for establishing the correct reading of the consonantal text of the Qur'an which are recognized by STbawayh are those of the majority (qira'at al-'aimma) and the model of former authoritative sources (al-sunna). He, in fact, identifies the one with the other, as is shown by his statement: al- qird'a lI tukhalaf li'annaha al-sunna, "The reading [of the major- ity] is not to be disputed, because it is the normative usage." 17 This expresses the view that the majority reading has religious sanction, since it is the normative ideal usage of the community. This notion of sunna and its merging with consensus is found also in the doc- trine of the ancient schools of Islamic jurisprudence before al- Shafic.l8 Al-Farra' also regards the agreement of the majority of the readers and the traditions of the ancients as sources of authority for establishing the correct reading. When referring to these, he generally uses the terms 'ijtima' and 'dtdr. Occasionally he also employs the term 'amma or 'awamm for the majority.19 He men- tions 'ijtimi' and 'atair in juxtaposition, e.g., wa-law la kardhiyyat 13 Cf. Beck, ibid., p. 206. 14 Cf.

For him the authoritative majority were the authori- tative Qur'an readers of the past in the Islamic centers of Kiifa, Basra, and the Hijaz.21 His notion of 'athdr includes the reading tradition of individual authoritative readers.22 It is instructive to compare again the development of the doctrine of the ancient schools of Islamic law, where, at least in Iraq, the notion of con- sensus was sometimes identified with the teaching of individual authorities.23 By the beginning of the third century AH, the "majority principle" was widely used to establish the reading of the Qur'anic text. This was due mainly to the work of 'Abui 'Ubayd (d. 224/834) and 'Abiu Hatim (Sahl ibn Muhammad) al-SijistanT (d. 255/ 869).24 The application of the "majority principle" in the selection of readings excluded those of small minorities and tended to create uniformity in the Qur'anic text.25 In cases where there was no agreement by a 20 Kitab ma&amp;nT al-Qur'dn on Siira 22:13, cited by Beck, p. 213. 21 Beck, "Arabiyya," p. 213. 22 Ibid., p. 218. 23 Schacht, Origins, p. 87.

The "majority principle" was, however, not totally discarded and is still found in some sources from the fourth century AH and later.28 The traditions of the canonical readers in the system introduced by Ibn Mujahid were held to be mutawatir, that is, they were transmitted in each generation not by individuals but by a general consensus.29 This differs from the earlier period, in which the consensus was generally identified with the traditional ideal practice. According to the system introduced by Ibn Mujahid, the consensus transmitted the reading of a specific individual. The development of the sources of authority for Qur'anic read- ings corresponds in many respects to the development of the sources of Muslim jurisprudence. In the early period the 'ijmdc of the members of the schools of Islamic law was a major source of authority. The `ijmdc of the whole Muslim community was also taken into account. The notion of 'ijmdc merged with that of sunna, which was used to refer to the traditional ideal practice of the school. The ancient schools opposed the traditionists ('ahl al-hadTth), who maintained that legal authority should be ascribed to traditions transmitted from Muhammad. In the second half of the second century AH, al-Shafi'i (d. 179/796) vindicated the doc- trine of the traditionists. He accepted the 'ijmdc of the entire community as a source of authority but rejected that of the scholars of individual schools of law. He severed the conceptual link be- tween -ijmdc and sunna by interpreting the latter as referring only to traditions about Muhammad.

The need was felt for closed unassailable traditions of reading sup- ported by unimpeachable isndds. This could only be achieved by following the tradition of individual readers. Al-Qirqisani's ideal of making the ijmd' of the entire Jewish community the source of authority for the fixing of the biblical text was equally unworkable. He was obliged to restrict his notion of the universal authoritative majority to that of the Palestinian community, on account of the differences between the traditions of the Iraqi and Palestinian centers. Comparison with the development of the Muslim doctrine would lead one to expect that the practical unfeasibility of the ideal of the "majority principle" would eventually lead to the acceptance of a "tradition principle," whereby the reading and text tradition of a specific individual and his school would become the basis of author- ity for the biblical text. Many Karaites in the Middle Ages did indeed adhere wholeheartedly to the tradition of a specific school, namely the Ben Asher school of the Tiberian tradition.32 As we have seen, the main element in al-Qirqisani's criticism of the Rabbanites with regard to the biblical text is his opposition to a specific group of individuals constituting a source of authority. He does not object to the authority of transmitted knowledge in general. In fact, he identifies 'ijmd' with naql (see above). He uses the same argument to refute the validity of Muslim traditions. Since they were transmitted on the authority of a small group, which is liable to collusion and lying, they were unreliable.33 He 31 Beck, "Arabiyya," p. 224. 32 Cf., for instance, the Karaite commentary on Genesis published by Mann, Texts and Studies, 2:104-105; Al-FasT, Kitab Jdmic al-'alfaz (ed. Skoss), l:lxxxi. The colophons of the old Tiberian Hebrew Bible codices vocalized by members of the Ben Asher family also indicate that they were purchased by Karaites in the Middle Ages; cf.

The probative value followed from the existence of 'ijma'. It does not require any proof that the information it conveys is true.38 As has been remarked, certain Karaites in the Middle Ages regarded the Tiberian Masoretes as the transmitters of the correct reading and textual tradition of the Bible. It appears that at the end of the Masoretic period a number of Karaites took it upon themselves to preserve the Tiberian Masoretic tradition accurately. 'Anwdr, 30014-3014. 3 It is well known that the Karaites were influenced by many doctrines of Mus- lim Mu'tazilT theologians. For Mu'talizT ideas elsewhere in al-Qirqisanm's Kitlb al-Anwar, cf.

A similar fideistic accep- tance of the probative validity of 'ijmd' and the rejection of traditions is expressed by 'Abii al-Husayn al-BasrT, who was the pupil of 'Abd al-Jabbar, cf. Kitdb al- mu'tamadf T 'usuil al-fiqh (Damascus, 1384/ 1964), pp. 457-540. Elsewhere 'Abd al-Jabbar states that 'ijmd'is supported by the Qur'an and sunna, cf. Sharh, p. 89. The extreme rationalist Mu'tazilT al-Nazzam and his school, however, had mis- givings about the reliability of 'ijmd', on the grounds that information has to be supported and ascertained before it can form the basis of 'ijmd', i.e., 'ijmda is only the consequence of truth, not the source of truth, cf. 'Abd al-Qahir ibn Tahir al-BaghdadT, Kitdb 'usuil al-dTn (Istanbul, 1928/ 1346), pp. 19-20).</page><page sequence="14">72 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW To this end they acquired many of the Tiberian model Bible codices vocalized by members of the Ben Asher family.39 Clearly the opinion that the correct tradition of the biblical text and its reading was attributed to a small circle of scholars was diamet- rically opposed to al-Qirqisan1's ideal of the "majority principle" as the source of authority. According to the list of Masoretes published by J. Mann,40 the chain of Tiberian Masoretes began with Ezra the scribe. Al-Qirqisani himself had to compromise on his theoretical ideal and submit to practical necessity by restricting the scope of his 'ijmd'. In the parallel Islamic tradition practical necessity triumphed over the ideal of 'ijmd' with the institution of the canonical readers- by Ibn Mujahid. It appears that the same forces of practical necessity asserted themselves in certain circles of medieval Karaites. Some Karaites shared al-Qirqisan1's views. Half a century later, for instance, Sahl ben Masliah expressed the idealistic view that the Jewish nation as a whole transmitted the Bible and that its correctness was vouchsafed by their unanimous recognition of it. Not all Karaites, moreover, submitted wholeheartedly to the authority of the Tiberian Masoretes. The twelfth-century Byzan- tine scholar Elijah ben Abraham pointed out the differences not only between the eastern and western Masoretes but also the disagreements between the Tiberian Masoretes themselves in mat- ters of orthography. His implication was that the tradition of the Tiberian Masoretes was unreliable, at least with regard to the written form of the biblical text .42 There is also a group of Karaite texts which, I believe, were produced as a result of the tension between the harmonizing "majority principle" and the practical necessity of the adherence to the "tradition principle" of the Masoretes, indicating that the 3 See above, n. 32. 40 The Jews in Egypt and in Palestine under the Fatimid Caliphs, second edition (New York, 1970), 2:44. 41 Sefer Tokhahot, in Liqqute Qadmoniyyot, ed.

The texts to which I am referring are the medieval Karaite transcriptions of the Hebrew Bible into Arabic script.43 These texts reflect the standard Tiberian reading tradition of Ben Asher. They are generally vocalized with Tiberian vowel signs and accents. A number of slightly different transcription systems are used in the manuscripts. They are not letter for letter transliterations of the Tiberian consonantal text. In all cases they employ a higher proportion of scriptio plena than does the Hebrew orthography of the traditional consonantal text and they exhibit a systematic use of matres lectionis. In this way they transcend the difference between the Masoretic schools with regard to the orthography of the written tradition. The transcrip- tion represents the reading tradition but not the written tradition, so in cases where the qere conflicts with the ketiv, only the qere is expressed. This overrides the possibility of the biblical text offering two sources of authority, one on the basis of the way it is read and the other on the basis of the way it is written. Such a doctrine was adhered to by the Rabbanites. It was expressed in the Talmudic dictum nlr1OtnM Dx xnp V' W. We have seen that al-Qirqisani vigorously refuted the notion that there can be two equally valid traditions of the Bible. This was also the position taken by Elijah ben Abraham. The concept of more than one authoritative tradi- tion of Scripture is a typical feature of the "tradition principle." When the "tradition principle" of Ibn Mujahid was adopted in Islam, there was not one canonical reading but seven, and this number subsequently increased. A number of Karaites who had adopted the "tradition principle" predictably accepted the concept of rrriot3 5 2 v'" W.44 This was not acceptable accord- ing to the unifying "majority principle." 4' For a more detailed description of these texts and of their background cf.
