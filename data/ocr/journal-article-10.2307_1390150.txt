<plain_text><page sequence="1">RESPONSE TO COBB 8. The emphasis on difference and not imposing pregiven concepts on what one encounters should not lead to talk of incommensurability. What is incommensurable before interaction becomes in some measure commen- surable through interaction. The transformed views of each dialogue partner have elements of commensurability absent before the interaction occurs. 9. The language of incommensurability is associated with the view of static linguistic systems rather than dynamic traditions. Intentionally or not, it encourages conservatives who falsely think that faithfulness to a tradition is expressed by refusal to learn from others or to respond creatively to new challenges. This is a central point in the contemporary church struggle between liberationists and conservative traditionalists. 10. The academy should not lend its support to an inaccurate under- standing of religious traditions that blocks progress in religious communities. NOTE 1. Guy Richard Welborn, The Buddhist Nirvana and Its Western Interpretation (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1968). Interreligious Permeability DAVID BLUMENTHAL Emory University ABSTRACT John Cobb's comments on the permeability of religious traditions helps us use the language of the other to articulate more clearly our own traditions, see that understanding leads to more posi- tive interreligious interaction, and maintain our individuality even as we search for commonalities. Although this understanding of perme- ability is not a panacea to interreligious conflict, it seems the best way forward at this time. I understand my good friend John Cobb to be saying three things, all of which elicit my agreement. First, John remarks profoundly that, in each of our traditions, there are things we grope to express that may be more clearly expressed in other traditions. Learning the language of the other helps us articulate more clearly our own tradition. I would like to illustrate this with an example of which John will not ap- prove. In the early moments of Jewish, Christian, and Islamic tradition, the primary language was largely anthropopathic-that is, the language of Buddhist-Christian Studies 16 (1996). ? by University of Hawai'i Press.

For instance, Scripture speaks of God loving us, of God speaking, of God judging us, etc. However, all three traditions went through a philosophic phase in which the language of Scripture and liturgy was replaced by ontological-philosophic language. Father John Courtney Murray's The Problem of God displays this process very clearly.1 Now, unlike John, I am one of those who has called for the restoration of anthropopathic language on the grounds that it is scriptural, liturgical, and more commonsensical. This position is not common, and I frequently have trouble explaining it to Jews as well as Christians. My task has been made easier by allusion to the doctrine of the incarnation in Christian teaching, for, after all, is not the essence of the incarnation the teaching of the anthropopathicization-maybe even the anthropomorph- ization-of God? In a tradition where God has become human, anthropo- pathic language is, or should be, self-understood. With Jews I begin this process by posing the questions, What advantage do we gain theologically with the doctrine of incarnation? Put differently, what, from the Jewish point of view, would God have learned had God actually become human? Similarly, Judaism has a concept called halakha, which, roughly trans- lated, means "a system of ruled behaviors and a system of rules for adjudi- cating conflicts among ruled behaviors." Thus, halakha guides Jews not only in liturgical matters but also in social, personal, civil, and criminal matters. Because of a negative teaching about "law" and its replacement by grace, Christians, on the other hand, have a tendency to believe that they have no halakha, that is, that they have no ruled behaviors. On sober re- flection, this cannot be true because all social organizations have ruled behaviors, many of which are strictly enforced by the group. A student of mine realized this and went to study "Christian halakha" in a local Baptist church. He came back with the following observation. In a Baptist church, when the preacher speaks, no one is on the pulpit with him; only the Scripture shares the pulpit. Now, what is to be done with the host minister when a visiting minister preaches? That is, what is the ruled behavior? If the host remains on the pulpit, the symbolism of the Scripture-preacher line is compromised (not to speak of the distraction it might cause). If the preacher leaves the pulpit and sits with his family, he loses his status as preacher, in a certain sense. The same thing happens if he sits with the choir. My student reported that the debate waged back and forth for some time-sounding to me much like a page of Talmud-until the solution was reached: the host preacher had to leave the pulpit, but he had to sit in a pew by himself until he could mount the pulpit again. My student noted that, throughout the debate, there was no appeal to the New Testament. In any case, here is a clear case of a Jewish term that could en- lighten Christian praxis and perhaps restore an anthropologically and reli- giously more accurate understanding of Christianity, not to speak of restor- ing to Christianity one of its Jewish roots. 46</page><page sequence="3">RESPONSE TO COBB I agree, then, with John that studying the other helps us, especially when the moments under discussion refer to our attempt to articulate the ineffa- ble, although I do not limit this type of study to those moments. I think we can call this displaying the "permeability" of religious traditions, and it is certainly an intellectually and spiritually worthy task. Second, I understand John Cobb to be saying that there is an ethical implication to this effort to disclose the permeability of religious traditions, for, when we know the other, we understand the other better, we engage the other, and we are less likely to persecute or oppress the other. Under- standing leads to action. I am working now on a book that deals with the nature of obedience- conformity, on the one hand, and resistance-altruism, on the other. The subject is very complex, not the least because religious and academic insti- tutions have a tendency to encourage obedience-conformity and to sup- press resistance-altruism. Further, in a world that is increasingly interactive yet less human, any insight into the forces that humanize and hence ethi- cize our world is important. Now, research shows that "salience" to the vic- tim increases the likelihood of altruistic-resisting behavior. The famous Mil- gram experiments indicate clearly that, the closer the contact between teacher-subject and learner-object, the greater the resistance to obedience. Similarly, studies of rescuers during the Holocaust show that previous meaningful human contact with one's family and with Jews was more likely to evoke altruistic-rescuing behavior. Displaying the permeability of religious traditions, therefore, should increase our understanding of the other, our empathy for the other, our engagement with one another, and also our willingness to act on behalf of the other. Indeed, much of the field of conflict resolution revolves around this dynamic. I can only recount that teaching a course on Hinduism and Judaism, in- cluding a visit to a Hindu temple for a major holiday, has greatly increased my own understanding of, engagement with, and empathy for Hindu Ameri- cans. I know, with an inner knowledge, their ambivalences as a minority culture in America. And I have been able to help them prepare for acts of vandalism that may occur in our area. Similarly, contact with Arabs helped me empathize and offer my active help to Arab colleagues in Atlanta dur- ing the Gulf War when anti-Arab feeling was running high. Third, I understand John Cobb to be saying that, while permeability allows us to look for commonalities, it does not destroy or threaten individ- uality. As a Jew, I confess to being a little paranoid on this subject: Jews are afraid that calls to commonality and commensurability will deprive us of our individual and group identity. John is clear that that is not the intent of his doctrine of permeability, and my personal contact with him reassures me that that is so. But let me warn those of you who are members of the white Christian majority that Jews, African Americans, Hindu Americans, and others need to see in your deeds and your words that you are not col-</page><page sequence="4">RITA M. GROSS onizing us yet again, this time in elegant, interactional, academic form. It is our experience that a wolf in sheep's clothing is a wolf. My only reservation about John's vision of interfaith understanding is that not everyone is as reasonable as he is. Catholics and Protestants in Ire- land, Christians and Muslims in Bosnia, Hindus and Muslims in India, and Jews, Christians, and Muslims in the Middle East are not so irenic. It is com- mon to hear both Jews and Palestinians say, "But since their politics are religiously motivated, they will never be satisfied by ..." And there is some truth to that. I do not see a solution to these conflicts, but, then again, I do not see an alternative to John's permeability of traditions as a step toward understanding and, eventually, toward mutually respectful living. NOTE 1. John Courtney Murray, The Problem of God: Yesterday and Today (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1964). Incommensurability: Between Traditions or between Psychological Styles? RITA M. GROSS University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire ABSTRACT Religious incommensurability may be more of a problem within religious traditions than across religious traditions. The most intractable problem may be between the religiously tolerant and the religiously intolerant. The central problem of overcoming incommen- surability may lie in getting people to value diversity and pluralism. Since I find nothing in John Cobb's eminently sensible comments on in- commensurability that I wish to dispute, my brief commentary will take the form of asking additional questions that may take us further into a discus- sion of the limits of incommensurability. I particularly appreciate John Cobb's suggestion that "the language of incommensurability is associated with the view of static linguistic systems rather than dynamic traditions." And I find even more important his recommendation that the academy not unwittingly lend its support to conservative elements in religions that would seek to undo the academy, especially the academy of religion, if they had the power to do so.
