<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME LVI, No. 2 JANUARY 15, 1959 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY A HUMANIST SYMPOSIUM ON METAPHYSICS EDITED BY CORLISS LAMONT I N ATURAJISTIC Humanism, like any other complete phi- iiN losophy of life, stands in need of a sound metaphysics that meets the test of rigorous reasoning and is fully consistent with the findings of empirical science. Humanism, however, has in my judgment so far been noticeably inadequate in metaphysical analysis. This Symposium has been organized with the hope that a strong metaphysical foundation for Humanism may emerge. In order that those participating might start with a definite basis for criticism, it was suggested that they analyze and comment on the metaphysical categories which I outlined in The Philosophy of Humanism (1957) under the heading, "The Ultimates of Ex- istence. " In that synopsis I adopted the position of Aristotle that the proper task of metaphysics is to investigate being quta being; to identify those relatively few basic characteristics that apply to all the phenomena of existence, to existence as existence. These universal categories apply only to existential subject matters, but not to abstractions from existence such as mathematics and logic. I submitted the following twelve categories (here further con- densed) as a tentative metaphysical prospectus for naturalistic Humanism: 1. Stbstance (AMatter-Energy). This is a convenient and meaningful over-all term for the infinitely varied manifestations and modes of matter and energy throughout the entire universe. It is to Substance that all the other metaphysical distinctions per- tain. 2. Activity (Motion, Process, Event). Substance is always in movement, in flux, no matter how stable or inert it may appear. Everything is dynamically active, from sub-atomic particles to suns and galaxies. 45</page><page sequence="2">46 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHIY 3. Dimension (Measurement). All varieties of Substance are particles or combinations of particles and possess Dimension-how- ever infinitesimal-in terms of mass, duration, or other quantita- tive measurements. 4. Quality (Attribute). Every existent has a certain combina- tion of qualities, whether primary such as solidity, or secondary such as color. 5. Form (Pattern, Structure). Every manifestation of Sub- stance possesses a specific form or pattern definable as a stone, a tree, a man, or something else. Form never exists apart from matter and energy, or in any Platonic or other supernatural realm. 6. Potentiality (Power). Every existing object or form of life has certain inherent possibilities or powers of activity, interaction, change, and development. 7. Causality (Causation). Everything that exists is subject to causation and functions as both cause and effect. 8. Necessity (Law, Regularity). Scientifically established cause-effect laws or functional relationships are if-then regularities in Nature. Natural laws are deterministic only in the sense that the then surely occurs if the necessary and sufficient conditions are present. This conditional necessity opens the way for Con- tingency, accident, and human freedom. 9. Contingency (Chance). This category points to something real and objective in the universe: the pervasive and frequent meetings of independent causal sequences with no common cause behind them. The existence of Contingency and Individuality indicates that the universe is pluralistic and has no great over- arching monistic unity. 10. Individuality (Particularity). Every existent, be it ani- mate or inanimate, is a distinct individual, set off in its discrete- ness and particularity from all other entities and possessing an irreducible character of its own. Every entity not only occupies a unique position in space and time, but also thereby has unique re- lations with the rest of existence. 11. Relation (Connectedness, Relatedness). Every event or entity in the cosmos is related in some manner, through such ways as interaction, continuity, or synthesis, to some other thing or things. Nothing exists in absolute isolation. 12. Eventuation (Outcome, Culmination, Natural Teleology). This category denotes the continuous process of events in terms of successive outcomes and culminations. Human beings, adapting means to ends, utilize eventuations for the fulfilment of desires, purposes, and ideals.</page><page sequence="3">A HUMANIST SYMPOSIUM ON METAPHYSICS 47 This brief summary of Humanist metaphysical categories is just as significant, of course, for its exclusions as for its inclusions. In my opinion Humanism must reject the following eighteen cate- gories as ultimates of existence: (1) Mind (Reason, Consciousness), (2) Idea, (3) Truth, (4) Spirit (Soul), (5) Personality, (6) Will, (7) Purpose (Design, Providence), (8) Love, (9) Good (Value, Morality), (10) Evil, (11) God, (12) Devil (Satan), (13) Beauty, (14) Freedom, (15) Life, (16) First Cause, and (17) Space and (18) Time as Absolutes. The Humanist metaphysics, repudiating all supernaturalism and anthropomorphism, eliminates as cosmic ultimates attributes such as mind and purpose which, though of immense importance in human life, belong only to man or other highly developed organic forms. Thus naturalistic Humanism challenges men to rely on their own intelligence, courage, and effort in building their happiness and fashioning their destiny in this world of infinite possibilities. CoRLIss LAMONT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY II Let me say, first of all, that I find the general intent of Corliss Lamont 's discussion of metaphysical categories refreshing and stimulating. His rejection of monisms, idealistic and materialistic, and his preference for a pluralistic universe, please me down to the ground. This is, of course, a personal reaction, which is what he asked for. But the fact that the approval is personal does not make it merely or necessarily subjective, let alone casual. I believe that it accords, or at least aims to accord, with the realities that need to be taken into account, and that it is validated by the kind of responsible study and objectively tested thinking upon which reliable knowledge is dependent. Nevertheless, although leaning decidedly in the direction of Mr. Lamont 's outlook, I cannot go all the way with him in the present case. I throw my hat into the air for his liberating philosophic purpose, but the doctrinal substance of his philosophy impels me to pull my hat down over my ears. Indeed my reserva- tions, if sufficiently developed, might negate any significant agree- ment. Since space is limited, my remarks have to be restricted to a few brief comments on some aspects of the position under consideration.</page><page sequence="4">48 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOP'HY My disagreement with Mr. Lamont begins with his initial proposal, his very attempt to draw up ultimate irreducible cate- gories of the universe. This strikes me, adapting an Emersonian idea, like trying to swim up Niagara Falls. It is impossible to confine even human nature in definitive categories; how much more so the nature of Nature! No-not in twelve categories, nor in any number! I believe the best answer to any such endeavor is Hans Vaihinger's Philosophy of As If. Not that anything we say makes any difference to the universe. The universe can take it all in its whirl. But naturalistic Human- ism happens to be a philosophy of life, and a philosophy of life is vulnerable when its aims are misconstrued and the cause it is designed to serve suffers the unhappy consequences. Mr. Lamont charges naturalistic Humanists with weakness in metaphysical analysis, and with lacking an explicit theory of ultimate reality-alleged deficiencies which he apparently looks upon as something of an intellectual disgrace. He believes that this should be remedied by selecting ultimate traits of the universe to constitute the foundation stones of a Humanist metaphysics. Of course he may be right, but I cannot think so. I cannot think so for the reason that naturalistic Humanists are not pri- marily concerned to arrive at a concept of ultimate reality but at a realistic-idealistic program of individual and community living. Obviously the human undertaking is in great peril, in deadly peril. Bertrand Russell has stated the situation with his usual forthright- ness. "In comparison with this peril," he has said, "all other questions are insignificant. What will it matter who was right and who was wrong when no human beings have survived?" He has urged us to " rise and demand, in tones so loud that they cannot be ignored, that common sense, humanity, and the dictates of that moral law which [we believe that we respect] should guide our troubled era into that happiness which only its own folly is preventing." The deep trouble we are in is not the outgrowth of mankind's quarrel with the universe, but the relentless quarreling, of men with men in ruthless pursuit of antagonistic ambitions on the earthly plateau. A naturalistic Humanist may concentrate his effort upon relieving this madness by dealing constructively with its basic causes, and with this as his purpose seek fulness of attain- able knowledge-without metaphysical directive. Very likely I fall short of understanding Mr. Lamont's doc- trine of universal categories. There is his description of them as</page><page sequence="5">A HUMANIST' SYMPOSIUM ON METAPHYSICS 49 unanalyzable finalities representing a "sober enumeration of meta- physical traits which are in all probability eternal." These char- acters of the universe simply are. " To demand a reason for them," he says, "is like asking for the cause of causality." Well, why not ask for the cause of causality? Is not this what David Hume was really up to? And John Stuart Mill? In fact, have not the what and wherefore of causation been a long-time philo- sophic subject? Why may one not question that it has to be absolutistic instead of relativistic? And that lead-off category of the approved twelve, what ex- actly does it mean? It is defined as "a convenient over-all term for the infinitely varied manifestations and modes of matter and energy throughout the universe"; yet also in these words: "It is to Substance that all other metaphysical distinctions pertain." In the first meaning, Substance would seem to be merely a col- lective name for an infinity of particular things; in the second meaning, Substance is an infinite all-constituting Thing in Itself. Then there is the category of Individuality. I respond en- thusiastically to the statement: "Every stone, tree and man is a distinct individual, set off in its discreteness and particularity from all other things both within and outside of its own species." Yes, Mr. Lamont; every stone, tree, animal, man-literally every- thing in the heavens above and the earth beneath, and every event and moment of experience. But I cannot help wondering whether, true as this may be in the perspective of naturalistic Humanism, it has to be untrue, indeed meaningless, under the aspect of a uni- versal ultimacy. The most tantalizing category of the Lamont metaphysical prospectus is Contingency or Chance, as referring to "something real and objective in the universe: the pervasive and continual meetings or intersections of independent causal sequences in both non-human Nature and human affairs." I admire his achievement in expressing the difficult idea he wanted to express, but the idea itself will not stand examination. For if the independent se- quences are conceded to be causal, is it consistent to regard the intercrossing of the sequences as accidental? But the special point just now is that Mr. Lamont takes his stand for human freedom as an actuality, not merely as a trick of speech. On that issue I vote on his side, though I would desire to emphasize freedom for in place of freedom from. In my judg- ment the best connotation of freedom is skill. Robert Frost said in a talk to college students: "The freedom I'd like to give is the</page><page sequence="6">50 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY freedom I'd like to have. That is much harder than anything in the world to get-it's the freedom of my material." And his material in the broad sense-his material, your material, my ma- terial-is life, day-to-day life in the context of disciplining ex- perience. So I sum up by quoting a profound and noble passage from Thomas Hardy's Apology: And looking down the future these few hold fast to the same: that whether the human and kindred animal races survive till the exhaustion or de- struction of the globe, or whether these races perish and are succeeded by others before that conclusion comes, pain to all upon it, tongued or dumb, shall be kept down to a minimum by loving-kindness, operating through scientific knowledge, and actuated by the modicum of free will conjecturally possessed by organic life when the mighty necessitating forces-unconscious or other-that have " the balancing of the clouds," happen to be in equi- librium, which may or may not be often. MAX OTTO UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN III I am afraid I cannot write a special piece about "Cate- gories" (I am overwhelmed with writing), but I send some com- ments. (1) Substance, as you say, only applies to material existence. Don't you want (a) a category of existence as such and (b) of a more embracing basis for existence which would include mental as well as material possibilities? The only term I know for this is William James's "World Stuff." (5) I think you ought to use the term Organization rather than Form. (6) I don't like the term Power; is not Capacity better? (10) Individuality appears to me quite different from particu- larity. The universe may be pluralistic but also a unit in the sense of showing a single pattern. (12) I would prefer the term Process to Eventuation (and would much prefer to omit "natural teleology"). In any case, Eventuation involves time, which I think must be one of your categories even if you do not erect it into an absolute. I don't think you ought to leave out "mind" altogether, though perhaps the more general term awareness is a better one. There is a potentiality of awareness in the whole evolutionary process.</page><page sequence="7">A HUMANIST SYMPOSIUM ON METAPHYSICS 51 In general I don't see why categories should be "irreducible ultimates." All that they can do is to provide a framework for one's thinking. (In this I have the support of Professor A. J. Ayer.) If this is so, then you do have to have categories such as Duty, Freedom, and Will, though these only apply in the later stages of evolution. The existence of evolutionary processes (and evolutionary Humanism) makes it necessary to think in rather different terms from the usual static concepts. JULIAN HUXLEY LONDON IV It is heartening to have Mr. Lamont get down to fundamentals in his exposition of Humanism. Metaphysics is a term in philosophy which has had its ups and its downs. In the seventeenth century it was associated with a deductive approach to being, or what is, dominated by the notion of substance and guided by mathematical modes of thought. Descartes had three substances, God, the primary substance, and matter and mind as secondary ones. And he thought he could prove the existence of all three by a kind of intuitive reason. Spinoza and Leibnitz followed this pattern in diverging ways. Then came the challenge of empiricism. It became clear that positive knowledge of the factual kind needed observational evi- dence and verification. And it was gradually realized that mathe- matical and logical knowledge was formal and analytic. The con- clusion drawn was that one could not reason one 's way to what is in an a priori fashion. Unfortunately, empiricism got itself into the quagmires of subjectivism and phenomenalism largely because it was unable to do justice to the reach and claims of perceiving. It was so dominated by the purely causal approach that it reduced perception to an awareness of sensations as private and personal events. How, then, could one get to the external world, to ma- terial things ? Logical positivism was a clamant expression of this situation into which empiricism had gotten itself. Very naturally, it took it out on "metaphysics" as meaningless. It was partly induced to do so because German, romantic philosophy was so much an affair of emotion and edification. The worst forms of existential- ism illustrate this type of philosophy. It does not build carefully from a foundation.</page><page sequence="8">52 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY It is not as well known as it should be that logical positivism was not a stable position and helped to destroy itself, aided by its critics. Material things were no longer reduced to sensations. But that meant that metaphysics, that is, concern with what is, had come back. As I see it, there is really nothing very mysterious about metaphysics. Perhaps ontology, discourse about what is, is a less misleading word. Some Humanists know that I have long been a materialist of the levels, or emergent, type which seeks to do justice to the abilities of man. This is quite different from dialectical ma- terialism, founded on a left-wing form of Hegelianism, for it is in closer contact with the sciences, inorganic, biological, and social. With this preface, let me turn to the admirable exposition of Mr. Lamont. In accordance with certain traditions at Columbia, he clings a little closer to Aristotelian phraseology than I do. But as far as I can see, the result is much the same. For instance, I also would accept the category of Substance but would stress organization, capacities, and dispositional properties as essential to a thing's nature. What is is, surely, active, dynamic; and it has measurable dimensions. Like Mr. Lamont, I have no substitute for scientific knowledge. And, like him, I take the categories to be cases of discovered knowledge about the constitution of what is. I am glad to see that he takes Causality to be an objective category and thus breaks with Hume. But this does not mean a return to Hume's predecessors. Causality is a temporal affair. And I quite agree that functional laws, which play such a role in science, do not conflict with objective causality. I quite agree, again, that empirical necessity is conditional. It is not the same as logical entailment. Here is where contingency gets its basis. I have been a strong believer in levels of causality. I take human decision to be a guided operation in which judgment plays a role. In this sense, it is open or free. As far as I can see, this is a very high level of causality. Most Humanists, I imagine, would agree with the general out- line of Mr. Lamont's treatment of the status of value and morality in the world. I think we can all admire this masterpiece of condensed expo- sition. Naturally, technical philosophers would want delaying actions on this point or that. But I am in sympathy with the perspective and believe that, in the long run, it will prevail. UNIVERSITY 0F MICHIGAN Roy WooD SELLARS</page><page sequence="9">A HUMANIST SYMPOSIUM ON METAPHYSICS 53 v I would like to revise Dr. Lamont 's categories of Quality, Causality, Necessity, and Contingency. The others are sound and admirable principles of a humanistic philosophy. Quality: He defends the objectivity of sensations. But psy- chology seems to me to indicate that an experienced red color- quality is a subjective sensation in the mind, directly dependent upon the substantial protoplasm of the visual area of the brain. It is caused indirectly by objective external physical vibrations or quanta which are not at all similar to it. If they are called "red" the word has a different meaning. Causation, Necessity, Contingency: Dr. Lamont says that every existing thing is subject to causation, but he indicates that such universal subjection is stultifying and derogatory to human dig- nity. So we seem to have an emotional need to show that some things are not causally predetermined. It is hard to see how showing this does not contradict the notion that all things are subject to causation. I should think that it would be easier to change one 's emotional attitude. But Dr. Lamont insists upon man's ability to exert a spontaneous effort or will, not predeter- mined by the past.* Also, he asserts that the meeting of two independent causal series is frequently pure objective chance or contingency and is not necessarily "co-caused" (he probably means that sometimes it is not jointly caused) by the two series. Because of the existence of objective chance, he denies the truth of universal causal determinism. So I am puzzled about his as- sertion that every existing thing is subject to causation. There are causal laws, we are told, but they are only con- ditional; they are expressed by the words "if-then." If, in the biological reproduction, certain genes operate as causes jointly with some environmental forces, then a rational organism results. But the laws governing this maturation do not prescribe that there shall be any genes to initiate the causal process. So the necessity is conditioned upon the existence of the genes. Being thus con- ditional, it is supposedly not so utterly inexorable or stultifying. Conceivably there might not have been any genes, in which case no rational somatoplasm would have inevitably matured. But I do not see how this mitigates either the rigor or the uni- versality of causal determinism. The ultimate substance of na- * Professor Williams extends his discussion to the section, "Contingency, Law and Freedom, " in Mr. Lamont 's The Philosophy of Humnanism.</page><page sequence="10">54 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ture provides both the laws and the specific forces (genes) which, operating in accordance with the laws, initiate the causal sequence. When the if-then relationship holds between an actual set of genes and a resulting rational organism, there is no mitigation of the deterministic rigor with which the organism is produced. Dr. Lamont 's "conditional" necessity turns out to be really an in- exorable necessity. He speaks of a result as a passive thing. But the ultimate substance in everything, including man, is intrinsically dynamic. A man's rational energies do not become passive by being caused. They are all necessarily caused; they are rigorously predetermined, in the sense that they are made to be what they are (they are active forces) by prior active causal forces which have passed energy on into them. Dr. Lamont says that the conditional necessity of causal law leaves room for contingency (chance), accident, and human free- dom, and that contingency accounts for novelty. I would say that the utterly rigorous necessity, which he calls conditional, not only leaves room for these things but actually creates all of them. Dr. Lamont insists that contingency or chance is not merely human ignorance. It is the objective situation of one causal if-then series meeting another one which has been operating independently of it. Otherwise stated, it is the case of one such series into which another intrudes and prevents the occurrence of the result (the then) of the first. The then which does not occur is thus seen not to have been inevitable; indeed, I would say, it is seen to have been impossible. The Titanic was moving west from Southampton, England, to deliver its passengers in New York. But an iceberg coming down from Greenland intruded, and, by objective chance, about 1500 of the passengers were delivered into the depths of the Atlantic instead. The then (their drowning), which does occur, is, says Dr. Lamont, not due to the co-causation of the two series as they operated up to the point of contact. But it seems very obvious to me that the meeting was jointly caused by the natural forces in the two series. It was 100 per cent predetermined. It was an accident only because nobody foresaw or intended it. The 1500 passengers' beliefs that they would reach New York were false from the start. All of Dr. Lamont's illustrations of chance are caused and unplanned events. Moreover he recognizes, in the case of finding the purse, that if it was planned or planted it was not discovered by chance. I think that what accounts for novelty is "one energy struc- ture producing another." The new one often has new qualities.</page><page sequence="11">A HUMANIST SYMPOSIUM ON METAPHYSICS 55 Dr. Lamont calls indirect causation conditioning. The past, he says, is dead and does not cause anything. It conditions the present and future. But I say that it was dynamic when it was a present, and that it caused indirectly all of our present activities. He interprets the cause-effect relation as analogous to that of master and slave. But he regards the condition-conditioned re- lation as possible between equals. I see no warrant for drawing this distinction. Results of indirect evolutionary causation can even be superior to their causes in freedom and creativity. And, finally, it seems to me that Dr. Lamont is mistaken in saying that scientific if-then sequences are not found in human choices. Choices are psychological phenomena and Psychology is a cause-and-effect science. If a man, X, has two alternatives, A and B, such that he has the caused power to do whichever one he is caused to prefer, and if he is caused to prefer A over B, then, by inexorable push-of-energy causation, and by the inexorable logic (of correct definition) that Preference plus Power make Freedom, he chooses A and he does it successfully. Thus he is free to choose it and to do it. No obstacle prevents. Moreover, if he is caused to wish to prefer A over B, then he is caused to be free to prefer it. His preference, choice, and overt voluntary action are all free when they have the results at which they aim. Whether or not they are caused is irrelevant to their freedom. In fact all are 100 per cent causally predetermined. Whether or not they are free depends upon their results. GARDNER WILLIAMS UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO VI. EPILOGUE Mir. Sellars rightly calls Mr. Lamont's statement of "The Ulti- mates of Existence " a "masterpiece of condensed exposition." That on certain points it is too condensed is attested by the failure of some of the commentators to understand his position fully. Mr. Sellars also points out that "in accordance with certain tra- ditions at Columbia, he clings a little closer to Aristotelian phrase- ology " than the other contributors. Since like Mr. Lamont I learned my Aristotle, and my metaphysics, from F. J. E. Wood- bridge, I find this no stumbling-block. But it naturally troubles Sir Julian Huxley, though for the others, as Mr. Sellars puts it, "the result is much the same." Sir Julian 's terms are for the most part useful synonyms. And I sympathize strongly with his comment, "The existence of evolutionary process (and evolution-</page><page sequence="12">56 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ary Humanism) makes it necessary to think in rather different terms from the usual static concepts," and also with his emphasis on time. After all, I was brought up-to-date in metaphysics by Dewey, Whitehead, and other emergent evolutionists like Mr. Sellars. For in this century metaphysics has been making rapid progress. Only the stalwart Mr. Otto here challenges Mr. Lamont 's whole enterprise. "Naturalistic Humanists are not primarily con- cerned to arrive at a concept of ultimate reality but at a realistic- idealistic program of individual and community living." He quotes Russell, who in his day has spent quite a little time on metaphysics, and on who was right and who wrong: "We are in deadly peril. In comparison, all other questions are insig- nificant." But even if we ought today really to drop every pursuit and interest save the prevention of war, metaphysics can still enter its claim. "A naturalistic Humanist may concentrate his effort upon relieving this madness by dealing constructively with its basic causes-without metaphysical directive," judges Mr. Otto. But another equally impassioned and concerned thinker, Karl Popper, finds a "basic cause" of our madness to lie in a false metaphysics: in the "historicism" based on a monistic universal determinism, which holds socialism to be the one correct and in- evitable economic system-or free enterprise. Even apart from the current lunacy, Mr. Otto has doubts about "the very attempt to draw up ultimate irreducible categories of the universe." He says: "It is impossible to confine even human nature in definitive categories; how much more so the nature of Nature!" To the claim for ultimate givenness, he asks, "Why not ask for the cause of causality? Is not this what David Hume was really up to? And John Stuart Mill?" One had thought that Hume asked not for the "cause" of causality, but for the cause of the idea of causality, perversely assuming that the cause of that idea would be evidence for its validity; and this confusion of logic with psychology on Hume's part was responsible for his notable lack of success in clarifying the meaning of causality-or, if we are up-to-date, the way in which we actually use the term. And Mill was troubled, not about the cause but about the validity of causal relations. But it is hard to see that either Hume or Mill ever asked, why is it that we find constant or frequent conjunc- tion?-that is, what is the cause of there being causal relations? or that there could be any answer to such a question, short of the unilluminating one, "It is the will of God." This is Mr. Lamont's point about the ultimacy and irreducibility of his meta-</page><page sequence="13">A HUMANIST SYMPOSIUM ON METAPHYSICS 57 physical traits of existence. Mr. Sellars seems more perceptive in saying, "I am glad to see Mr. Lamont takes causality to be an objective category, and thus breaks with Hume." Julian Huxley also appears to be a nominalist: "I don't see why categories should be 'irreducible ultimates.' All that they can do is to provide a framework for one's thinking. (In this I have the support of Professor A. J. Ayer)." In truth, Mr. Lamont's conception of "the irreducible traits of existence as such" is rather too condensed. His following the tradition of calling them "cate- gories" is bound to confuse and mislead the nominalists, who will take them for mere predicates, mere ways of saying, a purely linguistic framework of thinking, as it seems to have misled Huxley and Otto. "Metaphysics," Mr. Lamont holds, "seeks to identify those relatively few basic characteristics which are to be found throughout every field of factual knowledge, every existential subject matter; it specifies those features of existence which are omnipresent." He does not imply that he has drawn up "a final or complete metaphysical prospectus." That is indeed impossible. For a pervasive trait only becomes metaphysically significant in the light of the problems presented by some theory or scheme of understanding that has neglected it. Hence with every thorough- going intellectual criticism of older organizations of knowledge, new pervasive traits are becoming the focus of attention. Mr. Otto is therefore quite right in denying that it is possible to "confine" the nature of Nature in "definitive" categories. Any group of metaphysical traits or "categories," like Mr. Lamont's, is thus a function of the state of culture and knowledge at the time. It might be added that certain of these traits or categories are polar in character, implying each other as complementary counterparts. These polar traits serve as the foundation of ulti- mate and irreducible metaphysical distinctions. Four sets out of Mr. Lamont's twelve seem to be thus polar: Activity or Process (2), and Form or Structure (5), Huxley's "organization"; or his Potentiality (6), and Eventuation or Outcome (12), the fac- tors involved in Natural Teleology, which Huxley does not like; or his Necessity or Regularity (8), and Contingency or Chance (9); or his Individuality or Particularity (10), and Re- lation (11). Others of Mr. Lamont 's twelve do not imply a complementary trait: Dimension or Quantity (3), Quality (4), and Causality (7). Causality, incidentally, seems clearly to be one kind of Relation, worth singling out because of its importance in our science and practice. And in turn Necessity and Con- tingency seem to be two polar traits within the Relation of</page><page sequence="14">58 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Causality, two different kinds of causation, regular and chance (this throws light on the difficulties of Mr. Otto and Mr. Williams with objective Chance). Moreover, many non-polar or independent traits, though their occurrence is wider than the field of any single science, do not possess complete generality and find exemplification everywhere. Perhaps here might be placed Julian Huxley's categories that apply "only in the later stages of evolution," like Mind (which he perversely identifies with "awareness"), though they are po- tential in the whole evolutionary process; and perhaps even his Duty, Freedom, and Will. Having gone this far, we might admit certain of the categories Mr. Lamont rejects because they are not "basic traits in the universe as a whole," but are found in the universe only with man already in it, such as Truth, Good and Evil, and Beauty. And we might on this basis admit even the Divine, as a trait of that human world. Here Huxley's emphasis on the evolutionary process seems sounder, and more in accord with the temporal concepts of present-day metaphysical analysis, than Mr. Lamont 's more static and "eternal " traits. Mr. Lamont seems in fact to fail to make any distinction between those traditional categories he rejects because there is no evidence for them, like Providence and First Cause, and those he rejects because they are found only in a universe containing human life, though they are there abundantly insistent. In general it seems that Mr. Lamont's twelve categories could be clarified and illuminated by making the distinctions just sug- gested, above all by grouping the sets of polar traits together; and by introducing something of Julian Huxley's temporalism. The grouping, for example, would answer the questions of Otto and Huxley about the connection between Individuality and Re- lation: they are clearly polar traits. There seems no evidence, however, that, as Huxley suggests, the universe actually is a unit in the sense of exhibiting a single pattern. On certain of his categories, Mr. Lamont's lack of clarity has caused his commentators confusion. He is using "Substance" as the name for the totality of encountered subject-matter. Yet he unduly limits its scope by calling it "the whole of material existence," and thus leads Huxley to suggest: "Don't you want a more embracing basis for existence which would include mental as well as material possibilities?" Doubtless Mr. Lamont intends to cover these by "the infinitely varied manifestations and modes of matter and energy." But then, under Dimension, he goes on to add, "All varieties of Substance are either particles or a com-</page><page sequence="15">A HUMANIST SYMPOSIUM ON METAPHYSICS 59 bination of particles." This seems to be mere antiquated science, to say nothing of its metaphysical inadequacy. Huxley is clearly right in his objection. It would be better to say, Substance is Activity and Process, and to reserve Matter for one of the factors distinguishable in Substance, not to identify the whole of Sub- stance with Matter. Perhaps Mr. Lamont has been seduced by Santayana into adopting an old-fashioned notion of Substance. All metaphysical distinctions are made within Substance, taken as total subject-matter. But this of course gives no warrant for strangely inferring, as does Mr. Otto, that Substance means, "an infinite all-constituting Thing in Itself." Mr. Lamont hardly develops adequately his objective relativism as to Qualities. He is following Woodbridge-and Dewey-in taking secondary qualities as "objective" but relational, depend- ent on various structures, of sense-organs or other receptors like cameras. Grass has the quality of being green only when an undistorting light is present, and likewise only in the presence of some optical apparatus, like the eye or a photographic film. Mr. Williams 's Lockean objection does not seem illuminating. The quality red, on this view, is not a "sensation," it is something sensed. It is not "subjective," whatever that may mean, but is rather "relational." And it is not "in the mind," but in the rose sensed, when that rose is related to an eye and a brain in the way Mr. Williams rightly describes. Mr. Williams seems not to be familiar with objective relativism. It is a pity; familiarity would make his views much more sympathetic to Mr. Lamont 's. Mr. Lamont embraces the Aristotelian conceptions of natural necessity as hypothetical, as an affair of necessary conditions, of if-then regularities, as does Mr. Sellars; and also of objective chance as "'the intersections of independent causal sequences.," If Necessity and Chance were seen clearly to be a polar distinction within Causality, that is, as two kinds of causation, that exhibiting a regular and predictable pattern, and that exhibiting no pattern, the difficulty of Mr. Otto and the careful argument of Mr. Wil- liams would be clarified. Mr. Otto says: "The idea will not stand examination. For if the independent sequences are conceded to be causal, is it consistent to regard the intercrossing of the se- quences as accidental ?" It is, for that is precisely what we mean by "accident," "contingency," or "chance": an individual event which exemplifies no regular pattern. All events are caused, but some are caused "by chance." A car proceeds down a road at a hundred miles an hour, and collides with another. That is not chance, but an instance of a regular causal relation between</page><page sequence="16">60 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY speed and disaster. But if I am driving sedately and am struck by the speeding car, that is a case of chance. To be sure, if I had seen the other car in time, I could have avoided the collision. That is freedom, dependent on an if-then sequence, on a hypo- thetically necessary regular causal relation. Mr. Lamont, I judge, is clear on Chance, Contingency, and Accident. He confesses himself, with reason, dissatisfied with his statement of the relation of such Contingency to human freedom. Nor are the commentators in a much better case. Mr. Otto is for freedom as skill, but he does not elucidate it. Nor does Huxley. Mr. Sellars has a well-worked-out view of different emergent levels of causality, in which the freedom of human de- cision is "a very high level of causality" involving judgment; but he too does not here explain. Mr. Williams, as an old- fashioned determinist, is clearest of all. For him, Preference plus Power make Freedom. If a man is caused to prefer A, " by inexorable push-of-energy causation," and if he is also caused to have the power to do it, he is then caused to be free to choose and perform his act. "His preference, choice, and overt voluntary action are all free when they have the results at which they aim. Whether or not they are caused is irrelevant to their freedom. In fact, all are 100 per cent causally predetermined. Whether or not they are free depends upon their results." In other words, freedom is for Mr. Williams the power to do without obstacle what we are caused to want to do. This is one of the great his- toric and living conceptions of human freedom. But Mr. Williams seems to take all causation as "inexorable push-of-energy causation" exclusively, operating within a mono- lithic, monistic scheme of determining mechanical causes. The meeting of the Titanic with the iceberg was 100 per cent pre- determined, an "accident" only because nobody foresaw or in- tended it. "The 1500 passengers' beliefs that they would reach New York were false from the start" (emphasis mine), false indeed from what the first creation wrote. On this view it is a little hard to understand what Mr. Williams means in saying, "What ac- counts for novelty is 'one energy structure producing another.' The new one often has new qualities." Surely the "new" quali- ties must be then all predetermined "from the start." Or: "Re- sults of indirect evolutionary causation can even be superior to their causes in freedom and creativity." What can "creativity" mean here? On a pluralistic view of causation, "universal causal determin- ism" does not mean a single monolithic "inexorable" system fore- ordained "from the start." It means rather that every event is</page><page sequence="17">A HUMANIST SYMPOSIUM ON METAPHYSICS 61 determined by specific causes. Since causal necessity is hypo- thetical, not simple, like logical necessity, those particular causes are necessary if that event is to occur. But there is no " in- exorable necessity " that it should occur. Other factors may impinge upon it, and prevent or modify it; and there is no neces- sary law or regularity of their impingement. The impingements are Chance or Contingent causes. And not all causes are ex- clusively " push-of-energy " events, though all may well involve the expenditure of energy. In human life, many causes are foreseeings of the future consequences, natural structures under- stood-what Mr. Sellars calls "judgments. " Such foreseeings can enter in to impinge upon and modify other causal series; for causation being thus pluralistic, it is always possible in any par- ticular case to add new determinations. The paths of the Titanic and the iceberg may have been "predetermined" to meet. But if the captain and crew had been more alert, there need have been no collision. Woodbridge used to tell of a locomotive engineer who remarked to him: "In my time I have foreseen and avoided many inevitable accidents. " However it may stand with God, whose foreordination seems to be lurking in Mr. Williams's back- ground-his brand of universal monistic determinism can be easily shown to be a theological rather than a scientific or a human assumption-that is the way causal determinism is encountered in human experience. It may of course be argued that whether and how far we shall know in any particular case is antecedently "predetermined from the start," by "inexorable push-of-energy causation." But then all bets are off: our very assumption of universal causation becomes the result of glands or repressions, not of evidence at all. Every metaphysical principle, like the principles of all the sciences, pre- supposes the freedom to know, as does all intelligent living. Mr. Lamont 's courageous attempt to set forth "the ultimates of existence" belongs to the elucidation of the metaphysical po- sition that has come to be known as "naturalistic." In my judg- ment, "Humanism" would be less confusing a term if it were restricted to meaning a scheme of values and a program of living. Naturalism does not entail an exclusive devotion to that scheme: consider Spinoza, or Santayana. And a humanistic program does not demand ultimate clarity on the issues of naturalistic meta- physics: surely, and fortunately, Russell and Otto are right. We should be in a very bad way indeed did we all have to become sound naturalistic metaphysicians before we could hope to re- nounce war and the policies that cause it.</page><page sequence="18">62 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY We can be thankful that Mr. Lamont is both a Humanist and a metaphysician. On both themes he has much of value to say. And his contention that the Humanist program can be clarified by the criticism afforded by a sound metaphysics is most per- suasive. The most influential "realistic-idealistic program of com- munity living" in our world today would be more "realistic," and less dangerous to the rest of us, if it heeded his metaphysical principle: "Humanism never loads the dice by reading the actualization of its ideals into the stars, the drift of history, or a Divine Mind that underwrites the future." In my blindness I have usually found Mr. Lamont 's naturalistic metaphysics wise and sound. His politics have often seemed to my prejudices more questionable, and I could only wish he would always exhibit the same tough-mindedness in them of which he rightly boasts in metaphysics. What his metaphysical categories demand is not more firm- heartedness, but more precision, more careful analysis-like the ideas of his critics. Yet it is just in the nuances, in their closer approximation to contemporary thought and knowledge, that the statement of these "eternal" traits of what is, assumes relevance to human problems, and lends itself to a progressive and cumu- lative criticism and clarification. Even in the rather vague and imprecise, because overcondensed, formulation here given, they can set our thinking off from past errors and onesidednesses, and serve to unite us in a program of further metaphysical analysis and inquiry. JOHN HERMAN RANDALL, JR. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY VII. A BRIEF REJOINDER Apart from semantic problems, the most controversial issue arising in this Symposium is whether Necessity or Determinism reigns supreme throughout the universe or whether there is room for objective Contingency or Chance. Professor Randall has ably answered the arguments of Professors Otto and Williams on this question; and has fortified my own position by showing that Contingency and Necessity imply each other as fundamental polar traits within the realm of Causality. I shall only add that the claim that Necessity is all-embracing seems to me another example of reductionism in philosophy. A Humanist metaphysics gains strength by recognizing that both Contingency and Necessity have their place in the nature of things and that neither can ever</page><page sequence="19">A HUMANIST SYMPOSIUM ON METAPHYSICS 63 swallow up the other. The existence of Contingency, moreover, provides a metaphysical opening for the continual emergence of novelty; and for human freedom of choice, conditioned but not determined by the past. I find very helpful Professor Randall's suggestion that certain of my categories be grouped together as polar traits. He will perhaps agree that at least one other pair should be added, namely, Unity or Oneness, meaning that every existent possesses some degree of unity; and Plurality or Manyness, meaning that every existent is a synthesis of various elements or enters into plural relationships. This analysis indicates an empirically grounded solution to the problem of the One and the Many, with both cate- gories applying to every existing entity (as Professor Randall himself pointed out in a recent lecture). As for Sir Julian Huxley's comments, time as duration I have included under Dimension; but duration may be so important that it qualifies in itself as a separate category. Time also has a place in the metaphysical categories in Aristotle's sense of all existents possessing temporal determination. I would combine temporal determination and spatial determination under the category of Location, meaning that every entity has a definite position in space and time, or space-time. Coming to Sir Julian's semantic criticisms, I suggest the word Possibility as a more apt synonym for Potentiality than Power; and Distinctiveness as a better synonym for Individuality than Par- ticularity. Without dropping the category Form, we might well substitute Organization as a synonym for Pattern; and this change would, I judge, also please Professor Sellars. Both Sir Julian and Professor Randall criticize my definition of Substance as an over-all term for matter and energy in their infinitely varied manifestations. They are of the opinion that Substance should be of even wider scope, "the totality of encoun- tered subject-matter," as Professor Randall puts it. However, in the introduction to my twelve categories I state that I am trying to identify the irreducible traits of existence as such; and thereby I designate existence (without making it one of the cate- gories) as the total subject-matter. To give the term Substance the same meaning would seem redundant to me. Professor Randall also wants to identify Substance with Activity or Process. But I am not sure that we should thus give Activity priority over matter, since Activity must always be the activity of something that objectively exists, whether defined in terms of matter, particles, or something else. However, to avoid</page><page sequence="20">64 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY a partly semantic controversy unnecessary for our metaphysical analysis, I am willing to say under Dimension (which might be better termed Quantity) simply that "All varieties of Substance possess Dimension . . ," thus omitting the description of Sub- stance as "particles or combinations of particles." This Metaphysics Symposium has, I think, greatly clarified the central ontological principles that must stand at the base of any adequate Humanist or naturalist philosophy. And it is my hope that the discussion will stimulate further analysis and debate in the great enterprise of metaphysics. CORLISs LAMONT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY</page></plain_text>
