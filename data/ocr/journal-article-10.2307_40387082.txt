Pp. 170. $30.00 This book is one of two studies to be published in 1995 concen- trating on the relations between art and archaeology in southeast Cape York Peninsula. The other is by Morwood and Hobbs (1995). Given the proximity of their publication dates, a detailed comparison and assessment of these two works would permit a synthesis not possible for either. The temptation in assessing this work is to make the comparison between the two. I will try to avoid that here. David and Chant's work was undertaken primarily as a postgraduate project leading to a PhD (for David) at the University of Queensland and Morwood's project was a major research project funded by the ARC and supported by the staff and students of the University of New England. The projects are, therefore, of different scale and maturity, and David and Chant's deserves to be treated separately. Rock art and régionalisation in north Queensland prehistory has four major sections: an introduction, which includes a discus- sion of some theoretical and methodological assumptions of the work; a description of the excavations undertaken; an account of the rock art of the region, including some newly described sites and a previously published multivariate analysis (attributed to Chant) that ventures perilously outside the region; a conclusion. The work concludes (as it began) with a statement that the archae- ological record documents major socio-cultural changes in the region and its relations further afield after 3500-2500 years ago. Archaeologists routinely describe variation through time and document variation across space in one or more variables of the materials encountered in excavation or survey. Sometimes they are in the fortunate position of being able to relate variations in time to variations in space. Explanation of these variations is more dif- ficult. Usually an explanation requires an argument about the vari- ation in time and space in some independent variable, which can be shown by archaeological evidence and/or theoretical argument (about archaeological formation processes) to be linked to the archaeological materials. Because of the nature of this requirement of explanation, environmental variables have frequently been invoked. More recently, there has been a fashion throughout the world to explain variation in terms of social changes within the human groups that left the archaeological remains. Such argu- ments have a problem in obtaining independent evidence for social variation as well as about establishing linkage between the forma- tion processes of the archaeological record and the social variables asserted as explanatory. David and Chant's work is in the social mode, and does not seek to provide detailed analysis of indepen- dent evidence for environmental change. Unfortunately it does not offer independent evidence for social variation either. Chosen for description here are materials from excavations: flaked and other stone materials; mussel shell; egg shell; ochre; burnt earth; charcoal; occasionally bone. This much is straightfor- ward. In addition several variables are presented for painted and engraved motifs at several sites in the region: identifications of iconic motif types; naming of non-iconic motif types; enumera- tion of colours and painting modes of motifs; counts of motifs produced by different engraving methods. Data on these variables are presented (inconveniently) in a microfiche loosely attached to the back of the book. It requires major effort for anyone to ques- tion the conclusions in this work by addressing the data, and library copies will quickly lose the microfiche, so that it will be impossible. I hope this practice will not be widely copied, as it is completely unacceptable for conclusions to be presented only on the basis of heavily processed results. The use of age-depth curves is crucial to the analysis (and typi- cal of the sort of problems created by difficulty of access to the pri- mary data). Radiocarbon dates were obtained and their depths plot- ted against time. A simple procedure of joining the dots (and making appropriate judgements about dates that did not fit neatly) made it possible to estimate the age boundaries of each excavation unit. Using this procedure dates could be calculated for all changes. Tables showing the dates for particular changes (in ochre deposi- tion and in appearance of burren adzes, for example) are provided in the microfiche. Along with many others, I have some experience of the use of age-depth curves (Bofinger &amp; Davidson 1977) and recognise the convenience they provide. However, more recent consideration suggests that very often the assumptions determine the outcome in very significant ways. "Joining the dots" is not a procedure without theoretical assumptions: it assumes that net sedi- ment deposition rates remained constant for the period between deposition of two charcoal fragments, and usually that gross sedi- ment deposition and erosion patterns are well approximated by the net rate. The reality is that we usually do not know whether either of these unstated assumptions is true, and we cannot eliminate peri- ods of no sediment deposition, nor episodes of sequential deposi- tion and erosion. Unless these options are taken in to account, it becomes extremely difficult to consider hypotheses that do not involve continuous occupation of sites (Davidson 1990). When we consider that it has been demonstrated that artefacts (and presum- ably other materials) move through the sediments deposited in sandstone shelters (Richardson 1992) the certainty that age-depth curves seem to provide seems at best optimistic. The only solution to this dilemma seems to be to obtain (very) large numbers of age estimates (where possible) which will document the patterning of distribution of ages represented in the site, as well as documenting aspects of the movement of materials through the sediments. The technical problem associated with age-depth curves is not unique to this volume: Morwood and Hobbs use the same tech- nique. Unfortunately most of the argument depends on documen- tation of the variations in frequency of particular archaeological materials determined using these age estimates. Moreover, in interpreting these materials it is crucial that the analysis takes into account the formation processes for those materials. David (par- ticularly) is well aware of taphonomic processes and this work discusses them briefly. In the treatment of the most resistant materials (stone artefacts) the work makes the most difficult com- 217</page><page sequence="2">promise. The analysis deliberately avoided any description beyond the counts of flaked stones. Yet, from the very beginning of the history of interpretation of changing frequencies of materi- als in sites, there has been criticism of counting stone artefacts without taking into account that different knapping techniques produce different quantities of material (Hiscock 1982). Without a suitable technological analysis, we can not trust the use of all flaked stone as a measure of ... well, anything, really. The section on rock art is a very useful synthesis of the literature in one of the great rock art centres of Australia, together with some new recording. Many of the sites are illustrated with photographs (including 20 in colour) and 14 tracings. Inventories of motifs and techniques are only included if the authors are satisfied that there is a complete inventory of motifs. Again, I suggest caution, since it is frequently difficult to determine where one motif begins and another ends, so that the motif counts are themselves laden with assumptions about, for example, what constitutes a motif. I was particularly disappointed that there was no discussion of this important point, as it seems that there is a major issue emerging about the identification of the limits of similarity that justify inclu- sion of motifs within a single category. This becomes extremely important when the quantities described are used in a multivariate statistical analysis across regions, which takes for granted that the motif given a particular name in one region is indeed an appropri- ate comparison for the motif given that name in another region. Moreover, naming can mask significant variation at another level. In NW Queensland (with which I am most familiar) and in Cape York Peninsula there are motifs generally regarded as anthropomorphs. My research leads me to question whether this categorisation is straightforward (see, for example Ross 1997), but that is not quite the issue. The point is that the anthropomorphs in the two regions are quite different in the symbolic conventions they bring to the process of depiction. Yet the simple categorisa- tion of these distinct motif types as "anthropomorphs" seems to suggest similarity that results primarily from the limitations of the analyst's naming conventions. Uncritical acceptance of motif cate- gories can lead to spurious comparison. And this is where I take major issue with the multivariate analysis of rock art at the end of the work. No statistical program that I know can tell the analyst that the wrong data have been entered or that the comparisons are meaningless. I am highly doubtful that the categories entered into the analysis for regions outside David and Chant's study area can be entered into this analysis without more detailed knowledge of the regions by a scholar who knows Lawn Hill and the Mt Isa regions as well as Cape York Peninsula. Even so, I am not sure that the assumptions about the creation of art assemblages are well enough controlled for us to be able to rely on quantification at all. What was the process of production? Were all of the images produced at one time? If so, there may be no problem. Or were paintings and engravings added at different times by different people? In which case, what causes the coherence of any set of numbers? Did peo- ple count how many hand stencils and how many tracks and calcu- late how many tracks needed to be added? It is my strong impres- sion (in general, not just about this study) that unless such questions can be answered in a reasonable way, strong statistical techniques can be a menace, and distract us from the real business of archaeology. In short, specialists will find some useful data in this work, but some serious problems attend many aspects of it.
