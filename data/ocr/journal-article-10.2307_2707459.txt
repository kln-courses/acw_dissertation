<plain_text><page sequence="1">CAUSATION AND ITS APPLICATION TO HISTORY BY MORRIS R. COHEN In the controversies as to the methodology of history the question of causation has occupied a central place. The defense of human autonomy or free will has led many to such a sharp separation between mind and nature as to deny any application of natural causation to human affairs. On the other hand, natural- ists have takeni it as axiomatic that historiography can become scientific, i.e., give us verifiable knowledge free from bias or super- stition, only if it submits to the methods of natural science which operate with causal laws. A generation ago the naturalists seemed to be carrying the day in the social sciences and thus in the theory of history. But recent idealists have used the extreme empiricism of anti-metaphysical positivists to argue that the laws of physics are purely statistical and thus not different in kind from the constant correlations that we find in public or national affairs. Quetelet's and Buckle's use of statistics to prove the reign of iron laws of causality in human affairs is thus reversed into a denial that such laws can be found in physics. This positivism seems to have been recently reinforced by a vague rumor that Heisenberg and others have swept away the concept of determinism from physical science. That the arguments on both sides are carried on with more sweeping enthusiasm than discrimination, is seen in the fact that both positivists and Hegelian idealists come to the same fatalistic conclusion that man cannot change the course of history; and from the determinist dogma quite opposing conclusions are drawn. Thus some hold that not only is history subject to laws but that only the superstition of free-will has prevented us from discover- ing them; while others argue that since the whole temporal system of events is determined, it is vain to pick out any one element in the world and say it is the cause of any particular event that follows it. In such a situation a review of elementary considerations seems worth while. The original sense of the word history, which still survives in the term natural history, included any description of the nature of anything, e.g., Aristotle's History of Animals or Theophrastus's 12</page><page sequence="2">CAUSATION AND ITS APPLICATION TO HISTORY 13 History of Plants. And though our word used simpliciter is today restricted to accounts of past happenings it still includes purely physical and biological as well as human events. Thus we have histories of our terrestrial globe or of parts of it as well as of various biologic species. Opponents of naturalism, such as Croce, may insist on restricting the word history not only to human affairs, but even to some particular phase of political-life in which they happen to be interested or to some special way of dealing with it. But no arbitrary definition or resolution to use a word in a peculiar sense can well deny that biographies such as Plutarch's Life of Caesar and Tacitus's Life of Agricola are substantially histories of Rome or that Herodotus was justified in including the development of the Nile, its delta, and the soil of Egypt, in the magnificent book which has given him the title, The Father of History. There are doubtless distinctive elements in human affairs which give distinctive form to the causal relation that is applicable to them. But since men are born, live, and die on this earth, and their activities are conditioned by the presence or absence of food, water, and other physical and biological factors, the meaning of causality in history cannot be altogether unrelated to its meaning in the natural sciences. It is well, therefore, to consider first the general nature of causation before dealing with the special features which it assumes in human history. I It is interesting to note in passing that the word cause, from the Latin causa, corresponding to the Greek aLnLa, is originally a social and more specifically a legal term. This sense continues in the phrase "cause of action" or "legal case." It came into nat- ural philosophy through the analogy of nature to a well ordered realm ruled by law. The Greek as well as the modern historians used a variety of expressions for the causal relation, e.g., an ante- cedent led to, gave rise to, brought about, made, produced, created, or influenced a certain consequent, or the latter was due to, resulted from, came as a consequence of, or was conditioned by the former. Polybius' drew explicit distinctions between aLt-La 2rpoqaaus and apxfi i.e., the motive force, the excuse or reason, and the beginning or origin, in German Ursache. Aristotle's famous doctrine of the four causes: the material, the form, the efficient cause, and the pur- 1 Histories, III cc 6-7, 31.</page><page sequence="3">14 MORRIS R. COHEN pose or end, deal with what we would call today the grounds or reasons why anything whatsoever takes place in the way it does. It is thus not much different from the modern principle of sufficient reason except that in the interest of clarity we restrict the causal relation to changes or phenomena in time and space. In general we all believe that human, like other events, are in some way connected, and that there is always a reason or ground why anything happens. Only that which has nothing beside or outside of itself to change it in any way can be causeless or causa sui, e.g., Spinoza's Substance or Hegel's Absolute Idea. This can- not be said of anything which is a part of the temporal stream. That is why we ask such questions as what brought about the pres- ent war, the depression of 1929, or any other event in which we are at all interested. But it is obviously not enough to say that events are in some way connected. The significant question is what is the nature of this connection. Since history deals with occurrences in time, the element of temporal sequence must enter into causality and distinguish it from the relation between whole and part, form and content, or any other abstract, purely logical or mathematical, condition. It also seems wise at the outset to be cautioned against the ancient fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc. WVThatever causality may be it is more than mere succession in time. All sorts of superstitions and absurdities result from ignorng this, for instance, arguing that because the introduction of a new game of cards preceded a given event such as an epidemic of dysentery, the former was the cause of the latter. However, though this is elementary, an influential philosophic doctrine urges that causality is nothing but repeated succession. And under the name of correlation this has become a canon of scientific procedure among recent "research" workers in psychology, sociology and education. This doctrine began with Hume's attempt to eliminate necessity from the causal relation by an argument similar to that by which Zeno seemed to disprove the possibility of motion. Having as a follower of Locke and Berkeley, reduced every- thing to a discrete series of successive "'impressions " or v ideas ' v as "states of mind," he naturally could not find that any conse- quent " state " was contained in any antecedent one, and this seemed to rule out any real or necessary connection between things. Not only as a historian and in his more mature Essays, but even</page><page sequence="4">CAUSATION AND ITS APPLICATION TO HISTORY 15 in his youthful Treatise, Hume himself was candid enough to recog- nize the untenability of the completely sceptical or nihilistic results of his basic assumptions. He admitted that in practice we must continue to believe that things are really or necessarily connected. Nor does it require much acumen to see the inconsistency of reduc- ing all causality to mere succession and then explaining the belief in, or habitual expectation of, necessary connection as caused by the repetition of the same sequence of events. In the first place, it is not true that the repetition of any succession has always been followed by the expectation of its invariant recurrence. The fact that some people rightly or wrongly see causal relations where others have for ages failed to suspect their existence, suggests that the issue is not so simple. Moreover the expectation that the future will be like the past assumes a certain inherent and invari- ant constancy in the order of nature which no number of past obser- vations can by themselves prove. The fact that for twenty-five thousand days in succession a man has taken a walk before break- fast will not prevent his failure to do so tomorrow. Despite its logical frailties, however, the Humean doctrine has found powerful support not only in the forces which have made for modern subjectivism or extreme psychologic individualism, but curiously enough in the modern effort to eliminate all occult quali- ties and anthropomorphism from the field of physics. As the popular notion of cause involves some analogy to human action in which purpose and effort enter, physicists have sought to purify their science from all such implications by reducing their descrip- tions to mathematical relations between observable elements or operations. It is this which led Karl Pearson, whose special field of competence was in the mathematics of statistics, to the attempt to make correlation take the place of causation. But the fact that many have uncritically accepted Pearson as an authority on scientific method generally, cannot wipe out a logi- cal difference in the nature of things. A correlation is an empiri- cal or historical statement that in a certain proportion of instances two elements have occurred simultaneously or successively. A causal relation asserts more than mere past coincidence. It affirms that there is some reason or ground why, whenever the antecedent occurs, the consequent must follow. The assertion of a causal relation may be false in fact, or not supported by adequate evi- dence, but the element of necessity, the exclusion of a contrary</page><page sequence="5">16 MORRIS R. COHEN possibility, is an essential part of its meaning. Even if it were true that every time we observed a uniform succession we inferred a causal relation, the content of the proposition inferred would still be logically different from that which led to it. The foregoing does not deny that the observation of a correla- tion frequently suggests or leads us to discover a causal relation. What we have insisted on is that correlations are often mere coin- cidences that do not indicate any significant connection, or any reason for expecting such correlation to continue. I have on sev- eral occasions referred to the high correlation of 87% for 13 years between the death-rate in the State of Hyderabad and the member- ship in the International (American) Machinists Union. If there are not many instances of this sort, it is because we do not, as a rule, look for them. We generally begin with a hunch or a sus- picion of a causal relation between certain facts and seek for corre- lation to confirm it. But to regard such confirmation as proof is to commit the fallacy of arguing from the affirmation of the conse- quent. A number of diverse hypotheses, notably theologic ones, find their teachings confirmed by everything that happens, but this will not verify any one of them. For verification involves not only confirmation but the exclusion or disproof of alternative hypotheses. Suppose it were established that between 58 B.C. and 107 A.D. every invasion of or rebellion in the Roman Empire was preceded by a "disturbance" in the trade routes between China and Rome. Clearly that would not be sufficient to prove a causal relation. For if previous or subsequent invasions or rebellions had no such an- tecedents, or if "disturbances" of these trade routes were not at other times followed by wars of this kind, the assertion that the correlation for the limited period was more than a series of coinci- dences would be definitely disproved. Nor would the existence of such correlation exclude the possibility that even in the given cases such factors as love of independence, irritations at Roman oppres- sion, the attraction of richer lands, or the ambition of kings or powerful leaders, were the direct or immediate causes. To main- tain the thesis in question we should have to prove that such a rebellion as that of Judea in 68 B.C. was not caused by religious differences or anything other than a disturbance in the trade routes between China and Rome. Suppose that our meteorologic records showed that the average</page><page sequence="6">CAUSATION AND ITS APPLICATION TO HISTORY 17 rainfall in our states was for a number of years higher under Republican than under Democratic governors, should we hold that a causal relation was thus established? The objection might at once be raised that no one supposes that a natural phenomenon such as rain could be influenced by any purely political event. But if we ignore the fact that many have attributed the absence of rain to the moral or religious sins of governors or their people, and have sought to bring about a greater rainfall by prayer, the fore- going objection only confirms the necessity for distinguishing between correlation and causation. For it admits that the causal relation holds only between the members of certain classes of phe- nomena. Now it is most important to be on guard against the fal- lacy of selection, of generalizing about any group which we have selected as a class. Thus if a number of Chinese merchants fail to pay their bills promptly, I may readily be led to regard their failure as connected with their being Chinese, whereas it may be due to quite different conditions, such as the fact that they are all, like others not known to me, connected with a certain bank, that they are all among those who sold goods to a certain bankrupt firm or to a depressed economic class, or because of some other unknown reason. Historical phenomena do not come to us already properly clas- sified. It is we who classify them in diverse ways according to the purposes of our inquiry. The category of "trade disturbance" may thus include diverse phenomena some of which may and some of which may not be relevant to the invasions of the Roman Empire or to rebellions within it.2 It is true that two phenomena between which there is no direct causal relation may, if they vary concomitantly, be the effects of a common cause. Thus, suppose we find that states with a high de- gree of literacy excel in crime. It will not necessarily be true that either crime is the cause of literacy or vice versa, but both may be 2 Even the terms invasion, rebellion and war denote things so heterogeneous that discrimination leading to the recognition of different kinds or sub-classes is necessary before we can expect to find a common cause. Villa's invasion of the United States was quite a different affair from Burgoyne's, and an American Indian rebellion or war a quite different sort of event from the World War. Similarly raids of Kurdish tribes were different kinds of affairs than the invasion of Rome by Hannibal or of Illyria by Rome. In the present state of our knowledge, it is futile to ask the cause of disease. We must in our aetiology first deal with different kinds of diseases; and much more is this the case with wars.</page><page sequence="7">18 MORRIS R. COHEN consequences of a relatively larger proportion of urban population. "The Island of St. Kilda is not rich enough to support a single pickpocket. " But that only pushes back the problem how to deter- mine that any circumstance such as city life is the cause of such phenomena as greater literacy and greater criminality. Thus, despite some amateurish philosophizing on the part of some physicists or biologists when they take a vacation from the field of their special competence, the fact is that natural science is never satisfied with empirical statistical correlation but ever seeks to formulate universal laws that assert not that A has followed B a number of times but that there is an intimate connection between the two such that whenever A occurs B must follow, i.e., the possi- bility of B not following A is ruled out. In putting its laws in the form of equations science always seeks to eliminate as far as possi- ble all arbitrary constants. When the inadequacy of mere correlation between two terms is recognized we try to establish the causal relation by interpolating a middle term. The ancients found a correlation between exposure to damp air, especially at night, and malaria. It was an essential task of biology and medical science to ask why these two should be thus connected. An intermediate term was found in the bite of certain mosquitoes. But why should the bite of the mosquito pro- duce the given result? Again an intermediate term is found in the virus that is injected into the organism by the bite. But why should that virus destroy the red blood corpuscles e It is obvious that no matter how many middle terms are thus interpolated we still have a discrete series and the question why two terms should be causally connected remains. This is, of course, no objection to a process which extends our knowledge even though it never can be absolutely completed. The prolongation of life may be desirable though the hour of death is only postponed thereby. Natural science, however, sets before itself a definite ideal of transforming the discrete series into a continuous one by finding an element of identity between antecedent and consequent and thus justifying the judgment of necessary connection. We approximate to that ideal in the laws of conservation of mass and energy, and indeed, in all the formulae of mathematical physics in which certain relations remain invariant. Assuming some identity throughout all the physical processes, the connection between any two states can be- come a necessary one. We explain why water and sunshine are</page><page sequence="8">CAUSATION AND ITS APPLICATION TO HISTORY 19 necessary for plants if we show the identity of the water and the plant tissue or the identity of the energy in the sun's rays and that by which the chlorophyl transforms inorganic into organic com- pounds. In that phase of their being in which things are identical they cannot be different, though they must be different in other respects in order to be at all distinguishable and thus form a plurality of things. The prejudice against admitting the element of necessity in our world has been largely supported by the reaction against those metaphysical theories which try to put customary or cherished but questionable opinions beyond attack by enthroning them as neces- sary truths. But it is really impossible to get along in our daily life or in scientific investigation without the idea of necessity. Every day we recognize that certain acts are necessary, i.e., that we have no alternative. In mathematics we prove that the Pytha- gorean theorem necessarily follows from Euclidean axioms by showing that it is impossible for the latter to be true and the for- mer to be false. Similarly we prove that it is impossible for physi- cal things to have certain properties without having others that are logically or mathematically connected with them. Thus we prove that if the earth, sun and moon are in a given position and their motions conform to the law of gravitation, an eclipse must neces- sarily follow at a certain time. It will be seen that the necessity of physical happenings is thus conditional, i.e., no event is necessary absolutely or by itself but only if it is connected with other events and is thus part of a sys- tem. To this human events are clearly no exception. We may now sum up our discussion thus far by saying that in its most rigorous form causality denotes the sum of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the occurrence of any event. A cir- cumstance that is not necessary for a given event, i.e., if the event can take place without it, cannot be the cause. And similarly if a circumstance is not sufficient to bring about the given event, i.e., if the former can occur without the latter, it cannot be the cause. We must, however, recognize that popular discourse and thought do not always conform to this definite test of causality. This shows itself in the view that there can be a plurality of causes. Thus it is said that a headache may be due to noxious vapors, to eye strain, to indigestion, or to various other antecedents. Similarly it is said that wars can be caused by the ambition of rulers, or be forced on</page><page sequence="9">20 MORRIS REt. COHEN them by all sorts of circumstances. It has, however, been readily shown that the appearance of a plurality of causes is merely the failure to refine the classification of antecedents and consequence to the same extent. Different organic conditions produce different sorts of headaches; and what is common to all of the latter corre- sponds to what is common to eye strain, indigestion, etc. So like- wise are there various kinds of wars and the courses they take are not independent of the specific conditions which lead to them. The rigorous test of causality is professed by the conscientious historical investigator and often applied by the critic of proposed causes for known events. When sober students of history deny that the Battle of Tours was the cause of the check to Arab power in the West, or that Waterloo was the decisive cause of the elimina- tion of Napoleon, they show that these battles were unnecessary for the occurrence of the given results, that the latter would in all probability have occurred even if these battles had not taken place. Similarly we reject oppression of the masses as a sufficient cause for a revolution by showing that oppressed people sometimes be- come weak, apathetic and lack the power to organize successful revolutions. But the historian as a narrator of what happens is under pressure to tell a coherent story and this does not permit him to stop to indicate ever so often the inadequacy or inconclu- siveness of his evidence. Hence most historians adopt much looser conceptions of causality. One of the serious obstacles to a rigorous consideration of the evidence necessary to establish causal relation in history is the wide acceptance of the positivistic and narrowly empiricist dogma, professed even by such idealists as Croce, that history is not at all concerned with what might or could have happened. It is curious that those most concerned with the close relation between history and practice should hold this dogma, when it is so obvious that all practical activity involves weighing the consequences of alterna- tives only one of which is realized. Indeed we cannot grasp the full significance of what happened unless we have some idea of what the situation would have been otherwise. Nor is there much logical force in the argument that all our evidence bears on what did happen and not at all on what might have happened. There is considerable evidence that if Alexander had been drowned cross- ing the Granicus none of his generals could have accomplished what he did. For in fact the events after his death showed that</page><page sequence="10">CAUSATION AND ITS APPLICATION TO HISTORY 21 no one of them could sufficiently control the others. Similarly it can be hardly be questioned that if Lincoln had not been murdered, his national prestige, his influence in the Republican party, and his political tact and experience would have enabled him to guide the Reconstruction of the South more successfully in a humane direc- tion than was possible for a southern Democrat as inadaptable to the actual situation as was Andrew Johnson. The objection, however, has been raised that histories deal with individual unrepeatable events, that causal efficacy holds only be- tween them, and that the introduction of laws is at best a purely verbal device which may help to describe multitudes of facts but does not add to our knowledge of any particular occurrence. To explain the fall of an apple by the law of gravitation seems like explaining why I feel hungry by the fact that many others also do. This objection oversimplifies the uniqueness of historic events and misses the true role of laws as universal propositions. The absolutely unique, that which has no element in common with anything else, is indescribable-since all description and all analysis are in terms of predicates, class concepts or repeatable relations. Let us take a unique event, for example, that King John signed the Magna Charta at Runnymede on June 6th, 1415 A.D. Neither the individual John, the date, nor the specific act will occur again. Yet our statement identifies John as one of a class, the kings of England, who are defined as the occupants of certain offices or as bearing certain relations to the various elements of the people of England. Magna Charta is significant as one of a number of political documents; and not only is the physical act of signing repeatable but the motives which we assume compelled John to do it are recurrent ones in human experience. The date itself denotes a unique or unrepeatable state of the world. But note that it is defined in terms of a number of repeatable intervals, namely, years. Although language can never be self-sufficient and ultimately always depends upon a demonstrative element, i.e., a pointing to something which must be experienced, yet that to which the demonstrative points has its character determined by its abstract or repeatable traits. The nominalist misses the practical and theoretic significance of universal laws as hypotheses in regard to what are the invariant connections between abstract phases of particular events or exis- tences. Common experience only roughly blocks out, from the big</page><page sequence="11">22 MORRIS R. COHEN blooming confusion that nature presents to the undeveloped intel- ligence, such objects and sequences as more or less immediately serve organic or practical needs. To obtain more accurate knowl- edge of nature we need more refined analysis than is possible with the less discriminately used categories of common sense. Unsup- ported objects such as apples and feathers fall with varying veloci- ties, but others such as smoke or balloons go up, and the planets move in peculiarly tortuous ways in relation to the fixed stars or our earth. Can we formulate an accurate universal proposition (i.e., one without any exception) that will enable us to tell what is relevant and what is irrelevant to all these motions? The law of gravitation does precisely this. It not only widens our horizon and integrates diverse realms, but apparent exceptions are ex- plained by seeking and finding other laws such as those of elec- tricity and magnetism. This picking out of the elements which are relevant or causally related to a given phenomenon is the essence of the service which science renders in making the world intelligible and manageable. It may well be argued that the physical laws which thus connect phenomena in necessary relations are themselves contingent, that is, they are either generalizations from empirically observed phenomena or they are derived from wider generalizations of the way things have happened to appear. Since all proof of existence rests on assumptions, it is not possible to prove everything, and contingency cannot thus ever be entirely removed. Note, however, that while a law such as Newton's in regard to gravitation cannot be proved by the consequences which it explains, it cannot be utterly or entirely false so far as it describes what has actually been observed to happen on such a large scale. Another law such as Einstein's may replace it as a more accurate description. But such other law will have to include the truth of the older one under restricted conditions. And this the general theory of relativity indeed does, just as the modern electro-magnetic theory of light includes both the older wave and the corpuscular theories to the extent that they actually described optical phenomena. It has been suggested by Poincare and Peirce that the laws of uniformity of nature which in our present era seem to hold true may really be changing slowly so that in the remote future gravi- tation may vary not as at present, according to the inverse square, but according to some higher or lower power. Though there is no</page><page sequence="12">CAUSATION AND ITS APPLICATION TO HISTORY 23 positive evidence for this it must be admitted that we know nothing that makes this impossible. But even if the laws now assumed are found to be changing, science will have to seek a law or formula for their variation, however difficult it might be to discover it. Thus while it is possible to question any particular law it is neither practically nor theoretically feasible to believe that there are no laws whatsoever in the world of existence. It is not practi- cally possible because all rational or deliberative conduct is based upon the assumption of some fixed order or mechanism by which our objectives can be realized. Nor could any account or descrip- tion be given of any natural realm if there were no identity of any- thing at different moments. Science and sanity postulate a world in which there are certain fixed characters. A world in which nothing was impossible, in which a smile could become a forest fire or the clothes on my back a highroad or river, would be a chaos beyond anything in the most insane mind, and there could be no investigation in such a world, since nothing could be determined about anything in it. Confusion on this point has resulted from the failure to dis- criminate between two kinds of determinism which may be respec- tively called absolute and qualified. The former is characteristic of philosophies which, like that of Spinoza or Hegel, allow for no genuine alternatives in the absolute reality. Contrary to the gen- eral impression, the system of laws which is the object of science does allow for contingency and irrelevance in the world. The dif- ference between the two kinds of determinism may be represented by the following image. Let us take some complicated modern drawing or painting that has no symmetry or repetitions in it. Let us cut it up into a num- ber of small pieces, no two of which have the same shape, shuffle them up, and then try to rearrange them so as to recreate the orig- inal. The solution of the problem is absolutely determinate in that each fragment has one and only one place where it can fit. Every piece has a unique relation to every other piece, and if only one is missing the original design of the whole cannot be grasped, since the parts already known will not supply us with any analogies whereby we can fill in what is missing. For a model of a limited determinist system let us take a pic- ture that has a good deal of symmetry and repetition. Cut it up so that many pieces are like others and a number of smaller pieces</page><page sequence="13">24 MORRIS R. COHEN can be combined to fill the place of a larger one. Since the original design is a definite one the problem of reconstructing it is also determinate. But in solving it analogies or laws may be discov- ered as to how various fragments should be put together; and when we come to a gap, we can on the basis of analogies to other parts form reasonable hypotheses as to how to fill it. Now in an absolutely determinate system such as Spinoza's Substance, Hegel 's Absolute, Mill's total state of the universe which is the cause of any particular change,-all of which are popularly expressed in Tennyson's "Flower in the crannied wall," -there is no room for repetitions or laws. For every event in it is absolutely unique and connected with everything else in a unique or unrepeatable manner. But in the world of practice and science there are fungible or replaceable things, and it is the fact of simi- larity or repeatability of patterns that makes possible the laws of natural science. Consider a homely example. The water-pipe in my cellar bursts. On the previous day a woman with an envious disposition passed my house. Since the latter was undoubtedly a part of the total world of events, the "organic" view must regard it as part of the cause. But according to this mode of reasoning every other past event was a part of the cause, and there is no reason for pick- ing out the frost and the character of the pipes. We should thus have no guidance in trying to prevent the recurrence of the unfor- tunate event, nor would there be any point in saying that the freez- ing and expansion of water depends upon temperature if it also depends on everything else. Science and practice assume a world in which not everything, but only certain things or factors are relevant to a given event. This realization that there are irrelevancies in the world en- ables us to see how one-sided or superficial is the view that there are no accidental or fortuitous coincidences in nature or history. If causation takes place only along certain lines, then the coinci- dence or crossing of two such lines is an accidental event in each, since it is not determined by the nature of either alone. Accidents, like necessity, are relative to our system. Now it may well be argued that if one knows the time and place at which two appar- ently independent systems or bodies start, and the directions and velocities at which they travel, one can predict where and when their paths will cross, just as we can tell when the two hands of a</page><page sequence="14">CAUSATION AND ITS APPLICATION TO HISTORY 25 clock will cross. But, from this argument it does not follow that there is no contingency in nature. We can predict when the hour and hands will cross only on the assumption that our clock will always keep perfect time which unfortunately no actual instrument ever does. We cannot tell when it will slow down or stop alto- gether. The Laplacian intelligence that can predict every natural event can deal only with a world in which every particle moves according to a formula that does not change with time. But even in such a world such an intelligence would have to know the actual coordinates of all the (finite or infinite) particles that constitute the world at any one moment, and these would be contingent (or derived from a previous contingent state). Even the ultimate formula according to which all motion is to take place would be contingent in the sense that it would at best be a statement that we have found the world to behave in accordance with it. We could not prove the impossibility of the world behaving according to some other formula. Contingency cannot therefore be entirely eliminated. But neither can we get rid of relative necessity. When the proper discrimination is made, there is no contradiction between the two-certainly not so long as we restrict ourselves to finite or limited systems. II We may now consider some of the distinctive traits of causal laws in human history. (1) In doing so we must be especially on guard against the complementary fallacies of pan-logism and nominalism. Though history must implicitly or explicitly involve laws if we are to pass from present data to past facts, the search for the latter as they actually occurred distinguishes truthful history from works of fic- tion. And it is a demonstrable error to suppose that anything in regard to specific existence can be deduced from purely logical con- siderations. In this respect history is like geology or any branch of applied rather than theoretic physics. On the other hand to assign a cause for that which is unique in a given event is to indulge in unverifiable guess-work-since veri- fication involves deduction from hypothesis and repetition of ex- perimental conditions. Biology does not pretend to be able to explain "sports" or extreme variations and the historian or social scientist cannot explain what it was that enabled men of genius to</page><page sequence="15">26 MORRIS R. COHEN do the unprecedented things which they did, as in the case of Homer, Amos, Buddha, Irnerius, or Shakespeare. Climate, race, epoch, or the class struggle will not explain the difference between Bacon and Coke, Jesus and Judas, Thomas Jefferson and John Marshall. And so the historian cannot really explain why in a little backward corner of the world there should arise the remark- able group of Hebrew prophets, why within such a short period the city of Athens should have produced Socrates and Plato, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, and Aristophanes, Thucydides and Xenophon, or why Germany should within 100 years have brougth forth Lessing, Kant, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, and Schopenhauer. We can, however, say that there can be no writers in a community where writing is unknown, and that these men could not have done what they did if there were not conditions which made it possible for them to undertake what they did and find some support from others for carrying on their work. (2) While there is nothing to indicate that the events of human history may not be connected according to some laws or invariant order, we must not jump to the uncritical assumption that these laws must have as simple a form as those of mechanics, astronomy, or other branch of physics. Let us note, to begin with, that the phenomena of civilization are infinitely more complex, since they include biologic and mental as well as inorganic factors. And when situations depend upon too large a number of factors, or when these factors do not form a linear series, but modify each other in complex ways, we may not ever be able to discover the laws or to formulate manageable equations for dealing with the phenomena. We make progress in natural science, when we can vary one factor and keep every other constant. Such experimental conditions are not generally available in the human or even always in the purely biologic field. (3) Time enters into human history, as in the organic realm generally, in a way that it does not in the inorganic realm. We may pass over the significant question as to whether new elements do not develop in the course of time as distinctive individuals or unprecedented social institutions enter the social arena. For even in the purely inorganic realm there are genuine novelties when new combinations are formed, e.g., when fluorine is combined with oxy- gen. (It is an error to assume that all the properties of a com- pound can be deduced from the nature of its elements.) But past</page><page sequence="16">CAUSATION AND ITS APPLICATION TO HISTORY 27 events have a more persistent and uneliminable influence in the organic and human than in the inorganic realms. If we have the mechanical or electrical coordinates of a body or physical system, we do not need to inquire into its past history to determine its future course. To put it in other terms, physical systems can gen- erally be restored to previous conditions and the effects of inter- vening history thus eliminated. This cannot be done in the or- ganic and human realm where the effect of age and experience cannot be wiped out. When sociologists, economists and other students of human affairs speak of social dynamics, social forces, or conditions of equilibrium, they obviously have physics before them as the model science. Now the laws of physics are formu- lated as equations in which there enter indefinitely repeatable time and space intervals but no dates or locations. The latter are essential ingredients in history. (4) The laws peculiar to history proposed by Plato, Aristotle, Vico, Hegel, Comte, Marx, Spencer, Spengler and others, take the form of a series of stages, like the stages in the growth of an organ- ism, which, it is claimed, necessarily succeed each other in an invariant order. Such laws cannot be reduced to differential equations which assume a continuity holding in the most minute intervals. History takes a macroscopic or mesoscopic rather than a microscopic view of events. Historic events may in part be explained by laws expressing what goes on in the microscopic realm. But human intelligence has met with such difficulty in thus explaining the most elementary phases of our history that a com- plete explanation would be beyond our hopes, even if it were not logically impossible to a finite mind that is dependent on temporal experience. (5) One of the complexities which distinguish causation in human history is the fact that our ability to foresee part of the future modifies our conduct in the present. Some of those who believe in free will have used this as an argument against any application of ordinary causality to human affairs. But this is by no means a necessary consequence of recognizing that intelligent volition is a factor in our history. We may for our present limited purpose ignore the strictly metaphysical or supernatural aspect of the question, since ordinary history can restrict itself to the ascer- tainable manifestations of human will in the world of time and space. The issue thus reduces itself to two questions: (a) Is</page><page sequence="17">28 MORRIS R. COHEN human volition a verifiable causal element in history, and (b) are there ascertainable causes for the ways in which human beings exercise the volition that history can recognize? (a) That men often deliberate and make up their minds to do certain things rather than others is an undeniable fact in history. And we generally regard it as a cause or part of the cause for the building or destroying of churches, houses, bridges, writing or publishing books, or engaging in any of the arts. There seems little doubt that people who have certain ideas on religion or poli- tics will in many respects act differently from those who hold opposing convictions. Sometimes we actually see persons chang- ing their courses of conduct when they become converted to a new creed. This, however, does not mean that pure or disembodied thought is known to be a cause for any event in nature. For we do not know of any human volition apart from a physical organism. We cannot by mere thinking or willing add a cubit unto our stature or even make an automobile go. We can express ourselves and modify the physical world only by some physical act of our organ- ism, such as to make sounds, gestures, marks on paper, or the like. (b) In our daily judgments of people and events, few of us doubt that what men and women will to do depends on all sorts of physical, physiological, and social conditions. This does not mean that under the same socio-historic circumstances all men and women will act in the same way. Different individuals approach the same or similar situations with different attitudes and much depends on what we call their character. But in the formation of these characters, early training and socio-historic environment are not irrelevant. This is shown by the fact that the more we know of the past of individuals or groups the better we can predict how they will act. Far from believing that any of us are free to will anything at all, we resent the suggestion that we are capable of desiring or willing to bring about things that are atrocious, dis- honorable, or insane. There are doubtless insuperable difficulties in finding out in advance, with any high degree of rigor and ac- curacy, what people will want to do under given conditions. But to deny the possibility of any prediction at all is inconsistent with practice and the postulates of rational science or history. There is a difference between difficulties and impossibilities. We may conclude by noting some consequences of the concep- tion of causation as equivalent to the sum of necessary and suffi-</page><page sequence="18">CAUSATION AND ITS APPLICATION TO HISTORY 29 cient conditions. The application of this concept to the events which constitute human history is both a necessary ideal and yet inherently difficult of attainment. The best we can achieve by rigorous scientific procedure is some progress in the approxima- tion to this ideal. The number of circumstances or factors in- volved in the cause of any specific event may be far in excess of those that are humanly ascertainable. But we can say with a great deal of confidence that some things are altogether irrelevant and some conditions are more directly involved than others in bringing about certain events. Our most serious difficulties arise from the fact that the terms between which social or historical causation holds are not generally clearly defined as they are in the physical sciences. As was indicated before, any two terms must have a certain homogeneity if the causal relation is to hold between them. Wisdom here as elsewhere consists in analyzing our questions before we attempt to answer them. Thus when anyone asks whether it is religion or economics that is the cause of a given event, it is helpful to remember that such elements as religion and economics are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and that to an- swer the question which is more important we must have some definite measure of importance. Above all, we must beware of the popular fallacy which assumes that all social elements or institu- tions form a linear series, so that between any two one can always say which is prior to the other. For obviously many institutions are co-existent and continue to modify each other. Thus ignorance and poverty may each be said to be the cause of the other, and that the state brings law into being is as true as that law shapes and brings the state into being. But the detailed analysis of the rela- tions between the different factors in historical causation is not the object of this paper. The reflections here offered are intended as an aid in such analysis. University of Chicago.</page></plain_text>
