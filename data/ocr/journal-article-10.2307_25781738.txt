<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN "OTHER OBJECT OF NOTE": Circle and Point in Samuel Beckett's Watt Chris Ackerley Although the picture of a circle and centre is present in the earliest drafts of Watt, the painting itself underwent several significant changes before obtaining its final form (Watt, 128-31). A curiosity arises concerning the words "right" and "left" used to define the relationship of point to circle, for these finally assume the perspective of the object perceived, rather than that of the subject perceiving. Tracing this detail through the various notebooks, manuscripts and typescript (particularly those at the Harry Ransom Humanities Center, Austin) offers unexpected insights into Beckett's wider artistic practice, as well as into the evolution of Watt. "A small circle is quite as infinite as a large circle, but though it is quite as infinite it is not so large." ? G.K. Chesterton. When Watt finally gets into Erskine's room ("Ruse a by, he said"), he finds therein a bell, which is broken (raising the unanswered question of exactly how Mr. Knott summons Erskine in the night), and "a pic ture, hanging on the wall, from a nail" (Watt, 128). The picture, of a circle "obviously described by a compass, and broken at its lowest point" and a point, or dot, perhaps its centre or a centre, is called an "other object of note". This echoes the earlier incident of note (72), concerning the Galls father and son, and raises similar questions about the "fragility of outer meaning" (73) and "the simple games time plays with space" (75). Watt's peculiar character is his need to enquire into what things meant, "oh not what they really meant, his character was not so peculiar as all that, but into what they might be induced to mean, with the help of a little patience, a little ingenuity" (75); but just as the</page><page sequence="2">320 Chris Ackerley incident of the Galls rapidly ceases to retain its paltry significance (74), Watt's interrogation of the picture yields nothing satisfactory: "On the contrary, as time passed, its significance diminished" (208). Like the incident of the Galls father and son, the picture acts as an index both of Watt's attempts to open tins with the blowlamp of his understanding (136), and of the emptiness he finds within. The reader's experience is similar. A little patience, a little ingenuity, induce various possibilities: circle and point as emblems of Knott and Watt; the shifting relationship of figure and ground in Watt's world; paradoxes of perception as the perceiving subject confronts the object perceived; images of time and space, birth and death (breach and nadir); but, however exhaustive the inquiry, an impossible gap remains between the rational and the real, between Watt and Knott, a gulf that finally cannot be overcome. This is the "gouffre interdit a nos sondes" of Beckett's essay on Proust (31), the deep gulf separating Lazarus and Dives (an image reiterated in much of Beckett's early writing), or that between Murphy and the inmates of the MMM (Murphy, 236), the scholastic disjunction between esse in intellectu and esse in re, between man and God, here translated into a deceptively simple (but infinitely provoking) paradigm of art, a fundamental sound. Beckett's notebooks reveal that this picture was present in the earliest stages of the novel, but the rewriting bears witness to his refining of perceptual paradoxes, and to a major change of perspective at a surprisingly late point in the compositional process. Consider the following passage (Watt, 129): Watt wondered how this picture would look upside down, with the point west and the breach north, or on its right side, with the point north and the breach east, or on its left side, with the point south and the breach west. There is a curiosity about this description: the relationship of point and breach, as defined by the compass points, makes sense only as a mirror image. That is, "its" relates not (as one tends to assume, with what Beckett terms elsewhere an anthropomorphic insolence) to the perspec tive of the viewing subject but to that of the picture itself. This rupture of the expected relationship of subject and object corresponds to similar dislocations in Watt's world. (I add, parenthetically, that the cover of the Evergreen Original, the standard Grove Press edition, in represent ing circle and point, not only does so in a curious colour and with an</page><page sequence="3">An "Other Object of Note": Circle and Point in Samuel Beckett's Watt 321 incongruous cut in the canvas to denote the breach, but also misplaces the point, to the west [our left] when it should be in the east [our right], relative to the breach). The purpose of this paper is to trace through Beckett's notebooks the evolution of this detail. The notebooks in question are those at the Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas at Austin, as catalogued in Carlton Lake's No Symbols Where None Intended (1984). Item #157 (75-76) is described thus: "Watt." Autograph manuscript, signed, 1940-1945, 945 pp. Written in ink and colored crayons, in six notebooks, folio, 4to, and small 4to, and on loose sheets, some laid in notebooks, some separate. With many changes, deletions, and additions, and numerous doodles, sketches, mathematical calculations, rhyming schemes, and drawings. The first notebook is signed and marked "Watt 1," with the following note: "Watt was written in France during the war 1940-45 and published in 1953 by the Olympia Press." On an inserted sheet, Beckett has written, "Begun evening of Tuesday 11/2/41." The first page of the second notebook is dated "3/12/41". Notebook 3 shows the date"5.5.42" on the first page of text. The cover of the fourth notebook is marked "Poor Johnny / Watt / Roussillon," and page 1 is headed, "Roussillon, October 4th, 1943." On the cover of Notebook 5 Beckett has written, in variously colored inks, "Watt V / Suite etnfin / 18.2.45 / Paris / Et debut de L Absent I Novembre-Janvier 47/48." He has indicated that L 'Absent is Malone Meurt. Page 99 has the note, "End of the continuation of Watt. Conclusion in Notebook VI." Although in Notebook I, Beckett placed the completion of Watt in 1945, he concludes the sixth notebook with "Dec 28th 1944 / End." Lake describes this magnificent set as "a whale of a manuscript-a white whale," one that glows among the thousands of modern manuscripts at the HRHRC "like a luminous secular relic" (76). The next entry, #158 (76), more soberly describes the typescript: "Watt." Typed manuscript [some carbon copy], signed, 297 pp., 4to and folio. Marked at the beginning, "Original typescript of / Watt In complete / Samuel Beckett." With numerous autograph revisions</page><page sequence="4">322 Chris Ackerley and deletions, in ink, colored crayons, and pencil. Some doodles and mathematical calculations. With substantial differences from the published text. I shall standardise my references to the various notebooks (#157) as "NB I" to "NB VI" (Beckett uses variously arabic and capitalised Roman numbers), giving the HRHRC pagination. I shall refer to the typescript (#158) as "TS", using Beckett's pagination. My practice in this respect varies slightly from that of J.M. Coetzee, whose pioneering study of the manuscripts (1969) remains an invaluable point of departure. Coetzee identifies from the process of composition three major stages: A, a first holograph draft, 282 pages, itself a compendium of at least four stages (Al to A4), with a complex (and at times inchoate) evolution of plot, structure and style; B, a typescript recension with holograph corrections, incomplete (but coherent); and C, a conflation of part of B with a new holograph draft of 163 pages (but not existing in one tidy form). Coetzee notes that since C is close to the published text (which he refers to as W) only the printer's copy and the proofs are missing. The important point is that the typescript represents an important revision of the earlier drafts, intermediate between those (mostly) in Notebooks I to IV, and that revised, and (mostly) recorded in Notebooks V and VI (this presumably dates the typescript as 1944). The galley proofs of Watt are at Washington University, Saint Louis. They differ significantly from the typescript and in minor detail from C, but, with respect to the episode of circle and point, are identical to the final text; this confirms Coetzee's contention that little of significance is missing. Beckett's personal copies of the Olympia printing (1953), with changes marked for Grove Press, and of the Grove edition (1959), with changes marked for the Calder [Jupiter] edition (1963), are held at the Beckett International Foundation, University of Reading, but this episode is unaffected by such revision (despite a marginal instruction in Beckett's personal copy of the Grove edition requesting the Calder compositor to adjust the type and "set out to foist in 124" [sic, presumably in error for 128] a tiny doodle of the circle, the dot within the breach). Coetzee is excellent on the pattern of stylistic evolution of Watt, and in an Appendix (165-200) he discusses the episode of circle and point in meticulous detail, having chosen it deliberately as one that best reflects this process. He is particularly sensitive to the comedy of revi sion, to the ways that tiny changes of tonality tell different jokes, and to</page><page sequence="5">An "Other Object of Note": Circle and Point in Samuel Beckett's Watt 323 how a rhythm arises. He notes, perceptively (146), how the tone of Watt is uncannily like that of Descartes, but with the first-person changed to the third. Curiously, however, he pays little attention to how the picture is hung, nor to the changing perspective of how it might be viewed. Nor does he trace the ways in which the phrasing echoes Beckett's past and future concerns. I propose to build upon the excellent foundations that Coetzee lays, but to focus more closely on the picture, and to consider some of the thematic implications arising from its evolution through the various drafts. In the early drafts and typescript of Watt the picture is described as "a small coloured reproduction" (TS, 317), then "a painting by the Dutch painter X". It is mounted, but not framed, and attached to the wall by four tin-tacks, two and a half feet from the skirting, bulging a little from the wall. These matters explain why Watt (who did not ex amine it closely) took it at once for a reproduction rather than an origi nal work. The early drafts also consider at length (TS, 327-29) how the painting came to be there, and who brought it, with the tentative deduc tion that as the Dutch painter X has painted it only Walter could have brought it. Watt's knowledge of painting in the first drafts is quite ex tensive (he is able to date the painting to the month), but the lengthy satire of academia and academy is eroded in NB V, which, neverthe less, implies "intended" and "represented" as matters of distaste. The diminishing process is continued in the galleys, which introduce the phrases: "Watt knew nothing about painting" and "Watt knew nothing about physics". With respect to the latter, small changes from "motion" to "movement" and "limitless time" to "endless time" are not so much corrections of "a mathematically meaningless description" as Coetzee suggests (115), as intimations of a movement away from the pre Socratic concerns of Murphy, with its Atomist paradoxes of Motion (112-13) and the Doctrine of the Limit (50), and their more contempo rary analogues of Uncertainty and Relativity, towards the realm of im potence and ignorance that Watt increasingly inhabits, and that Beckett would explore more intensively in the great post-war fiction. The early drafts (Notebooks I to IV) contain a lot of detail about circles, arcs, sectors and tangents, but these were systematically elimi nated. Technically, the major figure is not a circle, but as the typescript notes (TS, 321), "rather an arc of three hundred and fifty or three hun dred and fifty-five degrees, for it was nothing more, a wide mathemati cal arc" (this anticipates the 360 intervals of the Frog Song). If this is so, then the very premise that the point is the centre of the circle is in</page><page sequence="6">324 Chris Ackerley validated. However, in accordance with the Gestaltist impulse to com plete the simplest figure, Watt does not entertain this possibility, but rather tries to ascertain the relationship of figure and ground (either the circle or the point may constitute the foreground). Nor does he entirely acknowledge the non-Euclidean possibility that the point could be the centre of an infinite number of circles, including or not including that depicted. He prefers rather to accept the circle as a circle, to assume that centre and point must "search" for the other, and to differentiate merely between "a centre" and "its centre" (and the negations thereof). Faced with the inexplicable, Watt takes refuge in Cartesian methodology, the attempt to enumerate and exhaust every logical possibility. Revisions of the text indicate a movement towards more (and more exhaustive) logical paradigms, often outlined in full, and this development is part of that process. Watt therefore tries (TS, 318) to determine the relationship of circle and dot by means of a truth-table, accepting "a circle" but exhausting the possibilities of "a centre" and/or "its centre" in one paradigm, and "not a centre" and/or "not its centre" with another: 1. a circle &amp; its centre in search of each other (1) 2. a circle &amp; its centre in search of its centre &amp; a circle (3) 5. a circle &amp; a centre not its centre in search of its centre &amp; its circle (5) 6. a circle &amp; a centre not its centre in search of its centre &amp; a circle (7) 3. a circle &amp; its centre in search of a centre and its circle (4) 4. a circle &amp; its centre in search of a centre &amp; a circle (2) 8. a circle &amp; a centre not its centre in search of a centre &amp; a circle (6) 7. a circle &amp; a centre not its centre in search of a centre &amp; its circle (8) its its its a a its a a its its a a its a a its The numbers on the left represent the order in the table that follows; the numbers on the right (circled by Beckett) indicate the order in which they finally would appear in the published text. The truth-table and the conclusions that derive from it first appear in the typescript (though not</page><page sequence="7">An "Other Object of Note": Circle and Point in Samuel Beckett's Watt 325 as part of the text), but the table is presented more precisely in NB V (76), and the conclusions are then added to the text: circle &amp; its centre circle &amp; not its centre its its its its a a a a its a its a a its a its The logic of such a truth-table is reductive, and while it may explain a relationship existing in two dimensions, it is of dubious efficacy with three (space), and cannot cope with four (time). Watt's simple games with space and time render it irrelevant, but Watt nevertheless persists with his Method, despite the tears that flow down his fluted (earlier, "hollow") cheeks, unchecked. If the circle is in any sense an emblem of God, "an infinite sphere whose centre is anywhere and whose circumference is nowhere" (compare Miss Counihan's bust [Murphy, 60]), it is here incomplete, broken, a violation of the image of perfection. Either way, the logic of the truth-table cannot apply. A major curiosity about the picture, in the published text, concerns the way that "its" right and left sides reflect the perspective of the painting, the object, and not that of Watt, the perceiving subject. This was a gradual evolution through the manuscripts, beginning with the following passage (NB III, 197): Watt wondered also how the painting, which was painted slightly buckled on a square board, would look upside down, with the point north right and the breach above, or on its right side, on its right right side that is from Watt's point of view, with its point south west below and the breach on the top, or on its left side, with the east</page><page sequence="8">326 Chris Ackerley point above and the breach on the left NB III (176) depicts these possibilities: The movement here is from the anthropomorphic perspectives of "above" and "below" to the more universal (non-subjective) directions of the compass. However, this process is but partial, and was taken further in the typescript collation (TS, 323): Watt also wondered how the painting, which was painted on a square and slightly buckled board, would look upside down, with the point west and the breach north, or on its left side right side, its right side that is from Watt's point of view, right with the point south and the breach west, or on its left side, with the point north and the breach east. Watt did nto [sic] wonder all these things at the time....</page><page sequence="9">An "Other Object of Note": Circle and Point in Samuel Beckett's Watt 327 There is at this point no reference to his taking down the picture, nor to the hook, nor to the erosion of the painting's significance in his mind. The picture is simply part of the establishment (not yet the "pre established arbitrary"), for when Erskine left he did not take it with him. The difference between the compass directions, "East" and "West", and the words "left" and "right", of course, is that between the objective mapping of external reality and one's subjective orientation. But even this mapping is conventional, based on the assumption that North is "above" and South "below". Compare the figure of North in "The Lost Ones": she is like Polaris, the North Star, offering direction and fixity in an otherwise featureless cylinder/universe, but her position is finally determined by nothing other than the place at which she chooses to sit. Such complexities do not enter here, but the movement from the subjective perspective to the objective is marked. NB V (79) consolidates these changes: Watt wondered how this picture would look upside down, with the point west &amp; the breach north, or on its left side, with the point south and the breach west, or on its right side, with the point north &amp; the breach east. So he took it from its hook and held it before his eyes, at arms' length, upside down, and on its left side and on its right side.... The mirror inversion is unambiguous, and although the given order dif fers from the published text the co-ordinates are in their final form. Tin tacks are replaced by hook (or nail), that Watt might more easily take the picture down. And the following paragraph introduces Watt's sen timent that relates it to the exigencies of birth and death: "It is by the nadir that we come and by the nadir that we go," the pun upon "breach" and "breech birth" finally irresistible, as the abstract form is made to</page><page sequence="10">328 Chris Ackerley mean, or induce, something (compare the ending of Malone Dies, and its process of death that is equally a monstrous breech-birth). A major difference between the published text of Watt and its ear lier incarnations concerns the speculations that ensue from this mo ment. The paragraph beginning (130) "But in these positions..." and concluding "So Watt put it back on its hook, in the position in which he found it", appears neither in the early manuscripts nor in the typescript. Instead, several pages of comment follow directly, Watt wondering about these things, about how the painting had got there, and whether it was part of Mr Knott's establishment, as suggested by Erskine's failure to take it with him when he left. Such "[prolonged and irksome medi tations" were finally curtailed, Notebook V (80) reducing them to the question "of great importance" (Watt, 130-31) concerning a term in a series, adding the likeness to Mr Knott's round bed to accentuate the image of the circle and eternity (NB V, 80), but finally putting an end to the speculation (NB V, 80; Watt, 131) with an unexpected sentiment, that "There were times when Watt could reason rapidly, almost as rap idly as Mr Nackybal" (yet to appear). This might be a mixed blessing. The Addenda of Watt describe (250-51) a "Second picture in Er skine's room", one singularly unmentioned in the body of the text, but present from the outset (NB I, 110; NB II, 7; TS, 93) as a portrait of Mr James (later Alexander) Quin, in the Chinnery-Slattery tradition, the work of the Master of the Leopardstown Half-lengths. Its inclusion in the final text, even as an appendix, complicates matters, for if this is a portrait of Mr Knott's father (as various manuscript details affirm) then Knott must be serial, one who comes and goes rather than abides. Only in the final Addenda is the picture placed in Erskine's room, it having previously occupied a place of honour above the fireplace in Mr Quin's dining room. The relationship of the two pictures raises complications beyond the scope of this study, but even as these fragments of the Ad denda affirm the serial theme, the relegation of the once-prominent por trait to the dusty coal-cellar of the Addenda promotes or foregrounds the enigma of ignorance and impotence reflected in the abstract depic tion of circle and point. The net effect of the late manuscript changes is to accentuate what were emerging from the swelter of previous inchoate detail as signifi cant themes: the break-down of figure and ground; the move into the virtual world of the mirror, anticipating the breakdown of Watt ("Ruse a by" was "By a ruse" until NB V); the serial theme; and the deteriora tion of Watt as he fails increasingly to respond to his world. In the last</page><page sequence="11">An "Other Object of Note": Circle and Point in Samuel Beckett's Watt 329 direct reference (208), the picture is described as a "coloured reproduc tion" that yielded nothing further, its significance having diminished as time passed. The phrase "coloured reproduction" was used frequently throughout the early drafts, when Watt failed to take it for an original work; but when the typescript was revised for Notebooks V and VI the words "picture" and "painting" were used exclusively in the earlier scene, so that when "reproduction" appears (or, more precisely, is added, between commas) at the end of the book it acts as an index of Watt's failure to respond to earlier stimuli. An analogous situation arises a little later (227), when Watt sees the figure of a man (or priest), and the comment is made: his concern is "not after all with what the figure was, in reality, but with what the figure appeared to be, in reality. For since when were Watt's concerns with what things were, in real ity?" Such echoes of the earlier incidents of note, the Galls father and son and the picture (or coloured reproduction), intensify the pathos. A final reflection, beyond the proper scope of this study, concerns the pertinence of this painting with respect to Beckett's reflections on the visual arts at about this time, notably "La Peinture des van Velde ou le monde et le pantalon" (1946; but written 1945), "Peintres de l'empechement" (1948), and, in particular, "Three Dialogues" (1949). Whether or not the Dutch painter X, before he was refined out of exis tence, represented Bram van Velde (I know nothing about painting), Beckett was clearly dissatisfied in Watt with the kind of art that remains on the plane of the feasible, that improves the result with a lick of Euclidean geometry, or that strains to "enlarge the statement of a com promise" ("Three Dialogues", 138-39). Watt's attempts to "explain" the picture illustrate a representational fallacy, the belief that art can some how be made to mean, rather than to express. Beckett had earlier de scribed in Proust (86) the "non-logical statement of phenomena in the order and exactitude of their perception, before they have been distorted into intelligibility in order to be forced into a chain of cause and effect"; Watt here attempts to distort the picture into intelligibility. It moves him quite literally to tears, and induces a kind of metaphysical anguish, but Watt's tragedy, ultimately, is that he does not possess the "violently extreme and personal point of view" advanced by B. in Dialogue 1 (that is, the need to express), and so is condemned to turn away in disgust, to do a little worse [sic] "the same old thing", and to go a little further along that "dreary road" that finally leads not to sanctuary but to the asylum.</page><page sequence="12">330 Chris Ackerley Note This article has relied upon the Notebooks and typescript of Watt held at the Harry Ransom Humanities Centre, University of Texas at Austin (items #157 and #158 in Lake, No Symbols [above]); the galley proofs of Watt held at Washington Univer sity, Saint Louis; and Samuel Beckett's personal copies of Watt (the Olympia and Grove editions) held at the Beckett International Foundation, University of Read ing.

From Watt (Grove Press, pp. 128-30) The only other object of note in Erskine's room was a picture, hanging on the wall, from a nail. A circle, obviously described by a compass, and broken at its lowest point, occupied the middle fore ground, of this picture. Was it receding? Watt had that impression. In the eastern background appeared a point, or dot. The circumference was</page><page sequence="13">An "Other Object of Note": Circle and Point in Samuel Beckett's Watt 331 black. The point was blue, but blue! The rest was white. How the effect of perspective was obtained Watt did not know. But it was obtained. By what means the illusion of movement in space, and it almost seemed in time, was given, Watt could not say. But it was given. Watt wondered how long it would be before the point and circle entered together upon the same plane. Or had they not done so already, or almost? And was it not rather the circle that was in the background, and the point that was in the foreground? Watt wondered if they had sighted each other, or were blindly flying thus, harried by some force of merely mechanical mutual attraction, or the playthings of chance. He wondered if they would eventually pause and converse, and perhaps even mingle, or keep steadfast on their ways, like ships in the night, prior to the inven tion of wireless telegraphy. Who knows, they might even collide. And he wondered what the artist had intended to represent (Watt knew noth ing about painting), a circle and its centre in search of each other, or a circle and its centre in search of a centre and a circle respectively, or a circle and its centre in search of its centre and a circle respectively, or a circle and its centre in search of a centre and its circle respectively, or a circle and a centre not its centre in search of its centre and its circle re spectively, or a circle and a centre not its centre in search of a centre and a circle respectively, or a circle and a centre not its centre in search of its centre and a circle respectively, or a circle and a centre not its centre in search of a centre and its circle respectively, in boundless space, in endless time (Watt knew nothing about physics), and at the thought that it was perhaps this, a circle and a centre not its centre in search of a centre and its circle respectively, in boundless space, in end less time, then Watt's eyes filled with tears that he could not stem, and they flowed down his fluted cheeks unchecked, in a steady flow, re freshing him greatly. Watt wondered how this picture would look upside down, with the point west and the breach north, or on its right side, with the point north and the breach east, or on its left side, with the point south and the breach west. So he took it from its hook and held it before his eyes, at arm's length, upside down, and on its right side, and on its left side. But in these positions the picture pleased Watt less than it had when on the wall. And the reason for that was perhaps this, that the breach ceased to be below. And the thought of the point slipping in from below at last, when it came home at last, or to its new home, and the thought of the breach open below perhaps for ever in vain, these</page><page sequence="14">332 Chris Ackerley thoughts, to please Watt as they did, required the breach to be below, and nowhere else. It is by the nadir that we come, said Watt, and it is by the nadir that we go, whatever that means. And the artist must have felt something of this kind too, for the circle did not turn, as circles will, but sailed steadfast in its white skies, with its patient breach for ever below. So Watt put it back on its hook, in the position in which he had found it.</page></plain_text>
