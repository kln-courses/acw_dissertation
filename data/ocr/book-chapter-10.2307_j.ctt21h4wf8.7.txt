While he provided substantiations for a large  number of claims, many of his arguments were not incontrovertible.  one might say that some of these individuations resembled equations  with more than one valid solution, with maimonides arbitrarily choosing  among them. moreover, even when he used these individuation  strategies to maximize the number of commandments, his total  remained short. maimonides had to find more commandment claims  if he wanted to buttress R. simlai’s dictum. The way to accomplish this  was with innovative claims, positing commandments that Qayyara had  neither listed on his list of qum ‘aseh nor on his list of parashiyyot. Before we begin our analysis, I offer a word of caution. Qayyara’s  list is inconveniently terse, often vague, lacking in punctuation, and  formatted differently than maimonides’ list. No definitive comparison  between the two is possible. What we read as a maimonidean  innovation might indeed have been referenced by Qayyara, either as its  own commandment or subsumed under a different rubric.1 While this  difficulty should not be ignored, scholars have come to a consensus on  how to interpret Qayyara’s list, developed through years of identifying  1 . A good example is Qayyara’s entry “faith” (pq39), discussed in the second part of  this chapter: does he use the term to mean belief in God or to mean acting in good  faith in business? or Qayyara’s entry “to cheer a bride” (pq149): does it refer to the  rabbinic commandment to gladden a bride on her wedding day (perhaps supported  by a derashah, as Traub suggests; see Hildesheimer, Haqdamat Sefer Halakhot Gedolot,  86n387), or to the scriptural commandment to give happiness to a new wife for a full  year? see my discussion of these ideas in chapter 9. many similar examples exist. — 97 — </page> <page sequence="2"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- entries and reconciling lists of azharot. Building on the work of  generations of scholars, Hildesheimer tabulates 37 innovations in  maimonides’ list of positive commandments, commandments that do  not appear as part of Qayyara’s list or on other canonical enumerations.2  In this chapter, I first examine some of these 37 innovations, assess  the arguments in their favor, and explore other factors that may have  led maimonides to posit these claims. The discussion of innovations  leads directly into a discussion of maimonides’ greatest innovation, the  introduction of dogma into halakhah. I show the critical role that R.  simlai’s aggadah and R. Hamnuna’s exegesis play in this new theology.  This analysis will help the reader gain a more nuanced appreciation of  the TaRYaG project. In the second part of the chapter, I examine two  additional innovative claims, assessing maimonides’ arguments in their  favor and exploring their extraordinary theological significance.  I preface this endeavor by quoting an insightful observation made  by one of the most erudite and astute commentators on enumerations,  yeruham perla. In the introduction to his monumental work on  sa‘adiah’s Book of Commandments, perla raises an obvious question:  given that a pious Jew is obligated to keep all commandments, both  scriptural and rabbinic, why did the early rabbis (the rishonim) spend  so much time analyzing the list of 613 commandments? Why does  tradition restrict the number of commandments to 613, subordinating  individual details under larger commandments and relegating other  obligations to rabbinic status? What juridical motivations can exist for  restricting the count to this precise number? He answers:  These questions come from a basic lack of understanding, for it is clear  that this enumeration has an important bearing on many of the scriptural  commandments, according to the various views. In fact, it is clear that  2 . Hildesheimer, Haqdamat Sefer Halakhot Gedolot, “Introduction,” in particular 37-41.  The number of innovations identified by Hildesheimer should be viewed as a minimal  estimate. All major commentators agree that there are 37 innovative commandments;  thus, I have used it as the focus of my analysis. However, given the commentators’  strong propensity to harmonize the lists and their highly imaginative skills, a  simple reading of Qayyara’s entries would likely produce a much higher estimate.  my own imprecise estimate yields a number of innovations slightly in excess of 70  commandments, about twice as many as found by Hildesheimer.  — 98 — </page> <page sequence="3"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- there is no explicit evidence in scripture — or even in the Mekhilta, Sifra,  Sifre, Talmud and other such sources — for many of the positive and  negative commandments enumerated by the various scholars. These  commandments depend on the methodological underpinnings on which  these enumerations were constructed. For it is clear that if, for example,  following his Rules, maimonides eliminated from Qayyara’s count many  positive and negative commandments that ought not to be included ...  by necessity he must search for other commandments that respond to  his criteria so as to be able to complete the count of 613 commandments.  And it is quite possible that he [maimonides] would not be able to  draw support from among rabbinic sources for this large number of  commandments, positive and negative, that would be consistent with  his own Rules. Therefore, relying on the fundament that the scriptural  commandments cannot total less than 613, he [maimonides] added  such commandments from his own opinion, based on some tenuous allusions  contained in the scriptural text, coupled with his own interpretation, even  though the evidence is not sufficiently compelling� Were it not for the fact  that the number [TaRYaG] is fixed and known, he [maimonides] would  not have innovated these commandments. (emphasis added)3  perla suggests that because the rabbinic tradition so prized the  importance of 613 commandments, jurists — maimonides among  them — had a special impetus to find commandments in the scriptural  text that were not obvious to the casual reader. It is this creativity that  is at the heart of the TaRYaG project for maimonides and his fellow  enumerators. As perla maintains, maimonides’ innovations are most  original and interesting when he presents claims “based on some tenuous  allusions in the scriptural text and coupled with his own reasoning.” I  add one qualification to perla’s thesis: maimonides’ philosophical views,  both theoretical and politico-ethical, inform his individuations. He  premises his analyses on the assumption that the Torah is a teaching  guide whose purpose is to instill in Jews correct and necessary beliefs.  maimonides’ politico-philosophical views are encapsulated in  GP III:27. There he suggests that the true law, the “law of moses,” has  two aims: the welfare of the body as a first aim; and the “indubitably  greater in nobility” welfare of the soul, achievable only after reaching  3 . perla, Sefer ha-Mitsvot le-RaSaG, “Introduction,” sec. 10, 56. — 99 — </page> <page sequence="4"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- the first aim. The welfare of the body consists of “being healthy and  in the very best bodily state,” achieved by satisfying one’s needs for  food, shelter, and other similar needs. But because people are social  animals, they tend to satisfy their needs through political association.  Therefore, the law aims to enable “the governance of the city and the  well-being of the states of all its people according to their capacity,” and  it accomplishes this “through the abolition of reciprocal wrongdoing  and through the acquisition of a noble and excellent character.” The  law’s ultimate aim is to perfect man’s soul through the empirical  research and metaphysical speculation that enable sound beliefs and  correct opinions. such beliefs and opinions, maimonides tells us, lead  to eternal life.  According to this scheme, all the commandments of the Torah can  be classified according to one of three categories: practical, moral, or  intellectual commandments. The former two categories operate on the  welfare of the body, while the latter operates on the welfare of the soul.  This scheme leads Twersky to say: Given these guidelines, established at the beginning of this section  in chapter 27 of the Moreh [the GP], the remaining task is completely  deductive. one has to relate each of the 613 commandments to one of the  three goals: (a) establishment of civilized society — principles of social  utility and justice; (b) development of the ethical personality — principles  of goodness and love of fellow man; or (c) intellectual perfection — true  knowledge and experience of God. Had the remaining chapters of the  Moreh been lost, we could have undertaken to reconstruct the correlation  between each commandment and these three goals.4  As we review some of maimonides’ innovative claims, particularly  those not supported by conclusive rabbinic warrants, we note that his  deductive process does not always work in the direction that Twersky  posits. As Warren Zev Harvey writes:  What is not explicit in Twersky’s analysis is the extent to which  maimonides’ legal teleology is prescriptive [Harvey’s italics]. Are  maimonides’ teleological explanations of the commandments merely  4 . Twersky, Introduction to the Code of Maimonides, 388. — 100 — </page> <page sequence="5"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- descriptive of how he understood the received law, or is it possible to  detect in the Mishneh Torah an ongoing effort by maimonides to decide  the law in such a manner as to bring (or keep) it in line with the teloi of  peace and knowledge? 5  my analysis leads me to believe that the latter pattern is frequently  true. maimonides formulates some of his commandments based on his  underlying goals — and only then finds an appropriate supporting text.  While he does not state it explicitly, perla implies that this is often  maimonides’ approach.  EXAmINING THE EVIdENCE To identify the most original of maimonides’ contributions, I exclude  from my analysis all those claims for which maimonides provides strong  evidentiary support. I contend that the remaining commandments,  supported by inconclusive evidence, are at least partly driven by his  philosophical goals.  Before I begin my analysis, I mention again the work of moritz peritz,  discussed in some depth in chapter 2. peritz was unusually sensitive  to maimonides’ use of rabbinic language and evidentiary claims,  particularly to the types of rabbinic expressions on which maimonides  relies. He highlights terms such as mitsvat ‘aseh, metsuveh, mitsvah,  ‘over ‘al, hovah, de-oraita, and ‘al korho as examples of tannaitic language  that maimonides appropriates for his arguments. Indeed, many of the  inferences that I will draw in this chapter were first noted by peritz.6 sTRoNG EVIdENCE This category includes those innovative claims supported by strong  rabbinic proofs for their positive commandments. For the most part,  these warrants, taken mainly from the midreshe halakhah, describe  5 . Harvey, Review of Introduction to the Code of Maimonides, 200-203. 6 . peritz’s work can be found in Bacher, “Zum sprachlichen Charakter des mischne  Thora,” 439-474. see in particular 455-59. see chapter 2 of this book for a more  detailed explication of his linguistic theories. — 101 — </page> <page sequence="6"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- a particular scriptural passage as a mitsvat ‘aseh. A word of caution:  maimonides understands these midrashim to be designating the  commandments as scriptural, even though the midrash may not be  applying maimonidean criteria for designating positive commandments.  That is, the midrash halakhah might sometimes use the phrase mitsvat  ‘aseh to define a command as obligatory without intending to count it  as an enumerated commandment. For example, the obligation referred  to as an ‘aseh may only be a detail or condition (mishpat, in the language  of Rule 7) of a larger, overarching, commandment. In such a case, it  would not qualify as an independent and individuated claim according  to the guidelines of Rules 7 and 10-13. For the purposes of our analysis,  I assume that maimonides has used his Rules to test the evidence and  has only enumerated those commandments that passed the required  criteria. Although the linguistic markers are given prominence, it is  maimonides’ considered judgment, through the prism of his Rules,  which enables these commandments to be enumerated.  I list briefly some of the innovations supported by key linguistic  markers, providing in parentheses the specific term used:  p22. To watch over this edifice [bayit, holy house] continually (be-‘aseh);  p84. To offer all sacrifices in the sanctuary (be-‘aseh);7  p87. That an exchanged beast [ha-temurah] is [or becomes] sacred  (‘aseh);  p90. To burn meat of the holy [sacrifice] that has become unclean  (‘aseh);  p142. To exact the debt of an alien (zo mitsvat ‘aseh);  p146. To slay, according to the ritual, cattle, deer, and fowl, and then  their flesh may be eaten (nitstaveh);  p198. To lend to an alien with interest (zo mitsvat ‘aseh).  As we can see, this list contains commandment claims supported by  derivatives of the term mitsvat ‘aseh.  With respect to p142 and p198, the midrash halakhah’s understanding  that these are obligations is unique and highly controversial. The  7 . For a lengthier discussion of this commandment, see maimonides’ remarks at N89,  where the counterpart negative commandment is discussed. — 102 — </page> <page sequence="7"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- simple meaning of the biblical verses is that while one is permitted to  exact the debt of an alien and charge an alien interest, these actions  are not specifically commanded: rather, the verses specify that one is  prohibited from doing thus to an Israelite. Commentators have also  pointed out that the Talmud supports the simple interpretation, and  that the interpretation of the midrash halakhah should be subordinated  to that of the Talmud.8 maimonides’ use of midrash is highly selective  and appears to respond to his strong concerns regarding contact with  idolatrous people and practices. Restricting business dealings with  pagans can prevent their potential integration into Jewish society.9  maimonides also used other terms in his evidentiary work. The  next two innovations use the terms be’al korho, “against his will,”  implying that one must do an action even when one does not want to,  and hayav, “obligated to”: p23. That the levite shall serve in the sanctuary (be’al korho);  p32. To show honor to a descendant of Aaron, and to give him precedence  in all things that are holy (be’al korho); p85. To take trouble to bring sacrifices to the sanctuary from places  outside the land of Israel (hayav)�  on a number of occasions, maimonides made novel commandment  claims based on explicit scriptural verses without invoking a supporting  rabbinic warrant. This is the case with: p175. To render the decision according to the majority, when there is a  difference of opinion among the members of the Sanhedrin as to matters  of law. This commandment is based on the verse “to incline after many”  (Exod. 23:2) (despite its being a syntactically awkward clause);  p179: To examine witnesses thoroughly. This commandment is  based on the verse, “Then shalt thou enquire and make search and  ask intelligently” (deut. 13:15), found in a jurisprudential context. 8 . Regarding p142, see di Tolosa, “maggid mishneh” (in standard editions of the  MT), Hilkhot Malveh ve-Loveh 1:2, reflecting the opinion of post-maimonidean  commentators. With regard to p198, see Nahmanides, Hasagot to Rule 6; and RaBad  in his gloss to the SE. 9 . Also see p187, where he says that the aim of destroying the seven Nations is “to  safeguard us from imitating their apostasy.” — 103 — </page> <page sequence="8"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- It is highly unlikely that any jurist preceding maimonides disagreed  with his contention that these two commandments are biblically  commanded.10 more likely, those who did not enumerate them did  not see them as thematically independent laws, laws that needed to  be individuated.11 Earlier enumerators (such as Qayyara) may have  subsumed these commandments under more general rubrics, such  as parashah 1, which includes court law and criminal and monetary  laws. Indeed, maimonides’ special individuation of these two  laws calls for an explanation. I submit that maimonides may have  wanted to exhibit worthy examples of procedural concerns found  in the Torah.12 A complementary explanation is that these two laws  could function as intermediate sub-headings in the long exposition on  the laws of courts and witnesses, included to aid his avowed goal of  drafting a useful working outline. Another novel commandment claim based on a scriptural verse  and lacking a rabbinic warrant is p30, which states that the priests  are to lift off (le-harim)13 some of the ashes from the altar.14 The removal  of ashes from the altar is neither an integral part of the sacrificial  ritual nor a provision of it. It represents an independent cultic service,  or as the rabbis would call it, the “removal [from the altar] service”  (‘avodat siluq). The “removal service” sits a notch below the “offering  [unto the altar] service” (‘avodat matanah) in importance, a distinction  that carries legal consequences.15 While the commandment is clearly  biblically obligated, its individuation is somewhat more problematic.  10 . For example, they appear as ps96 and ps97 in sa‘adiah’s list of commandments. perla,  Sefer ha-Mitsvot, vol. 1, 648-662. 11 . maimonides could also have subsumed the command to follow majority opinion under  “In righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor” (p177). This is suggested by duran,  Zohar ha-Raqia, siman 52, 60. 12 . In my article, “Cross Cultural Influences and the possible Role of Competition in the  selection of some Commandments,” 410-414, I discuss the individuation of p175,  p178, and p179, suggesting that maimonides may have wanted to show his muslim  colleagues that, just like muslim jurisprudence, the Torah prioritized matters related  to procedural law. 13 . Hyamson’s translation gives a correct interpretation of the literal text. 14 . In the ShM, the commandment is stated (less precisely) as “to remove the ashes daily  from the altar.” see perla, Sefer ha-Mitsvot le-RaSaG, vol. 1, 757. 15 . For more on this distinction see BT Yoma 23b; Hilkhot Biat ha-Miqdash 9:8. — 104 — </page> <page sequence="9"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- maimonides could well have subsumed this activity under the general  heading of ma‘arakhah (lit. layout, array),16 a category which could have  included feeding a fire on the altar and maintaining a perpetual fire  (p29), based on leviticus 6:1-6. His outline requirement, however,  may have necessitated a somewhat more specific claim. Alternatively,  perhaps he considered the removal of ashes from the altar to be a truly  independent commandment, expressing a specific telos: decorum and  cleanliness in the service of the lord.17  p201 is a novel commandment, one deserving of mention  for two reasons. The claim states that the hired laborer shall be  permitted to eat (while he is on hire).18 maimonides begins by  referencing M Bava Metsi‘a 7:2 to demonstrate the scriptural right  of a harvesting worker to eat from the produce. The mishnah states:  “These may eat [of the fruits among which they labor] by virtue of what  is enjoined in the law [min ha-torah]: he that labors on what is still  growing after the work is finished.”  Note that the commandment merely confers on the laborer the  permission to eat while he is working. There is no obligation on the  part of the owner to feed the laborer, although we presume he has an  obligation to acquiesce to the demands of the laborer. In chapter 2, I  analyzed the various ways in which maimonides uses the term mitsvat  ‘aseh. In this instance, we see maimonides broaden the term mitsvat  ‘aseh to include rights. maimonides might not have individuated such  law as a commandment if not for his outline in progress; this right  represents a necessary rubric in his comprehensive outline. laborers’  rights while performing farming services are quite complex and  detailed, covering all of chapter 12 of Hilkhot Sekhirut, 14 halakhot  in all. The advancement of this claim appears therefore to stem from  16 . Qayyara, parashah 9 (found only in the oxford manuscript). 17 . Note that in the Halakhot, which does not normally give explanations of a non-halakhic  nature, maimonides uses this type of reasoning to justify the priest’s changing his  special clothes in order to remove the ashes, noting that “it is not proper [derekh erets]  that he [the priest] should pour wine for his master in the same clothes in which he  cooked his food.” Hilkhot Temidin u-Musafin 2:10, quoting a baraita attributed to R.  Ishmael, BT Yoma 23b.  18 . I have followed a more literal translation of the Hebrew text. Hyamson has “of the  produce which he is reaping.”  — 105 — </page> <page sequence="10"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- maimonides’ goal of producing a useful outline rather than from any  inner logic justifying it.  I would also like to note that the laborers’ right to eat is  reformulated in the Halakhot while given a different telos. I will return  to this discussion in chapter 9.  The aforementioned innovations all share the common feature of  formal evidentiary support. maimonides proves his claims adducing  rabbinic warrants and/or relatively straightforward scriptural proof  texts. The next group of enumerated commandments, all formulated as  obligations, are either presented without formal evidence or presented  with unconvincing evidence.  I organize the rest of this section by commandment, each followed  by a very brief comment summing up maimonides’ proof(s). Here and  throughout the rest of this work, I quote the positive commandments  as they are formulated in the short Enumeration (SE).  p34. That, when the ark is carried, it should be carried on the shoulder, as  it is said, “They shall bear it upon their shoulder” (Num. 7:9). While the nonspecific language of the SE does not identify who is to  carry the ark, the ShM clearly identifies the command’s subject: “the  priests are to bear the ark upon their shoulders” (emphasis added). The  SE’s ambiguity resurfaces in the tenor and formulation of the Halakhot  (Hilkhot Kele ha-Miqdash 2:12), which omits the subject of the command.19  proof: The proof text for this claim is the verse: “But unto the  sons of Kehat he gave none [of the wagons and animals], because the  service of holy things belonged unto them: they bore them upon their  shoulders” (Num. 7:9). Note the lack of evidence of a direct or mediated  command to the sons of Kehat20 to carry the ark on their shoulders. The  biblical text recounts that they did so without detailing a reason.  To prove that carrying the ark was a divine command, maimonides  quotes two passages from the Hagiographa (Ketuvim). The first refers to  19 . This may be an indication that the ShM preceded the SE chronologically, and that  maimonides changed his interpretation of this commandment between these two  works. see note 53 in this chapter and note 40 in chapter 9.  20 . The priests were descendants of Kehat. — 106 — </page> <page sequence="11"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- david’s commanding the priests and the levites to bring up the ark for  the second time. Chronicles records: “And the children of the levites [here  referring to the priests] bore the ark of God on their shoulders with the  bars thereon as moses commanded according to the word of the lord” (1  Chr. 15:15). The second passage discusses the division of the priests into  twenty-four groups: “These were the orderings of them in their service,  to come into the house of the lord according to the ordinance given unto  them by the hand of Aaron, their father, as the lord, the God of Israel, had  commanded him” (1 Chr. 24:19). on this passage, maimonides comments:  The sages explain this verse as implying that it is the task of the priests  to perform the service of bearing the ark upon their shoulders, and that  this is what the lord, the God of Israel commanded.  The sifre says: According to the ordinance unto them ... as the lord, the  God of Israel, had commanded him: where did He so command him? [In  the verse,] But unto the sons of Kohat he gave none, because the service of holy  things belonged unto them: they bore them upon their shoulders [Numbers  7:9]. (Sifre Numbers 46 (51-52)) The last line of the previous section of Sifre Numbers 45 (52), which  maimonides did not quote, explains: “Thus the levites did not  innovate at all: everything was commanded by moses, and moses was  commanded by the Almighty [God].” This bit of inter-textual citation  is maimonides’ putative evidence that the priests were commanded to  carry the ark on their shoulders when it had to be moved.  p86. To redeem cattle, set apart for sacrifices, that contracted  disqualifying blemishes, after which they may be eaten by anyone, as  it is said, “Nevertheless thou mayest kill (and eat flesh in all thy gates)  whatever thy soul lusteth after” (deut. 12:15). By tradition it is learned  that this verse refers only to sanctified animals, and teaches us that  they ought to be redeemed if and when they become unfit.21  proof: The tradition to which maimonides refers can be found in Sifre  Deuteronomy 71 (134). He is the only enumerator to name an obligation  21 . Chavel: “items that must be redeemed” for she-yipadu is interpretative. — 107 — </page> <page sequence="12"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- to redeem a blemished animal reserved for sacrifice, selectively using  sources to support his point. other commentators maintain that  redemption is voluntary and find other talmudic sources to support  this view.22 Note that even the midrash quoted by maimonides does  not necessarily obligate one to redeem the unfit animal; it merely states  that it should be redeemed, presumably so that one can eat it.  p157. To discourse concerning the departure from Egypt on the first  night of the Feast of passover, as it is said, “And thou shalt tell thy son  on that day, saying . . .” (Exod. 13:8). proof: maimonides brings two proofs, first citing a well-known rabbinic  saying (found in the passover Haggadah): “Even if we were all of us  wise, all of us men of understanding, all of us learned in the law, it is  a mitsvah to speak of the departure from Egypt.” on closer look, this is  not a particularly persuasive proof for the obligation to recount those  events, since mitsvah in rabbinic terminology can represent a good deed  or a rabbinic obligation, as we saw in chapter 2.  The second proof is drawn from an exposition found in the Mekhilta  de-RaSHBY on Exodus 13:3:  since it is said, And it shall be when thy son asketh thee, etc., one might  think [yakhol] that you are to tell your son if he asks you, but not  otherwise. scripture therefore says [talmud lomar], thou shalt tell thy  son — even though he does not ask you. Again, one might think that [the  duty rests only on one] who has a son [with him]; whence do we infer  that it applies also to one who is alone, or among strangers? From the  words of scripture: Moses said unto the people: Remember [zakhor] this day  [Exod. 13:3].  22 . see di Boton, Lehem Mishneh (in standard editions of the MT), Hilkhot Isure Mizbeah  1:10. A review of talmudic sources leads perla (Sefer ha-Mitsvot le-RaSaG, vol. 1, 758- 760) to conclude that the redemption of blemished animals is strictly voluntary  (reshut). In contrast, Hurewitz, Sefer ha-Mitsvot im Perush Yad ha-Levi, ad loc., finds  sufficient evidence to declare this verse an unconditional obligation. For maimonides’  apparent prioritization of midreshe halakhah over Talmud, see Sefer ha-Mitsvot, ed.  Heller, N72, n. 19. I concede that it is possible to read the ShM as saying that one must  redeem the animal if and when one wants to eat it, in effect a contingent obligation.  — 108 — </page> <page sequence="13"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- The midrash likely means that apart from the specific obligation to  teach one’s child about the exodus (Exod. 13:3), moses also instructs  all Israelites to remember the exodus, irrespective of the presence of  children. maimonides then adds his own23 crucial explanation: “That  is, moses told the people that God commanded us to remember the  exodus just as he ordained Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.”  since the remembrance of sabbath is a positive commandment (p155),  by analogy, this exhortation is one as well.24 The analogy stretches the  midrash well beyond its simple meaning.  It may be more plausible to consider that maimonides turned the  re-telling of the exodus into an obligation rather than simply into a  recommendation because he thought that a belief in miracles was a  necessary opinion.25 The account of the miracles that God performed for  the Israelites proves to the faithful that God is a volitional, interacting  deity, a foundational concept in Judaism. The memory of these miracles  must be perpetuated through constant repetition because, over the  course of time, miracles can easily be rationalized away.26  p172. To heed the call of every prophet in each generation, provided  that he neither adds to nor takes away from the Torah, as it is said,  “unto him ye shall hearken” (deut. 18:15). proof: maimonides resorts to a midrash that uniquely inteprets the  verse “unto him ye shall hearken” (deut. 18:15): “Even if he tells you  to violate temporarily one of the commandments enjoined in the  Torah, you must hearken unto him.”27 This commandment includes  two prohibitions: that a prophet may not disobey his own prophecy  23 . It does not appear in our text of the Mekhilta; this addition is maimonides’ own. so  shem Tov ibn Gaon (Migdal oz) understands it. see also Kasher, Ha-RaMBaM ve-ha- Mekhilta de-RaSHBY, 61. 24 . That maimonides is satisfied with this exegesis is apparent from his repeating it in the  Halakhot, Hilkhot Hamets u-Matsah, 7:1. 25 . Cf. GP III:43, 572. on the connections between miracles, a willing deity, and religion,  see “Iggeret Tehiyat ha-metim” in Iggerot ha-Rambam, ed. shailat, 356-357 and 367.  26 . see GP III:50, 615-16: “all miracles are certain in the opinion of one who has seen them;  however, at a future time their story becomes a mere traditional narrative, and there is  a possibility for the hearer to consider it untrue.” Also see the end of that long passage. 27 .

The Talmud  (BT Sanhedrin 89a) derives these various prohibitions from the verse:  “Whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in  my name, I will require it of him” (deut. 18:19). maimonides notes  that, according to the Talmud, the scriptural verse indicates that  transgressors will receive divine punishment. No special linguistic marker, similar to the ones we had seen  earlier, backs up the claim that we are in the presence of a mitsvat ‘aseh.  Furthermore, it is unclear why this claim should be designated a positive  commandment rather than a prohibition (i.e. negative commandment)  against ignoring the prophet’s words. In fact, as maimonides notes at  the end of his explication, “transgressors will be punished” — which  implies that this is a negative rather than a positive commandment.28  maimonides could have based a similar claim on an explicit  prohibition, “be no more stiffnecked” (deut. 10:16) as sa‘adiah  did,29 making this a negative rather than a positive commandment.  I suspect, however, that maimonides needed the Sifre’s explication  of deuteronomy 18:15 to support his highly original exposition of  the fundaments of prophecy presented in his “Introduction to the  mishnah” and in Hilkhot Yesode ha-Torah (chapters 7-10). He makes a  brief reference to these principles of prophecy in the explication of the  commandment in the ShM, when he states that the commandment is  to hearken to any genuine prophet [lit., prophet from among the prophets]  and to do whatever he bids, even if it be contrary to one or more of the  [scriptural] commandments, provided that it is only temporary, and does  not involve a permanent addition to or subtraction from [the law], as we  have explained in the Introduction to the mishnah.  28 . In Hilkhot Sanhedrin 19:3, when discussing the punishment applicable to transgressors  of this injunction, maimonides suggests that “unto him ye shall hearken” is a positive  statement that yields an inferred prohibition (lav ha-ba-mikhlal ‘aseh). As we saw, this  principle allows the court to treat the inferred prohibition more leniently (i.e. no  lashes as punishment) than if it were couched as an outright prohibition. In chapter 2,  I call these positive statements mitsvot ‘aseh in form rather than in substance because  they legislate a prohibition rather than a positive act. Though maimonides does not  mention this hermeneutic in his gloss in the ShM, it is not impossible that he had it  in mind here. see the further discussion of this commandment in chapter 9. 29 . perla, Sefer ha-Mitsvot le-RaSaG, vol. 2, Ns 49, 97. — 110 — </page> <page sequence="15"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- maimonides grounds his discussion of prophecy in the “Introduction  to the mishnah” on deuteronomy 18:15-19 and on the Sifre’s  interpretations of that passage. I conjecture that because of their  fundamental importance, maimonides deigned to craft a commandment  out of this verse, despite the hermeneutic difficulty.30 p178. That one who possesses evidence shall testify in Court, as it is  said, “and if one is a witness, and hath seen or known [if he do not  tell, then he shall bear his iniquity]” (lev. 5:1). proof: scripture proclaims that anyone who withholds evidence will  suffer serious consequences: “And if any one sin, in that he heareth  the voice of adjuration, he being a witness, whether he hath seen or  known, if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity” (lev. 5:1).  The verse does not literally enjoin witnesses to present evidence, but  rather admonishes and threatens witnesses for withholding evidence.  Effectively, this appears to be an admonition rather than a precept — a  negative rather than a positive commandment. maimonides confirms  this understanding in a little-noticed statement contained in his  explications to N297, the prohibition against neglecting to save an  Israelite in danger of losing his life and/or his money. After stating  that “[t]he sages say31 that this prohibition covers also the case of  one who withholds evidence,” he adds, “scripture again refers to this  matter: if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity [lev. 5:1].”  In other words, at N297, maimonides construes leviticus 5:1 as  conveying an admonition, a negative commandment, rather than a  positive commandment.  30 . maimonides’ enumeration here follows several other enumerator-jurists, although  Qayyara is not among them. Although sa’adiah lists this precept in his decalogue- based azharot (under the third utterance), describing it as “my inheritance listens to  the words of the prophet of God,” he omits it in the Sefer ha-Mitsvot. perla does a  reasonable job explaining the omission (perla, Sefer ha-Mitsvot le-RaSaG, vol. 2, Ns49,  97-99). Hefets b. yatsliah also lists this precept: “It is our duty to listen to the words  of the prophet” (ninth utterance). see Zucker, “mi-sefer ha-mitsvot shel Hefets b.  yatsliah,” 34. In note 21, Zucker points out that both sa‘adiah, in his Arabic Sefer ha- Mitsvot, and samuel b. Hofni counted this obligation.  31 . maimonides is referring to Sifra Qedoshim 4:8 (89a), on leviticus 19:16, which he  quotes later. — 111 — </page> <page sequence="16"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Commentators have struggled to read some type of affirmative  injunction into the text. david b. Zimra (RadBaZ) suggests that we  ought to read the verse by adding the active verb “must tell” after  “whether he hath seen or known.” 32 RadBaZ’s solution is self-serving:  he supplies a non-existent verb to support the claim that this is a  positive statement. While this type of solution is sometimes offered in  cases where a clear rabbinic tradition supports such a reading, we have  no such tradition here.33 Equally unsatisfactory is duran’s solution,  which conjures a syntactically impossible imperative, interpreting “he  being witness” to mean that he is obligated to be a witness.34 Nor does  maimonides cite a rabbinic warrant in support of this claim.  In the ShM, maimonides states, “sages adduce as proof of this  obligation to give testimony” the leviticus proof text; however, he fails  to cite the rabbinic source.35 In sum, there is no evidence of a positive  commandment urging one to offer testimony, neither in scripture nor  in rabbinic literature. As maimonides comments at N297, the verse “if  32 . RadBaZ’s commentary to Hilkhot ‘Edut, 1:1, s.v. “ha-ed metsuveh�” 33 . The best examples are the ones in which maimonides cites tradition in his reading  of the verse. These are introduced by the formula “tradition taught” (lamdu mi-pi  ha-shemu’ah), as in p85, p86, p109, p128, and others. Indeed, these interpretations  involve contextual rather than textual manipulation — giving a novel meaning to the  verse by providing a new context. Where some textual manipulation is required, where  words and/or sentences do not appear to bear a clear meaning, maimonides can cite a  number of traditions to support the difficult reading, as he does in N194, for example. 34 . duran, Zohar ha-Raqia, siman 53, 61. see also perla, Sefer ha-Mitsvot le-RaSaG, vol. 1,  ps 31-32, 368a.  35 . The Kesef Mishneh commentary on Hilkhot ‘Edut 1:1 points to BT Bava Qamma 56a,  but that talmudic passage does not support the existence of an obligation to provide  testimony. Instead, the passage warrants that the verse, which promises an unspecified  retribution, concerns the case of two witnesses who withhold evidence, while R. Joshua  maintains that even one witness who withholds evidence incurs heavenly disfavor. While  there is a scripturally commanded punishment for withholding evidence, where is the  command to bring the evidence? Bothered by this lack of direct evidence, yosef b. Habiba,  in the beginning of his Nimuqe Yosef commentary to the sixth chapter of BT Bava Qamma,  asserts that the obligation to testify is only a supererogatory act (gemilat hesed). other  commentators find their source in M Sanhedrin 4:5. The mishnah has the witnesses  complain about having to testify under strain and admonishments: “And if perchance  ye would say: Why should we be at these pains? Was it not once written ‘and he being  a witness, whether he hath seen or known, if he do not utter it, etc.’?” Implicit is the  obligation to provide testimony, although one could read the retort as articulating the  gravity of the sin of withholding testimony, rather than implying a positive commandment.  — 112 — </page> <page sequence="17"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity” is only a special case  of the overall prohibition against standing by while an Israelite is in  danger of losing his life or his money. This commandment, nonetheless, can be seen as serving as a pillar  of an effective judicial system. This could explain maimonides’ desire to  craft a positive commandment out of the verse “if he do not utter it, then  he shall bear his iniquity” — despite scant scriptural or rabbinic evidence.36  p187. To exterminate the seven Canaanite nations from the land of  Israel, as it is said, “But thou shalt utterly destroy them” (deut. 20:17). proof: maimonides provides no direct rabbinic warrant in support of  his claim, which he refers to as “an obligatory war” (milhemet mitsvah).37  At the start of his discussion, he identifies the obvious problem: these  nations no longer exist. While one might think that this commandment  is no longer binding (and thus not a positive commandment, as per Rule  3), maimonides writes that such an idea “will be entertained only by one  who has not grasped the distinction between commandments that are  binding for all time and those that are not.” After acknowledging that “no  trace of [the nations] remains,” he notes that “it does not follow that the  commandment to exterminate them is not binding for all time, just as  we cannot say that the war against ‘Amaleq is not binding for all time,  even after they have been consumed and destroyed.”38 The core of his  36 . For a possible motivation, see Friedberg, “Cross-Cultural Influences and the possible  Role of Competition in the selection of some Commandments.”  37 . According to BT Sotah 44b, the sages and R. Judah agree that the category of obligatory  wars includes the conquest wars against the seven nations, the war against the  ‘Amaleqites, and all defensive wars, though the sages term an obligatory war milhemet  mitsvah while R. Judah calls such a war milhemet hovah. (maimonides follows the  opinion of the sages and calls such a war milhemet mitsvah.) From the fact that tannaim  disagree about these categories, one can suppose that these categories specify active  laws and commandments rather than historical events that only hold an antiquarian  interest — thus maimonides’ warrant for the existence of a commandment to destroy  the seven Canaanite nation. Nevertheless, it should be noted that maimonides could  have retained the concept of milhemet mitsvah and applied it only to “a war to deliver  Israel from the enemy attacking it,” as he does in Hilkhot Melakhim 5:1, without having  to mention ‘Amaleq and the seven nations.  38 . The proof from the analogy to ‘Amaleq (p188) is circular, for one may well question the  validity of that claim since it seems that ‘Amaleq, too, has perished and disappeared. — 113 — </page> <page sequence="18"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- argument is that “no special condition of time and place is attached to  this commandment, as is the case with those commandments specially  designed for the desert or for Egypt.” This fine distinction is difficult to  accept, since the biblical command to exterminate the seven Canaanite  nations also seems to apply to a historically circumscribed period, the  conquest and settlement of the land of Israel.39 Even if no “condition  of time and place” were attached to this commandment, maimonides  would still have to address daniel ha-Bavli’s objection that a precept is not  incumbent on later generations once the objective of the precept has been  realized.40  Regardless of whether this commandment should be counted, its  practical value seems to be negligible, as the seven nations have long  since lost their national identities. I believe that maimonides posits  this claim and defends it vigorously for didactic reasons. The opening  line of his explication betrays a key concern: these nations had to be  exterminated “because they constituted the root and very foundation  of idolatry ... the object was to safeguard us from imitating their  apostasy.” 41 maimonides sees scripture as enjoining Israel to battle  idolatry and heresy, not a specific people or ethnic group, a theme to  which he returns throughout his works.42 The abiding value of this  commandment lies in its theological message: all traces of idolatry  39 . This plain-sense reading of the text is defended by Tosafot. see BT ‘Avodah Zarah 20a,  s. v. “de-amar qera.” 40 . daniel ha-Bavli, she’elah 2, in Abraham maimonides, “Teshuvot Rabbenu Abraham ben  ha-RamBam,” 543. He gives the examples of “thou shalt set thee up great stones ... and  thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law” (deut. 27:2-3) and “thou shalt set  the blessing upon mount Gerizim and the curse upon mount Eval” (deut. 11:29).  41 . I note that in his practical code of law, the MT, maimonides sees no need to justify the  commandment. It suffices there to posit the ever-present possibility that one might be  able to fulfill this commandment. The underlying rationale for the commandment is  revealed only in the teleologically-driven ShM, where he posits that the commandment  is to destroy “the root and very foundation of idolatry.” To maimonides, this  commandment indeed functioned as an eternal obligation. 42 . Compare N48, for example, which forbids one from making a covenant with the seven  nations. In the ShM, maimonides ignores the ethnic divisions and writes: “We are forbidden  to make a covenant with the heretics and leave them undisturbed in their heresy.” see also  N51, N52, and N58, where the emphasis is on heresy rather than ethnicity. In other words,  making a peace treaty with the seven nations is a religious problem, not a racial one.  — 114 — </page> <page sequence="19"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- must be destroyed, lest they cause Israelites to apostatize.43  p189. To always keep in remembrance what ‘Amaleq did, as it is said,  “Remember what ‘Amaleq did unto thee” (deut. 25:17).  more specifically, he writes in the ShM:  We are commanded to remember what ‘Amaleq did to us in attacking us  unprovoked. We are to speak of this at all times, and to arouse the people  to make war upon him and bid the people to hate them, to the end that  this matter44 be not forgotten, and that hatred of him be not weakened  or lessened with the passage of time.  proof: The scriptural evidence for this obligation and the parallel  obligation not to forget ‘Amaleq’s deeds is found in deuteronomy  25:17-19: “Remember what ‘Amaleq did unto thee” (v. 17) and “thou  43 . stern (in “maimonides on ‘Amaleq”) reaches a similar conclusion with respect to ‘Amaleq  and the seven nations. In my opinion, however, he misreads an important passage in  the GP which leads to an unjustified claim regarding maimonides’ interpretation of the  Torah. on the basis of GP III:50, 614, stern claims that maimonides reads Gen. 36:12  as introducing a corrective to the obligation to exterminate ‘Amaleq (deut. 25:17):  because the descendants of Esau were “fully assimilated” with the children of seir, it  was “impossible ‘today’ to identify the real, authentic, pure ‘Amaleqites as opposed to  those who are ‘Amaleqites in name only” (364-365). He conjectures that maimonides  was attempting to restrain individuals living in his time from persecuting Christians  whom they identified as descendants of ‘Amaleq (369). This conclusion is speculative  and unwarranted if we read maimonides’ words in their proper context. He writes:  “Consequently, scripture explained their tribes [i.e., the tribes of Esau] and said that  those whom you see today in seir and the kingdom of ‘Amaleq are not all of them  children of ‘Amaleq, but some of them are descendants of this or that individual and are  only called after ‘Amaleq because the latter’s mother belonged to them.” To prove that  the corrective did not exempt the Israelites from the obligation to exterminate ‘Amaleq,  maimonides adds: “All this was an act of justice on the part of God lest a tribe be killed  indiscriminately in the course of the extermination of another tribe” (emphasis added).  maimonides states that scripture’s concern was to prevent errors in identification, not  to state that ‘Amaleq had been assimilated. Nowhere does maimonides say that it had  become “impossible” to identify ‘Amaleqites or that they had been “fully assimilated”  in biblical times. Indeed, the Israelites battled the descendants of ‘Amaleq a number of  times, both in the wilderness and in the time of saul. 44 . By “this matter” he means ‘Amaleq’s unprovoked attack. The MnT reads mitsvah instead  of davar, which can be interpreted as the commandment to destroy ‘Amaleq or as the  commandment to remember his misdeeds. — 115 — </page> <page sequence="20"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- shalt not forget” (v. 19). To prove that these statements are normative  and not mere rhetorical flourishes, maimonides quotes two similar  midreshe halakhah. The first is found in Sifre Deuteronomy: “Remember  what ‘Amaleq did unto thee means [remembrance] in the spoken word;  thou shalt not forget means [remembrance] in the heart,”45 to which  maimonides adds, “That is, you are to speak such things as will ensure  that the hatred of ‘Amaleq is not removed from men’s hearts.” The  second is found in the Sifra:46  Remember what ‘Amaleq did unto thee: one might think that this means  in thy heart. But thou shalt not forget refers to forgetfulness of the heart:  how then can one obey the injunction Remember [if that also refers to the  heart? We must conclude that Remember means:] in the spoken word.  While the cited midrashim do not label these verses as positive and  negative commandments (as the Sifre does, for example, when  commenting on a similarly-structured phrase in deuteronomy 22:847),  their analysis does buttress the idea that these verses represent formal  and distinct acts.48 maimonides draws further support from an incident  related in 1 samuel 15:1-33. Just before sending King saul on a mission  to slay ‘Amaleq, the prophet samuel formally recounts ‘Amaleq’s wicked  deeds, likely in order to fulfill the commandment to remember their  nefarious acts.49  A further difficulty remains. scripture’s call to recount ‘Amaleq’s  45 . Sifre Deuteronomy, Ki Tetse 296 (314). 46 . Sifra be-Huqotai 1:3 (110c). some printed versions incorrectly referenced it as the Sifre.  see Sefer ha-Mitsvot, ed. Heller, ad loc., n. 5. 47 . Sifre Deuteronomy, Ki Tetse 229 (261), states: “Thou shalt make a parapet for thy roof  [is] a positive commandment, that thou bring not blood upon thy house [is] a negative  commandment.” 48 . Nahmanides turns maimonides’ evidence against him by arguing that, on the basis of  this or similar midrashim, maimonides should have enumerated one or two additional  commands (Nahmanides, Hasagot, “Additions to the positive Commandments,” no. 7,  288). see also de leon, “megillat Esther,” 289. This is one of the rare instances in which  the maimonidean apologist de leon agrees with Nahmanides. 49 . so-called proofs adduced from non-pentateuchal books were commonplace among  Karaite jurists and exegetes, but rare among Rabbanites, who tended to rely on the  oral tradition for interpretation. see, for example, levi b. yafet, Sefer ha-Mitsvot,  passim� — 116 — </page> <page sequence="21"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- past misdeeds might only represent a motivation or justification for  the commandment to exterminate the nation, not an independent  commandment. or, going one step further, one might even understand  the exhortation to recollect ‘Amaleq’s evil deeds and intentions as merely  a required step in the act of killing an ‘Amaleqite. The passage from 1  samuel could be read as teaching that one must verbally announce the  justification for destroying ‘Amaleq just as one is about to execute a  member of their nation. Indeed, samuel’s actual words — “Thus said the  lord of Hosts: I am exacting [paqadeti] the penalty for what ‘Amaleq did  to Israel” (1 sam. 15:2, Jps translation) — read more like a justification  for the coming destruction than a daily recounting of ‘Amaleq’s evil.  As we have seen, under Rules 10, 11, and 12, any command that  forms part of another commandment or that is a preparation for  another commandment cannot be enumerated as an independent  commandment. If recalling ‘Amaleq’s evil deeds is a declaration that  one makes before destroying him, then remembering his deeds cannot  be considered an independent positive commandment.  maimonides avoids this problem in his definition of the obligation:  “to speak of this at all times, and to arouse the people to make war  upon him and bid the people to hate them, to the end that this matter  be not forgotten, and that hatred of him be not weakened or lessened with  the passage of time” (emphasis added). Accordingly, “Remember” is not  a declaration that one makes when one exterminates ‘Amaleq. Rather,  it is a daily reminder of ‘Amaleq’s viciousness, so that “this matter be  not forgotten, and that hatred of him be not weakened or lessened with  the passage of time.” Based on this definition, maimonides can posit an  independent commandment. But whence such an understanding? How  does maimonides know that the Sifre intended this commandment,  rather than a justificatory declaration?  Interestingly, neither Qayyara nor any of the other extant  enumerators who preceded maimonides include this commandment  on their TaRYaG lists.50 perhaps these enumerators saw these verses  50 . In discussing this passage, Abraham ibn Ezra ridicules the baale azharot, charging  that the enumerators are like those who count the number of blades of grass in their  books of medicine without recognizing the medicinal utility of these blades. shifting  — 117 — </page> <page sequence="22"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- as simple reminders of the obligation to destroy ‘Amaleq. maimonides  gleans from this verse and midrashim a totally novel concept: the duty  to remember and to remind others of those who have tried, unprovoked,  to destroy the Israelite nation, so as to keep hatred of them fresh in  the communal memory. This is a commandment independent of the  duty to exterminate ‘Amaleq. This new commandment can be fulfilled  unconditionally — precisely at a time when the commandment to  exterminate ‘Amaleq is practically impossible to fulfill. As maimonides  has already noted (in p187), by post-biblical times, ‘Amaleq could no  longer be identified.51 pRoBlEmATIC IdENTIFICATIoNs maimonides is at his most inventive when fashioning the next group of  obligations. In particular, the claims he advances do not seem to flow from  the scriptural texts that he brings in support. In many cases, I believe that  external criteria were involved in the selection of these commandments,  and I offer some possible suggestions for what those may be.  I will focus more on this difficulty in later chapters (chapter 7 in  particular), when I discuss maimonides’ scriptural hermeneutics.  For now, I ask the reader to accept as correct my assumption that  maimonides defined commandments by using the plain sense of the  text, rather than rabbinic exegetical understandings.  p17. That every person shall write a scroll of the Torah for himself, as it  to the singular, he then charges that “he thinks that they [“thou shalt not forget” and  “remember”] are two [commandments].” The shift to the singular suggests that he was  referring to one paytan in particular. After noting that there are many such mirrored  phrases in the Torah, Ibn Ezra concludes that these poets do not pay attention to the  plain sense of the text, preferring to focus on the formal structure of the verse. Abraham  ibn Ezra, Yesod Mora, 108. The paytan to which he refers remains unknown; I have not  found an extant geonic work that counts these two commandments separately. 51 . I do not understand why maimonides omits p189 from the list of sixty unconditionally  obligatory commandments (discussed in chapter 3), especially as he reconfirms its  obligatory status in Hilkhot Melakhim 5:5. While one could argue that p187 and p188  (to destroy the seven nations and the seed of ‘Amaleq), should not be enumerated  because their subjects have disappeared or can no longer be identified, the same  cannot be said with respect to p189. — 118 — </page> <page sequence="23"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- is said, “Write ye for yourselves this song” (deut. 31:19).52  proof: maimonides offers two textual analyses as proofs for this  commandment. The first is based on the verse “Write ye for yourselves  this song” (deut. 31:19). The simple meaning of the verse is that it  refers to the writing of the song of Ha‘azinu (deut. 32:1-43). yet in BT  Sanhedrin 21b (quoted below), Rabbah uses this verse as a proof text  for the individual’s obligation to write a scroll of the Torah, possibly  taking the word “song” as a metaphor for Torah. Not satisfied with this  homily, maimonides offers a rational but convoluted and hair-splitting  interpretation of Rabbah’s dictum: since one is not permitted to write  individual sections of the Torah,53 the instruction to moses to write  “this song” must have entailed the writing of an entire scroll of Torah.  The proof strains the imagination, and the reader might conclude that  Rabbah’s proof text is but a scriptural hook on which maimonides has  hung a well-known tradition.  The second demonstration comes from the same talmudic passage:  Rabbah said: Even if one’s parents had left him a scroll of the law, he  is nevertheless commanded to write one of his own, as it is said, Now  therefore write ye this song for you. Abaye objected: The king is commanded  to write a scroll of the law for himself, for he should not seek credit for  52 . In all of the versions of the ShM, this commandment appears as p18. The SE uses a  more logical arrangement, first listing the commandment for the individual to write a  scroll, and then the commandment for the king to write a second scroll, “besides the  one which every individual should write.” Being essentially an argumentative work, the  ShM may have listed the king’s obligation first because it helped maimonides to derive  the individual’s obligation. This may be further evidence that maimonides wrote the  ShM before writing the SE, a matter that I hope to explore in the future. see above, note  19. In his edition of the MT, Rabinovitch offers a similar explanation for the reversed  presentation in the ShM, arguing that maimonides proved the individual’s obligation  from the passage in BT Sanhedrin 21b, which itself is based on the law regarding the  king’s obligation (Mishneh Torah, ed. Rabinovitch, 112). To preserve the logical order of  his analysis, maimonides needed to address the obligation of the king before he could  address the obligation of the individual. While my argument is similar, I argue that the  only basis for the general commandment is the one found in the king’s pericope.  53 . Even granting the (questionable) scriptural force of this law, one could believe that  moses was given a special instruction to write just the song of Ha‘azinu, much as one  writes individual sections of the Torah in making tefillin. For this and other difficulties  in maimonides’ argument, see perla, Sefer ha-Mitsvot, vol. 3, sec. 60, 425-426. — 119 — </page> <page sequence="24"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- one written by others, and [this surely implies that] it is only a king [who  is enjoined to write a scroll even if his parents have left him one] and not  a commoner? To this the reply was: The rule is necessary only to oblige  the king to write two scrolls, as we have been taught: He [the king] shall  write him a copy of this law [mishneh ha-torah ha-zot] means that he is to  write for himself two copies. (BT Sanhedrin 21b) From this passage, maimonides infers that “the difference between  the king and a commoner is that every man must write one scroll of  the Torah, but the king must write two.” The simple meaning of the  phrase “mishneh ha-torah ha-zot” is “a copy of this Torah”: the king  is commanded to write himself a copy of the Torah that moses had  handed down.54 There is no good philological justification for reading  “mishneh ha-torah” as meaning two copies of the Torah; most likely, this  interpretation uses this scriptural intimation to support a rabbinic law.55 While maimonides’ proofs are unconvincing, his motivation for  advancing this commandment is not. The act of writing the Torah  inculcates a special reverence for its content and disseminates its  teachings. As maimonides writes in the GP, this commandment brings  about “useful opinions” — in this case, the wisdom learned from the  words of the law book itself.56 54 . see, for example, Tg. onqelos, ad loc. 55 . In chapter 7, I will expand on maimonides’ crucial distinction between the plain  sense of the text and the category of asmakhta, a term that generally covers scriptural  intimations, hints, and mnemonics that can underpin a rabbinic ordinance, and  explore the ways that he uses these categories to define his commandments.  56 . GP III:44. In listing there the commandments included in the ninth class of  commandments (the equivalent of those listed in Sefer Ahavah of the MT), maimonides  mentions “acquiring a book of the Torah and reading in it at certain times.” Two  observations are worth making in this respect. First, the commandment listed here  is to acquire a book of the Torah, rather than to write such a book, as he had ruled  in the MT. second, while one could argue that the mention of reading in the book  of the Torah could be counted as a separate commandment, wholly independent  of the acquisition of the book, this is unlikely, as we do not find in the MT such a  commandment. (Note that learning and teaching are included in Sefer ha-Madda‘.)  more likely, one should understand the sentence to mean that the acquisition of the  scroll of Torah is for the purpose of reading in it at certain times. Thus it would appear  that the acquisition is only a preparatory step. No such rationale is given in the MT,  where writing a scroll of Torah appears to be the primary consideration regardless of  what one does with it.

That the priests shall serve in the sanctuary, in watches [mishmarot],  but on festivals, they all serve together, as it is said, “And if a levite come  . . .[then he shall minister in the name of the lord]” (deut. 18:6-8). proof: In the ShM, maimonides quotes parts of a long passage  containing three verses:  And if a levite come [from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he  sojourneth,] and come with all the desire of his soul [unto the place  where the lord shall choose]; then he shall minister in the name of the  lord his God, as all his brethren the levites do, who stand there before  the lord. They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh  of the sale of his patrimony. (deut. 18:6-8) The Sifre expounds upon these verses: And come with all the desire of his soul: one might interpret this verse to  mean that he might come at any time to participate in the service of the  sanctuary; scripture therefore says from any of thy gates; that is, when all  Israel is assembled in one gate [i.e. in one city — Jerusalem] during the  three festivals.57  maimonides concludes from this interpretation that the visiting levites  had a right to participate equally with their Jerusalemite brethren at  the time of the festivals. The second part of this midrash is critical to his argument that the  watches (mishmarot) were instituted by scripture:  one might think that all the divisions [of priests] shared equally in  the festival offerings, even in these which were not occasioned by the  festivals themselves [namely, the daily burnt offerings brought in the  morning and at dusk every day of the year]; scripture therefore says  beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony� What is meant by sale  of patrimony? [one priestly elder says to another,] “do thou [minister] in  thy week, and I [will minister] in my week.”  read therein all the days of his life.”). At any rate, it is clear that, at least in its final  formulation, the utility of this commandment “is manifest.” 57 . Sifre Deuteronomy, Shoftim 168 (216-217). — 121 — </page> <page sequence="26"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- The midrash understands the words “sale of patrimony” to mean “do  thou [minister] in thy week, and I [will minister] in my week,” implying  that a rotation was in effect. As maimonides describes it: “they agreed  on the rotation of the watches; [the priests gave] their consent to the  whole arrangement of the service into watches, a new watch ministering  in turn every week.”  Nahmanides vigorously contests maimonides’ last claim. He argues  that, in their desire to certify the watches’ scriptural authority after  they were instituted, the Rabbis searched for an exegetical way to  authorize the praxis. Thus, claims Nahmanides, the midrash rests on  an asmakhta, a scriptural hook that the Rabbis used to support their  own laws, and not a legitimate exegesis.58 The essence of his objections  is that the watches were instituted by the prophets and were not  scripturally ordained.59  Along similar lines, while maimonides does provide some scriptural  indication that a cooperative rotation system operated in the Temple,  one fails to find any evidence in his scriptural and rabbinic citations for  there being a commandment to institute priestly watches. An external  agenda, however, is suggested by the broader formulation of the  commandment, given in the ShM:  We are commanded that the priests are to minister in divisions  [mishmarot], every division ministering one week, and that all divisions  are not to minister at the same time,60 except during the festivals when  58 . To determine when a midrash is a genuine interpretation of scripture and when  it is merely an asmakhta is critical for the construction of commandment claims.  disagreements between maimonides and Nahmanides on this topic are the basis of  some of their many disagreements on what constitutes a scriptural commandment.  There are no shared and definitive criteria for categorizing such midrashic explications;  see chapter 7, note 10 for some proposed criteria.  59 . Hasagot, ad loc. Nahmanides notes that maimonides presented a revised formulation  in the Halakhot and that “this formulation is more precise than what he presented here  [in the ShM].” Indeed, the emphasis in the Heading to Hilkhot Kele ha-Miqdash (“That  all the watches be equal on the festivals”) and in Hilkhot Kele ha-Miqdash 4:4-5 is on the  equal sharing of the festival service, or, more specifically, that all priests be allowed to  share equally in the offerings of the festivals. There is no indication in these Halakhot  that scripture was mandating this institution of watches; the verse simply appears to  reflect an old and established practice.  60 . literally, “and that everyone’s hand should not busy itself at the same time (ve-lo tihiye  — 122 — </page> <page sequence="27"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- all divisions are to share equally in the service and any [priest] who is  present may sacrifice.  We have already seen that maimonides wishes to emphasize the  decorum and orderliness of the Temple service in order to strengthen  the “greatness of the sanctuary and the awe felt for it.” perhaps this  motivation underlies his insistence that the watches should have their  own individuated mitsvat ‘aseh�  p37. That the priests defile themselves for their deceased relatives, and  mourn for them like other Israelites, who are commanded to mourn for  their relatives, as it is said, “for her, he shall defile himself” (lev. 21:3). This commandment consists of two parts: the priests must defile  themselves for deceased relatives, and they must mourn for their  dead, as must all Israelites. The second part of the claim is intended  to be inferred from the first, but the inference is difficult to sustain.  maimonides supports this strained exegesis with a talmudic source  that assumes that one day of mourning is a scripturally mandated  commandment, despite no explicit scriptural command to that effect.  proof: maimonides takes evidence that mourning is a scriptural  obligation from the talmudic position that one must not mourn during  a festival. The talmudic passage (BT Moed Qatan 14b) reads as follows: “If  the mourning begins before the festival, the positive precept affecting  all Israel [to rejoice in the festival] overrides that affecting only the  individual commandment enjoining one [to mourn over his deceased  relative].” maimonides concludes: “It is clear that the obligation of  mourning is scriptural, but is scripturally obligatory only on the first  day, while the remaining six days [of mourning are obligatory only by]  rabbinic ordinance.” The conclusion that the sages consider mourning a  scriptural obligation follows the opinion of many geonim, in particular,  maimonides’ principal halakhic authority, Isaac Alfasi.61  yad ha-kol mitasseqet yahad),” an idiomatic expression that conveys a sense of chaos  and disorder. 61 . Alfasi’s ruling can be found in his Hilkhot ha-RIf, BT Berakhot 10a and BT Moed Qatan  11b in the Alfasi pages (Vilna ed.). — 123 — </page> <page sequence="28"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In his search for scriptural evidence for the commandment to  mourn, maimonides quotes the following midrash in the ShM: “for her  he shall defile himself is a positive commandment. If he [a priest] does  not wish to defile himself, he is made to do so against his will.”62 priests  must defile themselves for their dead relatives — helping to bury the  dead person, even if they come into contact with the corpse — despite  the general prohibition that forbids them to defile themselves for the  dead. maimonides goes on to argue that “this itself is the commandment  of mourning; that is to say that every Israelite person63 is obligated to  mourn his relatives, that is, the five64 dead [relatives] for whom there  is a duty [mete mitsvah].” using an a fortiori inference, maimonides  explains that it is to confirm this obligation that He has expressly declared in the case  of the priest, who is [ordinarily] forbidden to suffer defilement, that [in  respect of the five relatives] he must defile himself at any rate like all  other Israelites, so that the law of mourning may not be lightly esteemed. Towards the end of his comments, maimonides repeats this analysis,  noting that “even a priest is bound to observe mourning on the first  day, and to defile himself for his [deceased] relatives. understand this.”  Aware that the demonstration is forced, he wants the reader to accept  his reasoning. Karo objects to maimonides’ suggestion:  This proof is puzzling, for defilement is one matter and mourning  another. one cannot draw an implication that a priest must mourn  his relatives from the fact that He commanded that [the priest] defile  himself for his relatives.65  maimonides struggles to fill an evidentiary gap in the oral tradition  that maintains that there is in fact a positive commandment to mourn  62 . Sifra Emor 1:12 (94a). 63 . In the Arabic, the word shkhts, “person,” is used, but the phrase kol ish, “every man,” is  used in the MnT translation. 64 . some versions have six; see “Tsiyunim,” Sefer ha-Mitsvot, ad loc., and see Sefer ha- Mitsvot, ed.

As Karo complains, maimonides’  attempt does not satisfy. This obvious difficulty forces maimonides  to make a second, but still unsuccessful, attempt in the MT66 before  abandoning the connection altogether in the GP (III:47).67  In my opinion, there is no special politico-philosophical or  theological motivation behind this claim. Instead, I believe that  maimonides’ forced attempts to find a scriptural basis for this practice  stemmed exclusively from his extraordinary respect for the oral  tradition, which maintained that there was a scriptural obligation to  mourn at least one day, despite the lack of scriptural evidence. This  respectful attitude was foreshadowed in Rule 2, where he makes a rare  concession and states that “if the sages themselves clearly affirm that  ‘it is of the essence of Torah’ or that ‘it is of scriptural authority,’ it is  proper to count that particular law [among the commandments] even  though the law is not scripturally explicit.”68  66 . see Hilkhot Avel 1:1. I say “unsuccessful attempt” because the new proof text, “Had  I eaten sin offering today, would the lord have approved” (lev. 10:19), can hardly  be taken as an admonition. (For an interpretation of the reasons for this proof, see  RadBaZ, ad loc.)  67 . david Hartman notes (I believe correctly) that “the lack of any explicit biblical text  dealing with the commandment of mourning may very well explain why maimonides  in the context of the Guide of the Perplexed does not mention the laws of mourning.”  lawrence Kaplan believes, however, that he found “the ‘missing’ cross-reference to  the laws of mourning of the Mishneh Torah” in a section of the Guide dealing with  “the commandments concerned with the clean and unclean,” GP III:47. maimonides  there notes: “Every priest in particular was forbidden to expose himself to being made  unclean by a corpse unless it were a case of strong necessity in which it would be  difficult for nature to avoid this; I refer to avoiding contact with one’s parents, children  and brothers.” Kaplan comments: “The rites of mourning, on the biblical level, are not  self-directed and commanded for the therapeutic benefit of the mourner, but rather  are other-directed.” They are, he says, “forms of personal kevod ha-met, of honoring  one’s deceased relatives.” Thus, according to Kaplan, maimonides redefined the  scriptural concept of mourning in GP and ceased seeking a scriptural reference for  the traditional concept of mourning. As attractive as this argument is, the passage in  III:47 does not indicate a qualitatively different, other-directed obligation to mourn;  the words “unless it were a case of strong necessity in which it would be difficult for  nature to avoid this” seem to imply, instead, some sort of unavoidable need to waive  the laws of defilement. Hartman’s view is cited by Kaplan. see Kaplan, “The unity of  maimonides’ Thought,” 393-412. 68 . much the same can be said with regard to the scriptural prooftext adduced in the  — 125 — </page> <page sequence="30"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- p112. That the leper shall be universally recognized as such by the  prescribed marks: “His garments shall be rent and the hair of his head  disheveled and he shall cover his upper lip and shall cry ‘unclean,  unclean’” (lev. 13:45). so too, all other unclean persons should  declare themselves as such. proof: The Sifra infers that scripture requires anyone “in whom the  plague is” to rend his clothes and grow his hair from the redundant  prepositional phrase in “the leper in whom the plague is” (lev.13:45,  emphasis added). This requirement, the midrash asserts, includes the  High priest, despite the prohibition against his normally doing so.69  maimonides discusses this waived prohibition:  It is an accepted principle among us that wherever you find a positive  commandment and a negative commandment [applying at the same  time] if you can fulfill both, well and good; but if not, the positive  commandment overrides the negative commandment (yavo ‘aseh ve- yidhe et lo ta‘aseh) ... since we find it laid down [by the sages] that if a  High priest is leprous he must let his hair go loose and rend his clothes  [the negative commandment notwithstanding], it follows that this is a  positive commandment [for every leper to be unkempt]. Building on the midrash, maimonides uses a rabbinic principle to infer  this commandment. since the midrash teaches that a leprous High  priest is required to become unkempt, despite the general prohibition,  and a positive commandment overrides a negative commandment,  the command for a leper to become unkempt must be a mitsvat ‘aseh�  maimonides’ inference is not entirely convincing, since the midrash  MT (see above, note 67). While the commandment could be inferred from the text,  such an inference would need to follow the exception clause of Rule 2. The ShM and  MT proof texts assume that mourning was one of those exceptions. However, in a  celebrated responsum (Responsa, ed. Blau, vol. 2, no. 355, 631-632), maimonides states  that there were no more than “three or four” such exceptions, and better candidates  could be found for these few exceptions. see Feintuch, Sefer ha-Mitsvot im Perush  Pequde Yesharim, vol. 1, 43-45. In his analysis, Feintuch concludes that maimonides  did not mean that there were only three or four exceptions; rather, he meant that  the number of exceptions is very small, and thus perhaps this commandment could  represent a further exception. 69 . Sifra Tazri‘a 12:5 (67d). — 126 — </page> <page sequence="31"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- derives the law’s applicability to the High priest from the redundant  prepositional phrase “in whom the plague is,” rather than by using the  talmudic principle of “yavo ‘aseh ve-yidhe et lo ta‘aseh.” According to the  midrash, the talmudic principle is not necessary: scripture provides the  exception by means of a redundancy.70  As we noted, the Sifra concludes that even the High priest must  rend his clothes and grow his hair if he becomes a leper. maimonides  does not simply subsume this requirement as a particular of the laws of  the leper71 under p101 (“that a leper is unclean and defiles”). Instead,  he crafts a new commandment that reflects an original understanding  of the purpose and essence of the requirement that the leper must  allow himself to be recognized universally as a leper.72 His insistence  on individuating such a requirement may well have something to do  with what he sees as a justification for the disease.  maimonides avers that a slanderer is miraculously stricken  70 . see perla, Sefer ha-Mitsvot le-RaSaG, vol. 1, p189, 808-810. While Hurewitz (in Sefer ha- Mitsvot im Perush Yad ha-Levi, 121n5) acknowledges the problem, he dismisses it by reading  the midrashic exegesis as based on the hermeneutic principle. This reading, however, does  not fit the literal text of the midrash, which draws a typical inference from the verse.  71 . In Hilkhot Tumat Tsara‘at 10:7, maimonides categorizes the requirement that a leper  be secluded, derived from “he shall dwell apart; his dwelling shall be outside the camp”  (lev. 13:46), as a specific provision of the commandment (din ha-metsora‘) rather than  an independent commandment. I assume (although it is not clear) that maimonides  means this to be a provision of p101 (as does de leon, “megillat Esther,” 291).  Nahmanides (in Hasagot, “Addenda to the positive Commandments,” no. 14, 290) says  that maimonides counted “he shall dwell apart; his dwelling shall be outside the camp”  as an independent commandment. de leon comments in response that while perhaps  Nahmanides counted it as an independent commandment, maimonides certainly  did not. duran (in Zohar ha-Raqia, siman 80, 92), proposes to make p112 part of the  independent commandment of “he shall dwell apart; his dwelling shall be outside the  camp.” For a short bibliography on authors who take up this point, see 92n469; see  also ibid., siman 45, 46 and notes. It is possible that both Nahmanides and duran  understood the leper’s obligation to remain secluded as a more general form of the  obligation to keep others away from himself. For both of these jurists, the overarching  commandment was “he shall dwell apart; his dwelling shall be outside the camp,” and  the requirements to rend clothes, keep his head covered, and such constituted details  of the commandment. In contrast, maimonides held that the leper’s obligation to  display his impurity constituted the more general principle while the precept to live  secluded was a detail. 72 . For a discussion of maimonides’ wider teleologically-driven conclusions, see my  comments in chapter 2. — 127 — </page> <page sequence="32"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- with leprosy because the revolting nature of the disease73 raises two  natural barriers: one barrier between the slanderer and his wicked  circle of friends to keep him from continuing to engage “in evil talk,  which consists of mockery and malicious gossip,” and a second barrier  between the slanderer and the person wishing to be virtuous. As he  writes in Hilkhot Tumat Tsara‘at 16:10: “it is fitting for someone who  wishes to set aright his ways to distance himself from their presence  and from speaking with them so that he does not become entrapped in  the net of wicked people and their follies.” maimonides sees leprosy as  a way to keep society away from the sinner rather than as a punishment  for the sinner. In this sense, the public voicing of his own uncleanness  is unrelated to the particulars of his uncleanness and defilement.  Therefore, this requirement is not subsumed under p101.74 p149. To examine the marks in cattle, as it is said, “these are the  beasts which ye may eat” (lev. 11:2). p150. To examine the marks in fowl, so as to distinguish between the  unclean and the clean, as it is said, “of all clean birds ye may eat”  (deut. 14:11). p151. To examine the marks in locusts, so as to distinguish the clean  from the unclean, as it is said, “(yet these may ye eat of every flying,  creeping thing that goeth upon all four) which have legs (above their  feet)” (lev. 11:21).75  p152. To examine the marks in fishes, as it is said, “These shall ye eat  of all that are in the waters” (lev. 11:9). As in other instances where maimonides struggles with formulating  a commandment or with its supporting hermeneutic, traces of the  struggle can be found in the linguistic variants of the extant versions  of the ShM (and the MT). While one cannot assert with certainty which  of the extant versions represents the final one, all of the versions carry  a similar message: the conscious act of separating the pure from the  73 . Cf. GP III:47, 597. 74 . In the gloss to p112, maimonides extends this law to stipulate that all who become  unclean must make themselves recognizable (not merely the leper). 75 . Note that this verse contains a description of the locusts, not the typical proof text for  the commandment. see our discussion below. — 128 — </page> <page sequence="33"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- impure, separating that which may be consumed from that which may  not. maimonides pursues this agenda by means of a forced, somewhat  confusing, but nonetheless creative exegetical exercise. For purposes of  the ensuing discussion, I follow the formulaic expression “to examine”  found in all the versions of the SE and assume that it represents  maimonides’ final viewpoint.76  proof: After explicitly prohibiting the consumption of living things  that do not possess the requisite tokens (as detailed in N172–N174),  scripture further enjoins: “These are the living things which ye may eat  among all the beasts that are on the earth. Whatsoever parteth...among  the beasts, that may ye eat” (lev. 11:2-3). As a proof text for p149,  maimonides cites the opening line of the verse: “these are the living  things which ye may eat,” together with the Sifra’s exposition on the  closing statement of verse 3: “That may ye eat: only that may be eaten,  but not the unclean beast.”77  maimonides explains that the midrash uses an hermeneutic rule  that infers a prohibition from the positive statement. This type of  inferred prohibition, called “a negative commandment that is inferred  from a ‘do’ statement” (“lav ha-ba-mikhlal ‘aseh,” also “issur ‘aseh”), is  not punishable as a negative commandment because scripture does not  articulate the prohibition in the form of an explicit interdiction. The  positive statement coupled with the fact that the law calls the injunction  an ‘aseh (“lav ha-ba-mikhlal ‘aseh, ‘aseh”) provides the hermeneutic basis  for maimonides’ claim that examining for clean animals is a positive  commandment. maimonides shows himself satisfied with this proof  (“thus it has been made clear that His words that ye may eat are a  76 . The ShM versions appear to reflect at least two different literary or compositional  stages. The MnT translation is similar to the language of the SE. It claims that the  commandment mandates one to “examine” [livdoq] the tokens of the various animals  and “[only] then would their consumption be permitted.” The Arabic versions  (including Kafih’s) and the shlomo ibn Ayub translation cited by Heller in the notes to  his ShM edition read instead “that we were commanded about [Hebrew al; Arabic b; or  “concerning”] the tokens” of the various animals. The former version would obligate  one to examine particular animals for tokens of fitness; the latter, simply to know the  characteristics of animals that are fit for consumption. The difference in formulation  is also present in maimonides’ later compositions, as we shall see. 77 . Sifra Shemini 3:1 (48b). — 129 — </page> <page sequence="34"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- positive commandment”).78  But does this exegesis support maimonides’ actual claim? The  midrash sees leviticus 11:3 as adding a new prohibition against eating  living things that do not possess the requisite tokens onto the existing  negative prohibitions, using inference from a positive statement (“that  ye may eat”). This is at least how maimonides’ critics understood the  midrash.79 This reading seems to have little to do with examining or  ascertaining the nature of the tokens. By assuming, however, that maimonides made a slight mistake in  failing to match the appropriate proof text with the pertinent midrash,  we can make some sense out of this exegesis. A close read shows that  the proof text adduced for his claim “to examine the tokens” is “These  are the living things which ye may eat” (v. 2, emphasis added). This  proof text, however, is not the one that the midrash uses to infer a  prohibition on eating. Rather, the midrash uses verse 3, which contains  the words “that may ye eat.” It is verse 2 that supports maimonides’  commandment — not verse 3, as his critics suppose — although  maimonides bears responsibility for this confusion by juxtaposing the  proof text and the midrashic exposition. To maimonides, the deictic  “these” (zot) conveys an act of choosing or ascertaining, implying the  need to examine tokens of fitness. Indeed, this is how the Sifra itself  understands this term. on verse 2, “These are the living things which  ye may eat,” the midrash expounds: “It teaches us that moses held the  living thing, and on showing it to the Israelites, would say, ‘this you  78 . see above, chapter 2, in particular note 12, for further discussion of this hermeneutic. 79 . so for example, daniel ha-Bavli, who infers an additional, non-explicit prohibition  against eating non-kosher animals (Abraham maimonides, “Teshuvot Rabbenu  Abraham ben ha-RamBam,” siman 10, 277, s.v. u-le-shitato) from this verse (and fowl  and fish from similar verses). Nahmanides, too, fails to see here anything other than  a prohibition against eating non-kosher living things. Furthermore, since an explicit  prohibition against eating non-kosher living things already exists, Nahmanides sees no  reason to enumerate this additional injunction and finds Qayyara’s omission justified.  see Nahmanides, Hasagot, Rule 6, 131, s.v. “ve-ani roeh.” However, what maimonides  derives from the cited verse is an injunction to examine the tokens of animals before  eating them and not a prohibition to eat non-kosher animals! While Nahmanides  could have questioned the relationship between the midrash and the presumed claim,  he surely would not have misread the claim. I am thus at a loss to understand his  critique. — 130 — </page> <page sequence="35"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- may eat, this you may not eat.’”80  For whatever reason, maimonides is not fully satisfied with the  exegetical basis of this group of claims, and we see him changing  his exegesis towards the end of his explications. There he offers  a further clarification on these four commandments in the form  of a restatement — but one that surely represents an entirely new  explanation: And that which we said — that it is a positive commandment — is what I  already mentioned to you:81 we are commanded to decide on the basis of  these tokens that one fish is permitted food, and another is not permitted,  as scripture clearly says: Ye shall separate between the clean beast and the  unclean (and between the unclean fowl and the clean) [lev. 20:25].  With this comment, maimonides shifts the weight of the exegetical  proof away from the earlier proof texts and their accompanying  hermeneutic principle to an entirely new verse. The new proof text  explicitly commands one to differentiate a clean animal from an  unclean one. despite its greater clarity, however, the new proof text is  not as comprehensive as maimonides indicates; it refers to beasts and  birds but omits fish and grasshoppers.82 soon thereafter, maimonides  returns to the earlier-cited midrash to differentiate four separate  commandments: The separation can be made only by means of the [prescribed] tokens,  and therefore [the injunction to search for] the tokens in each of the four  types [of living creatures] — animals tame and wild, birds, grasshoppers,  and fish — is a separate and distinct commandment. We have already  shown that [the sages] regarded each of them as one of the positive  commandments.  80 . Sifra Shemini, parshah 2:2 (47d). 81 . In the Hebrew, “ve-ha-inyan be-amrenu she-hi mitsvat ‘aseh, mah she-hizkarti lekhah,”  is an idiomatic expression of re-statement. on maimonides’ intellectual dynamism  and his ability to add a new rationale to revitalize a rejected position, see Henshke,  “maimonides as His own Commentator”, 117-163. 82 . Cf. daniel ha-Bavli, in Abraham maimonides, “Teshuvot Rabbenu Abraham ben ha- RamBam,” siman 10, 277, s. v. “ve-od hinneh bier.”  — 131 — </page> <page sequence="36"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- maimonides does not explain how the particular breakdown of the  various prohibitions, presumably against eating non-kosher animals,  can supplement or illuminate the new commandment to examine  the tokens of these creatures. This is a problematic gap,83 unless one  was willing to accept the explanation regarding the confused use of  the midrash. In sum, the various scriptural verses and their rabbinic  warrants fail to sustain and differentiate these commandments clearly. Whether the problem is four individuations, loosely based on a  midrashic interpretation, or one individuation based on an incomplete  proof text, the basic motivational question remains: what drove  maimonides to individuate these commandments when the essential  prohibition against eating the flesh of unclean animals had already  been individuated? I submit that maimonides’ political views were  at least partly responsible for this move. maimonides views the law  as a political instrument for bringing order to society, a notion well  documented in his philosophic works.84 As with those of contemporary  Islamic philosophers, maimonides’ political ideas are informed by  plato’s views of the City and its organization,85 its emphasis on  social stratification and its use of different metals as symbols for  the hermeticism of social classes. Consistent with these views,  maimonides saw the law as drawing clear and categorical boundaries  between domains: between clean and unclean animals, between states  of cleanness and uncleanness, between priests and levites, between  levites and Israelites, and between Israelites and pagan nations.86  83 . What stands out is maimonides’ desire to preserve four claims for his enumeration, a  fitting objective if he intended the count to be a detailed outline. see the discussion of  individuation in chapter 2. 84 . see GP II:39-40 and III:27. 85 . on the platonic influence on maimonides, see strauss, “Quelques remarques sur la  science politique de maïmonide et de Farabi,” 14: “And because the political science  that is known and deemed worthy of some attention by maimonides is a platonizing  form of politics, it will be, in the end, the doctrines of the Republic and the laws that  will determine the manner according to which maimonides will understand Torah.”  (Quotation translated by Jean-marc liling and oshrat diane Cohen.) 86 . maimonides calls the fifth book of the MT the “Book of Holiness” (Sefer Qedushah)  because, as he states in the introduction to the MT, “with these two matters [forbidden  relations and forbidden foods] God had sanctified us and separated us from the  nations,” and continues to quote two scriptural verses in support. — 132 — </page> <page sequence="37"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- As I conclude this review of maimonides’ innovations, I return for  a moment to Twersky’s categorical assumption. Recall that Twersky  understood that maimonides assumed that the 613 commandments  were fixed. The enumeration was based purely on internal  considerations, rabbinic exegesis, and individuation methods. only  after the enumeration was established did the philosopher set out to  do his task: to ascertain how the commandments relate to the welfare  of the body and the soul� In other words, maimonides’ explanations  of the goals of the commandments are after-the-fact justifications. As  we saw, Harvey doubted that matters were so simple and wondered,  “can we detect...an ongoing effort by maimonides to decide the law in  such a manner as to bring (or keep) it in line with the teloi of peace and  knowledge?”  I believe that the answer to Harvey’s question must be yes. Based  on our analysis, at least some of the innovations appear to owe their  existence to external considerations, to the ethical and political  themes that maimonides wished to emphasize. When we peruse these  innovations, we find a number of recurrent themes. maimonides  appears preoccupied with the needs of a well-ordered state, the concern  of the political philosophers of his day. This includes the concepts that  worship and sacrifices should be conducted at only one location (p85). It  also includes appeals to orderliness (p36) and cleanliness (p30). The law  must instill reverence towards the “guardians of society,” the priests,  (p32 and p34), because they are the keepers of the sanctuary and its  objects; reverence towards the sanctuary is also important so that “man  should be affected by a sentiment of submission and servitude” upon  seeing its glory and greatness (p22).87 maimonides’ concerns with  maintaining clear demarcations are also quite noteworthy, as between  ritually clean and unclean things (p149-52), and between those who  have been secluded because of their wicked ways and those who “direct  their ways aright”88 (p112). We also find that the law is concerned  87 . GP III:45, 577. 88 . As per Hilkhot Metsora‘ 16:10. maimonides’ concern with demarcations can also be  seen in his dedicating an entire treatise to concepts of holiness (qedushah), which he  read as signifying separation. see note 86 above.  — 133 — </page> <page sequence="38"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- with a well-functioning judicial system and with the adoption of just  procedures (p175, p178 and p179), possibly influenced by the muslim  courts and their interest in procedural matters. useful beliefs and  necessary opinions are crucial for the proper conduct of the platonic  society, which fully justifies the acquiring or writing of a scroll of the  Torah (p17) and the retelling of miracles (p157). similarly, obeying the  words of the true prophet (p172) brings about a belief in the validity,  immutability, and eternal nature of mosaic prophecy (p172), itself  a useful belief since “belief in prophecy precedes belief in the law.”89  lastly, the masses must be instilled with an unceasing hatred for deceit  and evil (p189) and for idolatry and paganism (p187), even when their  perpetrators and practitioners can no longer be located or identified.  In the next section, we find maimonides introducing a momentous  idea in Jewish halakhah: dogma. The case for external factors driving  the composition becomes even more compelling. THE uNCERTAIN plACE oF doGmA IN HALAKHAH many of the commandments that maimonides innovated were  concerned with particular aspects of creating a well-ordered and moral  society. The laws he delineated were specific actions to be carried out  in body and form. But what did he believe about commandments for  the mind — more precisely, could dogma be legislated? maimonides  includes on his list of positive commandments the obligations to believe  in the existence of God and to believe that God is one, despite their not  having a component of physical action. The remainder of this chapter  will analyze maimonides’ philosophical writings on the rational faculties  and assess the uncertain place of belief in a world of commanded action. doGmA ANd CommANdEdNEss In his introduction to M Avot, referred to as Shemonah Peraqim (SP),  maimonides posits that the soul is made up of five faculties: the  nutritive, the sentient, the imaginative, the appetitive, and the  89 . GP III:45, 576. — 134 — </page> <page sequence="39"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- rational. These ideas are adaptations of Aristotle’s taxonomy of the  soul, as expanded and mediated by the Islamic philosopher Al-Farabi.90  In chapter two of SP, maimonides discusses the faculties in which  transgressions, observances, virtues, and vices reside. He writes:  Know that disobedience and obedience of the law are found only in two  parts of the soul, namely, the sentient part and the appetitive part. All the  transgressions and the commandments involve these two parts. There is  no obedience or disobedience in the nutritive or imaginative parts, since  thought and choice do not act upon them at all. By his thought, man is  not able to suspend their action or to limit them to a certain action.91  He posits here that conscious or voluntary acts are connected to the  sentient and the appetitive parts of the soul; thus these parts of the  soul can be called the media of transgression and obedience.  maimonides defines the rational part of the soul as “the power  found in man by which he perceives intelligibles, deliberates, acquires  the sciences, and distinguishes between base and noble actions. some  of these activities are practical and some are theoretical.”92 He then asks  whether the rational part can transgress or obey, to which he responds: Although there is perplexity concerning the rational part, I say that this  power too may bring about obedience and disobedience, namely, belief  in a false or a true opinion. But there is no act in it to which the terms  commandment or transgression would apply.93  90 . The Aphorisms of the Statesman (fusul al-Madani) served as maimonides’ blueprint for  SP. see davidson, “maimonides’ Shemonah Perakim and Al-Farabi’s fusul al-Madani,”  33-50. 91 . Ethical Writings of Maimonides, ed. Weiss and Butterworth, 64. 92 . Ibid., 63. 93 . Ibid., 64-65. shailat (in Haqdamot ha-RaMBaM la-Mishnah, ed. shailat, 273) suggests  that maimonides could have resolved this question by referring to the commandment  of learning Torah, an activity centered in the mind that also involves the appetitive  and sensitive faculties. shailat refutes this demonstration by arguing that maimonides  was seeking an activity that solely and exclusively resided in the mind. I believe,  however, that one can posit a more fundamental distinction between Torah study  and doctrinal belief. one studies Torah neither to assert nor to demonstrate the truth  of its commandments, but rather to acquire sufficient knowledge to perform them.  However, the truth of beliefs is subject to investigation and demonstration. It is this  latter activity to which maimonides refers when he discusses commanding the rational  — 135 — </page> <page sequence="40"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- maimonides does not tell us what thinkers are behind this “perplexity” or  why it should even be a matter of doubt. yet there is some evidence that a  significant number of early medieval rabbinic authorities did not consider  beliefs to be valid objects of commandments.94 We learn this from remarks  in the work The Duties of the Heart (al-Hidaya ila faraid al-Qulub, or Hovot  ha-Levavot in the Hebrew translation). little is known about its author,  Bahya b. Joseph ibn paquda, other than that he was an eleventh-century  rabbinic scholar in muslim spain. As its title suggests, Bahya wrote  this work because he believed that even those most punctilious about  performing commandments neglected the duties of the heart.  By all accounts, the work was extremely popular from the moment  of its appearance and had a profound influence on Jewish pietistic  practice and literature.95 In his apologia for undertaking this work,  Bahya offers an interesting classification of the commandments. He  divides the obligations of the religious person into two parts: the duties  of the body and its limbs, with which one expresses outward obedience,  and the duties of the heart, with which one expresses inward obedience.  duties of the body include prayer, fasting, almsgiving, learning his book and spreading the  knowledge of it, fulfilling the commandments concerning the Tabernacle,  the palm branch, the fringes, the doorpost, the railings on the roof, and  faculty. I thank my grandson, Tsvi Horowitz, for making this fine distinction. I have  also noticed that the distinction between the law and wisdom is made very clearly in  GP III:54, 633. 94 . There are indications, however, that at least some talmudic rabbis held that there was  room for correct beliefs in halakhah, as in the passage: “[And that ye not go] after your own  heart [Num. 15:39]: this refers to heresy; and so it says: The fool hath said in his heart, There  is no God [Eccl. 14:1]” (BT Berakhot 12b). see also Sifre Numbers, Shelakh-Lekha 115 (126),  on Num. 15:39, which maimonides uses as his proof text for N47. since this violation  does not involve an act, transgressors are exempt from lashes; nevertheless, it constitutes  a transgression. scripture thus forbids the denying of the existence of God. Qayyara lists  “After your own heart” among the negative commandments (Nq117), although, as we  cautioned earlier, we have no way to know to which prohibition Qayyara was referring,  since he simply listed scriptural verses or close paraphrases. 95 . The consensus of modern scholars is that maimonides was not only well acquainted  with Bahya’s work but may have been influenced by it (private communication with  Haggai ben-shammai).  — 136 — </page> <page sequence="41"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- the like, all of which can be wholly performed by man’s physical body.96 Inward obedience, on the other hand, is expressed through the duties  of the heart. some of the most important active duties of the heart  include: “to believe in the Creator of the world, who brought the world  into existence from nothingness; to believe in pure monotheism, free  from a belief in any other gods; to assent to obeying God in our hearts;”  and others. Negative duties of the heart consist of emotions such as  rancor, envy, and vengeance, and by a denial of the theological doctrines  listed above.97 For Bahya, inward obedience must both precede and  accompany outward obedience: “Thus I have come to know for certain  that the duties of the members are of no avail to us unless our hearts  choose to do them and our soul desires their performance.”98  Bahya relates a statement relevant to our project in his discussion of  enumerating the duties of the heart. When he counted the duties of the  heart, he writes, “I found that their details were very numerous...for the  duties of the members are limited in number, about 613 commandments  in all, while the duties of the heart are many and their details innumerable.”  since the duties of the heart include the belief in the Creator and the belief  in pure monotheism, it follows that Bahya did not count these two beliefs  in his TaRYaG count: in his philosophy, commandments include only acts  “that can be wholly performed by man’s physical body.”99  Although Bahya separates the duties of the heart from a listing of  biblical commandments — while giving them priority of knowledge and  importance — maimonides incorporates two of these beliefs, the belief  in the existence of a particular God and the belief in pure monotheism,  96 . Bahya ibn paquda. The Book of Direction to the Duties of the Heart, 89.  97 . Ibid., 87. 98 . Ibid., 89. or see: “What determines the punishment is the participation of both heart  and body in the act — the heart in the intention and the body in carrying out the  heart’s intention .... since now, the foundation and the pillar of action is the intention  of the heart and conscience, the knowledge of the duties of the heart should come  before and stand above the knowledge of the duties of the members” (ibid., 91). 99 . Ibid., 89. maimonides clearly alludes to the idea that commandments can only include  bodily acts when he writes that the rational part “may bring about obedience and  disobedience, namely belief in a false or a true opinion.” The rational part is thus  able to be commanded, despite the fact that “there is no act in it to which the terms  commandment or transgression would apply.” — 137 — </page> <page sequence="42"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- into his TaRYaG count. How he accomplishes this feat is the subject of  the next section. We appreciate the significance of maimonides’ innovation when we  notice that these two affirmations are not found in Qayyara’s list of  commandments. While Hildesheimer places these two commandments  under the header of Qayyara’s entry pq39, “and belief” (ve-emunah),  also listed as “and truth” (ve-emet),100 this is almost certainly mistaken.  pq39 follows immediately after a group of commandments devoted to  the relationship between man and his fellow man: “to clothe the naked”  (pq33), “to bury the dead” (pq34), “to console the mourner” (pq35),  “to visit the sick” (pq36), “to love peace” (pq37), and “and justice”  (pq38). It seems likely that Qayyara intended this commandment to  stand for the obligation to conduct business in an honest manner, as in  the rabbinic expression, “did you carry out transactions with honesty”  (nasata v-natata be-emunah). If Qayyara had indeed intended to list the  commandments to believe in the existence of God and His oneness,  one should have expected to find these entries next to “love of God”  (pq23) and “fear of God” (pq24), or at the very head of the list, given  their obvious importance.101  This observation is confirmed by none other than Nahmanides,  Qayyara’s principal apologist, who declares: “I saw that the author of  the Halakhot [Qayyara] did not count this commandment [the existence  of God] among the 613.”102 According to Nahmanides, Qayyara omits  the commandment to believe in God’s existence from his count because  commandments by necessity presuppose His existence. God is the  “fundament and root” from which all commandments issue. Therefore,  belief in God cannot be counted among the commandments. 100 . Hildesheimer, Haqdamat Sefer Halakhot Gedolot, 74n335. 101 . The declaration of His oneness, through the recitation of the Shema, is the first entry  in Qayyara’s list of positive commandments.  102 . Nahmanides, Hasagot, p1, 206. shelomo ibn Gabirol, who tends to follow Qayyara’s  enumeration, also omits belief in God from his enumeration. moses ibn Tibbon,  the first expositor of Gabirol’s Azharot, thought that Gabirol had counted this  commandment in line 11: “I took you out, I admonished you, I guided you, in righteous  ways.” This line, however, appears to be a preamble to the list of commandments  that follows. duran, Zohar ha-Raqia, ad loc., 3-4, disputes Ibn Tibbon’s reading on  interpretive grounds.  — 138 — </page> <page sequence="43"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- on Nahmanides’ explanation, one would have to conclude that a vast  theological divide exists between jurists like Qayyara, who presuppose  the existence of a divine lawgiver (and do not need to enumerate the  commandment to affirm it), and jurists like maimonides, who require  an explicit, reasoned affirmation of God’s existence. It is reasonable to  presume that Qayyara would be satisfied with almost any understanding  of a superior being, even an anthropomorphic one, if that persona could  form the basis for obedience of the laws. For maimonides, however,  who incorporates into the commandments a refined philosophical  definition of God, such a conception of a supreme lawgiver would have  constituted heresy. An explicit affirmation of God is how maimonides  ensures that the correct vision of divinity undergirds the foundation  of commandments. maimonides was not the first scholar to propose that belief in the  existence of God is a commandment. That distinction belongs to the  Babylonian gaon, Hefets b. yatsliah, who writes:  The first precept enjoins us to unite our mind and thoughts on the truths of  the matter; to make our Creator exist in our heart, and to consider Him lord  of all things without a shadow of doubt, and without any other thought; to  know that He is truth; as it is written: Know therefore this day, and lay it to  thy heart, that YHWH is Eloqim, there is no-one else besides Him [deut. 4:39].103  103 . Hefets’ description of the first commandment was preserved for us by Judah b. Barzilai  in his twelfth-century commentary on the Book of Creation (Sefer Yetsirah) (above  quotation from Judah b. Barzilai, Perush Sefer Yetsirah, 55-56). Hefets explains the  two divine terms and references the end of the verse as proof that “He is one and that  there is no other.” Hefets later adds that he is obliged to explain his proof that God  exists, “that He is one and that there is no other,” so that one “may be strengthened  in the belief that He is one, and is the creator of all things.” Hefets, A volume of the  Book of Precepts, trans. Halper. missing from Hefets’ apparatus is a rabbinic warrant to  support the commandment claim. davidson notes that maimonides had “precedents... for viewing belief in, or the knowledge of, the existence of God as a formal  commandment of the law,” among them Bahya, Hefets, samuel b. Hofni, and Ibn Ezra.  davidson shows that there is a “modicum of corroboration” for the idea that Hefets’  formulation of the first two positive commandments of the law “was a springboard  for maimonides.” davidson, “The First Two Commandments,” 127-133. Hyman also  notes: “By the time of maimonides it was accepted at least by philosophers, that belief  in the existence of God and similar beliefs formed part of the system of mitsvot and  that their affirmation was a matter of religious observation.” Hyman, “Rabbi simlai’s  sayings and Beliefs Concerning God,” 52. I must insist, however, that none of these  — 139 — </page> <page sequence="44"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- In contrast to Hefets, who adduced only scriptural support, maimonides  provided a rabbinic warrant to prove this innovative claim (as we  shall soon see). This lent great halakhic authority to his claim and  undoubtedly became the main reason for the unquestioning reception  of his idea in later generations.  I now return to maimonides and his remarks in the second chapter  of SP. While other thinkers did not necessarily connect transgression  and obedience to the rational part of the soul, maimonides did not  doubt this connection. He does not explain how he knows that the  rational part can be commanded, but this thesis correlates with his  ethical-philosophical worldview, with its emphasis on correct notions  and moral dispositions.104 maimonides sees the law as commanding the  acquisition of these correct notions. If the law truly aims to enhance  the welfare of the soul, then the law would necessarily encourage and  inculcate correct opinions. In his words:  Among the things to which your attention ought to be directed is that  you should know that in regard to the correct opinions through which the  ultimate perfections may be obtained, the law has communicated only  their end and made a call to believe in them in a summary way — that  is, to believe in the existence of the deity, may He be exalted, His unity,  His knowledge, His power, His will, and His eternity. All these points are  ultimate ends, which can be made clear in detail and through definitions  only after one knows many opinions (GP III:28, 512).  In short, to obtain the “ultimate perfections” (which would lead to  ultimate happiness), man must acquire a correct notion of God and  His oneness. His innovation is that the “law had made a call to believe  in them”: it commanded the acquisition of these notions.105  exegetes cited rabbinic warrants for the formal claim, thus failing to integrate these  beliefs into the halakhic world of commandments. 104 . In this and related respects, maimonides follows very closely on the footsteps of one of  his principal philosophical mentors, Al-Farabi. Compare this discussion with Al-Farabi’s  Aphorisms of the Statesman, fusul, in particular the early paragraphs and para. 49. see  davidson, “maimonides’ Shemonah Perakim and Al-Farabi’s Fusul al-madani,” 33-50. 105 . At this point, I am short-circuiting the subtle distinction that maimonides makes  between welfare and perfection, as some scholars have suggested. see Galston, “The  purpose of law According to maimonides,” 27-51, and Harvey, “political philosophy  — 140 — </page> <page sequence="45"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- In the ShM, maimonides gives a proof that these beliefs constitute  a commandment. In support of his first commandment claim, to know  God, maimonides references the end of BT Makkot, paraphrasing the  familiar aggadic passage found there:  six hundred and thirteen [TaRYaG] commandments were declared unto  moses at sinai, as the verse says, Moses commanded us a Law [Torah] [deut.  33:4]; that is, he commanded us to observe as many commandments as are  signified by the sum of the letter-numbers ToRaH. To this it was objected  that the letter-numbers of the word ToRaH add up to only six hundred  and eleven; to which the reply was: “The two commandments I am the  Lord thy God and Thou shalt have no other gods before Me [Exod. 20:2-3]  we heard from the Almighty Himself.” That is, the lord commanded 611  commandments to the Israelites through moses, thus Moses commanded  a Law, and two commandments directly.  As we saw earlier, this exegesis is attributed to R. Hamnuna. maimonides  ends his short comment by stating: “Thus it has been made clear to you  that the verse I am the Lord thy God is one of the 613 commandments,  and is that whereby we are commanded to believe in God, as we have  explained” (emphasis added). To understand the compelling legal nature of this aggadah, we need  first to understand the profound truth that maimonides believed lay  hidden in it. GP II:33 is dedicated to explaining the unique event of the  revelation at sinai. After offering an interpretation of the text based  on the “external meaning,” 106 he then proceeds to tell us that the sages  “also have a dictum formulated in several passages of the midrashim  and Halakhah in maimonides,” 198-212. This difference may lie at the heart of  maimonides’ pedagogy. The uninitiated individual accepts the existence of God with  some minimum rational support, while the enlightened individual seeks perfection  through a thorough demonstration of His Existence and oneness. 106 . The “external” (zahir) and “internal” (batin) meaning of parables, explained in the  Introduction to part I of the GP, is a critical tool in understanding the GP’s project.  maimonides writes that while the external meaning of parables “contains wisdom  that is useful in many respects, among which is the welfare of human societies,” the  internal meaning “contains wisdom that is useful for beliefs concerned with the truth  as it is” (12). For a detailed discussion of this hermeneutic, see stern, Problems and  Parables of Law� For a critique of stern’s work, see Kaplan, “Review of Josef stern’s  problems and parables of the law,” 361-364.  — 141 — </page> <page sequence="46"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- and also figuring in the Talmud.”  The dictum to which maimonides refers and which describes  revelation in allegorical terms is contained in none other than R.  simlai’s aggadah of the 613 commandments. It reveals the “internal  meaning” of the fateful events that occurred at sinai by drawing a  sharp categorical distinction between the first two commandments  and the rest of the Torah. According to the “external meaning” of the  verses, moses had relayed all the commandments to the Israelites after  receiving them directly from God; according to the “internal meaning,”  moses relays to the Israelites all the commandments except for the first  two. These first two commandments are apprehended intellectually by  each member of the entire nation, each in his own way and according  to his own capacity. This, suggests maimonides, is the true meaning of  the midrashic dictum “The two commandments I am the Lord thy God  and Thou shalt have no other gods before Me [Exod. 20:3] we heard from  the Almighty Himself.” In effect, two different types of commandments  were “heard” on sinai: those which moses and Israel apprehended  intellectually — the existence of God and His unity107 — and those which  moses relayed to the Israelites — all the remaining commandments. The  first two commandments, maimonides asserts,  are knowable by human speculation alone.108 Now, with regard to  everything that can be known by demonstration, the status of the prophet  and that of everyone else who knows it are equal; there is no superiority  of one over the other. Thus, these two principles are not known through  prophecy alone. The text of the Torah says Unto thee it was shown [that  107 . The plain meaning of “Thou shalt not have other gods before me” is that it represents  an admonition against believing in other gods — polytheism. Arguably, believing in  God’s composite unity can be viewed as believing in more than one god. Compare  Hilkhot Yesode ha-Torah 1:7.  108 . This statement confirms Efodi’s understanding that maimonides reads the words  “we heard from the Almighty Himself” in the midrash as referring to human  speculation; by means of his intellect, man can prove the existence and unity of God.  The identification of intellectual apprehension with “hearing from the Almighty” is  admittedly a bit stretched, but maimonides leaves little doubt that that is what he  thinks the allegory represents. Efodi, in Moreh Nevukhim (with the Commentaries of  Efodi, Shem Tov, Crescas and Abarbanel), trans. Ibn Tibbon, II:33:70b, s. v. “rotsim be-zeh  ha-maamar�” — 142 — </page> <page sequence="47"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- thou mightest know that the Lord, He is God; there is none else beside Him]  [deut. 4:35]. As for the other commandments they belong to the class of  generally-accepted opinions and those adopted in virtue of tradition, not  the class of the intellecta.109  As maimonides saw it, there was a profound qualitative difference  between the first two commandments and the other eight. The first  two commandments represent demonstrable propositions, the type of  statements that philosophers and logicians are wont to make. These  truths do not require the mediation of a prophet. The rest of the  commandments, on the other hand, represent conventions, the type  of laws that a wise and rational lawgiver — a prophet being the epitome  of such a wise lawgiver in maimonides’ political philosophy — would  promulgate for the benefit of a well-ordered society.  We should note that this qualitative distinction between the two  sets of commandments does not hold up in the rabbinic accounts of  the sinaitic revelation. As recounted in deuteronomy 5:22-24, moses  mediated God’s message at the behest of the Israelites, frightened  as they were by the voice of God. In Song of Songs Rabbah, the sages  disagree as to when this mediation occurred: R. Joshua says it was  after the second commandment, and the rabbis say after the tenth.110  Regardless of which interpretation one accepts, neither tradition hints  at an intrinsic difference between the first two pronouncements and  109 . The distinction between “the class of the intellecta,” on which demonstrative syllogisms  are based, and “generally accepted opinions,” on which dialectic syllogisms are built,  has been ascribed to Aristotle. The term “generally accepted opinions” corresponds  to the Greek term endoxa, defined as “those which commend themselves to all or  to the majority or to the wise — that is, to all of the wise or to the majority or to  the most famous and distinguished of them.” Aristotle, Topica, 1.1, 100b, 21-23, in  Aristotle, Posterior Analytics, Topica, 275-277. The Arabic term used here, almushhurath  (mefursamot in the Hebrew rendering), has a slightly different connotation, referring  to things that are generally known. see Les Guide des Egarés, trans. s. munk, 39n1.  In GP I:2, “generally accepted opinions” refers to the categories of good and bad (as  opposed to true and false) and can also refer to the particular notions of certain  societies. see the short bibliography on this concept in Moreh Nevukhim, ed. schwarz,  vol. II, 378n5. see also “maimonides’ Treatise on logic [English Translation],” ed. and  trans.

This appears to be sufficient  cause for maimonides to take this aggadah, or at least a part of it, as more  than just a pious homily. Furthermore, the aggadah gives maimonides the  opportunity to prove not only that dogma could be commanded, but also  that the belief in God’s existence and His oneness are commandments  that belong in the TaRYaG count: they form part of the halakhic corpus.  In light of Qayyara’s enumeration and Bahya’s description of what was  commonly thought to be contained in the 613 commandments, this last  assertion indeed represented a major halakhic innovation. THE TWo CommANdmENTs oF BElIEF In the ShM, maimonides turns the dogmas of God’s existence and His  unity into commandments. In this section, I shall examine the way  maimonides formulates these two commandments.  p1. To know that there is a God, as it is said, “I am the lord, thy God”  (Exod. 20:2; deut. 5:6). The ShM states the claim thus: “We are commanded in the belief112 of  111 . This philosophical reading did not go unnoticed in rabbinic circles. yitzhaq b. sheshet  (RiBasH; 1326-1408), a prominent halakhist and talmudist, criticized maimonides for  using Greek “wisdom” to explain certain miracles, among them the sinaitic revelation.  yitzhaq b. sheshet, Sheelot u-Teshuvot, responsum 45, 26b-27b. I am indebted to marc  shapiro for this reference. 112 . In place of the SE’s “to know,” the ShM uses the more nuanced Arabic term, itikad, which  semantically lies somewhere between knowledge and belief, perhaps best translated  as “firm conviction.” see Hilman, “Tsiyunim,” Sefer ha-Mitsvot, ed. Frankel, ad loc�, s.  v. “le-ha’amin,” 207. Also see Rawidowicz, “on maimonides’ sefer ha-madda’,” 317.  moshe ibn Tibbon, one of the translators of the ShM, rendered itikad as “to believe”  (le-ha’amin). unfortunately, there is no Hebrew word that conveys the nuanced meaning  of itikad, and translators have had to choose between translating it as “knowledge” and  — 144 — </page> <page sequence="49"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- the divinity;113 that is, to believe that there is a cause of causes who  is the efficient cause114 of everything in existence.” According to this  formulation, the existence of God is assumed; it is only the nature of this  deity that we must consider when we affirm His existence.115 Technically,  as “belief.” Hilman points out that the title of sa‘adiah’s theological treatise, al-Amanat  ve-al-Itikad, was translated by yehudah ibn Tibbon as Emunot ve-De’ot, showing that  itikad ought to be translated as de‘ot, “opinions.” Hilman also notes the use of itikad in  the opening line of GP I:50 as referring to knowledge, as does Kafih, in his note there.  But see schwarz’s comments in Moreh Nevukhim, ed. schwartz, vol. 1, 10n15, who  acknowledges Ibn Tibbon’s correct translation of sa‘adiah’s title but believes that the GP  uses it to mean “belief.” septimus notes: “itikad refers to any firm belief or conviction:  true, false or heretical, rationally derived or otherwise.” He observes further that this  true conviction, however, implies nothing with respect to its truth and rationality.  septimus draws his conclusions from the use that maimonides makes of the term in  the GP. It follows that maimonides in the ShM would require one to believe in God even  if such belief was not fully demonstrable. This reading is a bit difficult to entertain in  the ShM, though perhaps maimonides’ use of the term changed over time, and earlier  on, he had indeed used the term to refer to knowledge that is rationally demonstrable.  A not-fully-demonstrable belief in God, however, might fit with the more skeptical tone  of the GP. septimus, “What did maimonides mean by Madd’a?” 91n42. 113 . more precisely “lordship,” a term denoting power and mastery. Haggai ben-shammai  indicated to me in a private communication that the Arabic term, al-rububiyya, is  extremely rare in maimonides’ writings, neither appearing in maimonides’ Arabic  text of the thirteen principles nor even once in the GP. Based on a number of Islamic  sources, he suggested that the term can perhaps be rendered “lordship” or “divine  lordship.” For stylistic purposes, I adopted the term “divinity,” a close parallel to ha- eloqut, which is how the traditional translators have rendered this term.  114 . The efficient cause of a house, for example, is the builder, or more exactly, the idealized  form of the house in the builder’s soul. Chavel has “creator” instead of “cause” (Arabic  alpaal, Hebrew po‘el). According to Efros (Philosophical Terms, s. v. “po‘el”), the word  either means “efficient cause” or “doer.” Efros notes that “doer” “was chosen by the  mutakallimum with reference to the Creator rather than First Cause, which is the  Aristotelian name, because of their belief in the constant coexistence of the Cause and  the caused.” Both here and throughout the writing of the MT, maimonides deliberately  avoids using the simpler and more forthright term “the Creator.” He confirms this  usage in GP I:71 and in a late gloss to the fourth article of the Thirteen Articles of  Faith. The surprising implication of this formulation is that one can fulfill this  commandment without necessarily believing that God created the world. 115 . This is also how Abarbanel explained it in his rebuttal of Crescas, who thought that  in the ShM, maimonides was simply saying that one must affirm that God caused the  world to come into existence. don Hasdai Crescas (d.1412?) was a critic of Aristotle’s  philosophy and one of maimonides’ strongest medieval critics. see Crescas, or  Adonai, 3; and Abarbanel, Rosh Amanah, 71-72. For an analysis of Crescas’ critique of  maimonides on this and related matters, see Ben porat, “Emunot ve-de’ot le-mitsvot  le-da’at ha-RamBam ve-R. Hasdai Crescas,” 216-229. — 145 — </page> <page sequence="50"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- it is therefore more correct to say that maimonides believes the first  commandment to be the obligation to affirm the nature of the existence  of God. The phrase “the efficient cause of everything in existence” likely  refers to God in His capacity as prime mover. In Aristotelian terms,  God is thus defined as First Cause and prime mover. In the second  commandment, maimonides explicitly unifies these two qualities.  proof: maimonides’ proof text is the verse from Exodus 20:2-3, “I  am yHWH your God.” In his explication of the commandment, he goes  on to say that the proof that this statement represents a commandment  comes from R. simlai’s aggadah (which he cites verbatim): it reckons  this verse and the subsequent one, “Thou shalt have no other gods  before me” (Exod. 20:3), as part of the TaRYaG count.  maimonides learns two aspects of the deity from the biblical phrase  “I am yHWH your God [Elohekha]”: First Cause and prime mover.116 yet  he does not show how the phrase itself connects to these two qualities.  Which name of God would epitomize the quality of being the First  Cause, and which the prime mover?117 Not only the exegesis but also  the definition appears to be incomplete in the ShM, the gloss appearing  to represent perhaps only maimonides’ first attempt to define this  important dogma in a philosophically rigorous and complete form. As it is stated here, the commandment offers very imprecise  guidelines for action. What actions should one take to acquire this  belief? In the MT, and certainly in the GP, maimonides urges one  to study metaphysics in order to learn truths about the universe. If  one studies but fails to believe in God, would one have fulfilled the  116 . This reading represents philosophic eisegesis. more plausibly, the author of the aggadah  likely viewed “I am the lord, your God” as a commandment to believe in the God that  took the Israelites out of Egypt, the God of History rather than the First Cause. For  an interesting discussion on this point, see Harvey, “The First Commandment and the  God of History,” 203-216. 117 . Harvey reads maimonides as parsing this verse to account for both terms: YHWH is  the name that refers to God as the supreme Cause, and Elohekha refers to His being  “the cause of everything in existence.” Harvey, “The First Commandment and the God  of History,” 209. Though his interpretation is entirely plausible, there is no textual  support for it. I believe that Harvey was simply inserting the Halakhot’s exposition  into the ShM, as I will discuss later. — 146 — </page> <page sequence="51"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- commandment?118 Is one obligated to acquire this strong belief under  any circumstances? Additionally, maimonides does not define what  he means by “cause.” Hanna Kasher has observed that throughout his  works, maimonides uses this term in various ways, all consonant with  the multiple meanings that the term came to possess in Aristotle’s  works. In this particular case, the term could indicate final cause as  well as efficient cause.119 These questions and others are fundamental to a proper  understanding of the commandment. since maimonides warned in the  introduction of the ShM that the ShM was not going to be absolutely  precise nor necessarily complete in its formulations, one is tempted to  resort to the Halakhot for help in elaborating on and complementing  some of these inchoate formulations. unfortunately, this strategy  is methodologically flawed: one must consider the possibility that  maimonides had altered his views by the time he wrote the Halakhot� It  cannot thus be assumed that the Halakhot reflects his earlier thinking.120 118 . Abarbanel grapples with Crescas’ objection that commands imply choice, while  logically demonstrated truths leave no room for choice. If one knows, one must  believe — and therefore, genuine beliefs cannot be commanded. Abarbanel responds by  arguing that the command to believe should be understood as a command to prepare  oneself through studies that will (or might?) eventually lead to belief. one is thus  commanded to prepare oneself to believe. But does Abarbanel think that maimonides  maintains that studies will inevitably lead to believing in the nature of His existence?  And if his studies do not succeed in producing belief, has the faithful fulfilled the  commandment? Abarbanel does not say. see Abarbanel, Rosh Amana, 118-119. 119 . Kasher, “does ‘ought’ Imply ‘Can’ in maimonides?” 17-18. see also note 114 above.  The final cause of a house, for example, is its purpose or end (telos): the provision of  shelter. God may be the final cause of the universe in the sense that the universe is  moving toward actualization, living completely according to the will of God.  120 . Two small examples will suffice to make this point. First, on close reading, one  notes that the definition in the Halakhot varies slightly but meaningfully from the  one offered in the ShM: “The basic principle of all basic principles ...is that there is a  First Existent who brought every existing thing into being” (emphasis added). In the  Halakhot, maimonides seems here to posit God’s existence rather than to presuppose  it. Crescas also thought that there was a difference between the ShM’s formulation and  the Halakhot’s. Abarbanel did not accept this distinction and attempted to harmonize  both pronouncements. Abarbanel, Rosh Amanah, 70-72. second, the Halakhot differs  from the ShM in the way it parses the phrase “I am yHWH your lord”: “YHWH stands  for Necessary Being” (Hilkhot Yesode ha-Torah 1:1-4), while “Elohekha stands for God  of the universe and lord of the earth, the one who controls the sphere of the universe,  the mover” (ibid., 1:5). — 147 — </page> <page sequence="52"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- p2. To acknowledge His unity,121 as it is said, “The lord our God, the  lord is one” (deut. 6:4). This is the second of the two beliefs that maimonides innovatively  introduces in the enumeration of commandments. more specifically,  the ShM reads, “We are commanded in the belief of unity,122 that is to  say, to believe that the cause of all things in existence and their first  cause is one.” What was stated only in passing in p1 is now stated  explicitly: God, the First Cause, is also the prime mover.123  proof: maimonides maintains that the injunction is contained in  the phrase “Hear o Israel: the lord our God, the lord is one” (deut.  6:4). In support of this claim, he writes:  In most midrashim you will find this explained as meaning that we are  to declare the unity of God’s name, or the unity of God, or something  of that kind. The intention of the sages was to teach that God brought  us out of Egypt and heaped kindness upon us only on condition that we  121 . literally, “to unify Him” (le-yahado). The Arabic equivalent of unification, tawhid, “is a  term applied to the belief, or the profession of faith, in one God” (GP, ed. pines, I:35,  81 n. 4). I used Hyamson’s translation of yihud as “unity” because it matches Efros,  Philosophical Terms, 57, s. v. “yihud,” although “oneness” may convey a slightly more  precise philosophical understanding. In general, I have used the words “oneness” and  “unity” interchangeably in this work.  122 . Hebrew, be-emunat ha-yihud. Arabic, b-itikad al-tuhid. I have already discussed the  Arabic term itikad in connection with p1, showing that it represents firm conviction.  Chavel translated the sentence as “to believe in the unity of God,” but the added words  are not in the original text. 123 . As he did with respect to p1, maimonides changes this definition in the Halakhot (see  above, note 122) in this case rather dramatically. In Hilkhot Yesode ha-Torah 1:7, he  writes: “This God is one ... so that none of the things existing in the universe to which  the term one is applied is like unto His unity; neither such a unit as a species which  comprises many units, nor such a unit as a physical body which consists of parts and  dimensions. His unity is such that there is no other unity like it in the world.” He  does not mention the unity of the First Cause and the prime mover. Harvey asserts  that while Hilkhot Yesode ha-Torah 1:5 and 1:7 identify the prime mover with God, 2:3  and 3:1 disprove this identification (and so, he notes, does GP II:4). He claims that  ultimately, maimonides does not identify the prime mover with God. This position  is supported by the different definitions of “unity” in the ShM and in the Halakhot.  Harvey, “The Mishneh Torah as a Key to the secrets of the Guide,” 17-19. I am indebted  to marc shapiro for helping me refine this point and for referring me to Harvey’s  article.  — 148 — </page> <page sequence="53"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- believe in His unity, which is our bounden duty. The commandment to  believe in God’s unity [mitsvat yihud] is mentioned in many places, and  the sages also call this commandment “Kingdom” [malkhut], for they  speak of the obligation “to take upon oneself the yoke of the Kingdom  of Heaven [le-qabbel ’alav ol malkhut shamayim],” that is to say, to declare  God’s unity and to believe in Him. maimonides struggles to find a source for this independent  commandment. He introduces the term mitsvat yihud,124 stating  that the commandment is “mentioned in many places,” and that this  commandment is the equivalent of taking upon oneself the yoke of the  Kingdom of Heaven. perla points out that the referenced midrashim  relate to the declaration of unity made while reciting the shema — a  commandment separately enumerated as p10. Furthermore, perla  notes that neither of the cited expressions, mitsvat yihud or mitsvat  malkhut, which could have been read as commandment markers, are in  evidence in the midrashim.125  The expression “to take upon oneself the yoke of the Kingdom of  Heaven” comes from M Berakhot 2:2, where it serves as justification  for reciting the shema before reciting the section “And it shall come  to pass if ye shall hearken” (deut. 11:13-21). one must accept the  yoke of Heaven, symbolized by the first paragraph of the shema,  before one accepts the performance of the commandments (meqabbel  ‘alav ‘ol mitsvot), symbolized by the second paragraph� However we  understand the idea of accepting the yoke of Heaven — and it is often  read as offering one’s life and possessions for God’s sake (martyrdom,  qiddush ha-Shem)126 — it is difficult to equate such a pious expression of  acceptance with a mandate to believe in His unity. Kafih’s explanation,  124 . We see here again that maimonides uses the term mitsvat-X to prove a commandment  claim. see the discussion of this marker in chapter 2. 125 . perla, Sefer ha-Mitsvot le-RaSaG, vol. 1, 141-142. see also Sefer ha-Mitsvot, ed. Kafih,  ad loc., n. 11, regarding mitsvat yihud. Confirming their observations, I conducted a  quick search of rabbinic literature and did not encounter a single use of the term  mitsvat yihud in the extant literature. While it may have existed in lost texts, it is hard  to square an occasional mention with the statement that it is found in “many places.” 126 . Note that the acceptance of the yoke is qualified by the phrase “with all your heart,  with all your soul and with all your resources.” In BT Berakhot 61b, a tanna interprets  “with all your soul” to mean “even if he takes your soul.” — 149 — </page> <page sequence="54"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- “one cannot adequately accept the yoke of Heaven without first  recognizing the truth of His unity” does no more than beg the question.  The talmudic dictum to which maimonides refers states that the  order of the shema’s sections allows one to “first accept the yoke of  Heaven and then one can accept the yoke of commandments.” In Hilkhot  Qeriyat Shema 1:2, maimonides reformulates this dictum, stating that  one recites the first section of the shema first “because there is in [the  section] the unity of God, the love for Him, and the study [talmudo]  of Him. This is the great and essential matter on which all depends.”127  This reformulation matches his statement in the ShM that to accept the  yoke of Heaven is to believe in His unity. Regardless which formulation  of the dictum we use, maimonides clearly maintains that the scriptural  commandment consists of internalizing the belief in His unity, rather  than proclaiming it (as the rabbinic sources imply).128  Conspicuously absent from this commandment’s argumentative  apparatus is the aggadah about the 613 commandments. As we saw  earlier, maimonides interprets this aggadah to indicate that the words  spoken directly by God, “I” and “Thou shalt not have,” conveyed two  principles: the existence and the unity of God. perhaps he fails to quote  “Thou shalt not have” as a proof text for this commandment because  that injunction is negatively phrased. since positive commandments  must be phrased in the positive, “Thou shalt not have” cannot be used  as a proof text. Nevertheless, maimonides certainly relies on this  aggadah to define his commandment, which otherwise finds no echo  in rabbinic sources.  maimonides’ ethico-philosophical approach informs the concept  of God’s unity and compels him to find a place for it in the TaRYaG  constellation. The goal of the commandment “to unify Him” is to acquire  127 . At least two commentators struggled to understand maimonides’ reformulation: Isaac  Almosonino, ’Edut BiYehosef, and david luria, Yad David, both cited by Kafih in his  commentary. Mishneh Torah, ed. Kafih, Hilkhot Qeriyat Shema 1:2. 128 . Neither Qayyara nor any of the other geonic enumerators understood the  commandment to declare the unity of God as entailing anything other than the  recitation of the shema. see Qayyara, pq1; Elijah ha-Zaqen in Sefer Mitsvot he-Arukh,  184, p29; al-Bargeloni in Sefer Mitsvot he-Arukh, 228, p1-p2; sa‘adiah Gaon, Sefer ha- Mitsvot, ps3-ps4; Ibn Gabirol, Zohar ha-Raqia, 5, p1, Also see the discussion of the  commandment to recite the shema below, in chapter 8. — 150 — </page> <page sequence="55"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- the basic beliefs for attaining intellectual virtue and “through which  the ultimate perfection may be obtained.” In his efforts to add this  commandment to his list, maimonides subtly reinterprets a tannaitic  statement that more literally concerns praxis, the recitation of the shema,  rather than doxa, the belief in His unity. He transforms the monotheistic  affirmation into an obligatory dogma and then moves to add a second  and related commandment, that of reciting the shema twice daily (p10).  Would scripture, on maimonides’ reading, have mandated an obligation  to recite the unity of God, even as it has already mandated the faithful  to apprehend His unity? In chapter 8, we will resolve this apparent  superfluity by positing the existence of two distinct legal sources. * * * perhaps here is the place to take a small detour and reflect on what it  means to introduce dogma as a religious duty. When reviewing these  two commandments of belief, one is struck by how difficult they are to  understand and thus how impractical they are for the average religious  practitioner. While the ShM may not be a fully formed halakhic work,  as we noted earlier and as maimonides had himself admitted, the same  cannot be said with respect to the MT, which was intended to be not  only a comprehensive but also a practical legal code. And yet, even  after reading the MT, one is left wondering how the faithful reader  is to go about fulfilling these highly sophisticated commandments of  belief. If one cannot understand the philosophic definitions attached  to these dogmas, can one still fulfill these two commandments? should  one conclude that maimonides was an elitist who only addressed the  cognoscenti? In his introduction to the MT, maimonides states that his  intention is to make the law accessible to all — “the young and the old.”129  129 . m. m. schneerson notes that maimonides presents in the Halakhot general  foundational principles that nevertheless fall short of what the talmudic rabbis called  “the heads of the topics” (BT Hagigah 13a), since the latter can be communicated only  to an individual who is “wise and able to draw conclusions independently” (as per  Hilkhot Yesode ha-Torah 2:12, 4:10-11). At the beginning of studying Torah, everyone  must know these principles. see schneerson, “mitsvat yedi‘at ha-shem,” vol. 2, siman  22 (5745), 136 and 145. — 151 — </page> <page sequence="56"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- If this statement of intention is only remotely true, one would have to  conclude that the religious person need not be a philosopher to affirm  these two theological propositions and consider him or herself to have  satisfied these commandments.  Kellner suggests that maimonides writes for a variety of  audiences simultaneously “without drawing explicit attention to that  fact.” He writes for talmudists with no background in philosophy, for  talmudists who aspire to become philosophers, and for philosophers,  all at once. When talmudists read maimonides’ works, because of  the context, vocabulary and style, they think “they are reading a  wholly traditional text, totally unobjectionable, and fully consistent  with conventional religion as popularly understood.” The more  philosophically sophisticated reader, however, can read the same  passage and find in it “statements consistent with some of the more  daring maimonidean theses expressed (later) in the Guide of the  Perplexed.”130 The faithful, uninitiated in philosophical matters, would  gain the basic ideas that the belief in God is a foundational belief, that  God is characterized as the creator of all things, and that everything  derives its existence from God and cannot exist without Him.131 They  would also learn that God’s unity is unlike any other kind of unity,  and that it necessarily precludes His being corporeal. Finally, they  would learn that the belief in God’s unity is also foundational, that  “God brought us out of Egypt and heaped kindness upon us only on  condition that we believe in His unity.”132  In the previous section, I referred to a passage in GP II:33 in which  maimonides reveals the deep secret hidden in the aggadah of R. simlai  and what it tells us about the revelation at sinai. Embedded in the  content of the philosophical revelation, however, is a key pedagogical  130 . Kellner, “The literary Character of the mishneh Torah,” 30-31. This in no way implies  that maimonides intended to deceive his unsophisticated audience. Rather, as a master  pedagogue, he allowed the reader to climb the ladder of religious sophistication.  maimonides does demand a minimum understanding of the foundational beliefs.  For example, he insists that “children, women, stupid ones, and those of a defective  natural disposition” be taught basic principles such as the incorporeity of God, despite  their inability to prove these doctrines (GP I:35, 81). 131 . Kellner, “The literary Character of the mishneh Torah,” 33. 132 . ShM, p2. — 152 — </page> <page sequence="57"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- approach. maimonides comments that while all Israel heard the “voice  of words” (deut. 4:12) at sinai — that same voice through which moses  and Israel learned the doctrines of “I” and “Thou shalt not have” — not  everyone understood the message equally. “Know,” he says, “that with  regard to that voice too, their rank was not equal to the rank of moses  our master.” Each member of the Israelite nation heard the principles  as befitted his or her level of philosophical sophistication. Everyone,  even those totally uninitiated in philosophical matters, heard the two  principles, and understood them in their own ways.133  The varying levels of understanding of the heterogeneous crowd at  sinai offers a working model for the pedagogic presentation of the two  foundational credos. despite their physical and intellectual constraints,  with proper training and effort, the philosophically uneducated can  reach higher levels of understanding of the divine, eventually coming  to love and fear God. In the MT, maimonides offers a minimum  definition of what one must believe and affirm to fulfill these two  commandments.134 As Kellner has shown, however, these definitions  can be heard and understood in many different, even non-philosophical  ways. still, as the sinaitic model teaches, the unenlightened faithful  will no doubt have satisfied the religious obligation. maimonides would  nevertheless recommend that the person who wishes to fulfill these  commandments in an optimal manner should read and re-read these  definitions, while getting a deeper appreciation through a systematic  study of the sciences of logic and metaphysics.    133 . maimonides states in the GP (III:27, 510) that the welfare of the soul “consists in  the multitude’s acquiring correct opinions corresponding to their respective capacity”  (emphasis added). These pedagogic tendencies were not always appreciated. samuel  ibn Tibbon, his main translator and student, attacked maimonides for presuming  that the masses could rise to the philosophical heights of attaining a proper  understanding of divine matters, suggesting instead that they be taught to believe  in the God who took them out of Egypt, the God of History. see Frankel, “ma‘avar  le-Talmid Ne‘eman,” 61-82 134 . In this respect, maimonides, the pedagogue, imitated the law, which had presented  these notions in “a summary way” (GP III:28, 512)� see the discussion of the  commandment to love God in chapter 9. As we shall see there, the commandments  to love and fear God are but extensions of the first two commandments, rather than  separate commandments. — 153 — </page> <page sequence="58"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- somE ClosING REFlECTIoNs oN SEfER HA-MITSvoT Before we move to the second half of this book, which will deal almost  exclusively with the MT, it might be in order to make a few concluding  remarks about the focus of our work to this point, the Sefer Ha-Mitsvot.  The ShM represents maimonides’ first attempt to unravel, identify, and  interpret the complete corpus of scriptural law.135 This hermeneutic  interest continued to engage his attention for at least another 25  years, during which time he composed the MT, the GP, and the Essay  on Resurrection, among other minor essays and letters. As befits a  great thinker, maimonides frequently brought new interpretative  insights to old material, and so we find, for example, that many of the  ShM’s initial claims were tweaked, changed, or even omitted in the MT  and the GP� At the same time, he never ceased to make revisions to  all his literary creations even after he had completed them, witnessed  by the existence of a number of extant versions of some of his works.  Nevertheless, it can be said that each of the stages of maimonides’  literary activity, always infused with original and creative ideas,  represents a finality of sorts, each reveals a possibility persuasively  dressed in conclusive garb, and yet none give the impression of being  truly conclusive, if only because one senses that maimonides continues  to find new ways to read texts. That is why the ShM can stand on its  own, despite later revisions.  The ShM has a character all of its own. It is distinctively a rhetorical  work, making bold claims and briefly supporting these claims with  scriptural and rabbinic texts. It is uniquely a methodological work,  synthesizing and fitting a vast body of rabbinic material into a  number of taxonomic principles. And it is a uniquely popular work,  written in the Judeo-Arabic vernacular, favoring broad and general  definitions and stating them in a simple and uncomplicated form.136  135 . I use the phrase “scriptural law” here to contrast with the oral law, to which  maimonides dedicated the commentary to the mishnah.  136 . We already saw that while the MT may also be directed to a popular audience, it  contains language and hints that operate on a highly sophisticated level, often intended  to accommodate more than one meaning. see Kellner, “The literary Character,” 29- 45. For more on this manner of writing, see Henshke, “on the Question of unity in  — 154 — </page> <page sequence="59"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- By maimonides’ own admission, the ShM is often imprecise, as  if in a hurry to be completed, but for that reason it tends towards  valuable first impressions, raw ideas that lack the full complexity  and casuistry of talmudic discussions or the rigours and detainment  required for harmonizing disparate passages, but which reveal the  author’s immediate and favorite concerns. In common with some of  his other works, and despite its avowed brevity, the ShM is didactic,  presenting a fair number of important and original theological,  juridical, historiographical, and politico-philosophical ideas. Because  the ShM is a popular work, it addresses a wide audience. It sets out  to instruct Rabbanites, to edify readers of scripture unfamiliar with  rabbinic midrash,137 to polemicize against Karaite sympathizers and  committed Karaites,138 and to impress enlightened muslims and  muslim colleagues.139  The ShM is not only an important work of halakhah, but it is also an  important work in the history of Jewish thought. In composing the MT,  maimonides both builds on the TaRYaG framework he had developed  and revisits many of the views he held in the ShM. In the chapters that  follow, I shall explore how he reinterprets, redefines and reorders much  of the earlier material, offering a much more nuanced view of the law.  I will also analyze a dichotomy that has lain dormant for centuries in  the subtle crevices of maimonides’ exquisite language: maimonides the  jurist versus maimonides the legal philosopher.  maimonides’ Thought,” 37-52. For a philosophical appreciation of the MT, see Twersky,  Introduction to the Code of Maimonides, 356-507; pines, “The philosophical purport,”  1-14; and Harvey, “The Mishneh Torah as a Key to the secrets of the Guide,” 11-28. 137 . Replying to a correspondent who questioned maimonides’ interpretation of scripture  in the matter of one of his commandment claims (p8), Abraham maimonides writes:  “in this regard, we, the congregation of Rabbanites differ from the way of the Karaites.”  While the inquirer may or may not have been a Karaite, he was certainly a close reader  of scripture who appreciated the Rules of the ShM but may have been unfamiliar with  rabbinic midrash. see Abraham maimonides, “Teshuvot Rabbenu Abraham ben ha- RamBam,” siman 63.  138 . For example, see maimonides’ lengthy disquisition at p153, discussed below in chapter  7. Also see maimonides’ comments at p109 and his reference to the “true book.” 139 .

In this appendix, I wander outside of my  self-imposed universe of positive commandments and examine the  claim that prohibits the drinking of libation wine (N194). I shall argue  that this commandment supports my thesis that the enumeration  of the commandments is first and foremost an outline of scriptural  themes. I find implicit support for this view from no less than one of  the most prominent medieval authorities on matters of enumeration,  simeon b. Tsemah duran, author of the Zohar ha-Raqia.  The SE version of N194 reads as follows: “Not to drink libation wine  [yein nesekh] [of idolaters], as it is said, ‘Which did eat the fat of their  sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink-offering’ [deut. 32:38].”  In the ShM, maimonides, following BT ‘Avodah Zarah 29b, glosses:  “this shows that the prohibition which applies to sacrifices offered to  an idol applies likewise to libation-wine.” maimonides’ unusually long  evidentiary discussion following this gloss evinces a certain degree of  discomfort with the proposed argument.  Nahmanides’ critique of the argument deals primarily with  maimonides’ interpretation of the sources he cites. For the most part,  the critique is not immediately relevant to our concerns. What draws  our attention, however, is Nahmanides’ remark that this prohibition  is already included in N25. That prohibition, as formulated in the SE,  reads as follows: “Not to make use of an idol, or its accessory objects, or  its offerings, or its libations, as it is said, ‘Neither shalt thou bring an  abomination into thy house’ [deut. 7:26].” Nahmanides notes: It is surprising that he, may his memory be blessed, takes the trouble  to demonstrate in this gloss that the prohibition to drink libation wine  — 156 — </page> <page sequence="61"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- is scriptural, even though, according to him, libation wine is already  included in the rubric of offerings to an idol, from which even benefit is  prohibited by scriptural dint.140  In other words, N194 is redundant. Nahmanides also rejects the possibility that the claim might be  justified on the basis of its punishment, namely, that drinking libation  wine is punishable with a third set of lashes in addition to the two sets of  lashes for deriving benefit from idolatrous offerings. He argues that even  if we were to grant that drinking libation wine is prohibited separately  from deriving benefit from it, and thus punishable with additional  lashes, maimonides does not provide an adequate scriptural proof text  for this new prohibition. This is because maimonides disqualified laws  derived from scripture through the use of hermeneutic rules.141 It is  true that the Talmud makes an analogy (heqesh) between libation wine  and sacrifices offered to an idol on the basis of deuteronomy 32:38,  but such analogies are not valid evidence on which to base a scriptural  commandment claim, despite maimonides’ quoting it.142  140 . Hasagot, 352. Note that, at N25, the ShM mentions the prohibition against deriving  benefit from “anything attributed to idolatry,” but does not mention the prohibition  on libation wine. Nahmanides identified “anything attributed to idolatry” with  offerings to idols and then assumed that libation wine was included in the general  prohibition of offerings. Nevertheless, Nahmanides is aware of and actually cites the  SE, which mentions libation wine explicitly. 141 . see the discussion of Rule 2 in chapter 7. 142 . While Isaac de leon (in Megillat Esther, ad loc.) argues, contra Nahmanides, that he  who drinks libation wine incurs an additional set of lashes because the new prohibition  is unrelated to the prohibition against deriving benefit from idolatrous practices, his  thesis runs afoul of a serious problem. maimonides never produces a proof text for  this commandment in the form of an admonition (as Nahmanides argues). Even if  we follow Rule 14 and grant that one can use a hermeneutically-derived prohibitive  admonition to justify a commandment when there is evidence that scripture intends  to punish the transgressor (see applications in N9, N26, N60, N195, N318, N319) — as  suggested by de leon — this does not appear to be the case here. No punishment is  prescribed in deuteronomy 32:38 for one who drinks libation wine. The passage  merely describes the activity attributed to these foreign gods: “they did eat the fat of  their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink-offerings.” The absence of an explicit  punishment for those who drink libation wine as well as the absence of a properly  formulated admonition leaves us with only one possibility: the passage cited by  maimonides compares libation wine to idolatrous sacrifices merely to teach that just  as it is prohibited to derive benefit from the latter (under N25), so too it is prohibited  — 157 — </page> <page sequence="62"> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  Chapter V  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- To complement the above argument, Nahmanides takes aim at  maimonides from yet another direction. He points out that one would  not escape the charges of redundancy by positing that N194 comes to  teach that an additional set of lashes is due to one who drinks libation  wine, even if one could find another admonishing text. This is because  maimonides had made it clear in a number of cases that no more than  one set of lashes may be administered, even where scripture enjoins one  repeatedly from committing the same act.143 since drinking libation wine  is included in the prohibition against deriving benefit from the wine,  only one set of lashes can be prescribed, even if we were to find a new  prohibitive admonition. The redundancy of N194 is once again exposed.  The simplest answer to this crux is that the prohibition against  deriving benefit from libation wine, as a sacrifice offered to an idol,  should be first mentioned in, and traced to, the laws of idolatry. A  full discussion of it as a forbidden food, however, should be reserved  for the treatise on forbidden foods.144 If a topical outline is to be  useful in helping organize a code of law, it would have to deal with the  prohibition against drinking libation wine separate and apart from the  to derive benefit from libation wine. But this conclusion itself is problematic: why  would we need a special analogy to prohibit the use of libation wine if it is no different  from sacrifices offered to an idol? And if the latter is prohibited under N25, why would  libation wine not be included in the same admonition? moreover, maimonides also  includes libation wine in that prohibition, as we saw.  drawing on the language of the Halakhot, Isaac Gatinio (Bet Ishaq [salonika, 1792],  36), offers a more plausible suggestion: it is prohibited to derive any benefit from all  types of sacrifices offered to idols, including libation wine, under penalty of lashes  (Hilkhot ‘Avodah Zarah 7:2). If and when these sacrifices are edible, however, benefit  is only derived when one eats (or drinks) them (Maakhalot Asurot 11:1, based on  Maakhalot Asurot 8:16). Any other form of benefit is not liable for lashes. While this  explanation has the benefit of a reasonable fit with the language of the Halakhot, it  still leaves unanswered the ultimate question: why was it necessary for maimonides  to enumerate the special prohibition of N194? Why was it not a detail of N25?  143 . “Furthermore, according to the master, multiplicity of prohibitions does not translate  into multiple lashes.” Hasagot, 352. For this principle, see Rule 9, and his discussion on  pages 157-159. For one of the applications of this principle, see N179 (last paragraph  on page 346) where maimonides counts the prohibition against eating swarming  creatures as a single negative commandment, despite there being many (“even [if He  warned as many as] one thousand times”) injunctions against eating these creatures. 144 . The importance of libation wine and its derivatives as a forbidden food cannot be  gainsaid; its laws cover three full chapters in the MT�  — 158 — </page> <page sequence="63"> -----------------------------------------------------   INNoVATIVE CommANdmENTs   ----------------------------------------------------- laws that discuss the basis for its prohibition. Through this lens, N194  is not a redundant claim. simeon b. Tsemah duran appears to concur with this conclusion.  After pointing out that maimonides does not offer a scripturally-based  admonition for this commandment, but merely gives a cryptic analogy  to sacrifices, he suggests that:  It was not the intention of maimonides to count this prohibition as an  independent prohibition among the 613 commandments; for when he  counted the commandments [in his Short Enumeration], he included [this  prohibition] among the rest of the prohibitions related to idolatry, under  “and there shall cleave naught (of the accurse thing) to thine hand” [N24]  and “neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thy house” [N25].  Rather, he wanted to include this prohibition among the special laws of  forbidden foods, and [or but] this prohibition is the same prohibition  that includes all the rest of the prohibitions related to idolatry. Note that  he did not offer a new proof-text.145  In the arch-conservative world of rabbinic halakhah, the implications  of what duran suggests are nothing less than revolutionary: not all  of the 613 enumerated commandment advanced by maimonides are  intended as independent commandments. some may simply represent  organizational notations to help outline his later work.  145 . That is, duran continues to maintain that the deuteronomy 32:38 passage does not  qualify as a genuine prohibition, given its form.
