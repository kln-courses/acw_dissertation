<plain_text><page sequence="1">EARLY CULTURES OF ATLANTIC EUROPE By C. DARYLL FORDE T HE study of European prehistory began with a linear historical classification of major periods- of chipped stone, polished stone and bronze. It was soon recognized that more subtle distinctions and sub- divisions were necessary in the presentation of the early advances of human culture, but attempts to give breadth to this one-dimensional scheme were long delayed, and the efforts of Breuil, Obermaier and others to map out the distributions and regional variations of paleolithic cultures are but slowly being reflected in the general body of scientific thought. Stranger still, however, a series of later cultures in which more abundant material affords the opportunity for discrimination based on the variations of elaborate artefacts such as pottery, are viewed by all but a small band of specialists as falling into a broad category known as the neolithic. Recognition was but slowly accorded to the occurrence of copper implements in certain of these pre-bronze age cultures and even then when the terms "eneolithic" or "chalcolithic" had come into current use, the real significance of the early copper-using cultures as, in many instances, the progenitors of "neolithic" cultures was entirely missed and the develop- ment of agriculture, pottery and settled habitation was regarded vaguely as the achievements of new races which moved in undifferentiated groups into lands freed from the grip of ice. The field aspects of these later cultures differ fundamentally from the paleolithic in two important features which can scarcely be overestimated- the far more infrequent occurrence of stratified sites and the preponderance of material obtained from burial sites over that from habitations. Yet de- spite the scarcity of invaluable stratigraphic data it is actually possible at the present time to attempt a far more detailed delimitation of culture pro- vinces and lines of movement for the so-called "neolithic" and "chalco- lithic" periods than may ever be possible for the paleolithic. Although the old hiatus once believed to have existed between paleolithic and "neolithic" times has now been bridged by the discovery of the post-Magdalenian cultures referred to collectively as mesolithic or epipaleolithic,1 it yet remains true that the establishment of the so-called 1 The term epipaleolithic, although clumsy, is the more suitable since these cultures are not functionally intermediate, and do indeed represent the final efforts of paleolithic groups. 19</page><page sequence="2">20 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 32, 1930 "neolithic" cultures in Europe represented a real break in historical continuity. There is very definite evidence for almost every region that the appearance of agriculture, pottery, and polished stone tools, was not due to the slow experimenting of epipaleolithic groups, but to the arrival of new peoples of distinct cultural tradition who had practised these crafts before their penetration of western Europe in the ameliorated climatic conditions of the sub-Boreal phase. The routes and periods by which these elements of the new cultures were propagated varied considerably in different areas. Although it is probable that in some areas epipaleolithic groups acquired such arts as pottery-making by slow diffusion, the major process was one of coloniza- tion by new peoples. Successions of communities propagated one from another, moving along the riverways, crossing heathland and moor and skirting the dense post-glacial forests, established themselves in new territory that was virtually empty. Some elements in the later epipaleolithic industries are most satis- factorily accounted for by the arrival of a vanguard of neolithic folks among relatively numerous epipaleolithic survivors. The variations already developed in the "neolithic" provinces of southern and eastern Europe, the distinctiveness of the various cultures surviving from the old stone age and above all the different conditions, geographical and cultural, under which the new contacts were effected, resulted in blends of distinct charac- ter which were themselves extended over considerable areas. Pottery first appears sporadically in western Europe in later epipale- olithic cultures shortly before the establishment of true "neolithic" settlements. It is difficult to believe that dwindling remnants of food- gatherers would have independently discovered the art of pottery and per- haps the elements of agricultural practice at the very period when peoples among whom these crafts were well established were extending westwards across Europe and already lay at their threshold. These theoretical considerations are further strengthened by a con- sideration of the epipaleolithic cultures themselves. Since Piette's iden- tification of a distinct post-Magdalenian, pre-Neolithic layer at the entrance to Mas d'Azil (Aribge, France)2 the distribution and relationships of the various cultures have been provisionally established. The Tardenoisean phase is characterised by microlithic flint industries. The microlith or pigmy flint was especially developed in consequence of the adoption of a composite tool in which small flint blades were set in wood or bone. This development is variously claimed to have taken place 2 Assoc. frangaise pour l'avancement des sciences, Pau, 1892.</page><page sequence="3">FORDE] CULTURES OF ATLANTIC EUROPE 21 in the western Mediterranean or in northern Africa. While the Solutreans and Magdalenians successively occupied western and central Europe, the Aurignacian culture continued relatively undisturbed further to the south. Burkitt3 lays great stress on the development shown in the strati- fication in the Grotte des Enfants, Mentone, since Tardenoisean types may here be seen slowly emerging from older Aurignacian forms. Early microlithic industries have been discovered elsewhere in this immediate area especially in southern Italy (Romanelli, Otranto) and Sicily (Termine Imerese). Obermaier4 and Bosch Gimpera,5 however, insist on a North African origin for these industries, and believe them to have been originally introduced into Europe by extensive and prolonged migrations of Capsians from northwest Africa into the Iberian peninsula. Contemporaneous and in some areas blending with the Tardenoisean was the culture represented at Mas d'Azil. Childe6 rightly insists on the distinctness of the Azilian culture as a degeneration from the Magdalenian. The purest Azilian stations are characterised not by microliths but by numerous rough bone harpoons made, like the Cantabrian harpoons of Magdalenian date, of deer horn andperforated for hafting, and Azilian flint types can be similarly related to the Spanish Magdalenian.7 The relations between the Azilian and Tardenoisean cultures are difficult to define since the latter has rarely been found in a well defined stratigraphical sequence. Both were, however, directly continuous from preceding, if distinct, paleolithic cultures. Composite tools with their associated microlithic industry were prop- agated northwards in the wake of the retreating reindeer in the warming climate of post-Magdelenian times. They were introduced over the greater part of Europe, continued in use throughout the kitchen-midden period, and survived in many of the later, neolithic, settlements. (Figs. 1 and 2.) In the Baltic area, which had been closed to man throughout the glacial period, the microlithic technique appears in the Maglemosean culture8 of the first occupants.

Bosch-</page><page sequence="5">1ORDE] CULTURES OF ATLANTIC EUROPE 23 Gimpera suggests "Capsian" intermixture to account for the microlithic industry. Burkitt while admitting the close parallels between Mag- lemosean and Tardenoisean in the use of flint, yet claims that like the Tardenoisean [the Maglemosean] was aware of the advantages of a com- posite tool, but there is no reason for interrelating the two cultures.' But it is, on the contrary, highly improbable that two adjacent cultural provinces should at the same period independently conceive and develop an instrument so specialized as the composite flint and wood or bone tool. Burkitt has himself adduced evidence for the slow development of micro- lithic technique in the Mediterranean area and since the Maglemoseans cannot have penetrated northward into the Baltic region before the retreat of the Yoldia Sea and the beginning of Ancylus times, there can be little doubt that their ancestors previously lived within the sphere of Azilio- Tardenoisean culture; for we have definite evidence that the Tardenoisean culture, as such, penetrated effectively into Poland and south Russia in the east and as far north as the British Isles. Furthermore Koslowski10 has shown that some of the characteristic traits of Maglemose also occur in epipaleolithic cultures of northeastern Europe. This suggests that the Maglemoseans reached Scandinavia from the southeast and that some elements of their culture are to be traced back to the upper palaeolithic of Moravia. It is, in any case, clear that the Maglemosean culture rep- resents a further extension of the southern epipaleolithic, with which were amalgamated other elements, such as the superior technique in bonework, which may have been contributed by upper paleolithic groups in north central Europe. At a later stage there followed a remarkable adaptation to the abundant shell life in the warming waters of the Atlantic shores. A series of coastal settlements, which have left evidence of their occupation in large kitchen- middens of shell debris, extended from Portugal to the Baltic. The abun- dance of pigmy flintwork in the lower levels of the shell mounds indicates that everywhere they were established by Azilio-Tardenoisean folk. At Mughem (Cabezo d'Aruda etc.) in Portugal a late Tardenoisean date is indicated by the presence of the trapeze from the lowest levels. Chisel- bladed ("transverse") arrowheads are also claimed for the Portugese shell mounds." This type of arrowhead does not appear further north in Europe until Ertebolle and Campigynan times. The Mughem type is ' Burkitt, Our Early Ancestors, p. 39. o10 Koslowski, L., L'Epoque mesolithique en Pologne, L'Anthropologie, 36, 1926. 1 Childe, Dawn, p. 4 and fig. 2.</page><page sequence="6">24 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 32, 1930 distinct from these late forms and may be merely a Capsian trapeze, but the appearance of such arrowheads in the early Portuguese shell mounds would present no difficulty since the chisel-edged arrowhead was in use in Upper Egypt from early predynastic times and early diffused westwards in North Africa.12 The coastal settlements of the Landes and the shores of Bas Medoc (France) may be earlier still since triangles and micro-burins (pigmy gravers) abound, but the trapeze is not well developed.13 Similar industries extend further north along the French coast around the estuary of the Loire (Buttes de Rocher, Gu~rande) and in southern Finistbre (La Torche, Ile de Sein, etc.).14 In the Baltic area the shell mounds (Ertebolle) succeed the Magle- mosean culture and proceed directly from it. The continuity is so close that it is difficult to consider the Danish kitchen-middens as directly related to the shell mounds of the Atlantic coast. It is not impossible, however, that shell mound folk from the Atlantic, penetrating the Baltic area, produced the Danish kitchen-midden culture by taking over the characteristic Maglemosean stone and bone tools. Since, however, apart from microlithic flintwork, which was common to the greater part of Europe at this time, there are no direct links between the ill-defined cul- tures of the earlier Atlantic shell mounds and the Danish kitchen-middens, such a suggestion rests only on similarity of habitat and approximate contemporaneity. But the Danish midden culture also affords evidence of close connection with other early settlements. In the more interior districts of western Europe a further specialization appeared in the Campignyan culture, of which numerous habitations have been found in northeastern France and Belgium.'" This culture which has frequently been misrepresented as 12 Cf. Childe, The Most Ancient East, 1928, p. 69. 13 Cf. Burkitt, M.

C6tes du Nord, 1881. 15 Confusion as to the position of the Campignyan culture has been occasioned largely by the frequent survival of Campignyan tools in neolithic settlements. Furthermore, the excavations of the original site near Bouillancourt-en-Siry, Seine Inf~rieure, were not well controlled and the conditions there are uncertain. Neolithic elements including polished stone celts and sherds were among the material recovered, but it is uncertain whether the station itself was late and mixed or whether stray, surface neolithic material was confused with material from the hut foundations proper. But the existence of a well defined inland culture parallel with the shellmounds can be hardly doubted for the characteristic tools have been reported from closed finds over a wide area in north eastern Europe; see Capitan, L., Le Cam- pignien, Rev. Ecole Anthrop. de Paris, 1898.</page><page sequence="7">FORDE] CULTURES OF ATLANTIC EUROPE 25 early, in the sense of incipient, neolithic, is remarkable for the development of simple but effective chipped tools, the Campigny pick and hatchet. The workmanship required was not of high order but the economy of means whereby a sharp and tolerably straight edge was produced in the hatchet indicates decided originality and emancipation from the paleolithic tradition. This form occurs occasionally in Maglemosean stations, but whether such stations are late and the hatchets intrusive cannot yet be determined. It is possible, although unlikely, that the form was first developed in the Baltic area. Roughly shaping a piece of flint or stone to flat triangular form, a large flake was struck off at the broad end, leaving a cutting edge between the new surface and the underside of the flint. ;*&amp;$&amp; i: \j\iUi FIG. 3. Campignyan axe-hatchets. (after D~chelette) (Fig.3.) The chisel-bladed arrowhead which is also abundant in Campignyan settlements was produced with a similar technique. For the rest, the stone work consists of rough picks, scrapers and awls and occasional small gravers. Well characterized microliths and the composite tool were probably absent.'" The Baltic kitchen-middens already referred to were closely related to the Campignyan culture; hatchets, arrow-points, picks and awls of Campigny type are abundant. Although there is little evidence to indicate the relative dates of the cultures, it is generally assumed that the distri- bution of these forms indicates Campignyan intrusion in the Baltic area as a strong formative influence on the midden culture. 16 Campignyan forms survived in many backward settlements of neolithic and even later times, and the hatchet is by no means always a certain guide to the date of its context. cf. Childe, V. G., Dawn, p. 18.</page><page sequence="8">26 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 32, 1930 In all these industries so far reviewed there is no trace of the true neo- lithic arts. The only domestic animal is the dog, which had been used since Azilian times. But in the upper levels of several of these epipaleolithic cultures the first signs of the new crafts appear. A little poor pottery occurs in the uppermost layers of the shell mounds at Mughem (Portugal); yet except for a few coarse sherds, pottery is still absent in the later shell mounds of Asturia.'7 De Morgan'sis claim that the Campignyans through- out possessed domestic animals, tilled the soil and made incised pottery, has never been generally admitted, for these traits are all intrusive in the Campignyan proper as established elsewhere while the site in question was inadequately investigated. But that Campignyan settlements survived after the "neolithic" intrusions and have left on their floors objects bor- rowed or copied from the new peoples, there can be little doubt. In the Ertebolle shellmound culture of the Baltic a definite pottery form appears. Coarse conical based pots of poorly baked clay occur occasionally throughout the greater part of this culture. But this ware is no prototype of the later neolithic wares of this region. It is found occasion- ally in dolmen times, but only in remote corners where shellmound folk survived. Although this Ertebolle pottery undoubtedly precedes true neolithic forms in the area and no prototype has been found in a more advanced culture it is not seriously regarded as an independent develop- ment by any but those who would derive all the neolithic arts from the Baltic region.'9 True neolithic celts and pottery of the dolmen type are found only in the uppermost layers of middens such as Langeland, which continued to be occupied in full neolithic times. At Limhamm (South Sweden) the upper levels of a midden yielded the bones of domestic animals and grains of wheat, others have yielded objects of passage-grave date.20 The evidence is everywhere the same, that neolithic civilization was introduced by new peoples among whom its fundamental crafts were already long established. ELEMENTS OF THE MEGALITHIC CIVILIZATION In the west these new arts and crafts are primarily associated with the builders of massive stone tombs known as megalithic monuments. The megalithic builders are therefore the first truly civilized people in Atlantic Europe, and we may avoid the ambiguous and frequently in- '7 Sella, V. dcl.; E1 Asturiesne, Mem. com. invest. pal. y prch.

During the period of its expansion other civilizing forces were penetrating the area from central Europe, but the megalithic civilization was dominant throughout the region as a whole. Although their habitations have frequently been lost or obscured by the occupations of subsequent peoples, the rough stone monuments of the megalith builders have, in virtue of their size and solidity, remained as permanent memorials to this early civilization. Pillage and demolition, operating at an ever increasing rate since Roman times, have destroyed much evidence. Many megalithic structures have been entirely obliter- ated, others ruined and partly destroyed. But the labor involved in their erection has been less readily available in later times for their destruction. Many have in consequence been preserved almost intact. Destruction has, moreover, been sporadic; tenacious of existence as they are in well tilled plains as well as on barren uplands, there is good reason to believe that their present numbers and distribution represent fairly well, if only in diminished approximation, the areas of settlement and concentration of the early peoples who built them. The range of the West European megalithic monuments extends from the Iberian peninsula and the islands of the Western Mediterranean through France and the British Isles to the lands flanking the entrance to the Baltic Sea. They are found in the heart of rocky plateaux in central France e.g. the departments of Averyron, Lozire etc., along the low shores of Denmark and in the most inaccessible islands to the far north of Scot- land. (Fig. 4.) It has long been claimed that similarities in the structure of these monuments and parallels to be observed in certain items of their furniture, indicated a community of origin and the spread of an early civilization in Atlantic Europe.21 With increasing comparative knowledge both of the megalithic cultures in western Europe and of the early civilizations of the Ancient East and the Aegean, a considerable literature has grown up around the problem of the origins of megalithic architecture and the civilization it connotes. Although an independent origin for megalithic architecture in the separate areas is occasionally claimed, it is generally accepted that there is an ulti- mate and genetic relationship between the megalithic remains of Western 21 For early discussions of the subject see Fergusson, Rude Stone Monuments in all countries, and Montelius, Der Orient und Europa, Stockholm, 1899.</page><page sequence="10">28 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 32, 1930 Europe. It is established moreover, despite a few dissentient voices,22 that they indicate the line of an early spread of the fundamental arts and crafts of civilization in a northerly direction from Iberia and the Western Mediterranean.

Although variations were developed, essentially similar types of tombs are to be found throughout the entire range. The importance of variations as indications of the sequence of settlement will be discussed later. The furniture of these tombs yields important indications of the activities of the people and, as has already been said, of their external relations. Occasionally where a well preserved settlement is found in conjunction with a megalithic necrop- olis, as at Los Millares in Almeria,24 a fairly detailed reconstruction of the whole settlement and life of the community can be made. But more fre- quently the disturbance of subsequent occupations, the lack of even approximately closed finds, with consequent uncertainty of chronological relationships and, above all, the rarity of systematic exploration, combine to reduce to meagre proportions our knowledge of their habitations and daily life. The concentration and permanence of their tombs indicate that the megalithic builders were a sedentary people. Although it has been claimed, on negative evidence, that Long Barrow People in Britain were simple pastoralists, there is adequate evidence for the practice of agriculture in the megalithic culture in western Europe as a whole. The sedentary and agricultural characters of the megalithic peoples is abundantly testified in Iberia in the stations of the South. In Denmark, the frequent imprint of grains of barley occurs on the dolmen pottery25 and in Brittany, as else- where, there is indirect evidence of the cultivation not only of food grains, but also of materials for weaving textiles. The forms and ornament of pottery associated with megalithic tombs are of the greatest value in the establishment of interrelations. Specific forms such as the bell beakers, indicating contact between different areas will be considered later, but the wide distribution of a group of decorative techniques including the Combed Style (style dent&amp; of Sophus Miiller), is of great significance for the area as a whole since their distribution is 23 Dawn of European Civilisation, 1925; The Danube thoroughfare and the beginnings of Civilisation in Europe, Antiquity, Vol. I, p. 79; and his forthcoming book 'The Danube in Prehistory' (Oxford). 24 Siret, L.

"Comb" ornament includes designs of zoned bands, triangles, lozenges and zigzags (both direct and reserved) all executed with a comb- like instrument (a comb or toothed wheel of wood or bone) the imprint of which left a line of small sharp incisions. The imprint is usually oblique in relation to the direction of the decorated band or the lines of the vessel. This style is specially well developed in the bell beaker where it is frequently encrusted, but it occurs on other forms and is associated with other decor- ation on the same pot, including incised and "pecked" ornament effected with pointed tools, cardium shell impressions and, in some areas, imprints of two-stringed cords. Incisions and cord imprints were sometimes filled with a white calcareous paste, emphasizing the de- sign against the dark, frequently burnished background of the ware. The whole group of techniques combined to form the Fine Early Style ("riche style ancienne") as defined by Sophus Miiller in the later dolmens and early passage graves of Denmark.26 The various techniques are com- mon to settlements throughout the Atlantic littoral and western Mediter- ranean. The resemblances are not merely general, they include specific analogies in technical detail as well as remarkable parallels in complex designs. Comparing specimens from Iberia and Denmark, Sophus Milller27 claims that: with this perfect correspondence between very complex ornamental motifs, one cannot doubt that there is a close relationship between the two examples. But this relation extends to the entire style studied here; the fundamental motives are in great part the same, the designs and their employment equally resemble one another ..... There existed a common artistic style which we may provisionally call the Hispano-Danish, and this style appears in Denmark and the south at cor- responding points in the cultural evolution. The pottery of Angelhu Ruju (Sardinia) with zigzag and lozenge decora- tions, direct and reserved, has precise parallels in Iberia and Brittany as well as in Denmark. In his more elaborate analysis of the early pottery styles of Europe28 the unity of the Fine Early Style throughout the western Mediterranean and the Atlantic littoral is demonstrated in de- tail.

S., 32, 1930 THE CULTURE SEQUENCE IN IBERIA The megalithic chambers of Spain and Portugal are generally considered to follow an evolutionary sequence indicating an Iberian origin for the rough stone tomb. A slow development of material culture is said to ac- company the elaboration of more massive sepulchres. This sequence adapted first by Cartailhac from Montelius' classification of Scandinavian megaliths has been discussed in a long series of archeological writings."29 Bosch Gimpera even claims to identify a division into five successive per- iods (late neolithic, early copper age A and B, full copper age A and B) to be correlated with various alleged stages in the evolution of the megalith grave.30 It is sometimes assumed that the megalithic chamber was not originally covered by a mound but originated in North-Western Iberia as a large polygonal boxlike construction of rough stones which imitated a natural cave. Desire to increase the protection of the dead led to the erection of a covering tumulus which, in its turn, since the burial was collective and used for many generations, demanded a gallery allowing access to the cham- ber. At a further stage by hypothetical processes variously alleged to have been indigenous (Bosch Gimpera, Leeds etc.) or to have been introduced from the eastern Mediterranean (Wilke, Obermaier, etc.) a domed roof was produced by corbelling the upper courses of a dry-walled chamber. At this same period, the megalith-builders began to excavate into the ground, especially on a hill-slope, thus burying the megalithic tomb, to which access was gained by a descending ramp. To this stage also are as- cribed the rockhewn, non-megalithic, passage-tombs, such as Palmella, in south-west Portugal. Meanwhile the megalithic passage-dolmen con- 29 See especially-Cartailhac, E.

The final stage was reached in the closed slab- cist of much smaller dimensions in which only one to two bodies were buried. Such a typological series has the attractive quality of appearing to explain without remainder the genesis and evolution of the megalithic tomb. So long as attention is restricted to the forms of selected tombs, its very neatness all but compels acceptance. But the analyses of geographic dis- tribution, of tomb furniture, and of relationships with the megalithic culture in Western Europe as a whole, bring out the grave difficulties in- volved in the application of this typology. Tombs closely resembling these alleged stages are to be found in widely separated areas, e.g., S. France, Brittany, N.E. France, the British Isles, and the Western Baltic region. In the last area a definite chronological sequence of the same kind has been claimed and widely accepted. If the evolution of a series of successive types in Iberia be valid, then, since the various types are represented so widely elsewhere, it might be expected that the successive stages of mega- lithic architecture were propagated as developed throughout Western Europe; that the simple closed dolmen, for example, was carried along the Atlantic margin at a time previous to the elaboration of the passage dolmen and the cupola tomb in Iberia. If this were so, the grave goods of the tombs would be expected to show great homogeneity throughout the megalithic areas and in each region they should vary more or less definitely according to the type of tomb, i.e., the furniture parallels should tend to be with the tombs of the same type in different areas rather than with tombs of differ- ent types in any one area. This, however, is not so. Apart from the tombs themselves, it has required long discussion and marshalling of evidence to establish true cultural unity between the different "megalithic" areas.31 In France as a whole and more especially in the Breton peninsula, it is very difficult to impose a chronological sequence of this type, and tombs of very different form, from square-chambered passage dolmens to slab-cists, are found from their grave goods to belong to the same period.32 In Iberia elaborate incised and "combed" ornament is almost entirely absent in the small dolmens of N.

On the "evolutionary" theory the megalith builders had at this stage little knowledge of these decorative techniques which are abundant in the larger megalithic tombs of the south. Yet in Denmark these styles occur with their undoubted south- ern affinities in some of the small dolmens as well as in the chambres des g'ants (passage dolmens). Since the theory of a slow evolution of megalithic architecture in west- ern Iberia receives little corroboration from the comparative study with other megalithic areas in western Europe, it becomes very necessary to examine its foundation and to inquire whether there may not be other explanations of the variety of megalithic forms in Spain and Portugal and of the parallels between the Iberian forms and those of other areas. The arrangement of any typological sequence, however neat the dove- tailing of objects and however probable the a priori grounds adduced, must always depend for its final validity on a demonstration of the agree- ment of the proposed sequence with the known or probable history of other objects found associated with the several elements. The "primitive" tombs should yield prototypes of the grave goods found in the "later" and more magnificent passage-dolmens, rock-cut tombs and corbelled vaults. In brief, the typological sequences of the objects found in the mega- lithic monuments should certainly run parallel with the evolution of the tombs themselves. Bosch Gimpera claims that this is so; he contents himself, however, with somewhat isolated descriptions of tombs and of objects which he would assign to the various stages. Without complete analysis of the material, these elaborate subdivisions cannot be regarded as proven. Aberg's survey, based primarily on the Iberian museum collections, is far more comprehensive and impartial. It reveals the difficulties of inte- grating the theory of megalithic "evolution" with the evidence of the grave furniture. He adheres to the orthodox theory of the development of mega- lithic architecture, but in his summaries of the tomb material and in the inventories of a large number of monuments of different types, no evidence is adduced to confirm us in the belief that there occurred in northwestern Portugal the invention of the simple dolmen which was in the course of time elaborated into the great megalithic tombs and cupolas of Alcali, Nora and Antequera or the rock-cut chambers of Palmella. Aberg admits the lack of evidence; he shows, for example, that one element or another of the fully developed Palmella furniture occurs frequently in small passage dol- mens. He accounts for the sporadic distribution of the Palmella-Ciempo- zuelos incrusted ware by saying that</page><page sequence="17">FORDE] CULTURES OF ATLANTIC EUROPE 35 the pottery of Palmella was n3t the only one in use at that period. It is shown that other incised and unornamented wares described as typical of the passage dolmens coexist with Palmella forms in the same tombs.33 Indeed the unornamented pottery which is generally claimed to be special to the megaliths of central Portugal and more "primitive" than the Pal- mella ware is shown to be frequently associated with 'Palmella' and incised wares in a single tomb, and is, moreover, closely similar to that character- istic of the slab cists.34 This is an alarming result for it approximates pottery yielded by monu- ments near either end of the postulated megalithic evolution. Aberg realizes that the funerary furniture should follow the evolution of the types of tomb but admits that in the material at our disposal it is impossible to demonstrate this evolution out- side that which concerns small details such as the schist and marble idols and the tanged arrowheads. We are not, then, up to the present, able to establish a division in periods. Despite the admirable commonsense of this analysis, he attempts to miti- gate its destructiveness to the theory of a long megalithic evolution by appealing, in the absence of corroborative evidence, to the theory that since the megalithic monuments were collective tombs used for a long period the most ancient furniture might then have been removed, destroyed, or mixed with more recent objects and one could scarcely distinguish the first from the second. This, however, is no avenue for retreat. The slab-cists are not collective monuments and it has already been claimed that their pottery has "prim- itive" features and resembles that of the "earlier" of the Portuguese megal- liths. Can we, in any case, assume the existence of a hypothetical primitive furniture in the smaller passage dolmens which was systematically removed by a later people to the confusion of archaeologists? The furniture of the slab-cists, moreover, varies considerably from region to region and approxi- mates that of the larger tombs of their vicinity. In central Portugal metal is absent from the cists and their furniture corresponds so completely with that of the abundant passage dolmens of the area that Correia justly in- sists that they cannot be regarded as intermediate forms in an evolution 3 berg, op. cit., pp. 113-114. 4 Aberg., op. cit., pp. 113-114.</page><page sequence="18">36 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 32, 1930 since they are individual graves and contemporaneous with the "dol- mens."'35 In Algarve to the south, on the other hand, where ribbed copper daggers and occasional flat celts were placed in the magnificent corbelled passage tombs of Alcal$, copper objects also occur in the cists, among them, significantly enough, Palmella points,36 and in one case callais beads."7 (Fig. 7.) ~~P~f~F~s~a FIG. 7. Megalithic cists, Odemira and Milfontes, Algarve (1/40). (after da Veiga) Aberg is, however, far more judicious than most writers on the mega- lithic civilization of Iberia and admits that he remains a little circumspect of the conclusions to which M. Bosch Gimpera has arrived. Despite his obvious affection for the megalithic evolution of Montelius and Cartailhac he yet must admit that the culture with which we are dealing here, represents a period the duration of which is relatively short.38 It becomes transparent therefore that the great galleries and cupolas of Algarve, Huelva, Andalucia and Almeria, the rock-cut tombs of Palmella, and the passage dolmens of central Portugal and western Spain are virtually contemporaneous. The smaller passage dolmens have a poorer but not earlier furniture; they represent a "poorer element of the population" or, in other words, a provincial degradation typical of peripheral areas. We have now to consider the alleged priority of the closed dolmen in which, it is assumed, is to be found the genesis of the megalithic idea. There is, in the first place, every reason to regard the originally free stand- ing dolmen as a myth; no furniture has ever been recovered from these exposed chambers, and Leeds claims that traces of tumuli are to be found SCorreia, V., El Neolitico de Pavia.

It follows that the ingenious derivation of the passage dolmen from the free-standing dolmen consequent on the erection of a tumulus, loses its theoretic force. It must also be realized that many of the appar- ently simple dolmenic ruins may often be the relics of destroyed passage dolmens, for a closing slab on the fourth side is rarely found and Leeds has even gone so far as to account for this by suggesting an unclosed three- sided type of dolmen.40 Finally, closed dolmens are sporadic in Portugal, where this alleged type is found in close proximity to passage dolmens. In north Spain-Galicia, the Basque province, the Spanish Pyrenees,and northern Catalonia-rectangular closed dolmens are well-known.41 But they are not early; their grave contents are similar to those of the passage dolmens in the same areas and in the East, because of their undoubted "chalcolithic" features, are frequently described as cists.42 The claim that megalithic architecture originated in Iberia with a simple, closed, and probably freestanding chamber relies entirely therfore on the sporadic and ruined tombs of north Portugal from which practically no furniture has been recovered. These tombs are assumed to be early, in deference to the Scandinavian sequence, although small closed chambers equally "primitive" in construction are known to be late further east in the Pyrenean culture. The geographic distribution of the various tomb types carries us a stage further in the problem. The focal points of the "copper age" civil- ization of Iberia lie in the south. The magnificent tombs whether rock- cut, megalithic or corbelled, are found, with very few exceptions, in the southern provinces of Portugal and in southern Spain (Andalucia and Granada). Leeds distinguishes the finer monuments from the smaller passage dolmens, referring to the former as "megalithic tombs." He notes that they are frequently subterranean, i.e. have been excavated in a hillside. From the entrance there is a descending ramp,which occupies the outer part of the " Leeds, op. cit., p. 202. 40 ibid., p. 202. 41 Bosch Gimpera, P. Prehistorica Catalana, Encyc.

There is not, however, an absolute distinction between these monuments and the surface passage-dolmens. Many intermediate forms, partly buried and partly covered by a tumulus are known.43 Moreover, cer- tain veryfine and massive monuments certainlyofthisclasswereconstructed above ground level, e.g. dolmen de Soto."4 These tombs are generally of great size and elaborate construction. The forms of chamber are varied: polygonal, rectangular, circular. Both the megalithic and drystone walling are employed, often within a single monument and the circular chambers are domed by means of corbelling. In the great necropolis of Alcal%, Al- garve, some of the tombs are almost entirely megalithic, while others are carried out in ashlar walling.45 A similar juxtaposition of megalithic and corbelled types is found at Los Millares, Almeria, in the southeast.46 The smaller Portuguese passage dolmens which are as a rule of com- paratively rough construction, and for which little or no excavation was undertaken, are more remote in geographical position occurring in greatest numbers in central and north Portugal.47 .Their furniture, although poorer, prohibits any attempt to date them appreciably earlier than the large "megalithic tombs" of the south, for they frequently contain pottery and votive objects of the same type as the southern tombs, e.g. schist plaques and croziers. The alleged prototypes of this architecture, the "simple dolmen" and passage dolmens with very short galleries, are still more remote. They do not occur in the south and are rare in central Portugal. They are found, as we have already noted, in Northern Portugal, Galicia, the Basque prov- ince, Navarra and Catalonia. These "primitive" forms are not con- centrated on a limited area but span the base of the peninsula from west to east and are associatedwith small passage dolmens and undoubtedly degenerate covered galleries. Several conclusions can now be suggested. In the first place, the mega- lithic tombs of the Iberian peninsula fail to show that slow elaboration of grave goods which the theory of local origin and development would ex- pect. The less imposing tombs have the unfortunate habit of yielding ob- jects typical of the great southern centres and cannot legitimately be dated early. Secondly, the quality of megalithic construction deteriorates as a Leeds, op. cit., pp. 204, 205. 44 Obermaier, H., El Dolmen de Soto, Huelva, Boletin de la Soc.

This would explain why the megalithic monuments of the north, in Spain and Portugal alike, are of less elaborate construction, and would at the same time account for the occurrence in the Catalan tombs of ob- jects typologically late. It would appear, therefore, that the traditional typ- ology is an example of the frequent mistaking of the degraded for the prim- itive. Leeds admits that the "evolutionary" sequence raises great diffi- culties, that the problem of distribution is in no way simplified by a survey of the material known up to the present time. Indeed it would seem to be rendered even more difficult than before.48 There are indeed insuperable difficulties. If the megalithic tomb evolved in western Iberia from a simple closed chamber to a large galleried tomb, partly excavated underground, and developing variants with corbelled vaults and rock-cut analogues, it is strange that there should be an almost complete geographical separation between the first and last stages in the development. Finally, if the simple dolmens and small galleries are at the beginning of the series, their furniture should be homogeneous and fairly uniform; but there is actually a more considerable variation between the furniture of the various groups of small dolmens, passage dolmens and galleries in the north, i.e. between the Catalan, Basque, Galician and north Portuguese, than between the grave goods of the great megalithic tombs in the south from the Tagus to Almeria. Between the southern centres, considering the vigor of their civilization, there is an astonishing uniformity; Siret and D~chelette49 long ago pointed out their essential synchronism. The affinities of the more northern Portuguese passage dolmens are with the western group of megalithic tombs. This is evidenced above all by the distribution of schist plaques and croziers. The Catalan monuments, on the other hand, dominantly reflect the Almerian and western Mediter- ranean cultures with their greater wealth of metal objects, poverty of polished tools, and distinctive types of bell beaker ornamentation. If, as Leeds5? and Childe5s have claimed, the Catalan megaliths are more closely related to the trans-Pyrenean cultures of southeastern France, it would follow that the polygonal dolmens of northwestern 48 Op. cit., p. 225. 49 Rev.

Portugal and Galicia) and the square chambers of the northeast represent architectural degeneration in different areas and have no direct typological relationship to one another, while the associated grave fur- niture is likewise derived from distinct proximate sources. If the results of this analysis are accepted we must regard the Iberian megalithic culture as first developing in two related southern centres, Southern Portugal, Huelva and Andalucia in the southwest and Almeria and eastern Granada in the southeast. (See Fig. 4, page 28). While tomb construction with rough unshaped but small rock material built up without the use of mortar (dry-stone or ashlar walling) is elabor- ately developed in both areas, the use of large, truly megalithic blocks, is more extensively developed in the west and that, moreover, in the lesser and more remote centres from which the furniture is less rich, especially in metals. There are also found in the western area groups of rock-cut tombs of which those at Palmella are the most famous. These sepulchres were hewn in a soft rockface from which a passage often widening out into one or more bulging antechambers leads to a circular chamber. This form as at Alapraia (Cascaes) and Folha de Barradas (Cintra) and Pal- mella, is very uniform and was executed elsewhere in megalithic blocks, e.g. Ordem, (Pavia).52 It should also be realized that the polygonal cham- ber of the western passage dolmen is merely the angularization of the cir- cular chamber of the drywalled and rock-cut tombs consequent on the use of a few large flat-faced megalithic slabs. Since the evidence has clearly indicated that megalithic construction degenerated in the more northern parts of the peninsula it would appear that the circular chamber, frequently provided with smaller side chambers and approached by a long corridor was the original Iberian type. It was executed by excavation in soft rock, by construction in ashlar walling covered by a tumulus, thus imitating a subterranean tomb, and again in megalithic blocks which afforded solidity without demanding the same care in construction as the corbelled tomb, but at the same time limited the scope of the architect on account of the clumsiness of the material. (Fig. 8.) The close interrelations between the two southern centres have fre- quently been noted, but their distinctive traits should also be briefly described. In the southwestern area copper is not generally abundant. At Palmella there are found only a number of curious copper points splayed at the top into flat oval shapes somewhat resembling an unrolled racquet pin (fig. 9). These Palmella points have also been recovered from mega- 52 Cp. Correia, V., El neolitico de Pavia, Com. Inv. Pal. y.

Cylindrical "idols" of stone or bone with very degraded incised face symbols, or simple carved knobs on top are also characteristic of this area and distinct from the "phalange" idols made from animal bones which are found in Almeria. Beads of the light green stone generally known as callais were used abundantly; they appear to be concentrated in the lower Tagus region, for nearly eight hundred have been found in the tombs of the province of Estramadura, nearly four hundred in Alemtejo and over ninety further south in Algarve. No less than 286 were recovered from three of the tombs at Palmella and they have been obtained in large numbers from other individual tombs." Two distinct wares are associated with the tombs of this area. Espe- cially characteristic of the Palmella tombs are a variety of forms suggesting the development and crystallization of the bell beaker form and ornament. The majority of the Palmella pots are more squat, more deeply constricted at the waist, and more pointed at the base, than is the standardized bell beaker which was so widely diffused throughout western Europe.

(Fig. 18.) The flint work (knives, daggers, and arrowheads) is as magnifi- cent as in the west; lozenges and mitriform, points of similar form and execution, are found in abundance. But there is also an extensive develop- ment of tanged points, which are rare in the western area. (Fig. 11,6-7.) Small stone pots, generally of alabaster, recall similar occasional finds in the west. e.g. at Palmella. Ornaments of amber, callais, amethyst and jet, and a dag- ger of hippopotamus ivory indicate the extensiveness of trade relations. 5: ::. I FIG. 18. Copper tools, Los Millares, etc., Almeria. (1/4) (after Siret) The pottery again falls into two groups, but both wares are found to- gether in the tombs. The one is richly ornamented with incised and comb decoration in which geometric, animal andritualistic designsare found. In this group fall a number of bell beakers of fully developed form decor- ated very restrainedly in the combed style with parallel horizontal bands of oblique markings. (Fig. 14.) Other pottery is burnished but undecorated, the technique of manufacture being apparently similar to that of the corre- sponding western wares. In the southeastern region other sites have been found which Siret and Bosch Gimpera attribute to earlier periods. At El Garcel and Trez Cabezos village sites yielded a variety of polished stone tools (axes, chisels, gouges) of diorite, fibrolite and greenstone with a burnished pottery. A small stone "violin" idol strongly reminiscent of Aegean forms (Early Minoan, Troy II etc.) is a remarkable feature at El Garcel. This "idol" is also known in the west, e.g. from the settlement of "El Castillo" near Pavia, Alemtejo, Portugal.59 Arrowheads are completely lacking but numerous 59 Correia, op. cit., p. 18.</page><page sequence="31">FORDE] CULTURES OF ATLANTIC EUROPE 49 microlithic flints, including characteristic Tardenoisean trapezes and tri- angles abound. The village of Gerundia and the slab cist graves of Palaces, Puerto Blanco, and Velez Blanco6O show a somewhat more elaborate culture, in- cluding callais beads, bracelets of pectunculus shell, copper pins and awls, while at Parazuelos and Campos copper celts and arrow points are abund- ant. Although it is possible that these sites record the elaboration of the Almerian civilization, it is yet equally probable that they represent out- lying and minor settlements of the fully developed culture. The idols and ovoid pots suggest east and mid-Mediterranean sources; slag of copper ores was found at El Garcel6' while the occurrence of Tardenoisean flint forms might well follow from the intrusion of Almerians among epipaleo- ithic aborigines. In any case these settlements do not afford prototypes for the megalithic chambers of Los Millares etc.; burials are in caves or slab-protected trenches. The Almerian culture extended rapidly along the eastern shore of Spain, but megalithic construction did not accompany it here. In Murcia, Val- encia, and Aragon, extending far up the Egro valley, trench and cave bur- ials, and settlements yield fairly rich furniture of Almerian arrowheads, fibrolite axes, stone beads, together with occasional beakers and copper tools. In southeastern Catalonia (Tarragona, Barcelona and eastern Lerida) an important center developed. Pectunculus bracelets, callais beads and fine stone celts are found in the burials of this area in which megalithic construction, save for a menhir-like pillar indicating the site, is again generally absent. The abundance of trapezes and lack of arrow- heads conform to the condition of Palaces and Puerto Blanco in the south, which implies for Bosch Gimpera that the Catalonian extension preceded the occupation of intervening country. In the Pyrenean area of northeastern Catalonia, Navarra, and the Basque provinces, megalithic chambers (passage tombs, galleries, and small closed chambers) reappear abundantly. The abundance of copper and zoned beakers indicates Almeria as the dominant influence. But the relation may have been indirect, arriving via southern France, for, as Leeds has shown, the Pyrenean culture both in tomb form and furniture is homogeneous on both sides of the range and most closely related to the Provencal culture.62 Bosch Gimpera regards the Pyrenean megaliths as derived from the west and points to the elaborate design, zigzags, bands of 60 l'Anthropologie, 35, 1925, p. 432. 61 de Motos, L'edad neolitico en Velez Blanco.

But although our knowledge of the monuments further west is extremely inadequate, there is no reason to believe that these, any more than the north Portuguese tombs, bridge the gap between Catalonia and southwest Iberia and the V-pierced bone ornaments may well have their closest parallels in Sardinia. So that provisionally the isolated Pyrenean group is more safely to be linked with the neighboring culture in southeastern France, whose character will be discussed later. There is no doubt, 'however, that southwestern influence penetrated this area for typical southwestern incrusted pottery with radial designs of the Palmella-Ciempozuelos type are found in cave burials in northern Catalonia,63 and in a group of small galleries and caves in the district of Solsona in Lerida (north Catalonia). But with the latter group are found square V-pierced bone buttons, copper daggers, points, etc. and tanged arrow points related to southeastern forms and the culture is undoubtedly mixed.64 The Almerian and southwestern civilizations did not penetrate so freely into the central plateau of Iberia. Bosch Gimpera groups together as one culture the two very distinct provinces that are indicated by the pot- tery found in cave burials in this area. In the north, relief decoration by means of plastic bands, buttons etc., together with lines of irregular thumbnail impressions on the bands or rims, is found almost exclusively in a large series of cave finds. Regarding these as a local Iberian develop- ment, he considers that similar types in southern France indicate northern extension of Iberian Capsians, but as Poisson65 points out, the distribution of this pottery in Spain forms a triangle based on the Pyrenees whose point extends southward only to Madrid. Not only does its distribution fail to coincide with the undoubtedly earlier centers of Capsian culture in Spain but it further suggests a trans-Pyrenean source for the style. Plastic ornament is a characteristic feature of the "neolithic" settlementsof the con- tinental interior, e.g. the western lake dwellings and the fortified stations of the middle Rhine. Forms related both to these and to the northern Iberian are recorded over the intervening areas in stations of the "Camp de Chassey" type and in caves in the Alpes Maritimes and the Central plateau of Lozbre, Dordogne, and Arikge.66 There can be little doubt there- "3 E.g., Cova fonda de Salamo. 64 Aberg, op. cit., p. 147 ff. for an admirable summary of the material of this region. 65 Les Civilisations ndolithiques et Cn0olithiques de la France, Rev.

In the southern section of central Spain, cave finds of pottery are associated with polished stone axes, flintwork of southwestern and Almerian types and copper tools (flat celts, daggers, awls etc.). The pottery of this region is decorated with bands of incised lines, and zones and zigzags in the comb technique. These cave finds mingle with the megalithic tombs of western Andalucia, and in the vicinity of Carmona, a little east of Sevilla, a rich variety of bell beakers have been obtained from settlements, caves and megalithic tombs. The richness of the Andalucian material on the fringe of the megalithic area and the Ciempozuelos finds further north have led Bosch Gimpera and Castillo67 to claim that the bell beaker style was elaborated here and introduced into the southwest from the central province. But the Palmella pottery would appear to offer an equally good typological series for the evolution of the bell beaker, while the varying richness of the cave finds, in pottery and other furniture, which is taken to indicate evolution from a simple neolithic to a copper age culture, more probably resulted through gradations in cultural remoteness from the south- ern centres. THE BELL BEAKER The bell beaker affords a remarkably valuable cultural index in the early cultures of Western Europe. Exceptionally standardized in form and ornamented in characteristic and unmistakable techniques it is distributed over a very wide area extending from the central Mediter- ranean to the English Channel. Characteristic throughout southern Portt- gal and Spain, extending in large numbers into the northeast, the earlier 'Atlantic' bell beaker is more abundant in Iberia than elsewhere. But although it is generally accepted that this crystallization of form and ornament took place in southern Iberia, and that the mature bell beaker, whether of western or central European form, is everywhere derived from the Iberian, its early development is nevertheless obscure. Siret and others have suggested that its shape and ornament are derived from basketry prototypes. This explanation has been widely accepted and more recently Childe has carried it a stage further. Remarking the general similarity to the earliest known Egyptian pottery-the beakers of the Badari culture 66 Cf. Schuckhardt, C. West Europa als alter Kultur kreis. 1913, cp. Poisson, op. cit., pp. 250-252. 67 Alberto del Castillo, La ceramica incisa de la cultura de las cuevas de la peninsula Ib~r- ica, Barcelona, 1922.</page><page sequence="34">52 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 32, 1930 -he suggests that both were produced in imitation of archaic esparto grass basketry forms in use in Africa from the remote past until the present day. Surviving on the southern fringes of the Sahara, this form either in basketry or already translated into pottery formed one element of a slow cultural drift which introduced shell bracelets, disc beads, and later hollow based arrowheads of African types into northeast Africa and Iberia.68 Bosch Gimpera and Castillo while not denying the influence of bas- ketry in both form and ornament have claimed to have identified the actual scene of the elaboration of the bell beaker in the regionof Carmona, in- sisting that it and other forms, together with comb and incrusted decoration used there, were strictly autochthonous and only later grafted on to the megalithic culture. But the pottery of the Carmona region is derived from both megalithic tombs and cave finds on the fringe of the southwestern megalithic centre. With the exception of the Ciempozuelos cave finds further north the richest ornament and greatest variety of forms are associated directly with megalithic tombs69 and it is only on the assumption, which we have already questioned, that the megalithic culture developed slowly from rude beginnings in north Portugal, that this pottery can be regarded as originally dissociated from the southern cultures. But the character of the wares of the Carmona region and of the Palmella tombs undoubtedly afford some clue to the development of the beaker. The tall slender bell beaker, decorated in bands of 'combed" ribbons, zigzags or triangles, is not characteristic of these wares. The dominant forms are hemispherical shapes and low, waisted bowls with a smoothed carination (figs.12), which indeed are squat compressed bell beakers. At Palmella a whole series of gradations from the squatter form to normal bell beaker shape can be observed, and it is immediately suggested that the bell beaker may well have developed in western Iberia as Bosch Gimpera claims, by a heightening of the low, waisted carinated bowl. The elaborate radial patterns and incrusted technique of the Carmona, Palmella, and Ciempozuelos bowls and beakers are remote from basketry patterns, although such influence may have come in later on as a formative influence in the decoration of horizontal ribbons, zigzags etc. The carinated bowl, both decorated and burnished, 68 Childe, Most Ancient East pp. 232ff. 69 The tombs and stations of this region have been excavated by Bonsor but the data are incompletely published; see Bonsor, O.

It is a leading tomb ware in Brittany, appears with ornament of southern origin, "combed triangles," "oculi" etc. in Denmark, and has moreover archaic predecessors in clay and stone in the eastern Mediterranean. It would therefore appear unnecessary to lean heavily on the uncertainties of basketry prototypes, but to accept the evidence of the varying forms in Iberia itself as indicating the development and crystallization of the bell beaker from the low, waisted bowl. In its later form the Iberian beaker is surprisingly uniform in shape and range of ornament. In Almeria a very restrained ornament of incised and combed ribbons and triangles was almost exclusively used, and beakers of precisely this type appear in areas so far apart as southern Italy and the Channel Islands. THE ANCESTRY OF THE MEGALITHIC CULTURE If the Iberian megalithic culture was already at a high level of achieve- ment in the earliest centers of the south, the problem of its origin is pushed one stage further back and.must be sought, not in the degraded megaliths of northern Portugal but in some higher civilization elsewhere. Such an inquiry raises extremely complicated problems not only on account of the gaps in our knowledge but also from the baffling diversity of clues. Explanation of the western megalithic cultures in terms of the civiliza- tion of the Ancient East have long been advocated and controverted as a "mirage orientale," and the obscurity of the problem has been heightened by the conflict of data and hypothesis. 'Serious difficulties arise since parallels in tomb form and items of furniture are found in eastern centers which are widely separated in space and time, while no single cultural province can be claimed as the source of even the greater part of the Iberian culture. The passage chamber tomb which is the primary and original "mega- lithic" type in the west was characteristic in all the early centers of higher civilization. The rock-cut tombs of the Old Kingdom in Egypt and the excavated dromos tombs of Early and Middle Minoan Crete are obviously parallel in plan and function and the fact that many of the finest Iberian tombs are excavated in the ground is of great importance. The corbelled chamber may also be related directly to Aegean prototypes. The famous Mycenean "tholoi" are later than the Iberian and D6chelette70 has shown o70 Essai sur la chronologie pr~historique dans la peninsule ib~rique, Rev.

S., 32, 1930 the impossibility of Sirert's71 attempt to synchronize Los Millares with the late Minoan Bronze Age culture of Mycenae. But the corbelled beehive was used as a tomb in Crete at least as early as the later part of the Early Minoan period. The Messaran vaults,72 although not direct prototypes for Iberian forms, are nevertheless significant in the technique of their con- struction. In other early Aegean cultures, slablined cists which accompany the megalithic tombs in the west, were used as sepulchres for very long periods. The furniture, especially in Almeria, affords many if isolated Aegean parallels. The El Garcel type of violin idol resembles those of Troy I and I173 and belongs to the great family of east Mediterranean figurines. The Almizaraque figurine also has close parallels in lead at Troy II74 and in marble in the Cyclades. The "oculi" ornament incised on Los Millares75 pottery and reappearing sporadically as far north as Denmark, has early Troadic prototypes7" (fig. 19) and the ivory pommel (?) knob from Nora, Algarve,77 is also of early Trojan form. Analogies from Crete include the stone and wooden pillar supports in Los Millares "beehives,"78 the horns of consecration" from Campos and further west at Campo Real.7" The alabaster pots of Los Millares recall Cycladic pyxidess80 and are themselves related to small stone jars in the southwest, e.g., at Palmella. But the magnificant flintwork of the arrowheads, on the other hand, is not Aegean in its associations. Typologically it is related to that of predynastic Egypt, where the mitriform arrowhead was developed as early as Badarian times. Nilotic prototypes have also been suggested for the schist plaques and croziers of the southwest.sA The tanged daggers and flat copper celts of Almeria and Algarve are of the forms that were being made in Egypt, Troy, and Cyprus in the early part of the third millennium. 71 Siret, L.

Since all these miscellaneous parallels afforded by objects from the entire range of the early Iberian culture indicate very real links with the Eastern Mediterranean we should expect to find some mid-Mediterranean culture which acted as intermediary. But although the early civilizations of Southern Italy and Sicily betray immense indebtedness to the Aegean, they do not represent an incipient stage of the Iberian culture. G~6czc=jc FroIG. 20.

(after Cartailhac) The Sicilian rock cut tombs (fig. 20) might be considered Iberian proto- types, and the V-pierced bone button, copper daggers, and celts may have reached Spain from the mid-Mediterranean but the most definite evidence of contact points in the reverse direction and is afforded by zoned bell beak- ers of Almerian type in Sicily and Italy. In Sardinia,84 however, the tombs of a highly developed copper age culture afford evidence of a strong formative influence on the west. The extensive necropolis of galleried rock cut tombs at Anghelu Rugu85 in the northwest of the islands and the cave finds of San Bartolomeo on the east have on the one hand afforded abundant evidence of Aegean influence. The wares of the lower strata of cave finds have been compared to Early Minoan types,86 marble idols of late Early Cycladic type were found in three tombs at Angelhu Ruju, and much of the later pottery indicates an Aegean inspiration and reproduces Minoan forms, while the architecture of the tombs, with their multiple rock-hewn chambers, stepped-passage or pit entrance, anticella, pillars with carvings of bulls' heads, high prowed boats etc., show a dependence on eastern 82 MSAN., 1920-24, pp. 228 ff. and literature there cited. 83 0.

The grave goods of these Sardinian tombs also con- tain objects characteristic of the west, of which the bell beaker is the most conspicuous. But while some items clearly indicate reflex movements from Iberia, others such as the polypod bowls, V-pierced buttons, spool beads and spheroid mace-heads, tanged daggers, and pectunculus shell bracelets and perforated whetstones more probably indicate the proximate source of much of the Iberian and southern French megalithic cultures."87 The rock cut tombs of the Balearics and the galleries of Provence are most probably derived from the Sardinian types (figs. 21, 22, 23). =/ FIG. 21.

(after Taramelli) The tombs of Angelhu Ruju, and the Giants Graves which reproduce them in megalithic architecture, were, however, in use for very long periods of time, objects of Bronze Age and later periods have been recovered, and grave goods of earlier periods have doubtless been removed or scattered in the course of later interments. The picture of the early civilization of the island is therefore blurred and often uncertain, but the intermediacy of tomb form and the evidence of grave goods undoubtedly indicate that the continuity between the higher civilizations of the east and the megalithic culture is to be sought in the blending of cultures in the early settlements of the western Mediterranean. 87 Cf.

The higher cultures of southern Iberia were probably established by 2500 B.c. The halberds and the segmented beads of El Argar clearly indicate that the earlier Almerian culture had ended before 1600 B.c.; for the paste beads 88 Dawn, pp. 99-100.</page><page sequence="41">FORDE] CULTURES OF ATLANTIC EUROPE 59 are of Middle Minoan III date in Crete and an Iberian halberd was found in a shaft grave of that period at Mycenae. We are left therefore with a period of eight or nine hundred years, at the end of the third and the beginning of the second millenium, during which the Iberian peninsula exerted a paramount influence in the colonization and traffic of the Atlantic littoral.89 SOUTHERN FRANCE That the early cultural developments in Iberia were related to the appearance of civilized peoples throughout western Europe has long been obvious from the wide and correlated distribution of such fundamental elements as stone tomb forms, polished axes of diorite and other hard stone, and distinctive types of pottery. But the occurrence in various areas of unique and specialized ornaments and utensils enables us to define relations more exactly. The range of distributions of specific forms of tombs, of callais beads, of bell beakers of various types, etc. affords a basis for the more exact delineation of lines of expansion, of areas of colonization, and of the reflex traffic which followed the establishment of new centers. Iberia was undoubtedly the major focus from which the framework of early Atlantic civilization was extended, and the several lines of expan- sion may be followed in our analysis. Some influence was, as we have seen, undoubtedly transmitted back into the central Mediterranean, as is evidenced by the Almerian beakers of Sardinia and Sicily and the occasional megaliths of S. Italy. Established in southern France in the region of the Rhone delta, the megalithic culture also penetrated extensively the interior of western Europe. The Provencal culture crossed the Cevennes and extended into the barren plateau of southern France. Across the low ranges at the head of the Rhone valley another centre was established in the flint-bearing chalk ridges of the Paris basin. In this area the survival of Campignyans and the intrusion of continental elements combined with the strange environment to produce a variant culture in which Iberian traits are nevertheless obtrusive. The megalithic tombs of southeastern France extend from the low hills overlooking the Rhone delta up into the Cevennes and southern section of the central massif on the west and into the Alpine fringe on the east. Subterranean and slab-roofed galleries, corbelled chambers, large closed "dolmens," smaller dolmenic cists, and natural caves were all used for interment in this region. 89 This chronology is confirmed in Scandinavia where Danubian elements in the grave goods have enabled Childe to date the dolmen period from about 2500 to 2200 B.c. and the passage graves from 2200 to 1650 B.c. cf. Dawn, p. 212.</page><page sequence="42">60 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 32, 1930 The group of four large tombs in Provence near Aries are probably among the earliest in the area.90 These so-called "Grottes" des F6es, de Bounias, de Source and de Castellet, are long, relatively narrow galleries, sometimes with side chambers, excavated in the soft rock of the low hills and roofed with megalithic slabs. The Grotte des Fees, the largest, is nearly twenty-five metres long and four metres wide at the widest point of the main chamber (fig. 23). Source, the smallest, is 16.6 m long and considerably larger than the average passage tomb. From Castellet alone a relatively complete grave furniture has been obtained. In addition to an abundant flint work (arrow heads and spear points) and a zoned bell beaker of "Almerian" type, over a hundred discoid callais beads and numerous olive-shaped beads, one of callais and one of gold were recovered. The tanged copper dagger and V-pierced bone button found at Bounias supplement the evidence from Castellet and indicate the close relations with Iberia and the western Mediterranean.9' Bosch Gimpera92 assumes the Provengal culture to be an extension of the northeast Catalonian. But the tombs are far more elaborate than anything found in that area and Leeds has, as we have seen, reversed the process and shown the strong probability that the megaliths of Pyrenean Spain represent a late movement back into the Peninsula from France. Moreover, detailed structural analogies with the Provengal galleries are found in the rock-cut tombs of the Balearics. The similarity of the St. Vincent tomb, Majorca, and the Grotte des Fees near Aries has been repeatedly cited.93 The Balearics were themselves in intimate contact with both Almeria and the copper age culture of Sardinia that was respon- sible for the elaborate rock-cut tombs of Angelhu Ruju. Childe94 has already suggested that the bell beaker reached southern France not directly fromAlmeria but through the activities of mariners of the Sardinian culture. He would in this way also account for the prismatic V-pierced plaques that accompany the beakers in northern Catalonia. But although the archaeo- logical record from the Balearics is very inadequate, the evidence of tomb form points rather to this more western island group as the immediate source of the greater part of the Provengal culture. The finely worked 90 Cazalis de Fondouce, Les all6es-couvertes de Provence, 2 vols., 1873. 91 D6chelette, Manuel d'Arch6ologie, 1, p. 405 ff., summarizes the data and gives a short bibliography for this group of tombs. * Rev.

The Provengal galleries are unique in their area but a corbelled passage tomb of the same period occurs in the Cevennian fringe at Collorgues, Gard,95 and the grave goods of the "dolmen" of Cranves far away in the Haute Savoie indicate the northeastern extension of this culture. Numerous rectangular dolmens, which may in some instances be degenerate galleries, trench graves, and cave burials yielding similar though poorer furniture extend into the mountain country on either side.96 In these up- land areas, especially in the heart of the southern massif, this culture lingered on for a very long period. The "dolmens" of Aveyron, relatively small box-like constructions occasionally with holed stone entries,97 yield grave goods which indicate the gradual infiltration of Bronze Age types.98 Trefoil and raquet pins of bronze betray central European contacts effected, according to Childe,99 by the intrusive group who built the Bronze Age barrows of Savoy and Jura. But the helical copper bangles which first appeared somewhat earlier may be related to similar forms in use at El Argar, the bronze age culture that succeeded to Los Millares in Almeria. Other elements of the later furniture are bewildering. Slate palettes, segmented and phallic beads,100 have East Mediterranean parallels at the end of the third millenium. The occurrence of such types in late tombs in association with iron beads and riveted daggers has never been satisfactorily explained.1?1 SNicolas, Sepulture de Collorgues, A.F.A.S., 1889,2 pp. 629 ff. * In H6rault, Gard, Ardiche, Lozbre, Aveyron, etc. in the Massif to the west and in Var, Alpes Maritimes, Hautes Alpes etc. in the Alpine ranges to the east. 97 Dechelette, I, p. 403. 98 The long period indicated for the megalithic culture in southeastern France is divided by Bosch Gimpera into three stages of which the galleries of Aries, the dolmen of Stramousse (Alpes Maritimes) and the beehive Collorgues are typical of the first establishment of the culture. In the next "transitional" stage the bell beaker has disappeared but copper objects, including helical bangles and rhomboid points are more abundant e.g., Dolmen de Taurine, Aveyron.

Megalithic galleries, dolmenic cists and cave burials in this area have yielded a very uniform furniture characterized by bell beakers, finely polished celts occasionally of greenstone, flint daggers, callais and occasion- ally gold beads. Relations were apparently closest with the southeastern area in its first period. But several curious features appear in this culture. The major group of megaliths is found on the Plateau of Ger. Two galleries (Pouy Mayou and Pouy de la Halliade) were explored by Piette,102 others to the north, of which Taillan yielded the most complete grave goods, had been previously excavated by Pothier.'03 La Halliade is the only angled gallery reported in southern France. This form is frequent in Brittany and was probably developed there. At La Halliade also a beaker decorated with true cord impressions occurs. This ornament, although found sporadi- cally elsewhere, e.g., Domen de Cranves104 is aga'n best known in the Breton peninsula where tubular gold beads are also occasionally found. It would therefore seem that some movement from the northwest is indicated. But true cord impression is also found on two isolated beakers from north- eastern Spain, i.e., from the "dolmen" of Pagobakoitza105 near San Sebas- tian in the Basque country and from the passage dolmen of Puertas de Garcia Rodrigues, Coruna, Galicia.1?6 Both are of the same type, zoned beakers with oblique "combed" ornament, but the horizontal bounding lines of the zones were found by cord impression. They are, however, dis- tinct from the Breton and Halliade specimens, in which closely packed horizontal cord impressions cover the entire body of the beaker. In addition to bell beakers, tripod and polypod bowls are found in Taillan, la Halliade, and elsewhere in this area. These bowls are quite un- Iberian, but somewhat similar forms occur in association with bell beakers in Sardinia (Anghelu Ruju and San Bartolomeo) to which Childe107 looks for their source. Since, apart from the corded specimen, the beakers are of the mature zoned type characteristic of Almeria and the western Mediter- ranean, there can be little doubt that there was also intrusion from that area. But the culture of the southwestern area, established probably at the period of maximum activity, was short-lived. It neither lingered on 102 Piette, E.

GALLERIES AND ROCK-CUT TOMBS OF THE PARIS BASIN The megalithic tombs of the Paris basin (departments of Seine-et- Oise, Oise and Aisne) form a very specialized group of very uniform type. They are subterranean galleries, from seven to as much as fifteen metres in length, constructed in megalithic and drystone walling, without any covering mound. In general, a short and somewhat narrower ante-chamber precedes the long rectangular gallery and they are separated by a megalithic slab, in which a circular hole has been cut. Over half the galleries reported have holed stones and this trait is one of the most characteristic features of the group.108 (Fig. 24.) FIG. 24. The gallery of La Justice, Seine-et-Oise, length 18 m. (after Cartailhac). In considering the frequency of the holed stone entry in the area the character of the local building material must be borne in mind. Although the device itself was doubtless introduced from elsewhere, the soft sand- stone and chalk offered opportunities for its execution which were denied in Brittany and similar areas,in which megalithic architecture was normally executed in hard igneous rocks and shales, so that the frequency of the holed stone in Seine-et-Oise may be at least in some measure a function of the local conditions. Its appearance raises difficult problems because the long gallery or cist with holed stone entries or partitions is widely distributed as a Bronze Age burial form in central Europe and Sweden. But there the furniture is very different and almost certainly later in actual date than that from northeastern France or from the rectangular galleries of Brittany, so that the derivation of the last two from central European forms is practically impossible. The rarity of the type in the major Breton centers suggests, as we shall see, that it was brought in by a distinct move- ment from the Paris basin. The structural similarity of the Paris galleries to the sunken galleries of Provence and so ultimately to Iberian and Wes- tern Mediterranean forms is clear, where the holed stone and its probable 108 Thirty tombs are listed by D~chelette, Manuel, I, p. 400 and one or two have been reported since, e.g., Pierre Platte de Presles, Seine-et-Oise; cp.

In discussing this problem Kendrick does not consider southern prototypes on the assumption that the south Iberian tombs are late.1'9 But we have argued on quite other grounds that this Iberian "evolutionary series" does not in fact exist and that the holed stone tombs that are cited by him, i.e. Gor and Cueva di Viera, Antequera,1o are among the first fruits of megalithic architecture. No mention is made, moreover of the fact that the holed stone is a characteristic feature of the tombs of Los Millares,111 where, moreover, the megalithic, as distinct from the dry walled tombs, consist of bulging oblong chambers separated by a partition from a gallery little narrower than the chamber,112 i.e., an incipient form of the gallery with vestibule as found in the north. (Figs. 15 and 16.) "Rectangular" partitioned tombs also occur in Algarve, e.g., Nora and Alcala III.113 As far as Brittany alone is concerned, the proximate source would ap- pear to be, as is generally agreed, northeastern France. Bosch Gim- pera't4 although "tempted to derive (the Paris galleries) from Brit- tany" yet decides that it is, however, more probable that it is in the South, where these types represent the end of an autochthonous development in the Pyrenean culture, that we must seek the point of departure for this type and explain the Breton forms from those of North France and not inversely.115 The burials in the Paris galleries were very numerous and interments in successive periods are in some cases, as at Mureaux'18 indicated by the separation of the bones and grave goods by later pavings. In close geographical proximity to these megalithic galleries, and associated with them in grave goods, are a series of tombs related to the megalithic culture but of very different form. These are the so-called "grottoes" of the Marne, rock-cut tombs excavated in the soft chalk ridges that outcrop in the country immediately to the east of the galleries. In the finer tombs low, vaulted rectangular chambers, from two to nearly four metres square, and one to nearly two metres high, were excavated 109 Kendrick, The Axe Age, p.45. 1o0 Kendrick, op. cit., p. 45. n' Cf.

The main chamber was frequently pre- ceded by a smaller antechamber. The portals at the entrance and between the chambers are extremely small and repeat the features of the holed stones of the galleries, not only in their size and shape, but also in the recessed panels in which they are set. Resembling the design of Cretan and the Provengal tombs in the open sloping "dromos" which leads up to it, the chamber itself is square in the east Mediterranean and Sardinian style and distinct from the circular types characteristic of southwestern Iberia; but the shallow vaulting of the roof resembles that of Palmella, and here again the crown of the vault was frequently opened from above and covered with a rock slab. The careful design here described was restricted to a few of the tombs and these contained fewer burials and a richer furniture. The majority were more roughly hewn, irregularly shaped, and crowded with corpses. But their form and grave goods indicate a class distinction rather than any chronological separation from the finer tombs. The furniture of the galleries and rock-cut tombs of the Paris basin is distinguished from that of the other megalithic areas in the south and west by thefrequency of bone tools, points, picks, axe hafts andeven axes modeled on stone forms.17 Polished flint axes are also more abundant in this area than elsewhere in the west. These characteristics are all associated with the special environment of this area. Deprived of abundant sources of hard igneous and metamorphic rock, but richly supplied with flint from the scarps of the Marne, it is not surprising that bone and flint were used extensively. We have also to consider the probability that pre-megalithic folk, using bone extensively and perhaps already, as Abergus claims, in possession of the technique of grinding flint axes, were occupying this area when the tomb builders first penetrated it. But evidence of the southern source of this occupation is not lacking, the famous "goddess" carvings on the walls of the Marne "grottoes" may be related to anthropomorphic designs on Iberian idols and plaques and to the wall carving in the Dolmen de Soto, Huelva.119 The statue menhirs of the Cevennes region, although of uncertain date, may serve in some in- stances, e. g. Collorgues, as an intermediate link. The frequency of tre- 117 E.g., among the furniture of inhumations beneath slabs at Chateau de Niey. The other furniture was characteristic of the galleries; cp.

The callais beads and greenstone celts also found in the rock-cut tombs, serve further to integrate this culture with the megalithic culture of the south and west. But it is in the meantime uncertain whether these mate- rials were obtained from Brittany or the south. The former is a very prob- able source since there is abundant evidence of the introduction of the northeastern type of gallery into the Breton peninsula, while flint from Grand Pressigny in the west is found in both the galleries and the grot- toes. A bell beaker sherd from Bennemont, Seine and Oise, may also indi- cate southern or Breton connections.120 Childel21 regards this northern culture as very late in date and roughly contemporary with the latest period in the Cevennes, basing this opinion largely on the bronze rings and flanged celts occasionally recovered from the galleries and the relative lateness of trephining in the South. But the synchronism with Breton tombs containing bell beakers (see p. 74) pre- cludes so late a dating and the sporadic objects of Bronze Age date can readily be explained by disturbance or secondary burials. The character- istic furniture throughout indicates a relatively early date for the original settlement of the tomb builders and metal is characteristically restricted to occasional beads and blades of copper in the Marne tombs. Little is known of the megalithic tombs that are scattered through the intervening area between the northeast and the Breton peninsula. The well known tomb at Fontenay le Marmion in Calvados is very different from the northeastern types. Beneath a very large tumulus of blocks of local chalk a dozen passage tombs had been erected in two rows, opening on op- posite sides of the mound. The circular chambers were all corbeled and dry stone walling was used throughout except for the roofing of the gallery. The furniture and burials were mostly contained in small megalithic coffers within the chambers.122 Structurally this monument is most closely related to the Breton corbeled tombs, and the practice of building several passage chambers within a tomb also occurs in Brittany.123 The bell beaker is doubtful, and certainly not characteristic in the cul- ture of northeastern France. In southern France, as in Almeria, it is an 120 Kendrick, Man, 29, 1929, p. 18. 121 Dawn, p. 283. 122 Sausse, Le Tumulus.de Fontenay-le-Marmion, Calvados. Rev. Arch., 1, 1897, pp. 163 ff.

In Savoy, beakers are found both in megalithic and cave burials but in its later history it is di- vorced from megalithic construction, as it was in Murcia and southern Catalonia, and penetrates the continental interior. It may be, as Childe, Siret, and others believe, that the "beaker folk" were already a distinct ethnic element in southern Iberia; it is in any case clear that the ware it- self, in its long history in central Europe and in its reappearance in the west in the Bronze Age culture of Britain, was finally and completely sep- arated from the megalithic civilization in which it first appears. North of the Savoy group the trail is temporarily lost. Bell beakers re- appear, but in a new context,in the copper age cultures of the middle Rhine. They are here associated with a hill fort people whose burial furniture char- acteristically includes copper daggers and archers' wrist guards. In addi- tion to the bell beaker, another strange feature appears in this culture: numerous and large, point-butted polished stone axes, are found in the crouched cist or trench burials. These axes are strangely similar to those of the south Breton tombs. While it is possible that the large point butted celt and the beaker traveled together across France to the Rhineland, we are in the meantime at a loss to explain on this hypothesis the manner in which the two de luxe products of the Breton culture should be transferred many hundreds of miles to a people the atmosphere of whose culture is very remote from the megalithic civilization of the west. Despite the point butted celts therefore, it would seem more reasonable to look for contact across the smaller gaps which separate the Savoy area from the middle Rhine. In Savoy, the bell beaker is intrusive in a poor, ill characterized cul- ture. It is more easy to conceive of its being carried into the Rhineland by the same intrusive and less stable people of the south than by the preoc- cupied builders of Armorica. Schumacher124 bridges the gap between the two areas by invoking the "flint camps" of Lorraine and suggests an approach to the Rhine by the Moselle; Aberg and Bosch Gimpera are more disposed to favor movement through Alsace and the Belfort Gap, for which there is now perhaps some slight direct evidence, since Forrer'25 and Schaefferl26 have claimed beaker influence on certain Alsatian pottery styles found in association with wrist guards and other elements. 124 Schumacher, C., Siedelungs und Kulturgeschichte der Rheinlande, Mainz, 1921. 125 Forrer, R.

S., 32, 1930 More recently Kraft127 and Castillo128 have advocated a more eastern route from the Rhone to the upper Rhine, through the territory of the western lake dwellings. But the beaker was never established in the lake dwellings and it is difficult to believe in a passage however rapid through this region which would leave practically no trace on either the migrants or the occupants. Schumacher has claimed that the introduction of the bell beaker into central Europe was the work of the Middle Rhine culture picturing an original impulse from the Vosges or the Ardennes as a more or less armed invasion resulting in the occupation of a series of fortified posts extending along the Rhine from Spiers to K61n and spreading out into Hesse Wur- temburg, Thuringia and Saxony. It is difficult in the meantime to decide whether the appearance of Iberian beaker forms further east in Bohemia, Hungary and Silesia marks out the last drives of this eastern movement or is an indication of movement across the Brenner from northern Italy. Castillo claims that128 the Upper Austrian beakers are definitely closer to the Italian than to the Rhenish and concludes that the Mediterranean beaker folk penetrated deeply into Saxo-Thuringia to encounter their cousins from the Rhineland. THE MEGALITHIC CIVILIZATION OF BRITTANY But the megalithic culture in western Europe was dominantly a mari- time civilization and its spread northwestwards along the Atlantic coast- lands was far more intensive than the interior expansion so far discussed. The Breton peninsula projecting westwards to the north of Iberia was the scene of a colonization which rivaled the southern Iberian centres in achievement and density of settlement and affords a valuable commentary on the Iberian culture. Although western Iberia and Brittany were at this period in closer contact than any two areas lying at an equal distance, we do not find complete transplantation of any but the main cultural elements. Traded goods and imitated objects undoubtedly exist and there was un- doubtedly extensive migration, but for the most part there is a marked in- dividualization and divergence. The culture of the area will be considered in some detail since, while it is vital to the understanding of the problem, its position is often misrepresented and its essential features are less well known than the Iberian and Danish.

The many islands to the south and far west of this coast were occupied without exception and on some, e. g. Groix, megalithic remains are very numerous. The coastal distribution of the south which links, by littoral extensions and penetrations of the lower reaches of the estuaries, the several major centres of Loire Infirieure, the gulf of Morbihan and southern Finistire, extends on a somewhat diminished scale along the western coasts.

S., 32, 1930 terior distribution and variant tomb types indicate inland movement from south Brittany and the Paris basin to the east. Although we know nothing of the vessels used at this period, the condi- tions of ancient shipping even as late as Roman times force us to realize the great risks and losses involved in open sea journeys along the Atlantic coast. Yet the evidence of distribution and tomb form suggests a direct trans-Biscayan route from Iberia to the Breton peninsula, for megaliths are absent along the shores of southwestern France, while those of the Ven- die and southern Loire Infbrieure have not yielded evidence of the magni- ficence of Southern Morbihan in Brittany and are, moreover, of late and degenerate type.130 The concentration of Iberian goods and parallels on the south Breton coast indicates direct relations between this area and the southern peninsula. The most conspicuous concentration of tombs and settlements lies along the southern coasts of the Department of Morbihan from the etel river to the Gulf of Morbihan, to the south of the towns of Auray and Vannes. This region includes the megalithic remains of the numerous islands of the Gulf, of the peninsulas of Rhuys and Quiberon. Within this compara- tively small zone, less than forty km. long and rarely extending more than ten km. from the open sea, several hundred megalithic structures have sur- vived into recent times. All the more important Breton tomb forms occur, together with stone circles, alignments and solitary menhirs in considerable numbers. The South Morbihan region affords, therefore, an almost com- plete view of the megalithic civilization of Brittany. It appears to have been the earliest and primary, and it was undoubtedly the most important, center of this prehistoric occupation. The standard and most common form in this region is the passage dol- men with rectangular chamber. The dolmen of Kercado, (fig. 26) one of the best preserved monuments in Brittany, to the northeast of Carnac, is of this form. The tomb is enclosed in a round tumulus of very regular form, 3.5 m. high, 20 m. in diameter, and surmountedby a menhir situated over the center of the interior chamber. A megalithic gallery about 7.5 m. led up to this rectangular chamber, 3 m. X 2.5 m and 2.5 m high. The remains of a stone circle surround the tumulus. This'description represents in sum- mary all that was reported by its first modern explorers,131 but the careful excavations of le Rouzic have disclosed structural features of the greatest 130 Cp.

The entrance to the tomb was also carefully built. The gallery splayed out towards the entrance, was largely constructed of dry stone walling and merged into the retaining wall of the tumulus. The paved way curved in to follow the line of this vestibule, on either side of which, near its outer ex- tremities, two hearths were found. A menhir in line with the entrance of the tomb had been erected outside the range of the cromlech, which was broken at this point. Le Rouzic's discoveries at Kercado are of the great- est importance. There is no reason to believe that the structure is in any sense unique; the monument was in a fairly good state of preservation and the retaining wall, paved way and hearths had all been concealed by accu- mulated rubble fallen from the tumulus. A series of concentric retaining walls were discovered by le Rouzic in the tumulus of the corbeled tomb at Ile Longue. He also reports traces of a masonry wall round the ruined Table des Marchands, and a megalithic walling to the tumuli of Manio, Kerlescan and Pendrec in this area.133 Maximum value may therefore be given to the structural features which this monument has retained. Both the design and the methods employed in building the tumulus are obvious- ly related to those recorded by Siret at Los Millares and elsewhere in Iber- ia and recur in the chambered cairns of Scotland. The grave goods included bell beakers, carinated bowls, callais beads and a small green-stone celt.134 Passage dolmens essentially similar to Kercado but in varying states of preservation occur commonly in this region, e. g. Keriavel, Petit Mont,135 Man6 Lud,136 etc. The distinction between the passage and chamber is sometimes less marked, being indicated only by slight angles in the mega- lithic wall and an enlargement of the inner end of the tomb.37"' The famous and long violated tomb on Gavr'inis, about 15 m. long, with its magnifi- cent but problematic carvings, is of this form. (Fig. 27.) The polygonal form of passage dolmen is more rarely met with, although a form better known in S. Finistire, with a very short slab-closed gallery and a rounded chamber, occurs at Ploemeur across the Etel (dolmen de St. 133 B.S.P.M., 1921, p. 85, and Carnac, Fouilles, p. 117. 134 Galles, op. cit., Mus6e Vannes, Musde Miln, Carnac, and verbal information from Z. le Rouzic. 135 See Le Rouzic, Carnac.

The type is well represented at Locqueltas, Locoal-Menden, Er Groh, Erdeven, and Keriavel III, Carnac. The latter yielded bell beaker and other pottery decorated in the combed style and two callais beads.139 The famous tomb of Mane Rutual, Locmariaquer, has a double cham- ber. The smaller first chamber is rectangular and behind it lies a larger polygonal chamber covered by an enormous (now broken) capstone.'40 (Fig. 27). GIVR'IillS LE ROCHER, 'INE RUTUAL FIG. 27. Tomb types in S. Morbihan. (after le Rouzic) The close kinship between the Breton passage-dolmen and the Iberian tomb of similar form is obvious and has long been recognized. In Brittany the chamber is more frequently rectangular and the development of mul- tiple chambers of equal size is special, but the type as a whole is essen- tially the same. As in Iberia, dry walling is used to fill in gaps in the mega- lithic walling. The Gavr'inis type, in which the chamber is but little broader than the gallery, occurs also in Spain. The dolmen de Soto, Huel- va, for example, although a little larger, is constructed in precisely the same manner with a chamber and gallery of similar proportions. Double chambers built one behind the other occur in Iberia, e. g. the Cueva de Romeral, 138 Le Rouzic, Carnac, Fouilles, 1921, p. 19 and fig. on p. 26. 139 B.S.P.M., 1886, p. 95. 140 B.S.P.M., 1860 and 1885; Catalogue du mus6e de la Societe Polymathique, Vannes, p. 25.</page><page sequence="56">74 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 32, 1930 Antequera, Andalucia, where, however, the chambers are circular, vaulted and separated by a short corridor. The straight covered gallery allde couverte is not frequent in southern Morbihan. It is, however, very important elsewhere and, while the distri- bution suggests important and special lines of movement, it is possible to show that it is an integral part of the megalithic culture and virtually contemporaneous with the passage dolmens. The allie couverte du Net, St. Gildas de Rhuys,141 in the S. Morbihan area, contained bell beakers and typical "megalithic" grave goods. The most interesting features of the Kerlescant tomb near Carnac are the two "holed stone" entries, one in a lateral wall in the shorter of the two compartments, and the other in the megalithic wall separating the two. Both these entries had been formed by carving away a semicircular hole on the sides of two adjacent slabs. Lukis reported a similar entry in one side wall in another gallery about 24 m. long at Kertearac, quite close to Kerlescant; this monument has since been entirely destroyed. The passage dolmen of Garen-Dol, Kerlouan, Morbihan, and the laterally chambered Parc-ar dolmen, St. Pol de Ldon, N. Finist~re, also had holed entries constructed in a similar manner.43 Evidence from both tomb and grave goods indicates the close relation between the Breton galleries and those of northeastern France1" and the same form extends into the Channel Islands where the "long cist" of Le Couperon, Jersey, shows detailed structural similarity with the Kerles- cant tomb.145 The tombs of N. Brittany indicate still more strongly the closeness of this connection. In northern Ille-et-Vilaine, the C6tes-du-Nord, the rectangular allie couverte is the standard tomb form. The magnificent tomb of Esse, three kilometres from R6tiers, reproduces all the character- istic features of the galleries of the Paris basin, while Tres6e (Maison des Feins) further north, has another resemblance to the Seine tombs, since it is buried in the ground and shows no trace of a covering tumulus.146 141 Le Rouzic, Z.

The gallery of Ker- bannalec near Beuzec-Cap-Sizun, in the southwest, resembled the Ker- lescant tomb in that a row of megalithic slabs had been erected parallel to the chamber along one side. Its contents relate it definitely to the southern culture, for a carinated bowl with groups of vertical incisions was found, with flint points and a spindle whorl, but the closed gallery is rare in south- ern Finistire and the form of this tomb undoubtedly suggests relations to the northern types.

The walls of the upper gallery are not parallel but splay out at the upper end, suggesting a definite chamber. (Fig. 27.) The gallery of Pierres Plates, whose walls are decorated with a group of very important carvings, is also angled. The inner gallery was closed to form a separate chamber and a lateral chamber was built out at the bend. In S. Finisttre, the right-angled gallery of Poulguen has parallel walls and a division into compartments, suggesting analogy with the Kerlescant type.152 Many of the uprights in both galleries show carvings resembling those of Morbihan, but of a less elaborate character.153 The carvings on Le Rocher, Pierres Plates, Luffang, (another angled gallery considerably ruined) are all of one type, the "octopus" (?) design. A somewhat similar design occurs at Lizo in a tomb probably of the same form,lM while one of the designs carved at Poulguen,'55 is of related charac- ter. The association of this design with the angled gallery may indicate the restriction of a certain motif to a special tomb type and also possibly rep- resents a chronological distinction. On this assumption, the absence of the angled gallery in Iberia suggests its development further north at a period later than the first megalithic occupation of Brittany. It must however be realized that in technique and appearance these designs are closely related to the "buckler" designs of Ile Longue, Mand-er-Hroak, etc. and one or two of the carvings at Pierres Plates are of the "buckler" type156" while the furniture of le Rocher and Lizo is not to be distinguished from that of the megalithic tombs in general, so that the difference in time, if any, is small. Massive closed chambers are also found in the S. Morbihan region. That at Tumiac should perhaps be regarded asa shortened gallery and it is largely built of dry stone walling,157" but the "dolmen" in the west end of Moustoir tumulus of the same form, was entirely megalithic.158 (Fig. 29.) 1562 Martin, A.

The famous tumulus at Man6-er-Hroak was originally a hun- dred metres long. There is no gallery and the megalithic blocks, although of great size, were not orthostatic but disposed horizontally to form a chamber of cyclopean walling 3.9 m. long by 2.8 m. wide and 1.50 m. high, supporting megalithic capstones (fig. 30). On one side of the chamber a carved upright had been erected. The furniture included ten large green- stone axes and nearly a hundred small celts of fibrolite. Callais beads were found with the axes but no pottery is recorded. The mode of burial is very doubtful. It is generally assumed to have been inhumation on the meagre data of Galles' report.

Le Rou- zic, Childe,162 and Bosch Gimperal63 consider them later than the other tombs, while Abergl6 suggests that they are earlier since they contain no bell beakers. These conclusions appear to be very uncertain. It must, in the first place, be realized that only a very small minority of the mega- lithic tombs have been preserved intact for modern exploration, and Tum- iac, Man6-er-Hrotk and St. Michel have probably retained their funiture in virtue of their closed chambers buried in large tumuli with no entrance gallery. Greenstone axes, as such, although so abundant and finely worked, do not constitute a chronological distinction and it is argued elsewhere that the bell beaker is associated with the megalithic culture in Brittany from the beginning. It must also be remembered that Tumiac, although a closed tomb, does not closely resemble Mand-er-Hroak or St.Michel. At JADEITE CALLAIS MeT'~es MAI1E-ER-H ROEK FIG. 30.

The greenstone axes and callais beads, the carvings of Tumiac and Man6-er-Hroak, and the instability of burial practice suggest rather that they are an integral part of it and can have been little earlier or later than the passage dolmens. A well-preserved corbeled "beehive" tomb-the tumulus of Ile Longue -is found on one of the islands of the Gulf. In an elaborately constructed circular tumulus with three concentric retaining walls, is a rectangular chamber with rounded corners, approached by a gallery of megalithic blocks and ashlar walling. The lower part presents very Iberian features in the megalithic walling of the lower part of the chamber.'67. Its corbeled roof was originally nearly five metres high. The tomb was explored in early times and no furniture has been preserved. But apart from the structural features of retaining wall and splayed entrance recalling the conditions discovered later by Le Rouzic at Kercado, its erection in the megalithic period is confirmed by the numerous carvings-discovered in the restoration of the monument in 1907.1e8 The main carvings are of the "buck- ler" type and show clear parallels to the design on the Man6 Rutual passage dolmen capstone, the Table des Marchands headstone, the Mand-er-Hroak pillar and above all to the megalithic block found close by the ravaged tu- mulus of Moustoir.e69 The ruins of other corbeled chambers are found in S. Morbihan e. g. St. Germain, Erdeven. At Rosmeur,'70 near Penmarc'h in S. Finistbre, a corbeled passage tomb was found, together with a covered gallery in a single circular tumulus. The furniture of the gallery, which was better preserved, did not indicate a particularly late date for the monument. Small roughly-made coffers of heaped stones were also used at the same time as megalithic tombs. The graves in the "tertre du Manio" Carnac, built previous to the surmounting alignments of Kermario were of this s166 Le Rouzic, op. cit., p. 31 cf.

The central stone-walled, slab-covered chamber was flanked by a menhir, at the foot of which four polished stone axes were discovered. This chamber was surrounded by a large number of minute square coffers, whose interior measurement was little more than a quarter of a metre each way. These were found throughout the length of the mound. Each was constructed with small blocks of stone and surrounded by other small slabs leaned against the walls. In one, pottery was found in sufficient quantity to determine the close relationship of these tombs to the megalithic cul- ture.172 Similar coffers surround the central "dolmen" of Mont St. Michel and occur in the mounds of Castellic and Crucuny.'3 The indiscriminate passage of the alignment of Kermario, a part of the great system of Carnac alignments, across the low almost imperceptible mound of Manio, undoub- tedly indicates that the former were built later than the tombs and prob- ably after they had been forgotten. Although they are difficult to date, we cannot claim that the alignments are later than the megalithic culture as a whole, so that the coffers themselves are relatively early. (Fig. 31.) ~i ~aja~ d~s. FIG. 31. Small coffers in the Tertre du Manio, Carnac, S. Morbihan (after le Rouzic.) It appears probable that even in Brittany, despite the general hardness of its rocks, rock-cut tombs were occasionally hewn in the softer outcrops as burial places by the megalithic people. Du Chatellier describes "souterr- ains" in Finistire which may have belonged to the megalithic civilization.'74 At Pont Croix, a circular vaulted chamber 2 m. in diameter and 1.6 m. high was approached by a narrow descending cutting 50 cm. wide and 3 m. long. The furniture-black earth, charcoal and pottery fragments-suggest a "megalithic" burial but no details are given.

The entrance is very small but the gallery 7.8 m. long and 2.1 m. wide enlarges to a height of 1.9 m. 175 These descriptions although inade- quate, indicate a form related to the "grottoes" of the Marne. Unfortu- nately no furniture is recorded. Other "souterrains" of different form probably belong to the Iron Age e. g. La Tourelle.176 Du Chatellier also reports two natural caves used as a burial place in megalithic times at Guesseny and Kerouan, Finistire. Both contained cin- ders, polished stone axes, human and animal bones. In the second, cinerary urns "of various periods" were found.177 In Finistbre and elsewhere there occur, together with tombs of more nor- mal types, forms which show considerable variation from those so far dis- cussed.18 They are groups of large chambers flanking a central "dolmen." These grouped chambers were generally erected in sets of two, three or four, the whole system being covered by a long, low tumulus. In some cases, e. g. at Pen-ar-Menez, the central covered chamber might better be called a gallery, although it is quite short. It does not, however, afford access to the flanking chambers in the manner of the multiple-chambered dolmens of Morbihan. The flanking chambers are larger than the central "dolmen", of rectangular form about 2 m. along each side and built in megalithic blocks of varying height. They show no sign of having been covered by megalithic capstones. Sometimes, however, as for example in the group east-north-east of Kervignon and again at Kervastel, a quantity of large stones were found among the upper layers of the earth that filled the chambers. It appears that these chambers were generally protected by heaping rough stone blocks on the top after they had been filled with earth. It is also possible that they were sometimes roofed with wood, which has since disappeared. Between Tronwal and Kervantic are the ruins of a group of four "dolmens" flanked by numerous chambers. At Kervignon a further group was explored by du Chatellier; as elsewhere the large flanking chambers were not covered by megalithic capstones.Y79 Grouped chambers of this type are not confined to the south and occur frequently further north, e.g. the complex tomb of open chambers at Lanildut, Guiligny, N.

The megaliths to the south of the Loire in this department and in the Vendee contrast with those further north in the complicated plans of their chambers, but data are not adequate to attempt to establish precise parallels with Finistare.'83 Slab cists containing burials and furniture similar to that of the mega- lithic monuments are numerous in the west. They are found singly and in groups. Some are below tumuli and others are buried in the ground with no surface indication of their presence. Both inhumations and cremated burials are reported from these cists and from simple trench graves. The grave goods, although generally poor, are not distinct from those of the larger megalithic tombs and are certainly not related to the later Bronze Age culture of the peninsula.'84 In Finistire as in Morbihan we have clear evidence that the mega- lithic chamber was not the only means of disposal of the dead. As in Iberia, trench graves, cave burials and slab-lined cists were all used. Many factors, such as locality, wealth and labor, undoubtedly affected burial practice in different areas and at different times. Although we are justified in speaking of a "megalithic culture" it must nevertheless be recognized that the megalithic tomb was not invariably used. I have shown elsewhere that in relation to the great centre of southern Morbihan, S. Finistire manifests the conditions of a marginal area of lower culture in which there was nevertheless a great density of settlement. The traditions and techniques of megalithic architecture were less firmly rooted and crude but novel tomb forms were developed. This would appear to be equally true of the country south of the Loire in the east and also apart from influence from northeastern France, of north Brittany as a whole. Dominant Iberian influence is again indicated in the tools and orna- ments recovered from Breton tombs and settlements. As in Iberia, handles are not found on the pottery of this period, but flat and pierced lugs, ver- tical and horizontal, are extensively used. Two pottery forms are of the greatest significance, the bell beaker and the carinated bowl. Beakers of varied proportions, workmanship and ornament, although less numerous than the rougher spheroid pots, are characteristic of the entire range of tombs. They are inextricably mixed with other wares and cannot 182 Pitre de Lisle, Mat. 3,1886, pp. 279 ff. and figs. 103-4. 18s3 Ibid., p. 285. 18s4 See Forde, C. D., Ant.

The finest are essentially "Iberian" and of fully developed form. On the whole, however, the ornament is less elaborate and the restraint suggests that it was introduced into Brittany at a date relatively late in its history in Iberia. But as we are unable to correlate it in Brittany with any one type of tomb or a specific region, we cannot decide its chronological position here. The negative evidence of the Man6-er-Hroik tomb-type is quite ambiguous, and since it is found so abundantly in the passage dolmens of the Carnac-Locmariaquer region it would seem most probable that it accompanied the first settlement.

The carinated bowl occurs widely in Iberia. It is associated especially with the "megalithic" tombs and passage dolmens of the south and west. In the Portuguese passage dolmens, as in Brittany, plastic ribs are sometimes used to decorate the concave upper part of the bowl.'86 Their presence reinforces the evidence of the beakers that there was direct traffic by sea between S. Iberia and the Breton peninsula. The "combed" and incised ornament on beakers and other pottery includes obliquely hachured bands, zigzags, incised and reserved, and other patterns known from S. Iberia. But the more elaborate designs of the Palmellan and Andalucian wares do not occur. Renonqcurd PdleeCowierte 5.Funirskxr 0 tO 2IO 3 CriS. FIG. 33. Carinated bowl, Brittany (after du Chatellier). Note the plastic ornament of vertical ribs. But the pottery of the Breton culture was not entirely derived from Iberian forms, and the abundance of plastic ornament, curvilinear bands, knobs and lugs, suggests that early continental fabrics penetrated this area. D~chelettel87 has shown the relation in both form and ornament between such Breton wares and that of the "Camp de Chassey" and other stations in eastern France. More specifically the small flat-bottomed goblets characteristic of the Paris region recur occasionally in Brittany, e. g. La Roche, Dongues, Loire Infirieure, while rough imitations of Baltic dolmen forms ('collared flasks') are also known (Lann-Blaan, Guidel, Morbihan and Kerandrize, Moblan, Finistire).

Marie) it is confined tosouthern Morbihan. In all, over five hundred beads and pendants have been recorded and pre- served. Among the prehistoric collections at Vannes there are no less than 405 beads and pendants from the great tombs of Tumiac (249), St. Michel (107) and Man6-er-Hroik (49). There is also a rich collection in the Mus~e Miln at Carnac from the tombs of St. Michel (29) Man6 Lud (26) and Kercado (203).188 Although well known from many prehistoric sites in western Europe, callais is nowhere, outside Portugal, as abundant as in southern Morbihan. About 130 beads are recorded in Provence a few from southeastern Spain, from the tombs of the French Pyrenees, the Massif Central (Lozbre and Aveyron) and the Marne.s18 The Breton specimens are as fine as any in color and size. Some of the pendants are over 4 cms. long. The beads are small and discoidal in shape with irregular facets; larger olive-shaped beads are more rare. The bead from Motte Ste. Marie,Loire Inf~rieure, was more carefullyshaped than is usual in Brittany. Those of Provence are smaller still and more often cylindrical. The Portuguese beads show a much wider range of size and form. They are olive-shaped, globular, discoid and cylindrical. Cartailhac pointed out that the beads of Morbihan are very rough in com- parison with the finest Portuguese specimens. He placed the Provengal halfway between in quality of workmanship.190 Callais is chemically close to turquoise and the two substances may occur together. But although its character is well known, no west European source for the material has been reported. Brittany is itself an area geologically favorable to its occurrence.'9 But while the existence of large quantities of roughly worked material might favor a Breton source for the callais which was then trafficked back to Iberia and more elaborately worked there, the views that it was carried with the bell beaker into Brit- tany, or again was discovered a second time, locally by Iberians in Brittany, remain equally possible. In any case the distribution of worked callais is of great significance and indicates the extent to which a single ornamental material was adopted through western Europe at this period (cf. map, fig. 4). 188 To the 56 beads already recorded from this tomb are added a further 147, recently discovered by M. le Rouzic. 189 See Marsille, op.

Similar beads have been recovered in England, but they are found in round barrows of the second period of the Bronze Age, while in Iberia, the most probable source of the Breton specimen, this type has been found only in a late grave of the El Argar culture (tomb of Fuente Alamo) where segmented beads in bone and "glass" were found in association with pedestaled bowls and a bronze sword.'93 The discovery of a fragment of a riveted copper (?) dagger indicates that the Carnac bead probably relates to a secondary burial of later date than the fragments of "dolmenic" and bell beaker pottery that were also sifted from the floor. In southern Morbihan considerable numbers of large point butted greenstone celts have been found. Like callais these are especially as- sociated with the three large closed chambers of this area, but similar forms have been found elsewhere in Brittany in passage dolmens, galleries and hoards.'"94 The workmanship is extraordinarily fine and some forms show beveled sides with median ridges and splayed blades characteristic of metal forms. The materials used were jadeite, chloromelanite, various pyrox- enite rocks (augites), and occasionally diorite. These are undoubtedly local, for although outcrops of every variety have not been found, the meta- morphosed pyroxenites and amphibolites of southeastern Brittany are an obvious source for such materials and extend over the precise area from which the axes have been found.'95 (Fig. 34.) But these axes also suggest Iberian connections, for large specimens of very similar form have been reported from Algarve in southern Portugal'96 and Sirett97 records an extensive use of greenstone for axe material at El Garcel and Los Millares in the southeast. 19" Cf.

In the scattered reports of the exploration of tombs in this area the use of gold .and copper by the megalith builders is abundantly proven. Bracelets and armlets of thin sheet gold are reported in southern Morbihan. Two were found in a pot containing cinders and charcoal in one of the three parallel galleries of Rondossec, near Carnac. They are of thin sheet gold, closed by interlocking the thin ends and ornamented by transverse stencil-like cuts in the broader part.206 A "diadem" of thin sheet gold ornamented in a similar manner with horizontal slits is reported from a late cist burial in Algarve in association with "Palmella" copper points.207 TWO smaller bracelets formed of narrow bands of thin gold similarly closed by hooking together the tapered ends were recovered from the ruined dolmen of Belz, Morbihan, in 1862.208 Five small gold strips, the largest 8 cms. long and 2 cms. wide, pierced at each end with six small holes, were found by Le Rouzic in his exploration beneath the floor at Man6 Lud.209 These fragments appear to have been used to decorate the hilts of instruments or weapons. From the tomb of Kerallant II, St. Jean Brevelay, in central Morbihan, a tubular gold bead 1.3 cms. long, formed by rolling a thin sheet and decorated by three incised lines on the edge, was recovered together with a "bracer" and several beakers.210 Nine similar tubular gold beads, the first 1.8 cms. long, were found by Pitre de Lisle in the chamber of Motte Ste. Marie, Loire Infirieure. These are related to the tubular gold beads of Castellet (Provence) and Halliade. The tomb was a divided gallery, 5 m. long, with incinerated remains. The other furniture included a very finely shaped callais bead and a bell beaker also of very superior quality.21 205 Manuel, d'Archeologie Padhistorique 1. 206 Mat., 1865, 2, p. 494; 1867, 3, p. 25; Tr~sors de l'Armorique occidentale, Soc. d'Em.

They were a gold "bracelet" 21 cms. long, 14 cms. wide, three gold hooks and a helix of gold wire. With them were found a beaker and a "bracer" 11 cms. long.212 The report is very summary and the data not adequate to decide whether the bracelet was of the Belz or Rondossec types. Gold hooks are reported elsewhere; le Rouzic recently recovered two hooks in hammered gold from Kercado with the later finds of callais and tanged arrowheads.213 Objects of copper have been more rarely reported. They are, however, well authenticated in certain instances. In the small gallery of Penquer, Plozevet, S. Finistire, with a bell beaker and a "bracer" was found an unriveted copper dagger with a blunt tang. The other furniture included polished stone axes of normal type of diorite and fibrolite, a greenstone pendant, a conical V-pierced bone button and a very finely worked laurel leafed arrowhead.214 A similar dagger was recovered from the grouped chambers of Souc'h.215 Du Chatellier describes them both as "bronze" but no analyses had been made. They are of the west European type that can be paralleled in Iberia and south Italy and there is little doubt that the Breton, like the former, are of copper.216 Metal objects were also recovered from the group of tombs at Lesconil.217 one reported in Loire Infirieure, and a "quadrangular bonze point" in this tomb is surprising since further westcallatsand Armorican arrowtips never occur together. There were altogether seven chambers below the tumulus, but the others were damaged. In the center was a sus- piciously Bronze Age "pyramid of stones." We can only conclude that the tomb was either very late and one of the few transition burials in Brittany or else less "intact" than Pitre de Lisle has claimed. 212 De Mortillet, Une serie d'explorations $ Plouhinec, pres Lorient, Mat. 1, 1884, p. 378. 213 Verbal information and Mus6e Miln, Carnac. 214 du Chatellier, P.

S., 32, 1930 The forms of the greater number of these chambers suggest that they were constructed in the megalithic period218 but when investigated by du Chatellier in recent times they showed signs of serious disturbance and may have been used by Bronze Age people. In an oval-chambered passage dolmen in this group (11 m. long with chamber 3 m. by 5 m. and deeply excavated in the ground) two flat, straight-sided "bronze" celts and a "bronze" chisel were found with the incinerated remains in the chamber.219 In the same chamber were found eight flat amber beads each pierced laterally with three holes.220 Amber is recorded nowhere else in megalithic Brittany. In form these beads resemble the center pieces of the Danish passage grave necklaces. A copper dagger, 13.5 cms. long, similar to that of Penquer, was found in another chamber in this group. Late Bronze Age objects, i.e. winged celts etc. had previously been recovered by peasants from the neighborhood of this necropolis. Flat copper axes, similar to that of Lesconil have been recovered as stray finds in Brittany. They are quite distinct from the metal objects of the Bronze age tombs.221 The condition of Lesconil was, as we have seen, too unsatisfactory to permit of definite conclusions, but since the Bronze Age people entered Brittany with an advanced metallurgical technique, and the unflanged celt was rare, it is difficult to attribute these rough axes to them. It would therefore appear most probable that they do indeed belong to the megalithic culture and are related to the flat copper celts of Southern Iberia (Algarve, Los Millares and the later culture of El Algar) and the Mediterranean.222 The V-pierced button from Penquer, which is very rare in megalithic Brittany, tends to confirm the southern derivation of the copper daggers and flat celts. Copper bangles are reported in Finistbre from Souc'h and St. Dreyel. These monuments in the commune of Plouhinec are both grouped cham- bers. The ornaments of Souc'h were helixes of copper wire, the larger 2'18 Cp. cit., cf. Plate III. 219 Op. cit., p. 40. These celts have not been analysed but are probably copper. 220 Op. cit. p. 41. 221 Ep. Pr~h. p. 44-45. 222 This suggestion is perhaps weakened by Marseille's discovery of a fiat copper celt, 12.9 cms. long, a tanged copper dagger, 13.5 cms. long, and the lower portion of the blade of another, 6 cms. long, in a Bronze Age cist-the tumulus of Coet-en-Garf, Elven, (Morbihan), -associated with a riveted Bronze Age dagger, 20 cms. long and 29 magnificent Armorican Bronze Age arrowheads. It is possible, however, to regard this tomb as early and to some extent transitional, for unriveted copper daggers are not typical of these tombs and cannot therefore be regarded as indicating Bronze Age intrusion when found in megalithic tombs.</page><page sequence="73">FORDE] CULTURES OF ATLANTIC EUROPE 91 bracelets had two twists. The smaller "ring" was precisely paralleled at St. Dreyel, where a small flat copper (?) chisel was also recovered. In both tombs typical "megalithic" stone axes, pendants and pottery223 accom- panied these metal objects.224 A gold helix from Kerouaren, Morbihan, has already been noted. Helical bangles and rings first appear in Spain at El Argar.225 They are here of copper, bronze, silver, and gold. Flat unflanged copper and, oc- sionally, bronze celts are abundant. Since callais persists in this culture one is inclined to consider the helixes and flat celts of Finistbre and southern Brittany as evidence of Iberian contact at a late period in the megalithic culture of Brittany, when the El Argar culture was beginning its career in Almeria. But helical gold rings also occur in Algarve, where they may also be relatively late (e.g. the cist of Quinta da Aqua Branca) with closed rings of gold, a thin gold strip and an unriveted copper dagger.226" The finds here reported undoubtedly indicate an acquaintance with the tools of the western Copper Age and with simple gold ornaments. Flat copper axes, unriveted daggers and gold objects may, moreover, have been in use among the megalithic people for a considerable time before they were deposited in tombs. The existence of so called "bracers" which Siret and Sophus Miiller more reasonably regard as whetstones227" also suggests a use of copper more extensive than is indicated by the grave finds. It cannot, however, be claimed that the megalithic people made extensive use of metallurgical knowledge. The workmanship is rudimentary and poor. Although, on the one hand, the finds imply that they were not entirely ignorant of the use of metals and were therefore capable of iden- tifying and exploiting ores, it is quite certain, on the other hand, that no advanced techniques were introduced or developed during the megalithic period in Brittany. BRITISH ISLES The megalithic culture penetrated the British Isles. Extensive settle- ments and many ruined chambers are found throughout western and northern Britain. Although there are faint traces of early movements 3 Cf. Du Chatellier, Pot~ries pr~historiques, Plate I, 2; V, 14; IX, 12; XII, 6; II, 2. 224 Mus~e de Kernuz, and Ep.

The distribution reflects their southern origin but extensive demolition of tombs and the surprising scantiness of grave goods have obscured precise relationships. In Devon and Cornwall, where the first impact of Breton or Iberian migrants might be expected, the meg- alithic remains, although abundant, have been rifled with such complete- ness that their typological relationships are quite uncertain. The open flint-bearing chalk uplands of Wiltshire and the similarly unforested Cotteswold Hills were the scene of extensive settlements. The chambers of this area were built in "long barrows," an elongated mound of a form occasionally found in Brittany.229 The multiple chambers of many of English and Welsh "passage graves" and the frequency of cremation also suggests that Brittany was the dominant intermediary (fig. 35).

Megalithic chambers are lacking in the long barrows of the south- ern parts of Wiltshire and Dorset. Local supplies of suitable stone are lack- ing in these more southerly districts and the culture was apparently not sufficiently vigorous to induce the transportation of megalithic blocks over long distances, as was done in Iberia and in Britain itself in the later, Bronze Age, monument of Stonehenge. 228 Cf.

The burned timber found in these barrows suggests that here the megalithic chamber was reproduced in wood and consumed by fire after the completion of the interments.230 But voyagers from the south along the western coasts introduced the passage tomb in a less degenerate form in the remote northerly parts of the island. The chambered cairns of western and northern Scotland are corbeled tombs with precise analogies in southern Iberia. The greater number are found in three groups in the maritime parts of Argyllshire on the west coast, Sutherland, Caithness on the northeastern mainland, and in the Orkney islands to the far north. ~"-~~""`` '' " :? .? .~ r - O I? rr r ?: ?,? s,\ FI~ a O (o to to oO ?OFr) FIG. 36.

At Camster the passage tombs, two in this instance, opened in the side of the cairn but usually, e.g. Yar- house, Ormiegill etc., the chamber is built at the wider, higher end of the mound and the passage leads into it between the horns.

Among the small group of chambered cairns in Sutherland one long cairn at Skelpick has two circular chambers linked by a short passage,231 231 Anderson, J., Scotland in Pagan Times, The Bronze and Stone Ages, 1886, p. 264, fig. 259,</page><page sequence="77">PORDE] CULTURES OF ATLANTIC EUROPE 95 reminiscent of the Iberian type, best known in the Cueva de Romeral, Antequera, Andalucia. In the same area, large circular cairns are found (fig. 37, 2). These con- tain chambers of essentially the same type, projecting megalithic slabs be- ing used to separate the compartments of the usually triple chamber. But the form of the chamber is often rectangular and the clear distinction be- tween chamber and gallery sometimes lost. Remarking the architectural degeneration and similarity in plan of these round chambered cairns to the later bronze age mounds in which no chamber was built, Anderson suggested that the round type is later in this area232 and the round cairns of Camster and Yarhouse certainly show various degrees of deterioration in tomb design.233 But the scanty furniture recovered does not indicate any con- siderable difference in period, and the round cairns, like the horned, afford evidence of the careful construction of a double walling which surrounded and limited the mound, similar in purpose and appearance to the wallings found in Iberia and Brittany. The chambered cairns of all forms precede the Bronze Age invasion which introduced the continental beaker, riveted daggers and spear-heads of bronze which are found in the cist and trench burials of the formless cairns of this later age.234 While the chambered cairns of the mainland are of types familiar in Iberia and Brittany, the Orkney tombs, of which Maes Howe is the most famous, are still more remarkable. They reproduce in dry-stone walling the Sardinian and Balearic features of rectangular chambers and lateral niches. The latter are rare in Iberia outside Los Millares, Almeria, and the magnificent tombs of Alcali in Algarve in the west. Such elaborate architecture in these remote northern islands no doubt indicates, as Childe suggests, that they afforded harborage on the circuitous route round northern Scotland by which Baltic amber and English jet reached southern Iberia and the western Mediterannean.235 But although there can be no doubt that Iberian and Breton traders and colonists touched at numerous points on British shores, there is a break in the cultural continuity, the greater part of the grave goods that were so characteristic of the continental cultures are lacking. No callais beads or bell beakers crossed the Channel, although the latter are abundant in the Channel Islands in tombs of Breton type, and the few potsherds recovered 232 Anderson, pp. 263-4. 233 Anderson, figs. 249-256. 234 Cp.

S., 32, 1930 in the south, e. g. from West Kennet long barrow, Wiltshire, belong rather to early central European and Baltic groups. Iberian and Breton types are restricted to carinated bowls and occasional greenstone celts found in the Scottish cairns and laurel leaf arrowheads of superior technique which have been recovered both in Scotland and southern England. It would seem that although expeditions and settlements from Brittany and Iberia reached Britain, the extensive colonization and intercommunica- tion so characteristic of the more southern areas, was attenuated here. Domestic animals, agriculture, and the elaborate funerary ritual were propagated within the island, but external contact and traffic was precar- ious. Amber beads and flint daggers of Danish passage grave type are found in the round barrows of the early Bronze Age in Britain and show clearly that the invasion of eastern England by continental beaker folk cut short the earlier Atlantic culture in southern Britain.236 But the megalithic tradi- tion exerted considerable influence on the invaders who adopted the cus- tom of building ceremonial stone circles and elaborated this megalithic form in the magnificent monument of Stonehenge. The continuance of southern traffic is indicated by the "Iberian" oculi and incised ornament on the limestone "drums" from Folkton, Yorkshire,237 and the spool-shaped beads that are frequently met with in the barrows of the early Bronze Age, and later in the second period by the segmented blue paste beads of late Middle Minoan type. These have been recovered from the later round barrows of Wiltshire and were imitated locally in Scotland. But the continental invasion did not so seriously disturb the western- most outpost of the megalithic culture in Ireland. The magnificent tombs of the eastern coast indicate that the implantation here was part of the pro- cess that carried the corbeled tomb up the western coast of Britain. The famous tomb of New Grange is more closely related to the Scottish cairns than to the long barrows of southern England. The carvings of New Grange have long been compared to those of Gavr'inis in Brittany and more recently Breui1238 and Macalister239 have instituted a systematic com- parison of the carvings on megalithic blocks in Ireland with those of other areas, tracing relationships with Brittany, Galicia and southern Iberia. 236 Cf.

At a later period when separate graves had superseded the megalithic tomb the El Argar culture exerted considerable influence in Ireland, which became a center whence, in connection with the gold trade, late Iberian types were carried eastwards to England and the continent.240 THE NORTHERN MEGALITHIC CULTURES The megalithic culture of the Baltic is best known in Denmark, archaeo- logically the most carefully explored territory in Europe, but it extended eastwards beyond the Oder in the north German coastlands of Mecklen- burg and Pomerania, southwest into Hanover, Oldenburg and the province of Drenthe in northern Holland, and northwards along the southern and eastern coasts of the south Swedish peninsula.241 In Denmark the megalithic tombs are concentrated on the Islands of the Cattegat and the eastern shores of the peninsula and the grave goods are from the beginning blended with central European elements. Accord- ing to the culture sequence which has been so elaborately worked out for the Danish area the earliest megaliths are rectangular chambers without galleries, buried in round or oval tumuli.242 Simple in construction and built of massive slabs, the type is most reminiscent of northern Spanish forms and detailed parallels are afforded by tombs in this area. The practices of nar- rowing the entrance by converging the upright slabs and of closing the chambers with a slab only half the height of the entrance are to be found in both regions,243 (fig. 38) and in one "dolmen" of this type in N. Spain was found the broken half of a bored axe which may be of Scandinavian provenance .244 240 Crescentic gold plaques, "lunulae," of Irish type are reported from "dolmens" in Galicia, (Sivelo, R. B.Antiguedades de Galicia, 1875, pl. on p. 110, quoted by Breuil, op. cit., p. 77,) and from Breton Bronze Age tombs. 241 Cf.

The characteristic pottery, angular bowls decorated in the "rich style" with "comb," shell, cord and incised ornament, derive both form and decoration from the south and can in many instances be precisely paralleled in Iberia and the western Mediterranean. "Oculi" and rayed circles occur in later bowls of this type which, if not imports, denote the continuing influence of southern types. The reflex of this southern inspiration is to be seen in the amber orna- ments of southern Iberia, often reproducing Danish forms, and the triply bored amber "center pieces" of Lesconil, Finistbre. But central European and Danubian traits are again prominent, as in the angular two-bladed battle axes, the pedestaled bowls and ladles, while the beaker in its continental form begins to penetrate at the end of the period.246 That the smaller closed dolmens continued to be built in the period of the passage graves is clear from the frequent merging of grave goods. The richly ornamented pottery is found in the smaller tombs of Jutland247 while "dolmen" pottery has been recovered from passage graves in the same area, e. g. Birkelund and Mogenstrup, East Jutland, the pot- tery from which included examples similar to that from the earliest known dolmens.248 Such finds throw doubt on the schematic view that the passage graves are invariably later than the smaller tombs, and, at the very least, there was considerable overlap between the two forms of tomb. Similarly passage graves continued in use for a very long time in some areas and con- tain in the upper layers of the burial remains characteristic of the later cists and separate graves.. The passage grave builders extended southwards into Holland (Drenthe etc.) carrying with them a tomb furniture in the main characteristic of the Danish area.249 At a later period, corresponding with the full Bronze Age in central Eu- rope, a subterranean megalithic gallery with holed stone entry was intro- duced. This form extended into Sweden and northeastern Germany. In Denmark the culture of these so-called "long cists" is completely merged with that of the separate graves.

The most obvious parallels are afforded by the gal- leries of northeastern France and since objects of late type have been recovered from some of these tombs it is possible that they afforded an in- direct prototype for the Scandinavian "long cist." In the absence of any similarity in grave goods such a relation has generally been rejected and an eastern origin sought for both forms. But the north French galleries are associated with rock-cut tombs and the grave goods are on the whole of southern type while the similarities of the French and Scandinavian galler- ies are too close to admit of completely diverse origins. At the end of the long cist period in Scandinavia, bronze tools and orna- ments began to penetrate the area and became abundant in the rich bronze age of the north.
