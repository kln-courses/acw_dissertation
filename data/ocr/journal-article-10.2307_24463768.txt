<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANDREW McRAE Fluvial Nation: Rivers, Mobility and Poetry in Early Modern England In 1665, Sir Edward Turner, Speaker of the House of Commons, addressing the King and a joint-sitting of the Houses of Parliament, reflected on the function of rivers within the nation: "Cosmographers do agree that this Island is incomparably furnished with pleasant Rivers, like Veins in the Natural Body, which conveys the Blood into all the Parts, whereby the whole is nourished, and made useful."1 The analogy seems natural enough, suggested by the respective technologies of cartography and anatomy which had flourished in preceding decades. The associated perception of national space, however, is at once innovative and politically radical. Rivers drain water within localized environments; for the Speaker, however, the comparison with the circulation of blood, demonstrated by William Harvey a generation earlier, suggests a model of spatial cohesion founded on mobility. Crucially, the "blood" being conveyed through the veins (upstream, the statement suggests) is more than water; it is human traffic and merchandise. The logic is clarified as Turner continues: "Therefore we have prepared some Bills for making small Rivers navigable; a Thing that in other Countries hath been more experienced, and hath been found very advantageous." His model of nature thereby underpins a program of political intervention, to pro mote the navigation of inland waterways and the circulation of goods and people. This is an essay about the cultural meanings of rivers in early modern England.

Most notably, in Michael Drayton's poetic essay in chorography, Poly Olbion, rivers are given voices, and bear much of the poem's burden of historical and topographical description.5 As Richard Helgerson has argued, the multiplicity and local rootedness of such voices encodes an "antipathy to royal centrism," and underpins an associated project to locate rival sources of authority.6 Within this broad critical context, I want to focus specifically on the vision presented so graphically in the parliament of 1665. This vision is in many respects more pragmatic and materialistic than those of either Leland or Drayton; however, it is also, arguably, even more imaginative and influential in its reconception of national space. Rivers do not necessarily carry human or mercantile traffic, and so they are not necessarily indices of anything other than hydraulic processes of circulation. But they hold the potential to facili tate social and economic flows, and in the course of the early modern 2. See esp. Wyman H.

Such texts give shape, I want to argue, to a powerful fantasy of circulation. The essay therefore engages in ongoing debates over the meanings and values of mobility in early modern England. Recent scholarship has attended usefully to the ways in which orthodox assumptions of stability and placement—social and geographical alike—were challenged by the unavoidable facts of mobility.7 Gradually, across the period, unsettled ness was encoded as a condition of existence for the laboring poor.8 Gradually, the tinkers, chapmen, and other petty traders whose activities were fundamental to the development of a national economy, emerged from the weight of calumny and the very real threat of punishment that pressed upon them well into the seventeenth century." Gradually, that is, relations between subjects and spaces were reconfigured. Discourse on rivers, I want to suggest, provided a critical space in which contemporaries could perform this cultural work. Human traffic on rivers, in comparison to roads, was never going to be particularly significant; the real potential of travel on inland waterways was its unquestionable capacity to cut the costs of internal trade, especially for weighty and bulky items.'" Yet the very nature of rivers heightened their status, prompting reflections on mobility per se. Rivers are figures of mobility mapped onto the land scape, at once evocative of place yet curiously placeless. For John Donne, reflecting on transience in The Anniversaries, they undermined assumptions of continuity: "Nor are, (although the river keep the name) / Yesterday's η.

It becomes necessary to attend to struggles over domestic travel, and the ways in which these contributed, more generally, to the fraught production of space. For space, as Henri Lefebvre has taught us, is a human product, shaped by social, economic, and ideological forces.13 While this model has been influential in studies of particular environ ments, such as the early modem city, it equally directs attention to spatial connections and interactions. As other studies have demonstrated, ten sions between an ongoing cultural commitment to placement on the one hand, and an emergent regime of exchange and liquidity on the other, at once shaped economic practice and informed English culture more widely.14 In this context, internal geographical mobility emerges as a key, and somewhat overlooked, issue.15 To sustain this inquiry it is necessary to look beyond the existing canon of river poetry. This essay considers discourse on rivers more widely, attending to pivotal debates over their ownership and usage. To the extent that it is drawn back to the poetry of rivers—as it is, repeat edly-—it looks not only to familiar landscape poetry but equally to works produced by those more directly involved in the business of river travel: the poetry of the waterman. The essay's first section frames the period's central debates over the meanings of rivers, analyzing their political and legal status, and demonstrating the power of discourses of placement and myths of locality. The subsequent section focuses on the literature of river travel, tracing formative arguments for mobility and examining above all the work of John Taylor.

For all its fundamental conservatism, the mid-seventeenth century river poem is a very different thing from the Tudor river poem, just as the meanings of rivers in the 1650s are radically different from those of the 1550s. Before the nation's rivers could be imagined as a coherent network, they first had to be traced and documented, recorded in the pages of Eliza bethan and Jacobean books devoted to the project of describing the nation. William Harrison is best known today for his "Description of England," published as a preface to Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles (1577 and 1586). Its value as a source for social and economic history is largely attributable to its preference for analysis over mere description. Harrison, who admits at the outset that he has rarely "travelled 40. miles foorth right at one journey in all my life," divides the "Description ofEngland" thematically, and assesses his evidence critically.16 Yet this text was pre ceded by a companion-piece (not available in a full modern edition), the "Description of Britain," which functions in a very different manner. The "Description of Britain" devotes sixty-eight folio pages (which amounts to over one quarter of Harrison's total contribution to the Holinshed volumes), to a survey of the island's river systems. By contrast to the magisterial assessments familiar to readers of the "Description of England," this is throughout less assured, and at times almost apologetic. Harrison openly rues the inadequacy of his sources, presenting not so much a "full discourse" as "a mangled rehearsall of the residue set downe and left in memorie" (I, 45). Nonetheless, his project, with its underly ing goal of comprehensive spatial description structured around the trac ing of river networks marks a pivotal moment in understandings of the nation's waterways. Harrison was ruefully aware that he was working just a year or two ahead of the cartographer Christopher Saxton, some of whose maps he evidently viewed before their publication in 1579. Aided by Saxton's work in his description of the Darwent in Kent, Harrison pauses to 16. The quotation is from Harrison's dedication to Sir William Brooke, which precedes all ofhis contributions to Holinshed's volumes: Chronicles, 3 vols. (London, 1587), I, sig. A2V.

(I, 51).17 A comparison of the respective projects of the two men, however, is instructive. Both suggest a certain cohesion intrinsic to the land: a co hesion that, for Harrison, encompasses Wales and Scotland, takes little account of county borders, and virtually no account at all of landowners. Nationhood is here coterminous with a demonstrable geographical unit: a notion that would be useful, though never conclusively so, for the Stuart monarchs. Yet Harrison's text, in contrast to Saxton's, favors the descriptive form of an itinerary, and this at once reinforces and extends the map's assumptions of spatial connectedness and accessibility.18 As he works his way around the coast, exploring river systems from their mouths to their sources, he adopts the conceit of his text as "the report of an imagined course taken" along all the waterways (I, 45). Accord ingly, the text is punctuated with personal pronouns and active verbs: "we rowed," "we come unto," "we sailed on," and so forth (I, 54, 51, 76).19 Harrison is not ignorant of the manifold difficulties facing any actual traveller on the rivers; indeed, he begins his description by regretting that he has been unable to record such fluvial qualities as "length, bredth, depth ofchanell (for burden) ebs, flowings, and falles," while an early passage worries over incompatible interests on the Medway (I, 45, 46). Y et such pragmatic concerns increasingly give way to the imperatives of what Harrison calls "our poeticall voiage," in the course of which he "imagin[es] a journeie . . . whither as yet it hath not beene my hap to travell" (1.65, 1.81). Underpinning this imaginedjourney is an assumption of uncontested movement, at once associated and textually enabled by association with the element of water. In this initial section, in order to establish a framework for the debates to be traced throughout, I want to explore the politics of this assumption, setting the interrelated projects of chrorography and cartography in relation to the laws and customs of river usage. Without question, the relation between the circulation of water and the movement of people was more fraught and contested than Harrison's conceit allows. 17· By the time of Holinshed's second edition, of course, Saxton's Atlas had been published; however, Harrison's text was not amended. 18.

He was doubtless familiar with contemporary theories of the natural circulation of water: that it was drawn from the sea through underground channels, issuing as springs which initiated the flow of rivers. Presumably he was also aware of the ories which held that all rivers of the earth were "tributaries and branches of a great circular system," versions ultimately of the Jordan.20 Such beliefs lent credence to his imaginary journey, underwriting its assump tions of accessibility and connectedness. Yet he must also have had at least a rudimentary grasp of the practical and legal barriers which restricted travel on the rivers he traced. The decline in the extent of river transportation during the late Middle Ages was due partly to a decrease in population, but partly also to an increase in obstructions, such as locks and weirs.21 These served local interests—weirs, for instance, regulated the flow of water to serve mills, and preserved fish-stocks for neighbor ing properties—but created inevitable problems for those operating boats. Weirs could be difficult for boats to cross, while the single-gate "flash-locks" (the predecessor of modern, double-gated "pound-locks") were typically operated by landowners who might not wish to open the gates and consequently alter the level of water on one side or the other.22 The perception of such obstacles as unjust restrictions on the rights of the commons was encoded in British law by the Magna Carta, and was reg ularly invoked in legislation and popular discourse.23 Harrison himself refers to an unnamed "act ofparlament," by the authority of which "the water-courses . . . were surveied and reformed throughout England" (I, 106). Robert Kett's 1549 petition, which articulated a whole swathe of popular concerns relating to property and land-usage, begs simply "that Ryvers may be ffre and comon to all men for fyshyng and pas sage."24 But this, like most goals of popular rebellions, remained no more than an ideal. 20.

While the imaginary nature of Harrison's "poeticall voiage" allows him to avoid the question of property rights over rivers, this matter unquestionably exercised the minds of landowners, travellers and lawyers. Who owned rivers? The law recognized three constituent parts of a river—the bed, banks and water—and acknow ledged property rights in the bed and banks, and usage rights in water. A crucial distinction, however, was drawn between "navigable" and "non navigable" rivers. Navigable rivers were recognized as public highways, open to transportation in the same way as the open roads. Their beds were owned by the Crown, and while their banks were often acknowledged to lie in private hands, boatmen were nonetheless ceded rights to stop and to unload goods.25 Non-navigable rivers, by comparison, were recog nized as private property, giving the owner of one or both banks control over the bed, banks, and rights of access. The owner of such a river could therefore erect weirs or locks, and prevent boats from mooring on his or her land. The crucial distinction between navigable and non-navigable was, prima facie, determined by the extent of tidal flow upstream. In the eyes of the law, a tidal river was assumed to be navigable, while a non tidal river was assumed to be non-navigable.26 Inevitably, problems arose in the definitional grey areas, such as stretches of tidal rivers which were unsatisfactory for traffic and had been treated as private by the adjacent landowners, or stretches of non-tidal rivers which had nevertheless been used for transport over a period of time or were eminently suitable for such use. Such contested zones brought popular perceptions of circulation into collision with a property owner's assumptions of rights of contain ment and exclusion. The status of running water was more stable legally, though equally vexed in practice. The seventeenth-century jurist Robert Callis com pared running water to the sea and the air, and argued that "it should be strange that the Law of property should be fixed upon such uncertainties, as to be altered into Meam, Team, Suam, before these words can be spoken, and to be changed in every twinckling of an eye, and to be more uncertain in the proprietor, then a Camelion of his Colours." But his conclusion is 25- H. J. W. Coulson, The Law Relating to Waters, Sea, Tidal, and Inland, 4th edn. (London, 1924), p. 77. 26.

This was precisely the problem with weirs and locks. To a boat man forced to wait at a lock, sometimes for days, until the owner was prepared to bend to the interests of traffic over those of locality, the lawyer's comparison between running water and the air might have seemed somewhat strained.28 Similarly, to one struggling to keep a boat afloat on stretches of river rendered artificially shallow by the actions of landowners, or forced even (in the terms of the period) "to buy Streams or Flashes of Water of the Millers," the prevailing legal beliefs might have seemed thoroughly provocative.29 Early efforts by the state to improve navigation were often successful only in clarifying the lines of dispute. For much of the early modern period the main instruments of reform were Commissions of Sewers, royal commissions consisting basically of chief local landowners, which had the power to compel clearance projects, but no authority to redefine the status of a non-navigable river.3" For the extension of river naviga tion, therefore, these were effectively useless. Indeed, extant records of inquiries initiated by such commissions provide ample evidence of the prevailing interests of property and locality. One respondent to an inves tigation into navigation on the Medway in the early seventeenth century, for instance, argued that weirs were useful "Fences betwixt Neighbour and Neighboure"; another commented, of the Wye, that fords could serve as important "waies of husbandry" within a region.31 More pro foundly, some people unquestionably feared on the one hand "the exportacion of the native and necessary comodities of [their] country," and on the other hand the "ymportacion of things unnecessary as wynes, frutes spices &amp;c."32 While it might seem easy enough to dismiss such voices on the grounds of self-interest, they articulate with some clarity a 27- The Reading of That Famous and Learned Gentleman, Robert Callis (1647), p. 56.

They invoke a discourse of place and custom, which privileges personal relationships between neigh bors, valorizes methods of husbandry that are perceived as traditional, and resists the expansion of trade beyond known local borders. Simply put, in the terms of this discourse it is more important to be able to cross a river in order to get to a local marketplace than to send produce down the river in order to participate in a national or international market. Within this discursive context, those people who were actively involved in river traffic were translated into objects of fear. In London, the Watermen's Company was the only trade company formed by act of Parliament in order to control its members' behavior.33 The act of 1555, establishing the company, described existing watermen as "ignorant, and unskilful," and for the most part "masterless men, and single men." Their essential placelessness was perceived, further, to frustrate efforts to press them into service in the navy at times of war; "for that they have no known place of abiding," the act claims, they "do, for the most part, absent and convey themselves into the country, and other secret places."34 In the course of the early modern period these terms of denigration echoed across the country. Despite the efforts of the Tudor governors, watermen remained, in the popular imagination, radically unplaced, occupying that which is not property, and making their homes on the flowing streams of the nation's rivers. Defined by mobility, their very existence threatened assumptions of placement and local identity. Time and again in contemporary polemic, therefore, they are dismissed as drunkards and thieves: "the worst and meanest sort of people," according to one representative statement.35 Another early seventeenth-century petition complains that, through their use of tow-paths, "They have been the occasion of much strife betwixt neighbour and neighboure, in that they have (with their rowinge alonge the Ryver) troden downe the Fences betwixt them, and have letten in the Cattell of one man, into an other mans meadowe, and sometyme into the Corne." Moreover, they have bought oxen, which would otherwise have been used to plough 33- Laurie Ellinghausen, "The Individualist Project ofjohn Taylor 'The Water Poet'," Ben Jonson Journal 9 (2002), 149. 34.

"They are," therefore, "the decay of husbandry."36 Social historians such as A. L. Beier have valuably explored the lives of the period's "mas terless men": those people, in other words, unfixed by hierarchical social relationships and stable geographical location.37 Watermen, despite their active employment, were stigmatized similarly. To those who were committed to the period's orthodox models of social hierarchy and com munity, watermen personified the potent challenges of spatial transience and independent labor. There is an instructive contradiction between the "poeticall voiage" that Harrison shared with his readers and the prevailing loathing directed against those involved in actual river voyages. This contradiction, I would suggest, is in fact inherent in Harrison's text, just as it is in other contemporary modes of spatial representation. While his "Description" "gestures at the multiplicity of possible journeys across the map of the nation," the pleasures of spatial knowledge are predicated, for author and reader alike, on a commitment to placement.3* Indeed the specifically textual experience of space is proffered as a preferable alternative to travel— or, to use the near-synonym often employed by contemporaries to describe movement within the nation, travail—itself. Similarly, Saxton's Atlas, with its engorged rivers but no roads, was not specifically intended to facilitate mobility. His maps are, above all, "emblems of a settled landscape, ruled through the institutions Saxton used to represent the settlements: churches, cathedrals, gentry estates and nobles' castles, and private parks."39 In Lefebvre's terms, maps, and other comparable forms of spatial description, come increasingly throughout the early modern and modern eras to serve the interests of "abstract space": "the space of the bourgeoisie and capitalism." Abstract space, he argues, dissolves local identities; it tends towards homogeneity, and is characterized by "ex change and communications," and therefore by "networks."4" But spatial history, as Lefebvre himself stresses, is a history of multiplicity and struggle; social space, in his perception, is "more reminiscent of flaky mille-feuille pastry than of the homogeneous and isotropic space of classical (Eucli dean/Cartesian) mathematics."41 Hence, I would argue, the works of BL Add.

The inert space between places—space, that is, that sets places apart and as a result makes them distinct—is thus just as important as the possible routes that might be imagined to connect these places. Authors of chorographies, in the following decades, typically endorsed this logic. Chorography developed in the shadow of Elizabethan writers and cartographers such as Harrison and Saxton; however, in many respects it worked against the emergent spatial logic of its predecessors, reasserting profoundly traditional assumptions of place. In the early Stuart era, in fact, chorography became increasingly localized in character, focusing more often on individual counties and on the genealogies of principal landholding families.43 It was a genre, in other words, committed more to acts of distinction than exercises in abstraction. Nonetheless, the spatial logic of the itinerary, adopted by many chorographers, always asserted a powerful countercurrent to these efforts of containment, sug gesting a potential connectedness. In several instances, as for Harrison, rivers provided these structural lines.44 Increasingly, also, this logic would be invoked more urgently in other kinds of texts entirely, many of which have been overlooked by existing essays in spatial history. Such texts were more immediately concerned with the actual business of travel on the rivers, and with the lives of those involved in this business. IV Those travelling the English waterways left few records. Their ventures could not be rendered heroic or exotic, like those of international trav ellers; domestic travel, though an undeniable fact of quotidian life, rarely registers in contemporary texts. Yet it is possible to trace, in the face of these severe cultural constraints, nascent efforts to refashion these pre vailing negative images.

These debates reached a peak in the sec ond half of the seventeenth century, and as a result the discussion here will gradually be drawn toward this era of reform. But I am concerned less with historical eventualities than with processes of contestation and change across the period. By attending to the traces left by those actively involved in river travel, however fragmentary or partial these may be, we might more fully appreciate the struggles to realize a vision of circulation. In 1585, John Byshop, a Thames waterman, was troubled by unlaw fully erected locks and weirs that were, he claimed, causing deaths on the river. He writes: I have complayned to many men But there is no remedie founde ffor clearinge of that worthy streame but still poore men I see be drowned. His response was to write a 172-line poem, in four-line stanzas of iambic tetrameter verse with a distinctly patchy rhyme-scheme, presented on a single manuscript sheet as a petition to Queen Elizabeth. (Its survival in the Lansdowne Manuscripts of the British Library suggests that it may at least have got close to its intended recipient.)45 It is an ingenuous piece of writing, produced by a man quite possibly unaware of elite poetry on rivers, but very much aware of the practical conditions experienced by Thames watermen. Crucially, he focuses on the functional politics of the river: Alas for woe yt should be soe in sufferinge of such evill thinges good lawes be made them to invade by manie great and worthy kinges Mylles weares and lockes men do them call that doe annoy that worthy streame Againste the lawe they doe stande all but still the drownde those symple men. Though he aligns himself with the "symple," Byshop is not an ignorant man; indeed, he is aware, notably, of the "good lawes," produced by 45· BL MS Lansdowne 44/39. Another document, also preserved in the Lansdowne Manu scripts, indicates that Byshop at least stimulated a degree of debate. The unnamed author of this document does not dispute the deaths, but shifts the blame to the "manyfest negligence" and "evill demeanor" of the watermen, dismissing Byshop's allegations as "outragious" (BL MS Lansdowne 44/40). 1 20o8 English Literary Renaissance Inc.</page><page sequence="14">Andrew McRae 519 "Eleaven kings," designed to prevent the weirs which made life so difficult for watermen. He deploys this knowledge to challenge easy assumptions of connection and mobility. The Thames, far from being a symbol of national greatness, is translated into an index of the tendency for powerful private interests to ignore, and even to endanger, the "symple men" and the tasks they fulfill. Byshop's petition-poem represents a concerted effort to situate those men within the nation. It concludes with a list of twenty colleagues who he claims have been "drowned and slaine on lockes and weares theis Seaven yeres last past . . . betwene Maydenhead and Oxford." This very act of memorialization in an address to the Queen endorses their value to the commonwealth, while their positioning as victims works further to invert the period's predominantly negative images of watermen. Indeed, the poem's logic suggests it is the self-interested and criminally negligent acts of landowners, rather than the legitimate labor of the watermen, that undermines interests of community and placement: One fiarmer hath a lock in store That hath made many a child to weepe Their mothers begg from dore to dore their ffathers drowned in the deepe. The itinerancy of the begging mother here provides an ironic echo of the purposeful travels of the watermen, driven as they are, Byshop sug gests, by a fundamentally domestic desire to provide for a family. Their deaths, rather than their preceding lives, are the cause of displacement. The poem's subsequent image of burial extends the point: Then beinge drowned they bury them there where dogges and swyne then doe them fmde their fleshe they eat and all to teare which is contrarie to mankinde. The sins of the propertied are thereby aligned with a dehumanizing realization of eternal placelessness, which is disturbing in spite of its rhe torical excess. Self-interested manipulation of the river is the true crime, Byshop suggests, not the honest labors of the watermen. Bysshop's naive yet incisive voice prefigures wider developments in the following century, when established lines of complaint about weirs were increasingly translated into arguments for the extension of naviga tion. Τechnically, if the improvement of a non-tidal river required the removal of weirs or other hazards, an act of Parliament was necessary to © 2008 English Literary Renaissance Inc.</page><page sequence="15">520 English Literary Renaissance initiate the work. As a result, lobbying assumed a national character, and schemes were not only debated in Parliament but also amplified in a range of printed tracts. The unfettered flow of water, in even the most minor tributaries of navigable rivers, is commonly figured in such tracts as a national imperative. According to Francis Mathew's 1655 pamphlet, Of the Opening of Rivers for Navigation, "all such Streams, great or small, which would willingly fall into our said Rivers designed for Navigation, ought to be free, and not to be bound up with Wears, Sluces, Pens for Mills, and the like imprestures, which keep up, stop, and divert the Waters from their natural Course" (pp. 5—6). The key term here, "free," breaks down discourses of localized identities. The flow of water through the land thus becomes a metonym for the movement of goods and people across a national space defined—as "Nature has afforded it"—by mobility.46 Crucially, the invocation of nature, directing the movement of water, allowed proponents of river improvement to represent human mobility as orderly and purposeful. Conservative discourse on vagrants typically represents domestic travel as random and profoundly unsettling. In the face of such anxieties, the image of the natural flow of water in estab lished watercourses—fed by the sea, through underground channels, and running back to the sea in a constant cycle—provided a keystone to new endorsements of circulation. Simon Schama has demonstrated the Platonic origins of fluvial myths of circulation: "In the Timaeus Plato had decreed the circle to be the necessarily perfect shape for creation as it alone formed a line of complete containment. The principle held good for the circulation of blood about the human body and for waters about the earth. So the rhythms of fluvial death and rebirth, the transmutability of water, blood, and wine, described a cycle that, provided the proper remembrances were observed, would be self-regulating."47 In England, the orthodox view, presented in Callis' legal tract, was that only naviga ble rivers may properly be compared to "the veins of a mans body."48 But numerous commentators in the middle decades of the seventeenth century were less discriminating; in their view, the act of "making small Rivers navigable" was a means of realizing a natural order inscribed upon the face of the landscape.49 This effort to apply a Platonic principle to a social and economic context was reinforced by Continental writers 46.

Giovanni Botero's Cause of the Greatness of Cities, for instance, translated into English in 163$, argued that "God created Water, not onely as an element necessarie for Natures perfection; but also as an apt and opportune meanes, for transportation of Commodities from one Countrey to another."50 Moreover, within this context the strict Platonic conception of the circulation of a finite quantity of matter within a closed system was significantly revised to accommodate more dynamic and expansive economic theories. By contrast to those who feared the transportation of local produce out of the local marketplace, the more radical proponents of river improvement celebrated a potential multiplication of goods and wealth within an expanded, and distinctly placeless, market. In James Hely's tract on the improvement of the Avon between Salisbury and the south coast, the enumeration of commodities becomes virtually an end in itself. The easy transportation of metals, for instance, prompts a fevered rehearsal of the uses of "vast stores of Iron of all sorts, not only that which is wrought by Smiths, Cutlers, Gunsmiths, Armourers, and others; but all sorts of cast Iron, as Stoves for drying of Mault; and all sorts of Pots, Weights, Balconies, Anvils, Vises, and divers Engines, and many other things too large to particularize."51 Another commentator, R. S., theorized on the interrelated growth of employment and wealth: "Which mutually advancing each other, the employment first begetting wealth, and then that wealth a greater employment, shall establish ... a constant motion, excited by it self, and by it self continued and advanc'd."52 Each of these statements articulates a surprisingly precise vision of the eco nomic functions of circulation. For Hely, iron, so difficult to transport by land, provides the raw material for a revival of industry, which carries the potential to resituate Salisbury and its locality within a national eco nomy. Fie subsequently catalogues consumer items, such as "all sorts of Grocery" and "all sorts of Fish"; however, his attention is seized more compellingly by industry and trade, which can "raise" men "to greater Estates."53 For R. S., more explicitly still, the circulation of goods facili tated by improved transport networks underpins a startlingly abstract $o. The Cause of the True Greatenesse of Cities, trans.

In Michel Foucault's analysis of economic discourse in this period, the relation between money and wealth, traditionally held to be dependent upon the preciousness of the metal or the seal of the monarch, was gradually reassessed, by merchants who appreciated the material production of surplus value through exchange. "When goods can circulate (and this thanks to money)," Foucault writes, "they multi ply, and wealth increases; when coinage becomes more plentiful, as a result of a good circulation and a favorable balance, one can attract fresh merchandise and increase both agriculture and manufacturing."55 Com mentators on rivers lend this theory a spatial form, in the process trans lating the analogy of the rivers and veins into a freshly dynamic model of nationhood. Fluvial networks become valued less for their orderly distri bution of natural resources than for their capacity to facilitate economic growth, while space itself becomes valued less for its specific places and its capacity to be transformed into property than for its capacity to facil itate circulation. To borrow a term from modem economic theory, the nation's space is valued for its liquidity. Marrying the abstract vision with practical reality, however, was another matter. In this respect a key figure, the heir ofByshop but also, as he pre ferred to claim, of Thomas Nashe, was John Taylor, the Water Poet. 56 Taylor was a Thames waterman, an occasional employee of state-sponsored river surveys, a proponent of the improvement of rivers, and a prolific poet. His most sustained excursion on the theme of river transportation is contained in Taylor on Thame-Isis, a pamphlet he published in 1632 after his involvement in a project to improve navigation on the Thames.57 The title evokes the sixteenth-century tradition of poems devoted to the Thames; however, in a prefatory poem addressed "To any Body," Tay lor seems uncharacteristically hesitant about his own position: 54- On the shift in this period toward an understanding of marketing as a process, rather than an activity bound to particular places, see Agnew, Worlds Apart, p. 41. 55.

A5V). And this approach, with its un ashamed emphasis on labor, prompts a reassessment of the river's textual function. Notably, while chorographers tend to glide along the nation's rivers, with all the ease of a finger moving across the face of a map, Taylor privileges the practical and piecemeal spatial knowledge of the traveller. Here, his gaze rests firmly on the troublesome river itself. Again conflat ing his respective labors with oar and pen, he promises that, "I (from Oxford) downe to Stanes will slide, / And tell the rivers wrongs which I espide" (sig. B2). This vision underpins a reconfiguration of the anthropomorphism commonly employed by earher river poets. At one point, nearing the con fluence of Thame and Isis, Taylor describes a distinctly troubled river: Poore Tame all heavie and disconsolate, Unnavigable, scorn'd, despis'd, disgrac'd Having in vaine so many paces pac'd; Despairing and quite desperate with these harmes, He hurles himselfe unwares in Isis armes, (sig. A7—Αγν) The river is "desperate" because of "harmes" inflicted upon it, which prevent it from fulfilling its function within an economy of circulation. As so often in Taylor's work, his attention is drawn to blockages. He asks: 58. Speed's Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine was published in 1611. Camden's Britannia was published in six Latin editions between 1586 and 1607, and an English translation in 1610.

(sig. B6v) In almost every instance, he suggests, a blockage may be attributed to human failings, ranging from mere laziness to the sin of covetousness. Taylor impugns "private persons" who "for their gainfull use, / Ingrosse the water and the land abuse" (sig. Biv). By contrast, his ideal is of a river maintained "For use and profit in community," not spoiled by private interests but rather "cleane and free" (sigs. Biv, B6v). Moreover, in another departure from Elizabethan poets, Taylor defines freedom by reference specifically to the movement of people and goods. For rivers, in Taylor's view, are more than lines of connection on maps. Indeed, however easy its flow and however seductive a path it may appear to trace, within this perspective a river is of no consequence until it becomes a channel of human traffic. In other works, Taylor applies this vision more broadly across the nation. Taylor's signature text, especially in the latter half of his long career, was the travel pamphlet, narrating challenging or simply idiosyn cratic journeys.59 Yet when describing his travels on rivers, personalized itinerary repeatedly gives way to reformist polemic. He travelled, for instance, to Salisbury, and wrote in an effort to urge the city governors to clear blockages on the Avon. His voyage thus assumed the form of a "simple Survey," exposing the apparent "hinderances unto so good and beneficiall a worke."60 And, in a remarkable journey late in his life, he travelled up the Thames and Isis as far as Cirencester, then carried his boat on a wagon to Stroud, at the outer reaches of the Severn river sys tem. The journey thus rehearsed the path of an imagined cutting—in modern terms, a canal—by means of which the Thames and Severn (and ultimately also the Wye and other more westerly river systems) could effectively be joined. The potential connections, from the English capital into south Wales, suggest dizzying images of circulation; "goods," he writes, might in future "be conveyed by water too &amp; from London, in Rivers at cheape rates without danger, almost to half the countyes in England and Wales."61 For the slightest moment, in fact, Taylor neglects 59· See Andrew McRae, "The Literature of Domestic Travel in Early Modern England: The Journeys of John Taylor," Studies in Travel Writing 12 (2008), 85—100. 60.

It is a fantasy, quite simply, of human industry bending intransigent natural waterways into a more compliant shape, and thereby realizing water's principle of circulation. Canals were not unknown in early modern England. Mill-leets and irrigation channels were common enough, while the sixteenth-century Exeter Ship Canal (one of the earliest of its kind) employed a similar principle on a greater scale, enabling river traffic to bypass a troublesome stretch of the River Exe. But these were relatively minor achievements, all geared toward the improvement of existing rivers for particular purposes, rather than the creation of entirely new routes. The fantasy of connection, by comparison, was compelling. As Taylor's image suggests, the canal offered a technique for seizing on the principle of fluvial circu lation, and improving it through human ingenuity. Later in the seven teenth century, Francis Mathew extended the vision, proposing not only a link between Bristol and London, but also a connection between the western and eastern extremities of England.62 Indeed, reformers might now imagine the opening of almost limitless lines of connection across the land. As Henry Robinson mused in 1652: "where there are no Rivers neer unto the Towns already built, nor possibility of cutting Navigable Ditches; it will be necessary to see where such Navigable Rivers or Ditches may be made, and accordingly have them cut with all conven ient expedition."63 Water, according to this spatial logic, was not merely circulating according to natural laws, but might be manipulated to serve the requirements of civilization. In political terms, the act of imagining spatial connections, particularly in the middle decades of the seventeenth century, inevitably prompted reflection on the foundations of economic and political power in the nation. If in Holland the canal signified civic industry, in France it was posited as "the perfect expression of absolutist control over the waters."64 In England, therefore, the stakes were high. Taylor, for all the outspoken royalism of his Civil War pamphleteering, assumes the voice of an informed 62. A Meditenanean Passage by Water, from London to Bristol (1670), pp. 7-9.

Mathew asks: "Now who should be the Undertaker of this great work but the State it self? It being too great an expence for any private man or Corporation to lay out; and of too great a Profit for them to receive, being effected."66 Hely not only stresses the importance of "the keeping out of Sharers" (p. 22), but also proposes that the state should assert a proprietary right over running water, in a manner that will insure sufficient supplies for navigation. Those diverting valuable water from navigable rivers for the purpose of irrigation, he suggests, should be forced to "rent the Water . . . yearly, at ten or twenty Shillings the Acre more or less" (p. 16). Given the benefit of hindsight, such schemes may seem naive and impractical. The massive expansion of canals in the eighteenth century proceeded on capitalist principles, facilitating the traffic of merchandise but at the cost of effectively privatizing water and transportation. There fore, those who made an imaginative, and not entirely illogical, leap from the circulation of water in rivers to the potentially unfettered cir culation of subjects and their merchandise effectively lost the debate. The "begetting" of "wealth," envisaged by seventeenth-century com mentators, involved as many exclusions as inclusions; common rights on water would be expanded little more than common rights over land. A regime of "freedom" was thus translated into the freedom to compete. The arguments and perceptions of such writers, however, represent ear nest and informed efforts, at a critical moment in the development of inland transportation, to reimagine existing relations between the citizen and national space. Working in a period before the mature development of capitalism, they pursue the spatial logic of circulation to what seem, to them, to be entirely reasonable conclusions. This essay has been an exercise in an interdisciplinary form of cultural history, rather than a study within the more conventional parameters of 65. John Taylors last Voyage, sig. B5V. 66. Mathew, Of the Opening of Rivers, pp. 10—11. 1 20o8 English Literary Renaissance Inc.</page><page sequence="22">Andrew McRae 527 literary history. Indeed one underlying goal has been to rethink the rather tired and canon-bound category of "the Renaissance river poem," turning attention away from canonical figures such as Spenser and Drayton toward those engaged more immediately in the business of river travel, such as Byshop and Taylor. Yet the two strains, or traditions, are by no means distinct. Just as Taylor was aware of existing, elite textual traditions, so were contemporary topographical poets aware of ongoing debates about rivers and mobility. Moreover, against the appar ent narrative of cultural and ideological development sketched above, their work valuably clarifies the ongoing struggles and uncertainties that characterized the cultural production of early modern space. While an extensive survey of poetry written in this context would be impractical, isolating images of rivers and travel in two of the most influential pieces written in the seventeenth century, divided by roughly forty years, Jonson's "To Penshurst" and Denham's Cooper's Hill, reveals resonant strategies of both reaction and accommodation, which in the process refashion the poetry of place and nation. In particular, I want to argue that the latter, with its greater engagement with discourses of economic improvement, uneasily combined with a strict social conservatism, provides an apt and unsurprisingly popular model for subsequent generations. The country house poem is generally perceived as the archetypal early seventeenth-century literary statement of the values of placement. This minor genre coalesced with early Stuart social policy which stressed the importance of the gentry and nobility fulfilling their traditional roles in the country.67 Its central images of festivity and hospitality, in particular, epitomized a vision of stable and hierarchical community, and posited this as the bedrock of socio-political order in the nation as a whole. Recent historicizing analyses of these poems, however, have valuably situated them within a contested politics of space. Rather than being assured statements of unassailable orthodoxy, they have been exposed as rather more fraught, all too aware of emergent challenges to the values they espouse. Significantly, such approaches have attended to matters ranging from the broad shifts toward capitalism and bourgeois domesticity 6j. See esp. Leah Marcus, The Politics of Mirth: Jonson, Herrick, Milton, Marvell, and the Defense of Old Holiday Pastimes (Chicago and London, 1986); Felicity Heal, Hospitality in Early Modern England (Oxford, 1990), pp. 108-14. 1 2008 English Literary Renaissance Inc.</page><page sequence="23">528 English Literary Renaissance to more local yet equally pressing struggles.68 At the latter end of the spectrum, for example, Martin Elsky's study of the micro-politics of river transport on the River Lea has exposed crucial tensions in Jonson's "To Sir Robert Wroth." Elsky reads the poem in the context of "the Wroths' changing relationship to the transportation system," and hence to ideas of how local communities connect with the commonwealth.69 "To Sir Robert Wroth" becomes, as a result, a less confident, yet consider ably more compelling, celebration of the uncertain, shifting values of property. Here, though somewhat more suggestively, I want to suggest that "To Penshurst" may similarly be exposed to such contextual analysis, focusing also on rivers and property relations. This poem, however, more influential in its day than "To Sir Robert Wroth," seems altogether more determined in its conservative, even reactionary, spatial politics. Sir Robert Sidney's Penshurst estate on the River Medway in Kent, like Wroth's on the Lea, was at the center of debates about the limits of river navigation. A series of Elizabethan and early Stuart investigations into the Medway repeatedly questioned the extent to which it might be considered navigable, and on at least one occasion a Commission of Sewers stressed the benefit of opening the river as far as Penshurst. This would be in the interests of the king's navy, and "also for the general . . . good of his subjects ... by the traffic by boats."70 The estate is thus imaginatively situated within networks of trade and communications, one unit within a dynamic and expansive commonwealth. By contrast, as though in reaction to such a vision, Jonson's poem determinedly rep resents an insular and self-contained rural space.71 Indeed the poem's only mention of the Medway is as an unreliable supplier of food, by comparison with Penshurst's ponds: "And if the high-swoll'n Medway 68.

Here the element of water, which the opening lines of the poem endorse, along with soil, air and wood, as one of the estate's "better marks," is figured as contained and static. Ponds turn water into pro perty, and fish into the tangible realization of that relationship. In line with the poem's strategy of willfully confusing natural processes and eco nomic relationships, the fish "leap" forward to "pay" their "tribute," as though the water itself owes the lord its right to exist. Those fish, in turn, are brought to the lord's table for distribution in the poem's definitive act of hospitality. Accordingly, the poem's considerable dynamism is also carefully con strained, as people and local produce alike converge on the great house. Famously, "all come in, the farmer and the clown, / And no one empty handed, to salute / Thy lord, and lady" (11.48-50). Ponds bring fish; farmers bring capons; young women bring "An emblem of themselves, in plum, or pear" (1.56). The centripetal movement is critical, suggesting clear social and economic horizons to the lives of those bound to the estate. Even local patterns of marketing are magically erased by the eco nomy of gift-giving, self-sufficiency, and hospitality. The only exceptions to this model, also drawn toward the estate but from outside its bound aries, are the uniquely licensed figures of poet and king, and in each case their routes of travel are either obscured or mystified. Jonson is simply there, absorbed into the fabric of the estate through the conjoined mys teries of poetry and patronage. James, meanwhile, the poem's only real traveller, is described as happening upon the house by chance, "when hunting late, this way, / With his brave son" (11.76-77). This is a deft Jonsonian touch. On the one hand, James's own unfettered travel signi fies his proprietorial status in relation to the nation. His movement performs in part the functions of an Elizabethan progress, although the decisively haphazard nature of his itinerary encodes this monarch's preference for informality and social exclusion. He hunts with his son, evading the gaze of the populace. On the other hand, and equally importantly, the lack of any evident pathway or road preserves the poem's controlling image of insulation. Penshurst is bound to a wider political unit, but without admitting connections which might disturb the poem's fantasy of com munity and placement.

In the course of the poem the flow of water accrues multiple levels of significance, relating vari ously, and interconnectedly, to poetry, economics and politics. As numerous critics have commented, the poem articulates a doctrine of concordia discors, which held that hamiony may be derived out of conflict between opposing forces.74 Here I want to suggest, more specifically, that attending to the functions of rivers in Cooper's Hill may help to elu cidate some of the uncertain political and spatial implications of concordia discors in Denham's poem. For all its essential conservatism, its attention to the Thames admits qualities of dynamism, aligned with contemporary economic discourse on river improvement, which crucially remold the models of national identity apparent in previous poetry of place. More than any earlier topographical poem, Cooper's Hill is concerned with the engagement between the poet and the scene before him. The speaker is at once specifically located and capable of transcending this location: "Through untraced ways, and aery paths I fly," he claims, "More boundless in my Fancy than my eye" (ll.n-12). Yet the "wander ing" nature of eye and fancy alike is tempered by the poem's concentration on the Thames: My eye descending from the Hill, surveys Where Thames amongst the wanton vallies strays. Thames, the most lovd of all the Oceans sons, By his old Sire to his embraces runs, Hasting to pay his tribute to the Sea, Like mortal life to meet Eternity. (11.159-64) 72.

Geographically and economically, it was the nation's most prominent river. Politically, its status was amenably hazy: its high tidal flow marked it as freely available to the people, while the placement of key royal residences on its banks signalled the proprietorial gaze of the monarch. It stood, one might say, as a ready, yet malleable, symbol of the English constitution. In Cooper's Hill, attention to the Thames, at the center of the poem, indicates a desire to identify principles of order and direction in the national land scape. Hence the early representation of the river "stray [ing]" "amongst the wanton vallies," gives way to a purposeful progression downstream, which Denham inflects politically as well as morally. Rivers move to seas; lives move to eternity; tributes are paid to superior forces. As this passage continues, it develops a definitive georgic strain, attend ing in turn to agricultural and mercantile rewards: No unexpected inundations spoil The mower's hopes, nor mock the ploughman's toil: But God-like his unwearied Bounty flows; First loves to do, then loves the Good he does. Nor are his Blessings to his banks confined, But free, and common, as the Sea or Wind; When he to boast, or to disperse his stores Full of the tributes of his grateful shores, Visits the world, and in his flying towers Brings home to us, and makes both Indies ours; Finds wealth where 'tis, bestows it where it wants; Cities in deserts, woods in Cities plants. So that to us no thing, no place is strange, While his fair bosom is the worlds exchange. (11.175—88) The slide from agriculture to international trade is a pivotal, though not entirely unproblematic, moment in the poem. By envisaging the Thames as the "God-like" agent, at once fertilizing the land for agriculture and venturing out to claim "both Indies" for England, Denham endorses the dynamism of economic exchange. Trade—or, to be more specific here, the associated neocolonial flows of power outward and goods inward—is encoded as another natural function of the land. The socio spatial foundations of this prosperity are at once suggestive and opaque.

Moreover, in a further point of contrast to the country house poem, the poet's position on Cooper's Hill is figured as merely occasional, like that of a casual tourist, while the focus on a mower and ploughman identifies types of laborers who were at this time typically itinerant specialists, with no bond to a given piece of land other than that of a daily wage.75 Connections between subjects and spaces are thus loosened, as the poem gestures, though without explicit comment, toward the dis placements and alienations of nascent agrarian capitalism. Y et through out it is the anthropomorphized river, rather than human subjects, that assumes the principal burden of economic agency, its circulation distrib uting "his blessings" and "his stores." Indeed, following the poem's syntax, it is even the river's "flying towers" which enact the miracle of international trade, just as it is the river's "bosom" that offers itself as "the worlds exchange." This pattern is clarified in Denham's metaphorical invocations of rivers. Early in the poem, the idea of the water cycle provides a metaphor for the financial ebbs and flows that characterize the lives of people working in the city: Where, with like hast, though several ways, they run Some to undo, and some to be undone; While luxury, and wealth, like war and peace, Are each the other's ruine, and increase; As rivers lost in Seas some secret vein Thence reconveys, there to be lost again. (11.31-36) Whereas the circulation of water, for many contemporary commen tators, signified fundamentally positive forces of change, Denham instead couches the image in traditional economic morality. The water cycle is here figured in terms of dissipation and loss, which underpin the poem's attack on the pursuit of "luxury" and "wealth." The crux, for Denham as for contemporary commentators on river improvement, is the relation between national advancement and economic competition between individual subjects. Crucially, Cooper's Hill, for all its endorsement of 75- On early modern representations of these two figures, the mower and the ploughman, see respectively: Rosemary Kegl, "'Joyning my Labour to my Pain': The Politics of Labor in Marvell's Mower Poems," in Soliciting Interpretation: Literary Theory and Seventeenth-Century Eng lish Poetry, ed.

The poem represents corporate prosperity as a natural product of the land, but eventual "ruine" as the inevitable result of any pursuit of individual interests, whether economic or political. And it invokes rivers to support each side of the argument. The climactic image of fluvial circulation assumes the form of political metaphor. The actions of political insurgents, "forcing Kings to give / More than was fit for Subjects to receive" (11. 345-46), is likened to the efforts of husbandmen to control the flow of a swollen river. The river "can endure" the "high-raisd banks" erected to prevent flooding of crops: But if with Bays and Dams they strive to force His channel to a new, or narrow course; No longer then within his banks he dwells, First to a Torrent, then a Deluge swells: Stronger, and fiercer by restraint he roars, And knows no bound, but makes his power his shores. (11. 353—58) In its earlier version, of 1642, the final lines clinch a point about the rela tion between the respective powers of princes and people: Therefore their boundlesse power let Princes draw Within the Channell, and the shores of Law, And may that Law, which teaches Kings to sway Their Scepters, teach their Subjects to obey. (A Text; 11.3 51— 54) In both versions, the image naturalizes and reifies England's monarchical constitution, echoing the earlier endorsements of orderly and linear flows. In the later version, albeit more subtly, the poem's overt argument for the primacy of the royal prerogative also works implicitly to inscribe royal authority on the land. The river is monarchical authority: and such essentially natural forces, Denham suggests, will violently resist efforts to prevent or redirect their courses. VII It is a curious fact, in a poem so thoroughly engaged with processes of social and political interaction, that Denham's metaphor should echo contemporary proponents of river improvement. Like the arguments raised by such writers, the underlying vision of nationhood in Cooper's Hill is founded on principles of circulation. The ideological game Denham © 2008 English Literary Renaissance Inc.</page><page sequence="29">534 English Literary Renaissance plays, however, with considerable if not complete success, is to sub ordinate these principles to the interests of conservative social and polit ical values. Indeed, while Denham doubtless appreciated that the Jacobean, and Jonsonian, myth of placement had been translated by the 1640s into the stuff of nostalgic fantasy, his poem nonetheless seeks to contain the more radical connotations of contemporary discourse on the circulation of water. Whereas for a writer such as John Taylor the river came to signify endless potential for change, epitomized in the recurrent image of the author industriously navigating his nation, for Denham it signifies ultimately the implacable and mystified forces opposed to change. It is hardly surprising that Denham's poem should have been so influential on eighteenth-century poetry of place and landscape: poetry which refashioned préexistent ideas of tradition and place, as it embraced colonialism, endorsed the extraordinary fortunes being embedded in the landscape by men successful in the marketplace, and made little effort to mystify bonds between landlords and their tenants and laborers. It was a model amenable to an age of Parliamentary enclosure, landscape garden ing, and the canal. The discourse of circulation is thus characterized, throughout the early modern period, by struggle. The proponents of river improvement argu ing for economic and individual "freedom" represented one extreme; however, their claims, as we have seen, were always somewhat problem atic, particularly on the matter of competition. A regime of fluidity is inevitably also a regime of winners and losers. Denham's text, for all its compelling assertion of wealth and progress, is marked by a similar ten sion. Its glimpses of acquisitve merchants, and also of the uncertainly placed agricultural laborers, whose various efforts underpin England's economic success, frustrate the project to mystify that success. Through out all these texts, however, the river provides a vehicle for assessing and contesting the relations between subjects and spaces, and for situating mobility within emergent models of nationhood.
