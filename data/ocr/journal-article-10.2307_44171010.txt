In this, the most ambitious study to date on the subject, Grabar treated two types of manuscripts : those whose Italian parentage is ascertained by colophon (2) ; and, those he attributed on I would like to thank Robert Thomson, Director of the Center for Byzantine Studies, Dumbarton Oaks, for granting me permission to use those facilities during the summer of 1985 ; Michael McCormick, for our dialogues on the palaeography of Arundel 547 ; and Jeffrey Anderson of George Washington University to whom I owe a special debt of gratitude for our numerous discussions on the London Lectionary, fór his comments on an earlier draft of this paper, and especially for his kind and enthusiastic support of the project.

To be sure, some of Grabar' s attributions are supportable. For example, although it lacks a colophon, Vatican . gr. 866 (5) is dis- tinctively Italo-byzantine in decoration, featuring biting beasts and interlace inherited from Merovingian and Celtic illumination, stylized anthropomorphic and zoomorphic initials ; and, of course, the unique variant of the perlschrift (6) practiced in the region (7).

Also doubtable is an Italo-byzantine origin for the three manuscripts that appear as no. 52 in his catalogue.

MADIGAN Grabar's alleged Italo-byzantine manuscripts are more puzzling in appearance because their ornament is ecclectic, reflecting simulta- neously styles practiced in the provinces and contemporary trends popular in the capital. Consider, for example, one entry in Grabar's catalogue, British Museum Library Arundel. 547 (8), a lectionary whose decoration features some stylized initials comparable to those in works of proposed provincial manufacture, floral ornament found in the finest Constantinopolitan works of the day (figs. 1-2), and Evangelist portraits in a naturalistic style extra-ordinarily similar to those found in the capital (figs. 3-6). In the past, tenth and eleventh- century manuscripts with programs of decoration interspersed with similar incongruities have been assigned to workshops in the provinces of the Byzantine Empire, specifically Italy or Asia Minor. Using Arundel. SAI as a case in point, this study questions the validity of regarding the eccentric elements of decoration in otherwise metropoli- tan manuscripts as symptomatic of provincial manufacture. Although it has been cited on several occasions, the Arundel lectionary has never been the subject of serious study nor has its program of decoration been fully described. Its contents, which begin with lessons from John on Easter and end with the indiction on September 1 of the menologion, are fully in keeping with Constanti- nopolitan usage. It is a large manuscript prepared with the finest materials of the day : the parchment is white, creamy and smooth ; the text, initials, and the backgrounds of its headpieces and miniatures, are manuscrits italo-grecs", in Congresso storico calabrese, IV, Cosenza, 1968, Naples, 1969, 53-69 ; three studies by E.

Its program of decoration consists of headpieces, initials and Evangelist portraits. The beginnings of the lessons are introduced by large rectangular and quatrefoil-shaped headpieces (folios 1, 3, 56, 64, 105, 142, 293, 334) surrounding vibrant blue and green irises detailed by delicate thread-like white lines. The initials, which seem to have attracted more attention than any other aspect of the manuscript, are outlined in gold, and composed of the same delicate flowers and vines found in the headpieces (fig. 2, folio 238) ; stacked geometric forms ; stylized human limbs (flg. 1 ) ; and animals, especially birds. Four unpublished full-page portraits of the Evangelists, inserted in a method not uncommon in Byzantine illumination, appear on folios lv, 63v, 94v and 131 (9). Save for the first Evangelist portrait, which is a product of a later period, the manuscript's three original miniatures, and all the ornament in the manuscript is executed in the same palette, an impressive range of colors based on rose, cornflower blue and forest green to which the artist has added medium to dilute their intensities or black or white to achieve rose, light rose, pink, dark rose, violet, forest green, lime, sea green, aqua, blue, light blue, blue green, navy, brown, fawn, sienna, and dark brown ; colors in the ochre and yellow families are not represented. To explain the decoration of the Arundel lectionary, Grabar sum- moned Paris, gr. 277 and Patmos 70, two books he regarded as Italo-byzantine (10). The Patmos and Paris lectionaries, which contain no internal evidence in support of an origin, were written in the late tenth century by the same individual, a talented scribe whose work is characterized by pen drawings colored by washes in a limited palette. His ornament features headpieces composed of schematized palmet- tes ; voluptuous, rambling vines issuing buds and berries ; laubsägestil (9) On the subject of inserted miniatures in Byzantium, see the comments of H.

MADIGAN patterns (ll) ; stylized birds, fish, and spotted snakes ; and expressive hands with long, curling fingers. The same style with some variations, appears in another lectionary with Constantinopolitan lessons, Paris, gr. 279 (12). Grabar's comparison of these manuscripts to Arundel. 547 is at once confusing for the former is strikingly different from the latter. Although all three manuscripts contain stylized birds and hands, in the Arundel lectionary, these motifs are often combined with naturalistic floral elements absent in the Paris and Patmos lectionaries. While all three manuscripts have headpieces decorated by flowers and vines, the irises in Arundel. 547 contrast with the abstracted palmettes of the Paris and Patmos books. In contrast to the Paris and Patmos lectionaries, which are adorned with ornament drawn in the same ink used to execute the text colored by polychrome washes, the initials in the Arundel lectionary are drawn in gold and painted by layers of colors in an extensive palette. Finally, neither Paris, gr. 277 nor Patmos 70 contain fiill-page portraits. While Arundel. 5 Al has been compared to Byzantine manuscripts of proposed Italian origin, it has never been judged against the numerous tenth- and eleventh-century manuscripts whose colophons attest to their Italo-byzantine provenance. One might begin with certain aspects of manufacture. Italo-byzantine manuscripts of the tenth and eleventh centuries often share a number of codicological features (13). They are usually small, produced of mediocre parchment, pricked on the internal margins, composed of mixed groups of gatherings (i.e. trinia, quinia, binia, etc.) and ruled according to (11) Weitzmann, ibid., 18 ff.

In contrast, the Arundel lectionary is large ; composed of thin, whitish, finely prepared parchment ; is pricked on the outer margins ; and, like most Byzantine manuscripts, is gathered into quaternia and ruled according to Leroy's system 1 (15). No parallels emerge when the uncial script styles of Arundel. 547 are compared to the calligraphy styles found in tenth-century lection- aries made in Italy, largely because Italo-byzantine scribes favored the minuscule over the uncial (16). In type and style, Arundel. 547's uncials are Constantinopolitan. The first, a variant of ogivale diritta called "slavonie uncial", can be dated to the late tenth and early eleventh centuries (fig. 1). The style features letters that are the same height and width with rho, gamma, theta and occasionally mu extenders ; com- pressed letters for epsilon, omega, omicron, rho and theta and an absence of enlarged letter forms (17). Practiced as early as 980 (18) the style is survived by dated illuminated luxury commissions such as Harley 5598 of 995/96 (19) (fig. 10) as well as manuscripts of lesser quality, such as Carakallou 1 1 (20). The Arundel scribe's particular variant of this calligraphy style deviates slightly from the canon in its more relaxed spacing of letters on a line and use of rounded rather than compressed letters for some examples of zeta, epsilon, omicron, (14) J. Leroy, "La description codicologiques des manuscrits grecs de parche- min", in La paléographie grecque , 27-44.

This idiosyncracy, found also in Lavra 86 (22), is a fascinating by-product of workshop practice where scribes trained in different styles often assimilated the characteristics of eachother's work. A second calligraphy style in Arundel 547 is another Constantinopolitan uncial form : decorative, highly burnished gold capitals enhanced by curls, dots and dashes employed for the titles of sections. These gold "thorn and curl" capitals are a hallmark of Epigraphische Auszeichnungsmajuskel (23), and are found in a number of ornate Constantinopolitan manuscripts of the second half of the tenth century such as Berlin , Phillips , 1598 (24), the "Paris Psalter" and its group (25), Mont Sinai gr. 204 (26), the Menologion (21) On rounded liturgical uncials of this period, see Cavallo, "La maiuscola", 108 ff. ; examples in W.

The headpiece programs are dominated by guilloche, interlace, geometric patterns and stylized flowers, such as the palmette. For the initials, Italo-byzantine artists favored delightful biting beasts and animals (predominantly birds) and what has been called "anthropo- morphic elements" : unmodelled, staring faces with pointed, bearded chins, cheeks with dots ; and, often letters formed of limbs. This tradition is represented by Vat gr. 2138, a lectionary illuminated in Capua, in 991 (fig. 7) (31), and by the works ofNeilos of Rossano and the band of monks he trained during their trek from Capua to Grottaferrata (32).

As was noted above, the Arundel manuscript contains a few letters that have elements comparable to designs found in Western manuscripts. Grabar has shown that the anthropomorphic aspects of some of the lectionary's letters, specifically those where initials are created of irises and legs or arms, have parallels in eleventh-century Western manuscripts, such as Milan, Ambrosiana Library B 159 sup. (33) and in works of proposed Italian manufacture, specifically Paris, gr. 277 (34). Grabar claims these designs for Italy regarding their elements as Western in influence. They have been claimed also for Cappadocia by Weitzmann (35). This "style", and it is debatable if one may call it that, is not "province-specific". It appears in a number of manuscripts from all over the Byzantine world and is probably the consequence of scribal design rather than direct influence of Western or Cappadocian illumination on Byzantine art. Scribes, who appear to have been responsible for a great deal of the ornament in Byzantine illumination, practiced often personal styles which normally do not conform to those we regard as the major trends of tenth and eleventh-century Constantinople, such as the Blütenblatt- stil (36). Their forms are simple, highly original, unpretentious and for the most part, abstract. Some of the letters in the Arundel lectionary have elements that represent this mode of illustration. To this the artist has added the more fashionable floral elements that are a hallmark of Constantinopolitan illumination in this period. These floral elements, which may be more a consequence of the painter or illuminator's designs than that of the scribe, remove the initials in the Arundel manuscript from any consideration of Italo-byzantine art in the tenth British Museum Library Add. 18231 of 972, Rome, Biblioteca Vallicelliana, D. 43 of 965 (by Paul who also executed Grottaferrata B. a. 1).

Arundel. 547 fares no better when compared to eleventh-century Greek manuscripts of known Italian origin. For the most part, the decoration of the latter represents a continuation of trends established in the tenth century augmented by influences from other Western styles of illumination, especially the Beneventan school (38). Compare, for example, the ornament in Ambrosiana B 56 sup., made by a Calabrese scribe-artist in 1022 (fig. 8) (39). In spite of the fact that it is written in Greek, the decoration of the manuscript is wholly western in character. The designs are simple, dominated by interlace, geometric patterns and biting beasts painted in bright red, yellow and blue. When human or zoomorphic images do appear in Italo-byzantine manus- cripts like this one they are abstracted, segmented into flat, colored bands or left unpainted as in Florence, Laurentian Library Plut. XI.9, made in Apiro in 1021 (40) or Montecassino 431 of 1011-35 (41). There is evidence that toward the end of the eleventh century and into the early twelfth, Greek artists working in Italy did begin to emulate the illuminated manuscripts produced in Constantinople (42).

A deluxe work, the Borgiana manuscript is composed of several individually and, one might say, inexpertly dyed sheets of parchment ranging in color from blue to a rich blue violet. The initials are a curious mixture of the interlace designs and biting beast motifs common in Beneventan illumination (44), combined with the graceful curled stalks and buds of Constantinopolitan floral ornament. To these, the artist has added something of his own : the initials, which are drawn in a poor mixture of gold, are "colored" by bright red, yellow, blue and green dots arranged in patterns (45). The Borgiana liturgical roll exemplifies the manner in which Italo-byzantine artists assimilated into an established decorative tradition artistic information from their eleventh-century Byzantine models. Arundel. 547 has little in common with this tentative, clearly experimental phase in the development of Italo-byzantine illumination nor can the lectionary be compared to the tenth-century manuscripts that precede it. The artisans of the Arundel lectionary used gold extensively in its production in contrast to the Italo-byzantine works which rarely feature this material in high quality or in significant amounts (46). The use of the polychrome opaque wash in limited colors, so characteristic of provincial and especially Italian decoration is absent in Arundel. 547, whose artists apply paint in thin layers (43) G.

The presence of Greek monks in a latin monastery in Southern Italy of this period is perhaps not so unusual. The life of St. Neilos tells us that Montecassino was one of the monasteries that offered his Basilian monks refuge {supra, note 32). (44) See, for example, Naples, Biblioteca Nazionale, cod.

MADIGAN building toward a wide range of colors (47). The naturalistic floral elements in the Arundel manuscript contrast boldly with the distinc- tive programs of guilloche, interlace, stylized flowers and anthropo- morphic and zoomorphic decoration that is a hallmark of Italo- byzantine illumination of the tenth and eleventh centuries. And, finally, no Byzantine manuscript nor example of monumental painting made in Italy during this period contains such a naturalistic figure style (48). While the evidence in favor of an Italian origin for Arundel. 547 is weak, very close parallels exist for its decoration and fall-page miniatures in Constantinopolitan manuscripts. We begin with the style of its headpieces and initials, the naturalistic floral style composed of irsises and vines and called Blütenblattstil (figs. 1-2) (49). There is perhaps no ornament more representative of Byzantine illumination of late tenth- and eleventh-century Constantinople than this style which features circumscribed irises alternating with broad curling leaves that expand laterally to fill the spaces created by the medallions. The resulting floral patterns are usually hemmed by dainty "stepped" borders recalling the ancient Lesbian cyma reversa molding or by fretwork reminiscent of the meander. The style decorates courtly commissions such as the Psalter of Basil II (50), Mont Athos, Diony- siou 70 (51), Turin, National Library, cod. B. 1. 2 (52), and in the (47) David Winfield, "Middle and Late Byzantine Wall Painting Methods. A Comparative Study", in Dumbarton Oaks Papers, 22 (1968), 61-140. Winfield suggests, and I think rightfully so, that some of the methods of layering and blending paint he has observed in mural painting may also apply to manuscript illumination of the same periods. (48) Examples of Greek monumental painting in tenth-century Italy include two churches in Carpignano near Otranto, one commissioned by the Greek priest Leon and his family and executed by the Byzantine painter Theophylact, and the other painted in the eleventh century by the Greek artist Eustathios ca. 1020, which, as Belting points out, compares well to Hosios Lukas.

It is not commonly practiced by Italo-byzantine artisans of this period (56). The signature or canonical aspects of Blütenblattstil appear in the headpieces, initials, and the frames of the Evangelist portraits in Arundel. 547. The headpieces, of which no two are alike, are elegant and intricately detailed. On folio 1, the most elaborate of the series, a quatrefoil, framed by a large rectangle is hemmed by bands of pink and blue palmettes and a meander pattern in rose and blue, creating an irregularly shaped gold field which the artist fills with elegant, spiraling blue irises, their curled-down edges and rose centers out- lined by delicate white lines. The other headpieces in the Arundel manuscript are simpler in their overall design but equally as sophistica- ted in their arrangement and execution. On folios 64 and 95, the circumscribed irises compress fleshy green leaves while on folio 132 they alternate with rhomboids produced by the twisting vines. The Blütenblattstil initials of Arundel. 547, including the more unusual ones, repeat the designs of those found in the headpieces and are painted in the same palette. Even the frames of three of the Evangelist portraits, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, feature the characteristic buds formed by delicate white lines alternating with double dashes seen in the frames and headpieces of numerous works in this style, such as Athens, National Library 2364 of the eleventh century (").

MADIGAN variants of the flowery stacks found in the style, are more closely related to types found in Constantinopolitan manuscripts dated and datable to the last years of the tenth century and early eleventh century. Similar enlarged letters appear in Harley 5598 of 995 (fig. 10) and Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale gr. 519, dated to 1019, both made for well-to-do patrons in the capital (58). In addition to the more general comparisons gleaned from the numerous examples of Blütenblattstil, more specific parallels for the floral style in the headpieces and some initials of Arundel. 547 emerge in two groups of manuscripts from the late tenth and early eleventh centuries. The first is led by Harley 5598, and includes manuscripts written in "slavonie uncial" and decorated by headpieces and initials in Blütenblattstil (fig. 10). This group includes Lavra 102 (59), a particularly close comparison to the Arundel lectionary ; Lavra 92, whose full-page miniature is in a style related to manuscripts of the late tenth and early eleventh centuries (60) ; and, Oxford, Bodleian Library, Canon gr. 85 (61). Like the Arundel lectionary, these manuscripts contain headpieces composed of cool irises with red beards arranged in intricate patterns against gold backgrounds. The initials are often large than canonical Blütenblattstil, sometimes angular, and spinier. Related to this group are five manuscripts written in "slavonie uncial" and decorated with "post and lintel" shaped pylon headpieces in Blütenblattstil. Two, Florence, Laurentian Library Plut.

Three others, Lavra 56 (63), Paris, Bibliothè- que Nationale, suppl. gr. 1081 (64), and Walters W 520 (65) are closer in their relationship because they feature not only the script style of the London lectionary but also floral headpieces and initials that can be associated with its decoration. Although diverse in their artists' interpretation of the Blütenblattstil, these two groups of manuscripts have something else in common, they were produced by monks, probably in monastic scriptoria: Constantine presbyter wrote the Harley manuscript ; Demetrios presbyter executed the two lectionaries in Florence ; the monk, Theodore, wrote the Baltimore manuscript ; and Eustratios presbyter wrote Lavra 92. Closely related to this group in ornament style only are several Blütenblattstil manuscripts written in minuscule and produced on Mt. Athos : Moscow, Historical Museum gr. 101 of 990/991 ; Athens, National Library, Ms. 263 of 991/992; and Moscow, Historical Museum Ms. gr. 108 of 993/94 (66). Mont Athos and a terminus post quern of the last years of the tenth century emerge as the likeliest date and place of origin for Arundel. 547 and the Blütenblattstil lectionaries written in "slavonie uncial" to which it bears some similarities. Above, Arundel. 547 was presented as a Constantinopolitan pro- duct of the late tenth or early eleventh century in contrast to current opinions that it is a tenth century work of the provinces, specifically Italy or Asia Minor. That the Arundel manuscript is a metropolitan work was considered also in the last century by Tikkanen who regarded the lectionary as a work of the "later Macedonian pe- riod" (67). This point of view, which is in accordance with the script and ornament styles of the manuscript, can be confirmed also by the study of three of its four Evangelist portraits. The first, on folio lv is uninscribed, but scholars have traditionally called him "John" (63) On Lavra 56, Weitzmann, Buchmalerei , 71.

This portrait is immediately recognized as a foreigner to our lectionary, an inserted leaf of parchment different in quality and color from the rest of the book, and, most importantly, painted by an artist working in a different palette and in a style unrelated to the other miniatures in the manuscript. "John "'s portrait which is the only one of the four lacking Blütenblattstil frames, is surrounded by a thin, acidic, vermillion band and by a series of chalky blue palmettes alternating with tiny bright vermillion fleur-de-lis across the neutral color of the parchment. In a manner common to Byzantine Evangelist portraits (69), "John" writes in an open codex, his console supports his scribal accessories and notes and the dextra domini issues a blessing from the right corner of the page. "John's" artist, perhaps the most skilled of those who worked on the manuscript, has created a belie- vable setting for his Evangelist by marking with furniture set in a grassy landscape, the fore, middle and background areas of the picture plane. At the middle of this composition sits the Evangelist, a monumental, sculptural centerpiece whose form is defined by medium shades of silver-gray painted over a lighter shade of the same color producing a metallic sheen. The face, although badly damaged, still reveals the murky green, peach and brown tones that have been blended with feathery brushwork. In palette, composition and figurai style, the portrait of "John" stands apart from the other three miniatures in the manuscript, and scholars are certainly correct in assigning it in general to the Palaeologan period of Byzantine painting (70). As an insert from that era, it is immaterial to the issue of the lectionary' s origin. The three remaining Evangelists, although badly justified when compared to the text area of the folios, are of approximately the same size and were drawn and painted on the same quality of parchment (68) Lazarev, ibid., 175, note 65.

The palette used for the portraits is identical to that found in the headpieces, a sure indication that these three portraits belong to the manuscript, as Tikkanen recognized (71). Unlike Evangelist portraits of the tenth century, Arundel. 547's Matthew, Mark and Luke are monumental, occupying a large portion of the scene (72). The figures are shown seated on cushioned benches accompanied by the cabinet that holds the tools of the scribe's craft, iconographie details fully in keeping with the iconography for such portraits in Byzantium. They are united as well by numerous compo- sitional details indicating that they are clearly products of the same workshop if not the same artists. They share identical gold back- grounds ; flower-strewn landscapes ; flat, stylized furniture ; the wa- ving vines painted on the sides of their footstools ; their haloes ; red-inked inscriptions and, as we have already noticed, palette. In addition, two contemporary but different figurai styles are evident. The first is represented by the portrait of Matthew on folio 63v (fig. 5). Matthew's long, narrow face, highlighted by a strong protruding jaw, is surrounded by thick, soft gray hair and beard. His delicate facial features, the most sensitively rendered aspect of the figure, are drawn on in thin lines, and modelled by carefully blended, graded flesh tones of pink, green and brown. His eyes are especially noticeable for they are clear and humanizing, and completely lack the ascetic appearance found often in Byzantine painting of the Comnenian period. In contrast to the soft modelling of the face, the treatment of the torso is more linear, dominated by broad bands and geometrically-shaped areas of color. To define the projecting and receding areas of the body, the artist applies color in the three-tone system that is characteristic of Byzantine painting but which is not found in tenth and eleventh- (71) Weitzmann [ Buchmalerei, p. 70 note] believed that the portraits were later inserts of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries but did not justify this opinion. Grabar does not offer comment on Tikkanen's and Weitzmann's observations on the portraits. This, in addition to his ascription of the manuscript to the tenth century, gives the reader the impression that he regards all four miniatures as products of the tenth century. (72) It was pointed out to me by Jeffrey Anderson that the monumental quality of the portraits is more in keeping with trends in eleventh-century Evangelist portraits than it is a reflection of miniatures made in the tenth century where the figures filled considerably less than the picture. See supra, note 69.</page><page sequence="19">354 S. P. MADIGAN centüiy painting in the provinces ("). For Matthew's robes, the artist uses aqua as the base or medium tone, and a darker version of the same color is used for the drapery folds. Light aqua represents projecting forms and is applied in flat, wide bands for drapery ridges ; in geometrically-shaped patches to produce the effects of light reflect- ed from broad surfaces ; and, in hatched strokes, a technique that allows the viewer's eye rather than the painter's brush to do the blending. The left side of the Evangelist, the side in shadow, is painted in the same gray-green color used for the floors of all three portraits. In the miniatures of Luke on folio 94v (fig. 5) and Mark on folio 13 lv (fig. 6) we find a second, less decorative, softer modelling of forms, a broader range of graded tones used to define the volumes of the body, and more elaborate drapery conventions. The organic relationships and proportions of Luke's face are better understood, with the naturalistic flesh tones so carefully blended that transitions from one color to the next are almost imperceptible (fig. 5). The artist's skill in modelling form with color is especially evident in the purple himation created by applying two layers of paint in differing colors, rose and blue, and where today the underlayer of rose is still visible in areas where the miniature has been rubbed. To represent the topography of the Evangelist's body as it is revealed by the himation, the artist uses darker shades of the base color (purple in the himation, light blue in the chiton) and as many as five tones of the base color descending through darker shades to achieve the illusion of light diflused around the cylindrical forms of the body. Equal attention is given to the unlit areas of the body where darker shades of purple articulate the roundness of Luke's left leg, the bunching fabric under his right arm, the area where his buttocks meet the cushioned bench, the shadows cast upon his right thigh, and the fabric suspended between his calves. The geometric highlights that characterized the treatment of drapery in the portrait of Matthew have been reduced in the image of Luke to a few dryly brushed light blue triangles and arcs placed on the upper thigh and knee of the figure.

Winfield suggests, and I think rightfully so, that some of the methods of layering and blending paint he has observed in mural painting may also apply to manuscript illumination of the same periods.</page><page sequence="20">Fig. 1. - Headpiece and initial, Arundel. 547, fol. 95</page><page sequence="21">Fig. 2. - Headpiece and initial, Arundel. 547, fol. 238</page><page sequence="22">Fig. 3. - "John", Arundel. 547, fol. lv.</page><page sequence="23">Fig. 4. - Matthew, Arundel. 547, fol. 63v.</page><page sequence="24">Fig. 5. - Luke, Arundel. 547, fol. 94v</page><page sequence="25">Fig. 6. - Mark, Arundel. 547, fol. 13 lv.</page><page sequence="26">Fig. 7. - Initial, Vatican, gr. 2138, 991 A.D., fol. 36v.

Nevertheless, what survives of Mark reveals the same use of the three tone system found in Luke's portrait and this is especially evident in the Evangelist's cornflower blue chiton and brown himation. Over these areas, the artist has applied darker lines of the base colors to define channels of the drapery folds and lighter shades for the broad ridges created by puckering fabric. Just as he used two colors, rose and purple, to create the shimmering effects explained above in our discussion of the portrait of Luke, to paint Mark's himation the artist combines brown and light blue, resulting in an irridescent, fawn brown modelled with icy highlights. Both figurai styles have parallels in Byzantine painting of the middle years of the eleventh century and perhaps slightly earlier 74). Char- acteristics such as the softly modelled facial features and hair, mushroom-shaped crania and high placement of the ear seen in the portrait of Matthew are repeated in two Constantinopolitan manu- scripts : a standing portrait of the same Evangelist in a copy of Chrysostom's homilies made for the emperor, Mont Sinai gr. 364 of 1042 (75) ; and a seated Matthew in the Phanar Lectionary of 1063 (76). Our first artist's manner of nesting the channels of folds into broadly highlighted ridges and his overall tendency to segment the topography of the body with bands and geometrically shaped sections (74) On Byzantine painting in the eleventh century in general, see Lazarev, Storia ; Grabar, "L'Art byzantin au xie siècle", in Cahiers Archéologiques, 17 (1967), 257 ff. ; Weitzmann, "Byzantine Miniature and Icon Painting in the Eleventh Century", in Studies in Classical and Byzantine Manuscript Illumination, ed.

Bonicatti, "Per una Introduzione alla cultura mediobizantina di Costantinopoli", in Rivista dell'Istituto Nazionale d'Archeologia e Storia dell'arte, n.s., voi. 9 (1960), 207-65. The attribution of Byzantine manuscripts to the first half of the eleventh century is still compounded by two problems : first, very few dated manuscripts with important illustration survive from this period -, and, secondly, the luxurious manuscripts which are datable to the reign of Basil II (976-1025) may have been produced either early or later in the reign.

MADIGAN of color, appear in Mont Athos, Iveron 1 , another Constantinopolitan lectionary written in "slavonie uncial" probably in the first half of the eleventh century ( 77 ). Elements of the style of the second artist compare well also with mid-eleventh century illumination. His "softer style", with its delicately modelled facial features and knobby hair tufts detailed by whispy lines, sweeping curves often swaddling the thigh, minimal use of dry, whitish highlights and the animated lower hems of the chiton and himation and, as in the first style, the nesting of drapery channels into wide, lightly colored ridges appear in the Phanar Lectionary's portrait of Luke and in Leningradi 2, of 1061 (78). And finally, the method of applying paint to achieve intense, almost glowing colors that often defy the art historian's attempts at descrip- tion, accords well with this period which witnesses numerous experi- ments with color and its affects best observed in the portraits of the Evangelists. For example, in Dionysiou 588, a manuscript probably illuminated in the early eleventh century, the purple color of Luke's himation is formed by ice blue highlights placed over a rose base while John wears a mustard yellow himation enhanced by a blue overlayer of paint, producing a slight green tinge in areas (79). On folio 122v of another eleventh-century manuscript, Lavra A 15, Mark's tunic changes from medium to ice blue and green is used for shadows and for the folds of the waistband while on folio 32 lv, as in Arundel. 547, ice blue highlights are placed over a maize base color (80). Finally, just as the rose layer of paint is discernible through the built up layers of paint in Luke's purple mantle in Arundel. SAI, so too does this color appear faintly in the robes of Gregory Nazianzenus on folio iv of Dionysiou 61 (81). This sophisticated and in many ways expressionistic attitude to modelling forms with color is specifically Byzantine. The figure style of the manuscript, then, argues for a t. a. q. of the middle of the eleventh century. (77) Pelekanides, Athos , I, 293-95, and especially fig. 3 (folio 247).

Because so many of the manuscripts to which it has been related above were made by monks, it is likely that the Arundel lectionary, too, is a product of a monastic scriptorium. While the present state of research on this subject is still in its infancy, it seems that Mont Athos is certainly a candidate for the location of its production. The addition of the Arundel manuscript to workshop products of the early eleventh century is an important one because this period is not as well understood in the history of Byzantine illumi- nation as are the tenth century and the second half of the eleventh century. To this period, the above study has added the numerous luxury lectionaries placed formerly in the tenth century. The most ornate of these works, produced certainly in monasteries, indicate a demand for these books among the wealthy. The determination of the historical, liturgical and theological causes for this demand, a worthy subject admittedly beyond the scope of the present study, is critical for an understanding of all liturgical books produced in this period. Secondly, the addition of Arundel. 547 to manuscripts produced in the early eleventh century is important to our understanding of the origin and developments of style in this period because in this regard, most of our information is based on the illustrated minuscule manus- cripts associated with the reign of Basil II (976-1025) which may have been made at either end of the monarch's reign. The Evangelist portraits in the Arundel lectionary are unrelated to these manuscripts and, instead, foresee trends in the middle of the eleventh century. Moreover, the appearance in the Arundel lectionary of two contempo- rary but different, and one might add, equally competent figure styles accords well with the present understanding of workshop practice in the eleventh century, represented by products such as the Phanar lectionary which was painted also by artists practicing different but contemporary styles. In this way, the Arundel lectionary is another indication of the stylistic diversity possible in this period. The eccen- tric aspects of the lectionary's initials, drawn probably by the scribe and painted by an illuminator, contribute also to our understanding of eleventh-century style. Isolated, finally, from the milieu of provincial</page><page sequence="33">358 S. P. MADIGAN characteristics to which they had been bound in the past, the Arundel manuscript's initials may now be regarded as another aspect of stylistic diversification rather than as the ill-conceived elements of an otherwise luxurious manuscript. Some of the initials in eleventh-century Con- stantinopolitan manuscripts, such as those featuring arms holding palm sprays, are highly original creations when compared to the more restrained but charming animal initials of the tenth century. The appearance of similar types in later eleventh-century manuscripts underscores the need for more serious consideration of these forms. The participation of the scribe in the Arundel manuscript's initials may help explain how these creations came to find favor in the most luxurious of illuminated manuscripts in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. At present, the stylistic diversity found in Constantinopolitan illumination in the eleventh century has been indicated by a few datable manuscripts and monuments but the topic has not been completely investigated, nor can it be until the first half of the period is better reconstructed. In the field of art history, we tend to assume that the "best" styles were formulated and disseminated from the capital and that any deviation from what we have identified as the Constantinopolitan "canons" of a period are symptomatic of provin- cial manufacture. One must assume also that artists of diverse back- grounds were drawn easily to metropolitan areas in Byzantium, particularly Constantinople, attracted by the employment opportuni- ties fueled by the demand for books. Rather than emphasize regula- rization or standardization of style in the capital, it seems more important to consider what of the more unexplainable aspects of a manuscript are the result of their production in Constantinople, a place that was surely something of a "melting pot" of many different styles in some periods. In order to fully understand Byzantine manuscript illumination in Constantinople, or in any metropolitan area in Byzantium, it seems important that the art historian allow when appropriate a few anomalies of decoration. Without this tolerance, many of the more important products of Constantinople manuscript illumination, like Arundel. 547, will continue to be exiled to the provinces and the picture of book production in the capital will remain an incomplete one.
