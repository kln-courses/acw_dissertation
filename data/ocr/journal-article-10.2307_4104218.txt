<plain_text><page sequence="1">A MIMBRES ALTAR GROUP In its Centennial Year, The Art Institute of Chicago has been fortunate to add to its collections one of the most important groups of ancient North American art objects ever discovered. The group is comprised of ten objects that formed a sacred altar created and used by the Mimbres culture which flourished in Southern New Mexico c. 00ooo A.D. The altar group is the first major acquisition made by the Centennial Fund. While caches of altar objects have previously been found in the region, this group's unique im- portance is due to the high aesthetic quality of its sculptured objects, their remarkable state of preserva- tion and their role as prototypes for a range of South- western artistic forms. Two principal figures personify a male and female deity (figs. I and 2). A mountain lion, two rattlesnakes, a basketry container, four ceremonial throwing sticks (grouped in fig. 3), and a set of decorated cotton textiles (not pictured) complete the cache. The central male figure is a unique discovery which, along with the mountain lion (fig. 4), has to be regarded as an archetypal form. These pieces must be referred to when considering the rich tradition of similar sculptural types produced in the ancient South- west and those that are still being created in today's culturally viable Pueblo communities. The large wooden male figure is the most impressive human sculptural image ever found from an ancient Pueblo culture and has its descendants in the Kachina figures The Bulletin of The Art Institute of Chicago is published six times yearly in January, March, May, July, September and November by the Art Institute, S.

It is interesting to note that the cottonwood used by the Mimbres sculptor to create the male figure is the same type of wood used by historic Pueblo carvers for their Kachinas and the rarely-seen Kiva altar figures. The mountain lion is so close in general form and detail to those produced by the Zunis in the 19th century that one could make a strong case for a direct influence of a Mimbres proto- type on the ancient tradition that was continued through the historical Zuni tribe. The objects were discovered in a dry cave located in New Mexico's Cliff Valley. The male deity, the mountain lion and the black and white snake were in one bundle, while the female figure was encased in the basketry container along with the red-brown snake. The four crooked throwing sticks painted with a white clay slip were bound with braided cord in a separate group. The two main packages were then very carefully wrapped in the cotton textiles and placed in a shallow pit that had been dug in the cave floor and lined with dried grasses. The attention to these details and the protective dry atmosphere of the cave were responsible for the unusually fine state of preservation of both the sculptured materials, their decorations and painted surfaces. Because of the way the objects were prepared and hidden it seems that they were cached in the remote cave location to insure their safety. Such figures were, and among some Pueblo, tribes still are, used in the elaborate ceremonials that form the essence of the religious lives of the Native American peoples of the region. These types of objects are usually associated with the under- ground Kiva, a ritual chamber used by almost all Pueblo peoples both ancient and historic. We know from various accounts that in times of danger the ritual objects from the Kivas were often hidden some distance from the village to be recovered when the danger had passed. The evidence shows that this group waited more than seven hundred years before being recovered. Because of the unique nature of this discovery, the objects were the subject of a thorough series of complex scientific tests to provide much-needed data concerning the composition of their materials and their dates. Carbon- 4 dating tests were done on wood samples of the large male figure and on the cloth in which the objects were covered. These tests indicated an approximate date of i50o A.D. for the wooden figure and an approximate date of 1400 A.D. for the cloth. The date range is of great interest because it indicates that the sculptural figures were produced at the height of what archaeologists now consider to be the classic phase of the Mimbres culture and probably were used by the Mimbres or a related group for three hundred years before they were hidden in the cave site. The results of wood anatomy tests indicated that all wood used was native to the Southwest and to the Cliff Valley area specifically. The stone from which the female deity was carved is known as tuff and is also common in that region. Once we had determined the nature of the basic materials, exacting analyses were made of the paints and other decorative elements associated with the figures. Inge Fiedler of The Art Institute of Chicago Conservation Department prepared samples of each pigment area for microprobe analysis by the McCrone Laboratories in Chicago. Her subsequent report identified the pigments and was able to show that they are formed naturally in the geographic area in question. A later comparison with pigments excavated from other Mimbres sites showed a direct concordance between the samples taken from the altar figures and those proven to have been used by ancient Mimbres artists. The feather necklace of the male figure was then studied by an ornithologist. A total of eleven 4</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 4. Figure of a spotted mountain lion, wood, turquoise, cotton yarn, ochre, white and black mineral pigments, L. 13 in. 1979-17 species of birds was identified, of which ten are native to the Cliff Valley area. The sole exception was the scarlet macaw (Ara macao), a bird native to Mexico whose brilliant feathers were a common trade item in the ancient Southwest. The scientific tests securely located the figures in the area and time sequence of the Mimbres culture. It was then neces- sary to compare the figures with examples of other ancient Southwestern art objects to place them in a stylistic context and to establish an identification of the individual pieces and their iconographic relation- ship to each other. After a great deal of comparative research, a coherent picture of the altar group has been formed. Precise iconographic identification is hard to formulate due to the fact that the Mimbres culture, which prob- ably dispersed almost seven hundred years ago, left neither written records nor an oral tradition. Conse- quently, identification of the altar figures was made by interpolating information that is known about similar types of objects that are from existing Pueblo cultures. This proved to be a viable approach because these historic groups are directly tied to an ancestral past that was roughly analogous to and contemporary with the Mimbres culture itself. Based on this approach, it seems clear that the altar group represents one of the primary religious concepts of Southwestern culture. The female and male figures are personifications of the Earth and the Sky and as such embody the principal elements of the culture's spiritual philosophy. The same religious constructs are at the base of many Southwestern Indian peoples where the two deities are often referred to as Mother Earth and Father Sky-titles that are easily associated with the two anthropomorphic figures. The female representation is carved from stone and predominantly painted with a yellow ochre that traditionally refers to both corn and pollen. These are still regarded by the Pueblo peoples as the sacred plant stuffs that represent the sustenance and fertility of the Earth. The triangular pattern on her skirt is also used in reference to the corn plant-the staple crop of 5</page><page sequence="6">A Mimbres Altar Group Native American agriculture. This relationship to corn is further emphasized when the figure is placed in the twilled basketry container in which it was found. As the oblong yellow body is surrounded by the tasseled fiber wrap, its visual similarity to an ear of corn in its husk is unmistakable. When this is realized, the basket's unusual braided tassels make iconographic sense as the silk and the roots of the corn plant-a detail still used in images of Mother Earth created by the Navajo ritual sand painters. Just as the female deity corresponds to representa- tions of Mother Earth, so does the large male figure relate directly to the symbols of Father Sky used by the historical native cultures of the area. The necklace of bird feathers is an obvious sky reference reinforced by its placement against his chest which is painted with brilliant turquoise bolts of lightning. The black and white pattern of diamond shapes on his belt or skirt may be seen as a symbol of stars or the con- stellations in the night sky as they appear on certain Hopi Kachinas and in Navajo ritual sand paintings. The yellow mountain lion with its white stomach area spotted with black also relates to the symbolism of the male figure. This relationship can be traced in Hopi mythology where the mountain lion of this type is specifically related to the region of the Sky as opposed to the Earth or the underworld. The snakes that were found with each figure also carry important symbolic meaning in most Pueblo cultures where they are simultaneously a reference to lightning and to water. As such they are most often seen as the Avanyu serpent that is commonly used to decorate Pueblo pottery and ritual objects. All of the sculptures described thus far are adorned with bundles of native cotton yarn which have been dyed in various natural shades of red, brown and indigo. These seem to be offerings of some importance associated with images of gods. A survival of this role for dyed yarns can be seen in the Hopi and Zuni tribes' use of similar yarns that are bound around the wrists of the Kachina Dancers in their guise as sacred spirits. The sculptors of these tribes also use the same materials to create body ornaments on the Kachina figures they carve. The importance of this altar group to the history of Native American art and culture thus rests on two foundations: their intrinsically high aesthetic quality as art objects, and their broadly based relationship to the development of ancient and historic Southwestern art and culture. In the largest terms the unique inter- related ensemble which centers around the two anthro- pomorphic figures can be seen as symbols of the active- passive, male-female duality that exists at the core of the sophisticated Southwestern Indian natural phi- losophy. One need only compare the intense and animated gaze of the male figure with the self- contained and introspective form and features of the female to see how effectively the artist who created them has reflected this essential concept. The Mimbres altar group is on permanent dis- play in the Native American section of the McKinlock Court Galleries. EVAN MAURER Curator Department of Primitive Art 6</page></plain_text>
