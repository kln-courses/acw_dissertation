General Motors Research Labs. ABSTRACT This report describes a series of experiments using Hexcel(TM) to limit the impact force in lateral abdominal impacts. Two hundred fourteen (214) anesthetized New Zealand White rabbits were impacted at 5 to 15 m/s using a pneumatic impactor. Injury responses from tests with a force-limiting impact interface (94 tests) were compared with the responses from tests with a rigid impact interface (120 tests) having the same level of lateral abdominal compression. The Hexcel had a length of 3 inches, the same diameter as the rigid impactor, and crushed at a constant force (pressure level of 232 kPa (33 psi)) once deformation was initiated. The results of these tests showed that the probability of serious abdominal injury did not change significantly with the Hexcel, even though peak pressures were reduced to as little as one third of their previous values. The overall abdominal injury severity was dominated by hepatic injuries which remained as severe with Hexcel as the interface, although the probability of sustaining a renal laceration was three times lower with Hexcel. As seen in previous studies, the biomechanics of soft tissue injury appear to be dominated by the Viscous response. IN ANTICIPATION OF INJURY MITIGATING EFFECTS from force-limiting or energy-absorbing materials, many studies have been done to determine whether such materials should be incorporated into automotive interiors in locations such as the side door, armrest, or instrument panel. Typical materials under consideration are open and closed cell foam padding materials, rubber, some polymers, expanded metals, and honeycombs. Some studies have evaluated the mechanical properties of these materials [1-3] 1 ? others have examined how these materials affect the severity of injury in tests with cadavers, animals, and anthropomorphic test devices [2-9]. The material used in this study was Hexcel™, an aluminum honeycomb material that crushes at a constant force or pressure as determined by the wall thickness and cell size of the Hexcel (Figure 1). The crush strength was independent of deformation rate in the range of impact velocity we used. Two crush strengths were used which will be referred to as low crush strength (232 kPa or 34 psi), and high crush strength (319 kPa or 46 psi). These limited the force to asl kN (237 lbs) and *1.5 kN (327 lbs), respectively. In the first phase of this study which was previously published [10], at the threshold for serious abdominal injury in the rabbit, the pressure was approximately 280 kPa (40 psi). But, injury correlated better with the velocity and the extent of abdominal compression than with the force or pressure supporting the recent concept of a Viscous mechanism of soft tissue injury2. [10,20,21] Values reported in the literature for the pressure tolerance of the abdomen associated with AIS &gt;= 3 injury range from 214 kPa (31 psi) to 386 kPa (56 psi) [4,5,11,12], but the peak pressure has not proven to be a reliable correlate with injury [10,12]. More recent work has shown that the rate and the extent of compression are more reliable indicators of soft 1 Numbers in brackets [] indicate references at the end of the paper. 2 The Viscous mechanism of injury relates the injury sustained by soft tissues during impact with the mechanical environment they experience. The parameters which have been shown to describe the mechanical environment are the compression and the ràte (velocity) of compression, and the functional relationship is the product of the instantaneous compression and rate of compression during the impact. 5.634 0096-736X/87/9505-0634$02.50 Copyright 1987 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">861879 tissue injury, and particularly of abdominal injury [10,13,20]. FORCE (OR PRESSURE) AND ABDOMINAL INJURY - McElhaney et al. [4] and Stalnaker et al. [5] performed experiments on human cadavers and various species of monkey and observed that an "ESI=3" injury (moderate trauma to abdominal organs necessitating surgical repair) required 131 kPa (19 psi) with a blunt wedge shaped impactor, and 386 kPa (56 psi) with a "flat rigid striker of larger cross section than the animal struck". Melvin et al. [11] performed tests on anesthetized rhesus monkeys and noted the onset of "moderate trauma" at 310 kPa (45 psi) when the test velocities were in the range of 2.5 to 5 m/s. Stalnaker et al. [14] and Trollope et al. [15] observed that the pressure required to produce various levels of hepatic injury in baboons was dependent on the size and shape of the impactor. Trollope stated, that "... equal injuries were produced when a pressure of 87 psi was applied with a bar impactor and 22 psi was applied with a large-surface impactor." (The reader will note that this result conflicts with that reported by McElhaney and Stalnake references 4 and 5.) From dimensional analysis, the authors concluded that the severity of abdominal injury is related to the peak impact force, impact duration, mass of the subject, and the contact area of the impactor. Trollope 's study [15] showed that only a small percentage of the impact force is actually transmitted to any single organ in an abdominal impact. Their experiments with external blunt abdominal impacts required 1.6 kN (350 lbs) to produce the same level of injury as 0.7 kN (150 lbs) delivered directly to exposed organs. To minimize the number of variables in our study the impactor geometry and size were kept constant. Melvin et al., in another study [6], examined the responses of 7 cadavers in sled impacts into rigid or padded walls. Abdominal injuries were observed only in the rigid wall impacts, but forces on the cadavers were not measured. Thoracic injury severity was reduced in high speed impacts into padded walls, but it increased in low velocity impacts. Gogler et al. [12] found that for Gottingen minipigs impacted at 10 to 17 m/s, the threshold of force to produce "AIS = 3-4" injury was 1471 N (331 lbs). In these tests, the Figure 1 Diagram of typical Hexcel configuration, and parameters of the Hexcel used in this study. 5.635</page><page sequence="3">subjects were propelled into the rear air spoiler of a Porsche 911 , with impact occurring at the mid-abdominal region. The size of the spoiler was not stated, and had to be estimated from the scale drawings in the paper. We assumed that the width of the impact area was 25 cm and that the thickness pf the spoiler was 2.5-5.1 cm. These dimensions would yield pressures in the range of 193-593 kPa (28-86 psi). The authors noted that "... the curves show that tolerance cannot be defined using the- criterion or impact force and duration only...", further indication of the importance of the viscous mechanism of soft tissue injury. Nusholtz et al. [7] used rigid and padded impact surfaces in a series of tests on 12 primates, 10 canines, and 3 human cadavers. Comparison of the padded versus rigid impacts was not done, but a review of the data shows that 4 out of the 5 padded impacts had AIS &gt; 3 kidney injury, while only 2 out of the five rigid impacts had a kidney injury. Serious abdominal injury (AIS ^ 3) was observed in all of the primate tests, where the test velocities ranged from 8 to 13 m/s and the compressions from 60 to 80%. Examination of the tabulated forces shows that serious abdominal injury occurred with forces as low as 1.3 kN (292 lbs) when the primates were tested with padded surfaces . Walfisch et al. [16], using cadavers in one and two meter drop tests, showed that the severity of liver injuries was correlated to "normalized" impact force (r=.98, p unknown). The cadavers were dropped onto hardwood, polystyrene, or phenospan simulated armrests. While a force-deflection corridor for lateral abdominal impacts was determined, the data was from only 8 cadavers. In addition, only two impact speeds were examined, although the authors acknowledged that the impact speed significantly affects the stiffness of the human abdomen. The force-deflection characteristics of the polystyrene and the phenospan were not given in the paper. The authors stated a value of 260 kPa (38 psi) as "...being associated with an AIS 3 for the abdomen". These force-deflection curves were then used in the design of a dummy abdomen by Maltha and Stalnaker [17]. Lau and Viano [18] studied hepatic injuries to beagles caused by belt-restraint loading (frontal). The study was restricted to a single velocity-compression combination of 1.7m/s and 60% compression. The average peak pressures were 340 ± 40 kPa (49 psi) and 330 ± 20kPa (48 psi) for transverse belt orientation and diagonal orientation, respectively. Ät that low velocity-high compression combination they noted that "...(the) injury was primarily caused by excessive tissue deformation via a crushing or tearing mechanism." In our previous study [10] we observed that peak impact force was significantly correlated to injury, and the mean peak impact force producing AIS £ 3 injury was approximately 276 kPa (40 psi) . THE VISCOUS RESPONSE AND ABDOMINAL INJURY - McElhaney et al. [4] and Stalnaker et al. [5] also observed that "...small changes in velocity greatly change the injury level, ... (and) ... the depth of penetration ... is also an important variable..." indicating the importance of what we now know as the Viscous mechanism of soft tissue injury. Melvin's study of rhesus monkeys [11] noted that "Both the liver . . . and the kidney tests demonstrated the sensitivity of these organs to the rate of loading", but the "...rate of loading was most pronounced on the liver". The rate of loading may have been less significant for the kidney because the velocity range was below the threshold of serious kidney injury [10]. Lau and Viano [19] performed a series of frontal impacts to anesthetized rabbits in which the compression was held at a constant 16% of the abdominal thickness and the pre-impact velocity was varied from 8 to 16 m/s. They noted that "the liver showed a consistent increase in injury severity with impact velocity", with a transition from minor liver injury to lacerative liver injury at 12 m/s. Viano and Lau [21] first proposed the concept of a Viscous Tolerance for soft tissues in the body from their analysis of frontal thoracic impacts on rabbits. The experiments included velocities of compression in the range of 5 m/s to 22 m/s, and maximum thoracic compressions of 4% to 55%. On the basis of occurrence of critical-fatal injury, the experiments confirmed a velocity and a compression sensitive tolerance to chest impact. The product of the maximum velocity and the maximum compression was shown to be a measure of the energy dissipated by the viscous elements in the thorax. Probit analysis allowed the determination of the 50% probability of critical-fatal thoracic injury at Vmax*Cmax = 4.0 m/s. In our previous series of 117 lateral abdominal impacts [10], which comprised the first phase of these experiments, we noted that the probability of serious abdominal injury was well correlated to the product of the pre-impact velocity and the maximum abdominal compression (Vmax*Cmax), which we called the Abdominal Injury Criterion (AIC) . The 50% probability of serious abdominal injury was determined to be at Vmax*Cmax = 3.3 m/s for left side impacts, and 2.7 m/s for right side impacts. Stalnaker and Ulman [13] re-examined data previously published to determine an abdominal response corridor for dummy design. The three sets of data examined included that of Beckman et al, Stalnaker et al., and Trollope et al. A single force-deflection corridor was proposed for both lateral and frontal impacts to the upper and middle abdominal regions. The corridor was determined primarily from cadaver data of Walfisch et al., and has a stiffness quite similar to the thoracic stiffness which seems to be too stiff. The Viscous response of the 5.636</page><page sequence="4">861879 abdomen (Vmax*Cmax) was validated and suggested to be independent of species. Horsch et al. [21] and Lau et al. [22] , in more recent experiments on upper abdominal injury in anesthetized swine with steering wheel contact, found the viscous response to be the superior predictor of the severity and the time of occurrence of liver injury. These studies showed that liver injury by steering wheel contact occurred prior to maximum compression of the abdomen or maximum acceleration of the spine, but at the same time as the peak of the abdominal viscous response. The average maximum viscous response for tests resulting in critical liver injury was [VC]max = 1.8 m/s. Kroell et al. [24] also found the Viscous response to be the best indicator of cardiac rupture in high-speed blunt frontal impacts to anesthetized swine. In 41 tests, cardiac rupture showed no correlation with maximum chest compression, but was highly correlated with Vmax*Cmax and [ VC] max. The 50% probability of cardiac rupture occurred at Vmax*Cmax - 3.7 m/s, and [VC]max = 2.0 m/s. CURRENT THINKING ON SOFT TISSUE INJURY - It is clear from recent work that the extent of soft tissue injury is well correlated to the Viscous response of the tissue, i.e., the compression and the velocity (rate of compression) [10,20,21,22]. The Viscous response appears to apply in frontal and lateral impacts, to the thorax and to the abdomen. Lau et al. [20,21,22] have proposed that knowledge of the instantaneous Viscous response throughout the impact allows the determination of when injury occurs to specific organs, and allows new insights for occupant protection. METHODS Two hundred fourteen (214) New Zealand wiii te rabbits (2.5-3.5 kg) were used in this study.* The study was separated into two phases, with phase one involving a rigid impact interface and 120 rabbits as previously published [10], and phase two involving the Hexcel interface with 94 rabbits. Each rabbit was fasted overnight prior to use, and then preanesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (35 mg/kg IM) and xylazine (5 mg/kg IM). Deep surgical anesthesia was achieved and maintained with Sodium Pentobarbital (25 mg/kg IV, to effect). The animals were shaved from forelimbs to hindlimbs around their entire circumference to remove the fur from the impact area. Electrical leads were attached subcutaneously to monitor lead II of the ECG, and a pressure transducer (Size 5F, Millar PC-350) was inserted into the esophagus and advanced to the upper thoracic level (T4) to monitor the esophageal presssure. For phase one all rabbits also had a pressure transducer inserted into the femoral artery on the side opposite the impact location. Since no correlations were noted between injury and blood pressure, this invasive procedure was discontinued in phase two. Finally, the animals were placed in a sling in front of a high speed pneumatic impactor (Figure 2), zoometric measurements were taken, and a single controlled impact was delivered to the left or right side. Hypothesis testing showed that the average mass of the animals tested with Hexcel as the impact interface (3.05 ± .29 kg), was the same as the average mass of those tested with a rigid impact interface (2.88 ± .34 kg). To the face of the impactor, we attached a smooth aluminum disk in all phase one tests, or a single sample of Hexcel in each phase two test. The samples of Hexcel had been machined into cylindrical shape, with a diameter of 7.6 cm (3.0"), and a height of 7.0 cm (2.75") (Figure 1). (The diameter of the Hexcel was equal to that of the aluminum rigid impact disk.) Each Hexcel sample was mounted onto a base plate of aluminum (6.35 mm thick), and capped with an aluminum disk (1.58 mm thick). The mass of the base plate, cap, and Hexcel sample was 0.131 kg. Because of the Hexcel ' s momentum at the end of the impact stroke, a metal-filled epoxy was necessary to hold it onto the base plate. The base plate was screwed onto the impactor. The aluminum cap prevented injury by edge loading from the sharp cells. Before mounting, each Hexcel sample was precrushed 6.35 mm (1/4") quasi-statically on an MTS universal testing machine. During precrush, force-displacement curves were generated for each sample which demostrated that the crush strength values were very reproducible for both types of Hexcel used. Figure 2 Schematic of the experimental apparatus, with a detailed view of the pneumatic impactor . * The rationale and experimental protocol for the use of an animal model in this program have been reviewed by the Research Laboratories' Animal Research Committee. The research follows procedures outlined in the U.S. DHEW Guide for the [ Cane and Use of_ Laboratory Animals, or the U.S. DHEW-NiH Guidelines for the Use of Experi mental Animals . and complies fully with the USDA regulations in the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act of 1970 and 1976 (PL 89-544). 5.637</page><page sequence="5">To examine the method of adding Hexcel to the pneumatic impactorf the mechanics of the impact event were analyzed. During impact the Hexcel did crush, but the mechanics of the impactor (captive piston) gave rise to sufficiently large decelerations to cause the Hexcel to uncrush as the piston was snubbed. That is, the force exerted on the Hexcel, due to the momentum change of the aluminum cap, was sufficient to uncrush the Hexcel that had just been crushed in the experiment. Therefore, to determine how much the samples used in the experiments had crushed, we recrushed them on an MTS universal testing machine while recording force and displacement. Control samples were: (1) also crushed a known amount on the MTS, (2) uncrushed on the pneumatic impactor as if in an experiment (but without the animal), and (3) subsequently recrushed on the MTS. Hexcel used in an experiment required a lower force to produce the same amount of deflection as Hexcel that was not used in an experiment (never crushed) . Comparison of the force-deflection curves from the samples used in experiments with those from the controls allowed determination of the amount the Hexcel crushed in the experiments. In addition, the amount of sample crush showed linear correlation with the pre-impact piston velocity (Figure 3), with a correlation coefficient of R=.83, (pc.001). This is in good agreement with the results of the rigid impactor study which showed a linear correlation of the peak impact force with pre-impact velocity, with R= . 95 (Figure 4 ). For high velocity impacts, it is reasonable to expect the impact force to remain high for a longer time than in low velocity impacts. Thus, there should be a progression to more crush of the Hexcel as the impact velocity (and hence the peak force) increases. o.8-| ; 06 - ** .... X ^ t/ł . . 4) •' . -5 jC 02 ~ ....

(* = without Hexcel, A = with Hexcel) To examine the motion of the Hexcel/animal interface, high speed x-ray cineradiography was performed in several tests, because in visible light high speed movies of the tests the impact interface was obscured from view as the impactor compressed the animal. The uncrushing of the Hexcel appeared to take place in contact with the animal, before whole body motion started. Therefore, the Hexcel continued to compress the animal as it uncrushed to its original length. Then the preset compression was the actual compression we input to the animal since the pre-impact position of the animal was determined assuming that the Hexcel wouldn't crush. (The compressions in these experiments were from 10 to 50 percent of the abdominal diameter measured at the distal tip of the 12th rib.) Then, as measured in terms of compression, the exposure severities in the tests with Hexcel as the interface, were similar to those in the tests with the rigid impact interface. In contrast, although the pre-impact velocities were identical to those in the rigid interface tests, the velocity of the impact interface had to be lower during some phase of the Hexcel tests when the Hexcel crushed. The velocities reported here are defined as the velocity of the front surface of the impactor immediately before impact (pre-impact velocity) . It is measured for each experiment just prior to impact, by a photocell which records the transit time for two grooves with a known spacing on the piston shaft. The velocities used in phase I were from 3 to 15 m/s (6.6 to 33 mph), and in phase II were from 7.5 to 15 m/s (16.5 to 33 mph). The pre-impact velocities were upper bounds on the velocity because the crushing of the Hexcel could only 5.638</page><page sequence="6">861879 have reduced the velocity of the Hexcel-rabbit interface. Immediately following impact, euthanasia was administered to the animals by injection of T-61 Euthanasia Solution (1ml IV). A complete abdominal necropsy was then performed. The condition of the abdominal organs was determined from macroscopic examination, and classified according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS-80). The thoracic organs were also examined for laceration, severe contusion, and rib fracture, but were not included in the analysis. The probability of injury with AIS £ 3 (contusive) and AIS £ 4 (lacerative) was determined from the necropsy results using Eq. (1). Prob of Injury(AIS £ n) = number of subjects with AIS £ n (1) number tested at parameter The input biomechanical variables were pre- impact velocity and maximum compression, and several tests were performed at each combination of these variables. Varying the pre-impact velocity and the maximum compression caused the peak impact force (which was measured by a load cell mounted between the piston and the Hexcel) to vary as well. The results of our experiments were sorted into groups, by velocity, compression, velocity times compression, and peak force to examine any correlations of these variables with injury severity. The probability of injury was determined at each value of the variable tested in each group. For example, the probability of injury at 5, 10, and 15 m/s with Hexcel as the interface, would each be calculated separately using the tests in each group . The force on the animal was continuously recorded through a 44 kN (10,000 lbs) load cell which was attached to the impactor between the piston shaft and the Hexcel holder. During impact the load cell only senses the force due to the mass behind it, but the subject senses the entire mass of the impactor, including the load cell and the Hexcel assembly. Several attempts were made to compensate the load cell to account for the mass in front of it (the Hexcel assembly, which included the Hexcel, cap, and base) . Compensation is usually possible using an accelerometer mounted on the mass in front of the load cell. Our attempts at compensation were not fruitful owing to the large decelerations experienced during snubbing of the piston. The stopping was so severe that a 100,000 g accelerometer and several lower range accelerometer s were destroyed. (The mechanism of destruction was probably case deformation rather than overdriving the inertial mass.) While we could not compensate for added mass in front of the load cell, the load readings can be corrected using standard techniques. Assume that the total mass of the impactor, load cell, and Hexcel assembly is given by "M" . Then the force the subject experiences (the interface force) while decelerating the piston with acceleration equal to "a" is M times a. If the mass in front of the load cell (the Hexcel assembly) is given by "m", then the force the load cell experiences during the impact, while it tries to decelerate the mass behind it, is equal to (M-m)a. Since the two accelerations are the. same for a rigid body, then the two forces are related by Eq. (2). (M - m) Load Cell Force = * Interface Force (2) M The total mass in front of the load cell in these experiments was .332 kg, and the total mass of the impactor including the load cell and the Hexcel assembly was 2.10 kg. Then the load cell recorded forces were 84.2% of the actual forces experienced by the subjects. The means of the peak force values recorded during pre-crush and during impact are given in Table 1 for the low crush strength Hexcel and for 32 samples of high crush strength Hexcel which were also used in these experiments. In addition, the forces recorded during impact have been corrected with Eq. (2) and are given in the Table. The results show no significant differences between the corrected forces recorded during impact and the pre-crush forces. The reader should note that the UNCORRECTED forces have been used in the rest of this analysis. The force limiting action of the Hexcel is clear from Figures 4 and 5. Figure 4 compares the force recorded during impact with a rigid interface to the force recorded with Hexcel as the interface. They have been presented on the same graph to facilitate comparison. Note that linear regression yields r2 = .90 for the rigid impacts and r2 = .28 for the Hexcel impacts. Figure 5 compares the force-time history for a typical impact having low crush strength Hexcel as the interface with an impact having a rigid interface. Each test shown had pre-impact velocity equal to 15 m/s and maximum compression equal to 40%. The aluminum plate which covers the Hexcel acts as a distributor of forces over the entire area of the sample and as such could prevent local crushing. If the initial contact area is small, the effective crush strength that the subject would experience could be much higher than the values obtained during pre-crush. To examine this possibility a study was done of rabbit zoometry with a typical subject in the impact sling. The elliptical shape of the rabbit abdomen was preserved in the sling and lead to a nearly flat impact interface. When the impâct face was placed against the rabbit in the sling 95% of area of the impact face was in direct contact with the rabbit's abdomen. When pressure was applied to the impact face the interface was 100% coupled. The pressure was 5.639</page><page sequence="7">Table 1 Comparison of Peak Force Values Reading Force ± s.d Pressure ± s.d. n kN (pounds) kPa (psi) Low Crush Strength Hexcel Pre-crush 1.06 ± .07 231.7 ± 14.5 97 (237.3 ± 15.17) (33.6 ± 2.1) 97 Impact 0.98 ± .17 220.7 ± 37.6 38 (215.2 ± 36.6) (32.0 ± 5.3) 38 Impact 1.15 ± .20 262.2 ± 43.2 38 Corrected (255.6 ± 44.4) (38.0 ± 6.3) 38 High Crush Strength Hexcel Pre-crush 1.45 ± .09 318.6 ± 20.0 32 (326.9 ± 20.7) (46.2 ± 2.9) 32 Impact 1.28 ± .21 281.4 ±46.2 17 (288.2 ± 47.1) (40.8 ± 6.7) 17 Impact 1.54 ± .25 341.4 ± 55.9 17 Corrected (342.2 ± 55.9) 48.5 ± 7.9) 17 only enough to compress the rabbit =1/4 inch. This lead us to conclude that the crush strength experienced by the subjects should be the same as the crush strength measured in pre-crush tests. The method used to analyze the data invloved regression analysis of injury probability in relation to the force, velocity, compression, and the Abdominal Injury Criterion or AIC . The AIC is a less rigorous and more specific form of the Viscous Criterion, [VC]max, proposed by Viano and Lau [10,20,21,22,23]. The AIC is the product of the pre-impact (or maximum) velocity and the maximum compression. In contrast, the [VC]max is the maximum of the product of the instantaneous rate of compression and the compression. (Eqs. 3 and 4). AIC = Vmax * Cmax (3) [VC]max = (V(t)*C(t) )max (4) When the velocity profile of the interface during impact remains constant, Vmax*Cmax = [VC]max. The experiments with the rigid impact interface are very good approximations to this constant velocity situation because the impactor piston is driven 3-1 Legend /' ■ Without Hexcel I ' □ With Hexcel 2 / / i / 0) / ^ ■ U / ' / / ' o / ' u_ I ' 0 -j mJ- ; ¡ ¡ , □ 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 Time (msec) Figure 5 Typical force-time history with Hexcel and without Hexcel. 5.640</page><page sequence="8">861879 by the expanding gas from the load cylinder. In tests where the velocity profile changes, as in the experiments where the Hexcel crushed, [VC]max provides an instantaneous measure of the severity, whereas Vmax*Cmax only provides a measure of the maximum severity. Then if one uses [VC]max, it is possible to determine the approximate time that injury occurs from the position in time that the maximum occurs, but it is not possible to determine the time of injury if if one uses Vmax*Cmax. We did not monitor the interface velocity during impact and have used Vmax*Cmax as the biomechanical parameter to be tested. To avoid confusion, the definitions associated with the Viscous mechanism of injury as given by Lau and Viano [23] are presented here: Viscous Criterion = a biomechanical index of potential for injury in soft tissue based on its rate sensitivity. Viscous response = VC, a function of time formed by the product of the instantaneous compression C(t), and the instantaneous rate (or velocity) of compression, V(t). Viscous tolerance = the risk of soft tissue injury associated with a specific impact- induced Viscous response, VC. The maximum risk occurs at the peak Viscous response, [VC]max. The Viscous criterion can also be misleading if it is used for impacts outside its range of applicability, such as very low velocity but high compression impacts. In low velocity impact, the dominant mechanism of injury is crushing and the Viscous response is not applicable. For example, if the impact velocity was 1 mm/s (.001 m/s) and the compression was 100%, the injury would definitely be serious but the Viscous response would indicate a low probability of serious injury. RESULTS The probability of injury with AIS &gt; 3 (contusive) and AIS &gt; 4 (lacerative) as determined by Eq. (1) is tabulated for the liver and the kidney in Tables 2 and 3. Comparisons were made of tests in identical ranges of Vmax*Cmax to ensure comparison of probability in exposures of nominally identical severity. The results were subjected to a chi-squared analysis, to determine if the probability of sustaining injury of a given severity was independent of the presence of Hexcel . The probability of sustaining a serious renal or hepatic contusion, or a hepatic laceration was INDEPENDENT of the presence of Hexcel, at the 5% level of significance. However, the probability of sustaining a renal laceration was DEPENDENT on the presence of Hexcel, also at the 5% level of significance. That is, Hexcel reduced the probability of renal laceration by a factor of 3, but it did not reduce the probability of hepatic laceration, nor renal or hepatic contusion. The probability of injury was graphed versus velocity, compression, Vmax*Cmax, and Table 2 Probability of Renal Injury Test Series N P(AIS &gt; 3) P(AIS &gt; 4) Rigid Interface 88 .44 .33 Low Crush Strength Hexcel 68 .31 .10 High Crush Strength Hexcel 21 .43 .10 Table 3 Probability of Hepatic Injury1 Test Series N P(AIS &gt; 3) P(AIS &gt; 4) Rigid Interface 43 .56 .56 Low Crush Strength Hexcel 45 .64 .60 High Crush Strength Hexcel 14 .71 .64 1 Since previous experiments showed no liver injury from left side impacts (a result corroborated in these tests), hepatic injury was determined from right side impacts only. 5.641</page><page sequence="9">peak force. Linear regression analysis was performed , and the correlations of probability of confusive and lacerative renal and hepatic injury with these biomechanical parameters were tabulated and graphed (Tables 4 and 5; Figure 6 a-d for AIS £ 3 liver injuries; Figure 6 e-h for AIS £ 3 kidney injuries; Figure 6i for AIS £ 4 kidney injuries). Each data point in these graphs represents the numerical average for all tests performed at that value of the biomechanical parameter being studied. The dotted curves above and below the regression line represent 95% confidence limits. DISCUSSION RENAL INJURY - Hexcel mitigated lacerative renal injury, but it did not affect confusive renal injury. When the impact interface was rigid, the probability of sustaining a renal injury correlated very well with Vmax*Cmax [10] and with the peak force, and was especially poorly correlated with the compression (Table 4). When the low crush strength Hexcel was the impact interface, the probability of injury was still well correlated to the peak force and Vmax*Cmax (Figure 6e &amp; f), and poorly with compression alone and velocity alone. The correlation with peak force is due to the sharp transition from no injury at lower velocities when the Hexcel did not crush, to 50% probability of renal contusion at higher velocities when the Hexcel did crush. The probability of lacerative injury was 3 times lower with Hexcel (Table 2), and there was no correlation of AIS £ 4 renal injury probability with peak force because there were so few of these injuries (Table 4-b-2). It appears that kidney injury occurred very early in lateral impacts, and at relatively high pre-impact velocities (and consequently at high forces). The peak force occurred at approximately 1-2 milliseconds into the impact. At that time, the impact interface was probably traversing the location of the kidney as seen in Figure 7. At a velocity of 10-15 m/s (10-15 millimeters/millisecond), the interface would require 1-2 milliseconds to move the »1.0' cm i-, r r S * Z S "O &gt;s 0.5- ^ 0.5- 1 Ī i i ^ ¿ o- 0 -1 , ! - 0 -I ! 1 1 1 1 5 io 15 20 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 A) Pre-Impact Velocity (m/s) B) Maximum Abdominal Compression (%) l-ļ 7 - j - ļ h 7 -y * r ///' r o / /V ^ /X X 0.5- 7 / : ^ 0.5- / 5 /' / •' J5 ; * "o ' / o / ; 0_) m , , , o-H - ¡ i 1 1 1 0.5 0.7 0.9 1.1 1.3 1.5 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 C) Peak Impact Force (kN) D) Vmax^Cmax (m/s) Figure 6 Probability of AIS £ 3 LIVER injury with a Hexcel interface VS: A) pre-impact velocity, B) maximum compression, C) peak impact force, D) Vmax*Cmax (AIC) . 5.642</page><page sequence="10">distance between the external abdominal skin and the lateral margin of the kidney. The low crush strength Hexcel limited the peak abdominal impact pressure of the rabbits to less than =s221 kPa (^31 psi), and the high crush strength Hexcel limited the peak pressure to less than -281 kPa (=41 psi). The probability of renal laceration was a factor of 3 lower with both types of Hexcel. Therefore, renal lacerations probably occur at pressures higher than 281 kPa. Renal contusion did occur in these impacts, but it occurred at forces equal to the crush strength of the Hexcel (Figure 6e) . It is clear from the figure that no contusion occurred at forces below -980 N (220 lbs), and in fact the probability of contusion increases to its maximum value of :*50% at that value of the force. The 50% probability of renal contusion in the rigid impactor tests was at 1820 N (409 lbs). This is twice the maximum peak force possible with Hexcel as the interface. So, while the peak force is an indicator of the mechanical environment during impact, and limiting the peak 861879 force mitigated renal laceration, the peak force does not appear to be a reliable indicator of renal contusion, or other injuries. HEPATIC INJURY - With the rigid impact interface, the probability of serious hepatic injury was very well correlated with Vmax*Cmax, and fairly well correlated with the velocity alone, regardless of the compression. With Hexcel as the impact interface, the probability of serious injury was well correlated to the peak force, and fairly well correlated with compression and the Vmax*Cmax. The correlation with peak force occurred because the probability of serious hepatic injury was already at its maximum before the force increased enough to cause the Hexcel to crush. In the rigid impactor tests, the probability of injury was 50% when the peak force was -900 N (200 lbs); in the Hexcel tests the probability of injury was 50% when the peak force was -870 N (195 lbs). Note that the Vmax*Cmax for 50% probability of serious HEPATIC injury (-2.7 m/s) was the same for both the rigid interface and the Hexcel interface.

THE IMPACT EVENT - While we could not monitor the velocity during impact, nor the motion of the impact interface, we can qualitatively describe the impact event through reasoning (Figure 8a-d) . The basic principle in the following discussion is that if the Hexcel crushes during the impact, then the piston must have a greater velocity than the Hexcel cap. By definition if the Hexcel crushes, then the distance between the cap to which it is cemented and the base to which it is cemented must decrease. Since the piston cannot speed up during impact, the cap must slow down for the distance between the cap and base to decrease. Unfortunately, we could not determine quantitatively the change in the cap velocity. But regardless of the quantity, the following analysis should be qualitatively correct. Figure 8a shows the force time history typical for Hexcel, and for our impacts. The time for the force to become large enough to initiate crushing of the Hexcel is less than one millisecond. The time at which the Hexcel crushes is called t(c). Typically, after approximately 1-2 milliseconds, the force plateaus, followed by an increase much later if the compression of the subject is allowed to continue. In Figure 8b, the interface velocity is shown as a function of time. While the interface is compressing the rabbit, a force is being applied to the rabbit which is proportional to the compression and the rate of compression due to the Viscous response of the tissues. The force increases as the compression increases in accordance with this response. When the force becomes greater than the amount of force the Hexcel can transmit (greater than the crush strength of the Hexcel), then the Hexcel crushes, t(c), and the interface is decelerated rapidly. When the interface velocity drops, the rate of compression drops accordingly (Figure 8d). The piston however, continues with its initial velocity undiminished (Figure 8c). As the rate of compression drops, the force consequently drops until the Hexcel stops crushing, becomes a rigid body again, and the interface is rapidly brought back to the TABLE 5 Probability of AIS ^ 3 Hepatic Injury1 a) Rigid Interface Correlate R = p &lt; Significance Vmax*Cmax .84 .0002 Highly Sig Velocity .89 .04 Significant Peak Force .78 .22 Not Sig Compression .65 .23 Not Sig b) Low Crush Strength Hexcel Correlate R = p &lt; Significance Peak Force .90 .003 Significant Compression .97 .03 Significant2 Vmax*Cmax .81 .02.

The anesthetized rabbit was given Renografin (IV, to effect), a radiopaque contrast agent, to permit visualization of the kidneys. One kidney has been highlighted for clarity. A compression band necessary to occlude the ureters caused the abdominal bulge. The true external surface at the level of the kidneys is marked by the metal bars seen lateral to the kidneys. As seen, the distance from the external surface to the medial surface of the kidney is approximately 1 cm. Thus, the time of peak force coincides well with the time of involvement of the kidney in the impact . same velocity as the piston, t(r). At some later time, t(s), the piston is snubbed so its velocity goes to zero (Figure 8c). Because the Hexcel cap has momentum, it attempts to continue on its trajectory and uncrushes the Hexcel that was just crushed (Figure 8b Sc c). The uncrushing takes place in contact with the animal which has not yet begun whole body motion (according to high speed movies). Finally at some point all of the previously crushed Hexcel has been uncrushed, and the cap tries to pull against uncrushed Hexcel, which snubs the cap. At time t(c) the Viscous response would show a precipitous decrease, and this is the time we believe the interface is compressing the kidney as judged by the time the peak force occurs and the known position of the kidney. Kidney injuries are prevented as the Hexcel crushes due to the corresponding reduction of the interface velocity. At a later time, t(s), the compression of the animal continues at or near the pre-impact velocity. At t(u) the [VC]max and Vmax*Cmax would be in agreement, both being at maxima. We believe the injuries to the liver occurred in these experiments at some time between t(r) and t(u). The force is below that necessary to crush the Hexcel, but the compression has become so great that the organ begins to crush. The Viscous response is a time varying function which we did not measure in these experiments, but we did approximate by knowledge of Vmax*Cmax which gives the maximum value of [VC] . So we conclude that while our measurement of Vmax*Cmax did provide useful information, knowledge of the time history of the Viscous response was shown to be another important factor in soft tissue injury. The time of peak Viscous response appears to correlate with the time of injury for the various organs at risk.

The finding of Stalnaker and Ulman [13] that the threshold for serious injury as measured by Vmax*Cmax was species independent supports this position. However, the probability of injury to the spleen could not be accurately extrapolated from our results owing to the spleen's smaller size in the rabbit relative to the other abdominal organs . In addition, while limiting the impact force in these experiments did mitigate renal lacerations, it was not enough to prevent all serious abdominal injury. Since the abdomen can be compressed at a very low force, the force- limitation necessary for mitigation of all serious abdominal injuries may not be achievable through padding. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS In 94 lateral abdominal impacts, we successfully limited the impact force by using an impact interface of Hexcel™ which crushed when the force reached 1 kN or 1.5 kN depending on the type of Hexcel used. The resulting correlations between impact force, pre-impact velocity, maximum abdominal compression, and Vmax*Cmax were compared with correlations from tests with a rigid impact interface. The results of these tests showed that the probability of serious abdominal injury was unchanged by the addition of Hexcel to the impact interface, even though the peak pressures were reduced to as little as one third of their previous values. The overall abdominal injury severity was dominated by hepatic injuries which remained as severe with the Hexcel interface, although the probability of sustaining a renal laceration was three times lower with Hexcel. This study suggests that: (1) renal injury in the rabbit probably occurs at the time of peak force in the rigid impactor experiments, since the addition of Hexcel significantly reduced the number of renal lacerations . (2) the , crushing of the Hexcel caused a significant reduction in the velocity of compression as the interface loaded the kidney, and consequently the Viscous response was significantly reduced. (3) for impacts with velocity above 5 m/s, compression alone is not an adequate indicator of abdominal injury severity; the velocity of compression is also important. (4) a force-limi t-ing material for abdominal protection may require a crush force well below that of the force-limiting materials used in this study. (5) in abdominal injury studies one should measure the compression as a function of time if at all possible, but lacking that, one should measure Vmax*Cmax since it correlates well with the probability of abdominal injury.
