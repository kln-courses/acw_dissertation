<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 2Brothers of the Pure Sinhala Fraternity “By my reading, anticolonial nationalism creates its own domain of sovereignty  within colonial society well before it begins its political battle with the imperial  power,” writes Partha Chatterjee in The Nation and Its Fragments: Colonial and Post- colonial Histories. Before persons form anticolonial political movements, native in- tellectuals carve out unique spaces that Chatterjee designates the “inner domain.”  The inner domain is a realm of authentic culture that native intellectuals imagine  to remain untouched by colonialism.1 One of the main contributions of Chatterjee’s  theory is the way it assigns a new starting place—cultural reform—for conventional  histories of colonial-era nationalism, histories that customarily begin with narra- tives about anticolonial movements and battle with the imperial power. I accept the premise of the inner domain but disagree with the emphasis Chatter- jee places on intellectuals of colonized nations who create inner domains in relation  to Western hegemony. Chatterjee focuses on Bengali cultural nationalism and its  complex interaction with Western culture. But he considers Bengal, the metropolis  of the British Raj, to be representative of colonized nations.2 In this chapter I con- tinue to explore the colonial period but focus on an alternative school of scholars,  poets, and songwriters to reveal how one cultural movement in Sri Lanka sought  to define the nation, not in relation to the West but in opposition to North India. THE LINGUISTIC PURISM OF MUNIDASA   CUMARATUNGA By the early twentieth century, native elites throughout South Asia had begun to  consider their language as a spiritually unifying marker of cultural identity. As  34 </page> <page sequence="2"> Brothers of the Pure Sinhala Fraternity    35 early as 1891 Maratha nationalist B. G. Tilak campaigned to redraw boundaries of  an independent India along linguistic lines. In 1920 Mahatma Gandhi acceded his  support to create linguistic provinces for an independent India.3 Linguistic politics united the community but violently divided self from other.  Although Hindi and Urdu are structurally the same, when South Asia’s postcolo- nial era erupted with the 1947 partition of India, the devanāgarī script for Hindi and  the nasta’līq script for Urdu helped justify the creation of separate Hindu (I ndia)  and Muslim (Pakistan) nations.4 Many additional language crusades followed in  South Asia, including the Bengali Language Movement of 1952, fasts-until-death  for a separate Telugu state in 1951–52, Sinhalese mob attacks in retaliation to Tamil  resistance to the 1956 Sinhala Only language act, Fateh Singh’s fast-until-death in  1960 for a Punjabi-speaking state, agitations that divided the Bombay State along  linguistic lines into Gujarat and Maharashtra, and Tamil riots in 1965 to protest  against Hindi as the official language of India. The modern history of linguistic politics in Sri Lanka begins with Munidasa  Cumaratunga. Between 1922 and 1944 Cumaratunga sought to do for the Sinhala  language what the revivalists had attempted to accomplish for the Buddhist reli- gion. Cumaratunga believed that reforming, uplifting, and fostering loyalty for the  Sinhala language would help bring independence to the Sri Lankan nation.5 Integral to his project was the fight for linguistic purism. Cumaratunga wanted  Sinhala writers to reject all nonnative lexical items when using the native lan- guage. E. Annamalai writes that linguistic purism is caused by the “redefinition of  power relations when the social order is undergoing change.”6 In Cumaratunga’s  case, one can add that linguistic purism can influence societal change. His purist  project to remove Sanskrit and Pali influence from the Sinhala language was an  integral aspect of his efforts to construct a new school of cultural nationalism that  challenged the dominance of the Arya-Sinhala camp. In 1922 Cumaratunga resigned from his position as an inspector of Anglo-  Vernacular schools for the Department of Education. Between 1922 and 1942  he reconstructed classical works of Sinhala verse and prose. The Department of   Education approved these texts, twenty-eight in total, to be used for public exami- nations at the time.7 To reconstruct texts, Cumaratunga compared all the extant  manuscripts of a work and rewrote lines to achieve what he believed to be the  original, authentic, and “pure” version. His work reconstructing texts gave him  expertise in morphology, syntax, parsing, lexical choice, phraseology, and or- thography of authors and manuscript scribes. This expertise would help him later  fashion a pure Sinhala linguistic register—one rid of not only Sanskrit and Pali  but also Portuguese, Tamil, and English loanwords, as well as Sinhala colloquial- isms.8 During the period he reconstructed Sinhala texts he also published weekly  editorials in his newspaper Lak Mini Pahana (The gem light of Lanka) that cam- paigned to standardize Sinhala grammar, urged Sinhalese politicians to speak in their  </page> <page sequence="3"> 36    The Colonial Era mother tongue (rather than English), and advocated that Sinhala grammar should  be taught with the rigor in which English teachers taught English to Sri Lankans.9 The purist ideologies Cumaratunga brought to the study of Sinhala literature  are evident in the introduction he wrote for his commentary on the twelfth- or  eleventh-century work known as the Muvadevdāvata (Account of the Makhādeva  Jātaka): Although there are many poems composed in Sinhala, Sinhalese people consider the  most important to be Sasadāvata [Account of the Sasa Jātaka], Kavsiḷumiṇa [Crest- gem of poetry], and Muvadevdāvata [Account of the Makhādeva Jātaka]. The poetic  diction in these works is chaste because Sinhalese poets composed these works be- fore the [twelfth-century treatise on Sinhala grammar known as the] Sidatsaňgarāva  and therefore did not employ the “five transpositions” or use rhyme in two or three  places in the lines of quatrains. . . . Errors of ignorant scribes have corrupted these  works and impeded literary appreciation. . . . Scholars [like myself] who reconstruct  these texts can easily tell which errors are because of a lapse or inadvertence. We have  considered it appropriate, in the interest of young scholars, to produce a pure text of  this poem as best we can.10 In this excerpt Cumaratunga listed three factors that he believed determined  whether poetic diction was corrupt. First, it was corrupt if the linguistic register  had been subject to the “five transpositions”—five types of diachronic linguistic  change (modification in vowels, letters, words, case, and verbal conjugation) de- scribed in the twelfth-century treatise on Sinhala grammar, the Sidatsaňgarāva.  It was also corrupt if there was an excessive use of eli väṭa, the poetic technique  whereby the final syllable in each line of the quatrain ended with a like-phoneme.  Finally, it was corrupt if there were “errors resulting from the lapses of ignorant  scribes,” which referred to linguistic confusions, omissions, and additions, such as  the mix-up of similar letters, misinterpretation of contractions, errors in translat- ing words of general resemblance, wrong word combinations or punctuation, or  substitutions of synonyms.11 George Thomas outlines an eight-stage process that language reformers often  use to “purify” languages. “Recognition of need” and “identification of targets”  are the first two stages.12 One can say that Cumaratunga both recognized the need  to purify the language found in various manuscripts of the Muvadevdāvata and  identified fixable targets to produce a “pure text” of the poem. One can see later stages in the purification process in an article Cumaratunga au- thored that sparked a literary debate that came to be known as the Kukavi Vādaya,  or “Poetasters Debate.” The debate was published in the journal Swadēśamitrayā  (Friend of the nation) between June 1925 and December 1927. Out of the entire corpus of Sinhala poetry, the three works Muvadevdāvata,  Sasadāvata, and Kavsiḷumiṇa are the flowers at the summit.  .  .  . The soft words in  </page> <page sequence="4"> Brothers of the Pure Sinhala Fraternity    37 Muvadevdāvata are charming but its author had plundered meanings from the great  Sanskrit poets. We do not, therefore, bestow great respect on this work. . .  . In the  Sasadāvata there are several places influenced by Sanskrit verse, yet these instances  have only shadows of the Sanskrit words, not the exact copies. Shadows appear but  the poetic diction is not corrupt. As it is said: [Sanskrit] “The poet imitates the shad- ow of another poet’s meanings. The poetaster takes the meanings. The thief takes the  words.”13 That Cumaratunga’s language ideologies were opposed to the Arya-Sinhala prefer- ence for Sanskrit-heavy Sinhala is evident in Cumaratunga’s judgment that un- modified Sanskrit loanwords corrupted the poetic diction of pure Sinhala. He  praised the same three works mentioned in the first excerpt of this section. Yet  here he placed the Sasadāvata on a higher literary plane than the Muvadevdāvata  because the Sasadāvata contained many Sanskrit “shadows,” or tadbhavas, which  are modified Sanskrit cognates that retain a Sinhala flavor. They are different from  tatsamas, unmodified Sanskrit loanwords that Cumaratunga believed corrupted  Sinhala. Cumaratunga then alleged that Toṭagāmuve Śrī Rāhula (1408–91) did not de- serve the title of “poet” because his masterwork, the Kāvyaśēkhara (Crown of  poetry), was heavy in Sanskrit tatsamas: “The scholar who catches thieves with  their stolen goods are criticized for having a crooked mouth.  .  .  . Most Sinha- lese scholars consider the Kāvyaśēkhara more distinguished than other classi- cal poems. However, according to the Sanskrit phrase above, the author of the  Kāvyaśēkhara does not deserve the title of “poet.’ ”14 Challenging the worth of the  Kāvyaśēkhara was controversial. The Sinhalese intelligentsia held Śrī Rāhula’s  works in the utmost esteem. When Cumaratunga wrote in the excerpt, “The  scholar who catches thieves with their stolen goods are criticized for having a  crooked mouth,” he was referring to himself as the “scholar who catches thieves,”  and Toṭagāmuve Śrī Rāhula, author of Kāvyaśēkhara, as the thief. The “stolen  goods” was a reference to the Sanskrit tatsamas Śrī Rāhula used in Kāvyaśēkhara.  Cumaratunga was criticized for having a “crooked mouth” because he idiosyn- cratically filled his writings with the ä-kāraya, the third letter of the Sinhala  alphabet, which makes a “crooked” vowel sound like the “a” in “cat” pronounced  in an American accent. Cumaratunga believed that the ä-kāraya was the “purest” indigenous letter in  the Sinhala language since it does not exist in practically any other South Asian lan- guage. He revered Guruḷugōmi’s twelfth-century Amāvatura (Ambrosial water)— a narrative of incidents in the Buddha’s life—because Guruḷugōmi heavily used  the ä-kāraya letter and favored Sanskrit tadbhavas over tatsamas, which gave his  poetic diction a distinctive heḷa, or “pure,” Sinhala flavor.15 Cumaratunga and his  followers suffixed the ä-kāraya letter onto nouns to convey the genitive case, verbs  for past participles, and prepositions to create emphatic and predication markers.16 </page> <page sequence="5"> 38    The Colonial Era DECONSTRUCTING ARYA In 1941 Cumaratunga established the Heḷa Havula (Pure Sinhala Fraternity), an  organization that aimed to promote the Sinhala language and reform its modern  grammar according to the linguistic register found in Sinhala literature created  between the twelfth and seventeenth centuries. Cumaratunga and his colleagues  in the Heḷa Havula conceived of an alternative identity to the Arya-Sinhala model.  One of Cumaratunga’s closest colleagues in the Heḷa Havula was the poet Rapiyel  Tennakoon (1899–1965), who deconstructed the Arya-Sinhala identity in an ar- ticle he published in the Helio in 1941, titled “The Hidden History of the Helese”: What a shame for us Helese, to have a section of our own countrymen who believe  that they are the descendents of a gang of barbarian’s robbers [Prince Vijaya and  his retinue] from the Lata country! According to the Island-chronicles [such as the  Mahāvaṃsa] the leader of this gang of robbers was a grandson of a highway robber  who lived in a cave in the great forest region then known as ‘lata vanaya’ in South  Guzarat [sic].  .  .  . Their ships, dispersed by the storm, lost their way in the open  sea. Some of them, including the one in which the leader of the gang was on board,  reached the island of the Helese. The crew, worn out by hunger and thirst, landed  on the shore behind the jungle district, well known all over the ancient commercial  world by the [ancient] name of [Sri Lanka,] Tommanna.17 Here Tennakoon challenged the heroic portrayals of Prince Vijaya championed  by the Arya-Sinhala revivalists, disgraced Vijaya as a leader of a gang of barbarous  robbers, rejected the belief that the Sinhalese were descendants of Vijaya, and sug- gested that the Sinhalese (the “Helese”) were already on the island when Vijaya  and his retinue arrived. Tennakoon also attempted to deconstruct the Arya-Sinhala identity by criti- cally tracing the term Arya in scholarly discourse: According to our modern writers, these Vadakkayas [Harassers] [sic] were the first  Aryan settlers of the Helese island. I do not know what they mean by the word  “ Aryan.” The Buddhist literature says that “Aryans” are those who had attained to the  noble eight-fold path. But we cannot believe that our modern writers mean the same  sin-proof holy beings by the recently coined word Aryan. The scholars who wanted to mention all the groups of the northern band of the  fair-skinned human race in the world as a single family used the word Aryan, which  is a word coined very recently in a German mint without taking into consideration  that the very same name existed in ancient Indian literature to express quite a dif- ferent meaning. But soon they saw that the word Aryan did not give a wider sense  than that given by the ancient word “ariya.” As the scope they wanted to cover by the  meaning of the word Aryan grew wider they felt the want of a new word for the pur- pose. Then the scholars began to use the newly coined compound word Indo-Aryan.  This new treatment made the patient more ill instead of curing him, for ancient  “Aryans” were especially Indians. Then the scholars coined another compound word  </page> <page sequence="6"> Brothers of the Pure Sinhala Fraternity    39 “Indo-Germanic” to give a still wider sense than that given by the former one. But  the meaning they wanted to express by that word began to spread beyond its circle.18 “German mint” most likely referred to Max Müller’s popularization of the concept  of the “Arya” race. This idea fed into German linguist Wilhelm Geiger’s widely  praised linguistic studies (1897, 1899) that established the Sinhala language’s Indo- Aryan roots. Geiger’s linguistic categorization of Indo-Aryan further established  the belief that the origins of the Sinhalese were North Indian, a belief shared by the  Arya-Sinhala nationalists but fought against by the members of the Heḷa Havula. CUMARATUNGA’S  HEḶA MĪYÄSIYA In 1942 Cumaratunga published Heḷa Mīyäsiya (Sinhala music). He intended to  publish three additional volumes that treated rhythm and Sinhalese percussion  instruments, but he passed away in 1944 at the age of fifty-three. Heḷa Mīyäsiya was  a violin self-study manual, a collection of patriotic lyrics Cumaratunga wrote in  the purist Sinhala, and a treatise that created theoretical foundations for a national  system of music based on the singing of Sinhala poetry. Thomas delineates two types of linguistic purism. “Offensive purism” attempts  to force a radical departure from traditional usage. “Defensive purism” strives to  stop the use of undesirable development.19 Cumaratunga’s post-1939 diction, which  commenced with his publication of the Subasa (Good language) journal and was  in full form in Heḷa Mīyäsiya, was of the “offensive” type. It radically  departed  from common usage in the way it removed unmodified Sanskrit, Pali, English,  Tamil, and Portuguese loanwords; employed the ä-kāraya; and introduced idio- syncratic purist replacements. Thomas defines “replacement” as the provision of an acceptable alternative to  undesirable linguistic elements.20 Replacement is the sixth stage in Thomas’s lan- guage purification process. The word mīyäsiya, found in the book’s title, is one  such replacement. Cumaratunga coined the term as an alternative for sangīta, the  Sanskrit word for “music.” Mi- means sweet or pleasant, and -äsiya denotes some- thing heard, thus mīyäsiya literally means “sweet sound.”21 In his introduction to  Heḷa Mīyäsiya Cumaratunga ridiculed the Sinhalese composers who studied clas- sical music in North India and thought little of Sinhala music traditions: “When  you mention ‘Heḷa music,’ a large group gathers around. These are the people who  have studied singing and instrumental music in North India. They scoff, ‘What  vocal music do the Sinhalese have? What instrumental music? Sinhalese singing is  like the lament we hear at funerals. What is Sinhalese instrumental music except  the unpleasant thunderous sound of the bera drum [the traditional Sinhalese dou- ble-headed drum] that should be removed from the temple on Poya [the Buddhist  holidays that occur on a full moon day] and even from hell itself!’ ”22 </page> <page sequence="7"> 40    The Colonial Era Cumaratunga also criticized composers who imitated the style of the first Asian  Nobel laureate, Rabindranath Tagore: “Another shameful thing they do is to com- pose songs in the style of people like Rabindranath Tagore. What do our compos- ers do? They listen to this type of song and imitate its meter and words and then  trick all the foolish people who swoon.”23 Because Cumaratunga desired to free Sri  Lanka from Indian cultural influence, he bestowed new Sinhala-language names  onto the standard Indian terms for musical notes (sa, re, ga, ma, pa, da, ni). He  designated the seven natural notes as si, ri, gi, mi, pi, di, ni and the sharp fourth  as mu, and he used his favorite letter the ä-kāraya to name the flat second, third,  sixth, and seventh as rä, gä, dä, and nä.24 Cumaratunga’s critique of Sinhalese composers who believed in the superiority  of North Indian music was connected to his attempt to reinterpret the Mahāvaṃsa,  which claimed that the Sinhalese were originally from North India. As stated ear- lier, according to the chronicle, the Sinhalese had descended from the North Indian  prince Vijaya in the fifth century b.c.e. Cumaratunga argued that the real roots of the  Sinhalese were with the “Heḷas,” the indigenous islanders whom Vijaya conquered.  Yet Cumaratunga also looked to the Mahāvaṃsa chronicle for evidence of an ancient  Sinhalese musical tradition untouched by India. He wrote this in the introduction to  Heḷa Mīyäsiya: “After covering the Heḷa girl traitor named Kuveni with a cloth, Vijaya,  the leader of the thieves, crept closer to the Heḷa abode. What were the Heḷas doing?  They were pleasing their minds with singing, playing, and dancing. One would think  Vijaya’s heart softened from hearing such sweetness. But the Heḷas danced, sang, and  played instruments not knowing that Vijaya would soon murder them.”25 Cumara- tunga here referred to an episode narrated in the Mahāvaṃsa: Prince Vijaya could  conquer the indigenous islanders because Kuveni the Heḷa queen betrayed her own  kin, the “Heḷas.” After spending a night with Kuveni, Vijaya heard sounds of music  and singing foreign to him. He asked, “What does this noise mean?” Kuveni replied  that the music was for a seven-day Heḷa wedding festival taking place in the city Siri- savatthu.26 Vijaya and his retinue then went to Sirisavatthu, vanquished the Heḷas,  and began to rule ancient Lanka. Cumaratunga believed that this very story in the  Mahāvaṃsa gave evidence of an indigenous Sinhalese musical tradition. Many of Cumaratunga’s songs in Heḷa Mīyäsiya expressed the slogans of the  Heḷa Havula. For example, this song lyric championed Cumaratunga’s “triple gem”  campaign that valorized the Sinhala country, nation, and language: For any country, except my country, the Heḷa country For any nation, except my nation, the Heḷa nation For any language, except my language, I will never bow my head, I will never bow my head27 In the early twentieth century the motto of Arya-Sinhala nationalism had been  “country, nation, and religion.” Cumaratunga replaced religion with language.  </page> <page sequence="8"> Brothers of the Pure Sinhala Fraternity    41 Sandagomi Coperahewa writes that this replacement “reflects the growing impor- tance of the language factor in Sinhala nationalism and politics in the late 1930s.”28  Indeed, between 1932 and 1942 Sinhalese politicians presented resolutions to the  State Council to use Sinhala and Tamil, rather than English, in debates of the  council and in the administration of justice. Although Cumaratunga had no contact with the reformers of music and lan- guage in Tamil Nadu, his interpretation of Sinhalese origins, ideologies of linguis- tic purism, and musicological treatise paralleled the contemporaneous language  and music movements in Tamil Nadu. Cumaratunga’s conviction that the Sin- halese were not descendants of North Indians but originally indigenous island- ers of Lanka inspired him to rename the Indian musical tones with Sinhala note  names. Similarly, a pioneer of the Tamil music movement, Abraham Pandithar  (1859–1919), created a body of exclusively Tamil music theory. Pandithar’s music  theory was based on his belief in the existence of the lost continent of Lemuria,  wherefrom all Tamil speakers were said to have originated.29 Further, both Cumaratunga and the founder of the Tamil purist movement,  Maraimalai Adigal (1876–1950), rejected their respective ethnic groups’ putative  Aryan roots. They based this refutation on what they believed to be the inher- ent uniqueness of the Tamil and Sinhala languages and each language’s autonomy  from Sanskrit. Both Cumaratunga and Adigal were not of high caste. One may  infer that their positions as rural elites and to some degree “subalterns” in relation  to the high castes affected their outlook in some way. Cumaratunga, however, did  not publicly seek to empower the lower castes, as Adigal did in his Non-Brahmin  Manifesto.30 Despite these commonalities between music and language reform in Sri Lanka  and Tamil Nadu, the Sinhalese and Sri Lankan–Tamils became increasingly po- larized within Sri Lanka in the 1940s. Tamil culture had deeply influenced early  twentieth-century Sinhala gramophone music, nineteenth-century Sinhala drama  (nāḍagam), and eighteenth-century Sinhala court song (vannama). Yet exclusory  language policies in Sri Lanka in the 1940s began to create a conspicuous lack of  cultural dialogue between the Sinhalese and the Tamils in Sri Lanka and India. In  1943, a year before Cumaratunga passed away, Sinhalese politicians enacted the  first resolution to make Sinhala the only official language of the state. From a wider vantage point, one might consider Cumaratunga’s language loy- alty as a Sri Lankan case of the large-scale shift in South Asia from language-as- medium to language-as-marker of ethnic identity. Sumathi Ramaswamy and Lisa  Mitchell detail the way the Tamil and Telugu languages of South India came to con- stitute a defining characteristic of Tamil and Telugu individuals in the t wentieth  century.31 Like the Tamil and Telugu language reformers whose campaigns con- tributed to this shift, Cumaratunga created a unique inner domain of Sinhalese  ethnic identity with the Sinhala language at its heart. </page> <page sequence="9"> 42    The Colonial Era Through the organization of the Heḷa Havula and publications like Heḷa  Mīyäsiya, Cumaratunga impressed on poets and songwriters the importance  of his purist project of reform. The task of the remainder of this chapter is to  come to terms with the way in which Cumaratunga exerted influence on the  poetry of Rapiyel Tennakoon and songs of Sunil Santha, two members of the  Heḷa Havula. BAT LANGUAGE In 1927 Cumaratunga was appointed principal of the teacher’s training college in  Nittambuwe. There he befriended Rapiyel Tennakoon, the history and geography  instructor.32 Tennakoon joined Cumaratunga’s Heḷa Havula in 1942 and presided  as president between 1949 and 1965.33 Tennakoon read Cumaratunga’s Virit Vä- kiya (Treatise on Sinhala poetic meters, 1938) and began to compose verse in the  metered style prescribed by this book.34 In two years Tennakoon had completed  eleven long-metered poems, four of which comprised more than one thousand  quatrains apiece. Impressed, Cumaratunga published three of Tennakoon’s long poems for Cu- maratunga’s book series Ruvan Väla (Chain of gems). Cumaratunga used the Ru- van Väla series to exclusively publish poetry by members of the Heḷa Havula. The  series had commenced in 1936 with Cumaratunga’s autobiographical long poem  Piya Samara (Remembering Father). Tennakoon’s poems were satirical and po- lemical. In Hävilla (The curse, 1940), he lampooned zealous religious practices,  and in Dǟ Vinaya (Discipline of the nation, 1941) he satirized corrupt politics.35 The poetry written by members of the Heḷa Havula diverged in three ways from  the style of the first-generation Colombo poets. First, the Heḷa Havula poets wrote  in an erudite literary language that bordered on cryptic, a style that radically de- viated from the easily understandable language of the Colombo poets. Second,  they used a more expanded repertoire of meters. The Colombo poets wrote mostly  sivpada (quatrains), with end-rhyme (eli väṭa) and an equal amount of mātrā (syl- labic instants) per line. Yet Tennakoon favored gī meters, quatrains with uneven  amounts of mātrā.36 Gī was a meter common to Sinhala poetic works composed  between the twelfth and seventeenth century, like the Sasadāvata, Muvadevdā,  and Kavsiḷumiṇa. Because Tennakoon, along with his brothers in the Heḷa Havula,  held these literary works in esteem, he was inclined to use gī meters. Third, Heḷa  Havula poets appended commentaries onto their works of poetry. The Colombo  poets did not append commentaries on their poems because the common reader  could understand the meaning. Detailed exegesis, by contrast, was necessary for  the Heḷa Havula poets, since they employed an arcane lexicon and commented on  myths, current events, and biographical details through slight allusions, some of  which could seem like inside jokes. </page> <page sequence="10"> Figure 2. “Siya Bas Vaḍuvō” (Developers of the native language), Subasa (1941): 61. Clockwise  from top left: Rapiyel Tennakoon, Jayamaha Vellala, Ven. Warakagoda Silruwan, and Aryasena  Anshuboda (who later changed his name to “Arisen Ahubudu”). </page> <page sequence="11"> 44    The Colonial Era The Heḷa Havula poets, some of whose pictures were featured in a 1941 issue of  Cumaratunga’s Subasa (fig. 2), adopted for their exegesis the precise format that  Sinhala literary scholars used to interpret classical Sinhala literature. In the anvaya  (word order), the commentator put the quatrain into sentence syntax. In the vis- tara or padyartha (description, meaning), the scholar explained the content. The  ṭippaṇi (gloss) followed with an analysis of challenging terms or phrases. It is against the background of Cumaratunga’s Heḷa Havula movement that  Tennakoon’s first poetic work, Vavuluva (Bat language, 1939), holds significance.  It was a long narrative poem that comprised 551 quatrains. Because Cumaratunga  was enamored with this poem, he wrote a long introduction to Vavuluva that ana- lyzed the work’s aesthetics and characters. Cumaratunga claimed that Vavuluva  could win a Nobel Prize if translated into English.37 One may conclude that Tennakoon wrote Vavuluva for two principal reasons.  The first was to rewrite anti–Sri Lankan scenes in the Indian Ramayana epic. This  becomes evident when one considers the narrative of the poem. Vavuluva re- volved around a conversation between a male bat, Vavula, and female drongo bird,  Käviḍiya. Tennakoon may have gravitated toward fables because Cumaratunga  had used anthropomorphic animal characters to criticize society in his fable-like  Magul Käma (The wedding feast) and Hin Säraya (The subtle attack).38 Both Vavula and Käviḍiya have a long Sinhalese ancestry that they trace back to  ancient tribes in India and Sri Lanka. The two meet in the evening, when Käviḍiya’s  husband is late to return home (vv. 1–21). After Käviḍiya tells Vavula about her  distinguished family lineage (vv. 22–45), Vavula reveals that one of his ancestors  lived in the castle garden of Sita’s father (Sita is the heroine of the Ramayana).  This ancestor was later exiled to the south of India, where Rama (the hero of the   Ramayana) and Lakshmana (Rama’s brother) lived (vv. 55–59). Readers of Vavuluva gained a different perspective on two Sri Lankan charac- ters of the Ramayana: Ravana and his sister Surpanakha. Tennakoon attempted  to redeem Surpanakha’s character. In the standard version of Valmiki’s Ramayana,  Ravana’s sister Surpanakha is an evil woman who attempts to seduce Rama and his  brother Lakshmana. After the brothers reject Surpanakha’s advances, she attempts  to kill Sita, but Lakshmana cuts off her ears and nose. Conversely, in Vavuluva,  Surpanakha is a “beautiful” (rūmat, v. 61) and “friendly woman” (yeheliyak, v. 64).  She does not flirt with Rama and Lakshmana; they crudely speak to her (vv. 65–70). Tennakoon also tried to redeem the character of Ravana. In the standard Ra- mayana, Ravana tricks Rama and Lakshmana, abducts Sita to Sri Lanka, and de- mands she marry him. In Tennakoon’s Valuvuva, Sita wants to go to Sri Lanka to  meet Ravana, the great king of Sri Lanka (v. 78). When she is in Sri Lanka, Ravana  valiantly protects her (vv. 110–24).39 The second reason Tennakoon seems to have written Vavuluva was to criticize  and satirize the Royal Asiatic Society’s Sinhala dictionary project, especially their  </page> <page sequence="12"> Brothers of the Pure Sinhala Fraternity    45 hire of linguist Wilhelm Geiger.40 The very title of the poem was a humorous allu- sion to this project. To create the word “Vavuluva” Tennakoon combined the Sin- hala word for bat (vavula) with the suffix -uva. The suffix -uva is found in the word  eluva, which designates “pure or ancient Sinhala language.” By combining vavula  and uva, Tennakoon meant to convey the meaning “bat language.”41 One year before Tennakoon published Vavuluva, the German linguist Wilhelm  Geiger published A Grammar of the Sinhala Language (1938). The Sinhalese intel- ligentsia knew of Geiger because of earlier seminal articles he published about  etymologies of roughly two thousand Sinhala words (1896, 1897). The Sinhalese  intelligentsia, except for the members of the Heḷa Havula, had accepted Geiger’s  argument that the Sinhalese language had Indo-Aryan origins.42 Geiger and the dictionary’s chief editor, Sir D. B. Jayatilake, had launched the dic- tionary project in 1926. It progressed at a snail’s pace: part 1 of the first volume was  published in 1935. The slow pace prompted Cumaratunga to publish a public letter in  the Helio, the English-language journal of the Heḷa Havula. Cumaratunga volunteered  his services to complete the dictionary in two years.43 He was frustrated because the  dictionary project was put under the guidance of Geiger, a foreign scholar who he  felt sorely lacked in Sinhala fluency. To vent his frustration, Cumaratunga authored  thirteen sardonic letters of criticism, published in both Sinhala and English, about  Geiger’s A Grammar of the Sinhala Language. In the ninth criticism, Cumaratunga  attacked the credibility of Geiger’s work and the new field of comparative philology.  Geiger, Cumaratunga wrote, did not even know the basic pronouns in Sinhala: To Prof. Geiger ta [ē] and fya [hē] means “he” “she” or “it.” This must indeed have  come as a result of some mysterious and rigid process of highly “scientific” research.   ́ [o] and fya [hē] in Sinhala is equal to “she” in English! It will be ridiculous to argue  to the contrary. One who knows the Sinhala language will require no argument at all  to be convinced that it is absolutely untrue to say that ta [ē] and fya [hē] means “she,”  and those whose limited knowledge of Sinhalese requires the thick cover “Compara- tive Philology” to protect it from the atmosphere, will never come out of their forti- fied shelter to face any kind of argument.44 In addition to these criticisms, Cumaratunga authored in English three “Open  Appeals” in the Heḷa Havula journal Subasa to Sir D. B. Jayatilake as well as to the  chair of the dictionary managing committee and the minister of education. In his  appeal to the chair he wrote, Professor Geiger, the Great Authority of the Dictionary, does not know Sinhalese.  His great Grammar, produced with the help of Mr. Julius de Lanerolle, clearly shows  how lamentably defective his knowledge of Comparative Philology is so far at least  as it deals with the Sinhalese language. A Dictionary compiled under the direction of  such a doubtful authority can hardly be satisfactory however long may be the period  it takes to materialize. </page> <page sequence="13"> 46    The Colonial Era To one who is already well-versed in the language, who needs not run from this  end to the other end of the island to learn the etymology of one small word, who  need not make a forced display of his erudition by coming out in the public over and  over again with the etymology of a single word, that too unearthed by someone else,  two years is quite ample to complete the most comprehensive Sinhalese Dictionary.45 In the twenty-seventh chapter of Vavuluva Tennakoon lampooned the dictionary  project and sought to discredit Geiger’s scholarship on the Sinhala language: Chapter 27. The Arrangement of the Bat-Language Dictionary [Vavula:] The assembly gathered To protect the Buddhist order But commenced [instead] The compilation of the Bat-language dictionary Everyone in the group Examined the state of Bat-language And then entrusted The job of remedying the language to me. Therefore, on the following day I brought together All the Bat-language books And all the scholars of those books. My head was like the handle of a manual drill. It turned in one direction when reading these books, And in jerked in another when confronted With what scholars said about these works. (vv. 466–69)46 Jayanta Weerasekara’s commentary on stanza 469 sheds light on the meaning of  the phrase “head like a manual drill”: “Glossary: 1. burumayeka miṭa vilasin: ‘bu- rumaya’ is a manual machine to drill wood. To penetrate the wood one turns the  handle of the drill in one direction and then in another. Tennakoon says that Va- vula’s head is like the motion of the handle of this manual drill. When Vavula reads  books in the Bat-Language his mind and head move in a focused direction. Yet,  when he reads the discourse of scholars on these works his head jerks in another  direction [because he is outraged at what they say].”47 Tennakoon’s intention, then,  was to wryly criticize foreign scholarship written about the Sinhala language, like  Geiger’s etymological studies, because Tennakoon believed these studies spread  misinformation about the Sinhala language.48 It seems most likely that the character of the bat in Vavuluva was a satirical  portrayal of the dictionary’s chief editor, Sir D. B. Jayatilake, or at least of the mem- bers of the dictionary project who chose a foreign over a native scholar. As Jayanta  Weerasekara’s commentary for Vavuluva in stanzas 513–14 disclosed: “These two  </page> <page sequence="14"> Brothers of the Pure Sinhala Fraternity    47 stanzas reveal a surprising character trait of Vavula. He does not wish for his neigh- bors’ help as long as he is alive. However talented his neighbors are he does not like  to consult them. But he happily takes help from people from far away.”49 Cumara- tunga echoed this sentiment in his introduction to Vavuluva: “Käviḍiya inquires  about Vavula’s journey to Bintenne: ‘Why Bintenne? Can’t you learn about your  own language from your own people?’ No, no. Vavula likes to get help from for- eigners much more than from his fellow countrymen. . . . Should not the fact that  local scholars are willing to give help from the bottom of their hearts influence the  bat to accept their offers? Alas, Vavula likes to worship foreigners . . . and would  rather die than seek assistance from local scholars to complete a dictionary.”50 PURISM AND THE MUSICAL SPHERE Munidasa Cumaratunga did not only inspire poets. Cumaratunga also filled one  songwriter with the desire to compose song that would make the members of the  Heḷa Havula proud. In 1934 Rabindranath Tagore staged his opera Shapmochan  (Curse redeemed) in Sri Lanka to critical acclaim. Inspired, a young Sinhalese  Catholic teacher of music and drama named Baddeliyanage Joseph John persuad- ed his brother for a loan to study music at Tagore’s school, Santiniketan. Joseph  John raised more money by staging a performance of a Sinhala-language adap- tation of Shakespeare’s Hamlet. In 1939 he traveled to Bengal to commence his  studies. He trained for a year in North Indian classical voice, sitar, and orchestration  and in Tagore’s musical genre known as rabindrasangit. Joseph John then decided  to pursue a more rigorous study of North Indian classical music. He secured fi- nancial aid from the Ceylon government and traveled to Lucknow to focus on  Hindustani voice and sitar at the prestigious Marris College of Music.51 In the mid-twentieth century many Sinhalese Christians changed their angli- cized names to Sinhala names. Around 1940 Joseph John adopted the stage name  of “Sunil Shanti.”52 He later adjusted his name to “Sunil Santha.” In 1944 he scored  the highest marks in the first division sitar class, completed a bachelor’s degree in  music, and returned to Sri Lanka. The principal of the Marris College of Music,  S. N. Ratanjankar, authored a letter of recommendation on behalf of Santha. Back home, Santha’s uncle, Father Moses Perera, gave Santha a temporary place  to lodge. Father Perera was a member of the Heḷa Havula. He introduced Santha  to Cumaratunga’s writings. Santha began to feel that Indian music prevented Sri  Lankan composers from creating a national musical genre. Santha wrote this about his experience reading Munidasa Cumaratunga: While in North India I transformed into a North Indian in my dress, language, cus- toms, ideas, and every other facet. . . . Even when I was back in Sri Lanka, I behaved  as though I were still in North India. I felt proud to forget all my Sinhalese ways and  </page> <page sequence="15"> 48    The Colonial Era act like this. When singing Sinhala songs, I would pronounce the words as though  they were Hindi words. I considered the Hindi accenting of Sinhala words to be a  great thing. In short, in every single activity I pushed my Sinhalese identity away and  brought forward North Indian ways of being. One day I directed my attention to a few Sinhala verses. I read them once, twice,  and a third time. I knew the verses contained an important idea.  .  .  . I felt trans- formed within. The stanzas that really penetrated my heart are these: “On account of my country and nation If I were I to go to war and kill enemies And lose my life thereof Will not my glory live for a hundred years? If one lives confined in a stone cave His life and name will never last Sacrifice that life to the country and nation Preserve your honor and remain undefeated May I never see a Heḷaya [a Sinhalese person] Two-footed but not doing any service Working earnestly for the good of country and nation Forget life’s cravings for a moment”53 Santha read these three stanzas in Cumaratunga’s Heḷa Mīyäsiya and felt pu- rified of what he called his “Hindustani-ness”: “I searched for other writings  penned by this meritorious hand [Munidasa Cumaratunga]. Having found  them, I read with great pleasure. This writer was successful in destroying all  my useless ideas. I turned in a completely different direction. I felt that my  ‘Hindustani-ness’ left me and went all the way back to India for good. Today  there is nothing more important than my language, nation, and country.54  Transformed, Santha now espoused Cumaratunga’s motto of “language, nation,  country” (basa, desa, räsa). The earliest reference one finds in regard to Santha’s active involvement in the  Heḷa Havula may be March 2, 1946. That day Santha sang the commemoration song  at the ceremony for the second death anniversary of Cumaratunga. Santha had set a  melody to a poem titled “Cumāratungu Samaru Gīya” (Cumaratunga commemora- tion song), composed by Heḷa Havula poet Amarasiri Gunavadu. The poem resist- ed easy comprehension due to its purist poetic lexicon. Consider this translation: He had a might of intellect and devoted his life to the Triple Gem He thrilled the hearts of all and made formidable enemies into cotton that wafts in  the air He showed the way of great seers, this God of Heḷa, our “Gem” Munidasa   Cumaratunga We will put your advice to use without rest and commemorate you every day55 </page> <page sequence="16"> Brothers of the Pure Sinhala Fraternity    49 Here, the “triple gems” again referred to Cumaratunga’s slogan of “language, na- tion, country.” SANTHA’S  “ŌLU PIPĪLĀ,”  LITERARY GRAMMAR,   AND MUSICAL STYLE In 1946 Santha released his breakthrough hit “Ōlu Pipīlā” (The lilies have blos- somed). He composed the lyrics and music and performed as the solo vocalist.  The song became the first song that the Sri Lankan radio station Radio Ceylon,  recorded onto a record.56 “Ōlu Pipīlā” told a story about a young man courting a  girl, Mala, near a village pond. O sister, the lilies, whiter than white, have blossomed and sway in  the field O sister, fair-skinned maiden, shall I pluck them and weave a flower  garland for you? Come in the water Mala and give me your hand We’ll cut the flowers, weave garlands, and adorn ourselves57 Santha’s lyrics evoked a lush village scene through the usage of definite articles, such  as chains of kūnis fish and swaying white lotus flowers. He placed the refrain in the  last line of each stanza: “We’ll cut the flowers, weave garlands, and adorn ourselves”: O sister, the unbroken chains of fish play lovingly O sister, the kūnis fish go jumping as if we have called them Mala, here is the flower I picked for you. This one is yours. We’ll cut the flowers, weave garlands, and adorn ourselves O sister, I am ashamed to be defeated by your hands O sister, don’t be in such a rush, let’s wade slowly in the water and  pick lily flowers Mala, with the whiteness of the flowers on your body, you become  more stunning We’ll cut the flowers, weave garlands, and adorn ourselves O sister, we have plucked and picked and now the flowers are heavy  in our hands O sister, let’s go put them on the top of the mountain Mala, your younger brother is coming, let’s go quickly We’ll cut the flowers, weave garlands, and adorn ourselves58 The poetic quality of the song text in “Ōlu Pipīlā” could be said to reside in the  lexical and phonemic parallelism. Take the famous first stanza and consider the  careful attention Santha gave to repetition, assonance, and alliteration: </page> <page sequence="17"> 50    The Colonial Era ōlu pipīlā vela leḷa denavā sudaṭa sudē naňgō ōlu neḷālā māla gotālā denna da sudu naňgō ennä diyē bäsä mā hā dennä obē ata mālā ōlu neḷālā māla gotālā palaňdimu api mālā At the start of lines 1, 2, and 4, Santha uses the word ōlu (lilies). He places the word  naňgō (sister) at the end of the first two lines. In lines 2 and 4, he repeats the entire  phrase of ōlu nel ̣āḷā māla gotālā (weave lotus and make garlands). He also employs  vowel assonance in vela lela denavā (shaking in the pond), nelālā māla gotālā  (weave and make garlands), and in the third line: ennä diyē bäsä mā hā dennä obē ata mālā Cumaratunga, one may infer, would have approved of the way Santha’s song text  in “Ōlu Pipīlā” employed subject-object agreement found in literary Sinhala. Cu- maratunga had believed that standardizing a more literary grammar was an essen- tial requirement for a śiṣṭa, or “cultured” society. Cumaratunga, Sandagomi Cop- erahewa writes, “used metaphors of law and society to define the relationship of  grammar to language.”59 Consider this revealing statement made by Cumaratunga  in 1938: “Just like a society without laws, a language without laws will plunge into  confusion. The Sinhala language is facing a disaster. A course of action to prevent  this is immediately called for. . . . [A standardized] grammar is utterly necessary  for a cultured society.”60 Taking these campaigns to heart, Santha employed in “Ōlu Pipīlā” the rare fu- ture tense (neuter/masculine and plural) suffix, -ō (- ́), for conjugating the verb  root yana (go) into “yannō.”61 Kūnissō uḍa pänä pänä yannō apa kändavā naňgō [Sister, the  kunisso fish go jumping as if they have called us]62 One finds another rare future-tense conjugation in Santha’s song “Haňda Pānē” (In  the moonlight, 1947). He used the feminine future-tense suffix, -ī (B), for conjugat- ing the root näla- (to be lulled, to sway) into “nälävennī.” ambiliyō kiyamin nälävennī [She sways back and forth, singing,   O Moon!]63 As with the previous example, this was a literary form that lyricists tended to not  include in gramophone or radio songs. In addition, Santha, like the Heḷa Havula  poets, added an ä-kāraya letter to words like pänä pänä (go jumping), nälävennī  (she sways), and bäbälena (shining), which gave his lyrics a pure-Sinhala touch. Santha believed that his song lyrics with proper literary grammar could put  the Sinhalese English-educated elite back in touch with their mother tongue. In  the introduction to his songbook Sunil Hanḍa (Sunil’s voice, 1947), he remarked, </page> <page sequence="18"> Brothers of the Pure Sinhala Fraternity    51 Figure 3. Sunil Santha’s “Ōlu Pipeelā,” in Sunil Santha: Song Folio (Rajagiriya: Santha, 1948), 3.  Courtesy of Lanka Santha. Those assimilated to Western food and drink, clothing, customs and habits, etc.,  have driven our language into the kitchen. These people are ashamed to talk in their  mother tongue. . . . Some of them joke and say, “This is Sinhalese music.” They then  start to imitate päl kavi [hut poetry], karatta kavi [cart poetry], sivpada [sung qua- trains], and vannama. . . . I find our current situation quite upsetting. This is why I  brought out [my first songbook] Ridī Valāva. Must I say anything about the service  I have rendered through the songs like “Ōlu Pipīlā” and “Haňda Pāne”? Those who  gagged from distaste from the Sinhala language and gave prominence to English now  happily sing these lyrics. Now they will familiarize themselves with songs in their  mother tongue. This is one of the goals of my new music.64 </page> <page sequence="19"> 52    The Colonial Era He would later print two songbooks with English titles—Sunil Santha Song Folio  (1948) and Song of Lanka (1950)—especially for the Westernized Sinhalese elite in  Colombo. Because many members of high society had studied Western classical  music, Santha transcribed the songs in Western notation. Instead of transliterating  his songs into English script, he printed Sinhala script under the notation (fig. 3).  It is striking to note how he used Western notation to appeal to the tastes of this  class, yet simultaneously refamiliarized them with “songs in their mother tongue”  by using the Sinhala script rather than a transliteration. Just as Cumaratunga sought to remove North Indian influence from the Sin- hala language, Santha greatly rid his songs of North Indian musical influences.65  In his book Dēśiya Sangīta (National music), Santha lashed out against Sinha- lese musicians who sang Hindustani music. He contemptuously labeled them  Sinhalastankārayō, or “ ‘Sinhalastan’ [Sinhalese + Hindustan] crowd”: “There is a  reason why [Sri Lankan] national music and music education is bitter like a poi- sonous kaduru nut. There is a reason why everyone who trains in Indian classi- cal music transforms into a Hindustani person and feels that our national music  should be Hindustani music: these people have no affection, consideration, or love  for their language, nation, or country.”66  Santha had studied classical Indian vocal music and scored the highest marks  in the first division sitar class at Marris College. Yet his music had a marked ab- sence of Indian musical ornamentation. Sunil Ariyaratne emphasizes the influ- ence of Santha’s Catholic upbringing on his musical style: “Sunil Santha’s voice was  trained from childhood in Catholic music of the Church. . . . His voice sounded  new to Sinhala music connoisseurs. It was uniquely different from vocalists like  Sadiris de Silva, H. W. Rupasinghe, Don Manis Pattiarachche, N. Romlas de Silva,  and even Ananda Samarakoon. These musicians who trained in North India used  all the ornamentations like kan svara and meend found in Hindustani classical  music. . . . Sunil Santha rarely used these ornamentations. He moved straight from  note to note. He also pronounced the words better than the other Sinhalese musi- cians who trained in North India.”67 D. P. M. Weerakkody, however, stresses the  impact of Cumaratunga: “Sunil Santha was influenced not only by Cumaratunga’s  linguistic style and philosophy but also Cumaratunga’s views on music. Although  at a later date Santha criticized the limitations of Cumaratunga’s Heḷa Mīyäsiya,  initially the book appears to have made some impact on Santha. According to Jay- antha Aravinda. . . . This impact explains the simplicity of many of Sunil Santha’s  melodies and the predominance of natural [unornamented] notes in them.”68 Santha’s compositions may also be said to typify what ethnomusicologist  Thomas Turino has termed “modernist reform”: reform of local arts based on  “ cosmopolitan” aesthetics, ethics, and worldviews.69 Modernist reform describes  the way in which musicians must maintain a unique local identity on the interna- tional scene. Santha’s songs, very popular among the Sinhalese English-educated  </page> <page sequence="20"> Brothers of the Pure Sinhala Fraternity    53 elite, also appealed to the British on the island, because of his song’s Western har- monies and catchy melodies. For example, Joan Eleanor Ramsbotham, daughter of  the Ceylon governor general Herwald Ramsbotham, praised Santha’s songs “Ōlu  Pipīlā,” “Kōkile Nāde” (The cuckoo bird’s song), and “Haňda Pānē” in a personal  letter sent to Santha in June 1951.70 If we succinctly describe Santha’s early compo- sitional style, it would be that he set simple yet clever and catchy melodies based  in Western harmonies to poetic Sinhala song texts.71 These melodies are predomi- nantly written in the major scale, accompanied by I, IV, and V harmonies set in 4/4  meters and performed by the upright bass and acoustic guitar. SANTHA AND TENNAKOON’S “DUDAN’ODA BIŇDA” Santha’s Cumaratunga-style rejection of North Indian influences caused a con- troversy in 1952. In April Radio Ceylon rehired S. N. Ratanjankar—Santha’s for- mer principal at the Marris College of Music—to audition and grade Sinhalese  musicians for radio posts. Ratanjankar had already visited the island once to  audition musicians in 1949.72 Santha boycotted the 1952 auditions and later con- troversially quit his post as an A-grade musician. During this time he wrote in  protest to the Lankādīpa newspaper. In one article Santha expressed anger at  station officials who refused to support local talent. Santha’s complaints were  similar to those that Tennakoon made in Vavuluva with regard to the officials  who refused to hire Cumaratunga to edit the Sinhala dictionary. Santha felt that  hiring Ratanjankar was a repeat of the Geiger controversy that Tennakoon lam- pooned in the final chapter of Vavuluva. Santha argued, “I do not believe that we  should wish for a foreigner to come to Sri Lanka to advise us on how to create  a national music just because we brought a German to advise us on the Sinhala  language.”73 By this time Santha and Rapiyel Tennakoon had released their new song,  “Dudan’oda Biňda” (Kill this cruel creep). Tennakoon had originally published the  text in the second chapter of his second long poem Hävilla. In the poem Tenna- koon narrated the plight of a helpless village woman and satirized her fanatical  religious practices. In the second chapter a thief steals the hens of the poor village  woman, leaving her unable to earn a living. She makes a pilgrimage to the town of  Kataragama and curses the man. She pleads with the god Kataragama to avenge  the crime and destroy the criminal. Santha set music to this emotional scene. Tennakoon’s poetic verses from Hävilla are found in every compilation of mod- ern Sinhala poetry that I have come across. One reason for the poem’s popularity is  that Tennakoon fashioned a unique poetic meter that oscillated between quatrains  of six and twelve mātrā (syllabic instants). Another reason for the poem’s success is  the way it teemed with rhyme and alliteration, particularly with the dayanna letter  “o” (/d/), which I have set in bold font in the transliteration. These poetics helped  </page> <page sequence="21"> 54    The Colonial Era to intensify the woman’s feelings of desperation, hatred for the man that destroyed  her livelihood, and devotion to the god Kataragama. du da no’da biňda baňda teda kaňda kaňda dev rada sāminē mage kukulā näsū ekā dadaya obage pālu yakā tava eka buda dinak takā innaṭa iḍa no dī makā [Kill this cruel creep O splendorous wondrous King, Lord Kataragama! This bugger has destroyed my hens And plundered your totem. Destroy him before Next Wednesday’s worship]74 In the judgment of composer W. D. Amaradeva, Santha’s music and pronunciation  of Tennakoon’s poetry further heightened Tennakoon’s depiction of the woman’s  desperation, hatred, and devotion: Santha was able to transform Tennakoon’s poem into a song of the highest level because  he expertly utilized the medium of music. He infused into music the sounds like curs- ing, pleading, and crying that we hear in village settings. . . . His composition possesses  national features distinct from the popular Indian way of singing. . . . [One can hear how  Santha] gives extra emphasis to pronouncing the dayanna letter. He does so to evoke the  woman’s resolute state of mind and her abhorrence of the thief. After these three lines  Santha composes music for the word “sāminē” that conjures a pleading woman making  a vow to the deity of Kataragama with the highest humility and devotion.75 In the opening phrase Santha accommodates Tennakoon’s alliteration of (mostly)  three dayanna letters per poetic line, with melodic motives of mainly three re- peated notes (BF#F#, EEE, D#D#D#, C#C#C, BBB) (ex. 2). EXAMPLE 2. Three-note motives and three dayanna letters in Sunil Santha and Rapiyel   Tennakoon’s “Dudan’oda Biňda.” </page> <page sequence="22"> Brothers of the Pure Sinhala Fraternity    55 In a revealing statement about his inspiration for the song’s music, Santha criti- cized S. N. Ratanjankar’s credibility as Radio Ceylon’s music consultant. Because  Ratanjankar had not resided in the village areas in Sri Lanka, Santha argued that  Ratanjankar lacked in an intimate knowledge of the people’s lives and behaviors  and was thus not qualified to audition Sinhalese musicians for radio positions: I am accustomed to experiencing our village women’s behavior when they lose some- thing valuable. They curse the gods and take vows. I have often heard them raising  their hands and saying in a thundering voice, things like “Oh God of Kataragama!  Please just cut this criminals neck off!” When I was setting music to the poem “Ku- kulu Hävilla” . . . I followed the rhythm of this woman’s plea.* * I do not know whether S. N. Ratanjankar has heard our woman’s cries, laments,  and curses.76 To conclude, Cumaratunga and his followers, such as Tennakoon and Santha, con- structed an alternative nationalist identity: one based on linguistic purism, op- posed to the Arya-Sinhala interpretation of the Mahāvaṃsa, and hostile toward  North India. If John De Silva and his colleagues (chapter 1) created an inner do- main of song with Buddhism and North Indian classical music at the core and the  West threatening from outside, Cumaratunga and his brothers in the Heḷa Havula  created an inner domain of song and poetry with a pure Sinhala language at the  heart and North India threatening from outside. Santha’s radio song and Tennakoon’s poetry thus oblige us to rethink Partha  Chatterjee’s assertion that colonial-era South Asian nationalism “launches its most  powerful, creative and historically significant project—to fashion a ‘modern’ na- tional culture that is nevertheless not Western.”77 Chatterjee assumes that there  existed only two players in the development of South Asian cultural nationalism:  the East and the West. I have tried to illuminate in this chapter how Santha’s music  turns Chatterjee’s contention inside out: Santha used Western musical influences  to fashion a modern Sinhalese national music that was not North Indian. </page> </plain_text>
