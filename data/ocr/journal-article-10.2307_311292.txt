'immo age et a prima dic, hospes, origine nobis insidias' inquit 'Danaum casusque tuorum erroresque tuos; nam te iam septima portat omnibus errantem terris et fluctibus aestas.' (Aen. 1.742-756) Wendell Clausen has recently drawn attention to a significant bal- ance between the summary of the song of lopas and the ensuing description of Dido: "It can hardly be accidental, especially at the end of a book, where closeness and precision of form may be expected, that the five lines reporting Iopas' song (742-746) are followed, with a sin- gle line intervening, by five lines indicating Dido's emotional state (748-752). A contrast seems to be implied between the calm, remote heavenly bodies and the immediate tumult in Dido's breast."' To this 1 W. V.

Brown perceptive observation it may be added that the style of the two pas- sages corresponds in such a way as to sharpen the contrast between them. The purpose of this article is to define the nature of this stylistic interaction, to explore the genesis and significance of the contrast which it enhances via a comparison with two crucial sources (the song of Orpheus in Apollonius' Argonautica and Vergil's own poetic apolo- gia in Georgics 2), and in the light of this to offer an overall interpreta- tion of the structural role of the song of lopas. The conclusion reached is that the main purpose of the song of lopas is to highlight the critical point at which Dido's feelings of friendly hospitality develop into an erotic passion; or, to put it another way, at which the "queen" becomes "lover." Vergil summarizes the contents of the song of lopas in a miscellane- ous list alternating between direct objects (742, 'errantem lunam solis- que labores,' 744, 'Arcturum pluviasque Hyadas,' etc.) and indirect questions (743, 'unde hominum genus et pecudes, unde imber et ignes,' 745, 'quid tantum Oceano,' etc., 746, 'vel quae tardis,' etc.). Such lists are typical of the programmatic syllabuses and recapitulations of didac- tic, and especially cosmological, poetry. The earliest example is found in the proem of Hesiod's Theogony: Ei'irzE 8' ; iax Inp6cra OEoi t ic yaca yvovto icai ioragotoi cai r6vro;g &amp;dEptvog oi'8tart Ovirov atopi tE XaCntert6oova Kica oipavb; Eapt; unEp0ev" [oi'r' 9x C (OV AFvov'o, 0EO' 8(0ipE i' V'] 0o t 'CrcEvo T 86ooavto icai ; ttglax; 8t&amp;Xovto, ic8:',i 6t'; xirp npota tnoXnrtuXiov EoXov "OXULtnuov.

Clausen compares 2.486-488, where the pitiful wailing of the doomed women in Priam's palace is said to strike against the "golden stars" (488, 'ferit aurea sidera clamor'); another obvious Vergilian parallel is the beautiful description of night in 4.522 ff., which contrasts with the account of Dido's anguish. For other, diverse uses of a remote starry backdrop to set off human emotions, cf. Catull. 7.7 ff., Hor.

The framework of these summaries is regularly composed of indirect questions. For example (from the most extensive such passage in the De Rerum Natura): quod superest, nunc huc rationis detulit ordo, ut mihi mortali consistere corpore mundum nativomque simul ratio reddunda sit esse; et quibus ille modis congressus materiai fundarit terram caelum mare sidera solem lunaique globum; tum quae tellure animantes extiterint, et quae nullo sint tempore natae; quove modo genus humanum variante loquella coeperit inter se vesci per nomina rerum; et quibus ille modis divom metus insinuarit pectora, terrarum qui in orbi sancta tuetur fana lacus lucos aras simulacraque divom. praeterea solis cursus lunaeque meatus expediam qua vi flectat natura gubernans, etc. (5.64 ff.) 2 Compare also Parm. fr. 10 (Diels-Kranz 28 B 10) (Ef'oS 6' aiepiav rte (oatv 6ra ' v aiOep ra/ ax'vt / garaia KaL Kra0apac; eiayeo; 0 exioto / Xagn6so; epy' ,i8nXa Ka' oinxoev Feyevovto, / pya te KicKcOcxO XEi) o3 i7epotPOta CeGXAjv;/ / ca PiqIV, eiFj- et;; 6 Kcal ojpavyv &amp;gppi; EXovra / Fveev Equ te Kat (; gtiy (iyoio(a) inj8o71ev 'Avaycli / elporpa' Xetyv  orpov) and Emped. fr. 62 (Diels-Kranz 31 B 62) (vi)v 8' aiy', ixo;c av6pcov E lrnoXKhaianov zt yuvat cVovv / LvvXiotS o 6pnrljca; av1YYE Kptv6pOEVov n1p, / ,tov&amp; KXo"').</page><page sequence="4">318 Robert D. Brown Embarking upon his own didactic poem, Vergil sets a Lucretian stamp upon the opening lines which unambiguously announces its genre: quid faciat laetas segetes, quo sidere terram vertere, Maecenas, ulmisque adiungere vitis conveniat, quae cura boum, qui cultus habendo sit pecori, apibus quanta experientia parcis, hinc canere incipiam. (G. 1.1 ff.) and examples can be mustered from elsewhere to show that this sort of programmatic summary, articulated primarily or partially by means of indirect questions, was a customary feature of Roman didactic poetry, even, perhaps, prior to Lucretius, though it was undoubtedly he who made it a hallmark of the grand didactic style (cf. Acc. fr. 13 Buechner; Verg. G. 4.118 ff.; Ov. Ars Am. 1.263 ff., 2.17 f., 3.611 f.; Rem. Am. 357 f.; Medic. 1 f., 51 f.; Manil. 1.16 ff., 809 ff., 3.160 ff.; Aetna 1 ff., 24 ff., 386). A particularly revealing case is found in the proem to the Aratea of Germanicus, who introduces a syllabus of this pattern where nothing equivalent exists in his model, Aratus: nunc vacat audacis ad caelum tollere vultus sideraque et mundi varios cognoscere motus, navita quid caveat, quid scitus vitet arator, quando ratem ventis aut credat semina terris. (Germ. Arat. 11 ff. [Gain]) The conventional use of such synopses in didactic poetry accounts for their presence in certain non-didactic works where the poet wishes to imitate or evoke the didactic manner. In the sixth Eclogue, for example, the cosmological introduction of Silenus' song (31 ff.), which recalls the subject matter and manner of Lucretius (specifically, the contents of his fifth book), is based upon two indirect questions intro- duced by uti and ut: (31, 'namque canebat uti ...,' 33, 'ut his exordia primis ...'). Didactic form goes hand in hand with didactic content. The same match appears in the famous passage of Georgics 2 where Vergil lists various topics of natural philosophy which he would wish above all to write about (failing that, he will be content with rural themes):</page><page sequence="5">The Structural Function of the Song of lopas 319 me vero primum dulces ante omnia Musae, quarum sacra fero ingenti percussus amore, accipiant caelique vias et sidera monstrent, defectus solis varios lunaeque labores; unde tremor terris, qua vi maria alta tumescant obicibus ruptis rursusque in se ipsa residant, quid tantum Oceano properent se tingere soles hiberni, vel quae tardis mora noctibus obstet. (G. 2.475-482)3 Several other instances of this manner can be cited from Roman poe- try.4 As for nondidactic Greek poetry, it is by no coincidence that the best example happens to be one of Vergil's chief models for the song of lopas-the summary of the cosmogonical song of Orpheus in the Argonautica, whose structure consists of a series of indirect questions introduced by Wg;: IIetSEv 6' 60 ,xya'x icxi o' pav ;i6 iF Xaaooaa, ot lrpiv i' &amp;XkiaXotat gdI cavaprlp6ta wlopq,9 i 06' 6;g 4ttEov ai v 'v aiO~pt EtElap eXoiatv aartpa, aEXrqva;IV t ic Ki iEca ioto KicE"Uot" o{upEOx 0' a0 &amp;v (' etXE, acai ; Iootcxroi o;e t IovTe; 3 For the influence of this passage on the song of Iopas see below, pp. 325-29. 4 Cf.

The purpose of establishing the existence of this convention is, firstly, to show that Vergil's summary of the song of lopas is couched in a style which recalls the manner of philosophical poetry and which therefore suits, and enhances, the elevated themes ascribed to lopas. (Vergil, one could say, has borrowed the manner which "lopas" him- self might have used in announcing the contents of his song.) Like most of the passages cited above, it prominently features the use of indirect questions: hic canit errantem lunam solisque labores, unde hominum genus et pecudes, unde imber et ignes, Arcturum pluviasque Hyadas geminosque Triones, quid tantum Oceano properent se tingere soles hiberni, vel quae tardis mora noctibus obstet; But secondly, and here we return to the balanced contrast discerned by Clausen, it is significant that precisely the same style, with its mixture of direct objects and indirect questions,5 is used by Vergil to report Dido's questions to Aeneas following the performance of lopas: multa super Priamo rogitans, super Hectore multa; nunc quibus Aurorae venisset filius armis, nunc quales Diomedis equi, nunc quantus Achilles. The Homeric model for this is the questioning of Odysseus by Alcinous at the end of book eight of the Odyssey, where indirect questions are employed at the beginning of the speech and again subsequently (572 ft., &amp;X' &amp;yE riot t65e Eini icai &amp;tpeicw; caxtdXpEov, / 5nnn nE-I nOYXrl re icaci &amp; ;tva; i'iceo Xwpa; / I vOpc cov, etc., 577).6 In 5 This time, "real" indirect questions (introduced by 'rogitans') as opposed to the con- ventional kind used to summarize content. For this distinction see R. Kiihner and C. Stegmann, Ausfiihrliche Grammatik der lateinischen Sprache: Satzlehre3, rev. A. Thierfelder (Leverkusen 1955) 2.487, but formally there is no difference. 6 See R. G. Austin, Aeneidos Liber Primus (Oxford 1971) on Aen. 1.750, who also</page><page sequence="7">The Structural Function of the Song of lopas 321 Vergil, however, the questioning of Aeneas by Dido clearly bears a closer formal relationship to the song of lopas than to the more diffuse Homeric original, and the reader's experience of it is colored by this parallelism. Especially noteworthy is the repetition of multa and super in line 750, which echoes the repetition of unde and et in line 743 ('unde hom- inum genus et pecudes, unde imber et ignes'), though now the linear parallelism of the clauses in 743 ('unde [A] hominum genus et pecudes [B] { = X + Y), unde [A] imber et ignes [B] { = X + Y}') is enriched with a chiastic element ('multa [A] super [B] Priamo [C] rogitans [D], super [B] Hectore [C] multa [A]'). Further variation is evident in the diminishing tricolon with anaphora with which the summary concludes ('nunc quibus ... nunc quales ... nunc quantus ...'), which is well interpreted by Clausen as an indication of Dido's mounting excitement-an excitement which culminates in her request for the full story of Troy's fall and Aeneas' wanderings (753-756). The looser structure of lopas' song-or at least Vergil's summary of it-captures the expansiveness of a philosophical exposition and suggests the unlim- ited range of the singer's knowledge and imagination. Thus a pattern that is especially associated with didactic poetry has been used by Vergil first in its most familiar role, to report the cosmo- logical song of lopas, and then in connection with an entirely different type of discourse.7 The effect of this stylistic correspondence is to draw cites Val. Flacc. 2.349 ff. and Naev. fr. 20 Buechner ('blande et docte percontat, Aenea quo pacto / Troiam urbem liquerit'), where the speaker's identity is unknown. While emphasizing the didactic history of such synopses I do not mean to imply that they are confined to didactic poetry (for other epic examples cf., e.g., Aen. 7.37 ff., Stat. Theb. 1.7 ff.). 7 An interesting parallel is supplied by an anonymous Greek drinking-song of the Roman period: Q&amp;Eq ap, XEt~giva, 0poq.

D. L. Page [London-Cambridge, Mass. 1970] no. 125.6-9). The juxtaposition of cosmological and sympotic concerns in lines 8-9, and the repetition of nt6Oev, have as their counterparts in Vergil the contrast of cosmological and epic subjects, and the under- lining of this contrast by the balanced repetitions analyzed above; the parallelism of nt6e[v] i6&amp;op and Vergil's 'unde imber' (743) is interesting, though presumably coin- cidental. (I am grateful to Professor Nisbet for bringing this poem to my attention. He compares the way in which Horace contrasts the immediate human needs of the sympo- sium with astrological speculation [Carm. 1.11 (with R. G. M. Nisbet and M.

Brown attention to and sharpen the contrast between the song of lopas and Dido's interrogation of Aeneas: the former an elevated sung perfor- mance (740 f., 'cithara ... personat,' 742, 'canit') probing the imper- sonal secrets of the universe, the latter consisting of miscellaneous private talk (748, 'vario ... sermone') concerning the personalities of the Trojan War. To this contrast Vergil adds extra emphasis by reduc- ing Dido's questions to a highly particular-not to say trivial-level: What armor was worn by Memnon? What were Diomedes' horses like? How big was Achilles? Natural objects of curiosity, perhaps, but hardly central to the Trojan saga and insignificant within the larger scheme of things suggested by the song of lopas. Dido's fascination with these details reflects her keen interest in the heroic world (witness the paintings at the temple of Juno)-an interest now entwined with an incipient erotic obsession, as hinted by the way in which her questions about the Greeks and Trojans inexorably converge on Aeneas himself (754-755, 'insidias ... Danaum casusque tuorum, / erroresque tuos; nam te . . .).8 Other echoes of the song of lopas may be detected, faintly, in the culminating speech of Dido: when she calls upon Aeneas to tell of his experiences "from their first origin" (753, 'a prima, dic, hospes, ori- gine'), just as lopas has sung of the origin of human beings, animals, and the elements (743), and when she refers, with sympathetic-but obsessive-repetition, to his years of wandering (755-756, 'erroresque tuos; nam te iam septima portat / omnibus errantem terris et fluctibus aestas'), which cannot but recall the "wandering moon" of lopas' song (742, 'errantem lunam solisque labores').9 Poschl interprets the moon's wanderings and sun's travails as symbolic of the fate of Aeneas and Dido.1o These metaphors occur in the Georgics and are by no means policy [see Nisbet-Hubbard on Carm. 1.26.3] and antiquarian pedantry [Carm. 3.19.1 ff.].) 8 The triple repetition of the second person betrays Dido's intense romantic interest; cf. Hor. Carm. 1.13.1 ff., 'cum tu, Lydia, Telephi / cervicem roseam, cerea Telephi / lau- das bracchia,' with Nisbet-Hubbard. 9 The repetition of errantem is lent some prominence by its occurrence in the first line of lopas' song and the last of Dido's speech. 10 V. P6schl, The Art of Vergil, tr. G. Seligson (Ann Arbor 1962) 152. His theory is entertained favorably by K. Quinn, Virgil's Aeneid: A Critical Description (Ann Arbor 1968) 108, but criticized-on differing grounds-by W.

E.</page><page sequence="9">The Structural Function of the Song of lopas 323 exclusively Vergilian.11 Nevertheless, their combination and prominent display in line 742 may be intentional in light of the persistent use of errolerror and labor in book one of the Aeneid to describe the experi- ences of Aeneas (and Dido);12 the language of heroic suffering is trans- posed to a cosmological key, as it were. This, however, would not jus- tify the conclusion that the sun and moon are meant to be symbols of the heroic protagonists. For the "wandering" moon and the sun's "tra- vails" are romantic, anthropomorphic conceptions of nature, self- refuted in the context of lopas' song by the implication that these wanderings and travails are, unlike their human counterparts, entirely subordinate to natural laws which may be investigated and revealed by scientific inquiry. In this respect, the epic resonance of line 742 may more accurately be described as ironic than symbolic in the sense sug- gested by P6schl. And thus, to return to the starting-point of this digression, the obtrusive echo of errantem in the last line of Dido's speech represents a restoration of epic language to its proper sphere and emphasizes her preoccupation with heroic experience as opposed to the celestial realms of lopas' song. The next step, after identifying and describing this contrast, is to investigate its significance, for which the best foundation is an exami- nation of Vergil's literary models. For present purposes, the two most illuminating are the song of Orpheus in the Argonautica and Vergil's autobiographical statement in the peroration of Georgics 2. The motif of the bard at the heroic banquet derives ultimately, of course, from the Odyssey. But Phemius and Demodocus sing of heroic and divine deeds, not about the secrets of the universe. Vergil's model for the introduction of a cosmological song into a heroic setting was clearly the song of Orpheus in the Argonautica (quoted in part above, Kinsey, "The Song of lopas," Emerita 47 (1979) 82-84. 1" Cf. G. 1.337, 'quos ignis caelo Cyllenius erret in orbis,' 2.478, 'defectus solis varios lunaeque labores.' 'Errantem' alludes to the basic sense of ~dX6vwreq while the phrase 'solisque labores' is a variation upon both 'lunaeque labores' (G. 2.478) and the Homeric formula iTXt6v t' &amp; pcdixcgavra (see below, n. 17).

Brown pp. 319 f.);13 moreover, the same scene in Apollonius also provided the inspiration for the incident involving Bitias which precedes the song of lopas (Aen. 1.738 f.). The song of Orpheus occurs on the evening before the heroes set sail from Iolcus, at a point in the narrative when the drunken and outrageous Idas has exchanged angry words with Idmon and their quarrel is threatening to get out of hand (Arg. 1.492 ff.). Orpheus then rises and, beginning with the separation of earth, sky, and sea through strife, sings of the sun, moon, and stars, the origin of mountains, nymphs, streams, and creatures, and of the genera- tions of the gods, with a concluding reference to the childhood of Zeus (496-511). The mesmerizing beauty of his song transfixes the heroes, who meekly perform libations to Zeus and go off to sleep peacefully, their discord all forgotten (512 ff.). The essential point to note in relation to Vergil's adaptation of Apol- lonius is that the song of Orpheus directly affects the action: a quarrel arises, Orpheus sings, the quarrel subsides. The song's causative role is also neatly underscored by verbal connections to the narrative con- text at its beginning and end. Thus its opening allusion to the "deadly strife" of the elements during the creation of the world (Arg. 1.498, vei- iEo; i4 6 Aooio) recalls and "sublimates" the strife of the heroes to which the song is a response (492, ropot p(o 6 ice vEico; &amp;r 017r1)).14 Likewise, its concluding allusion to the childhood and coming power of Zeus (508, 6&lt;ppa Zeb; ~i't Kco'po;; 511, ax y7p Adti K8oi6 nd `Et) prepares the way for the pouring of libations to Zeus with which the evening ends (516, cepaaooagevot Adti ot3d";). Thus the progression of the song, from elemental strife to the reign of Zeus, parallels-and promotes-the alteration in the mood of its audience, from conten- tiousness to peacefulness and piety. But whereas Orpheus' song succeeds in calming the heroes and bringing the evening to a harmonious conclusion, the song of lopas has no discernible effect at all beyond eliciting applause (747, 'ingeminant 13 See Clausen (above, n. 1) 29-31. Scholars have tended to concentrate on the rela- tion to the songs of Demodocus in book eight of the Odyssey; see esp. G. N. Knauer, Die Aeneis und Homer (Goittingen 1964 [Hypomnemata 7]) 166-171, P. R. Hardie, Virgil's Aeneid: Cosmos and Imperium (Oxford 1986) 52 ff. It has been suggested that Vergil's choice of theme was influenced by later attempts to interpret Demodocus' song about Ares and Aphrodite as a cosmological allegory (Knauer, 168 n. 2, Hardie, 61-63), but this theory seems superfluous in view of the obvious indebtedness to Apollonius. 14 Clausen (above, n. 1) 137 n. 17.</page><page sequence="11">The Structural Function of the Song of lopas 325 plausu Tyrii, Troesque sequuntur'). Dido, moreover, seems much more interested in the deeds of heroes than in the sun, moon, and stars-an interest which has been exacerbated by the work of Venus and Amor. Far from having the effect of calming passion like the song of Orpheus, the song of lopas, as Segal has well observed,15 is there- fore followed by an intensification of passion (which is not to suggest that the song causes this effect, but at the same time it does nothing to arrest it). A repetition of the calming influence exerted by the song of Orpheus would of course be quite inconceivable in the case of Dido, who, succumbing perforce to a divinely inflicted passion, can find no satisfaction or relief in the lofty themes of cosmological poetry; her emotions are pulling her in an entirely contrary direction, towards the story of Troy and Aeneas. Thus Vergil simultaneously conjures up a memorable scene of the Argonautica and changes-or virtually reverses-its outcome. (The same is true of the incident involving Bitias, whose cheerful compliance with the teasing rebuke of Dido is an innocent counterpart to the drunken display of Idas and his angry response to the castigation of Idmon in the Argonautica.)16 The causa- tive function of the Apollonian song is thereby replaced with the func- tion of providing a backdrop and a frame of reference for revealing the changing emotional state of Dido. Hence, perhaps, its strange, haunt- ing quality. For impressive as it may be, it remains, in a practical sense, irrelevant. Vergil's alteration of the Apollonian source to suit the requirements of his own narrative is typically creative, but more than a single literary antecedent is involved in this passage. In addition to Apollonius, and of course Homer,17 a third crucial source is Vergil himself-namely, 15 Segal (above, n. 10) 340. 16 Arg. 1.472 ff., 485 ff.; cf. Aen. 1.738 f., 'tum Bitiae dedit increpitans; ille impiger hausit / spumantem pateram et pleno se proluit auro.' It seems not to have been noticed by commentators that 'increpitans' corresponds to Fvutnr toyv, a verb found only in Apol- lonius (1.492, XMEZ' ,vinrd0yv [of Idas addressing Idmon], 864). Both verbs refer to sharp verbal criticism, both are lengthened forms (cf. 'increpo' and Bvinx0t), and both appear in the present participle at the end of a sentence. Unlike Idas' rebuke, Dido's, of course, is humorous, and Vergil doubtless expected his learned readers to appreciate the irony of his adaptation. 17 Not only the performances of Phemius and (especially) Demodocus but more specifically the cosmological section of the shield of Achilles; see Hardie (above, n. 13) 63 n. 72. For example, the phrase 'solisque labores' represents both a variation on 'lunae- que labores' (G. 2.478) and a subtle "correction" of Homer's "tireless sun" (II. 18.484, 71ixt6v ' &amp;~&amp;avta aoErivrlv tE tTrjouoav).

Brown the passage of Georgics 2 mentioned above, in which Vergil states that his theme of first choice would be natural philosophy, but lacking the capacity for that he will take his inspiration from the countryside. It is well known that the summary of the song of lopas bears a general simi- larity to the summary of philosophical themes in the Georgics and actu- ally repeats its last two lines concerning the subject of long winter nights.18 The broader structural influence of the passage as a whole has not, however, been formerly appreciated. For, if I am right, the con- trast analyzed above-that between lopas' performance and the eager questioning of Dido-owes something to the antithetical character of the passage in the Georgics. The latter falls into two opposing pairs of statements (labelled [A] and [B] and indented for the sake of clarity): A.i. me vero primum dulces ante omnia Musae, quarum sacra fero ingenti percussus amore, accipiant caelique vias et sidera monstrent, defectus solis varios lunaeque labores; unde tremor terris, qua vi maria alta tumescant obicibus ruptis rursusque in se ipsa residant, quid tantum Oceano properent se tingere soles hiberni, vel quae tardis mora noctibus obstet. A.ii. sin has ne possim naturae accedere partis frigidus obstiterit circum praecordia sanguis, the manner of Alexandrian poets, see R. F. Thomas, "Virgil's Georgics and the Art of Reference," HSCP 90 [1986] 185-189.) The line 'Arcturum pluviasque Hyadas geminos- que Triones' looks back to the same passage of Homer (II. 18.486 f., nItia6xa 0' 'Ya- at TE t6 TE o0ovoS 'Opi~ovo I/"Apictov 0', ilv iai "Agatav ntficirlotv iaXo-oatv). The phrase 'pluviasque Hyadas' contains an etymological pun on iketv and also preserves the sound pattern of Homer's 1nirlti6aq 0' 'Y6a&amp;x; the reference to the two Bears ('geminosque Triones') may again be seen as a correction of Homer, who mentions only one (for the two cf. Arat. Phaen. 26 f., Pease [above, n. 11] 805-808 on Cic. Nat. D. 2.105). Both passages (together with Georgics 2) share the notion of heavenly bodies dipping in the ocean (II. 18.489; Aen. 1.745 [ = G. 2.481]). 18 Aen. 1.745-746 = G. 2.481-482. The two passages also have in common the themes of the sun, moon, and stars, and the metaphor labores (cf. Aen. 1.742). By substituting the subject of the origin of life and the elements (Aen. 1.743) for that of earthquakes and high tides (G. 2.479-480) Vergil broadens the scope of the song of lopas in a way which recalls the first part of the song of Silenus (Ecl. 6.31 ff.) and book five of the De Rerum Natura. The line-beginning 'hic canit errantem ...' (Aen. 1.742) is a further indication that the song of Silenus was on his mind (cf. Ecl. 6.64, 'tum canit errantem .. .').</page><page sequence="13">The Structural Function of the Song of lopas 327 rura mihi et rigui placeant in vallibus amnes, flumina amem silvasque inglorius. o ubi campi Spercheosque et virginibus bacchata Lacaenis Taygeta! o qui me gelidis convallibus Haemi sistat, et ingenti ramorum protegat umbra!

(G. 2.475-494) Their careful balance repays analysis. Lines 475-482 (A.i.) are answered by 483-489 (A.ii.), and lines 490-492 (B.i.) by 493-494 (B.ii.). The second pair (B) is shorter by two thirds than the first (A), but the second member of each pair falls short of the first by a single verse, thus preserving a certain symmetry (8:7::3:2 verses). Articula- tion of the whole is aided by the correlation of the first verses of each paired member ('me vero primum ...,' 475; 'sin has ne possim ...,' 483; 'felix qui ...,' 490; 'fortunatus et ille ... qui ...,' 493) and by other forms of balance between the members of each pair. Thus, in the first pair (A), each member begins with a sentence comprising two introductory lines ('me vero ... amore,' 475-476; 'sin has ... sanguis,' 483-484) and two containing volitive subjunctives and a brief list of topics in which four aspects of nature are emphasized (two per line): accipiant caelique vias et sidera monstrent, defectus solis varios lunaeque labores; rura mihi et rigui placeant in vallibus amnes, flumina amem silvasque inglorius. This is followed in each case by a more expansive characterization of particular topics ('unde tremor ... obstet,' 479-482; 'o ubi campi ... umbra,' 486-489). In the second pair (B), along with the correlation of 'felix/fortunatus' noted above, there is a balance between the phrases 'rerum cognoscere causas' and 'deos ... novit agrestes,' with their opposing verbs of "knowing" set between opposing objects of knowledge.</page><page sequence="14">328 Robert D. Brown This structural balance is the formal vehicle for an antithesis of con- tent and attitude. The first member of the first pair (A.i.) presents nature as an awe-inspiring system to be scrutinized and plumbed by the human intellect-an achievement metaphorically equivalent to a reli- gious revelation ('accipiant,' 'monstrent'). Its features, as listed here, are remote or enigmatic (sky, stars, sun, moon, earthquakes, tides, winter nights). In contrast, the second member (A.ii.) presents nature as something physically accessible and beautiful (countryside, streams, rivers, woods, etc.), to be loved and enjoyed by human beings. In the second pair (B), the philosophical approach to nature is praised for bringing about an understanding of causation and the conquest of fear, while the country-dweller, by implication, enjoys an intimate acquain- tance with protective rural deities. Two different responses to nature lie behind these contrasts: the intellectual urge to master its workings with the mind and the quasi-religious urge to find in nature recreation for the spirit and food for the imagination. This difference is mirrored most clearly in the contrasting styles of the following passages, which correspond with one another according to the symmetrical scheme out- lined above: unde tremor terris, qua vi maria alta tumescant obicibus ruptis rursusque in se ipsa residant, quid tantum Oceano properent se tingere soles hiberni, vel quae tardis mora noctibus obstet. (479-482) o ubi campi Spercheosque et virginibus bacchata Lacaenis Taygeta! o qui me gelidis convallibus Haemi sistat, et ingenti ramorum protegat umbra! (486-489) The measured and internally balanced style of the first passage ('tumes- cant ... residant,' 'properent ... obstet'), articulated by the familiar series of indirect questions, suits the high seriousness of the subject matter. The second, by contrast, is aptly described by T. E. Page as a "rapturous outburst." Its syntax is incoherent, its versification dramatic (in particular, the sudden exclamation after the bucolic diaeresis in 486, the hiatus of 'o ubi,' the thrusting run-on of 'Taygeta' and 'sistat'; also,</page><page sequence="15">The Structural Function of the Song of lopas 329 the prominent placement of the Greek place-names 'Spercheos,' 'Lacaenis,' 'Taygeta,' and 'Haemi' at successive line-beginnings and -ends). The difference in style supports the difference in attitude defined above: that of intellectualism versus love. To return to the Aeneid, I am suggesting that Vergil has borrowed from Georgics 2 not only the essential content of the song of lopas but also, less overtly, its antithetical relationship to the immediately ensu- ing lines. The passage of the Georgics is marked, as we have seen, by balance of form and antithesis of content and attitude. Similarly, at the end of Aeneid 1, the summary of the song of lopas balances the depic- tion of Dido's interrogation in length and manner (the use of indirect questions) but contrasts with it in content (sun, moon, stars, etc., versus Priam, Hector, Memnon, etc.) and attitude (detached didacticism versus personal involvement). What was a contrast of poetic approaches to nature in the Georgics now, however, becomes subordinate to the dramatic requirements of the narrative and is transmuted into a device for highlighting the psychology of Dido. But a trace of the original antithesis remains, insofar as a contrast is intimated between the con- tents and manners of philosophical and epic poetry: lopas' lofty and impersonal themes as opposed to the heroic themes in which Dido is interested.19 To this extent, it may be said that the song of lopas and the narration of Aeneas elicited by Dido represent contrasting, or even rival, poetic performances. (Or, in autobiographical terms, that the pro- gression from the didactic to the epic mode reflects Vergil's own poetic career.) In addition to Georgics 2, Vergil doubtless recalled his juxtaposition of cosmological and mythological-primarily erotic-themes in the song of Silenus (Ecl. 6.31 ff.),20 but the all-inclusive continuity of Silenus' song is replaced in the Aeneid by a stark opposition, deriving from the Georgics, that hints at the irreconcilability of philosophy and love. Here it is useful to remember that erotic passion had been con- demned by most philosophical schools-a condemnation vividly expressed in recent literature by Lucretius (4.1058 ff.) and Cicero (Tusc. 4.68 ff.). The contemporary intellectual context is illuminated further by the fifth poem of Propertius' third book (mentioned above, 19 I am indebted here to the observations of Professor Beye. 20 Cf. above, n. 18.</page><page sequence="16">330 Robert D. Brown n. 4), which itself is indebted to the passage of Georgics 2 discussed previously. Here the poet lists the philosophical topics which he plans to study in his old age, when he has outgrown love (and love poetry): atque ubi iam Venerem gravis interceperit aetas, sparserit et nigras alba senecta comas, tum mihi naturae libeat perdiscere mores, quis deus hanc mundi temperet arte domum, qua venit exoriens, qua deficit, unde coactis cornibus in plenum menstrua luna redit, unde salo superant venti, quid flamine captet Eurus, et in nubes unde perennis aqua; etc. (Prop. 3.5.25 ff.) The clear implication of this is that love and philosophy do not mix: one is emotional, the other demands the untroubled exercise of reason. A similar implication is present, I suggest, at the end of Aeneid 1, where the opposition of reason and feeling is symbolized by the piquant antithesis between lopas' sober cosmic song and the flood of questions which pours from Dido's heart. The contrast between the song of lopas and Dido's emotional state has now been analyzed and placed in perspective through an examina- tion of two of the literary models which inform the passage. It now remains to apply these findings to a broader definition of the song's role within the narrative, specifically the banquet scene which con- cludes Aeneid 1. The scene is set with exquisite attention to atmo- sphere. At the first lull, the meal is removed and wine is served (723-724). A hubbub of voices swells and echoes around (725-726); lamps hanging from the golden ceilings and torches beat back the blackness of night (726-727). And now, at the climax of the festivities, Dido asks for the golden vessel encrusted with gems which Belus and all after him had been accustomed to use (728-730). (The object draws attention to her royal lineage and position.) There is silence, and she prays to Jupiter, god of guests and hosts, that he may prosper the meet- ing of Tyrians and Trojans, to Bacchus, bringer of joy, and to "good Juno," the patroness of Carthage (730-735). Capping the day on which she has magnanimously saved the Trojans and offered them a home, the prayer marks the culmination of Dido's role as a public figure. She pours a libation and takes a tiny sip before passing on the cup to Bitias</page><page sequence="17">The Structural Function of the Song of lopas 331 with a jocular rebuke which deftly breaks the spell (738, 'turn Bitiae dedit increpitans'). He drinks deeply, the other chiefs following suit, and lopas steps forward to entertain the company (736-740). As we survey this scene, it may now, I hope, be seen that the chief function of the song of lopas is to set off and highlight a critical turning point in the tragedy of Dido: her transformation from "queen" to "lover."21 The song plays no causative role in this transformation; nor do its themes have a direct relevance to the scene.22 By the criterion of realism it is also a thoroughly unconvincing form of entertainment for early Carthage (though it might have fitted better in Hellenistic Alexan- dria!).23 But all this is beside the point. What matters is the splendor of the singer and the sublimity of his theme, together conveying the impression of a mind directed upwards to the skies, away from tran- sient everyday concerns and towards the realm of permanent truths. Like the golden vessel of Belus used by Dido, the golden lyre of Iopas24 and his instruction by Atlas25 speak of excellence and tradition, 21 For Kinsey too ([above, n. 10] 79), the song of lopas "marks an important stage in the affair of Dido and Aeneas," but he differs fundamentally from me in suggesting that the song helps to bring about this new stage (see below, n. 22). 22 All interpretations along these lines seem to me to fail through lack of evidence or intrinsic implausibility. I include P6schl's symbolism, Kranz's idea ([above, n. 10] 36 f.) that the sun and moon allude to Phoenician religion, and Kinsey's notion ([above, n. 10] 77-84) that through its meteorological and other implications the song constitutes an inducement to the Trojans to remain in Carthage for the winter. 23 On the question of suitability, P6schl (above, n. 10) 151 and Austin (above, n. 6) 222 cite Macrob. Sat. 7.1.14, 'nonne siquis aut inter Phaeacas aut apud Poenos sermones de sapientia erutos convivalibus fabulis miscuisset, et gratiam illis coetibus aptam per- deret et in se risum plane iustum moveret?' Unless I am mistaken, however, they are wrong to interpret this as a criticism of Vergil's choice of theme. Macrobius is contrast- ing occasions like the party in Plato's Symposium, where philosophy is the central topic of conversation, with those such as the banquets in Phaeacia and Carthage, whose main purpose is pleasure and at which heavy conversation would have been out of place. Far from exemplifying 'sermones de sapientia erutos,' the song of lopas is implicitly recog- nized as a form of entertainment appropriate to such festive occasions. 24 Together with his long hair, the golden lyre of lopas associates him with Apollo, for whose golden plectrum and lyre see Nisbet-Hubbard (above, n. 7) on Hor. Carm. 2.13.26. The symbolism of high worth surely outweighs any connotation of "dangerous luxury" such as that discerned by Segal ([above, n. 10] 340-342, criticized by T. E. Kinsey, "The Song of lopas (II)," Emerita 52 [1984] 72, Hardie [above, n. 13] 57). 25 For Atlas as an inventor of natural philosophy see Hardie (above, n. 13) 58. Vergil is adapting to its Carthaginian context a poetic topos of divine instruction illustrated by Clausen (above, n. 1) 109 f. Segal's argument ([above, n. 10] 344 f. and in "lopas Revisited (Aeneid 1.740 ff.)," Emerita 49 [1981] 19 f.) that the mention of Atlas intro-</page><page sequence="18">332 Robert D. Brown while the loftiness of his theme is a secular counterpart to the queen's noble piety. It is a sign, too, of the high level of this civilization, whose attainments extend beyond architecture, art, and civil government (as observed by Aeneas earlier in the book), to luxurious dining and cosmological poetry-a type represented in Georgics 2 as the preem- inent form of didactic poetry. The song of lopas therefore brings to a fitting climax a day in which we have witnessed the best of Carthage and of Dido herself-a fitting but a fleeting climax, immediately compromised by the ominous contrast of theme and mood which fol- lows. Thus it performs, Janus-like, the double function of enhancing Dido's finest moment as queen and providing a solemn and poignant backdrop for the first direct expression of her fateful love. Servius' observation that the philosophical song of lopas is appropriate to the "still chaste" condition of the queen ('bene philoso- phica introducitur cantilena in convivio reginae adhuc castae') reveals, I believe, a partial understanding of this role. Indeed, not only is Dido still chaste, but she has not yet even fallen in love-or Vergil has not said she has fallen in love (which comes to the same thing). Vergil traces the development of Dido's feelings with a sure sense of grada- tion and suspense. We witness first her sense of sympathy and regret when Aeneas is believed missing (575-576) and the deep impression made by his physical appearance and misfortune (613 f.). In the even- ing, after Aeneas has sent for gifts and Cupid taken the place of Ascanius, she is touched by the gifts and the boy, whom she feasts her eyes upon and hugs to her bosom (717 ff.). Cupid, meanwhile, begins to erase the memory of Sychaeus and attempts to waken her dormant heart "with a living love" (721, 'et vivo temptat praevertere amore'), but we are not given an unequivocal indication of his success until the concluding passage of the book (748 f., 'nec non et vario noctem ser- mone trahebat / infelix Dido longumque bibebat amorem'). It is with deliberate and devastating irony, of which Servius seems unaware, that this statement is directly juxtaposed with the song of lopas. duces a disturbing note is disputed by Kinsey (above, n. 10) 84; (above, n. 24) 70. In response to Segal's related argument that there is an emphasis in lopas' song on the "irre- gularities and the blemishes in nature rather than its orderliness and harmony" ([above, n. 10] 345; cf. "lopas Revisited," 18-21), I would suggest that it is precisely the "irregu- lar" or-as I would prefer to describe them-"problematical" aspects of nature which are the most difficult to explain and that their inclusion in the song of lopas is a measure of his intellectual stature.</page><page sequence="19">The Structural Function of the Song of lopas 333 The transitional role of the song of lopas is emphasized further by the structure and imagery of the final scene (723-756). The structure, to begin with, has a circular design whose effect is to centralize the song of lopas. Following the opening lines of descriptive scene-setting (723-727), we have (A) Dido's prayer, libation, and passing of the cup (728-740), (B) the song of lopas (740-747), and (C) Dido's questions and request, prompted by her growing love (748-756). Thus, after the introductory description (723-727), the scene breaks down into three main sections dominated by Dido, lopas, and finally Dido again.26 Each of these sections features a particular mode of discourse-prayer, philosophical song, and conversation-and they begin and end with direct speeches of Dido roughly balancing one another in length (731-735 - 753-756) and both containing the word hospes in their first line (731, 'hospitibus'; 753, 'hospes'). The circularity of this sequence, which places the focus first on Dido, shifts to lopas, and then returns to Dido, confers a pivotal status on the song of lopas and dramatizes the change in Dido. Before the song she is a queen (728, 'regina') in her full glory, graciously presiding over a public function. After it she is a doomed lover (749, 'infelix Dido'), indulging her private curiosity. Finally, the tragic alteration in Dido's nature is also intimated by the motif of drinking which frames the song of Iopas.27 In preparation for the drinking session, great mixing bowls, with all their promise of good cheer, are set up and garlanded (724). Dido, next, fills her special bowl with wine (729 f.) and prays to the gods, amongst them Bacchus, "giver of joy" (734), the appropriate divinity for this stage of the revelry. Pouring a libation, she takes just a tiny sip before passing on the vessel to Bitias with a deft challenge that prompts him to swill himself with wine (an incident adapted from the equivalent scene preceding the song of Orpheus in the Argonautica [1.472 ff.], as noted earlier): dixit et in mensam laticum libavit honorem primaque, libato, summo tenus attigit ore; 26 One may even detect a more complex chiastic order which would accommodate the roles of the minor players: thus, Dido (A), Bitias, 'alii proceres' (B), lopas (C), 'Tyrii, Troesque' (B), Dido (A). 27 Cf. Segal (above, n. 10) 340.</page><page sequence="20">334 Robert D. Brown tum Bitiae dedit increpitans; ille impiger hausit spumantem pateram et pleno se proluit auro; (736-739) Dido's dignified restraint enhances our respect for her, but the intention of this contrast is not to disparage Bitias, who acts in the spirit of the occasion and in response to Dido's playful rebuke-not like Idas in the Argonautica, out of greed and bad manners. There is, nonetheless, an explicit and deliberate contrast, whose meaning is not immediately per- ceptible. Its ulterior purpose becomes clear after the song of lopas, when, as Dido draws out the night in conversation, Vergil, in an obvi- ous allusion to the drinking going on at the banquet (thus Servius: 'adlusit ad convivium')-and specifically to Dido's previous light sip of wine, describes her as "drinking long draughts of love":28 nec non et vario noctem sermone trahebat infelix Dido longumque bibebat amorem, (748-749) Thus the abstemious Dido who had pressed wine upon Bitias now gets drunk herself on the love instilled in her by Cupid. The contrast between literal drinking and the metaphorical draught of passion is ironic and tragic, revealing, as it does, the inexorable progress of Cupid's work behind Dido's controlled public facade. In her abstemi- ousness, Dido fulfills the social expectations of a woman and a queen ('et verecundiam reginae ostendit et morem Romanum' [Servius]), and the libation scene as a whole shows her for the last time in full com- mand of herself and her royal position. But the very next reference to her, separated by the song of lopas, shows this control to be irreversi- bly slipping from her grasp as she sinks helplessly into a private obses- sion.29 VASSAR COLLEGE 28 The contrast of literal and metaphorical drinking is noticed by Segal (above, n. 10) 340 and Kinsey (above, n. 10) 81 n. 1, but neither clearly defines the ironic interplay between Dido's abstemiousness, Bitias' indulgence, and Dido's metaphorical drunken- ness. 29 I1 am very grateful to Professors Charles Beye, Wendell Clausen, and Robin Nisbet for their generous and helpful comments on a version of this article.</page></plain_text>
