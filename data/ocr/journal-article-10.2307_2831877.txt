<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANIMAL BEHAVIOR PEACEMAKING AMONG PRIMATES. By Frans de Waal. Harvard University Press, Cambridge (Massachusetts). $29.95. xiv + 294 p.; ill.; index. ISBN: 0-674-65920-1. 1989. It is the concensus of some 30 years of ethological research that aggression serves a purpose. For animals that live gregariously, however, there is also a special cost: aggression threatens to undermine the network of social relationships on which their sur- vival ultimately depends. It is therefore not entirely surprising (though it has been long neglected) that primates have evolved mechanisms to keep the peace. Frans de Waal was the first to systematically inves- tigate those mechanisms, and they are the subject of his book. Written for the general reader, this book summa- rizes de Waal's research on social tolerance and recon- ciliation in four non-human primate species held in captivity. By reconciliation, he refers to friendly re- unions between former opponents after a fight. The style of these reunions varies: chimpanzees hug and kiss, sometimes long after fighting; bonobos use all manners of sexual behavior; stumptail macaques make noisy, conspicuous spectacles almdst immedi- ately after fighting; and rhesus macaques may sim- ply brush past one another some minutes later. This behavior is described in a captivating way, using anecdotes rather than data tables. De Waal is very good at capturing the "feel" of the animals he describes: I felt as if we were sitting around the lunch table, musing over furry friends. The assump- tion of anthropomorphic cognitive abilities, however, would not be appreciated by all behavioral scien- tists, and might be misleading to the layperson. The final chapter is devoted to humans. It is the most speculative chapter, mainly because little is known, from direct observation, about unmediated conflict resolution in interpersonal relationships. Still, it is no secret that the author thinks our closest relatives reveal something about ourselves because we share a heritage of peacemaking mechanisms that evolved alongside our ability to be aggressive. An accurate perspective on human nature must recog- nize both these abilities. De Waal alludes to several interesting aspects of reconciliatory behavior that are still poorly under- stood. Most fundamentally, the effect of friendly re- unions on subsequent behavior of former opponents must be empirically documented. That peacemak- ing is strategically oriented toward valuable social partners is an assumption that needs explicit test- ing. We know little about the motivation for peace- making, and the role of mediation in that process. There are no data from free-living populations of non-human primates. Finally, the role of peacemak- ing after conflicts must be put in perspective with regard to other ways of mitigating the effects of ag- gression, like avoiding it or restraining its intensity. These gaps in knowledge are only signs of a new area of inquiry. Despite all we don't yet know, there seem to be grounds for a new perspective on aggres- sive behavior. And this is a good book for a non- specialist who wants to find out about it.
