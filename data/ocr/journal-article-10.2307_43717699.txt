<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Social Origins of the Aniconic Tradition in Early Israel RONALD S. HENDEL Southern Methodist University Dallas, TX 75275 I One of the central problems in our knowledge of ancient Israelite religion concerns a proper understanding of two factors: the claim to unique- ness of Israel's religion and the traditional West-Semitic cast of Israel's reli- gion. The proliferation of archaeological and textual evidence from the ancient Near East in the last century has sharpened the issue, for Israelite religion has come to look very much like the religions of her neighbors. As P. D. Miller has recently commented, concerning the nature of Yahweh: In most respects Yahweh appears in the texts as a typical Late Bronze/ Iron Age god. He has a name and a character, anthropomorphic form, associations with a people or nation, a dwelling place in the heavens, an entourage, associations with nature, and typical roles, e.g., father, creator, judge, warrior, and king.1 In light of these and other continuities, the features that distinguish Israelite religion from the religions of her neighbors become even more striking.

As W. Zimmerli has convincingly demonstrated, the earliest wording of the second command- ment was: lõD tacāšeh-lekā pesei, "You shall not make for yourself divine images."4 The commandment in the Covenant Code specifically prohibits divine images made of silver or gold,5 and other versions use the phrase Wõhê massēka, "molten gods."6 This emphasis on metal divine images need not be seen as a significant variation on the Decalogue version, since cultic images in the ancient West-Semitic world were generally made of metal or plated with metal, especially precious metals.7 2 Ibid., 211-12.

In fact, we find clear discontinuity in the presence of anthropomorphic figurines between the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age strata in early Israelite sites. In Late Bronze Age strata the appearance of figurines, both male and female, is common.8 In Iron Age strata in Israelite sites only a handful of male figurines have been unearthed, only one of which is likely an Israelite divine image.9 The main type of female cult image, the standing goddess plaque, seems to be entirely lacking in the Israelite sites.10 The discontinuity in mate- 44:18; in other accounts the cult idol is cast of metal: see Isa 44:12 (iron); 46:6 (silver and gold).

Hazor is very likely a deity of the "enthroned god" type familiar from the Late Bronze Age. The figurine was found in a jar containing other bronze objects buried just under the floor of a cultic enclosure. This location indicates that the jar and its contents may have been a foundation deposit for the Israelite cult place. According to Negbi, this "may indicate that the cult of the kingly male deity worshipped by the latest Canaanite inhabitants was also adopted by the first Israelite settlers on the upper mound at Hazor" ( Canaanite Gods, 138; see also 50-53, 142, fig. 60, pl. 34); cf.

Also of interest is the bronze fist found in a fill in lOth-cent. Jerusalem. The fist corresponds to the design of the "smiting god" figurines of the Late Bronze Age. The location of this fragment of a divine image in a fill is an intriguing datum. 10 H.

II THE question arises: what was the reason for the prohibition on divine images in early Israel? The question of origins is intriguing, for here we have a possible clue to the distinctiveness of Israel's early religious cult. If we can trace the origin of the aniconic tradition, then perhaps we can say something about the difference between Israelite religion and the other religions of the ancient Near East. Scholars disagree on the possible reasons for the origin of the aniconic tradition in Israel. Some recent commentators have maintained that "the postulates behind the ban on images cannot now be ascertained."11 Nonethe- less, certain theories are widely held.12 These can be generally grouped ac- cording to four possible motives for the aniconic tradition: (1) Yahweh is a god of history. (2) Yahweh cannot be magically manipulated. (3) Yahweh is transcendent. (4) Yahweh is Israel's god in contrast to the gods of Canaan. One often finds that two or more of these motives have been combined in a given theory, but it is useful to separate them into individual propositions for the purpose of analysis and criticism. The first proposed motive for the aniconic tradition, that "Yahweh is a god of history," is perhaps best represented by the views of W. Zimmerli, as initially expressed in his article, "Das Zweite Gebot." Zimmerli contends that in ancient Israelite religion: Yahweh does not disdain the sphere of genuine history; in this sphere he en- counters Israel. But woe to the one who believes he can contain in an image this God who reveals himself openly. Yahweh's freedom is infringed upon by a divine image which man makes for himself.13 urines, with Special Reference to Jerusalem: Cave 1," Levant 9 (1977) 121-55, esp. 124-25, 131-34, and references.

Thus emerges a clear motive for the prohi- bition of divine images. Zimmerli's view that Yahweh is a god of history as opposed to the other gods of the ancient Near East, who are gods of nature or of "myth," is common in certain circles of biblical scholarship, particularly among the German Heilsgeschichte theologians and the English-speaking followers of the "Old Testament Theology" movement.14 In the last two decades, how- ever, this view has increasingly come under attack. B. Albrektson and others have demonstrated that Israel's religion was not unusual among the ancient Near Eastern religions in regarding history as an important forum of divine activity; rather, this notion is to be regarded as "part of the common theology of the ancient Near East."15 Yahweh is not distinguishable from Marduk, Ashur, or the other national gods in his activity in "history." From another angle of criticism, J. Barr has undermined the notion that revelation in history is at all a central concept in Israelite religion. The terms "history" and "revelation" as used by biblical scholars generally have little to do with the conceptual categories of ancient Israel. To import these categories into a discussion of ancient Israelite religion is to misrepresent the bibli- cal evidence.16 Zimmerli's view of Yahweh's revelation in history as a motive for the aniconic traditon is, therefore, inadequate. Zimmerli goes on, however, to incorporate into his theory a version of the second motive, viz., that "Yahweh cannot be magically manipulated." Zimmerli states that the prohibition on images of Yahweh stems from a belief in a God "who cannot be controlled by any human will, not even a pious human will."17 Yahweh's identity as a god of history and as a god who cannot be magically manipulated are two corresponding parts of Zimmerli's theory. The reasoning is clear: because Yahweh is a god of history, he is immune to magical manipulation; therefore 14 For references and discussion, see J. H. Hayes and F.

The supposition is that Israelite religion embraced history while rejecting magic, placing it in a different position from that of the other ancient Near Eastern religions. Once again, this view has come under severe attack in recent years, particularly in an insightful treatment by J. J. M. Roberts. Roberts asks the question: "Were the pagan gods, in fact, more susceptible to manipulation than Yahweh, and was the pagan cult a more blatant at- tempt to gain control over the deity than the Israelite cult?"18 Based on a survey of the evidence, Roberts answers in the negative. Israelite religion, with its various divinatory techniques, attempted to discern the will of Yah- weh, just as other Near Eastern religions attempted to discern the will of their gods. Roberts writes that many biblical theologians "have basically misun- derstood divination . . . when they describe it as a way of tricking or coercing the deity into revelation."19 Zimmerli's view falls into this category: the distinction between divine freedom and magical manipulation is miscon- ceived as an operative notion in Israel or the ancient Near East. The two motives proposed in Zimmerli's theory - that Yahweh is a god of history and that he cannot be magically manipulated - are both inade- quate as explanations of the origin of the aniconic tradition in ancient Israel. Both notions are essentially foreign to the religion of ancient Israel. The third proposed motive, that Yahweh is transcendent, is also popular as an explanation of the aniconic tradition. Perhaps the most influential proponent of this view is G. von Rad, particularly in his Old Testament Theology, Von Rad regards the commandment forbidding images as "the expression of an utterly different view of the world" when compared with other ancient Near Eastern cultures.20 According to von Rad: In the greater and the lesser religions of the ancient East the gods were per- sonified powers of heaven or earth or the abyss. But this was not the way in which Jahweh was related to the world. However powerful his sway in it was, theologically he still transcended it. Nature was not a mode of Jahweh's being; he stood over against it as its Creator. This then means that the commandment 18 J. J. M.

The prohibition ex- presses "the impossibility of representing Jahweh by an image."22 Von Rad's theory has a certain coherence that is appealing, but it fails to comprehend the evidence. Do Yahweh's transcendence and hiddenness distinguish him from the other gods of the ancient Near East? Clearly the answer is no. Yahweh might indeed be transcendent in various ways, but once again this is a feature of the "common theology" of the ancient Near East. Yahweh may be distant and hidden at times, but so might Enlil or Marduk. The "Baby- lonian Theodicy" concludes on a note of the gods' hiddenness and transcen- dence: libbi iii kīma qirib Same nesī-ma le^aūssu šupšuqat-ma niSī lā lamdā 23 The divine mind is remote like the inmost part of the heavens; knowledge of it is difficult, people are uninformed. The concept of transcendence is indeed valid in describing aspects of Israelite religion. The flaw in von Rad 's view is that transcendence is a quality that applies as well to the other religions of the ancient Near East.24 The tran- scendence of Yahweh is not a sufficient notion to explain the prohibition of divine images in Israel. The last proposed motive that I have singled out is the proposition that Yahweh is Israel's god in contrast to the gods of Canaan. One recent pro- ponent of this view is O. Keel.25 According to Keel: 21 Von Rad, Old Testament Theology, 1. 218. 22 Ibid. W. G. Lambert, Babylonian Wisdom Literature (Oxford: Clarendon, 1960) 86-87, lines 256-57; see also T.

In this way socio-cultural, political, and theological motives are mixed, as with the original rejection of kingship.26 Thus, the early Israelites prohibited divine images as an anti-Canaanite move, just as they prohibited other Canaanite institutions, such as kingship. Several of Keel's arguments are flawed, however. The view of Israel's origins as a conflict between the land-hungry nomads and the decadent settled Ca- naanites rests on various romantic assumptions that have been thoroughly debunked with the aid of modern sociological and anthropological data. The work of G. Mendenhall and N. Gottwald has been of central importance in repudiating these assumptions.27 More important to Keel's argument, how- ever, is the notion, common to biblical scholars, that anything otherwise inexplicable can be attributed to Israel's "anti-Canaanite" stance. The logical flaw in this notion has been neatly described by M. Douglas: "It is no ex- planation to represent Israel as a sponge at one moment and as a repellent the next, without explaining why it soaked up this foreign element but re- pelled that one."28 The view that Israel's aniconic tradition stems from an anti-Canaanite stance is perfectly possible, but to resort to this reason with- out stating why divine images were prohibited while other features of pre- Israelite religion were not is essentially an avoidance of the problem, not a solution. Ill The currently available theories for the origin of the aniconic tra- dition in Israel are inadequate, based as they are on notions that have not stood up to criticism. In order to attempt to break the impasse, I propose to follow a slightly different tack than has been attempted previously. My im- 26 Keel, Jahwe-Visionen, 39-40. 27 See, e.g., G. E.

Douglas, Purity and Danger (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1966) 49.</page><page sequence="9">SOCIAL ORIGINS OF THE ANICONIC TRADITION 373 petus comes from some of the comments of Douglas in her work on Israelite religion and society. Following her criticism of the "Israel is a sponge" view of certain biblical scholars, she remarks: Of course no culture is created out of nothing. The Israelites absorbed freely from their neighbors, but not quite freely. Some elements of foreign culture wereincompatible with the principles of patterning on which they were con- structing their universe; other were compatible.29 Concerning one of the prohibitions in Israel's dietary system, Douglas writes: Whatever the historical evidence for this adoption of an . . . [element] into Judaism, we shall see that there was in the patterning of their culture a pre- formed compatibility between this particular [element] and the general princi- ples on which their universe was constructed.30 The point stressed by Douglas is that there are reasons why certain features were accepted and certain features rejected in Israelite religion. The reasons have to do with the general principles that inform the various areas of Is- raelite life, not only religious life but also social, political, and economic life. To explain a single prohibition is to explore its interconnection with the "principles of patterning" that underlie the various aspects of religion and culture. With this methodological principle in mind, I propose to examine the prohibition on images of deity in ancient Israel with an eye to the possible linkage of this feature to other aspects of early Israelite culture. If a linkage can be found between the cultic prohibition and some basic structuring prin- ciple of Israelite society, then an adequate theory can be proposed explaining the origin of the aniconic tradition in Israel. My procedure will be as follows: (1) an examination of the divine symbolism of the earliest phase of Israelite religion - the religion of the tribal league - with an emphasis on the Canaan- ite antecedents to this symbolism; (2) an examination of the difference be- tween the Canaanite antecedents and the Israelite version. The difference between the Canaanite and the Israelite symbolism will be described as a direct result of one of the central features of the social structure of early Israel. The origin of the aniconic tradition in Israel will be seen as not simply a random anti-Canaanite sentiment but rather as an integral expression of the religious and political principles on which the universe of early Israel was constructed. 29 Ibid. 30 Ibid.</page><page sequence="10">374 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 50, 1988 IV THE CHIEF SYMBOL OF THE EARLY ISRAELITE LEAGUE Was the ark of the covenant.31 The ark was regarded as a holy palladium on which Yahweh was enthroned. According to the P description in Exod 25:10-22 and 37:1-9, the ark was a chest made of acacia wood, plated with gold, with four rings attached on the sides so that it could be carried by means of two gold-plated poles. On top of the ark was a gold cover, and at opposite ends of the cover were two golden cherubim with wings outstretched. The P description un- doubtedly stems from the iconography of the ark in the Solomonic temple, but the general form of the description fits well the picture of the ark in earlier texts. In the era of the tribal league, the ark is mentioned most fre- quently in the context of holy war.32 The ark is carried before the Israelite troops to battle and later returns with the troops, both movements being accompanied by ritual chants such as the archaic verse preserved in Num 10:35-36:33 qûmâ yahweh wëyâpûsû 34 Dõyebêkâ wèyânûsû mēsanDekā mippānēkā Sûbâ yahweh rebabó t Dalpê yiśra^eP5 31 On the ark of the covenant, see H.-J.

Hillers, "Ritual Procession of the Ark and Ps 132," CBQ 30 (1968) 48-55. 34 The initial waw on this and the following verb may not be original; cf. Ps 68:2, which is apparently an independent variant. 35 This bicolon is obviously corrupt. Cross proposes a possible reading: "Return, Yahweh &lt;with&gt; the myriads / &lt;3E1 with&gt; the thousands of Israel," basing the latter reconstruction on a possible haplography triggered by homoioarcton: &lt;Hb&gt; 3lp (Canaanite Myth, 100); Miller pro- poses an alternate reading: "Return, Yahweh, / &lt;With&gt; the myriads of &lt;holy ones&gt; / With the thousands of Israel," basing the reconstruction on the similar phraseology in Deut 33:2-3 ( rbbt qdš) and Ps 68:18 ( Divine Warrior, 145, cf. 76-80, 108-9). I prefer to remain agnostic about the original form of the verse, while acknowledging the attractions of the various proposals. The only change to the text that I have effected is to repoint rbbt as an absolute form.</page><page sequence="11">SOCIAL ORIGINS OF THE ANICONIC TRADITION 375 Arise, Yahweh, let your enemies be scattered, let your adversaries flee before you. Return, Yahweh, (with) the myriads, (with) the troops36 of Israel. The function of the ark as the cultic symbol of Yahweh is perhaps most clear in the "ark narrative" of 1 Samuel 4-6, a text which may be one of the oldest prose narratives in the Hebrew Bible.37 At the heart of this narrative, as Miller and Roberts have recently demonstrated, is a reflection of an old Near Eastern mythological theme, that of the capture and return of the divine image, in which the ark functions as the equivalent of the divine image.38 In the "ark narrative," after the ark has been captured in battle, Yahweh defeats Dagon and the Philistines, and finally the ark returns to Israel in triumph. The title of the ark in 1 Sam 4:4, at the beginning of the "ark narrative," makes explicit its divine symbolism. The text states that the priests brought down from Shiloh "the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of Hosts enthroned on the cherubim." The latter phrase, "Yahweh of Hosts enthroned on the cherubim" ( yahweh sěbďot yošěb hakkërûbîm) is known from other texts in the Hebrew Bible, but it appears that its connection with the ark is its original Sitz im Leben .39 The ark with its two cherubim constitutes Yahweh's throne; it is the earthly image of the heavenly throne. Yahweh, of course, rules from both thrones simultaneously, according to the mythic parallelism of the earth- ly and heavenly shrine.40 The image of Yahweh enthroned on the cherubim is reflected in the ini- tiatory visions of the prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel, both of whom see Yahweh enthroned and surrounded by winged divine creatures.41 For a clearer view of this divine symbolism, however, we must look at the iconography of Israel's 36 Reading Dalpê, "thousands," in the martial sense of "troops'*; see G.

Albright pointed out in 1938, the clearest analogy to the image of Yahweh enthroned on the cherubim is the image of the Phoenician king Ahiram, carved on his sarcophagus around 1000 B.c.E.42 Ahiram is depicted seated on a throne flanked by two cherubim, with his feet on a footstool, holding in his outstretched hands a shallow bowl and a lotus flower. A related image is found on an ivory plaque from 13th- or 12th-century Megiddo.43 In this relief, a royal figure is shown seated on a throne flanked by winged cherubim, again with feet on a footsool, and holding a shallow bowl and a flower in his hands. The similarity in icono- graphy is pronounced, though there are certain regional and chronological stylistic differences.44 The two images of the Canaanite and the Phoenician kings seated on their cherub thrones are the closest examples in time and space to the Isra- elite concept of Yahweh enthroned on the cherubim. There are, however, later Phoenician and Punic examples of this iconography that are perhaps of greater interest, for they depict not a king but a god enthroned on the cherubim. From the 6th century b.c.e. and thereafter, numerous images have been found of a bearded god seated on a cherub throne, with one hand outstretched in a gesture of blessing and with a staff or a scepter held in the other. The god is clothed in a robe and wears a conical crown. Often a standing figure is facing the god, perhaps a priest or a king. These images of the enthroned, bearded god have been found in Lebanon, Cyprus, Sicily, Sardinia, Carthage, and elsewhere in the Punic world, primarily on seals and bulla, but also on coins, stela, and statuettes.45 The image of the bearded god enthroned on the cherubim is identified as the image of Baal Hammon, the chief god of the Punic pantheon. It is important to note, however, that being seated on a cherub throne is not the only way in which Baal Hammon is pictured; there are numerous examples 42 W. F.

With this latitude in iconography in mind, we can concur with W. Culican, F. M. Cross, and others that this iconography of Baal Hammon is clearly rooted in the old iconography of the god El, the chief god of the Canaanite pantheon of the Late Bronze Age.46 In a famous stela from Ugarit, an image is depicted of a bearded god seated on a throne, with one hand raised in a gesture of blessing and with a shallow bowl held in the other. The feet of the god rest on a footstool, and he wears a conical, horned crown on his head. Facing the god is a standing worshiper, perhaps a priest or a king.47 Other images of this bearded, enthroned god have been found at Ugarit,48 and the mythic texts from Ugarit make it clear that this image can only be identified as the god El.49 The iconographie evidence thus complements the linguistic evidence that has been marshaled by Cross to support the argument, first proposed by B. Landsberger, that Baal Hammon is to be identified with El.50 If Baal Hammon is a later title of El, then the continuity in iconography is understandable. The image of Baal Hammon is a later version of the image of El. The correspondence of the image of the bearded god enthroned on the cherubim with the image of Canaanite El solves a number of problems. First, it explains why the kings of Megiddo and Byblos in the late second millen- nium were pictured as seated on cherub thrones. The king, who is the earthly regent of the god,51 is pictured in the pose of the divine king, El. Second, it provides an origin for Yahweh's epithet, "enthroned on the cherubim." As Cross has noted, "the epithet yošěb kërûbîm is evidently an El epithet applied to Yahweh."52 Yahweh, who may have originally been an El figure himself,53 has inherited aspects of El's iconography. There is an important difference, 46 Culican, "Iconography," 63; Cross, Canaanite Myth, 35-36; Mettinger, "YHWH SABAOTH," 131-34. 47 C. F. A. Schaeffer, "Les fouilles de Ras Shamra-Ugarit.

V The canaanite antecedent to the description of Yahweh as "en- throned on the cherubim" is the iconography of the god El. This datum returns us to the problem stated at the beginning of this paper: the relation- ship between continuity and discontinuity in early Israelite religion. The continuity in this case is the similar description of the chief god seated on the divine throne. The discontinuity is, in essence, the aniconic prescription, the fact that Yahweh is not physically represented as seated on his divine throne. Wherein lies the motive for this difference in images? Why the prohibition on the image of Yahweh? The answer that I propose lies in the relationship between the image of the cherub throne and the social structure of early Israel. To put it briefly, the iconography of the cherub throne implies two interconnected images: the image of the god and the image of the king. In early Israel there existed a strong bias against the institution of kingship. Once the image of the king was rejected, the image of the god, which was essentially a mirror image of the king, was also rejected. Since there was no place in the early Israelite universe for a king, the divine image that symbolized the authority of the king was prohibited. In short, the motive for the aniconic tradition in early Israel was the bias against kingship and its iconography. This requires fur- ther explanation. One of the characteristic features of early Israelite society was its bias against the institution of kingship. Alone among its neighbors in the ancient Near East, Israel regarded kingship as an unnecessary evil. Gideon's rejection of kingship, Jotham's fable, and Abimelech's abortive attempt at kingship in Judges 8-9 are pertinent examples of this sentiment in early Israel;54 the so-called "anti-monarchic" source in 1 Samuel 8; 10:17-27 is another.55 The 54 See esp.

The anti-kingship senti- ment in early Israel was dominant in the era of the tribal league, only to give way under the threat of Philistine expansion in the mid-eleventh century. Later voices, such as the prophet Hosea, continued to recall the anti-kingship sentiments of early Israel.59 Elsewhere in the ancient Near East, kingship was regarded in a different light. H. Frankfort remarked in his classic treatment of the subject: "the ancient Near East considered kingship the very basis of civilization."60 Ac- cording to Mesopotamian tradition, kingship was lowered down from heav- en in the primeval era.61 In Egypt the king was a god.62 In Canaan the king was a "son of El,"63 just as the Israelite king of the monarchic era was a "son" of Yahweh.64 This latter usage probably reflects an adoption formula: the king is to regarded as an adopted son rather than as a natural son, but the bond between king and god is still clear. The close relationship between the king and the gods in the ancient Near East is reflected in the treatment and the ideology of the divine image. 56 G. E.

L. Oppenheim commented that in Mesopotamia the divine image "lived the life of a king."65 The image lived in its sanctuary, surrounded by statues of family and courtiers; it was taken on processions through the tem- ple compounds and through the city; it was served its meals in royal style, after which the food was served to the king; it was married to its spouse in elaborate ceremony; in one known instance it was even carried out to the roy- al game park to hunt animals.66 In Assyrian seals and reliefs we often find the king and the god Ashur pictured in identical attire and pose, mirror images of each other, whether attacking enemies or riding in a victory procession.67 The close relationship between the image of the god and the image of the king is an important part of the ideology of kingship in the ancient Near East. The king was regarded as the earthly representative of the gods, and as such the image of the god was a symbol of the legitimacy of the earthly king. The divine image was pictured and was treated as a king, therefore serving as a reminder of the divine authority of the king. Perhaps the clearest indication of the close relationship between the image of the god and the image of the king is a phrase first attested in a 13th-century Middle Assyrian text, the "Tukulti-Ninurta Epic," that described the king as the salam Illil dārū, "the eternal image of Enlil."68 The phrase salam DN, "image of the god," is also used of the king in later neo-Assyrian and neo-Babylonian texts,69 but the meaning of the phrase reflects the common royal ideology of Mesopotamia70 - and, we might add, the common West-Semitic ideology as well.71 The "image of the god" was the king himself. 65 Oppenheim, Ancient Mesopotamia, 193. 66 Ibid., 183-93; see also J.

It is understandable why the images one finds on the cherub throne are either gods or kings. Baal Hammon is a god on a cherub throne; Ahiram and his counterpart in Megiddo are kings on cherub thrones. The iconography of the god is essentially a mirror image of the iconography of the king. The same symbolism applies to Yahweh's epithet, "enthroned on the cherubim." Yet the physical image of Yahweh seated on the throne was prohibited. Why? Because it would have served to legitimate a kingship that had no place in the universe of early Israel. The prohibition of the figure seated on the throne extends in two directions: the rejection of the human king and the origin of the aniconic God. VI The origin of the aniconic tradition in Israel was, I propose, the result of an important shift in the structure of religion and society in the formative period of early Israel. The bias against kingship was distinctive of Israel among the nations of the ancient Near East.72 The prohibition of divine images was also distinctive in the Near East.73 It is perhaps not surprising to discover that these two traits had a common root. The prohibition of the image of Yahweh was a reflection, on the level of religious iconography, of the early Israelite bias against the institution and the ideology of kingship.74 It is a common notion in the social sciences, at least since the work of K. Marx, M. Weber, and E. Durkheim, that social structure and religious structure are reciprocally related; a change in one gives rise to a change in the other. The Israelite innovation of the aniconic God falls into this cate- 72 On the relationship between early Israel and the Transjordanian nations, see G. Buc- cellati, Cities and Nations of Ancient Syria (Studi Semitici 26; Rome: Istituto di Studi del Vicino Oriente, 1967) 75-135; and, more recently, Gottwald, lïibes of Yahweh, 426-34, and references. 73 On the complex stylization of divine representations in the Punic world, see S.

Oden (eds.), De Dea Syria (SBLTT 9; Missoula, MT: Scholars, 1976) 44-47 for Lucian's explanation of the empty thrones of the Sun (Helios) and the Moon (Selene) in the temple at Hieropolis. 74 Note the difference between Keel's view (Jahwe-Visionen, 37-45) and my own. Accord- ing to Keel, the prohibition of divine images is like the prohibition of kingship, since both were reactions against the customs of the "settled" Canaanites; in my view, the prohibition of divine images was, in origin, a natural extension of the early Israelite bias against kingship in its social and religious dimensions.</page><page sequence="18">382 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 50, 1988 gory.75 The shift in the structure of society was accompanied by a shift in the concept of God, of which the aniconic tradition was one manifestation.76 The problems involved in our knowledge of Israelite religion are many, not the least of which is the problem of understanding the distinctive features in Israelite religion in conjunction with the features shared with the other religious traditions of the ancient Near East. The line between continuity and discontinuity in religious and cultic matters is sometimes elusive and often irretrievable. Nonetheless, by taking seriously the relationship between so- ciety and religion, and between social change and religious change, it may become possible to increase our understanding. Religious ideas do not exist in a vacuum, just as political institutions do not exist in a vacuum. Religion and society are both forms of life, and they both imply the world in which they are lived. If, as Blake said, the world is reflected in a grain of sand, how much more so in the bias against a king, or in the prohibition of the image of God? 75 For a discussion of some related theoretical issues, see R. Holte, "Gottessymbol und soziale Struktur," Religious Symbols and their Functions, 1-14. 76 Of course, the prohibition on divine images remained in force after the rise of the Israelite monarchy, the symbol of the ark and the belief in aniconicity having become important elements of the yahwistic cult. The rise of kingship brought about other types of changes in yahwistic practice and belief.
