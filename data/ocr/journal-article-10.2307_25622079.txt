<plain_text><page sequence="1">PAUL WOODRUFF Aristotle on Character in Tragedy, or, Who Is Creon? What Is He? Who is Silvia? what is she, That all our swains commend her? Holy, fair, and wise is she; The heaven such grace did lend her That she might admired be. ?Shakespeare, Two Gentlemen of Verona This is one way of saying who Silvia is, but it does not distinguish between Silvia and any other fe male who is holy, fair, and wise. This way defines Silvia along with a raft of other women by what Aristotle would call their character. Another way to answer the question would be to say she is the daughter of the Duke of Milan, that she loves and is loved by Valentine, whose best friend Proteus also loves her, and that Proteus courts her with this song, which no doubt exaggerates her good qual ities. This way of defining Silvia pins her down; there is only one of her on this account. But this second kind of answer is based on plot, whereas plot and character were supposed to be separate elements in a play. So we may have character-based or plot-based accounts of someone like Silvia. These are the only kinds of answers I will consider in this article. I could have answered the question by saying that Silvia is a fictional character, with a long genealogy in comedy and romance, and I might have gone on to spin a theory about the ontology of fictional characters. But none of this belongs to my project here. I am avoiding the ontological question for two reasons. First, I do not want to beg questions about Aristotle's distinction between history and poetry. History, he says, is about particulars, poetry about universals, and poetry is therefore more philo sophical (opening to Chapter 9 of the Poetics). I doubt that this distinction can be right about playwriting as stated here, and I doubt that Aris totle can really have subscribed to it, all things considered. I need to leave these doubts in the air pending further examination of the issues. Second, I would like to accommodate charac ters from different provenance in a single theory, because characters from different sources typi cally commingle in a play. Prince Hal is from his tory, Pistol is from the fictional lineage of Miles Gloriosus, and Falstaff is from somewhere in be tween. Does it really matter to questions like "Who is Silvia?" where the supposed bearer of the name has come from? She may come from his tory, from mythology, from a poet's fertile imag ination, or even from your memory of falling in love with Silvia last night. If you are going to tell me a story about her, she must meet certain conditions?she must be plausible, for example? whether your story is to be true or false. I have a broad interest in the conditions that theater puts on character.1 For tragedy, if it is to be well writ ten by Aristotle's standards, these conditions are specific. Character is second only to plot in importance, says Aristotle (Poetics 1450a38).2 We should therefore expect him to give more attention to plot than to character, and he does. His account of plot is brilliant and has been fertile for discus sion down the ages. What he says about charac ter, I think, is also valuable, but we will miss the point about it if we think he means what we mean by 'characters.' In what follows, I will distinguish The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 67:3 Summer 2009 ? 2009 The American Society for Aesthetics</page><page sequence="2">302 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism between character or characters?basically, ethical qualities?and the agents who have them. I. CHARACTER AND AGENT Aristotle uses the word ethos, translated "char acter," for the mainly ethical qualities of agents: "it is in view of their characters that the agents are of a certain sort" (50al8). These qualities are reflected from the agents onto their choices, when these have no clear ethical qualities in them selves (50b8).3 He thinks that a good playwright brings out the characters of his agents through their speeches and actions, but that a tragedy can go forward without character altogether (50a24). Certainly it cannot go forward without actions, however, and there is no action without an agent. Aristotle has two related concepts at work in discussions such as this: there is an agent, who has a certain quality of character and who gives a cognate quality to his or her actions, speeches, and choices. In English, we use the word 'character' for both the agents and their ethical qualities, but Aristotle calls the agents hoi prattontes and their qualities ta ethe. In this article, I shall adhere to the following usage: For what we would call the characters in a play I shall use the word 'agents.' For the qualities of character that they have, I shall use the word 'characters,' translating ta ethe. I hope this is not confusing. It would be worse to use the word 'character,' as we normally do in English, for both. My main question is this: what is the relation between an agent and his or her character? Some scholars hold that Aristotle takes an agent in tragedy as a type or universal that is defined by a certain character. I shall argue that this could not be an adequate theory of agent and charac ter for tragedy as Aristotle defines tragedy, and I shall try to show that Aristotle works with an implicit theory of agents that is plot based, rather than character based. Character makes agents in teresting and plausible, but it does not make them the particular agents that they are. Now a word about the sort of theory that would be adequate. Aristotle tells us what a good plot should look like. He tells us also (in very general terms) what character the agents in tragedy should have?they should be spoudaioi?that is, good, but not perfect, striving for virtue.4 Later he will give us more specific conditions that the characters of agents should satisfy in a well-written tragedy. The prattontes, in my view, are the individuals responsible for the actions of which the tragedy is a mimesis. Some scholars have held that these are the actors, who are supposed to have the same ethos as the characters they represent.5 This cannot be right. For one thing, Aristotle thinks tragedy has its full power without actors (50b 18), while it would be nothing at all without actions. For another, why should the actor playing Creon have Creon's character? He does not have it; he is putting it on. The tragedy gives other things that may have Creon's character, and these are the speeches and actions that the actor playing Creon is given to perform, which may be wise or unwise, courageous or cowardly, and so forth. I shall take it that the prattontes in Aristotle's account of tragedy have the same status as the praxeis of which they are the agents: that is to say, they are objects of mimesis, things imitated or represented (this is clear for praxeis in Poetics, Chapters 2 and 3). The agents have certain char acters (ethe) and, in our modern sense, they are the characters of the play. But who are they? Aristotle will distinguish historical from po etical actions?what happened from the sorts of things that regularly happen (50a36 ff.); in doing so, he will apparently distinguish agents who ex isted as individuals (that is, in history) from the sorts of agents who could exist and are shown in poetry.6 If this is his view, then he takes a tragic agent not to be a person, but a kind of person. I take it that a kind of person is defined by a cer tain character. I shall call such entities "types" (following Alexander Nehamas). Here is a de scription of such a type (I shall apply it later to a tragic agent): "The young, as to character, are ready to desire and to carry out what they de sire. Of the bodily desires they chiefly obey those of sensual pleasure_They are passionate, hot tempered, and carried away by impulse, and un able to control their passion."7 If we were to judge from the Rhetoric, Aristotle would mean that pos sible tragic characters also include the type of old men, the type of wealthy men, the type of powerful men, and no doubt variations and combinations of the above. These universal characters, then, would acquire particular names in tragic plays, but would nonetheless remain universals or types. Lest you think I am setting up a straw man, such a theory of character is defended as both</page><page sequence="3">Woodruff Aristotle on Character in Tragedy 303 sound and as Aristotelian by no less a scholar philosopher than Nehamas.8 It is worth taking very seriously indeed. Sophocles did not create an individual: "a storyteller, like a dramatist, is not said to create persons, human beings, but characters. Characters, together with their settings and situations, are parts of a story."9 Characters, moreover, are one and all not individuals but types? Oedipus does not represent or symbolize a human type he is a human type; his pride does not represent a type of pride?it is a type of pride. Oedipus does not have a (universal) character; he is a character, which we may recognize as (part of) our own. Aristotle was right when he wrote that "what is universal is what sort of thing a sort of person will probably or necessarily do? this is what poetry deals with, though it uses individual names."10 This is an elegant statement of the theory to which I am proposing this alternative: agents are indi viduals, and their characters?which make them interesting and plausible?are universals. II. EIKOS AND ANANKE Poetry, says Aristotle, goes further than history in arranging events according to what Nehamas translates as probability and necessity, eikos and ananke, respectively. Necessity plays a mere walk on role here, so I will concentrate on eikos. The word was famous for its use in forensic oratory, where it means what is reasonable to expect. "It's not reasonable to expect that I would beat up that huge wrestler," you might say when charged with assault and battery on a dark night. "I am puny and weak. Puny men don't attack big lummoxes." That is how it might play out in court.11 In theater, it works this way. For example, in Oedipus Tyrannus (OT), since Oedipus is a tyrant, we may reasonably expect that he will be suspi cious of plots against him and will try to defend himself by violence. That is what tyrannoi gener ally do. True to expectation, Oedipus thinks Creon is plotting against him and informally sentences him to death (OT, line 623).12 But, against ex pectation, Oedipus relents. He is also a loyal and loving husband, and, as such, we may reasonably expect that he would bow to the wishes of his wife. One expectation is defeated by another. Oedipus belongs to more than one type?probably indefi nitely many. Which of those types will make his next action plausible depends on contingencies in the plot. This must be roughly what Aristotle has in mind when he approves Agathon's maxim that it is reasonable to expect that many things will hap pen that are not reasonable to expect (56a24). In tragedy, (for reasons that will emerge) it is espe cially important that agents take actions that are plausible as coming from them. But this does not mean that the audience cannot be surprised. Rea sonable expectations do not determine what an agent with a given character will do; they set a range of possibilities, including some unexpected ones, that an audience will find plausible. The types to which Oedipus belongs?proud center of a success story, tyrannos, loyal husband, caring father?these are all universale But he is not identical with any of them. A last-ditch defender of the character-based theory might propose that he is identical with the peculiar intersection of all the types to which he belongs. That would indeed be a type (even if it had only one member), but it would not be the source of any expectations; quite general types, such as the young man, are needed to set up expectations according to eikos. Suppose, however, that we could generate ex pectations from an intersection of types. A prob lem remains. Expectations according to eikos are defeasible. Each time we become aware of a new type to which Oedipus belongs, we introduce new conditions that stand to defeat earlier expecta tions. For defeasible generalizations, we cannot be sure that we have an exhaustive list of poten tial defeaters. In the case of Oedipus, we do not know at any point that we have all the relevant types firmly in mind. We would probably never be able to identify the intersection of all the types that govern expectations for Oedipus. If we could, then Oedipus would never do anything that defies our earlier expectations; but Aristotle, apparently, thinks otherwise. Yes, poetry depends more on probability and necessity than history does, but this dependence does not require us to think of agents depicted in poetry as universals. So much for the con straints that Aristotle's doctrine of eikos places on character. III. ARISTOTLE'S AIMS FOR CHARACTER At the opening of Poetics, Chapter 15, Aristo tle states four aims for tragic poets in regard to</page><page sequence="4">304 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism characters (ethe): characters should be good, har monious (meaning, suitable), similar (meaning, to us), and consistent. I shall show that an adequate theory of agent and character for tragedy as Aris totle defines it must serve in explanations for at least two features of tragedy: empathy and agency. These are modern words; I use them for the sake of brevity, intending them to carry Aristotelian meanings. I am well aware, however, that they carry a great deal of modern baggage, which I cannot entirely set aside. The four aims fall into groups of two. Two of them reflect the needs of empathy: characters must be good and similar to us, so that we may be able to have pity and fear for them. The other two meet the needs of agency (although this is harder to see): characters must be harmonious and con sistent so that we may be able to construe them as agents for the actions shown on stage. Char acters must satisfy these conditions for another reason as well: tragic agents must act in events that follow each other under necessity or likeli hood (anankaion or eikos), and they cannot do this without satisfying the conditions of harmony and consistency. I begin with empathy. /. Empathy By 'empathy,' I mean the conditions under which we in the audience are able to feel pity or fear about an agent: Aristotle says, "pity is about one who does not deserve [his suffering]; fear is about one who is similar [to us]" (53a5). This condi tion puts certain constraints on character: the one about whom we have these feelings cannot be so bad that he deserves his suffering, nor so good that we cannot recognize his likeness to us. Hence come the requirements for goodness and similar ity (to us). Two problems of interpretation surface imme diately. What is meant by 'about' and who is the "one"?the tragic agent, I suppose?about whom we must be able to feel these emotions? The two questions are related. If an agent is a type, I can not feel fear for him as an individual. Watching my young child totter toward a precipice, I may fear the danger for her, for my particular irreplace able and much-loved child; but suppose I watch Creon set in motion the machine that will kill his son. If Creon is a type, I cannot fear for him; per haps, instead, I may feel fear for myself, in view of our likeness, or for the character that I share with Creon. Nehamas offers a theory of this kind, in order to reconcile the needs of tragedy with Aristotle's account of fear as self-regarding in the Rhetoric: I can imagine what I would feel like if I were in Oedipus' place, with the knowledge I now possess: knowing what I know and also seeing myself doomed to perform the actions he is destined for, I will be very much afraid. This is really an imaginative fear for myself. But it is a fear for myself which is based on seeing myself as someone relevantly similar to Oedipus or, rather, as someone of whom the character of Oedipus is a part. For, as I have argued elsewhere, Oedipus is not a person who has a character but is himself a character, a type, which we may recognize as a type we ourselves belong to.13 What is it like to respond to theater with only self-regarding emotions? King Claudius watches the dumb-show preceding Hamlet's staging of The Murder ofGonzago. His feelings, on doing so, are powerful, and they entirely concern himself. He feels fear and remorse, calls for light, terminates the play, and retires to pray in private?or at least to attempt a prayer. None of this storm of emo tion is about Gonzago in any reasonable sense of 'about.' This is the effect Hamlet wanted, but it is not the kind of effect theater producers gener ally want; they want the audience to be attentive throughout the performance, through Aristotelian desis to Aristotelian lusis, through complication to resolution. What keeps the audience attentive to the staged action is that the audience's emotions are in some sense about what it is seeing. Aristotle does not state the empathy condition as such, but I think his theory demands it: well-written tragedy evokes pity and fear about its agents in a sense that excludes what I will call the Claudius response.14 My emotions as an audience member may still, in some sense, be about myself, but not as exclusively as Claudius's emotions are about himself. As for the interpretation of 'one,' English trans lation inevitably specifies too much. The Greek is simply, eleos men peri ton anaxion, phobos de peri ton homalon. The definite article in 'the un deserving' and 'the similar' is masculine singular and would seem to pick out a person. But it does not pick out a particular person; these are not definite descriptions. They work more like quan tifiers, "someone who is similar." Nehamas could</page><page sequence="5">Woodruff Aristotle on Character in Tragedy 305 reasonably suppose that they pick out types, rather than ranging over individual persons. We use the word 'empathy' these days for some sort of emo tional linkage between individuals, but this is not necessarily what Aristotle has in mind.15 Nehamas has a theory that explains how an audience can experience pity and fear about character-types as opposed to individual agents. His theory does strain our usual understanding of emotions, because when emotions are moti vating (as Aristotle agrees they are), they refer to particular situations. You cannot be moved by fear to run from a generic enemy; you would not know which way to run. You are moved by fear to run from this particular enemy, away from him. A defender of the type-based view of character, however, could make this defense: emotions in tragic performances are not motivating, and the explanation for this is that, unlike emotions in real life, tragic emotions have generic objects. I do not find this convincing; tragic emotions do not feel generic. They make me feel like doing some thing in particular, and, when Creon kidnaps his nieces, I would shout a particular thing at Creon, if I were not held back by convention. On my view, emotions in theater are motivating in that they make us feel like shouting or running, but we do not normally take those actions when in the ater.16 The empathy requirement comes down to this: whatever ontological status they turn out to have, agents must be such that we can feel pity and fear about them, and not about ourselves. ii. Agency By 'agency' I mean this: because tragedy is a mimesis of action, someone has got to be shown doing the actions that are presented. Aristotle is quite emphatic that the events of a tragedy are actions and that these actions determine the good or bad fortune of their agents (Chapter 14 is full of action words). It is a failure of plot, he says, to portray intention without action (53b38). What he does not make explicit is that it is a failure of plot to build it around events that are pathemata rather than praxeis, but it is easy to see that this is so. If, of two characters, one acts and the other is acted upon, the active character steals the scene.17 This principle was well understood by the tragic playwrights. Prometheus Bound could have been a play about Zeus abusing Prometheus, but it is not. It is a play about Prometheus protesting against the tyranny of Zeus and plotting his re venge. The playwright rightly chose to stage what Prometheus does, and not merely what is done to him. Prometheus is no less active because his actions consist in words.18 I take it that an action is an event under a causal description that involves agency, and this agency is human, or at least anthropomorphic. The iden tities of actions and their agents are anchored in each other, insofar as they are anchored at all. Part of what it is to be Oedipus in Sophocles' Oedipus Tyrannus (OT) is to discover his parentage. The discovery of his parentage can be identified as a series of actions he takes, against the protests of his wife and mother. This scrap of theory is not Aristotle's, but I think that it is consistent with Aristotle. Any agent then (and not only a tragic agent) must be such as to anchor events as actions. What special conditions must agents satisfy if they are to anchor the actions that a well-written tragedy puts onstage? Agency, I propose, is defea sible: we may reasonably assume that people are agents for the actions they appear to take unless certain defeating conditions apply. Certain con ditions make agency a plausible hypothesis, but these are necessary and not sufficient conditions for agency. We can never be sure that agency oc curs, because we cannot see inside people's minds. I do not think I can even be sure that I myself am an agent in every case. But I can be sure in certain cases that agency has been defeated?as when a person is physically manipulated, insane, or wildly inconsistent in behavior. First of all, a story that treats a person as an agent must not be implausible: it must be believ able that people like this would do things like that in the circumstances. Take a famous limiting exam ple: Ajax goes into a fit of homicidal rage against the Greek commanders over what he perceives as an insult so deadly that he cannot continue to live with the shame of it. Plausible? Of course. Ajax is an honor-driven soldier, and such men are sub ject to great rage when dishonored. His madness is only to be expected; it is, as Aristotle would say, eikos?reasonable to expect, likely, probable. But hear what comes next: in his madness, Ajax mistakes cows for commanders, and slays a herd of cattle. This is not eikos, no one expects this of Ajax, and indeed this madness is not really his. It was given to him by Athena, whose job it was to protect the Greek commanders. Sophocles</page><page sequence="6">306 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism anticipates Aristotle's rule, and puts this scene? which is not eikos?outside the plot, before the play begins. Now I wish to connect the dots between the requirements of harmony, consistency, and eikos, which all have to do with agency. (Aristotle does mention necessity in character, but wisely omits to develop the idea.)19 Eikos in the case of character defines harmony and consistency. Is it reasonable to suppose that a woman is terribly courageous? No, says Aristotle (54a23), apparently because it violates what is eikos (54a34), and this is his illus tration of the requirement of harmony?harmony, apparently, of character with classes of persons, such as women. The requirement of consistency is parallel, and this applies eikos to the relation of character to action. The tragic agent must act, as we would say, in character. So far I am on good Aristotelian ground. The second point is more speculative, but it is sound as a principle of dramaturgy: if you as play wright move a persona out of character, you un dermine the agency of that persona. Tragic plots require agency, because they are about actions, and actions proceed from choice. An audience will not attribute agency to a character unless that character is consistent or harmonious, as we saw in the case of Ajax. When Ajax behaved out of character, Athena had to supply the explanation, which showed Ajax not as an agent, but as the op posite. The events in which Ajax is not an agent must, by Aristotle's rules, be off-plot?reported as taking place before the first event of the tragedy itself. "Have nothing irrational in the events (prag masiri)" says Aristotle, "or, if you must, put it outside the tragedy, as in the Oedipus of Sopho cles" (54b6-8). By 'tragedy' Aristotle means the sequence of events represented from prologue to choral conclusion, excluding those that are re ported from the past or predicted for the future. Miracles and absurdities are to be kept off-plot so far as possible.20 What remains in the plot and in the characters and in the relation of plot to char acter must be in accordance with eikos. This rule is not as tight a constraint as might appear. Eikos is hard to render into English; it is a technical term in rhetoric for what a speaker can get an audience to believe on general grounds of reasonability. It is weaker than our 'likely' and our 'probable'; I usually translate it as 'reasonable expectation,' but this too can be misleading. It is not as strong as Aristotle's hos epi to polu, 'as happens for the most part.' As we have seen, Aristotle quotes Agathon with approval as saying that it is eikos for many things to happen against eikos (56a24). This ex plains his rule for character, which allows agents to be "consistently inconsistent" (homalos anoma lon, 54a27): they must violate eikos in accordance with eikos. Keep in mind that, as the orators use the term, opposite outcomes can be equally eikos in view of the evidence on hand. (That is one reason why they could teach students to speak on both sides of an issue, as is illustrated in An tiphon's Tetralogies.) It must be possible, then, for the same outcome to be eikos and completely unpredictable. Aristo tle is not requiring that the audience be able to infer action from character. What he does require is made clear at 60a26: a writer should prefer what is eikos but not possible to what is possible but not believable (dunata apithana). In tragedy as in rhetoric, the gold standard for what you can get away with is what the audience will believe. Call it fool's gold if you will, but it is a hard standard to meet. Consistency, then, does not require that an agent's behavior be predictable?only that it not be so surprising that an audience would de mand explanations for it from outside of his or her agency, as from Athena in the case of Ajax. Now we see the level of importance that char acter has in tragedy, and why it is so much less im portant than plot. The agent's character does not drive the plot; the plot, rather, consists of events chosen by the playwright from a broad range of possibilities (and even impossibilities) that an au dience could accept as actions of an agent with that character. That is Aristotle's rule, and we have seen why it is a good one. Now that this is clear, however, we see that an agent's character does not tell us very much about him or her. It is time for examples.21 a. Pentheus. Pentheus, the blustering, super masculine king of Thebes, becomes gentle in what may be the blink of an eye; from a firm, command ing stance toward his prisoner (whom we know to be Dionysus), he changes into an obedient follower: Pentheus Bring me my weapons! And you, shut your mouth. Dionysus</page><page sequence="7">Woodruff Aristotle on Character in Tragedy 307 Wait. Would you like to see the women gathered on the mountain? Pentheus Of course. I'd give a pot of money for that. Dionysus Really? Isn't this great passion of yours rather sudden? (Bacchae, 809-13) Does this scene break in half on the sharp edge of Aristotle's rule about consistency of charac ter? Must we believe that Pentheus is overpow ered by the god, or may we think he is making a choice? That depends on how we interpret the scene, which in turn influences the way we would produce it onstage. Three possibilities: (1) On the word 'wait' at line 810, Dionysus visi bly puts a charm on Pentheus, turning a phys ical captor into a prisoner by magic. In this case, Pentheus' agency is defeated, and we no longer see him as an agent; he is, from now on, acted upon by Dionysus. Two undesirable consequences: in the theater, he starts to lose our emotional engagement, because he is no longer really there for us to pity him. In the action, he can no longer go willingly to his own sacrifice, because his will has been taken over. (2) In the second kind of production, we have seen earlier that Pentheus has been trying to suppress a set of common human motivations in himself that do not accord with the values by which he is trying to live: he is struck by his young prisoner's effeminate beauty, resisting it with difficulty, and his bravado has all along been a mask for youthful confusion about sexual identity. Dionysus gradually sets these motivations free, and in this scene releases the deep desire in Pentheus to connect with what is feminine in himself and in his city. Pentheus is now more an agent than ever, and goes willingly into the mountains where he will die. The production has made it seem eikos that he should do so; he is, as Aristotle would say, consistently inconsistent. (3) The third way is to combine the other two. Greek poetry often represents actions as due to dual agency?that of the gods and that of human beings, and Euripides has a way of making this plausible. Suppose we take Dionysus to represent the set of normal mo tivations that Pentheus is trying to bury; then his power over Pentheus, as visualized on the stage, is due entirely to Pentheus' own hidden desires. This way, the action of the god is not a miracle, and the event is plausible in human terms, just as it was on the second approach. b. Creon. Creon appears in all three of Sophocles' Theban plays, although he stars only in the Antigone. He has the same character in all three plays in some respects: his name means 'ruler,' he understands the uses of power, he is sententious in his speech, and he uses ponderous cliches. But there are differences. In Oedipus at Colonus (OC) he is the perfect model of a stage tyrant: he does not listen to others, he tries to achieve his aims through violence, and he tram ples on sacred principles as a result of hubris. In OT he has no opportunity to be tyrannical and at least expresses an admirable distaste for the tyrant's role; in OT he displays a talent for sophis tic argument that we do not see in the other two plays. In the Antigone, he is a complex figure?a constitutional monarch with tyrannical leanings. He summons the council of elders to ratify his de cisions, and he does on two occasions accept their advice; he proclaims that he accepts the principle of rotating leadership. On the other hand, he has the tyrant's fear of conspiracies against him, he is a poor and highly resistant listener, and he shows contempt for the opinions of the general citizenry. What have we here? Three Creons or one? Sophocles' audience would surely have thought there was one Creon, known to them from the Thebaid and from many plays, who could be pre sented with different characters by different play wrights or by the same playwright in different cir cumstances. That is because Creon, along with the roles he plays in the saga of Thebes, is anchored in myth. The roles of Antigone and Haemon, how ever, are probably fictional. (The myth about the unburied dead almost certainly did not mention them.) Creon in OC (staged a few years after Sopho cles' death in 401BCE) has the character-type of a tyrant, but in the Antigone (staged probably in 442 BCE, forty years earlier) he shows this character type only intermittently; like a loose lightbulb in a fixture on a shaky floor, he goes on and off. He is the central figure in the play, and his uncertainty in his role is one of its fascinations. But he is a</page><page sequence="8">308 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism minor figure in OC, and minor figures do not need to be so fascinating. Besides, in OC he is actually at war, and war leaders do not have the same lux ury of second thoughts that leaders have in peace time?even the edgy, exultant, terrified peace of Thebes on the day after the battle that saved it from plunder by Argos. So Creon makes sense as one agent, with a range of characters, of which dif ferent ones are summoned for different purposes. c. Haemon. Haemon, his surviving son, appears only in the Antigone. In his opening remarks and his speech, Haemon is very like his father. Indeed, the father and son speeches are equally laden with bromides, and they are of equal length. The simi larity between the two men goes beyond this: both men will turn out to be quick to fatal anger, un willing to sustain debate, passionate. Aside from these characters he shares with his father, we shall see that Haemon has two clash ing characters, only one of which harmonizes with Aristotle's account of the character of young men {Rhetoric 2.12, see above). In the first half of his scene with Creon, Haemon is a respectful, obedi ent son, trying very hard to be what a great man's son ought to be. This is the character that is, oddly, not mentioned for young men in the Rhetoric. Af ter he has been goaded by the most cutting in sults?after being accused by his father of being a woman's toy?he changes character. Now he is passionate, protective of his honor, very like the young man's type in Rhetoric. Some scholars think Haemon was only pretending to be respectful at the start, but this is unlikely. Young men are not good pretenders; to present him as such would vi olate the harmony principle. The truth of the play is that Haemon changes, and changes in a way that is eikos, under a barrage of insults from his father. Now, what is the best way of saying who Haemon is? His salient characters change, so that he cannot be identified simply by superficial character-type, just as was the case with Creon and Pentheus. But Haemon is not so well an chored in myth. He is best seen as anchored in the plot. If you insist on speaking of types, then let us say that Haemon is the type of young man who does exactly the things Haemon does. Plenty of passionate youngbloods might do some but not all of these things, and so 'passionate' does not fully capture his character. But only one person (in this or any other story) does exactly what Haemon does: delivering a respectful and per suasive speech, following Antigone to her tomb, threatening his father, taking his own life there, bleeding over Antigone's body. Each of these ac tions has its own character, consistent with the others, and harmonious with the sort of person Haemon is. So an account of the characters of Haemon will need to include all of them. If we need to say all of that?and anything less will be too little to capture Haemon?he will be the unique to ken of that type. So it is better not to call Haemon a type at all. IV. PLOT AND CHARACTER Aristotle did not list agents among the parts of tragedy, and he was right not to do so. As we have seen, agents belong to the plot. Character does not belong to the plot, because you could tell the plot (badly) and leave out character. But charac ter helps make the plot believable, and no plot is believable unless its agents have characters that meet the conditions I have discussed here. Aristo tle got character right. To captivate an audience, the persons onstage must be such as to engage the emotions of the audience, and to do that, they need to make the audience believe that they are agents of the actions they represent. This is where characters come in. For Haemon's actions to be plausibly his, he must have a char acter or characters in view of which an audience would find his actions to be eikos. You could leave character out of a tragedy, by making your peo ple take random actions or say only what they are forced to say. But that tragedy would be implau sible, and for that reason it would not engage its audience emotionally. There could be no effective tragedy without character.

Unless otherwise specified, all subsequent references to Aristotle will be to the Poetics. 3. At first sight this seems backward. Choices reflect on character; I can prove myself to be a coward by choosing cowardly things. But Aristotle is quite clear that this is not what he means here (see also 1449b38 and 1454al7-19). Character in an agent, known through that agent's speech</page><page sequence="9">Woodruff Aristotle on Character in Tragedy 309 or action, reveals the character of the choices made. Aristo tle probably means something like this: You and I may be choosing what looks like the same thing?if we both decide to join a rapid retrograde movement during battle. But you are a man of courage, and yours is an act of courage, a tac tical movement leading to regrouping and taking a stand. I, on the other hand, am a weak-kneed coward, and I am doing something cowardly. I am running away. The difference is in us, and this will illuminate our choices. Speech and action, on this or other occasions, will illuminate the difference in us, and a skillful playwright will find ways to bring out our different characters, so that the choices that flow from those characters will be ethically clear. 4. Nothing in this article hangs on this interpretation of spoudaios; it is a controversial matter, but I shall pass over it here. 5. Interpreting hoi prattontes is complex. The word nor mally cannot mean 'actors' in the sense of performers, but D. W. Lucas argues in his commentary (Aristotle: Poetics, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1968) that Aristotle sometimes uses it with this meaning as at 1449b31, 'the visible actors,' and at 1450a21 and 1460al4, whereas it means 'men in ac tion' at 1448al, 23,27; 1450a6; and 1450b4. See his notes on 1448al (p. 63) and 1449b31 (p. 99). 6. Significantly, Aristotle cites Herodotus and not Thucy dides as a paradigm historian. Thucydides says that he dis tinguishes his history from poetry not in terms of general and particular, but with respect to general truth about the human condition: "This history may not be the most delight ful to hear, since there is no mythology in it. But those who want to look into the truth of what was done in the past? which, given the human condition, will recur in the future, either in same fashion or nearly so?those readers will find this History valuable enough, as this was composed to be a lasting possession and not to be heard for a prize at the moment of a contest"; from "History of the Peloponnesian War," my translation, in Thucydides on Justice, Power, and Human Nature (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1993), 1.22. The dis tinction between history and poetry should not be taken at face value. G. de Ste. Croix has shown (rightly, I think) that Aristotle elsewhere must take historical characters also to be types in the relevant sense; "Aristotle on History and Poetry," in Essays on Aristotle's Poetics, ed. Amelie Rorty (Princeton University Press, 1992), pp. 23-32: "if we are to derive episteme from it [a particular action] we have to take the further step of recognizing the general (the universal or the necessary) in the particular," p. 28. 7. Rhetoric 2.12, in Aristotle: The Art of Rhetoric, trans. John Henry Freese (Harvard University Press, 1939). 8. Alexander Nehamas, "Mythology: The Theory of Plot," in Essays on Aesthetics: Perspectives on the Work of Monroe Beardsley, ed. John Fisher (Temple University Press, 1983), pp. 180-197.1 quote from pp. 190-191. See also his "Pity and Fear in the Rhetoric and the Poetics," in Essays on Aristotle's Poetics, pp. 291-314. 9. Quoted by Nehamas from Margaret Macdonald, "The Language of Fiction," in Philosophy Looks at the Arts, ed. Joseph Margolis (Temple University Press, 1978), pp. 424 437, quotation from p. 432. Macdonald's excellent account of characters is consistent with mine: she writes, "I do not think that what they [storytellers] do is illuminated by saying that they write about predicates or properties" (p. 434). 10. Poetics 1451b8-10: Nehamas's translation rightly in serts the word 'individual,' since Aristotle uses onomata to denote particulars. See Stephen Halliwell, Aristotle: Poet ics [in Aristotle, Longinus, Demetrius, Loeb Series XXIII] (Harvard University Press, 1995), p. 60. 11. For an actual use of this kind of argument in a capital case, see Antiphon's defense speech in Michael Gagarin and Paul Woodruff, eds., Early Greek Philosophy from Homer to the Sophists (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 219. 12. All references to the text of Sophocles cite the stan dard line numbers, used in most Greek editions, of which the most recent is Sophoclis Fabulae, ed. H. Lloyd-Jones and N. G. Wilson (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1990). 13. Nehamas in his "Pity and Fear," p. 272. I cannot imagine what Nehamas has in mind in the first sentence; the actions for which Oedipus was destined are not part of the play because they are not part of the plot?that is, of the arrangement of actions represented onstage. What is part of the play is Oedipus's choice to investigate his past in a certain way, and this is not a matter of destiny as the playwright presents it. 14. "In the theater, at least part of our fear is directed at the sufferings of the characters; we fear for them and not, at least not primarily, for ourselves." Nehamas, "Pity and Fear," p. 270. 15. On the variety of linkages that can be considered empathy, see Woodruff, The Necessity of Theater (Oxford University Press, 2008), pp. 165-183. 16. See Woodruff, The Necessity of Theater, pp. 145-164. 17. Nehamas, in "Pity and Fear," takes pathemata in the infamous katharsis passage as referring to the events of the play. This is a possible reading, I think, but it has no parallels elsewhere in the Poetics and is unlikely in view of Aristotle's constant harping on choice and on praxeis in tragedy. 18. Aristotle does distinguish between speech and ac tion; but very little action is allowed on the tragic stage aside from what is carried out through words, and most of the action of the plot is reported by messengers. The same speech may be considered as an action (such as a protest) or as a piece of language (as diction of a certain sort). This is how we should understand the distinction. 19. The only developed example of necessity in character that I can think of from classical literature is in Socrates' first speech in Plato's Phaedrus, where he argues that it is necessary for the lover?in view of the definition of love?to behave in obnoxious ways. No character in tragedy?or in Aristotle's account of tragedy?seems to be constrained in this way. 20. Examples of excluded events are Oedipus' failure to ask about the death of Laius when he married Jocasta (1460a29-30) and (I infer from 1454b2-5) the miraculous future predicted by Dionysus in Euripides' Bacchae as well as the oracle Orestes received before he arrived on the scene in Sophocles' Electra, and so on (compare 1455b6-8). 21. In what follows I offer interpretations of plays about which I have written at much greater length, with citations of other scholars, in my introductions to Woodruff, Euripi des: Bacchae (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1998); Peter Meineck and Paul Woodruff, Sophocles: Theban Plays (Indianapo lis: Hackett, 2003); Meineck and Woodruff, Sophocles: Four Tragedies (Indianapolis: Hackett, 2007).</page></plain_text>
