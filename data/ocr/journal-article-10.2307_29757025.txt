<plain_text><page sequence="1">New Terracottas from North Bactria by Galina A. Pugacenkova The anthropomorphic terracottas of Central Asia represent a specific group among the objects of minor plastic art of the Ancient World. Several main stages of their development can be distinguished, likewise several regions producing different kinds of statuettes. The earliest Central Asian terracotta statuettes date back to the 3rd and 2nd millennia B.C., i.e. to the early bronze age, the region of their production being confined to South Turkmenistan. Figurines of the mother-goddess dominate, representations of her divine spouse are much scarcer. These images are formalized to the extreme, their male or female essence emphasized, likewise their symbolic and magic significance. By the 1st millennium B.C. they disappear, presumably in connection with some fundamental changes in the religious life of the ancient peoples of Central Asia. It was the time when the teaching of the Avesta made its appearance, gradually superseding primitive beliefs of the previous epoch. Some similar process in Iran was reflected by the famous anti-daevic inscription of Xerxes. The revival of Central Asian plastic art takes place in the local 'antique' period. It was stimulated by the inclusion of these territories into the realm of the Macedonian empire, then into the empire of the Seleucids. This period, however brief, produced significant changes in all fields ? state management, diplomatic and business connections and various manifestations of culture. The development of local terracotta types during the period of antiquity and the early mediaeval time likewise reflects these changes. Anthropomorphic terracotta figurines first appear in Bactria ? they were, most probably, brought to Greek colonies founded there from the Hellenistic centres of the Near East. They also could be produced by local craftsmen imitating western patterns. However, as soon as the 3rd-2nd centuries B.C. local types of terracotta figurines make their appearance, answering the demands and beliefs of the peoples of Central Asia. These statuettes were manufactured in Bactria, Sogdiana, Margiana and Khorezm. Each region developed its own style and its own specific set of patterns. Moreover, even within these large cultural regions certain local varieties of some common types can be distinguished, belonging, probably, to different ethnic groups. Unlike the Graeco-Roman world which produced series of 'secular' figurines, objects of art intended to decorate living apartments, in Central Asia these statuettes were made exclusively for ritual purposes. The main consumers of this production were, most tu 49</page><page sequence="2">probably, women, since the majority of the statuettes represent female deities. The study of Bactrian terracotta figurines is far from being completed. Single finds of terracottas were made in South Bactria ? in Balkh, during the excavations carried out by the French Archaeological Mission in Afghanistan soon after the Second World War (*), and at the site of Dilbergin, in the 1970s, by the Soviet-Afghan Archaeological Expedition (2). Much more numerous finds of terracottas were made in North Bactria. Among the earliest finds were those from the site of Old Termez, made by the Termez Archaeological Combined Expedition in 1936-1938 (3). Terracottas from some later finds made at the same site were delivered to the regional museum of Termez. After the War the number of these finds increased considerably due to the survey works started in the Surhandar'ja region by several teams of the Institute of Archaeology of the Uzbek Academy of Sciences ? at the sites of Zar tepe, Hajrabad-tepe, Mirzakul-tepe and Akkurgan (4). Several finds were made in South Tajikistan, among them some figurines and matrices for their manufacture coming from a dump of pottery by the kilns at the site of Saksanohur A considerable contribution to the study of Bactrian terracottas was made by the Uzbek Study-of-Art Expedition (UzIskE) working in the Surhandar'ja district of Uzbekistan from 1960. The sites surveyed by the expedition include Halcajan, Sor-tepe, Ajrtam, DaFverzin-tepe, Barat-tepe, Kampyr-tepe, Budrac and several other monuments. Some of its finds have been published (6).

These are not some primitive Mother-Goddesses of the bronze age, but statuettes of a deity endowed with more complicated functions, may be, even of several different goddesses. Some specialists identify these statuettes with Anahita of the Zoroastrian pantheon ? this notion is very widespread. However, objections to this theory have been made already. First, most features of these statuettes have nothing in common with the image of Anahita presented by the Avestic hymns. Moreover, the Avestic pantheon includes several other goddesses, such as Asi Vanuhi, Spenta Armati. The goddesses Nana, Ardoxso, Oaninda and Um? appear on Kushan coins, among numerous other deities borrowed from various pantheons, but there is no mention of Anahita. There is enough evidence to support the view that not one but several goddesses were being worshipped in Ancient Bactria ? as well as in any other part of the Ancient World. This makes us refrain from any certain identification of the personage represented by terracotta statuettes. Let it be just 'the Great Bactrian Goddess'. The majority of terracottas recently recovered by the expedition are chance finds. Some of these statuettes come from excavations ? in some cases it helps to determine their date. Such dated finds originate from the site of Budrac in the region of Denau, from Dal'verzin-tepe, Cakmak-tepe and Sairak-tepe in the region of Surci ? from the central part of the ancient province of Caganian. Within the 'antique' period the main urban centre of the province was Dal'verzin. In the early mediaeval time the capital was transferred to Budrac ? at that time it bore the same name as the province. Another group of terracottas comes from the site of Kampyr-tepe, west of Termez, on the bank of the Amu-dar'ja (the region of Serabad). Statuette of a goddess (Fig. 1). Kampyr-tepe, citadel, room 76. Reddish ware covered with white slip. Obtained from a matrix. Its back side bears the impression of the concave tile on which it was formed. Elaborately modelled, touched by erosion. The statuette represents a graceful female with plump face (the face itself is damaged). Her hair forms a roll over the forehead with a parting in the middle. She is dressed in a tunic tied by a belt below the breasts, arranged in wavy folds above and in straight folds below the belt. The lower part of the statuette, below the knees, is missing. In her right hand by her bosom she holds a small phial, her left hand is lowered down. The statuette measures 80 x 51 x 15 mm. Its plastic posture and the style of the belted tunic reminds of some Hellenistic terracottas. The hairstyle finds close parallels among the female figurines decorating the rhyta from Old Nisa; similar hairstyle likewise appears in the Early Kushan sculpture of Halcajan (7). The statuette comes from the earliest stratum of the citadel, from the Graeco-Bactrian levels. There is no reason to date it later than the 1st century B.C. (7) M.E. Masson &amp; G.A. Pugacenkova, The Parthian Rhytons of Nisa, Firenze 1982, pis. 9-11, 26-28, 117-118, 122-123; Pugacenkova, Iskusstvo Baktrii..., cit., figs. 140-142, 164. [3] 51</page><page sequence="4">Matrix for a statuette of a goddess (Fig. 2). Cakmak-tepe, surface find. A massive brick-like matrix made of well-baked dense reddish clay, 125 x 73 x 42-34 mm. Its left side is damaged, bottom scarred. It \ttas intended to reproduce figurines of a seated goddess 120 x 36 mm. It is one of the well-known varieties of the 'Goddes in a high cap* common for Caganian. The face is oblong with large round squinting eyes (pupils not represented), relief eyelids, eyebrows starting from the temples and meeting over the bridge of the nose. The mouth is small. There is a mole on the left cheek. The goddess wears a cap mounted with a radiate semi? circle resting on a rectangular basement with pointed top. An arrow-like pendant descends to the forehead. The ears decorated with drop-like pendants are covered by ear-flaps. Her neck is embraced by a necklace made of oblong pearls, below it an oval slit of her tunic is seen with two buttons or medallions by the sides. Folds of her upper garment form a triangle at her bosom, her arms and shoulders are covered with a mantle. Below, down from the knees, vertical folds of her dress are seen. The 52 [4]</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 2 - Cakmak-tepe. lower part of the matrix is missing. While the matrix from Sairak-tepe still retains some Hellenistic features, the Cakmak matrix has none of these ? it belongs to a local type of the Late Kushan period. Similar statuettes of goddesses in high head? dresses were recovered from the Kushan layers of Dal'verzin-tepe (dating in the time of Vima Kadphises, Kanishka and Huvishka ? lst-2nd centuries A.D.; Fig. 3) (8). The face of the goddess from Cakmak-tepe reminds of another statuette which has been found by the expedition at Barat-tepe. It has a similar elongated oval face, circular moles on the cheeks, an arrow-like pendant over the forehead and a necklace. Its hair-style, however, is different. The hair-style of the goddess from Cakmak is similar to those displayed by figurines from Dal'verzin-tepe and Kul-tepe (9), though the statuettes themselves are far from being similar. They have rounded, not oblong, faces; pendants over their foreheads, if present at all, are circular, not arrow-shaped, (8) DaVverzin-tepe, cit., figs. 113, 114, 116. (9) Pugacenkova, 'Novye dannye...', cit.y pp. 103 f., fig. 24; Ishakov &amp; Ishakov, Terrakoty...', cit., p. 164, fig. 113. [5] 53</page><page sequence="6">Figs. 3-4 - Dal'verzin-tepe. moles on the cheeks are missing. May be, we have here a new variety of this popular goddess' image ? her popularity testified by mass distribution of her statuettes and their manufacture not only in big cities of Caganian, like Dal'verzin-tepe, but also at large rural sites. It is worth mentioning that some statuettes of the goddess in radiate crown represent her holding a lute. Obviously, she could bear not only protective functions but likewise embody the divine harmony. In this last quality she could be worshipped by professional musicians ? lute players and harpists in Kushan Bactria being usually women. Statuette of a goddess (Fig. 4). Dal'verzin-tepe, section DT-19/XII. A statuette in high relief obtained from a matrix. Dense buff terracotta. Back side is smoothened, the obverse covered with red slip. The lower part of the statuette below the waist is missing. Massive face, sloping low forehead, large eyes with thick eyelids under arch-shaped eyebrows meeting over the bridge of the nose. The hair style is plain, with a thick knot over the forehead. The goddess wears earrings and a torque-like necklace. Her shoulders are covered by a wide-folded mantle put over 54 [6]</page><page sequence="7">her dress and wrapped from left to right. In her raised right hand she holds a mirror. The statuette measures 85 x 54 x 21 mm. Terracotta statuettes of goddesses with a mirror were especially popular in Margiana (10). They also appear in Kushan Bactria ? there are statuettes from Balkh (n) and a matrix from Saksanohur (South Tajikistan) (12). However, these figurines do not have much in common with the DaPverzin terracotta. The mirror held by the goddess can be regarded as a symbol of fortune or as a solar symbol. The date of the statuette is determined by two moments: the 12th level of the lower city of DaPverzin from which it comes dates back to the Kushan period, most probably to the Early Kushan time. The hairstyle represented, with a roll over the forehead, is no less vital for its dating. In Indian art it appears in the late 1st century A.D. (the statue from Didarganj near Patna, an ivory figurine from Begram). D. Schlumberger noticed that this hairstyle had made its appearance in Rome about 40 B.C. (13); in the reign of Augustus or somewhat later it became known in India, then ? in the Kushan empire, being represented on various artifacts of Roman workmanship imported from the West. The statuette from DaPverzin testifies to the penetration of this pattern from Indo-Kushan provinces to North Bactria and to its dating within the lst-2nd centuries A.D. Three figurines of the same type, likewise coming from DaPverzin-tepe, can be attributed to a single group ? this last characterized by rather careless execution (probably, due to worn-out matrices). Statuette of a goddess (Fig. 5). Dal'verzin-tepe, surface find. Worked up with a knife on the reverse and by the sides. Buff terracotta, obtained from a matrix. Frontal posture, arms bent, hands on the waist. Dressed in a garment with vertically arranged folds and a closely-fitting skirt covering the knees. The head is missing. 53 x 32 x 16 mm. Statuette of a goddess (Fig. 6). DaPverzin-tepe, section DT-25/VIII. Buff terracotta. Obtained from a matrix, its frontal side covered with red slip, the reverse is smoothened. Frontal posture, arms bent, hands on the waist. Dressed in a folded garment and a closely fitting skirt. 80 x 36 x 22 mm. (10) G.A.

Indistinct impression from a matrix worked up with a knife on the reverse and by the sides. The representation is rather primitive: a wide face with large eyes, hairstyle with a fringe, locks indicated by straight incisions. Over her folded garment the goddess has a mantle framed with embroidery. Both the mantle and the undercoat are covered with relief ornamental circles. 85 x 36 x 18 mm. The last two statuettes have nothing to do with the Buddhist complex DT-25 where they have been found in a layer of clay. Probably, they got there with ruined brickwork of the abandoned building when ruins of the sanctuary were being levelled to provide a foundation for some later constructions. It is possible to date them in the 3rd-4th centuries A.D. All three statuettes from DaPverzin reflect the decline of plastic art in Tokharistan in the late antique period. 56 [8]</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 7 - DaFverzin-tepe. Fig. 8 - Budrac. Head of a goddess (Fig. 8). Budrac, Sahristan, surface find. Porous buff terracotta. Obtained from a matrix. Craftsman's fingerprints on the reverse. 67 x 60 x 33 mm. Wide face with a narrow chin, eyes straightly cut, with relief pupils and thick eyelids. Archshaped eyebrows meeting over the bridge of the nose. The nose is low, set closely to small mouth with thick lips. The headdress is composed of two vertically arranged bands holding a hemisphere decorated with horns or a crescent (all these details have got crampled in the process of moulding). The comparatively large dimensions of the statuette and its texture separate it from those manufactured during the Kushan period. It appears to be closer to those male heads which are considered below ? they have similar modelling of pupils which are convex, not concave, and hair indicated by vertical incisions. A female bust found by the UzIskE in 1963 at DaFverzin-tepe likewise presents a very close parallel (14). It is worthwhile to describe it here. (14) Pugacenkova, Halcajan, cit.y fig. 105. [9] 57</page><page sequence="10">Bust of a female deity (Fig. 9). Dal'verzin-tepe, citadel. Buff terracotta, the obverse covered with light-coloured slip. Somewhat vague impression from a matrix, on the obverse and by the sides worked up with a knife. 85 x 65 x 25 mm. Rounded face narrowing towards the chin. Wide eyebrows, large straightly cut eyes with thick eyelids and convex pupils. Small mouth closely set to the nose (the nose is damaged). Headdress in the shape of a double band mounted with two horns and a circle in the middle, set within a thin crescent. There are also some indistinct details by the sides. Round earrings, a wide breastplate with a medallion in the middle. Lapers of the undercoat are seen, framed with embroidery and fringe indicated by strokes. This fragment was found below the floor of a building dating, most probably, in the 6th-7th centuries. Consequently, the statuette should be dated either to the time of its foundation or to the period preceding it. The head from Budrac should likewise be attributed to the same period. Its size, large in comparison with the antique terracottas, can also serve as an argument for its dating in the early mediaeval time. The headdresses of this group of statuettes certainly display cosmogonic features ? a solar disc and a crescent which, however, have lost their regular geometric forms. Among recent finds of the expedition there are several male figurines. These, however, are much less numerous than the female ones. Figure of a deity or of a Kushan nobleman (Fig. 10). Budrac, surface find. Dense reddish terracotta with traces of red slip. A three-sided figure obtained from a matrix worked up with a knife on the reverse and by the sides. 106 x 46 x 25-10 mm. It represents a man standing frontally (the head, left leg and the lower part of the right leg are missing) clad in a typical Kushan costume: a long shirt with folded sleeves, reaching to the knees and tied by a wide belt; it has a kind of triangular flaps by the sides formed by numerous folds. Armlets or cuffs encircling the wrists can be distinguished. The trousers, not very wide, have stripes along the sides. The man holds some massive rectangular object with both hands (left hand beneath it, right on its side), either a casket or a book, with an indistinct device impressed over it. The costume style is characteristic of the Kushan period. It is not of the kind represented on the coins of Vima Kadphises ? a wide-open royal kaftan. It looks more like the dress displayed by the statue of a ruler coming from the Buddhist shrine at DaFverzin-tepe (end of the 1st century A.D.) (15) or by the coins of Kanishka III and Vasudeva (late 2nd-3rd&gt;centuries A.D.) (16). Similar costumes appear also in the (15) G.A.

Fig. 10 - Budrac. reliefs from Sahr-i-Bahlol, Sotorak, Kunduz and particularly in the relief from Buner representing a group of thick-bearded men armed with swords and wearing almost identical garments (17). The three-sided relief of the statuette from Budrac and its high quality (from the point of view of technology) allow us to consider it as being contemporary with the Buddhist shrine discovered in the suburbs of DaPverzin and with its magnificent sculpture, i.e. to date it to the lst-2nd centuries A.D. Since this type is represented in the Buddhist sculpture of Gandh?ra, Mathur? and Tokharistan, the statuette could be an image of a Buddhist donor from the Royal Kushan family. The object held by him remains a mystery ? it might be a casket for manuscripts, for a statute-book or for some sacred texts. At present the statuette remains unique among the terracottas of Bactria.

Dal'verzin-tepe, living quarters, section DT-20. Buff terracotta, a three-sides figurine impressed from a matrix over an oblong roll of clay representing a man standing frontally. His face (its features indistinct) is framed with thick hair cut below the ears. A thick dropping moustache comes into contact with a long triangular beard covered with small incisions. The man is clad in a draping shirt tied by a belt and in wide trousers with horizontal folds. In front of him he has a long sword, obviously in a scabbard, which he holds by the handle with both hands. The handle is indicated by two convex circles. By its type and by its technical features the statuette is radically different from the terracottas of Bactria. Its features reveal its Parthian origin. Its costume, hairstyle, fashion of the beard and moustache find close parallels in Parthian art ? in Shami (2nd-1st centuries B.C.) (18) and in Hatra (lst-2nd centuries A.D.) (19) ? see the statue of a warrior, the royal head and the head of a Parthian noble. At the same time we find similar statuettes ? male figures with swords, displaying similar hairstyle ? among the terracottas from Merv, one of the most prominent East Parthian centres (20). The date of those figurines still remains unverified stratigraphically ? we date them to the 3rd century A.D., to the Early Sasanian period. However, the possibility of an earlier date should not be excluded. The portraits of kings on the Parthian coins allow to verify the dating. Similar hairstyle and long triangular beards are characteristic of several Parthian kings ? from Phraates III to Artabanus IV and Vologases V (21). But the hairstyle of the Dal'verzin statuette appears to be closer to the early Arsacid portraits displaying curly locks arranged in ringlets. This important detail and the size of the statuette, which is comparatively small, allow to date it to the 1st century B.C.-1st century A.D. Nude child (Fig. 12). Dal'verzin-tepe, surface find. Impression from a matrix in high relief over an oval roughly cut piece of clay. Dense yellowish terracotta. Large head, plump face, straightly cut eyes, comparatively low forehead, straight nose and small mouth. A band with pendants runs across the forehead, a necklace, similar in style, decorates the neck. The body is almost nude, displaying the virile member; the only garment is a shoulder belt running from the left shoulder towards the right hip. Both hands are lowered, the right one has distinctly modelled fingers, the left was damaged in the process of moulding. The figurine's (18) R.

Its type follows the Gandh?ra patterns borrowed from Roman art ? so-called amorini, the nude babies of Gandh?ra. In India they used to represent the Yaksas ? embodiments of the spirit of vegetation. In the art of Gandh?ra they appear on Corinthian capitals or in reliefs, carrying garlands, with busts of winged genii or offering-bearers between them (22). The amorini usually have necklaces and armlets for decorations, their hair sometimes tied with a band. However, there are no bands similar to the head decoration of the DaTverzin statuette, obviously reflecting some local fashion. The shoulder belt is noteworthy ? in the art of Gandh?ra shoulder belts usually indicate the Bodhisattvas; however, these last are most often richly decorated and covered with jewels. The statuette represents, probably, a noble child destined to become a Bodhisattva, may be Maitreya, the Buddha of the Future. The parallels drawn and the high quality of the figurine allow us to date it in the lst-2nd centuries A.D. (22) H. Ingholt, Gandh?ran Art in Pakistan, New York 1957, figs. 369-380. [13] 61</page><page sequence="14">Fig. 13 - Cakmak-tepe. A man with a flower (Fig. 13). Cakmak-tepe, surface find. An oblong oval tile with a male figure in low relief impressed from a matrix. Minor details are crampled. Dense ware, light-coloured. The craftsman's fingerprints on the reverse. Trimmed with a knife. 110 x 37 x 20 mm. A man standing frontally within a relief frame. An oblong face, convex eyes with no pupils, relief eyebrows, large nose, some likeness of a small pointed beard covering the cheeks and the chin. The forehead and temples are framed by locks, the ears ornated with earrings. The headdress presents a wide band decorated with large pearls and a wide cap covered with incisions, may be imitating fur. With his right hand the man holds a flower, its petals covered with small cavities. His left palm is pressed to the hip. His dress, closely fitting the torso above the waist, widens below the belt forming suspending flaps by the sides. It reminds of some plated armour: incisions along the shoulders, a rhombic net in a rectangular frame drawn below the waist ? either the armour plates or just textile ornamentation. The legs clad in closely fitting trousers are set apart. At first sight this terracotta reminds of some early mediaeval Sogdian tiles (from 62 [14]</page><page sequence="15">Samarkand and Pendzikent) representing either an armed warrior or a deity (23). The headdress is similar to that represented by one fragment discovered at Afrasiab (24). Its semantics, however, is different. Sogdian terracottas usually represent armed persons endowed with various symbolic attributes: flames, birds, etc. In our case the only attribute is the flower. The statuette depicts, probably, an adherent of some religion, either of Buddhism or Zoroastrianism, unarmed, holding the flower as an offering. His cap reminds of the Parthian ivory plates coming from a wide area ? from Olbia (25) in the West to Hajrabad-tepe (near Taskent) in the East (26). Those are dated in the 3rd-4th centuries A.D. However, there are no direct parallels to the tile from Cakmak-tepe. It should be dated, probably, to the early mediaeval time. Male head (Fig. 14). Budrac, section B/2. Dense buff terracotta. Impressed from a matrix. The reverse is smoothened, trimmed with a knife by the sides. 56 x 42 x 26-10 mm. A round face narrowing towards the chin. Large lens-like eyes touching the temples, with thick eyelids and relief pupils. Eyebrows not indicated. Traces of a drop-like pendant on the forehead. The hair is shown by several rows of parallel incisions; the hairstyle with a triangular cape in the middle. It is separated from the face by a wide cut running from ear to ear. The earlobes are shown, with triangular pendants below them. The nose and the high-set small mouth are damaged. The lower part of the face, down to the neck, is also damaged, but on the right cheek a curved moustache is seen. Judging by the break, the torso was impressed in bas-relief over a flat layer of clay. We have found no parallels to this head. Archaeological and stylistic data allow to date it to the 6th-7th centuries A.D. Male head (Fig. 15). Budrac, surface find. Buff terracotta, light-coloured slip. The head and neck obtained from a matrix apart from the body. There is a hole at the root of the neck, 20 mm deep, apparently intended for a shaft fastening it to the torso. 63 x 45 x 30-15 mm. The face in high relief, almost three-sided, is executed in a rich plastic manner. Oblong straightly (23) C.V. Trever, Terracottas from Afrasiab, Moscow-Leningrad 1934, pi. XIV; V.A.

The mouth is set in a deep-shaded cavity surrounded with plump cheeks and projecting horizontal chin. The nose and the forehead are missing. The headdress is composed of a band decorated with squares cut crosswise and of a wavy line above it, indistinctly modelled. The back side of the statuette is unfinished. The modelling of the face reminds of the Indo-Gandharan style of the Kushan and Gupta periods (27), the headdress is typically Indian (28). This is, probably, the Vedic deity of wind and sky accepted by Buddhism ? Indra. According to the Buddhist tradition Indra expressed his goodwill towards Gautama Buddha by visiting him with his suite and lute-players in the cave of Indrasila. This episode is reflected by several Gandharan reliefs. Its size and its technological features bring the head close to the heads from Budrac described above. It can also be dated to the early mediaeval period. Tile representing a warrior (Fig. 16). Kampyr-tepe, citadel, upper level. Light-coloured ware covered with light slip.

Upon his head he has a closely-fitting helmet with a neck-guard and cheek-plates, mounted with a cone. This last detail has merged with one of the circles decorating the arch, which makes it look much longer. The cuirass covering the upper part of the body is girt by a belt, the lower part being protected by a girdle consisting of two rows of plates ? short plates forming the upper row, long plates ? the lower, almost covering the knees. The warrior wears closely fitting boots and, probably, a cloak ? a wide strap running from shoulder to shoulder was obviously intended to represent it. In his right hand he holds a short sword, in his left an oval shield with a relief device ? a 'thunderbolt'. The tile from Kampyr-tepe has been published without any comments, defined as 'Kushan warrior' or 'Bactrian warrior' (29) its date being determined by its provenance from the upper layers of the citadel. However, this preliminary attribution (29) E.V. Rtveladze &amp; A.S. Sagdullaev, Pamjatniki minuvsih vekov, Taskent 1986, fig. on p. 41; Savcuk, op. cit.y p. 71. [17] 65</page><page sequence="18">is open to doubt. The defensive armour of the Kushans coming from different regions of the empire largely varied (30). Still, there was nothing similar to the military equipment depicted on the tile from Kampyr. At the same time several features testify to its similarity to the equipment of the Roman soldiers consisting of a wide tunic with short sleeves, a cuirass, a girdle of two rows of plates, closely fitting boots (caligae) and a cloak ? this last item usually not worn in battle since it restricted the movements. The Romans were armed with a short sword (about 50 cm long), a pilum and a shield. The reliefs of the mausoleum of the Iulii at Saint-Remy (35-25 B.C.) and the column of . Trajan in Rome (113 A.D.) give accurate representations of Roman arms and armament (31). Their similarity to the equipment of the warrior depicted on the tile from Kampyr is obvious in spite of the distance between the elaborate artistic manner of the Roman reliefs and the crude style of the Bactrian terracotta. By the end of the 2nd century A.D. Roman arms change significantly, which is testified by the reliefs on the column of Marcus Aurelius (c. 180-190 A.D.) and by some later monuments, such as the Arch of Costantine in Rome (c. 315 A.D.) (32). The parallels drawn confirm the dating of the terracotta tile from Kampyr to the period not later than the first half of the 2nd century A.D. and allow to consider it as a representation of a Roman legionary. The oval shield with the thunderbolt-like device should be especially noticed since similar shields occur on the above-mentioned reliefs and on some other monuments, likewise the short sword. Kushan warriors are represented most often with long swords in scabbards hanging by the left side. Naked legs in closely fitting boots are likewise not typical of the Kushan warriors who wore shalwars or draping trousers covering their legs to the ankles. How did the tile come to be found at the Kushan settlement of Kampyr-tepe? Tiles representing deities armed with a club or a trident are known from several finds in North Tokharistan ? these are dated usually to the 3rd-4th centuries A. D. (this date, however, must be verified). But they represent frontally standing figures in completely different attire (33). Trade connections between the Kushan empire and Rome, or Roman provinces, were not particularly close, trade going for the most part by sea-routes through India, hardly involving the regions north of the Hindukush. Only few objects of Roman export can be enumerated coming from the finds in North Bactria, such as the white-marble head of Augustus from Ilan-tepe, a mask from Shahr-i-Gulgul (34), (30) M.V.

The empire of the Arsacids presented a strong obstacle for the development of commerce and cultural contacts between Rome and Bactria. At the same time the north-western regions of Bactria bordering upon the eastern provinces of the Parthian state maintained relations with them, especially with Margiana. These contacts are testified by the finds of Parthian coins at Kampyr-tepe, several of these coins countermarked by some local ruler, and of a silver statuette representing a Parthian nobleman (a silver-plated wooden framework). The history of the Parthian empire was closely tied with that of Rome. We know that in the mid-1st century B.C. after the defeat of Crassus thousands of the Roman captives were transferred to Merv (36). The tile with a warrior could be brought to Kampyr-tepe either from Margiana or from some other East Parthian province, it could be also manufactured by a local potter, may be by one of those orientalized Romans who, for some reason, had come to live in Bactria. This last possibility is supported by a find in the Kara-Kamar cave-complex (on the spur of the Kelif-Serabad mountain range, 80 km from Kurgan-tepe) which has been explored by the UzIskE. There, in one of the caves, a Latin inscription has been discovered, containing the name of Gaius Rex ? may be, one of the Roman legionaries settled in Margiana or one of their descendants. The cave-complex itself is supported to have been connected with Mithraism ? the creed once popular among the Roman soldiers. The terracotta statuettes described in this article give some new material reflecting the religious life of North Bactria (Caganian and Tokharistan in the early mediaeval period) and the development of local artistic traditions.
