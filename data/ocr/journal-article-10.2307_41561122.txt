<plain_text><page sequence="1">Two Religious Ceremonies in Vogue among the Milanos of Sarawak. By the Rev. Fr. Bernard Mulder and John Hewitt, B.A. I. The Pay un Ceremony This important function, known to the Malays as Borayun or Bray une, has been several times described and 'ye are only emboldened to add further to the literature on this subject because as yet no complete account has been written. No doubt the explanation of the imperfections of other writers is to be attributed to the fact that this ceremony is only very rarely witnessed by a European and then not in its entirety : it has, however, been the lot of one of us to be present at scores of Payuns For the relationship of the P^yun to the other religious ceremonies of the Milanos we shall refer the reader to a recent paper on Milano religion by Messrs. Lawrence and Hewitt (J. A. I. Vol. 38, 1908): in which paper too will be found a more complete account of 'Bay oh' and of 'Dakans' than we are proposing to give here. As a general rule, the Payun is undertaken as á last resort for severe illness and sometimes the ceremony is repeated as a kind of thanksgiving feast when the patient has regained good health. We may mention that the Milanos have no medical practice of their own &lt;and it is only within recent years that these people have had acquaintance with Malay or European medicines : now-a-days the Payun is becoming more and more a luxury of the well to do, and the poorer people who cannot bear the heavy expenses of a respectable Payun have perforce to swallow the white man's medicine or to resign themselves to fate.

The dramatis personae of the ceremony are : one, or more usually, several Bayoh of good reputation - a person, male or female who professes to have special power in the world of spirits : the sick person and other seekers after health who may happen to be present : the music makers who enliven the proceedings with the music of gongs of several kinds. The ceremony takes place in the house of the patient: it is usually attended by all the gay life of the neighbourhood, and society sends her representatives to lend their moral sup]&gt;ort. It not infrequently happens that the Payun ceremony for 9, sick person as first suggested by the dream of some interested old lady, who seeks an early opportunity for suggesting recourse to this ceremony to the relatives of the unhappy man. When it is decided upon, all the preparations are effected so that the ceremony can take place at full moon : the relatives and friends all assist in the tedious operations and at an early date they send for the Bayoh who is to act as master of ceremonies. Under the Bayoh's directions, the room is decorated with coloured cloths and with long festoons of plaited palm leaves, whilst hanging from many parts of the room are gay streamers of plaited palm leaves fashioned into fantastic shapes - often of birds. During the actual ceremony, the lights from a hundred tiny candles add to the enchanted appearance of the scene. The ordinary apparatus of the Payun, viz. the swing* the boat, the house and the several dakans are often fa mily heir- looms which have been used many times before, but if these are not to hand, it is customary to borrow from a neighbour, or failing that, they must send for a'tukang' (skilled artisan) in such work. This man's charges are high, for the necessary knowledge belongs only to few, and moreover, the work of making a good boat for instance, occupies several tukangs for many days : the tukang, however, is not a religious person in any sense. The day before the ceremony commences, the Bayoh enters the house and there remains as a guest until the Payun is ended eight days afterwards. When all is ready, the room is furnished as follows: - lour.

It is suspended at each end from a nail in the wall and when not in use is looped up from the middle to a hook on the wall. Dangling from the swing at points not far distant from the two ends are a pair of ornamental tassels of plaited palm leaves in the folds of which are hidden some tiny bells : during the ceremony, these bells are made to tinkle with the vibration of the swing. (2) From a point near to one end of the swing a long and wide ladder called Tago To of plaited palm leaves leads downwards and below passes into (3) the Spatong: this is a square wooden receptacle like a lidless box and it contains four wooden images of anthro- pomorphic shape. (4) A Rabú (or Babong): this is a boat usually eight or nine feet long, well made and gaily painted: the specimen in the Sarawak Museum is ornamented with a fine figure- head of crocodilian shape. The Babu contains as its crew, several anthropomorphic images called 'Sakai' (friends)4. The boat is suspended from the ceiling by ropes attached to each end. Outside the room on the opon verandah there is to be found another Rabu also containing a crew of images. This one, however, is of much poorer construction and is often made from pith of the sago palm. (5) An 'Abun': this is a model house of large size, often measuring eight or nine feet in all three dimensions. It is usually made from good wood and in shape rather resembles a Malayan Mosque. Sometimes there is out- side the house another Abun much smaller and roughly made of sago pith : this contains a few anthropomorphic images. The latter abun is for temporary use only and at the end of the Payun is carried to the river side where it finds its final resting place. R. A, Soc., No. 57» 1910.</page><page sequence="4">174 TWO RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES. (6) Several 'dakans': these are rather large "wooden gaudily painted images of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic shapes. They are supposed to function as temporary abodes for certain spirits, but this only on particular occasions. The dakans ' of the 1 bay oh ' ceremonies are legion (see the above mentioned paper on Milano religion), but in the Payun only three or four are used and being of the nature of permanent furniture, the Same dakans are used on numberless occasions. The ordinary dakans of the Payun are (a) To Jipn (or To Jin), a wooden man, who being provided with a seat on his back functions as a chair on which the patient takes his rest : the head of To Jien is ornamented with spikes on which lighted candles are fixed: below, he rests on a wooden image carved to repre- sent an ikan pari' (a skate.) ( b ) Naga terbang, a crude representation of a flying dragon. (c) Naga Sebalun, also a dragon. The nagas are situated one at either end of the swing. As we have before mentioned, the essential furniture of the Payun is a swing and whether or not one or several pf the other accessories just enumerated are omitted depends on the wealth and influence of the persons concerned. Only in the case of the swing does any idea of sacredness hold: the other articles are merely furniture. On the first day of the function, the people assemble just after sunset and without any formalities take their places in the rooms. The ceremony is opened by the head bayoh who goes up to the swing and lubricates it by vigorous hand rubbing with coconut} oil. Then taking in his hand some yellow dyed rice he throws it towards the four walls of the room, three times each way, waving his magic wand (the inflorescence of an areca palm) and chanting an incantation the while. This done, the main part of the entertainment, which however consists only of swinging, can be commenced. The head bayoh first mounts the swing: he takes a sitting position Jour, Straits Branch</page><page sequence="5">TWO RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES. 175 supporting himself oil either side by resting the palm of the hand and the middle finger on the rotan. When the swing is at rest, the feet of the entertainer just touch the floor, and he starts the swinging by pressing one foot backwards against the floor. He commences by swinging about twenty times in one direction, and turning round on the swing an equal nupiber of times in the opposite directions, all the time he is rhythmi- cally swaying his head and body fçom side to sidè and gabbling through an incantation in th&amp; obsolete Milano language. After he has finished, the patient takes his turn on the rattan, his movements being controlled by the Bay oh who is pushing from behind. Whilst the patient is swinging, the Bayoh unceasing in his incantations, from time to time waves on him the magic wand which passing from the head downwards is supposed to sweep out the spirit of the sickness. When the patient has tired himself out, he usually retires from the swing but not infrequently continues until he utterly collapses in a swoon. In such cases he is conducted to another part of the room and there they have resort to a 'Mingať ceremony. Sitting down by the patient, the Bayoh beats his treasured drum and recites his charms, occasionally sweeping over the patient with his wand or now and then sprinkling rice over his head, and sometimes too an incense burning fire is arranged at the patient's side. When there are no interruptions of this kind, the^ swing is kept on thé move almost the whole time : it is the correct thing for all Bayoh people who may be present to use it and of course all sick people embrace such a favourable opportunity for a cure. As each person mounts the ¿witìg, the head Bayoh offers him a spear the tip of which is for a brief moment received into the mouth of the applicant when the weapon íb at once withdrawn. During intervals in the ceremony when the swing is not in use, the Bayoh places on the rattan an areca inflorescence which is removed each time some one mounts the swing. The movements of the Bayoh when swinging are at first slow, but soon the motion accelerates and the R. A. Soc., No. 57» 19Ю.</page><page sequence="6">176 TWO RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES. incantation becomes louder and louder until at lřtst he is in a perfect frenzy and appears tobe quite demented. The excite- ment amongst the onlookers increases when 'the bells of the swing begin to tinkle, for this is taken to indicate the presence of a spirit in the rattan. Very rarely, the rattan snaps in the middle, a calamity indeed, for this denotes the presence in the room of an angry spirit : and for the patient there is no hope as he invariably dies within a short time. The ceremony is abruptly stopped and the people return to their homes. It frequently happens that the spirits invoked by the Bayoh in his incantation do not respond to the satisfaction of that person: in which case he will mount the swing and loudly invoke the attention of other spirits. This may be repeated several times. The Babu and other accessories of a Pay un have quite a minor part to play. When the patient is so ill as to be unable to stay оц the rattan, he will enter the rabu which is then set swinging by the Bayoh. If there is an abun, the patient and the Bayoh some- time or other, during the evening will enter it and there the Bayoh wilì " mingat." Ás for To Jien, he receives no special attention excepting that the patient often enough makes use of him as a chair: at other times a naga might be thus U9ed. If the patient is a young child who cannot undergo the ordinary swinging, it is usual for the Bayoh himself to swing with bho child on his knee. Occasionally in a Payun, the Bayoh or the sick man himself will don the dress of a savage warrior and brandishing a sword he will execute a war dance, formerly a favourite amusement of the Milanos. This fascinating byeplay is really of a serious nature, for the Bayoh is in combat with the evil spirit which has brought about the sickness. The band which enlivens the proceedings comprises five players with instruments as follows: two large 'Tawak,' two drums anď a set of 'Gelinang* (Eromong of Malays). They Jour. Straits Branch</page><page sequence="7">TWO RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES. 177 play in harmony and have several pieces : they are busy during the whole time of the swinging. The general programme is much the same every night except that on the first night proceedings are shortened whilst on the last night there is a crowded house and the payun commences at sunset and is continued up to midnight. Every night after finishing, the rotan is hung up on the wall and then guests and all are provided with a meal at the expense of the host. The ceremony is not finally ended until escorted by the music makers, the temporary rabu with its contained dakans is taken away from the house to its proper resting place out- side the village at the river side : it is fenced round with stakes . to prevent the boat from floating away at high tide. On one occasion one of us witnessed a curious incident relating to this discarded rabu: a company of young men paddling down stream in a boat approached .the rabu and each youth armed with a sharpened bamboo pointed it with threat- ening gesture in the direction of the rabu and then the whole party fled precipitately and hid themselves; they returned several times only to repeat the same proceedings. An amusing side issue of a payun is that frequently the patient, warned in a dream, sees fit to change his name so that the bad spirit shall recognise him no longer: so during the payun and ever afterwards he is known only by his new name. Some Milanos indeed having experienced a number of payuns have a corresponding list of names to their credit. In his interesting paper on manangism the Venerable Archdeacon Perham tells us that the manang when treating a sick person often has resort to a swinging ceremony called Berua : The manang sits on a swing and rocks himself with the idea of knocking and driving away the disease. Swinging is also performed in three other manang ceremonies, the 1 Betiang garong ' the ' Bepancha ' and the 4 Ninting Ian jan.' And again the manang sometimes undertakes to kill the demon (munoh antu). * In due time the demon is there and the manange themselves enter the room which is quite dark. R. Д. Soc., No. 57, I9IO, *12</page><page sequence="8">178 TWO RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES. Presently sounds of seuffling of clashing of weapons and of sh juting are heard by the Dayaks outside and soon after the door is opened and the demon is said to be dead. He was cheated into coming to plague his victim as usual and to instead of the sick and helpless patient he encounters the orafty and mighty manangs who have killed him. Further they have a ceremony called the 1 Bibandoung api ' (displaying fire) 4 The patient is laid on the verandah and several small fires are made round him. The manangs pretend to dissect his body and fan the flames towards him to drive away the sickness. On a careful comparison of the Milano ceremonies with the account of Sea Dayak religion as given by the Archdeacon it becomes evident that they have much in common. The chief difference lies in the fact that Milanos have specialised in the direction of Dakanism, whereas this is scarcely known amongst Sea Dayaks. Now excepting within quite recent years Sea Dayaks and Milanos have had no relations with each other the former people being comparatively new comers tö this part fo Bornes whilst the latter are often considered as aboriginals ; and their languages are quite distinct. We suppose therefore that the bayoh and the manang with their respective ceremonies have most likely descended from great antiquity and perhaps represent to us the religion of the far off common ancestors who lived in some other part of Eastern Asia. II. The Plato Ceremony One of the most interesting of the religious ceremonies of the Milanos is that known as the Plato. Unlike the Payun a great seferecy is held on the occasion and a Plato is usually conducted in the complete ignorance of Europeans or other foreigners who may happen to live in the neighbourhood. It has therefore never been mentioned in the literature on Mibnos. Jour, Straits ЦгщцсЦ</page><page sequence="9">TWO RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES. 179 This ceremony takes place some few days or weeks after the death of a Milano and as in the Payun the suggestion arises in the dream of an aged friend : in his dream he learns that the departed spirit is short of some necessity of life such as food or clothing. The object of the ceremony is to communicate with the unfartunate spirit and to supply his wants. Accordingly, they send for a Bayoh who has unques- tionable experience in the spirit world and he undertakes to bring satisfaction to the departed spirit. So at an early date, a small party of interested friends assemble in the house just after sunset, and with no display and little noise the ceremony commences. At a Plato which one of us had the opportunity of attending, there were two Bayoh of which one happened to be a 'Batuť (vide infra) - who with heads completely shrouded in a cloth, took up their position side by side on a small mat on which they were to journey along the river ot death to enter the nether world. Each Bayoh had provided himself with a paddle and whilst on the mat he went through the motions of paddling just as if the mat were a boat floating down stream. They talked aloud in quite a natural manner remarking for example on the swiftness of the current or on some overhanging tree as they passed quickly by : the scenery changed, and here and there were hidden rocks of which the one hurriedly &gt; warned his friend : then came an upset with much excitement and awe-inspiring splashing of water - introduced for the purpose - all over the room : but after a while, resuming their journey with nothing worse than a wetting, they glided swiftly down the stream and eventually entered the nether world itself. Here the conver- sation changed and their remarks referred to the departed souls whom ás they recognized, they occasionally accosted. 4 'What an awful wound Igu has still !" and " There goes Mandori as lame as ever." Such were their comments on a few deceased friends whose souls they met. When in this nether world the Bayoh often resorts to conjuring tricks in order to impress the nolookers. For instance he grasps at an imaginary object in the air and produces therefrom some tobacco or sireh leaf. R. A. Soc.. No. 57. 19Ю.</page><page sequence="10">180 TWu RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES. All this occupied about half an hour and by this time they were not far from the object of their search. And now falling down on hands and knees they commenced groping about the room clutching at various object until at last one of them suddenly announced that he had caught the lost soul. This he. securely enclosed between his hands and going up to the nearest relative he clapped the spirit on the head of the latter and to prevent escape, tied over the head a piece of cloth. Thus was effected the most difficult part of the work and all rest was straight-forward. The Bayoh commenced to taiic to the captured spirit whose replies though not audible to the assembly were never- theless recognised by the Bayoh. Quoth the Bayoh, "So sorry to see you ill, is there anything we can do for you ? ' or ufWhat sort of a time have you had latterly ?" and the like. Soon the Ba»yoh uncover their heads and the relative is in- formed concerning the welfare of the deceased and is instruct- ed to take a sarong, or a cooking pot or some dollars to the grave. This done, the spirit of the dead will rest in peace. The application of the deceased spirit to the head of the nearest relative isr also followed out during the funeral cere- mony. Just as the corpse is about to be removed from the house the next of kin taking a plate or basket in his hand approaches the head of the corpse and affects to shovel up the spirit pouring it over his own head : this he repeats several times. The alleged reason is that the spirit shall not leave thè house. The Plato is in some degree paralleled amongst Sea Dayaks by a 4 catching the soul ceremony held in cases of obdurate sickness. According to Archdeacon Perham - 4 4 If the patient is apparently in a dangerous state, they pretend the soul has escaped far away, perhaps to the river : and they will wave about a garment or a piece of woven cloth to imitate thè action of throwing a cast net to enclose it as a fish is caught ; perhaps they give out that it has escaped into the jungle and they will rush out of the house to circumvent and secure it thçre ; perhaps they will say it has been carried away Jour, Straits ВрдоЬ</page><page sequence="11">two RELIGIOUS CERËMONÎES. Í8Í over seas to unknown lands and will all set to, and play at paddling a boat to follow it. But more generally the operation is made a more simple one. The manangs rush round the pagar api as hard as they can, singing a not unpleasant chant until one of them falls on the floor and remains motionless : the others sit down. The bystanders cover the motionless manang with a blanket and wait whilst his spirit is supposed to hie away to Hades or wherever the erring soul has been carried, and to bring it back. Presently he revives, looks vacantly about like a man just waking out of sleep, then he rises with his right hand clenched as if holding something. That hand contains the soul : and the manang proceeds to the patient and returns it to the body through the crown of the head muttering at the same time a few words of incantation. ft. a.
