However, some philosophical leverage is required to make such questions fruitful, and I find such leverage lacking whenever the existence of autonomous competing business units is justified a priori on the ground that they exist to satisfy human needs. All human activities satisfy human "needs." Bureaucracies satisfy the needs of the bureaucrats and, to some extent, of the populations in which they flourish. Armies satisfy the needs of their officers and of the governments they support. Gangs satisfy the needs of their members and, to some extent, of newspaper publishers and ambitious state's attorneys. Nothing exists in human affairs without satisfying someone's needs. To endow a justification with an ethical significance, one must ask what needs are being satisfied - the implication being that ethics is legitimately concerned with assigning different importance to differ- ent needs. The loyalty of most Americans is overwhelmingly committed to the present system of autonomous and competing business units. This loyalty seems to have strong anthropomorphic roots. The units are thought of as persons. Just as it seems improper in our culture to ask for a justification of a person's exis- tence (his existence is valued as an end in itself), it also seems improper to in- quire why autonomous business units should exist. Even in our law, the corpora- tion is defined as a "person," though not a "natural" one. The right of business organizations to exist is taken for granted, and only their modus vivendi is open to ethical discussion: how much profit is proper; how much public pressure is proper; what are the correct relations to other organizations, etc.? While bility I concomitant have no doubt with that increasing given a progressive maturation awareness and sophistication of social responsi- - which bility concomitant with increasing maturation and sophistication - which seems now to be pervading the management class - some of these questions may receive "satisfactory" answers (that is, a code may be worked out for business so that it does not violate too grossly certain elementary standards of human decency), these answers cannot penetrate to the fundamental question: must the right to exist be as inalienably assigned to business organizations as it is to "natural persons?" Is it worthwhile to identify with the "needs" of business to such an extent that the above question seems impertinent? Once one has asked the question and pondered on it, then the "ethics of advertising" seems a relatively shallow matter. How ethical can cigarette ad- vertising become to justify the increase in smoking, for which it is probably largely responsible? I am not raising the question whether smoking is good or bad. This is probably a trivial matter. But a grotesque distortion of values 74</page><page sequence="2">autumn 1955 CORRESPONDENCE is not. I am referring to a recent meeting of tobacco manufacturers where a spokesman declared that there is every reason for optimism - since the smoking habit is so firmly entrenched that no cancer scare is likely to make an appreciable dent in it. Ethics cannot significantly bear on the question of the role of business and of its voice, advertising, unless the whole question concerning the foundations of human values is raised. This question can be raised only in an atmosphere of detachment. This atmosphere is particularly difficult to achieve because of our commitments to accustomed ways of life.
