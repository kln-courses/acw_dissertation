Hallo, xii+206 pp, 62 plates. Mainz am Rhein, Verlag Philipp von Zabern, 1994 (= AU WE 19). DM 150,-. The city of Uruk has produced and preserved thousands of seal impressions, mainly on clay objects. These objects can be subdivided into three categories: bullae, clay tags, and cuneiform tablets. Bullae are spheriod lumps of clay or bitumen with a cylindrical hole through them, varying between twenty and fifty millimeters in diameter, sealed with as few as two and as many as forty seal impressions. These bullae enclosed rolled and tied documents, presumably parchments or papyri, written in Greek or Aramaic. These documents have perished. The clay tags (or: clay medallions, clay seals or appended sealings) are flat ellipsoidal pieces of clay, pierced lengthwise with a string hole, each bearing but a single impression. Wallenfels gives no indication of the function of these tags. They are generally believed to have served as sealings for parchment or papyrus documents,1 but they may also have functioned as sealings for the purses in which money was kept. This money was indicated as 'silver under seal'.2 These purses are expressly mentioned (without reference to the seals, however), in the so-called Raljimesu ar- chive.3 The clay tablets are documents of various kinds (most often contracts) written in cuneiform, sealed with seal impressions on the edges. These seals belong to the principals and the witnesses of the documents. The book under review is a catalogue of 1100 seal impressions on cuneiform tablets belonging to the Yale Babylonian Collection and the collection of Chi- cago recently published by David Weisberg.4 The !)

Bibliotheca Mesopotamica 24. Malibu 1991. Weisberg's catalogue should be consulted with: R. Wallenfels, " BiMes 24 - Additional Duplicates and Joins," catalogue is really impressive and comprehensive. Every seal impression is described, drawn and photographed. In his description Wallenfels gives the caption of each. The vast majority of the seal impressions belong to private seals and are impressions of stamp seals (¡ unqa ); only few come from cylinder seals ( kunukku ).5 One seal impression (No. 1), a cylinder seal with the caption un-qa sa-um-bu-lu šá LUGAL, "a stamp seal, the symbolon of the king," comes from an official seal, possibly the royal seal of Antiochus I. Only one other cylinder seal is incorporated in the corpus, No. 2, dated to 303 BC. All others are stamp seals. The seal impressions are sorted out in eight major iconographie categories as defined by their dominant motifs: 1. heads and busts; 2. full figured humans; 3. full figured anthropomorphic deities; 4. semi-human demons; 5. human-headed and man-faced demons; 6. monstrous animals; 7. animals; 8. miscellany. Wallen- fels refrained from making a distinction between Oriental and Greek motifs, since such a distinction is often hard to make. The glyptic of Hellenistic Babylonia "represents the culmination of a process of mutual influence already well under way in the Achaemenid period. ... The contemporary eastern Achaemenid and western Classical periods are bridged by the so called Graeco-Persian groups of variously mutually influenced styles and motifs" (p. 5). The book concludes with a discussion of several aspects of the corpus; three appendices: I "Zodiacal signs among the Uruk Tablet Seal Impressions in the Yale Babylonian Collection"; II "Index of Personal names connected with seal impressions from Hellenistic Uruk"; III "Sealed Archival texts from Hellenistic Uruk"; a concordance of the texts cited and an exten- sive bibliography. The book is in the first place of art-historical importance, but it is also of immense interest for the student of the archival texts from Uruk. It is an important aid for making a prosopography of Hellenistic Uruk. Individuals can now be recognized through their sealings; new persons from unpublished texts are introduced; the character of their sealings gives information on the trends and preferences in certain families.

J. van der Spek, Review of Weisberg, BiOr 51 (1994) 600-605. 5) After 304 BC the scribes of Uruk began to use the terms quite indifferently and after Seleucid year 17 the designation kunukku (NA4.KIŠIB) disappears altogether, with the exception of OECT 9 49, Rl, dated to 122 SE (p. 3). Note, however, that in Babylon the word kunukku was used for a stamp seal in 311/310 BC (CT 49, 15) already and remained in general usage through the entire Seleucid period, as the tablets published in CT 49 amply testify.</page><page sequence="2">428 Rezensionen There is no space to discuss the sealings more fully. I shall confine myself to making a few remarks. In the list of Occupational Designations mãr banê is explained as "hereditary free-born citizen," but the term designates any free citizen: a slave who is set free receives a " fuppu mãr-banútu ," a freedom certificate.6 ša ultu ^kiništu does not mean "(low status) priest," but member of the kiništu , /. e. the 'temple board' of priests representing (together with the rab ša rěš ãli ša bit ilãni ša Uruk , "the chief of the clerus of the temples of Uruk") the highest judicial and administrative local authority in Uruk.7 If the interpretation of A. C. V. M. Bongenaar of kiništu in Neo-Babylonian Sippar as "the prebendaries of a temple organisation" is correct,8 it may perhaps fit Hellenistic Uruk too, in that it was then a board for which membership was restricted to prebendaries. Šešgallu is now normally read as ajju rabů.9 In the Index of Personal Names a few Greek names, some of them unknown so far, draw our attention. I refer to ma-pùl-lu-ni-su , son of Ka-si-pi- mu-ú-nu , whose other name is Rihat-Ištar (No. 102; NCBT 1970 Rl). This name undoubtedly renders the Greek name Apollonios (not Appollõnous), son of Kaspiõnr1.10 Pi-si-du-ni-si , son of Metrodõros, lůIa- wa[nãyya ], "the Greek," renders Poseidonios. Here we have for the first time an individual who was certainly (considered) Greek, unlike many other Urukaeans, who had Greek names but were mostly indigenous Urukaeans and are sometimes specifically designated as "the Urukaean."11 In sum, Ronald Wallenfels produced an important and useful book, the result of clever and meticulous study and work.

Bongenaar, op. cit., 149f. 10) Ka-si-pi-mu-ú-nu looks like a Greek name, the more so since his son had a clear Greek name, Apollonios. I could not, however, find a good candidate. It looks like Kaspiõn or Kassiopeiõn , but these names are not attested as far as I know. u) Cf. Van der Spek, Hellenism in the East, p. 73, contra B.
