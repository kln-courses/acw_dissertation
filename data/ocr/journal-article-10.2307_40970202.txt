<plain_text><page sequence="1">Citizenship and the Multinational / Corporation m i GEORGE W. BALL 1 have been asked to comment this morning on what has come to be called the "multinational corporation." It is an unfortunate name, neither accurately descriptive nor euphonious, proving only that the economists who insist on this Latinate neologism have little poetry in their souls. In that respect they are inferior to lawyers who, from an occupational weakness for anthropomorphic fancies, invented the happy conceit of the corporation as a person and citizen as though it might be expected to arise every morning and salute the flag. I do not object to this. Anglo-Saxon institutions have had a habit of developing by the fabrication of fictions that have later shed their pretences, and sooner or later we shall no doubt get rid of the practice of treating multinational corporations as though they were sentient human beings equipped with passports and examine them in more realistic terms. The central questions are clear enough. Where does one find a legitimate base for the power of corporate managements to take actions that affect the peoples of foreign states? How do multi- national corporations as economic institutions fit into the anti- quated framework by which political power is now organized? I say antiquated, for no longer does the nation-state even re- motely approach an adequate institutional structure to define the activities of a modern corporate enterprise, while small nation- states are, as economic units, ridiculous. Yet, since the problem could be tackled frontally only by revo-</page><page sequence="2">658 SOCIAL RESEARCH lution - which is repugnant to businessmen - resourceful entre- preneurs sought an easier answer. Always impatient with politics, they have, from the earliest dynastic periods, paid little heed to national boundaries, reaching out with their caravan routes to buy or sell at the earth's farthest corners. Thus it was not surprising that, once the industrial revolution gave meaning to economies of scale, ambitious businessmen should have evolved pragmatic means to free their enterprises from the constraints of obsolete national boundaries by applying interna- tional mobility to all factors of production. Today their horizons are limited only by the limits of the earth - or at least the Iron Curtain. Less and less do they think of markets in terms of small, compartmentalized national areas. More and more they see the world enocomy as a whole. There is nothing new or very remarkable about this. A number of large companies have been operating on a multinational scale for many years. What has incited frantic scribbling in Academe is that the widespread extension of the practice has made colli- sions between two contrasting forms of organization a prospective international problem. Such collisions would seem to be inevit- able, because the managers of great companies and the leaders of nation-states think in different spatial terms. A political leader feels responsible for the welfare of his nation, no matter how small or how inadequate it may be; a corporate management feels re- sponsible for the totality of its enterprise, which may - and often does - cut across many national boundaries. No doubt such collisions would be far less frequent and painful had national governments continued, as in the laissez-faire atmo- sphere of the nineteenth century, to confine their interests and activities to the advancement of empire and the protection of the lives and properties of the citizenry. But, along with the rapid flowering of the multinational company, has come a vast extension and expansion of the economic and social activities of governments. Obviously, the degree to which governments inter- fere in the marketplace varies widely, depending on the traditions</page><page sequence="3">THE MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION 659 and political complexion of a particular country, but a high degree of interference is now almost universal. Inevitably these two developments - the broadened scope of governmental responsibility and the rapid expansion of the multi- national company - have resulted in a competition and, ulti- mately, a conflict of sovereignties. How can a national govern- ment be expected to sit calmly by while an absentee corporate management is able, by its decisions, to affect the prosperity of the country over which that government presides? Who can expect local political authorities to permit absentee managements to in- terfere with national economic plans, create or diminish employ- ment, and, by their decisions, materially affect the foreign exchange earnings - and, hence, the balance of payments - of the country? These questions have, of course, more relevance 'for small na- tions than for large ones, since, if an economy is both huge and diversified, individual enterprise is unlikely to have a major impact on national policy as a whole; yet in countries medium- sized now, though large by nineteenth-century standards, the effect on local industrial sectors may still be substantial, and when the industries concerned are particularly sensitive because of consider- ations of national defense, or even national pride, some govern- mental reaction may be expected. Hosts and Guests Up to this point the concept of the corporation as citizen does not get in the way of serious analysis. The corporate citizen does business outside the country of its nationality by sufferance of the local state, which, in the language Ã²f fiction and fantasy, is the "host government." If the corporate citizen affronts the host, it can - like a human guest - be expelled and, like an innkeeper who impounds the guest's laundry, the host government may confiscate whatever immovable property the guest company leaves behind by processes euphemistically described as "nationalization," "ex-</page><page sequence="4">660 SOCIAL RESEARCH propriation," or - more recently - a gradually increasing "partici- pation/1 There is no doubt that the government of a host country has the power to tax, regulate, expropriate, and expel any company that does business within its borders. The problems arise because it can, as a general rule, control only that part of the company's activities that are physically within its jurisdiction; it does not have the same degree of effective control over the whole of the guest company's operations that, at least in theory, it would pos- sess were the company a local corporate citizen, locally owned and managed. As a matter of rough distinction, it is probably useful to separate the complaints of the governments of less developed countries from those of the governments of the more advanced states, since the ability of advanced host governments to control the affairs of guest companies is necessarily more effective. The complaints of host governments of less developed countries reflect a number of grievances. One grievance arises from the fact that the managements of multinational companies are likely to command greater resources and to be more sophisticated than the governments of poor na- tions; and, because such companies operate over wider geographi- cal areas, they have more options. Consider, for example, intra- corporate pricing and costing. To a considerable extent a large integrated company can control the amounts of money it earns in a host country by manipulating the prices it charges the local subsidiary for its products and the costs it allocates to it. Thus, by controlling transfer prices the management can, within limits, determine its own base for local taxation and even avoid exchange controls and efforts to limit repatriation. Though the host govern- ment can insist on seeing the books of the local subsidiary, it can- not examine the books of the parent, and, even if it could, it would not have the highly trained manpower to make informed realloca- tions of earnings and costs. Yet that is only one of the complaints that result from the fact</page><page sequence="5">THE MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION 661 that the affairs of the guest company are controlled by an absentee management located outside the host country which, in deploying its resources, has, within limits, the ability to pick and choose among tax systems and national regulations. So long as the host country has jurisdiction merely over the part of the company's activities within its borders and does not have jurisdiction over the company's principal profit center, it is frequently at a disad- vantage in dealing with a corporate management that can move its resources about flexibly. Still, the stereotype of the giant company playing fast and loose with the efforts of a host country to control it requires substantial qualification in the light of recent experience. In every case the host country can refuse to permit a guest com- pany to perform certain types of operations, or even to operate at all within its borders. But, in such a contest, the relative bar- gaining power of the two parties can no longer be taken for granted because the guest company does not always have prac- ticable options. We have seen this principle illustrated by the David and Goliath struggle in the Middle East, where a group of small nations have worked their will on some of the largest and most powerful multi- national companies. As a result of the comparatively low cost of producing Middle Eastern oil, the existence of a world shortage, and their success in maintaining a common front, the Middle Eastern governments have been able to exact exorbitant revenues from, and impose exorbitant conditions on, the major interna- tional oil companies, to the point of compelling them to serve as political instruments for enforcing an embargo against their own domiciliary country as though their tanker fleets were part of the Arab navy. To be sure, the situation will not often occur where small states can exact such high tribute. The basic requirement is the pos- session of some unique quality of soil or subsoil that yields an essential commodity in world demand - whether mineral or agri-</page><page sequence="6">662 SOCIAL RESEARCH cultural - and so denies the foreign corporate citizen the option to go elsewhere. Thus the central question - whether a poor country possesses the essential bargaining chips - depends more on the interplay of markets and resources than on any inherent limitations on the jurisdictional reach of its government. It is a question that affects a whole range of relations, not merely those between multinational corporations and national governments but between the govern- ments of rich and poor countries. For years the less developed countries have been complaining of an alleged secular trend in the terms of trade against the interests of raw material producers, while they have insistently demanded a preferential position in the markets of the industrialized nations. Since the test of bargaining strength against the multinational company derives from economic factors, the decisive issue is not whether the less developed country is the domicile or merely the host of the company. The bargaining strength of the multina- tional company depends on its mobility. If it can afford to aban- don operations in a particular country, it can move its domicile and headquarters almost as easily as it can redeploy its other assets and activities. Efforts of national governments to respond by expropriating properties or dictating the conditions of production under systems of national planning are in either care more likely to result in the impoverishment of the country than in stimulat- ing a great leap forward. It would serve little purpose, therefore, to try to extend the jurisdiction of host governments to reach or influence the activi- ties of corporations outside their borders. Nor would it be at all practicable. If each host government were to try independently to reallocate the costs and income of a guest company so as to maximize the revenues it could reach by taxes or to insist that the company locate a substantial part of its research and development activities or conduct a high percentage of fabricating operations within its boundaries, the company could be hopelessly crippled by conflicting and contradictory pressures.</page><page sequence="7">THE MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION 663 One parenthesis may be useful at this point. If some think I am expressing excessive solicitude for the multinational corpora- tion, it is not from any ideological bias. I see no greater virtue in corporate managements than government bureaucracies - in fact, no inherent virtue in either. They are merely two forms of organizing mankind's energies that have so far survived Huxley's social Darwinism. But, just as I believe that the nation-state - at our present level of political evolution - is an indispensable insti- tutional form, so it seems to me that the organization of economic activities through multinational companies offers values well worth preserving. Simplistic as the concept may seem to some - and that is the currently fashionable term of denigration - the multina- tional company does provide the best mechanism anyone has so far suggested for utilizing the world's resources efficiently by mak- ing possible their flexible deployment freely throughout world markets in accordance with the objective standard of comparative advantage. Though I recognize that Adam Smith's reverence for the world- wide division of labor is no longer shared by those who believe it perpetuates injustices, the correction of those injustices is not likely to be achieved by action at the local level. Again, our own experience may have some relevance, for the states did little to correct the disparities in wealth between the rich and poorer sec- tions of the country. That correction got under way in the recent postwar years only when industry took advantage of the mobility made possible by a vast free market to exploit certain natural ad- vantages the South then offered - and, at roughly the same time, the Federal government undertook practical programs to improve income distribution among the several states. So far we have made only token efforts at the international level to narrow the gulf between rich and poor nations - or at least to keep it from widening more swiftly than would otherwise be the case. We have transferred resources from the public sector through the World Bank and its affiliates, some agencies of the United Nations, and a few regional development banks, but that</page><page sequence="8">664 SOCIAL RESEARCH is only scratching the surface of the problem. The day when we will make a frontal assault with sufficient scope and magnitude appears far in the future. Meanwhile indiscriminate local interference with the operation of multinational corporations seems likely to do more harm than good. To be sure, there are many who contend that the develop- ment of the multinational corporation is more likely to encourage oligopoly than competition and that such companies do not achieve the efficiencies I have suggested. Managements, it is pointed out, may, in some cases, be influenced by considerations other than the pure profit motive - which, of course, could be par- tially the case. Admittedly, the multinational corporation, as I have described it for purposes of this discussion, is more arche- typal than real. No serious observer would contend that the man- agements of most multinational companies have yet developed that refinement of thought where they consciously weave their corporate plans on the seamless web of something called the world economy. But the point is that many are moving in that direction, and, unless resurgent nationalism interrupts the process, they will approach progressively closer to that ideal. Small poor nations cannot prevent the creation of international oligopolies by national laws, even if they regarded the creation of free competition as a good thing - which most of them manifestly do not - while interference at the local level is more likely to result in distortions and inefficient resource use than make the poor richer. For, if multinational companies have not yet achieved the ultimate goal of operating with full efficiency within the world market, it is - in part at least - because the governments of nation- states have created rigidities and obstructions, seeking, all too often, to force the multinational companies to conform to the procrustean limitations of small national markets. That is not a very useful endeavor. My heart is not lifted at the prospect of a map speckled with small, medium-sized, and large autarkies that would waste resources deplorably. Nor can a worldwide division of labor be achieved merely by permitting the free movement of</page><page sequence="9">THE MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION 665 goods unless the other factors of production are also permitted to move freely. The American Parallel Here, I think, we might, one further time, take instructions from our own national experience, for, by a rare combination of foresight and pragmatism, our progenitors created the conditions that made it possible to organize business on a continentwide basis. Accident no doubt played a role, for, even by the end of the American Revolution, it was not yet foreordained that the strag- gling states along the east coast would develop as a single economy; in fact, certain of those states were already betraying mercantilist habits. If a farmer carted cordwood to New York, he was stopped at the state line and made to pay duty; if he barged a load of pigs across the Hudson from New York, he had to pay a tariff on his cargo to reach the Jersey shore. The key provisions of the constitution that put an end to local protectionism were the clause that prohibited the states from lay- ing duties or imposts on imports or exports, and another that dele- gated to the Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce - a power which the Supreme Court by a long series of decisions was to elaborate and expand to meet the needs of a developing continent. Thus, by forbidding the states to interfere with the nationwide growth of enterprise, the young lawyer-politicians con- vened in Philadelphia prepared America for the explosive expan- sion that accompanied the wide use of machinery. Once the Civil War had fractured old patterns, freewheeling entrepreneurs struck out with energy and confidence to supply the burgeoning needs of an expanding nation, and by the end of the nineteenth century America was quite prepared to challenge the older industry of Europe on its own territory. Indeed, we find a British writer as early as 1901 already bewailing the "American invasion." European industrialists, by contrast, had no great free market</page><page sequence="10">666 SOCIAL RESEARCH in which to expand, while only a few European companies dis- played the vigor and foresight to establish sources of production outside their home countries. It was inevitable, therefore, that American firms with a wide continent in which to operate and maneuver should learn concepts of scale and magnitude far ex- ceeding those common in European business. Obviously, the American parallel has only limited application for our present-day predicament, since there is no such thing as a world government to match our federal system - nor is there likely to be one until, in Chairman Khrushchev's immortal phrase, "shrimps learn to whistle." Yet, as the nine nations of the Eu- ropean Economic Community have already demonstrated, it is possible to go far down the road toward the creation of a continent- wide economy without coextensive political institutions. To be sure, the Community has so far failed to produce a European companies law that would make it possible to establish European corporations, but the delay has resulted more from such irrelevant questions as codetermination than from any basic impediment. There is, after all, a European antitrust law which has begun to function effectively, as well as common regulations in other areas that are communitywide in their application. It is the thesis of this paper that, sooner or later, we shall feel compelled to move in a similar direction but on a larger scale; for, if nation-states are encouraged to impose their own wills on multi- national companies to satisfy local interests, those companies will inevitably be strangled to death. Instead of developing as effective enterprises on a world scale, they may well be broken up into national units not responsive to central management but conniving with other national units under a weak network of relationships that would be more and more likely to take on a cartelist colora- tion. In a characteristic spirit of pragmatism, many American com- panies have attempted to work out their own compromises with national interests by trying to establish themselves as useful cit- izens of host countries in the hope of mitigating the prejudices</page><page sequence="11">THE MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION 667 and fears they might otherwise engender. Most of their thinking has been in terms of protective coloring. Should they take local partners? Should they list the shares of their subsidiaries on local exchanges? Employ local managers? Try to behave as if the company's corporate children were national companies of host countries which only distantly acknowledged their absentee par- ents? Such efforts to achieve a local identity should not, of course, be rejected out of hand, though clearly they are more suited to certain types of corporate activity than to others. Yet, in many cases, the cost of seeking recognition as a local citizen can be excessive. The peculiar genius of the multinational company stems from its ability to view the world economy from a single point of vantage and to deploy resources without regard to national origin in response to a common set of standards. It is the disadvantage of local partners that they are, in a sense, enemies of such mobility, since their judgments are based on benefits to the local subsidiary rather than on the interests of the world enterprise as a whole. Put another way, the scope of their thinking is defined by the national economy rather than by the world economy. This fundamental difference in attitude inevitably produces conflicts over corporate policy affecting a wide spectrum of issues that can be reconciled only through an accommodation of interests at some cost to the full efficiency of the multinational company. Such conflicts are, for example, likely to occur with respect to divi- dend policy. A local partner may wish earnings distributed, while the management of the multinational company may wish to plow them back - or vice versa. Or a local partner may wish particular facilities expanded, while the multinational company management finds it more profitable to sell or abandon them. Finally, the management of a world company may well find itself wishing to serve the market of a neighboring country, not by production in the host country but through subsidiaries located elsewhere. To avoid such conflict we must find a more rational means of compromising the conflict between the multinational company</page><page sequence="12">668 SOCIAL RESEARCH and the host nation, yet that will require us to come to grips with the dubious legitimacy of the power of absentee corporate manage- ments. Where does one find a legitimate base for the decisions of a corporate management that can profoundly affect the economic life of a nation to whose government it has only limited responsi- bility? Ever since the publication in the early 1930s of Berle's and Means's classic study of the divorcement of control from ownership in great industrial companies, Americans have puzzled over the problems of legitimacy in the domestic context. Whence do cor- porate managements (which are in practice frequently self-perpetu- ating) derive the right to make decisions affecting not only the inarticulate mass of shareholders but the economic welfare of whole communities and the pocketbooks of consumers? That question is far from simple even in domestic terms; when translated to the level of world operations, it acquires additional layers of complexity. Within our own national boundaries, an industrial corporation is made responsible not only to state au- thorities but, in its larger operations, to regulatory agencies of the Federal government. For a multinational company, however, the lack of an overriding political entity to oversee the totality of its operations is a major source of weakness. Denaturalizing the Multinational Company Parelleling this deficiency is the fact that, if the nation-state cannot defend itself completely from the irresponsible exercise of power by the multinational company, the multinational company has no means for defending itself against the stultifying power of a host government that can destroy the efficiencies inherent in its multinational operations. In other words, there is no organic arrangement to prevent national governments from interfering with the company's activities in world commerce in the same way that the United States constitution - enforced by the Federal judi-</page><page sequence="13">THE MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION 669 ciary - limits the power of states to interfere with a domestic com- pany's role in interstate commerce. Not only is there a need for some ground rules to limit the inter- ference of host governments in the affairs of multinational corpo- rations, but domiciliary governments should also be under some sensible constraint in employing multinational corporations to extend their jurisdictional reach into other countries. Thus, nothing is more abrasive in international relations than the efforts of one state to apply its laws extra territorially in contravention of the laws and policies of another state; yet the United States has been one of the worst offenders, due in part to the overzealousness of the Washington bureaucracy and our idiosyncratic trade policies with regard to China and Cuba. On all too many occasions we have aggravated our deteriorating relations with Canada by trying to block Canadian subsidiaries of American companies from en- gaging in trade that the Canadian government was actively encour- aging. Even today we are inviting resentment and retaliation by forbidding the Canadian subsidiary of an American firm to sell locomotives to Cuba, or the Argentine subsidiary of a Detroit company to sell the Cubans trucks and automobiles. Finally, the continuing practice of applying our antitrust laws extraterritori- ally has goaded foreign governments to understandable outrage, even though, in that instance, the controlling fact is not American ownership of a company but the relation of its activities to Ameri- can trade. Over the past few years there have been several suggestions for codes of conduct to regulate foreign investment. But they have not made much progress, largely because they have been too broadly focused. Sooner or later we should forthrightly face the need for a better institutional mechanism to adjust the world's interest in efficient resource use through the multinational corpo- ration with the local interests of nation-states. Such an adjust- ment should not prove beyond the wit of man. The experience of overlapping sovereignties is not new. The Roman Church, for example, coexisted with European dynasties for several centuries.</page><page sequence="14">670 SOCIAL RESEARCH To some extent, the problem is complicated by the inadequacy of the forms and fictions in which the issue is presented and the conditioned responses they evoke. When one thinks of General Motors producing the Holden automobile in Australia through a local company, manned and managed by Australians, the idea that it is a citizen of America doing business in a foreign land becomes little more than a figure of speech that gets in the way of thoughtful analysis. An American company goes abroad to make money; almost never does it serve - consciously or otherwise - as an instrument of American national policy. Yet since atavism plays a persistent part in the reactions of nations, people still con- fuse the present with an earlier century when such corporate en- tities as the East India Company were expected to force a British version of civilization on the indigenes. Today our efforts to use the multinational company as a mech- anism for extending United States laws and policies extraterritori- ally are aberrations, while instances where the CIA has employed American companies as covers have been blown up beyond life- size. Though Japanese companies are probably more responsive to the wishes and strategies of their home government, the issue seems more emotional than real. Nonetheless, the fear, pervasive in poor countries, that such companies may become the entering wedge for economic imperialism is a political fact that cannot be ignored. To remove political suspicion and resentment, it has long seemed to me necessary to denaturalize the multinational company, de- priving it of its national character in exchange for some form of supranational citizenship created by multilateral treaty. But my conception is quite modest. I am not suggesting a fed- eral governmental structure at the world level or anything like it. I have spent too much of my life on the exposed steppes of di- plomacy and international politics to have any faith in such an ethereal design. What I propose - indeed, what I first proposed seven years ago in a speech in London - is something far more lim- ited: that we seek to establish by treaty an international companies</page><page sequence="15">THE MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION 671 law, administered by a body made up of representatives drawn from signatory countries. Each company chartered under that law would agree to be bound by its provisions. Each state signing the treaty would accept guidelines limiting it in imposing restric- tions on companies so chartered. The operative standard defining those restrictions would reflect the intention to assure the ability of host nations to defend their national interests with minimum encroachment on the interests of other states, while still preserving the freedom needed to protect the central principle of efficient resource use. In order to qualify for a world charter, a company domiciled in a signatory state might have to meet certain conditions - such as, for example, that it operate in a certain minimum number of countries, that a minimum percentage of its shareholders reside ouside the country of domicile, that its board of directors and its top command be multinational according to some fixed formula, and so on. From the point of view of the world community, the advantage of this approach is that the whole of the corporation's activities could be placed under international surveillance, so that such matters as transfer pricing and the adjustment of its accounts could be artificially manipulated to the disadvantage of any signa- tory state. The inducement to the company to acquire a world charter would be the protection given it against destructive inter- ference at the local level by a host country. In suggesting the possibility of a multinational supervisory agency, I would avoid enmeshing it in the bloc-ridden machinery of the United Nations, or even, in the first instance, attempting to gain signatories outside the small circle of industrialized nations. Like the GATT, it would be regarded primarily as a mechanism for creating a code of rules among the major trading nations, but with the hope that, over the years, it might provide a world charter as more and more of the less developed countries adhered to its provisions. Obviously, this is not a propitious season for spacious ideas but an interlude of flabby governments and squalid improvisations.</page><page sequence="16">672 SOCIAL RESEARCH Thus now is not the time for such a proposal to prosper; nor is anything serious likely to be done along this line for some years. Nevertheless, if we are concerned about creating and preserving an institutional means for using world resources efficiently, some mechanism in this general pattern will probably be necessary. That brings us to a final question - the significance of the multi- national company as an institutional form. Presumably because an article I once wrote was more elliptical than I intended, some critics seem to have drawn the curious inference that, with the development of multinational companies, I expected nation-states to wither away. To be sure, I did suggest - as I have today - that, in its present form, the nation-state is not adequate to meet the full requirements of modern business. I have even applied such disparaging adjectives as "archaic" and "obsolete." But to suggest that an institution is archaic or obsolete is not to imply that it will wither away. Most of the institutions by which men live are archaic and obsolete, since there is a fractional lag between the requirements of a changing world and man's ability to evolve his institutions to deal with them effectively. So, obsolete or not, the nation-state, as I see it, is here to stay - at least for a very long time - though I would hope that improvements can be made to adapt it more effectively to the rapidly changing world scene. What role the multinational corporation may play as an evolu- tionary form, existing alongside the nation-state and perhaps help- ing to bridge the gap to the future, is hard to predict. In facili- tating the mobility of resources, it serves, in my view, a useful purpose and if, nations do find the will and the way to shape coop- erative arrangements for its supervision, these arrangements might themselves contribute to the ultimate design of a more spacious structure. Beyond that, any prophecy seems presumptuous.</page></plain_text>
