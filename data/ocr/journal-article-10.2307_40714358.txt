<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN AMIDA TRINITY Through the William K. Bixby Oriental Art Fund the Museum has re- cently acquired an important Japanese Buddhist painting of early date which gains in interest because of the compara- tive rarity outside of Japan of paintings of so high a rank. It is a representation of the Amida Trinity, painted in full, opaque colors on silk (h. 37^ in., w. 22^ m-)&gt; mounted as a wall painting (kakemono); and comes to the Museum attributed to Tamenari Takuma (circa 1 000-1050 A. D.) an early member, if not the founder, of the Takuma school of painting in the Fujiwara epoch (898- 11 86 A. D.) The composition represents Amida, the Buddha of "Immeasurable Light" (Sanscrit, Amitabha), accompanied by his two principal attendants, Kwannon (Avalokite svara) and Seishi (Mahas- thama), personifying respectively the mercy and the wisdom of Amida. The three divinities are depicted appearing in the heavens as a celestial vision to rejoice the hearts of true believers. They are clothed in princely robes of richly patterned stuffs, with flowing scarfs; and their feet rest upon lotus blossoms that are in turn supported by clouds of stylized, decorative design. In the center, stands Amida, his hands held in the conventional attitude of blessing, rays of golden light emanating from his head. On the right, Kwannon, holding a lotus blossom, welcomes pious souls into Paradise; and on the left, Seishi, with clasped hands, pays homage to true be- lievers. The aspect of the gods, with their delicately pencilled features, - the rounded contours of their faces express- ive of gentleness in every line, - is dis- tinctly feminine, a characteristic of Japanese religious painting that was fostered by the extravagant luxuries and eccentric refinements of the Fujiwara epoch, a period when preferment at court was based upon poetic ability and men painted their faces and vied with each other in the display of luxurious garments. Another element also entered into the feminization of the Buddhist deities in Fujiwara times and earlier, namely, the re-action against the asceticism and hardships of the monk-taught doctrines of preceding ages. Tiring of the terrific struggle for salvation through renuncia- do]</page><page sequence="2">Bulletin of the City Art Museum of St. Louts AN AMIDA TRINITY ATTRIBUTED TO TAMENARI TAKUMA, XI CENTURY [21]</page><page sequence="3">Bulletin of the City Art Museum of St. Louis tion and contemplation, the Japanese people turned to the "easier path," wherein the mercy of Amida supplants the severity of self conquest. Long known both in China and Japan, this development of Buddhism (called in Japan the Jodo sect) achieved in the Fujiwara and the succeeding Kamakura epoch (i 186-1394 A. D.) a tremendous and lasting popularity. The devotees of Amida believed that he had established in the West a Blessed Land (Sukhavati) where those who had faith in his mercy would enter upon a celestial existence. By some the view was held from an early period that Sakyamuni, the earth- ly Buddha, after his decease became Amida, a belief echoed by the following couplet often quoted by the Japanese No Plays: "Once on the Vulture Peak he preached the Lotus Law, Now in the Western Land he is called Amida, ."1 At any rate, entrance could be gained into his happy Paradise through faith - a single prayer might suffice. Here, freed from the pains and evils of earthly existence, the soul might, through count- less centuries of time, evolve into the Buddhahood itself. Through the mercy of the Bodhisattva Kwannon, Amida is always accessible to those who call upon his name: and through the wisdom of the Bodhisattva Seishi, the third mem- ber of the trinity, they are confirmed in strength. Such a doctrine, with its gentle, benign deities, its promise of an exotic paradise, its release from the rigors and hardships of self-effacement, took by storm the populations of medi- aeval China and Japan. The Museum's painting reflects the popular conception of Amida and his attendants as deities of tender mercy and compassion. Amida is calmly be- nign, his expression marked by delicate, spiritual restraint. Kwannon and Seishi are almost maternal in their solicitude as they gently incline their bodies toward the devout. The delicate and graceful style here manifested was an early de- velopment of Japanese art. It was well established at the end of the ninth century, a? may be seen in the beautiful painting in colors on silk of Amida and Attending Deities2 in the Hokke-ji Temple, Yamato. In this painting, the central Buddha still retains the formal statuesque pose and the plain, monastic garb of preceding centuries, though the attendant Bodhisattvas are rendered with great freedom. In the Museum's Trinity, there is an almost complete emancipation from the formalities that often distinguished Buddhist painting even in the T'ang period. The earlier, symmetrical, frontal arrangement of the figures, probably derived from sculpture, gives way to a loosely balanced compo- sition, the lines of which are full of rhythmic movement. The draperies, no longer arranged in stiff, formal pleats, sway gently in the air. The lotus blos- soms that bear the sacred feet also give evidence of naturalistic tendencies. The golden rays that symbolically shine from Amida's head are a concession to ancient iconographical rules; and the cloud forms, with their innumerable scrolls and their forms of anthropomorphic flavor, are clearly copied from archaic models. In this tendency toward naturalness and the humanization of the deities, we are probably confronting the influence of Chinese art of the Sung period (960- 1279 A. D.), for the art of the older civilization was always a potent in- fluence in Japan. The importation of Chinese religious paintings was common, and it is often difficult to distinguish them from native productions. The in- fluence of Sung technique is to be traced in the present example in the modulation of the outlines. The artist has apparently desired to keep them thin and uniform in conformity with ancient convention, [22]</page><page sequence="4">Bulletin of the City Art Museum of St. Louis yet has inevitably yielded in a measure to the expressively varied brush strokes of contemporary painting. There is also probably a reflection of contemporary life in the elaborate and sumptuously patterned robes of the deities, for we read, as samples of Fujiwara luxury, that the ladies of the court wore from twenty to twenty-five gowns, each sleeve a little shorter than the one below; and the men practiced gestures and movements to harmonize with the folds and pleats of their robes! The Takuma school of painters was founded toward the end of the tenth century. It represented a continuation of earlier Japanese art with an infusion of new ideas from Chinese art of the Sung period. Tamenari Takuma, to whom the present painting is attributed, was active in the first half of the elev- enth century. The only well-known sur- viving works by him are the mural decorations in the Hall of the Phoenix (Ho-o-do) of the temple Byodo-in, at Uji3. These were painted about 1050 A. D., on the order of Fujiwara no Yorimichi, the prime minister of the time, and are now in a badly damaged condition. They display a greater nai- vete in the treatment of the faces and a more conventional handling of the drap- eries than the Museum's Trinity. In fact, their general style appears nearer the archaic, but this may have been a conscious reversion. In view of the un- certain state of present-day knowledge, the attribution to Tamenari of the Museum's painting can only be accepted provisionally. The strict requirements of Buddhist iconography produced a uni- formity of style in Fujiwara painting which makes it very difficult to distin- guish the works of different artists. The picture's resemblance to other examples 'Waley, Introduction to the Study of Chinese Painting, p. 126. »111. PI. VII, Vili, Kokka "Gallery of Japanese and Chinese Art." »111. PI. XVI, Ibid. of Buddhist painting attributed to the twelfth and even the thirteenth century, some of them by later members of the Takuma school, makes it safer to assume that we see preserved here certain tradi- tional characteristics of Tamenari's art, rather than his actual handiwork.
