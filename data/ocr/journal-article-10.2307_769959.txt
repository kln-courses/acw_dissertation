<plain_text><page sequence="1">LEONARD HARRISON MATTHEWS 12 June 1901-27 November 1986 Elected F.R.S. 1954 BY SIR RICHARD HARRISON, F.R.S. LEONARD HARRISON MATTHEWS was born at Clifton, Bristol, and was the eldest child of Harold Evan Matthews, a manufacturing chemist who had studied at the London School of Pharmacy where he had won prizes and medals, and Ruby Sarah Harrison, formerly a pharmacist. Known to many as 'Leo', and to others as the intrepid explorer 'El-Aitch-Em', he had earlier in his career been nicknamed 'Matt', and then 'Hyaena' Matthews. He was the last of the great travelling naturalists of his day having visited South America, the Falklands and South Georgia, the Antarctic and the Arctic, Europe and Africa to observe and dissect animals varying in size and diversity from copepods to whales. His extensive knowledge of animals and their habits was incorporated in a long series of research papers and popular books that have already become valued collectors' items. He was never better than at meetings at the London Zoo when talking on animals newly introduced to the Collections or fostering discussion on papers read to the Zoological Society. No laboratory experimentalist, he frequently claimed that the animals themselves performed naturally all the experiments that he would wish to conduct. When in detective mode, and wearing his cape and carrying a swordstick, he always seemed to the writer an incarnation of Chesterton's The man who was Thursday. His sister, Marjorie Violet Matthews (later Mrs Marshall Sisson), born 25 May 1904 in Bristol, was an Exhibitioner at Newnham College, Cambridge, from 1922 to 1925. She read English and Moral Sciences and then became an educational psychologist. She and his younger brother, Bryan Harold Cabot Matthews, born 14 June 1906, and who was to become Sir Bryan Matthews, C.B.E., F.R.S., Professor of Physiology at Cambridge, predeceased Leonard. Bryan was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1940 and Leonard in 1954; thus for a while (excluding half-brothers) they were the only living brothers to be Fellows of the Society. Dr P. B. C. Matthews, L.H.M's nephew, was elected a Fellow 413 14-2</page><page sequence="2">I :j,:: i: ,i--i? --iiii: 3 iiiiii-i ?-d ,-i :ili : ::: ' ; ^-^*^-M " ii i. r CL~ : t:: iS;7; :; 7 :E 0 S: : L E 7: C:::: t:: WA:00 ; i tt X ; ::: E $::: :: h tESt: SE: :: E E t: i@tE::t: 7 n; i 7: ;tz: k ;; 70 0 :; 70 7 id: : E :: titi4SiSt:O 2:: ;j: :E:EA:: tio: O 0; E iEE: i::t b =i</page><page sequence="3">Biographical Memoirs in 1973. The Matthews family lived in the Mall in Clifton where H. E. Matthews had a pharmaceutical factory and a chemist's shop. L. Harrison Matthews was educated at Bristol Grammar School whence he went up, in 1919, to King's College, Cambridge, where he was a College Exhibitioner and later a Prizeman and Vintner Exhibitioner. He was placed in the first class of the Natural Sciences Tripos Part I in 1922 and in the second class of Part II in 1923 and was awarded a Frank Smart Prize in Zoology. He attended an Easter vacation class at the M.B.A's Plymouth laboratory in March 1921 where he met F. S. Russell (later Sir Frederick Russell, F.R.S). He took his M.A. in 1928 and was awarded the Sc.D. in 1937. His daughter writes: 'I do not think that he really wanted to be a doctor. I have heard him say that he went up to King's thinking of Medicine but decided that Zoology was more in his line.' His brother, B. H. C. Matthews (1924), was also at King's College, as were his nephew, P. B. C. Matthews (1946), and his son, John Michael Matthews (1953). His daughter, Jean Dorothy Matthews, later Mrs Christopher Trewhella of Epsom College, qualified in medicine at Bristol University. Early in life Matthews manifested an abiding interest in animals and thereafter in many aspects of animal biology and ethology. He was seldom happier than when engaged in field work. His daughter records that Matthews sent his father lists of birds seen on holiday at Lynton in 1916, and of plants collected at Tintagel in 1917. He also enjoyed writing, wherein he invariably distinguished between the proved and the probable or the hypothetical. He objected strongly to anthropomorphism in any kind. His facile pencil and paint brush enabled him to illustrate many of his works himself. He was also skilled in caricature and in carving. Interested in cars and boats, he helped Bryan build a sand yacht in the early 1930s and himself built a yacht by converting a ship's lifeboat. His foibles included an excessive consumption of vitamin tablets and an insistence on purchasing his spectacles from Woolworths. A skilled photographer, he liked to project films of his travels, interspersed with some of Mickey Mouse and Felix the Cat. His optimistic and jovial personality and his deployment of humorous anecdotes rendered him a delightful companion or colleague. In 1924 he married Dorothy Helene Harris who is reputed by Professor N. B. Marshall, F.R.S., to have summed up her husband thus: 'Leo is too lazy to do anything but work'. BRISTOL AND THE BRISTOL CHANNEL Matthews lived in Bristol for three periods of his life; during boyhood and at Bristol Grammar School, before going up to King's College, Cambridge; during the period between his leaving Discovery in 1929 and becoming an Honorary Special Lecturer in Zoology at Bristol University (1933-41); and during the postwar years (1945-51) when he acted as 414</page><page sequence="4">Leonard Harrison Matthews Research Fellow at Bristol University until his appointment as Scientific Director to the Zoological Society of London. Matthews developed a deep interest in the Bristol Channel, both as a waterway and as an animal habitat. The upper waters of the Channel are no yachtsman's paradise but for years he had been 'messing around there with boats, the returning tide roaring in like an express train could easily capsize and swamp a boat before she floated. But if you knew the way into those little creeks-" pills" we call them in the West-it would be easy enough to grope your ship in and lie up snugly for a tide or two'. He knew all about the Severn 'trows' that used to work up the pills to supply the inland farms. His first publication on the fauna of the Bristol Channel appeared in 1923, when newly graduated (2)*. He noted the common invertebrates collected at Portishead and observed that the Bristol Channel supported a much richer fauna than expectable. He had been to sea on trawlers during vacations and had visited the Faroes, Iceland and the White Sea, and in 1923 he had gone with the Cambridge University Expedition to South America and worked in the National Museum at Rio de Janeiro on the fauna of the reefs at Pernambuco (5). On his return he joined Discovery Investigations and prepared for his greatest adventure (1924) to the southern ocean. Before departure Matthews worked at the British Museum (Natural History) on the Antarctic plankton collected by the Challenger expedition (1872-76). Matthews found among the material a new species of Antarctic copepod (4). He recounted those days in a letter to Dr G. B. Corbet in 1979: 'There was a large shed west of the then new Spirit Building where Stammwitz did his plaster casting and skeletonising, and Bishop did his bird skins. In the lunch hour Davies Sherborn, Pycraft, H. W. Parker and others used to go there for a smoke and gossip round the coke stove. I wish tape recorders had been invented then!' In the autumn of 1924 Matthews sailed for South Georgia (see p. 416) as a member of a party led by Dr N. A. Mackintosh (later C.B.E.) and including Dr J. F. G. Wheeler and A. G. Clowes. Their object was to establish themselves in the newly built Marine Station at Grytviken and initiate research on whales the next season (see Marshall 1979, 1986, for accounts of Fellows who were involved in Discovery Investigations). The only person now living who knew Matthews in South Georgia days is Dr Dilwyn John, who went south with Dr F. C. Fraser (later C.B.E., F.R.S.) in 1926. Dr John writes: 'I saw Matt on the occasions when he came in from the sea. I think that, working alone, he was required to study, among other things, the inshore plankton and was not entirely happy, or satisfied, doing so. I knew him for only a short period but long enough, under South Georgian conditions, to show me that Matt was a good * Numbers in this form refer to entries in the bibliography at the end of the text. 415</page><page sequence="5">Biographical Memoirs companion, humorous and well liked by his messmates. He was one of the few among us who had a song, a "turn", for our guest nights. Matthews sang it repeatedly in after years at Discovery dinners'. South Georgia, and all that he experienced there, made a profound impression on Matthews; for the rest of his life he continued to write about its sea birds, its elephant seals that came lumbering out of the sea up the beach to give birth, its huge whales that he helped cut up and on which he made many useful observations. He was also much entranced by the island itself and soon after his return to England in 1931 published his first book, South Georgia, the British Empire's subantarctic outpost, a synopsis of a history of the island and its ecology, which remained a definitive work for 50 years and is now rare as stocks were destroyed in a warehouse fire. In this book, according to Professor N. B. Marshall, F.R.S., Matthews made the first published reference to Antarctic 'white- blooded' or 'bloodless' fish, also famous as Icefish (Chaenichthyidae), which measure up to 60 cm in length, possess a scaleless body, and lack red cells and haemoglobin. There is in The whale, edited by Matthews (113), a photograph of the RRS Discovery at anchor at Grytviken (p. 163) and another of the scientific staff in 1925 (p. 166). Matthews came back to Britain in 1929 to begin his major reports on his research in South Georgia, yet took an opportunity to visit Iceland in 1931. He was able to complete a report on lobster-krill, one of the principal reasons he had gone south (10). He also joined his brother from 1931 to 1933 in pioneering and developing the oscillograph and electrocardiograph and other scientific instruments his brother had evolved (Clifton Instruments Ltd). On completion of development, the manufacture and marketing were undertaken by Messrs Pye (Scientific Instruments) of Cambridge. He became an Honorary Lecturer in the Zoology Department at Bristol University where Professor C. M. Yonge (later Sir Maurice Yonge, C.B.E., F.R.S.) had been appointed. Dr Penelope Jenkin, who joined the department a year later, writes: 'Matthews was never a member of the teaching staff but had a room in the Department. Almost the only times that we saw him, were when he joined the staff at tea but our small group was enlivened whenever he did so. We all knew that Leo worked part-time in the family firm, somewhere outside Bristol. He did much in those years before the war in conjunction with Professor Yonge to develop the very happy atmosphere that characterized the Zoology Department at the time.' J. A. Kitching (later Professor J. A. Kitching, F.R.S.) was there too and also recalls that Matthews was 'pleasant and cheerful' and had outside business interests and helped his father prepare popular nostrums. His next paper on the Bristol Channel was concerned with the fauna of Denny Island (11), a rocky islet in mid-channel off Portishead, off which he had seen Common seals (Phoca zitulina). His paper incurred the wrath of Major Morrey Salmon, a seal expert who was somewhat scathing (see 31 and 125) about identification of the Denny seals. Matthews himself, 416</page><page sequence="6">Leonard Harrison Matthews originally doubtful about the species, had checked with the British Museum (Natural History) where his old friend Dr F. C. Fraser had proved him right. Next year he described the fisheries on the coast of the Bristol district from Berkeley to the mouth of the river Parret, listing the fish caught (12), and dealing in detail with the various local fishing methods. Matthews describes the 'mud-horse', for crossing knee-deep mud (this sledge is illustrated on p. 288 in The sea shore by C. M. Yonge 1971) and also the 'gull-yellers' who scared away the seagulls (for ?1 a week) and whose yelling at Weston-super-Mare had to be heard on calm days at Congresbury to prove their efficiency. From Mr T. C. Holt of Burnham-on-Sea Matthews learnt about the old apron net fishery at Bridgewater Bay, about the special type of boat ('Bridgewater flat') used, about how the nets were extended on 40 foot larch poles called 'lugs' and raised when fished by a 'crook' that also served as bowsprit and boathook for the flat. This paper reveals another aspect of Matthews's interests, as an antiquary. His extensive library of classical, zoological and other works was constantly in use but individual treatises were valued for their contents rather than their monetary worth. In 1934 he contributed observations on the marine deposits of the Patagonian shelf (13) and went on an expedition to collect small mammals in the south of France and in the French Atlantic Islands. Next year Matthews published an important paper on reproduction in the female mole (14), which except during the breeding season is almost in- distinguishable from the male. He determined simple perineal measurements that enabled identification of the female individuals in a species that at one period in the year appeared to be composed of males only. He wrote that an adult female mole is 'a glandular hermaphrodite or female intersex during the period of anoestrum but during the breeding season it becomes a functional female. The gland (ovary) is in effect an ovotestis in which the ovarian and testicular portions alternate in their activity. While the ovarian part is active and the testicular part quiescent the animal is a functional female; when the ovarian part is quiescent, and the testicular part active, the animal is intersexual, with male facies' (14). His bibliographic scholarship was manifest in his history in 1941 of Steep Holm (28), a limestone island in the Severn estuary, 'it exercises a peculiar fascination for many people', as it clearly did for him. Some years earlier a Severn Biological Survey had been established by the Department of Zoology of Bristol University encouraged by Professor Yonge; Mr R. Bassindale, its main organizer, writes: 'I was shown the estuary on numerous trips by Matthews (often in his car) and we had a look at the various fishing activities peculiar to the Severn. I have always held Matthews in high regard for his enthusiasm in getting things done. A feature was his ability to establish relations with the various fishermen working the nets and traps we visited.' Matthews was assisted by Mr H. Tetley of the Bristol City Museum, 417</page><page sequence="7">Biographical Memoirs in a report on the marine mammals of the Bristol Channel (31). Matthews discussed the difficulties in distinguishing Common seals (Phoca vitulina) from Grey seals (Halichoerus grypus), which are the 'common' seals of the west country and which were recognized at the Bristol meeting of the British Association in 1836 as being part of the British fauna. Matthews poured scorn on the notion that all the Bristol Channel seals owed their origin to specimens released from Bristol Zoo in 1917 because of food shortage. He speculated on the origins of the local names 'spekhugger', 'jubertas', 'gibbero dorso' and 'thornepole', for poorly identified whales (31). Porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) had been described from 1639 and Matthews listed all the known appearances and strandings of cetaceans in the Bristol Channel that he could extract from books, journals and newspapers. In 1941 Matthews found time, despite World War II, to write about the fishes in the Bristol Channel and described the ancient local method of catching fish, given a sufficient range of tide, by means of fixed engines, namely by a Somerset fish weir (32). Then in 1943 he published an account of the Freshwater eel and the ascent of the Glass eels or elvers up the Severn (34), giving the mechanics of the Severn eel fishery with descriptions of prewar eel package for transport alive to Hamburg. Birds and hyaenas Matthews became interested in birds when he explored, as an undergraduate, the roof of King's College Chapel and found a large and varied fauna associated with the pigeons that nest and roost there (1). In South Georgia from 1924-29 he spent much time identifying and photographing the birds of the Southern Ocean (7). There are 13 species of albatross and 9 of them range the southern hemisphere, gliding on the eternal winds of the 'Roaring Forties.' Matthews gave a full account of the very elaborate displays of the Wandering, Sooty and Black-browed albatrosses that occur during and after nesting, and his photographs have been reproduced often. He also investigated the origin of the stomach oil in petrels and showed the presence of groups of oil-producing cells in the proventriculus. The discharge of stomach oil by these birds is partly excretion of surplus fat and it also disposes of excess vitamins and salt (50). Later (1951) he put all the information, legends and stories he had acquired into a book Wandering albatross. Adventures among the albatrosses and petrels in the Southern Ocean (68). It was dedicated 'To all bird lovers, particularly those that love them piping hot with bread sauce Matthews collaborated once with his brother Bryan in a letter to Nature in which they refuted by experiment a claim that owls could see small animals at night due to their retinal sensitivity to infrared radiation (26). In that year (1939) Matthews showed that visual cues in pigeons 418</page><page sequence="8">Leonard Harrison Matthews such as the sight of another bird or its reflection in a mirror elicited egg- laying (27). He wrote later on the effects of external stimuli on breeding cycles of birds (82) and on the nature (probably non-functional) of post- ovulatory corpora lutea in avian ovaries (86). Salt secretion in marine birds interested him in that the Giant Petrel 'always has a drop on its nose' (100). Matthews visited Tanganyika in 1935 to collect material for study of the Spotted hyaena, Crocuta crocuta Erxleben, the taxonomy of which had been bedevilled by claims for the existence of many species and subspecies (24). Matthews was able to demonstrate the immense variability of this species by a series of specimens collected over a small area, which 'contained all the named subspecies, and enough material to describe as many more'. He described the noise made by a hyaena group, containing a female on heat, that rushed about his camp for several hours. It was... 'indescribably hideous. Shrill shreaks and yells, accompanied by deep emetic gurgling and groans, made a background for wild peals of maniacal laughter.... The hair-raising din is indescribable, and is truly horrible to human ears.' Centuries-old legend held the spotted hyaena to be hermaphrodite, of sex indeterminable by external inspection, and capable of changing its sex at will (52). Indeed, the sight of an apparently male animal with much enlarged mammary glands and teats was the cause of even more improbable suggestions! Matthews demonstrated the strangeness of the female genitalia-the absence of a vulva, the presence of a large clitoris resembling a male organ and a pouch-like swelling simulating a scrotum. A true vagina opens into the urethra, so that a 'real' urogenital canal obtains. He recorded the absence in the Striped and Brown hyaenas of such bizarre genitalia and provided information on hyaena reproductive habits, correctly stating that breeding occurs at all times. He noted that despite the narrowness of the urogenital canal in the Spotted hyaena, the young are born in an advanced stage of development whereas in the Striped hyaena, which manifests no unusual genital features, the newborn are 'small, blind and completely toothless and helpless' (22-24). WORLD WAR II In February 1941 Matthews was called to the radiolocation school at Petersham, Surrey, to undertake work of a confidential nature. Much later he described all that befell him in articles for New Scientist (128). Having first to become expert on the complicated gun-laying control apparatus, known as GL, he met Dr N. B. Marshall who writes about those days: 'The number of officers needed to calibrate radar sets, particularly on A.A. gun sites, soon outnumbered the available physicists, so biologists were coopted and found to be adaptable. Peter Rae (another biologist) and I found Matthews very good company during the few weeks of our training'. 419</page><page sequence="9">Biographical Memoirs J. A. Ratcliffe, F.R.S., was involved in these arrangements: 'A group of ten of the best biological scientists were collected and given a twelve week course. Matthews was an outstanding member of that group. They did not ask frivolous questions but enquired about some topic that had not been properly explained. Matthews, like the others, went to live on gunsites and helped to maintain new devices.' Matthews then went as a radio officer to Sir Frederick Pile, in charge of Anti-Aircraft Command, in Matthews's own words 'to soothe radar temperaments'. In 1941 he was directed to the Telecommunications Research Establishment (T.R.E.) near Swanage, Dorset, to work on a new device (CMH) for determining the height at which an aircraft might be flying. He encountered another Bristolian, A. C. B. Lovell (later Professor Sir Bernard Lovell, O.B.E., F.R.S.) who 'never failed to be amusing and stimulating' and who has provided much information given here. In 1942 T.R.E. moved to Malvern College in Worcestershire and Matthews became involved in the testing, development and installation in Pathfinder bombers of H2S (height to surface) apparatus. Long afterwards he described the development of the various high-power microwave oscillators, the magnetron, the klystron and then the resonant cavity magnetron (129). J. A. Ratcliffe, F.R.S., writes: 'Matthews arrived just as design was starting on H2S, a device that could construct a "map" of the ground that could be seen on a radio wavelength. He went, with others, to squadrons where the first equipments were used, and he helped with their operation. The group dealing with equipment that had only recently been designed was called Post Design Services (PDS). Its members lived, as civilians, in Officers' Messes. Matthews fitted into the scheme remarkably well, and there were occasional requests from squadrons for him to be sent to them in person. He was one of the most reliable, and able, members of the group.' Derek Vonberg went to T.R.E. in 1942, was allocated to Group 31 under Matthews, and remembers him as a large, warm-hearted man whose bewhiskered appearance fitted exactly the schoolboy picture of a big-game hunter and explorer. 'He visited us in a huge sporty motor car and kept us spellbound with stories of his exploits. He backed me up, and smoothed things over when I drove a truck across the main ornamental flower bed at R.A.F. Wyton to the intense fury of the Station Commander. But when I dropped an elaborate test oscilloscope he said quite cheerfully, "you broke it, you'd better mend it".' Pilot Officer P.M.S. Hedgeland (now Air Vice-Marshal Hedgeland, C.B., O.B.E.) recalls: 'the boffins', who arrived on our stations with their 'boffin bags' full of circuit diagrams. Leonard spent much of his time visiting us as the early H2S sets and subsequent improved versions always went to the Pathfinder squadrons in the Cambridge/Huntingdon area. My favourite memories of Leonard, or 'Doc' as we called him, are of his arriving in his elegant drop- 420</page><page sequence="10">Leonard Harrison Matthews head coupe in which he would convey us to a cottage in Eltisley for tea with a boiled egg while we listened to the roar of our aircraft on their way to Germany. He was a delightful man who never talked down to us youngsters; we were puzzled at first as to how it took him two days to drive to us from Malvern-until we realized that he called at the London Zoo on the way. I hadn't the faintest idea then of his eminence as a zoologist. In January 1944 Matthews went to Newmarket (where he had never been so cold before or since) to arrange the fitting to aircraft of G-H, a new system wherein the signal from the land stations was triggered by a pulse from the aircraft to give a precise fix. After D-day the H2S work continued and he fitted a new type (H2K, with a wavelength of only 9 millimetres) to Lancaster bombers based at Stradishall airfield in Suffolk. Although this version could show a target in startling detail, it was never used against the enemy as it was unable to 'see' through heavy rain. Matthews claimed that wartime development of radar gave physicists many useful new tools to take back postwar to their laboratories but that biologists were not so fortunate. Yet he was later to write (1971): 'One of the devices carried by aeroplanes was a receiver that warned the pilot when the ground radar was "looking at" him... another way to defeat enemy radar is to jam it by giving out signals to mix with and confuse or blanket the received signals... (118)'. He was fascinated 'that nature had invented counter-measures to the sonar of bats long ago', because certain moths take violent evasive action when "looked at" by a bat's sonar and do what aeroplanes cannot do, namely shut their wings and drop to the ground. Matthews's work with the R.A.F. ensured entry into the Pathfinder Club but he did not enjoy many of his war experiences, tolerating their unpleasantness with his usual good humour and ever alert to their amusing aspects. He was exasperated and amused by the way in which valuable wartime inventions were freely publicized, when 'the most obvious' of all were kept on a secret list. His war work on communication stimulated further investigation of bats after the war (38, 63, 118) and preserved his interest in whale and dolphin sound emission (57, 124). BACK TO BRISTOL Matthews returned to Bristol in 1945 to become Research Fellow in the University, and began to publish papers on a wide variety of mammals. In 1946 he recorded the local occurrence of the uncommon Pine marten (35) and followed this by notes on gibbon genitals (36), the flight of bats and echolocation (38) and on whales and whaling (37). The following year saw a further interest in reproductive studies with accounts of a wild intersexual brown rat (39) and the reproductive organs in tree kangaroos (40). Comments on the mammals of Alderney (42) were followed in 1947-51 by others on swimming in dolphins (43), about whales (45), longevity in elephants (46), extra nipples in chimpanzees (47), hibernating 421</page><page sequence="11">Biographical Memoirs mammals (53) and lipuria in tigers. He wrote two papers (jointly) on external genitalia in gorillas (55, 56), noted the underwater sounds made by belugas (Delphinapterus leucas) (57), and reported on a large Scottish fox (66). These were 'nature notes' put together out of interest while he was compiling more important major reports. Yet they must have helped advance his claims to become Scientific Director of the Zoological Society of London. Dr J. E. Treherne, President of Downing College, Cambridge, was an undergraduate at Bristol University and writes: Matthews did not lecture to us until the third (Honours) year, but I had noticed, and been intrigued by, the breezy, unacademic looking character who, somehow, in his manner and bearing, suggested that he had to do with the sea and ships. As a teacher he was singularly refreshing. He was, for us, unexpectedly friendly and gave us the feeling that we were valued younger colleagues rather than mere third year students. His lecture idiosyncracies amused us; when he could not explain what function a structure had, Matthews would always say-'I don't know what it's for-and I don't think anyone else does either.' This became a catch phrase in our undergraduate year. His practical class produced the unexpected; at each of our places was a large dead mammal-mine was an enormous porpoise-others had various beasts that had recently expired at Bristol Zoo. We were given no indication of what we were supposed to do; we were just told 'to get on with it'. He was totally different from our other teachers. He trod his own path, which had no relation to the current 'fads' of the day, and made us look at animals in a refreshing and unique way-and always there was that curious feeling of adventure. BATS AND BASKING SHARKS The distinguished physiologist Hamilton Hartridge, F.R.S., had returned from World War I to his Fellowship at King's and occupied a room in college where bats congregated on fine summer evenings. Hartridge noted how these bats flew around in the dark and could slip through a slightly open door without mishap: he needed bats for his experiments in a light-proof laboratory and Matthews 'was able to help by hunting up bats for the experiments in the lofty outer roof of King's College Chapel' (116, p. 115). In 1923 L. H. Matthews records in his first scientific paper (with A. D. Hobson) the presence on 7 October 1922 of a Barbastelle bat (Barbastella barbastellus) in the rafters of King's College Chapel (1). He returned to the study of bats during his visit to Africa and after return to Bristol in 1929 investigated British bats. He describes the principles of echolocation in a book The life of mammals (116). The account describes 'radar' and 'sonar' and there is a permanent back- reference to bats. Dogs do not fall victims to vampire bats because they can detect ultrasound and are awakened by the bat's sonar. Matthews 422</page><page sequence="12">Leonard Harrison Matthews raised one, currently unanswered question, namely 'How, when many bats are flying near each other, does each avoid confusing its own signals with those of its neighbours?' (116). Matthews's researches on bats were published in 1937 (17, 18, British), 1941 (30, African) and in 1949 (Leisler's bat at Bristol, 49, 62); in 1952 in British mammals he included two chapters (one on bat biology and the second on British bats), which for succinct, accurate, description are among the best of his writings (72). His bat researches were mainly concerned, however, with reproductive organs and sexual cycles and at the time were new. He noted that the testes descend seasonally into a variously situated scrotum, the tail of the epididymis serves as a sperm reservoir, seminal vesicles and a prostate may or may not be well developed, a urethral gland appears to be peculiar to certain species of bat and the male organ has a complex anatomy with a baculum in most species: further that, in females, the right uterine horn is usually the functional one and in one species the left horn and left ovary are degenerate (17). Matthews found that in British horseshoe bats the vagina became sealed after the autumn mating with a plug that remained in situ until early pregnancy in the following spring, an arrangement that could well prevent supplementary matings. He considered it likely that fertilization was procured by sperm that had been stored within the female for many months (18). Wimsatt (1942) showed that in two bat species stored spermatozoa retain their fertilizing ability. An exciting venture on Basking sharks was undertaken postwar; Major Gavin Maxwell had invited Matthews, with H. W. Parker, Keeper of Zoology (1947-57) at the British Museum (Natural History), to the Isle of Soay, off Skye, where Maxwell had a shark-fishing station. The Basking shark Cetorhinus maximus can attain a length of 14 m being the second largest fish in the sea, yet it is an inoffensive, slow-swimming, plankton eater (stomach contents being almost indistinguishable from shrimp paste). Matthews &amp; Parker (58) published an account of the macroscopic anatomy and general biology of this shark in 1950. More interesting was Matthews's own account (61) of the creature's repro- ductive organs. He described the structure of the testis and discussed the function of the siphons. The right ovary, which alone is developed in this shark, was found to be 'penetrated everywhere by a system of branching tubes' through which the ova passed to reach the exterior. An average ovary could contain at least six million ova. A corpus luteum formed in the discharged follicle and corpora atretica in the numerous undischarged follicles. The nidamentary gland was small but the uterus was enormous and was lined by innumerable villus-like trophonemata. Professor N. B. Marshall considers that Matthews 'established clearly that the ovary of Cetorhinus produces very many small eggs, like a teleost fish but the uterus, thickly lined with trophonemata, indicates ovovi- viparity or viviparity. As observations of females containing embryos 423</page><page sequence="13">Biographical Memoirs were wanting, Matthews had to conclude that after insemination and before any embryo is recognisable, females must refrain from basking, and either swim nearer the bottom or leave inshore waters, or both. After a great gap, this was a considerable advance in knowledge and Matthews' sure-footed study did much to support his status as an outstanding zoologist.' Towards winter Cetorhinus sheds its gill rakers, and Matthews (103) suggested later (1962) that the sharks then sink to the sea-bottom and hibernate, there awaiting a new season's stock of plankton while growing a new set of rakers. Professor Marshall finds Matthews's figures for the energy required by a Basking shark persuasive, as have others. Basking sharks of other regions, such as off central California, where a longer plankton season obtains, must have other means of adjusting their gill- raker complement. PINNIPEDS AND CETACEANS Matthews published several classic monographs on marine mammals of which that (1929) on the southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) with notes on other seals found at South Georgia was the first (6). Elephant seals were present but in smaller numbers than in earlier days, and were an obvious target for research. Dr R. M. Laws (later C.B.E., F.R.S.), who was to become the Director of the British Antarctic Survey and later the Secretary of the Zoological Society of London, wrote in his Ph.D. thesis in 1953 that Matthews's 1929 paper in the 'Discovery' Reports 'was the most comprehensive account of the life history and habits of the species to date'. It was much quoted by Victor B. Scheffer (1958), the foremost authority on marine mammals in the United States. Matthews observed almost all the biological and behavioural charac- teristics of this largest of the pinnipeds, noting its feeding habits and its stomach containing stones (ballast bags), which he thought helped triturate the ingested food but which Laws has suggested might allay hunger pains. Matthews commented on the seal's sand-throwing habit, which he argued 'was to keep the skin moist'. He also noted that moulting involved not only loss of the pelage but of surface layers of skin also, in what for pinnipeds was virtually a total superficial cutaneous slough. This he thought might prove irritating to the seal, and might have initiated the sand-flipping behaviour as a means of soothing the irritation. He commented shrewdly about reproductive behaviour and times of birth; 'most of the late pups are first ones, their mothers having been impregnated for the first time late in the season'. He remarked on the short lactation period, the high fat content of seal milk, and the remarkable rate at which the pups gained in weight. Dr R. M. Laws's dissertational views have been quoted above but more recently he has 424</page><page sequence="14">Leonard Harrison Matthews written: 'The elephant seal monograph (1929), although qualitative natural history was the first attempt to describe the biology and behaviour of the species from a scientific viewpoint. Unfortunately, recent work has cast some doubt on the timing of the breeding season at South Georgia.' Matthews's work on elephant seals is considered by Professor Michael Bryden of Sydney University 'to have been by far the most com- prehensive account of the species at the time, and for many years beyond it provided stimulus for further work. Anyone interested in natural history of seals, the sealing industry based at South Georgia, and the colourful people involved, will find his book Sea Elephant (1952) a veritable gem.' Matthews contributed no further publications on seals until it was my good fortune to meet him in 1948 at a meeting of the Anatomical Society at which he had read a paper on the cyclic changes in the uterine mucosa of whales (44). Later we collaborated and contributed joint papers on the structure and changes in pinniped and other mammalian ovaries. These described villus-like evaginations of the covering ovarian epithelium and numerous subsurface crypts as well as tubular formations penetrating the ovarian cortex (51, 65, 67). Dr J. M. Roberts, who had served as a medical officer with the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey, had also collected seal specimens and collaborated in work on the corpus luteum during delayed implantation (73). Matthews incorporated all his observations on elephant seals in a useful book (74). A year or so previously Professor E. C. Amoroso, F.R.S., had also become involved in seal research at Matthews's instigation (125). Plans were made to investigate the British Grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) and Common seal (Phoca vitulina) and in spring and summer of 1950 Matthews and Amoroso went to Ramsey Island off the Welsh coast. There they captured a remarkably complacent pregnant grey seal (Mrs Mopp), which gave birth to a relatively uncomplaining pup (Willie). The cow was restrained in a crate and 'test weighing' was done that showed that during the suckling period the mother lost over 13 kg daily, and the pup gained over 6 kg daily (59, 64, 69, 71, 125). In the autumn of the next year another expedition to Ramsey Island was organized and Professor H. R. Hewer of Imperial College was the expedition's official photographer and produced a film on the life history of the Grey seal that was shown on B.B.C. T.V. Dr I. W. Rowlands of the A.R.C. Institute of Animal Physiology, Babraham, Cambridge, and I joined Amoroso and Matthews to study the development of the pups, their endocrine organs and the remarkable hypertrophy of their gonads before birth (65, 111). Some observations on the placenta were also made (70, 73). Much later, in 1979, he wrote a book about all the research that we, and his wife Dolly, and his daughter, Jean, accomplished, in a book The seals and the scientists (125). Pinnipeds had provided Matthews with an abiding interest from his first records of seals in the Bristol Channel 425</page><page sequence="15">Biographical Memoirs (15, 31), then down south (6, 74), then of calving times in British Grey seals (97) until his book on mammals of the British Isles (128). Everyone interested in cetology is familiar with the four 'Discovery' Reports Matthews published in 1937-38 on, respectively, the Humpback whale (Megaptera nodosa), the Sperm whale (Physeter catodon), the southern Right whale (Eubalaena australis) and the Sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) (16, 19-21). In Matthews's boyhood several sig- nificant events were affecting the whaling industry. A new phase of activity had developed in 1904 with the establishment of a land station on South Georgia, and increasing exploitation of the southern whales was enhanced by factory ships moored in harbours. Sir Sidney Harmer, F.R.S., when Keeper of Zoology at the British Museum (Natural History), had in 1911 directed the notice of its Trustees to the unrestricted slaughter of Antarctic whales. A call for swift introduction of protective measures on an international scale duly went to the Colonial Office, with the result that a committee was set up on Whaling and the Protection of Whales designed to recommend regulations to protect whales from over- exploitation. In 1913 Major G. E. H. Barrett-Hamilton was sent to South Georgia from the Museum with its taxidermist, P. Stammwitz, to gather information as a preliminary to framing of legislation. Barrett-Hamilton died there in January 1914 and (according to a letter from Matthews dated 2.12.79 to Dr G. B. Corbet of the B.M.(N.H.)) 'Stammwitz brought him back pickled in one of his specimen tanks'. The scientific part of his report was written up later by M. A. C. Hinton, F.R.S., in 1925. It emphasized the prevalent gross over-fishing of the Humpback whale, the stocks of which had been under threat even in 1913 (121, 124). In 1917 a new interdepartmental committee was set up by the Secretary of State for the Colonies to advise on research and development in the Dependencies of the Falkland Islands, concern being expressed that whale stocks in the region had suffered during the war years when licensing had unavoidably been relaxed. The committee was asked to consider the need for a research vessel and what purely scientific investigations should be instituted. This marked a new phase of Antarctic discovery, one in which biology was to be a main objective but one wherein political indecision was to inhibit any real advances in cetology. Matthews was to write later: 'As all the world knows, the immense expenditure of time, effort and money was futile, for the information that should have guided the whaling industry was constantly disregarded, the populations of whales were severely reduced and the whaling industry, once profitable in material and money, was ruined' (124). Matthews regarded highly the work of Dr F. W. True, Curator of the Department of Biology in the U.S. National Museum, whose (1904) authoritative monograph on whales of the western north Atlantic gave Matthews a sound basis for his own research. This, as Dr Nigel Bonner 426</page><page sequence="16">Leonard Harrison Matthews writes 'completed a major contribution to the knowledge of whales. All his papers were descriptive. They represent the results of thousands of hours' labour on the reeking flensing plan at Grytviken and the other localities where Leo was able to come into close contact with his subjects. This was very much basic research in a field where little had been done before. The massive 107-page Sei whale paper, for example contains only twenty three references. The vast mass of data contained in Matthews' reports has been a rich field for later cetologists and the mine is still being worked by the International Whaling Commission.' There is no reason presently to consider in detail all four of the papers but comment is permissible on that on the Sperm whale (Physeter catodon) (19), because although it was not then an important fraction of the catch in southern whaling grounds, it was important in those of Natal, Chile and Japan. How mistaken Matthews was to prophesy that 'The International Agreement signed in 1937 will give almost complete protection to the cows' (19). Dr M. Klinowska (1980) has given the details of the importance of sperm whale oil to industry: (a) sulphurized Sperm oil has been used extensively as an antiwear additive in lubricants; (b) sulpho oils are used widely in the formulation of fat liquors for finishing leathers and cutting and drawing oils; and (c) Sperm whale oil has been used to produce a wide range of items from antifoams to lipsticks. Despite this industrial demand since World War II, Sperm whale stocks appear not now to be in danger of extinction. Some credit should go to Matthews for useful, basic biological findings in 81 specimens, for he measured them, noted their colour, described their anatomy and stomach contents, their blubber thickness and their parasites, the reproductive organs in 67 males and 14 females, as well as their migratory habits, and finally made hopeful comments on whaling that were soon to be outdated. Dr. R. M. Laws, Director of the British Antarctic Survey, comments: 'It is often difficult to assess the value of research done some decades ago. I believe that his publications in 'Discovery' Reports were important. The monographs did not contain the data and biometrical analyses that Mackintosh &amp; Wheeler (1929) gave for Blue and Fin whales, which was understandable because they related to species taken in much smaller numbers but they were a valuable contribution'. Matthews continued to write about cetaceans long after his return from South Georgia (31, 37, 43-45, 57). In 1950 his friends, Dr Anton Fr. Bruun of Copenhagen and Dr F. C. Fraser, F.R.S., of the British Museum (Natural History), provided him with a male dolphin, Stenella frontalis, captured during the oceanographic cruise of the yacht Atlantide in 1946, of which Matthews provided an excellent account of the anatomy and topography of the testis and vas deferens (60). In 1948 Matthews had written (43) about 'motionless' swimming of dolphins and later a prophetic article (1953) about captive porpoises (80), which received mention again in later works (95, 113, 124). He scorned the notion of a 427</page><page sequence="17">Biographical Memoirs dolphin intelligence that directed these creatures to the succour of drowning men 'for were they intelligent they would not aid man, who for the greater part has been a ruthless destroyer of dolphins for centuries'. Also: 'It is true that dolphins can be trained to recognize various cues, perform certain actions, or discriminate various patterns in order to secure a reward of food-but so can rats, hens and other animals that are not regarded as especially intelligent' (124). In the 1860s efforts had been made to keep coastal net-caught porpoises in a pool at the Zoo. Matthews favoured resumption of this practice but there were arguments against it for it would involve expensive pool construction with additional plant, and if at Whipsnade would be far from a source of clean seawater. Dolphins must be imported, as English law forbids taking 'Royal Fish' (sturgeons, swans, cetaceans) inside the three-mile limit (Fraser 1977). The weather at British zoos is unlike that of California. Dolphins are liable to succumb to human diseases, and furthermore there were at the time few British veterinarians who were knowledgeable in dolphin pathology. Construction of a dolphinarium on the Californian model was out of the question and would prove a financial drain. Nevertheless, Matthews helped get the dolphin pool concept accepted though construction was not undertaken until after his retirement. Eventually a small unit was opened at Whipsnade in 1972. Dr Margaret Klinowska (1986) prepared a report on dolphinaria for the Department of the Environment and had asked Matthews about early attempts to keep porpoises in the U.K. Matthews's reply was full of information, 'Porpoises at London Zoo are described in "Curiosities of Natural History" by Francis Buckland (1882); 6 porpoises at different times, all lived only a day or two-all were more or less injured', and even at the age of 84 displayed his usual enthusiasm. THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON Matthews became Scientific Director to the Zoological Society of London in 1951, in succession to Professor Edward Hindle, F.R.S., and stayed until retirement in 1966. The new President of the Society was Field-Marshal Lord Alanbrooke, K.G., G.C.B., O.M., G.C.V.O.; G. S. Cansdale was Superintendent and Dr W. C. Osmap Hill the Prosector. Differences of opinion obtained as to how zoo animals and staff should be used for television appearances, and regarding proper dispersal of prosectorial material. Matthews found these differences troublesome and was driven to contemplate legal action until certain resignations were effected. Because of illnesses and 'internal reorganization', Matthews was acting as director, secretary, and superintendent of the Gardens at Regent's Park, those at Whipsnade, and of the Society's business and was for a while virtually the Society's sole executive officer. The election in 1955 of a new Hon. Secretary, Professor Sir Solly 428</page><page sequence="18">Leonard Harrison Matthews Zuckerman, F.R.S., then Sands Cox Professor of Anatomy at Bir- mingham University (now Lord Zuckerman, O.M., K.C.B., F.R.S.) proved a powerful stimulus for progress, and reforms were soon inaugurated. Earlier (1928-33) he had been the Society's Prosector, and so was no stranger to the Society when later in 1953 he was first elected to its Council. Concerning the disquieting conditions then pertaining he writes: The Zoo had suffered badly during the second world war. Many of its staff had joined the armed services; animals had had to be 'put down' lest they escaped-the reptile house was practically depopulated; the flower gardens and lawns had been turned over to potatoes and other crops; and bombs had caused damage. The Zoo was in a very dilapidated state when I became a member of Council, and restoration was obviously going to prove a formidable task. The Society had few financial reserves, and unlike other national zoos, it was not in receipt of money from public funds, although the land it occupied in Regent's Park was Crown property for which it paid only a 'peppercorn rent'. Added to that, the Zoo enjoyed a low priority during the immediate post-war years when all building was strictly controlled. The new Council member was also saddened that Zoo News about new arrivals in the collection was no longer high in public interest, and that press reportage was all bad news, concerning rows between Fellows and Council, about planning arguments, or about disaffected staff. Lord Alanbrooke had not stayed long as President and had been followed in 1954 by the austere Sir Landsborough Thomson, C.B., O.B.E. The following year the then Secretary, Lord Chaplin, resigned. Officers, and Matthews, persuaded Sir Solly Zuckerman to become Secretary even though he had not yet realized that the Secretary, even if unpaid, should be the chief executive of the Council and the Society, according to the Royal Charter, which had hitherto been somewhat laxly interpreted. Matthews, acting with the best of intentions, accidentally precipitated a crisis by sending some Pere David's deer (Elaphurus davidianus) to China at a time when government had no diplomatic ties with Peking. This act aroused the wrath of Council members; the new Secretary had to calm matters and define precisely the responsibilities of individual officers. The Society had become too club-like and had forgotten its purpose as defined in its Royal Charter, namely 'the Advancement of Zoology and Animal Physiology and the introduction of new and curious subjects of the Animal Kingdom'. Matthews was able to persuade the Secretary to gain personal experience of the existence of 'Pink Elephants'; that is of the existence of a club within a club--almost always a recipe for trouble. Meetings of the Society became a little heated, revision of the form of membership became necessary and Matthews was involved in helping to establish a new scientific fellowship. He had also been in a party with Officers that sought advice from counsel as how to set up a catering 429</page><page sequence="19">Biographical Memoirs department at the Zoo without inconveniencing the Society, and which would be able to keep open when the Gardens were closed. This effort was rewarded in that many visiting Societies availed themselves of the Zoo Restaurant, to their joy. Zuckerman had realized early on in his Secretaryship that 'no man could carry the executive responsibility that rested on Matthews's shoulders'. Zuckerman continues: On paper he was both the director of a major scientific society and the chief administrator of a famous London amenity. It was an impossible burden for a man who had practically no supporting staff. It was his job to organize regular scientific meetings and edit publications, at the same time as he was supposed to maintain an oversight of the Society's financial affairs and all that happened in the Gardens. Miss Gay, who had been in the Society's employ since 1912, and who was the repository of all confidential Council matters, served him as well as the Officers of the Society. Early in 1957 Miss E. M. Owen, C.B.E., formerly Deputy Regional Commissioner for Wales during the war, was appointed Director of Administration. At year end the Director of Manpower Planning in the War Office, Major General (later Sir Charles) C. J. G. Dalton, C.B.E., FIGURE 1. L. H. Matthews in 1957. (Reproduced from The BBC Naturalist, Rathbone Books, London.) was appointed Controller. These appointments relieved Matthews of administration of a type that he had not really been appointed to discharge. He was thus free to develop the growing scientific activities of the Society and his own researches. Earlier on modernization of the Zoo, supervised by Matthews, had been initiated by provision of a fine animal hospital, and appointment of a veterinary surgeon and of a pathologist. 430</page><page sequence="20">Leonard Harrison Matthews Later, financial help was sought from the Ford, Nuffield and Wellcome foundations, and Matthews became engrossed with planning buildings that eventually matured into the Nuffield Institute of Comparative Medicine and the Wellcome Institute of Comparative Physiology. Dr L. G. Goodwin, C.M.G., F.R.C.P., F.R.S., was Director of the Nuffield Institute from 1964 and admired Matthews greatly but 'found him not very keen about establishing research laboratories and animal experiments at the Zoo. There was always the feeling that he would rather have had any additional funds for "real zoology"'. The Wellcome Institute was later directed by Dr I. W. Rowlands, and was concerned with re- production in zoo animals and in breeding rare and endangered species. Dr Rowlands took over the Secretaryship of the Breeding Policy Committee from Matthews 'but despite invitations, I could never persuade Matthews to visit the Wellcome Institute'. Matthews was always thinking about zoos of the future and hoped that they would be without bars. While at a conference in Paris in 1955 he took Professor E. C. Amoroso and myself to inspect some new types of enclosures without bars at the Paris Zoo to demonstrate what he meant, but we disliked the expanses of concrete. He wanted to improve the surroundings of captive subjects, to provide them with occupations and new experiences and so to avoid development of abnormal, stereotyped behaviour. Dr Desmond Morris (1979) wanted a research appointment at London Zoo but Matthews explained that there was no money to spare. Morris continues: 'Just as I was leaving, he had a last minute thought and asked me to hold on while he rummaged through some papers on his desk. "Have you ever done any filming?", he asked'. In 1956 Morris was appointed Director of a Granada TV and Film Unit based at the Zoo which made natural history programmes, in successful opposition to the B.B.C. From 1959 to 1967 Morris was Curator of Mammals at the Zoo and 'always felt an enormous warmth towards Matthews. He epitomized all that was good about the traditions of the Zoological Society and dearly loved the scientific side of it-research, the library, the scientific meetings-but was not very interested in improving the drainage system or in administration. He was like a gentleman zoologist of the 19th century but there was no Victorian stuffiness about him; when we went out together in London it was to see the latest "outrageous" show.' The organization of committees that supported the Council of the Society changed during this period. Matthews was continuously in attendance at the Prosectorial Committee, the Gardens and Parks Committee, the Animal Welfare and Husbandry Committee, the Zoological Research Committee, the Breeding Policy Committee and the Publications Committee. Professor A. J. E. Cave described Matthews's service on this last committee as a joy, after suffering the less effective previous Scientific Director, and when Matthews took over found him so 431</page><page sequence="21">Biographical Memoirs considerate of colleagues 'that it sometimes merged into diffidence and a reluctance to reject unworthy mss. He had a lack of "toughness" in decision that may have been at the bottom of later differences with certain other colleagues. I suspect that LHM was not by constitution the executive type, was hesitant to exercise the authority necessarily inseparable from office and was basically happier pursuing his own research work or composing his works on natural history.' By the time Matthews retired the Zoological Society was expanding widely. He was succeeded by Dr H. G. Vevers (made Assistant Director of Science), and by Mr C. G. C. Rawlins, O.B.E. (as Director of Zoos). It is possible that Matthews had no wish to be a 'Zoo man' and it is by his contributions to zoology and from his interest in natural history that he will be remembered. As Lord Zuckerman has written, Matthews simply had too much on his plate at the Zoo. This was probably why he tended to leave the management of Whipsnade to others and not to exercise more control over the running of London Zoo where Head Keepers were left undirected in a time of change in ideas and techniques in animal management. He was recognized by all as a distinguished zoologist but not as a person who introduced things that became part of Zoo lore; he might have played a bigger part on the developing international zoo scene, for which he was well equipped. He did not appear to enjoy 'addressing the troops' and did not seem to want to intrude much in management and preferred to leave decisions about the animals to those whom he considered were closer to them. This undoubtedly was the cause of unfortunate relationships with colleagues but especially, and sadly, with the Secretary. A shrewd observer thought it not so much a matter of incompatible personalities but that Matthews was not prepared to adapt his responses to another's views; there was a deep-seated trait of obstinacy in Matthews's character that helped him to keep going through Antarctic discomfort, tolerate the inconsistencies of wartime and made him strong in his own views, but that hindered recognition of any authority other than his own guiding star. He arrived at the Zoo before publication, in 1952, of his book British mammals (72). This was the last task undertaken while at Bristol before 'he so appropriately took up his appointment as Scientific Director', as acclaimed by his editors. Dr W. N. Bonner of the British Antarctic Survey writes; 'It was the first comprehensive text on British mammals since Barrett-Hamilton and Hinton (1910-21) had made an abortive attempt. It was both scholarly and readable; it generated great interest in the subject'. Matthews thus established the study of wild animal ethology, and he was pleased at the widespread interest. In 1952 Matthews also displayed his breadth of knowledge by producing books on Amphibia and reptiles (78), and on Sea elephant (74). Dr R. M. Laws, the present Secretary of the Zoological Society, writes: 'I think Matthews was a zoologist with a wide range of knowledge and that his main 432</page><page sequence="22">Leonard Harrison Matthews contribution was through presentation and interpretation of zoology- particularly on mammals-to a large public.' Matthews's major scientific interest while at the Zoo was in reproduction of pinnipeds (see p. 424). He was attracted by Amoroso to work on the placenta of the waterbuck Kobus defassa (79) and of other ungulates (96). Review articles discussed migration (83, 88), hibernation of mammals (84) and evolution of viviparity (86). In 1956 he contributed with the Grand Old Man of reproduction studies, F. H. A. Marshall, F.R.S., an outstanding chapter (89) on reproductive organs of lower vertebrates. Maxwell Knight, O.B.E., the spymaster turned naturalist, was a member of the Council of the Zoological Society for many of Matthews's years at the Zoo. 'We had regular expeditions to Appledore on the Romney Marshes at the end of May to hear the laughing frogs'. 'I found Max a very loyal and devoted friend, never afraid to speak his mind at the Zoo Council. He was deeply interested in Communist infiltration and I remember Max asking me about the politics of some physicist I was working with' (Masters 1986). They took part in radio programmes on natural history (95) and wrote jointly a book on The senses of animals (107). Matthews wrote an informative chapter in 1962 on the invertebrate ovary in a major work (104) edited by Sir Solly Zuckerman. In 1964 there was a chapter about overt fighting in mammals in The natural history of aggression (108). Throughout his time at the Zoo Matthews supervised the writing of Annual Reports, was senior editor of Proceedings, Transactions, and many special Symposia. For example, Matthews was on a joint committee of the Zoological Society and other societies to organize a symposium on The biology of survival (Edholm 1964). He was concerned with the Zoo's participation in the Zoological Record, the principal zoological bibli- ography then published. Matthews said to New Scientist (1961): 'The Record is important to the whole world, if somebody dropped an atom bomb on us today, the first question that someone would ask tomorrow is: "Who is going to publish the Record now?" ' (It is now published elsewhere.) Matthews drew great enjoyment from two aspects of the Zoo. The scientific meetings allowed opportunity to draw attention to new additions to the Collections. It was a rare meeting that did not present some beast of peculiar anatomy, strange behaviour or stranger breeding habits, on which Matthews discoursed in lively and informative manner, referring to its use as an aphrodisiac, its palatability, and giving hints on its cooking. Professor A. J. E. Cave comments: 'He greatly improved the conduct of the Scientific Meetings, often stepping into the deathly hush following delivery of a badly presented communication and tactfully creating lively discussion on its subject matter.' He also loved to yarn with members of the select Zoological Club that dined after the Scientific Meetings. 433</page><page sequence="23">Biographical Memoirs Desmond Morris found him a superb anecdotalist, tolerant and courteous, polite and erudite, with a quiet dignity. He had been a Club member before becoming Scientific Director and had stayed overnight with his old Discovery shipmate, Dr F. C. Fraser, before returning to Bristol. Professor Marshall then shared a house with Fraser, and when he also became a member of the Club was charged by Fraser to remind him to get off the train at West Dulwich on their return from dining. Professor Marshall writes: 'It was my first time at the Zoo Club. Fraser, Matthews and I began to talk about natural and artificial scents on our journey home. I remember that Matthews had all sorts of interesting observations (he had a conjurer's knack of suddenly producing a surprise). We became so engrossed we forgot to get off at West Dulwich and went on to Penge.' Dr Nigel Bonner remembers the 1950s when after meetings 'Leo would then gather us up and take us back to his home for continuing discussion.' There was, however, one embarrassment about the Zoological Club, as Dr Penelope Jenkin discovered-it did not then allow a lady to dine. 'I had been invited to speak at one of the scientific meetings, and this necessitated going to London specially. Leo kindly wrote to offer me dinner but was acutely embarrassed and apologetic, poor man, at having to explain that, because of the Society's Rules, he could only do so if I would dine with other women zoologists in a remote part of the room, cut off from the men by a heavy curtain!'. SOCIETIES AND COMMITTEES At Bristol Matthews had, in the late 1940s, been a Member of the Council of the Lundy Field Society, the Bristol Zoological Society, the Marine Biological Association, and of the Zoological Society of London (1943-51). He was Secretary of the Bristol Scientific Club and of the Association of British Zoologists, and was Vice-President of the Bristol Naturalists' Society. He served on the National Committee for Biology for several years. When he became Scientific Director of the Zoological Society from 1951 his Bristol links were broken. After 1951 he joined the Board of Studies in Zoology of the University of London, served on the Council of the Ray Society, and as a member of the Tsetse fly and Trypanosomiasis Committee of the Colonial Office. He was President, Section D, of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (1959), of the Association of British Zoologists (1960) and of the Ray Society (1965). He was Chairman, World List of Scientific Periodicals (1959 66), and of the Seals Sub-Committee of the Natural Environment Research Council (1967-71). Also while Director at the Zoo he was a Member of Council of the Institute of Biology, of the Linnean Society of London and of the Association of British Science Writers. Matthews became, in 1954, a member of a private dining club of which 434</page><page sequence="24">Leonard Harrison Matthews the well-known coroner, Sir Bentley Purchase, was the Hon. Secretary. No sooner had Matthews joined than meetings of the club at the Zoo became a regular occurrence. According to Mr G. C. Smith, President of Pembroke College, Cambridge, and the Cambridge Secretary of the club: 'these meetings were very successful and were accompanied by displays of animals and visits to collections after dinner'. Several incidents caused Matthews to enjoy his membership of this remarkable club, of which several members were criminologists or seemed to be, or were, detectives in disguise. One day a man came early into the Zoo carrying a sack that aroused curiosity when he visited the Large Carnivore House, and distributed its fleshy contents to the cage occupants. Messages went to Matthews who persuaded keepers to recover the meat served to the hyaenas, the only carnivores that had not devoured the offerings. Matthews consulted members of the club about the bits of meat recovered. Soon he was given evidence of the presence of muscle from a wide variety of edible and not so edible beasts as well as vegetables, seasoning and shotgun pellets. Meanwhile the Flying Squad had located the culprit, a poor man who far from being a suspected murderer disposing of his victim had simply been making meat pies for pub lunches. Sales had fallen and, being a kindly man, he had taken left-overs for animals at the Zoo. Matthews thus became a member of the British Academy of Forensic Science and President in 1962; he was consulted on tooth marks resulting from animal bites, on traces of animals and on animal remains wherever these might have forensic significance. He was involved in founding the Mammal Society, being Chairman at its first gathering in 1955. He collaborated with H. N. Southern in editing a Handbook of British mammals (109); he was often able to associate activities of the Mammal Society and those of the Zoological Society. He attended Discovery dinners, and those of the Antarctic Club of which he was President in 1986. He was also a member of the Explorers' Club (New York). RETIREMENT In 1966 Matthews retired to Stansfield in Suffolk. He had bought The Old Rectory before taking up permanent residence there; it was a perfect place in that he could practise his many D.I.Y. and horticultural skills. He installed central heating, plumbed and wired the house, set the place to rights, and tilled extensive vegetable and fruit gardens while not omitting to make wine. He demolished outbuildings to build a patio, a terrace and a garage. He organized a fair-sized study in which he kept his library and wherein Dr Nigel Bonner noticed the title page from an article in a laboratory technicians' journal stuck in the corner of a picture frame. The heading was 'Bleeding Rabbits' and Matthews had written underneath 'Too many of 'em in the garden'. 435</page><page sequence="25">Biographical Memoirs Retirement by no means meant the last of writing about natural history. The whale, a large, profusely illustrated book, was published in 1968 (113) and reprinted (121). Mr Douglas Fisher went to The Old Rectory to photograph for the book many of the figures and plates in the numerous old whaling books that Matthews had collected. Matthews edited the book and was the chief contributor. The book was concerned with cetacean biology, its history, whaling techniques, whalers, books on whaling, whalemen and scientists and is now a collector's item. There followed a succession of books at which the most active writer on natural history must stand amazed. A second edition in 1968 of his prestigious British mammals (114) was followed by the first volume of The life of mammals (116) and by the second volume in 1971 when Matthews was aged 70 (118); R. Carrington &amp; Professor J. Z. Young, F.R.S., were the editors. Matthews enjoyed a 'story'; 'The douens (Vampyrum spectrum) flit about among the branches of the silk-cotton trees. They are believed to be little children who have died before they were baptized. They have no sex and no faces, their feet turn backwards, and they are either naked or wear long white robes and large hats.' This is Trinidad folklore, and it could encourage one to read on. In 1971 Matthews also wrote an introduction to a new format of Charles Darwin's Origin of species that was published in 1972 (119). It began provocatively: 'Few books have been more widely misunderstood and misinterpreted than Origin of species, especially by those who have not read it'. In 1977 his book on penguins (123) appeared, perhaps it would have prospered more had it come out a few years later when South Georgia was headline news. The natural history of the whale was published in 1978 (124). It had to be a distillation of all his previous writings on cetology, as he had not been to sea for years, and to which were added the results from new types of research on wild cetaceans. The dedication is to two American cetologists, Carleton Ray and William Schevill, with the warning that 'Cetological literature is full of poorly supported conjecture'. The first chapter reviews cetology from its beginnings and again displays Matthews's knowledge of the old texts. Dr Nigel Bonner writes: 'He brought a clarity and freshness to a field which had become obscure and turgid. He poured just scorn on the preposterous claims of super-human intelligence in dolphins and gently ragged the whale-huggers'. The increasing interest in keeping dolphins in captivity is noted as well as the necessity to keep groups composed of a male, a breeding female, an older female that had already borne young, and several infertile or immature females that acted as nursemaids. Again he expressed severe criticisms of the weakness of the International Whaling Commission in its attempts to conserve whales. His book The seals and the scientists (125) is reviewed on p. 425. In 1982 there came a new, revised version of British mammals in a book Mammals 436</page><page sequence="26">Leonard Harrison Matthews of the British Isles, no. 68 in the New Naturalist series (128). Matthews wrote: 'The cost of resetting a fully revised edition (of British mammals) was too expensive. I had therefore to insist that it should go out of print. Paradoxically the publishers then asked me to write a new, different book on mammals, and here it is.' The new book was about distribution, ranges and territories, social behaviour and communication, biological rhythms and man's effects on mammals. A penultimate article was on Samuel Stutchbury, a Bristol naturalist and surveyor of the Bristol coalfield, and his relationship with Charles Darwin (130). Born in 1797, Stutchbury collected numerous cirripedes (barnacles), all were lent to Darwin for his monograph on the Cirripedia (1851-54), in which Darwin formulated the principles of neotony and specialization through simplification. Matthews's father had bought Darwin's monograph in a bundle of books at Cowlin's Sale Rooms, Clifton, on 21 October 1941 for one shilling. Again, Matthews displays his bibliographic skills and also adds that he bought second-hand Stutchbury's Report on a geological survey of a portion of the Parish of Bedminster, including Bishport, more especially with reference to the working of coal, signed at the foot of folio 6 by 'S. Stutchbury Bristol December 1847'. He wrote finally an introduction (jointly) in 1983 to a reprint of a Japanese book Illustrations of whaling (1829) by Yamado Yosei (131). In 1985 he was awarded the Silver Medal of the Zoological Society in recognition of over 60 years of contributions to the understanding and appreciation of zoology. During his last years he was a Vice-President of the All Saints Church restoration appeal at Stansfield and lived long enough to see the church tower fully restored: his daughter said: 'he watched progress from the seat by our front door'. He enjoyed encouraging his grandchildren, three zoologists and one doctor, and was proud of his two small great- grandsons and pleased to think that they would enjoy living at Stansfield. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Gratitude is expressed to Dr Jean Trewhella for information about the Matthews family. Thanks are due particularly to Lord Zuckerman, O.M., F.R.S., Professor A. J. E. Cave, Dr D. Parry, Mr Colin Rawlins, Dr Nigel Bonner, and all those named who provided recollections in the memoir. Mr J. E. Hill of the British Museum (Natural History) gave valuable help with the bibliography. The frontispiece photograph was taken on the occasion of his 80th birthday at Stansfield by Marcus Matthews. 437</page><page sequence="27">438 Biographical Memoirs BIBLIOGRAPHY (1) 1922 (With A. D.
