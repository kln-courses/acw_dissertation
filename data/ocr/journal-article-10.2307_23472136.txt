<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tel Ya'oz Raz Kletter, Orit Segal and Irit Ziffer (Hebrew section: p. 90) During August-September 1998 a salvage excavation was conducted at Tel Ya'oz ('Aza; map ref. 124/150; HA 77:30-31), situated on a kurkar hill (48 m above sea level) inside a military base south of Rishon Le-Ziyyon, due to damage caused to antiquities. The excavation, on behalf of the Antiquities Authority, was directed by R. Kletter with the assistance of O. Segal, 1". Sagiv (photography), E. Tsarfaty (pottery restoration), I. Vatkin and V. Pirsky (surveying and drafting), A. Hachmon (mechanical equipment operation), H. Lavie (administration) and R. Rodnitski (GPS system). Special thanks are extended to the base commander for allowing die excavation to be undertaken. Two excavation areas (A and B) were opened on the southern slope of the tell, which was damaged by mechanical equipment, and a third excavation area (C) was opened on its southwestern slope. The principal find is a large structure from the Persian period in Area C. Areas A, B. Numerous fragments of pottery vessels from the Persian period and building stones were scattered on the surface. Beneath the surface was a sand dune containing a few finds, not in situ, that was concentrated close to the top. The excavation was deepened by means of mechanical equipment and it became clear that the sand dune (height 2-3 m) is situated directly above the kurkar bed rock. The finds on the surface were probably eroded from the site or they could have belonged to structures on the south, that were entirely destroyed by the bulldozers. Area C. A large building, at least 100 sq m, was excavated (Fig. 129). Its western part was damaged by a modern quarry and just a few stones survived from its western wall (W8). The area to the south of W9 was destroyed prior to the excavation and the eastern part of the structure was severely damaged (W6, Wll, W12). The construction is characteristic of the Persian period. The walls are made of a combination of fine dressed kurkar stones placed 1.5m from each other with small kurkar fieldstones between them (width 0.4-0.5 m). The walls were founded directly upon the sand, without founda tion trenches. The structure included large rooms (L302 + L303, L309 + L313, L311 + L315) and small ones (L3l4a-b). Openings were discerned in W4 and W5. Some of the rooms had a floor made of a layer of hamra and earth (L307, L311, L314, L315), in others the floor was a layer of soil, almost devoid of finds (L302, L309, L313), placed directly on the yellow sand. Locus 306, which is in the northwest part of the structure, had no floor and it seems to have been an open area. No construction phases or repairs of any sort were discerned in the structure. Although Wll and W12 lean somewhat in relation to W6, and their relation to it is not sufficiently clear; there is no proof that they are later than the rest of the walls. In the absence of evidence indicating a conflagration or a violent end, it seems that the structure was abandoned. All the finds in the build ing date to the Persian period. Its function has yet to be clarified and it is also unclear whether it was a single building that stood on the edge of the site, or part of a residential quarter. Finds. The ceramic assemblage found at the site dates to the Persian period. It consisted of grinding bowls (mortaria), 'torpedo' jars with a carinated shoulder and a low thickened rim and jars with an ovate body and a high, thickened rim, which are prominent. Other pottery types are cooking pots, juglets, jugs, lamps and a flask; only a few of them are complete or can be restored. The imported vessels include a few sherds from amphorae, lekythoi and kraters. One sherd belongs to the Red Figure group and several other sherds belong to lekythoi of the Black Figure group. A unique find is an almost complete rhyton in the shape of a crouch ing animal that is treated with a red slip and has an opening in its bottom for the flow of liquids (Basket 3046). The vessel has an anthropomorphic head. It joins the small number of rhyta from the Persian period that were discovered in Israel and it is un usual in that it has a man's head. These rhyta are inspired by the magnificent Achaemenidian vessels made of silver and gold. Other finds included part of another rhyton shaped as a lion's head, an intact bronze toggle pin from Area B that was not found in situ, several metal items and shells used for the production of red dye.
