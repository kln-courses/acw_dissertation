<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN ORIENTAL SOCIETY, AT ITS AIEETING IN NEW HAVEN, CONN., April i8th and igth, I895. THHE Society assembled at New Haven, in the Foreign Missions Library, East Divinity Hall, Yale University, on Thursday of Easter Week, April 18th, 1895, at 3 P. Mr., and was called to order by its President, President Daniel Coit Gilman of Johns Hopkins University. The following members were in attendance at one or more of the sessions Batten Goodwin, C. J. Martin, W. A. P. Berg Gottheil Moore, G. F. Binney Grieve, MIiss Oertel Blaustein Hauipt Perry Bradner Tlopkins Staley * Chester Jackson Steele Davis, ,T. D. Jewett Van Name Dickerman Lanman Ward Gilman AMacdonald [26] On opening the session, the President expressed the pleastire of the Society at being welcomed again at New Havern, where the associations connected with the Society's history are so many. He then spoke-of -the receet- loss which Yale University, and the world of science, had suffered in the death, on April 14th, of Pro- fessor James Dwight Dana, the distinguished zo6logist, geologist, and mineralogist. Dr. Gilman spoke with feeling, admirationi, and respect concerning the life and work of the departed scholar, and called attention to the fact that, although not enrolled among Orientalists, Professor Dana had been an extensive traveller in the Orient, and by his writings oin the Geology of the Pacific and</page><page sequence="2">cciv American Oriental Society's Proceedings, April 1895. on Coral Islands had made important contributions to our know- ledge of the physical and natural characteristics of the Eastern Hemisphere. In the absence of the Recording Secretary, Professor Lyon, the Society chose Professor Jackson, of Columbia College, to dis- charge the duties of that officer during the session. The minutes of the special meeting held at Philadelphia, December 27th, 28th and 29th, 1894, in connection with various other philological and archebological societies of America, were read and approved. The report of the Committee of Arrange- ments for the present meeting was made by Dr. Oertel of Yale University. This report was in the form of a printed pro- gramme, and was accompanied by an invitation from President Dwight of Yale University, extending to the members of the Society the hospitality of his home during the evening. The report and the invitation were accepted with acknowledgments and thanks. The reports of outgoing officers were now in order. The Corresponding Secretary, Professor Perry, of Columbia College, presented some of the correspondence that had been received since the Christmas meeting. Report was then made upon some letters which had been addressed to Professor Lanman of Ilarvard IUniversity on sub- jects touching the work of the Society.-Siddhe9vara Mitter, formerly the Secretary of Protap Chunder Rov of Calcutta, writes from The Residency at Khatmandu, Nepal, that although many good manuscripts have been carried away, the country is still rich in them; and that he is ready to do what he can to secure any such as may be desired by Oriental students among us.*-Dr. Rost writes from London that a young Singalese gentle- man, de Silva Wickremasingha, a pupil of Professor Kuhn and Dr. Franke, would be glad to collate Pali manuscripts for any one who may wish to make use of his services.-In a letter to Mr. H. C. Warren of Cambridge, the Venerable W. Subhuti, Thero, P. N. M., a learned Buddhist High Priest, of Waskaduwa, Kalutara, in the Western Province of Ceylon, to whom various Pali students in the Occident are already so greatly indebted, has increased the existing obligations by the tender of his kind offices in the matter of procuring transcripts of manuscripts.t-Dr. James Burgess of Edinburgh wrote to Prof. Lanman with regard to the "M Magazine of Indian Photographs," an interesting monthly started at Alla- habad (Sept., 1894, yearly 30 Rupees, office at 5, Cutchery Road); * At the meeting of April, 1893, Professor Lanman described a good copy of a MS. of the Lafika-avatara, just received by him from Nepal; but the description was not printed. f Since his first letter, Subhbiti has sent to Mr. Warren a complete and excel- lent transcript, on about 1700 pages, of the Paramattha Manijilsa, which is a com- mentary upon Buddhaghosa's Visuddhi Magga, and was much desired by Mr. Warren in his work upon the Visuddhi Magga.</page><page sequence="3">Corresponding Secretary's Report. ccv and also concerniing the progress of his own labors upon the great work on the Archaeology of India to be published by Griggs of London.-Professor James Legge of Oxford had also sent a most interesting letter to Professor Lanman, in the course of which he said, " Nor can I bring myself to think that his [BuLddha's] teach- ing has been a great boon to the world, or even to the peoples by whom its records have been most generally and favorably re- ceived." In this connection, Dr. William Hayes Ward drew the atten- tion of the Society to recent discoveries of tablets at Tel-Lo, and read selections from a letter received from Mr. J. H. Haynes, in charge of the Philadelphia expedition at Niffer, in which Mr. Haynes gave account of fair success in the search for tablets which he had beetn pursuLing. The Corresponding Secretary reported the names of recently deceased members of the Society. The record is as follows: HONORARY MEMBERS: Professor Heinrich Brugsch-Pasha; Professor August Dillmann; Sir Brian Houghton Hodgson; Sir Austen Henry Layard; Raol Sahib Shankar Pandurang Pandit; Major-General Sir Henry Creswicke Rawlinson. CORRESPONDING MEMBERS: Hyde Clarke; Professor Philippe Edouard Foucaux; Dr. D. J. Maegowan. CORPORATE MEMBERS: Professor Edwin Cone Bissell; Rev. Dr. Alexander Kohut; Professor William Dwight Whitney. As is well known to our members, the obligations of the Amer- ican Oriental Society to Professor Whitney are very exceptionally great. This meeting, the first annual legal meeting of the Society after his decease, would have been the natural time for taking some official notice of his death. That this was not done is due to the fact that that session of the First American Congress of Philologists which was held at Philadelphia, Friday evening, December 28, 1894, was made a memorial meeting, and " devoted to the expression, on the part of his colleagues and friends, of their appreciation of the character and public services of Mr. Whitney." The Proceedings of that session are to be published by the Congress in a volume entitled, " The Whitney Memorial Meeting." This is to be distributed to the members of the VOL. XVI.

American Oriental Society, the American Philological Associa- tion, and the Modern Language Association of Amnerica. The volume is uniform or very nearly unifortn in size with the publi- cations of those Societies and may properly be treated as a part of their official p?ublications. The Treasurer, Mr. Henry C. Warren, of Cambridge, Mass., presented to the Society, by the hand of Professor Lanman, his accounts and statement for the year ending April, 1895. At the request of the Treasurer, the Chair appointed Professors Lanman and Lyon of Cambridge, as a Committee to examine the securities of the Society at the place where such securities may be stored and they were requested to report on the same to the President of the Society. As an Auditing Committee to examine the Treas- uirer's accounts presented at the meeting, Professors Lanman and Gottheil were naned. rThis Comnmittee reported to the Society dluring the meeting, and certified that the accounts were in due order and properly voucled. The usual analytical summarv of the General Account follows: RECEIPTS. Balance from old account, March 29, 1894 $1,548.5i Assessments (181) for 1894-5 -$905.00 Assessments (31) for other years -155.00 Sale of publications -150.89 Income of investments, other than Bradley Type Fund- - - 195.60 Total income of the year - 1,406.49 Total receipts for the year - - - $2,955.00 EXPENDITURES.

The receipts from all sources have slightly exceeded the expenditures,</page><page sequence="5">Treasurer's Report-Librarian's Report. ccvii so that the total funds in the possession of the Societv are some forty odd dollars in excess of what thev were at the time of mak- ing the last report. It is to be noted that the continued hard times have lowered the rate of interest in the case of some of the investments of the Society. The total interest accounit, however, for this year is abouit thirty dollars largrer than that of last year this fact is in p.art due to the circumstance that the meeting this year is held later thani it was last spring, so that April dividends have come it).

Besides the usual exchanges from cor- responding institutions, two importanit gifts have been received. One of them, a portion of the library of the late Professor Whit- ney, presented by his family, has naturally a double interest and value to the Society. It comprises 139 volumes and 38 pamph- lets, and niext to the gifts of the Hon. Charles William Bradley and the Rev. Joseph P. Thompson, is perhaps the most valuiable the library has ever received. The other noteworthy gift* of the year is a Siamese edition of the sacred canon of the Southern Buddhists, the Tripitaka, in 39 volumes, 8vo., a present from His Majesty the Kitng of Siamn, in commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of his reign. The sum of fifty dollars, covered by the annual appropriation of twenty-five dollars for two years past, has been expended for binding.

Society's library is now 4828, an increase of nearly two hundred in the past year. For the Committee on Publication, the Corresponding Secre- tary reported as follows: By authorization of the Society, given at its meeting of December last, the Cornrmittee had held an infor- mal conference with the gentlemen empowered to represent the American Philological Association in the matter of publishing a volume commemorative of the late Prof. Whitney. It was the opinion of those present that such a volume should consist of the addresses delivered at the " Whitney Memorial Meeting," Decem- ber 28, 1894, and of the letters received from foreign scholars concerning Mr. Whitney, extracts from which had beeni read at that meeting. The Committee has under considerationi the question of pub- lishinig an inidex to the publications of the Society. As matter of record it may be added that the Proceedings of the Society at New York, March 29-31, 1894, were issued as a pamphlet of 92 pages and as a part of volume xvi. of the Journal, Sep. 24, 1894 ; and, further, that almost no progress had been made with the Jouirnal; but that one Arabic and one Vedic arti- cle had been printed, covering in all about 14 forms. On Friday mor-ning, April 19, at 9.30, upon the close of the Directors' Meeting, the second session of the Society was begin. The Directors reported by their scribe, Professor Perry, as fol- lows: 1. They had appointed the next meeting of the Society to be held at Andover, Mass., during Easter Week, April 9th, 10th and 11th, 1896. (The Chair named as members of the Local Com- mittee of Arrangemenits, to act with the Corresponding Secretary, Professors George F. M;loore and John P. Taylor, of the Andover Theological Seminary.) 2. They had decided to recommend to the Society for adoption the suggestion embodied in the report of the Committee of Pub- lication, that such committee shall hereafter consist of six mem- bers, one of whom slhall be the Corresponding Secretary, and that he shall act as Chairman of that Committee. 3. They had named the following members to serve as the Committee of Publication: The Corresponding Secretary, Chair- man, and Professors Isaac H. Hall, Paul Haupt, E. W. Hop- kins, Maurice Bloomfield, and George F. Moore. 4. They had voted to recommend to the Society for election to membership the following persons: As Corporate Members: Miss Lutie Rebecca Corwin, Mt. Holyoke Seminary, South Hadley, Mass. Dr. George S. Duncan, Harrisburg, Penn. Dr. Charles P. G. Scott, Radnor, Penn. Mr. Frederick Wells Williams, New Haven, Conn. Mr. Ellis Robert Woodruff,* New York, N. Y. * Mr. Woodruff died May, 1895.</page><page sequence="7">Officers Electecl. ccix The recommendation contained in the second paragraph of the report of the Directors was unanimously adopted by the Society. The persons recommended for election to inembership, after bal- lot duly had, were declared elected. Next in order of business was the report of the Committee on the Nomination of Officers, consisting of the Rev. Dr. Ward, Mr. Van Name, and Professor Haupt. T he Corresponding Secretary, Professor Perry, owing to the duties which devolve upon him in consequence of his being transferred from the department of Sanskrit to the Professorship of Greek in Columbia College, requested to have a successor named for the office which he had held in the Society during the past year; and Professor Lanman, who had been Corresponding Secretary from 1884 to 1894, was nomi- nated in hiis stead. Professor D. G. Lyot, who had served as Recording Secretary since his election to the office in 1886, like- wise requested that he might be relieved of the duties of that position, and as his successor Professor George F. Moore of the Andover Theological Senminary was nominated. The gentlemen so niominated, and the other officers anid Directors who had been the incumbents of the foregoing year, were duly elected by the Society. For convenience of reterence the names of the Board for 1895-96 are here given: President-Pres. D. C. Gilman, of Baltimore. Vice-Presidents-Dr. William Hayes Ward, of New York; Prof. C. H. Toy, of Cambridge; Prof. Isaac H. Hall, of New York. Corresponding Secretary-Prof. C. R. Lanman, of Cambridge. Recording Secretary-Prof. G. F. Moore, of Andover. Treasurer-Mr. Henry C.

Upon motion of the Corresponding Secretary it was Resolved, That the American Oriental Society hereby tenders its thanks to the authorities of Yale University, and in particular to Pres- ident and Mrs. Dwight, and to the members of the Local Committee of Arrangements, Messrs. Salisbury, Van Name, and Oertel, for the hospi- tality extended to the Society on the occasion of its annual meeting in April, 1895, and for the excellent arrangements made for the comfort and convenience of the members attending. Final adjournment was had on Friday, April 19th, at 11, 15 A. M. The following communications were presented:</page><page sequence="8">ccx American Oriental Society's Proceedings, April 1895. 1. On Chinese anticipations of certaiIn ideas of modern science; by Rev. W. A. P. Martin, D.D., LL.D., President Emeritus of the Imperial Tungwen College, Peking, Chinia. Possessing a high degree of intellectual culture and a longer career of recorded experience than any other existing people, it might have been expected that the Chinese would make important discoveries in the arts and sciences. In the arts, their contribution to the common stock is specially notable-including silk, tea, porcelain, the mariner's compass, and the art of printing. In the sciences, their achievements have been less conspicuous-the free movement of the Chinese intellect having from an early period been restrained by a cast-iron orthodoxy. Yet there is 'good evidence that some of their leading thinkers hit on such broad generalizations as biological evolution, the unity of matter, the duality of matter and motion, the conservation of energy, the existence and properties of elemental ether, etc. This last topic was treated in the paper with special detail, and it will claim the whole of the remaining space allotted to this abstract. Professor Oliver Lodge thus describes the modern theory of ether in a lecture before the Royal Institution. " The simplest conception of the universe that has yet occurred to the mind of man-one continuous sub- stance filling all space; which can vibrate as light; which can be parted into positive and negative electricity; which in whirls or vor- tices constitutes matter, and which transmits by continuity (not by impact) every action and reaction of which matter is capable; this is the modern view of the ether and its functions." This conception, which he qualifies as ' modern' is by no means new to the philosophy of China. How early it appeared there it is not easy to affirm-perhaps ten centuries before our era, when the earliest spec- ulations oIn the forces of nature were emiibodied in the Yihking or Book of Changes. It is found, however, as a fall fledged doctrine in several writers of the eleventh century after Christ; who not only speak of an ethereal medium, but ascribe to it all the properties above enumerated except that of producing electricity. Those writers are known as the Sungaju, or school of the Sung dynasty. A pleiad cluster of extraordi- nary brilliancy, its principal luminaries were five; who, as two of them were brothers, fall curiously enough under the four alliterative names of Cheo, Chang, C(h'eng, and Chu. Cheo is author of a theory of the universe based on an exposition of the Book of Changes. Chang is best known by a small work called Cheng meng, ' Right notions for the Young,' in which, beginninig as Chinese writers are prone to do, with the origin of the world, he sets forth what he considers as the correct view of the way in which it came into being. The two brothers Cheng adopted and expounded Chang's views. Chu, the fifth and most illustrious in the series, was their disciple. I shall have to cite something from each in order to show that their conceptions of ether were substantially identical with those of our modern physicists.</page><page sequence="9">3lartin, Chinese Aticipations of Modern Science. ccxi Speaking of space, Chang says, "The immensity of space, though called the great void, is not a void. In fact, there is no such thing as vacuum." " It is filled with a subtile substance called Chi." That sub- stance is, as we shall see, the ether of our modern science ; though Chang and his compeers were not able to enumerate as many of its properties as are known to the science of our day. The only property here asserted is its all-pervading presence. Even that might be left in doubt, but for a more explicit statement in another passage: " Heaven," he says, " in its external form appears to be an envelope for the earth, yet its Chi or substance in reality penetrates to the center of the earth." It would hardly follow from this expression that hie considers ether as present in all forms of matter. But here is a passage in which he introduces what we inay call the dynamics of ether, showing that he did not regard it as saturating matter, like an inert fluid; but that it is in a state of intense activity at every point, ancl that the existence of matter is due to that activity. "This Chi," he says, " which fills all space, is in a state of perpetual ebb and flow-expanding and contract- ing without a moment's cessation. This is the source of motion and the origini of matter, whether soft or lhard, gaseous or solid. Its combi- nations give rise to the transient forms of all things. Even the solid rocks are but grosser products of its action-like ashes from a furnace." In another place he compares the transformation of ether into matter to the formation of ice in water, and, as might be expected, he finds in the melting of ice an image of the reversion of matter into its primordial element. His words are: " Within the immensity of space, matter is alternately concentrated and dissipated, as ice is congealed and dis- solved in water." In the passages thus far quoted, we have only a reciprocal action or vibrations, iio intimation of those whirls and eddies by which thie ultimate particles are generated, or rather in which they consist. Professor Lodge states this as an article in an accepted creed; and we know something of those speculations as to the origin of the atom to which Lord Kelvin has lent the authority of his great name. With our Chinese thinkers the vortex-ring is a cardinal feature. Cheo, the first of the five, in a diagram of cosmic forces, begins with a single ring or circle of uniform whiteness. This represents the primi- tive ether. Then follows a circle partly dark, which shows the original substance differentiated into two forms: Yin and Yang, the bright and the dark-the dual source of all things. Says Chu, the last of the five, speaking of this diagram, "It shows how the primitive void was transformed into matter." "The two forces, rnolai mochiR, grind back and forth, or revolve like millstones in opposite directions. The detritus resulting from their friction is what we call matter." We may smile at the crudeness of this illustration; but have not Western philosophers described the particles of ether as cubes which in the course of evolution get their angles rubbed off and thus give birth to matter? His words are of value to us not for the liglht they throw on the process of creation, but as evidence that the Chinese had the idea of vortex motion.</page><page sequence="10">ccxii American Oriental Society's Proceedings, April 1895. Of this movement Chang says, " The immensity of space is filled with a pure fluid. Since it is pure (i. e. perfectly fluid) it offers no obstruction to motion." Here we have enunciated the principle of the perpetuity of vortex motion, viz. (in the language of modern physics) that, in a frictionless fluid, its original motion is maintained without alteration. To summarize the points in which the ether of these Chinese thinkers agrees with that of our modern science 1. It is a subtile fluid filling all space. 2. As a vehicle of force it is endowed with intense activity. 3. Its motions, which are in whirls or eddies, result in the production of matter. 4. This primordial substance, by its vibrations, is the source of light. The occidental theory is confirmed by a magnificent array of scientific facts. The oriental theory, standing apart from experimental science, never emerged from the state of speculation-a speculation wonderfully acute and sublime; one in which the scientific imagination shows itself to the best advantage; divining as if by instinct great truths, which require for thleir confirmation the slower processes of patient investiga-- tion. Practical as the Chinese mind confessedly is, it is not a little remark- able that Chinese philosophers in the study of nature have never made extensive use of the experimental method. That they have not been ignorant of it is evident from the following question and answer in thee writings of the brothers Cheng. " One asked whether to arrive at a knowledge of nature it is needful to investigate each particular object, or may not some one thing be seized upon from whiclh the knowledge of all things can be deduced?" "The Master replied: A comprehensive knowledge of nature is not so easily acquired. You must examine one thing to-day and one thing to-morrow; and, when you have accumu- lated a store of facts, your knowledge will burst its shell and come forth into fuller light, connecting all the particulars by general laws." We should not forget that in the West the same theory existed in the state of a discarded speculation for at least two centuries before it received the seal of science. The first European to get a glimpse of the circumambient ocean was Rene Descartes. His mistake in referring the motions of the planets to whirlpools of ether brought discredit on his whole system; though he also held that small vortices were neces- sary to explain the constitution of matter. But what a glorious resurrec- tion awaited it! In the first year of this century, touched literally by a sunbeam, it woke from its long slumber. Young found it necessary to his undulatory theory of light to which he was led by the interference of rays, and Fresnel resorted to it to explain the phenomena of polariza- tion. So much is our knowledge of it extended, and so firmly is the conception established, that in some of our treatises on physics the three subjects of light, heat, and electricity are all ranged under the common rubric of " ether waves." If anything more were required to complete the triumph of a neg- lected philosopher, would it not be to see his vortex theory employed top</page><page sequence="11">-Davis, Thte God7s of Sktirputrl(a. CCxiii explain the existence of matter? For what is the dynamic theory of the molecule but a rehabilitation of the Cartesian vortex, which its author represented not merely as bearing the planets on its bosom, but as hugging each particle in its whirls or eddies? But have the thinkers of China, who preceded Descartes by five cen- turies, nothing to do with this triumph of the French philosopher? Is it not probable that while he was at the Jesuit college of La Fleche he fell in with fragments of Chinese philosophy in the writings of Jesuit missionaries? If such were the case (and it is impossible to prove the contrary), who can measure the obligations of the world to China for the germ-thought deposited in the brain of the " Father of modern phil- osophy ? " 2. The Gods of Shirpurla; by Professor John D. Davis, of Princeton Theological Seminary, Princeton, N. J. The general principle on which the local pantheon at Shirpurla was constructed has been stated by the lamented Amiaud. Speaking of various temples of Babylonia, and including Shirpurla implicitly, he says: " The cult rendered to these gods was offered by reason of their being the mother, the brothers, or the sisters of the principal divinity " (Records of the Past, New Series, i. 59). So thorough was the work of this French scholar, and so keen his insight, that there is but scant gleaning after him in this direction. Still there is some. A few facts about the gods remain to be gathered from the inscriptions of the patesis, which somewhat nmodify the picture that has been drawn of the local pantheon. These facts, as well as the others which play a part in the present paper, are not all new. Not a few of them are familiar from gen- eral, especially from the later, Babylonian and Assyrian literature. But they are invariably derived from the records of the patesis them- selves, and they stand as attestations of the faith of Shirpurla. They make known the conceptions of the gods, not as entertained in differ- ent ages and at diverse places, but as held at a definite period, and by a homogeneous people of the remote past. And in the history of Baby- lonian religion this is a matter of importance. A fixed point is estab- lished from which to view the development of religious thought. A word as to the geography of Shirpurla. The place was apparently a complex city, though not necessarily closely compacted together. It is generally called country, but is also definitely named a city (DeC. pl. 14 col. i. 14, 15).* It afforded the titular designation of the reigning prince (1 no. 2; 2 no. 2; et passim). It is not customarily mentioned in the local records as the site of temples, the location of these being specified by towns. Within the circuit which bore the designation of Shirpurla, four towns or civic quarters were included; namely, first, * The references, unless otherwise noted, are to the plates in Decouvertes en Chaldee, par Ernest de Sarzec.</page><page sequence="12">ccxiv American Oriental Society's Proceedings, April 1895. Girsu-ki, the royal quarter. It contained the palace of the patesi and the temple of Ningirsu, the patron deity of the royal house. Urkagina is called not only king of Shirpurla, but also king of Girsu-ki (32, A). Second, Uru-azagga: perhaps the sacred quarter, as its name may denote. In it was the seat of worship of the goddess Gatumdug, the mother of Shirpurla, and of the goddess Bau, the local mistress of Uru- azagga. Third, Nina-ki; over which the goddess Nina presided: and fourth, Gishgalla-ki; of which the goddess Nana was the patron deity. The two last mentioned towns were probably burgher quarters. This description of Shirpurla represents in its general features the theory advanced by Amiaud. Recently, however, Mr. C. J. Ball, in commenting on a bilingual text (IVR. 46), drew attention to the group of three signs gish-gal-la which stand as the equivalent of Babylon; and he suggested a comparison with the name commonly pronounced Gishgalla-ki (written with one sign and the deterininative) in the texts of Shirpurla (PSBA. xv. 51 sq.). This suggestion has been taken up and pushed by Professor Hommel, who believes that in all places where we meet the latter ideogram " we have to read Gishgalla-ki, and to understand Babylon ;" and he concludes that this great city was ruled by the patesis of Shirpurla (PSBA. xv. 108 sq.). It is to be remem- bered, however, that, first, the two names are written differently. Their possible similarity may indeed be due to the identity of the towns; but this is by no means certain, especially since the names as understood are mere appellations. Secondly, there are evident difficul- ties, though perhaps none that are insuperable, in believing that a patesi of Shirpurla could have built temples in Babylon, or would have spoken gratefully of Babylon's gods. Thirdly, the goddess Nana is prominent in Gishgalla-ki; so prominenit, indeed, that she is best regarded as the tutelary deity of the place. Marduk was the patron of Babylon. To identify Gishgalla-ki with Babylon involves the assump- tion, it seems to me, of a religious revolution of which history has given no inkling. In view, therefore, of the consequences of accepting this definition, the old view whiclh regards Gishgalla-ki as a quarter or inferior town of Shirpurla must be entertained until satisfactory his- torical proof be adduced that the goddess Nana was at one period the chief deity of Babylon. We have no great zeal in the imatter. What- ever the outcome of the investigation, it remains true that the patesis of Shirpurla held sway over the four towns or the civic quarters known as Girsu, Uru-azagga, Nina, and Gishgalla. The protectress of Shirpurla as a whole was the goddess Gatumdug, "the mother of Shirpurla " (5 no. 2, 1. 2; 14 col. i. 2, et passim). She sat enthroned in the town of Urui-azagga (14 col. iii. 6). But each of the four civic centers had, as already indicated, its own patron deity. The god Ningirsu was, as his title denotes, the lord of Girsu. The local divinity of Uru-azagga was the goddess Bau, child of Ana, heaven (8 col. iv. 5; 13 no. 2 col. i. 3; 13 no. 4 col. i. 3), the firstborn child of heaven (35 col. xx. 19). She occupied a great temple in Uru-azagga (8 col. iv. 6; 9 col. iii. 17; 13 no. 2 col. iii. 20 sq.), and was worshipped</page><page sequence="13">-Davis, Thl'e Gods of Shirpurla. ccxv as the mistress of this town (13 no. 2 col. i. 4, col. iii. 18, 19; 13 no. 4 col. i. 4). The goddess Bau is identified by Amiaud with Gatumdug, partly on the authority of a fragmentary text (IIR 59, 27 e, f, see Tableau compare, no. 158), and partly on account of her being called a " daughter of Ana " (RP. n. s. i. 58, presumably having in mind 35 col. ii. 4-2 from bottom). Of the town Nina-ki, the goddess Nina was, of course, the patroness. It is called her favorite city, she is the titular deity, and she had a notable temple in the place (35 col. ii. 2, 18; 37 no. 3, 9-12; London inscription, PSBA. xiii. 62, no. ii. 9 sq.). Of the town of Gishgalla, one would expect Lugal-Gisligalla to be patron. But as already intimated, this position is occupied by Nana. Slhe is the fore- most deity of Gishgalla in these inscriptions. Her temple in Gishgalla is mentioned (8 col. iv. 8, 9). This divine quaternion was not a loose aggregation of deities. As the several districts or towns formed one body politic, so three, at least, of the four local deities were members of the same family. This is not conjecture ; nor is it derived from texts which might misrepresent the conception current in Shirpurla. The information is furnished by the patesis themselves. Foremost among these four divinities was Ningirsu. He was the husband of the goddess Bau, the mistress of Uru-azagga (13 no. 3, col. ii. 3-6); and he was the brother of Nina, the protectress of Nina-ki (35 col. v. 17; see Zimmern, ZA. iii. 232 sq.). The goddess Nana^ was certainly, in the conception of the patesis, not identical with Nina, as Amiaud supposed that she was. They were children of differ- ent gods. She may have been regarded as Ningirsu's mother or, to speak more exactly, as his father's wife, being the goddess Nincharsag under another name. It would be rash to assert that she was. The argument is direct (Nana=Ishtar=wife of Enlil, VR. 8, 92 and 10, 52 variant), but it is derived from other texts than those of the patesis. Still, Gudea most honorably associates her with Enlil (Menant, Baby- lone et la Chaldee, p. 64), and he also bestows upon hor a prominent title of the wife of Enlil (13 no. 1, col. ii. 2, etc.). At any rate, the four quarters of Shirpurla were presided over respectively by Ningirsu, his wife Bau, his sister Nina, and Nana, possibly his mother. Each of these four deities was, in turn, the center or nucleus of a family. The writers of the tablets dwell upon the kinship. Ningirsu is stated to have been the son of Enlil (35 col. vii. 5, col. viii. 21), whose wife was Nincharsag (cp. 18, last column bottom; 36 col. xiii. 1, 2); to have himnself had to wife the goddess Bau; and to have been the father of the gods Galalim (36 col. vi. 4 and 5 from bottom) and Dunshagga (29 no. 1, 1-3). Bau, the mistress of Uru-azagga, was, of course, the center of but a small group; for she is already included in the family of Ningirsu, and her husbanid and children are reckoned there. Still, she forms the nucleus of a group. She is the daughter of Ana, and is associated with Ningishzida, a son of Ana, in the temple at Uru-azagga (13 no. 2 col. viii. 12, 13; and 36 col. xxiii. 5 from bottom). Nina, in some sense sister of Ningirsu, was the daughter of god Ea, king of Eridu (IVR* 1 col. ii. 38; OBI. i. pl. 30. col. i. 22). Like Ea's son</page><page sequence="14">ccxvi American Or iental Society's Proceedings, April 1895. Marduk (IVR* 4, col. iii. 23), so Nin&amp; is called a " child of Eridu " (35 col. xx. 16). Her consort was apparently the god Nirndara, who shares an attribute with her (8 col. v. 2; 37 no. 4, 2; IR 5 no. xxiii. 1 with 2 col. v. 1; 29 no. 4, 2 ; IR 5 no. xxiii. 2). Her daughter was Ninmarki (8 col. v. 10; 19=col. viii. 67 sq. of inscription). The goddess Nana is the center of another small group. The small- ness, as well as the composition, of the group is at once explained, if the suggestion that Nanr may have been regarded as Enlil's wife be correct. Her kindred are then largely included in the family of Ningirsu. Still, Nana is the center of a group. Gudea states that she was the daughter of the moon-god Ensu (PSBA. xiii. 158-159, 1. 1, 2); and it is apparently a consort of her who is mentioned under the title of Lugal-Gishgalla (8 col. ii. 2). It is probable that each of these four famailies was worshipped as a whole in the town of which its nucleus was the tutelary god. For such a custom prevailed in other towns. It can be demonstrated in the case of Girsu. It can be traced in the case of Uru-azagga; for the worship of one other member of the small family of Bau in addition to that of the goddess herself is attested; namely, the worship of Ningishzida. It can be discerned further in the case of Gishgalla; for there is explicit testimony that, side by side with the adoration paid by the patesis to the goddess Nana, homage was also rendered to Lugal-Gishgalla (Text of Entena cited by Hommel, PSBA. xv. 110). With these disclosures in regard to three of the towns in evidence, it is a reasonable conjecture that a family group was worshipped in each of the four towns. But while this is conjectural, it is certain that all of these groups were worshipped in the town of Girsu. The patesis dwelt in Girsu; and, as already stated, worshipped Ninigirsu and, in connection with him, his parents, his wife and his children. But the patesi wlho ruled in Girsu h-eld sway over the three other towns or civic quarters as well. He must do as much for the patrons of the other towns as he did for the patron of his own city. And so it came about that in Girsu temples stood to the four tutelary deities and their families. These four deities and their immediate kindred conistitute the gods of Shirpurla, properly so called. Not that they alone were known, nor that they alone were worshipped. Allusion is made to other gods. Shitlamtauddua, the king of the nether world, and the Anunnaki are mentioned. The sungod Bar and the dreaded Ishum are invoked. Some of the gods who receive mention in the inscriptions were doubt- less members of one or the other of these groups. Duizizuab probably belonged to the group of Nina (IIR56, 33). From sources outside of the records of the _patesis, it is known also that Shitlamtauddua had a temple in Girsu and was regarded as a son of Enlil (IIR61, 18. 19 b; IIIR 38, 1-3a; IVR35, no. 2,1-3). This lineage would make him, according to modern ideas, the brother of Ningirsu; and, for that matter, he may have been so regarded in Shirpurla. But a principle of this kind, if carried out, would have required a temple to each member of the vast Babylonian</page><page sequence="15">Datvis, lIte Godls of Shirpurla. ccx vii pantheon; for all the deities were interrelated according to the current genealogies, and Girsu would have been taxed to contain the sanctu- aries. But the god Shitlamtauddua need not have been worshipped there by reason of his kinship to the tutelary deity. A sufficient explana- tion of his worship there is that he was a great and terrible god, the ruler in that realm to which every human soul sooner or later goes. The gods of Shirpurla were four family groups. The members of these families, even though in themselves obscure, are the prominent gods in the records of the patesis. The other deities who occasionally figure at Shirpurla were intruders into the local circle, gods of a wider cult which peculiar emergencies, or unusual portents, or momentary dread brought into prominence. Of what has thus far been said, this is the sum: The gods of Shir- purla are found to have been four family groups; consisting of the tutelary deity of each of the four towns and his or her parernts, consort, and children. These four groups were further bound together by the mutual kinship, in three cases at least, of their central member; by the relationship which is emphasized of Ningirsu with Bau, his wife, and Nina, his sister. The god Ningirsu is the center about which the fourfold pantheon revolves. These results may be applied with illuminating effect to the inscrip- tions of the patesis. Take a record of building operations. Temples of course do not fall into decay and require reparation in logical sequence, yet there is always a logical order of enumeration. Uruka- gina, one of the earliest of the patesis, tells of certain temples which he erected (Collection de Clereq, tome ii. pl. viii). He does not once mention relationships; but it is evident that he is constructing sanctu- aries to the family of Ningirsu. No deity outside of this group is honored with a house; and the members of the family are enumerated in order; first, Ningirsu himself, then his two sons, his wife, and his father. Or take Ur-Bau's record of the temples which he fitted up (8 col. iii. 5 sq.). They chance to be in different quarters of Shirpurla. Yet similar phenomena of orderly enumeration appear. The temples erected are in Girsu two, namely, to Ningirsu and to his father's wife, Nincharsag; in Uru-azagga, one, to Bau; in Gishgalla, one, to Nana, the center of the local group; and in Girsu again, four to the family of Nina', namely, to her father, to her consort, to her father under a second name (Ninagal,=Ea, IIR 58, 58a-c), and to her daughter. Or instead of the records of building operations, take an enumera- tion of benefits conferred by the gods. Gudea acknowledges his indebtedness to heaven (9 col. i. 10 sq.). Again with a precision which inmplies a logical basis for the sequence, although not a word is said of kinship, the gods are grouped; and in this order: the father Enlil, the son Ningirsu, then his sister, his wife, and one who is supposed to be his wife under another name, then his two sons. With this may be compared a very similar list, 16-19 col. ii. 9 sq. Or take, finally, Gudea's curse of the rebellious (16-19 col. viii. 44 sq.). We cannot assert that he invokes only gods of the fourfold pantheon.</page><page sequence="16">ccxviii American Orient(l Society's Proceedings, Alpril 1895. Why should he? But, still, note the order of thought as the hot words pour forth. First come the parents of the four tutelary gods, Ana, Enlil and wife Nincharsag, Ea, and Ensu. Then follow the tutelary gods; Ningirsu of Girsu, Nina and her consort of Nina-ki, Gatumdug of Shirpurla as a whole, Bau of Uru-azagga, Nana of Gishgalla. Then come the sun-god Bar and the murderous god Ishum. Why these two are enumerated here may be variously explained. Then, of Ningirsu's family, his sons; of Nina's family, her daughter and Duzizuab; and, finally, of Bau's separate family, Ningishzida. Three general remarks may be made. The inscriptions from Telloh reveal, better perhaps than any other documents that are as yet accessi- ble to the public, first, that the genealogy of the gods was established, and established even in many minute details, as early as the time of the patesis of Shirpurla. Second, that in this genealogy the order, Anu, Bel, and Ea, was fixed. A glimpse of this fact is afforded by other early records also. Third, that Anu, Bel, and Ea were clearly recognized as standing at or near the beginning of the genealogy. They are distinctly parent gods. These three matters are of import- ance in the history of religion. 3. On the syntax of the Assyrian preposition ina; by Profes- sor J. Dyneley Prince, of the University of the City of New York. Few prepositions have the flexibility and extensive scope which is seen in the use of the Assyrian ina, and to a great extent also in that of its syntactical, if not etymological, equivalent, the l of the other Sem- itic idioms. By what was probably a very gradual process, ina has developed certain functions somewhat different froni those which seem naturally to belong to it. This fact, however, is not due to any pov- erty of prepositions peculiar to Semitic, because the varied application of ina does not appear to have restricted the force of other prepositions which co-exist synonymously in several usages. A discussion of the syntax of the preposition ina should be divided into two heads; the first treating of those cases in which ina is used to denote local position (in, at, or on) and the corresponding motion towards, and the second, of the cases in which the preposition appears to have evolved secondary meanings which seem to be developments from the fundamental local signification. It is highly probable that the original force of ina was position within a given place, implying that the subject was surrounded on all sides, a usage which still appears as one of the most common applications of the preposition; thus: ina alisu esirsu,* "I shut him up within his city" * The verb eseru is also used with ana; cf. ana isten maxazi-lu esir,unuti (I. R. Tig. c. v. 77/8); ana anilli esirsu, "I shut him up in prison" (?) (I. R. Senn. c. ii. 72).</page><page sequence="17">Prince, On the Syntax of' the Assyrian Preposition ia. coxix (I. R. Asurn. c. iii. 46); and also in composition with libbu and qirbu: e. g., with libbu, I. R. 27, No. 2, 37/8; with qirbu, I. R. Asurn. c. ii. 84. It will readily be seen that a preposition denoting position within could very easily be applied to express direction into, and we accord- ingly find ina thus used with a number of verbs of motion; thus, with erebu,* ' to enter,' I. R. Asurn. c. ii. 19/20; 87/8, and with ete*qu, ' to march,' I. R. Esarh. c. i. 53. This usage is of course found with libbu and qirbu: ina libbi userib, " I caused to enter therein " (II. R. 67, lla); ina qirib Nind illikamma, " came into Nineveh " (V. R. 1, 62). Ina, 'within, into,' came to be used very naturally also in the sense of ' among'; cf. the familiar phrases, inma sawra'ni rnaxrfiti, " among the former kings"; ina puaxur ilani, " among all the gods," etc.; also fre- quently in composition with libbu. Ina is employed similarly in com- position with birit, to express 'between'; cf. I. R. Asurn. c. i. 47, and passim. It is hardly necessary to cite examples to show that the preposition: in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Syriac is found in much the same senses as the Assyrian ina; namely, 'within, into, among.' The use of ina, 'in, into, among,' in composition with libbu and qirbu is exactly equivalent to that of the Hebrew m with 1I and n'lp. The Heb. l\, the cog- nate of libbu, is found sometimes, though rarely, in the sense of " midst " (cf. :s n:J, Exod. xv. 8; Ps. xlvi. 3; etc.). It is interesting to notice that the Ethiopic ba comparatively seldom denotes motion towards, but seems in its local meaning to be confined to the original idea of position in or at (cf. Dillmann, Athiop. Gramm., p. 306). On the other hand, the Ethiopic westa corresponds syntactically with ina in this sense bet- ter than does ba, as it is used in the same way to denote motion into. Furthermore, westa in composition with ba means ' among' (cf. Dillm. op. cit., p. 311/2).+ In Arabic the separate prep. S is employed to express both 'within' and 'into,' while . is almost always confined to the mneaning ' at' or ' near.' The Assyrian ina from denoting 'in, into,' came to be employed to express proximity in much the same way as the Arabic 'a and the Ethiopic ba. Such expressions as ina sep Labna, ta sep Ialmdn, "at the foot of Lebanon," etc., are of most common occurrence, and agree with such ordinary usages as the Hebrew pjtv Ltnfl, "by the river Sorek," and the Arabic s , "at the gate of Cairo." The familiar use of ina denoting position at or near, in compo- sition with battubatti, maxar, pdn, p't, qabal, sapal and tar9u, must also be classified under this head. * The prep. ana is also occasionally used in the sense of 'into'; cf. ana me nadu, "whosoever casts it into the water," (IV. R. 39, rev. 19; I. R. Tig. c. viii. 65). The use of '?N seen in Jon. i. 12, D3%? '?'1 should be compared in this connection. We also find erebbu with ana (1. R. Asurn. c. i. 83). f Westa from VIwasata with t instead of t, owing to the preceding sibilant, is probably cognate witlh Assyrian istu, ' from.'</page><page sequence="18">ccxx American Oriental Society's Proceedings, April 1895. It is interesting to notice that ina alone is used very seldom with verbs of motion with the meaning ' towards, unto,' which is the legiti- mate sense of ana. Even in expressions like ina ubandt xur?Oni ardi- sunuti, " I pursued them even unto (into) the tops of the mountains" (. R. Senn. c. iii. 81), it is clear that the preposition has the force of ' into,' rather than of 'unto.' In such a sentence as ina qat arddni tam- nuguma, ' she delivered him into (unto) the hands of his servants " (V. R. 3, 7), ina construed with man l might be regarded as the first step towards the meaning 'unto,' because manu% is generally found con- strued witli ana (cf. I. R. Tig. c. i. 88; c. iii. 9/10); sometimes, however, with no preposition at all (cf. I. R. Senn. c. iv. 50). Ina in composition with eli,* however, occasionally admits of the interpretation ' unto,' as s'a ina eli Assur amru, " who looked towards (i. e. belonged to) A." V. R. 3, 82. The Hebrew : also occurs in this sense, as C W 11:, Gen. xi. 4. Idioms like: j* n, -2 tfN indicate, noreover, that in Hebrew the meaning of : approached very closely the idea of motion at or unto. The Ethiopic enta, which may be an etymological cognate of ina, and is capable of almost as many shades of meaning, is used quite commonly in this sense to denote both position (Jud. i. 25) and direction towards (Matth. xii. 1). Enta denotes also motion through, as in John x. 1, 2, Matth. xii. 43. This is usually expressed in Heb. by Ina, " into," in the sense of ' against,' is quite common in Assyrian; thus: ina adia ixst', "they sinned against my ordinances" (V. R. 1, 118, 132, etc.). In this sense it is frequently found also in composition with irtu; e. g., ina irtia itllikfinimma (Senn. Const. 45); and with eli, as in sa ina eli Asur ilia sillatu iqpudu " who planned treason against A. my God " (V. R. 4, 67; II. R. 65, 4a). The meaning ' against' may be expressed by eli alone, to which the signification properly belongs, as well as by Viru, especially in the later inscriptions; cf. kakkia sa eli nakri askuntu, " my weapons which I had aimed against the foe " (Sargon Nimroud, 18; I. R. Senn. c. iii. 21/2), and gir gimnir ummandti, " against all the troops" (I. R. Senn. c. v. 61; V. R. 1, 60); etc. The idea of ' against,' which is the dativus incommodi, is also expressed quite properly in Assyrian by ana, which is essentially the preposition of the dative :t cf. ana palmnia suatu limnflti ilte'u, " whoever plans evil against this my image" (I. R. 27, no. 2, 87/8; I. R. Asurn. c. ii. 51 ; etc.). The use of : in both Hebrew and Aramaic in the sense of 'against' is well known; for example, in Isaiah xix. 2, with the verb Dln:. * Eli alone is not infrequently found synonyinous with ana; cf. eli Yarqu- umai'ru rakbesu, V. R. 1, 123/4; etc. f It is interesting to see that ana, being the sign of the dative, is used with verbs of trust and confidence; ana ArabA natkil, " trust thou in Nebo " (I. R. 35, no. 2. [2; AMurn. c. iii. 39; etc.), although the same idea is expressed in Heb. by . flD:, 3 ON1 (cf. also Caspari, Arab. Gramm., p. 260; Dillmann, Athiop. Gramm., p. 306).</page><page sequence="19">Prince, On the Syntax of thte Assyrian Preposition ina. ccxxi to fight against' ;* also Gen. xvi. 12 5 L: C t )?. Dillinann especially calls attention to the fact that the Ethiopic ba, although rarely used to denote motion towards, not infrequently means 'against' (Athiop. Gramm., p. 306). In this connection we may note that ina in such sentences as sa ina mrnri.su Asur .sar Igigi uttusu, which is tranislated by Abel, " whom Asur the king of the Igigi appointed during his childhood" (KB. i. 188. 2/3; 190, 1), is capable of the rendering 'in spite of :' thus, 'in spite of his youth.' That this is also a possible, though not generally recognized interpretation of the Heb. n may be seen from Eccl. v. 13, '3VI Tn I "in spite of his sore travail"; Isaiah ix. 20, n, II in spite of all this"; etc. It is not impossible also to regard the use of ina in the Assyrian sentence just quoted as equivaleiit in force to the Hebrew adverbial :, the so-called c essenttice in such expressions as jrtJn Isaiah xl. 10. The Assyrian sentence could imiean "I whom A. appointed as or for his soni." This, however, would be properly expressed by ana; cf. anta dannitti,suactkun anta siriqti isruqni. As i?ma is essentially the preposition of position, it is natural to find it denoting also superposition, 'on, over,' and the corresponding motion. It is the regular preposition to express situation on a height; na sad Panari (I. R. Tig. c. ii. 37, etc.). It is used of travelling " on foot," imia se_pia (I. R. Senn. c. i. 69); " on a horse," iuc sisi arkabma (1. c. 86/7); and " upon (or in) a ship," ina elippi-irkab (I. R. Asurn. c. iii. 33) (cf. Jon. i. 3). In this seinse ina is used in composition with cli and m7uxxi, the force of which it seenms to strengthen; thus, ina eli kigalli sa Sin sgat*Irma, " it stood written on the tablets of Sin" (V. R. 3, 121); sa ina rnutxxi ft,ibf,t upon wlich they sat" (V. R. 6, 20). Although elit aloiie has frequently the force of position on or over (cf. I. R. Tig. c. vii. 58), it is more usual to find it in this sense in composition with ima. The use of ina to denlote motion on or over is very common; cf. ina ku3si figibbzima, " he took his seat upon the throne " (Sarg. Prunkinschr. 84), which should be carefully distinguished from ina kussi garr12ti rabis fisibu, " I was seated with dignity upon my royal throne " (I. R. Asurn. c. i. 44). Ina occurs in composition with eli t and muxxi in this sense; cf. biltu u madatta ina elisuunu a?kun, "tribute and tax I laid upoIn them" (I. R. Tig. c. v. 80/1; etc.). Perhaps the most striking instance of the use of ina in this sense is seen in the conistruction of the preposition with sataru, 'to write upon.' This is found construed with ina alone, as ina naria u temmenia altur (I. R. Tig. c. viii. 43); with ina in composition with libbu; ina libbi altur (I. R. Asurn. c. i. 69); witli * In Assyrian the regular prep. with verbs meaning to fight is itti, 'with '; cf. I. R. Tig. c. i. 51/5, with s'andnu, and with rnaxdau, Tig. c. iii. 55/6. DtlnS in Hebrew is also found with J)X as well as with '. t The prep. 9iru is also used to denote superposition; cf. IMI. R. 14, 10, 'over.' t Eli alone is also used thus: cf. I. It. Asurn. c. iii. 54; c. ii. 106; ?iru alone; cf. ukin riruessu, I. R. Esarh. c. iii. 18; etc. VOL. XVI.

Obelisk, 72, and passim).* The Hebrew-Aramaic n , like ina, is also used to denote position on a height; cf. :nn, 1 Kings viii. 9; 8p": IK , Num. xiv. 10; Deut. xxxi. 15; t)D1D: ? Isaiah lxvi. 20. The Heb. verb , 'to write' (upon), like the Assyrian ?atatru, is used with n (cf. Deut. xxviii. 61; 1 Kings xxi. 11), especially in the sense of recording (cf. Exod. xvii. 14; Num. v. 23; etc.). t It will be seen fromn the above cursory view that the variations of the fundamental conceptions of position and motion towards expressed by ina must be regarded as developments from the ina of position within. It may be shown likewise that the several secondary usages of the pre- position about to be described were also developecl from the same origi- nal idea. These usages may be classified as follows: 1. the ina of condition and manner; 2. the ia of time; 3. the ina of accom- paniment; the ina, 4. of instrument; o. of quality; 6. of cause; 7. the partitive ina, and its natural development, the ina of motion from or out of. 1. It is easy to see how from the idea of being in or at a place was developed the idea of being in a condition. An excellent illustration of both the local use and the use of ina to denote manner may be seen in the sentence: ina xidtti risdti erub ina bit riduti, " in joy and gladness I entered into the harem " (V. R. 1, 23). Ina is very commonly applied in adverbial phrases like ina liti, "victoriously " (I. R. Esarh. c. iv. 40); ina la meni, " without number," passim.t This latter expres- sion is more usually found with ana; cf. ana la minamn (Shalm. Monol. c. ii. 43; I. R. Senn. c. ii. 17; etc.). The use of the preposition in ina lisan m4t Axarru, "in the language of the Westland," should also be classified under this head (Sarg. Prunkinschr. 161/2; also, I. R. Esarh. c. ii. 24-6). We find in Hebrew a precisely cognate usage of : in expressions like , Ps. lxxiii. 8; ;,*. :8Xn , Josh. xxiv. 14, and in the many adverbial idioms like t.:3n l, 'hastily' (cf. also the Aramaic NjjtjrNn, 'finally'). A similar usage is found in Ethiopic with ba; cf. Matth. xxviii. 8. 2. A preposition denoting both position in or at and condition and manner could also be used to express, first, time when, and then, dura- tion of time, while.' The inscriptions are full of such idioms as atta ina alakika, "when thou goest " (IV. R. 17, 45, a; 24, 34b; IIT. 208, no. 49); and even more vividly in ina isten iimi, " on one day," ina galalti umi, " on the third dav," passin.g Ina is used in this sense in compo- * Satadru also occurs with eli and with giru; Sarg.

The ina expressing duration of time ('while') is also of very common occurrence; cf. ina kussi, " while on my throne " (I. R. Senn. c. iii. 76); ina tartia, " during my return" (1. c., c. i. 40); ina mitiq girria, " during the progress of my march," etc. * The familiar use of the Heb. n with the infin., to express 'when, while, although, because,' as in ; l "when thou comest hither," is an exact cognate of the Assyrian idiom seen in ina alakika. Expressions like 1V1nlCn Dol)l may be cited as parallel to ina isten umi. Duration of time ('while') is usually expressed in Heb. by fly7; e. g., Jer. xv. 9; Ps. cxlvi. 2. 3. Examples of ina in the sense of 'within,' that is, 'among' have already been quoted. From the idea of ' among,'-it must be supposed that ina came to be applied in the less usual sense in which it is found in Beh. 8, i. e. 'in company with,' ina Mabe i!itu. In this case it appears to usurp the function of adi (I. R. Asurn. c. iii. 19), of itti (I. R. Tig. c. viii. 59). and of gadu (Sarg. Prunkinschr. 28). This construction of ina has an exact counterpart in the Heb. 1 of accompaniment in expressions like JLV:J Vn , Gen. ix. 4; xv. 14; etc., and in the common idiom K ": 'come with,' i. e. 'bring' (cf. Arabic _ 'come with, bring,' etc.). The composition of ina withl balu, to express ' without,' should also be mentioned in this connection; cf. sa ina balusu, ' without whom,' passirn. Cognate usages are the Hebrew 17:1 and K: and the Arabic J and 4. The instrumental usage of ina is verv common. There can be no doubt that this usage is a development of the ina of time and accom- paniment just mentioned. To attack a city in company with an army could very readily be transferred to mean by means of an army. Occa- sionally the use of ina is so anmbiguous as to leave the reader in doubt whether the preposition was intended to denote position in, time when, or instrument; thus: ina sutti usabrisuma, " in a dream I dreamed it'" (during, or by means of, a dream ? ), V. R. 2, 97; ina epiri iqabirsu, "who buries it in (or by means of) the dust" (I. R. 27, no. 2, 59); etc. In such expressions as ina tukulti A?ur-allik, " by means of the aid of Ashur (or 'along with' ?) I went," the instrumental force of ina is more apparent. We find it still more vividly in ina kakki ramalnisu uqatci napistus, "he destroyed his life with (by) his own weapon" (Sarg. Cyl. 27); ga ina Agur belia akgudu, " which I had conquered by means of A. my lord" (Tig. c. viii. 13); etc. It occasionally happens that the idea of instrument is expressed by the noun alone, without any explanatory preposition, as in atmux ritfia, "II seized with my hand" (I. R. Senn. c. v. 60). * Cf. also ana isten uimi la uballitsu, " for a single day he did not let him live "; III. R. No. 6, 13.</page><page sequence="22">ccxxiv American Orientca Society's Proceedings, April 1895. The instrumental use of the Hebrew and Aramaic n, as in jj",n, Isaiah lviii. 1; also, to strike with the sword, :? 1, Josh. x. 11 (also Ararnaic 8 -nnl), is well known. The idiom l 37nV: , 'to swear by' (1 Kings i. 17, 30) has its exact equivalent in tamf ina. The Arabic and Ethiopic ba is also used instrumentally; cf. &amp;.6JU &amp;x2;;, "he slew him with the sword," and in Etbiopic, Ps. xvi. 9, "cover me with thy wings." The idiom baeda, " in the band, by means of," is the same as the Syriac ,.;= (Noldeke, Syr. Gracmm., p. 171). 5. Very nearly allied with the imia of instrument is the use of the pre- position to denote the material of which a tlhing is made; cf. ina agurri raqpu, " which were constructed of brick" (I. R. Tig. vi. 1); ina agurri supu?at, " it was made of bricks " (V. R. 6. 28). This is cognate with the Heb. n of material in 1 Kings vii. 14: Lev. xiii. 52; etc.* 6. The hm,ta of cause, ' by reason of,' follows very closely on the ina of instrumernt, and is quite as frequently used; cf. ina qibit Asur-ana Zamua aMkunu dikuitu, " by reason of the commanrd of A.-I ordered an expedition againt Z." (I. R. Asurn. c. ii. 55, passin). In this connection it should be mentioned that ina is found in compo- sition with eli, to strengthen the meanilng closely connected with the idea of catuse which is peculiar to that preposition, i. e. ' with regard to;' cf. ina eli ardi SCa Amuse, " concerning the servant of A." (K. 486, 1, in BA. i., p. 187), and in the epistolary literature, passim. Eli sometimes occurs alone in this sense, as in eli ammati anndti, "concerning these things" (V. R. 4, 21), etc. 7. Finally, there can be little doubt that the frequent and natural use of ina in the sense of ' among ' gave rise to the peculiar idiom seen in the contract tablets, where the preposition actually appears in a parti- tive sense; thus, 20 mane 'ipati ina pappasu Ululu, u "20 m. of wool among (i. e., from) the revenue of the month Ululu" (Strm. Nbd. no. 41; BA. i., p. 494); GUN 'ip'ti ina pappasu sa bit Aunitum (Strm. Nbd. no. 109; BA. i., p. 495); still more vividly: ina libbi i manu', 7 siqil kaspi rexi, "I from this (a sum before specified) he paid i m.i, 7 s. of silver" (Strm. Nbd. 262; BA. i., p. 510). A passage precisely parallel to this, and one illustrative of the full force of ina in this sense, is found in Strm. Nbd. 410 (BA. i. 522), where ultut is used instead of ina: 24 mane ispati, 5 siqle ultu kaspi. This explains also the extraordinary application, so common in Assyrian, of ina in the sense of 'out of, away from,' although there can be no doubt that this usage is also closely connected in idea with the instrumental force of the preposi - tion; cf. the prep. with akdlu and situ : ina libbi ekulu istu, "I they ate and drank therein" (V. R. 6, 21; IV. R. 13, 55/6); ina p"unu kabti luVamma, " from their exalted mouth (i. e., by means of) let it go forth" * We occasionally find tn in this sense in Heb. as r in ., Gen. ii. 19; cf. also the Arabic _52) vy.iO "of gold," t Ultu is very probably a fem. formation from the same stem as eli.</page><page sequence="23">Prince, On the Syntax of the Assyrian Preposition ina. ccxxv (IV. R. 45, rev. 37/9). The Inost vivid use of ina, 'out of,' is seen in sentences like ina marti luxalliq?t, " may they destroy (his family) from the land" (1. c. 35). The construction of verbs of fleeing and fearing with ina pan should also be mentioned here; so with pal'xu, I. R. Tig. c. iii. 17/8; Asurn. c. ii. 113; with ipparsidu, I. R. Tig. c. v. 55/6; ina is also used with et(ru, nap xu, kuzubu, and other verbs. The fact that paldxu, for example, is construed with iMtu pOn serves to illustrate the force of ina here as 'away from'; cf. Asurn. c. ii. 61/2; 99.* In agreement with the Assyrian usage, we find both in Hebrew and Aramaic the : used idiomatically with DMrj and , " to eat or drink from a vessel," cf. Ps. cxli. 4; Gen. xliv, 5; and in Aramaic, Dan. v. 2. As to the derivation of ina, the last word has clearly not yet been said. The numerous attempts to derive both ana and ina from stems containing :, such as jlr (Hineks), ji t (Sayce), l.l (Bertin), are not very satisfactory; nor does it seem necessary with Lagarde to separate the two prepositions etymologically (GGN. 1881, p. 376). It is certainly strange also to derive ama, which denotes motion towards, from a stem n p X expressing motion from, as seen in the Arabic s ; nor can the derivation of ina from this stem be admitted (in spite of Del., Prol. p. 132, n. 1), because the secondary meaniing, 'out of, away from,' some- times seen with ina, is probably, as shown above, a legitimate develop- ment from its original significationi, 'among.' Scbrader, whose opinion, as expressed in ZDMG. xxvi., p. 290, was so contemptuously passed over by Lagarde, was probably not far wrong in seeing in both ana and ina the same stem as that found in the Hebrew I (tfl) and Arabic J,@ . It is highly probable, as Kraetzschmar has pointed out, that the -na in both ina and ana is the demonstrative enclitic stem seen in ginatina, which is also evident in the verbal particle ni = nu (BA. i., p. 397/8). His explanation of the root-vowels i and a as being more or less arbitrary developments from an unknown stem ' + na is very satis- factory. If this view be adopted, the striking syntactical similarity between ina and 1 may be explained by supposing that, while the Assyrian was content merely to prefix the vowels i and a to the demonstrative root na,t it became necessary in the other Semitic idioms to add to these combinations the distinct prepositional elements : and 5 . Traces of this are seen in the Sabaean form n = , 7 = 5. It must be sup- posed then that the final I ultimately disappeared. It is decidedly not permissible to assume an aphaeresis of an original X or 5 in Assyrian; * The verb paldxu is also construed with ana; V. R. 5, 96. t Traces of the same demonstrative 7i are to be found in the cognate preposi- tions; the Ethiopic enta (e + n + ta), the Hebrew TN (Assyr. itti), and perhaps the Arabic .</page><page sequence="24">ccxxvi Anierican Orienttal Society's Proceedings, April 1895. that is, that ina and ana were worn down from *bina and *lana respec- tively. The prepositional element 5 is well known in Assyrian in the combination lapan, 'before,' and there would probably remain some trace of its occurring with ana, had this ever been the case. It seems highly probable, therefore, that the Assyrian ina-ana may be said in a certain sense to be actually cognate with the : and t of the other Semitic dialects. 4.

On a dated Greek Inscription from Syria; by Professor Isaac H. Hall, of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City. Marble fragment of tombstone from Tripoli, Syria. Found in 1894. The stone is the property of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. It is broken in two in the middle from top to bottom, but not so as seriously to interfere with the reading, except in the last complete line. Size of fragment, 10 x 4 inches, nearly 1 inch thick. Seven lines present, and illegible parts of an eighth. How many more lines were present can only be conjectured. Letters from 1 to j inch high: very peculiar: H for H; A and A for A Y' for Y; Z, with the bottom stroke curved. Otherwise like later Greek; E, C, IA (M), &amp;c., being approximately the forms for these letters. No division of words. Lines run clear across. Readiiig: Line 1.

TOT ZMY TOT [M]H[N]OC AH(AAAIOT E The substance of it is that Sekagantigona, daughter of Dametrios and Socrates (here, as sometimes elsewhere, a feminine name), was born on the 27th of the month Apellaeus in the year 438; that she departed this life at the age of 9 on the 5th day of the month Apellaeus, in the</page><page sequence="25">Jacekson, 0n tlhe Qutestion of the Date of Zoroaster. ecxxvii year 447; and her parents set up the stone to commemorate her. The exact construction of the phrase which means " the prosperous dealer in salt fish," and of the phrase that gives the name of the mother, deserve some discussion, which I have no time to go into now, and for that reason I withhold a translation. But we have two sentences com- plete (the first ending with the mother's name, the second with XAPIN), and one incomplete one. The valuable thing about the inscription, however, is the dates. They are of the Seleucid era, which the Syriac writers call " the year of Alexander," and " the year of the Greeks," which begins October 1, B. C. 311. The dates here are written in a manner which reverses the ordinary Greek style; the units, tens and hundreds going from left to right, in each nuumber lhere occurring. As the month is Apellaeus, answering to our December, we must subtract 312 from the numnber of the year in order to reduce it to the Christian era. Accordingly the date of the girl's birth falls in the year 438--312, or A. D. 126; that of her death in the vear 447-312, or A. D. 135. The difference between the two 1s 9 years, as givenl on the stone: although. as she was born on the 27th and died on the 5th of the month Apellaeus, she lacked three weeks and one day of the full 9 years. The date of the stone must, of course, be about the same as that of the death; probably early in the next (A. D.) year, or in the same Seleucid year 447; which would make the date of the inscription quite near the beginning of the year A. D. 136. 7. On tfle question of the date of Zoroaster; by Professor A. V. Williams Jacksoni, of Colutmbia College iii tlhe City of New York. This communication, the details of which will be given in full in JAOS. xvii., presented in its various aspects the much mooted question as to the period in the world's history in which the Prophet of Iran appeared. First were discussed those passages in the classics which assign to Zoroaster the fabulous antiquity of B.C. 6000 or 5000. Second, all the material was presented which connects Zoroaster's name with that of the uncertain Semiramis and Ninus. The present writer had formerly believed that the date of the prophet's activity was to be placed at least a thousand years before the Christian era; there seemed to be sufficient ground for abandoning such a view and rejecting the above numbers. Third, the old traditional date which assigns the prophetic career of Zoroaster to the sixth century before Christ was taken up and discussed at length. Two passages in the Pahlavi scriptures, Arda-i Viraf i. 1-5 and Bun- dahish xxxiv. 7-8, including some similar references, were examined in the light of a large number of allusions to Zoroaster's date in Arabic writings and in some Syriac works. All of these, like Firdausi's Shah Namah, consistently set the time of the appearance of the great relig-</page><page sequence="26">coxxviii Amaeric,an Orientatl Society's Proceedhings, A4pril 18953 ious teacher of Persia at about 300 years before Alexander's invasion. Other support for this view was given, and the pappr came to the con- clusion that, at least, with our present data, we may best assign the date of Zoroaster as falling between the latter half of the seventh cen- tury B. C. and the middle of the sixth century B. C.-a result which is of importance for the position of Zoroastrianism in the study of com- parative religion. 8. The Sanskiit root nmath in Avestan; by Professor A. V. 'Williamiis Jacksoni. Our chief authority for the existence of the Sanskrit root Vnath ' cut, pierce, kill' in Avestan rests upon the noun snatha- 'a blow,' snaithis- 'weapon' and upon the occurrence of the obscure form d5i6snatheiti (is it drut snatheiti ?, cf. M 3) in Fragm. viii. 2 (Westergaard)-see Justi Handbuch der Zendsprache. The position of the root in Avestan, how- ever, may perhaps be a little strengthened from the Av. fragment in the Pahlavi Vendidad iv. 52 seq. (Darmesteter, Le Zend-Avesta, traduc- tion iii. 47), aetahe thnasat tbisanuha ' he wounds through his malice.' In this event, thnasat would stand for snathat, an assumption which is perfectly permissible on phonetic grounds. The interchange of th and s implied in th na 4 at is not uncommon in later texts, cf. Jack- son Av. Gram. I. 77 n 2, and consult Bartholomae Vorgeschichte g 33 n, in Geiger and Kuhn's Grunidriss d. iran. Sprachen. 9. Avestan htizva in Sanskrit; by Pr ofessor Edwin WV. Fay,, Washinigtoni and Lee University, Lexillgton, Vilginia. Under normal phonetic conditions hizva would correspond to Sk. *sihvd, Indiranic *sizhvd, but the actual Sk. word is jihva&lt; Indiranic *zizhva. Did Indiranic have a pair *sizhvd, *zizhvd ? were both or was only one of them normal? The Sk. doublet jihva, juh-u ' tongue' doubt- less belongs, esoterically considered, to root hut, hvd 'call;' and if Indiranic *sizhvd be the abnornmal term, there may have been beside it a *sltzhi1. Now this term is found at VS. i. 30 in the sentence agnrer jihva 'si suhftr 'tthou art Agni's tongue, the loud-calling,' where suhfIr seems, barring a proper name, hapax legomenon. If the Indo-Iraniani. had *zuzhu 'tongue,' and alongside of it *suzhii 'loud-calling' as its epithet, then not only *zuzhut but also *zizhva were liable to a popular change to *suzhu, *sizhvCj. Into exoteric etymology I will not here go, but refer to Collitz, i;The Aryan Name for the Tongue" in Oriental Studies of the Oriental Club of Philadelphia, and to myself in Mod. Lang.

Oni Rig-Veda x. 73; by Professor Edwin W. Fay. This hymn is fairly entitled to rank among the most obscure of the Rig-Veda. Grassmann's translation of the hymn is introduced by the words " das Lied ist vielfach dunkel, zum Theil ganz unverstdndlich.." In his notes on stanza 2, Ludwig says: " bietet auszerordentliche schwi- rigkeit ;" and Bloomfield (JAOS. xvi. p. 38) declines to translate the same stanza. The difficulties seem to me to proceed from a misunder- standing of the reference of a single term in the first stanza, whieh I will now proceed to discuss: it reads, Stz. 1. jdinisth ugrah sahase teurdya mandrd ojistho batb/tdl injinah avardhcnn indram mnaruta, aid atra niatad yad viraih dacdhanad dhdc4tisthi 'Thou wast born strong for mighty advancing, Jolly, most strong, of manifold pride. [These] helped Indra, the Maruts, to wit, that time When the mother o' the hero helped him, she the most-helpful.' So much for a verbal translation in which the order of the thoughts is rendered rather than the grammatical construction; as to this last there can be scarcely any question among scholars. I differ, however, from the current and undisputed explanation of mata as Indra's mother. Pida c immediately suggests the cloud-battle, and it is safe to say that if d were blotted out, scholarly emendation would fill the gap by a reference to Ahi-Vrtra, Indra's arch-antagonist. I therefore refer vircrn to Vrtrd, and mdta-dhdnisthd to his mother, D4nu, noting the assonances in the names, and asking whether dtra ydd would as naturally be used of a relation of identity (=et-et, cum- tum) as of contrast. We have warrant in RV. i. 32. 9 for marshalling Vrtra and his mother against Indra; n7cdvcayd aobhavad vrtrdp utrJ- 2ndro asqacz ava vaa7har jabhdra. ?ittarc sur (idharah patra dsicd d4nuh paye sahdvats4 nau d7henmh 'Exhausted in strength became she that hath Vrtra to her son; Indra her weapon off-warded: Above, the mother; underneath, the son was; Danu lies like a cow with her calf.' Further, there is excuse for referring vircm to Vrtra. Thus in RV. ii. 30. 4 Indra-Brhaspati is charged to slay virdn (demons), and here allusion to Vrtra is indubitable; while at vii. 99. 5 Indra again slays virdn, where the allusion, though less definite, is certain too.</page><page sequence="28">ccxxx American Oriental Society's Proceedings, April 1895. On the other hand, not only is the reference of mata and virdm to Indra the more obvious, but it is not to be denied that Indra and his mother are thrice introduced. Thus in viii. 77. 1-3 Indra, at birth, jajn- dnad, asks his mother to tell him kd ugr6h ke ha Vrivire 'who are mighty, who are famed;' she thereupon points out to him the demon ahki.va whom he forthwith slays; in viii. 45 . 4-5, the same question from Indra is answered by his mother's likening any enemy of Indra's to mist on the mountains (?). In iv. 18. 11 the situation is somewhat different, for here the mother addresses her new-born son: uta mata mahisamn adnv cavenad and tv&amp; jahatiputtra de vcch atha 'brav7d vrtram tn(lro hanisydn sakhe visno vitararn vz kramasva 'And the mother unto her inighty [son] turned: " Yon leave thee, son, yon gods," Then cried Indra, being about to slay Vrtra, "Friend Visnu step a little further away."' It were vain to deny that from these passages we might speak of Indra's mother-whoever she was-as his helper in battle, and more- over, in the first passage jatdh and ugra6h suggest jdnisthah and ugrdh of our stanza. But elsewhere the relations of Indra to his mother as his inciter to battle are expressed in the dialogue form which is lacking here. As the result of argument on this point we must admit that the mdta and virdm in question may be DaTnu and Vrtrd; but ' may be' is a far cry from ' must be.' Does the hymn contribute further in our dilemma ?

Prgni?], sie erh6hten mit vilem preise Indra; das war gleichsam um- hullt vom groszen orte, ausz dem dunkel, der ferne kamen sie als kinder hervor [die Marut]." This is not very clear, to say the least of it. Grassmann's difficulties are evidenced by his translation: "Sich an ihn schmiegend sass sie da wie eine Racherin; sie [die Maruts] starkten den Indra vielfach durch Lobgesang; umgeben gleichsam waren diese [Orte, etwa die Wolken, in denen die Wasser eingeschlossen waren] von dem weitschreitenden [Indra oder Vischnu?]; aus der dunkeln Tagesfrtlhe erhoben sich die neugeborenen [Wasser ?]."</page><page sequence="29">Fay, On Rig- Veda x. 73. eecxxxi The kernel of the difficulty with this stanza lies in ta. Ludwig's note and Grassmann's rendering warn us off from the neut. plur., and there is no clearing-up to be got from Ludwig's version in his notes as inst. sg., a proceeding otherwise unjustified on the side of the form. Let us, assuming that mdtf in stz. 1 referred to Vrtra's mother, take td as nom. dual and thus translate the stanza: 'In [her] witch's usual way she crouched clinging quite (cid) close; With a loud song they (the Maruts) helped Indra; Covered-over-like were they two (Vrtra and Danu) by Long-Stride (i. e. Indra); Out from the dark prapitva* flowed the [cloud-] children.' To justify this translation I beg to note that the description of pada a is closely parallel with i. 32. 9d: e. g., ntsattd 'crouched' is parallel with gaye lies; prgani ' close-clinging' is parallel witlh sahacvatsd na dhenithI 'like a cow with her calf.' I further call attention to the chiastic arrangement of cd of stz. 1, and ab of stz. 2: c (Indra and the Maruts) and d (Danu and Vrtra) make a chiasmus with a (Danu and Vrtra) and b (Indra and the Maruts). For my version of stz, 2 I make bold to claim a conspicuous clearness due to taking mata and virdm of stz. I for Danu and Vrtra.

Here I vary from the other translators in taking vaja as ' steeds,' thus carrying on the thought of a; and similarly at the end I take 4 of aVvind a in the sense of 'just like' (cf. Grassmann W6rt. s. v.), and so describe Indra's speed again by likening him to the Agvins in his advance. * I am inclined to follow Bloomfield (1. c., p. 24 sq.) in referring ?pitva to pitu 'drink,' taking prapitvd here in the approximate sense of I cloud ' as a source of water. The 'cloud-children' (gdrbhah) are of course the rains.

In a I construe adhi as a verb with agat in c, and in c I recognize two verbs a [agdt], and later on upa algqt. Now as the roots i and gam with crthant mean 'go to work' (cf. B6htlingk, W6rt. s. v. drtha), I con- strue cdhi + ga with drtham, followed by the dativus commodi pra- ja4yai. Against this construction the most pertinent objection rises from the dissociation of cdhi and rtad, of which combination we hlave two other instances in RV. Still hi 'for' of c strongly implies a declara- tive sentence before it, for which cdhi [agat] seems far the most nat- ural verb. We must assume that the pada-k&amp;ra is in error in reading &amp;-agtt instead of a-agat. So far as I can see, neither Ludwig nor Grassmann pay any attention to the iniitial a of c. This I take to be proleptic for the final agJt with iupa. I take dbhir as proleptic for mnihah., but am quite sensible of the fact that there is some harshness in doing so. This seems to me less violent than taking atbhir as referring to praj4ydi and translating " um ihretwillen" with Grassmann. Ludwig construes dbhir with maya'h (=mdyaih),* which is not convincing on the side of the form. Less violence is done to normal conditions if we take maya4, at the last resort, as a terminal ace. with the verb of motion, thus rendering c: * If we could grant that m.ayah is instrum., I would derive the form, not from qnayd-iI, but make it a plural of vidyal inst. sg. (cf. the author, Am. Jr. Phil. xv 428). I ask if the maya? of our text may not be inst. sg. with pragrhya vowel? Such vowels are after all a mere diacritic device, and thus nom. and inst. in d might be distinguished. I note the loc. in f to -i-stems (cf. Whitney2, 138, d, and 336, f). At any rate in x. 29. 3 manisal a is written with a pragqhya inst. sg. in -a. If ma-ya can be taken as inst. sg., then it is in apposition with abhir- 'with these as his trick.'

Here the balanced structure of each pada is noticeable. In b the writer seems to pique himself on his cleverness in defining d9va by 6jas. I would therefore venture to suggest that we have here a sort of riddle or brahmodya, which Bloomfield (JAOS. xv. 172 sq.) explains as a sort of theological quiz. If this is true, we might expect to find unusual meanings here for d!va and 6jas. By prehistoric etymology d!va might mean ' cloud' or ' water' (cf. Sibree, Academy, No. 1018, and the author, Proc. Am. Phil. Assoc., 1894, p. xi). I have urged (PAOS., Dec., 1894, p. clxxiii) that dqva means 'liquid ' at RV. viii. 26. 24. So, if Agni, the lightning, is apam ndp&amp;t 'waters' son,' then it ilight be said of Indra, the lightning, dav&amp;d iy&amp;ya 'from water he came.'

It was inevitable that the Vedic Hindus should confound civa ' rain,' with dva ' horse,' and indeed both words proceeded doubtless from a common epithet 6gva 'the swift,' which had come to be applied to the horse par excellence before the end of the primitive period. Thus we can more easily understand the mythologi- cal role of the horse in the Vedas, and the statement (gat. Brah. v. 1. 4. 5; vii. 5. 2. 18) that "1 lightning is a horse descended from the waters, or the clouds " (Bloomfield, 1. c. 178, note). In pada b we can give to ojas also the meaning ' water,' not only by etymology (cf. Grk. vy-p6'g 'wet'), but on the positive testimony of the Vedic lexicographers.* In manyit I see the sense of 'wrath,' used to define 6jas in its ordinary sense of 'might' more narrowly. Thus, by way of double entendre, 6jas mediates between dava and manyit, We might press manyi into the sense of ' storm' as a display of wrath and might. In RV. x. 83 the personified Manyu is called, among other things, Vdruna 'sky' (Grk. 'Ovpav6g), he is provided with a thunderbolt (v. stz's 1, 2, 6), and is identified also with Indra (stz. 2). I take the content of abe to be that the lightning-god came froim cloud, water, and sky, or, in one word, from storm, and became fire upon men's hearths (harmyeu f tasth&amp;u). It even has been supposed that Agni t is the subject of the verbs in these padas, but we have seen how lightning is a common aspect of Agni and Indra. In d the poet turns helplessly away from these hard questions con- cerning Indra's origin, and declares that this is known to the god alone. The literary tone here reminds one of the famous cosmogonic hymn, RV. x. 129, which ends with the following words: so aigd veda yadi vat nad vreda 'he (the supreme god) alone knows (the origin of the world)-or suppose he does not know?'

The real Indra of the Rig-Veda; by Professor Edward Washburn Hopkins, of Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, Pa. It has been claimed by Oldenberg* that the common view in regard to Indra is incorrect; that this god was in the eyes of the poets a mountain-deity, not a storm-godt of the atmosphere. The Rig-Veda speaks of Indra with no doubtful voice. Speculation may perhaps make out his prototype to be an earth-giant, an Old Man of the Mountains. But what says the Rig-Veda of Indra? itrdhvo' hy asthtd ddhy antdrike 'dha vl-traya _prd vadhdmh jabh&amp;tra miha'h vdstna upa him ddudrot tigmayudho ajayac chactrum indra4.t In this hymn Indra is represented as the battle-god of the people, but at the same time as the god that lets the streams flow forth. He does this in the usual way. There is nothing extraordinary in the scene which the poet paints. Indra smites the demon that keeps back the flood. The god " stood on high," not on the mountain; for the poet, as if to guard expressly against any other interpretation, adds " on the inter-space " (between sky and earth). " He rushed down on him (the demon) with a sharp weapon (Iightning)? and enveloped in cloud." A moment later the poet invokes Indra as Brhaspati, the lord of strength, and cries out ava ksipa divo' dQmdnarn: "From (or of)'the sky cast down the stone (wherewith thou didst slay thv enemies)."II This is the anthropomorphic Indra of the Rig-Veda, the only Indra whose single personality is deducible from the literary data; and hence the only Indra whose personality has any historical value. Nor need one do more than turn a page or two to find ample confirmation of this fact. Indra's host is of the sky alone: utac syac na indro vi vccarsanir divdh2 Vardhena marutena sukcrctuh, etc.?T Not only does the god stand on the inter-space, but even the parama rajansi, the "highest spaces" conceivable, are near to him. It is " out of the inter-space " that Indra sends sustenance (of rain).** Indra was born " in the highest heaven," for there " he drank soma as soon as he was born."tt In view of so explicit passages as are these, it is evident that the Vedic poet has no such notion of Indra as would tend to equate the god * Die Religion des Veda, pp. 141 ff. t Oldenberg holds that the myth was originally a storm-myth, that Indra's bolt was first lightning, and that Indra thus became "for the Vedic poets " a giant and mountain myth. t RV. ii. 30. 3. ? That Indra's weapon is not wind but lightning is sufficiently shown by the use of a9Lini (below), the bolt itself, as well as of didy"it (below).

But a view based on the reverse process cannot be accepted as an addition tQ Vedic exegesis. The 'splitting of the mountains,' whether of earth or of air, is but the manifestation of the great atmosphere-god's power when he is already invested with the characteristics of a supreme deity. The fall of rain goes together with the rise of the rivers. Indra lets out the rivers, but that he does not do so as a mountain-giant is shown by the ethereal position assigned to him by the poets.f The comparison with Parjanya, which Oldenberg institutes, is per- fectly legitimate, but the points of difference appear to be unduly esti- mated. If we examine the phraseology of the Parjanya hymn (v. 83), we shall see on the contrary a rather striking similarity with that employed to describe Indra. Parjanya is jircddtnus, an expression applied to the work of the atmospheric Maruts (i. 165. 15); to the "rain of the sky " (ix. 97. 17); to Mitra and Varuna (v. 62. 3), in their capacity of heavenly rain-gods (frequently alluded to), and to Indra (viii. 51=62. 3). Then Parjanya is " a bellowing bull that puts his seed in the plants," an idea which is expressed with almost the same words in regard to Agni (i. 128. 3; x. 1. 2); to Soma (ix. 76. 5; ix. 5. 1, etc.); and to Indra, first in respect of the noise (i. 100. 13; 173. 3-4), then in respect of the bull (vi. 44, 21, and frequentlv), and finally in respect of the plants (ii. 13. 7). The 'crash' of Indra's descent is noticed in viii. 1. 2. He and Parjanya alone have the epithet mahM- vadha; he shares with Parjaliya the ' thunder ' expressed by standyan (vi. 44. 12; for the image here compare viii. 21. 18), and exactly as Parjanya here thunders and all quakes, so Indra thunders and all quakes (i. 80. 14; ii. 12. 1). He like Parjanya has a whip, kdVa, as have also the rain-giving Aqvins and Maruts (viii. 33. 11; i. 22. 3; 37. 3 ; 157. 4; 168. 4); his regular epithet is rathes(hc, just as Parjanya in this hymn is rathi?va. Parjanya smites demons. Indra smites or ' burns' them (with lightning). The distinction is significant.t The rain-pouring, both in the Parjanya hymn and in the hymns to Indra and the Maruts, is the business of the Maruts themselves,? * It is scarcely necessary to state that the citations given are illustrative only. They might be increased to any extent. But the collective view is the one here represented. f The snake is surely not a river-snake. This water-holder " stops the sky and water," RV. ii. 11. 5. Where the snake is located are the waters, the streams, which Indra lets out of the sky; though this also affects the rivers: i. 57. 6; ii.I1. 7: 1 2. 3. f iii. 30. 16 (with the thunderbolt). Compare vi. 18. 10: "Burn like fire (compare x. 87. 5) the dry wood with thy weapon; the demons also, like a thun- derbolt." ? The Maruts "send rain " (v. 55. 5; 58. 3, etc.); Mitra-Varuna send it (v. 62. 3, etc.); but clhiefly Soma sends it (ix. 39. 2, etc.). Even Varuna sends rain (v. 85); while Agni does so too (vi. 13. 1; ii. 6. 5). VOL. XVI. U</page><page sequence="36">ccxxxviii American Oriental Society's Proceedings, April 1895. 'whose sweat is rain.' They alone are varsdnirnijas. In prayer, Indra- Brhaspati is clearly besought for rain, in x. 98. 4-9; and he himself says " I gave rain to mortals " (iv. 26. 2-3), adding that he led the waters, as if the swelling of the river-water were the result of the rain, as it is. In ii. 27. 14-15, "This one" also is Indra, apparently. The form of Indra's appearance is as a rain (x. 23. 4; compare viii. 12. 6). Naturally, with the Maruts to pour the rain for him,* Indra's reputa- tion, not being that of a mere Parjanya, rests more on his heroic act as a battle-leader; so that in the Rik there is perhaps all that could be expected of the rain-god. Yet in x. 98. 4 Indra sends rain (as Brhaspati). As for the letting out of the rivers, since the rivers are let out only when the storm bursts, it is clearly fair to attribute the act to Indra, who brings the storm which bursts the river. And Oldenberg has neglected to mention that in the praise of rivers it is Varuna alone and not Indra who in x. 75. 2 is praised for letting out the whole band of rivers.t I utterly fail to see how it can be said of a god who 'sends rain,' who is full of ' drops,' who ' thunders day by day,'t who ' crashes down,' who is armed like Parjanya (mah4vadha), or more particularly, has the 'sharp gleaming' weapon 'of the sky' (lightning), peculiar to Agni and the Maruts (didyitt), or to Dyaus (aVdni),? who has the 'rain- bejewelled Maruts' as his constant companions, and like Parjanya makes all things grow,jj that " for the Vedic poets Indra's victory is not that of a tempest; but represents the breaking of the river-founts from the depths of the mountain." Oldenberg says that the rarity of such expressions prevents one from laying much weight upon them, and is inclined to attribute these characteristics anyway to the Vedic exag- geration which paints a god's form in uncanonical ways.? To me it seems as if this explanation were not sufficient. And there is a further difficulty. According to Oldenberg, Indra's prototype is a gewittergott. This storm-god then " for the Vedic poets " becomes a mountain-giant. He then suffers a reversion, and in his third stage becomes a gewitter- gott again (post-Rik).** Did the great Ram ever skip like this? I trow not. The true explanation of Indra's unbounded greatness I have given, I think, in my Religions of India. He passes beyond the atmospheric storm-god, he becomes too great to be specifically described, he approaches the universality of Agni the three-fold. Hence his material attributes are sunk under vague grandiloquence.

Still back of this may lie the dragon-slayer of earth; but when the Rig-Veda permits us to see the form of his veiled god (" clothed in cloud") he shows us not an Old Man of the Moun- tains, but a god that rides upon the storm, whose weapon is the ' gleaming' boltt sent down from the sky; whose rain is a source of fruitfulness and thankfulness, who in his storming gives at once an ideal of warriorship and a promise of rich gain: ydt pu4spitniV ca pras- vd9 ca dhcirmranadhi d4ne vy divditir ddharayah : yad casama dJano didyAito divd uritr irv&amp;4 abhitah sasy ukthya1.4 12. Theories of Sacrifice as applied to the Rig,-Veda; by Pro- fessor Hopkins. This paper took up the different theories of sacrifice in the Rig-Veda and pointed out that to understand the sacrifice as portrayed in this work one must abide by the general tone and not by sporadic examples found in contradiction to that tone. The Vedic poet's view of expia- tion of sin, the object of his sacrifice, and his relations with his gods were reviewed. Smith's theory of consanguinity is not found repre- sented in Vedic hymns. Neither is the view that the gods are to be caught or to be duped by magical medicinal power one that can be re- ferred to the Hymns except in a few cases, which by their infrequency show a marked contrast with the prevailing view. Desire and hope and shrewd hospitality, to make the gods grant these hopeful desires, are the foundation of the Vedic sacrifice. The hospitable gifts, how- ever, must be sufficient to insure reward. No one knows precisely how much the gods want. Therefore the poet thinks, lack of luck showing lack of favor, that when the worshipper is urnfortunate it is a sign that the god is angry; from which anger with its consequences he begs to be released, not knowing how or when he has sinned. But he argues logically that he must have done so. This is the second class of sins for which sacrifice must be made. The first class consists of sins that the * " When the [i. e. thy] sharp thunderbolt falls ... when battle rages, then be our savior" (iv. 16. 17). The thunderbolt (a?.Ini, the bolt which strikes a tree, ii. 14. 2) is Indra's, as in i. 54. 4, where Indra shakes " Iiigh heaven " and fights with the ap6ani; cf. i. 80. 13, vii. 104. 20.

But there is no case in the Vedic hymns of an Aryan admitting that he has committed a specific first-class sin. It is always his foes who sin thus. He himself makes sacrifice to atone for what he thinks he must have done, not for what he admits he has done. Examples were given to illustrate the paper, which was intended for the general public of the Society and contained no special study, except negatively, to show that ' capturing' a god, and 'big medicine' sacri- fice must each be regarded not as the Rig-Vedic idea of sacrifice, but as an idea which sporadically appears in the Rig-Veda. 13. On the legend of Indra's visit to Medltithi, Saiyana on RV. i. 51. 1; by Dr. Hanns Oertel, of Yale Uiliversity, New Haven, Conn. The subrahnianyd-chant wlhich the subrahmanyd-priest sings while the soina is conveyed on the soma-cart to the sacrificial enclosure is interesting because it contains allusions to a number of Indra-myths about which little is known from other sources. In it Indra is invoked (1) as Medhdtither mesa ' ram of Medhdtithi '; (2) as Vrsana9vasya Mene 'Mena (wife?) of Vrsanaava'; (3) as Ahdlytydi jara 'paramour of Abalyd'; and (4) as Kduqika brdhmnana Gdutama bruvdna. I propose to say a few words with regard to the first allusion. Sqyana in his commentary on the Rig Veda mentions three times the legend of Indra's visit to Medhdtithi in the form of a ram. Twice (i. 51. 1 and viii. 2. 40) he quotes from the SB. (i. 1.); medhdtithi&amp;m hi kdnvdyanim nmeso bhittvd "jahtra ' for he (Indra) having become a ram, carried off AIedhdtithi the descendant of Kanv.la.'* Once he states prac- tically the same in his own words (viii. 97. 12): indro meso bhiitvd medh&amp;tithirh svargam anayat, 'Indra, having become a ram, led Medha- tithi to heaven.' The mythological side of this legend has been discussed by A. Weber fInd. Stud. ix. 38-40), who conjectures that it arose from a misreading of RV. viii. 2. 40 (meso bhfito 'bhi yan naya4 for yann ayah of the saihhitd) possibly under the influence of the Greek Ganymede-legend. Without entering into this question I pass on to the other statement which Sayana makes in connection with it (on RV. i. 51. 1): Kanvapu- tram medhdtithirh yajanmdnam indro mnesarftpead "gatya tadiya*h somaih papdu. sa rsis tarn mesa ity avocat. ata iddnir api mesa iti 'ndro 'bhidhiyate, for which he qulotes the subrahmanyd-formula. Weber notes here, "This also is clearly only a misunderstanding of the figurative text (viii. 2. 40). For in reality the verse does not contain anything except the request that Indra may come to Medhatithi as a ram, i. e. with rich gifts." Here, too, I refrain from discussing the mythological aspect and the possible origin of this version. All I pro- pose to do is to show that this last passage does not at all originate with Sayana, but (1) that he repeats here a form of the legend current at the * Cf.

The King of Siam's edition of the Buddhist Scriptures ; by Professor C. R. Lanman, of Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. It is perhaps not generally known to the present members of the Society that His Majesty, Pawarendr Ramesr, Second Kinig of Siam, was an Honorary Member of the American Oriental Society. A letter from him, acknowledging and returning thanks for his election, was presented in October, 1865 (see Proceedings for that date, Journal, vol. viii., p. lxxxi), and contains the following passage: " It is gratify- irng to learn, through your Society's published works, of the interest taken in the United States in Oriental learning. Allow me to hope that this interest, as well as the benefit derived from such studies, may continue to increase and result in much good." One of the greatest benefactors of the Society, the Hon. Charles W. Bradley, of New Haven, was deeply interested in Siam. " In 1857, he returned home as bearer of the new treaty with Siam, and, on his outward passage to Ningpo, he took with him its ratification, being invested for the pur- pose with plenipotentiary powers " (Proceedings for May, 1865, Journal,. vol. viii., p. lxi). In his paper On the Kings and the Kingdom of Siam (Proceedings for May, 1859, p. 7, not in the Journal), Mr. Bradley speaks " of the First and Second Kings, their character, their uncom- mon attainments in European languages anid science, their knowledge of and interest in all that takes place in the political and intellectual world' of the West, and their especially friendly feeling toward America and Americans." In this connection, attention may be called to the very interesting work of Mrs. A. H. Leonowens, The English Governess at the Siamese Court. Mr. Lanman laid before the Society one volume of the King of Siam's edition of the Tipitaka, in 39 volumes, which had already been mentioned by the Librarian. The books are printed books, and are in the Pali language and in the Siamese alphabet. Affixed to the fly-leaf of the first volume is the following circular letter: CONSULATE-GENERAL OF SIAM, NEW YORK, March 20, 1895. SIR: I have forwarded to the address of your Institution, a Siamese edi- tion of the sacred writings of the Southern Buddhists, the Tripitaka, sent as a present by His Majesty, Somdetch Phra Paramindr Maha Chulalonkorn Phra Chula Chom Klao, King of Siam, in commemora- tion of the 25th anniversary of his reign. It may be interesting to His Majesty to receive somne account of your Institution, showing what has been accomplished in your quarter of the " New World" in the cause of letters and education during the last twenty-five years. Will you therefore have the kindness to send a copy of your last Report by mail to His Royal Highness, Prince Devawongse Varaprakar, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bangkok, Siam, and one copy, if you please, to me. Will you also acknowledge receipt of the books to His Royal High- ness, and send a duplicate receipt to me.

[Total, 49.] These volumes of the Tipitaka have no duplicate title-pages in Eng- lish; and, in the absence of experts at many or most of the above-men- tioned libraries, it is probable that the books will fail to be properly catalogued and will thus also fail to attract possible students and to be made known to those already interested. Accordingly, for the practi-</page><page sequence="44">ccxlvi American Oriental Society's Proceedings, April 1895. cal purpose of increasing the chances of usefulness of the widely dis- tributed Siamese edition the following lists are given. The Harvard copy of this work has already been of great use to Mr. Henry C. Warren of Cambridge, in the prosecution of his studies in Buddhism. He drew up a numbered list of the 39 volumes and wrote out in briefest form the contents of each volume. A similar service for the Library of the University of Edinburgh was rendered by Dr. James Burgess. Each of the volumes has a Kittarna-patta or ' Table of Con- tents.' These it may be quite desirable to print in our Journal in extenso for the use of Piali students; giving, for instance, tlhe 152 suttas of the Majjhima-nikaya. For the present purpose, however, I have disre- garded systematic completeness, and even consistency, and have given in general only so much as is desirable for the identification of the con- tents of the several volumes. But for the Mahd-niddesa, the Culla-nid- desa, and the Patisambhida-magga, I have given the tables in full. It will be seen, as Mr. Warren observes, that the Vimana-vatthu, Peta- vatthu, Thera-gatha, Theri-gatha, Jataka, Apadana, Buddhavamhsa, and Cariyd-pitaka, given by Childers in his Dictionary as belonging to the Khuddaka-nikaya and so forming part of the canon, are not included in the Siamese edition. Reprints of this paper will be sent, first, to all the above-mentioned libraries. The cataloguers will thereby be enabled easily to identify or cause to be identified all the 39 volumes of the set; to note the contents of each volume on its fly-leaf; and thus to catalogue the work properly and make it accessible to studeiits. Mr. H. C. Warren authorizes me to say that he is willing to identify each of the volumes of the set for any Library that will send the books to his address (12 Quincy st., Cam- bridge, Mass.). The Library concerned must pay the carriage both ways; but there will be no other expense. Secondly, reprints of this paper will be sent, so long as the supply lasts, to any Pali students who may ask for them. (Apply to C. R. L., 9 Farrar st., Cambridge, Mass.) They will thus be enabled to find out where copies of the Tipitaka may be consulted or borrowed. I.

The Iharvard copy of the first Sanskrit book ever printed; by Professor Lanman. Mr. Lanman laid before the Society a book, given-together with many other valuable and valued proofs of his loyalty and affection-by Dr. Fitzedward Hall, of the Class of 1846, to the Library of Harvard, his Alma Mater. The volume is one of most noteworthy character and his- tory. It is a copy of the first Sanskrit book ever printed. The title reads: ' The Seasons: A Descriptive Poem, by Calidas, in the original Sanscrit. Calcutta: M.nDCC.XCIL.' And the "Advertisement" of twenty lines on page three begins with the words, "This book is the first ever printed in Sanscrit. " Neither here nor on the title-page is there any mention of the editor's name; but we know his name from the fact that the " I Advertisement is reprinted (vol. xiii., p. 386, 8vo ed. of London, 1807) as a part of" The Works of Sir William Jones." The book is an octavo of 4 + 64 pages, printed in Bengali letters, on admirable paper of J. Whatman, with broad margins. As early as 1840, Von Bohlen, in his edition of the 'Seasons,' says of Jones's edition: 1, * * ,et primum omnino, id quod memoratu dignum est, opusculum fuit Sanskritum prelo subjectum. Europam vero hoc incunabulum, quod vel in ipsa India jain dudum prorsus evanuit, vix vidit; et ubi forte, veluti in Chambersiana codicum collectione [in the Royal Library at Berlin], invenitur, codicis manuscripti instar aestimandum est.' There follows Jones's "preface" entire. And Gildemeister, in his 'Bibliotheca3 Sanskritee Specimen' (Bonn, 1847, p. 70), says: "ILiber sanscritus omnium qui typis exscripti sunt primus isque rarissimus." But this is not all. The title-page bears the name " Chas. Wilkins," presumably in his autograph. Now, in the ninth volume of the Jour- VOL XVI. V</page><page sequence="52">ccliv American Oriental Society's Proceedings, April 1895. nal of the American Oriental Society, p. lxxxviii (October, 1870), are extracts from " thirteen inedited letters from Sir William Jones to Mr. (afterwards Sir) Charles Wilkins," communicated by Prof. Fitzedward Hall, D.C.L. And in the tenth volume, pages 110-117, are given these letters in full. Several extracts may follow: "You are the first Euro - pean that ever understood Sanscrit, and will, possibly, be the last" (October 6, 1787). "The ships of this season will carry home seven hundred copies of our first volume of Transactions; . . . but unless the impression should be sold in London, Harington and Morris (who print the book at their hazard) will be losers, and we must dissolve the Society [The Asiatic Society of Bengal !]" (February 27, 1789). " I am so busy at this season, that I have only time to request your acceptance of a little Sanscrit poem, which Morris has printed [i. e. presumably Harington and Morris], and which you are the only man in Europe who can read and understand" (January 14, 1793). As is evident from the date of the last extract, the " little poem " can be no other than the 'Seasons' of "CMlidas." The extract itself is a copy of the very words of the editor that were sent with the poem. And the volume itself, without doubt, is no other than the identical copy given by Sir William Jones to Sir Charles Wilkins. Illustrious owners! Homer tells of "the handing-down of the sceptre" (of Aga- memnon). Here is a book whose handing-down ought to have for ,Oriental students no less interest than the story of the sceptre had for Thucydides. Dr. Hall's gift deserves to be held in honor. 18.
