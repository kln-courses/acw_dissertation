<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOTANICAL MUSEUM LEAFLETS HARVARD UNIVERSITY Cambridge, Massachusetts, July 31, 1974 Vol. 24, No. 1 ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE FOR SNUFFING IN PREHISPAN1C MEXICO BY Peter T. Fürst The various hallucinogenic or psychoactive plants the extensive religious and divinatory use of which by Mexi- can Indians both fascinated and appalled the Spanish colonial clergy of the sixteenth and seventeenth centu- ries were smoked, chewed, sucked, brewed or macerated into beverages and otherwise ingested in liquid, solid or incinerated form. Tobacco, most commonly smoked, was also ground into a fine green powder that was not taken internally but was rather applied externally to the patient's body in shamanistic curing practices. All these customary uses of "mind-altering" sub- stances are well described for both prehispanic and post- Conquest Mexico by such writers as Sahagún, Duran, Hernández and, somewhat later, Jacinto de la Serna and Ruiz de Alarcon. In contrast, there is no mention what- ever of hallucinogenic snuffs, taken through tubes or through "nose pipes", a common practice in the West Indies and in Central and South America. Since these and other chroniclers of indigenous practices and beliefs were usually careful observers, and since the Church was engaged in a vigorous - albeit ultimately unsuccessful - campaign to discover and suppress the indigenous use of intoxicants of all forms, we must assume that, trade and [1]</page><page sequence="2">other contacts with Caribbean and Central American snuff-using cultures notwithstanding, the Indians of Late Post-Classic Mexico seem not to have assimilated these practices into their own extensive complex of ritual intoxicants. Nevertheless, there is a growing corpus of data, in the form of archaeological art, to suggest that snuffing was once known and practiced in several parts of Meso- america as early as 1500-1200 B.C. and at least as late as the first centuries A.D. Before we examine some of the evidence, we need briefly to consider the problem of potential indigenous Mexican sources for hallucinogenic snuffs. Thanks to prodigious research in the field, the labora- tory and the historical sources, especially by such inves- tigators as Richard Evans Schultes, S. Henry Wassén, Siri von Reis Altschul, and Bo Holmstedt, the various kinds of South American snuffs are botanically and chemically rather well understood. For Mexico, how- ever, the botanical data are inadequate, and chemical in- formation is wholly or largely lacking. Nevertheless, there are indications of the direction that future research might fruitfully take. First, one cannot rule out one or more species of Nico- tiana. These native tobaccos have a much greater nicotine content than do the hybrid species from which cigarette or pipe tobaccos are made. Wilbert (197*2: 55-73) re- cently documented the use of tobacco as the sole psycho- tomimetic employed by the shamans of the Warao In- dians of Venezuela, who smoke themselves into ecstatic trance states that are phenomenologically indistinguish- able from those elsewhere triggered with such botanical hallucinogens as ayahuasca, the sacred mushrooms, morning-glory seeds, or Anadenanthera and Virola snuffs. Several species of Nicotiana are in fact employed [2]</page><page sequence="3">for psychotomimetic snuff in South America, either alone or in combination with other psychoactive plants. The shamans of some indigenous cultures - e.g., the Tacana of Bolivia - use pulverized tobacco as a magical repellent against hostile demons (Hissink and Hahn, 1961). Furthermore, it is not impossible that the use of tobacco powder as a magical external medicine by Mexi- can curanderos had its ultimate origin in an earlier use of powdered tobacco as snuff. Secondly, there appears to be no reason why some of the better known Mesoamerican plant hallucinogens should not be as psychotomimetically effective when taken as snuff through the nasal membranes as when as- similated through the stomach. By way of illustration, I am informed by Dr. Schultes that, in South America, the bark of Banisteriopsis Caapi, which is usually macer- ated or brewed into the potent hallucinogenic beverage known by such names as yajé, ayahuasca, etc., is re- putedly sometimes pulverized and inhaled as snuff. Even Ilex Guayusa, a caffeine-rich holly widely utilized as a stimulating tea, along with its sister species, e.g. maté, Ilex paraguariensis), has served as snuff, at least in pre- hispanic highland Bolivia, where Ilex snuff and snuffing paraphernalia were recently discovered in a Tihuanacoid shaman's grave, dated ca. A.D. 500. The shaman's kit also included clysters, suggesting that the same plant might even have been employed for stimulating enemas (Schultes, 1972b). Whether or not peyote ( Lophophora Williamsii), olo- liuhqui ( Bivea corymbosa) or other hallucinogens native to Mesoamerica were ever used in the form of snuff, there exist extensive Mexican populations of shrubs and trees of the Leguminosae that should be investigated for possible psychoactive properties. Included are two Mexi- can species of Piptadenia, a genus closely related to the [3]</page><page sequence="4">psychoactive genus Anadenanthera of South America, which may well possess the same or similar psychotomi- metic constituents. Two of these Mexican species are Piptadenia flava, found also in Central America and Co- lombia, and Piptadenia constricta. Both are found along the Pacific coast, from Sinaloa and Jalisco in the north to Guerrero in the south. To my knowledge, neither have been tested for hallucinogenic alkaloids. There are in addition more than sixty species each of the allied genera Mimosa and Acacia in Mexico, and some of these may, like certain South American species, contain psy- choactive principles. This might be found to apply es- pecially to those species credited with sacred, magical, or ''dangerous" qualities by local Indians or rural mez- tizos and should be chemically studied from the point of view of possible hallucinogenic alkaloids. Finally, there appear two other possible candidates as potential sources of hallucinogenic snuff in southeastern Mexico, both with significant South American ties. These are species of Psychotria and Justicia. The former is a well known additive in hallucinogenic potions pre- pared basically from the Banisteriopsis Caapi vine in Ecuador, Colombia, Peru and Brazil, while the latter is added to Virola snuff or is said even to be employed alone as a source of psychotomimetic snuff (Schultes, 1972a: 45-46, 52). These possibilities emerge from a comment by Wassén (1972: 37-38) on a suggestion of mine (1968: 160-164) that snuffing might have been practiced by the Gulf Coast Olmec. In support of this comment, W assén cites the following excerpt from a let- ter to him by Schultes, dated February, 1969 : We are finding so many plants with tryptamines - the active principle of many of the snuffs of South America - that it is very possible that in the Mexican Gulf Coast area the Indians could have found a plant which, prepared in the form of a snuff, could intoxicate as does the snuff of the Waikas. One of these is Psy- [4]</page><page sequence="5">chotria , a species of which in South America has now been found to have N,N-dimethyltryptamine. Psychotria occurs up as far as Vera Cruz and it is possible that other species have this principle. Furthermore, Holmstedt be- lieves that he has found this same chemical in our species of Justicia which is added to Virola snuff by the Waikas. Other species of Justicia occur as far north as Vera Cruz and may pos- sibly also have this chemical constituent. While the botanical sources for hallucinogenic snuff in Mesoamerica must, for the present, remain conjectur- al, the evidence for snuffing in archaeological art is, as we shall see, beyond question. Moreover, on the earliest level of the proposed Mesoamerican snuffing complex - that is, the Early to Middle Formative - the evidence points persuasively southward, at least to Central Ameri- ca, if not actually to northwestern South America. We owe much of our knowledge of Central and South American snuffing paraphernalia - prehistoric as well as recent - to Wassén's several studies, and I would here like to acknowledge my own debt to our Swedish col- league in this area of research. It was a paper by Was- sén, published in 1967, that first set me on the track of a possible snuffing complex in Mexico. Specifically, my attention was drawn to the so called Brazilian litos, small effigy stone carvings, usually bird-like, with carved, shal- low, oval or circular depressions that made them appear like receptacles. A number of these were found in the last century in the shell middens of Santa Catarina, Brazil. Wassén thought it likely that these bird-effigy litos might have served as tablets for hallucinogenic snuff, rather like the archaeological wooden snuff tablets found in the Chilean and Peruvian desert, or more re- cent snuff tablets from Amazonia. Subsequently, I raised the question of the use of hal- lucinogens by the Olmec, suggesting that the well known jade artifacts called "spoons", might, like the Brazilian [5]</page><page sequence="6">litos, have served as snuff tablets (Fürst, 1968: 162). At least some of the Olmec "spoons" seemed to represent long-tailed birds in flight, seen in profile. In any event, like some South American snuff tablets, certain Olmec jade spoons are decorated with bird-jaguar motifs, a com- mon symbolic theme in South American ritual intoxi- cation. At the time, this was still highly speculative. No direct evidence existed to show that the Olmec had used snuff or other hallucinogens ; for that matter, there was no proof that the ritual use of psychoactive substances in Mesoamerica was any older than the oldest of the so- called mushroom stones, i.e., from the end of the Mid- dle to the Late Formative. All that could be said was that it would be surprising if the Olmec had used no hallucinogens, considering what was already known of the antiquity and wide distribution of the hallucinogenic phenomenon in the New World. To mention only snuff- ing: the earliest known archaeological snuffing imple- ments are a whalebone tablet and associated birdbone snuffing tube which Junius Bird of the American Mu- seum of Natural History excavated at Huaca Prieta, Peru. These are dated at ca. 1500-1700 B.C. The evi- dence was thus conclusive for a time depth of some 3,500 years for the use of hallucinogenic snuffs in South America. The first evidence that snuffing was in fact known at one time also in Mesoamerica came to my attention in the form of a hollow, redware effigy figurine from Co- lima, representing a seated man with a horn on his head and a small, gourd-shaped nose pipe held to one nostril (Plate I). Subsequently, I was to come across a second, considerably larger, Colima effigy (Plate II), of burnished brown clay, sculpturally far more sophisticated, again depicting a man in the act of snuffing from a gourd- [6]</page><page sequence="7">Plate I Small, hollow terracotta effigy of seated man, holding a gourd- shaped snuffing pipe to his nose.

Both of these figurines belong to the larger West Mexican shaft-and-chamber tomb art com- plex and can, therefore, be dated between 100 B.C. and A.D. 100-200. In addition to the effigies, we were able to identify, in several collections, a number of pottery snuffers or nose pipes from West Mexico that closely resemble the well known Costa Rican snuffing pipes illustrated by Wassén in several publications. Especially interesting is a red-slipped snuffer with bifurcated stems, one for each nostril, from the Ixtlán del Rio area of southern Nay arit (Plate III). The Ixtlán snuffer is actually a convention- alized bird effigy, with nubs at the side of the bowl to indicate wings, and a projection at the front for the head or beak. Such abbreviated bird symbolism is common on Costa Rican pottery snuffers as well. That this is hardly fortuitous was recognized by Wassén: birds and bird spirits are widely connected with the ecstatic trance ex- perience and with shamanism. For a time, these West Mexican specimens seemed to be all that there was. Snuffing, therefore, appeared to be an isolated phenomenon in time and space, associated with the shaft-and-chamber tomb cultures of the West Coast. Their funerary art indicates that these same cultures also employed the peyote cactus and, possibly, mushrooms. The close similarity of the West Coast pottery snuffers to those of Central America, and their restricted distri- bution close to the Pacific coast, suggested a somewhat short-lived trait, introduced possibly from a southerly source, that eventually failed to take hold alongside es- tablished cults involving such well known indigenous Mexican hallucinogens as peyote and the sacred mush- rooms. However, West Coast snuffing was not to remain the isolated and short-lived phenomenon that it appeared at [10]</page><page sequence="10">Pí, ATE III Bifurcated bird effigy snuffer from Ixtlán del Rio, Nay arit, shaft- and-chamber tomb phase, ca. 100 B.C. -A.D. 200-300.

New evidence has come to light in the form of effigy and undecorated snuffing pipes from the Early to Middle Formative, from Xochipala, Guerrero. The dating of Xochipala is still somewhat uncertain: there have been suggestions that it represents the very "origin" of Olmec art, predating the San Lorenzo Phase in Veracruz (Gay 1972). However, the reported and confirmed associations of the extraordinarily sophisticated and sometimes as- tonishingly naturalistic figurines from Xochipala with typically Olmec incised bowls and other Olmec artifacts characteristic of the Late Early to Early Middle Forma- tive, including "spoons" and beads of blue-green trans- lucent jade, suggests dates equivalent to San Lorenzo and contemporaneous sites in Morelos and elsewhere in Central Mexico - i.e., between 1300 and 1000 B.C. On the other hand, a recent series of thermoluminescence tests tend to support an earlier date at least for the be- ginning of realistic Xochipala art, possibly as early as 1500-1600 B.C. (Robert Stroessner, pers. comm.). The uncontrolled looting of Xochipala, with its re- markable assemblage of some of the finest Formative ceramic figurines to be found anywhere in the New World, is a scientific tragedy of major proportions. We can only guess at the evidence that has forever been lost ; nevertheless, it has been possible to study and verify the authenticity of a number of Xochipala pieces now in private hands or museum collections (interestingly enough, although the accidental discovery of the Xochi- pala site by local farmers dates from the mid-nineteen sixties, a typical Xochipala figurine has been in the ex- tensive pre-Columbian collection of the Peabody Mu- seum of Harvard University for more than seventy years). Among recently discovered Xochipala artifacts are several unmistakable snuffing instruments or "nose pipes", dating far earlier than those of the West Coast [12]</page><page sequence="12">Plate IV Terracotta bowl snuffer, Xochipala, Guerrero, Early Formative, ca. 1500-1200 B.C.

The first of these to be examined and identified as a nose pipe was a small, round, undecorated bowl with a horizontal perforated stem (Plate IV). If one compares this pottery snuffer with examples from Central America, it is clear that, except for its characteristic local paste and the lime encrustation typical of ceramics from the Xochipala burials, the little Mexican snuffing pipe is virtually identical to similar instruments from Guana- caste or Linea Vieja, Costa Rica (Wassén, 1965: 25). As in the case of the Nayarit snuffer, it is difficult not to postulate a genetic connection between them, al- though the known Central American pottery snuffers, and also that from Nayarit, are appreciably later than this Early Formative pipe. A second Xochipala nose pipe which I was able to study in detail is much more complex (Plate V). It is an effigy pipe, measuring 4f" in length, representing a human figure on its back, with knees drawn up - a posi- tion somewhat resembling the post-Classic "Chacmool" stone sculptures. On the basis of the wrap-around loin- cloth, the figure can be identified as male. In a recent museum catalogue, the piece was erroneously described as an effigy bowl in the form of a kneeling person (Gay 1972). But that would place the nosepiece at the top and the bowl opening facing vertically toward the front, which seems hardly likely. Once the piece is recognized for what it is - a nose pipe used for snuffing - the location and inclination of the nosepiece alone dictate a supine position for the figurine, as does the opening of the bowl itself. Indeed, in handling the piece, its real purpose suggests itself almost spontaneously. While it is certainly the finest example known to me, [14]</page><page sequence="14">Plate V co « O bu . i CO e 0/ § o 0/ o « 2 ^ I ó I a o 4J »O (A i- i O C ed •o C ed S.

Several similar nose pipes have come to light, including one (Plate VI) of a man with animal characteristics lying on his stomach, with the bowl in the back and a horn-like nosepiece on top of the head. Here again the sex of the effigy is male ; indeed, there are indications of a phallus on the underside. On the basis of the evidence, then, we can postulate a snuffing complex of appreciable duration and antiquity along the west coast of Mexico, with the earliest evi- dence dating to 1500-1200 B.C., and the latest approxi- mately to the beginning of the Christian era. A recent re-examination of early pottery artifacts from Oaxaca as well as from Central Mexico shows, however, that divine inebriation with psychotropic snuff was not limited to the Guerrero Formative or the shaft -and- chamber tomb phase of coastal northwestern Meso- america. 1 have only just begun checking through col- lections and the literature on Monte Alban ceramics, but already it appears that the evidence for snuffing from the Late Formative at least into the Early Classic is sub- stantial. Thus far, we have been able to identify more than a dozen spouted "miniature effigy vessels", includ- ing a group in the Museo Frissell de Arte Zapoteca in Mitla, Oaxaca, as probable nose pipes, dating from Monte Alban I and II. Some of these appear very similar in construction, if not in style and paste, to those from Xochipala. In addition, I have located at least one probable Early to Middle Formative animal effigy nose pipe, in the form of a turtle, from Tlatilco, in the col- lections of the Museum of Ethnology in Vienna, Austria. This relates stylistically to black effigy ceramics of Olmec derivation or origin from Tlatilco and Las Bocas, Puebla. One interesting little polished black snuffing pipe, possibly transitional from Monte Alban I to II (i.e. ca.

[17]</page><page sequence="17">200 B.C.), appears to symbolize transformation, in this instance from human into a duck-like bird with rounded body and flipper-like feet (Plate VII). The frontal half is human, with hands held palms together to the chin ; the rest of the body is that of a duck. A conical per- forated horn on the head forms the nosepiece, as in some of the effigy pipes from Xochipala. Space limitations preclude detailed discussion of duck symbolism, but it should be noted that chimereal or anthropomorphic ducks are not uncommon in prehis- panic art, especially on the west coast. Ducks are present also in the art of Tlatilco and other Early to Middle Formative sites. A study of Pueblo duck mythology and beliefs about the duck as supernatural among the Cora and Huichol of West Mexico may throw some light on the problem ; a Duck Person is a prominent figure in Huichol origin myths, as it is also among the Zuni and other Southwestern Indians; ducks seem to be messen- gers of the gods or else a form that the gods assume when they travel. Also, ducks are associated with shamanism, perhaps because, as wide-ranging water birds, they ap- pear to inhabit several planes at once. Of even greater interest is a Monte Alban effigy snuff- ing pipe of grey clay, representing a deer resting on its stomach, with legs drawn up and head turned to the right (Plate VIII). Cloven hooves leave no doubt about the zoological identification. What makes this piece especially fascinating is that it holds an unmistakable peyote cactus in its mouth (I am greatly indebted to Miss Julie Jones of the Museum of Primitive Art, who recognized the significance of the deer-peyote asso- ciation here in relation to the Huichol conceptualization of peyote as deer, and vice versa, and who, on that ac- count, drew my attention to the artifact). While anthromorphic pipes from Oaxaca and Xochi- [18]</page><page sequence="18">Plate VII Black-slipped, burnished terracotta effigy snuffer in the form of a duck-bodied man, from Monte Alban, Oaxaca, Late Formative, Monte Alban IA-II (?), ca. 300-100 B.C.

A number of similar snuffers combining head and animal characteris- tics, with the nose piece either in the tail or forming a horn on the head, are in the Museo del Arte Zapoteca, Mitla, Oaxaca. [19]</page><page sequence="19">pala have the nosepiece in the form of a horn on the head, it is the tail that forms the nosepiece in the deer effigy snuffer from Oaxaca. Such choices on the part of the prehistoric pipe makers cannot be considered to be arbi- trary. If one may venture some guesses, the horn atop the head as nosepiece may relate to the well known and widespread concept of horns - both single and double - as a symbol and even a source of shamanic or supernatu- ral power (Fürst 1965). Single horns on the forehead are a characteristic especially of a certain class of Colima figu- rines, but they also occur elsewhere in Mesoamerica(e.g. at Tlatilco, Tlapacoya, Chalcatzingo, Xochipala, Monte Alban, etc.) and even in Peru, especially in Nazca art. As for the nosepiece of the deer effigy pipe, this might have to do with the concept of the deertail as magical power object in some North American shamantic prac- tices and beliefs. Among the Huichol, for example, the deertail is an important element in the shaman's equip- ment, as it is in Papago shamanism. Likewise, it is hardly insignificant that the name of one of the principal Huichol supernaturais is Tamátsi Máxa Kwascí, Elder Brother Deer Tail. The association of deer, divine inebriant and shaman which we perceive archaeologically in the Monte Alban snuffing pipe and ethnographically in Huichol and Cora religion, is itself an important culture-historical problem that remains to be seriously explored. Andean art dating to the fifth or sixth century A.D. suggests that there was something very like these Mesoamerican associations also in Peru. A common theme on Moche IV painted ceramics is a ritual deer hunt, in which the hunter is clearly not meant to be an ordinary man but a god, cul- ture hero, or great shaman (Plate IX). Moche painters consistently depict the deer in association with a shrub or tree which, though to some degree conventionalized, [20]</page><page sequence="20">Plate VLIL Effigy snuffing pipe of burnished grey clay in the form of a deer holding a peyote cactus in his mouth, from Monte Alban, Oaxaca, Late Formative, Monte Albán I- 1 1, ca. 300-100 B.C.

[21]</page><page sequence="21">is identifiable botanically as Anadenanthera colubrina, with the long, bean-like seed pods characteristic of the hallucinogenically rich family Leguminosae. The seeds of this tree, called vilca or willka in the Andes, are made into a potent psychotomimetic snuff; they are also in- gested in a beverage and, in some highland Quechua villages, play an important role in the making of llampu, a sacred substance used in cattle increase ceremonies and other rituals the origins of which lie far back in Andean prehistory (Billie Jean Isbell, personal communication). In any event, the deer is often a semi-divine celestial animal for American Indians, connected with Sun, Fire, sky beings, and shamans. Among the Warao of the Orinoco Delta, its flesh is still strictly taboo for shamans, suggesting at least a former sacred relationship (Johannes Wilbert, personal communication). Among the Huichol, it is the shaman's spirit helper and companion : a pair of feathered ceremonial arrows that he wears on his head in certain ritual contexts symbolize deer antlers; the oblong basket of shamanic power objects ( takwátsi ) is identified with the divine Deer Person, Kávyumarie; certain deities are deer and vice versa ; the deer is mount, guardian and guide on the shaman's celestial quests and flights, especially on the peyote hunt; the "Principal Deer", Elder Brother Wawatsári, is peyote, and vice versa, etc. Such concepts remind one at once of the role of the deer in Paleo- Asiatic or Siberian shamanism. In Siberia, too, the deer is the celestial mount that carries the sha- man to the Upperworld and its spirit rulers. In parts of Siberia, moreover, there is direct association between deer - in this case the reindeer - and the divine inebriant used by shamans to attain the ecstatic trance states in which they embark on their supernatural journeys - the Amanita muscaria, or fly agaric mushroom, for which [ 22 ]</page><page sequence="22">Plate IX Supernatural deer hunting scene on a Mochica IV terracotta vessel, northern Peru, ca.

Here, as in similar Mochica deer hunting scenes, the animal is shown in association with a tree or shrub almost certainly to be identified by its characteristic seed pods as Anadenanthera colubrina , whose seeds were, and still are, ground into a potent psychotomimetic snuff, widely known as vi/ca or willka. In some Andean communities vilca seeds are also used in an intoxicating ceremonial drink ; else- where, as in Chile, the pods may be burned and the smoke inhaled to achieve ritual intoxication. [23]</page><page sequence="23">the reindeer is said to have an inordinate predeliction (Wasson 1972:204) and which some scholars regard as the Paleolithic or Mesolithic prototype for the Meso- american mushroom cults. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the esteem, not to say veneration, with which some American In- dians regarded the deer represents a survival from an ancient, archaic, shamanistic substratum - a substratum that forms the underlying basis of American Indian ideology, including that of Mesoamerican civilization, and the ultimate roots of which lie in the religion of Eurasian Paleolithic and Mesolithic hunting and gather- ing culture. The curious association of deer as celestial mount on the shaman's ecstatic journeys and the sacred hallucinogens that are employed as aids in such mystical quests in parts of northern Asia as well as in America might well be a part of this very ancient belief system. In this connection, a new series of radiocarbon dates from rock shelter sites in Trans- Pecos Texas and north- ern Mexico is of special significance. These dates, for which I am indebted to J. M. Adovisio of the University of Pittsburgh1, confirm a time depth of over ten thousand years for the use of the potent hallucinogenic red seeds of the Sophora secundiflora shrub by Desert Culture hunters and food collectors as well as historic tribes in the same area. More than that, one important and well studied Texas site, known as Bonfire Shelter, yielded Sophora secundiflora from the lowest occupational stra- tum - Bone Bed II, with a C14 age of 8440 to 8120 B. C. , in direct association with Folsom and Plainview pro- jectile points and the bones of extinct bison. The same 1 A short paper on the topic by J. M. Adovisio and G. F. Fry was presented at the 7 1st Annual Meeting of the American Anthropol- ogical Association, Toronto, Canada, November 1972. A fuller treat- ment by the authors is in preparation. [24]</page><page sequence="24">seeds also occurred in the topmost occupational level, dated A.D. 420 to 1040, and in all of the intervening cultural deposits. A related rock shelter site in northern Mexico, Frightful Cave, similarly yielded Sophora se- cundiflora beans from its lowest level, dated at 7500 B. C. , through all subsequent cultural deposits. Interestingly enough, here, as in many other Desert Culture rock shelter sites, Sophora securidiflora was invariably asso- ciated with Ungnadia speciosa, in contexts strongly sug- gesting, according to Adovisio, ritual use. It was Weston La Barre who suggested on several occasions (e.g. 1972:270-278) that the origins of the American Indian hallucinogenic complex had to be sought ultimately in ecstatic, vision-seeking Paleoasiatic shamanism, the fundamental religion of the pre- agricultural Paleolithic and Mesolithic hunting peoples of Siberia who presumably constituted the ancestral pool from which flowed the Late Pleistocene migrations into North America. La Barre's contention, which came to be increasingly shared by some of his colleagues in the study of aboriginal American religion and the botany and anthropology of hallucinogens, thus appears to be con- firmed: the historic shamanistic "red bean" cult of the Southern Plains is at least as old as the big-game hunt- ing phase of the terminal Pleistocene and thus appears to reach back toward a time when the peopling of North America across the Bering land bridge might still have been in progress. If knowledge of ritual or divine in- ebriation with plant hallucinogens was part and parcel of the intellectual baggage of these early migrants, it implies at least equal antiquity, if not a much greater one, for such practices in Eurasia. Just when or where in prehistoric antiquity the tech- nology and chemistry of snuffing might have arisen is unknown. The concentration of these variants on the [ 25 ]</page><page sequence="25">common theme of divine inebriation especially in the Amazon suggest that area as its ultimate source. If it did indeed diffuse from the tropical lowlands, its age would have to be at least three and a half thousand years, since, as mentioned above, the earliest known snuffing implements date to the mid-second millenium B.C. The fact that in addition to its numerous other psycho- tomimetics prehispanic Mesoamerica can now be shown to have shared in a wider pan- American complex involv- ing the use of snuff opens up a host of new possibilities for culture-historical and ethnobotanical research. Ob- viously, multidisciplinary study of what now appears to have been a Mesoamerican snuffing complex of substan- tial distribution and duration is important in and of itself. At the same time, it might provide answers to questions of external relationships, especially with South America, at roughly that crucial moment in time when Neolithic- type farming communities became transformed, by some as yet little understood processes, into the first great Mesoamerican civilization - that of the Olmec.
