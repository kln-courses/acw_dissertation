Although there were attempts to imitate the great formal gardens of Italy and northern Europe, Castilian and Andalusian riverbanks continued to figure prominently in the outdoor pur suits of the nobility and in literary evocations of the locus amoenus. The lexis of gardens in early modern Spain reflected the imprecision and differences between the unbounded, informal and shady retreats from the city in the south, and the verdant, enclosed worlds of gardens in the north. Lope de Vega's short stories, the Novelas a Marcia Leonarda, are one of numerous fictionalizations of these liminal spaces that play on their moral ambivalence and contrast pleasure in their openness and informality with their hidden and public dangers. Pliny the Elder as procurator of Hispania Tarraconensis had devoted atten tion in his Naturalis Historia to Spain's plants, describing the apples, figs, plums and pomegranates, the ornamental box, broom, juniper, rose, yew and others that abounded in Iberia.1 Garden culture in the peninsula had been definitively shaped by the Muslim and Islamic gardens of the Syrian Ummay ads, who adapted the aqueducts and irrigation left behind by the Romans.2 Numerous plants that were cultivated in Spain from as early as the tenth century were not introduced into northern Europe until the sixteenth, every thing from spinach and apricots to the caulifower and white jasmine.3 Plants from the New World, on the other hand, often found their way whether as images or seeds, all over Europe from nurseries in southern Spain, such as Seville's famous botanic garden founded by Simon Tovar, a long-standing 1 See Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia, 12.7, 14.30 and 71, 16.32 and 198, 17.166, 170 and 249, 18.336, 25.84ff. 2 The best known Islamic gardens of pre-modern Spain include the Alhambra (Generalife) in Granada, Real Alcazar in Seville, Palacio de Galiana in Toledo and Alcazar in Cordoba. The primacy of Arabic achievements in the field of gardening and agriculture can be gleaned from the 'Andalusian Georgics', Ibn Luyun: Tratado de Argicultura, trans.

A botanic garden had also been founded at the University of Valencia as early as 1567. The garden history of the peninsula is still unfurrowed ground with almost no survivals from the early modern period.5 One exception, El Buen Retiro, was given by Olivares to Philip IV in 1631; its gardens designed by the Florentine, Cosme Lotti, part of the team that had worked on the Boboli gardens. Lotti had arrived in Madrid in 1628, accompanied by a carpenter and two gardeners.6 The inauguration took place in 1632 and was celebrated in verse by Lope. There is also a description in a letter by the English ambassador Walter Aston, about some festivities in 1636 involving new watersports.7 The gardens blended Italian Renaissance influences with Baroque exuberance (see Fig. 1 ) .8 Another famous garden from this period in Madrid belonging to the Flemish nobleman Jean de Croy, Count of Solre, was depicted on Pedro de Texeria's city plan from 1656. De Croy also had a vegetable garden on the banks of the Manzanares acquired from the Marquise of Villareal in 1628, which included a pavilion with paintings byjuan van der Hamen, an irrigation pump, numerous orange, lemon and lime trees, fields of barley, asparagus and artichokes. Van her Hamen's painting Offering to Flora (1627), owned by de Croy and depicting more than fifty different varieties of flower, typical of Madrid gardens of the early seventeenth century, may portray elements of de Croy's huerto (see Figure 2).9 Flowers are scarce in paintings of the sixteenth century and where they appear in pastoral novels, it is more as a literary device and evocative backdrop than a rural reality. However, a fashion for flowers led painters like Pérez Sierra to specialise in them, to such an extent that Palo mino doubted whether he produced more beautiful specimens in his garden in the calle de las Infantas or on canvas. The poet Luis de Göngora insisted in a contract following an unfortunate period under the stewardship of Cristobal de Heredia that whoever rented his Cordoban house have a gardener to look 4 Peter Mason, 'A Dragon Tree in the Garden of Eden: A Case Study of the Mobility of Objects and their Images in Early Modern Europe', Journal of the History of Collections 18 (2006), 169-85, here 175. 5 A number of valuable books on Spanish garden history have appeared in the late twentieth century: Maria Teresa de Ozores y Saavedra, Marquesa de Casa Valdés, Jardines de Espana, (Madrid: Aguilar, 1973) was the first substantial, richly illustrated book on its subject. Later scholarly books have included Consuelo M. Correcher, The Gardens of Spain (New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1993) and Carmen Anön Feliü, Monica Luengo Anon, and Ana Luengo Anon, Jardines artisticos de Espana (Madrid: Espasa Calpe, 1995). However, much remains to be done and the documentation of Spain's historic gardens is sparse. Nor has garden archaeology been pursued with vigour. At Madinat al-Zahra, one of the most important garden sites in Europe, archaeological investigation has been carried out spasmodically since the early twentieth century - but only 10 per cent of its area had been excavated by 2001. 6 Ozores y Saavedra, Jardines de Espana, 127. 7 Gregorio Maranon, El Conde-Duque de Olivares (Madrid: Espasa Calpe, 1958), 127. 8 See Jonathan Brown and J.

Lope de Vega invoked gardens as metaphor, real and imag ined spaces, in a series of poems, letters, plays and prose fictions, describing actual gardens and landscapes, imagined pastoral arcadias, as well as his own garden and horticultural activity in the Calle de Francos in the heart of Madrid. He was familiar with Andrés de Laguna's translation of Dioscorides, whether or not it played a part in his own practical experience as a gardener. He made full use of the resonances of the garden as an Edenic, georgic space redolent with allegorical possibilities, both political and sexual, and hortus conclusus, symbolic of virginity. Castilian climate shaped the particular form taken by the locus amoenus in the literary imagination as well as the kinds of outdoor pursuit that were represented there, leisure activities that blurred the boundaries between 10 Emilio Orozco Diaz, Temas del barroco de poesia y pintura (Granada: Universidad de Granada, 1989), 'Ruinas y jardines su significaciön y valor en la temâtica del barroco', 121-76, here 141 and 143.</page><page sequence="4">Lope de Vega's Novelas a Marcia Leonarda 127 Fig. lb Pedro Teixeira Albernaz, detail from Topographta de la villa de Madrid (gardens of the El Buen Retiro Palace), (Antwerp: 1656), 20 sheets of paper 45 x 56 cm, Madrid, Museo Municipal de Madrid public and private and saw Spain's great formal gardens becoming tourist attractions for throngs of people, high and low.

The heat and aridity of the parched Castilian plains encouraged literary evocations in which the characteristic shade and water figure prominently. Garcilaso de la Vega gave definitive form to the Spanish locus amoenus in his Third Eclogue and established the model for a host of imitators,13 with its blend of mythological, classical and Italianate themes, focusing on loss and death transformed through art.14 Cerca del Tajo, en soledad amena, de verdes sauces hay una espesura, toda de hiedra revestida y llena que por el tronco va hasta el altura y asf la teje arriba y encadena que'l sol no halla paso a la verdura; el agua bana el prado con sonido, alegrando la hierba y el ofdo. (11. 57-64).1 11 The speech in Alarcön's play is a model of conceptista ekphrasis: 'Entre las opacas sombras/ y opacidades espesas/ que el soto formaba de olmos,/ y la noche de tinieblas,/ ... / Llegö en su coche mi dueno,/ dando invidia a las estrellas,/ a los aires suavidad,/ y alegria a la ribera', La verdad sospechosa, ed.

The Casa de Pilatos in Seville testihes to the survival of the Islamic garden, with its tiles and fountains, patios and running water, and its conviven cia with imported Italian Renaissance styles.17 The dialogue of Antonio de Torquemada's Jardin de flores curiosas is carefully situated in a space that mirrors that of the eglogue, a 'ribera del no' (riverbank) where 'paseândonos debajo destos ârboles, gozando del frescor del aire y del no . . . debajo de esta sombra, para que el sol no nos toque; y aquf podremos oir el regocijado sonido que el agua' [walking beneath the trees, enjoying the freshness of the air and river . . . beneath this shadow, so that the sun does not touch us, here we can listen to the joyful sound of the water].18 This escape from the heat of the day frames their philosophical contemplation of nature's diversity and variety, their consideration of the size of the world and its novelties. The medieval, walled, female pleasure garden in La Celestina built for Melibea symbolizes the vanity of her father Pleberio's worldy dreams, the breaching of its walls and the loss of her virginity their end. The lovers first meet in this 'huerta', as Calisto retrieves his ironically straying bird of prey, their illicit liaison is consumated there, and in a symbolic re-enactment of the Fall from Eden, both will meet their deaths; Calisto falling after one of their trysts from the ladder propped up against the high, protective walls, spattering his brains on the cobbled street below, while Melibea commits suicide leaping from a tower overlooking the garden.19 The plants referred to in La Celestina 16 John H.

The contrast between the verdant north and parched south provoked Sir Richard Wynn to make typically slighting comments about the outdoor facilities at the Alcazar palace in Madrid where Charles lodged in 1623 during his visit: About three in the afternoon, the Prince, as usually is his wont, went down into the garden, such a one as hardly deserves the name; so nasty and ill-favouredly de Melibea (Sociedad Estatal para la Conmemoraciôn de los Centenarios de Felipe II y Carlos V, 2000).

The lexis for describing landscape and garden, the spaces of aristocratic outdoor pursuits in early modern Spain was ambiguous in a way that reflected these culturally specific uses of space. Despite the definitions in Sebastian de Covarrubias' El tesoro de la lengua Castellana (1611), where 'jardin' was defined as 'Huerto de recreacion de diversas flores y yerbas olorosas, con fuentes y cuadros repartidos con muchos lazos, y obra que llaman los latinos topiaria' [Huerto for leisure with diverse flowers and fragrant herbs, with fountains and parterres with many knots, and examples of what the Latins call topiary], the language of gardens meant that the terms 'huerto', 'huerta' and 'jardin' were used interchangeably.25 The 'huerto' or 'huerta' were defined as 'lugar o en el campo o la ciudad o poblado en el cual se crfan ârboles frutales y hortal iza ... el que tiene agua de pie y esta en la ribera, ordinariamente llamamos huerta; los que son de flores y recreaciôn se llaman jardines' [somewhere in the country, city or town where fruit trees and garden produce are cultivat ed .. . those which have running water at their feet and are on a riverbank are normally called a huerta; those that have flowers and are for recreation are called gardens].26 The fact that the definitions are made in terms of each other and the precise nature of distinctions underline that the difference is concerned with scale and function, as well as audience and genre. In his poetry collection La Filoména (1621), Lope referred to his 'jardin' in the 'Epfstola octava' to the Sevillian poet Francisco de Rioja: 'Que mi jardin, mas breue que cometa/Tiene solos dos arboles, diez flores,/Dos parras, vn naranjo, vna mosqueta,/Aqui son dos muchachos Ruisenores,/Y dos calderos de agua forman fuente' [my garden briefer than a comet has got two trees, ten flowers, two vines, an orange tree, musk rose, two male nightingales and two cauldrons full of water that make a fountain] P References in his letters to the garden at his house in the calle de Francos, however, refer to a 'huerto', 23 Sir Richard Wynn, A brief relation of what was observed by the Prince's servants in their Journey into Spain, in the Year 1623, ed.

Spain's climate shaped the nature of the outdoor spaces used by the social elites and the kinds of activity that these landscapes and backdrops lent themselves to. The confusing lexis and semantics of this area demonstrate Castile's difference from other parts of Europe. The 'jardfn' or formal garden was clearly distinct from the traditional patio or courtyard garden, similar although not identical to the 'huerto' or 'huerta' - an orchard, cultivated plot, vegetable patch, kitchen garden or parkland grounds next to a riverbank. Other common terms like 'vergel' ('huerto ameno especialmente plantado para la recreaciön') [a pleasant huerto especially planted for recreation], 'pensif, strictly a hanging garden but by extension any 'jardfn delicioso' [delightful garden] and the Toledan term 'cigarral' ('huertas cercadas, donde hai arboles frutales, y tambien sus casas') [enclosed huertas where there are fruits trees and houses] also form part of this semantic nexus.29 Lope made use of the garden, as a metaphor and space in a variety of different ways from his short stories like the Novelas a Marcia Leonarda, to his religious poetry, the hortus conclusus symbol of virginity, invok ing its resonances as a locus amoenus, an Edenic or georgic space, playing with its potential as political allegory as part of a discourse of household economy. Lope himself was also a gardener and employs a series of horitcultural con ceits in references to his 'huerto'. The protagonist of 'La prudente venganza' falls in love with his rival's bride in an orchard and is drowned by him away from prying eyes as he swims in the same river. These spaces, like the flowers they contained, symbolized beauty - the shaping power of art but also death.30 When Philip II travelled to England to marry Mary Tudor in 1554, the accounts of his courtiers assimilated their experience of landscape through the popular romances of chivalry, like Amadis de Gaula and Palmerin, whose 28 Ibid., fol. 152v.

Other versions of this theme are found in the work of Lope where flowers compete with the infinity of stars and paintings of spring's carpets, see Arcadia (Madrid: Luis Sanchez, 1598), sig.

These instructions were reiterated in Brussels in 1556 and in 1557, despite the scale of business confronting him while in London, Philip worried enough about the gardens of his palace to issue additional instructions.34 Influenced perhaps by his sojourn as king of England, he introduced the English elm, along with the Oriental plane, at the heart of the planting scheme at Aranjuez, which one traveller claimed later in the century had more than 200,000 trees.35 Even before this first important horticultural project of Philip's reign began in earnest in October 1561 under the direction of Juan Bautista de Toledo, the king had commissioned reports from royal gardeners Gaspar de Vega and Jeronimo Algora. The report by Gaspar de Vega signed on 16 May 1556 described a visit to Fontainebleau: 'no me pareciö tan gran cosa, como tiene la fama; el es grande edefiçio y ay en el cosas muy ricas de pinturas y tallas, especialmente dos galerias que tiene, que la una es mas grande que la grande de Londres' [it did not seem to me to be as great as it is esteemed; it is a large palace with many beautiful paintings and sculptures, especially two galleries that it has, one of which is bigger than the big one [probably the Privy Gallery in Whitehall] in London], about which Philip commented in a marginal annotation 'Que hizo bien en escrevirme todo esto ... la de Xanburg [Chambord] dexo, que dicen que es la mejor, como lo dira alla el marques de Cortes' [he did well to write to me of all of 31 See Glyn Redworth, 'Nuevo mundo u otro mundo?: conquistadores, cortesanos, libros de caballerfas y el reinado de Felipe el Breve de Inglaterra', A etas del I Congreso Anglo-Hispano, 3 vols.

His architect Juan de Herrera sent the royal gardener Jeronimo Algora to inspect French, English, Dutch and Italian gardens and wrote in a letter on the horticulturalist's death in 1567 that amongst his books, one on Italian gardens by the Italian architect Serlio, who worked on Fontainebleau for Francis I, was 'bueno de tomar' [worth holding on to].37 Philip as king of England and head of the Habsburg empire took time to inform himself and carefully plan in person every aspect of Spain's horticultural transformation. The leading classical authority on botany, Dioscorides was published in a fresh Latin translation by Andrés Laguna in 1554 and dedicated to Philip's secretary Gonzalo Pérez. Laguna complained that the original text had been perverted, mutilated and truncated in as many as seven hundred places by previous translators.38 A vernacular translation was published in Antwerp in September 1555, this time dedicated to Philip himself who had just crossed the channel to Brussels, alleging that Spanish 'por nuestro descuydo, o por alguna siniestra constelacion, ha sido siempre la menos cultiuada de todas, con ser ella la mas capaz, ciuil, y fecunda de las vulgares' [as a result of our carelessness or for some malign heavenly influence has always been the least cultivated, despite being the most able, civil and fertile modern language] and as a result despite translations into many other tongues, the lack of medical knowledge in Spain was having serious adverse consequences.39 He is silent about the journeys he has made and amount he has expended bringing plants from Greece, Egypt and Berbery 'muchos simples exquisitos y raros, para conferirlos con sus historias' [many simple, exquisite and rare specimens to corroborate with their descriptions], however, he hopes that after his refusal by the Imperial ambas sador in Venice Francisco de Vargas that: 'vos nos allanareys de tal arte el camino, que podamos como por nuestras casas, hollando aquellas naciones barbaras, caminar por todo el Oriente, y contemplar, y aun traher por vuestros Reynos en triumpho, aquellas Diuinas plantas' [you will smooth the way for this art, so that we are able as if we were in our own homes to set foot in barbarous kingdoms and traverse the Orient, contemplate and even bring in triumph into 36 Iniguez, Casas reales y jardines de Felipe II, 166.

Plants are then discussed through their anthropomorphic virtues: justice, in remaining as they do always in their correct spot; charity, allowing other plants to grow on them; strength, the palm tree bending but never breaking; conjugal love, with the female palm dying away in the absence of the male tree; religion, heliotropic plants following the sun; liberality, with their fruit - and so on. He ends his dedication calling on Philip to establish great gardens in Spain: pues todos los Principes, y las universidades de Italia, se precian de tener en sus tierras, muchos y muy excellentes jardines, adornados de todas las plantas que se pueden hallar en el vniuerso: tambien V.

As one critic has commented by 1559, Philip 'trafa una aßciön poco frecuente, pero muy noble y simpâtica, por los ârboles, flores y jardines' [was possessed of an uncommon but most noble and pleasant affection for trees, flowers and gardens] .42 The horticulturalist Gregorio de los Rios, who as we saw underlined the licit and improving nature of cultivation 'aparta los hombres de todos los vicios' [it removes men from all manner of vice]43 dubbed him 'Antofilo' [Flower-lover] in his horticultural treatise, Agri cultura de jardines (1592), three years after he was made a chaplin of the Casa del Campo, an estate purchased from the royal secretary Fadrique de Vargas in 1562 by Philip.44 A series of Flemish and French gardeners began to arrive in Spain from 1561 onwards: Juan Holbecq from Tournai (260 florins a year); Héctor Henneton; Juan Bordiau; Daniel andjoos Van Honele; Guillermo Coluens; Guillaume de Voos; Estienne and Marthurin Rouet; Juan Lengle: Juan Rebondi; Rugel Patien.45 According to the traveller, Lamberto Wyts in 1571, Holbecq or Hollebecke, had been joined by his brother to oversee the 40 Ibid., sig. f 3r. 41 Ibid., sig.

The white and red invoke the prosopopeia in invocations of the the beloved in courtly poetry, while the classical allusion populates the garden's planting with a mythological schema. It alludes to avenues, pictures created out of flowers, figures artificially sculpted from myrtles, i.e. topiary, and garden buildings from which the crystalline waters of the river can be touched: 'puede bien desde un bajo aposento/ tocar la mano al agua cristalina' [a hand can well trail in the clear water from a chamber on the banks'.51 It is full of theatrical effects testifying to art's ability to transcend and outdo nature: Pomone alb, con mano delicada lo natural con arte aderezando, esta en la planta a Venus dedicada 48 Ibid., 155. 49 Pitys, who was transformed into a pine tree, but more likely Syrinx who was turned into a water reed from which Pan fashioned his famous pipes. 50 Libro de la monteria que mando escreuir el muy alto y muy poderoso Rey Don Alonso de Castilla, y de Leon, ultimo deste nombre.

[Pomona there, with delicate hand adorning nature with skilled art, is pattern ing a variety of figures with the plant sacred to Venus,52 here a bird, there a tireless wild beast, her mimicry so lifelike that there will be those who cast a net over the birds and fear the wild animals.]53 The garden's mimesis is such that it reverses the Ovidian transformations commonly thematized in Renaissance gardens. One of the most surprising aspects of Gomez de Tapia's poem is its reference to the garden's use by all estates of society, its attraction as a site of pilgrimage for tourists: 'De gente esta la estancia siempre llena/ que de apartada parte y de vecina,/ cuâl de obscuro linaje, cuâl de claro,/ a ver concurren el milagro raro' [the estate is always full of people, from far and wide, of illustrious lineage and low, who gather to witness this strange miracle].54 This natural space like the miracle is universal and egalitarian in its significance and appeal. In addi tion to this Arcadian version of Aranjuez, as an image of political harmony, Gonazalo Argote de Molina incorporated in his edition of the Alfonsine hunting treatise, a very different description of the royal palace of El Pardo near Madrid: en torno [de la casa] vna ancha caua, y en el fondo della munchos compartimien tos, Vasos y Macetas de yeruas médicinales, y Flores estranas, traydas con mucha curiosidad de diuersas regiones, adornadas las paredes de la Caua con Iazmines, Yedra y Rosas, en cada esquina vna fuente de agua que por Maxcarones de Piedra sale.55 [around the house a broad ditch, at the bottom of which were many compart ments, urns and pots with medicinal herbs, and strange flowers, brought with great curiosity from diverse regions, adorning the walls of the hollow jasmines, ivy and roses, at each corner a fountain of water spouted from stone figure heads.] This is a more traditional palace garden with privileged views from the house of the parterres, a mixture of the medicinal and floral - a variety of planting that reflected the reach of Habsburg power, its imperial exoticism. While Gomez de Tapia's eclogue merely alluded to the gardens' variety of trees some native others imported 'ârboles de especies diferentes,/ parte Presumably the rose. Ibid., fol. 22r, sigs. 1115r.

Suple la falta de la tierra el arte, y del calor con limite y del hielo aquello que conviene les reparte.57 [whoever here strives to fulfill their nature, although their origins may have brought them from another place where the sun imparts more or less heat. The lack of the soil is supplemented by art, heat with limit and cold with that which it is convenient to share out.] The co-operation and equilibrium of a personified natural world contrasts with the unchristian envy of post-lapsarian human societies: las amistades con que las plantas fértiles se prestan y templan sus contrarias calidades? Y cömo no se impiden ni molestan por ver su fruta en extranjeras hojas, ni del agravio apelan y protestan, como tu, fragil hombre, que te enojas si al otro ves tener lo que no es tuyo. (11. 34—41).

And how they do not annoy or stand in each other's way when they see their fruit on foreign leaves, nor do they protest and appeal against the offence like you do fragile man, who becomes enraged when you see others have what you do not.] Symbiotic plant life, tempering extremity and symbolising peaceful co-existence is used as a metaphor to underline the greed for possession characteristic of human society.

In 1589, while in exile in Valencia, Lope composed a romance 'Hortelano era Belardo' [Belardo was a gardener] (Belardo was one of the poet's numerous literary disguises),60 which contained an extensive list of plants, whose medici nal, magical, iconographie and symbolic qualities were applied to different types of women. It advised suggestively, for example, 'lirios y verbena' [lilies and verbena] for widows to green their black mourning 'saya' [skirt].61 It was published in Lisbon in 1593 as part of the Ramillete déflorés. Cuarta parte de Flor de romances nuevosy canciones [Bunch of Rowers. The Fourth Part of the Rower of New Romances and Songs], just months after Gregorio de los Rios' Argricultura de jardines appeared.62 Three years later in 1592, Lope composed a 'Descripcion del Abadia, jardin del duque de Alba', which appeared in print in the 1604 edition of his Rimas. The La Abadia garden in the province of Câceres created by a Flemish garden designer by 1577, combined statuary, topiary, waterworks and grottoes, rare plants from Flanders and Germany with the myrtles, lemon and orange trees and jasmine typical in the south.63 Lope's poem is a conven tional literary celebration, incarnating the topoi of idealized landscapes in early modern Castile; its aquatic nymphs 'Nâyades puras, que de roxo acanto,/ de lirios y rétamas amarillas/hazéis a Tormes espacioso manto' [Water nymphs, who make for the river Tormes a spacious cloak of red acanthus, lilies and yellow retama], myrtle hedges dividing beds of floral profusion, 'Entre murtas iguales vertiô Flora/ gran parte de la copia de Amaltea' [Amongst myrtles Flora poured out the best part of Amalthea's abundance], and the impenetrable canopy of vegetation shading from the sun 'esta verdura que defiende el passo/ al sol, que a su pessar entrar procura' 58 Ibid., 154. 59 Cervantes included a description of Aranjuez's gardens in Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda, ed.

The latter, La Circe, in which three of the four novelas appeared (including 'La prudente venganza') was dedicated on its title page to the Count-Duke Olivares and jointly in the dedication to Olivares' mother, also a member of the Pimentel family, and his daughter Dona Maria de Guzman. Lope had been turned down by the new king's father for the post of royal chronicler as recently as 1620. The text has a dual or triple addressee, 64 Lope de Vega, Rimas, ed.

Finally, both of these supposed addressees figure within the self-fashioning of Lope before a wider public, his characteristically intimate autobiographical strain subsumed within a courtly political one, designed to draw in and impress the most important addressee, his public as an artist 'pretendiendo el vulgar aplauso' [seeking the vulgar applause],73 but whose greatest fear was not 'cosa arro jadiza' [chuckable things],74 but to be tedious. His stories according to the introduction to 'La desdicha por la honra' used: ya de cosas altas, ya de humildes, ya de episodios y paréntesis, ya de historias, ya de fabulas, ya de reprehensiones y ejemplos, ya de versos y lugares de autores pienso valerme, para que ni sea tan grave el estilo que canse a los que no saben, ni tan desnudo de algün arte que le remitan al polvo los que endenden.75 [elevated themes at times, humble ones at others, episodes, parentheses, histo ries, fables, reprehensions and examples, verse, commonplaces and authorities, so that the style is not so serious as to tire the ignorant nor so bare of artfulness that those who know consign it to the dust.] His prose was directed at a multiple readership both humble and erudite, intermingling learned and erudite discourse, 'lugares de autores' [common places from authorities] with fables, true stories, episode and exempla. Their Baroque excess revels in deviating from classical aesthetic ideals of symmetry and proportion, offering in place of unity, variety, an emergent poetics of admiratio brought about by the sheer wealth of what is woven together in a given story. His decentering congeries are typified in the novellas' most char acteristic rhetorical device amplification6 This rhetorical figure is used not to reinforce, elucidate or expand but more often to undercut, confound and 71 This story is discussed at length by Ali Rizavi, 'Novelas a Marcia Leonarda in Alexander Samson and Jonathan Thacker (eds.), A Companion to Lope de Vega (Woodbridge: Tamesis, 2008), 244-55. 72 Lope de Vega, Novelas a Marcia Leonarda, 106. 73 Arte nuevo de hacer comedias, 132. 74 Miguel de Cervantes, Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses nuevos, nunca representados (Madrid: Alonso Martin, 1615), fol.

In this, he differs significantly from Cervantes. It has been argued that his Novelas are an implicit response to Cervantine poetics, underlining his elite credentials through the profusion of learned, didactic exemplification, offer ing an alternative to the notion of propiedad [propriety/appropriateness] at the level of plot77: 'habfan de escribirlos hombres cientfficos o por lo menos grandes cortesanos, gente que halla en los desenganos notables sentencias y aforismos' [they ought to be written by learned men or at least great courtiers, people who find in disillusionment notable aphorisms and sentential ,7S Again this pose that only great courtiers and philosophers should write novels runs counter to the notion that fiction be judged for the propriety of its imitation of life rather than for its morally salutary effects, a reaction against the humanist condemnations of prose fiction.79 The term 'ejemplar' found in the titles of many of the collections of short stories produced in this period is notably absent from Lope's presentation of his tales. 'La prudente venganza' ends with a summary of its significance that calls into question the presenta tion of the narrative: 'Esta fue la prudente venganza, si alguna puede tener este nombre, no escrita, como he dicho, para ejemplo de los agraviados, sino para escarmiento de los que agravian' [This was the prudent revenge, if any can be described as such, not written, as I have said as an example for the offended, but as a warning to those who offend].80 The title is signalled as oxymoronic, while the narrative's exemplarity in any moral sense is explicitly eschewed, the consequences are nevertheless admonitory from a pragmatic perspective. Throughout the story, the feelings and motives of its protagonists and victims, Laura and Lisardo, are the subject of a refusal to pass moral judgement, being excused by their love for one another or inexperience, the narrator adding: 'Vuestra merced juzgue si esta dama era cuerda, que yo nunca me he puesto a corregir a quien ama' [Your worship mayjudge whether this lady was in her right mind, I have never sought to criticise those who love].81 The refusal to pass sentence ironizes the rhetorical procedure of offering up sententiae, even as it undermines the authority of the narrator to do so, with its ironic sideways glance at the author's own autobiographical noto riety for sexual impropriety. When the avenging husband Marcelo finds the objects, letters, a portrait, and jewels that confirm the adultery, the narrator inserts a warning for those 77 See Marina Brownlee, The Poetics of Literary Theory: Lope de Vega's Novelas a Marcia Leonarda and their Ceruantine Context (Madrid: Porrua, 1981) and Carmen Rabell, Lope de Vega: el arte nuevo de hacer 'novelas' (Woodbrige: Tamesis, 1992) and Rewriting the Italian Novella in Counter-Reformation Spain (Woodbridge: Tamesis, 2003). 78 Lope de Vega, Novelas a Marcia Leonarda, 106. 79 See Barry Ife, Reading and Fiction in Golden-Age Spain (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985). 80 Lope de Vega, Novelas a Marcia Leonarda, 284. 81 Ibid., 247.

As the revenge of the title unfolds in another aside to his mistress Marcia Leonarda (Marta Nevares), the narra tor invokes Christian precept to point to a morality radically different from that on which the familiar dynamics of its plot depends, based instead on imperfection, acceptance and forgiveness, rather than perfect virtue and the bloody avenging of its violation. In order to bear the public shame of infidel ity, he suggests husbands exile themselves and offer up their suffering to God, remembering that what has happened to them, could as easily have been done by them: aunque las leyes por el justo dolor permiten esta licencia a los maridos, no es ejemplo que nadie debe imitar, aunque aqui se escriba para que lo sea a las mujeres que con desordenado apetito aventuran la vida y la honra a tan breve deleite, en grave ofensa de Dios, de sus padres, de sus esposos y de su fama. Y he sido de parecer siempre que no se lava bien la mancha de la honra del agraviado con la sangre del que le ofendiô, porque lo que fue no puede dejar de ser y desatino creer que se quita, porque se mate al ofensor, la ofensa del ofendido. Lo que hay en esto es que el agraviado se queda con su agravio y el otro, muerto, satisfaciendo los deseos de la venganza, pero no las calidades de la honra, que para ser perfecta no ha de ser ofendida. ,-Quién duda que esta ya la objeciön a este argumenta dando voces? Pues, aunque tâcita, respondo que no se ha de sufrir ni castigar. Pues ;qué medio se ha de tener? El que un hombre tiene cuando le ha sucedido otro cualquiera género de desdicha: perder la patria, vivir fuera délia donde no le conozcan y ofrecer a Dios aquella pena, acordândose que le pudiera haber sucedido lo mismo si en alguno de los agravios que ha hecho a otros le hubieran castigado. Que querer que los que agraviô le sufran a él y él no sufrir a nadie, no esta puesto en razôn; digo sufrir, dejar de matar violentamente, pues por sölo quitarle a él la honra, que es una vanidad del mundo, quiere él quitarles a Dios, si se les pierde el aima.83 [although the law for the just pain permits husbands this licence, it is not an example anyone ought to imitate, although here it may be written so that it may be one for women who with disordered appetite risk life and honour for such brief enjoyment, in grave offence of God, their parents, husbands and reputa tion. I have always believed that the stain on the offended party's honour is not washed away by the blood of the offender, because that which was, can not cease to be and it is a mistake to believe the husband's offence is taken away, because the offending party is killed. What happens here is that the offended party remains injured and the other dead, satisfying the desire for revenge, but not dictates of reputation, which to be perfect can not be touched.

To want those who offend to suffer and to suffer from no-one, is not reasonable; I say suffer, allow to be killed violently, for merely having destroyed his reputation, which is a vanity of this world, he wants to take their punishment away from God, even if it loses him his soul.] This moment is the crux of Lope's tale, deliberately establishing a dialogue with its non-exemplary ending. The story depends upon a conventional acceptance of reputation even as it destabilizes its lethal significance from the perspective of a tolerant and liberal sexual morality founded in Chris tian ideals, according to which honour is a worldly vanity, the bloody execu tion of an adulterer, murder of the worst kind, committed out of pride and self-regard. This juxtaposition uses a discourse of Christian morality to desta bilize the honour code.84 The ambivalence of the narrator's pronounce ments about the adulterous passions of the central pair is further ironized by the fact that it is framed by his own seduction. The writing itself is an attempt to gain the favour of his lover, Marcia Leonarda, with whom he has had an adulterous relationship, married during the first two or three years of their relationship and unmarried to him even after her husband's death. Acknowledged within the fictional frame of the text, when he digresses on the origins of the Hymen myth to distract her from the story's unpleasant aspects: No pienso que le habrâ sido a vuestra merced gustoso el episodio, en razôn de la poca inclinaciön que tiene al senor Himeneo de los atenienses; pero por lo menos le desvi del agravio injusto que hicieron estas bodas al ausente Lisardo y la facilidad con que se persuadiô la mal vengada Laura.85 [I don't think that this episode will have been enjoyable for your worship, because of your little inclination to the Athenian Lord Hymen, the unjust offence that these nuptials did to the absent Lisardo and the ease with which the ill-avenged Laura was persuaded.] The narrator laments at the outset the aptness of his story at all for the purpose of pleasing her because of its ultimately tragic nature. This moral complexity is inflected and reflected in his use of outdoor spaces and the garden, playing with symbolic imagery of water and nature, to under line the tragedy and ambivalences of his protagonists' courtship. After two years during which Lisardo and Laura coming and going from mass on feast 84 Recent scholarship has challenged monolithic and particularist assumptions about the honour code in Spain and attempted to situate honour within a broader context of familial relations and European culture concluding that what made Spain different in this regard was the existence of the honour plays, see Scott Taylor, Honor and Violence in Golden Age Spain (New Haven 8c London: Yale University Press, 2008), 5-9 and 231-2. 85 Lope de Vega, Novelas a Marcia Leonarda, 259.</page><page sequence="24">Lope de Vega's Novelas a Marcia Leonarda 147 days do nothing more than 'hacer los ojos lenguas' [make their eyes tongues], Lisardo discovers that: iban a una huerta Laura y sus padres, donde habfan de estar hasta la noche. Tiénelas hermosisimas Sevilla en las riberas de Guadalquivir, rio de oro, no en las arenas . . . sino en que por él entran tantas ricas flotas, llenas de plata y oro del Nuevo Mundo.86 [Laura and her parents were going to a garden/orchard/estate, where they were going to spend the time until nightfall. Seville has exquisitely beautiful gardens on the banks of the Guadalquivir, a river of gold, not in its sands . . . but in that it is into this river that rich fleets come from the New World full of silver and gold.] Although not explicitly described as theirs, it becomes clear later in the story that it is, when Lisardo's servants, disobeying him, go to the house to which the garden belongs, where they are provided with food by the servants and invited by the party to play after claiming to be musicians, so the black slave girls can dance. The public/private nature of the space is perhaps importantly not made excessively explicit. Despite the historicist detail that the riverbanks are not golden, sands feature prominent in the imaginary invoked in describ ing what Lisardo sees: ocupö lo mas escondido de la güerta. Llego con sus padres Laura, y pensando que de solos los ârboles era vista, en sölo el faldeliïn, cubierto de oro, y pretinilla, comenzö a correr por ellos, a la manera que suelen las doncellas el dia que el recogimiento de su casa les permite la licencia del campo.87 [He occupied the most hidden part of the garden. Laura arrived with her parents, and believing herself to be seen only by the trees, began to run amongst them dressed in her petticoat, covered in gold, and waist band, as maids do on the day the enclosure of their houses gives way to the liberty of the country.] At this point the narrator inserts a comparison between Laura and Marcia/ Marta: 'si no me engaho, la vi en él un dia tan descuidada como Laura, pero no menos hermosa' [If I am not mistaken, I saw you once as carefree as Laura, and no less beautiful] .8S The consistent parallels traced between the story and its narrative frame, titillate the reader(s) to move between them and read ironies in the narrator's reassurances to his addressee that her state, as a widow, insulates her from the dangers faced by Laura and the warning of her example to those who transgress: 'Dios la puso en estado que no tiene que temer cuando tuviera condiciön para tales peligros' [God placed you {Marta} in a state in which you don't have to fear].

The narrator again seemingly disavows his own authority by presenting their love as a demonstrably literary discourse, ironically drawn from one of his own poems: Lisardo, pues, contemplaba en Laura, y ella se alargö tanto, corriendo por varias sendas, que cerca de donde él estaba la parô un arroyo, que, como dicen los romances, murmuraba o se reia, mayormente aquel principio: Riyéndose va un arroyo; sus guijas parecen dientes, porque vio los pies descalzos a la primavera alegre. Y no he dicho esto a vuestra merced sin causa, porque él debiö de refrse de ver los de Laura, hermosa primavera entonces, que, convidada del cristal del agua y del bullicio de la arena, que hacfa algunas pequenas islas, pensando detenerla, competîan entrambos, se descalzô y los band un rato, pareciendo en el arroyo ramo de azucenas en vidrio.90 [Lisardo, then, contemplated Laura, and she ran off so far down various paths, until near to where he was a stream halted her, that, as they say in the romances, murmured or laughted, mostly that principal one: Laughing flows a stream; its pebbles seem like teeth, because it saw the naked feet of happy spring. And I have not told your worship this without reason, since he/it must have laughed to see Laura, beautiful spring then, invited by the crystalline water and the bustle of the sand, that formed little islets, thinking to stop her, the two competed with each other, she slipped of her shoes and bathed her feet a while, seeming in the stream lilies in glass.] The personified stream blurs into and merges with Lisardo, as they compete with each other in their happy laughter, a conceit self-consciously signalled as literary by the narrator pointing to a poem probably by Lope himself. The slight impropriety of the term 'contemplar' [contemplate] and its Neopla tonic resonance is immediately undercut by poetic cliché. While the merging of Lisardo with the water foreshadows his watery grave at the end, the per sonified water and sand call on Laura to display that most erotic synecdoche, her feet. The moment is brought to a climax with a simile comparing her feet in the water to lilies in a glass vase.91 This image is doubly suggestive of the 89 Ibid., 236. 90 Ibid., 239. 91 Curiously the Spanish 'azucena' derives from the Arabic su [line over u]san which refers to an iris but came to refer to the lilium candidum or 'Annunciation' lily.

The rhetorical strategy here constructs an image of erotic contemplation out of religious imagery, mixing 'lo divino a lo profano', in a reversal of the con trafacta poetry practised by Lope in his Rimas sacras (1612). Lisardo's erotic ecstasy is a reiteration of the Annunciation. This passage is evocative of generic models that, with the narrator's ingenuous interventions, are ironized and subverted. Nature is simultaneously an object of spiritual contemplation, erotic suggestion, poetic artificiality and anthropomorphic substitution in this passage. Lope's heterodox use of genre here reminds us of the vertiginous interpénétration of the spiritual and profane. In his poetic celebration of the minor cult figure who later became Madrid's patron saint in 1622, Isidro (1599), the protagonist is taunted byjealous fellow labourers for not respond ing to his wife's suspected adultery by 'herir y matar . . . era infamia callar los que sin honra vivfan' [wounding and killing ... it was infamy to keep quiet those who lived without honour] ,92 He is drawn back by the erotic image of Susana in the garden, an image later elaborated on in Pastores deBelén (1611), a mixture of prose and poetry retelling from the perspective of the shepherds the story from the Annunciation to the nativity. The erotic evocation of the garden sits uncomfortably in both examples. A typical example of Lope's use of amplificatio occurs when he invokes his own garden to reflect upon the insatiable greed of the courtesan who is bleeding Lisardo's friend Otavio dry, an unnecessary and abstruse allegori cal example taken from his own experience as a gardener. Hame acontecido reparar en unas yerbas que tengo en un pequeno huerto, que con la furia del sol de los caniculares se desamayan de forma que, tendidas por la tierra, juzgo por imposible que se levanten; y echândoles agua aquella noche, las hallo por la manana como pudieran estar en abril después de una amorosa lluvia. Este efeto considero en la tibieza y desmayo del amor de las cortesanas, cuando la plata y oro las despierta y alegra tan velozmente, que el galân que de noche fue aborrecido porque no da, a la manana es querido porque ha dado.93 [I have noted that certain herbs I have in a little garden, which beneath the fury of the dog-day sun wilt in such a way that drooping on the ground I judge it impossible for them to rise again; watering them that night, I find them in the morning as they might be in April after a loving rainfall. In this effect I consider the coldness and failing love of courtesans, when silver and gold awakes them so swiftly that the suitor hated that night because he does not give, is beloved in the morning because he has.] Here the water signifies wealth and sexual tumescence, with the flowers standing for the ostentatiously, insatiably greedy courtesans. Lisardo's fate is 92 {Lope de Vega, Obras Escogidas (Madrid: Aguilar, 1953), pp. 432 and 1218.| 93 Ibid., 252-3.</page><page sequence="27">150 A lexander Samson similarly tied to the water with which he is compared in his moment of contemplation, when swimming in the river in the hot summer, Marcelo finally completes his revenge two years later by drowning him, his body washing up on the banks. The narrator concludes his story in the river: y porque se vea cuân verdadero saliö el adagio de que los ofendidos escriben en mârmol y en agua los que ofenden, pues Marcelo tenia en el corazön la ofensa, mârmol en dureza, dos largos anos, y Lisardo tan escrita en el agua, que muriö en ella.94 [and so you may see how true that aphorism is that the offended grave in marble and the offenders in water, since Marcelo held the offence in his heart, stony hard, two long years, and Lisardo so written in water that he died in it.] The aphorism is Lope's own and again insubstantial, another improvization on memory, playing on a paradox of permanence and immanence. Lisardo's first exchanges with his beloved take place in an orchard on a riverbank, the same place where he is later drowned by the cuckolded husband while swim ming, away from the eyes of potential witnesses. The garden was of course viewed as Edenic and arcadian, pre-lapsarian, a place of philosophical con templation, but it also always carried within it the seed of its own destruction, the expulsion following the Fall. Flowers symbolized the fleeting nature of beauty and pointed at death. Whilst perhaps the garden does not possess the moral seriousness in Lope that it has within the semiotic architecture of Calderon,95 it reflects upon the complexity and ambivalence of ornament, rhetoric, poetry, sexual morality and authorship. The climate and geography of Spain produced a very specific set of metaphors and associations for the symbolic and allegorical invocation of the garden, landscapes and their uses for outdoor leisure pursuits. The unboundedness of the locus amoenus on the riverbank where Spaniards sought refuge from the pitiless Castilian sun reflected the difference of their unbounded nature. The ambivalence of the garden symbolizes a growing lack of interest in the moral ends of fictional texts and a rejection of artificially imposed notions of aesthetic unity not found in the nature that day by day, Lope the horituculturalist and gardener tended and shaped in his real and imagined gardens.
