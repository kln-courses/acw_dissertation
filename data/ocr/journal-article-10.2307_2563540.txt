Abstract. New electron microscope obser- vations reveal that organic inclusions are often trapped in pockets under rock varnish. Accel- erator radiocarbon dating of subvarnish organic detritus provides a new method of constraining when a rock was exposed by cul- tural or geomorphic processes. Applications are exemplified for human artifacts and land- forms found in drylands. Three radiocarbon dates from 30,000 to 36,000 yr B.P. indicate rock engravings in South Australia are among the oldest art yet found in the world and show that humans migrated into what is now the "arid zone" of Australia at least 10,000 years earlier than previously thought. The first direct age control on Nazca geoglyphs and subter- ranean irrigation aqueducts in southern Peru indicate manufacture around 1400 to 2100 yr B.P. Geoglyphs along the Colorado River were made before 1100 yr B.P. Artifacts from a quarry site in the Mojave Desert, California, yield minimum 14C ages from 3700 to 26,000 yr B.P.

OCK varnish is a dark coating that is ubiquitous on exposed rocks in dry- lands. Although this accretion of clay minerals and manganese and iron oxides occurs in wetter climates (e.g., Whalley et al. 1990), aridity and alkalinity in deserts promote Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 82(1), 1992, pp. 136-151 ? Copyright 1992 by Association of American Geographers its stability (Elvidge and Iverson 1983; Jones 1991). The presence of rock varnish on fea- tures such as the Pyramids of Egypt (Black- welder 1948) and its differential development on cultural artifacts and landforms have prompted speculation on its use as an indi- cator of antiquity (e.g., Hayden 1976; Derby- shire et al. 1984). Many different methods have been used to estimate the age of rock varnish, thereby providing a minimum age for the exposure of the underlying rock by cultural or natural processes (cf. Dorn 1989). Of these, radiocarbon dating is the focus of this paper. The widespread use of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) to measure radiocarbon within the last six years has caused a revolu- tion in the application of radiocarbon dating to fields such as geomorphology, paleoclima- tology, archaeology, and other areas of Qua- ternary research (see review in Linick et al. 1989). The great advantage of AMS is its ability to measure the radiocarbon content in sam- ples of only a few milligrams. This has made it possible to radiocarbon-date coatings on rocks, including rock paintings (Russ et al. 1990), calcium carbonate (Dragovich 1986), oxalate (Watchman 1991), and silica skins (Watchman 1990), as well as rock varnish. This paper presents a new approach to the age determination of rock varnish by radiocarbon dating. Instead of chemically concentrating "bulk" organic matter spread throughout a lower layer in rock varnish, we extract pieces of detrital organic matter that have been encapsulated by accreting varnish. This new approach has significance for geo-</page><page sequence="2">Radiocarbon Dating of Rock Varnish 137 graphical research in diverse areas, exempli- fied here for the use of drylands by prehistoric cultures. Butzer (1991) has observed that there are substantial spatial and temporal gaps in the record of Pleistocene human migration. Pleis- tocene occupation sites, with stratigraphic sequences appropriate for conventional dat- ing methods, are buried and difficult to locate. In contrast, rock varnish is present on easily identified cultural features exposed at the sur- face, such as artifacts and rock engravings. Rock varnish is not a tool used to decipher the history of sediments found in a vertical col- umn. Its widespread distribution is an inher- ent advantage in answering spatial questions. For example, dating rock varnish found on surficial cultural material has the potential to provide a more efficient means of establishing a minimum age for the initial migration of humans into an arid region, as well as to aid in the study of the long-term use of drylands by humans. Sampling rock varnish also provides a more efficient means of radiocarbon dating desert landforms than searching for deposits of bur- ied organic matter that are rarely preserved in drylands. Ages for desert surfaces are of sig- nificance to geomorphology because they can be used to provide insight into long-term rates of dryland geomorphic processes and to test models of landscape evolution. A New Approach to Radiocarbon Dating Rock Varnish Since Laudermilk (1931) first observed organic carbon as a trace element, only a few studies have been conducted on the nature of organic matter in rock varnish. The stable car- bon isotope composition is similar to adjacent plant material (Dorn and DeNiro 1985). The amino acid composition of one Arizona sam- ple reflects a microbial origin (Nagy et al. 1990). Yet with AMS it became possible to radiocarbon-date milligram quantities of organic matter extracted from rock varnish while not knowing exactly what was being dated. In an evaluation of the potential of radio- carbon dating varnish, Dorn et al. (1989) treated the lowest layer of rock varnish in order to concentrate enough organic matter from a bulk sample for AMS measurement. The samples were collected from sites of known age. The chemical process used to extract organic matter was similar to concen- trating of pollen from sediments. Although this research demonstrated the feasibility of radiocarbon dating varnish, there was no clear understanding of where the dated organic matter was actually located in rock varnish. Dorn et al. (1989) assumed that the organic matter was dispersed throughout the varnish, perhaps in oxides of manganese and iron. Subsequently, this assumption has been shown to be false. Transmission electron microscope studies have shown that varnish oxides do not contain organic matter (Krinsley et al. 1990), and preliminary amino acid studies suggest that organic matter is not well pre- served within varnish layers (Nagy et al. 1990). The fundamental methodological advance presented in this paper is based on a deter- mination of where organic matter occurs in rock varnish. Examination of thousands of cross-sections by light and electron micro- scopy reveals that organic carbon occurs in discrete inclusions as pieces of detritus. These fragments are almost always found either at the very surface of the varnish or trapped under the varnish at the rock interface (Fig. la-h). In only a few instances have we observed microinclusions of organic matter in the middle of varnish (e.g., Fig. 1j). Organic Figure 1.

In a, b, d, and e, the upper line separates the varnish from the subvarnish organic matter. In others, the line separates varnish and rock. Organic matter (OM) was distinguished by morphology, low counts with energy-dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX), very low characteristic varnish peaks (e.g., Mn, Fe, Si, Al) in spot analyses by EDAX, and the similarity of these spectra to organic matter resting on the surface of rock varnishes.

It was not until late 1989 that these structures were correctly identified as subvarnish organic fragments. Knowing that microinclusions of organic matter occur underneath rock varnish permits us to assume the following sequence: (1) A cultural or natural process exposes a new rock surface to the atmosphere. This is the event that we want to date. (2) Rock-surface organ- isms such as lichen, cyanobacteria, or fungi grow in rock depressions. (3) Rock varnish growth in the depression encapsulates the organic matter (Fig. 1). Radiocarbon dating this subvarnish organic matter, therefore, provides a minimum age for the exposure of the under- lying surface. While it is theoretically possible that organic matter older than rock exposure settled on the surface of a rock before the varnish started to accrete, perhaps deflated from older soils or ancient exposed lake beds, this is unlikely for three reasons: (1) The 813C composition of varnish suggests the organic matter is derived from adjacent plant material (Dorn and DeNiro 1985). (2) AMS 14C dating of varnish collected from sites with independent age control reveal varnish ages that are always younger than the controls (Dorn et al. 1989), even though the method used to extract the organic matter was not as precise as the new approach. (3) AMS radiocarbon measurements of carbon on con- temporary rock surfaces do not reveal anom- alously old ages. Dust and organisms (cyano- bacteria and fungi) growing on Fort Paiute, constructed in 1868 in the Mojave Desert of eastern California, were analyzed by AMS. The radiocarbon concentration (compared to "modern") in these samples is 1.21 ? 0.01 (AA- 6533) and 1.30 ? 0.01 (AA-6534), respectively. The following section outlines the methods used to date microinclusions of subvarnish organic matter. Methodology The first stage in isolating subvarnish organic matter starts with field sampling. The objective is to collect varnish that has colo- nized a rock surface reworked by cultural or geomorphic processes. The procedure used is based on fourteen years of error and retrial. As with most dating methods, collecting the wrong type of sample produces an incorrect age. The types of samples that produce incor- rect ages are elaborated elsewhere (e.g., Dorn 1989; Dorn et al. 1989, 1992; Krinsley et al. 1990). We present insights on three of the most common mistakes made in order to illustrate the ease with which errors can crop up in the collection stage. First, any spot of varnish will not do. Micropositions where varnish starts to grow first were determined by studies of his- torical rock engravings and stones faced dur- ing historical construction. Colonization occurs first in vesicles in basalt, impurities in chert, fractures in quartz and silicified dolom- ite, and grain boundaries in granitic rocks and sandstones. Second, the darkest and smoothest var- nishes should not be sampled. These are fre- quently varnishes that form on the sides of unexposed rock crevices (less than a millime- ter wide). This favorable environment for var- nish development often produces the best looking varnishes. These "crack varnishes" are then exposed to eyes of field workers by nat- ural rock spalling or when humans break rocks along natural joints. The important point is that determining the age of the crack varnish does not date the cultural or geomorphic pro- cess of interest, only when the organic matter fell into the rock fracture. For example, crack varnish collected from a still unexposed frac- ture (less than a millimeter wide) on the west face of Ayers Rock, Australia has an AMS 14C age of 27,100 ? 400 yr B.P. (Beta 19893; ETH 2809) for subvarnish organic matter. (Radio- carbon years before present is abbreviated yr B.P.) Third, varnish deposition must not be inter- rupted by mechanical or biogeochemical ero- sion. Before a sample is processed for varnish radiocarbon dating, multiple cross-sections are examined to ensure that the type of var- nish that is dated is evenly layered (Fig. 2a, b). Samples with discontinuous layering (Fig. 2c, d) are not processed. Discontinuities can be produced, for example, by organisms that bore holes into the varnish. These hollows are then filled in with much younger material, leading to inaccurate ages, as shown in prior tests (Dorn 1989; Dorn et al. 1989). Other</page><page sequence="5">140 Dorn et al. a~~~~~~~~~~~ Figure 2. Cross-sections of continous and discontinuous layers in rock varnish illustrated by backscatter electron microscopy. Figure 2b from petroglyph- WH5 (Fig. 4g) and Figure 2a from the desert pavement adjacent to Nazca geoglyph T3 (Fig. 4c) illustrate evenly layered varnishes that are appropriate for dating. Figures 2c from the Panaramatee North petroglyph site (Fig. 3) and 2.d from Death Valley illustrate discontinuous layering (arrows) that is inappropriate for dating. Lines indicate the varnish-rock boundary. Scale bars in microns . cross-sectional characteristics that would dis- qualify a sample for further processing are explored in detail elsewhere (Dorn 1989; Krin- sley et al. 1990; Dorn et al. 1992). The second stage of sample preparation is selecting the organic microinclusions. The top layer of the varnish is abraded away with a tungsten-carbide needle. This is to remove organics on the surface of the varnish. Then, the needle is used like a micro-bulldozer to turn over the varnish. Sifting through this material under 45x magnification, we find fragments of organic matter still attached to the underlying rock (Fig. 1f, g). Attachment to the underlying rock is important, because the objective in sampling is to pick out mate- rial that accreted to the rock surface soon after it was exposed. The exact process by which the organic matter attaches to the underlying rock is still under investigation. Organic matter is distinguished from inor- ganic varnish by several criteria: a nonplaty</page><page sequence="6">Radiocarbon Dating of Rock Varnish 141 morphology, a spongy feel when touched with a fine tweezer or a tendency to disintegrate when pressed, or a whitish edge when bro- ken. After organic-looking fragments are mechanically picked with a fine tweezer (Fig. 1c), there is typically only enough organic mat- ter for an AMS radiocarbon measurement in about one-fourth of the samples thus far col- lected for dating. An important concern in sampling is con- tamination of younger organic matter. Although the top layer of the varnish is first removed, and although organic matter is rarely found in the middle of varnish, it is impossible to rule out the inadvertent inclu- sion of young carbon. Radiocarbon dates on varnish organic matter must be interpreted as minimum ages. The long-term solution to this problem is the in situ extraction of subvarnish organic fragments with focused lasers. Third, after microinclusions are isolated, the collection of organic fragments attached to rock is then treated with 20 percent HCI to remove carbonate and concentrated HF to remove loose organics adsorbed to clays. If samples in the terrestrial weathering environ- ment that contain clays are not treated with HF, organic molecules loosely adsorbed onto the clay minerals can contaminate a sample and produce too young an age (Dorn et al. 1989; Gillespie 1991). Last, the sample is submitted for AMS 14C measurement (see review by Linick et al. 1989). Cultural and Physical Geography Results The remainder of this paper illustrates case studies of radiocarbon dating subvarnish organic fragments. Examples from first cultural and then physical geography are selected to highlight different methodological concerns related to working with different types of material. The order of presentation of cultural material is based on difficulty of sample prep- aration and concomitantly confidence in the results. Petroglyphs are a less complicated sys- tem than artifacts and pukios, and geoglyphs are the most difficult type of cultural remains to date with this method. South Australia Petroglyphs Petroglyph samples are particularly good to work with for a variety of reasons. Grooves abraded and pecked by artists are adjacent to well-varnished natural surfaces that provide a pool of bacteria to quickly colonize the newly exposed engraving. Petroglyphs are readily distinguished from natural weathering. They are also characterized by minor depressions appropriate for the collection of organic mat- ter that is subsequently encapsulated by rock varnish. Confidence in varnish dating of petro- glyphs is also boosted by successful blind tests (Loendorf 1991). Petroglyphs from South Australia that had been previously cation-ratio dated (Dorn et al. 1988) were resampled in the summer of 1990 to assess the feasibility of collecting subvar- nish organic matter. Out of 115 petroglyphs examined, twenty-six petroglyphs had suffi- cient organic matter for AMS radiocarbon dat- ing. Sufficient funds were available to date seven of these.

It is quite possible that WH5 was engraved earlier, since this age is close to the upper limit of the radiocarbon method. Further, this petroglyph was one of the very few places where younger organic matter was found between the varnish surface and the rock interface (Fig. 1j). If only one percent 14C were inadvertently included in the sample, a truly "dead" sample would give a finite 14C age of about 36,000 yr B.P. Our minimum radiocarbon ages from 30,000 to 36,000 yr B.P. are consistent with the migra- tion of humans into Greater Australia about 50,000 yr B.P. (Roberts et al. 1990). However, WH5 at 36,000 yr B.P., along with K23 at 30,000 yr G.P. and K26 at 31,000 yr B.P., reveal that humans have occupied what is at present the "arid zone" of Australia at least 10,000 years earlier than previously thought (Smith 1987). Unlike the other petroglyphs, with a close correspondence between the prior cation- ratio age and the new radiocarbon measure- ment, engraving K15 has a cation-ratio age about half the 14C age (Fig. 4f; Table 1). Unlike the other varnishes radiocarbon dated, a layer of amorphous silica (e.g., Curtiss et al. 1985; Watchman 1990) interfingers with the varnish on petroglyph K15 (Fig. 1i). This may be anal- ogous to the varnish/silica interdigitation described in Butzer et al. (1979). In order to assess the influence of amor- phous silica, leaching experiments were con- ducted on two groups of scrapings of natural Australian varnishes collected from the same cliff surface at Yunta Springs, South Australia (Fig. 3). One subgroup had abundant silica skins, like K15. The other subgroup had little development silica skins. Three subsamples of 200 mg of scrapings from each group were placed in 200 ml of distilled water at 250 C. They were agitated four times a day for three weeks; water was allowed to evaporate to 20 ml to concentrate cations, and then decanted and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma. The water leached from the varnish subgroup with abundant silica skins had 30- 45 percent less Ca and K in solution than the water leached from varnish without silica skins. In cation-ratio dating, the (K++Ca2+)/ Ti4+ ratio declines with the age of the rock varnish, as more mobile cations like potassium (K) and calcium (Ca) are leached preferentially to titanium (Ti) (Dorn 1989; Dorn et al. 1992). One interpretation of this experiment and for the anomalously younger cation-ratio age for K15 is that coatings of amorphous silica help reduce rates of cation leaching. This case study highlights a major advantage of radio- carbon over chemical dating methods. Chem- ical reactions are subject to environmental var- iables other than time that must be controlled, in this case the presence of silica skins. Mojave Desert Artifacts Rock varnish forms on flake scars of artifacts dropped on desert pavements (Hayden 1976). Artifacts were collected from the Manix Basin of the Mojave Desert (Fig. 5), the same area of the Mojave Desert where artifacts were obtained for an earlier study involving cation- ratio dating of lithic artifacts at quarry work- shops (Bamforth and Dorn 1988). Artifacts were collected from desert pavements on the surface of an eroded alluvial fan, above the shoreline of Pleistocene Lake Manix (Meek 1989). Of 53 artifacts collected, only three had sufficient subvarnish organic matter for AMS 14C dating, and one artifact had enough for two dates (Table 1; Fig. 4h).

(Meltzer 1989). The organic matter on artifact #12, a primarily flake that is completely coated with varnish in Fig- ure 4h, is over 26,000 yr B.P. Organic matter was analyzed from two different flake scars by two different laboratories on artifact #8 (Fig. 4h). The difference in age amounts to a little under 10 percent, and it probably relates to the way rock varnish grows. Some organic matter was encapsulated about 14,900 yr B.P. and then other material was varnished about 13,700 yr B.P. Since we treated the samples with HCI, older carbonate dust can be ruled out as a contamination. Crack varnish is not a complication, since the varnish was sampled from flake scars that were exposed when the artifact was worked. The simplest hypothesis is to view these pre-Clovis radiocarbon dates as minimum ages for the exposure of flake scars by humans. Pukios of Southern Peru Subterranean aqueducts, called pukios, are abundant in the Nazca region of southern Peru (Fig. 6; Schreiber and Lancho 1988), yet they have no age control. They are roughly similar to Old World qanats, bringing Andean ground water for irrigation in dryland floodplains. Schreiber and Lancho (1988) used archaeolog- ical inference to argue for manufacture during the Nasca cultural period, while Barnes and Fleming (1991) interpret historical information to argue for manufacture during the Spanish colonial period. (By convention "Nasca" refers to the prehistoric culture, whereas "Nazca" refers to the area.) There are wood posts in the pukios, but they are replaced periodically during maintenance and are hence not appro- priate to assess when the pukios were first built. Rock varnish was collected from meter-plus- long stone lintels making the roof of pukios at Cantalloc (e.g., Fig. 4d) and Orcona (Numbers 10 and 11 in Fig. 6). The texture of the rock varnish, as examined by backscatter scanning electron microscopy, is unlike any rock var- nish in the adjacent dryland environment. It is most similar to rock varnish found on cobbles in streams in tropical Queensland. This is con- PALA L. Z23,9 C %LFRALE I . .-''s. l 6 N A ZCA UADR\ Pacific 0 10 20 KM i At~~~~~~~~~AE Figure 6.

Furthermore, the varnish could not have started to form until after the roof stones were faced. According to J. Lancho- Rojas (1989), their size, shape, and the location of the lithologies they were quarried make the stone lintels reasonable candidates for prehis- toric emplacement. Like all varnish 14C ages, these must be considered minimum ages for the emplacement of the roof stones (Table 1). We conclude that at least some of the con- struction of the pukios of Nazca was com- pleted during or before early Nasca culture. These data are consistent with the interpreta- tion of Schreiber and Lancho (1988) for the Nazca pukios. Of course, it is possible that the construction of other subterranean aqueducts for the delivery of irrigation water could have occurred during the Spanish colonial period (Barnes and Fleming 1991).</page><page sequence="11">146 Dorn et al. Geoglyphs The Nazca geoglyphs of southern Peru (Fig. 4a-c, Fig. 6) were made by clearing darkly var- nished cobbles in desert pavements. This exposed to the atmosphere what was under- neath: lighter-colored silt and unvarnished cobbles. The exposure of the unvarnished cobbles started the varnish clock. This section describes our assumptions and experiments to assess the feasibility of using rock varnish to establish minimum ages for geoglyphs. Studies of desert pavements in North Amer- ica and Israel, after historical disturbance, have shown that partial regeneration of the pavement takes place in an initial pulse within a few years to a few decades (Lowdermilk and Sundling 1950; Sharon 1962; Cooke 1970; Bales and Pewe 1979; Eckert et al. 1979; Elvidge and Iverson 1983). Complete pavement regen- eration has not taken place in any of the stud- ied geoglyphs. This may be due to: the extreme aridity of the region slowing the pave- ment regeneration process; a shortage of sub- surface cobbles close enough to the surface to be thrust up by wetting and drying of clays in the soil (cf. Springer 1958; Cooke 1970); pedogenic calcrete or gypcrete cementing subsurface cobbles together; or perhaps because cobble upthrust is not responsible for pavement regeneration in the very arid Nazca region. Clasts now observed within a geoglyph may have four possible origins: (1) Subcentimeter- sized particles can blow into geoglyphs on the Nazca pavements. (2) Some cobbles are "inherited" from the previous natural desert pavement, either because they were left dur- ing manufacturing or washed in afterwards by overland flow. (3) Many pavement clasts were exposed at or near the time of geoglyph man- ufacturing. (4) Still other cobbles may have been exposed after geoglyph manufacturing by upthrusting, erosion of silt through defla- tion, overland flow, or human disturbance. (Geoglyph T2 seen in Fig. 4c was probably "swept" by M. Reiche; cobbles exposed by sweeping would not have developed enough varnish to sample.) A strategy was devised to sample subvarnish organic matter from only cobbles that belong to type (3), since the goal is to obtain the closest minimum age for geoglyph manufac- turing. Type (1) clasts are easily eliminated by sampling particles with the smallest axis &gt; 2cm and by sampling cobbles imbedded in the pavement (Fig. 4a). Type (2) clasts are readily eliminated if the cobble is of a rock type that varnishes well, because the inherited cobbles have a well-developed varnish. However, if the cobble is quartzite or another lithology that is slow to varnish, it can appear light in color with thick varnishes found only in grain boundaries and cracks. The remainder of the clasts have only patches of varnish and the task is to distin- guish which ones were exposed by geoglyph manufacturing or soon after. Rock varnish cation ratios were used to help preselect type (3) cobbles to be used in radiocarbon dating. Cation ratios are only used to establish a rel- ative age sequence. This is a conservative use of varnish cation-ratio dating, since six differ- ent varnish research groups have concluded that the cation ratio of (K+ + Ca2+)/Ti4+ decreases over time (see review in Dorn 1989). Over fifty cobbles (smallest axis &gt;2cm) with a spotted varnish appearance were sampled from nine Nazca geoglyphs of Peru (Fig. 4a-c; Fig. 6; Table 1). Some of the Nazca cobbles had partial crusts of pedogenic gypsum that are common in soils in the region (Noller 1990), indicating former burial. Flakes of rock varnish were scraped off each cobble, mounted in epoxy, polished, and analyzed for their cation ratio by wavelength dispersive electron microprobe. Fig. 7 presents ordered cation ratios from cobbles of five Nazca geoglyphs. Cobbles with lower cation ratios are felt to be "inherited" from the natural pavement, since lower cation ratios indicate greater antiquity. Cation ratios in the flat part of the curves in Fig. 7 are inter- preted to be those cobbles exposed during geoglyph manufacturing or soon after. Higher cation ratios are interpreted as cobbles exposed by gradual pavement reformation or perhaps human disturbance after geoglyph manufacturing. Cobbles with low cation ratios were not sampled for radiocarbon dating nor were cobbles with cation ratios higher than the plateau. Table 1 presents AMS 14C ages of subvarnish organic matter removed from underneath the varnish on cobbles in the flat part of the curves in Fig. 7; these are felt to best reflect cobbles exposed by geoglyph manufacturing.

Cobbles sampled from five Nazca geo- glyphs are ordered by their mean cation ratios [(K+ + Ca2+)/Ti4+], as determined by wavelength dispersive microprobe analyses on varnish scrap- ings. Cobbles are broken into three groups by the different cation ratios. Lower ratios indicate greater age, and these cobbles probably washed in and "inherited" their ratios from the adjacent natural pavement. Cobbles with cation ratios on the flat plateau probably were exposed by geoglyph man- ufacturing; these are the cobbles sampled for AMS 14C dating. The last group of cobbles are those with ratios higher than this plateau and probably repre- sent ongoing pavement regeneration or perhaps human disturbance after the geoglyphs were made. Error bars (-5-30 percent) for each cation ratio (based on standard errors of at least 8 electron microprobe measurements per cobble) are not pre- sented because it would make the graph unread- able. They are given in Table 1 for each geoglyph. and figures are presented in Table 1. They overlap with a conventional 14C date of 445- 605 A.D. on a wood post found where two linear geoglyphs intersected (Strong 1957, 46). Using ceramics left on top of and near the geoglyphs, Silverman (1990) also argued for manufacturing by Nasca culture during the Early Nasca phase of the Early Intermediate Period felt to be from 200 B.C. to A.D. 600. Our minimum ages are consistent with this interpretation, but we cannot rule out later (Clarkson 1990) or earlier episodes of geo- glyph manufacturing. Geoglyphs etched into desert pavements are also common in southwestern North America (e.g., Hayden 1976; Johnson 1986; von Werlhof 1987), but the lack of age control has inhibited placement in a cultural context established by stratigraphic studies. Cobbles from geoglyphs along Colorado River north of Blythe, California (Fig. 5), were sampled and preselected with cation ratios, as with the Nazca geoglyphs. Enough organic matter for a 4C age was obtained from three geoglyphs (e.g., Fig. 4e). These minimum ages indicate that at least one period of geoglyph manufac- ture took place along the Colorado River before about 1100 yr B.P. (Table 1). It took place in widely separated parts of the New World during a roughly similar time period. Alluvial Fan in Peru An alluvial fan near the Nazca geoglyphs of southern Peru, Ingenio-1, exemplifies how the new method of varnish radiocarbon dating can be used to constrain ages of desert landforms. The Ingenio-1 fan exits a small drainage basin (-0.9 kiM2) in the Cerro del Fraile range south of the town of Ingenio (Fig. 6). The top of the basin crests at about 900 m and the apex of the fan is about 450 m. The vegetation cover is at present negligible, confined to a few iso- lated herbs and desert shrubs in active que- bradas. Ingenio-1 fan is built onto the surface of Pampa San Jose, the desert pavement that composes the blackboard of the Nasca geo- glyphs. Ingenio-1 fan faces west. The drainage basin is at a low elevation in the rainshadow of the Andes Mountains. Most of the current rainfall comes from the east during the sum- mer. Extreme rainfall events are required to generate debris-flow deposits (Hooke 1987) that are found in abundance on the fan (Fig. 8). The radiocarbon dating of organic matter encapsulated by rock varnish on the Ingenio- 1 fan indicates alluvial-units range in age from before -21-22,000 yr B.P. to surfaces that lack Nasca-age pottery (Fig. 8). El Niho-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events are known to produce a great increase in annual precipitation totals along the north coast of Peru (Caviedes 1984), leading to flood- ing (Wells 1987). ENSO events that move in from the west would be effective in mobilizing sediments from the west-facing Ingenio-1 watershed, but statistical analyses of ENSO events indicate increased precipitation in northern Peru is associated with concomitant aridity in southern Peru (Tapley and Waylen 1989). The existence of the debris-flow and</page><page sequence="13">148 Dorn et al. 14 ~~~Alluvial a N- 14~~~~C Date Unit 21.4 ka 1 Figure 8. Oblique aerial photo and corresponding generalized map of Ingenio-1 alluvial fan. Ages are based on single varnish radiocarbon dates from the indicated sampling sites (Table 1). While older units have Nasca pottery, the post-Nasca age for unit 5 is indicated by the lack of Nasca-style pottery observed on the surface. There was also no Nasca pottery found in the "active" channel that was mapped by the presence of withered vegetation. braided-stream deposits on Ingenio-1 demand a mechanism to produce intense precipitation. Others have speculated that comparatively harsh and long-lasting "super El Niho" events could have influenced the south coast of Peru (cf. Morner 1987; McCaffrey et al. 1990). This would fit with the pattern of El Niio currents starting in the north and moving southward (Zuta et al. 1976). Another possible explana- tion for the Ingenio-1 deposit could potentially involve a more northerly penetration of cold- season precipitation associated with ENSO events (Cerveny et al. 1987). Regardless of which climatic mechanism produced the Ingenio-1 fan deposits, the sed- iment was mobilized by high magnitude-low frequency, extreme climatic events in a region that is characterized as hyperarid by all water balance and climate classifications. This region would also be characterized as hyperarid in a regional paleoclimate record. It follows that attempts to correlate alluvial-fan deposits with regional paleoclimatic records can be prob- lematic, since high-magnitude, low-frequency events can produce extensive alluvial-fan mor- phostratigraphic units. Conclusions With the observation that microinclusions of organic matter are present over or under, but rarely within rock varnish, it is now possible to date organic fragments under rock varnish, instead of organic matter that has been chem-</page><page sequence="14">Radiocarbon Dating of Rock Varnish 149 ically concentrated from a bulk sample in a bottom layer. These AMS 14C measurements provide minimum ages for surface archaeolog- ical material and desert landforms that had no previous age control. This advance is analo- gous to recent changes in dating lake sedi- ments; instead of obtaining ages on bulk organics, the pollen grains that are used by palynologists for paleoclimatic interpretation of lake cores can also be used for radiocarbon dating (Brown et al. 1989). This new approach, requiring a tenth the time of the previous technique of scraping to the lowest layer of varnish, is a necessary step towards in situ extraction of organic matter in rock varnish. The next advance will be to use lasers to extract organic inclusions from cross- sections, much like lasers are now used in micron-scale stable carbon isotope analyses of carbonate (Dickson et al. 1990). Pilot results of this new technique illustrate its potential. Three rock engravings from South Australia are older than 30,000 yr B.P.; one is older than 36,000 yr B.P. These are among the oldest known rock art in the world, and they indicate that what is now the arid zone of Australia was inhabited at least 10,000 years earlier than previously thought. These radiocarbon dates are consistent with all but one previously published cation-ratio age; this deviation may be explained by interbedded silica skins that lower rates of cation leaching. Rock varnish radiocarbon dates provide the first direct minimum ages for the Nazca geo- glyphs. The ages suggest construction during the early Nasca culture (-200 B.C. to 600 A.D.) during the rise of the archaeological site of Cahuachi and during the construction of sub- terranean irrigation aqueducts called pukios. Out of dozens of Mojave Desert artifacts examined, we obtained enough subvarnish organics for four radiocarbon ages on three different artifacts. Three of these ages are before the 12,000 yr B.P. "Clovis" migration into the New World. Alluvial-fan deposits and other desert landforms, even in hyperarid regions, are amenable to radiocarbon age con- trol by the dating of subvarnish organic matter. A speculative interpretation of the first age control on alluvial fans in southern Peru is that paleo-ENSO events may be recorded by sedi- ment mobilization from low-lying desert mountain ranges.
