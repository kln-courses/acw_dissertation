<plain_text><page sequence="1">EVIDENCE FOR THE PROTECTIVE VALUE OF CHANGEABLE COLORATION IN FISHES DR. FRANCIS B. SUMNER SCRIPPS INSTITUTION OF OCEANOGRAPHY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FoR reasons which are not difficult to see, the related subjects of protective coloration and mimicry have played a prominent part in biological history since the days of Darwin and Wallace. For equally obvious rea- sonls, we frequently find these topics looked upon with suspicion by some of our more critical recent biologists. MIuch of the literature in this field is merely descriptive. Examples of these phenomena are described in detail, no evidence for the prevailing biological interpretation be- ing regarded as necessary. In the course of such studies, many striking and indeed startling resemblances have doubtless been brought to light. On the other hand, much unbridled speculation has been indulged in. Not infre- quently, high significance has been attached to what are with little doubt purely accidental correspondences. And again, animals which would seem to be conspicuously colored in any possible natural environment are offered to us as being, in reality, fine examples of concealing coloration. The dogma has even been promulgated that the colors of all animals are of concealing value, if viewed under conditions where concealment is necessary. Thus, Abbott Thayer paints his flamingoes against a lurid sun- set sky, while he so poses a peacock that we view its green tail feathers against a background of foliage, while the head and neck are seen against a conveniently handy patch of blue sky (Thayer, 1909).1 It is hardly surpris- ing that some biologists have indignantly repudiated the whole notion of protective coloration. There is, however, a considerable literature dealing with experimental tests of the protective value of animal coloration. The results of such experiments, conducted 1 'e must not, on this account, overlook the high value of some of Thayer 's demonstrations of the optical principles underlying concealment. 245</page><page sequence="2">246 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. LXIX chiefly upon insects, have not been at all in accord with one another. So far as they have dealt with the value of supposedly "warning" coloration, they are not relevant to the subject-matter of the present paper. And, indeed, scarcely any of them have been concerned with the phe- iiomena of adaptive color change, which is my present topic of discussion. It is well known that whereas most concealingly colored animals display a fixed color scheme which is adjusted to some more usual habitat of the organism ("fixed homo- chromy "), many are endowed with the faculty of chang- inog their colors and bringing them into conformity with different surroundings ("changeable homochromy"). It happens that the voluminous literature dealing with the functional value of homochromy relates almost en- tirely to the first of these categories, the fixed type. It seldom concerns itself with the functional value of changeable homochromy. It is true that the mechanism responsible for these color changes has been studied in- tensively for half a century and described in great detail. But the biological significance of this widely distributed mechanism has either been tacitly assumed, or has been made the subject of more or less academic discussions. I am aware of only one previous case in which the bio- logical utility of this mechanism has been subjected to experimental test. And yet the mechanism is in many cases a thing of such extraordinary complexity that we can not conceive of its being evolved independently in several distinct branches of the animal kingdom unless it rendered some highly im- portant functional service. It is the object of the present paper to consider the bio- logical significance of the chromatic function, particu- larly in one group of animals, the fishes. Before proceeding, it is well to recall that the effector organs (color-cells or chromatophores) responsible for these color changes in fishes are of several types. The most widely prevalent, and by far the most carefully studied, are the black chromatophores, the melanophores.</page><page sequence="3">No. 722] CHANGEABLE COLORATION IN FISHES 247 But there are also white chromatophores (guanophores), and at least two kinds of truly colored ones (xantho- phores and erythrophores). In all these the visible re- sponses to stimuli (or, at least, the rapid ones) result from the movements of the pigment granules within the cells. When, for example, the melanin granules i the melanophores are dispersed throughout the entire cell- bodies the fish becomes dark; when they are concentrated into small specks at the center of each cell, the fish be- comes pale. Similarly with the colored chromatophores. We thus have both changes of color proper and changes of shade (from light to dark or vice versa). In reality, the changes of shade, resulting from the dispersion or concentration of melanin, are of more wide-spread occur- rence or, at least, are far more in evidence than changes of color sens stricto. Yet, owing to the poverty of our language, we seem condemned to class all these phe- nomena as "color change," and to speak of black and white " chromiatophores. " It is obvious that changes of shade may be perceived quite independently of any power of color vision. And since most of the "color" changes undergone by fishes are largely or wholly changes in shade, the ready argu- ment of the critic who challenges us to prove that the enemies of fishes have color vision may be ignored. To proceed, then, with our interpretation of the bio- logical significance of "color change " in fishes. As will appear in the ensuing pages, my own interpretation is the obvious, indeed the " orthodox" one, namely, that the primary object of these changes is concealment, either from the animals' predaceous enemies or from their own prey. In support of this contention (at least as regards escape from predators), I am submitting a body of ex- perimental evidence recently obtained by me. Before doing so, however, it may be worth while to consider some of the objections which have been raised against the concealing coloration hypothesis in general,2 2 I.e., the hypothesis that concealment is the real ''object" of this func- tion, not merely an incidental result.</page><page sequence="4">948 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. LXIX and some of the alternative hypotheses w-hich have been offered in its place. 'Most of these objections were origi- nally applied, to be sure, to cases of fixed homiochromry. But, if true, they would equally affect our interpretation of changeable homochromy. Some of these objections may have a limited, though by no means a general, appli- cation. Others seemi altogether frivolous. (1) The resemblances are the result of chance coinei- dence. With animals displaying such an endless variety of color and form, it would be surprising if resemblances lo surroundings objects did not occasionally occur. One would hardly dispute the occasional validity of this con- tention. Doubtless, some of the supposed cases of 4''pro- tective resemblance'" are purely accidental and of no value to the animals concerned. However, we may cite cases where a considerable part of the entire fauna of a given habitat (e.g., the Sargassumn) has taken on the color scheme of the latter. Mlany cases are also known in which detailed resemblances in both form and mark- ings have been adopted. (2) The very fact last mentioned, i.e., the occurrence of such extraordinarily detailed correspondences, has been cited as an argument against their protective sig- nificance. The camouflage would seem to have been over- done. A bird or other predator would be misled by much less of a disguise. However, we do not know enough about the visual discrimination of predators to make such sweeping assertions. Some experimenters, indeed, have found that birds are able to see through some disguises, and have concluded accordingly that these afford no pro- tection at all (Cuenot, 1911). As regards those extraor- dinarily detailed disguises, which fill us with such amaze- ment, the only alternatives to the conventional hypothe- sis of "protective resemblance" would seem to impose a far greater burden upon our imagination. I can only think of three: "chance" coincidence, special creation or the- assumption of some incredible propensity on the part of organisms to copy what they see about them.</page><page sequence="5">No. 722] CHANGEABLE COLORATION IN FISHES 249 Does it not strain our credulity less to believe that the predator in question is so sharp-sighted that a less com- plete disguise on the part of its prey would be insuffi- cient? (We may, of course, suit this argument to the dis- guise of the predator from its prey.) (3) Direct physical or chemical causes may be assigned in many cases for homochromy, without appeal to the need for protective coloration. For example, many ani- mals obtain their pigments directly from the plants or animals on which they feed. Granted, but the fact is not especially relevant. One of the miost extreme exploiters of the protective coloration idea (Poulton) was among the first to point out the direct derivation of pigments from food. (4) Animals which are well concealed on certain back- grounds do not restrict themselves to these backgrounds. Why should we expect them to ? No adaptation, morpho- logical or physiological, is ever perfect. (5) If homochromy is so important, why do not all ani- mals display it? And why do animals which are not con- cealed seem to fare as well as those which are? One would need to consider each case upon its merits. Dif- ferent animals have very different enemies and very dif- ferent conditions of life. Homochromy is only one of many adaptations favoring survival. (6) Predacious animals are actually known to eat many supposedly protected forms. This argument, which is merely another aspect of the last, has recently been made much of by McAtee (1932), who bases his beliefs upon an examination of the stomach contents of many thousands of birds. He concludes that "availability un- doubtedly is the chief factor involved in the choice of food, and predation therefore tends to be in proportion to population" (i.e., the population of each group of food organisms present in any given locality). " Considering bird predation alone this principle leads to a high degree of indiscriminacy in attack upon the whole kingdom of animal life. . . And this is only another way of saying</page><page sequence="6">250, n THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. LXIX that the phenomena classed by theorists as protective adaptations have little or no effectiveness." McAtee 's argument, which he seems to apply to all supposedly pro- tective adaptations whatever, has been criticized by a number of recent writers.3 Were he content with the first rather general assertion quoted above, it is likely that few would dissent from his position. But the last sentence appears to be distinctly a non sequitur. Granted that availability is an important, or even the chief factor, in the acquisition of food, there remains the likelihood of a certain amount of selection on other grounds. And con- tinued selection, even if statistically of low intensity, may achieve very considerable results. That, in reality, birds do select the more conspicuous individuals among fishes which are equally "available" in the spatial sense is shown conclusively by my own recent experiments. (7) Many animals do not have color vision. This argu- ment has already been referred to. Many animals are now known which do have color vision, including some which had been supposed to lack it. In any event, this argument does not apply to cases of conformity in shade (i.e., paleness or darkness), which is even more familiar than conformity in color, properly speaking. (8) The whole theory of "protective coloration" is "anthropomorphic," "teleological," "finalistic" and not really an explanation at all.4 Were it not that several biologists of prominence have been emphatic in making, and reiterating, assertions of this sort, it would hardly seem necessary to refer to them. Such methods of argu- mentation would seem to belong rather to political oratory than to sober scientific discussion. Scientific theories are seldom demolished by the use of epithets. "Just why it is unscientific or anthropomorphic to hold that a black animal against a black background is less likely to be eaten by a bird or a fish than if it were white, or that its present capacity for self-concealment has re- 3 Poulton, Huxley, Nicholson, Cott (all 1932); Benson (1933). 4 Cf.

We do not commonly attach any teleological significance to the operations of a sieve! The only question for the scientist to decide is whether such a sieve exists. In the present case, we have abundant evidence that it does. Restricting ourselves henceforth to changeable homo- chromy-to the adjustments of animals to the colors or shades of a varying environmient-I am aware of only two alternatives to the "protective coloration" hypothe- sis which have been offered. Neither of these can have, at best, more than a very limited application. (1) Cuenot's "antispectral" hypothesis (Cuenot, 1.927), which he himself has only applied to certain shrimps that dwell among variously colored sea-weed and adjust their colors to those of the weed. These shrimps are negatively phototropic, from which Cuenot concludes that they are unfavorably affected by light. His ex- planatioh is rather ingenious. An individual dwelling in green sea-weed, for example, receives upon its surface chiefly green light, transmitted or reflected by the plant. In order to exclude this light from the body, the integu- ment of the animal likewise turns green, thus reflecting at the surface those wave-lengths which succeeded in passing through the green filter. Query: would it not have been much simpler for the shrimp to acquire an opaque integument? (2) The hypothesis, originating with Max Weber, that some, at least, of the color changes of animals enable them to absorb or reflect heat-rays. This zoologist pointed out that in vertebrates chromatophores are chiefly found among poikilotherms. Thus far, I have made no reference to the occurrence of color changes other than those called forth by the background. It is well known that such changes are induced by a consider- able variety of stimuli, both chemical and physical. Thus certain amphibia and reptiles are known to become 5 Sumner, 1934, p. 77.</page><page sequence="8">252 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. LXIX dark when their temperature falls below a certain level, becoming pale again when this temperature is reached or exceeded. Such a. mechanism would be useful in enabling the animal to absorb the sun's rays when needed and to reflect them when they might be harmful. Fuchs (1913, 1914) has adopted this hypothesis and attempted to apply it to all animals capable of color change by means of chromatophores. (May we not apply to these the term "poikilochromic?"). He is not content to explain in this way the known color responses of various land animals to temperature. Here, there would seem to be an actual, though limited, application of the hypothesis.6 But Fuchs endeavors to extend this explanation to those color changes which bring the ani- mal into conformity with its background. A dark animal on a pale background, he claims, would tend to become overheated; while a pale one on a dark background would have heat drawn away from it. Passing by the improbability of this contention, for which no evidence is offered, it has already been pointed out by Bauer (1914) and Buddenbrockk (1928) that a fish, under water, could not accumulate an appreciable amount of solar radiation by turning black. And yet, in spite of these fundamental difficulties, Fuchs offered his hypoth- esis as being " purely physiological," instead of " anthro- pomorphic" ! Finally, we must remember that no such theory can explain the adaptive changes of pattern, which are dis- played in a marvelous manner by certain bottom-dwelling fishes. These changes can have no other object than con- cealment. Though described in detail more than twenty years ago (Sumner, 1911; Mast, 1916), these phenomena have been persistently overlooked by the opponents of the protective coloration hypothesis. This whole situation is decidedly one in which experi- mentation is called for. Although numerous experi- ments have been performed to test the protective value 6 Redfield (1918) has described a striking case of this sort in the "horned toad " (Phrynosomna).</page><page sequence="9">No. 722] CHANGEABLE COLORATION IN FISHES 253 of fixed homochromy (chiefly on' insects), I know of but one previous case in which the animals concerned were ones having the power of color change. Cuenot (1927) performed an apparently quite limited number of experiments in which certain shrimps were exposed in aquaria to the attacks of fishes. The shrimps were species whose colors were ordinarily closely ad- justed to the particular sea-weeds on which they hap- pened to be or to the bottoms on which they lay. Cuenot placed them, either living or dead (pinned), partly upon sea-weeds of their own color, partly upon ones of con- trasting colors, partly upon sand.7 Some specimens of a transparent species were injected with intra-vitam stains. From these tests Cuenot concludes that a fish is as likely to catch and devour a shrimp which is not adjusted to its background as one which is. He believes that, regardless of color, these crustacea are protected from fishes so long as they remain motionless. As soon as they move, they are likely to be pursued and caught. The data which Cuenot offers are in no sense statisti- cal. It seems quite doubtful from his account of the experiments whether a moderate degree of selection, such as appears, for example, in the first half of my Table 1, would have been detected. In my own experiments small fishes were employed as prey. The species used was in every case the familiar mosquito fish (Ganbusia patruelis (Baird and Girard)). Previous to the experiments, the fishes had been "con- ditioned" by keeping them for some weeks (31 to 58 days) in large laboratory tanks, the inner surfaces of which had been painted black and white, respectively. It is now known that a prolonged sojourn under these conditions results in a great increase in melanin pigment, in the one case, and a corresponding loss in the other When fishes of these contrasting histories are placed 7 The species chiefly used was one in which the power of color change is largely restricted to its earlier life. But the animals, when left to them- selves, more frequently seek out weeds of their own color. 8 Cf. Sumner and Wells (1933).</page><page sequence="10">254 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL.

But the two lots remain distinguishable for some days (Figs. 1 to 4). w~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ FIG. 1.

For the purposes of these experiments, two large wooden tanks were constructed having internal dimeni-</page><page sequence="11">No. 722] CHANGEABLE COLORATION IN FISHES 255 sions of 15 X 8 X 3 feet, the last figure representing the depth. One of these tanks was painted black within, the other a very pale gray, somewhere between Ridgway's ''pale olive-gray" and "light olive-gray. '9 In the various experiments to be described, the two lots of fishes (black and white) were poured into a given tank, at the same time and in equal numbers. Up to that moment, each lot was kept in the black or white can in which it was transported from the laboratory. The fishes were admitted to the tanks, either simultaneously with the birds or before or after these, depending upon the experiment. At the conclusion of each test, the fishes were removed and counted. In all the later experiments a separate count was made of those which had been injured but not eaten. Care was taken to remove every fish from the tanks by use of nets or otherwise. The identification of the fishes as "blacks" or "whites," even after a sojourn of many hours in a common tank, presented little diffi- culty, though it frequently required time. For this pur- pose, black and white bowls were employed. Such few specimens as could not be identified with certainty at a glance could be distinguished beyond doubt by placing them upon a background other than that from which they had immediately been taken. A "black" fish, for ex- ample, taken from the pale tank, could be speedily re- stored to full black by transfer to a black bowl. A "white" fish, under these conditions, would remain con- spicuously ill-adjusted.10 Thus, with the exception of two specimens in Table 1, and, for special reasons, many of those in the experiment with black bass, no serious doubt was felt in any individual case. My own identifi- 9 This shade was chosen as being a closer approach to that of the ''white ' fishes than pure white would have been. The tanks were cleaned from time to time, and the bottoms kept free from falling leaves or other debris. That: of the gray tank became stained somewhat yellowish in places, but remained very pale. 10 Urethane also proved useful in some cases, as stated in my earlier re- port, but its use was found to be unnecessary.</page><page sequence="12">256 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. LXIX cations were confirmed by Dr. Wells on the occasions when he participated in making the counts. These experiments were conducted at the San Diego Zoological Gardens and their success would have been quite impossible without the cooperation of members of the staff of that institution. My acknowledgment and hearty thanks are due to Mrs. Belle J. Benchley, the director of the "Zoo," who placed these facilities at my disposal, and to Messrs. Karl Koch and Bayard Cihlar, who rendered important assistance throughout. I must also record the valuable help rendered by Dr. N. A. Wells, of the staff of the Scripps Institution, and by my son, Herbert Sumner, who participated in some of the experi- ments. To the officers of the Steinhart Aquarium of the California Academy of Sciences I am indebted for several thousand Gambusia, which were caught and brought to La Jolla on two occasions by Mr. W. R. Martin. The first experiments were conducted with the Gala- pagos penguin (Spheniscus mendiclus Sundevall). This bird was chosen, partly because of its availability, partly because of its keen appetite for fishes and complete indif- ference to the presence of observers. Two birds were used in each experiment, but the number of different in- dividuals used in the various tests was at least four and probably considerably more than this. The specimens in question were caught at the Galapagos Islands and had all been at the "Zoo" for at least a year. During that entire period, their diet had consisted of dead fish. They never had an opportunity to catch living ones. This fact did not, however, affect their prompt and successful pur- suit of the Gambussia. This bird catches its prey by swimming under water, using its diminutive wings as organs of propulsion. In our experiments, the presence of the fishes was appar- ently not detected until the bird's head was thrust below the surface of the water. After admission of the birds, pursuit of the prey commenced within a period ranging from a few seconds to several minutes. Thereafter, the</page><page sequence="13">No. 722] CHANGEABLE COLORATION IN FISHES 257 pursuit was fairly continuous, interrupted by the birds' coming up for air. The water wars kept from two to two and a half feet deep. The experiments were conducted when the sun was fairly high in the sky and the tanks, though shaded somewhat by trees, were well lighted. Table 1 itemizes the results for the penguin experi- ments.'1 It will be seen that 1,726 fishes were employed in this series, 1,056 in the pale tank, 670 in the black. Of these, 749, or about 43 per cent., were eaten by the birds. Almost identical percentages of the total number were eaten in the two tanks, although the average time allowed the birds was considerably greater in the pale tank. The significant fact is the very different proportion of "black'" and "'white'" fishes eaten in the two tanks. In the pale tank, 278 fishes, orf 61 peer cent. of those eaten, were "blacks," while 176, or 39 per cent., were "whites." In the black tank, on the contrary, only 78 fishes, or 26 per cent., were "blacks," while 217, or 74 per cent., were whites." Moreover, in every single instance, among the 11 experiments here comprised, the trend of the results for the same tank was the same. It is not surprising that the difference between the percentages of "blacks" and "whites" eaten (i.e., the intensity of the selection) was mauch greater in the black tank than in the pale one. To the human observer, the fishes of both classes in the pale tank were readily visible, though not equally conspicuous. In the black tank, the "black" fishes were scarcely visible at all, except when seen at short range, or in particularly favorable illumnina- tion. The "whites," on the other hand, could be readily seen from a considerable distance. But there is one phase of these results which was quite unexpected. In both of the tanks there is as much evi- dence of selection when the fishes had been left there for nearly or quite a day before the admission of the birds "1 These figures, with the exception of those for October 5 and 9, have already been published (Sumner, 1934a).</page><page sequence="14">258 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL.

Indeed, the percentages in the two cases are closely simi- lar, in the pale tank almost identical. From Figs. 2 and 4 it is evident that a considerable degree of approxima- tion in shade, on the part of the two lots of fishes, takes place in the course of 24 hours. However, it must be pointed out that the degree of visible difference among the prey can not be the only factor determining the in- tensity of selection in such cases as these. The keenness of sight, degree of hunger and other circumstances relat- ing to the predators must play an important part in the result. In the absence of any evidence, we may regard it as highly probable that the same individual birds, in the same state of hunger, would display an intensity of selection which would be higher in proportion to the visible difference among the fishes. The question whether there may not be differences in the relative activity of our two lots of fishes will be dis- cussed after the next series of experiments has been con- sidered. In only the later penguin experiments (18, 19, 20) was a careful count made of the fishes which were injured by the birds but not eaten. Since it was not always possible to detect slight injuries, the count was here restricted to fishes which bore unmistakable evidence of having been seized. In Table 1, the data from injured fishes are meager and niot even consistent. They will be found much more impressive when Table 2 is examined. In addition to a diving bird such as the penguin, it was thought desirable to employ one of the waders. For this purpose we used a night heron from Cocos Island (spe- cies undetermined). This bird was likewise chosen largely because of its availability,"2 but it proved to be an admirable performer. The specimen used had been in 12 It was found difficult to trap these birds in the large flying cage at the 'Zoo,) and we consequently contented ourselves with this single very satis- factory specimen.</page><page sequence="16">260 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. LXIX captivity at San Diego for three or more years, during which time it never had access to living fish. As is well known, the feeding habits of the wading birds are very different front those of the divers. The former stand in shallow water, moving about slowly from point to point in search of prey, but striking with great rapidity when a fish falls within range. The birds are relatively tall, and the fishes are seen from some distance above the water. In these experiments the depth of the water in the tanks was reduced to two or three inches. In view of the flying powers of the heron, it was necessary to cover each tank, when in use, by a roof of netting. The results of the heron experiments are presented in Table 2. This series yields as indubitable evidence as the earlier one fosr the selection of the more conspicuous fishes. The great differences in the numbers consumed in the several experiments seem to relate in part to the dura- tion of the latter, while the degree of discrimination may have depended upon the timle of day when most of the feeding was done. Thus, the three hours covered by experinment 13, in the pale tank, were in the middle of the day. No discrimination whatever is to be noted in the case of the few fishes which were eaten, though the num- bers of injured were 10 "blacks" to 6 "whites." In experiment 17, the fishes were placed in the same tank at dusk, and the survivors recovered rather early on the following morning. It is probable that most of the feed- ing was done during the twilight, if not actually during the night. This experiment yielded the greatest evidence of selection in the entire series. It may be significant that the next highest degree of selection was shown in experiment 16, in which the fishes were also introduced into the tank (this time the black one) late in the after- noon and were left through the night. It would be difficult to explain why the intensity of selection, as shown by the gross percentages, was no higher (indeed was actually slightly lower) in the black tank than in the pale one.

LXIX pointed out, the various experiments of this series are hardly comparable with one another, owing to the inequality of conditions in the different cases. Despite small numbers, the figures for injured fishes point in the same direction as those for the fishes which were eaten. Thus, for both the perygmins (divers) and the heron (a wader), we have conclusive statistical evidence for the predominant selection by the birds of those fishes which were least in htarmiony with their backgrounds. In the case of the penguins, the evidence for selection on this basis was equally decisive when the two lots of fishes had been kept together for a day upon a connmon background, and the original differences thus greatly reduced. It may be pointed out here that the restricted quarters in which these experiments were conducted would tend to make for a more indiscriminate capture of the fishes than would ordinarily occur in nature, since predators anil prey were forced into greater propinquity than would be likely in the open. This gives the positive results yielded by these tests an even higher significance. The possibility of another interpretation of these re- sults early suggested itself to us, as it may well have done to the reader. Might not the selective elimination of fishes of one shade be due not to differences of appear- ance but to differences in activity? I have already dis- cussed this possibility in l-zy preliminary report upon these experiments (Sumner, 1934a), and admitted the possibility that a higher degree of activity on the part of the "white" fishes may have been accountable in part for their lower rate of mortality in the pale tank. By the same token, however, the differential mortality in the black tank would be even more significant than the figures appear to show. I now know that I conceded altogether too much pos- sibility to this suggestion. It is true that in small aquaria in the laboratory "white " fishes in white aquaria are more active or "timid' than black fishes in</page><page sequence="19">No. 722] CHANGEABLE COLORATION IN FISHES 263 black aquaria. And it is likewise true that black fishes retain this lower degree of activity when transferred to a white container, even after the lapse of an hour or more. But these differences in activity gradually dis- appear and are probably not observable after 24 hours. The following facts would seem to dispose completely, however, of this interpretation of any aspect of our selec- tion results: (1) At the commencement of experiments 19 and 20, observations were made of the behavior of the fishes when poured into the pale tank. The "black" and ''white" lots promptly united into a single school and, until disturbed, swam together as a unit. I repeatedly tried the experiment of breaking up the school by dipping a long stick into its midst. Small detachments swam in every direction, but there was no preponderant tendency for the "white" fishes to be in the lead on such occasions. The two lots behaved exactly alike. (2) In experiments 18, 19 and 20, the fishes were intro- duced into the tanks nearly or quite a day before the birds were admitted. There was nevertheless equally conclusive evidence of selection. Thus, tt ts clear that lin neither tank has the differential mortality of the "black" and "white" fishes been due to differences bin their ability to outdistance their pursuers. In all these experiments, to be sure, the difference between the well-adjusted and the ill-adjusted lots of fishes on a given background was great enough to be visible or even conspicuous to the human eye. To what extent much less discernible differences in shade would be of survival value is a question upon which we have no evidence. But it seems quite probable that, considered statistically, even scarcely perceptible differences of this sort would be sufficient to affect mortality rates, were we concerned with sufficiently large populations. If this is true, it is probable that small differences in the rate or the extent of the capacity of these animals for color ad- justment would be of selective value, and therefore of evolutionary significance. Any one who has experi-</page><page sequence="20">264 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. LXIX niented in this field knows not only that different species of fishes, but different individuals of the same species, show marked differences in the perfection of this fune- tion. We thus have some of the essential conditions for the evolution of this mechanism through natural selec- tion. Another series of experiments (9-12) was attempted with a very different class of predators. Eight speci- mens of the fresh-water black-bass (M1icr-opterus salmoides)13 were used, four in each tank. These experi- ments were conducted under such unsatisfactory condi- tions that no detailed report upon them seems worth while. Owing to our allowing an insufficiently long period of "conditioning" for the Gambus'ia, and to the sickness and death of many specimens from overcrowd- ing during transit to the experimental tanks, later identi- fication of the "whites" and "blacks" was found to be impossible in many cases. The results, on the whole, are nearly valueless, and they certainly give no clear evi- dence of selection in relation to shade. Perhaps this was not to be expected in any case, for tlme reason that the bass almost invariably approached the ''mosquito-fish" from below, the latter commonly swimming at the sur- face while the bass were in the tank. It is planned to continue experiments in which fishes will be used as predators, since the chief enemies of many small species are probably the larger fishes. So far as these last may approach their prey from above, or even from the side, it is likely that homochromiie (cryptic) adjustments may at times be of vital importance.14 But experimental tests are called for. SUMMARY Small fishes (Gamnbusia patritelis) were kept in black and in white aquaria for some weeks, until their pigmen- 13 These I owe to the kindness of Mr. E. H.

Equal numbers of such fishes were placed together in one or another of two large wooden tanks, one black, the other nearly white. Here they were exposed to the attacks of fish-eating birds, including both a diving and a wading species. The number of fishes of each color (shade) which were eaten or injured were counted and tabulated (Tables I and 2). The resultA of these tests are indicated in the italicized passages on pages 257, 260, 262 and 263. It is concluded that the chromatic adjustments of fishes to their backgrounds mnay be of vital importance in pro- tecting them from predators, despite the circum stantial evidence and theoretical objections which have been offered in disproof of this conclusion.
