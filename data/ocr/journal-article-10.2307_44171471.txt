<plain_text><page sequence="1">Action and Image in Early Chinese Art Lothar von Falkenhausen On peut distinguer trois modes de représentations figuratives (figures humaines ou animalières) dans l'art de la Chine pré-impériale : hiératiques, ornementales et actives. Les découvertes de l'archéologie moderne montrent que ces trois modes existaient dès l'époque néolithique, mais on ne peut manquer d'observer, pendant certaines périodes et dans certaines régions, la prédominance de l'un ou de l'autre. Dans l'art exclusivement religieux de la Chine centrale, sous les Shang par exemple, c'est le mode hiératique qui prédomine, alors qu'à la périphérie du pays de culture Shang il en va dif- féremment. Les Zhou occidentaux héritent de ces préférences, mais le mode ornemental s'établit comme prédominant après ca. 850 av. J.-C. A partir de ce point d'articulation de l'histoire de l'art visuel chinois se développe très graduellement au sein de la tradition chinoise un art figuratif permettant la représentation de scènes d'action. En retraçant les précédents néolithiques de cette transformation, et ses parallèles dans les cultures voisines de celles des Shang et des Zhou, on peut démontrer que les innovations dans l'art visuel des Zhou orientaux ne sont nullement le résultat de « progrès » dans le domaine de la production artistique, mais la conséquence d'un affranchissement par rapport aux conventions visuelles antérieures, lié aux changements religieux et sociaux de l'époque. Three Modes of Figure Representation In the art of pre-Imperiai China, humans and animals are principally rendered in three distinct ways: hieratic, ornamentalized,1 or in action. In the hieratic mode of representation, they are depicted either fřontally or in full profile; their posture is invariably rigid and inert; and when several are present, no attempt is made to convey any interaction among them (Fig. la).2 When reduced to "pure ornament," their forms are stretched and twisted according to geometric principles into repeat- able units of surface-covering design (Fig. lb).3 Only relatively rarely are humans 1. Aside from recognizable animal bodies forming patterns, Shang and Zhou bronze art also comprises a canon of abstract ornaments, some of which are derived from animal parts; but such non-figural art is of no concern to the present article. 2. For examples, see the illustrations to Ladislav Kesner's article in this volume. Chinese and Korean ancestor portraits are a later instance of this mode of representation (see Ladislav Kesner, Jr., "Memory, Likeness and Identity in Chinese Ancestor Portraits," Bulletin of the National Gallery in Prague, 3-4 (1993-94), 3-15; Jan Stuart and Evelyn S. Rawski, Worshiping the Ancestors: Chinese Commemorative Portraits [Washington, D. C.: Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, 2001]). 3.

We shall here focus on early instances of this third mode of representation, which dif- fers from the two others in two essential respects: the figures - whether animals or humans - are, at least to some degree, animate; and they are situated, at least implicitly, within the flow of time (Fig. lc). The motifs represented in these three modes of representation - especially in the first two - are essentially the same: reptiles, mammals, birds, some insects Interlacery," Res , 10 (1985), 28-46.</page><page sequence="3">A CTiON and Image in Earl y Chinese Art 53</page><page sequence="4">54 Lothar von Falkenhausen and fish, and a relatively small number of humans, shown in manifold variations and combinations.4 What differs is the basic approach to their visual rendition, transcending any consideration of medium, genre,5 or style. Above all, the three modes of representation elicit very different cognitive responses. When one mode of representation is dominant in the art of a specific period or cultural tradition, it may be said to reflect the perceptual habits of makers and viewers. Only secondarily, albeit perhaps more obviously, do the differences between modes of representation also indicate differences in the conception of the iconographie content, function, and cultural significance of the figures represented. Specialists in Chinese art history are conditioned to consider these three modes in an evolutionary sequence. The hieratic mode is pervasive in the magnificent bronze art of the Shang and Western Zhou as well as its Neolithic predecessors; the ornamentalized mode is deemed characteristic chiefly for the Later Bronze Age, beginning in the ninth century BC with the rise of what mid-twentieth century art historians used to call the "Middle Zhou" style of bronze ornamentation; and for the earliest instances of figures shown in action, connoisseurs usually point to Late Eastern Zhou works of art such as the "pictorial bronzes" of the fifth century BC, which are often, and with good reason, interpreted as precursors of the more mature achievements of representational and narrative art during the Early Imperial epoch. This evolutionary sequence is, of course, supported by a large amount of evidence, and it provides a useful master narrative for conceptualizing artistic developments in the Shang and Zhou core area from ca. 3,000 BC down to the Qin unification. But it is by no means unassailable. In the first place, one should note that the three stages did not succeed one another in one straight line of progression. Although it can be shown that, during the tenth and ninth centuries BC, hieratic designs gradually morphed into "pure ornament," instances of hieratic rendering of figures are still occasionally seen during later periods. Moreover, the new forms of figures- in-action representation that arose about the middle of the first millennium BC do not seem to have any connection to the patterned surface ornamentation dominant until then, which remained ubiquitous side by side with them. Indeed, rendering figures in action remained a minority practice until the end of the pre-Imperial epoch. Three further problems must be raised. First, there is no immanent artistic or technological rationale for why figure representation should evolve through the three stages outlined above; in other words, hieratically represented figures do not forcibly devolve into pure ornament, nor does ornamental pattern necessańly engender, 4. The lack of floral imagery at the earliest stages of Chinese art history has aroused much puzzlement. For a compelling analysis of its earliest instances in the Warring States period, see Hayashi Minao "Chùgoku ni okeru hasunohana no shõchõ" &amp;f&amp;, Tõhõgakuhõ « Jsmm, 59 (1987), 1-61. 5. The issue of art genres in early Chinese art remains unexplored and must remain outside the concerns of the present article; whereas the genre distinctions seen in later Chinese art (such as calligraphy vs. painting, and within painting, landscape vs. bird-and-flower vs. portrait etc.) are obviously irrelevant to the pre-imperial epoch, one might argue for other kinds of genre-level distinctions, e.g., between ritual art, the art of personal ornamentation, and funerary art.</page><page sequence="5">Action and Image in Early Chinese Art 55 or encourage, the representation of figures in action. Indeed, the three-stage sequence observable in Shang and Zhou art, to the extent that it is real, is not paralleled elsewhere in the great civilizations of the ancient world - nor should it be expected to be. If such a sequence does apply to the case of pre-Imperial China, it should be seen as a marker of what made Chinese civilization unique during that specific historical epoch, and every effort should be made to reveal, as concretly as possible, the underlying rationales and mechanisms of change. Second, this article will adduce some evidence that calls into question the notion that the three modes of representation constituted new departures when they first appeared in the above sequence. To begin with, we shall see instances of all three modes of representation in various Neolithic contexts, preceding the rise to virtually exclusive prominence of hieratic representation. We shall also uncover an embryonic stage of the representation of figures in action that precedes the appear- ance of the pictorial bronzes by several centuries, coinciding more or less with the onset of "pure ornament." Thus it would be a mistake to interpret the three-stage sequence of modes of figurai representation as a way of tracing the evolution of the cognitive abilities of early Chinese artists and their public. To the contrary: the abilities required to produce figure representations in any of the three modes were all equally present from the outset, but not always actualized to the same extent. Third, we shall see that, during the time when hieratic representation reigned supreme in the core area of the Shang and Zhou dynasties - the Middle and Lower Yellow River Basin and adjacent areas - contemporaneous artists based in peripheral areas did quite regularly represent human and animal figures in action. Since the Shang and Zhou were by no means isolated from outside contact, it seems very likely that the artists and/or their patrons had some degree of awareness of the alternative modes of representation practiced in neighboring regions; and yet they evidently chose not to adopt them for themselves. This suggests that the ways in which animal and human figures are rendered in Shang and Zhou art reflect the active decisions of makers and/or patrons, underscoring the specificity and unique- ness of the Shang- Zhou tradition. Whether fully conscious or not, such culturally and historically specific decisions must have channeled artistic creativity into certain trajectories, closing off others. The nature and cultural conditioning of creativity in Chinese artistic practice is, of course, a subject of long-standing interest to Lothar Ledderose, to whom the following reflections on the rise and context of in-action representation of figures in early China are respectfully dedicated.6 6.

Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2000).</page><page sequence="6">56 Lothar von Falkenhausen Part I: Figures in Action vis-à-vis Hieratic Décor - Anyang versus Sanxingdui Let us begin with some brief remarks on hieratic representation in Early Bronze Age art. Its most famous exponent is the so-called taotie animal face ubiqui- tous on Shang and Early Western Zhou bronzes. In the §it'im'i-fanghu hJÇSÍI from the tomb of Fu Hao (Tomb 5 at Yinxu Anyang $#§, Henan &gt;5fSī) (Fig. la), for instance, large sheep-horned taotie appear on the lid (facing upward) and, versetzt (wrapped around the corners of the vessel), in the main ornamental zone.7 The face motif on the foot represents another, zoologically unidentifiable variant with vertical horns ending in a lateral hook,8 and with lateral extensions featuring an animal's front claws. In the ornamentation tier above the principal taotie faces - but, unlike them, placed in the vessels central axis of symmetry - we see another animal head with "bottle horns," executed three-dimensionally, with its spliced-up reptile body extending onto the flat surface of the vessel. The decoration of this fanghu additionally includes sitting birds in the four corners on the vessel's shoulder, plus a row of downard-facing cicadas below the rim. A total of 36 animals are represented on this vessel, all self-contained in rigid, motionless postures; the only somewhat dynamic element in the composition is the orienta- tion of some décor elements toward the corners, but this by no means undoes the strict symmetry of the vessel's four sides. I have no wish to expound here on the much-contested interpretation of the taotie , except to say that, since it appears on ritual vessels, it seems likely that any kind of meaning it carried must have been linked to Shang religious beliefs and practices.9 What does deserve emphasis is the relentlessness and ubiquity of this kind of décor, which the Shang and Early Western Zhou bronze-manufacturing artists pursued with astonishing single-mindedness. The omnipresence of the same motif throughout a visual environment - even if it comes in a variety of versions - conditions viewers to take the presence of that motif as natural and necessary, and to experience dislocation and disorientation when it is absent.10 The rigid gaze 7.

These horns are probably two-dimensional equivalents of the "bottle horns" seen in fully sculptural relief elsewhere on the same vessel. 9. For a useful categorization, see Hayashi Minao, In Shü fidai seidõki monyõ no kenkyû Sx (In Shū seidõki sõran Í£jÜ 2, Tõkyõ: Yoshikawa Kõbunkan a 1986), section 1, 17-90 and section 2, 3-141. For one useful religious interpretation of the taotie, see Kwang-chih Chang, Art, Myth and Ritual : The Path to Political Authority in Ancient China (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1983), 56-80; for the wider context of such interpretations, see Ladislav Kesner, "The Taotie Reconsidered: Meaning and Functions of the Shang Theriomorphic Imagery," Artibus Asiae, 51.1/2 (1991), 29-53. 10. This theme has been classically pursued, albeit in a very different context, by Paul Zanker, The Power of Images in the Age of Augustus (Thomas Spencer Jerome Lectures; Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1988).</page><page sequence="7">Action and Image in Early Chinese Art 57 of the taotie face - whatever it may have meant - lent itself to this kind of mental conditioning. A more "naturalistic," animal-based rendering, or scenes of figures in action, would merely distract from it. Here may well lie one rationale for the absence of figures represented in action in Shang and Western Zhou art. In great contrast to all other known early civilizations in both the Old and New Worlds, the Shang and Zhou core area is notable for the complete absence, down to the onset of the Imperial epoch, of any depiction of important human beings. Nor did the Shang and Zhou depict deities in anthropomorphic form. I have briefly addressed this apparent taboo elsewhere.11 There is no need here to indulge in speculation about the religious or political rationales behind it; I merely wish to note that the interdiction of making images of gods and kings probably did not exactly foster the representation of figures in action. Indeed, human faces and figures in Shang art, when they do appear, tend to have the same hieratic characteristics as the taotie ; the Heda -fangding^i^Sf^ excavated at Huangcai i®# in Ningxiang ^ (Hunan $0^0 but probably made in north China,12 presents one telling instance of human faces integrated into the structure (complete with small animal claws on the side) of the taotie design (Fig. 2). 13 Thanks to relatively recent archaeological discoveries, we have come to realize that the neighbors of the Shang and Zhou were not bound by these constraints on anthropomorphic depiction. This is evident, for instance, from the magnificent anthropomorphic bronze statuary found in two sacrificial pits at Sanxingdui £1 in Guanghan Kt/ļt (Sichuan IZ9Ji[). Interred about 1250 BC, these objects are more or less contemporaneous with the transition from the Erligang HURI to the 11.

Gao Zhixi, üjMlí, "Shang dai renmian fangding" Wenwu ~$CM, 1960.10, 57-58.1 have argued for the Anyang manufacture of this vessel at some detail elsewhere (Lothar von Falkenhausen, "Inconsequential Incomprehensions: Some Instances of Chinese Writing in Alien Contexts," Res, 35 [1999], 42-69, esp. pp. 53-54). Similarly, the only other instance of a prominent human face on a Shang bronze - a he Wi vessel in the Freer Gallery of Art that is unfortunately unprovenienced but said to have come from Anyang ( Zhongguo qingtongqi quanji ŤlWišIfí&amp;S 3, ShangM 3 [Beijing: Wenwu Chubanshe, 1997], 147-148]) - links the face to a serpent body and attaches the "bottle horns" characteristic of serpents to the forehead. 13. This fusion of human and animal (or emergence of a human from an animal body) is shown in a number of bronze artifacts from Shang and Zhou China. The most compelling example is on a pair of you â now separated between the Sen'oku Hakkokan in Kyoto (Umehara Sueji Shinshū Sen'oku Seishõ [Kyoto: Sen'oku Hakkokan, 1971], v. 1: 62-65, v. 2, pl. 63-64]) and the Musée Cernuschi in Paris (Vadime Elisseeff, Bronzes archaïques chinois au Musée Cernuschi , v. 1 [Paris: L'Asiathèque, 1977], 122-130).

We can only speculate about their original mode of placement, presum- ably in some sort of sacred space.16 In any case, their display must have conveyed meanings that were very different from those conveyed by the display of sacrificial vessels in metropolitan Shang ancestral temples;17 and the effect of their gaze on viewers at the time must have been very different from that of the taotie on Shang ritual art objects. Taken in isolation, these images with their rigidly symmetric, expressionless faces appear hardly less hieratic than taotie faces from Anyang; but their identity as autonomous pieces of sculpture - as opposed to being fused to the surface of a ritual vessel or some other useful object - enabled them to be placed in groups that might connote a scene or an event; potentially, thus, they could serve as props in the representation of a scene of action, and of a moment in time. An idea of how they might have been deployed can be obtained from the ensembles of smaller figures found in Pit 2 at Sanxingdui that the excavators have classified as "spirit shrines" and "spirit altars." On the least fragmentary specimen now preserved (Fig. 3d),18 we see human figures placed on two tiers, in conjunction with other imagery, in what seems to be a scene of worship. On the second tier, supported by a winged ungulate quadruped, we may see four fully sculptural standing figures, barefoot, wearing elaborate clothes decorated with whorl motifs and large protruding headdresses, each proffering an elaborate object of now-indeterminable shape - perhaps a bough, a torch, or a jade scepter. Above them, on the fourth tier, rows of smaller kneeling figures, four on each side, are set into rectangular frames. They are less elaborately dressed than the larger figures below them. Each has a braid of hair wound around its head. These figures, too, appear to have been clutching something with both hands, but the objects are no longer preserved. Although the individual figures in each group look very much alike, and they do not interact explicitly, each of them is shown performing an action - probably offering some kind of sacrificial item - within what seems to be a larger context of activity. Each group of figures may be interpreted as depicting some aspect or episode of the ceremony in which the "spirit altar" on which they appear was used. The location of each tier and the different sizes and postures of the figures may connote different ranks of worshippers and/ or different stages in the ritual process. The grouping and placement of the figures may relate to the choreography of the performance and hint at the spatial context,19 16. For some such speculations see Lothar von Falkenhausen, "Some Reflections on Sanxingdui," in Papers from the Third International Conference on Sinology, History Section: Regional Culture, Religion, and Arts Before the Seventh Century (Taipei: Institute of History and Philology, Academia Sinica, 2002), 59-97. 17.

Sanxingdui fisikeng, 227-238. This is only one of three such "spirit altars" from Pit 2 that was in good enough shape to allow reconstruction. 19. The barefootedness of the figures on the second tier may also hint at that context; as Jessica Rawson has pointed out in reference to the large standing figure in Fig. 3c, which is also</page><page sequence="13">Action and Image in Early Chinese Art 63 though one must also account for the need of the composition to conform to the overall shape of the "spirit altar," which, as Sun Hua J&amp;ljl has shown, was assimilated to the shape of sacrificial vessels of the zun If class.20 If the interpretation of the figured scenes on the "spirit altar" as a scene of ritual is correct, its depiction on an object used in that very performance would offer a significant semiotic parallel to the much later pictorial bronzes of Eastern Zhou (cf. Fig. lc). Even though many details of interpretation remain in the dark, the preceding discussion may suffice to bring out the fundamental contrast between the art of Sanxingdui and that of the Shang core area, not merely with respect to their icono- graphie contents, but, more fundamentally, with the modes of figure representation adopted. Not only were the Sanxingdui casters unaffected by the Shang taboo on anthropomorphic imagery, but it is also obvious that, unlike their metropolitan Shang colleagues, they were comfortable with representing figures - including, quite possibly, important figures - in action. Arguably, to Sanxingdui artists, depicting important figures and showing figures in action were not two distinct and separable aspects of their activity, but constituted part of their long-established artistic habitus. To their contemporaries in the Shang core, for reasons we can no longer fathom, this seems to have been anathema. Neolithic Instances of Figures In Action The representation of figures in action can be traced back to even earlier stages in the art history of continental East Asia. One much-discussed instance appears in the decoration of a Late Neolithic painted-pottery bowl found in 1973 in a tomb at Shangsunjiazhai in Datong (Qinghai #}§) (Fig. 4a).21 The vessel is dated to the Majiayao Phase (3000-2700 BC) in the sequence of painted- pottery producing cultures of the Upper Yellow River Basin and the Gansu Corridor. While the outside features a simple linear design, the décor around the inside of the rim shows three groups of human figures framed by a thrice-repeated abstract motif. The figures are shown as black silhouettes on yellow ground. Each group consists of five figures holding hands, with the two legs seemingly in movement. The facial features are undefined, but attached to the right side of the head of each figure is a downward stroke, perhaps indicating a hair braid; another, diagonal protrusion on the left near the legs has been variously interpreted as a twirling loin cloth, a pendant belt accessory, an animal tail that was part of a costume, or an erect male barefoot, this may indicate that they are "represented as being in a temple or palace building where shoes were not worn" (. Mysteries of Ancient China , 62). 20. Sun Hua, "The Zhuwajie Bronzes," Journal of East Asian Archaeology, 5.1-4 (2003), 277-336, especially 289-290. 2 1 .

An overall sense of swaying movement is further underscored by the large diagonal element that dominates the abstract motif between the three groups of figures. What is important for our purposes here is that the five figures in each group - as well as, possibly, the three groups in their totality - constitute a coherent composition, which ever since the discovery of the bowl has been unanimously interpreted as a scene of dance.23 Similarly, on a bowl excavated in 1995 from Tomb 157 at Zongri tkB in Tongde [ôIÍS (Qinghai) (Fig. 4b), we see two groups of figures holding hands, one compris- ing eleven and the other thirteen figures.24 Their lower bellies are rendered as large round dots, contrasting with the stick- figure like appearance of the limbs and upper bodies. The legs are not separated, and no diagonal lines stick out from the bodies (perhaps in this instance the figures represent females?), resulting in a somewhat more static impression than in the case of the Shangsunjiazhai bowl. Nevertheless, this composition, as well, has been interpreted as a dance scene.25 Such pictorial renditions of human figures in action are rare in the ceramic art of the Majiayao Phase.26 Yet there is some demonstrable connection between 22. With the loosening of Stalinist morals in Mainland China, the interpretation of this part of the design in scholarly publications has become ever bolder; its interpretation as a means of sexual differentiation was first proposed by the late Zhao Guohua MMW- in his Shengzhi chongbai wenhua lun (Beijing: Zhongguo Shehuikexueyuan Chubanshe 1990), 204. 23.

As a case in point, a bowl found in Tomb 155 at Zongri (fig. 4c) shows three entirely abstract configurations of nine biconical elements in black enclosing almond-shaped patches of unpainted yellow, framed by a different pattern dominated by a large central diagonal. Comparison with the two bowls with "dance scenes" suggests that the abstract configuration on the bowl from Tomb 155 is almost certainly an alternate version of the "group of dancers" décor. The parallel is clinched by the occurrence of the identical linear motif on the outside of all three bowls, which, with due caution, one may perhaps relate to the figurai décor on the inside and interpret as a rope symbolically enclos- ing a sacred space.27 Neither style nor object shape nor archaeological stratigraphy are of any help in determining whether the bowl from Tomb 155 is earlier or later in date than the one from Tomb 157. In analogy with Max Loehrs long-influential views of the evolution of Chinese bronze décor,28 art historians of a certain bent of mind might regard the abstract pattern as primary and posit that it prompted an innovative artist's imagination to distill silhouetted human figures from it. Alternatively, and perhaps more commonsensically, one might reverse the direction of derivation and argue that, since abstract ornamentalism seems to be the mainstream aesthetic tendency of Majiayao painted pottery, the abstract design on the bowl from Tomb 155 represents a "normalizing" reduction of an originally pictorial composition. Either way, one may wonder whether the viewers of the abstract design on the bowl from Tomb 155 would have understood it as signifying groups of figures holding hands. Was there perhaps some sort of conventional code that allowed participants in Majiayao culture to "read" these designs? Rather than to speculate further on this admittedly fascinating question, my aim here is merely to show that figure representation was by no means beyond the reach of Majiayao pottery painters, who produced compelling, albeit simple, compositions of figures interacting with one another. Indeed, painted pottery was not the only medium in which representation of figures in action was actualized in the Neolithic of Northwest China. For instance, excavations at Dadiwan Qin'an (Gansu), brought to light the remnants of a floor painting executed in a black carbonized pigment at a scale of about one-fifth life size (Fig. 5). 29 This 27. If this interpretation holds, the abstract motifs in between the three groups of figures might be read as symbolic representations of architectural structures or altars within that sacred space. 28.

Unfortunately, the house floor was later intruded into by a refuse pit, and only a portion of what appears to have been a much larger composition was preserved. It shows two human figures, plus a fragment of a third, above a rectangular frame enclosing two unidentifiable quadrupeds. The human figures are depicted as silhouettes, but with considerably more detailing than what is provided on the Majiayao painted bowls. Both are cross-legged, yet apparently standing, perhaps indicating an unstable posture or movement as on the bowl from Shangsunjiazhai. The arm postures are likewise identical for both: the left arm is bent upward and touches the head, whereas the right arm is pendent and holds a stick-like object protruding from the body. Perhaps the similarity in posture indicates some sort of choreographed movement, similar to the "dancing scenes" on the two painted bowls. The rectangular frame has been variously interpreted as an animal pen with two animals inside, a coffin containing two humans, or a bed with two outstretched females. Published interpretations of the composition as a whole, all highly speculative, suggest contexts of family ancestral cult, sympathetic magic, shamanistic dance, sexual customs, and hunting ritual, with various shades and nuances.30 In both scale and artistic ambition, the Dadiwan floor painting greatly outshines the "dancing scenes" on Majiayao painted vessels. Even though it is so far unique in the archaeological record, its modest architectural context at Dadiwan - a completely ordinary dwelling - suggests that paintings of this sort were quite common; many others might have either been destroyed or escaped the excavators' attention.

Other Bronze Age Manifestations In a possibly related vein, multifigure scenes involving sketchily rendered humans and animals in action are also ubiquitous among the prehistoric and early historic rock carvings that are distributed all around the northern, western, and southern margins of the Shang and Zhou kingdoms, as well as throughout much of Inner Asia.31 As they are notoriously difficult to date, I feel uncomfortable discussing them in any detail; I merely illustrate one example (Fig. 6). But it is almost certain that many of them date to the time when the Shang and Zhou dynasties were flourishing in areas fairly nearby. I mention only in passing that, during the first millennium 31. Such evidence is extensively referred to in the works cited in nn. 23-26 and 30.</page><page sequence="20">70 Lothar von Falkenhausen BC, the same populations that engraved petroglyphs created the famous "Animal- style" bronzes with their often vivid renditions of animals, exemplifying an esthetics completely distinct from that of their Zhou neighbors. Recent surveys and excavations have shown significant cultural connections between the Chinese Northwest (Gansu and Qinghai) and the Southwest (Sichuan and Yunnan SS) during the Neolithic and the Bronze Age. At the present state of research, it would, however, still be grossly premature to speculate about the extent to which the former areas painted-pottery and petroglyph-making tradi- tions might have influenced, or been historically connected to, the mode of figure representation of Sanxingdui. As the archaeological sequences become better known, however, it will hopefully become possible to trace these connections. A related topic on which ongoing research may yield significant new insights are the possible steppe influences on the much later, exuberantly figurai art of Dian &gt;K in central Yunnan during the Late first-millennium BC.32 For the moment, I must forego the detailed discussion of these important contributions to the art-historical diversity of continental East Asia. I merely wish to dwell on the contrast between the artistic practices in all these areas and those of the Shang and Zhou core. The absence of figures depicted in action in the latter area obviously cannot be due to any lack of ability on the part of the artists, or to a lack of potential inspiration; nor is it likely that the metropolitan Shang and Zhou inhabitants were completely unaware of the figurai art of their neighbors. Their concentration on the taotie and related motifs must have been the result of a conscious cultural choice - a choice that deliberately manifested and exacerbated the fundamental difference between them and the inhabitants of the surrounding areas. Art vs. Writing, and the Grey Zone in Between In this connection, I would like to take note of a fourth, extra-artistic mode of figure representation not mentioned so far: the graphemic mode, in which human and animal figures are transformed into pictographic or ideographic written signs. It is, of course, well known that the Chinese script as a whole is by no means pictographic or ideographic, but some of its components - radicals and a small minority of individual characters - are based on pictorial designs. And here we do sometimes see severely abstracted representations of human figures - usually, indeed, of figures in action. As an examples we may consider the character xiang "to hold a banquet," which as written in the Shang oracle bone inscriptions is an ideogram showing two figures kneeling opposite of each other with a jug of wine in between them (Fig. 7a); or the character fian Il/Ie, "to inspect; mirror," which 32.

Of course, such written characters - signs with a specific meaning and pro- nunciation conventionally attached - are by no means truly pictorial designs: a reader does not look at them and consciously thinks of the scene represented by its components in figuring out their meaning. Nor does their shape, in fact, give away their meaning - someone who has not learned the character xiang as part of the script might well imagine other possible meanings for the graph and would never be able to guess its pronunciation. The cognitive and physiological processes that go on when processing these characters are fundamentally different from those involved in "reading" a picture.34 Nor does a written character become more akin to a picture when it is executed as "calligraphy" with a conscious artistic concern for aesthetic beauty. But there is, in Shang and Early Western Zhou times, a curious and little- explored "grey zone" between writing and pictorial art that may force us to relativize this categorical distinction, and even perhaps to revisit our notion of the complete absence of figures represented in action at the metropolitan core of the Shang and Zhou kingdoms.35 These are the lineage emblems (zuhui £1®; the term is often mistakenly rendered as "clan signs") inscribed on many bronzes: pictographic signs - sometimes quite complex combinations of pictographic elements - that denote specific social units. Note that these emblems are not direct renderings of the names of the social units referred to - no more so than European family crests "write" the names of the families to whom they belong. Even though Shang and Zhou emblems resemble family crests in some respects, their components are fundamentally scriptural in nature, differing from the essentially pictorial modules of European heraldry. Some of these emblems show figures in action - a person holding up a child (Fig. 7c); a person whose hand has been chopped off (Fig. 7d); a warrior holding a dagger-axe and a shield (Fig. 7e); a beheaded figure with the axe that killed him (Fig. 7f); a person in a boat carrying a load on a carrying pole (Fig. 7g); a person carrying loads on its head and in one hand (Fig. 7h); a person carrying a banner (Fig. 7i); a person holding two horses, with a filly underneath 33.

That these emblems, though not characters (or "pictographs"), are closer to writing than to pictorial art - and that they were produced by scribes rather than by artist-craftsmen - is suggested by the fact that they are often combined with actual written characters as part of an inscribed dedicatory text. Nevertheless, they bear a noticeable visual resemblance to petroglyphs (cf. Fig. 6)37 and also, to some extent, to the figures represented in the much later pictorial bronzes of the Eastern Zhou period (cf. Fig. lc). One cannot exclude that the graphemic mode of figure representation may have been influenced by, and perhaps in turn exerted a modicum of influence on, the representational practices engaged in by artists. Any future investigation of these possible cross-currents will have to integrate linguistic and art-historical perspectives. At this juncture, it may be appropriate to observe that, in continental East Asia, at least from the Anyang period through the mid-first millennium BC, the apparent taboo on the pictorial rendering of important persons correlates with the presence of writing; and conversely, the taboo is not observed in areas where writing was not practiced. It is very unlikely that this is a mere coincidence. Even though, on present evidence, it appears that human figures had disappeared from representational art in the Yellow River basin for several centuries before the appearance of writing,38 the availability of writing as a means of recording important persons and divinities very probably played a role in further channeling artistic representation away from such figures, as well as conditioning the choice of mode of figure representation in the visual arts of the Late Shang and the Western Zhou. Perhaps, at that time, the taboo came to underscore some sort of scribal monopoly on referencing rulers and gods. At a sociological level, it may be palpable evidence of an assertion of power by scribes over artists. 36.

Indifferent to exploring gradual developments as they occurred over time, Koerner is principally interested in drawing a topologi- cal difference and to analyze it in terms of Ernst Gombrich's useful terminology.40 The challenge to someone interested in integrating Koerner s observations into a chronological account of Chinese art history lies in pinpointing how, and at what time, one mode of representation changed into another. In the case of Chinese bronze décor, we can trace this process in detail. Briefly stated, after ca. 900 BC hieratic representation of figures was gradually abandoned and replaced by increasingly abstract patterns derived from the zoomorphic motifs of earlier bronze decoration. In an earlier study, I proposed that basic to this development was the loss of the iconographie significance of the animal motifs represented, and I pointed out its simultaneity with changes in the typological composition and ritual use of the ritual bronzes thus decorated.41 The change in approach to the rendering of figurai motifs appears to have been related to a comprehensive cultural transformation, the Late Western Zhou Ritual Reform, which climaxed about 850 BC.42 For the most part, the earlier hieratic motifs were transformed into non-figural abstract patterns that need not detain us here. Of interest here are those types of "pure ornament" in which animal and/or human figures remain recognizable. 39. Koerner, "The Fate of the Thing" (see note 3 for full reference). 40.

But recent excavations have shown that the Late Western Zhou adoption of interlacery into bronze ornamentation was by no means completely unprecedented in the history of art in China. Interlaced animal bodies appear as early as ca. 2000 BC in Late Neolithic jades from the Liangzhu culture. Fanshan Sili, a Liangzhu cemetery near Hangzhou (Zhejiang has yielded several examples.

The motif is, incidentally, rendered in openwork, another technique that came into renewed favor with Late Western Zhou bronze casters, as Jessica Rawson has pointed out.46 Another openwork diadem from Tomb 16 (Fig. 9b) shows the same motif turned 90 degrees:47 here the large-eyed animal face occupies the center of the composition, with two trapezoid-faced figures shown in profile (or one such figure spliced up in two symmetrical halves); again, the criss-crossing of limbs and bodies is powerfully conveyed. The Liangzhu jade carvers were equally able to use interlacery as surface-covering ornament. On a jade scepter from Tomb 12 at Fanshan (Fig. 9c),48 for instance, we see it surrounding the double-face motif that is here rendered in its more usual, fully hieratic guise, with the trapezoid- faced human face on top of the large-eyed animal face, both shown frontally and in strict alignment.

Indeed, the Neolithic double face is, art- historically speaking, a likely predecessor of the taotie faces seen on Shang bronzes.49 It would seem a stretch to argue that Late Western Zhou bronze casters, in their transformation of the mode of rendering figurai designs on the surface of bronzes, were making a self-conscious return to the precedent of Liangzhu jades; on the other hand, it would be unwise to exclude such a possibility altogether, given what we now know about the circulation of Neolithic jades in Bronze Age China (see, e.g., Jessica Rawson's article in this volume), and about Neolithic continuities in Bronze Age iconography.50 More importantly, the Fanshan discoveries confirm that animal body-based interlace, like in-action representation of figures, was well within reach of artists in continental East Asia as early as Neolithic times and that its rise to prominence in Late Western Zhou did not constitute some sort of conceptual or cognitive breakthrough. Instead, it was presumably adopted because it answered to the specific needs of the historical moment - needs arising from comprehensive social and religious change. K. C. Chang once proposed a socio-psychological interpretation for the phe- nomena here discussed.51 Noting that, after the onset of the "Middle Zhou style" (i.e., the stylistic transformation in the wake of the Late Western Zhou ritual reform), the animal motifs were no longer religiously charged, he posited that the human-centered intellectual orientation of the Eastern Zhou engendered a new, potentially adversarial relationship between humans and animals. Previously, ani- mals had been revered as the mythical ancestors of the clans to which the lineages constituting the core of Zhou society claimed affiliation. With the rise of a more "rational," humanocentric view of early history, these supernatural beings, through a process sometimes referred to as reverse euhemerization, came to be conceived as human founding heroes of the remote past. No longer the spiritual mediators between humans and the supernatural, animals could now become objects for human exploitation and entertainment. It is against this background that hunting scenes and scenes of animals in combat came to be depicted on pictorial bronzes (see below). 49.

In bronze decoration, "pure ornament," usually executed in low relief, was limited to the surface ornamentation of the ves- sel bodies. Contrasting with it, high-relief or sometimes fully three-dimensional human and animal motifs adorn handles and feet and sometimes are appliquéd to the surface (cf. Fig. 8). In many cases these appendages retain a strongly hieratic appearance, bespeaking their origins in the Shang- Western Zhou tradition, but animate and quite realistically rendered figures with implied contexts of action appear with increasing frequency, starting in the mid-ninth century BC and thus prefiguring the mid-fifth century pictorial bronzes by four hundred years. These motifs and their significance merit a full-length study; here I shall merely adduce a couple of examples. On a bronze stove from Hoard 1 at Zhuangbai ® Ö, Fufeng ^JE (Shaanxi 0®) (Fig. 10a),53 stylistically datable to ca. 850 BC, we see fully sculpturally rendered bottle-horned dragons clambering up the four sides of the container portion, as well as birds marking the four corners of the fire chamber; they sit on disembod- ied large bird- feet (recognizable as such by their spurs), which serve as the feet of the vessel. The hinged opening of the fire chamber mimicks the double doors of a stately building, and the allusion to built architecture is maintained by the four-pane "windows" on the sides of the fire chamber. The door has a latch fixture in the shape of an animal face to which a human-shaped figure is attached; this doorman lacks his left foot, evoking a mental association with a classical account stating that convicts who had had one foot cut off as a punishment were to be employed as guardians.54 While the dragons and birds on the four corners, in spite of their sculptural execution, resemble the hieratic décor of earlier bronzes in their impassiveness, the human figure by the door is represented in its context of activity; indeed, the figure is quite literally put to work every time the door is opened and 52. Martin Powers's in-depth reflections (in Pattern and Person : Ornament , Society and Self in Classical China [Harvard East Asian Monographs, v. 262; Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2006) on ornament and its changing social meanings in Eastern Zhou China felicitously complement Chang's ideas and raise the discourse to a new level of sophistication. 53.

It thus obviously does not represent a person of rank (whom no one would dare handle in such a manner), but a deindividualized subordinate - a plaything for the high-status user of the stove. A later and more elaborate manifestation of the same esthetics can be seen on a miniature wheeled box from Tomb 89M7 at the important necropolis at Shangguo ±M, Wenxi KB (Shanxi) (Fig. 10b), dating to sometime between the mid-eighth and the Early seventh centuries BC.55 This curious object - one of the earliest bronze vessels of clearly non-ritual function from the Zhou period - rolls on two eight-spoked wheels resembling those of a chariot, and on small disk-shaped wheels inserted between the legs of two sculptural tigers that, as it were, "pull" the chariot. Six sculptural dragons are attached to the vertical sides of the vessel. A hinged double door is on the front; like that of the bronze stove from Zhuangbai, it has, as its handle, the figure of an amputated guardian holding an oversized latch ornamented with an animal face. The cover also consists of two hinged panes that may be opened with the help of a handle in the shape of a sitting monkey. Four sculptural birds sit on the cover; these birds originally swivelled in their sockets, allowing the vessel's handlers playfully to create various compositions. Additional birds in high relief are appliquéd to the vertical sides of the vessel body, contrasting with the otherwise abstract surface décor. The assemblage of animals with the monkey at the center may perhaps be read as a unified scene of humorous or whimsical implications, deliberately antithetical to the staid formality of ritual bronzes. The ability of the viewer to engage actively with the figures by manipulating their positions may be seen as a step toward representation of figures in action. The human figures in both instances are, of course, anonymous and subaltern; in this respect, Zhou bronzes continue to manifest the above-noted contrast vis- à-vis human representation in other ancient civilizations, and indeed in non-Zhou cultural areas of East and Central Asia.56 55.

I would tend to insist on the pertinence of this contrast throughout pre-Imperial China; pace Alain Thote ("Artists and Craftsmen in the Late Bronze Age of China [Eighth to Third Centuries BC] : Art in Transition," Proceedings of the British Academy 154 [2008], 201-241, especially 202-205), who, in an otherwise masterful treatment, sketches out an evolution from the depiction of utterly subaltern figures as seen on the stove and chariot-box discussed here, via the more detailed sword-carrying caryatid figure on the bell stand from the tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng at Leigudun, Suizhou (Hubei ^it) (Hubei Sheng Bowuguan &gt;¡$ Zeng Hou Yi mu |f^Z.ÍÍ [Beijing: Wenwu Chubanshe, 1989), v. 1, 79, fig. 39.3), to the individually finished faces of the soldiers of the First Emperor's Terracotta Army. In my opinion, one should stress the anonymity of the Zeng caryatid figure, which presumably embodies a (subaltern) function rather than an individual; likewise, in the Terracotta Army, the soldiers' heads were mass-produced in molds - the secondary individuation of the faces (as well as of their painted clothing), rather than imparting any degree of personhood on the soldiers, arguably intended to accentuate the awesome reach of imperial power over the whole sweep of diversity</page><page sequence="32">82 Lothar von Falkenhausen For a simpler, and much later, descendant of these animated figurai composi- tions - dating to a time when vessels with fully pictorial décor were already being made - we may look once more at the object depicted above to exemplify animal bodies transformed into "pure ornament:" a ding ^ from the large and rich Tomb 251 at Jinshengcun Taiyuan (Shanxi), dated to ca. 425 BC (Fig. lb).57 Appliquéd to the cover of this vessel we see three three-dimensionally sculpted cows in languid postures. Unlike the protruding elements seen on the covers of many other Eastern Zhou vessels, they do not serve as lifting devices, but their function seems to be purely decorative, their lively naturalism complementing - and strongly contrasting with - the surface ornament of interlaced dragon bodies. The context of activity for the three cows is left to the viewer to imagine. Such décor is not very widespread in this period and probably limited to high-status contexts. More typical of Later Eastern Zhou bronze art are appliquéd zoomorphic elements that seem to be revivals of much older hieratic designs, such as those above the feet of the same ding vessel. This vessel is indeed remarkable - though by no means unique - for combining instances of all three modes of figure representation: hieratic, ornamental, and (at least implicitly) in action. This versatility - perhaps the result of a conjuncture of different varieties of modular productions - is a so- far little appreciated characteristic of Eastern Zhou artistic practice, and it stands in fundamental contrast with the earlier tradition of Shang and Early Western Zhou bronze décor. Modularized Action Scenes We may now take a closer look at the pictorial bronzes that came in vogue all over the Zhou culture sphere during the fifth century BC. It is by now sufficiently clear that they are not the earliest Chinese instance of representation of figures in action. But they are nevertheless art-historically pioneering for being the first pre- served instances in the Chinese Bronze Age of figures in action represented within their spatial context on a two-dimensional surface. A frame - often no more than a single line, sometimes a band of "pure ornament" - is provided for every scene, thus clarifying the relationships among the figures and between them and other elements in the composition (buildings, plants, and various props). Several scenes can be arranged on the same surface, thus offering the potential of representing sequences of interrelated events. Even though the figures themselves are extremely small and sketchy, these conventions of composition radically differentiate the picto- rial bronzes from the examples of figure representation discussed in the preceding section, where the construction of the spatial and narrative framework is left almost entirely up to the viewer. among the phenomena of the universe. 57.

Both groups have in common that the pictorial designs appearing on the vessels are of very limited variety, due no doubt to limits as to what was considered appropriate for representation in the bronze medium. Both the engravers of the vessels of the first group and the makers of pattern blocks used in producing vessels of the second group in all likelihood worked from standard models that were reproduced with but very slight variations. Either technique is thus modular, although modularity here takes on two somewhat different senses.58 To complement Alain Thote's analysis of vessels of the first group, which likely were produced in the southeastern coastal region of China, I show here an example from the second group: a hu vessel excavated at Baihuatan Chengdu (Sichuan) but almost certainly manufactured at the Houma foundry in Shanxi (Fig. lc).59 Space constraints force me to forego a close description of its pictorial decoration, which is principally deployed in three registers around the main bulge of the vessel body. Each register contains two scenes placed adjacent to each other; these paired scenes are twice repeated identically on the opposite side of the vessel. There are thus six different scenes. In an early article, Hayashi Minao was able to identify all scenes on comparable vessels known at that time as schematic represen- tations of activities of ritual and warfare, the two major concerns of Zhou period aristocrats.60 Each can be linked to textual parallels in the ritual classics. The six principal scenes on the Baihuatan hu may be identified as (1) a shooting ritual and (2) a mulberry-picking ritual on the upper tier; (3) a grand sacrificial banquet with a musical performance and (4) another shooting ritual, involving a ritual hunt and followed by the preparation of the prey in a subterranean kitchen, on the middle tier; as well as (5) an assault at a walled city (the defenders are standing atop the rampart, and the diagonal lines represent a parapet built by the attackers) and (6) 58.

It is possible that there is a social meaning behind the placement of the scenes: the two scenes on the upper tier may show the activities of men and women of the highest rank; the middle tier may show ceremonies held for the benefit of their lower-ranking kin; and the lower tier is obviously devoted to warfare, which involved an even larger number of male members of the Zhou kin groups. From a technological point of view, the execution of the pictorial décor is merely a standard application of the typical Eastern Zhou pattern-block and inlay techniques - the very techniques that were being used at the same workshops to produce vessels with animal décor reduced to "pure ornament" (such as the Jinshengcun ding in Fig. lb). Both technologically and in its visual features, the decoration is overwhelmingly modular in nature. The six kinds of scenes are evocative, but they are also highly generic. Aside from size differences and minor detailing on the sil- houettes to accentuate belts and the patterning of robes (all of which may be crude indicators of differences in social status), the human figures offer little more detail than those depicted on the Neolithic pottery vessels discussed above; it is difficult even to distinguish males from females (differences in hairdo and the presence of swords on male figures offer some clues, but they are not always conclusive).61 Even though these compositions are narrative in a broad sense - "something happens" in them - they do not show particular, historically specific events or persons, but standardized, highly scripted performances in which participants interact with one another in prescribed, predictable ways. The repeatability of the events depicted is aptly underscored by the use of the pattern-block technique, which makes it pos- sible to produce as many identical renderings as necessary to fill the surface available for decoration. That these were important events involving members of the social élite did not, apparently, motivate the artists to attempt greater individuation (or "realism") in rendering them. The décor of the hu vessel illustrates, inter alia , its own context of usage (in Scene 3, on the middle tier) as part of a set of sacred vessels (zunyi ##). An analogue in the realm of literature are the ritual hymns of the Shi fing describing the rituals in the course of which these very hymns were sung.62 One can only speculate about what brought about the rise of such self-referential visual art. Was it that, during the period when objects like the hu from Baihuatan were made, the traditional rituals were in abeyance? Was the intention perhaps to communicate them to elements in the population not previously included among the participants, or indeed to areas outside the Zhou culture sphere? 61.

More than anything, the figures composed into the scenes gracing the surfaces of the pictorial bronzes remind visually of the symbols constituting Shang period "lineage emblems" (Fig. 7). But these elements have here been brought into a context of performative action; there is no trace of an ambiguity as to whether they belong to the realm of script or of representational art. I do not wish to suggest a direct genetic link between the "lineage emblems" phenomena and the pictorial bronzes. But the visual resemblance suggests the possibility that there is a certain amount of conceptual convergence in the use, in both contexts, of extremely abstracted figures in order to create pictures - in other words, a convergence of the graphemic and in-action modes of figure representation. Some modern Chinese artists have fed on this, most notably Xu Bing (b. 1955);64 and it might be fruitful to pursue such inroads of pictography into representational art through the whole sweep of the history of East Asian calligraphy. Of course, similar crossovers have occurred outside of East Asia as well; in recent American art, the late Keith Harings (1958- 1990) notorious stick figures may serve as an example. Confronted with the awkward rendering of figures on pictorial bronzes, a connais- seurially inclined art historian will be tempted to speak of an evolutionary deficiency begging to be remedied: an insufficiently developed conceptual grasp of the human figure testifying to the less-than-perfect cognitive skills of the artist. Such a notion seems to be borne out by similar lack of individuation in contemporaneous paint- ings on silk (cf. the human figures on the Warring States period paintings,65 and the figures of divinities on the famous calendrical manuscript, all from Changsha [Hunan]),66 or in lacquer (e.g. the guardian figures on the outer sarcophagus 63. I insert this important caveat at the highly pertinent suggestion of Alain Thote; indeed, some Eastern Zhou-period texts allude to publicly displayed (painted?) pictures of such a nature. One hopes for archaeological discoveries that will clarify this issue. 64. Britta Erickson, Words Without Meaning, Meaning Without Words : The Art ofXu Bing (Washington, D. C.: Arthur M.

The subsequent history of representational art in China does bear witness to a gradual development toward renderings that are more detailed, more lifelike, more "realistic," and, to us today, more visually compelling. Even more importantly, a more fully narrative art in which scenes composed of figures-in-action tell an actual story (whether fictive or historical) and in which several such scenes can represent successive moments in a story, grew out of these Eastern Zhou pictorial roots during the Early Imperial era.69 The earliest, still some- what hesitant steps in this development may be observed in some exceptional Late Warring States period works, such as the painted scenes composed of elegant figures 67.

The execution is considerably finer than in the roughly contemporaneous examples mentioned above - with little hyperbole, the figures on the Baoshan box may be said to prefigure the celebrated masterworks by Gu Kaizhi SfifiSŹ. (AD 344[?]-406). In the following century, the painted murals recovered from Building 3 of the Qin imperial palace in Xianyang 01 (Shaanxi) (Fig. lid) show similar motifs translated into a much larger scale and composed over a much larger surface;71 here it is perhaps safe to assume that the subject represented is the Qin ruler and his entourage. The incomplete preservation of these murals prevents us from being able to judge how visually compelling they were as a whole. But there is enough for us to see that, as on the pictorial bronzes and on the Baoshan lacquer vessel, the narrative events are framed (and, arguably, enhanced) by purely ornamental borders. The Qin palace murals are also important because they constitute the crucial art historical link between the regionally as well as sociologically diverse Warring States traditions and the Han period tomb murals and carved-stone reliefs, as well as to the later history of Chinese painting. That these developments were not confined to two-dimensional renderings is manifested by the sculptural achievement of the First Emperors terracotta army. Some caution is nevertheless in order vis-à-vis such an evolutionary scenario from crude to refined representation of figures in action, and from generic scenes to narrative art. First of all, representation of figures in action was only one aspect - and arguably a rather minor one - of the visual arts in Late pre-Imperial China. The pervasively polystylistic nature of Chinese art arguably constitutes a salient contrast to the European experience ;72it may well have been facilitated by the pervasive use of modular procedures of art production, which potentially encouraged the separate development of traditions of practice unconnected by an overarching esthetics.73 Indeed, the developments did not necessarily proceed in a linear sequence; the Baoshan lacquer box is more or less contemporaneous with the much less "advanced" renderings of human figures on the Changtaiguan se , and Han funerary depictions, though often lively, are generally far cruder than those from the First Emperors palace. 70.

The implications and consequences should be fully explored in a separate study.</page><page sequence="40">90 Lothar von Falkenhausen Second, rather than only focusing on the artists, one should include the public into consideration; if one does, one will find it more appropriate to understand the developments in modes of representation as reflecting changes in the visual conven- tions that governed the ways in which an image, or a class of images, was perceived, recognized, and considered compelling by its intended viewers. One way of looking at this would be to say that, as the artists' rendering skills "improved" over time, their patrons and critics had to keep apace with the visual innovations put before them. But one cannot be sure that these innovations were not triggered by market demand, rather than from the artists' self-indulgent quest to realize their virtuoso skills. This much is suggested by both history and cross-cultural comparison. Close attention to context is necessary to understand each particular case. Might outside influences have been involved? Such a question is no longer taboo, but in spite of a great increase in archaeological discoveries during recent decades, it remains difficult to pinpoint any specific contacts between the Zhou culture sphere during the second half of the first millennium BC with the desirable exactitude.74In general, the ongoing social changes in Zhou society during that pivotal epoch certainly enabled an enhanced awareness of cultural (and socio-political) realities beyond the traditional cultural, social, and political boundaries. In this connec- tion, Alain Thotes interpretation of the décor of pictorial bronzes as intending to communicate Zhou cultural values to outsiders is of great interest.75 Arguably, such interaction went on at three levels: (1) with high-ranking individuals alien to Zhou culture, some of whom might be acculturated through participation in Zhou rituals; (2) with the newly-empowered non-aristocratic strata in the population, who had heretofore been insufficiently acquainted with the principles of Zhou ritual; and 74. Elsewhere I have raised the possibility of an influx of new religious ideas from the West to explain the thoroughgoing shifts in mortuary behavior during the Eastern Zhou period (Lothar von Falkenhausen, "Mortuary Behavior in Pre-Imperiai Qin: A Religious Interpretation," in John Lagerwey [ed.], Chinese Religion and Society [Hong Kong: Chinese University Press, 2004], v. 1, 109-172). Li Ling has traced the influx of art motifs from the Scytho-Iranian world into China (Li Ling, Rushanyu chusai [Beijing: Wenwu Chubanshe, 2004], 87-161); for a similar argument, see Robert W. Bagley, "Ornament, Representation, and Imaginary Animals in Bronze Age China," Arts asiatiques , 61 (2006), 17-29; Wu Hung believes that the idea of using stone for carving images and cave-shaped monuments reached China from India ( Monumental- ity in Early Chinese Art and Architecture [Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1995], 121-142), whilst Li Ling ( Rushan yu chusaiy 41-83), in a related context, emphasizes Central Asian con- nections; and Bo Lawergren has traced stringed instruments in use in China during the Late first millennium BC to West Asian prototypes ("To Tune a String: Dichotomies and Diffusions Between the Near and Far East," in Börje Magnusson et al.

The materials from surrounding areas such as Sanxingdui stand as a warning against assuming that the Shang/Zhou experience constitutes some kind of "law," the validity of which can be extended to other, less well-documented cases around the world. We are left with the somewhat nebulous realization that, at any given stage of socio-political evolution, "cultural choice" can lead to unpredictable situations, which often result in great differences even between geographically adjacent culture areas. Such choices are unquestionably linked to socio-political realities, but these linkages are complex and evolve historically. Because of the often accidental nature of the decisions involved, one is well-advised to resist the temptation of essential- izing such differences as irreducible "national characteristics." Acknowledgments An earlier version of this article was presented at the European and North American Exchanges in East Asian Studies Conference, De l'image à l'action : La dynamique des représentations , Paris, September 4, 2001. I thank Haun Saussy and Ladislav Kesner for extensive comments on the conference-paper version (and, in Ladislav Kesners case, also on this new incarnation), and in particular Alain Thote for a most helpful relecture of the present text. 76. There would be a great deal to say on each of these points. On no. 1, see Thote, "Inter- cultural Relations;" on no. 2, Mark E. Lewis, Writing and Authority in Early China (Albany, N. Y.: State University of New York Press), 13-31 (the same concerns also account for a tremendous expansion in the scope of writing, and of writing about ritual concerns in particular); and on no. 3, Poo Mu-chou, In Search of Personal Welfare : A View of Ancient Chinese Religion (Albany, N. Y.: State University of New York Press, 1998), 41-101 et passim. 77.
