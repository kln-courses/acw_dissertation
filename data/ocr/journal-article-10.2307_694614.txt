RIDGEWAY rightly lays stress on the tradition that, before the advent of the Etruscans, Pelasgians from Thessaly had settled in N. Italy and made common cause with the kindred tribe of the Aborigines.' He further advances the attractive and indeed brilliant hypothesis that the quasi- Greek works of art (bronzes, scarabs, 1 E.A. i. 231 ff.</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. 361 frescoes, etc.) found in Etruria are due to the Pelasgian element in the Etruscan population.1 If this be so, we may look to find traces of the triple Pelasgian Zeus among the artistic products of Etruria. The Etruscan scarab here reproduced 2 shows a -i? FIG. 1. naked male deity with a himation over his left arm in the act of stepping into a chariot. He grasps a thunderbolt in his right hand, a trident in his left; while at his feet is a dog. We can hardly be mistaken in regard- ing this singular figure as the threefold Pelasgian god : the thunderbolt marks him as Zeus, the trident as Poseidon, the dog (Cerberus) and the chariot as Hades.3 This triple Zeus was the god of Dodona; and it is known that the Pelasgians who crossed from Thessaly to Italy and allied them- selves with their kinsmen the Aborigines continued to worship the Dodonaean Zeus.4 Hence the oak-cult can be detected in sundry settlements of the Etruscans. For example, the Etruscans once occupied the Vatican near Rome 5; and Pliny states 6 that 'on the Vatican is an oak-tree (ilex) older than Rome itself, bearing a bronze inscription in Etruscan letters, which proves that even in those early days the tree was thought worthy of religious vener- ation.' Gellius mentions a ' Vaticanus deus' and notes the tradition that he drew his name 'a vaticiniis' ; 7 this would suit well a god like that of Dodona. Again, the Etruscans had a settlement on the Caelian,8 which in ancient times was covered with oak-woods and known as the Mons Quer- quetulanus.9 The Notitica Regionum10 records an 'arborem sanctam' on the same height, presumably the sacred oak of the Etruscan settlers. This inference is strongly sup- ported by a bas-relief found at Rome, prob- ably on the Caelian: it shows three figures inscribed Herculi luliano, lovi Caelio, and Genio Caelimontis; Hercules has a club and a lion-skin the Genius is seated on the hill and holds a laurel; but the central figure, that of Jupiter Caelius, has an eagle, a thunderbolt, and a sceptre, and by him is represented an oak-tree." Portents connected with these sacred oaks were interpreted by Etruscan haruspices.12 Hence in the corrupt Hesychian gloss &amp;poa- TraKES" pv'Es c7rLKEKO/LWEvaL we should restore cpoo7rLKEs = haruspices.13 The lightning lore of these diviners was ascribed to an Etrus- can nymph Begoe14 or Vegone,15 whose name possibly denotes an oak-nymph (cryds).1" The Etruscan Lucumons on state occa- sions used to wear the costume of Jupiter 17 and must have been regarded as his special representatives, if not actually as embodi- ments of him. Their curule seats is and purple raiment 19 were such as befitted the man-god.20 A sceptre with an eagle perched upon it21 proclaimed the human Jupiter. The Etrusca corona, a large gold crown of oak-leaves enriched with acorns of precious stones and golden ribands,22 marked the man as vice-gerent of the oak-god.

It is significant too that Aeneas is said 6 to have planted a huge oak- tree decked with spoils on the tomb of Mezentius, king of the Pelasgian 7 or Etrus- can town Agylla, and that this oak-tree was regarded as an effigy of Mezentius himself.8 The transmission of the Etruscan royal insignia to the kings, dictators, triumphators, etc. of Rome is too well known to need illustration.9 Latium Vetus. At several towns of the Latini the cult of an oak-Jupiter may be traced. Tibur wor- shipped Jupiter Praestes,1o and pointed to a group of three ancient oaks as the spot where its eponym Tiburnus or Tiburtus had been inaugurated.11 Since Tibur, according to the older form of its local legend,12 was founded by Catillus the Arcadian, father of Tiburtus and comrade of Evander, it may be surmised that its triad of sacred oaks was the residence of the triple Pelasgian oak- Zeus.l3 The Tiburtine cult of Vesta 14 proves the maintenance of a perpetual fire. Other oak-kings meet us at Laurentum. Here was 'the palace of Picus 15 thick-set with trees and ancestral awe' 16; also the funeral mound of king Dercennus topped by a shady oak.17 The oak-cult of Jupiter and Fortuna at Praeneste I have already considered.'8 So numerous were the oaks of the neighbour- hood that Servius19 derives Preaeneste from 7rptvos 1He adds that Caeculus, who founded the town, was the son of Vulcan, having been conceived by his mother from a spark off the hearth, and that he proved his divine origin to an incredulous crowd by enveloping them with flame. The sacred hearth and the divine king are quite in keeping with the oak-cult. Erulus, an- other king of the Praenestines, obtained from his mother Feronia three lives,20 so that he was a sort of Geryones.21 As Feronia at Praeneste was associated with Fortuna,22 and Fortuna with Jupiter, it is probable that Erulus was rpt'vXosl as the embodiment of a triple Jupiter. The Querquetulani were members of the Latin League23 inhabiting an oak-clad dis- trict identified by Gell 24 with Corcollo between Gabii and Hadrian's Villa. They shared in the Latin sacrifice to Jupiter on the Alban Mount,25 but are otherwise un- known. In 458 B.c. Roman envoys were sent to complain that the Aequi had broken a 1 The use of the bulla as a prophylactic amulet (Dar.-Sagl. s.v.

They were bidden to make their complaint to a huge oak on Mount Algidus, under the shade of whose branches the Aequian commander had his quarters; and this they actually did.1 The praetorium under the sacred oak is cer- tainly a primitive trait. The common cult of the Latini was that of Jupiter Latiaris in a grove of oaks 3 on the summit of the Alban Mount. It is surely significant that at Albano was found a broken bas-relief of archaistic style thus described by Brunn: 'The central figure is a god, bearded and crowned, who by the attributes of a thunderbolt and a trident on his right, and a cornucopia surmounted by an eagle on his left side is shown to be Jupiter conceived as lord of the sky, the sea, and the underworld.' 4 In short, it is an un- mistakeable representation of the triple Pelas- gian god. Agreeably to this we read that Latinus, the eponymous king of the Latini, was identified with Jupiter Latiaris : Festus5 states that 'he vanished in a battle with Mezentius king of Caere and was thought to have become Jupiter Latiaris.' His wife Amata bore a name that was common to all Vestals,6 and is usually7 connected with the cult of Vesta Albana: indeed a sacred fire was kept burning on the Alban hearth down to the latest days of Pagan- ism.8 Aeneas the founder of the Alban dynasty, like Latinus, disappeared in a battle with Mezentius or with Turnus and was worshipped as Jupiter Indiges.9 His son Ascaniuswas succeeded by Silvius and a whole line of Silvii.10 The name Ascanius, as Dr. J. H. Moulton suggests to me, perhaps denoted an ' oak '-king (cp. J~rK-p-a, ' oak '). Further, the cognomen of the Silvii may be taken to imply that they were representa- tives of a tree-god; and, since Virgil in- troduces them one and all as crowned 'civili . . . quercu,'11 this tree-god must have been an oak-Jupiter. On a sarco- phagus in the Mattei collection at Rome Rhea Silvia reclines beneath an oak-tree.12 Romulus Silvius the eleventh in descent was a veritable Salmoneus. Ovid13 de- scribep him as 'Remulus...imitator ful- minis'; and Dionysius,14 who calls him Alladius, says that 'in contempt of the gods he contrived mock thunderbolts and noises like thunder, wherewith he thought to frighten men as though he were a god. But a storm fraught with rain and lightning falling upon his house, and the lake near which it stood swelling in an unusual manner, he was drowned with his whole family.' Dionysius"1 also records the tradi- tion that Iulus, son of Ascanius, disputed the claim of the first Silvius to the throne: 'and to Iulus in place of the sovereignty a certain holy power and honour was given, preferable to the royal dignity both for security and for ease; and this his pos- terity enjoy down to the present time, being called Julii from him.' Now the name Iulus has been traced 16 through the forms Diovilus, lovilus, Iohilus, loilus, Iulus, and in all probability denoted originally a human Jupiter. It appears, then, that in the Alban district there were two lines of divine or priestly kings, both claiming affinity to Jupiter. The Julii probably lived in Bovillae at the foot of the mountain; for an ancient altar found there is inscribed 17 Vediovei Patrei genteiles Iuliei. Vedi[ovei] eara leege Albana dicata. Also Tiberius dedicated a chapel to the Julian gens at Bovillae, including a statue of the deified Augustus; 1s and it is known that Circensian games were held there in honour of the same house.19 But where did the Silvii or 'Woodland' kings reside? Cicero 20 speaks of the 'nemora' of Jupiter 1 Liv. 3. 25. 2 Liv. 1. 31. 3. 3 This may be inferred from the statement that the sow of Alba Longa was found 'sub ilicibus' (Verg.

When, therefore, we recall the fact that a rex Nemorensis lived at Nemi on the lower slopes of the mountain and kept guard over a sacred tree in the precinct of Diana, it is tempting to suppose that he was the representative of the old ?ilvian dynasty. He was cLLtprq acd not only because he had to be constantly on the watch for assailants,1 but also perhaps because, as Dr. Frazer first suggested in the Golden Bough' ii. 369 f., he personated Jupiter.2 Dr. Frazer's further conjec- ture 3 that he was originally put to death at the end of a set period would, on this showing, be supported by the practice of oscillatio at the Feriae Latinae: for, on the one hand, oscilla are undoubtedly relics of human sacrifice offered to tree- gods ; and, on the other, Festus states that the oscillatio of the Latin panegyris was instituted because the body of Latinus, who was identified with Jupiter Latiaris, could not be found. Another trace of the human sacrifice is to be seen in the Roman custom of presenting to Jupiter Latiaris during the Latin festival the warm blood of a bestiarius.6 The race of four-horse chariots that took place at the same time on the Capitol,7 i.e. on the Capitolium Vetus, which was probably identical with the Collis Latiaris on the south side of the Quirinal,s like the races at Olympia and elsewhere,9 may have sprung from an original contest for the post of priestly-king, a contest perpetuated in the monomachia of Nemi. When in 231 B.C. C. Papirius Maso introduced the practice of celebrating a lesser triumph on the Alban Mount,10 he was but expressing afresh the deep-seated belief of the Latini that the victor for the time being should be clad in the insignia of Jupiter Latiaris. Hence the large sceptre surmounted by an eagle that he bears on a Praenestine cistac.1 Rome. The earliest temple at Rome was that of Jupiter Feretrius planned by Romulus, when he had with his own hands slain the king of the Caeninenses and deposited his spoils on the Capitol ' at an oak held sacred by the shepherds.'12 Prof. Ridgeway has argued that the Aborigines of Rome were akin to the Pelasgians.13 It would appear, then, that on the Roman Capitol there was the cult of an oak-Jupiter resembling the Pelasgian oak-Zeus. His title Feretrius is obviously derived from feretrum, the fere- trum in question being a lopped trunk or wooden cross to which the votive armour was attached.14 This explanation fits both the literary and the monumental evidence. Plutarch 15 says: 'Romulus, that he might pay his vow in a manner well-pleasing to Jupiter. . . cut down an enormous oak which was growing in the camp, trimmed it to the shape of a trophy, and fastened about it all the weapons of Acron in order due.' And again,16 ' Marcellus cut down the large straight stock of a flourishing oak and decked it like a trophy, binding and attach- ing thereto the spoils, which he arranged round it each in its suitable place.' Diony- sius 17 equates Feretrius with Tpo7ratoizxog, crKvXo4Opo%, ~7TrpCEpcpETs; and Livy 1i in his description of Romulucr as 'spolia... sus- pensa fabricato ad id apte ferculo gerens' implies a trophy-like support. The his- torians' words are illustrated by a denarius of the gens Cornelia,19 which shows M. Claudius Marcellus carrying a portable trophy of the usual type up the steps of a small tetrastyle building: he is presenting the spolia opima that he won in 222 B.c. from the Insubrian chief Viridomarus at the shrine of Jupiter Feretrius. This prac- tice, which was indeed a definite law,20 perhaps arose from the ancient custom that the king as priest of the oak-god must be able to slay all comers.21 1 Strab. 239. 2 Cp. Salmoneus on a vase already figured (C.R. xvii. 276). Zeus AaSpav8evs at Mylasa had a sword, as had Zeus Xpvoadpros at Stratonicea (ib. 417).

Aen. 6. 136) and the local priest is armed with a sword. The parallel suggests that the latter, like the former, was a divine weapon. 3 See C.R. xvi. 369. 4 Marindin in Smith Dict. Ant. 2 ii. 305.

Euri- pides1 expressly terms it Z-qvo. . .. p'rag; and Virgil 2 relates how it was fashioned out of an oak-tree-' ingentem quercum decisis undique ramis.' Thus the form of the trophy points backwards to the tree-cult and forwards to the anthropomorphic cult of the god. Before it came the 'Waffen- baum'3 e.g. an oak-tree decked with the spoils of war4; after it, the xoanon.5 Tree, quasi-tree, carved image are three stages in a progressive series. In the ' oak held sacred by the shepherds' we have the first; in the feretrum or trophy, the second: Jupiter Feretrius never reached the third.6 In his temple were kept two objects of peculiar sanctity, a sceptre and a piece of flint. Jupiter was immanent in both. ' The reason,' says Servius,' 'why the sceptre is used when a treaty has to be made is this. Our forefathers on all such occasions were wont to produce an image of Jupiter. This was difficult, especially when the treaty was made with a distant tribe. A way out. of the difficulty was for them to hold a sceptre and so copy as it were the image of Jupiter; for the sceptre is peculiar to himself.' Since we have elsewhere 8 seen the sceptre of Zeus used as a substitute for the tree-god, we may fairly understand this sceptre of Jupiter Feretrius in the same sense. The flint-stone also was held to be 'antiquum lovis signum 9"; and the indwelling of the god in his symbol is attested by his alter- native title, Jupiter Lapis.1o Modern opinion is divided as to whether the flint was worked or unworked."1 On the one hand it was of such a sort that the Fetiales could take it Eds r;v Xetpa,'2 and slaughter a pig with it.13 On the other hand it is never described as a worked flint; and we are told14 that in 201 B.C. the Senate sent the Fetiales with several similar stones to Africa. On the whole it seems probable that it was an un- hafted neolithic celt,15 preserved among the Aborigines of Latium from an immemorial past.16 These celts certainly aroused the religious awe of the ancients : sundry ex- tant specimens bear Gnostic or Mithraic inscriptions,17 and Pliny'8s mentions cerauniae 'resembling axes.' They were, then, taken to be thunderbolts-a world-wide supersti- tion.19 I conclude that the ' lapis silex' of Jupiter Feretrius was the weapon and symbol of the sky-god, just as the stone axe in the palace of Minos was the weapon and symbol of Zeus.20 But was the sky-god also a water-god and an earth-god ? His connexion with water is best known by the primitive ceremony of the aquaelicium or aquilicium.21 [n time of drought the pontifices took a stone called the nmanalis lapis from its normal position near the temple of Mars outside the Porta Capena and drew it into the city. It was attended by matrons with bare feet and streaming hair and by the magistrates without their tokens of office. This stone was probably a baetyl of Jupiter Elicius 2 for Petronius23 with reference to the procession says 'Iovem aquam exorabant,' and Tertullian,24 'aquilicia Iovis immolatis, nudipedalia populo denuntiatis.' Now the title Elicius was also spelt Ilicius, and I have already suggested that Jupiter Ilicius was Jupiter of the oak (ilex).25 This sugges- tion is borne out by what we know of the locality.20 The Porta Capena adjoined the Porta Querquetulana,27 inside which was an or Capitolini instituted by Romulus in honour of Jupiter Feretrius (Piso frag. 7 Peter). The prize in the certamen Capitolinum founded by Domitian was an oak-wreath (Juv. 6. 387, Stat. silv. 5. 3. 231, Mart. 4. 54. 1, 9. 24. 5). 1 Phoen. 1250. 2 Aen. 11. 5. 3 Bjtticher BaumEkultus p. 71 ff. 4 Verg.

Here, he says,6 'a perpetual spring of water manabat sexo'-an allusion perhaps to the manalis lapis. He further relates that Numa, when the people was panic-stricken by continual lightnings and rain, repaired to this wood, caught Picus and Faunus by guile, induced them to call Jupiter down from heaven, and in a famous colloquy per- suaded him to accept surrogates for human sacrifice.' The conception of Jupiter as at once sky-god and water-god runs through the whole myth. Again, it was probably as a water-god that Jupiter mated Juturna,s an ancient Latin goddess of 'lakes and sounding rivers,' 9 whose name is clearly related to his own. At Rome Juturna figures in connexion with a small group of buildings in the Forum, the antiquity of which is proved by the fact that they have the trapezoidal form commonly found in the terramare villages of Italy.1o The old water- house of Juturna, the pit beneath the hearth of Vesta, the Regia, the Niger Lapis, the Tullianum, are all trapezoidal in struc- ture and belong to the Aborigines 11 of Rome. Juturna's well-head stood next to the house of the Vestals and must have been used by them.12 'The little group of the thatched hut beside the spring was completed by a grove of oak-trees, growing on the side of the Palatine. In this grove fuel was once cut for the sacred fire, which might only burn the wood of oaks,13 or in later times, of other " fruitful" trees . . . . Some of its trees were still standing in the time of Cicero,"4 and the memory of it had not died away even in the third century A.D., for a bough of oak, the " quercus robur " of Jove, appears behind the last Temple of Vesta on the Uffizi bas-relief.' 1~ The immense importance attached by the Romans to the maintenance of the fire on Vesta's hearth is to be explained not by the mere necessity of keeping a fire alight for secular purposes, but by the primitive belief that the priestly- king, the representative of the sun-god, can thus by mimetic magic preserve the very forces of the sun.16 When through negli- gence the fire went out, it had to be rekindled by means of a fire-drill,17 a process which symbolised the revolution of the sun itself.'s Lastly, the Romans recognised a chthon- ian Jupiter in Vediovis, whose character is clear from the devotion-formula Dis pater Veiovis Manes etc.,19 from the translation of his name as ro KaTaXOOVLOU Ahld,20 and from direct statements such as that of Martianus Capella21l: 'Pluton quem etiam Ditem Veiovemque dixere.' He too was an oak- god, as may be inferred not only from the site of his sanctuary uEOO'ptov 8vozv 8pvU v 22 but also from the oak-wreath that he wears on coins of the Fonteii, Gargilii, and Ogulnii.23 Moreover, that he was sky-god and water-god as well as earth-god appears from his attributes, the thunderbolt 24 and the trident.25 We have already found him wor- shipped at Bovillae by the Julii, who were the royal priests and human representatives of Jupiter.26 If the Romans had thus from a very early period believed in Jupiter as supreme over a threefold domain, there was a foundation 1 Fest. s.v.

The poets know Jupiter not only as sky-god but also as Jupiter aequoreus 1 and as Jupiter Stygius,2 Tar- tareus,3 infernus,4 niger,5 etc.; so that Ovid 6 can say : 'upiter arces temperat aetherias et mundi regna triformis.' The systematisers of theology 7 also recognised three Jupiters, the son of Aether born in Arcadia, the son of Caelus (or Saturn) also an Arcadian by birth, and the son of Saturn born and buried in Crete. Of the triple Jupiter no three-bodied or three-headed or three-eyed representations are extant. But it is noteworthy that tradition 8 brought to Rome a certain Argus, who was entertained by Evander but on plotting the king's death was killed by his comrades and buried at the Argile- turn. Other accounts 9 made Argus killed by Evander himself, or stated that he was the brother of Argeus and son of Phineus and Danae who settled in Rome and was there put to death by the Aborigines. These traditions point to a Pelasgian or Aboriginal Argus at Rome, who should be compared with the Pelasgian Argus (= the three-eyed Zeus 10) in Greece. To the same Pelasgian or Aboriginal stratum belong the argei or sexagenarii, the superannuated representa- tives of a tree-god whose itstitution was traced back to the oak-Zeus of Dodona.11 We thus obtain fresh confirmation of the conjecture that early Rome had a triple oak- Jupiter corresponding to the triple oak- Zeus 12 of Argos. Now Greek vases 13 show Argos Ilavo'r7'r with a Janiform head, which-since he was the triple Zeus--may be regarded as a modification of a three- faced head. This suggests the possibility that certain Janiform heads of Jupiter are to be similarly explained: there is one in the Palazzo Spada at Rome,4" and another on a coin of Geta 15 (Fig. 2), which shows a ~~Ii FIG. 2. double-headed Jupiter armed with a thunder- bolt and a spear (Jupiter Quirinus9). In- deed Janus himself may have been origin- ally TrpoLpd'ro-os. As such he is portrayed on a middle-brass of Hadrian 16 : he stands facing us, a bearded figure with one hand resting on his hip and the other holding a sceptre, while his three visages are distinctly seen, one full-face, the other two in profile. Further, the Celtic three-headed god, of whom I shall have more to say elsewhere, has been identified with Janus.17 The existence of a triple Janus supports my argument for the existence of a triple Jupiter, since, as Dr. Frazer pointed out to me, there are strong reasons for believ- ing that Janus was only another form of Jupiter.s8 To begin with, his name connects with ZeV'q, Jupiter, etc.,19 and the following pairs of divinities should be equated : 1 Claud. de cons.

It is probable that Janus with four faces (Macrob. 1. 9. 13, Lyd. de mens. 4. 1, Suid. s.v. 'IavovucpLos, alib.) was an amplification, not of Janus with three faces, but of Janus with two; for Janus Quadrifrons was also called Janus Geminus (Aug. de civ. Dei 7. 8).

Dianus (Janus) and Diana (Jana). Jupiter and Juno. Next note that Jupiter was actually sur- named Janus; for an inscription from Aquileia records a dedication lovi Diano.1 Conversely, several titles of Janus recall Jupiter. Thus the oldest hymns of the Salii spoke of him as ' deorum deus,' 2 and he was often invoked as Ianus pater3 or Ianuspater.4 Again, according to one ver- sion 5 Janus not Jupiter was the mate of Juturna; and the title Janus Junonius6 implies a similar relation to Juno. On cer- tain occasions joint offerings were made to Janus and Jupiter,7 or to Janus and Juno,S or to Janus and Jupiter and Juno.9 Janus alone took precedence of Jupiter in the divine hierarchy 10 and the rex sacrorum, who seems to have been in a sense his special priest, took similar precedence of the flamen Dialis.11 In view of these facts I would venture to suggest that Janus was the name under which Jupiter was wor- shipped by the Aborigines of Rome, a tribe -as Prof. Ridgeway has shown 12-akin to the Pelasgians, and that, when these Abori- gines were conquered by the incoming Italians, their ancient deity Janus and his consort Jana were retained side by side with the Italian Jupiter and Juno. Herodian 13 calls Janus OEb aopXatOaTOVr 7 'IT a X ta a SX p o v; Labeo14 terms him IIHarpKLov (oEot a rT d 0 o v a; and Septimius Serenus'1 says of him :' tibi vetus ara caluit Aborigineo sacello.' Whether the three-headed Janus was an oak-god, we do not know for certain. But it is probable. The oak sacred to Thybris,16 his son,17 points in that direction. When the Plebs seceded to the Janiculum, an ancient seat of Janus, it was in a grove of oaks that Q. Hortensius the dictator passed his famous law ' ut quod ea iussisset omnes Quirites teneret.' 18 Plutarch19 states that Marcellus fashioned a trophy out of a large oak-tree and presented it to Jupiter Fere- trius; but Virgil and Servius make him present it to Quirinus, and according to the rule quoted by Festus from the libri ponti- ficum the precise dedication should have been 'Ianui Quirino.' 20 This title Quirinus which is elsewhere borne by Janus,21 I take to mean 'the oak-god' (conn. quer-cu-s, 7rpIvo-s),22 1 C..L. v. 783. 2 Macrob. 1. 9. 14, 16. Varro de ling. Lat. 7. 27 quotes a Salian line in which the phrase ' divom deo' occurs. He has also (ib. 26) preserved five lines of a Salian hymn which, if we could be sure of the reading o Zeu (Lindsay Lat. lang. p. 5), would prove that the Salii identified Janus with Zeus. BIhreins P.L. M. fragg. p. 30 prints them thus: Ozefil, o d6mine, es 6mnium I patdr! Patdilci, Clodsi, I es iineds, ians es! I duonds ceruis es oCnus, I promd- lios diuom recum.

Further reflexion attracts me greatly to your derivation ; the word seems so exactly the counter- part of Gr. irpTvos, which properly would be an adjective (and thence a derivative substantive mean- ing 'the tree rather like an oak') : I should there- fore trace it not to *Querinus (though I do not say, and I doubt if any one can, that this form could not have given quirinus) but to qQ(r)rinus the almost literal equivalent of Gr. lrpvor= IEu. qur-inos. The meaning of Quirites 'oaken-spear-men' would be excellent. Further it gives, at last, an excellent meaning for the Sabine town Cures (for *Quires probably) i.e. "The Oaks," [The country about Cures abounded in oaks : Strab. 228. J.G.F.] and explains the connexion felt between this name and Quirites for which there has hitherto been no his- torical explanation that I know of. Mars Quirinus the god 'of the oak' is very parallel to your Dodon- aean Zeus. As to the influence of an i in a neigh- bouring syllable, which, I suggest, converted *Quari- nus into Quirinus, cf. diligit, colligit, as against neglegit, primitivus against genetivus (Brugmann Grundr. i2 ? 244, 3). These are near, but not quite parallel. No one has yet collected examples of the changes in pre-tonic syllables like Quir- in Quirinus, but some changes there certainly were.' Dr. J. H. Moulton, whom I consulted on the same subject, wrote to me last June as follows : ' quirinus,</page><page sequence="10">THE OLASSICAL REVIEW. 369 quiris, the Sabine curis,1 being the ' oaken spear,' 2 and Quirites, the 'men of the oaken spear.' 3 Now a tree-god is often represented by a post or sceptre or spear.4 In the Tigillum Sororium,5 adjoining which were altars to Juno Sororia and to Janus Curiatius, I would recognise such a repre- sentation of the triple Janus. It was a trixylon composed of two vertical beams and a cross-bar ; and the 'trigemini Hora- tii et Curiatii,' with whose legend it was connected, were possibly the champions of the triple god.6 The Tigillum Sororium is expressly compared 7 with the 'yoke,' under which conquered troops were made to pass: this too, being an erection of three staves 8 or spears,9 may well have been a symbol of Janus Quirinus. Finally, every door, since it consisted of a lintel and two side-posts, was sacred to Janus 10 and named after him : ianua is derived from lanus, not Ianus from ianua. Diana or Jana was likewise triceps, tri- formnis, triplex, tergemina," and an oak-god- dess. One of her most famous cults was that on the Mons Tifata near Capua, and Paulus 12 interprets tifata by ilicetct, 'oak groves.' He adds: ' Romae autem fVifata curia,' 13 which suggests that the word curia (cp. curis, Janus Curiatius, etc.) originally denoted an 'oak-grove.' It has long been held that curia is related to Quirites,14 and it is highly probable that the local council would meet in the grove of the local oak- god: the Galatian senate met at Apv- VEIETOS 15; the Romans, as we have just seen, in aesculeto. That the sacred tree of Diana at Nemi was an oak is probable from the fact that the grove in which it stood was sacred to Egeria16 the oak-nymph. Another important cult-centre of Diana was on the oak-clad Mt. Algidus.17 The chief temple of Diana at Rome was on the Aventine,1s whose slopes were covered in early days with the oak-wood of Picus and Faunus 19 : Picus (= 8pvoKoXd7rr77s) was con- stantly associated with the oak-cult, and Faunus was the husband of an oak-nymph.20 A 'very great and venerable sanctuary of Diana' was on the Caeliolus,21 which formed part of the Mons Querquetulanus.22 There was also an ancient Dianium on the Fagu- tal 23: the beech-trees of the spot may have been a ritual, as they were certainly an etymological (by s= fagus), equivalent for oaks; Varro 24 in his account of the Esqui- line mentions the view that it was so called ' ab eo quod aescul[is consi]tae a rege Tullio essent' and supports it by the statement that there were in the vicinity 'lucus... facutalis et Larum Querquetulanum sacel- lum.' The same change from oak to beech may have taken place on the hill called Come near Tusculum, where Diana was worshipped in an ancient grove 'fagei nemoris.' 25 The cult of an oak-Diana is well illustrated by a relief in the Palazzo Colonna at Rome, reproduced as Fig. 3 (= B6tticher Baumkultus Fig. 26).26 An old but fruitful oak stands in a walled enclosure, its trunk etc. will fit 7rpfvos very well if we suppose a word like qeri or qsrri, "'an oak," or (incorporating the suffix, which might be like the -en in oaken,) qr(r)rinos:in view of quirites I rather prefer the former. In that case we must entirely separate quercus, Idg. perqyu-, to which belong fir, Skt. parkati, and the derivatives Erku-nia (Keltic Tcr- cynia), Norse Piorgynn, Lith. Perkltnas, 0 Slav. Peru~nu, and (I think possibly) Skt. Parjanya. The similarity of quercus and quiri'nus will be accidental like that of sorry and sorrow, etc.' It should be added that Schrader Preh. Antiqq. p. 272 n. 1 connected quer-c-us with p--v-os (for *qrl-no-s, cp. quer-n-us); and that Linde de Iano etc. p. 43 f. referred the title Quirinus to the root of quercus, though he took it to mean ' the god of the strong, fortified place ' not 'the oak-god.' 1 Conway, Italic Dialects, i. 353. 2 Cp. 6pv and Gp s, allyavzl and aesculus (*aeg- sculus).

Tradi- tion said that Janus reigned as a king on the Janiculan,1 which probably implies that the local rex was regarded as the incarnation of Janus and bore his name. This belief in Janus incarnate has left traces of itself at a much later date. Coins of the gens Pompeia represent a double-headed Janus with the features of Pompey,2 and coins of Commodus make the emperor Janiform.3 The primitive folk over whom king Janus reigned claimed to be sprung from oak- trees 4 and-as we now know-buried their infant dead in trunks of oak,5 very possibly with some idea of re-birth.6 I have suggested that, when the Abori- gines were overcome by the Italians, Jupiter took his place beside Janus and by degrees ousted that deity from his ancient pre- eminence. Throughout the whole of Roman history there was a latent belief in ' humani loves.' 7 Not only did kings, dictators, triumphing generals, and praetors presiding at the games wear the insignia of Jupiter, but as soon as the empire was established there was a recrudescence of the belief that the ruling monarch was Jupiter incarnate. Julius Caesar was actually worshipped under the title Jupiter and provided with M. Antonius as flamen Dialiss--a most singular case of history repeating itself ; for we have seen that the Julii of yore were human Jupiters.9 Greek coins name Livia the wife of Augustus AIBIAN HPAN.10 Caligula assumed the title Optimus Maximus and had the head of a famous Greek statue of Zeus 'OXv/pLos; replaced by a head of him- self. He was also saluted as Jupiter Latiaris, 11 a fact perhaps connected with his assassina- tion of the rex Nemorensis 12 who seems to have personated that god.13 Domitian was called ZE,'S 14 and Jupiter 15 by the poets. A dedication to Hadrian as lovi Olympio is extant.16 Oppian 17 speaks of Septimius Severus as 'the Ausonian ZEV'd.' Diocle- tian aped the majesty of Jupiter and took the name lovius.'s This identification of the emperor with Jupiter doubtless inspired many works of art: e.g. the cornelian at Berlin here figured (Fig. 4),19 which repre- :: : I?% rt!~lrlS~~I FIG. 4. sents two Jupiters with thunderbolt and eagle-tipped sceptre seated side by side, may have been meant to suggest that the terres- trial Jupiter was as potent as his celestial counterpart-20 cp.

It would thus afford a Roman parallel to the central scene of the Parthenon frieze, which-if I may hazard a conjecture-depicts the ao-rL- Xhvg and pao-rtho-a of Athens about to receive the sacred peplos and two thrones from their respective attendants: the king per- haps wearing the former and seated, with his consort, on the latter, will then take his place among the enthroned deities on either hand. A signed cornelian in the Orleans collection is described by S. Reinach as 'Jupiter ou Auguste en Jupiter,' the latter view being taken by most archaeolo- gists.,21 A cameo formerly in the Marl- borough cabinet shows Claudius as.Jupiter.22 And similar portraits of emperors in the guise of Jupiter are known in statuary also.23 Much of the pomp affected by the Roman emperors was due to this r6le of human 1 Ainob. 3. 29, Macrob. 1. 7. 19, Serv.

Caesar's chariot dedicated on the Capitol vraVpdo-nWirov T ALL2 and Nero's peregrinations in triumphal cars,3 the eagle released from the pyre of Augustus and later emperors,4 these and many other indications point to the same conclusion. Numismatic types of consecratio are a lofty pyre sur- mounted by a four-horse chariot or an eagle bearing upwards the imperial soul.5 With these compare the coins of Amaseia that refer to the cult of the oak-Zeus 6 (Fig. 5) : a - " -ll- I? inn rp FIG. 5. in both cases we have the pyre, the quadriga and the eagle. Even the connexion with the oak is not wanting; for coins of the gens Julia show Pietas wearing a wreath of oak,7 while over the door of Augustus 8 and his successors9 an oak-crown was regularly suspended by decree of the Senate. If it be objected that this was but the corona civica bestowed in perpetuity,10 it must be iemembered that the corona civica was made of oak-leaves because the oak was sacred to Jupiter." When the Roman emperors weire thus adorned, they were but following the practice of the ancient oak-kings, the Silvii whom Virgil represents as crowned 'civili ... quercu.' 12 The general impression pro- duced on the public by the sight of Augustus' palace may be gathered from Ovid's couplet: ' et Iovis haec' dixi 'domus est ?' quod ut esse putarem, augurium menti querna corona dabat.13 When the Italian Jupiter succeeded to the Aboriginal Janus he brought in his train two other gods, who together with him stood at the head of Roman religion through- out the historical period. The triad Jupi- ter, Mars, Quirinus were represented by the three flamines maiores, who in order of pre- cedence immediately followed the king.14 Some of the oldest religious usages of Rome linked their names together. Thus the Salii were ' in tutela Iovis Martis Quirini.' 15 Numa ordained that the first spolia opima should be presented to Jupiter Feretrius, the second to Mars, the third to Quirinus.16 The first treaty with Carthage was made by the fetiales in the name of Jupiter Lapis, the last in that of Mars and Quirinus.17 The same three gods are conjointly invoked in the old formula of devotio.'s My sugges- tion is that they were originally three forms of Jupiter, Mars being Jupiter as a war-godl' and Quirinus Jupiter as an oak-god. Servius0? definitely states that Quirinus was the pacific form of Mars; and his identification is accepted by all :21 I have only to add that, if Quirinus means 'oak-god,' we should expect to find the oak sacred to Mars. And this was the case. Aeneas lopped a huge oak- tree and set it up 'tibi, magne, tropaeum, I Bellipotens.' 22 An oak adolrned with spoils 1 Dr. Frazer remarks that Jupiter was surnamed Rex (Cic. de rep. 3. 14. 23, cp.

Valerius Flaccus describes the tree on which the golden fleece was hung as the oak of Mavors or Mars or Gradivus.2 On the suburban estate of the Flavii was an ancient oak sacred to Mars.3 The wood- pecker too, a bird regularly associated with the oak, was known as the picus Martius.4 It remains to show that Quirinus was one with Jupiter. This appears not only from the fact that Janus, the Aboriginal Jupiter, was surnamed Quirinus, but also from the fact that the Italian Jupiter bore the same surname: two tiles from Casteldieri 5 are inscribed [Io]vi Quirino and Iovi Cyrin[o] C. T'ati AMax. Juno too, whose cult on the Arx corresponded to that of Jupiter on the Capitolium, wore like her partner a wreath of oak,6 and was titled Quiritis (Curitis) at Rome and elsewhere.7 Again, all these deities were symbolised by a staff or spear. Of Janus as represented by the staves or spears of the Salii, etc., and of Jupiter as represented by a sceptre, we have spoken.8 The oldest xoanon of Mars at Rome was likewise a spear (8t'pv, hasta) kept in the Regia and addressed as Mars:9 when the hastae Martiae stirred, it was a sign of wa.r and sacrifices were offered to Jupiter, Mars, etc.1' We hear also of the ' arma Quirini '; 11 coins of the gens Fabia show a flamen Quirinalis seated with an apex, a spear, and a shield marked QVIRIN ;12 and antiquarians derived Quirinus from quiris (curis).13 Juno Quiritis (Curitis) was also known as Juno Quiris (Curis) 14 from the spear with which she was originally identified.15 Further, Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus-like Janus before them-all bore the title pater,16 while Juno was correspondingly mater.17 If the view here taken of the triad Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus is correct, one might expect that the third member of the triad should bear not only the adjectival name Quirinus, but also a proper name like those of Jupiter and Mars. This expectation is justified; for in the Praenestine Calendar March 7 is a festival [I]ovi[s M]artis Vediovis inter duos lucos.'s Cp. also the Umbrian triad Jupiter, Mars, Vofionus (luve, Marte, Yofione), who were worshipped under the common title Grabovius.19 Again, if Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus were indeed but diverse forms of Jupiter, the curiously discrepant accounts of the spolia opima become at once consistent. All authorities agree that Romulus dedi- cated the spoils of Acron to Jupiter Feretrius. But, whereas Livy 20 states that Cossus did the same with those of Lar Tolumnius, Servius 21 is equally explicit in declaring that Cossus dedicated them to Mars.22 And, whereas Plutarch23 asserts that Marcellus presented the spoils of Viridomarus to Jupiter Feretrius, Virgil 24 and Servius ad loc. make him present them to Quirinus. Finally, it is not surprising to find that sundry Roman monarchs were related to Mars and Quirinus rather than to Jupiter. Romulus, the son of Mars by Rhea Silvia,2y was identified with Quirinus 26 just as Latinus and Aeneas were identified with Jupiter. Hadrian and later emperors were portrayed as Mars.27 Cicero calls Julius Caesar 'o-v'vvaov Quirino' and 'Quirini contubernalemr' because a statue of him inscribed deo invicto had been erected in the temple of Quirinus.2s Augus- tus had a round temple of Mars Ultor built ' in imitation of that of Jupiter Feretrius '29 and was himself saluted as Quirinus.30 Varro enumerated the gods recognised by Romulus as follows: 'Ianum, lovem, In RJiftn. 1. 339. 2 5. 229 ff., 251 f., 7. 519. 3 Suet.

Mars, as a specialised form of Jupiter, had probably arisen before the Italians entered Italy. We find him worshipped side by side with Jupiter in both the eastern (Umbro-Sabellian) and western (Latin) branches, and there is some evidence that the differentiation took place outside the peninsula: thus the ancient Italian title for Jupiter, Loucetius or Lucetius,' is ap- plied in the forms Loucetius and Leucetius to Mars throughout the Celtic area.2 How- ever that may be, it is clear that the Italian Mars constantly figures as a warlike Jupiter. As such he was an oak-god in the Umbro- Sabellian states. The Flavii in their Sabine home had an old oak sacred to Mars.3 The Picentines derived their name from the woodpecker of Mars, which had guided their wanderings.4 At Tiora Matiena, a town of the Aborigines in the territory of the Aequi, there was an ancient oracle of Mars consisting of a woodpecker perched upon a post.5 Dionysius expressly compares it to the oracle at Dodona, so that Wagler is probably right in his surmise that the post was of oak.6 It is represented on various ancient gems7 as a pillar with a serpent twined round it, a woodpecker perched upon it, and sometimes a ram laid as an offering before it: in front of the pillar stands a warrior apparently consult- ing the oracle. The Picius Martius (piquier Mlartier), who figures on the Tables of Iguvium,8 shows that the Umbrians had the same cult. But, despite the popularity of Mars, Jupiter retained his hold on the Italian mind.9 One of the most striking proofs of this is the series of li~vilas or heraldic dedi- cations found in Campania.10 Prof. Conway 11 says of them:' Only one of the inscc. ex- plicitly dedicates its iavil' to any one in particular, namely 108, which 'stands' to Jupiter *Flagius. The most obvious deri- vation for the word (d)ifvild itself is from (d)iou- or (d)iouio-. But further, 109 relates to a ii~vil standing 'next to the door of the lucus' (which was presumably sacred to some one). A large number of the Curti specimens...were found...within the precinct of a temple identified as that of Juno Lucina... It is quite possible [W. IR.] that she shared the temple with her divine consort, as Dione shared with Zeus the temple at Dodona.' I would suggest that the ii~vil&amp; column marked with the armorial bearings of this or that family represents the ancestor of the family in his character as a human Jupiter. ARTHUR BERINARD COOK.
