<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRITICAL REVIEWS anthropomorphic conception of God. The author contends that the con- ception of personality as applied to God does not belong to the "classical theology of Christendom" and that the phrase is unknown to Christian theology until well within the last two hundred years. On the whole this book gives the impression that humanism is too diverse and inconsistent within the writings of those included under the name of "humanist" to allow a clear and decisive refutation of it. The difficulty of refuting it is increased by the fact that the representatives of theism cited are not in agreement among themselves. The two terms- humanism and theism-really represent two general movements of thought: the former concerned with the development of modern science in the interest of human welfare and the latter with the defense of tradi- tional theological concepts. They thus move on quite different levels. EDWARD SCRIBNER AMES University of Chicago Our Knowledge of God. By JOHN BAILLIE. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, I939. ix+263 pages. $2.50. Besides being a significant contribution to the discussion of a peren- nially important theme, this is a delightful book, beautifully argued and beautifully written, and it will not have fulfilled its true vocation unless many besides the technical theologians read it. The basic thesis of the book is that our knowledge of God is not in- ferential, derived as a conclusion from a surer knowledge of the things of sense, but is direct and immediate. God is "of all realities that by which we are most directly and intimately confronted." His existence is there- fore not to be established by "proofs." Such proofs are really rationaliza- tions of a knowledge already possessed, and the traditional arguments have the value only of enabling us better to understand the God whose existence we either cannot doubt or cannot argue ourselves into believing. Baillie thus stands nearer to Anselm and Bonaventura than to Thomas. But this direct knowledge of God is not a prior knowledge in the sense of being something innate and independent of experience. Rather, God con- fronts us inescapably "in, with, and under" all of our experiences. Knowl- edge of him is thus not an inference from other knowledge but is part and parcel of all knowledge. We could not know ourselves, other minds, na- ture, or God, Baillie suggests, if we did not know all four together. He reviews recent researches into the problem of our knowledge of other minds to demonstrate that our knowledge of God, like our knowl- edge of others, is not knowledge of an object but of another subject; and I9I</page><page sequence="2">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION that such subject-subject knowledge is of a radically different order from the other, not to be described in the same terms nor tested by the same criteria. Here and often elsewhere the influence of Kierkegaard and Barth is manifest, but these thinkers are dealt with critically. The recent con- troversy between Barth and Brunner, to which Professor Lehmann refers in an article in this issue, is handled in most illuminating fashion. There are also enlightening discussions of Descartes, Kant, and others who have seriously wrestled with the epistemological problem. The general attitude Baillie would take toward these philosophers is indicated with sufficient accuracy by what has been said of his own position. William Temple's famous remark that the day when Descartes hit upon cogito ergo sum was "perhaps the most disastrous moment in the history of Europe" is quoted with approval. But although Kant went some distance in rescuing us from the Cartesian subjectivity by his affirmation of the unconditional imperative, he failed, according to Baillie, in not seeing that God is actually present in the imperative, and not merely to be inferred from it. I have already paid tribute to the clarity and precision of Dr. Baillie's argument. I found the book confusing at only one point: it was not al- ways clear when the author was basing his argument upon presumbly universal grounds and when he was speaking from an explicitly Christian point of view. The reader's own presuppositions will largely determine his judgment of the truth of the argument. Consistent Barthians, Thomists, and naturalists will not find it convincing. This reader found it congenial and stimulating. At the very least, I believe it can be said that Dr. Baillie has been true to the facts of religious experience, especially within the Christian tradition, and such fidelity is the first obligation of the the- ologian. JOHN KNOX University of Chicago Das protestantische Prinzip in Kirche und Welt. By THEODOR SIEGFRIED. Halle: Akademischer Verlag, I939. xvi+528 pages. Rm. 15.80. Theodor Siegfried was, until the recent closing of his university, a professor of theology at Marburg. Some scholars in this country have known him through his participation a few years ago in the work of the "Kairos" group of Paul Tillich. Others have known him because of his close association with the late Rudolf Otto. Still others are familiar with his three-volume attack on the dialectical theologians, Barth, Bultmann, and Gogarten. Of these volumes it is reported that Karl Barth once said, "The best way to answer Siegfried is never to mention him." Thus the Barthians disposed of Siegfried by means of a conspiracy of silence.
